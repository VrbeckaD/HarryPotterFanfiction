    <p>The place was high as a church, full of nothing but towering shelves covered in small, dusty, glass orbs. They glimmered dully in the light issuing from the blue flames of the burning candles in brackets set at intervals along the shelves.</p><p>They stood grouped around the end of the row, gazing down the alley beside it. “There was nobody here Harry,” Hermione stated tentatively, but he did not respond; his mouth felt very dry now.</p><p>“He might be….” Harry whispered hoarsely, peering down the alley next to them. “Or maybe…” He hurried to look down the one beyond that.</p><p>“Harry?” said Hermione again. “What?” he snarled.</p><p>“I … I don’t think Sirius is here.” Nobody spoke. Harry did not want to look at any of them. He felt sick.</p><p>He didn’t understand why Sirius wasn’t here. There was no sign of Sirius anywhere. “Harry?” Ron called. “What?” Harry repeated glumly.</p><p>“Its -- its got your name on it,” said Ron pointing at a small sphere midway of the tall shelf. Harry moved a little closer.</p><p>“My name?” said Harry blankly wondering why his name would be on anything at the ministry.</p><p>The small glass sphere glowed with a dull inner light, though it was very dusty and appeared not to have been touched for many years.</p><p>“Harry, I don’t think you should touch it,” said Hermione sharply as he stretched out his hand. “Why not?”He questioned. “Its something to do with me isn’t it?”</p><p>“I know where we are,” Neville said in curious awe; looking at the many rows of shelving each holding various round orbs upon them. “This is the hall of prophesy. All recorded prophecies are stored here once predicted some never leave the shelves while others are retrieve by those, whom they prophecy pertain.”</p><p>“I don’t think you should touch it Harry,” said Neville suddenly. “I have a very bad feeling about this. What if you were lured here to do just that. I don’t think you-know- who would enter the ministry to retrieve it himself and you’re the only other person who can remove it from the shelf.”</p><p>Harry’s face held a doubtful expression; surely nothing would happen if he lifted the dusty glass orb from the shelf. “What’s the worst that could happen?” thought Harry.</p><p>The way Neville spoke told of his knowledge of this room left little doubt in their mind that he knew what he was talking about.</p><p>“I agree with Neville mate, maybe we should just get out of here,” Ron suggested.</p><p>“It’s got my name on it,” said Harry, feeling slightly reckless he closed his fingers around the dusty balls surface. He expected it to feel cold but it did not.</p><p>He was so tired of secrets being kept from him. Dumbledore never told him there was a prophecy about him. He’d asked many times over the years why Voldemort was after him yet Dumbledore always made an excuse not to answer.</p><p>From right behind them, a drawling voice said, “very good Potter. Now turn around, nice and slowly, and give that to me.”</p><p>Black shapes emerged out of thin air around them blocking their way left and right; eyes glinting through slits in hoods a dozen lit wand tips were pointing directly at their hearts.</p><p>Ginny gave an gasp of horror. “This was definitely not good,” she thought looking at the hooded figures.</p><p>“To me, Potter,” repeated the drawling voice of Lucius Malfoy as he held out his gloved hand, palm up.</p><p>Harry’s insides plummeted sickeningly. “Maybe I should’ve listen to Neville,” he thought.</p><p>“To me, “said Malfoy yet again.</p><p>“Where’s Sirius?” Harry asked instead. Several Death Eaters laughed. A harsh female voice from the midst of the shadowy figures to Harry’s left said triumphantly, “The Dark Lord always knows!”</p><p>“Always,” echoed Malfoy softly. “Now give me the prophecy, Potter.”</p><p>“I want to know where Sirius is!”</p><p>“I want to know where Sirius is” mimicked the woman to his left. She and her fellow Death Eaters had closed in so that they were a few mere feet away from Harry and the others, the light from their wands dazzling Harry’s eyes.</p><p>“You’ve got him,” said Harry, ignoring the rising panic in his chest. “He’s here. I know he is.”</p><p>The whittle baby woke up fwightened and fort what it dweamed was twoo.” said the woman in a horrible mock baby voice that grated on Harry’s nerves.</p><p>Harry felt Ron stir beside him.</p><p>“Azkaban really has really done a number on you hasn’t it?” Hermione questioned “Or were you always this delusional?”</p><p>“You dare speak to me you filthy little mud blood,” Bellatrix hissed.</p><p>“Don’t call her that you filthy excuse of Death Eater scum!” Ginny snapped her fear leaving her as her anger took over.</p><p>“Mental that one, I’m telling ya,” said Ron looking at the slightly deranged witch before them despite the very dangerous situation they were currently in.</p><p>“Don’t do anything” he muttered. “Not yet --”</p><p>“You hear him? You hear him? Giving instructions to the other children as though he thinks of fighting us!”</p><p>“Oh, you don’t know Potter as I do, Bellatrix,” said Lucius softly.</p><p>“He has a great weakness for heroics; the Dark Lord understands this about him. Now give me the prophecy Potter”.</p><p>“I know Sirius is here,” said Harry.</p><p>“For Merlin sakes Harry, will you just face it Sirius isn’t here,” Ron snapped in irritation.</p><p>Harry’s refusal to believe that this was all just an elaborate plot to get him to retrieve a dusty ball of glass for his worst enemy didn’t sit well with Ron. Harry was known to be stubborn but there was nothing there to suggest that Sirius had ever been in the hall of prophesy and every reason to believe that Harry had been tricked into coming.</p><p>“Its time you learn the difference between life and dreams Potter,” said Malfoy. “Now give me the prophecy, or we start using wands?”</p><p>“Go on then.” said Harry raising is wand, Ron, Hermione, Neville, Ginny and Luna rose on either side of him. The knot in Harry’s stomach tightened. If Sirius really wasn’t there; he had led his friends to their deaths for no reason at all.</p><p>Harry squared his shoulders if he was going to die tonight he would do it with honor and wasn’t planning to cower in front of adults who feared to show their faces when they attacked not wanting anyone knowing who they were.</p><p>“Hand over the prophecy and no one needs to get hurt,” said Malfoy coolly. It was Harry’s turn to laugh.</p><p>“Yeah right!” I give you this -- prophecy is it? And you’ll just let us skip off home, will you?”</p><p>Harry was far from stupid. The deatheaters were not known for allowing captives to leave with their lives. And Lucius Malfoy was as nasty as they came. Harry hadn’t forgotten the man tried to kill him in his 2nd year at Hogwarts.</p><p>The words were hardly out of his mouth when the female Death Eater shrieked; “Accio Proph--” But Harry was ready for her, shouting “Portego” before she finished her spell.</p><p>“Oh he knows how to play, little baby Potter,” she said her mad eyes staring through the slits in her hood.</p><p>Lucius however was shocked. He wasn’t aware the boy knew more than the school curriculum magic spells.</p><p>“Very well, then ---!”</p><p>“I TOLD YOU NO!” Lucius Malfoy roared at the woman. “If you smash it ---”</p><p>“You need more persuasion?” she questioned, her chest rising and falling rapidly. “Very well - take the smallest one,” she ordered the Death Eater beside her.</p><p>“Let him watch while we torture the little girl. I’ll do it.” Harry felt the others close in around Ginny.</p><p>“You’ll have to smash this if you want to attack any of us. I don’t think your boss will be too pleased if you come back without it will he?”</p><p>“Voldemort won’t be pleased not in the least” said Harry.</p><p>“You dare speak his name?” whispered Bellatrix.</p><p>“Yeah,” said Harry, “I have no problem saying Vol --”</p><p>“Shut your mouth!” Bellatrix shrieked. “You dare speak his name with your unworthy lips, you dare besmirch it with you half-bloods tongue, you dare ---”</p><p>“Bit obsessed about him isn’t she. If I didn’t know better I would think her in love with him,” said Hermione watching the scene with an odd sort of fascination. She couldn’t decide if she should fear this obviously psychotic woman or feel sorry for her. Voldemort had done a thorough job of manipulating and brain washing her.</p><p>“Did you know he’s a half-blood too?” said Harry recklessly. Hermione gave a little moan in his ear.</p><p>“Gosh Harry don‘t antagonize them,” thought Hermione as she tried to figure out a solution to their immediate problem.</p><p>“Voldemort?” Yeah his mother was a witch but his dad was a muggle -- or has he been telling you lot he’s pureblood?”</p><p>“STUPEF---” “NO!”</p><p>A jet of red light had shot from the end of Bellatrix Lestrange’s wand, but Malfoy had deflected it. His spell caused hers to hit the shelf a foot to Harry’s left and several of the glass orbs there shattered.</p><p>Two figures, pearly white as ghosts, fluid as smoke, unfurled them-selves from the fragments of broken glass upon the floor and each began to speak. Their voices vied with each other, so that only fragments of what they were saying could be heard over Malfoy and Bellatrix shouts.</p><p>“DO NOT ATTACK! WE NEED THE PROPHECY!”</p><p>The two figures that had burst from the shattered spheres had melted into thin air. Nothing remained of them or their erstwhile homes but fragments of glass upon the floor.</p><p>A peculiar expression came over Harry’s face as his mind raced developing a plan that he hoped would get he and his friends out of this alive.</p><p>He dared -- he dares -----” shrieked Bellatrix incoherently,” __ he stands there ___ filthy half-blood.</p><p>“WAIT UNTIL WE’VE GOT THE PROPHECY!” bawled Malfoy.</p><p>“You haven’t told me what’s so special about this prophecy I’m suppose to be handing over,” he said, playing for time. He moved his foot slowly sideways, feeling around for someone else’s.</p><p>“Do not play games with us, Potter,” said Malfoy.</p><p>“I’m not playing games,” said Harry, half his mind on the conversation, half on his wandering foot. And then he found someone’s toes and pressed down on them. A sharp intake of breath behind him told him they were Hermione’s.</p><p>“What?” she whispered</p><p>“Dumbledore never told you that the reason you bear that scar was hidden in the bowels of the Department of Mysteries?” said Malfoy sneeringly.</p><p>“I---what?” said Harry, and for a moment he quite forgot his plan.</p><p>“What about my scar?”</p><p>“What?” whispered Hermione more urgently behind him.</p><p>“Can this be?” said Malfoy, sounding maliciously delighted; some of the Death Eaters were laughing again, and under cover of their laughter, Harry hissed to Hermione moving his lips as little as possible, “Smash shelves---”</p><p>“Dumbledore never told you?” Malfoy repeated. “Well, this explains why you didn’t come earlier, Potter, the Dark Lord wondered why---”<br/>
“---when I say go---”</p><p>“---you didn’t come running when he showed you the place where it was hidden in your dreams. He thought natural curiosity would make you want to hear the exact wording….”</p><p>“Did he?” said Harry. Behind him he felt rather than heard Hermione passing his message to the others and he sought to keep talking, to distract the Death Eaters. “So he wanted me to come and get it did he? Why?”</p><p>“Why?” Malfoy sounded incredulously delighted. “Because the only people who are permitted to retrieve a prophecy from the Department of Mysteries, Potter, are those about whom it was made, as the Dark Lord discovered when he attempted to use others to steal it.</p><p>“See I was right,” Neville whispered to his friends.</p><p>“And why did he want to steal a prophecy about me?”</p><p>“About both of you, Potter, about both of you…. Haven’t you ever wondered why the Dark Lord tried to kill you as a baby?”</p><p>“Uh, because, he’s a psycho maybe,” Harry offered.</p><p>“So someone made a prophecy and he’s made me come and get it for him? Why couldn’t he come and get it himself?”</p><p>“Get it himself?” shrieked Bellatrix on a cackle of mad laughter. “The Dark Lord, walk into the Ministry of Magic, when they are so sweetly ignoring his return? The Dark Lord reveal himself to the Aurors, when at the moment they are wasting their time on my dear cousin?”</p><p>“So he’s got you doing his dirty work for him, has he?” said Harry. “Like he tried to get Sturgis to steal it---- and Bode?”</p><p>“Very good, Potter, very good……” said Malfoy slowly, “But the Dark Lord knows you are not unintell---”</p><p>“NOW!” yelled Harry.</p><p>Five different voices behind him bellowed “REDUCTO” the five spells flew in five different directions and the shelves opposite them exploded as they hit.</p><p>The towering structure swayed as a hundred glass spheres burst apart, pearly white figures unfurled into the air and floated there, their voices echoing from who knew what long-dead past amid the torrent of crashing glass and splintered wood now raining down upon the floor----</p><p>“RUN!” Harry yelled seizing a hand full of Hermione’s robes dragging her forward the others following closely behind them closing the door to the circular room when they entered Harry slammed the door.</p><p>Death Eaters lunged forward though the cloud of dust and Harry elbowed him hard in the mask face. They were all yelling , there were cries of pain, thunderous crashes as the shelves collapsed upon them-selves, weirdly echoing fragments of the Seers unleashed from their spheres---</p><p>Ron, Ginny and Luna sprinted pass Harry their arms over their heads. Something heavy struck him on the side of his face but he merely ducked his head and sprinted onward.</p><p>“Stupefy!” cried Hermione when she noticed the hand grabbing for Harry.</p><p>He could hear footsteps behind them and Hermione urging Neville on. The door through which they arrive stood ajar, he pelted through it, the prophecy still clutched tight in and safe in his hand, as he waited for the others to hurtle over the threshold before slamming the door behind them—</p><p> </p><p>“Colloportus!” gasped Hermione sealing the door with an odd squelching sound.</p><p>“Where---where are the others?” gasps Harry, just noticing Ron, Ginny and Luna weren’t with them.</p><p>“They must have gone the wrong way!” whispered Hermione, terror on her face.</p><p>“Listen!” whispered Neville.</p><p>“Leave Nott, leave him I say, the Dark Lord will not care for Nott’s injuries as much as losing that prophecy ---- Jugson, come back here we need to organize!</p><p>We’ll split into pairs and search, and don’t forget, be gentle with Potter until we’ve got the prophecy. You can kill the others if necessary.</p><p>“Why aren’t you getting a partner?” Bellatrix questioned. “Don’t question me,” Lucius snarled just go.</p><p>“What do we do?” Hermione asked Harry, trembling from head to foot.</p><p>“Well, we don’t stand here waiting for them to find us, for start,” said Harry. “Let’s get away from this door…...”</p><p>They ran quietly as they could past the shimmering bell jar where the tiny egg was hatching and unhatching, towards the exit into the circular hallway at the far end of the room. They were almost there when Harry heard something large and heavy collide with the door Hermione had charmed shut.</p><p>“Stand aside!” said a rough voice. “Alohomora!”</p><p>As the door flew open, Harry, Hermione, and Neville dived under desks. They could see the bottom of the two Death Eaters’ robes drawing nearer, their feet moving rapidly.</p><p>“They might’ve run straight through to the hall,” said the rough voice.</p><p>Check under the desks,” said another.</p><p>“Stupefy!” Harry cried sending the red spell at the nearest Death Eater, who fell backward into a grandfather clock.</p><p>“Avada---”</p><p>Harry ran towards the Death eater grabbing him around the legs sending them both crashing to the floor.</p><p>Hermione stood frozen in fear knowing that she came very close to being killed.</p><p>Neville however overturned his desk in his anxiety to he cried “Expelliarmus!” sending both Harry’s and the Death Eater’s wand across the room.</p><p>“Get out of the way Harry!” yelled Neville, clearing determined to repair the damage.</p><p>Harry flung himself sideways as Neville took aim again and shouted “Stupefy!”</p><p>But Neville’s aim was once again off and his spell crashed into a glass-fronted cabinet on the wall full of various shaped hourglasses.</p><p>This distraction allowed the Death Eater to regain his wand. Harry ducked behind another desk. In his anger the Death Eater ripped his mask from his face.</p><p>“Stupefy!” yelled Hermione, who had just caught up with them.</p><p>They watched in an odd sort of fascination as the Death Eater froze when the spell it in the center of his chest collapsing backward into the bell jar as thought it was nothing but a soap bubble.</p><p>Hermione summoned Harry’s wand throwing it back to him before they continued on.</p><p>***HP***HP***</p><p>Ron had no idea where they were when they crashed through a doorway. Ginny and Luna were bent over at the waist trying to alleviate the stitch in their sides from running.</p><p>”Bloody hell!” exclaimed Ron, “what do we do now?”</p><p>“We get the hell out of here” said Ginny with a determined look on her face.</p><p>“We need to keep moving,” Luna advised just as fours figures came rushing towards them.</p><p>“This way!” Ginny shouted running through a door to her left. Her feet leaving the floor.</p><p>The room was dark and full of planets. Luna looked around in fascination.</p><p>“Bloody Hell!” Ron exclaimed, “what kind of room is this?”</p><p>“It’s obviously a room to study Astronomy Ginny snapped has she floated by what she thought was the moon.</p><p>Luna gasp in horror when someone grabbed her foot. “Reducto!” she cried exploding the planet Pluto getting away. She could here the man screaming in pain releasing his grip on her leg. “Served him right,” she thought as her feet once again met the ground.</p><p>Ron pushed past Ginny as if swimming on air when he was struck by a spell that sent him into a state of confusion resulting in Ginny having to navigate through the strange room for the both of them.</p><p>It didn’t help that they still had three Death Eaters on their tail. “When they landed Ginny took more weight on her ankle then she should hearing it snap. She gritted her teeth against the pain urging Ron and Luna on when they crashed through another door falling.</p><p>There was a shout in a nearby room, then a crash and a scream. “Ron!” Harry yelled, turning quickly from the monstrous transformation taking place before them. “Ginny? Luna?”</p><p>“Harry!” Hermione screamed.</p><p>They ran halfway towards the direction they assumed the others were in before veering left when they spotted two more Death Eaters coming towards them.</p><p>“Collo---” began Hermione, but before she could complete the spell the door bust open again and the two Death Eaters came hurdling inside.</p><p>“Impedimenta!” yelled both Death Eaters knocking the three of them backwards off their feet.</p><p>Neville was thrown over the deck and disappeared from view, Hermione smashed into a bookcase and was promptly deluged in a cascade of heavy books, Harry slammed into the stone wall hitting his head causing tiny lights to burst in front of his eyes and for a moment he was too dizzy and bewildered to react.</p><p>“WE”VE GOT THEM!” yelled the Death Eater “IN THE OFFICE OFF ----”</p><p>“Silencio!” cried Hermione and the man’s voice was extinguished.</p><p>“Petrificus Totalus!” shouted Harry, watching the Death Eater fall face first at his feet.</p><p>“That had to hurt,” thought Harry.</p><p>But at that very moment the Death Eater that Hermione had silence threaten them made a slashing motion with his wand.</p><p>Harry watched in horror as a purple flame spell flew towards Hermione as if in slow motion. Hermione’s eyes were wide in surprise her mouth forming an o as she crumbled to the floor.</p><p>“Hermione!”</p><p>Harry fell to his knees beside her as Neville crawled rapidly toward her from under the desk. As soon as his head emerged Neville was struck by a Death Eater’s boot in the face breaking his wand and his nose.</p><p>Neville gave a howl of pain clutching his mouth and nose.</p><p>Dolohov grinned, with his free hand, he pointed from the prophecy in Harry’s hand, to himself, then at Hermione.</p><p>“Like you won’t kill us the moment I hand it over anyway!” said Harry.</p><p>“Don’d gib it to him!” implored Neville blood dripping from his nose and mouth down his chin.</p><p>Dolohov head turned in the direction of a loud crash.</p><p>“Petrificus Totalus!”</p><p>Running over to Hermione, Harry was relieved that she was still breathing.</p><p>“Neville were not far from the exit,” Harry whispered, “We’re right next to that circular room. I want you to get Hermione and yourself out. She needs medical attention and I fear the longer we wait the worse she will get.”</p><p>“Ob kay!” Neville sighed with the help of Harry he put Hermione’s limp form on his back carrying her as they left the room.</p><p>“My gran’s going to kill be,” said Neville thickly, blood spattering from his nose as he spoke, “dat was by dad’s old wand…”</p><p>Neville was nervous when they entered the circular room, his only thoughts were on the exit. It was a surprise to both of them when a door opened for them.</p><p>Harry sighed when he looked through finding the hallway leading back to the stairs to level nine.</p><p>“Go on mate!” said Harry, “use the floo in the atrium to get back to Hogwarts. I think the infirmary would be the best place to go.”</p><p>Neville nodded making his way slowly up the stairs, in his hand was Hermione’s wand. He hoped that he didn’t run into anymore Death Eaters on his way to the lifts.</p><p>Once in the lift Neville breathed a sigh of relief. “Not much farther Hermione,” he whispered to the unconscious girl.</p><p>The atrium much to Neville’s delight was empty making sure to hold on tight to Hermione he called out Hogwarts infirmary and the pair disappeared through the floo network falling from the fire place onto the infirmary floor.</p><p>Neville moaned in pain when his knees crashed onto the stone floor from Hermione’s added weight on his back.</p><p>Pomfrey came running at the noise, “what on earth?” she gasped seeing two students one unconscious and the who looked as if his nose was broken from the amount of blood pouring from it and seemed he had a few of his front teeth missing.</p><p>“On the bed with you,” she ordered levitating Hermione onto one of the beds.</p><p>Neville sat on the bed nearest to Hermione worried about her. He didn’t know what the spell that hit her did but it couldn’t have been good.</p><p>Pomfrey first stopped the bleeding to his nose, healing it with a flick of her wand. Neville felt the bone snap back in place as if it was never broken a few moments before.</p><p>His eyes watered from the sharp pain. “Okay Mr. Longbottom I need you to rinse your mouth out with this before I can give you something to repair your teeth.” Pomfrey ordered.</p><p>Neville swish the solution around in his mouth spitting it into the pan he was handed.</p><p>It was then Pomfrey noticed the cut above his right eye. She silently cleaned the wound before whispering another spell that knitted his skin back together leaving the area pink.</p><p>Pomfrey poured the correct measure of potion to regrow his teeth before handing it to Neville.</p><p>“Now young man, care to explain your injuries?” asked Pomfrey as she went to Hermione’s bedside changing her into pajamas before starting her scans.</p><p>Neville begin telling about their trip to the ministry and how he and Hermione were hurt while explaining that Harry made him return with Hermione because they didn’t know what she was hit with.</p><p>“What can you tell me about the spell?” asked Pomfrey.</p><p>“It was purple in color and look almost like a flame of some sort,” said Neville worried about his friends who were still at the ministry.</p><p>Pomfrey paled before rushing from the room throwing floo powder into the fire place “Severus Snape” she called out.</p><p>“Is there any particular reason you have plaguing me this late in the evening?” he questioned putting down the potions tome he was reading.</p><p>“I required you presence in the infirmary immediately,” she snapped removing her head from the infirmary. She couldn’t believe that anyone would use dark arts on children.</p><p>Snape stepped out of the fireplace a moment later.</p><p>“Come with me,” she insisted bringing him to where Hermione was laid.</p><p>“What are the diagnoses?” he questioned wondering what potions he would have to brew to fix this latest mess.</p><p>Mr. Longbottom say’s she was hit with a purple flaming spell. Snape walked over scanning Hermione for dark magic.</p><p>He knew the spell at once Dolohov was enamored with that spell. “Mrs. Granger was hit with an organ liquefying curse. Although it either wasn’t full strength or it wasn’t a direct hit.</p><p>“Thank Merlin for small mercies,” Pomfrey said wondering how much damage that Merlin awful curse had already done to the teen’s organs.</p><p>“I will have to go to my private stores to get the necessary potions to start her on the mend,” said Snape leaving with a flurry of his robes.</p><p>It was only a few minutes before he returned with the necessary potions. “I will have to brew more of course. Ms. Granger is looking a long recovery process possibly the entire summer,” Snape informed Pomfrey.</p><p>Pomfrey looked over at the young man, “you need to get some rest,” she ordered handing him a dreamless sleep potion. Neville drifted off to sleep his last thought on Harry being right about getting Hermione help before it was too late.</p><p>***HP***HP***</p><p>Harry closed the door to the circular room and the doors began to spin anew.<br/>
When it stopped Harry reached to try a different door when the door to his right opened and three people fell out.</p><p>“Harry!” said Ron giggling weakly, lurching forward; seizing the front of Harry’s robes and gazing at him with unfocused eyes.</p><p>“There you are….Ha ha ha…. You look funny, Harry you’re all messed up…”</p><p>Ron’s face was very white and something dark was trickling from the corner of his mouth.</p><p>“Ginny?” Harry said fearfully. “What happened?” But she just shook her head and slid down the wall into a sitting position, panting and holding her ankle.</p><p>The evening events were catching up to her and the pain in her ankle was becoming unbearable it was already swollen and several shades of purple. Ginny didn’t think her ankle could take much more pressure.</p><p>“I think her ankles broken, I heard something crack,” whispered Luna, who was bending over her and who alone, seemed to be unhurt.</p><p>A few whispered words from Luna and Ginny’s ankle was wrapped tightly with a white bandages. “It’s not much but it should help,” Luna informed her putting her wand back behind her ear.</p><p>“Thanks Luna,” Ginny hissed at the tightness of the badges but was able to apply more pressure to her foot.</p><p>“Harry we saw Uranus up close!” said Ron, still giggling feebly.</p><p>“Get it Harry? We saw Uranus--- ha ha ha---” A bubble of blood grew at the corner of Ron’s mouth and burst.</p><p>“Anyway, one of them grabbed my foot and I used the Reducto Curse and blew up Pluto in his face, but…” Luna gestured hopelessly at Ginny, who was breathing in a very shallow way, her eyes closed.</p><p>“And what about Ron?” said Harry fearfully, as Ron continued to giggle, still Hanging off the front of Harry’s robes.</p><p>“I don’t know what they hit him with,” said Luna sadly, “but he’s gone a bit funny we could hardly get him along at all.</p><p>“Harry,” said Ron, pulling Harry’s ear down to his mouth and still giggling weakly, “you know who this girl is, Harry? She’s Loony …. Loony Lovegood…. ha ha ha….”</p><p>“Why are you by yourself? Where are Hermione and Neville?” asked Ginny when she opened her eyes.</p><p>“Hermione and Neville are hopefully at Hogwarts said Harry. “Hermione was hit by a weird purple spell and fell unconscious. Neville was bleeding badly so I sent them back through the exit to get help.”</p><p> </p><p>“We’ve got to get out of here Luna can you help Ginny?” Harry asked.</p><p>“Yes,” said Luna sticking her wand behind her ear for safekeeping, putting her arm around Ginny’s waist and pulling her up.</p><p>“It’s only my ankle I can do it myself,” said Ginny.</p><p>Lucius stood against the wall under a delusionment charm watching them. He knew it wouldn’t be much longer before the order arrived if Longbottom managed to return to Hogwarts as Potter suggested.</p><p>“There they are!” Bellatrix shouted, stunning spells flew across the room at them.</p><p>Harry smashed his way through the door ahead flinging Ron unceremoniously from him ducking back to help Luna with Ginny.</p><p>“Colloportus!” shouted Harry sealing the doorway before three bodies slammed into the door on the other side.</p><p>“It doesn’t matter” they heard a male voice saying. “There are other ways in.”</p><p>Harry spun around. They were back in the Brain Room and, sure enough, there were doors all around the walls. He could hear footsteps in the hall behind them as more Death Eaters came running to join them.</p><p>“Luna----- Ginny Help me!”</p><p>The three of them tore around the room, sealing the doors as they went. Harry crashed into a table and rolled over the top of it in his haste to reach the next door.</p><p>“Colloportus!”</p><p>Just as Harry reached the top of the room, he heard Luna dry, “Collo----aaaaaaaaargh…”</p><p>He turned in time to see her flying through the air. Five Death Eaters were surging into the room through the door she had not reached in time. Luna hit a desk, slide over its surface and onto the floor on the other side where she lay sprawled as still as Hermione.</p><p> </p><p>“Get Potter!” shrieked Bellatrix, and she ran after him. Harry dodged her and sprinted back up the room; he was safe as long as they thought he had the prophecy. Even Neville wasn’t aware that Harry had slipped the prophecy in his robe pocket. What he had in his hand was a transfigured sphere that looked like the prophecy even down to the little tag with Voldemort and his name listed.</p><p>Harry pushed the thought of McGonagall awarding points for his perfect replica of the prophecy.</p><p>“Hey!” said Ron, who had staggered to his feet and was now tottering drunkenly toward Harry, giggling. “Hey, Harry, there are brains in here, ha ha ha, isn’t that weird, Harry?”</p><p>“Ron get out of the way, get down--” But Ron had already pointed his wand at the tank.</p><p>“Honest, Harry, they’re brains---look---“Accio Brain!”</p><p>The scene seemed momentarily frozen. Harry and Ginny and each of the Death Eaters turned in spite of themselves to watch the top of the tank as a brain burst from the green liquid like a leaping fish. For a moment it seemed suspended in midair, then it soared toward Ron, spinning as it came, and what looked like ribbons of moving images flew from it, unraveling like rolls of film---</p><p>“Ha ha ha, Harry, look at it---” said Ron, watching it disgorge its gaudy innards. “Harry come and touch it, bet its weird---”</p><p>“RON NO!”</p><p>Harry did not know what would happen if Ron touched the tentacles of thought now flying behind the brain, but he was sure it would not be anything good. He darted forward but Ron had already caught the brain in his outstretched hands.</p><p>The moment they made contact with his skin, the tentacles began wrapping themselves around Ron’s arms like ropes.</p><p>“Harry, look what’s happen---no---no I don’t like it---no, stop---stop---” But the thin ribbons were spinning around Ron’s chest now. He tugged and tore at them as the brain was pulled tight against him like an octopus’ body.</p><p>“Diffindo!” yelled Harry, trying to sever the feelers wrapping themselves tightly around Ron before his eyes, but they would not break.</p><p>“Harry, it’ll suffocate him!” screamed Ginny, immobilized by her broken ankle on the floor—then a jet of red light flew from one of the Death Eaters wands and hit her squarely in the face. She keeled over sideways and lay there unconscious.</p><p>Lucius entered unnoticed by either party watching in horrified fascination as the youngest Weasley boy summoned a brain from a tank filled with green murky looking liquid.<br/>
It was clear to Lucius that the boy had been hit with some form of a confusion hex from the way he was acting.</p><p>Harry was now the only one standing. He seemed to move like liquid as he avoided the Death Eaters spells yelling out spells of his own.</p><p>Bellatrix fell through a door when she was hit with a particularly nasty blasting hex from Harry’s wand. Rodolphus however was taken down by a simple “Petrificus Totalus.”</p><p>“Pathetic,” thought Lucius as he watched the boy keep any of his compatriots from gaining access to the prophecy that he still held tightly in his hand.</p><p>Harry leaned against the wall when he realized that he defeated five Death Eaters on his own.</p><p>Harry first walked over to Ron trying unsuccessfully to remove the tentacles of the brain from his body. Without out much thought Harry used a water summoning spell hoping the water would draw the brain from his body. It was a slow process but the more water that poured from his wand the looser the tentacles became until the brain lay beside him. Harry banished it back into the tank before spelling the water from the floor. Ron’s face was contorted with pain from the pressure that was around his torso.</p><p>Harry quickly revived both Ginny and Luna, “Listen you guys get Ron out of here?” said Harry, his only thoughts on his friends’ safety.</p><p>“We aren’t leaving you Harry!” shouted Ginny.</p><p>“I’ll be alright,” said Harry, not wanting his friends to know how truly scared he was.</p><p>“It’s me they want, I will draw them away from you guys. Just go back into the circular room and think of the exit and the correct door will open for you,” Harry said standing once more.</p><p>Luna placed Ron’s arm around her shoulder helping him stand. He was still completely out of it. Harry watched as they walked out of the room towards the circular room before he took a door heading away to give them a chance of getting away.</p><p> </p><p>Luck however wasn’t with them, they were spotted as they entered the circular room by three death eaters.</p><p>Harry once again ended up in the room with the strange arch way. He could still hear the faint voices whispering beyond it. Harry climbed the stairs to the dias walking over to the arch way walking around it. It was the most peculiar thing he’d ever seen.</p><p>Lucius made his presence known, “you need to smash the prophecy Mr. Potter. We don’t have much time, before we are found. You need to hear it.”</p><p>Harry didn’t want Lucius Malfoy to know that, what he held in his hand was merely glass nothing more. No ghostly image would rise from its shattered pieces as they had done in the hall of prophecy.</p><p>They were interrupted however when Bellatrix appeared with the others three of them holding Luna, Ginny and Ron.</p><p>“Give us the prophecy boy,” Bellatrix ordered as all of his friends were being held by deatheaters.</p><p>“ Let them go!” Harry shouted.</p><p>“Crucio” hissed Bellatrix with vicious glee, Ginny’s body twisted unbearably as her nerves were hit with a burning sensation from the curse. Her screams caused the hair to raise on Harry’s arms. His heart beating harshly in his chest as he began to consider her demands.</p><p>Hurt didn’t it she asked licking the tears from Ginny’s face. “That’s just a teaser!” said Bellatrix, raising her wand. “Last time the prophecy” Bellatrix hissed nodding her head this time another deatheater hissed the spell.</p><p>Ron was completely unaware by this point. Blood bubbles still grew and burst at the corner of his mouth, while his still unfocused. He would giggle to himself every so often still under the heavy influence of whatever curse they hit him with.</p><p>Luna’s face held a blank expression, as tears fell down her face, but her eyes told of plans for revenge if they survived this encounter.</p><p>“Don’t give it too them,” Ginny screamed through her tears her throat raw from screaming, her body trembling from the force of her jerking movements.</p><p>As if in slow motion spells began raining down on them from the entrance. Harry quickly ducked out of the line of fire.</p><p>The Order had arrived. Sirius, Lupin, Moody, Tonks and Kingsley ran down the stairs engaging the Death Eaters in battle.</p><p>Ginny was dropped by the Death Eater holding her as he was forced to defend himself. She lay curled into herself on the stairs much like Ron and Luna moaning in pain from her abrupt contact with the stone stairs.</p><p>Lucius disappeared through a side door unnoticed by anyone making his escape. Although things did not go according to plan, the Dark Lord was still without the details of the prophecy that tied him and the Potter boy together.</p><p>Harry dived off the dias to duck a spell sent in his direction.</p><p>Through the darting bodies and flashes of light, Harry could see Luna crawling over towards Ron.</p><p>“Are you okay?” he yelled, as another spelled soared inches over their heads making his way towards her.</p><p>“Yes,” said Luna, trying to pull Ron in a sitting position. Harry gasp startled as the floor between them exploded as a spell hit it, leaving a crater right where Luna’s hand had been seconds before.</p><p>They both paled at the thought of nearly having their arms blown off by that spell if the crater in the floor was anything to go by.</p><p>Both scrambled away from the spot, and then a thick arm came out of nowhere, seized Harry around the neck and pulled him upright, so that his toes were barely touching the floor.</p><p>“Give it to me,” growled a voice in his ear, “give me the prophecy---’</p><p>The man was pressing so tightly on Harry’s windpipe that he could not breathe—through watering eyes he saw Sirius Dueling with a Death Eater some ten feet away. Kingsley was fighting two at once; Tonks, still half way up the tiered seats, was firing spells down at Bellatrix---nobody seemed to realize that Harry was dying…He turned his wand backward toward the man’s side, but had no breath to utter an incantation, and the man’s free hand was groping towards the hand in which Harry was grasping the prophecy---</p><p>Luna came lunging out of nowhere, Unable to articulate a spell due to anger, she just jabbed her wand hard into the eye hole of the Death Eater’s mask. The man relinquished his hold on Harry at once with a howl of pain.</p><p>The man keeled over backwards and his mask slipped off revealing the man’s identity. Harry paled He worked for the ministry. It was Macnair, Buckbeak’s would be killer, one of his eyes were now swollen and bloodshot.</p><p>“Thanks!” Harry said to Luna, pulling her aside as Sirius and his Death Eater lurched passed, dueling so fiercely that their wands were blurs.</p><p>Harry slipped and for a moment he thought he had drop the sphere, but then spotted Moody’s magic eyes spinning away across the floor. The man was lying on his side, bleeding from the head and his attacker was now bearing down upon Harry and Luna.</p><p>“Tarantallegra!” he shouted, his wand pointing at Luna, whose legs went immediately into a kind of frenzied tap dance, unbalancing her and causing her to fall to the floor again.</p><p>“Now, Potter---” He made the same slashing movement with his wand that he had used on Hermione just as Harry yelled, “Portego!”</p><p>Harry felt something streak across his face like a blunt knife but the force of it knocked him sideways, and he fell over Luna’s jerking legs.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” Harry yelled over the noise, before quickly removing the spell. Luna breathed a sigh of relief when her tired legs stilled on the floor.</p><p>Dolohov raised his wand again. “Accio Proph--”</p><p>Sirius hurled out of nowhere, rammed Dolohov with his shoulder, and sent him flying. Now Sirius was dueling Dolohov, their wands flashing like swords, sparks flying from their wand tips.</p><p>Dolohov again pulled back is wand making the slashing movement with his wand. Springing up Harry yelled, “Petrificus Totalus!”</p><p>Sirius laughed when Dolohov body seized up, “Good one Harry,” he shouted giving Harry and cheeky grin as he rushed off to assist Kingsley who was dueling his cousin Bellatrix and her husband Rodolphus.</p><p>A quick blasting spell from Sirius wand sent Juggins flying across the room, where he lay motionless.<br/>
Bellatrix spotting her cousin rushed up the stairway to escape, sending spells over her shoulder. Her eyes lit up with glee when she spotted the Weasley chit standing moving towards the Potter brat and his friend.<br/>
“Sectumsempra!” she cried sending the spell at Ginny.</p><p>Harry and Luna had finally managed to get Ron out of the line of the various spells flying about the room.</p><p>“Ginny look out!” Harry screamed, from where he was standing. As if in slow motion she was hit by a spell from Bellatrix who was running towards the stairs to escape. Ginny fell to the ground as if in slow motion the expression on her face was one of painful horror. Ginny moaned in pain as her shirt steadily became soaked with her blood. Her eyes filled with tears flowing on her face as she moaned and gasped in pain unable to move beyond the deep cuts cross her body from her upper chest to just before her navel.</p><p>In his rush to get to her side Harry dropped the small glass globe where it smashed on the stairs. Dropping to his knees, “Shhh don’t try to talk,” he urged, holding her to his body trying to stop the flow of blood.</p><p>Luna quickly followed him sitting on the opposite side from Harry, running her trembling fingers through her thick dark red hair.</p><p>“Somebody help me please!” Harry screamed, from where he sat on the ground holding Ginny in his arms. Her blood soaking through his clothing. Tonks being the closest headed over trying to aid him.</p><p>Lay her down Harry Tonks urged as she began casting spells trying to save Ginny’s life. The more Tonks cast the more she became frantic. “Why aren’t they working?” she cried, casting more spells not giving up hope; never giving up hope that she would be able to save the young witch.</p><p>“Tonks its okay,” Ginny smiled faintly, “tell my parents and my brothers I love them” said Ginny her voice gurgling as she grew weaker; tears leaking from her eyes.<br/>
“Don’t give up Ginny,” Tonks urge as she continued to cast spells of healing.</p><p>“Shh you’re going to be fine,” Harry assured her as he held her hand trying his best to keep her calm. “Just stay with me.”</p><p>“You’re going to be fine,” said Luna her eyes sparkling with tears, her fingers never stopped their movements. She wished in her heart it were true but Ginny had already lost a dangerous amount of blood.</p><p>Tonks tried all the healing spells she knew as tears fell down her face. Her hands trembling trying her best to save Arthur Weasley’s little girl.</p><p>Ginny smiled at him, “I love you Harry,” she said, before her eyes drifted shut and her breathing stopped.</p><p>Tonks covered her mouth as her body heaved as she sobbed into her hands tears clouded her vision as she tried to come to terms with the death of one so young.</p><p>Harry let out a heart retching scream his body shook from the force of his sobs holding her tight against his frame. “NO!” he screamed not caring who saw him crying.</p><p>Bellatrix cackled with glee from the top of the stairs. “Did you love her baby Potter?”</p><p>“YOU PSYCHOTIC BITCH, YOU KILLED GINNY!” roared Harry anger blazing in his eyes, “AND I’M GOING TO KILL YOU.”</p><p>“HARRY NO!” Sirius yelled but was unable to prevent Harry from running from the room.</p><p>Harry ran from the room behind her not caring that he could be running to his death. All that matter was that he didn’t allow Bellatrix to live.</p><p>Harry ran back towards the spinning room as Bellatrix disappeared through the door. Harry ran on entering the room his only thought was on finding Ginny’s killer that the correct door appeared for him.</p><p>Running through the door way he spotted her getting running up the stairs towards the main door to the department of mysteries heading towards the lifts. Harry refused to allow her to get away. He would kill her if it was the last thing he did.</p><p>Jumping in the other lift Harry took it back to the atrium before exiting where he spotted Bellatrix running again.<br/>
“Crucio” Harry bellowed knocking her off her feet. Bellatrix shrieked in pain but the spell wasn’t held long enough to do much damage.</p><p>“Self righteous anger will not fuel a unforgivable boy. You have to mean it” Bellatrix scolded. “I can teach you? I know spells you can only dream about. Give me the prophecy.”</p><p>“It smashed on the stairs when I went to help Ginny. Now no one will ever know what it says tell your master that,” he taunted.</p><p>“You lie give it to me,” she screamed. Harry laughed a sick sort of laugh.<br/>
“Crucio” she cried and he was forced to duck down again. “Give me the prophecy rolled it out towards me now and I may spare your life.”</p><p>“Well you are going to have to kill me because it’s gone and he knows you all failed,” Harry said with a mad sort of laugh like Bellatrix. “Your dear old mate Voldemort knows it’s gone. He’s not going to be Happy with you is he?”</p><p>“What?” what do you mean?” she cried and for the first time there was fear in her voice.</p><p>“What do you think Voldemort will say about that then?” Harry taunted the demented woman pressing his hand to his scar as it burned enough to water his eyes.</p><p>“LIAR YOU’VE GOT IT POTTER AND YOU WILL GIVE IT TO ME ____”</p><p>Harry laughed again knowing it would incense her, the pain building in his head so badly he thought his skull might burst. He waved an empty hand from behind the one eared goblin and withdrew it quickly as she sent another jet of green light flying at him.</p><p>“No!” she screamed. “It isn’t true, you’re lying ___ MASTER I TRIED, I TRIED ____ DO NOT PUNISH ME ___”</p><p>“Don’t waste your breath!” yelled Harry, his eyes screwed up against the pain in his scar, now more terrible then ever. “ He can’t hear you from here!”</p><p>“Can’t I Potter?” said a high, cold voice. Tall, thin and black hooded, his terrible snakelike face white and gaunt, his scarlet slit pupiled eyes staring. Lord Voldemort had appeared in the middle of the hall, his wand pointing at Harry who stood frozen, quite unable to move.</p><p>“You smashed my prophecy?” said Voldemort softly, staring at Harry with those pitiless red eyes. “No, Bella, he is not lying….. I see the truth looking at me from within his worthless mind…. Months of preparation, months of effort….. And my Death Eaters have let Harry Potter thwart me again…..”</p><p>“Master, I am sorry, I knew not, I was fighting the Animagus Black!” sobbed Bellatrix, flinging herself down at Voldemort’s feet as he paced slowly nearer.</p><p>“Fleeing more like it,” thought Harry in anger.</p><p>“Master you should know ____”</p><p>“Be quiet Bella,” said Voldemort dangerously. “Do you think I have entered the Ministry of Magic to hear your sniveling apologies? I shall deal with you in a moment.”</p><p>“But Master ___ he is here ---- he is below”</p><p>Voldemort paid no attention. “I have nothing more to say to you, Potter,” he said quietly. “ You have irked me too often, for too long. Voldemort hissed out a spell that Harry had never heard of. He stood transfixed as the blue light headed towards him.</p><p>The headless golden statue of the wizard in the fountain sprung to life, leaping from its plinth. And landed on the floor with a crash between Harry and Voldemort. The spell merely glanced off its chest as the statue flung out its arms, protecting Harry.</p><p>“What---?” said Voldemort, staring around. And then he breathed, “Dumbledore!”</p><p>Dumbledore stood in front of the golden gates.</p><p>Voldemort sent a green light from his wand at Dumbledore, who turned and was gone in a whirling of his cloak; next second he had reappeared behind Voldemort and waved his wand towards the remnants of the fountain; the other statues sprang to life too.</p><p>The statue of the witch ran at Bellatrix, who screamed and sent spells streaming uselessly off its chest. Before it dived at her, pinning her to the floor.</p><p>Mean while the goblin and the house elf scuttled toward the fire places set along the wall. And the one-arm centaur galloped at Voldemort. Who vanished and reappeared beside the pool.</p><p>“It was foolish of you to come here tonight, Tom,” said Dumbledore calmly. “The Aurors are on their way----”</p><p>“By which time I shall be gone and you dead!” spat Voldemort. He sent another killing curse at Dumbledore but missed instead hitting the security guard’s desk, which burst into flames.</p><p>Dumbledore flicked his own wand. The force of the spell that emanated from it was such that Harry. Though shielded by his stone guard, felt his hair stand on end as it passed, and this time Voldemort was forced to conjure a shining silver shield out of thin air to deflect it.</p><p>“You do not wish to kill me, Dumbledore?” called Voldemort, his scarlet eyes narrowed over the top of the shield. “Above such brutality, are you?”</p><p>“But didn’t he kill Grindewald?” thought Harry confused. “Why would Voldemort suggest that the man everyone magical feared before Voldemort’s reign of terror was still alive?”</p><p>“We both know there are ways of destroying a man, Tom” Dumbledore said calmly, continuing to walk toward Voldemort as though he had not a fear in the world, as though nothing had happened to interrupt his stroll up the hall.</p><p>“Merely taking your life would not satisfy me, I admit---”</p><p>“There is nothing worse than death, Dumbledore!” snarled Voldemort.</p><p>“You are quite wrong,” said Dumbledore, still closing in upon Voldemort speaking as lightly as though they were discussing the matter over drinks.<br/>
“Indeed, your failure to understand there are things much worse than death has always been your greatest weakness.”</p><p>Harry swallowed thickly in fear, as the one arm centaur shattered into a hundred pieces, but before the fragments had even hit the floor, Dumbledore had drawn back his wand and waived it as thought brandishing a whip.</p><p>Harry watched Dumbledore, as the two powerful men sent spell after spell at each other. Again Voldemort sent the killing curse at Dumbledore however a flash of flame appeared before him swallowing the green lit spell, bursting into flames. The ashes falling into a small pile where a baby phoenix was reborn.</p><p>“Fawkes,” thought Harry relieved that Dumbledore had once again avoided being killed. Harry’s attention was drawn away from the duel to the fireplaces lighting up green, the Aurors had finally arrived, with Fudge no less.</p><p>“Dumbledore!” gasped Fudge seeing the older man dueling against a man he refused to believe was once more living among them.</p><p>“Stay back,” Dumbledore called out, not wanting anyone to step into the line of fire, his spell currently had Voldemort surrounded in a large bubble of water but at that moment, Voldemort disapparated from the hall causing the water to fall with a great splash back into the destroyed statue of brethren.</p><p>Instead of walking over to explain the particulars of the evenings events Dumbledore walked towards Harry.</p><p>“Are you alright Harry?” asked Dumbledore. Harry’s mouth opened in closed several times before he settled on nodding that he was okay. Harry’s body was shaking so violently he could not hold his head up properly.</p><p>The atrium was now full of people.</p><p>“Let’s get you back to Hogwarts,” Dumbledore said placing a portkey into Harry’s hand activating it returning him to Hogwarts.</p><p>“MERLINS’ BEARD! He was there!” Fudge exclaimed pale at the sight of the man they all feared.</p><p>Many other ministry employees saw Voldemort as well. There was no denying he was present among them once more.</p><p>“If you proceed to the death room within the Department of Mysteries you should find several death eaters held under a binding spell,” Dumbledore informed the Aurors.</p><p>Fudge paled further that the thought of Death Eaters within the ministry. How had they all gotten in. “Was that Potter?” he questioned walking towards Dumbledore.</p><p>“What on earth was the boy doing here?” he questioned, “Now see here Dumbledore you can’t do things like that in front of the Minister of Magic you __ you”</p><p>His voice faltering as Dumbledore surveyed him magisterially over his half-moon spectacles.</p><p>“You will give the order to remove Delores Umbridge from Hogwarts,” Dumbledore said. “You will tell your Aurors to stop searching for my Care of Magical Creatures professor so that he can return to work. I will give you….” Dumbledore pulled a watch with twelve hands from his pocket and surveyed it, “half an hour of my time tonight, in which I think we shall be more than able to cover the important points of what has happened here.”</p><p>** Meanwhile earlier at Hogwarts**</p><p>Snape remained in the infirmary and was there to assist Pomfrey when Luna, Ron, Sirius and Lupin exited the floo. The Latter carrying the pale bloody body of the youngest Weasley.</p><p>Luna assisted Ron who was still weakly giggling towards one of the beds near where Hermione and Neville both lay.</p><p>Pomfrey came rushing towards them.</p><p>Snape directed Luna over to him where he scanned her for injuries. On first glance one would think that she was uninjured but he found, she had three broken ribs and had shattered the bones in her upper arm he wondered how she managed use of the arm at all.</p><p>Working in silence, Snape banished the bones in her arm before giving her skeletal grow and dreamless sleep after spelling her into pajamas.</p><p>Pomfrey worked in frantic silence trying to get Ron stable reversing the spells he was hit with before healing his injuries although she was unable to find a reason behind the deep groves in the body’s arm and upper torso.</p><p>Snape walked over to Remus where he placed the youngest Weasley on a bed covering her with a sheet.</p><p>“What are her injuries?” questioned Snape so he would know what he was dealing with.</p><p>“She’s beyond our help,” said Remus his expression deeply troubled by the night’s events.</p><p>Snape removed the sheet, his eyes scanned the dead body of the youngest Weasley, swallowing back a curse he cleared the blood from her face and hair before banishing her clothing spelling her into pajamas. It wouldn’t do for her mother to see her in her current state.</p><p>***HP***HP***</p><p>Harry was in a state of shock when Dumbledore activated the portkey. He appeared moments later in the infirmary his hands and clothes soaked in Ginny’s blood, his face pale, a large cut on his head near his famous scar which was inflamed red and leaking blood.</p><p>The only thing primarily in his thoughts was Ginny’s death and how he couldn’t kill the one person who responsible for her death. “How was he going to kill someone like Voldemort?”</p><p>Pomfrey rushed to his side, Harry wanted to tell her what was wrong but no words would come. His heart just felt an insurmountable amount of pain.</p><p>He didn’t notice Snape, Lupin nor Sirius presence as he was led over to what was known as his bed, because his constant visits to the infirmary.</p><p>Pomfrey returned to her office to get more supplies before she was joined by Snape at his bed.</p><p>Harry whole body shook with force from trauma of the nights events. Snape couldn’t help to wonder what horrors the students faced at the hands of the Dark Lord’s followers.</p><p>Pomfrey scan showed Harry had broken all of his ribs, his left arm was fractured in three different places and had damaged his rotator cuff. The huge lump at the back of his head proved her theory of a concussion while the amount of blood on his face revealed not only a nasty looking cut but his scar was swollen and inflamed.</p><p>Snape handed him an extra strength calming draught the boy was not far from going into shock.</p><p>Pomfrey whispered a spell and bands of medical gauze wrapped tightly around his upper torso before pouring the correct amount of skeletal grow needed to help mend his injured bones.</p><p>The rotator cuff was easier to fix however it would take about a week before he would have full use of it again.</p><p>“Dreamless sleep will have to wait I’m sure Dumbledore will want to speak with you before I dose you,” Pomfrey informed him.</p><p>Harry didn’t reply he just closed his eyes waiting for the tight feeling to leave his chest. He thought for sure his lungs would collapse from the pressure.</p><p>Sirius rushed over to his godson’s side, Remus sat at the foot of the bed, his hand on Harry’s ankle offering his silent support.</p><p>They only waited a few minutes more before Dumbledore made his presence known; walking over to Harry he sat before the bed.</p><p>Harry wanted to pretend to be sleeping but knew that he would have to answer their questions one way or the other.</p><p>“First, Mr. Potter, I would like to know the location of Delores Umbridge,” said Dumbledore.</p><p>Sirius pulled him gently to rest against his larger frame wrapping his arm around his waist.</p><p>“Just take your time, Harry, we are here to help you,” Remus assured him.</p><p>Harry thought about what occurred in Umbridge’s office before they made their escape to the ministry to save Sirius.</p><p>Harry began slowly his voice thick with emotion, “I’m not sure if I fell asleep or if it was a vision, but I was sitting my History of Magic exam. When I was released from it my scar was burning so much that it felt as if my head would split open.</p><p>The examiner Toffey I think his name was---” “Tofty,” Dumbledore correctly gently.</p><p>“He wanted me to come here but I refused making an excuse that I had just fallen asleep.”</p><p>“After exams were over I spoke with Ron and Hermione about my vision. Hermione wanted us to find a professor and get help, but McGonagall wasn’t there and the other professors had enough to deal with trying to protect their jobs and the students without Umbridge finding out.”</p><p>“Hermione again insisted that we at least try to make sure what I saw was true. So we broke into Umbridge’s office to use her fireplace because she had all the other fireplaces monitored for any activity, not to mention the mail.”</p><p>“Umbridge didn’t want the students writing home to their parents about her unprofessional and illegal practices here at Hogwarts,” Harry continued.</p><p>“What illegal practices,” interrupted Snape, “I was under the impression that the students were given lines to write,” said Snape a calculating expression on his face.</p><p>“Professor Umbridge, was torturing students during detentions. She has a special quill that doesn’t require you to use ink. Whatever she assigns the student to write it carves the words into the back of your hand,” answered Harry not looking up from where his hand covered the scar with the words “I must not tell lies” carved into it.</p><p>“WHAT!” screamed Snape, Lupin and Sirius at the same time, much to the amazement of Dumbledore, whose eyes narrowed at the thought to a blood quill being used on his students.</p><p>“Continue Mr. Potter” Dumbledore urged, before briefly calling a house elf to search Umbridge’s office and private rooms for the illegal quill.</p><p>“I used Umbridge’s floo to contact Sirius at Grimauld Place but Kreacher said that he wasn’t there, that he hadn’t been there for hours,” said Harry wanting to explain.</p><p>“Kreacher was able to lie to you because you aren’t his master,” Remus answered gently.</p><p>“Now I know where Kreacher has been disappearing too,” thought Sirius glad that he’d killed the little nuisance. Part of him wished he’d done more than sever that demented creatures head from its body.</p><p>“Before we could escape undetected Umbridge caught us in her office. She admitted to sending the Dementors to Surrey that attacked me and Dudley. She even admitted to using veritaserum on the students during detentions. She threatened to use the cruciatus curse on me if I didn’t tell her where you and Sirius were hiding,” Harry admitted looking at Dumbledore then Sirius wanting them to understand.</p><p>“Hermione, told her that Fudge wouldn’t uphold her using unforgivables on the students. Umbridge however said that Fudge would understand the measures she had to take to get the information they needed. She then fire called Snape and requested more veritaserum.”</p><p>“Professor Snape,” said Dumbledore gently reminding the young man to use proper titles.</p><p>Harry wanted to roll his eyes but instead he just continued talking as if Dumbledore hadn’t said anything.</p><p>“Professor Snape told Umbridge that only three drops would suffice to question students but she had already used a whole bottle, trying to find out where the DA were meeting and how we got the word out to everyone.”</p><p>“You gave that prejudice evil shrew veritaserum?” Sirius questioned Snape with a look of disgust on his face.</p><p>“Of course not; don’t be daft it was simply distilled water. I would never jeopardize the students of this school,” snapped Snape, “She already had veritaserum Salazar only knows where she’d gotten it from. She threatened to have me brought up on charges against the ministry for treason if I hadn’t complied.”</p><p>Harry continued after they quieted, “Hermione lied to Umbridge about Dumbledore. She told Umbridge that Dumbledore had us completing a weapon that was hidden in the forbidden forest.”</p><p>“Knowing that Hagrid’s brother Grawp was now living in the forest,” Dumbledore added.</p><p>Harry nodded, “we led Umbridge into the forest but we were found by the Centaurs. “They were so angry that we were in the forest, it didn’t help matters that Umbridge began insulting them, calling them mindless beast and said that they should all be put down calling them half bred abominations.”</p><p>“She didn’t!” gasped Remus pale, centaurs were a proud magical beings and to insult them in such a way could very well lead to the person’s death.</p><p>“That’s when Grawp came through the trees hearing people talking, thinking it was me, Ron and Hermione returning to talk with him. Hagrid had ask that we help to teach him to speak English.”</p><p>Snape’s face held a look of amazement that three fifteen year olds would attempt such a thing regardless of dangers being in the company of a giant presented. It gave him a glimpse of how selfless the three gryffindors could be even when they’re actions were more than foolish.</p><p>“Things became chaotic because the centaurs started attacking Grawp in fear that he would kill them. Grawp retaliated thinking they were harming us so he attacked them viciously. But that didn’t stop Umbridge from sprouting her hate propaganda threatening to have all of them brought before the ministry and executed. Bane wasn’t pleased at all and ordered her taken by one of the others and they rushed off through the trees with Grawp thundering steps following them.” Harry explained.</p><p>“Hermione and I made our way back through the forest when we reached the clearing Ron, Neville, Ginny and Luna were there. They had come to save us from Umbridge. Ron feared that we had been eaten by the one of the large spiders that has a den deep in the forest.”</p><p>“Pets of Hagrid,” Snape stated more then questioned.</p><p>Harry nodded without really thinking about it.</p><p>“I told them all to return to the castle but they refused. They said they couldn’t allow me to go to the ministry to save Sirius alone. Luna suggested we ride Threstals to the ministry. Only Luna and I could see them so we assisted the others with climbing on their backs before doing the same. We didn’t have a plan beyond the point of getting there and finding Sirius. I could still feel the backwash of pain from my scar, assuring me that although you were being tortured that you were still fighting,” said Harry looking up at Sirius for the first time since he began talking.</p><p>Harry continued with the story, telling them how they managed to find the hall of prophecy and how Neville was the one to explain to them why Harry was needed to retrieve it.</p><p>He went on to describe their battle with the Death Eaters and how he sent Neville away with Hermione after she had fell unconscious, while he went to find the others.</p><p>He explained Ron’s contact with the magical brain that was in a tank in one of the rooms that Harry deemed the Brain Room, he wasn’t sure if that was what the room was actually called or not.</p><p>Harry continued to recount the events of the night, when he reached the part of Ginny, dying and how Tonks wasn’t able to apply a stasis charm or anything that would help save her life. He explained how Ginny thanked Tonks and told her that everything was okay. She asked that her parents be told how much she loved them and how Harry and Luna held her hand, while Tonks, never gave up continuing to try healing spells.</p><p>Harry talked until his throat felt raw and dry. It was only then that he allowed Dumbledore to remove all the memories to include those of the detentions with the blood quill and the full account of the ministry incident that unfolded that night.</p><p>Pomfrey walked over smoothing down his blanket before pressing a dreamless sleep potion into his hand.</p><p>“Five minutes,” Sirius said wanting a few minutes alone with his godson.</p><p>“Five minutes and then I want you out of here. He needs rest not to be asked anymore questions,” Pomfrey ordered disappearing up the ward towards her office.</p><p>“I must meet with the Weasley’s,” Dumbledore sighed, he hated bringing families bad news.</p><p>“We will be up in a few minutes,” Sirius assured Dumbledore.</p><p>“You never opened my present from Yule did you?” Sirius questioned sadly.</p><p>“I just wanted to protect you,” said Harry softly Hermione and Ron convinced him that whatever it was it probably would be too risky to use.</p><p>“I’m not mad at you Harry. I just wished you had opened it. You would have never needed to go to the ministry. You would have known that I was fine,” Sirius sighed hugging his godson close.</p><p>They sat in silence Remus still sitting at the foot of the bed. What seemed all too soon Pomfrey returned urging them to let him rest.</p><p>Harry drank down the potion without complaint welcoming the silence of darkness that the dreamless sleep provided.<br/>
_________________________________</p><p>Sirius, Remus stepped from the floo into Dumbledore’s Office where Molly, Arthur, Bill, Charlie, Fred and George were waiting for them. Kingsley stood near the fireplace watching the family who refuse to wait to get their answers and Snape in a darkened corner. Molly had collapsed upon hearing of her daughter’s death. It had taken quite a bit of work between Arthur and their oldest Bill to get her to calm enough to listen to Kingsley.</p><p>Remus and Sirius headed over to where the Auror was standing.</p><p>“I thought you were gone to St Mungos,” Sirius said in greeting.</p><p>“No, I thought it best to inform Arthur and Molly about their daughter; as to be expected it wasn’t received very well,” Kingsley informed them.</p><p>“You’re in pain,” Sirius said worry clear in his voice. Sirius didn’t understand the warring emotions that he was having around the older man.</p><p>“I’ll be fine,” Kingsley ensured him as Dumbledore walked back over to his desk with the pensieve.</p><p>Dumbledore poked the substance with his wand the first memory unfolded for them all to see. Each subsequent memory showed the horrors that Harry faced Under Umbridge’s detentions as well as the visions he suffered through at the hands of Voldemort.</p><p>Nothing however prepared them for watching Ginny struck by curse that shredded her chest.</p><p>As the memories of the incident continued Bill couldn’t help but feel proud that his siblings stood up for what they believed in.</p><p>Dumbledore rubbed his hand along his nose, gathering his thoughts.</p><p>Molly collapsed against Arthur her body shook from the force of her tears. Seeing her daughter’s fate hadn’t made accepting it any easier. Dumbledore allowed the family time to grieve after viewing the memory before leading to the infirmary where Ginny’s remains were in one of the private rooms away from the other sleeping students.</p><p>Sirius and Remus however headed used the floo system to get back to headquarters. While Kingsley floo’ed to St. Mungos to be treated for his injuries.</p><p>Dumbledore led them to the infirmary, where he ushered them into the private room where their daughters’ remains lye. Ginny was dressed in standard issue infirmary pajamas. Her hair hung loose around her shoulders. Her face peaceful in death. Molly gently pressed a kiss to her daughter’s brow before running her fingers through her hair, so much like Arthurs in color.</p><p>Arthur stood a few steps away, drinking in the sight of his dead daughter. Her death was a harsh blow to the family. He knew he needed to remain strong in their time of grieving.</p><p>Bill however stood holding George to him, while Charlie held Fred, the twins was taking the death of their little sister very hard. They always spoiled Ginny when they could because she was the only girl.</p><p>Molly turned abruptly looking at Dumbledore, the anger at her daughters’ death finally overpowering her broken heart. “You told me my children would be protected.” She wanted to blame someone, anyone for the tremendous amount of pain she was feeling. Nothing could’ve ever prepared her for the death of any of her children.</p><p>“Molly dear please calm down,” Arthur tried urging his wife to calm before she said things that she would regret.</p><p>“I should’ve never listened to you,” she continued to yell at Dumbledore, “my baby would be safe if I hadn’t allowed you to manipulate me into looking for the boy in his first year. You promised that no harm would come to them.”</p><p>“Mrs. Weasley, you know as well as I that I wasn’t in a position to prevent tonight’s events from happening.” Dumbledore reminded her.</p><p>“Unable to prevent it from happening?” she questioned with a look of disbelief, “had you took the boy to retrieve the prophecy instead of having the order spending hours guarding the blasted entrance to the department of mysteries. This all could have been prevented.”</p><p>“Wasn’t Arthur getting hurt enough?” she snapped, “now my Ron is hurt and my……” her voiced trailed out in anguish… “Oh my precious baby.” Molly tears clouded her vision as she continued to gaze upon her youngest child. Dead far too soon for one so young.</p><p>Dumbledore sighed, he had dealt many times with grieving parents but Molly Weasley ne Prewett was too far in her despair that she wasn’t willing to listen to reason. “I did what I thought was best. I would like to extend you the honor of having Ginny buried in the cemetery on the grounds. Of course at no cost to your family”</p><p>“I’m not sure that’s such a good idea,” Arthur stated weary of accepting such charity.</p><p>“Did you offer the Diggory’s the same for their son?” Molly argued, thinking Dumbledore was only offering because her daughter’s death would look bad on the school.</p><p>“Cedric Diggory is buried here on the grounds,” Dumbledore answered “He and Ginny aren’t the first students to be buried here. Myrtle McCrae was found dead here over 50 years ago when the chamber of secrets was opened, I believe she haunts the female’s lavatory on the second floor. Hogwarts was Ginny’s home for the last four years and it would be honor for it to remain so.”</p><p>“It would be appreciated,” Arthur sighed, Ginny’s death would be hard on the family but this lessened the burden of having to figure out how they would pay to have her burial ceremony.</p><p>Molly sighed defeated but determined she refused to allow another of her children to be harmed in the war. “Mr. Potter is not to attend Ginny’s memorial service nor is he to have contact with either of my children while he remains at Hogwarts.”</p><p>Fred and George however protested, “Mum, you can’t, this isn’t Harry’s fault!” they cried. Bill and Charlie didn’t agree with their mother either but they understood her fear very much.</p><p>Molly had already lost her younger twin brothers to Voldemort and his henchmen she wasn’t going to lose anymore of her family.</p><p>Dumbledore feared this would happen in her grief Molly was laying the blame of her daughter’s death on the one person who has shouldered more then he should have too. “I will inform Mr. Potter of your wishes however I must ask that you not approach Mr. Potter on this matter. He’s had much to deal with this evening.”</p><p>He soon left the family to their grieving while he headed back to his office to finish his paperwork that he needed to forward to the ministry. He still needed to retrieve Madame Umbridge from the clutches of the centaurs but that could wait until morning he thought as he walked through the halls.</p><p>Molly sat at her daughter’s bedside tears falling silently down her face. It seemed as if she had aged in the short time since her daughter’s death was announced. She had no intentions of following Dumbledore’s request. That boy needed to be told the harsh reality of things. He couldn’t go around putting people in danger without thought and no consequences.</p><p>Harry woke to the silence of the hospital wing. His mind still foggy from the effects of the dreamless sleep potion he’d taken only hours before. After putting on his glasses he silently walked towards the bathroom down the ward. He knew Pomfrey was probably already aware that he was awake and it wouldn’t be long before she came to check on him. He was spotted by Mrs. Weasley has they exited one of the private rooms on his return towards his bed in the open ward.</p><p>It wasn’t until he was returning to his bed when he was startled by the loud voice of Molly Weasley.</p><p>“YOU!” Molly snapped, “HOW DARE YOU PUT MY CHILDREN IN DANGER. YOU RECKLESS, IMBECILIC FOOL.”</p><p>“Molly dear that completely uncalled for,” Arthur scolded her trying to get his wife to calm down and see reason, “You can’t blame Harry for our Ginny’s death.”</p><p>Snape walked down the ward towards loud voices. He had just left from checking on his slytherins.</p><p>“I CAN’T BELIEVE THAT LILY AND JAMES POTTER HAD SUCH AND ARROGANT LITTLE SHIT AS YOU FOR A CHILD. HOW DARE YOU BE ALIVE WHEN MY GINNY IS DEAD? IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN YOU NOT MY GINNY,” Molly screamed, “YOU SHOULD’VE DIED WITH YOUR PARENTS.”</p><p>“That will be quite enough,” Snape hissed his arms crossed, startling Molly Weasley out of her rage. He didn’t fail to notice that the more the Weasley matriarch took her anguish and hurt out on the boy, Potter seemed to retreat further into himself.</p><p>He could admit he didn’t care for the brat but even he wasn’t so cruel as to say the things this loud annoying woman had just shouted at the boy.</p><p>“What’s going on here?” Pomfrey questioned rushing into the area, “This is a hospital wing not a brothel. How dare you speak to a student in such a manner.”</p><p>“Mrs. Weasley, Headmaster Dumbledore gave your family permission to be in the castle however that does not give you the right to emotionally abuse a student,” Pomfrey scolded, so every word could hit their mark.</p><p>“Rest assured Dumbledore will be informed of your abuse towards Mr. Potter. Now either return to the rooms provided for your family or leave but you will not disturb my patients.”</p><p>Molly face was still filled with an unmitigated rage. How dare they tell her she was wrong for the way she felt.</p><p>Bill noticed that Harry wore tight bandages from chest to waist, he also pale and looked as if he were mentally, emotionally and physically exhausted.</p><p>“Mr. Potter you should be resting.” Snape said directing the smaller teen back towards his bed.</p><p>In the chaos of the shouting Harry hadn’t bothered to tell Snape that he only got up to use the facilities. Soon he was he once again in a restful sleep.</p><p>Snape wondered if the boy would even remember the altercation with the Weasley Matriarch or if he would think he’d dreamed it all.</p><p>__________________________</p><p> </p><p>The next morning Neville and Luna were released, while Ron and Hermione were held for an additional day for observation.</p><p>Harry however wasn’t released until the third day because he still hadn’t completely healed and Pomfrey wanted to monitor him further.</p><p>The morning of his release Harry returned to the gryffindor common room when he entered all talking stopped, everyone in the room were starring at him as if he would cause something to happen in their presence.</p><p>After spending five years in the tower Harry had learned to ignore the staring and the whispering. He quickly headed up the stairs towards the 5th year boy’s dorm. The room was completely trashed, Harry stood in complete horror at the destruction of his things.</p><p>Nothing was left. His books were ripped beyond repair all over the floor. His school assignments were torn up as well his ink bottles smashed and quills broken. The small trash can near his bed was still smoking of what he assumed was the remains of his beloved photo album; while all the gifts the Weasley’s had given him lay broken or cut up on his bed, on the wall behind it, were the words, “Friend Killer” and “Jinx”.</p><p>His trunk was covered in a red paint spells, words, like traitor, murderer, jinx and many, many more littered the trunk inside and out. His firebolt was where ever Umbridge had put it when he was banned from quidditch. So it wasn’t among the wreckage. He couldn’t help to feel grateful that Sirius had asked to borrow his cloak so it was safe. It was then he noticed that the marauder’s map wasn’t among his destroyed belongings which could only mean one thing. Whoever trashed his things now had the map.</p><p>“I don’t know who did it, but it only just happened in the last hour or so,” Neville offered as an explanation, he had entered the dorm room only moments before Harry arrived.</p><p>“I’m sorry this happened,” said Neville as he watched the light in Harry’s eyes disappear a bit more.<br/>
“It’s not your fault Neville,” said Harry quietly not really knowing what he should do.</p><p>“This wasn’t right Harry,” Neville replied looking around sadly, “Ginny’s death wasn’t your fault and neither was Cedric’s. They have no right to harass you in such a manner.”</p><p>Harry sighed wondering how much more he would have to take before people stopped blaming him for things beyond his control.</p><p>(Mean while in the common room)</p><p>Ron and Hermione sat in their usual seats near the fireplace with Dean and Seamus.</p><p>“It’s like Cedric Diggory all over again,” Dean mentioned, “We never were told exactly what happened in that grave yard last year.”</p><p>“Its like he’s a bad omen or something?” Seamus added, “The two of you are either very brave or stupid to still be friends with Potter. If I were you I would stay clear of him whose to say who will be next.</p><p>“He got my sister killed,” Ron snapped in anger, he didn’t know exactly how Ginny was killed but he knew it was Harry’s fault. If he would have listened to reason they all would have escaped with their lives. No the bloody git had to remove the prophecy from the shelf bringing the Death Eaters down on them.</p><p>Neither, Ron or Hermione was willing to admit that their own faults in the matter. It was easier to blame Harry for everything.</p><p>McGonagall entered the gryffindor tower to find the common room full walking over towards Potter’s friends. “Ms. Granger, Mr. Weasley, I will need to speak with you both in my office once I’m done with speaking with Mr. Potter. Have any of you seen Mr. Potter?” she questioned, Pomfrey had already released the boy from the infirmary.</p><p>“He’s upstairs Professor,” Colin Creevey informed her continuing his game of exploding snap with his brother Dennis.</p><p>“Wonder what she wants with us,” Ron said to Hermione.</p><p>“I don’t know Ronald it’s probably about our punishment for being out of bounds,” Hermione reminded him. She was sure that the 250 house points weren’t going to be their only punishment.</p><p>“Surely 250 point deduction is punishment enough,” said Ron worried about what kind of other punishment they could possibly be given.</p><p>“You all were out of bounds mate,” Seamus reminded him, “you all are very lucky not to be expelled.”</p><p>McGonagall headed for the stairs to check on Potter. Snape had informed her of the events that occurred since her hospitalization.</p><p>“Mr. Potter,” she called as she entered the 5th year boy’s dorm room her expression paled at the destruction in the room, the words in bright red paint on the wall was both horrifying and vindictive. She had never in all her days seen such blatant harassment and bullying. He and Neville turned looking in her direction.</p><p>“Are you injured Mr. Potter?” McGonagall questioned.</p><p>“No mam, I only just arrived to this,” he replied quietly. “Is this all your things thrown all over the floor?”</p><p>“Yes mam, this is Gryffindor’s way to saying they are displeased with my presence among them,” said Harry looking more withdrawn.</p><p>“Is there anything missing?”</p><p>“What hasn’t been cutup or burned has been thrown all over the place. I’m assuming the smoking trash can is the ashes of my photo album. Nothing was salvageable not even his trunk that was filled inside and out with words of hate.</p><p>He now only had the clothes that he was currently wearing, everything else had already been destroyed.</p><p>“Come with me Potter,” McGonagall stated leading him from the room and down the stairs into the common room.</p><p>“There will be a house meeting when I return everyone is to attend no exceptions. I have never in all my years working in this profession seen such acts of hate and bullying. When I find out who is responsible for this attack rest assured you will be expelled from Hogwarts,” McGonagall informed as she led Harry from the common room.</p><p>The walk to Dumbledore’s office was done in silence. Harry’s head was head down his eyes a little more sunken.</p><p>Dumbledore call for them to enter when they reached his door. “What can I do for you Minerva,” he questioned. “I expect you were informed about recent events.”</p><p>“Naturally I went to check on Mr. Potter, if you will come with me to Gryffindor Tower so that you may see the damage yourself,” she requested. Instead of walking back through the halls as Harry assumed they would, they took the floo from Dumbledore’s office stepping out into the gryffindor common room.</p><p>The students looked worried about Dumbledore being in the tower. It wasn’t normal to see McGonagall and she was their head of house. Ron and Hermione however looked defiant and even more angry then when they destroyed Harry’s belongings.</p><p>Neither wanted to admit that they were the cause of their own pain because Harry didn’t ask any of them to go with him to the ministry. He had planned to go by himself. He didn’t want to endanger anyone but they refused to listen.</p><p>Hermione didn’t want to admit that she felt a thrill at the prospect of another adventure like they had in first year and again during second year. Ron was much the same, he wanted the recognition of being the best friend of the boy who lived and thought the adventures they went on were scary but amazing as well.</p><p>Now that they experienced death in close quarters they wanted to blame Harry for everything.</p><p>When they entered the 5th year boy’s dorm, Dumbledore looked disheartened by the destructive display.</p><p>Nothing he could say would undo what Harry’s class mates had done to him.<br/>
With a wave of his wand Dumbledore banished the mess and the words from the wall.</p><p>His trunk was not destroyed however Dumbledore doubted Harry would use it any longer. Someone had used a paint spell to write hideous things on it. Dumbledore banished that as well.</p><p>“If you would follow me Mr. Potter, I fear that you are no longer safe among your house mates. You will be given private rooms else where,” Dumbledore explained. With a flick of his wand the room now contained only four beds.</p><p>Harry paused, “Hedwig!” he gasp, scared that they may have somehow harmed his pet. “I will ensure that she is safe,” McGonagall assured her charge. Harry nodded following Dumbledore from the room.</p><p>No one said anything as Harry was lead from the tower. The conversation started after the portrait closed.</p><p>The days following Harry’s removal from the tower; he wasn’t seen by anyone, there was speculation that he had been suspended. Some people even thought he had committed suicide.</p><p>The Diggory’s had been to Hogwarts to speak with Dumbledore about the recent events, wanting clarity on Potter’s involvement in Molly and Arthur’s daughter death.</p><p>Dumbledore assured them that Harry was in no way responsible for the death of Ginevra Weasley. Harry just was present when she was killed much like he was during Cedric’s death.</p><p>The slytherin’s were angry because their father’s were now imprisoned and everyone knew what Death Eater scum they were. Malfoy however was withdrawn and silent. The death of yet another pureblood student bothered him more than it should have. His father had always talked negatively about the Weasley family because they aligned themselves with Dumbledore.</p><p>Draco was all for purity of blood and keeping the family lines pure but he didn’t see why other pure blood families had to die because of their beliefs. What would stop death eaters from wiping out entire pure blood family lines?</p><p>The Gryffindors blamed Harry for Ginny’s death because of Ron and Hermione telling their version of what happened that led up to Ginny’s death. The fact that neither knew what happen didn’t matter much for the picture they painted of Harry.</p><p>The Hufflepuff students gave him a wide breath afraid that being in his presence would somehow cause them to die. The Ravenclaws avoided him but other than that didn’t say much.</p><p>Harry stood in the astronomy tower looking out over the grounds. A large tent was up; the many chairs under it filled with order members, students from Hogwarts, the professors and what he assumed to be other relatives of the Weasley family.</p><p>Although there wasn’t any proof Harry knew that Ron was responsible for destroying his things. They hadn’t spoken to him except to call him vile names.<br/>
They had effectively turned the entire Gryffindor house on him and most of the school. It was like second year all over again when the student body thought him to be the heir of slytherin.</p><p>Molly the woman he loved like a mother said the most horrible things to him. Wishing that he had died instead of her daughter; not her precious Ginny. In that moment the love he held for the woman died. It was as if the years he’d spent in their home were vague dreams.<br/>
Harry took all of their verbal abuse in silence. Years of living with the Dursley’s had him use to pretending that he didn’t exist. It didn’t matter to Molly that Harry was just as much a victim as Ron, Hermione, Neville and Luna. Both Ron and Hermione seemed to forget that he never asked them to accompany him to the ministry. Yet he remained silent.</p><p>“This isn’t your fault, you know,” Luna said joining him where he stood leaning on a side wall.</p><p>“Shouldn’t you be down there with everyone else?” Harry questioned looking at Luna for the first time.</p><p>“I’ve already said my goodbyes to Ginny privately,” Luna replied coming to stand beside him. “I’ve made my peace with what’s happened Harry and you should too. We all knew that going to the ministry could be dangerous. Don’t let them win.”</p><p>“It’s far easier for them to blame me for her being at the ministry. I guess it’s hard for Mrs. Weasley to imagine that Ginny chose to follow me; that I never asked anyone to go,” Harry continued needing to say it all before he exploded from the amount of hurt and betrayal he felt. “The students’ reaction to Ginny’s death is expected. I mean this is the second student who was killed and I was there to see it.”</p><p>It didn’t matter, none of it. Ginny was dead and nothing anyone said or did would change that.</p><p>“It still doesn’t make it right,” Luna argued. Harry had never seen the odd girl upset before she always had a weird view on life.</p><p>“Maybe not but there’s nothing that I can do about it,” Harry reminded her as they watched the people begin leaving.</p><p>Harry sighed when she hugged him, bringing his arms around her slender waist holding her close breathing in her light flowery scent. “Thank you Luna,” he responded quietly as the pair continued to stand watching over the grounds as the students and professors headed back towards the castle.</p><p>_________________________</p><p>The leaving feast was decorated the same as the end of fourth year when Cedric Diggory was killed. Black banners hang from the walls and ceilings.</p><p>Harry however wasn’t in attendance. He sat under a large tree by the lake watching the water gently ripple in the slight breeze of the night. He couldn’t take the whispering and stares tonight.</p><p>Ron and Hermione had already poisoned everyone against him. It didn’t help matters that the slytherins used every opportunity to sling insults at him. They were even now calling him the-boy-who-lived-to-get-his-friends-killed.</p><p>He had visited Ginny’s grave and said his goodbyes. He never felt more alone than he did now. He never thought losing his friends would hurt that much. Living with the Dursley’s had taught him to depend only on himself a lesson that he should have never stopped practicing.</p><p>Up at the head table Snape scanned the room looking for the head of messy hair but found Potter was missing from meals again. The boy hadn’t eaten much since their adventure to the ministry. He avoided everyone and hardly was seen by any of the staff or students.</p><p>Longbottom had gotten out of the infirmary after being attacked by unnamed students for defending Potter. It seemed as if the students had all band together in a vendetta that was based on lies. He was sure that Weasley and Granger orchestrated the whole thing.</p><p>He wasn’t surprised that Weasley had blamed Potter for his sister’s death however Granger was a surprise. She was normally the level headed one out the bunch.</p><p>He was aware that McGonagall had met with the pair taking their badges for being out of bounds. Both seemed subdued now that their privileges had been revoked to include 250 points being taken from the house and detention.</p><p>His slytherin prefects suffered the same fate for their involvement in the inquisitor’s squad. He was sure that Lucius would be highly disappointed in his son as well as Parkinson’s parents.</p><p>Snape couldn’t help but feel pity for the brat. He could see the pain clear as day on the young man’s face. He was baring every hateful comment, the betrayal of his friends, the death of a friend and the loss of the only family that he ever known to show him kindness with strength that Snape didn’t know the boy had. Where men far older would have fallen to the pressures of their grief.</p><p>Snape couldn’t help the pity he felt for the young hero and found that he couldn’t force himself to hate him any longer. Not a young man who faced such odds and still managed to be compassionate and giving.</p><p>Luna stood from the ravenclaw table heading towards the exit two apples in her hand as she crossed the entrance hall and exited the castle. As if being guided by an invisible force Luna sat down quietly beside Harry as he stared out over the lake.</p><p>“Don’t let them get to you,” Luna said, handing him the two apples she took from the dinner table.</p><p>“Thank you,” Harry stated with a sad sort of smile. Neville and Luna had stuck by him even when the whole school was taunting and trying to hex him in the halls. Harry couldn’t help but feel grateful but he also feared that the pair would be hurt by other students.</p><p>“Neville was at dinner tonight,” Luna informed him hoping the news would cheer him up.</p><p>“I don’t know why the actions of Gryffindor against Neville bother’s me so much,” Harry sighed, “they have proven over the years that they aren’t very loyal.”</p><p>“It’s not your problem that people place you up on a pedestal and have these perfect unrealistic views of you. You aren’t perfect and no one should expect you to be anything other than who the Goddess designed you to be. We should be getting inside now,” suggested Luna, “the feast should be just about over, I know you don’t want to seen by the masses and I need to search for the rest of my things if I hope to get packed before we leave in the morning.”</p><p>“Do you need help searching?” asked Harry as he got up from where he was sitting throwing the apple core into the lake where it disappeared under the surface.</p><p>“No, but thank you for offering,” Luna replied, with a bright smile on her face.</p><p>“It’s not right that people treat you the way they do,” Harry sighed at how his blonde companion didn’t seem all that bothered by the way people treated her.</p><p>“Harry, I have learned that not everyone will like me. I also learned that people can be mean, vindictive and downright cruel, but most of all I’ve learned compassion, love and admiration.”</p><p>“You taught me that. You are the most selfless, compassionate person I’ve ever had the pleasure to meet and I could never regret being your friend or going with you when you thought someone you loved was in danger. You’ve shown me that going up against impossible odds because you love someone is way beyond anything that I could have imagined,” Luna stated with a sweet smile.</p><p>Harry hugged her briefly kissing her cheek. “You are a very beautiful person inside and out; don’t let anyone make you feel that you are less than what you are. Thank you,” Harry responded. The pair headed back to the castle each going their separate ways when the entered the main hallway.</p><p>Harry could only look forward, although he still felt the lost of Ginny deep within him, he could no longer focus on the dead. He needed to move forward with his life. Harry had managed to save the prophecy from getting into Voldemort’s hands, a fact that he had yet to inform Dumbledore about.</p><p>He managed to remove it from the confines of Neville’s robes hiding it under his pillow. It was now hidden in the private room he was given. He didn’t know what made him not tell Dumbledore but something told him the old man was keeping secrets.</p><p>Entering his private rooms Harry allowed the pain he felt to manifest before drifting off into a restless sleep.</p><p>The next morning came quickly for Harry, Hedwig would probably meet him at Number 4 Privet Drive, and she had yet to return from delivering his letter to Sirius.</p><p>The train ride home the next day was completely lonely for Harry. He sat alone in a compartment near the end of the train no one ever used. He urged Luna and Neville to sit with their other friends promising them that he would be alright on his own.</p><p>When the train arrived at Kings Cross station, Harry waited until the train was nearly empty before getting off to avoid the Weasley’s and Hermione and her parents.</p><p>Exiting the barrier he followed the Dursley’s from the station in silence. The ride to number four Privet Drive was taken in silence.</p>
