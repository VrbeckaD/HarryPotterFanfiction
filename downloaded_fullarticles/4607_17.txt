    <p>Harry kissed Draco’s inner thighs and felt him <em>tremble.</em> Biting and sucking at the flesh gingerly while listening to Draco’s quavering moans.</p>
<p>“I’ve got you, Draco. I’ve got you.” He whispered and pulled Draco’s lower body a little bit closer to him. The lights were dim in the small college dorm room and the air was thick with moans.</p>
<p>“H-harry…please.” Draco quivered and held onto the sheets pulling them down to his thin pale shoulders. Not knowing what to do with his achingly numb hands. “Go slow. I’ve never done this before.”</p>
<p>“I know baby…don’t worry. I’m going to take care of you.” Harry promised before kissing around Draco’s length. He knew exactly what he wanted to do to Draco. And it didn’t take him long to get to it. Harry flicked his tongue over Draco’s swollen tip and smiled to himself as Draco’s hips began to squirm.</p>
<p>“Oh, Oooh Harry!” Draco cried out. And threw his head back especially as Harry sucked on it. Pulling off multiple times just to hear the skin “pop.”</p>
<p>Draco blushing a hot red held his lips open and froze as Harry slicked his tongue inside of the slit of his cock. Swirling over it in circles. Tasting and licking away the pre-cum that budded out heavily. Dripping down Draco’s shaft.</p>
<p>            “Harry!” Draco cried out repeatedly. Harry grinned and without warning he took the young virgin into his mouth. Going deep, sucking hard and letting Draco’s dick hit the back of his throat. Harry bobbed and sucked professionally and it drove Draco wild.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He had heard so many things about the infamous Harry Potter. That he was up to no good. That he was a cruel heartbreaker that every girl and guy should steer clear from. But Draco didn’t see it in him.</p>
<p>Harry was always so sweet to him. Buying him flowers and leaving love notes and text messages. Wooing Draco and loving him. The young man saw the goodness in Harry and didn’t care about what anyone had to say…</p>
<p>It all didn’t matter. Not when those green eyes looked at him tenderly. Not while those strong rough hands were all over him. Not now when the magical feeling of stars exploded inside him. Burning and unfolding him. Dancing over his nerves. Not definitely when Harry sucked dick this good. And it was only moments before Draco was erupting into Harry’s salacious mouth. Screaming as Harry swallowed deeply, masterfully and continued to suck afterward.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>            “Ah! Ah! Harry! I came! I c-came!” Draco squealed. Trying to move away from the growing intensity. But Harry held his hips down. Going slower for him. Humming and slurping until Draco was just breathless. Until he was mindlessly pumping upward and running his hands all over Harry’s messy hair. Pulling on it and not noticing how his legs were in the air, shaking.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This continued until Draco was nearly passing out. High-pitched wails escaping from the hidden corners of his throat and dying down low as he fell into a slow slumber. Harry pulled off slowly and playfully rested on Draco’s stomach with folded hands. Smiling at the sliver-headed beauty. Watching him sleep soundly for a moment before gently climbing up to kiss him awake.</p>
<p>           </p>
<p>            “Wake up baby.” Harry chuckled lowly. Kissing Draco’s blushing face and pink plump lips.</p>
<p>            “Harry, oh Harry.” Draco shivered as Harry wrapped him up in his arms and kissed the sweet tender spots of his neck. They cuddled for a moment. Kissing and murmuring sweet nothings to each other.</p>
<p>           “You’re so beautiful.” Harry whispered kissing Draco’s shoulders and moving back downward. Sitting up at the end of the bed and taking Draco by the ankles. Turning him over. New moans escaped Draco’s mouth as he was rolled around.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Harry what are you about to do to me?” Draco asked innocently as Harry kissed his back and licked down the line of his spine. Feeling him curl upward. Harry kept quiet and took his time kissing around Draco’s quivering backside. Rubbing his thighs and opening him up slowly.</p>
<p>“Harry?” Draco whimpered.</p>
<p>Harry smiled and answered by licking Draco’s throbbing pink hole. Tasting the pristine skin and feeling it ache nervously against his tongue.</p>
<p>Harry smiled and enjoyed the feel of it. The sight and smell of Draco’s <em>rosebud</em> made his cock stiffen. And he ached for it…had been aching for it for quite some time. But Harry was ever so patient. Very patient indeed…</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Relax, Draco.” Harry instructed. “Take deep breaths.”</p>
<p>Draco complied and huffed out a loose moan as Harry continued. Draco rolled his eyes back and felt the warmth of Harry’s tongue tickling him from deep down below.</p>
<p>With the cock sucking Draco had let go and just screamed and squealed freely. Enjoying himself and allowing himself to taken beyond the peak. But now with being eaten out made something in him ache savagely deep down to his bones.</p>
<p>Draco loved it and he let out noises he never imagined himself making. Deep solid groans that vibrated his nipples and made his stomach shake. The sensation was so mind blowing that his cock grew hard again and Draco began to buck his hips. Fucking hard into the mattress and Harry’s thick tongue back and forth.</p>
<p>“Damn boy.” Harry pulled off.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Gaww, S-sorry Harry. It just feels too good. It all feels so damn good.” Draco continued to fuck the bed giving Harry a full view of his pumping ass hole, balls and cock.</p>
<p>“Don’t fuck it too hard Draco you gonna leave dents.” Harry joked and watched as Draco lost himself. Harry licked his lips seeing that Draco was beginning to drip sloppily again with pre-cum. Sweat rolling down his ass and thighs.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco had just started to pump more savagely when Harry caught his cheeks in his hands, slapping them playfully.</p>
<p>“Save some of that for me, baby.” Harry laughed and applied another heartfelt lick to Draco’s trembling entrance.</p>
<p>“Ahh shit!” Draco let out as Harry slowly inserted a thumb into his puckering hole.</p>
<p>“I’ll just use my fingers this time baby…. I don’t want to hurt you, okay?” Harry said. Stroking and curling his fingers inside Draco. But Draco shook his head,</p>
<p>“ No Harry, please…give it to me. I want you. I want you to have me.”</p>
<p>Harry looked up and smiled, “You want me to have you?”</p>
<p>Draco turned and nodded and then He licked his lips, arched his back and wiggled his hips. Surprising Harry even more. Harry’s brows shot up and he felt his cock become hard as a diamond. Heated desire driving him mad.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry was on Draco within seconds... running his swollen cock against the virgin pinkness of Draco’s hole. Savoring the thick moment and anticipating the feel of how tight Draco was about to be.</p>
<p>“Aww shit, Draco. I’m about the fuck the shit out of you.” Harry was already breathless and his own heart raced. His dick twitching and wanting feverishly.</p>
<p>“But I’ll go slow, I’ll go slow…with you. I’ll make sure to…” Harry whispered as he eased his tip into Draco’s entrance. It was so snug warm and wet that Harry’s cock throbbed. Pulsating. His own ass cheeks quivering.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco moaned from the bottom of his gut as Harry sunk into him and kept his promise as he took his time going slow. Going deep until he bottomed out.</p>
<p>“Harry, please oh shit! Fuck!” Draco gasped and moved underneath his boyfriend. Harry stayed deep…. rolling his hips at a slow pace…feeling all of Draco. But not pumping or thrusting…not yet. Not just yet.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry wanted to know something. Something about Draco before he finally went for it. But he didn’t achieve it yet. Not yet and not like this. so Harry pulled out quickly but it was only just to watch Draco tremor hard and to listen to him moan and beg.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Harry, Please! Fuck me! Fuck me! Please! I want you! I want you!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>            Right then and there Harry Potter knew it well…that he owned the hell out of Draco Malfoy… And so he smirked deviously and began to pound viciously without mercy.</p>
<p> </p><hr/>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p>           The morning after Draco woke up in his dorm alone. Harry was out of sight and there wasn’t a note. The day went pass without a message or text from Harry and it was all Draco could think of.</p>
<p>When he called there wasn’t an answer.</p>
<p>When he texted there wasn’t a reply.</p>
<p>A week passed and Draco hadn’t heard from Harry. Classes dragged on and exams were now difficult to prepare for. More calls. More Text. Social media checks.</p>
<p>Nothing. No Pics. No status. Not even likes. Harry had gone complete ghost mode.</p>
<p>Then the day came when he finally saw him. Harry was walking down the campus pathway with the beautiful redhead, Ginny Weasley. The two were talking, laughing and the lovely girl was holding a bouquet of flowers.</p>
<p>Draco didn’t think of it…not the girl or the flowers.</p>
<p>He simply stepped forward to confront Harry for leaving and never contacting him back. But just as Draco came closer Harry looked up and rolled his eyes.</p>
<p>Draco froze. Mid-step…watching…horrified. As Harry Potter stopped and turned to kiss Ginny Weasley. Holding her waist and keeping her still. Kissing long enough for it to register in the back of Draco’s head. That this was real. That this was really happening.</p>
<p>When it was over Harry looked up and smirked as Draco began to desperately run away.</p>
