    <p>Something was wrong. He could feel it in his soul. The pull that was coming from his soul bound was stronger than Severus has ever felt it before.</p><p>
  <em>Something was wrong.</em>
</p><p>Severus quickly followed the pull and apparated, risking a splinch by not having a set destination in mind other than to his soul bound. To Lily.</p><p>Somehow, Severus made it without splinching himself, and Godric’s Hollow came into view. Dread filled Severus. The house was visible. The fidelity charm was broken. He quickly made his way towards the house.</p><p>Focusing on the pull, on the only hope Severus had left that his soul bound might still be alive, he made his way into the house. Just inside, Severus hesitated at the sight of James Potter’s body sprawled in front of the stairs. Fear at what else he would find filled him. He took a breath, the blood rushing in his ears almost deafening, and stepped around Potter’s body to head up the stairs.</p><p>Severus fell to his knees at the sight of Lily lying lifeless on the floor, and gathered her up in his arms. A howl ripped itself from his chest when he felt the strength of the pull was fading, almost as if his soul needed to see, to <em>feel</em>, that she was dead in order to believe it. Wrapped up in his grief, it wasn’t until his own sobs began to quiet that he registered the sobbing of another, of Lily’s infant son. Severus looked at the boy and his dark eyes met tear-filled, green ones. He had Lily’s eyes.</p><p>A sob broke through and Severus quickly moved his gaze away from the boy’s eyes, lest he fall into another wave of grief. His gaze was drawn to the cut on the boy’s head. A cut in the same shape as the wand movement needed to use the killing curse. Severus inhaled with realization. The Dark Lord was dead.</p><p>But so was Lily and the bond that Severus always had to her.</p><p>It was then that Severus heard sound of Sirius Black and Rubeus Hagrid loudly calling out for James and Lily. Gently, Severus laid Lily’s body back down to the floor and stood up. With one last glance at Lily’s body and then her son, Severus apparated out of the house just before Sirius and Hagrid entered the nursery.</p>
