    <em>Prompt: Howdy friend! I’d like to supply a Harry Potter prompt if you’re still in need. I was thinking of a first meeting type ting for a Marauder’s Era SiriusxFem!Reader with the phrase: “Um excuse me? This is a library. Can you and your noisey friends stop coming in everyday just to be a disturbance?” as inspiration. Bonus points for a sass battle. Thanks so much dear! You rock! </em>

</p><p>“I swear to Merlin, are you incapable of sitting still for more than five minutes?” Remus groaned as he laid his quill down and rubbed his eyes. He needed to study and Sirius had decided to tag along. James was busy trying to woo Lily Evans and Peter had made a sour face when Remus mentioned books so he was left in the dorm.</p><p>“Mooney, you know I am not good with this whole not moving and staying quiet thing.” Sirius said with a pout. He laughed when Remus glared at him. He turned and noticed a girl sitting nearby. She appeared to be in about the same year as them and she was very busy trying to study. He could tell that his antics were irritating her, but she was also pretending like she didn’t know he was there.</p><p>“Padfoot, don’t you dare.” Remus hissed. He had also noticed the girl and had seen the gears in Sirius’s head start turning.</p><p>“What?” Sirius said with a smirk. “I just thought about practicing this spell I know. That is what we are doing here, right? Getting better at magic and all that shit.” Before Remus could stop him, he tore off a tiny piece of parchment and charmed it to fly across the room. It landed on the page the girl was attempting to read. He watched in amusement and she closed her eyes and sighed. She didn’t turn to him though like he had wanted, she just continued to try reading.</p><p>Sirius smiled wider and repeated his actions. “Padfoot, stop.” Remus said, grabbing Sirius’s wand.</p><p>“Tt, you’re no fun.” Sirius sighed.</p><p>The girl closed her book with a huff. “Um excuse me? This is a library. Can you and your noisey friend stop coming in everyday just to be a disturbance?” She said, turning to glare at Remus and Sirius.</p><p>“Apologies, sweetheart. I’m not very good at this whole studying thing. Maybe you could give me some tips?” Sirius said in a flirtatious tone.</p><p>“I have never met this idiot in my life. Don’t blame me for his stupidity.” Remus muttered as he gathered his things. “C’mon, dumbass, time to leave the lady alone.”</p><p>“In a minute, stranger.” Sirius laughed. “My name is Sirius, what would yours be?”</p><p>“If I tell you will you leave me alone to study?” The girl asked. She sighed when Sirius nodded enthusiastically. “My name is Y/N.”</p><p>“Lovely name for a lovely girl.” Sirius said with a wink. “Now a promise is a promise so I’ll leave you alone, but you ever want me it shouldn’t be too hard to find me.” Remus groaned and grabbed Sirius’s arm. Y/N sighed when he finally left. He was a prick. A gorgeous, self-centered, prick. Merlin help her.</p>
