    <p>Something is tapping at his window.</p><p>Harry drags his eyes open and stares blearily at the green sheets on his bed for a full thirty seconds before his brain recognizes that the tapping is, in fact, not a dream. There's actually something at the window and it doesn't sound like it's going to go away anytime soon. He stays where he is for another thirty seconds, contemplating the intelligence of casting a silencing charm and rolling over, before finally giving it.</p><p>With a faint groan, he pushes himself up and runs a hand through his hair. He's exhausted, and he really wishes he’d taken Kreacher’s offer of a Dreamless Sleep Potion, but he wanted to be able to wake up if Draco needed him. As it is, the sun filtering in around the curtains tells him that it's early morning, and that means it won't be long until Draco is awake.</p><p>"I'm coming, I'm coming," Harry mutters, groping around for his glasses. He shoves them on as he shuffles over to the window and open the curtains. The sight of Draco's owl, Peridot, is not unexpected, though it's not entirely welcome this early. Nevertheless, he opens the window and lets Peridot fly inside. Peridot lands on the perch on Harry's desk and sticks his leg out with an imperious hoot.</p><p>The sight of the newspaper tied to Peridot's leg makes Harry's stomach churn all over again. He rubs a hand over his face. Apparently, his desire to see the past week become nothing more than a bad dream isn’t going to pan out after all. He slowly unties the paper, fills Peridot’s dish with water and sets a few owl treats on the desk, then sinks down onto his bed. He doesn’t open the Prophet or the letter right away, preferring instead to dwell on how they came to be in this mess.</p><p>Approximately six months ago, the eighth years graduated from Hogwarts. Hermione immediately joined the Ministry, specifically the Unspeakables department. Ron joined the Aurors. Harry didn’t know what to do, and still doesn’t; he’s been trying to figure out what he wants to do, only knowing that he doesn’t want to be an Auror. He’s had his fill of chasing down bad guys.</p><p>Draco didn’t have any job offers either. But he was so clearly reluctant to go back to living at Malfoy Manor that it just made sense for Harry to offer to let Draco move in to Grimmauld Place. He's not sure who was more surprised when Draco actually accepted the offer, Harry, Ron or Draco, but so far it’s been working out really well. Harry would’ve dared to say that they were actually happy.</p><p>He and Draco had even started dating, so that wasn't just a cover story anymore, and the age play side of their relationship had been flourishing too. Harry should've known that everything was going too well. But even then, nothing could've prepared him for waking up five days ago to a copy of the Daily Prophet that featured a couple of pictures of Draco when he was in his little headspace, along with an article titled "Boy-Who-Lived Living with Little Death Eater?" </p><p>He'd been horrified. Draco had been mortified. Harry’s first action had been to immediately hire Bill to figure out how those pictures had been taken. Draco was never Little outside of Grimmauld Place, which meant that someone had gotten those pictures while Draco was out in the yard. Sure enough, Bill had come across a place where the wards had been peeled away. It was subtle but masterful work. Bill repaired the wards and layered on new ones so that this wouldn't happen again, but as far as Harry was concerned the damage was done. The whole world knew.</p><p>Draco hadn't seen anyone since the article went out. He didn’t want to talk about it or anything else. It was Hermione, over a Floo call, who kindly suggested that Harry and Draco might want to do an interview with someone they trusted to set the record straight. The idea had made Harry uncomfortable. He didn't have the best track record when it came to the press. But he could tell that Hermione had some valid points at the same time. People were only going to ask more questions if they didn't know anything. Doing a simple question-and-answer interview was a good way to prevent the worst of it.</p><p>And so here he is, with a copy of the Daily Prophet in hand that contains his interview. Draco refused to do the interview, but had given his permission for Harry to do it. Harry just hopes he didn’t fuck anything up. It helps that the person writing this article is someone he actually trusts: surprising everyone, Parvati Patil had joined the Prophet as a journalist immediately following her graduation from Hogwarts.</p><p>“Guess I should get on with it,” Harry says to Peridot.  The owl gives a brief hoot in reply before taking off out the window. Harry watches him go and sighs. Peridot makes him miss having an owl of his own, but he’s not ready to replace Hedwig just yet.</p><p>He opens the letter attached to the paper first. All it says is that Parvati has sent them an advance copy, and that it will go out to the wizarding world at large by noon. Harry takes a deep breath at that, letting it out slowly, and closes his eyes for a moment. Despite the fact that he knows this is for the best, and it's kind of inevitable at this point because everyone already knows and at this point they're just trying to put a more positive spin on the information that is already out there, he's still unaccountably nervous.</p><p>Just as he’s about to unroll the paper, there’s a faint pop and Kreacher appears in the room and says, “Young master is awake.”</p><p>“Oh,” Harry says. He shoves the paper into his pocket, slips on his slippers and robe, and hurries out of the room. Draco has two bedrooms; one is set up to look very similar to Harry’s, but the other looks more like a nursery. That’s the room that Harry goes to.</p><p> The sound of soft crying quickens his pace, and he pushes the door open gently to see that Draco is kneeling in the middle of his bed. Only Harry can see the pale grey bubble that surrounds the bed, keeping Draco from falling out of bed or getting up in the middle of the night. He moves closer and the shield falls automatically at his approach. That catches Draco's attention - he's a sensitive little thing - and he looks up to reveal red, wet eyes. Harry's heart aches at the sight and he opens his arms, fully prepared for the moment when Draco lets out a sob and jumps at him.</p><p>"I had a bad dream," he wails, grabbing Harry around the neck. </p><p>"Did you? I'm sorry. It's okay now," Harry says, wandlessly casting a lightening charm. He's gotten very good at them over the past few weeks, to the point where they're practically second nature now. It makes it a lot easier to move Draco around the house when Harry can just scoop him up and go rather than having to coax or cajole Draco into willingly going with him.</p><p>Pulling Draco into his lap, Harry takes a seat on the bed and pulls out his wand. He performs a couple of charms to clean and dry Draco's face, and remove the mess of snot and drool from the front of Draco's shirt. He surreptitiously checks to see if Draco's pull-up is wet, but it's not. Draco doesn't wear them all the time, but, ever since the time when he wet the bed, he's taken to wearing them during the night time. He's wet them several times now, usually when he wakes up sobbing from a nightmare.</p><p>Then he pulls Draco in close and nuzzle his cheek against the top of Draco's head. Sometimes the best way to get Draco to calm down is to silently offer comfort and let him cry it out. It sounds terrible, and it's not easy to do, but Harry has a running suspicion that Draco didn't really get the opportunity to express much emotion when he was a child. </p><p>He doesn't prompt for details, so it surprises him when Draco tearfully whispers, "I dreamt that Father showed up and was really mad at me and he disowned me and..." Draco's voice catches on a sob. "And then you were disappointed in me too and you decided you didn't want me anymore an' I had nowhere to go so I had to sleep in the <i>mud</i>!" He sobs that last part out.</p><p>In spite of himself, Harry almost smiles. It figures that Draco would consider the worst part to be sleeping in the mud. He schools his expression as best he can and leans back until he can catch Draco's eye, then says, "Draco, do you really think I would turn you away?"</p><p>"I... I dunno," Draco says in a tiny voice, sniffing.</p><p>"Well, I wouldn't," Harry says, heart twisting even more. "It doesn't matter to me what anyone else thinks. You - I.. I like this. What we do." He swallows, wishing he was better at words. Why can't he just tell Draco how happy Draco makes him? Why is that so difficult to say?</p><p>"Really?" Draco asks.</p><p>"Yes, really. I like caring for you and I like being your boyfriend." Harry gently wipes another tear away from Draco's cheek. "Even if your father did disown you, that wouldn't change anything. And believe me, I've seen your father angry before. He's never scared me." That's technically a lie - Harry was terrified of Lucius Malfoy that night in his second year, when Lucius was seconds away from casting the killing curse on him - but that was a very long time ago. He's stood up to and faced down Voldemort. Even on his worst night, Lucius isn't a tenth as frightening as Voldemort was.</p><p>"But... but what if I end up <i>poor</i>?" Draco says the word 'poor' like it's the worst thing someone could possibly be.</p><p>"I have plenty of money. I can easily support us both," Harry replies. That much, at least, is completely true. It helps that he has vague plans to get a job at some point.</p><p>Draco is quiet for a moment, obviously thinking this through. Then he says, "But now your friends know."</p><p>"Well, yes," Harry admits. He hasn't really talked to Ron or Hermione or the rest of the Weasley's about this. The conversation he had with Hermione, where she advised him to do an interview with someone from the Prophet, was rather short because Hermione was getting ready to go to work. He knows they haven't contacted him because they're waiting for him to be the one to reach out. And he will, just as soon as he can be sure he knows what he wants to say.</p><p>"Maybe they'll hate you," Draco says, watching Harry from beneath his eyelashes.</p><p>"Maybe, but I don't think so. And even if they did, that means they're not really my friends. Not if they hate me for something that makes me - makes me happy." Harry has to force himself to say it, and feels a surge of pride once it's finally out. </p><p>He can tell Draco isn't fully convinced, and Harry can't blame him for that. Draco doesn't know Ron or Hermione the way that Harry does. Age play isn't forbidden in the wizarding world. In fact, Harry would go so far as to say that it's not uncommon. But from what he's read, it always happens behind closed doors. There are a lot of wizarding families, particularly pureblood families, who don't look kindly on it and who would condemn someone who actively takes part in it. Harry's pretty sure it's because age play goes against the stuffy rules that purebloods live and die by. </p><p>To be honest, he can't say with 100% confidence that Ron, Hermione, or the Weasley's wouldn't find their activities strange. But Harry also knows that they love him. If he tells them that this is what he wants, he knows they'll support him. He only wishes that Draco could say the same for his parents.</p><p>He brushes a few damp strands of hair out of Draco's face. "What do you say we go out today?" he suggests. "Into the muggle world? We could go to a toy store."</p><p>Draco's attention is immediately caught. "Isn't that weird?"</p><p>Harry shrugs. "Maybe, but if anyone asks we'll say we're buying a gift for a younger sibling or niece or nephew. No one will know it's us, so what does it matter?" He smiles and taps Draco's nose. </p><p>"... Okay," Draco agrees finally, and Harry smiles wider. He can read the article later. Right now, they've got a trip to a toy store to look forward to.</p>
