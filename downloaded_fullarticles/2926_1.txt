  <span>Despite it being a Saturday, Draco was required at the Ministry. And not by the visitors’ entrance; since Thicknesse had installed the toilet network, it might as well be used. Who better to use it than Repentant Death Eaters reporting for unemployment status?</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Harry had insisted on coming along. They stood together in the small cubicle, bathroom quiet without the lower officials having to use it any longer.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I really must insist that you go through the guest entry. Who knows what scandal there’ll be if The Boy Who Lived Twice has to step into a toilet.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Draco,” Harry’s voice was patient, “I’m going with you. You’ll have your meeting, we’ll meet at the Fountain, and then go for lunch.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“So not only will you be seen with wet socks, you’ll be seen with me. Brilliant, Scarhead, just brilliant.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>For a moment Harry was flung back to Hogwarts, a skinny blonde boy sneering haughtily at him in the stone corridors. But now he saw the things the sneer had distracted from - the fear, the loneliness, the expectation.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Harry took Draco’s hand, rubbing his thumb along the pale knuckles, bringing it up to press his lips to them.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I’ll go first.”</span>
</p>
