    <p align="justify">Harry is not a normal teenage boy, no Harry is the-boy-who-lived and he despises it. Yes he hated that he was Famous, but who could blame him? He became famous because he survived a killing curse, because his parents sacrificed themself for him, and he was reminded by it everytime he looks in the mirror and sees his scar. Harry would rather be normal and have parents than be the the saviour of the wizarding world, but Harry found out a long time ago that he wasn't normal, not even for a wizard.</p><p align="justify">Now that he killed the-dark-lord-who-didn't-want-to-die, he expected everything to be normal, but no he became even more famous because of it. Most wizards loved Harry, they didnt know him but they loved the idea of him. But then there were Voldys followers who didn't die or were not locked up in Azkaban who wanted revenge, Harry wasn't afraid though, and most death eaters were to scarred to act on their words anyway. Harry did just kill their Master and lets be honest if Voldy the most powerful dark lord didn't stood a chance against Harry then the death eaters had a reason to be scared.</p><p align="justify">The weight on his shoulders didn't get lifted after voldemorts death, on the contrary it seemed to just get heavier. Responsibilty was exchanged with guilt and grief. How many people couldn't he save? How many died to protect him? If only he was stronger, if only he had learned occlumency. Remus... Sirius. Harrys heart ached just thinking about them and he wished more than anything to change time. To save his family. He had so little, he never knew what it was like to have parents to feel loved and now with remus and sirius gone he would never know what it would have been like to have a father. </p><p align="justify">Of course there were Hermione and Ron, whom he saw as his brother and sister in anything but blood. Hermione, who often complains about how Harry handles his problems and situations but Harry knew Hermione would always stay beside him no matter how crazy the situation was they were in, she would try and find out a solution to their problems, merlin knows Hermione was the brain of the trio. Then there was Ron, Harry had to admit that the jealousy outburst and slight anger issues of Ron were quite annoying but he knew he could count on Ron in the end. Ron who had always crazier solutions to problems than Harry, Ron who could always crack a joke to lighten the mood, Ron who had the emotional range of a teaspoon.</p><p align="justify">Yes Harry easily admitted without Ron or Hermione he wouldn't be complete. They were the Golden Trio after all. He might have defeated Voldy in the end but without Hermione and Ron he would have died a long time ago, probably First year. Maybe the devil snare would have strangled him to death or the chess pieces would have killed him, everyone knew he sucked at chess. Not to mention snapes riddle. He might have burnt to death if it wasn't for Hermione.</p><p align="justify">Harry was very grateful to have Ron and Hermione as his best friend, but Harry longed for his parents. He wanted to be hugged by his mother, wanted to be told by his father that he was proud of Harry. Merlins socks, Harry would be happy if his parents grounded him, for the pranks he pulled. He would accept everything he gets but he wanted to see them, hear them and be able to hug them. It wasn't too much to ask, Harry thought, after everything he has been through after everything he lost, he damn well deserved some happiness. This particuliar thought brought Harry to his Current situation, right now Harry was standing in Albus Dumbledores old Office searching for the time turner he knew he saw once, when he destroyed Dumbledores office in fifth year.</p><p align="justify">"Alohomora" he says and the drawer springs open, inside lays the object of his desire and hope twinkles in his eyes as Harry grabs it and puts the necklace over his head. 'Bring me to my parents' he thought and proceeds to turn the time turner outer circle for years, 20 times. Now everyone could have told Harry it wouldn't work. A Time turner can only go back 5 years, but even then Harry wouldn't listen. Harry Potter isn't Stupid, even if some people say otherwise <em>cough</em> Snape <em>cough</em>, so Harry wasn't surprised when nothing happened, he didn't think it would. Still he had to try, he would find a way and if it takes him years to accomplish, there had to be a way. So lost in his thoughts he didn't hear when the door opened and two figures approached him from behind.</p><p align="justify">"Did you really think you could leave without us?" Rons voice echoed through the room sounding hurt, Harry winced and shoot Ron an apologetic smile who in return only rolled his eyes.</p><p align="justify">"Do not encourage him Ronald!" Hermione scolded him, as Ron slips the necklace over his head. "Harry explain yourself, why do you have a time turner?" She continued while also slipping the necklace over her head and looking at him expectantly. He sighed. Even if they didnt know what they got themselves into, even without a plan, those two were always by his side. Ready to face the danger. Ready for another adventure.</p><p align="justify">"It doesn't matter" he mumbled "It really doesn't, it doesn't work, i will never be able to see my mom or my dad or the mauraders minus rat" he continued spitting the word rat venomly, after she sent him an disbelieving look which immediatly turned into pity</p><p align="justify">"Oh Harry" she whispered "I know you miss them"</p><p align="justify">"Can't miss something you never knew" he mumbled into his grey sweater but either Hermione didn't hear it or she wisely ignored his comment.</p><p align="justify">"Harry i know it's hard, but we cannot mess with time, you might change the future, Harry you could change something important, voldemort might win or worse things could happen"</p><p align="justify">"I take the risk! Besides i want to change the future, i dont want my parents to be killed. Don't i deserve happiness? Don't i deserve to get to know my parents? Doesn't Teddy deserve to live happy with his parents? If i can stop voldemort before all this, wouldn't the future change for the better?" He almost screamed but his eyes were fixed on the floor not being able to see the pity on either of his friends faces. He hated it when people felt sorry for him.</p><p align="justify">Feeling his anger rise inside of him he grabbed his wand without thinking and pointed it on the time turner</p><p align="justify">"It's useless anyhow, it won't take me back to the day i was born!" He exclaimed and then Harry cursed the time turner, feeling the need to release his anger "Sectumsempra" he yelled. Now there were three things wrong with this, and Harry would later gladly admit that he was being stupid and acted once again without thinking. First, he knew how dangerous the sectumsempra curse was and cursing it so close to his friends was dangerously stupid. Second, he had no idea what effect it would have, cursing a magical object was just plain stupid and last he swore after the Draco incident to never again use the curse, he had no idea why he used that curse it just came to his mind and he immediatly regretted it after it left his mouth.</p><p align="justify">Harry saw the Time turner being cut into tiny pieces and then something cut through his skin on his left cheek, his chest and his arms. And immediatly everything went black, he hoped that only he got hurt and not his friends 'stupid' he scolded himself and then he drifted into nothing.</p>
