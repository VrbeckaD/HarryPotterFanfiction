    <p>CHALLENGE<br/>
Challenge issued by "Reptilia28" - Originally on Portkey(dot)org verbatim:<br/>
funny little challenge I just came up with. It's a comical twist on the time-travel category<br/>
STORYLINE:<br/>
*Harry is killed at 17 during a fight with Voldemort. He's sent to his Death's office (explained later) and finds out that this isn't the first time that this has happened.<br/>
*Harry's Death (who can have a human name) is mad at his arrival. Apparently, people dying before their time is a black mark on the various Deaths' records, and Harry is getting perilously close to getting this particular one fired.<br/>
*When Harry asks what was supposed to have happened, Death goes off on a rant saying how he was supposed to have killed Voldemort, found his soulmate ("Some Granger girl...") and lived to be a centennial age. But since Harry keeps getting into life-threatening situations for one reason or another, he keeps dying before that happens. Harry is surprised about the soulmate part.<br/>
*Death gives Harry a paper to sign that allows him to retain his memories (the previous times, he wasn't given this option for some reason). Harry is deposited to a previous time of the writer's choosing.<br/>
*Eventually, Harry gets it right. He kills Voldemort, gets the girl, and lives to a ripe old age of whatever. And Death doesn't get fired.<br/>
REQUIREMENTS:<br/>
*Harry had to have died at least three times before this one.<br/>
*The memory keeping contract must be included.<br/>
*Death must refer to Hermione as "some Granger girl" when Harry's soulmate turns up in his rant.<br/>
*Obviously, must be H/Hr.<br/>
*Have fun.<br/>
OPTIONAL:<br/>
*Dumbledore's manipulations can be a factor in Harry's premature demises.</p>
