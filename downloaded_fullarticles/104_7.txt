    <p>When Yuuri was eleven years old, something very peculiar happened.</p><p>It was a day like any other, except that there was an owl right outside his window. </p><p>It stared at him expectantly, like it was expecting him to let it in.</p><p>“Mama!” he called. </p><p>He did not like England. </p><p>His family had been forced to move from Japan after the onsen his family owned went bankrupt. </p><p>Yuuri did not like all the changes, he was still learning English, that was bad enough.</p><p>Now it turned out that the animals worked different as well?</p><p>He really wanted to go back home to Japan.</p><p>“What is it honey?” Hiroko, Yuuri’s mother asked worriedly as she rushed into his bedroom to find out what was wrong.</p><p>Yuuri pointed to the owl at his window and Hiroko lit up with happiness. </p><p>“You should let him in,” Hiroko said with a smile. “He has a letter for you.” </p><p>-</p><p>That was the thing that really kicked Yuuri over the edge. </p><p>He? A wizard? He was going to live in a castle in Scotland? Without his family? </p><p>A school for wizards?</p><p>Yuuri was pretty sure that it caused his first panic attack.</p><p>He really wasn’t ready.</p><p>“Yuuri, honey, calm down,” Hiroko pleaded gently. “You’ll make a lot of friends and you’ll learn to control your… abilities…” </p><p>“I don’t want to be away from you,” Yuuri said brokenly. “I… I’m scared.”</p><p>Hiroko hugged him tightly. “You’re so strong, love,” she reassured him. “I know you can do it.” </p><p>Yuuri wasn’t so sure, but apparently he didn’t have much of a choice.</p><p>Apparently magic could skip a generation. His grandmother had been a very powerful witch, and her genes had been transferred to him.</p><p>His family had been surprised but not overly so. They had known that something was different about him ever since he was a baby and things sometimes floated around him. </p><p>Yuuri couldn’t understand why they wouldn’t tell him about that.</p><p>He had to find out like this?</p><p>-</p><p>The rest of the weeks before school was a blur. </p><p>Yuuri was introduced to a distant relative that took him to a town of magic where he could get books and a wand. </p><p>Getting a wand was probably the strangest of experiences. </p><p>He was handed different ones, and almost all of them turned on him. </p><p>Until one.</p><p>It was a medium long cherry wood wand with a phoenix core. </p><p>As soon as he touched it, he felt his entire body respond to it. </p><p>The owner of the store said that it was an ideal match.</p><p>His relative Minako claimed that it was a very special wand. Phoenix cores were the rarest of all and the cherry tree was very powerful and could sometimes act on its own accord. </p><p>Everything was new to Yuuri, so he appreciated everything she told him about magic.</p><p>He was still terrified of taking the magical train to Hogwarts the school of witchcraft and wizardry. Even the name of it sounded intimidating.</p><p>Then he was going to live there for almost a whole year. </p><p>He could come home during Christmas, but he wasn’t sure if his family could afford that. Otherwise he would have to wait until summer next year. </p><p>He would be twelve years old then.</p><p>He would have to spend his birthday away from his family. </p><p>“Do you want to get a pet?” Minako asked cheerfully. “It might be good for you to have someone to rely on.” </p><p>Minako spoke Japanese, something Yuuri was very grateful for. </p><p>“Are they allowed?” Yuuri asked worriedly. </p><p>“Of course,” Minako assured. “I got Mika when I first started.” </p><p>Mika was Minako’s ancient cat that followed her everywhere.</p><p>“Could I get a dog?” Yuuri asked in awe.</p><p>Minako smiled. “Of course,” she smiled as she opened a door to a store filled with animals.</p><p>Yuuri went straight towards the puppies and stared at them in amazement. They were all so cute. </p><p>“See anyone you like?” Minako asked fondly.</p><p>“Can I have all of them?” Yuuri asked excitedly.</p><p>Minako snorted. “I think you can start with one and see if you want another one next year.”</p><p>Yuuri nodded in understanding as he reached down his hand in the box and a small brown puppy carefully made its way to him.</p><p>“It seems like Vicchan likes you,” the store owned suddenly spoke up.</p><p>Yuuri immediately pulled his hand away. </p><p>“Don’t be scared,” the store owner said calmly. “I just like to make sure that these animals come to their right owner.” </p><p>“He really like dogs,” Minako said fondly. “He had a lot of them when he lived in Japan, he was the one who took care of them, but his family had to sell them all when they moved here.” </p><p>“That’s a shame,” the store owner said in sympathy. “Dog people should have dogs, and I can see that you really love them.” </p><p>Yuuri nodded in agreement. “I really do.” </p><p>The store owner smiled as he picked up the puppy named Vicchan and handed him to Yuuri.</p><p>Vicchan sniffed Yuuri’s face curiously and Yuuri couldn’t help but to smile. </p><p>“You have a very gentle heart,” the store owner said. “Dogs like that about you.” </p><p>Yuuri looked into the kind eyes of the puppy and he couldn’t help but to feel his heart flutter. “Minako, can I keep him?” </p><p>Minako nodded before turning to the pet owner. “How much?” </p><p>“He can have him for free,” the pet owner said with a smile. “Giving a pet to a good owner is payment enough.” </p><p>“Really?” Minako asked in surprise.</p><p>“The supplies will cost plenty, the dog can be considered as a gift by me.” </p><p>Yuuri smiled brightly, and somehow his fear of school started to transform into excitement. </p><p>He really couldn’t wait to introduce Vicchan to everyone there.</p><p>-</p><p>Yuuri hugged Vicchan closely as he got on the train. </p><p>“Send a letter as soon as you can!” Minako called after him. “I’ll send you an owl!” </p><p>Yuuri barely had a chance to answer before more people wanted to get on the train, forcing him inside it.</p><p>“Stay safe and don’t break the house rules!” Minako continued to yell after him. “Make us proud!” </p><p>Yuuri felt his heart pound in his chest as he found a empty cart and sat down far in against the corner, grateful that he was early. </p><p>“Can I sit here?” a very cheerful boy his own age suddenly asked as he peeked in his head in the cart.</p><p>Yuuri nodded and the boy went inside. </p><p>“Wow, that’s such a cute puppy,” the boy exclaimed as he reached out his hand to greet him. “What’s his name?” </p><p>“Vicchan,” Yuuri smiled. </p><p>“Hi, Vicchan,” the boy greeted. “I’m Phichit by the way,” he said as he turned back to Yuuri.</p><p>“I’m Yuuri,” Yuuri introduced himself. </p><p>“You have a very unique accent,” Phichit remarked. “Are you from Thailand?” </p><p>“Japan,” Yuuri admitted.</p><p>“That’s close to Thailand,” Phichit claimed. “My parents are from Thailand, and we usually land in Japan when we’re traveling there.” </p><p>“Oh, that’s nice,” Yuuri said. </p><p>“I wish I could speak Thai, or any other language for that matter, do you speak Japanese?” </p><p>Yuuri nodded.</p><p>“That’s brilliant,” Phichit said in awe. “Maybe you can teach me?” </p><p>“Uhm, sure,” Yuuri agreed hesitantly. </p><p> </p><p>Phichit beamed. “And I’ll be happy to practice English with you if you want?” </p><p>Yuuri felt oddly touched by such a kind offer. “I’d like that, thank you.” </p><p>“You’re very good at it,” Phichit stated. “How long have you been learning it?” </p><p>Yuuri shrugged. “A little over a year.” </p><p>“Wow!” Phichit gasped in awe. “Then you’re probably going to be a Ravenclaw! I hear they are very smart.” </p><p>“Oh, I… I haven’t really thought about what house to be in,” Yuuri admitted sheepishly. </p><p>“I think I might be a Hufflepuff,” Phichit admitted. “I tend to be very loyal to my friends, but on the other hand, Gryffindors are also very loyal.” </p><p>Yuuri nodded in understanding.</p><p>“But on the other hand… So are Slytherins,” Phichit said thoughtfully. “So I suppose we’ll see.” </p><p>Yuuri continued to nod. </p><p>“Do you know what house you want to belong to?” Phichit asked. “Sometimes the sorting hat might take that into consideration.” </p><p>“I don’t really know that much about the houses,” Yuuri admitted. “Magic is kind of new to me…”</p><p>“Are you muggle-born?” Phichit asked curiously. “Are your parents normal humans with no magic?” </p><p>“Y-yeah,” Yuuri said hesitantly. “My grandmother had magic.” </p><p>“Magic sometimes skip generations,” Phichit explained. “My father had magic but not my mom, so I’ve always know about it, and when I turned three, I apparently flew for a little bit when I fell off a table, since then I’ve been preparing.”</p><p>“Apparently things flew around me when I was a baby,” Yuuri admitted. “But my parents never told me about it.” </p><p>Phichit’s eyes widened. “You showed magic as a baby?” </p><p>Yuuri blushed with embarrassment. “I don’t remember it,” he claimed. “But that’s what they told me.” </p><p>“You must be very powerful then,” Phichit stated. “Witches and wizards that shows magic under the age of two are usually the strongest of all.”</p><p>Yuuri swallowed thickly, he didn’t want more magic than he could handle.</p><p>“You shouldn’t worry though, have you shown more magic lately?” </p><p>Yuuri thought back to his panic attack, about the flickering lights and the shattering glass around him. “I… I guess…” </p><p>“Well,” Phichit said with a smile. “Now you at least get to learn how to handle it.” </p><p>Yuuri smiled back a little, grateful that the first person he met was so kind and understanding.</p><p>“I think we will be very good friends,” Phichit declared. “I’ll teach you everything I know, even if we end up in different houses.” </p><p>“Really?” Yuuri asked shyly.</p><p>Phichit nodded. “That’s what friends are for.”</p>
