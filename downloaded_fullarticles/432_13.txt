        <strong>First year: Rose learns why Albus is in Slytherin.</strong>
      </p>
<p>Rose and Albus ran quickly through the Hogwart's Express, trying to outrun Albus' older brother James and his chant of "You'll get IN to Slytherin!". This chant was neither clever nor witty but to be honest, either was James.</p>
<p>"Give it a bloody rest James!" Rose called back as they parted the sea of people around them in the corridor. Rose wasn't one to take James' cheek and had a very low tolerance for him at the best of times. Albus also had a very low tolerance for his brother but often took James' teasing to heart.</p>
<p>"Albus, wait up!' called Rose as she realised he had squeezed past a few more people and was further along the corridor than she had realised. As she caught up with him Rose grabbed him on the shoulder. As he turned to look at her, Rose noticed his eyes were downcast.</p>
<p>"Al, don't worry about what that dickhead said. He's just jealous that you got more attention on the platform than he did," Rose said, rolling her eyes. Albus gave her a small smile.</p>
<p>"Thanks, you're right, he is a dickhead,"</p>
<p>Rose gasped, "Albus Potter, did you just swear?" Albus broke into a real smile this time. "It appears so," he replied. Rose smiled back at him. Within their family, Rose was the one known for her ability to go from zero to irate in less than 0.5 of a second, which was often accompanied by less than ladylike language. When she wasn't mad, however, Rose was perfectly polite and pleasant to be around. Albus was a bit more sensitive. Always noticing when people were staring at him, the weight of the world on his shoulders as he was the closest in likeness to his famous father out of all his siblings. This meant that people always stared, always commented and always had high expectations of him. They always assumed he was perfectly thrilled to be his father's son but he often felt that it was quite the burden to bear and he did not feel he could live up to the standards others had set him, let alone live up to his first, middle and surname. Albus was the reflector while Rose was the activist. Their personalities complimented each other perfectly to create an easy friendship as well as a familial bond.</p>
<p>"Come on, let's go find a carriage, they're filling up fast."</p>
<p>They walked slower now that James had given up chase, but every carriage was full of students already excited to see each other. It was nearly at the back of the train that they finally saw a carriage with only one student sitting within. Albus reached up to the handle while looking at Rose, silently asked her confirmation. Rose gave a slight nod and shoulder shrug which indicated him to go ahead.</p>
<p>As Albus slid open the compartment door, the blonde boy who had been idly staring out of the window and surrounded by piles of sweets looked up.</p>
<p>"Hi, is this compartment-" Albus started but was abruptly cut off.</p>
<p>"It's free. It's just me." The boy said, standing up and showering the floor with the sweets he had dislodged. Albus, who was distracted by the sweets replied.</p>
<p>"Great. So we might just – come in – for a bit – if that's okay?"</p>
<p>"That's okay. Hi!"</p>
<p>"Albus, Al. I'm – my name is Albus." Albus stumbled for his words. He had almost said he was Albus Potter but didn't want his first interaction on the train to be marred by his famous last name. This did not deter their carriage companion.</p>
<p>"Hi Scorpius. I mean, I'm Scorpius, You're Albus. I'm Scorpius. And you must be?" Scorpius turned to Rose who had a bewildered smile forming on her mouth, trying to hold in the laughter she felt while watching the two boys awkwardly interact.</p>
<p>"Rose." She answered, noticing that Albus hadn't given his last name so she didn't want to rat him out by association.</p>
<p>"Hi Rose, would you like some of my Fizzing Wizzbees?" Scorpius asked, looking around for the aforementioned packet of sweets.</p>
<p>"I've just had breakfast, thanks" she replied with a chuckle. She found him very amusing. He didn't seem to have heard her and he continued.</p>
<p>"I've also go some Shock-o-choc, Pepper Imps and some Jelly Slugs. Mum's idea, she says 'sweets, they always help you make friends'," he paused after saying the last line in a singsong voice.</p>
<p>Rose could see him mentally kicking himself as he sat back down. "Sorry, stupid idea probably." He said quietly. While Rose didn't really feel like sweets at this early hour (her grandparents were dentists after all), she was about to change her mind after seeing Scorpius deflate so quickly, but Albus bet her to it.</p>
<p>"I'll have one, Mum doesn't let me have sweets. Which one would you start with?"</p>
<p>"Easy, I've always regarded the Pepper Imp as the king of the confectionery bag. They're peppermint sweets that make you smoke at the ears," Scorpius said excitedly and proffered the bag to Albus.</p>
<p>Rose sat herself beside Albus and watched as the boys shared the sweets and spoke in great detail about the different types. She laughed internally as Scorpius hadn't realised that Albus knew a lot about each of the sweets given he apparently wasn't allowed to eat them. That was because it was a lie, a little white lie that Albus had told Scorpius so he didn't feel put out that Rose hadn't accepted his offer. This was another reason why they worked so well as friends. Albus was able to put out the flames of Rose's small fires, however small and insignificant. The conversation finally turned away from sweets and they started to discuss Hogwarts.</p>
<p>"What house do you think you'll get into? Gryffindor would be an almost certain bet for the both of you I reckon, given who your parents are." Scorpius said, giving away that he knew exactly who they were without them offering their last names. He quickly looked away from them as he realised how he had slipped up. Rose entered into the conversation without hesitation.</p>
<p>"Maybe, I'm not too sure really. I think I would fit into any of the houses given the chance," she paused at the incredulous look on Albus' face, then continued. "Well, maybe not Hufflepuff." Albus laughed heartily at this. Scorpius looked confused.</p>
<p>"What's wrong with Hufflepuff?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Oh nothing, Rose just isn't the most, um, friendly of people sometimes." Albus replied between chuckles. Scorpius looked confused.</p>
<p>"But I think you're friendly. You came an sat with me when no one else would. I'm sure you know who I am. I mean, I knew who you both were right away." Scorpius said, looking directly at Rose. Rose smiled and rolled her eyes.</p>
<p>"I think what Al means is that I might have other stronger personality traits over friendliness. I just hope Al and I are in the same house." Rose replied.</p>
<p>"Well you're both sure to be in the same house. I'm almost positive to end up in Slytherin. It will be nice for you both to start the year with a friend in the same house." Scorpius said this cheerfully so Rose didn't notice the smile on his face was a bit forced. Rose couldn't see how this enthusiastic and overly friendly boy could ever be put into Slytherin, but she did know that he was a Malfoy so that was a big indicator that he would indeed be highly recommended for Slytherin. The conversation had lagged a little after this topic but true to form, Albus saved the say by starting a discussion about flying lessons. Rose couldn't imagine her time at Hogwarts with out Al.</p><hr/>
<p>The first years were all crowded together in the great hall with the eyes of all the older students on them. They waited in nervous anticipation for their turn to sit on that lonely little stool to be sorted by the Sorting Hat. As 'Weasley' was towards the end of the alphabet, she distracted herself while the sorting took place, knowing that her turn would be towards the very end of the ceremony. The first thing she noticed about the great hall was the sheer number of students, far more than she recalled from her parents' stories. She made a mental note to ask whether they just hadn't mentioned a lot of other students or whether the two wars had affected attendance during their time at school. The other thing she noticed, quite self consciously, was that she was the tallest of all the first years huddled together. She inherited her height from her father's side of the family, along with her vivid red hair. The bushiness of her hair was pure Granger though. Rose never quite knew nor cared about what to do with her hair so it normally started the day in a high bushy pony tale on top of her head that would slowly droop and be closer to the nape of her neck by the end of the day, allowing straggling fuzzy curls to break free all over her head which caused the habit of constantly palming the stray strands away from her head if they were in her line of sight.</p>
<p>They had reached 'L' in the line of succession to the stool, and she realised that Scorpius would soon be sorted. They must have looked a sight the three of them. Rose, the tall fuzzy red haired girl. Albus the short and unruly blacked haired boy that looked just like his father. Scorpius the average height but reed thin platinum blonde boy with a nervous energy about him. All of them were famous or infamous by proxy of their parents and all of them noticed the stares. Rose's mum knew that it must be hard for the kids and always told Rose that people will stare no matter what so when she wasn't feeling confident, just to act it. "Fake it until you make it" her mum had said. So with that she stood up straighter, took a big breath in and focused on her companions rather than the rest of the eyes in the hall that were on the three of them.</p>
<p>"Malfoy, Scorpius." Professor Taggart called out. Scorpius sighed as the room broke out into hushed murmers.</p>
<p>"See you guys. Thanks for, well, everything." Scorpius said with such sad finality and turned to commence the long walk to the stool. Before he left, Albus put his hand on the other boy's shoulder and squeezed slightly in support. Rose offered him a small smile of encouragement. Rose saw Scorpius take a calming breath as the hat was put over his head. There was a short pause until the hat called out 'SLYTHERIN!'.</p>
<p>The murmers got louder and one boy towards the back of the hall called out 'Oh, big surprise!'. Scorpius did not seem surprised by the decision, or for the comments that were coming his way and simply walked to the Slytherin table and sat down next to another first year student who had already been sorted. With the calling of the next student, the murmurs stopped and all eyes were on the next student to be sorted. 3 more students were called until "Potter, Albus" was called. Rose thought that Albus would be nervous and flattening out his hair with one of his hands which he tended to do when he was nervous, but she was surprised to see that he was ignoring the much louder chatter from the crowd as his name was called and strode towards with stool with conviction. The hat was placed upon his head and it was there for a while (32 seconds in fact, Rose had counted) and the hat finally called out "SLYTHERIN!". While Rose's heart dropped, Albus simply smiled and made his way over to the Slytherin table to sit right next to Scorpius who simply looked at him and blinked, not quite believing what he had heard.</p>
<p>Rose was in a bit of a fog so missed a large chunk of the sorting and someone had to nudge her when her name was called. She didn't remember the walk to the front of the hall, but definitely recalled the weight of the hat on her head and the deafening noise in her ear when it shouted 'GRYFFINDOR!'. Rose made her way to the Gryffindor table and sat with the other first years, glancing at the Slytherin table while absent mindedly introducing herself to others.</p><hr/>
<p>On the train ride home that year, Rose looked back on her first year at Hogwarts. While it didn't go as she expected, she had learned to thoroughly enjoy her classes and even made some new friends. She remained close to Albus and made sure to sit with him and Scorpius every Saturday for all meals, and in class whenever they shared the same subjects. She was sitting with her friend Marion, a fellow Gryffindor in their compartment when she heard her two Slytherin friends well before she saw them. The compartment door burst open, Albus and Scorpius stumbling in with handfuls of sweets from the trolley.</p>
<p>"Rosie! Look, we got goodies! I know you'll say you've already eaten lunch and don't need them but it's like an eight hour journey and you're bound to get hungry at some point. I got you pumpkin pasties and some chocolate frogs because I know you once said you preferred chocolate to sweets made of pure sugar. I think Al got you a drink," he turned to Albus, "did you get her a drink?"</p>
<p>"Yeah I remembered her drink, water and a hot tea. Drink the tea first or it'll go cold." He said to Rose while he handed the drinks over.</p>
<p>"I will, thanks Mum." Rose replied with a smirk, taking a sip of her tea. She held out her other hand to Scorpius who passed her the pasties and then the chocolate frogs. She gave a nod of thanks to Scorpius as she loaded the treats next to her.</p>
<p>"Oh, sorry – Marion right?" Scorpius asked, realising that Rose wasn't alone in the compartment. Marion gave a curt nod.</p>
<p>"Would you like something to eat, pumpkin pasty? Droobles gum? Pepper Imp? I'd offer you a chocolate frog but they're for Rose so you'll have to ask her if you want one." Scorpius rambled while holding out some of the sweets. Marion glanced at Rose, then back to Scorpius.</p>
<p>"Um, no thanks I'll pass." She turned back to Rose. "I might leave you to it, I think I'll go and find Andy and Talitha."</p>
<p>"Oh, okay. I might come and find you all later then," Rose replied, a bit disappointed her friend wasn't going to stay.</p>
<p>Marion stood up to exit the carriage but Scorpius got up a split second before she did so he could open the door for her to exit. Marion looked confused, suspicious and also a little amused by the action.</p>
<p>"Um, thank you?" she said to Scorpius.</p>
<p>"You're welcome," he replied, and waved as she exited. Rose and Albus shared an amused look as Scorpius closed the door and returned to his seat.</p>
<p>"If you keep doing things like that, no one will believe you're a Slytherin." Rose said matter of factly, taking another sip of her tea.</p>
<p>"Hufflepuffs aren't the only ones who can be chivalrous. Besides, it's just good manners." He replied.</p>
<p>"You don't open doors for me." Rose retorted lightheartedly.</p>
<p>"Firstly, you weren't the one getting up to leave and secondly, you wouldn't let me open a door for you even if I tried." He said popping a pepper imp into his mouth.</p>
<p>"Why, what did she do to you the first time you tried it?" Albus asked knowingly. It was at this moment that steam started coming out of Scorpius' ears, the after effects of the pepper imp.</p>
<p>"She used the tarantallegra jinx on me. Couldn't stop dancing for 5 minutes. Couldn't even reach the door to get myself through it." Scorpius said in a mock somber tone.</p>
<p>"Serves you right for assuming I was in need of help!" Rose explained.</p>
<p>"Didn't seem to mind when I brought you food even though you didn't ask for any. That's also just good manners." Scorpius retorted. Rose was a bit stumped. This was true.</p>
<p>"Well, I think its fair to assume that I would get hungry. There is absolutely no grounds to assume that I am too weak to open a door for myself."</p>
<p>"It's not about weakness, you're bigger than me I'm positive you'd be able to open any door by yourself. It's about being courteous, good manners and all that." He turned to Albus, "Have I not mentioned this to her already?"</p>
<p>Albus nodded, smiling. "Sure did, but arguing with Rose is a bit pointless mate. Don't know why you still bother."</p>
<p>Scorpius shrugged. "Because it's fun!"</p>
<p>Rose laughed and rolled her eyes at this. "It may be fun but only because I always win."</p>
<p>"Nah, you'll slip up one day." He said with a grin, then promptly jumped up and left the compartment.</p>
<p>"Wait, where are you going?" Albus called after him.</p>
<p>"I'll be back soon." Scorpius called back. Albus just shook his head. There was a comfortable silence for a minute until Rose spoke.</p>
<p>"He's getting more confident isn't he?" she stated.</p>
<p>"Mmm. Too confident sometimes. Doesn't know when to hold the intensity back."</p>
<p>"Ah, let him be. It's harmless." She paused, "Although I think Marion may not have appreciated the enthusiasm. How any of those arseholes can say he's Voldemort's son is completely beyond me."</p>
<p>"Yeah well, they say a lot of things." Albus replied darkly. Albus had copped a lot of flack for being in Slytherin with a lot of people speculating why the son of the Chosen One ended up in the notorious house. It didn't help that his best friend was the son of an ex (but reformed) death eater. Rose worked up the courage to say what was on her mind.</p>
<p>"Hey Al, you know I don't mind that you're in Slytherin right? I mean, it was a bit of a shock at first but I think, and don't take this the wrong way because I know a few people aren't very kind about the fact, but I think I'm glad you're in Slytherin now."</p>
<p>"How so?" Albus asked.</p>
<p>"I don't know, you just, don't take things to heart as much. You stand up for yourself more, especially with James and there's just a change. But a good change."</p>
<p>"Rose, when you spend as much time as I have with Scorpius and see how people treat him and what they say to him without it even ruffling his feathers, it tends to rub off after a while."</p>
<p>"Do you think he really isn't bothered by it?" Rose asked tentatively.</p>
<p>"Of course he is. He just knows how to make it look like it doesn't worry him."</p>
<p>Rose felt a little sad at this piece of information, but she supposed it was the same as the advice her mum had given her. Fake it till you make it. They hadn't said anything for a while but Albus suddenly broke the silence.</p>
<p>"Rose, can I tell you something?"</p>
<p>"Ah, sure?" Rose said, absently looking out the window.</p>
<p>"I chose to be in Slytherin." Rose quickly turned to look at him.</p>
<p>"What? Why? Why would you do that when-" Albus held up his hand to cut her off as he knew the beginnings of a Rose rant before it even begun.</p>
<p>"I know what you'll say, 'why did you choose to be there when it would have been easier to be in Gryffindor'. 'why would you choose to be a Slytherin when I could have been in the same house as me'. The hat was tossing up between Gryffindor and Slytherin and in the end I chose Slytherin. I figured Scorpius needed a friend more than you needed me."</p>
<p>Rose was shocked into silence. Not once had she thought that Albus had chosen this more difficult path for himself, let alone because he felt the need to help someone else out.</p>
<p>"Oh Al." Rose didn't quite know how to respond so she went with one of her default modes which was either get defensive or tackle the problem with humour.</p>
<p>"Well, how very kind and dare I say romantic of you." She said with a smirk. She had chosen humour.</p>
<p>"Shut up. You said you liked me as a Slytherin."</p>
<p>"True, but I didn't know you were a noble Slytherin. Scorpius really is setting an example isn't he?" Rose laughed. Albus chuckled along with her, knowing Rose well enough to read into the things she didn't say as well as the words she did.</p>
<p>
        <strong>Second Year: Scorpius learns about Rose's secret talent.</strong>
      </p>
<p>Scorpius really shouldn't read whilst walking. It was early on a Saturday morning and he had made himself get up early so he could walk in the school grounds to find one of the books that had fallen out of his bag after another student had so conveniently torn his bag with a spell as he was walking back from Herbology. Scorpius hadn't realised until he had reached the Slytherin common room later that evening and by that time it had gotten dark and it was dinner time. He had retrieved his book this morning which was almost frozen solid but a simple charm fixed that and he continued reading from where he had dog eared the page. That was until he became stuck in the trick step on one of the second floor staircases. He hadn't even realised what direction he was walking let alone have his wits about him to skip the step as he would usually do. As Scorpius was only in second year, no spell came to mind to be able to free himself. He would have to get out the old fashioned way, by sheer force. He tried desperately to free his leg on his own but he already knew he would need another person's help. He began to internally panic as he desperately did not want any of his tormentors to find him and take advantage of the situation. Before He could even problem solve or completely shut down in panic, he heard footsteps. It sounded as though the person was running down the steps at quite a pace, one foot on each step as they descended. Scorpius sighed, there would be no time to go into a meltdown so he just sucked in his breath and squared his shoulders and waited inevitably for the person to find him. He looked up and to his delight he saw a girl in ripped jeans, baggy t-shirt and a mop of red hair bouncing behind her as she hopped down each step. He had no idea why Rose was up so early but he was so glad it was her who would find him, or nearly run into him as it would turn out as she was to busy looking down, trying not to trip as she zoomed her way down the staircase.</p>
<p>"Woah woah woah!" Scorpius said in alarm, arms held up in case Rose ran into him during her descent. Rose had jumped at the warning and nearly tripped, but righted herself at the last moment.</p>
<p>"Bloody fudging hell, you almost gave me a heart attack! What are you doing?"</p>
<p>"Shopping for dress robes, obviously," Scorpius replied cheerfully.</p>
<p>"Oh yes, I can see that. Such a great selection." Rose replied, quirking an eyebrow.</p>
<p>"Yep, that's why I come here."</p>
<p>There was a pause. "You're stuck in the step aren't you?"</p>
<p>"Maybe."</p>
<p>Rose looked around and saw a book two stairs down from where Scorpius was stuck. She retrieved the book and eyed the title.</p>
<p>"Bathilda Bagshot's Autobiography? You were reading while walking again weren't you?"</p>
<p>"Maybe."</p>
<p>"I knew you loved her books and all things magical history but I'm beginning to think that you fancy her more than her content."</p>
<p>"Just because she wrote about history doesn't mean she isn't an important historical figure herself. Did you know that-"</p>
<p>Rose cut him off, "Scorp and Bathilda sitting in a tree-" she sang.</p>
<p>"Jokes on you, I'd love to sit in a tree with her. I could ask her a billion questions and she would have to answer because we were stuck in a tree."</p>
<p>"Now that's just weird."</p>
<p>"You started it. What are you doing up so early anyway. Don't you usually sleep until noon?" he asked, genuinely interested.</p>
<p>"Oh I was just heading down to the kitchens. Hayley was snoring so I couldn't get back to sleep. Food's as good as any excuse to get out of bed!"</p>
<p>"You know how to get into the kitchens? Hang on, no, scrap that. Second question. Why would you go to the kitchens? You sit with us on a Saturday. Are you not going to sit with us?" he asked in quick succession.</p>
<p>"To answer your questions; yes, because I am hungry, I will still sit with you and Al because this is more of a pre breakfast snack."</p>
<p>"Oh, good." He replied and then looked Rose up and down, "How can you eat so much? Most people who eat as much as you would be the size of a house. You just seem to keep-" he did a rising whistle, indicating how tall she was. It was only then he realised that he had said this out loud. He felt his cheeks warm slightly.</p>
<p>"Looks like I won't be seeing you at breakfast after all. Have fun dress robe shopping!" Rose said and began to walk away from him With her back turned Scorpius couldn't tell whether she was offended or just joking. He didn't want to take the risk.</p>
<p>"Rosie, wait. I'm still stuck. Sorry for the verbal diarrhoea. It's early and I haven't eaten and, well, you're just really tall!"</p>
<p>"Sweet Merlin Scor, you suck at apologies!"</p>
<p>"It wasn't so much an apology as a plea for help." He retorted and almost sighed in relief when she turned back and handed his book to him. Even on the step below him she was equal his height.</p>
<p>"Have you ever thought that maybe I'm not that tall, you're just that short?" she asked as she walked up a couple of stairs so she could position herself behind him and threaded her arms through his. Scorpius looked back at her.</p>
<p>"Nah Al's short, I'm normal."</p>
<p>"Scorpius Malfoy, normal? Don't think so. On the count of three. One. Two. THREE!" Rose said and she pulled him up as best she could while he lifted his leg with all his might.</p>
<p>There was a loud 'POP' and Scorpius' leg was freed. In the force of the leg freeing, they both fell backwards, Rose on her back while Scorpius rolled off to the side slightly and they slid down at least 3 steps before coming to a stop. Rose had let out a few choice expletives during the debacle. They lay sprawled out awkwardly next to each other for a few seconds before Scorpius spoke.</p>
<p>"Rosie, you okay? And thanks by the way."</p>
<p>Rose just lay there muttering and cursing, which as fairly usual for Rose so he knew she was okay. As he waited for her to finish her quiet tirade, he sat upright and picked up a piece of parchment that had settled itself above Rose's head. He picked it up.</p>
<p>"This yours?" He asked as he turned it over and saw a very detailed drawing of a venomous tentacula. Rose sat bolt upright and snatched the picture out of Scorpius' hands.</p>
<p>"It's for Herbology." She said curtly. While Rose had snatched the picture away, Scorpius could still picture it. The level of detail and shading made it look as though it was a photo. If the plant had been moving he would have though it was indeed a photo.</p>
<p>Rose's ears were turning a dark shade of red as she crumpled the picture in her right hand and aggressively held it to her side. Scorpius gasped.</p>
<p>"Don't do that, you'll wreck it!" he said, reaching for the parchment only to have Rose hold it away from him.</p>
<p>"Don't worry about it, it's just an assignment." She barked back and crumpled the paper even more as she leant on her hands to push herself up to stand. Before she was able to fully stand up, Scorpius had muttered 'accio parchment' and it whipped out of Rose's hand, ripping slightly in the middle where she was holding it the tightest, and into his own hands. Rose did not look happy.</p>
<p>"Scorpius you fucking give me that back!"</p>
<p>"No." he replied, gently unravelling the parchment which was now very crumpled and torn.</p>
<p>"Are you fucking kidding me? Give it back!" she shouted louder as he stared in awe at the picture.</p>
<p>"Did you draw this?" he asked in a small voice. The red from Rose's ears was now migrating to her face.</p>
<p>"So what if I did?" she said defensively, crossing her arms. Scorpius didn't respond for a while, simply staring at the picture. He looked up at Rose who was not making eye contact with him.</p>
<p>"I didn't know you drew."</p>
<p>"Well now you do. It's only for an assignment."</p>
<p>"Merlin if this is only for an assignment I'd love to see what you draw for fun." He said, bemused. He finally realised that Rose looked slightly mortified so he continued.</p>
<p>"Rosie, it's really good. Like, amazingly good." He looked down at the wrecked parchment. "Well, it doesn't look amazingly good any more unfortunately." At this comment, Rose quickly snatched the parchment off him and slumped down beside him on the step. She stared at the picture and Scorpius noticed her eyes starting to water.</p>
<p>"Hey, it's okay," he said, patting her on the back. "I think you're forgetting that we have magic on our side." He said and tapped his wand against the parchment while muttering a few choice spells. The rip fixed itself and the crumpled paper slowly ironed out so that it was now in pristine condition in Rose's hands.</p>
<p>"There, good as new. How did you even do that, it looks so realistic." He asked. Rose used the bottom of her t-shirt to wipe at her eyes.</p>
<p>"It's only a plant." She said wetly, giving her signature eye roll. She hadn't noticed that Scorpius' hand was still placed on her shoulder.</p>
<p>"Only a plant? Are you serious, you could get poisoned from that thing it looks so real! All you have to do to make it more real would be to. Hang on!" he said excitedly and tapped the parchment with his wand while saying an incantation. The plant started to move and writhe like a real venomous tentacular, and Rose's eyes lit up.</p>
<p>"How did you do that?" she asked, staring wide eyed at him.</p>
<p>"Nu-uh, first you tell me how you drew it in the first place."</p>
<p>"I don't know, I just draw what I see don't I?" she said defensively. "What spell did you use? Can you teach me?"</p>
<p>"Only if you show me more of your drawings."</p>
<p>"How about I tell you how to get into the kitchen instead?" she offered, knowing that the allure of constant supplies of sweet food would placate him. Scorpius stood up and then offered his hand to help her up. She looked at him with a raised eyebrow, ignoring the gesture and got to a standing position all by herself.</p>
<p>"I know you didn't need my help, I was just being-"</p>
<p>"Polite, I know. Come on, are you hungry or not?"</p>
<p>"Starving!" he said as he picked up his book and followed her down the steps. A thought occurred to him.</p>
<p>"Hey Rosie?"</p>
<p>"Yeah"</p>
<p>"Why did you have the picture with you if you were only going to the kitchen?"</p><hr/>
<p>Thanks for reading!</p></div></div></div>
