    <p align="center">I. La Maison</p>
<p>      He cursed as his body lurched forward. Annoyed, Harry sent a withering glare to the woman who slammed her shopping cart into his spine. At first, it seemed she intended to sneer right back, but her eyes shifted to his forehead, to the scar that distinguished him from all other citizens of Medeis. Her lips quivered, morphing into a sheepish smile as she murmured an apology and left the line all together. Harry turned, fighting down feelings of discontent.</p>
<p>      Twenty-five years he had been ogled at for the lightning bolt on his head, or his distinctive green eyes. He should’ve been used to it by now, but there was no helping the surge of anxiety that came with being treated like some sort of zoo animal. With a shove, he made to adjust his cap and the bag of gummy bears in his hand screeched with the threat of bursting. He loosened his tightened fist without a word. Teddy would kill him if he came home with his favorite snack ruined. His godson was moody lately, no doubt due to an odd mixture of teenage angst and girl-induced heartache. Harry supposed sweets would help. Apparently, the bloke in front of him thought along the same lines. Curious, he watched as the dark-skinned man, dressed in a manner that could only be considered avant-garde, absent-mindedly twirled the tight curls of his hair as the cashier swiped a large box of chocolates over the counter into a bag.</p>
<p>“1 galleon and 3 sickles please,” The adolescent said cheerily.</p>
<p>      The man looked through a pouch behind his phone, frowned, then began to pat his pockets, emptying them out in a flurry of business cards, thread, and scraps of sandpaper. Harry raised a brow as what looked like the insole of a shoe emerged. The cashier twitched, the first sign of annoyance, before the man ran a hand through his hair, every line in his face alluding to stress.</p>
<p>“I seem to have forgotten my card at my office,” He said, voice a deep baritone. Setting his hands on his hips, he sighed deeply, self-loathing evident, and Harry felt his heart go out to him. He was just another working class man, trying to make ends meet. He fucked up bigtime, if the size of the box was anything to go by, and this really didn’t seem to be like one of his better days. Weird clothes or not, a person was a person, and everyone deserved a pick-me-up when they were down.</p>
<p>“I can take care of it.” The man’s brow furrowed, gratitude and relief letting his shoulders sag.</p>
<p>“Are you sure?” Harry nodded, handing the cashier to swipe the gummy bears too, before inserting his card into the little machine. The man stood a respectful distance away, thanking him profusely.</p>
<p>“You’re so kind Mr. Potter. A true humanitarian, just like your mother.” The cashier handed the bag to him, and he ignored the way the compliment stung, tipping his baseball cap out of politeness as he made way for the next customer. The man followed him out of the store, even after he handed off the chocolates. He stood in front of him, sticking out his hand. Harry looked down at it, then up at the honest determination in the man’s eyes.</p>
<p>“Zabini. Blaise Zabini.” They shook on it, never breaking eye contact.</p>
<p>“Potter. Harry Potter.” There was no sudden tension, no flash of recognition in the other’s eyes.</p>
<p><em>‘He doesn’t know who I am,’</em> Harry realized. A giddy feeling overcame him as he found himself giving a genuine grin. The bloke- Blaise- gestured to his right, words slipping past his lips like silk.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I know my wallet is in my office. It’s only a five-minute walk around the corner. I can’t let you go without paying you back. My mother raised me better than that.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">      Harry considered the proposition. Casting a glance back at his Harley, he nodded, and allowed himself to be led away. Blaise filled the silence between them with talk about work. He and his company recently came from Italy. Alluding to the odd collection in his pockets, he clarified that he was in the business of constructing shoes and handbags for the elites of the world.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The lowest I’ve sold a handbag for was 100 galleons. Can you believe that? Granted, it was for a friend of a family friend and my family doesn’t really associate with poor people and-,”</p>
<p dir="ltr">He rambled on and on, digging keys out of his pocket as they rounded the corner to face one of the largest buildings in the city: The Tower. Uncomfortable, Harry looked about, taking note of the green cobblestones and silver lampposts.</p>
<p dir="ltr">       Medeis was divided into 4 sections. While he and Teddy lived in the safety and tranquility of suburban Godric’s Hollow, he had never felt the need to venture into Salazar’s District. He wrinkled his nose. <em>‘Sin City’</em>, they called it. It had all the hustle and bustle of Manchester mixed with the scandals of London to form a cold, cut-throat metropolitan not intended for the weak-of-heart.</p>
<p dir="ltr">     Blaise didn’t notice his discomfort. He just kept on his cheery smile, pushing Harry through the glass doors, past the curvy receptionist with little more than a <em>“Ta, Millie!”</em> and into the elevators. It was here that things began to get weird. Harry’s companion fell silent, face going nonchalant and eyes losing their spark.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Um, you alright mate?”</p>
<p dir="ltr">     The man hummed in response, staring as the numbers switched till they hit the seventh floor. Harry was tugged along with him through a crowded room. Fabric and thread was all around as the whirring of an air conditioner rang constant in the background of multiple conversations.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Found one,” Blaise announced to the room at large.</p>
<p dir="ltr">      He released Harry as everyone began to stare, making his way to a desk in the corner to work on what looked like a pair of stilettos. Silence reigned. Nervous and thoroughly confused, Harry turned about to find these people, all dressed in white lab coats, pausing with thread in their teeth or needles in their hands to look him over. He felt their eyes roam over him, criticizing him, making him want to shrink into a ball and roll away.</p>
<p dir="ltr">     A woman rose. She was the only one wearing color it seemed. Granted, her outfit was all black, but it still proved to be a contrast. She strode right up to him, expression as severe as the cut of her sharp, black bob. Laying hands on his face, her grip twisted him, sharp nails digging into his cheeks as her kohl-rimmed eyes narrowed in on his jawline. Up close, he could see the dark bags underneath her faded green irises, the smudge of paint on her cheekbone, the number of piercings weighing down her ears.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As if sensing where his gaze lingered, she brought her nails up to nudge the arrow that <em>went-through her-bloody-earlobe-Christ</em>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I’ll take him,” She said resolutely, a smirk creeping up her scarlet lips. As quick as it came, it was cast off with the voice of a newcomer.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Hands off Parkinson. He’s mine.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">       A man came whirling around the corner, slicked back hair gleaming in the fluorescent light bright enough to combat the shine of his oxfords. He stopped and did the same as Parkinson, pressing his hands against Harry’s neck tightly enough for his watch to leave an indent in his collarbone. Once again, it was the jawbone, cheek structure and the eyes that were subject to observation. Then the man turned Harry about like a ragdoll, looking him over as one would a piece of meat before purchase. He was close enough for Harry to smell his cologne. Nose twitching, he recognized the scent as one his own Godfather used to wear.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">
  <em> Saint Laurent La Nuit. </em>
</p>
<p dir="ltr">      It was the only trace of his upper class upbringing Harry found on Sirius. His Godfather wasn’t one to be flashy about wealth. But this man, the one standing before him with a blasé expression interrupted by the curiosity in his dark eyes, had no qualms about attention.</p>
<p dir="ltr">From the Rolex on his wrist to the ‘LV’ on his belt, the man bled upper-class. Snapping his suspenders, he rolled up his white sleeves (Harry eyed the scripted tattoo against olive skin with interest) and whipped out measuring tape from back pocket.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Approximately 5’10. A bit short but the jaw structure makes up for it. Somebody write this down! 158 in total height! Long legs, 90 centimeters-!” The woman, Parkinson, slapped the device out of his hand, face contorting into one of rage.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Don’t even try it Nott! My model bailed on me weeks ago! I asked for a replacement first!”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Your collection is practically done! I’ve literally two months to pull this thing together before he-,”</p>
<p dir="ltr">
  <em>“Before he what?” </em>
</p>
<p dir="ltr">      Something gripped his core when the latest addition to the motley crew glided through the door. It was this something that spun gold out of Harry’s insides, and made his eyes see comets and stars where there should have been ruin. His breath caught, stilling in his lungs long enough for his head to begin to believe that he was drowning. Whatever complaint longed to leave his lips fell away as his mouth forgot speech. Then gray eyes met his, icy and sharp enough to hit his core and cover the gold with snow.</p>
<p dir="ltr">     The man stopped, stood unwavering with legs almost too long for his trousers, ankles pale as powder peeking out from under the black cloth before disappearing once more into the suede of his loafers. Stretching his arms wide, the two women at his side removed his white coat for him, letting him step out, figure slim in a dress shirt and blazer. Blonde hair sat, immaculate, crowning his head in a platinum halo. Lips thin and pursed, the man analyzed the scene before him, eyes switching from the three central characters with nothing short of annoyance and disappointment.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“What’s going on here?” The drawl sent shivers down Harry’s spine. No one dared to speak. The man shot a look at the surrounding workers and immediately they snapped to it, sewing and sketching as if the devil were on their heels.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Well?” His demand was low, but nonetheless fear-inducing as he strode forward. “Pansy? Theodore? You were both so vocal before.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Theo’s trying to snatch my model,” Pansy huffed, crossing her arms.</p>
<p>“<em>Your</em> model? Blaise said he could find someone for <em>me!</em>”</p>
<p>“Please, I asked for another male weeks ago and you know it. Antonio left me back in October. When did Desmond disappear? This morning?”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Two days ago,” Theo gritted out.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“That’s what you get for stealing some of my workers. Karma’s a bitch.” Pansy shrugged, throwing her arm around Harry’s shoulders. The man snaked his own around Harry’s waist, tugging softly.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“What I get is a new male model. Piss off Pans.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Make me <em>darling</em>.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Tension rose as the two glared in a standoff. The blond stepped between, laying a hand on Harry’s shoulder, he pulled him forward, looking down at him with nonchalance.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Who are you?”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Harry Potter,” There were some startled gasps throughout the room, but the three surrounding him betrayed no sense of surprise.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>‘Foreigners,’</em> He realized, as they broke off, speaking rapidly in a language he didn’t know, occasionally throwing glances his way.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I’m Draco Malfoy.” The accent dipped in a manner Harry presumed was French. His voice was bland, a quiet drawl devoid of any emotion other than indifference and the undertone of disdain. </p>
<p dir="ltr">“You may address me as Mr. Malfoy or not at all. You will be working with <strong>both</strong> Mr. Nott and Ms. Parkinson and they will split your time <strong>equally</strong>,”</p>
<p dir="ltr">He glanced at the two, lips curled as they reddened.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We’re eager to have you on the team. Welcome to the House.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Twice, he snapped his fingers. They were those of a pianist, thin and delicate to the point Harry feared they might snap.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Come, Astoria.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">      The woman with his coat, a pretty one with dark brown curls falling to her waist, started and flounced in his shadow. Throwing a curious, wide-eyed glance Harry’s way, she grinned and waved before Draco hurried her along.</p>
<p dir="ltr">     This left him with the wolves. Pansy took one long look at Theo before her knee came up and then Harry was wincing, phantom pain stinging his prick as he witnessed the man keel over and go down. With the pinch of her nails in his arms, she stole him away, spirting down the hall in the opposite direction of her boss.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“My name’s Pansy Parkinson. I’m in charge of the <em>Pret-A-Porter</em> Division this season. Very pleased to meet you Mr....Pitch , was it?”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Harry struggled to keep up with her pace. Even in 6 inch heels, she was as fast as a track star, dodging incoming workers and racks of clothes with precision.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“No, it’s Potter. ‘scuse, but I think there’s been a misunderstanding, I’m not a-,”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Well, as you probably already know Fashion Week is coming up. You’re not committed to any other designers are you?”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Pansy stopped. Harry blinked.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Good,” she continued. “I’ll get your measurements now and we’ll worry about paperwork when Draco’s less busy.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Uh-,”</p>
<p dir="ltr">     She released him, digging into the pocket of her cardigan for a key. Sighing, she casually threw over her shoulder,</p>
<p dir="ltr">“So, it’ll be approximately 180 galleons for each day you stand for us, and 900 for each show you do. So all in all, you have the potential to earn 6,000 galleons in a month. We’ll have you on for at least three, then you add the bonus for successfully walking the show and, well you do the math.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">   His mouth snapped shut as the words left him reeling. He could get Teddy some new clothes with that kind of money. He could get Teddy a <em>car</em> with that money. Heck, he could get Teddy a <em>lifetime supply</em> of gummy bears with that money. Seeing his reaction, Pansy smirked, kicking open the door.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Are you in?”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“You know it.” She laughed, wild and free and true, as her eyes took on an excited glint.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Welcome to the House.”</p><hr/>
<p dir="ltr"> </p>
<p dir="ltr">      He collapsed through the front door around half past 9. It was the scent of chicken curry, potatoes and corn wafting through the kitchen that rejuvenated him, drawing him in to a seat by the table.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Oh, <em>Harry</em>, look at you. You had a long day today didn’t you?”</p>
<p dir="ltr">     The scents of fresh ink, coffee beans and vanilla mixed to form an awareness so distinctly Hermione as she left her book to rub his shoulders. Her curls were forced into a messy bun atop her head, making it look like a pineapple of sorts. Her eyes, deep brown and calculating, tried to see through him, as if she could real his ailments on his soul. She probably could. He wouldn’t put it past her. Mione was studying to be a lawyer after all, and those types were oddly perceptive.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“You don’t know the half of it,” Harry mumbled.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I’m making dinner mate. Give me a couple mins and it’ll be right out,” Ron peeked out at him from in front of the stove. He grinned, red hair wild, as a waft of cilantro and basil went through the air. “Luna and Rolf are coming over too so we’ll need 6 places set.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">      Hermione got to it, brown hands weaving through the air as she brought plates and cutlery to the table. Harry watched as she bustled, folding napkins before settling them atop white plates.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“How was he?” He asked absentmindedly, nodding in the direction of the living room. The croons of Johnny Rotten came streaming in. Teddy had gotten into his father’s old records again, and was definitely having a ball if the sounds of jumping were anything to go by.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“An angel,” Hermione cooed. She settled back in with her book. “No trouble at all.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">      The devil came when summoned, blue hair sticking to his forehead in a light sheen of sweat as he burst into the kitchen. Upon seeing Harry, he stopped, eyes wide, and tried to back away. Rolling his eyes, Harry took the pack of gummy bears out of his pocket and threw it. His godson had no trouble snatching it out of the air. Contently, Teddy chewed, eyes turning emerald green all the while.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Wotcher Harry,” He said with a wink. And, for a moment, Harry saw his blue hair as bubblegum pink, before it turned jet black.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I hope you found the remote,” He said, swallowing the lump in his throat. The teen’s smile froze, too wide to be genuine as he went to hide behind Hermione’s skirts.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It’s not in this house,” Teddy’s voice was too high.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“If I get up and find it Teddy I swear-,” The boy yelped, fleeing the kitchen with candy in hand as Ron and Hermione laughed aloud. Harry smiled to himself, tiredly nestling into his folded arms.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“You should really stop teasing him,” Ron said from afar.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Please. Remus and Tonks would roll over in their graves, and I’m not going to go against his parents’ wishes.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Hermione pursed her lips, clearing her throat as she glanced up from her book, and those knowing eyes stuck onto him.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“They would be proud of you,” She said softly. “It’s hard, but you’re making ends meet.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Silence reigned, punctured only by the crackle of the pan or Teddy’s loud singing. Harry couldn’t maintain eye contact for very long, glancing at the photo of the couple that watched over them all, baby Teddy dozing off in their arms.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I just...I don’t know how this is supposed to work. It’s not like I had parents to teach me what to do. The closest I had was the Weasleys,”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“<em>Ayyyy,</em>” Ron did a little jig, breaking the somber mood.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“But staying with your best friend’s family doesn’t teach you how to raise a kid, or discipline one for the matter. Ted and I had this huge row this morning, yeah? Didn’t want to clean his room and <em>the remote has mysteriously gone missing-</em>,”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Found it!” Teddy shouted back. Harry rolled his eyes.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“And I’m sure I’m supposed to ground him in this situation. But, how does that work? Am I supposed to keep him in the house? Do I take away electronics? I want to be fair but what punishment would suit the crime of not cleaning up a room?”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The couple exchanged a look, but the doorbell rang before either could answer.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Don’t run!” Harry hollered, but it too late. Teddy was already slipping on the carpet to land in front of the door.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Auntie Lu and Uncle Ro!” He heard the boy exclaim. The two fawned over the boy before stepping into the kitchen.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Hullo,” Rolf said in that quiet way of his. He brought Harry into an embrace, fresh rain dropping from his swarthy skin to hit Harry’s jacket. Luna was next, enveloping him in a haze of lavender and blonde wisps.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“You’ve met him,” She murmured against his ear, breath cool and fleeting.</p>
<p dir="ltr">     He didn’t understand until she stepped back and he got a true look at her. Her blue irises were rimmed with violet; the telltale sign of a Seer at work. Soft hands finding their way into Teddy’s hair, she regarded him with a serene smile.</p>
<p dir="ltr">      Her blonde tendrils began to curl and rise with a force Harry couldn’t comprehend. A collective chill went through those in the room, save Teddy, who amused himself by morphing to look like the woman at his side.</p>
<p dir="ltr">       Medeis had quite a few of these individuals. Those blessed with power beyond human understanding. Teddy’s mother, Tonks, had been one, and she passed her abilities onto her son. Luna was one, and was the only person Harry could trust with instructing this teen with this aspect of himself. So whenever Hermione and Ron couldn’t babysit, Luna and Rolf would gladly take over.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But it seemed Teddy wouldn’t really need a babysitter anymore. Harry considered the thought, observing how the boy was now Luna’s equivalent in height.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Harry’s told a lie,” Luna announced to the room. Rolf didn’t flinch, nibbling on a biscuit. He was subject to his fiancée’s visions first, and would know the future as soon as she did. Luna was just coming down from her celestial high, and surely informed him of all she knew before they came.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Her fingertips left Teddy’s hair to stroke Harry’s cheek, soft and supple against the skin.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“This is a blessing, especially for you. The ends justify the means I suppose.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sighing deep, she turned away.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Don’t let Hermione cook tomorrow. The lasagna will burn.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I didn’t need to be psychic to know that!” Ron said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">      The kitchen erupted in laughter as the law student spluttered indignantly. Eventually, they settled down. Food on the table, music playing in the back and wine freely poured, they dug in, making idle conversation as they did every night. Being neighbors, group dinners were easy and convenient for the days Harry came home too late to make food. The social aspect was good too. Harry shrugged off his jacket, rubbing his hands against his jeans as he sat back, content with the bulge of his stomach and the people before him.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“You shouldn’t eat too much,” Luna said, eyes back to normal. “Draco will get angry if you gain weight.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Ron choked on his curry. It took three firm pats on the back to get him to talk again.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Draco as in Draco Malfoy?” He practically shrieked in his panic, ears rapidly turning violet.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“You know him?”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Do I know him? Blimey, mate, he made my life a living hell back in primary. Rich as the Queen and smart as hell but a mean one he was. I suppose it was all his parents fault of course.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“What was wrong with his parents?” Ron glanced at Teddy, and immediately Rolf tried to distract the teen with pictures of his dog.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The redhead leaned in conspiratorially,</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Bigots, the lot of ‘em. Racists. Homophobes. Islamophobes, you name it. They’re rich as hell, yeah? So a lot of their money went to the BNP if I remember it right.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">He lay a hand on Hermione’s shoulder as if to apologize, but continued none the less.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The guy was a total prick to anyone he didn’t deem worthy. He had his little gang terrorize kids. Remember the Patil twins? The ones we went to the Yule Ball with in uni? They weren’t even Muslim, but after the whole fiasco in Paris, they got the worst of it, especially from Malfoy. I remember they got sent home crying ‘cause someone hung their panties on the flagpole. We all knew it was on Malfoy’s order of course. I never liked him. He always cheated during football matches too...used his hands so much you would think we were playing rugby,”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Taking a sip of his wine, he shifted to wrap his arm about his girlfriend’s shoulders.</p>
<p dir="ltr"> “Last I heard about his family, it was something with his Aunt. Bellatrix Lestrange. Absolute lunatic she was. Get this, yeah? She got arrested for kidnapping a kid. Kept the poor tyke in her house for a solid six months before the Aurors came around. Then there was the whole hostage-shootout situation. The story just about rocked the socks off of Birmingham. It was around then that Mum and Dad packed up and moved us to the Burrow.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“What happened to Lestrange?” Harry inquired, morbidly curious.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Life sentence,” Ron said simply. “She shot an Auror in the arm. He lived of course, but she’s still doing a stint in Azkaban. It runs in the family I think. His dad was locked up a while back on embezzlement charges.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“What were you doing with a man like that Harry?”</p>
<p dir="ltr">      Hermione’s voice didn’t hold any accusations. Carefully neutral, she didn’t shy away from his gaze as he struggled to find an answer. It was fine, it seemed, since Luna piped up.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“He’s going to model for him of course. Harry’s going to walk in Paris Fashion Week this January, and February too since he’s doing Theo’s collection.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">He stared at Luna, weary of how much she knew. The woman only smiled softly.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“And to think two days ago we were making fun of the blokes in front of Burberry,” Teddy snickered. The teen took the news well, lips curled in great amusement as he regarded his godfather.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“But I thought you were working in the garage today? Didn’t you have to fix someone’s engine?” Rolf questioned.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Is that why you came home so late? Too busy taking pictures for white supremacists?”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Harry shook his head fiercely as Hermione sipped at her wine. Her brown eyes frosted over and that neutrality fell into a stoic iciness.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“No. Listen, I was in the grocery getting some gummy bears when I met this bloke Blaise-,”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Whatever happened to not talking to strangers?”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“That’s not the point! Anyway, I’m going with this guy to his office-,”</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong><em>“Work place booty call!”</em> </strong>Ron yelled.</p>
<p dir="ltr">      Teddy howled with laughter, giggles only increasing when Harry protested. Soon, it became a chant. The two stood and screamed it, skipping and jumping out of the kitchen to the tune. Harry rolled his eyes, expecting to share an exasperated look with Hermione but she only raised her brows, shrugging.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“That’s what you get,” She said, getting up to clear the plates.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Mione, I didn’t even know.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Your vibe attracts your tribe,” Rolf said. Luna nodded solemnly.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I’m only in it for the money.” Hermione made a sound of disbelief. “They may not even take me anyway. When they realize I’m not actually some high fashion model, they’ll turn me away.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“No they won’t.” Luna said. Rolf nodded solemnly.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Harry gave up on them. Carefully, he approached his friend as she began washing up, grabbing a dishtowel. He began to try to reason with her, using hushed, soothing tones to get her to see his point of view. </p>
<p dir="ltr">“I’m not even working with him. I’m working with some woman named Pansy and this guy Theo. I’ll barely see him.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“You two are going to end up really close,” Luna said quietly. Harry didn’t want to turn around to see Rolf nod.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I need the money for Teddy,” He said lowly. She looked at him then. Up to her elbows in soap suds, she sighed and shook her head. Slowly, deliberately, she cast her gaze at the picture frame next to the window, a newspaper clipping.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="center">
  <strong>‘Billionaire James Potter Dead in Horrifying Car Crash: Heir to Throne Sprung into Fame’</strong>
</p>
<p dir="ltr">His father, dressed to the nines with his arm around his mother, gave a wave from the photo, eyes crinkled with joy.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Oh Harry...," She sighed, averting her gaze as a crease of worry nestled between her brow. "No, you don’t.”</p>
