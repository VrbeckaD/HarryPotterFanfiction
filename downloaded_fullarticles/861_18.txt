    <p>
  <span>“Nico.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I groaned and swatted the hand off my shoulder.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nico.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I pulled the pillow over my head.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nico!” The blankets were yanked off of me and I fell to the floor with a yelp. A beautiful blonde with tan skin smirked down at me. “Time to get up, Death Breath.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I frowned at my husband and sat up.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not a morning person. You know this.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yep!” He pulled me to my feet. “Come on; I made breakfast.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>That woke me up a bit.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Alright. Just let me change first.” I pushed him onto the bed before opening my dresser. Will huffed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is that any way to treat the love of your life?” He pouted. I turned to him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re right.” I leaned down, clasping the back of his neck, and kissed him. I deliberately made it slow and lazy. When we broke apart, he was grinning. “Is that better, Sunshine?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Much. But you still have Death Breath,” he laughed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I scoffed and turned back to pulling on my clothes. Feeling nostalgic, I tugged a black Camp Half-Blood shirt over my head. Pulling on a pair of jeans, I turned to let my husband get a look. He smiled.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Good choice. Now come eat.” Will took my hand and pulled me out of the bedroom. We’d been married for five years now, and every day just kept getting better. Even after I’d told him that he didn’t have to cook breakfast every morning, he still did. I loved it, but I would never tell anyone else that.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So, Will, any plans for today?” I asked as I took a bite of my scrambled eggs.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He shrugged. “I have to work at the hospital today, but other than that, there’s nothing. What about you?” He smiled. I frowned.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Chiron called me yesterday. He said Hecate personally came to Camp, asking for me. I told him I’d head over today to see what was going on. Hopefully it isn’t another quest.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hopefully.” Will nodded. “How are you going to get there without the car?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I smirked. “Shadow-travel, of course. How else would I get there?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“A train. You know, like a normal person. Shadow-traveling is dangerous.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So is a train. I’m just choosing the one that’s less likely to kill multiple people instead of just the one,” I explained. He frowned but didn’t argue. We quickly finished our meals and cleaned up our mess. We kissed before he headed out the front door.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll see you tonight!” he called as the door shut. I sighed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I really hope it’s not a new quest.” I packed a small bag of ambrosia and a vial of nectar. You never knew when it came to Camp Half-Blood. Taking one last look around, I stepped back and let the shadows envelope me.</span>
</p>
<hr/><p>
  <span>“Percy Jackson.” I smirked the moment I stepped out of the shadows. The Son of Poseidon jumped and slashed Riptide toward me. I blocked with my own sword.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t do that, Nico!” he shouted. Then his eyes widened. “Nico!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I couldn’t run from the noogie that followed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey! Let go of me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s been forever, cuz! How’ve you been?” He let go of me and looked me up and down. “You got older.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m only 26. If anything, </span>
  <em>
    <span>you</span>
  </em>
  <span> got older.” I rolled my eyes. In the six months since I’ve seen him, he certainly hasn’t gotten any more childish. His black hair was just as long as the last time I saw him, if not a little disheveled. I smoothed down my own hair. “How’s Annabeth?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She doing fine. With a baby on the way, she’s been reading up on parenting nonstop and telling me to do the same.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Pregnant? How far along?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Three months. How’s Will?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I smiled at the thought of my husband. “He still makes breakfast every morning and he’s finally been promoted to a doctor now.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Seriously? Well, congratulations, Neeks.” He grinned. “So, your hair is still a mullet.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I rolled my eyes. I found myself doing that a lot around him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Will likes it.” I crossed my arms defensively. “He says it’s good for my look as this one cartoon character. He’s getting me some fingerless gloves and a red jacket to complete the look.” Percy had the nerve to roll his eyes. He laughed, and I couldn’t help but laugh along. A lot has changed over the years, but I’m okay with it. Percy calmed down long after I did.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So, Neeks, what brings you to Camp?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Chiron called me. Apparently Hecate needs me for something.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>His smile dropped.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Another quest?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know. Will and I hope not.” I couldn’t help but agree with his concern. A goddess personally came down from Olympus to see me. Something big was either happening or going to happen. We were scared, to be perfectly honest.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I shouldn’t be delaying you, then.” Percy smiled. He wrapped his arms around me, and I reluctantly hugged him back. I still didn’t much like physical contact from anyone other than Will. He slipped away after a short while.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“See you later, Percy.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We should really come up with a time to properly catch up,” Percy called out as he disappeared toward the training grounds. I shadow-traveled to the Big House, startling Chiron. He very nearly kicked me in the head.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nico!” The centaur clutched at the area above his heart. “You shouldn’t do that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Funny, Percy said the same thing.” I glanced around him and saw a woman with pale-ish skin, long black hair, and a dress made of flowers. I assumed this was Hecate. She smiled at me.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hello, Mr. Solangelo.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Lady Hecate.” I bowed respectfully. “You wanted to see me?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, I did. Do you know of a certain school in England for my followers?” She started walking, and I followed beside her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know of your American school, Ivermory. A lot of your children from here go there.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes. Well, in England, Hogwarts functions basically the same as Ivermory. Students are placed in houses based on the traits they most believe in and strive for. Once placed, the students go to classes to learn about the different kinds of magic they can cast.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not to be rude, but what does that have to do with me?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“There are many threats against those students despite all attempts to protect them from magical dangers. I had hoped that a demigod, preferably one as powerful as you, could sustain their Defense Against the Dark Arts class and protect the students for at least a year.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is that all this is? Why couldn’t you ask one of your kids?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You have the power best suited to protect these kids from whatever could happen. Will you accept?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I stared at my feet as I thought. There were so many things that could go wrong. I could be killed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But what else is new?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What happens if I don’t?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll ask Percy Jackson. I would like to avoid bringing him into this for his, his wife’s, and their child’s sakes.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I tensed and didn’t even hesitate to answer.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I won’t be the reason Annabeth becomes a widow. I’ll do it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She smiled even as my stomach twisted in my gut. How was Will going to react?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you.” She reached into her dress and pulled out a letter. “This will explain everything. If you have any questions, write them on the back. You’ll get your answer.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I took it from her hand. There was nothing on the front, and the wax sealing it had a shield on it. At least, I think it was a shield. She started to glow, and I turned away. Once she was gone, the letter in my hand felt heavier. Gods, what was I going to tell the others? What was I going to tell Will?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I felt a rage I hadn’t felt in years. Will had only just gotten his degree, had a great job, and now I would have to either move him across the sea, or leave him behind. Why the Hades did I always have to be dragged into these situations?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I tucked the letter into my pocket and left to find Percy.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I could really use a sparring partner right now.</span>
</p><hr/><p>
  <span>“Hey, Neeks!” Percy greeted as he sliced a dummy in half. “You got done quick. Was it another quest?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I didn’t answer him. I drew my sword and took my stance. His smile fell.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He nodded in understanding and took his own stance. I didn’t even wait to attack.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>After a few hours of fighting, we agreed to a truce. I was getting tired and my rage had left. Percy flopped on the grass.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Okay,” he panted. “You ready to talk now?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I nodded and sat down next to him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hecate needs a teacher for her wizarding school in England. I’m one of the strongest demigods that can protect the students from potential dangers.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Did you accept?” Percy sat up, deathly serious.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It was either me or you, and I couldn’t do that to Annabeth. With you two about to have a baby, it wouldn’t be safe for her to travel overseas to a gloomy place like England. Besides, no teacher has ever held that position for more than a year.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He blinked and stared for a second.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You...you did that for me?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re like my brother, Percy. Why wouldn’t I?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He smiled and lightly punched my arm.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I consider you a brother, too.” He lay back down, and I followed suit. The weather was fair here--as it always was--but this time I just couldn’t enjoy it. The letter felt like a rock in my pocket, and I couldn’t take it anymore. I pulled it out and ripped open the seal. Percy sat up again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What’s that?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s from Hecate,” I answered without looking at him. “She said this would explain everything better since she’s always busy.” I tuned the rest of the world out as I read.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>

</p><p>
  <span>I huffed and tucked the letter back into my pocket. Percy tilted his head at me.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You alright?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, not really. I have to go.” I stood and helped Percy to his feet. “I’ll be back in a few days to say goodbye.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Alright. I’ll see you then. Tell Will I said ‘hi’ for me, okay?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sure, Perce. I’ll see you soon.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I closed my eyes and let the shadows take me back to my home.</span>
