    <p>
  <strong>Now</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We’re </span>
  <em>
    <span>Healers, </span>
  </em>
  <span>not </span>
  <em>
    <span>Aurors,”</span>
  </em>
  <span> Monterys Velaryon says, fear and fright balancing in his cut-glass voice and setting Sansa’s teeth on edge. “We can’t be expected to defend the bloody hospital from </span>
  <em>
    <span>Dragonborn.”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Sansa watches the Healers proper, in their lime green robes, as they assemble across the reception. The charmed doors are straining against the onslaught of hexes from outside, warping into rainbow shards of reality and spell.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sansa’s robes are the tourmaline blue of a Healer-in-training, but her wand works just as well as any Healer’s, and she’s better at defensive charmwork than anyone else in Britain, except maybe Mum.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I expect it of myself, Monterys,” she says, stepping forward and tucking her sleeves back on themselves, to free up her hands, before drawing her wand from its holster along her thigh. “But then, </span>
  <em>
    <span>I’m </span>
  </em>
  <span>not the next best thing to a Targaryen, am I?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her wand is English oak, ten and a half inches, firm but not unyielding - her core is unicorn hair, </span>
  <em>
    <span>for your pure heart, </span>
  </em>
  <span>Joffrey used to sneer.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Faint heart never won fair lady, Sansa’s heard, but maybe a pure heart or two can win this war.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We want to be Healers,” she says, settling into the duelling stance she and Robb used to copy from watching Lya and Ben practice, years and years ago. A more practical stance than the formal stance Joy Lannister has taken up, a firmer stance than the loose set of Durran Bar Emmon’s feet on the tiled floor. “More than that, we want to be Healers in </span>
  <em>
    <span>Saint Mungo’s.”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“Your point, Stark?” Monterys says, and Sansa flashes him a smile before the fear can set in.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If we don’t stand and fight,” she says, “there might not </span>
  <em>
    <span>be</span>
  </em>
  <span> a Saint Mungo’s.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Before</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So </span>
  <em>
    <span>you’re </span>
  </em>
  <span>the newest Stark to join the roster,” someone says, coming to halt at Sansa’s table. She’s finding it a little harder than she’d like to make friends in Ravenclaw - she comes from a long, steady line of Gryffindors and Hufflepuffs on both sides, and while she’s always been a little wary of classifying a person’s personality on the basis of their house, well, Ravenclaw is just very different to what she’s used to. It’s much quieter, if nothing else.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The boy standing in front of the table, where she’s sitting alone in a shadowed corner of the library, is blonde, and good-looking, and wearing a Gryffindor tie.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Joff Baratheon,” he says. “I hear your old man and mine were close, back in the day.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sansa doesn’t say that Dad and Robert Baratheon are </span>
  <em>
    <span>still </span>
  </em>
  <span>close, but that they don’t visit one another because Mum can’t stand Robert’s beautiful, mean-spirited wife. She doesn’t say that she’s met Joffrey before, half a dozen times, or that she’s fairly sure that Arya and his sister are best friends, because Dad brings Arya to that underage Quidditch club in Edinburgh twice a week and Arya always talks about a girl called </span>
  <em>
    <span>Cella </span>
  </em>
  <span>when she comes back.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Instead, Sansa smiles, because she really does need to make some friends, and doesn’t care that Joffrey is a year older than her and in a different house.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sansa Stark,” she says. “I hear your old man was the best Beater Gryffindor ever saw, back in the day.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A little flattery, she knows, will get you anywhere, and Joffrey’s smile is worth the very slight lie - she’s not been here a full month and she already knows that </span>
  <em>
    <span>Robb</span>
  </em>
  <span> is shaping up to be the best Beater Gryffindor has ever seen. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I take after my mother’s family more,” Joffrey says, picking dust that Sansa can’t see from his robes. “A Seeker - or at least, I </span>
  <em>
    <span>should</span>
  </em>
  <span> be. But you know how it is.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Robb is enough older than Sansa that she doesn’t really know how it is - he’s in fourth year, with fourth year friends and fourth year gossip, and she can’t always follow the thread of whatever he’s telling her. She does know, however, that the current Gryffindor Seeker is a Blackwood, and that he’s </span>
  <em>
    <span>good.</span>
  </em>
  <span> The kind of good that Arya will be, eventually.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sure,” she says, because that seems diplomatic and inoffensive.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you play?” he asks, but he doesn’t give her a chance to answer. “I hope not - I’ve never approved of girls playing Quidditch. It’s much too rough and tumble.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sansa thinks of Arya, flying rings around Robb and Jon and Uncle Ben over the orchard, of Aunt Lyanna, who could have gone on to play professionally if it hadn’t been for the Scandal, of Mum, even, Mum who’d led the Hufflepuff team to two consecutive Quidditch Cups in her sixth and seventh years at Hogwarts.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, really?” she says, because he must be joking, and he gives her another of those good-looking smiles, so it’s alright, really.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Isn’t it? Everyone makes concessions to make friends, don’t they?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>Now</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>There are tabs in the sleeves of their robes, to hold back the wide cuffs when they need to get their hands dirty - Sansa ties hers off with a flick of her wand, and does Durran’s when she sees that his hands are shaking. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We can’t let them breach the lobby,” Head Healer Martell says - his wheelchair creaks, but no one looks doubtful of his capability. They’ve all seen that wheelchair in action, and more importantly, they all know Doran Martell. The staff of Saint Mungo’s trust one another implicitly, in a way that had stunned Sansa at first, and she’s thankful of it now.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her wand feels heavy in her hand, suddenly, and she’s beside Willas without thinking about it. There are others drifting in among the Healers, too, blue robes dark and too few between the green, but she stays firmly where she is, guarding his weak left - his false leg hasn’t half the bells and whistles of Healer Martell’s chair, after all. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You could leave now,” he tells her, out of the side of his mouth. His eyes flash to hers, behind his glasses and around hers. “You could Apparate out, Sansa, to safety, or to get help-”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I saw your Patronus leave the moment the alarms sounded,” she says, nudging her arm very slightly against his. “I don’t need to get help - you’ve already sent for it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The lobby is very quiet, then, as they all settle into position, as they all offer up whatever prayers they think necessary. Sansa wonders, for a second, just who Willas sent his Patronus to fetch - did he send it to his brother in the Auror Office, or to his father in the Minister’s office? Or maybe it was to his grandmother, at Hogwarts, to rouse Professor Lannister and Mum and all their allies?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It doesn’t matter. What matters is he sent it, but it’s not going to be quick enough. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“When this is over,” he says, voice unusually uncertain, “and we’re both alive to laugh about it - we’re going to talk. We’re going to sit down and talk about everything, Sansa.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She loosens her hold on her wand for just a second, lowers her arm so she can link her smallest finger with his for a heartbeat, and nods.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We have to survive this first,” she reminds him, and he smiles.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“There is no way in hell I am going to let you die now, Sansa,” he assures her. “You’re not allowed to leave before we have that talk.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Before</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ravenclaw takes some settling, but she gets there, and she makes friends - a few, enough - and joins the Charms Club, which Mum runs, and the Duelling Club, because she may as well, and very much doesn’t even attempt to try out for Quidditch.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It’s not what Joffrey said - well, not entirely. Mostly it’s because she’s always been the worst flier in the family, and she doesn’t think that her housemates would laugh as kindly as her brothers and Arya always do. Sansa can’t stand being embarrassed, and she’s already been embarrassed three times since she started, and she’s not going to let it happen again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It’s… It’s alright. That’s the best she can say, really - she likes her housemates, more or less, and she </span>
  <em>
    <span>loves</span>
  </em>
  <span> her classes, especially Defence Against the Dark Arts and Charms, even though she’s only barely scraping what would count as an E in Defence Against the Dark Arts and Mum teaches Charms, which is almost embarrassing, sometimes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It’s alright. So what if she’s a little lonely? So what if everyone else always says that Hogwarts is the best time of your life, where you make all your friends and find the person you’ll spend your life with?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It’s alright. Sansa doesn’t mind. She’s not even here a year yet - it’ll be </span>
  <em>
    <span>fine.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>Now</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We ought to sing,” someone says, and Sansa dreads what she knows is coming next almost as much as she does the inevitable fall of the doors. “We ought to sing something we all know, to keep morale up.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How absolutely dreadful,” Joy says, broad nose wrinkling, but she’s smiling, too, her startling eyes bright with fear and fight. “But there’s only one real choice, isn’t there, since the olds aren’t likely to know the Wyrd Sisters’ latest.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Willas’ finger links around Sansa’s this time, as everyone begins to rumble through </span>
  <em>
    <span>Hoggy Warty Hogwarts, </span>
  </em>
  <span>and she smiles at him. He understands her reluctance, even if no one else ever seems to.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The song rolls to a close on Arwyn Oakheart’s brilliant soprano trill, as clear and sharp as cut glass, and then the great glass doors shatter inwards, in a hail of clear, sharp shards.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Before</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>By the time she gets to third year, Sansa has a routine.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There’s class, and class is wonderful - she loves all of her lessons, even Potions, because no matter how much she might dislike Professor Baelish she </span>
  <em>
    <span>loves</span>
  </em>
  <span> the peace of the dungeons, where everyone is too busy worrying about fudging their potions to chatter and gossip.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sansa wonders, sometimes, why everything else isn’t as easy as her lessons are. She’s pretty and polite and charming, when she needs to be, and gets along well with everyone, but she doesn’t have many friends. Not really. She has Jeyne, but Jeyne is always worried and nervous and disappears for hours at a time with no warning, and she has Cley, but Cley is a genuine genius and is taking more classes than seems possible, unless he can travel through time, and is always in the Library doing homework. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>There’s Margaery, in Charms Club, but Margaery is Robb’s age, in </span>
  <em>
    <span>sixth </span>
  </em>
  <span>year, and she’s a prefect, too, will probably be Head Girl next year, and there are a few others in Charms Club, but they’re all either older, like Margaery, or younger, like Shireen.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It’s lonely. She’s grateful for having Joff, truth be told, because Joff is almost always free to talk to her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Looking good today, Stark,” he says, jumping up onto the corner of her table - she glances around to make sure Madame Eglatine isn’t nearby, because she disapproves of people sitting on tables - and leaning back on one hand. His tie is loose around his neck, and he’s very good-looking, and Sansa wishes she could drum up a little more enthusiasm, since he’s apparently the best looking boy in the school, after Robb. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Feeling better, Joff,” she says back, force of habit moving her tongue more than any real enthusiasm for their little routine. She isn’t feeling better, she’s feeling lonely and inadequate, and wishes she could sneak down to Mum’s office for a cup of tea and a hug, but Mum does her best to remain professional, while they’re at school, because she thinks it’s unfair that her kids have their mother about when no one else does. She wouldn’t even mind sitting down with Robb for some tea, but Robb always has Quidditch or friends or his girlfriend to worry about, and he’s in sixth year now, after all, a prefect and wanting to be Gryffindor Quidditch captain </span>
  <em>
    <span>and</span>
  </em>
  <span> Head Boy next year, and aiming for all Os, too, in his N.E.W.T.s. “Quidditch?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Skipped it tonight,” he says, shrugging. He skips at least one Quidditch training a week, because he thinks he doesn’t need the practice. He </span>
  <em>
    <span>is </span>
  </em>
  <span>a good flier - a decent Chaser, if he’d pay more attention to Chasing and stop trying to do the Seeker’s job for her - but he needs more time in the air, with his team. “We’re just flying the same drills, over and over and over - it’s sickening, that we </span>
  <em>
    <span>need </span>
  </em>
  <span>this. Pathetic.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It’s on the tip of her tongue to point out that running drills until your arms are numb builds muscle memory, so you don’t even need to think about this pass or that dodge. She says nothing, though, because it’s easier, and letting Joffrey pay attention to her is one of the few things that </span>
  <em>
    <span>is</span>
  </em>
  <span> easy, at school. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>Now</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sansa throws up a Shield Charm without needing to think about it - her arm is out, movement complete, before she’s even said </span>
  <em>
    <span>“Protego!”, </span>
  </em>
  <span>and the glass runs down the shimmer of a wall like rain on frost.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The first curse thrown her way is- cutting, she thinks, she might have heard the spell but she can’t be sure, and she isn’t sure that her Shield will hold against it, so she dives - with one hand pressed to the small of Willas’ back, to make sure he hits the floor with her, instead of catching the curse. Something behind them shatters, porcelain chiming on the polished floor like a bell, signaling the start of the fight.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sansa rolls to her knees and throws up another sudden shield, letting it hover for long enough that it deflects a hex of unknown origin so she can spin and cast a Leg-Locker at one of the masked bastards who are attacking the </span>
  <em>
    <span>hospital.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>If Sansa didn’t know just who was hidden away in one of the private rooms upstairs, guarded by a pair of Aurors on her door, she’d wonder why in Morgana’s name the idiots are attacking such a soft target - or maybe she wouldn’t. Their whole game is to scare everyone into submission, and there isn’t anything scarier than breaking down the doors of the most neutral ground in Britain. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She hits another of them with a Stinging Hex when he raises his wand toward Aunt Lysa, and spares a second to watch him tear off his mask as his face swells like a puffer-fish. When that single second is up, she throws the fiercest </span>
  <em>
    <span>Steleus</span>
  </em>
  <span> she can manage at the twit coming for Healer Swann, before stamping down as hard as she’s able on the front of her knee - she’s learned the hard way that there’s not a witch or wizard who won’t be confused by a little bit of Muggle rough-and-tumble in the middle of a duel, and that most Hogwarts students, past and present, have arms like limp seaweed. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sansa has spent more time than she’ll admit to building leg muscles like an ox, and like </span>
  <em>
    <span>hell </span>
  </em>
  <span>she isn’t going to put them to good use.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Bone crunches under the solid sole of her sturdy boot, and she brings her knee up to meet a rapidly descending chin, more pleased than she’d like by the spurt of blood through the mask, by the wet crunch of broken bone and bitten tongue.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She moves on then, fairly confident that she’s won this round, and hardly has time to lift her head before she has to Stun or be killed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Before</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You should come to Hogsmeade with me,” Joffrey says. It’s late in January, and someone has dyed Sansa’s hair pink, because of course they have - school has taken a turn for the worse, since Arya started in September, because Arya is a popular, Quidditch playing Gryffindor, and having </span>
  <em>
    <span>two</span>
  </em>
  <span> Starks like that come through just proves that she’s a</span>
  <em>
    <span> freak. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Joffrey doesn’t seem to think so, which is nice. She doesn’t really understand why he bothers with her, since he could have his pick of any girl from sixth year down, but she’s glad of it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The next trip is three weeks from tomorrow,” he says, playing with the end of her braid and frowning a little. “I hear Puddifoot’s is nice, for the time of year.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Madame Puddifoot’s is a place for </span>
  <em>
    <span>dates, </span>
  </em>
  <span>and surely-</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Wear those earrings with the sapphires,” he tells her, frown gone with a flick of his wand - he’s smiling, and Sansa feels pink from the soles of her feet all the way to the top of her head. “They bring out your eyes.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He fixed her hair, she notices an hour later, when she’s floated back to the tower from the Library, and he likes her eyes, and he’s bringing her to </span>
  <em>
    <span>Madame Puddifoot’s </span>
  </em>
  <span>on </span>
  <em>
    <span>Valentine’s Day, </span>
  </em>
  <span>and Sansa thinks that maybe, it won’t matter that Arya is as cool as Robb was, because Joffrey fancies her!</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>Now</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A hood is pulled away and a mask falls, and Sansa is face to face with an old friend.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Your grandfather is going to be furious to have this confirmed,” she says, as easy in his company now as she was before the Incident, because she knows for certain now that she’s more than able to tear his face off with her bare hands. “Your poor mother, Joff. Don’t you ever </span>
  <em>
    <span>think?”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Not that Sansa can stand Cersei Lannister, but that isn’t the point - the point is that Joff is even more stupid than she thought, even more cruel and empty, and that’s sad, somehow, because she knows that he might have grown into a better man than this.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t need to think,” he says, sneering or leering, they’re much the same from him. “I just need to point and curse.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He tries - something Unforgivable blistering the air between them, but Sansa dives, under the heat of the spell and right into his gut shoulder-first, and while he’s still wheezing she Body-Binds him, and leaves him there on the floor to be stepped over or stepped on - she doesn’t care.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Part of her wants to go back, to kneel down and take the switchblade she knows he keeps tucked into his boot out, open it up and cut deep into his face, mark him and ruin his good looks just like he ruined hers, but she’s above that, and there are two bastards making a run for the doors to the stairwell, and she can’t have that.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But part of her really does want to kneel down beside him, to take a minute and cut him open just to watch him bleed, to see if she gets the same satisfaction from his pain that he did from hers.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Before</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Joff, I </span>
  <em>
    <span>can’t,” </span>
  </em>
  <span>Sansa sighs, knocking aside his encroaching hand with her ruler - she has an Astronomy chart due in the morning, and she can’t quite get it right, because she can’t seem to get the dimensions and the perspective right. “Please, tomorrow, or over the weekend - just not </span>
  <em>
    <span>now.”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ve got Quidditch at the weekend,” Joff grumbles, shuffling closer to her parchment on the tabletop. “And you’ve got Charms Club tomorrow night - come </span>
  <em>
    <span>on, </span>
  </em>
  <span>Sansa, it’s just a walk!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It hasn’t been </span>
  <em>
    <span>just a walk</span>
  </em>
  <span> since they got back to school after Christmas, she’s noticed, but she doesn’t say anything. It’s easier to just nudge him away and keep him at arm’s length, really.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Come </span>
  <em>
    <span>on,” </span>
  </em>
  <span>he whines, throwing himself back across the table like the big over-dramatic ninny he is. He casts an arm over his eyes, presses the other hand to his heart, but makes sure not to conceal his prefect’s badge - that’s </span>
  <em>
    <span>always</span>
  </em>
  <span> on show. Arya said that he even tried to wear it during Quidditch, but Jory Mormont put her foot down and ruled it a hazard. “Just half an hour, down to the lake and back - </span>
  <em>
    <span>please,</span>
  </em>
  <span> Sansa.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, Joffrey!” she snaps back, annoyed now, because he never </span>
  <em>
    <span>listens</span>
  </em>
  <span>. “I’ve got to get this done, and then I want to get started on my Potions essay! I am </span>
  <em>
    <span>busy!”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>It’s true, she is, and she’d quite like to pop over to Mum’s office for a minute before lights out, to warn her that Bran’s been having funny dreams again, but if she wastes time with Joff she won’t have time for that, and Bran’s dreams are far more important than Joff’s hurt feelings.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If I didn’t love you, I’d never put up with you,” Joff fumes, rolling to his feet and gathering his bag off the chair. “Fuck, Stark, there’s no fun in you anymore.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Goodnight, Joffrey,” she says as firmly as she can manage, because it makes her uncomfortable when he starts telling her that he loves her - it always precedes a request, or a demand, and he seems to think that she hasn’t realised it yet. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She’s a lot smarter than he gives her credit for. She always has been, but she’s really starting to realise it now. It’s only taken her five years of school, and two years as Joffrey’s lucky, lucky girlfriend.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She wouldn’t mind being Cley’s girlfriend, a little, and knowing that makes her wonder if she really ought to be Joff’s girlfriend at all anymore. If she’s gotten bored enough of him to fancy someone else, he’s obviously not right for her anymore. She wouldn’t mind asking Mum about that, too, if she can just get this work done in time.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re so ungrateful,” he says, sudden and cold. “I could have any girl in this school, but I chose you. You could at least </span>
  <em>
    <span>pretend</span>
  </em>
  <span> to be thankful, Sansa.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I shouldn’t have to be </span>
  <em>
    <span>thankful</span>
  </em>
  <span> that my boyfriend wants to spend time with me,” she grumbles. “It shouldn’t be something to be thankful </span>
  <em>
    <span>for, </span>
  </em>
  <span>Joffrey.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>Now</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Dilys’ portrait is hollering encouragement as Sansa and half a dozen others sprint for the stairwell doors, countering curses and hurling hexes as they skid across the bloodied floor. There’s so much noise, such a </span>
  <em>
    <span>variety </span>
  </em>
  <span>of noise, that Sansa’s head is spinning, but she ignores the ringing in her ears because this is more important than that. This is more important than anything else she’s ever done, really. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Someone - she doesn’t know who, can’t tell one voice from another in all the din - lays a spell on the doors, shimmering them steel-silver and adamant. The Dragonborn slide and don’t stop, slamming into the doors with a thud and a wet crunch that makes Sansa smile, all teeth.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They circle around them, and she realises that Willas is just beyond her - there’s blood on the side of his face, in his hair and beard, and she’ll have to check him over when this is done, and maybe kiss it better - and Joy is just beyond him. They can do this. They </span>
  <em>
    <span>have </span>
  </em>
  <span>to do this. The patients have to be kept safe - there is no other acceptable outcome.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Before</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I have my first O.W.L. exam in the morning, Joffrey,” Sansa says, leaning out the door of the Ravenclaw Tower and only having come this far because he sent her a </span>
  <em>
    <span>Howler</span>
  </em>
  <span> because she refused to go for a “walk” with him earlier. “I’m going to study a little more, and then I’m going to </span>
  <em>
    <span>sleep.</span>
  </em>
  <span>”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I can’t </span>
  <em>
    <span>believe </span>
  </em>
  <span>you!” he shouts, drawing the attention of the few people in the corridor outside the tower - Shireen is there, with Sarella Martell, and they were talking softly about something until Joff opened his mouth. “I go out of my </span>
  <em>
    <span>fucking </span>
  </em>
  <span>way-”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey now,” Sarella says, stepping forward with a frown. “Your grandfather might have the office behind the eagle, Joffrey, but that doesn’t give you the right to speak to another student like that. Apologise and leave, and maybe I won’t report you for being out of bed out of hours.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fucking Mudblood scum,” he fumes, rounding on Sarella - Sarella, who is small and elegant and sometimes Alleras, which confuses people who think she needs to pick a side. Joff is neither small nor elegant, and he is very, deeply angry. “Who the </span>
  <em>
    <span>fuck-”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“My father,” Sarella says lightly, “is one of your precious Sacred Twenty-Eight. My mother is of similarly exalted ancestry, in Ethiopia. If you plan on being disgusting, at least also be </span>
  <em>
    <span>accurate.”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Sansa watches Joff open his mouth to fight back, but Sarella’s wand is very suddenly in her hand, and surely even Joff knows better than that.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He does, mercifully. Sansa doesn’t need the stress of her boyfriend dying the night before her first O.W.L., thanks awfully, and she certainly doesn’t need the stress of an investigation into why Oberyn Martell’s daughter murdered Tywin Lannister’s grandson.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Goodnight, Joff,” she says. “Go to bed.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You-”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Good</span>
  <em>
    <span>night, </span>
  </em>
  <span>Joffrey,” Sansa says, firmer this time, not at all in the mood to be shouted at anymore. “I will speak with you later. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Go to bed.”</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>Now</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You can’t win this,” Willas says. “You know you can’t. We’ve been here before.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The smaller of the pair in the masks laughs, high and razored even through the lacquered wood. Something in Sansa’s stomach turns over, like a backwards heartbeat, when Willas takes a step forward and slightly in front of her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hand yourself in,” he coaxes, voice low and even, without the rough edges that sometimes seep in when his reserve breaks - a rare thing, but delicious. “You can be held here, at least for now - not on Azkaban. Never on Azkaban, if I can stop it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How sweet,” the woman in the mask drawls, something in her voice familiar to Sansa. “You still care after all.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Please, Rhaenys,” Willas says, gentle, soft, a dazzling counterpoint to the swelling rage of battle behind them - his wand, his beautiful rosewood wand, is still raised, and over them all his beautiful silver-white Caladrius bird calls her sorrowful song. His eyes are gold in the spell-light, and Sansa wishes he was a million miles away from this.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Before</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’ve told you already, Joffrey,” Sansa says, tugging her wrist out of his hand for the fourth time. “I’m not going for one of your bloody walks tonight - I have Transfiguration in the morning, and I am going to study. You are not welcome to sit with me. You are not welcome to send me Howlers. You are not </span>
  <em>
    <span>welcome.”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re my girlfriend,” he snarls, low and rough, the way his voice always gets when he’s close to losing his temper. “</span>
  <em>
    <span>Mine, </span>
  </em>
  <span>Sansa, do you understand?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She slams her books down on the table, drawing curious eyes from all around, but right now she doesn’t care. Right now, she just wants to </span>
  <em>
    <span>smack</span>
  </em>
  <span> Joffrey, right in the face, because he’s been absolutely insufferable since Christmas and she hasn’t the patience for him, she really doesn’t.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I am doing my exams,” she says, through tightly gritted teeth. “I am </span>
  <em>
    <span>not</span>
  </em>
  <span> free to walk around the lake and have you try to cop a feel when I let you kiss me. I am </span>
  <em>
    <span>not</span>
  </em>
  <span> in the right frame of mind to find your persistence to the point of </span>
  <em>
    <span>Howlers</span>
  </em>
  <span> charming or funny. I am </span>
  <em>
    <span>not</span>
  </em>
  <span> in any mood for you, Joffrey, so </span>
  <em>
    <span>go away.”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>He stares at her, wide-eyed, and then scowls. His scowl is filthy ugly, removing any trace of good looks, and she wants to smack it right off his face. She does!</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How </span>
  <em>
    <span>dare</span>
  </em>
  <span> you,” he hisses. He’s taller than her, she realises, and his arms - revealed as they are by the tight sleeves of his shirt - are thick with muscle. Very thick. Oh, Merlin’s pants, what has she done? Isn’t this why she’s always played nice? Isn’t this why-</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The backhand takes her by surprise - the strength behind it doesn’t, really, but the ferocity does, as does the searing pain of her cracking cheekbone.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If you </span>
  <em>
    <span>ever</span>
  </em>
  <span> speak to me like that again,” he says, looming over her, “this is only a taster of what I’ll do in return. Understood?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>His head disappears, and Sansa cups her hand over her aching cheek as Joffrey is dragged backwards by his hair, stumbling over his feet and the benches.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Arya throws him down onto the Gryffindor table, hard, and then climbs up on the bench to stand over him with her wand to his throat.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If you ever touch my sister again,” she says, twelve years and barely five foot of unbridled rage right now, “I’ll blast your ugly head right off. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Understood?”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Arya catches Sansa by the elbow the moment she’s jumped away from Joffrey, and frog-marches her to the hospital wing. Mum appears, and doesn’t believe a word of Sansa’s story about falling against a banister, but she doesn’t say anything, and Sansa knows it’ll go no further. No student wants to be known as a tell-tale.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>Now</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rhaenys Targaryen’s eyes are black and luminous, and she is painfully beautiful. Sansa is a little jealous, truth be told, of those heavy black curls, those long black eyelashes, that skin like sunset on gold. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her wand is elder, Sansa thinks, and her hand is shaking as she holds it toward Willas.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t want to hurt you, Willas,” Rhaenys says, her voice as much a purr as Willas’ and more again - Willas is tense beside Sansa, his jaw locked and sweat beading through the blood on his forehead. “Never again. I promised, didn’t I?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We can get you out, Rhae,” he says. “I swear it, I’ll do everything I can, and everything </span>
  <em>
    <span>Dad</span>
  </em>
  <span> can. Please, Rhaenys. Not this. Not after everything she’s suffered. Don’t make her go back.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I promised to never hurt </span>
  <em>
    <span>you</span>
  </em>
  <span> again,” Rhaenys says, hand still trembling even as she turns her wand on Sansa. “But I never promised not to hurt your new toys, did I?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Willas moves quickly - spellwork, a physical attack, Sansa can’t be sure - but not quickly enough. He’s hardly moved a muscle before Rhaenys’ wand flicks, and the pain in Sansa’s bones burns so hot that that elder wand must have a dragon heartstring core.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nothing exists, outside of the pain. Not now.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Before</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The night after her last exam - her History of Magic exam - Sansa is walking back to the Tower, alone, after dinner.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’re going for a walk,” Joffrey says. “I’ve got something to show you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He shows her red on silver - her blood on his switchblade.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>That night, sitting on a bed in the hospital wing while Madam Mordane does her best to stitch Sansa’s curse-cut face back together, makes a decision for Sansa.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m going to be a Healer,” she tells Mum, when Madam Mordane is finished. “So I can help people who’ve been as stupid as me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Mum doesn’t say anything to that, just holds her close, and Sansa almost cries. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Almost. It hurts far too much to cry.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>Now</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The pain stops, for a second, and through tears Sansa can see a flash of blinding red from Willas’ wand.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It misses, though, and the pain returns - but he is beside her now, screaming raw and bloody and even louder than her, and that is somehow a comfort.</span>
