    <p>“If you aren’t careful, I’ll shove that bauble up your arse, Malfoy,” Hermione threatens, nodding to the alpine-themed ball in his hand. She levitates the top half of the massive tree, that, though only half-assembled, looms impressively over their heads. Usually Flitwick does it but this year he’s on a well-deserved vacation. That man seriously needs a rest. Hermione and Draco are his best senior students and naturally, he asked them to take on the responsibility. </p><p>“You know what they say about round objects in human orifices?” She questions, aligning the tree and locking it in place with a flick of her wand. She spins to stare him down. “They become stuck, and in that bauble’s case,” she looks down at it pointedly before meeting his eyes again, “they <i>break</i>.” </p><p>“Granger,” he sighs, “if you don’t shut that sweet little mouth of yours, I’ll be obliged to test out that theory in all of your own orifices.” He sends her an unimpressed eyebrow raise. </p><p>Malfoy has a talent with eyebrows. He’s mastered multiple different raised-eyebrow-expressions. After hours of staring in the mirror, of course, he can do surprised, perturbed, annoyed, unimpressed, bored, the list goes on. </p><p>She aims her wand between his eyebrows. “You’re dead meat, Ferret.” She glares down the line of her arm. Straight and sure. </p><p>“Tsk, tsk, tsk, not so fast, bauble bitch.” He stalks forward, flicking away her wand as if it were merely a wooden stick. </p><p>She spits her words through bared teeth. “I hope a thousand glass shards get irretrievably stuck in your sphincter, you <i>vile, rotting</i> excuse of a human.” </p><p>“Is that so?” He cocks his head, a smirk playing around his mouth. Leaning into her ear, lips brushing the uppermost tip, he whispers, “you weren’t saying that last time my tongue was pressed into your cunt, were you, sweet pea?” </p><p>She flinches away from the disgusting truth of his words. It sears her every time. She feels ashamed, but also, aroused at his proximity. Merlin, she can’t help it.</p><p>“That was a mistake.” She looks away, redness climbing up her neck. </p><p>“Was every time a mistake? How many days have there been this year?” He makes a show of looking around himself at the boxes of decorations, looming, promising hours’ worth of work. “Oh, would you look at that, it's <i>December</i>.” </p><p>She watches him angrily. “I hate you.” </p><p>“Hard to believe when I find you wrapped around my cock at least three times a week.” </p><p>Huffing, she opens a box with another flick while she turns her back on him. “I wouldn’t say it’s <i>that</i> frequent.” </p><p>His hands find her waist and pull her into an embrace, pewter grey eyes dangerously close to her own syrupy brown ones. “Talk me through last night, then.” His voice is quiet thunder.</p><p>Her breath hitches. She remembers how she rode him on his silky Slytherin sheets.<br/>
She gulps thickly. He notices. </p><p>
  <i>“Draco,” she’d moaned, clear as day, into the silent vacuum Muffilato inflicted against the curtains of his four-poster. Her palms were pressed into his fluffy pillows as her nose brushed the headboard. She was so wet and fuck he was hard. They’d fucked in beautiful silence. It had never been this intense. Hearing his name spill so deliciously from her lips made him feel starved. He had to see her pleasure, now. He’d flipped her over and driven his cock into her, his eyes penetrating hers much further than his body ever could. She took the devil by the horns and thrusted in time with him, running her hands down his arms and back and, well, anywhere she could reach, really. </i>
</p><p>“We fucked.” She responds flatly. “As always.”</p><p>
  <i>He saw exactly what he was doing to her. And then he was a tall, blond, quivering mess of limbs. Hermione, he choked desperately into her neck, pushing himself up to meet her eyes again. Their mouths crashed together. And she’d come. Draco’s liquid warmth pumping into her sent her over the edge and she cried out around him. </i>
</p><p>“Are you thinking about it?” He murmurs, running his hand under her shirt. She feels his fingertips drag up her ribcage and brush her breast. Her chest burns. </p><p>“No.” She chokes out, closing her eyes under his touch. </p><p>
  <i>Their eyes found each other again afterwards. After the world fell apart. After the shards stuck themselves back together. </i>
</p><p>
  <i>“I should go.” She got up. </i>
</p><p>“You left.” He comments, badly veiling the hurt in his voice. </p><p>She looks down, determined. She will hide her pain from him. “You know the rules just as well as I do, so don’t play dumb.” She spits, removing herself from his grasp.</p><p>
  <i>There was a Hufflepuff party last year. They’d both drank too much Firewhiskey, Butterbeer, whatever was on offer, really. The reckless youth will drink whatever the fuck they can get their hands on. She brushed past him and he’d grabbed her arm impulsively. Perhaps he could rile up the old swot. “Leaving already, Granger? Knew I could peg you as a party pooper,” he laughed mockingly in her face. </i>
</p><p>
  <i>She yanked her elbow away. </i>
</p><p>
  <i>“I’m not leaving.” She stuck up her nose, eyeing him down angrily. </i>
</p><p>
  <i>“Going to play a game in the sheets with Weasley, I expect?” He snickered, taking a sip from his goblet. His eyes roamed her outfit. She was in her school uniform still, but she’d loosened her tie and undone the first couple buttons. Her shirt was beginning to untuck itself. </i>
</p><p>
  <i>Dishevelled Granger certainly beat the usual faultless Granger.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>She crossed her arms, narrowing her eyes at the white-haired man. One couldn’t really call him a boy anymore. Not with those cheekbones and that jaw structure. She un-crossed her arms. </i>
</p><p>
  <i>“Even if I was, it’s none of your business.”</i>
</p><p>
  <i>“So, you’re not?” He raised an eyebrow. Leant back on the wall. “I thought you two were the golden, incestuous couple of the school.”</i>
</p><p>
  <i>“Incestuous, you say?” She laughed genuinely, a smile gracing her face. “That’s rich, coming from you, Malfoy.” </i>
</p><p>
  <i>A smirk had grown as he watched her, and he shrugged. Hermione found herself wishing he didn’t look so endearing. She felt herself being pulled into his orbit and decided that she should probably get some water. She was feeling far off tipsy by now, and it wasn’t even that late. The room spun out under her feet a bit. She bit her lip.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>His eyes roamed her face. “It’s always the mouth that gives away a drunkard, Granger. Are you intoxicated?” </i>
</p><p>
  <i>She blinked. “Perhaps.”</i>
</p><p>
  <i>He leant back, nodding. “Explains why you haven’t walked away yet.”</i>
</p><p>
  <i>She walked away. </i>
</p><p>“Perhaps the rules can be re-written.” He murmurs, spinning her around to look into his eyes. He has to show her that he’s being earnest. He feels a tension in his throat. </p><p>“You know <i>very well </i>why we have them.” She glares at him, begging him to understand.</p><p>“Why?” He questions immediately, searching for any leniency. </p><p>She looks away. “Draco, this conversation is not happening.”</p><p>
  <i>“Where are your cronies, Malfoy?” She plonked down to sit with him later that night. A conversation with Draco Malfoy would certainly be interesting, her drunken mind convinced her.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>He rolled his eyes and finished off his liquor, letting the goblet down. She saw silver rings glint on his alluring fingers. Then she saw silver eyes. “You know I’m not flanked by dumb and dumber anymore, so why bother asking?”</i>
</p><p>
  <i>“I just want to mess with you.” She smiled. Really smiled. It wasn’t something she’d ever directed towards him before.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>“There are better ways you could be doing that, sweet pea.” He winked.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>She raised her eyebrows at him, absolutely prepared to express exactly how his objectification made her feel. Angry. Aggravated. </i>
</p><p>
  <i>He blinked expectantly, and she realised she’d fallen into his boring trap. He just wanted a reaction, as always.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>She hesitated for a drunken second. </i>
</p><p>
  <i>Clumsily grabbed his neck. </i>
</p><p>
  <i>And then Hermione Granger was kissing Draco Malfoy. Out of spite, of course. </i>
</p><p>“What, to prevent people talking? To prevent my family finding out?” His voice lowers to a growl. “Newsflash, Granger. They’re crazy. I try not to run my life around the opinions of unhinged madmen. Sorry about it.” </p><p> <i>Their mouths were locked, his hands were tangled in her hair, and he tasted like heat and dark liquor. She couldn’t get enough. Every second was indecent. Appalling. Hateful. </i></p><p>To this day she still can’t figure out why his tongue is the most delicious part. It’s currently running up her ear. Her eyes fall closed. </p><p>
  <i>Finally, she’d pulled away, eyes wide, lips swollen, cunt wet, and life ruined. As always, he smirked. She watched him lick her off his lips. “Granger, you taste like cinnamon.” </i>
</p><p>
  <i>She didn’t dare say anything as he leaned into her ear. His lips brushed her cheek and he whispered; “I really, quite like cinnamon.” </i>
</p><p>
  <i>The next morning, alone in her bed, she struggled to remember exactly why she moulded her mouth back onto his. </i>
</p><p>“Draco, we’ll be killed.”</p><p>“Not if you just stay the night.” He tries, his hands still feathering over her skin. “It won’t impact anything.”</p><p>She huffs and pushes all of him away; his tongue, his hands, his chest. “Are you daft?” She questions seriously. </p><p>“It <i>won’t</i>.” He repeats with more conviction.</p><p>“Sure, but if we get used to sleepovers and lazy mornings together...” Her voice lowers, still stepping further backwards. “Enough time for longer conversations and,” she shakes her head sadly, “you know. Becoming <i>friends</i> as well as…” Her ankles hit a box of tinsel with a quiet thud. She stops. Sighs</p><p>“Lovers.” He interjects. </p><p>“You know exactly what will happen. And that <i>can’t happen</i>.” The hall creaks around them. Two figures alone, approaching tragedy. Her words reveal a gushing wound. </p><p>He looks at her sadly, five meters away but she still hears loud and clear. “It already has.”</p><p>
  <i>She told Draco to meet her on the seventh floor if he was interested in seeing her again. He did. They walked in silence, hearing only their muffled footsteps and alternating breaths. She remembered the smell of freshly fallen snow, in the deep, bitter cold of midnight. It was undeniably an event made for secrecy. They barely closed the door to the room of requirement before she tore off his tie. He took her against the door, then. Without gentleness. She’d already fantasised about this far too many times. </i>
</p><p>
  <i>And when she filled the place with her lustful moans, she realised fantasy could never replicate reality.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>Afterwards, she let her skirt back down, gave him one last shameless glance, and slipped away into the halls. </i>
</p><p>She turns away, back to the task at hand. The tree, she remembers, will not assemble itself. She flicks hair off her face.  “We fuck and that’s it. There’s no staying over, there’s no friendliness in the hallways, there’s no reason for us to even acknowledge each other at all, honestly.”</p><p>She starts winding tinsel around the tree. Red first, then gold. Blue sapphires and emeralds twinkle in place of tree lights. The rich colours of Hogwarts blend artfully. The sight is truly enchanting.</p><p>He sighs, helping her with the shiny, plasticky, <i>tinselly shit</i>. He’s always hated that. It's dust prone and <i>fuck</i> it sets off his allergies. He can feel his nose prickle.</p><p>“What do you want from me?” She asks quietly, not looking away from the glimmering lights. </p><p>“Whatever you can give.” He responds without falter. </p><p>
  <i>“Give yourself to me.” He murmured into her ear as he bent her over a library desk. Blond hair tickled her ear. Impossibly silky. Not as silky as his voice, though. “Naughty Granger, getting fucked in the library. How scandalous.” He pulled all the way out, leaving her empty.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>“Please.” She’d gasped, pressing her arse against his hips. He teased her slick lips.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>“Beg for it.” He demanded gravelly, stroking a palm over her lower back. Assertively.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>Her head fell between her elbows. “Please, Draco,” her voice was rich with need. She’d tasted cherry on his tongue when they kissed, and ever since, the corners of her vision faded.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>And so, he filled her up in one go, pressing his hand over her cries, catching them for her. Holding them safe. </i>
</p><p>
  <i>That was the first time she cried out his name in ecstasy. </i>
</p><p>“Well I can’t give you much, so back luck.” She refuses to meet his eyes. She knows if she does, she’ll regret it. “I can give you tonight. And any other night. That’s it. No morning after. No lazy affections.”</p><p>He feels pathetic. Going back to a woman who can’t offer him anything; who refuses to make an empty promise to humour him.</p><p>
  <i>“Promise me I’m the only one?”  She asked him, her eyes searching desperately. She’d seen him talking animatedly to Pansy Parkinson earlier, and to her surprise, rabid jealousy clawed its way up her stomach.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>He was confused. Why was she so worried all of a sudden? </i>
</p><p>
  <i>He frowned at her. “Why the hell would I want anybody else when I have you?” His fingers trailed down her naked thighs. They were snug around his hips. Merlin, her thighs. He splayed his hands across them, pressing each finger bud deeply into her flesh. </i>
</p><p>
  <i>“I promise you’re the only one.” She’d whispered, as if she were hiding the confession from herself. He watched as she sunk back down onto him, filling herself so far that their hips were flush. </i>
</p><p>
  <i>“Good.” He’d finally murmured, pulling her towards his lips. </i>
</p><p>“The baubles go on last.” He comments feebly, trying to keep the conversation afloat. </p><p>“I know,” she begins levitating one of what looks like hundreds. He follows suit, spacing them out with care.</p><p>Then she probes, why does he have to make it so <i>complicated</i>? </p><p>She lets her wand rest in her hand, turning to face him. </p><p>“Me?” A raised eyebrow. </p><p>“Yes. You.” She shakes her head, “I ignore the fact that keeping this casual is difficult and painful, and so should you. This war is looming over both our heads.” </p><p>“It’s not here yet.” He says simply, continuing the bauble placement.</p><p>“Why aren’t you <i>panicking</i>?” She stresses, “we’re on different sides, Malfoy! We’ll be forced to fight one another.” </p><p>He turns to her, his eyes boring into hers sincerely. “You know, I’ll never hurt you.” </p><p>“You can’t just <i>promise </i>that! Or at the very least expect me to believe it! You can’t just say these things and act like they aren’t real. The upsetting certainty of our future is too real.” </p><p>He hasn’t looked away for a second, but the severity of his gaze has softened. “Then why don’t you think <i>we’re </i>real? If <i>everything else</i> is so painfully real, why not us?”</p><p>“Because <i>this</i>,” she flung a hand into the space between then, “only works if we don’t admit what’s really going on!”</p><p>
  <i>“This isn’t happening again,” she said as she shrugged on her robes. The sheets were bunched around Malfoy’s hips and he was staring up at her through golden lashes. “This,” he murmured, “has already happened three times in the last 40 minutes.” His cheeks were still flushed, and the pink complimented his complexion. His lithe frame shifted, and the silk fell a few centimetres. </i>
</p><p>
  <i>She had to look away. Partly because she couldn’t lie to his face, partly because he was so beautiful it almost hurt to look. “Well you’d better burn it into your memory, because it’s the last time.”</i>
</p><p>
  <i>He rolled his eyes. “Granger, we’ve been fucking for months now and it only keeps getting better. You won’t be able to hold yourself back.” </i>
</p><p>
  <i>She left without another word. </i>
</p><p>
  <i>They lasted one torturous week until she approached him in potions. Completely out of character, but she just couldn’t spend another second on the other side of the room while he looked like that. She’d spent the whole week avoiding him. </i>
</p><p>
  <i>Some say you can never look bad if you’ve got a good tailor.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>But Draco’s body in the precise cut of his expensive robes was simply too much for her to handle. </i>
</p><p>
  <i>“Malfoy.” </i>
</p><p>
  <i>He put down the knife grasped in his hand. She admired his perfectly sliced ginger root. Their eyes met. “Granger.” </i>
</p><p>
  <i>She put a hand to her forehead. “Would you take me to Pomfrey? The fumes in here are making me feel lightheaded.”</i>
</p><p>
  <i>Harry and Ron watched the exchange as if she’d gone mad. Malfoy narrowed his eyes at them first, then her, and made a show of being annoyed about it. </i>
</p><p>
  <i>She was already slick for him when they clumsily fit their bodies into the nearest bathroom stall. </i>
</p><p>
  <i>“Merlin, Granger,” he breathed out as he thrust himself up into her. Her hand was propped against the wall behind his head as she rode him on the toilet seat. “Almost feels like you can’t live without me.” </i>
</p><p>
  <i>“Almost feels like you’re right,” she said after he stuck a finger up her arse. She cried out into his neck, coming around him for the first time in a week. </i>
</p><p>
  <i>To her it had felt like an eternity.</i>
</p><p>“Done.” She says with triumph. Draco watches the pride on her face as she takes in their accomplishment. “I think we did a good job.” </p><p>Draco rids the room of rubbish. “Now, it’s done. It’s perfect.” </p><p>She smiles at him. He smiles back. These moments when nothing is between them, they hold most precious. But, the constant nagging reminder of their temporality creeps up on her, and she looks away. </p><p>His fingers find her jaw and pull her back. He traces her skin with his own.</p><p>“Draco.” She whispers, eyes already full and threatening to spill. “I can’t do this anymore.” </p><p>It’s a rare show of vulnerability. He knows it won’t last long. So, he kisses her. He pulls her close and doesn’t let go. They melt into each other under the grandeur of their tree. </p><p>Finally, they made something real. </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>“Hey.” Draco murmurs, watching her eyes open blearily. Her hair is splayed all over the place. </p><p>She sits up to stretch, his sheets falling to expose her naked back to the chill. Draco’s eyes roam over her shoulders, hair, down her spine. He thinks that the green of his sheets suits her perfectly.</p><p>She looks over her shoulder and admires him admiring her in the morning light. </p><p>
  <i>They pulled away from each other, her tears running down both their faces. He’d tasted them in their kiss. </i>
</p><p>
  <i>“Just stay tonight. Please.” He wiped away a fresh drop from her nose. </i>
</p><p>
  <i>She looked at the floor, surprised to find one last bauble at her feet. It twinkled up at her.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>“I can’t.” She whispered shakily. </i>
</p><p>
  <i>“What are you so afraid of?” He asked, not letting her go. </i>
</p><p>
  <i>“Us.” With finality. </i>
</p><p>
  <i>He watched her silently. His face never moved. His breath never hitched. He wasn’t surprised. </i>
</p><p>
  <i>“Granger. Making love surely can’t be as painful as a bauble up the arse.” </i>
</p><p>The sun highlights shades of blond in his hair. “Hello, Draco.” She smiles.</p>
