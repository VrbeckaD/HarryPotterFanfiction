    <p dir="ltr">Hell is cold.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Thalia can feel her blood freeze, shivering as her body betrays her and threatens to rip itself apart. The weight of her angel’s hand on her forehead is heavy, pinning her to a surgical table in the center of a windowless room. He strokes her hair, grounding her in the present. She worries about her baby, offhandedly, the one that she’s been carrying for eight and a half months. As her body is racked with another spasm, Thalia wonders if she is supposed to push.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><br/> “<em>Imperio.</em>” Her angel whispers. His words slither into Thalia’s mind, wrapping it in fog. His voice is a snake, taking her doubts and wrapping them in deadly coils, squeezing them tight until her head is empty.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><br/> Her angel says that <em>everything is okay</em>. The <em>baby is fine</em>. That she needs to <em>be quiet</em>. <em>Silencio</em>. The angel talks so much and says so many things, that when he finally pushes the knife past her ribcage and into her heart Thalia is almost thankful. She tastes copper, imagines the red painting her teeth as blood bubbles up in her throat.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><br/> Her vision is dimming, but she sees the angel wrench the knife from her chest and aim it at her stomach.<br/> He hisses, “<em>Finite Incantem</em>.”<br/> Thalia doesn’t have the strength left to scream.</p>
