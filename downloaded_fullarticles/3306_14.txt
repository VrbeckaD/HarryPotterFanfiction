  <span>“Are soulmates real?” Hermione questioned her friend’s judgement. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Ginny shrugged. “I’ve heard about it, but I’m not positive. It would be nice though, don’t you think? To find your soul’s companion?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione pursed her lips, but in the corner of her heart, she longed to believe it. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Sirius?” Hermione sat down on the couch beside him. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yes, kitten?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Do you believe in soulmates?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>His eyes flicked to the space over her shoulder. “Yes.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Really?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He smiled. “I sure do. Whether a friend or,” he cleared his throat, “lover. I think there’s someone out there who our souls, our hearts sing for.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>His words made her smile. But, something kept nudging her in the back of her mind. “How do we find them?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He let out a tired sigh. “That’s the hard part, kitten. It’s something you feel deep inside. When you know, you know.” A warm smile came to his face when he took Remus’s offer of hot cocoa. </span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Hogwarts castle was in shambles. The sight of broken walls and broken bodies almost made her want to cry.</p>
<p>
  <span>“That was pretty brave of you, Oliver.” Hermione wiped his bloody temple clean. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He shrugged, but immediately winced. “Go on, Granger. I’m fine.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She looked at him skeptically, but moved onto the next person slumped against the wall. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>His eyes were closed, but his brows were scrunched up in pain as he clutched his chest. She knelt down, touching his thigh gently. He gasped, his eyes searching hers. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Her words stuck in her throat, mesmerized by dark brown eyes ringed with black. She watched him gulp. “How can I -”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’m Adrian,” he blurted. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She smiled. “Hi, Adrian. I’m Hermione.”</span>
