<p>Dessert</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Harry, still tipsy when they exited the restaurant, winced as bright sunlight hit his eyes. “Ouch.”</p>
<p>Malfoy, behind him, slipped on his sunglasses. “Time for pudding.”</p>
<p>“Pudding?” Harry gaped at him. “We both ate huge beef burgers, not to mention enough chips to sink a boat! I couldn’t eat another thing right now.” </p>
<p>“Ever had Phillipe’s fairy cakes?” </p>
<p>“That’s the new French bakery in Diagon, isn’t it?” </p>
<p>Malfoy hummed. “You haven’t lived until you’ve had their chocolate decadence cake.” </p>
<p>“Are you serious?” Harry asked, trailing after him. </p>
<p>Malfoy tossed a smirk over his shoulder. “As an Unforgivable. Now come on.” </p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Phillipe’s wasn’t busy. “Perfect time to buy pastry,” Malfoy murmured, bending over to inspect the offerings. “Who knew?” </p>
<p>Harry hung back, eyeing his arse.</p>
<p>“Any requests?” </p>
<p>Harry, distracted, didn’t answer. </p>
<p>“My eyes are here, Potter.” </p>
<p>Harry winced, looking Malfoy square in the face. “Sorry. I was…um…” </p>
<p>Malfoy smirked knowingly. “I know exactly what you were doing,” he purred. “Clearly you’ve already decided on what you’re going to….eat later.” </p>
<p>Harry felt his face flushing. “Um, strawberry cake!” </p>
<p>“Excellent choice.” Chuckling, Malfoy turned away, and, after paying, linked his arm with Harry’s. “Time for dessert,” he said before Disapparating them.</p>
