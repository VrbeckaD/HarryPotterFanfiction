    <p>The sunlight was pale and the air was crisp. Dean breathed in deeply and tried to calm his nerves. He’d never been so far inside enemy territory before. He’d never been so far away from home before either. He missed his dad, he missed his car, and he missed Sammy. </p>
<p>But even more pressing were the questions. Would he fit in? Would his crash course on magic casting be enough to catch up to where the other students were? And would he be called out as the fraud he was? Pam’s ritual was the real deal after all; magic for life. Dean didn’t even want to think of the sacrifice made for this to work. Would his magic be weaker for it though, or have a different signature? He mentally kicked himself for brooding as the professor turned towards him once more. </p>
<p>“Mr. Winchester?” Professor Dumbledore asked. His tone was innocent enough, but there was something in his eyes that implied he knew Dean was brooding. “Are there any concerns you wish to share with me before we make our way up to the castle?” </p>
<p>Dean reddened slightly at the pressure of the situation. “No, sir.” he lied smoothly. Truthfully, he wished he could confide in someone. “I was just thinking of my family.” He added this for good measure, remembering his occlumency lessons and that a little of the truth was better than a direct lie.</p>
<p>“Ah, yes.” Dumbledore nodded sagely. “I am afraid that until Grindelwald’s antics are put to rest in America, your father’s decision to send you here was the wisest course of action. Though I must say, we have only rarely entertained the presence of a home schooled transfer student. If you should need any assistance, please do not hesitate to ask.”</p>
<p>Dean nodded swiftly. Though he knew that the professor likely knew something was amiss, it comforted him that he was being offered help at all. Pushing down the butterflies in his stomach once more, Dean walked with the professor towards the hill above Hogsmeade. </p>
<p>Earlier that very same morning Dean had met Professor Dumbledore in Diagon Alley. His dad had dropped him off at the pub entrance, under a well worn sign that read “The Leaky Cauldron.” Dean winced as he remembered saying goodbye. He felt like a preschooler saying goodbye to their Mommy. At least, he thought grimly, his emotional distress added to the credibility of his story. After Dean's father departed, professor Dumbledore led him to the magical brick wall out back, and from there, into the Alley itself.</p>
<p>“Have you given any thought as to which house you would like to be in? I’m afraid such practices are uncommon overseas, but here in Europe we tend to hold onto our traditions, for better or for worse.”  </p>
<p>Dean struggled to come back to and focus on the present. “Um, not really.” he admitted sheepishly. Slytherin sure sounded like a bag full of dicks as far as we was concerned, and since he could pass himself off as a half blood at best, he didn’t think he’d fit in there. <br/>“Ravenclaw would be a good fit for my brother Sammy,” he started, trying to fill the silence as he thought. “But I think he’s holding out for Beauxbatons.” He lied seamlessly. He decided to stick with the story his dad and Pam had crafted. If he felt like he needed backup in a year or two, Sammy would join him here at Hogwarts, but not unless it was necessary. For now, his dad needed Sam to help continue his hunts back home. </p>
<p>“Ah, but what about yourself?” Dumbledore said curiously. “Surely you must have an idea of your own strengths and shortcomings.” </p>
<p>“Shortcomings?” Dean asked, genuinely surprised. “I thought Houses were all about the good stuff. You know, the stuff people are good at.”</p>
<p>Dumbledore smiled, clearly amused at the simplicity of the boy’s language. “While it is true that sorting generally brings to mind the more positive aspects of each house, it is equally true that each is defined and influenced by its negative traits. Gryffindors tend to be thoughtless and rash, for example. I myself am a Gryffindor.” He paused, considering his words carefully. “Ravenclaws tend to be overly focused on their studies. A rather unfortunate occurrence, as they miss out on all the parties. Slytherins descend so fully into the inner workings of their house and society that they often can no longer tell fact from fiction. And Hufflepuffs,” he said, smiling serenely, “are perfect.” </p>
<p>Dean frowned, lost in thought. The process of elimination kept him (hopefully) out of Slytherin and Ravenclaw. He supposed being a badger or a lion wasn’t so bad. </p>
<p>Just then, they crested the hill, and the magnificent castle came into view. </p>
<p>“Welcome, Mr. Winchester, to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.”</p>
