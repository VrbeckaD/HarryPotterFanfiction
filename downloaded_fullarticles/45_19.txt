    <p>It had been approximately three hours and forty seven minutes since he had last had a smoke and the urge to do so was painfully echoing in his brain, fingers itching to reach for the packet stashed in his right breast pocket. He drummed his fingers against his thigh instead, letting his head fall back against the cold head rest gently. His passenger made no sound but quickly readjusted to the slight shift in position, burrowing further into Arthur’s neck. He sighed gently, wondering with some amusement whether or not the little fingers would leave small bruises on his pale skin.</p><p>He woke some time later to the kind words of the paramedic informing him that they had in fact reached their destination during his brief lapse of consciousness. Nodding and murmuring a brief gratitude, Arthur looked down at the child who appeared to be sleeping as deeply as he had been. With a small smile, he secured his arms around the boy and stood up, allowing himself to be guided out of the ambulance and into the awaiting hospital department. He was led directly into a closet-size examination room down the corridor from the A&amp;E and silently thanked the gods for the ability to avoid that horror. His next divine praise came when he spotted the uniform sitting in one of the two vacant chairs in the room, holding a take away coffee cup and wearing a bright smile.</p><p>“You are officially my favourite police officer,” said Arthur, grinning back and sitting down on the second plastic seat. The lump in his arms mumbled something incoherent but otherwise didn’t protest to the movement.</p><p>“Who said anything about this being for you?” replied the woman in a light and teasing manner. “Did you want something? You should have said.”</p><p>He laughed quietly, careful not to disturb the child. “I sense a disciplinary action in your future unless you hand it over soon, PC Davis.”</p><p>“Wouldn’t that be an abuse of your power, <em>sir</em>?”</p><p>“Naturally. Now give me.” With his free hand, Arthur made grabbing actions in the direction of the cup. Rolling her eyes, the officer handed it over, her hand brushing against his briefly. He raised the coffee to his lips carefully and took a sip, moaning in satisfaction as he swallowed his first mouthful.</p><p>“That’s just obscene,” said Davis, hiding her laughter behind a hand. Arthur toasted her mockingly with the cup before drinking from it again.</p><p>“I’d offer to take him off your hands,” she mentioned after a few moments of happy silence, motioning to the boy still attached to him. “But I heard that didn’t go down very well earlier.”</p><p>He nodded, feeling sombre again. “As you can see we are still quite literally attached at the hip.”</p><p>“It would be very cute if it wasn’t so serious. What do you think’s going on?”</p><p>His mouth twisted in reaction to unpleasant thoughts before he answered her again. “I’m not sure. The teachers were convinced he was just being his usual mischievous self. I’m less inclined to believe that a child climbs up onto a three storey roof to cause trouble without lacking <em>some</em> emotional or behavioural common sense. But I guess I don’t know anything about children.”</p><p>“You seem like you’re managing just fine,” she pointed out.</p><p>Arthur smiled in return. “Thanks, Julie. Why’d they pull you out here? This kind of case is about as typical for you as it is for me.”</p><p>“Oh, you know the usual child protection style, I’m a woman. Can’t trust male officers with children because of their inherent perverted ways unlike us perfectly maternal females. And apparently I wasn’t looking busy enough at the station,” she said, shrugging. “They’re sending someone from social services down here too but they think it may take a while. Their team is apparently more short-staffed than ours, if you can believe that.”</p><p>He scoffed at the information. “Sounds about right.” He opened his mouth to speak again but was interrupted by the opening of the door and the entrance of a young female doctor into the clinic room. The doctor smiled encouragingly at him, approaching his seat and crouching low to the ground in a non-threatening manner. Arthur could see that the pockets of the white lab coat hanging open over her floral dress were stuffed with lollipops and stickers which made him smile. He watched as she gently called the boy’s name, rousing him from his sleep. Arthur could feel the boy wriggling again, but couldn’t see whether or not the child was looking at the doctor.</p><p>“It’s ok, Harry,” said Arthur, speaking directly to the child for the first time since the ambulance, when he had tried unsuccessfully to detach the boy from his person. “The doctor just wants to have a look and make sure we didn’t hurt anything up on the roof ok?”</p><p>The boy made no move to acknowledge Arthur’s words other than to sigh quietly against his neck. Arthur decided to try again. “Look, the doctor is going to check me out first.” He met the doctor’s eyes and she nodded back at him. “We can start with my free arm, Doctor Lewis.”</p><p>An hour later, Arthur was standing out in the hallway across from a vending machine. He folded his arms across his chest, feeling a little relieved he was free to do so again. Harry had taken possession of his right leg this time, one arm curled loosely just above Arthur’s knee while the other hand held a chocolate bar to his mouth while he watched with wide eyes as people hurried past. His head swivelled up and down the corridor to look at Julie Davis as she approached them, smiling again. She paused briefly to ask Harry if his treat tasted good and turned to face Arthur after receiving a feeble confirmation nod from the child.</p><p>“I’m not going to like this, am I?” asked Arthur, noticing now up close that her smile was more forced than it usually appeared to be.</p><p>She shook her head and handed him a manila folder. Opening it, he spent a minute skimming through the report before deciding he’d seen enough. He snapped it shut, shoved it back into Davis’ hands and took a moment to collect himself. One of Davis’ hands fell onto his shoulder in what he assumed was intended to be a calming gesture but he didn’t find himself feeling very calm. He blew out a stream of hot air, feeling her grip tighten around his muscle. He shook it off gently, bending down to scoop up the little boy in his arms again who let out a small sound of surprise before settling happily again.</p><p>“Julie, I think I’m finally hungry enough to resort to eating some McDonalds.”</p><p>The other officer raised her eyebrows. “Aren’t we supposed to stay here until the social worker arrives?”</p><p>“They can meet us back at the station. There’s a McDonalds around the corner from it.”</p>
<hr/><p>Arthur had watched Harry explore the <em>Happy Meal</em> with amusement before realising suddenly that his wonder was born out of lack of exposure to normal childhood experiences. The smile on his face and his good mood died pretty quickly after that and he picked pathetically at his own burger. He was aware of Julie’s concerned eyes on him as they walked back to the station, Harry walking with one hand gripped in his own. Julie had at one point tried to hold his other hand, but the kid had shied away quickly and she hadn’t pushed it further.</p><p>He ignored the surprised looks of the other officers in the building as they walked through. He felt a wave of appreciation for Julie having called ahead of them as it meant they moved through uninhibited. Arthur led them towards one of the conference rooms used rarely for meetings, flicking the lights on with his elbow. He glanced down at Harry and saw that he was peeking at the room from behind a hand that was covering his face.</p><p>“Not exactly the most comfortable place to keep a child,” said Julie, looking around at the long table and chairs surrounding it.</p><p>“Better than interview room three,” replied Arthur, earning a laugh from the woman.</p><p>He bent over and scooped Harry up, carrying him to the chair furthest away from the door. He placed the boy down gently, shrugging out of his jacket and wrapping it around him. The green eyes watched him carefully, accepting the demonstrations of affection without complaint.</p><p>“Will you direct the social worker here when she comes please, Julie?”</p><p>The police officer smiled enthusiastically at him, taking his hint. “Of course, Arthur,” she said, before leaving the room quietly.</p><p>The two males were left staring at each other. “What am I going to do with you?” asked Arthur rhetorically. Harry blinked back.</p><p>The idea came to him instantly. It was the only magic he could ever manage to do for himself. Arthur tore the page out of a notepad sitting on the table, ignoring the messy edges as he scrawled her true name across the middle of the paper. He dropped the pen and glanced at the name briefly. Without having to think about it, he pulled out the box of matches he kept in his trouser pocket. After shaking one into his hand, he struck it alight. He held the match upright, watching the flames lick their way downwards slowly against the resistance. When he felt the flames hit his skin, he dropped the match. It fell perfectly onto the written name, burning quickly through each letter. The final one was still legible beneath the fire when he sensed the subtle change in the room’s atmosphere.</p><p>He looked up to find her sitting opposite him at the table. She was watching him, her face blank of any expression. He noted with a little amusement that he was still surprised to find she hadn’t changed very much. Her hair was shorter and wilder than it had been, though he supposed that was part of the fashion of this time. Like him, her face had still not been marked by time or hardship.</p><p>“Hi,” said Arthur, clearing his throat when he heard how hoarse he sounded.</p><p>“Hi,” she responded, sounding just as he remembered.</p><p>They continued to stare at each for a long moment, each obviously unwilling to be the one to start a conversation. Eventually Arthur sighed, breaking the silence and rubbing a tired hand into his brow.</p><p>“What am I to call you now?” he asked, feeling as dejected as he sounded.</p><p>She seemed to think before she answered him. “It’s <em>Helena</em> at the moment. And you?”</p><p>“I find myself unable to call myself anything but Arthur now.”</p><p>She did not mock him as he expected. Instead she smiled, leaning towards him with her chin resting on her palm. “You have always been more attached to your own name than I have been to mine.”</p><p>He grinned, feeling his stomach turn pleasantly at the idea of being with someone he didn’t have to hide from, someone who knew him.</p><p>“I had forgotten you could smile,” said Helena lightly. “You haven’t smiled at me in over forty years now. I thought your pretty face was lost to me forever.”</p><p>He rolled his eyes reflexively. “If I refused to talk to you every time you did something morally ambiguous, we wouldn’t know each other at all.”</p><p>“Perhaps, but forty years is a long time to keep a girl waiting.”</p><p>Arthur’s eyes drifted to the side of the table where he’d placed Harry. The boy was wrapped in his coat acting as a blanket, his frame so small he fit completely comfortably in one conference chair. His dark mop of hair was only just visible from where he had snuggled under the clothes, sleeping peacefully. Helena’s eyes followed his.</p><p>“It’s funny, Arthur, how you always call me after you’ve done something stupid. Never before. You make me feel like some kind of personal damage control for you.”</p><p>Heat rose to Arthur’s face. “I haven’t done anything stupid.”</p><p>“No?” asked Helena, one eyebrow raised at him. “You have nothing to do with that child over there then? It’s a complete coincidence he’s in here with us?”</p><p>“He needs help,” said Arthur through gritted teeth. He tried not to raise his voice, knowing it would likely upset Harry.</p><p>“Of course he did, and as usual you are the only one selfless enough to give it, Arthur.”</p><p>His eyes lingered on the boy, flinching on her words because he knew that she right. “I couldn’t leave him, Helena. He was literally on a bloody roof. And he has magic. I can feel it.”</p><p>“Yes, he does, like many other children his age. Not exceptional talent by any means but not particularly weak either. I’m sure with practice and determination he’ll manage to become your average every-day wizard and lead a perfectly normal magical life.”</p><p>Arthur shook his head. “No, he must be stronger than that. I can <em>feel</em> it, radiating out of him constantly. It’s driving my nerves crazy. I haven’t been able to feel magic like this since that time we were in Australia, do you remember? That was almost a century ago now and I’ve tasted magic since, but none of it feels like this.”</p><p>He did not like the look that formed on her face. “That is because what you’re sensing is not his magic, Arthur. The boy is cursed.”</p><p>A cold sensation washed over Arthur as her words hit him. He gasped, suddenly feeling short of air. His right hand flew to his throat to loosen his collar, fearing that he would suffocate or else vomit shortly. His eyes slid closed as he struggled to fight a wave of darkness that bested him, making him feel ill from his head to his toes. He opened his mouth again to cry for help when instantly the feeling faded and warmth spread through his body again.</p><p>He opened his eyes to see that there was no longer a table between them. Instead, Helena stood in front of Arthur, one hand cupping his cheek. The heat from her touch was comforting and Arthur found himself sinking into her hand.</p><p>“I told you that you did something stupid,” said Helena, amusement hidden in her words.</p><p>Arthur smiled dopily back, feeling almost high on her warmth. “What just happened to me?”</p><p>“You were out of your depth, little Prince,” she replied. “You lost yourself in the darkness of that curse and you did not know how to bring yourself back. The perils of being able to sense a magic you either know or can do nothing about.”</p><p>“Thank you,” said Arthur sincerely. She nodded in acknowledgement. His eyes drifted back to Harry, who hadn’t stirred. “Did he feel that?”</p><p>“No. I imagine he’s quite immune to most of the darkness. He has been living with it for most of his life now and children are great at adapting.”</p><p>“What’s wrong with him? I’ve known cursed children before, and none of them have made me feel like that.”</p><p>He placed his hand on Helena’s where it still held him. She did not take the cue to let him go, probably concerned that he would lose himself again.</p><p>“There is another soul attached to his own,” began Helena, “the remnants of a powerful wizard who attempted to steal his life in order to extend his own. It only half worked: you know as well as I do that achieving immortality is a tricky business.”</p><p>“What do you mean, that it half worked?”</p><p>“That he neither failed nor succeeded. He does not live, but he cannot die while a part of him exists in that child. It is magic that is cruder and older than even you and I. How it managed to survive time irritates me, when so much better magic has been lost.”</p><p>“What does it mean for him? For Harry, I mean?”</p><p>Helena did not answer him for several seconds. “I’ve never had prophetic powers, Arthur. But life will undoubtedly be difficult for him. You are out of your depth here. There is little you can do to support a magical child.”</p><p>“I can do more than the bastards they had him with already. He was miserable there, they were abusing him.”</p><p>She did not react with shock or horror. He knew that she wouldn’t be surprised to hear any more about the evils of the world.</p><p>“I can help this one,” said Arthur, sounding as if he was trying to convince himself as well as her. “I know I’m not magical but I can help him. All children need someone to look after them.”</p><p>Helena stared into his eyes. Arthur swore he could feel her evaluating the weight of his conscience in that look.</p><p>“They do. But helping this child will not right wrongs of the past. You know that, don’t you Arthur?”</p><p>He swallowed. “Believe me, I do. But maybe it will help me feel a little bit better about myself.”</p><p>It was the most honest he had been with anyone, including her, in centuries. Helena smiled in response.</p><p>“If you expect me to give up my single-lady lifestyle in order to help you out with another one of your stupid <em>save the world</em> kind of ideas, you could at least make an honest woman out of me.”</p><p>Arthur grinned. “You’re not going to make me go down on one knee and beg are you?”</p><p>“Not yet,” answered Helena, staring thoughtfully at her left hand. He picked it up in his own, raising it to his mouth and kissing it softly. “But you’re going to have to buy me a massive diamond.”</p>
<hr/><p>Arthur had bundled the still-sleeping Harry onto his lap before the social worker had come into the room, hoping the sight was wholesome enough to win her over. Helena stood up to greet the other woman, leaning over the table to shake hands with her. The social worker smiled reflexively, which was a reaction Arthur was well used to. Helena had an incredible ability to charm people into trusting her. He was never quite sure if it was a magical ability, or purely driven by her appearance and personality.</p><p>“I’m sorry it’s taken me so long to get here,” started the social worker, sitting down with a heavy thud. “One of my colleagues is out sick and honestly Harry’s case was lower down on the priority chain given that we knew he was obviously very safe here.”</p><p>“That’s alright,” said Arthur, attempting a charming smile of his own. The woman gaped at him, eyes sliding between him and Helena slowly. “We’ve been able to keep Harry comfortable at least.”</p><p>The social worker’s eyes returned to Harry, smiling at the image of him sleeping soundly. “Yes, I can see that. That’s fantastic. I was quite surprised when I got your call honestly. Usually I turn up at police stations to take children off to care homes. It’s not often that the police officers are providing their own solutions.”</p><p>Arthur glanced at Helena. “Well, I guess Harry and I have been glued together since I took him away from his school. He’s been reluctant to go to anybody else and when I called ‘Lena to tell her why I was stuck at the station, she decided to come by and drop us off some dinner.”</p><p>“And just look at them,” continued Helena, her voice soft and sappy. “Aren’t they just the sweetest pair? I think I fell in love with the boy as soon as I saw them together.”</p><p>The social worker nodded slowly, chewing on a pen she had pulled from her pocket. Arthur wasn’t sure why she had it when she had no paper out to write on. “And you two are married?”</p><p>“Six years now,” supplied Arthur, feeling only slightly guilty over the lie.</p><p>“No children yet,” added Helena, anticipating the next question. “I unfortunately have a medical condition where I can’t have children naturally.”</p><p>“I’m so sorry,” said the social worker sympathetically. “That’s why you applied to become foster carers?”</p><p>Arthur nodded as Helena slid the folder containing all of their documentation across the table. None of it had existed an hour ago. He felt paranoid that she had messed up somehow in falsifying the papers – how would she know what a real foster care certificate looked like after all?</p><p>The social worker took the file and flicked through it briefly, pausing over one or two documents to read more deeply. “And you are still set up and ready to go?” she asked. “You have space for Harry ready?”</p><p>“Just need to put new sheets on his bed,” replied Helena immediately. Yeah, thought Arthur, new sheets on the nonexistent bed in the impersonal spare room in his two-bedroom flat.</p><p>“Well, it seems like everything is in order then. Although he’s been so unfortunate to end up here, I think Harry’s very lucky the two of you found him.”</p><p>“Thank you,” said Arthur, feeling his arms instinctively tighten around the boy. “We’ll do right by him, I promise.”</p><p>The social worker smiled again, looking tired as she stood up from the table. “I’m just going to have to make some calls to update my supervisor, but I’ll be back shortly with the paperwork.”</p><p>They nodded enthusiastically as she left the room, turning towards each other as soon as the door closed. Arthur freed a hand and held it out to her. She high-fived him instantly.</p><p>“So a thousand years on and I am officially a dad,” said Arthur, looking down at Harry. “I’m already starting to feel some empathy for dear dead father. Maybe he wasn’t so bad after all.”</p><p>Helena rolled her eyes. “It pains me to compliment you but you’ve nothing to worry about. Of the two of us, you’ll definitely be the better parent, Arthur.”</p><p>He closed his eyes, mentally berating himself. “I’m sorry, I didn’t even think about how hard this must be for you.”</p><p>“It’s not. Like you said, it’s a thousand years on. I’m long over it.”</p><p>Arthur suspected that what she said wasn’t true but he didn’t have time to question her. The door opened and the social worker slipped in again. Arthur frowned when he noticed the change in her demeanour and noticed Helena sit up straighter beside him. When she had last entered the room, the social worker had looked worn-out and stressed but kind. Arthur noticed that those impressions of her had faded away into a vacant expression.</p><p>“That was fast,” said Helena, her voice sounding cold. Arthur opened his mouth to give out to her for sounding too harsh when he realised the social worker wasn’t carrying any papers for them to sign.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” began the social worker, her tone void of the musicality of natural speech. “It appears I was mistaken. We have located another relative of the child and he is here to take him home.”</p><p>Helena leant forward, resting an elbow on the table and putting her chin on her hand. Arthur, in comparison, leaned further back into his chair, readjusting Harry so that he hid him more behind one shoulder.</p><p>“You’ll have to forgive me, I might sound stupid here repeating you,” started Helena, “Five minutes ago when you left this room you told us Harry would be coming home with us. In that short amount of time, you have sourced a new guardian for him that you are more convinced will serve him better than us? You have me very confused.”</p><p>The social worker stood staring at them blankly. Helena continued speaking while Arthur struggled to find words. “I think we’ll have to ignore what you just said and take Harry home with us anyway. So <em>you will</em> bring us the fostering papers.”</p><p>The words were an order, not a request. The woman blinked absently at them, unmoving from where she stood despite Helena’s command. Suddenly the social worker’s nose started to bleed and she swayed on her feet. Arthur felt the urge to rush to her, inhibited by the weight of Harry against his chest. He didn’t need to move in the end because a chair slid out from the table and safely caught the woman as she collapsed.</p><p>Arthur had no time to react to the sight because another person had joined them in the room. It was an old eccentric-looking man, with long grey hair and a beard to match. He was dressed in what Arthur recognised to be the ridiculous fashion of wizards, a deep blue colour to his robes. Arthur could sense the magic crackling in the air around him, but it felt old and dusty unlike the one he felt from Harry. The old wizard was smiling at them from behind half moon glasses, obviously trying to emit a grandfatherly image. Arthur felt his blood run cold.</p><p>“It appears we have had a misunderstanding,” said the wizard, continuing to smile.</p><p>“What’s that then?” asked Arthur, finding his voice again. He noted that Helena was very still beside him, watching the man closely.</p><p>“It seems as if we all want the best for young Mr Potter there. Fortunately, some of us know how to best provide for him.”</p><p>“Are you referring to yourself?” questioned Arthur, working to keep calm.</p><p>“Of course,” replied the wizard. “It is very noble of you to offer your life to help Mr Potter, but it is ultimately unnecessary. We have already ensured he is in the best place possible to provide him with the life he needs.”</p><p>“Are you talking about his aunt and uncle’s house? Where they kept him in a cupboard under the stairs?” asked Arthur, anger clear in his tone. “Are you one of the people responsible for keeping him there?”</p><p>“Please, Detective. Keep some civility in yourself and <em>listen</em>.”</p><p>The air seemed to shimmer in the room for a moment and Arthur felt a tug deep in his stomach that left him with a sick feeling. Beside him, Helena started to laugh softly. It was not a happy or light sound. It sent a chill down Arthur’s spine.</p><p>“There is no point in you trying to influence either of us,” warned Helena, her voice dangerous. “Neither of our minds can be led by suggestion magic. If you want the boy, you will have to take him by force and I don’t think that will end with the result you expect.”</p><p>Arthur looked between Helena and the unknown wizard, tension palpable in the air. “Who are you?”</p><p>Helena answered the question before the man had the chance to. “He is Albus Dumbledore, Order of Merlin, first class. Headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards, and Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot.”</p><p>“Ah,” said Dumbledore with twinkling eyes. “You have heard of me.”</p><p>“I have seen your <em>Chocolate Frog</em> card,” said Helena. “It is my least favourite of all of them. Tell me, Mr Dumbledore, do you think the Wizengamot would enjoy the idea of you controlling the minds of mundanes in order to further your own agenda? I thought that had been illegal in this country since the eighteenth century.”</p><p>“I do not take kindly to threats, my lady,” said Dumbledore calmly.</p><p>“Nor do we,” said Arthur, before either of them could say any more. “I’m not sure what your agenda is here, but it’s not going to work. We are taking Harry home with us and there’s nothing you can say or do that will stop us.”</p><p>He resisted looking at Helena, hoping that she agreed with him. Arthur knew his own determination would not be enough if Dumbledore decided to fight him with magic.</p><p>“I don’t believe you understand what you are involving yourself in, my boy,” said the wizard. “There is other kinds of magic here you clearly have no understanding of.”</p><p>Helena spoke before he could. “No form of protective magic is powerful enough to warrant the abuse of a child.”</p><p>No one spoke for a minute, the air feeling heavy between all of them. Harry still didn’t stir in his chair. He was beginning to suspect that Helena had helped the boy fall into a deep sleep.</p><p>“We are at an impasse,” said Helena. “You do not want to let us leave with the boy, but we will not let you leave with him either. The only point worth noting however is that we currently have the boy which gives us the upper hand. You will not be able to take him unless you fight through us first, and that is not exactly something the Supreme Mugwump can do, is it?”</p><p>“That boy will die in your care,” said Dumbledore suddenly.</p><p>“I am willing to take that chance, but you are underestimating us,” said Helena. “Arthur will do his absolute best for that boy, and you can guarantee that I will be with him every step of their journey to protect them.”</p><p>She stood from her chair suddenly, holding her right hand in the air. Without a sound, a silver knife appeared in it. The blade was long, and from where he sat, Arthur could see a swirling design down the length of it. Helena held her left palm upwards and ran the knife across it quickly. Arthur did not flinch as blood started to flow freely from the wound. He watched carefully as the knife disappeared and she dipped her uninjured fingers into the laceration, smearing them with blood. She turned towards Arthur then, bending down to the ground and swiping her fingers along the laminate floor. She paused to dip her hands several times back in the source of the blood. A minute or two later, she moved towards Harry, repeating her movements on the floor below him. Arthur glanced down at the circle surrounding him on the floor, messily painted in her blood.</p><p>“You should be satisfied, Mr Dumbledore,” said Helena casually. “One blood spell replaces another.”</p><p>“What have you done?” asked the wizard in horror.</p><p>She held her still oozing hand up at him. “<em>Leave</em>,” she commanded him, and Dumbledore disappeared instantly. She sank back into her chair then and blew on her hand as if to cool it. It didn’t knit itself back together like Arthur expected. Instead she summoned a bandage from the air and began wrapping it around the wound.</p><p>“What was that?” asked Arthur in surprise, watching her wind the dressing around.</p><p>“Exactly what it looked like. Blood magic. Come on, Arthur, keep up.”</p><p>“I didn’t realise you liked me enough to commit yourself to me like that.”</p><p>“Either did I, so you really better like that child.”</p>
<hr/><p>It had taken some time for Helena to rouse the social worker and help her complete the necessary paperwork for them to leave legally with Harry. Arthur had left the boy with Helena while he went back to his desk, picking up his backpack that held the essentials like his house keys and wallet. Feeling eyes on him, he looked up. Julie Davis was standing watching him, her hands clasped in front of her.</p><p>“You all sorted then?” asked Julie brightly. “You’re really going to take the kid home with you?”</p><p>Arthur nodded and gave her a smile. “Yeah, it’s going to be a steep learning curve for the next twelve years.”</p><p>“You’ll do it,” she replied earnestly. “You’ll be a great dad.”</p><p>“Thanks, Julie.”</p><p>Helena appeared behind the police officer then with Harry perched on her hip. “Hey, can we get the car keys?” she asked, holding out her hand. “I just want to get him settled in.”</p><p>Arthur tossed the bundle of keys at her. She caught them without passing any remarks to Julie and carried Harry off, whispering something to him as they disappeared out of the station. Arthur’s gaze followed for as long as he could see them.</p><p>“Wow,” said Julie, breaking his stare and bringing his attention back to her. “I had kind of worried what the story was with you being married, seeing as how you haven’t mentioned it in the year that we’ve worked together.”</p><p>He winced. “Julie-”</p><p>“No, really, please don’t,” she said, holding up her hands defensively. “You’re really lucky, she’s a beautiful woman. I hope that you continue to be very happy together.”</p><p>Julie turned around after that and stormed off, leaving him behind to scratch at his head in confusion. The feeling lasted until he got out to the car and climbed into the driver’s seat, looking thoughtfully at the boy in the car seat that hadn’t been there a couple hours ago.</p><p>“I think I just messed up the one positive working relationship I had in this station,” said Arthur, staring absently at the building through the windscreen.</p><p>“Of course you did,” said Helena. “She liked you because she fancied you and now that you’ve paraded your wife throughout your workplace, she’s feeling hurt and betrayed because you led her to believe that there was a chance something might happen between the two of you. What? Don’t look at me like that. It was written all over her face, I didn’t have to read her mind to find that out.”</p><p>Arthur sighed. “She was a nice girl.”</p><p>“She’ll probably still sleep with you if you spin some kind of story for her. I’m too busy with the baby and just don’t want to have sex with you, or I’m secretly gay and you only married me out of loyalty to protect me from my abusive parents. She’ll fall over herself to get into bed with you.”</p><p>He rolled his eyes but a small chuckle came out of his mouth with it. “No, I’ve made a commitment to you now. I can’t bring other women into our marriage bed.”</p><p>The words were intended as a joke but instead they hung heavily in the air between them. He could not swear an oath as significantly as she could given his lack of magic, but he was as loyal to her as she was to him.</p><p>“Do you think it sad,” asked Arthur, their eyes meeting, “that you are the only friend I have had for the last millennium?”</p><p>Her hand fell down onto his, their fingers intertwining on the gearstick. “Of course it’s sad, Arthur. You’ve had a sad soul since before I met you.”</p><p>He flinched as a shout came from behind him, breaking the sincerity of the moment.
