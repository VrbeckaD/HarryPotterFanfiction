    <p>“Say, Newt, did you know that Tina Goldstein is dying?”</p><p>Newt felt his heart drop. He stayed silent as his face turned a deathly white. </p><p>“Davy, hold your tongue,” Queenie snapped, as she gave the child a menacing look. She turned her attention back to Newt and her eyes softened. “Newt, don’t look like that! We didn’t mean to tell you so suddenly.”</p><p>He seemed to be dragged back into reality by her words.</p><p>“So...it's true…?” </p><p>His voice cracked and sounded as though he hadn't used it in years </p><p>“Tina's very ill.” Queenie said with a hint of sorrow in her voice. "She took down with typhoid fever just after you left for Echo Lodge. Did no one tell you?”</p><p>Newt shook his head and looked down. “No..” he answered softly. He was too stunned to feel anything other than shock. </p><p>“It was a very bad case from the start. The doctor said she’d been terribly run down. They’ve a trained nurse and everything’s been done. DON’T look like that, Newt. While there’s life there’s hope.”</p><p>“Mr. Graves was here this evening and he said he had no hope for her.” Davy called from beside his mother. Queenie, with an irritated groaned, grabbed the young boy by his arm and marched him out of the room. </p><p>She returned moments later to find Newt still standing, looking lost. </p><p>“Oh, DON’T look so, dear,” said Queenie, walking over to give Newt a comforting hug. “I haven’t given up hope! Tina's strong, there's no way she'll give up that easy!”</p><p>Newt gently pushed Queenie's arms away from him, walked blindly out of the room and up the stairs, Newt walked into the guest bedroom. At its window he sat on a chair facing outside, staring out unseeingly. The rain was beating down with a violent force as it bounced off the window, threatening to break in. The trees outside groaned in the tempest and the air throbbed with the thunderous clashes on the distant shore. And Tina was dying! </p><p> </p><p>Newt hung his head as he kept his agonizing vigil through the hours of storm and darkness. He loved Tina—had always loved her! He knew that now. He knew that he could no longer cast her out of his life without agony. And the knowledge had come too late. If he had not been so blind—so foolish—he would have realized his feelings earlier. But now she would never know that he loved her—she would go away from this life thinking that he did not care. He cowered down by the window and wished, for the first time in his young life, that he could die, too. If Tina went away from him, without one word or sign or message, he could not live. Nothing was of any value without her. He belonged to her and she to him. In his hour of supreme agony he had no doubt of that. She did not love Achilles Tolliver—never had loved Achilles Tolliver. And to think what he had felt for Leta Lestrange had been love. Now he must pay for his folly as for a crime.</p><p>Queenie peaked her head into the guest room before she went to bed. A frown spread across her face at the sight of Newt’s grieving form. Deciding to not disturb him, she quietly walked away. The young man sat there for a while, before unknowingly falling asleep. He woke up to the sound of his guest room door creaking. </p><p>“Newt, i’m sorry to disturb you, but you’ve got a package.” </p><p>Queenie stood at the door holding a brown paper package. Newt blinked, his eyes were red from the tears he shed the night before. Taking the mail, he attempted to thank her, but his voice cracked and sounded almost inaudible. </p><p>Inside was a stack of small books. The titles read: “Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.” He felt tears painfully fall down his face as he stared at the beautiful cover. </p><p>“M-my book...They said it wouldn’t be in for another few weeks…”</p><p>Queenie walked forward to look down at it. “You finally got published?”</p><p>Newt nodded and carefully took one of the hardcovers out. He let out a little smile as he opened the page to the inscription. </p><p>“Look here. 'This book couldn't of been completed without the generous help of my brother Theseus Scamander and closest friend Queenie. I would also like to thank the talented Tina Goldstein for not only giving me the title, but also giving me the idea to write this book. It would of never been completed without her.'” </p><p>Queenie smiled and picked up another book from the box. She opened it and read the inscription, she couldn’t help but let out a joyous little giggle. “It’s beautiful Newt.” </p><p>They stood there, admiring the book in silence. A distant whistle from outside caused Newt to snap his head up. He gripped the book tight and ran out of the room, leaving Queenie to look after him, confused. </p><p>Not caring about his ruffled hair or tear stained face, Newt ran out the door calling: “Credence!” </p><p>The young boy turned with a grin and gave out a cheerful good morning.</p><p>“Credence,” Newt panted as he finally caught up with him. “did you come from Tina’s?”</p><p>“Well, no, but i’m heading there now.”</p><p>Newt frowned slightly, but he held out the book in his hands. “Can you deliver her this for me?”</p><p>“Sure I can, but why don’t you just give it to her yourself? You can come with me if you like.”</p><p>Newt nodded eagerly. “Yes, please, I’d greatly appreciate it.”</p><p>Together, Credence and Newt made their way across the bridge and down the road to Goldstein’s house.</p><p>When he walked in, the house seemed darker than usual. A doctor led Newt upstairs into Tina’s room, and Newt had to hide a gasp of horror at the sight.</p><p>Tina lay still on her bed, her face a sickly greenish-white color. She turned her head slightly at the noise of the door. Her dull eyes started to sparkle with tears at the sight of Newt, but she quickly blinked it away. Newt thanked the doctor before smiling at Tina, tears starting to well in his eyes. </p><p>“Hello Teen. It’s me.” He whispered. </p><p>“Hey Newt.” She answered weakly, he almost couldn’t hear her. </p><p>Newt made his way closer to the bed, kneeling down on his knees in order to get close to her. </p><p>“Come to ask you for one of our old time rambles in the woods.” Newt said jokingly.</p><p>Tina smiled slightly and closed her eyes. “Wish I could go.” she whispered. </p><p>Newt looked at her sadly before glancing down at the object in his hands. “I brought you my book.”</p><p>Tina opened her eyes weakly, her smile dropping as she no longer had the strength to keep it up. </p><p>“I got published Teen!” Newt whispered, trying to hold back tears. “I wrote about my creatures. Just as you said I should.” </p><p>He couldn’t stop the tears from falling. He desperately tried to wipe them away, but they were hard to hide from the girl laying in front of him. </p><p>“Without any highfalutin mumbo jumbo.” Newt let out a small laugh through his subtle cries as he repeated a saying Tina had told him a year ago.</p><p>Tina just watched him, too weak to do anything else. Tears were welling in her eyes and there was nothing she could to do stop them. </p><p>Newt opened his book, leaning his elbows on the bed, he held it out in front of Tina so she could see. “I dedicated the inscription to Theseus and to Queenie. And to you.” Newt sniffled a little as he finished, watching Tina’s eyes scan the words on the page in front of her. </p><p>“I was planning on saving it as a wedding gift, and then I just decided I couldn’t wait.” Newt talked through fresh sobs that threatened to rack his body. He knew Tina was already engaged to Tolliver, even though he knows she doesn’t love him. </p><p>Tina decided to finally speak, her voice was weak and strangled. “Newt, there’s not going to be any wedding anymore.”  </p><p>“You’re going to get well Teen, I know you will.” Newt was more assuring himself than her. </p><p>But the girl continued. “I called it off.” She whispered. “It wouldn’t of been fair to Achilles.”</p><p>Newt just looked at her as tears fell down his face. She took a deep, rattling breath.</p><p>“There would never be anyone for me but you.” </p><p>Newt felt like his heart would explode. He knew Tina loved him, but hearing her say it so weakly made sorrow flood through him. He grabbed her hand before pulling it to his cheek, softly crying as he replayed her words over and over again in his mind. </p><p>He watched as Tina slowly fell asleep, shivering in pain and fever. Newt left his book on her bedside table before leaving.</p><p>“She’s asleep.” Newt informed the doctor as he walked downstairs. </p><p>“Good. You might not believe it, but she’s doing better. Had a close shave though.”</p><p>Newt gazed at him with eyes full of long lost joy. He thanked the doctor dearly and quickly made his way out of the house. Newt practically skipped all the way to Queenie’s home. The world seemed so clear and beautiful after hearing that piece of precious news. Tina is going to get better! Tina isn’t going to get married! Tina loves him, and he loves her!</p><p>A sentence from a very old, very true, very wonderful Book came to his lips,</p><p>“Weeping may endure for a night but joy cometh in the morning.”</p>
