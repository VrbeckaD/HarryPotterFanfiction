    <p>There is a universe out there that has a story about a young boy named Harry Potter who grew up emotionally abused and starved by his relatives where he was forced to do all the chores and sleep in a cupboard under the stairs all because some mad man named Voldemort killed his parents. He would have been rescued at age 11 by a half giant named Hagrid and found out he was a wizard invited to go to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He would go on to have an adventure at the end of every school year where finally in his seventh year at age 17 he would defeat Voldemort for good, but only after years of being loved by the public and then hated then being loved and then hated. He would go on to marry his Hogwarts sweet heart and have three children that would then go on to go to Hogwarts and have their own adventures.</p><p>There is also a universe out there where Harry Potter's parents never died and he grew up loved and surprisingly not a spoiled brat (since his father learned his lesson) where there was no yearly adventures for him to do and instead a Neville Longbottom had the adventures because he was the Boy-Who-Lived. Harry had normal enough school years and in his seventh year when Voldemort took over he stood up for the innocent when Neville was out hunting horcruxes. Neville would marry Ginny and Harry would marry some random witch he fell in love with.</p><p>But this story is not about either of those two universes. In this one Harry Potter has a younger sister, but by only one year, and he is still the Boy-Who-Lived. He and his sister, Clover Lillian Potter, still live with their magic hating Aunt and Uncle and brainwashed Cousin and are severally abusive. Harry tried to protect Clover but with her looking like a mini Lilly with the same shade of hair and eyes and not needing glasses it was hard since Petunia was always looking for a way to "punish" Clover. When Harry went to Hogwarts he was afraid to leave her alone. When he came back Clover was surprisingly not hurt at all since they were too afraid of Magic.</p><p>Now something else you should know in this universe is that no one knows Harry has a sister since his parents had her when they were hiding from Voldemort, so they had no way to tell people. Only Albus Dumbledore, Poppy Pomfrey, Severus Snape, Minerva McGonagall, Hagrid, Remus Lupin, Sirius Black, and Voldemort know about Clover Potter.</p><p>The story will start in just a few moments during Clover Potter's sorting.</p>
