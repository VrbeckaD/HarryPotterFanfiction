</p><p>Harry was putting up with his terrible family and how neglected he was. He had his glasses were held together by tape because his uncle would break it many times. The thing that distinguishes Harry from others are several scares around his body, they seemed serpent scars. The always wondered about them, and the only response he would get is that he got the scars from the car accident where his parents passed away.</p><p>The truth is that they were afraid of him, there was always a death happening in every year around his presence, throughout kindergarden and elementary education. One of the kids cried with black tears until he died yelling out in pain, Harry remembered he was feeling weird when that happened, he felt as his scars were alive, the serpents slithering throughout his body.</p><p>Since that first event, he has been hearing voices, all of them claiming for his awakeness, for the coming of his three brides, and for his servants. All of them of his destiny which he couldn’t understand.  </p><p>It was until this day when he received a letter to him, the first time in his life he had received something to him and not to his family relatives. The letter was sealed with a Lion, Snake, Badger and Eagle surrounding an H. Harry was being invited and admitted into Hogwarts. The following day his uncle took him to the King’s Cross Station, and from there he went onto the train to Hogwarts.</p><p>In the train, there were many students going towards Hogwarts as well, and that’s when his heritage and prophecy started, as soon as he sat down, he fell down onto his knees, his eyes went black, his hair grew longer. He moved into the bathroom, crawling the best he could, and closed the door, and his body moved his head towards the ceiling, his mouth was opening completely widely as a black mist was coming out, not a bit of noise, but among the mist there were three serpents, one was dark purple, the second one was dark green, and the third one was dark red, they were slithering out of his mouth, and moved down the bathroom door.</p><p>“Naamah… Vanth… Jahi…” Harry said in latin as his teeth were becoming fangs, “Awake…” he said. The serpents were slithering faster and faster, one went through Hermione, the second one went through Fleur, and the third one went to Pansy. The serpent were entering the three girls in their virgin paths, breaking and sucking and entering into their souls. Their eyes went black but then they came back with some pain left. Harry went back to himself and moved to his seat.</p><p>“Vanth… Your name is Vanth, is not Hermione, you need to reborn for the Master” a voice said into Hermione as she was moaning, her eyes went into Fleur who had another voice, “Naamah… Feel your breasts, feel your corrupted hole, you need to fill them for generations to come, Fleur, awake us to our real being,” she moaned harder than Hermione and the last one, “Jahi… Feel the anger around you, the anger of war, the war mistress, get your gear,” Pansy heard as was getting the anger.</p><p>Harry’s scars were burning his skin, they were alive, and they were tasked to awake him into a new being. New voices were sounding within his mind, he could hear the yells of orgasms, the yells of desperation and pain, and lastly the yells of punches, of battles, of blood licking. He could feel now three distinctive being in the train to Hogwarts.</p><p>Fleur was masturbating with her hand of her pockets, but she needed something, something she couldn't figure it out, she needed to get more orgasms, the ladies next to her were so delicious, but she was holding herself, she cannot be caught. Hermione was smelling the sickness throughout the train, she felt them, the army that was inside some boy's body, it was devouring him in a simple cold, she could feel them corrupting each of his cells, she was getting high, she moved out of her cabin to his. Lastly, Pansy was looking firmly at Draco who was next to her, she opened her mouth slightly and he started fighting to the guys in her cabins, they were all fighting around her to the point of drawing blood. </p><p>
