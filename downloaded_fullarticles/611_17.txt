    <p>Hermione stood in front of her girlfriend of four years, with an amused look on her face.<br/> <br/> Said blonde was currently sitting on the sofa, her arms crossed and a pout on her lips.<br/> <br/> “I'm not going 'Ermione”<br/> <br/> “You have to go Fleur, it's your job!”<br/> <br/> “But I don't want to!”<br/> <br/> Hermione sighed. She couldn't remember the amount of times they've had this discussion in the last month. “You were hired straight after your graduation over three years ago. Why are you suddenly acting like this now?”<br/> <br/> “I won't be able to spend any time wiz you!”<br/> <br/> Hermione tried hard to resist the adorableness of the blonde. “That hasn't been a problem before, so why is this year any different?”<br/> <br/> “Because you were still in school while I was working. And now you're not, it isn't fair that I will be teaching while you can do whatever you want”<br/> <br/> Hermione shook her head and sat sideways on Fleur's lap. The blonde wasting no time in wrapping her arms around her waist. “Is that it? You'll be worried because you won't know where I am or what I could be doing”<br/> <br/> Fleur blushed at the silliness of her worries but nodded any way. Pout still firmly in place.<br/> <br/> Hermione gave her quick peck on the lips. “You're being ridiculous”<br/> <br/> To Fleur's surprise and annoyance, the brunette slipped from her grasp and pulled her upwards. “Ma belle?”<br/> <br/> Hermione made her way to the bedroom with the veela in tow. “You leave in sixteen hours and we won't see each other again until just before Christmas”. She looked back to Fleur. "I think we should make every minute count, don't you?"<br/> <br/> She let out a surprised squeak as the blonde lifted her up bridal style and attached their lips firmly. Hermione didn't even realize they'd made it to the bedroom until Fleur threw her onto the bed with a growl and fire in her eyes.<br/> <br/> -/-/-/-/-/-</p><p>Fleur made her way through the grand hall towards the teachers table, greeting most of her students along the way.  As she sat down, she noticed the empty seat next to her and frowned. She turned to her right to the schools potions teacher. “<strong>Leo, where is Professor Willow?</strong>”</p><p>Said man looked at the blonde with an eyebrow raised. “<strong>Did no one tell you? He retired at the end of the last school year</strong>”</p><p>Before she could ask who his replacement might be, the headmistress rose from her seat and began the welcoming speech. “<strong>Welcome students to a new year at Beauxbatons Academy of Magic. I hope for all students, first years or last, that this will be a year of hard work, dedication and lasting friendships</strong>”</p><p>A small round of applause came from the students. As well as a few noticeable rumours about the empty seat.</p><p>“<strong>Returning students are sure to have noticed the absence of Professor Willow. Sadly he retired from teaching at the end of last school year and will be dearly missed. So before the feast begins, I would like to introduce our new ancient runes teacher, Professor Hermione Jean Granger!</strong>”</p><p>If Fleur’s eyes got any wider, she would’ve been worried that they could fall out. While the hall erupted into applause, the doors at the end of the hall opened to reveal the smirking brunette. As she made her way through the hall, Fleur’s eyes began to narrow. ‘<em>She will pay for this. I’m still sore from last night!</em>’.</p><p>When Hermione reached the table, Olympe bent down to kiss her cheeks. “<strong>’Ermione, it is so good to see you again. I am thrilled that you accepted my proposition!</strong>”</p><p>Hermione smiled and thanked her, aware of the glaring blonde just behind her. “<strong>Thank you Olympe, it was an offer I couldn’t refuse</strong>”</p><p>She took her seat next to Fleur who’s eyes were wide again. She waited for the students to be distracted by the food before leaning over and speaking. “Why did you not tell me zat you could speak French. Or that you got a job ‘ere?”</p><p>Hermione replied in perfect French. “<strong>I wanted to surprise you. Also you should know that I accepted this job with a small condition. So we have a room to ourselves</strong>”</p><p>Hermione’s French was doing horrible things to Fleur’s arousal. “I’m trying really ‘ard to be mad at you right now! I ‘ope you know I’m going to get you back for zis, big time”</p><p>The brunette leaned in close to Fleur. She whispered right into Fleur’s ear, her warm breath sending a shiver down the veela’s spine “<strong>I look forward to it</strong>”</p>
