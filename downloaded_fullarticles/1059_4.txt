It reminded Regulus of a younger Sirius, describing how he was going to slip frogspawn into Cissa’s tea, or, more disconcertingly, of Bella recounting the <em>things </em>she had done with that knife of hers.</p><p class="p1">“Isn’t it a little… messy?”</p><p class="p1">“Reg, that’s the <em>point</em>,” Evan sighed. Barty vigorously nodded his agreement. “Those <em>fucking </em>Gryffindors have pushed us too far, for too long. It was fine when they were just targeting Snape-”</p><p class="p1">“Yeah, who cares about <em>Snape?</em>” Barty sniggered.</p><p class="p1">“-but they got into our common room, Reg. What’s next? The dorms? Do you want to be sleeping with one eye open, a hand on your wand, wondering if you’re going to be attacked in your own bed?”</p><p class="p1">Regulus didn’t think that this was the time to bring up the fact that he did all those things anyway.

His stomach twisted and he closed his eyes, taking a deep breath before he gave a sharp nod.</p><p class="p1">“Alright,” he sighed. “We’ll do it.”</p><p class="p1"> </p></div>
