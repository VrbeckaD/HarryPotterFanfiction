  <strong>Three Years Ago</strong>
</p>
<p>Sirius Black raced past the quant wooden sign that read “Welcome to Godric’s Hollow” at a truly terrifying speed. There was no room in his mind for caution though, it had been pushed out by the echo of his cousin’s laughter as her words resounded through his thoughts.</p>
<p><em>“Too late, you’re too late…”</em><br/>
<br/>
“NO!” Sirius screamed again, the roar of the motorcycle swallowing the sound. He barely slowed as he turned onto the quiet residential streets, rubber screeching. No doubt he was waking up the poor bastards all safe and oblivious in their beds, sleeping off a night full of trick-or-treaters and bland suburban costume parties. Someone would call the police for certain. Sirius didn’t care. He didn’t care about anything except getting to the safe house before it was too late. </p>
<p>He took another turn so fast the inevitable finally happened. The bike overbalanced and Sirius hit the street, skidding and rolling as his motorcycle shot in the other direction. It went straight over a curb and crashed into an honest-to-god white picket fence, taking out both the fence and the rosebushes behind it. </p>
<p>Sirius’s mind kept spinning even after his body rolled to a stop. His helmet and the other protective gear had no doubt saved his life, but it still hurt like hell. He couldn’t breathe. Between the helmet and the pain radiating through his chest, his lungs couldn’t pull in enough oxygen. </p>
<p>Darkness surged up to try and swallow Sirius whole. It was only willpower and adrenalin that pushed it down again. His left arm wasn’t moving well, so he struggled to one-handedly pull off the helmet. It rolled down the street as he lay gasping on his back, cautiously flexing the rest of his limbs. </p>
<p>Lights were coming on it the houses around him. A porch light flickered on as a door opened, illuminating the name on the street sign above him.</p>
<p>Church Lane. </p>
<p>He was nearly there.</p>
<p>The pain seemed to flare and then recede as Sirius lurched to his feet. He staggered the first few steps. One ankle protested at bearing his weight, and his left arm still wasn’t working well, but after a few steps he gathered enough momentum and stability to break into a run. Someone shouted behind him, but Sirius couldn’t bother to make out the words. He was so close.</p>
<p>There was light ahead of him, bright and orange and wholly wrong on a quiet suburban street in the middle of the night. </p>
<p><em>“Too late, you’re too late…”</em> Bella cackled in his head. </p>
<p>Lungs burning and bones screaming, Sirius sprinted.</p>
<p>There were flames glowing inside the Potters’ house. Sirius could see them through the broken windows, see them licking at the beige siding Lily had hated and reaching up toward the black sky.</p>
<p>The gate was open, as was the front door. </p>
<p>Sirius nearly fell over James’s body just inside the door. His best friend, his brother, was sprawled on his back, neck twisted at an unnatural angle, his eyes wide behind broken glasses. </p>
<p>“No, no, no…<em>Prongs</em>…” Sirius dropped to his knees at James’s side and reached a shaking, gloved hand out. He stopped before he actually touched James’s cheek, unable to bear that final confirmation. He might have stayed there until the house burned down around him if the baby hadn’t wailed.</p>
<p><em>Harry.</em><br/>
<br/>
Harry was alive.</p>
<p>Sirius scrambled for the stairs. Smoke was billowing down from above, the air hot and choking, and Harry’s thin cries turned into coughs.</p>
<p>The door to his godson’s room was open, light and heat and dark smoke pouring through it. Sirius squinted and stooped, trying to get out of the worst of the smoke as the hot air scalded his throat and lungs. The changing table and a bookcase were overturned just inside the room, like they had been used in a fruitless attempt to barricade the door.</p>
<p>Lily lay in front of the burning crib. Unlike James, she’d died bloody and it didn’t look like she’d died fast. She was all red in the light of the encroaching flames, hair and blood and dead skin already beginning to blister.</p>
<p>If he’d wanted to cry at the sight of James, Sirius wanted to scream at the sight of Lily.</p>
<p>There was another body of the opposite side of the room. It was a man, dark haired and pale skinned, dressed in a blood-splattered suit. There was something very wrong with his face. His mouth hung open, teeth blackened and tongue gone. His eyes were the same, pits of grey-black char. He’d burned from the inside out. </p>
<p>Despite the mutilation, Sirius recognized him. He would have recognized Tom if only a single finger, or a thin strip of skin was all that was left of him.</p>
<p>“Fucking bastard!” He snarled and stomped on the corpse’s head for good measure. It crunched brittlely beneath his heavy boot, crumbling to ash beneath the thin layer of skin. Once again, Tom Riddle had managed to completely destroy Sirius’s life.</p>
<p>No. </p>
<p>Not quite completely.</p>
<p>A weak, squalling cough called Sirius back from the sucking void of despair he could feel opening within his heart. </p>
<p>Harry was alive.</p>
<p>“Harry!” He screamed his godson’s name. </p>
<p>He wasn’t in the crib, which was burning quickly now, consuming a pile of blankets and stuffed animals. Coughing as he inhaled lungfuls of scorching smoke, Sirius tore through the room, overturning a rocking chair and tossing aside more toys. </p>
<p>The house was groaning around him now. Flames were spreading across the ceiling and eating the rubber ducky wallpaper as they moved along the walls. Sirius wouldn’t leave though, not without Harry.</p>
<p>Another crying cough, quieter this time. </p>
<p>The closet! </p>
<p>Sirius yanked open the door, and there, hidden behind a stack of bedclothes and diaper packs was Harry, his face scrunched up and wet with tears, little limbs flailing as he tried to get out of the nest of quilts where Lily must have hidden him. Sirius scooped him up, grabbing a bedsheet along the way. He pulled the sheet up over Harry’s head, praying it would protect the toddler even the tiniest bit as he ran for the stairs.</p>
<p>Exhaustion and pain, exacerbated by the smoke scalding his lungs, made Sirius’s knees wobble. He nearly fell down the stairs, only just managing to twist enough to catch himself against the wall of the stairwell. His shoulder hit a framed photo of James and Lily at their wedding, knocking it to the ground, glass shattering. Tightening his grip on Harry, who was squirming and crying weakly beneath the sheet, Sirius charged down the rest of the stairs. Through the open front door, he could see the flashing lights of emergency vehicles just pulling up to the front lawn. Instinctively, Sirius ducked back before any of the firefighters could catch a glimpse of him. </p>
<p>Did he dare go to them? There would be questions. So many questions, and so many of them he would never be able to answer. He looked down at Harry then. His godson had been stuck upstairs breathing smoke mere feet from a raging fire. </p>
<p>It was the blood on the bedsheet that decided things for Sirius. At first he thought it must be his, but when he pulled the sheet back he saw something he’d completely missed as he’d pulled Harry out of the closet. There was a jagged cut across the boy’s forehead, half-hidden beneath his messy black hair. Harry needed medical attention. That had to come before anything else right now.</p>
<p>He was just about to head out the front door when a voice called his name from the back door. Sirius turned and ducked his head into the kitchen to see an enormous figure outlined in the open back door. “Black! This way!” Hagrid called. </p>
<p>Sirius had only met Hagrid a few times before, but he was loyal to Dumbledore, and right now the old man was the only ally Sirius had left. He followed Hagrid out the back door and through the overgrown backyard with its plastic swing set and sandbox. No one was there to see them. The neighbors and the firefighters were all concentrated at the front of the burning house. </p>
<p>There was an old Volkswagen Rabbit idling in the alley behind the Potters’ house. Hagrid directed Sirius into the back while he squeezed his bulk into the driver’s seat. Sirius unwound the bedsheet from around Harry as Hagrid slowly edged out of the alley, taking the back way around the block to avoid the chaos out front. Harry coughed a few times and his breathing sounded a little wheezy.</p>
<p>“Hagrid,” Sirius called hoarsely, falling into his own fit of coughing as Hagrid navigated out of the mazelike neighborhood of single-family homes and cul-de-sacs. “Hagrid…Harry needs a doctor. He was close to the fire, the smoke…”</p>
<p>Hagrid threw a look over his shoulder, concern scrunching his hairy face. Turning his eyes back to the road, the large man dug into his coat and emerged with a cell phone he passed back into Sirius’s trembling hand. “Not safe to stop here,” Hagrid said gruffly. “Call Dumbledore, he’ll get something arranged for the both of you by the time we get clear. Just keep an eye on the little tyke ‘til then.”</p>
<p>Sirius shifted Harry on his lap so he could use the phone. The toddler, woozy and exhausted though he was, resisted the movement, his short arms and tiny, grasping fingers clinging to Sirius’s road shredded jacket. “Mama,” he cried weakly, accidentally kicking Sirius’s left arm. Pain flashed like lightning from Sirius’s fingertips to his shoulder, making his head swim and his vision blur. Using his good arm, he managed to settle Harry against his side. For the first time it occurred to him that they didn’t have the baby in a car seat. Lily would kill him…</p>
<p>Only Lily couldn’t kill him because she was dead on the floor of her son’s burning bedroom. Images of the fire reaching her already mangled body flashed through Sirius’s mind. Harry was crying in earnest now, agitating his already sore throat with every howl and hiccup.</p>
<p>“Shh…it’s okay, pup,” Sirius tried to soothe him, clutching him close, the phone forgotten for the moment on the seat next to him. “It’s going to be okay, I promise. Uncle Padfoot’s here. I won’t let anything hurt you…”</p>
<p>“Mama!” Harry said again. Sirius caught Hagrid’s eye in the rearview mirror and shook his head at the unasked question, tears prickling in his own burning eyes. Not trusting himself to form actual words, he held Harry close and did his best to make soothing noises. </p>
<p>Sirius waited until Harry had cried himself to sleep before he picked the phone back up and found Dumbledore’s number programmed in the contact list. It barely finished the first ring before a familiar voice answered. </p>
<p>Dumbledore had always had a gentle voice, the sort that could stop a fistfight with only a few words. Tonight he sounded haggard and shaky as he said “Hello?” </p>
<p>“We fucked up,” Sirius croaked. “I fucked up…he didn’t fall for the bluff! He—”</p>
<p>“Don’t.” Dumbledore hissed. “Don’t talk about it over the phone, Sirius. Were there any survivors?”</p>
<p>“Harry…Harry’s alive,” Sirius said. He pulled the sleeping toddler closer even though the movement sent a wave of nauseating pain through his arm. “He needs a doctor, Albus…there was a fire and smoke…and he’s got a nasty cut across his head. I think I broke my arm too.”</p>
<p>“I’ll have a doctor waiting by the time you get here.”</p>
<p>“Where are we going?” Sirius asked. He felt lost, dizzy and adrift on an ocean of pain and grief. The child sleeping on his lap was the only thing keeping him afloat.</p>
<p>“Not over the phone,” Dumbledore repeated. “Hagrid knows. We shouldn’t stay on for long. We’ll talk when you get here. Toss the phone out the window when you hang up, and, Sirius…I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>He terminated the call before the old man could say another word. Sirius didn’t want to hear his sympathy. He rolled down the window, hearing the wind roar as it buffeted his face and whipped at his hair. The phone cracked into pieces the second it hit the pavement as they sped down the highway.</p>
<p>Hagrid stopped at a gas station twenty minutes later. He ordered Sirius to stay in the car, handing him a loaded pistol, while he ran in to the little 24-hour convenience store to pay for their gas. When he returned it was with wet wipes, a cheap first aid kit and four bottles of water. Hagrid took the gun again and got back on the road as Sirius guzzled water. He thought about waking Harry up to drink, but he was still sleeping and his breathing sounded better. Sirius couldn’t bear to wake him, not now.</p>
<p>Instead he pulled open the packet of wipes and carefully cleaned the cut on Harry’s forehead. It was crusted with dried blood though the actual bleeding seemed to have stopped. Using gentle, trembling hands, Sirius cleared away the blood, leaving the angry, jagged cut standing out against Harry’s warm brown skin. It looked like a bolt of lightning, he thought numbly.</p>
<p>“Where are we going, Hagrid?” Sirius asked. He’d assumed they were headed back toward the city, but the Rabbit had just sidled into an exit lane marked for Pennsylvania. </p>
<p>“Another safe house of Dumbledore’s,” Hagrid explained. “Some place outside of Scranton. I have the address.” Sirius nodded numbly</p>
<p>“Good, Harry’s going to need things…diapers, clothes, food, toys. I couldn’t grab anything from the house.”</p>
<p>It was so much easier to think of small, practical things like that. If he didn’t, if he made any room in his mind it would fill with images of three corpses in a burning house. Unfortunately, Hagrid didn’t realize exactly what Sirius was trying to avoid.</p>
<p>“Black, what happened?” The big man asked. “I got a call from Dumbledore, middle of the night, telling me to haul ass up to Godric’s Hollow, said the Potters were in danger. Lucky thing I was already up in Syracuse visiting a lady friend.”</p>
<p>Sirius wished he would have just kept rambling, even if it was about his sex life, but Hagrid looped back around to where he’d started. “I saw the fire and pulled around back to try and get close that way. What happened in there? What happened to James and Lily?”</p>
<p>“They’re dead,” Sirius said, each word burning his throat worse than any fire ever could. “Riddle killed them…I, it was my fault. I thought…I thought…”</p>
<p>He hung his head, hearing the echo of Bella’s laughter again. </p>
<p>
  <em>“You overestimate yourself, cousin…Why would the Dark Lord want you when he could have the Potters’ and their precious baby…”</em>
</p>
<p><em></em>“All my fault,” Sirius repeated. He’d thought he had such a clever plan, thought for certain Tom would relish the chance to come after him. Instead the bastard had gone to the one place he was never supposed to know about, the home where Lily, James, and Harry were hidden away. </p>
<p>“What happened to Riddle?” Hagrid asked tensely.</p>
<p>“Riddle’s dead,” Sirius said blankly.</p>
<p>Hagrid heaved a sigh of relief. “It’s over then…horrible price to pay, but—”</p>
<p>“It’s not over,” Sirius said sharply. He looked down at the toddler sleeping on his lap and ran a light finger across the scar on his forehead. “Tom Riddle’s dead. Voldemort isn’t.”</p>
