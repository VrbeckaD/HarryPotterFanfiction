    <p>*</p>
<p>Newt knows he’s not much of a talker.</p>
<p>Theseus (<em>hero; warrior</em>) understands him better than he understands himself sometimes, and so they can sit in companionable silence and communicate through pantomime and expression in lieu of phrases.</p>
<p>Jacob (<em>honorable; kind</em>) understands too, and he’s always willing to offer Newt assistance. When Newt struggles to express a concept, to find the words–so easily written, yet spoken with such difficulty–he’s there to help puzzle it out with gentle eyes and a broad grin.</p>
<p>Queenie (<em>soft; sisterly</em>) is remarkable in that vocalization isn’t necessary <em>at all</em>. She learns to pierce through the accent coloring his thoughts by dint of continuous contact, so when the pressure gets to be too much and his throat constricts, strangling his words, she appoints herself his mouthpiece.</p>
<p>Then there’s Tina, who is truly in a class of her own.</p>
<p>She is brave and true, the greatest of women; soft where he is hard, and much, <em>much</em> more than he deserves. Her generous nature complements his innate selfishness; her quick smile and slow temper complete his own mercurial disposition. Better still, she can understand the tilt of his head, the tenor of his footfalls without the benefit of words.</p>
<p>(<em>When he kisses her, language is superfluous because everything he needs and feels is there, buried in her skin, ripe for the taking.</em>)</p>
