    <p>July 25th, 1991 was a strange day for Hermione. She was woken up, not by the sun creeping across the London skyline as usual, but by someone banging around downstairs. Throwing on her hoodie and sneakers, Hermione rushed down the splintering stairs, arriving to a most peculiar sight. Standing in front of the electric wok and barely functioning microwave was an older woman, dressed in a wizard’s hat and some robes. She seemed to have tripped over the wok and was currently threatening to turn it into a “proper teakettle.”</p><p>“Hello?” Hermione called out, clutching the sides of her hoodie around her. The woman turned, her green eyes looking Hermione up and down.</p><p>“Hermione. . .” the woman began, stalling for a last name, before looking in confusion at a piece of paper in her hand. “Hermione,” she said again, more confidently.</p><p>“Yes?” Hermione asked, confused and more than a little annoyed. “Can I help you with something?” The older woman looked around the room. Abandoned floor, really.</p><p>“You live here?” she asked.</p><p>“Yes,” Hermione replied sharply.</p><p>“Are your parents nearby?”</p><p>“No idea.”</p><p>“Can you tell me your surname?”</p><p>“Don’t know it.”</p><p>“Okay then,” the mystery woman said with a sigh, looking around the room once more before turning towards Hermione. “Is there some place we can sit?” Hermione gestured to the floor.</p><p>“Standing it is then,” the woman declared. “Very well. I assume you have gotten your letter?”</p><p>“Which one?” Hermione asked cautiously. She had only gotten two letters--one from a client, the other some sort of prank--and didn’t want to screw up and conflate the two.</p><p>“The one about Hogwarts,” the woman stated dryly.</p><p>“Oh, right. Is this one of those practical joke shows? Are there hidden cameras somewhere?” Hermione craned her neck to look out across the room, but saw nothing beyond the usual dereliction.</p><p>“It is not a joke,” the woman said. She then drew a thin stick--a wand, Hermione guessed, and pointed it at an empty glass bottle. The bottle changed and enlarged, shifting into a comfy red armchair. The woman sat down in it, looking to Hermione with an eyebrow raised. Hermione was simply staring at the chair, hoping this woman didn’t bother to read the bottle’s label.</p><p>“Okay,” Hermione said tentatively. “What do you want me for?”</p><p>“A student,” the woman said indignantly. “You’re a witch.” Hermione laughed.</p><p>“I’ve been called that before,” Hermione said. “Don’t think she meant it quite as literal.” The woman’s brows furrowed as she pondered Hermione’s words. They darkened as she seemed to grasp the meaning.</p><p>“Alright then,” she said, her face clearing in an instance. “I am Professor Minerva McGonagall. I teach the Transfiguration class and I am the head of house for Gryffindor. Now go get dressed, we must go shopping for your school supplies.” Hermione blinked a few times before nodding and retreating upstairs.</p><p><em> Oh, what to wear? </em> she thought. All her clothes were for clubs, fancy parties, or doing nothing. She was currently in her doing nothing clothes. <em> Fuck it, </em> she thought, pulling out a cobalt blue cocktail gown. It was short, as most of her dresses were, but not to an indecent length. She chose to wear her short black heels and a bare minimum of makeup.</p><p> </p><p>McGonagall had let the dress go without comment. She was clearly overdressed for the Leaky Cauldron (that much had been obvious by the name alone) but on this magical boulevard known as Diagon Ally she seemed to fit right in. In fact, there was a woman with pale blonde hair whose dress was the exact same cut as hers. They smiled politely at each other as they passed, though the other woman had raised an eyebrow at McGonagall.</p><p>“We shall need to visit Gringotts first,” the professor had said as they exited the Leaky Cauldron. “Your supplies shall be purchased with funds from the Hogwarts Scholarship Fund. The bank is run by goblins, do be careful. They can be a bit prickly.” Hermione had simply nodded and carefully walked beside the professor and her tall, pointed hat.</p><p>Upon entering the bank, Professor McGonagall immediately acted counter to her own recommendation, practically demanding to speak to the “head goblin.” Hermione had a feeling that was not his actual title. Looking around, she had a feeling that most of the wizards had no idea how insulting the title was.</p><p>The goblin she presumed was the “Head Goblin” soon came out of a corridor, discussing something in low, whispered tones in a tongue she knew nothing of. Though it had a fair number of hard consonants, the endings and beginnings of words matched well, giving the language a sort of flowing quality.</p><p>“My lord,” Hermione said to the goblin with a curtsey. “May I ask what language you were speaking? It sounded quite beautiful.” The goblin, who had only just stopped talking, stared at her, his eyes wide. McGonagall was staring too.</p><p>“Gobbledegook,” he finally said. The name sounded rather ridiculous to Hermione. “That is what the wizards call it.”</p><p>“And what do you call it?” Hermione asked. The goblin arched an eyebrow towards her. He looked her up and down, taking far too long. Yet his eyes were not wandering or roaming like those of a horny man. They looked with observation and sadness, as if they could see through each of Hermione’s lies and layers of concealment and deceptions.</p><p>“You are here for the scholarship fund,” he said to McGonagall, his eyes not leaving Hermione’s.</p><p>“Yes,” McGonagall said. “And I do have other business--”</p><p>“We will take care of her,” the goblin said. “She will arrive at your train station on time.” McGonagall furrowed her brows and glared. As several goblins, these ones bearing some sort of antiquated polearm, emerged she nodded and left, leaving behind a confused Hermione and an apprehensive staff of goblins, a few of them armed.</p><p>“My lord,” one of them said. “Why are we--”</p><p>“Tell me child,” the ‘Head Goblin’ began. “How old are you?”</p><p>“Eleven, my lord,” Hermione replied.</p><p>“First year, then. You grow up with wizards?” Hermione shook her head. “Didn’t think so. See, you’re the first one to bow or curtsey to one of our lords since the 12th century.”</p><p>“What? Why?” The goblins all shrugged.</p><p>“Bigotry,” one of them answered simply. The others nodded.</p><p>“Glad to know that’s the same,” Hermione said with a sigh. “Hatred and rape, the two great constants.” If any of the goblins found her statement odd they did not comment.</p>
