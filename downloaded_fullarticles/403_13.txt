    <p>"Who in bloody hell is out on the hottest day of the summer?" Vernon Dursley bellowed as he opens the door.</p><p>"Hello, um, is this the Dursley residence?"</p><p>This was said from a girl, who sounded no older than Harry himself. It wasn’t a voice he recognized personally. He couldn't see her from where he was positioned in the kitchen cleaning up the turkey sandwich that was thrown to the ceiling during Dudley’s latest hissy fit. You’d think by now he would stop acting like a prat. The work of getting the mustard off alone was and ordeal since it splattered everywhere.</p><p>"Ummm yes, it is, are you here to see Dudley?" Vernon said with almost a little to interest. <em>Welp, I see that uncle Vernon is keen on setting up his son today. I mentally chuckle like anyone would be interested.</em></p><p>"Who's at the door, dear?" Petunia said as she walked to the door.</p><p>"Ummm no, who? My sister and I are here to see a Harry J Potter, we were told he lived at this very address. He's won an all-expenses-paid shopping trip to London's West End." Another voice said a bit more forcefully obviously tired of their avoidance and making them wait outside like this.</p><p>"But why would you want to see him! He's a delinquent; His parole officer says he needs one more strike and he'll be in jail. I have no doubt he's rigged the contest! I have no doubt it's our Dudley who won, I remember him entering such a contest.” Uncle Vernon said with his usual bluster and contempt having to speak about me at all.</p><p>“Are you sure you don't want to see Dudley," said Petunia urgently? Her face had this look of panic and desperation. her son, for her part, went to an all-boys boarding school and hadn't shown interest in dating. Harry chuckled internally, and his aunt worries over her son. Especially when he accused me of being gay when his parents are worried about the same thing.</p><p>"Yes, we're sure we're here to see Harry." They both said in unison tiredly. Now Vernon noticed Harry getting closer to the door to see who came to see him.</p><p>"Boy, we forbid you from speaking to…" his diatribe fell from his lip his eye took a glazed sheen, and his mouth became slack. Then he started moving towards the huge couch. Harry had to run to get out the way of the lumbering man who slumped onto the couch snoring like a chainsaw like he usually does. Petunia mouth starting gaping like a fish out of water too long and she started to sag before Harry's very eyes she starts sluggish blink her eyes as she started dragging her feet towards the loveseat than gracelessly falling on it and start huffing and puffing like she usually does when she's sleeping. Both are dripping a strange liquid off their clothes. One of the girls threw something at Petunia and Vernon that made each of them very sleepy.</p><p>Harry walked over to see who came to see him. Curiosity is getting the better of him. Considering how quiet the summer had been with no one contacting him. he knew he never entered a contest like that he was here enough to hear of contest like that. It's not often people visited him in this hell hole which he's forced to consider home. And anyone willing to knock out his evil relatives just to see him were already okay with him.</p><p>"Umm hello, I'm Harry. What did you do to them?" He said meekly.</p><p>"Hi, Harry! It's a bit of secret don't worry it should wear off in a few hours and they won't notice you're gone till someone brings up your name. Do you know where we can go where you can talk privately." One of the girls said to him.</p><p>Who Harry saw at the door was an odd sight. At the door two girls the same age but completely different from each other. One of the girls has caramel-colored skin, and the other was light skin, both wearing jewelry. The dark skin girl was wearing hoop earrings and two piercing on each ear with a heart locket and a chain with her name on it and silver chain with a box charm and the other had a lot of piercings on each ear. They looked like they have dressed differently but the same style. Like they want people to distinguish them apart since from what I could tell, they looked like twins.</p><p>"Alright, follow me to the old playground," Harry said. When they got there, they saw a boy taller than Ron but albeit darker than the girls.</p><p>"Hey Sam, put up the notice me not charms around the perimeter." The caramel-skinned girl said.</p><p>The now introduced Sam got out his wand and started cast the charm.</p><p>"Alright, it should be safe enough," Sam said</p><p>"Alright now tell what the hell is going on?" Harry was pointing his wand at them confused that they were able to do such advanced magic and even crazier, they were underage and in full view muggles.</p><p>"Okay I'm Katherine call me Kathy this is my little sister Lola, and that tall boy over there is Sam. What we know will basically explain things to you find out the truth about things you have no clue about. Before we begin to tell you everything, we need to give you a full scan of potions, charms or spells."</p><p>"How can I be sure to trust you?"</p><p>"If we were death eaters, we would've killed your whole family without a second thought, but I did wish your aunt and uncle did bring down Dudley, Lola and I have seen what's he's like, and we were looking forward to beating him to a bloody pulp. But I promise on our magic we all are on your side."</p><p>With a wand wave and a glow of white and no dead bodies, they were telling the truth.</p><p>"Now that the preliminaries are over, can I do the scan?"</p><p>"Alright scan away."</p><p>Kathy waved her wand at and said a spell in an odd tongue. And Harry starts to glow colors and change.</p><p>"Man, what did they to you?! Her face was shocked. Up until this moment, she seemed all business clinically detached from what she was doing or saying . As if she were talking about the weather, with the same passive and mundanity of it. But the façade was dropped, and I could see she was shocked and horrified.</p><p>“There's a tracking charm on you.” The look of horror and gapping becoming more pronounced.</p><p>They put you on a love potion Regimen; a bi-monthly oblivious potion is being given to you. I hate those it makes you ignore attractive features of the opposite sex. The side effect you miss important parts of instructions, and it takes longer to learn things then needed, you have magic blocks, and they put you on a loyalty potion, I see you've been obliviated too many times to count. Lola gets the potion the one I brewed for memory charms and loyalty potion the one you made for love potions and oblivious potions to negate their effect permanently and make it impossible for you to be effective again by smell or ingested."</p><p>Lola looked in the bag and found a bunch potion. They were all labeled and organized.</p><p>"Take these they're not nasty like Snape's potions. We brewed them ourselves knowing England would never sell them. We knew we were going to need them. Take the anti-love potion first. Wait a few minutes before drinking the other potion. Don't want to cause a jumble of reactions."</p><p>When he took the potion, the effects instantly noticeable Kathy and Loranni were featured were enhanced in his eyes. Like he was truly seeing them for the first time. He noticed Kathy was wearing glasses has long black hair. That she was taller than her sister by two inches. Lola had long black hair but had a blue and green streak in her hair and had bright purple eyes. They were both considered bombshells in any country they were residing had curved in all the right places. Harry was slack jaw at the sight. Any blooming feelings about Ginny were gone in Harry's mind.</p><p>"Hey, Kathy give him the second potion he's going to need it. Sam yelled out. With that, Kathy gave the second potion, and it felt like a rushing river was flowing through his mind, and all the closed memories were freed for him to remember. All the memories of the times of finding out Dumbledore's real plans, asking Hermione to the Yule ball and the kiss we shared when she said yes but then seeing Hermione memory erased about it ever happening. Ron was trying to steal my cloak and my broom. Dumbledore was erasing the memories from me and telling Ron not to do it. About when I was little when Professor McGonagall came and to check up on me. Asking about my health and welfare and brought Madame Pomphrey when I was eating food out of the dumpster so many memories. Somewhere I was near dying or painful. I can feel my heart breaking I remember her trying to take me out of here I remember Remus seeing me at school. He saw me being beaten up by my cousin saw how skinny I was and frail and knew he had to take care of me himself regardless of what Dumbledore said. Him taking me in his arms he got us as far as wales before Dumbledore step in the middle of our freedom and returned me back to my cruel relatives. I wanted to cry, but I knew I had to be strong I could cry tonight not now.</p><p>"Wow, this is a lot to take in." Harry looks like who could barely stand.</p><p>"Trust me we know," Lola said sadly.</p><p>How do did you know how to find me I thought Dumbledore said this place is unplottable. And how are you all doing magic and there are no owls swooping down with letters?</p><p>Please, we'll tell you in a minute we just get out of here his spies are all around, and we'll need your stuff, trust me. Kathy yelled out</p><p>"Mimsy!"</p><p>"I'm here, lady Kathy." Said Mimsy, who looks dressed nicely and not in the rags other elves Harry has seen.</p><p>"Mimsy can you please collect Harry things and take them to our manor here in the U.K. and please tell the other elves we will have a bit of company and to prepare rooms."</p><p>"Alright Lady Kathy"</p><p>"Just don't overdo it Mimsy."</p><p>Just like that, Mimsy left with a pop.</p><p>"Alright Harry I'm going to explain everything to you, but first we have to get Hermione. "</p><p>"Is something going to happen to Hermione," Harry said with a quiver in his voice.</p><p> </p><p>"Yes, they're going to start the potion for her to fall in love with Ron," Lola said, looking nauseous at the thought.</p><p> </p><p>"Don't worry we can get there quick Sam you got the carpet?"</p><p> </p><p>"The whole magic carpet flying thing in little kid's story is true!" Harry looked beyond shocked, but by now, he was starting to realize these kids are full of them best get used to it. There already done a lot of good by more than a particular friend can say for themselves.</p><p> </p><p>"Yeah, but these are better in a sense there almost completely undetectable. They're not like the one in movies that fly around on it. These are the one your ministry will never approve of; it will throw flooing in the trash. They're basically better the portkeys too."</p><p> </p><p>"How do they work?" Harry Asked.</p><p> </p><p>"The carpet can open a vortex at the end of a street. They have seats and seat belt to accommodate ten people, kind of like a roller coaster but better. All you have to do think of the person the carpet will do the rest. Let's sit Sam you're with me on the right and Lola sits with Harry on the left and Lola can you please cancel out the notice-me not charm please since you're good at charms to wait until I got the carpet out.</p><p> </p><p>"Got it."</p><p> </p><p>Kathy pulled a carpet that had a design on of the New York City skyline in the U.S.A.</p><p> </p><p>"Alright let's hurry up and get on everybody needs to focus on getting to Hermione."</p><p> </p><p>As everyone was seated and strapped down right as they were about to enter the vortex, Lola canceled the notice me not charm and the carpet was sucked into the vortex. As they flew in the vortex someone was bounced back from trying to follow them into the vortex.</p>
