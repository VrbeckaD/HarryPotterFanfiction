    <p>Linnea Burnett was afraid. This was not an unusual occurrence; she was afraid of everything. She was afraid of the dark, of hospitals, of dementers (but then, wasn’t everyone afraid of dementers?). She was terrified of being a squib, and was frightened of having flying lessons. Most of all, she was terrified of muggles. And  today she was more afraid than she had ever been. Today she was starting a new school, in a new town. A school full of muggles. The last one had been a disaster, and only a very persuasive visit from the Minister for Magic herself had been able to coax her to return to public schooling, instead of being homeschooled, like she had wanted. Wizards and muggles had been attending school together for nearly seven years, and while there had been widespread hostility and fear towards wizard pupils from their muggle teachers and classmates, never had it gone so badly wrong as it had with Linnea. She had been subjected to a two year campaign of misery and cruelty, resulting in her being left in St Mungo’s for nearly a month having the majority of her bones regrown after some of her muggle classmates had got hold of a local pensioner’s wand and wreaked havoc with it. And now she was going into year five, at a new school, and even the terror of having no bones could not compete with the terror that it might happen again. </p>
<p>“Lin, you nearly ready?” her mother called up the stairs, jolting her out of her reminiscences.</p>
<p>“Coming, Mum!” she yelled back. There was a note of hysteria in her voice. Lin turned briefly to her mirror, double checking that her new uniform was perfect, and ran down the stairs. Her parents beamed up at her as she hurtled towards them. They were so proud of her going back to school that they had even agreed to let her have an owl when she went to Hogwarts, which before they had refused on account of the mess. She wondered if they would still be proud of her when they found out what she was planning to do in order to survive her remaining two years at muggle school. </p>
<p>“Come on then, Muppet,” her father beamed at her, using a new nickname that he seemed to think was cute. Her parents took the whole muggle integration thing very seriously, and in addition to introducing potion-making classes to the local village hall, they had become quite passionate about a muggle invention called television. Lin didn’t really understand it, or all the measures that had to be taken for muggle electrical technology to work around magic. The Muppets was a new discovery of her father’s, and he had decided that ‘Muppet’ was the perfect nickname for her. She was too nervous to bat him off as she usually did, and he scooped her up into a bear hug before allowing her to jump into the car, in which her mother was now waiting. He waved them off as they left, still beaming. The car was another muggle invention that Lin was still not quite sure about. She thought that broomsticks, apparition, portkeys and the floo network seemed a much safer way to travel, but for this, her first day, she had insisted on being dropped off at school in the car. It was part of the plan. Most wizards didn’t bother with cars, simply showing up at school by Portkey, but Lin wasn’t going to tell anyone that she was a witch. That was her big secret, the thing that was going to make her parents so ashamed of her – she was going to pretend that she was not a witch. Muggle schools were not allowed to ask parents applying for a place for their children whether or not they were wizards; the Minister for Magic, and the muggle Prime Minister had decided that this would open the door for discrimination. The decision to tell her schoolmates that she was a witch rested entirely on the pupil. And this pupil’s decision was that no one was ever going to know she was a witch.</p>
<p>The first morning was reasonably uneventful, as first mornings went.  The ‘come up and tell us about yourself, Lin’ section of the day was mundane; she wasn’t talking about magic, so she wouldn’t have to field questions about which Hogwarts house she wanted to be in, or what her favourite spell was, or if she had had any ‘magical accidents’ – the muggle name for the small manifestations of magic that wizard children often experienced when they were young. Muggles were very frightened of magical accidents. So her brief speech was quick - her name was Lin, she was nearly 10, she had a pet rat and her favourite colour was yellow. This was because she wanted to be sorted into Hufflepuff when she started Hogwarts, but they didn’t need to know that. She stayed fairly quiet for the rest of the day, not raising her hand in numeracy class, even though she knew most of the answers, and was just starting to relax when a slightly sticky finger tapped the back of her hand when she was sitting down to eat her lunch. </p>
<p>“Is thomeone thitting here?” The voice had a slight lisp, and belonged to a thin, pale boy with watery blue eyes and fluffy black hair who was hovering hopefully behind the chair next to her.</p>
<p>“Um” said Lin; no one apart from the teacher had really spoken to her all day. She wasn’t sure whether she wanted this sticky-fingered boy sitting next to her anyway. The boy gave her a pitying look and repeated his question slowly, with a slightly raised voice:</p>
<p>“Is. Thomeone. Thitting. Here?”</p>
<p>“I’m not deaf!” the retort came out more harshly than expected.</p>
<p>“Oh, thorry”</p>
<p> “You just surprised me,” Lin continued more gently. “Wasn’t really sure what I was going to say. No one is sitting there, you can if you want.” The boy looked surprised, hesitated for a minute and then seemed to decide that she meant it, slipping quickly into the chair. He started to shovel what smelled like tuna sandwiches out of a plastic box into his mouth. Lin suddenly felt nervous. This was the moment, she knew, when she should probably ask him his name, start a conversation. The last two years of muggle school were going to be lonely with no one to talk to. On the other hand, friends were dangerous. Friends wanted to come over after school. Friends asked questions about the broomsticks in the cupboard. Friends turned on you and accidentally removed all your bones as punishment for being a witch. No, better to let him finish shovelling his sandwiches and leave her alone.</p>
<p>It wasn’t to be. When the sandwiches were done, a grubby hand delved into a red backpack and produced another plastic box, this one containing two large slices of chocolate cake. And then another one with sticks of carrot in it. And then another one with boiled eggs in it. Lin’s palms started to sweat. How long could she sit next to this boy, in a lunch hall where everyone was talking to the people they were sat next to, without starting a conversation? At least he wasn’t trying to talk to her. She was just considering going to finish her lunch in the girls’ toilets when the lisping voice piped up again.</p>
<p>“You’re new.” It wasn’t a question. Lin wasn’t really sure what to say so she just said,</p>
<p>“Yeah.” She had hoped that this would deter further conversation, but the boy wasn’t put off.</p>
<p>“I’m Kevin. I have a pet dog. My favourite colour ith altho yellow. Like Hufflepuff”</p>
<p>“You’re a wizard?!” Lin had meant to ignore him but she couldn’t ignore that! The boy called Kevin gave a long-suffering sigh.</p>
<p>“No. I wish I wath though. I want to go to Hogwartth! I hope that I’m thecretly adopted and my real parentth were actually wizardth.” Lin didn’t really know what to say to this. This seemed a very personal thing to tell someone that he had only been speaking to for about two minutes, and Lin wasn’t about to tell him that she was a witch just because he had told her that he wanted to go to Hogwarts! Liking wizards in theory didn’t mean he liked them in practice! Part of her was disappointed. Another wizard pupil would have made making friends much easier and much less dangerous. She didn’t realise that she hadn’t responded to the outburst until Kevin said,</p>
<p>“You don’t talk much, do you? My mum sayth I talk too much but I think talking ith great! Do you like dogth? You have a pet rat but dogth are way better than ratthh!” Lin made to reply but Kevin was off again.<br/>
“I had to go to the dentitht thith morning, thatth why I have thith lithp” That explained why he looked familiar; he had left shortly after her ‘tell us about yourself Lin’ thing. </p>
<p>“I like dogs,” Lin said slowly. “And why do you want to be a wizard?” She thought this was a harmless question to start with. It wasn’t.</p>
<p>“Because withardth are cool. They have wandth and potionth and they can fly and do that thing were they thpin around and magically turn up thomewhere elthe. And they get to go to Hogwartth.”</p>
<p>“What’s so great about Hogwarts?” As if she didn’t know!</p>
<p>“You can go and live there. In Thcotland or wherever and you don’t have to thtay with your parentth exthept in the thummer. You don’t even have to write to them or email them or anything.” The Ministry of Magic had been working for a number of years on some kind of spell that would allow muggle technology to work in magical environments. This was mainly for the benefit of muggle-born students and students who had muggle friends; they tended not to get on very well with owls. Besides, Minister of Magic Hermione Granger thought the wizarding world was backward to refuse to use muggle technology simply because it was muggle technology. Kevin looked embarrassed, as though he hadn’t meant to say anything about his home life to a complete stranger. Lin was stunned. She had grown up in a happy home and couldn’t imagine not wanting to see or stay in touch with her parents. And what a thing to tell someone you had only just met! She wasn’t sure what to say, so she patted Kevin awkwardly on the shoulder. She noticed, uncomfortably, that his eyes were full of tears and she started to panic. What were you supposed to do with people who were crying? She was thankfully spared embarrassment because Kevin quickly wiped his eyes and changed the subject. </p>
<p>The rest of the lunch break was spent discussing the safe subjects of literacy, numeracy and the Lord of the Rings. Or at least, Kevin chattered about these things and Lin nodded and said ‘uh huh’ in all the right places. When the bell went for lessons to start again, all traces of unhappiness were gone from Kevin’s face. He got up quickly and muttered </p>
<p>“thankth for letting me thit nextht to you” at the speed of light and hurried away. Lin blinked after him. She’d never met anyone who was so much like a human hurricane. As she slowly got up to return to the year five classroom, she thought about Kevin. She thought about his sadness and his pain and his surprise that anyone would want to sit next to him at lunch time. She thought about how unhappy she had been last time she was at school, and how much she had wanted someone to be kind to her. She thought about having a friend who didn’t know she was a wizard. She thought about asking Kevin to sit with her at lunch again tomorrow. And when she went back into the classroom, she smiled at Kevin from across the room, and Kevin smiled back.</p>
