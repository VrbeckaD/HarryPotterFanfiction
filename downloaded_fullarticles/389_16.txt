    <p dir="ltr">“Vanessa, dear. We have <em>one</em> more thing for you today before you clean up, if you don’t mind?”</p>
<p dir="ltr">            Vanessa backed halfway out of a large kennel she had been cleaning, and looked over her shoulder at the person speaking. The manager of Bubble Hounds Pet Shop and Salon, Beth, was standing in the doorway leading from the pet shop storefront into the grooming salon. She held a leash in her hand. Whatever was on the other end of the leash was standing out of sight, beyond the doorway to the salon and in the shop front.</p>
<p dir="ltr">            “Of course,” Vanessa replied measuredly. She pivoted out of the kennel, and rose up with cracking knees. “Is it a nail trim?”</p>
<p dir="ltr">            Beth chuckled mischievously. She jiggled the leash in her hand. “Not quite! Poor baby came in itching something awful, covered in dust and dirt and who knows what. They found him half dead in a skip!”</p>
<p dir="ltr">            “A skip??”</p>
<p dir="ltr">            “Oh, the big bins,” Beth specified. I think you’ll have a different word for them. Dumper? Dump...”</p>
<p dir="ltr">            “Oh,” Vanesssa said. “A dumpster?”</p>
<p dir="ltr">            “Yes, that’s it! Dumpster, hah! How American. Anyway, he was in a <em>dumpster</em>, poor lad. They said he must have used the last of his strength climbing in, too weak to climb back out.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">            The dog at the end of the leash did not make any noise or movements.</p>
<p dir="ltr">            “Oh,” Vanessa said. “A neglect case.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">            Bessie put on a forced sheepish look.</p>
<p dir="ltr">            “I know, another off-schedule appointment. Sorry, dear. But he really needs help. You want to help him, don’t you?”<br/>
            “Of course,” Vanessa said tersely. She was livid. Beth was acting as though the issue was her not wanting to ‘help’ a dog. Sometimes, these dogs pulled in for a ‘rescue groom’ couldn’t even stand from exhaustion. Vanessa thought that whoever carted around these neglected dogs should get them veterinary attention and a chance for rest before taking them for a bath. However, it was not her decision to make. She was paid to show up and tend to whatever dog was put in front of her. “Of course I want to help a dog.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">            “Good! Then I’ll just put him in that one,” Beth said with a nod toward the kennel Vanessa had just cleaned. “Come, come, handsome man!”</p>
<p dir="ltr">            Vanessa turned away and closed her eyes for a moment in hopes that she would not roll them right in Beth’s face. Beth stepped over the salon threshold. The leash tautened behind her as she charged on, unworried about dragging the dog around by its neck on a slip lead.</p>
<p dir="ltr">            When the dog finally came into Vanessa’s sight, it really was a sad sight to see. He was a massive animal, but looked feeble being pulled around by his head. He was also clearly emaciated, which could be seen through his greasy black fur. Vanessa felt awful for him. She hated to see dogs like this, but they appeared at even the nicest grooming salons with surprising frequency. Some of the posh families who patronized the high-end salon Vanessa had worked for in Los Angeles had brought in dogs just as badly neglected as this one. She was starting to get burned out, seeing dog after dog come in infested with fleas or tortured with tight mats.</p>
<p dir="ltr">            The dog that walked in was balding in patches around the hips, and dragged his overgrown nails on the floor as he strode. His head would probably have been hanging to the ground, too, had Beth not been pulling him around by it. Leaves and mysterious crust could be seen lurking in his hair, and a smell like spoiled meat and old banana peel wafted off of him.</p>
<p dir="ltr">            “You know,” Vanessa said quickly, “You can actually just help me put him right in the tub, please.” She swung the kennel door closed with a clatter. “I don’t think I can get him up in there by myself.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">            Beth looked at Vanessa as if she was playing some kind of trick.</p>
<p dir="ltr">            “You want to pick him up and put him in? Not the ramp?”</p>
<p dir="ltr">            “I don’t think he has the strength to use the ramp,” Vanessa said. “Poor thing. Doesn’t look like he can even walk ten more steps.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">            “That’s true,” Beth admitted. She gave the dog a pitying pat on his head. Her whole palm could rest in the middle of his forehead and avoid touching either eye. “Here goes it. Up and over.”<br/>
            Vanessa and Beth circled around the dog awkwardly, trying to figure out how to team lift. Vanessa had a good routine for this with the usual groomer, Rebecca. Beth on the other hand wasn’t typically around to put dogs in the raised bathtub. She was only helping now because, since there weren’t supposed to be any more dogs on schedule for the day, Rebecca had already gone home.</p>
<p dir="ltr">            Eventually, they managed to lift the dog with some semblance of unity, and he made it most of the way into the tub.</p>
<p dir="ltr">            “Thought for sure he was gonna kick and cry,” Beth panted. “He don’t look like anyone’s owned him, cared for him, his whole life.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">            “He doesn’t have the energy, I guess.” Vanessa hurried to help a front leg over the side of the tub that hadn’t quite made it in. “Did you feel his ribs? He’s a skeleton, poor thing!”</p>
<p dir="ltr">            “Heavy bones, then! Yeah. Poor wee thing. Well, not so wee. But poor baby, skin and bones as he is.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">            They both looked at the dog for a moment, just taking in his poor condition. They had both seen the leaves and twigs stuck in his wiry coat, but from touching him they were confronted with a few spots of unidentifiable stickiness. The smell was not any better up close. More than just physically neglected, though, he looked mentally defeated as well. He was hunched, head hanging over the front of the tub and flank pressed to the back. He did not make eye contact with either Beth or Vanessa, but rather stared blankly into some faraway space.</p>
<p dir="ltr">            “He is just tremendous,” Beth commented. “And dirty. God, so dirty. Expect the works. He was a bit sticky on my side, don’t know if you got any on you.” She shook her head. “Well. I’m going to wash my arms up to the elbows. I really must get back to tending the front. Ta.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">            Vanessa looked at the dog again, trying to make eye contact. She offered him her hand to sniff, not expecting much reaction. She was right.</p>
<p dir="ltr">            “Poor bastard,” she said candidly as soon as Beth was out of earshot. She slipped a grooming loop over his head. It was secured with a metal clip to the back of the bathtub. She tightened a sliding adjuster to secure him, with care not to pull his hair into the slider.</p>
<p dir="ltr">            “I would do the usual thing and start calling your owners dickheads for letting you get like this, but I’m guessing you haven’t had any owners for a while.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">            She sighed and then pulled out three mixing bottles for shampoo and conditioner from a metal basket on the wall-side of the tub.</p>
<p dir="ltr">            “If you’ll excuse me, I have to mix up some more shampoo. Rocket was supposed to be the last dog of the day. Not that Beth or anyone else cares.” Vanessa selected a gallon of degreasing shampoo rather than the gentler daily shampoo she usually used. “You need the strong stuff, dude. If Rebecca was here, you would be getting dish soap all over. In the ears and everything.” She poured some thick, goopy citrus-scented shampoo concentrate into two of the mixing bottles. “But luckily for you, I am not Rebecca.” Mostly, Vanessa spoke to keep herself sane, but she thought the dogs might benefit from having someone speak soothingly to them during the scary ordeal of bath time. The dog in the tub now did not have any visible reaction to her words, but that was usual. Dogs unused to being bathed typically froze in place, not knowing what to expect or how to react.</p>
<p dir="ltr">           “Boy, I hope you don’t go crazy when the water turns on,” Vanessa thought aloud. “I think you could break that loop if you sneezed too hard.” Gingerly, she patted the dog on his head, and then reached over to grab the sprayer. “Good boy, it’s okay.” She held the sprayer beside his body, so that the water wouldn’t touch him when it turned on, and mumbled reassurances. “This is just going to be water. I don’t know if you’ve ever had a bath before, but I promise it’s not going to hurt.” She turned on the water, and set it to warm. “Well, unless you’re already hurting from something else and then I put water on that. Sorry in advance, big boy-o.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">            Vanessa zoned out a bit during the eternity that it took to funnel water into the shampoo mixing bottles. Why did they have a funnel with such a tiny spout?</p>
<p dir="ltr">            She glanced over at the dog’s head as she held the hose in place. He was still staring blankly at nothing.</p>
<p dir="ltr">            “You know, it’s creepy when you guys go all space cadet like that,” she said in a sweet voice. Sometimes baby talk worked. “Please don’t turn around and snap at me without warning. A little growl will do nicely if you feel so inclined.” The dog made no change in his behavior. Vanessa shrugged internally and started to pick leaves and other debris out of the dog’s fur with her free hand.</p>
<p dir="ltr"> </p>
<p dir="ltr">            Eventually, Vanessa had mixed up two bottles of shampoo and one of conditioner. She let the dog smell the bottles before she used them, and was pleased when he halfheartedly sniffed the conditioner.</p>
<p dir="ltr">            “The lemony one is a bit much, isn’t it, boy? Or should I call you... Ah. Right. You don’t have a name. That we know of.” The dog did nothing as Vanessa began to work shampoo into the hair around his ears and jaw. “I gotta call you something other than ‘boy.’”</p>
<p dir="ltr">            She scrubbed his ears and thought. “Okay, not too much flea crud so far. Awesome. I’m not a fan of the delicate mingled aromas of dog blood and lemon soap. Uhh, so a name. Well. You’re a big, black dog.” She squirted shampoo all up and down his back, like squeezing mustard onto a giant hot dog. “A big, black dog… B. B. D? What do you think?”</p>
<p dir="ltr">            The dog did nothing.</p>
<p dir="ltr">            “Okay, BBD it is. I’m too tired to think of anything else today.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">            The bath went on, Vanessa scrubbing dutifully and then rinsing a little bit off at a time. Her back hurt from the long day she had already had, and water dripped into her armpits when she had to reach her arms up to rinse his back. She took a moment to wipe her arms with a towel and blew a puff of air sideways from her mouth.</p>
<p dir="ltr">            “You were not supposed to be here, BBD.” She got promptly back to work, applying shampoo to the top of his head. “15 dogs on the schedule for me today, and then in walks this big fucking horse. No offense. How is that even fair?” BBD pulled up his head and tried to turn away as she began to massage shampoo onto his whiskers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">            “Hey, settle down. You do not want this in your eyes. I know, you don’t even know me and I’m touching your mouth. Very scary. But you really need to get clean.” She picked out a leafy twig from his beard and let it drop to the bottom of the tub. “The shampoo’s lathering gray. You will definitely be a double wash, which I hate by the way. It’s not your fault, but I’m very displeased--“ She looked over her shoulder, checking the gap at the bottom of the salon door for Beth’s shadow. It was not there. “I’m <em>very</em> displeased with Beth’s scheduling. Today was grueling, BBD. Two Labradors, a German shepherd, I don’t even care to list what else. I’m <em>tired</em>, and they bring in the gigantic-est wolfhound thing I’ve ever seen in my life. Are you a wolfhound?”</p>
<p dir="ltr">            She kept the babbling to a minimum for the rest of BBD’s first shampooing, only saying the occasional “good boy” or “turn around.” All was going well, until she attempted to wash his tail. He sat down suddenly when she put her hand on it, banging his haunches on the plastic grate at the bottom of the tub.</p>
<p dir="ltr">            “Don’t be sensitive.” Vanessa put her hand near BBD’s belly to attempt to lift him back into a standing position, but he hopped up suddenly, stiff-legged, before she could even touch him. “Okay, you’re going to have to stop hopping around like that. You’re too huge for me to fight you. She tried to catch BBD’s eyes, but he was looking around the room to avoid eye contact. Vanessa attempted a second time to wash his tail, but then he tensed in a way that gave her pause. She was no stranger to dogs lashing out aggressively, and her instincts were very keen. She had not been bitten yet in eight months of working as a dog bather, and she didn’t plan on breaking that record yet. Not on an off-schedule dog, especially. She put her hands up in an ‘I give up’ gesture and moved on. It was her opinion that she did not make enough money to risk having her arm ripped out of socket by a 100-lb. dog. She would hose down whatever she couldn’t touch from a couple of feet away with her thumb on the nozzle and hope for the best.</p>
<p dir="ltr">            Proceeding from there, BBD settled back into a more docile state of discomfort and let himself be bathed. He cringed when knotted-in debris was pulled out, and reacted ticklishly to his toes being cleaned, but otherwise behaved excellently.</p>
<p dir="ltr">            The conditioner went in easily, but rinsing out took quite a while.</p>
<p dir="ltr">            “Sorry. We don’t have the best water heater. Bear with the chill and you’ll be done. I don’t think you really need a third shampoo, but I am just going to come back to your feet and give them another scrub.“ Vanessa tilted her head curiously when BBD sighed and danced around in place, lifting and then pressing his paws down onto the tub grate.</p>
<p dir="ltr">            “Do you know the word ‘feet’?” Vanessa wondered, puzzled. “I swear you understood that.”</p>
<p dir="ltr"> </p>
<p dir="ltr">            The rest of the bath was mostly uneventful. He groaned a little about his feet being washed again, but Vanessa was actually happy about his complaints.</p>
<p dir="ltr">            “You finally perked up a little, huh? Just to be delicate about the feet, but you did. I like that better than the thousand-yard stare.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">            She looked at his eyes for a while. “How do you have those silver eyes like that? I’ve never seen any dog with eyes like that. Not in all the time I’ve been working here, or anywhere else.”</p>
<p dir="ltr"> </p>
<p dir="ltr">            Vanessa picked up a towel from the bottom drawer of a side cart by the tub, and wrapped BBD’s face in it. She rubbed vigorously but gently, getting his wiry moustache and eyebrows as dry as she could. “This is my favorite part,” she said as she moved the towel up to use a drier spot, and continued rubbing. “I take this towel off, and your face is going to be so fluffy. Just a little bit more. Got to get the ears, hold your horses. Okay, voila!” Vanessa finally let his face be free from the towel, and immediately backed up a few feet and lifted the towel up in front of her like a long shield. When she peeked over the top for a moment, BBD looked her in the eye and then looked away.</p>
<p dir="ltr">            “Hey! Nice to finally meet you, clean BBD!”</p>
<p dir="ltr">            BBD shook his head, and the shake traveled along his whole body until his long tail was banging loudly against the tub walls. Vanessa was still standing with the towel raised up, and it kept some of the shaken water off of her. Some.</p>
<p dir="ltr">            “Good shake! Ready to towel off some more?”</p>
<p dir="ltr"> </p>
<p dir="ltr">            After a couple of minutes of very thorough towel drying, BBD was looking a hundred times better already. His towel-dried fur kind of made him look like a clean, fuzzy duckling. He was looking tired, though. Standing for as long as he had stood for the bath was probably only possible due to the stress of being in a strange place. Vanessa picked up a clean slip lead from the side cart and put it over his head. Only after he was leashed did she loosen and remove the loop that had kept him secure in the bathtub. Forgetting to put the slip lead on before loosening the loop was a somewhat common mistake, but it meant that the dog might notice its new freedom and make a run for the door. The tired specimen in the tub right now was probably not much of a flight risk, but it was always better to be cautious.</p>
<p dir="ltr">            “Okay, I have a big mission for you, BBD. I know it’s going to be hard, but do you think you can come down the ramp? Oh, wait.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">            She grabbed two of the towels she had used to dry him and spread them out on the floor.</p>
<p dir="ltr">            “Okay. Now we can try it. You just have to get out of the tub and then you can lie down right there. You ran me out of towels, or I would have put a dry one down. Sorry.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">            Vanessa lifted a metal sheet from its place at the front of the tub, and revealed an opening in the tub wall that was meant for dogs to go in and out. She pulled BBD’s slip lead gently in the direction of the opening. In front of the opening was a little pull-out ramp. She wondered for a moment if this was going to be a struggle, as some dogs found the ramp to be scary. However, BBD turned around in the tub and went down the ramp without a problem. As soon as he had all four feet on flat ground, he found the least damp spot on the towels and dropped down.</p>
<p dir="ltr">            “I think we both need a moment,” Vanessa sighed as she dried her face and arms with a towel. Her clothes were wet from BBD shaking water out of his coat, although he had politely stopped shaking when Vanessa growled in frustration. She was not above hissing like a furious cat, if a dog was being really insubordinate, but it didn’t get nearly to that point with BBD. He was very good for his bath, Vanessa assumed because he was too tired to struggle much. As if on cue, BBD sighed a big sigh through his nose.</p>
<p dir="ltr">            Vanessa went over to the drying table and leaned against the edge. She had two options. One was to put BBD in a kennel and turn a kennel dryer on him. The other was to force dry him right away. Each option had its drawbacks and benefits, and Vanessa took the opportunity of thinking them over to get a little less uncomfortable. She hopped up to sit with fully on the table and sighed, her feet and back aching strongly. She could lie down on the table, she thought. She could put BBD under the kennel dryer and let his fur dry up a little bit while she rested. But then again, she would still have to force dry him afterwards anyway. The kennel dryers couldn’t reach whatever side the dog faced away from, or their belly and rear. Vanessa sighed again. Force drying straight away would save her about an hour’s time, she estimated. An hour earlier to go home, and it was already early evening. But couldn’t she just lie down for a moment?</p>
<p dir="ltr">            She considered it, but thought it wouldn’t be worth the struggle to get back up again. She groaned dramatically, and BBD’s ears twitched.</p>
<p dir="ltr">            “Okay, it’s time.” Vanessa said as she hopped off of the table. BBD raised his head. “Up. Come on,” she implored. BBD put his head back down. “Stand!”</p>
<p dir="ltr">            She pointed at the drying table in front of BBD imperiously.</p>
<p dir="ltr">            “Get. Up. Go! Jump up! Giddyup! I’m not saying that last one because I’m from Texas. I’m making fun of movie-Texas talk. We don’t really say ‘giddyup,’ okay? Just get up! Come on!”</p>
<p dir="ltr">            BBD rolled his eyes in the way that dogs do, and then started to stir.</p>
<p dir="ltr">            “Oh, wait! I have an idea! Stay right there.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">            BBD obediently collapsed back into a relaxed sprawl, and Vanessa hurried over to a little cabinet in a far corner of the salon. The cabinet held her personal belongings, including a small purse. She retrieve a somewhat crumpled banknote from the smallest pocket, all while keeping an eye on BBD.</p>
<p dir="ltr">            “Stay,” she commanded as she went back to him and took hold of his slip lead. She looped it over the knob of the drying table arm. Vanessa knew that this dog could easily drag the entire table down the street and back if he was at full strength, but at the moment he seemed really quite content to just lie on the floor. It was probably fine to leave him for just a minute. She went with her money and exited to the shop front, closing the salon door behind her.</p>
<p dir="ltr">            Beth was among the shop merchandise, standing over a box and writing things about its contents onto a clipboard. Vanessa had no idea what Beth’s duties were exactly, but she was assuming it was some kind of inventory check. The teenage girl at the register, Nour, was sitting on the stool behind the counter and reading a comic book. Vanessa made a beeline for the dog treats and picked out a squeezable pouch of meat pate in gravy. She looked at it for a little bit, wondering if BBD would like it, and then made her way to the counter.</p>
<p dir="ltr">            “Can I get this, Nour?”</p>
<p dir="ltr">            “Buying dog food?” she asked excitedly. “Did you get a dog? Aww!”</p>
<p dir="ltr">            “No, no, I don’t think there’s room for another dog in the cottage. This is for the dog in the back. Did you see him come through?”</p>
<p dir="ltr">            Nour’s eyes got huge.</p>
<p dir="ltr">            “See him? You couldn’t hardly miss him! He’s about the size of a bus.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">            “Yeah. He’s all ribs sticking out and bony hips. I think they said they found him eating trash? I know most dogs don’t usually feel up to eating when they’re in for a bath, but I feel so bad. He has no energy, his gums are white. I want to see if he’ll at least maybe lick up some of the gravy.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">            Nour had rung up the pate and was giving back change as she nodded eagerly.</p>
<p dir="ltr">            “I saw, he’s definitely starving. I hope he does eat it. How was he for the bath? Here you go.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">            “Thanks. He was really good! Better behaved than I expected for sure. I hope it’s not just because he has no fight left in him anymore. I want to see him perk up a bit.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">            “Well, good luck!” Nour beemed a genuine smile. “I want to come see him when he’s done!”</p>
<p dir="ltr">           </p>
<p dir="ltr">-</p>
<p dir="ltr"> </p>
<p dir="ltr">            When Vanessa returned to BBD, he was in the exact same spot she had left him. She was glad that he hadn’t tried to escape or make a mess of the salon, but also discouraged that he hadn’t even moved at all. She really hoped the food would get his energy up at least a little. She gave him a smile and lifted the pouch to tear open a corner. BBD’s eyebrows raised hopefully and his nose wiggled as he sniffed the air.</p>
<p dir="ltr">            “Yeah, it’s food! You want foodsies?” Vanessa baby talked to him and his tail thumped twice on the floor as he lifted his head in anticipation. She crouched down to give him the pate, and he eagerly licked it as it squeezed out of the pouch. “Here, I’m just going to put it on the towel and you can lick it off. There. There you go! Good boy.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">            BBD immediately devoured all of the contents of the pouch and was licking the towel. Cautiously, Vanessa reached a hand out. She held it far enough away that he could not bite it if he lunged for it, and waited for a reaction. He looked at her hand and accepted its presence, continuing to lick the towel. She gently petted his forehead and said some sweet nonsense to him. He licked his lips several times, and looked at Vanessa for a moment. With those strange gray eyes, it seemed like there was something supernatural about him, more than just a common animal. The look he gave her had been an assessment, but also perhaps a kind of communication. Vanessa would like to have believed that it was a ‘thank you’ for taking care of him. But when he looked away, the mystical appearance was gone. He was just a big, black dog.</p>
<p dir="ltr">           </p>
<p dir="ltr">-</p>
<p dir="ltr"> </p>
<p dir="ltr">            Drying time followed a short break for both Vanessa and the dog after the long bath and towel-drying experience. It went as well as it possibly could. Vanessa did have to enlist Beth’s help to lift BBD onto the drying table, and she had to put the table’s arm to its highest possible height. She wetted two cotton balls with liquid ear cleaning solution, and then stuffed them in his ears. He did not like it, but they would serve a double purpose of cleaning out his ears of grime and muffling the loud sound of the force dryer. After some reassurances and praise for being such a good boy thus far, Vanessa turned the dryer on. He did not react much, so she turned the nozzle onto his flank. He stood stoic as a statue as the air blasted his fur. Many pats were given, and slowly but surely BBD got on his way to getting dry.</p>
<p dir="ltr">            It took about forty-five minutes, with two breaks in between, for Vanessa to give up. Her arms got tired from reaching over her head to dry his back, and the dryer got overly hot a few times. Along his spine was still slightly damp in some spots, as well as some very sunken and bony parts that Vanessa just felt too bad to linger over with the forceful air current. Rebecca would have come in and finished drying for Vanessa if she were here. She also might have insisted on Vanessa drying his tail, which Vanessa hated doing. But Rebecca was not here, and Vanessa was at work two hours past shift on a very long day. She really, really wanted to go home and get some food and rest.</p>
<p dir="ltr">            “BBD, what do you say we throw you in the kennel and let the kennel drier take care of the rest?”</p>
<p dir="ltr">            BBD did not respond, other than to pant where he sat. Vanessa felt badly for him. Even just standing for a few minutes on and off during the drying process must be taxing for him, in his emaciated condition. She petted him down his back a few times and leaned over the table to touch her head to his. She had gotten a good sense by now that he was okay with being reached over and maneuvered, so she gave him a chance to lean his right shoulder against her head. It took a moment, but he eventually did relax somewhat into a lean. She continued to pet him, and scratched his chest. He wagged his tail a few times, enjoying the attention.</p>
<p dir="ltr">            In a short time, maybe half a minute, Vanessa gave him a couple of firm pats and let him take his weight back.</p>
<p dir="ltr">            “You can stay sitting,” she said in a soothing tone. “I’m just going to do a little brushing. You don’t need much. Then we can do your nails and teeth, then we’re done. Good boy.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">            BBD blinked a few times. He seemed to be getting sleepy.</p>
<p dir="ltr">            “I have an idea. Hang on.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">            Vanessa turned a crank on the drying table arm, and let the bar start to drop slowly. BBD, feeling more slack on the loop, let his shoulders sink down. As the bar lowered more, he continued to slide until he was lying down like a sphinx. His long tail dangled off the edge of the table.</p>
<p dir="ltr">            “There you go,” Vanessa said. “You can relax. Sleepy boy. I’ll do your teeth first, hang on right there.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">            She cleaned his teeth with a cotton ball soaked in canine teeth cleaning solution, which he hated as much as every other dog that had it done. Then she brushed his fur with a slicker brush, taking care not to scrape his bony spots with the metal bristles. His fur was not long enough to tangle very badly, and she was able to brush him quickly and without pulling on too many tangles. She walked around the table to come gently brush his face, after she was done with his back and sides. Not much to her surprise, he was asleep. She brushed ever so gently over the top of his head, and his ears. She woke him up to brush his muzzle, and held his head up so that she could give a good brushing to his chin. He was the picture of restfulness with his chin resting on her hand. Vanessa’s arm, however, was trembling slightly from the exertion. BBD blinked sleepily.</p>
<p dir="ltr">            “There,” Vanessa said soothingly, gently lowering his head. “I think we’re as good as done. No need to brush your legs. I didn’t see any tangles.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">            She put away her brush and exchanged it for a pair of pet nail trimmers. With her right hand, she petted the back of BBD’s right front leg. Then she grabbed his paw and lifted it, trying not to handle it in a way that would make him feel too ticklish. She assumed a safe stance, face held away from the bite zone. One could never be too cautious when handling a strange dog.</p>
<p dir="ltr">            “Ready, BBD?” She positioned the nail clippers around a huge pinkie toe claw. All of his claws were scuffed on the tops from him dragging his feet when he walked. “This is going to be okay, baby.” She squeezed the clippers while she spoke, trying to cover up as much of the cracking sound as possible. BBD did great, considering the probability that he had never had his nails taken care of in his entire life. She kept on, and eventually she had clipped all of his claws in front. She had gone behind him to clip his back claws when she heard the salon door swing open. She took the distraction as a chance to clip a dewclaw without him noticing, and then ducked her head to get a line of sight under his body at who had just come in.</p>
<p dir="ltr">            “Oh, look at him!” A woman with short yellow hair and coral-colored lipstick cried out with delight. “He looks a hundred times better!”</p>
<p dir="ltr">            “A hundred times better,” Beth echoed. “Couldn’t have said it better myself.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">            Vanessa saw the woman, whose voice she recognized from other rescued dogs being dropped off at the salon previously. Beth and Nour were also in the room. They all looked excited. Vanessa had to agree, BBD did look great. Not only was he already just much cleaner-looking, but fluffing up his fur with the force dryer hid some of his boniness and made him look a bit healthier.</p>
<p dir="ltr">            “Well, I’ll take him,” the woman said as she began picking her way through the tumbleweeds of dog hair that littered the salon floor.</p>
<p dir="ltr">            “Oh, Tara, I don’t think--“ Beth interjected, but she determinedly reached BBD and held out her hand in request.</p>
<p dir="ltr">            “Er, I don’t think Vanessa’s done with him yet, Tara. Looks like she still has nails to do?”</p>
<p dir="ltr">            “Oh, that’s alright,” Tara said. Her eyes locked onto the grooming loop and she grabbed for it. Vanessa watched in seeming slow motion as Tara began to slide the loop loose and BBD figured out that he was about to be freed from the table.</p>
<p dir="ltr">            “Wait,” Vanessa said, but Tara had already begun to speak over her in Beth’s direction. Angrily.</p>
<p dir="ltr">            “You have your bather trimming his DEWCLAWS?” she accused. “He needs them, dogs NEED their dewclaws for traction--“</p>
<p dir="ltr">            Traction, he had. As Tara removed the loop from around BBD’s neck while berating Beth, BBD ducked his head and launched powerfully past Tara. It was a display of athleticism that only a desperate animal could manage. He whizzed past Beth and Nour, and there was a great commotion as everyone reacted a beat too late. Despite the panic of the moment, Vanessa found it kind of funny that the humans had such slower reflexes than dogs. BBD was already out the salon door when Beth and Nour reached out their arms to catch him. Tara squawked. Vanessa stood frozen, slightly experiencing an out of body situation, nail clippers still in hand. Beth said “Get him!” and pushed past Nour after him. Nour quickly followed, and they were both out of Vanessa’s sight.</p>
<p dir="ltr">            Vanessa realized that she should probably do something.</p>
<p dir="ltr">            Snapping back into current reality, she dropped the nail clippers on the table and dashed out after them all. She could hear Tara behind her saying something about not knowing to expect this. Beth and Nour had split up around an aisle divider, but Vanessa couldn’t see where BBD had gone. She thought he must be at the front of the store.</p>
<p dir="ltr">            They all heard a pleasant chime as the front door opened.</p>
<p dir="ltr">            “No!” both Beth and Nour shouted.</p>
<p dir="ltr">            BBD must run best on adrenaline, Vanessa thought as she watched his dark silhouette disappear down the street through the shop windows. She could see him like a flitting shadow through the frosted glass, but oddly high up. Had she not known better, she would have said that it was a hunched human figure running past the windows, not a dog. It had to have been him, however, because as everyone discovered colliding around the aisle divider, there was no black dog in the building. Only the front door swinging back into a closed position.</p>
<p dir="ltr">            “What happened?!” Tara shrieked.</p>
<p dir="ltr">            Nour reached the door before it finished closing, and ran out. Beth almost ran out too, but then stopped herself in the doorway. Vanessa was quickly over her shoulder, looking out. Nour had run in the direction that they had all seen BBD run, but she was spinning on the spot looking for him. She had clearly lost sight of him.</p>
<p dir="ltr">            Beth put her hands on either side of her head like the Scream painting. Nour looked towards the shop with a tragic expression. Nobody seemed sure of what to say or do in that moment. Vanessa knew that this shop had never had a groom dog escape before. She just couldn’t believe that BBD had been so fast. And, she asked herself, how did he open the door?</p>
