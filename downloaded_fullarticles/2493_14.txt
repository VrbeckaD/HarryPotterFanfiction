    <p>The fog was bringing up goose flesh on Sirius’ arms and he stopped walking to rub at them.  He drew a deep breath and it tasted like frost, like winter settling into his bones, into his blood.  He blew the frost out and watched it condense in the air, freezing into the fog and turning his vision into nothing but mist for a moment.</p>
<p>A quick step forward, through his breath still lingering in the air, and Sirius could see the line of trees climbing up out of the earth like barren fingers, skeletal and raw.  The rows of them were pale and stark in the rising moonlight, lining the ambling pathway, meandering out of sight.</p>
<p>When Sirius blinked, the world hazed over briefly before refocusing.  He drew in another freezing breath and let it out slowly.  The wind carded through his hair, icy fingers scratching at his scalp, the back of his neck, down his shoulders.  </p>
<p>He couldn’t figure out why he wasn’t dressed for the cold.  In fact, he couldn’t figure out <i>if</i> he was dressed for the cold; every time he tried to focus on what he was wearing he got the vague impression that he was dressed, but nothing more concrete than that Any sense that his situation might be strange slipped away before he could try and grasp at it.</p>
<p>A couple of people walked past Sirius, hazy, washed in blues and greys; silhouettes slinking past without making a sound.  Ghosts of little substance whispering past in the peripheral, barely more than shadows flickering at Sirius’ consciousness.</p>
<p>Just at the edges of his awareness, there was a trickling sensation running down his spine that he had no idea where he was or how he got there, but he couldn’t quite grasp it.  Every time he tried to look it crackled away, as substantial as the fog.  Everything he tried to focus on immediately became vague impressions that somehow his brain was interpreting as full details, despite the fact that none of his senses could make concrete contact with anything verifiable.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until he tried to walk towards the rows of trees, thinking he would lean against one and catch the breath that the cold was stealing away, the trees not getting  any closer to him, that Sirius realized he was dreaming.  It fell on him all at once, and suddenly the haze flickered away, everything crystalline sharp, brittle.  The trees were still in pale shades of blue and grey, but now it was because it was near dark out, not because he couldn’t see them.  The silhouettes were still shapeless humanoid shadows, but now it was because they were all bundled up in heavy winter clothes.</p>
<p>Another gust of wind swirled the fog through the trees and left Sirius shivering and flashing an impatient glare at his own bare arms.</p>
<p>“I couldn’t have dreamt myself warm?” he grumbled to himself, the words sounding thin and tinny to his own ears.  He closed his eyes and tried to think warm thoughts, wondering when dreams gained the ability to be cold.</p>
<p>
  <i>In his bed Sirius rolled over, blinking blearily at the clock, which read 1:42AM.  He groaned and tugged the blankets up to his chin despite the unseasonably warm spring they were having, shivered, and fell back to sleep.</i>
</p>
<p>When he opened his eyes again the trees were much closer, twilight blue leaves dripping down over a black river of pavement, rustling with the breeze, no longer freezing, but only cool.</p>
<p>Whirling around, Sirius could see that the point he guessed he had been at before, seeming to be about the right distance away, was actually the middle of the road that ran alongside the pathway.  A car ambled by slowly, all strange angles and muted beiges, and Sirius shuddered, thinking that if a car had come by while he had been standing there before he would have been hurt or killed, dream or not.  He wasn’t sure where the thought came from, but it felt right, the same way his dream had felt cold earlier when dreams shouldn’t be cold, or hot, or tangible in any way.</p>
<p>He picked up a small rock near his feet, turning it over in his hands, letting the sharp edges abrade his fingertips and marveling at the fact that he could feel it at all.  Then, abruptly, he flung it towards one of the trees where it hit with a satisfying <i>thwack</i> before skittering down to the pavement, the skipping plunking sound fading as the rock bounced twice then stopped.</p>
<p>One of the silhouettes stopped and turned to look at the rock, then towards Sirius. They didn’t seem to see Sirius and took a step back away from where the rock had come flying from before turning and scurrying off at a much faster pace, faded briefcase hitting their leg with every step.  Sirius watched until the person – and he had to assume they were people or he wouldn’t be able to focus on anything else – disappeared out of sight.  They didn’t fade away as people often did in dreams, but just walked around the corner like any normal waking person.</p>
<p>“Okay,” Sirius muttered out loud, just to ground himself in something familiar, even if it was just his own voice.  “If I’m dreaming I should be able to get closer to those trees just by wanting to be closer to those trees.”</p>
<p>He glared at the trees in question, but they neither got any closer or any less hazy, despite the fact that most of the fog had dissipated with the warmer weather.  After a moment of wishing the trees closer and wondering why it didn’t work the same as it did in all of his other dreams, Sirius started walking, just to see if he could reach the trees through any means.  Slowly, the ground seemed to disappear between them.</p>
<p>As he reached the trees he could just make out that what he originally thought were leaves were barely buds, spring settling into the bones of the trees and blooming out the tips.</p>
<p>“Did it change seasons just because I complained about being cold?” Sirius frowned and stopped walking.  “That seems out of place with how this dream is working.”  Looking down at the dew that was collecting on his boots, clear beads refracting the sunrise just breaking across the sky in muted pastels, Sirius couldn’t help but scuff his toes together, watching the colors streak out in smears and fade as they evaporated.  “In fact, nothing about this dream is normal.”</p>
<p>He was just about to start walking again when a person came out of seemingly nowhere and ran right <i>through</i> him.  The harried person didn’t seem to notice anything strange, except to shiver slightly and tug their overcoat a little tighter, scurrying down the path and on to wherever their day was taking them.  Sirius, however, felt like his insides had gotten stuck, tugged forwards slightly and then sliding back to him, treacle slow.  Stumbling to the side he wretched a couple of times, leaning on the rough bark of one of the trees, but managed to only have to spit out a small amount of bile.</p>
<p>Wiping his mouth on the back of his hand he uncurled his spine, feeling oddly lightheaded and still using the tree to hold himself up.  A few gulps of cool air and his head stopped spinning enough that he could risk trying to hold himself up again.</p>
<p>“I’m going to have to pay more attention,” he grumbled to himself, glaring in the direction the person who had walked through him had disappeared into.</p>
<p>When he looked up, however, he found himself meeting the eyes of a young man who was staring straight at him.</p>
<p>Sirius blinked a couple of times, hard, but the young man continued to watch him, the dim light of pre-dawn making his eyes colorless, but no less intense for it.</p>
<p>The first thought Sirius had was that this man couldn’t have been more his type if he had designed him himself.  He wanted to run his fingers through the fine hair, feel the slight stubble on his cheek.</p>
<p>The second thought he had was that if this was the only person he had been granted the ability to see in detail there had to be a reason.</p>
<p>He was hoping that that reason was because he got to touch.  <i>What’s the point of having a beautiful man appear in a dream where all of my senses are working at full capacity if I don’t get to touch?</i> Was the last thing that Sirius thought, even going so far as to reach his hand out before everything flickered away, going black.</p>
<p>Squeezing his eyes shut hard for a moment, Sirius opened them again hoping to still be looking at the young man from his dream, but not at all surprised to find that was back in his bed, the blankets tangled around his ankles, his heart beating wildly and the clock reading 3:17AM.</p>
