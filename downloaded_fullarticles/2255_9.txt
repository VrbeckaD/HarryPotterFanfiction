<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>What was the big deal anyway? Why was everyone so interested in attending this Merlin-forsaken ball? He couldn’t make heads or tails of it … the way the girls were fawning over dresses and hair-dos and dates, and the boys nail-bitingly nervous over which witch they should ask to go. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The sign was magically suspended against the wall in the great hall days ago, and it seemed everyone was still as excited as when they first laid eyes on it. House unity, he'd heard one of his fellow prefects say, as he'd passed them in the halls that day. It was meant to bring a sense of unity and security to everyone in Hogwarts, what with the attack on the mudbloods and the opening of the Chamber of Secrets that had happened that year. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Myrtle's death was a final straw and a “culprit” needed to be caught. So, as any good Slytherin would do, he'd framed Hagrid. Had him expelled and his wand broken. It was shame they'd let, what did he call him … Aragog; escape. Into the forbidden forest, Tom figured, but no matter. The heat was off him, they had the suspected killer, and life was getting back to normal in the school. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Now it was time for </span>
  <em>
    <span>house unity</span>
  </em>
  <span>. What a load of bollocks. Like any self respecting Slytherin would be caught dead going to the ball with a Hufflepuff! With a huff of his breath and roll of his eyes, Tom left the great hall and made his way to the library. In the seclusion of the stacks, he found himself pondering once more about this ball. Surely, a boy as handsome and smart as he, would have the pick of the best witches attending Hogwarts. But he couldn’t bring himself to care. Was there something wrong with him? Yes, he enjoyed ogling the prettier of the Slytherin girls. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>One in particular, always caught his eye. Her long auburn hair that was perfectly straight, and her strikingly blue eyes that would crinkle when she smiled at something he’d say. His feelings though, were always fleeting, and nothing more than a quick rush of blood through his veins to his groin. Realizing he’d been standing in the stacks amongst the ancient tomes and not actually getting any work done, he set off to find her. If he was going to take anyone to this ball, it was going to be her. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<hr/>
<p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p>
<p>
  <span>A giggle slipped past her parted her lips as she listened to her two comrades go on about the boys of the Slytherin house. She shook her head gently, auburn locks swaying in the afternoon breeze as the three girls spent their free period lounging by the black lake. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Honestly, Liv, I don’t see how you could be attracted to such a menace!” Penny whispered, thinking about the boy her friend was swooning over “Thieme Nott is incorrigible!”. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Olivia turned to Penny and with a sarcastic tone she drawled “And you think Riddle is </span>
  <em>
    <span>any</span>
  </em>
  <span> better?!”. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Well … I … er ..” Penny began to sputter, her face turning crimson at Olivia’s implication. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Aha! I knew it! You’re over the moon for Riddle?!” Olivia exclaimed, bouncing in her seat. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Charlotte, who’d been quiet up until that point, spoke up with her unnervingly squeaky voice “Merlin’s Beard! Penny, have you really got a thing for Riddle?! I know I’ve seen you checking him out -” she was cut off as Penny swatted her arm. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Don’t go flipping your wig over it!” She rushed in a hushed whisper, “But, yes … I may be inclined to accept an invitation to this ridiculous ball, if a certain someone were to ask me.”. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Blushing to the roots of her hair now, she leveled a stern look to her friends, as she pleaded with them to keep silent about the whole thing. Penny was unaware of who was approaching them from behind. Charlotte's eyes grew wide as saucers, while Olivia leaned into to whisper “speaking of a certain someone.” as she gave a wink. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Penny glanced over her shoulder, a small smile gracing her lips as she spotted Tom crossing the Hogwarts lawn. He seemed to be heading straight for them, and it was with that realization that she turned back to her friends with a quizzical expression on her face. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Girls, he’s coming this way! What do I do?”. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Her normally calm demeanor gave off an air of panic as she searched her friends faces for any hint of what to do next. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Keep your head, no need to get all flustered” Olivia muttered, her experience with the boys of Hogwarts showing in a way that had Penny questioning her friends </span>
  <em>
    <span>extracurricular </span>
  </em>
  <span>activities. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Just smile.” Said a whimsical Charlotte, who had never had a date in her life. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Penny bit her bottom lip, giving a nervous nod of her head as Riddle continued his trek across the great expanse of lawn. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Miller, Wilson” Tom said by way of greeting, once he’d completed the descent. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>His icy blue stare glanced from Olivia to Charlotte with a nod of his head and finally landed on Penny. “Riddle” the girls sang out in unison, smiling up at him. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Good afternoon Penny” his voice clear, a huge smile on his face.  </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He drank in the sight of her, starting with her smartly polished shoes to her stocking clad legs, up and over her black and green checkered uniform skirt to the white, just tight enough blouse adorning the beloved Hogwarts crest. Her tie hung loose around her neck, buttons fastened to the top. Penny’s auburn hair, straight, always perfectly parted in the middle and laid down either side of her shoulders. Finally, he reached her face. Her alabaster skin, a stark contrast to her hair, and her bright beautiful blue eyes sparkled as she looked up at him. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Hello Tom” came her timid reply. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Olivia, amazing friend that she is, got the hint real fast and made to stand. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Goodness, look at the time, we’ve got to get to our next class. Come on Lettie”. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Quickly, she dusted off her skirt, reached for her robes and and slung her bag over her shoulder. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“But class isn’t for another fifteen minutes …” Charlotte began. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“And we’ve got to go now if we want to make it to the greenhouses in time for herbology. Plus, we don’t want to wait ‘til all the good gloves are gone again, </span>
  <em>
    <span>do we</span>
  </em>
  <span>?” Olivia said, helping Charlotte to stand and grabbing her bag. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>They both turned to Penny. “See you for supper Pen” Olivia grinned. Penny smiled nervously at her friend’s retreating backs. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Her attention was brought back to the dashing boy in front of her. Tom, with his blue eyes and his feather light brown hair.  </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Can I walk you to class?” He finally broke their silence, offering a hand down to Penny. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>With more confidence than she felt, Penny reached up to take his hand. “I’d like that” she smiled, picking up her bag and shrugging on her robes. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>While Olivia and Charlotte had herbology for their last class of the day, Penny and Tom had both taken ancient runes. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Tom set a lazy pace to their walk, knowing that he had plenty of time to make it to their next class. His strides were long, but measured, and they both fell into step alongside each other. “So” Penny began, not sure what to say or where to start, but thinking it’d be nice to not walk in silence. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Are you as excited about this dance as the rest of the school?” She heard him snort in laughter, and glanced up to meet his eyes. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I would be, if I had a beautiful witch to escort.” Again, that dazzling smile, and her heart melted. Will he ask me?! She thought hopefully. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh, you’ve not asked anyone yet?” She queried, still looking at him. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Well, there’s this girl I was thinking of asking. But I’m not sure how to go about it.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He could play this game too, he thought with a sly grin, still holding her gaze. They had reached the magnificent entrance of Hogwarts, and Tom stepped forward, pulling open the solid oak door. She crossed the threshold, and he followed behind as it closed with a muffled thud behind them. They continued their journey up the grand staircase and made their way down the long corridors. Torch light bouncing off the walls, throwing their faces into gentle shadow. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Penny smiled for a moment to herself, choosing her next words carefully. She wanted to mention that </span>
  <em>
    <span>she </span>
  </em>
  <span>hadn’t been asked yet, but didn’t want to sound desperate.  “I’m sure the right girl will come along..” she settled on. Praying to Morgana that she didn’t sound foolish. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>His steps faltered and came to a halt. She turned l to face him. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Tom?” She murmured. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>And it was then she noticed that his smile had faded somewhat. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I’m sorry .. “ He stammered, no longer so sure of himself. “I ... I've got to go.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Tom hurried away from her, continuing down the corridor they were walking as she stared wide-eyed at his back. What did I say wrong?! She wondered to herself, flabbergasted by the way he’d up and left. Did I come on too strong? She felt her cheeks heating with embarrassment and tears prickle at the backs of her eyes. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Have I made a fool of myself?!” She wondered aloud. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>And now I’ve got to sit in class with him? Shaking her head, a single tear slipped free. She fled down the corridor the way they came. Back down the grand staircase and past the great hall. She descended another two flights of stairs and made it to the blank space of wall that hid the Slytherin common room. “Pure blood” she softly whispered the password in a hurt voice, tears falling as she rushed through the now revealed door. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“How could I be so stupid!” She scolded, thrusting herself through the empty common room and into the shared sleeping quarters. “I’m sure the right girl will come along? Really?” She moaned, throwing herself onto her bed. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>I’ve made an absolute fool out of myself! She thought, pulling her wand from her robes and using it to draw the curtains around her four poster. In the dim light of the dungeons, she sat, quietly sobbing on her bed. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<hr/>
<p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Tom’s robes billowed around him as he flew down the corridor, a sharp left took him into the nearest bathroom. What have I done? The </span>
  <em>
    <span>right</span>
  </em>
  <span> girl? Right girl!? He had to think about this. Was she the right girl? Sure, she was great to look at, a pure blood and one of the smartest of their year. But still, was she the right girl? </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Her words flitted round his mind like a group of pesky pixies that wouldn’t leave him alone. She may have been the right girl .. so good, so pure, so innocent. But then, was he the wrong bloke? He couldn’t shake the feeling that he was bad for her. He’d been the one to open the chamber of secrets, resulting in that mudblood’s death. He’d been the one to hurt those kids in that cave … he’d been the one to consider making horcruxes, knowing how he had to rip his soul by murder in order to do it. He wasn’t </span>
  <em>
    <span>right</span>
  </em>
  <span>, was he? How could he even consider taking her to the dance? How could he have touched her? His vile and dark magic stained hands helping her off the grass just that afternoon. Had he tainted her? Could she feel it? She had looked at him with trusting eyes, Gently taking his hand, as though it wasn’t covered with insoluble dark magic, and allowed him to escort her down the halls. Her flirty laugh, and her gentle smile, working him up inside. And then she’d said it … the </span>
  <em>
    <span>right</span>
  </em>
  <span> girl. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Three brisk steps brought him to the porcelain sink. With a shaky hand he turned the tap to the highest setting. He splashed the cool water on his face, then braced his hands against the basin. Remorseful eyes stared back at him through the hazy antique mirror.  </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Penny” He whispered with a groan. “Sweet, innocent Penny”. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Gods he wanted her. But he didn’t want to taint her. He’d been watching her … always lurking around, spying on the beautiful witch who had captivated his heart. The way she’d suckle on the sugar quills she acquired from the Hogsmeade trips. The way she’d nervously chew that bottom lip of hers when she was confronted with a situation she was didn’t quite know how to deal with. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He’d see her, every day in their shared classes, brow furrowed in concentration as she tried her damnedest to be at the top of her class. She was good .. she was sweet .. but she was quickly becoming his obsession. Something he wanted. And he always got what he wanted. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“You’ve botched this up royally Tom” He said to himself in the mirror. “But you can fix it. Make it work. You want Penny? Make her yours.” </span>
</p>
