    <p>
  <span>Draco took a sip of his water and rearranged the cutlery in front of him in a nervous gesture, lining the collection of silverware up so that they were perfectly straight. He’d been waiting here for the better part of thirty minutes now and the waiter was starting to give him pitying looks, obviously assuming that Draco had been stood up for a date and was just too proud to admit defeat.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Can I refill your water?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco looked up to see the supercilious waiter smiling down at him with a large pitcher of ice water in his hand. Draco nodded his head and the waiter filled his glass once more.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“May I please have another lemon wedge?” Draco asked, and the waiter walked off to retrieve it.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Just then, a tall, beautiful, blonde woman walked into the restaurant and Draco watched as she exchanged a few words with the hostess before she was pointed in his direction. Sitting up, he straightened his tie and brushed back his signature pale hair, that was just on this side of white, behind his ears.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Crap on a cracker! I’m so late!” the woman exclaimed as she arrived at the table. Draco stood to greet her, holding his hand out for her to shake, but the woman ignored the gesture and instead stepped in and gave him an air kiss above each of his cheeks before settling down in the chair to Draco’s left.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco smiled kindly at her before taking his seat once more just as the waiter returned with his lemon wedge. The man displayed no subtlety at all as his eyes travelled over the woman’s body, which was clad in a form-fitting purple dress with a plunging neckline that put two of her assets on very flattering display. The colour of the dress complemented her complexion to perfection, and her skin was bronzed with a late summer tan.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’ll just give you two a few minutes to check out the menu,” the waiter said before winking at Draco and walking away. Draco suppressed the eye roll that threatened to escape at the waiter’s assumed comradeship with him; Draco would be far more inclined to bend the waiter, with his bubble bum that was practically begging for someone to bite into, over this table than he would the attractive woman seated beside him.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>If Draco hadn’t already known that she was from Canada, her accent would have given her away. “I’m so sorry I’m late! My sister was always telling me that I was pathological in my lateness. She said I would somehow manage to be late to my own funeral one day.” A look of sadness swept over her features before she chased it away and smiled at Draco.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“It’s no trouble at all, Mrs Saylor,” Draco assured her. “I haven’t been waiting for very long.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The woman studied him for a moment before the corner of her mouth pulled up in a knowing smirk. “Liar.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>They chuckled together and Draco found that he felt an affinity to the woman, her bumbling exterior a clever ruse to hide her cunning. Draco picked up the menus that had been left for them when he first arrived and handed one to her before opening his own. Truthfully, he had already read through the menu at least ten times while waiting for her to arrive and had decided on the coq au vin, but he thought it impolite to remind her of her tardiness, especially since he really needed to make a good impression on it.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Mmmm, the coq au vin sounds tasty!” the woman cooed as she scanned the menu and Draco smiled to himself, hidden from view behind his menu.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’ve heard their scallops with spinach and parmesan risotto is also heavenly,” Draco suggested.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The woman flipped the menu closed with a decisive gesture and set it aside. “The risotto it is then!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>When Draco closed his own menu, the waiter appeared promptly, obviously having been watching their table eagerly. “Are we ready to order?” he asked, his focus entirely on Draco’s dining companion.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yes, I’ll have the scallops with spinach and parmesan risotto, please,” the woman ordered as she handed the menu back to the waiter. “And for dessert, I’ll have the salted caramel crème brûlée.” Turning to Draco, she said, “Life’s too short to not have dessert, but if I wait to order until after I’ve eaten, I will have talked myself out of the need for it. This way, I will simply have to make room when it arrives.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco chuckled as the waiter wrote down her order. “And to drink?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“A bottle of your most expensive vintage,” she proclaimed in a pretentious voice as she waved her hand in the air. Draco’s heart leapt into his throat at her words; there was no way he would be able to afford such extravagance anymore, but he put on a strong face, not wanting to appear cheap in front of a potential benefactor. Besides, didn’t they always say you had to spend money to make money? He would just have to cut back on his expenses this month to cover the cost. When she turned to look at him, her brows drew together before her face melted into a relaxed smile. “Relax, Mr Malfoy! Dinner is on me.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The waiter turned to him and asked, “And for you, </span>
  <em>
    <span>sir</span>
  </em>
  <span>?” The emphasis on the last word dripping with judgement about whether the honorific was actually deserved. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“The coq au vin for me. And I’m fine with just the water,” Draco bit out at the waiter that was getting more and more obnoxious as the minutes went by. Even that arse of his wasn’t enough to compensate for his grating personality.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Bring two glasses for the wine,” his companion added before the waiter disappeared to deliver their orders to the kitchen. “I can’t believe you ordered the coq au vin! You’re terrible!” she accused jokingly.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco shrugged, unrepentant. “This way we can try both and we both get the best of both worlds.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“We’ve only just met and already you’re manipulating me. I’d better be careful or you’ll use that silver tongue of yours to talk me out of my entire fortune.” She winked flirtatiously at him as she took a slow sip of water. Draco could see the pink tip of her tongue grazing the rim of the expensive cut crystal water glass.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I don’t think there’s a silver tongue big enough for that, Mrs Saylor,” Draco said, trying to tread a fine line between being friendly without encouraging her flirtation.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“A girl can dream, can’t she? And please, call me Hope,” she said. Draco wasn’t sure what to do with her innuendo-laced statement, but fortunately, she moved past it herself. “And of course you’re right. My ex-husband was obscenely wealthy; he made his fortune in the oil fields, and thanks to his inability to keep his dick in his pants, I walked away with half.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’m sorry,” Draco offered, unsure what to say to that kind of personal information.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Well, that makes one of us, because I’m most certainly not! I’m well shot of him.” She seemed to be scrutinising Draco and he wasn’t sure whether she expected him to say anything or not. Fortunately for him, she saved him from the predicament. “What do you say to getting the business out of the way so that we can enjoy our meals once they arrive?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“My experience has always been that a full stomach often accompanies a loose wallet,” Draco said smoothly, earning a tinkling laugh from Hope.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I love your unique brand of dry humour,” she said, shaking her head at Draco but with an amused look on her face. “You’re very funny. I can see why the kids love you.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Sadly, the kids don’t actually find me all that funny,” Draco said, face lighting up at the thoughts of the children that he had become so fond of.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Somehow I doubt that,” Hope said. “I haven’t had a chance to look over all the financials yet, but I have it on good authority that you are one of the most popular counsellors in the program.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco smirked. “That’s only because I let them get away with saying ‘arse’ in front of me.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hope threw her head back and laughed. “Just imagine how popular you would be if you let them say ‘Fuck’ as well!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’d have shrines built in my honour, I’m sure.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’ll bet!” Hope laughed before sobering and drilling him with a focused look, crossing her hands in her lap with her elbows propped on the armrests of the chair. “ Now, why don’t you tell me a little bit about your charity?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“The Good Faith Outreach Centre was started six years ago,” Draco began before reaching down into the patent leather briefcase he brought with him to pull out the background information packet he compiled for her in preparation for their meeting. “We offer a variety of programmes and after-school activities for children that focus on building empathy, teamwork, and communication skills. We have a year-round sports programme that runs a variety of teams in league sports and a tutoring program.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>They also had several programmes that were geared towards teaching magical children about Muggle customs and technology, but donations for that program were garnered from wizarding world donations, so he didn’t mention those to her. Draco had decided to dedicate his life to making sure magical children had the opportunity to learn about Muggles that he was denied when he was a small boy. Children’s minds were so impressionable and malleable and he didn’t want to see the same toxic prejudices that had infected him in his youth cultivated in the next generations. Having programs that included both wizarding and Muggle children presented certain difficulties, especially around maintaining the Statute of Secrecy, but the risk to the Statute was far outweighed by the risks of prejudice and racism continuing to be cultivated amongst the pure-blood families.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hope was nodding her head as she listened to Draco’s spiel and looked interested. Taking a deep breath to quell his nerves, Draco launched into his pitch, “Our next goal is to expand and implement a music programme. Lots of the children have expressed an interest in learning to play an instrument, but unfortunately, the startup costs for it are quite steep and that’s what we’re hoping you’d be interested in donating to.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I see,” Hope said, her voice flat for a moment before it broke and a small gasping sound escaped. Her lips thinned and she averted her face. Draco wasn’t sure what he had said that had upset her so much, but he felt terrible. Without being too obvious about it, he offered her one of the spare napkins, which she took without a word. Draco took a sip of his lemon-flavoured water and averted his eyes while she composed herself.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Gah! Sorry about that!” she cried. “My sister loved music and used to be a music teacher.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“How long ago did she pass?” Draco asked carefully. It was obvious from the woman’s reactions that she’d lost her sister. That was a pain Draco could relate to.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“It will have been nine years now,” Hope whispered in a quiet voice. “At least, as far as I know. She disappeared and I never knew exactly what happened to her. One day she was here and the next...she was just gone.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco cleared his throat before taking another sip of his water, fighting back the barrage of memories that loomed in his mind like an ever-present threat, as if they were just waiting for the dam to break.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You’d think it would get easier,” Hope said as she stared out the window at the busy street traffic taking advantage of the sunny heat of the July afternoon. “And it does, I suppose. I can go days at a time now and function almost as if I’m a normal human being, like there isn’t a huge gaping hole in my chest that nothing can fill, but then something will remind me of her and it’s like it was just yesterday that I spoke to her last.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I know how you feel,” Draco commiserated.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hope turned to look at him and he watched as her grief played clear as day across her features. “You couldn’t possibly know how I feel,” she stated flatly. Before Draco could say anything, Hope shook her head a few times and carefully ran her fingers along her lower eyelid, wiping away the last remnants of her tears. “Enough of that self-pity! All we can do now is try to move on and do what needs to be done. How much money do you need to get this music programme of yours off the ground?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco bit the inside of his lip, feeling like he was taking advantage of her when she was feeling vulnerable. “We don’t have to discuss this now,” he offered.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“How much?” she asked resolutely.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco watched her nervously, but a business-like mask had taken over her face and she stared intently at him, waiting for his answer. Her eyes were still ringed in red, but aside from that, she looked business-like. “We’ll have to buy all the musical instruments and set up a regular rental for a practice space, hire some musical instructors and—”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“How much?” she insisted.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“We figured that we should be able to get everything up and running for the first year with £25k.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“£25k for one year, you said?” she asked as she reached into her small silver clutch and pulled out a cheque book.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“That’s right,” Draco confirmed, heart racing at the sign that she may have agreed to sponsor their project. He watched as the beautiful—and expensive—fountain pen scratched across the surface of the paper; he may no longer have a vault full of gold, but he still appreciated the finger things, and that pen could probably cover a week’s worth of salary of one of his counsellors. He held his breath as she carefully tore the perforated slip of paper out of the book and tucked it back into her purse.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Then this should see you through at least four years,” she said casually as she held out the thin slip of paper for Draco, who sat frozen in shock.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Unbelieving, he reached out and took the cheque with trembling fingers. He was in such a daze that it took him a second to register the touch on his forearm.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What an interesting tattoo.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco fought the urge to yank his arm back. He usually kept his Dark Mark covered but the late July heatwave that had been plaguing London for the last week had finally broken down his resolve. If he’d been meeting with a witch or wizard, he could have cast a Cooling Charm on himself without drawing any scrutiny, but he didn’t want to risk it knowing that he would be meeting with a Muggle this afternoon. The heat had been stifling enough that he had finally relented and rolled up the sleeves of his button-up.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“It’s quite dark, isn’t it?” Hope asked. Her fingers felt icy cold against his skin as she trailed them over the faded red lines of the skull and down the hissing serpent. He shivered, goose pimples breaking out on his body at her touch; he rarely let anyone see the visual reminder of the weakness and naivety that had lead to his enslavement by a madman, let alone touch it. “What does it represent?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“The foolishness of youth,” Draco answered, the words not a lie but nowhere near the truth either.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hope slipped her hand back to her side of the table and smiled kindly at him. “My apologies. I didn’t mean to make you uncomfortable.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“No, it’s fine, really,” Draco rushed to assure her. “I just...I don’t like thinking about that time of my life.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I can appreciate that,” Hope said, her brows drawing together as she studied him. After a few moments of consideration, she continued, “We all have things from our past that we’d rather not face.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What about you?” Draco asked. “What are you trying to avoid?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The serious look on her face lasted for a few more seconds before her expression cleared and she pasted on a smile. “Oh me? I made the ill-advised decision to get a </span>
  <em>
    <span>perm</span>
  </em>
  <span> right before my graduation ceremony.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco gave her a small smile, grateful for the change of topic. He wasn’t keen to spill his darkest moments to someone he’d just met either. “I can tell you one thing you won’t regret: supporting our new music programme.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco held up the tiny slip of paper that symbolised so much potential and joy and Hope laughed. “I’m sure I won’t.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What’s your sister’s name? We’ll name the program in her honour,” Draco offered, thinking it was the least he could do for this guardian angel that was single-handedly providing this amazing opportunity for countless children.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“There’s no need for that.” Hope shook her head, a strange emotion that Draco couldn’t identify flitting across her face. “I’ve always found it tacky when rich people plaster their names all over everything. I’d prefer that this donation remain anonymous.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Are you sure?” Draco asked as he tucked the cheque into a pocket in his briefcase.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Absolutely. Charity is most satisfying when it is for charity’s sake,” she declared.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Just then, the obnoxious waiter returned with their order. Once he had ensured the wine was to her liking and had sprinkled their plates with freshly ground pepper—and had snuck several more covert glances at Hope’s decolletage—he departed once more.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I do have one request, however…” she began, trailing off.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Anything you want,” Draco said.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Anything?” she asked coquettishly, eyelashes fluttering.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco smirked. “Within reason.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hope donned a faux pout for a few seconds before reaching over and grabbing one of the unused bread plates. “I demand a taste of that coq au vin.”</span>
</p>
