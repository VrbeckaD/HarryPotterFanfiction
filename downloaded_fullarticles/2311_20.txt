    <p dir="ltr">“... Harry Potter!”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Harry stood rigid at the sound of his name. He was sure a gust of wind could have knocked him right over in that moment as his heart thundered a rapid beat in his ears. Briefly, he wondered if this was what shock felt like.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But no.</p>
<p dir="ltr">He couldn’t say he was all that shocked.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The burn of hundreds of pairs of eyes on him made his skin crawl and the knowledge that hundreds more were watching him, judging him, from behind a screen was enough to make him want to make a scene. He didn’t dare, though, not when his eyes swept up and met those of Ginny Weasley.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Ginny was the picture of absolute calm, her features an unreadable mask. It was her eyes, however, alive with a fire Harry was exceedingly familiar with that kept his mouth shut and allowed him to be prodded none-so-gently to the podium. His eyes didn’t leave her face as his feet found the few steps up onto the podium of their own accord. It was a minor miracle that he didn’t trip, for which he was rather glad. He didn’t figure that would make the impression he would want to make.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Shame and anger twisted his stomach at the thought. It had been mere moments since his name had been selected from the cup, and already he was playing into the game the Ministry had intended for him with these reapings, even days away from the arena.</p>
<p dir="ltr">He took his place next to Rita Skeeter opposite Ginny and forced his eyes to roam over the crowd. There was the perfunctory applause Harry was all-too familiar with, but no cheering. In fact, it was almost eerily quiet once the clapping stopped. Faces young and old wore grim expressions. Any relief they might have been feeling was overpowered by the reality of two young people being sent to their almost certain demise.</p>
<p dir="ltr">After all, a District 9 tribute hadn’t won the Games in some twenty years, and Harry didn’t particularly feel like the odds were going in his favour.</p>
<p dir="ltr">When Harry’s eyes caught sight of a bundle of red-heads sequestered on the outskirts of the crowd, a pang of something sharp struck him in the region of his heart. Desolation was writ clear as day on their faces as they looked at Ginny. He searched for his friend, Ron, and found that he was staring not at Ginny, but right back at him. His face was set in stony rage, and if he had not been too old by only a couple of months, Harry was convinced that right now he would be volunteering to take his place in a devoted, if ultimately idiotic, attempt to protect his sister.</p>
<p dir="ltr">When he zoned back into reality, Skeeter was rattling off the same spiel she gave every year about what an honour it was to be chosen for this momentous occasion. Harry thought, rather unkindly, that she could take her ‘honour’ and shove it up her arse.</p>
<p dir="ltr">She then turned to each of them in turn and asked — much too excitedly than was completely normal — how they felt about this opportunity. Harry’s scathing response died on his tongue at the minuscule shake of Ginny’s head, and he let her answer with some rubbish about what a privilege it was to be there. He could not make himself respond with anything other than a small nod of his head in ostensible agreement.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Skeeter stared at him from behind a pair of ridiculous purple glasses that certainly held more stylish purposes than practical, waiting very obviously for him to contribute something. He opened his mouth, barely taking in the warning look Ginny shot at him, and said — having no idea it was what he was going to say — “I think it was only a matter of time, really, until my name was drawn from that cup.”</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="center">—</p>
<p dir="ltr">The only one who visited Harry before they dragged him off to the Ministry was Ronald Weasley. This was an even more unsurprising development than being chosen as a tribute had been.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Harry didn’t even consider the Dursleys showing up. He was certain that for years they’d been putting more slips of his name in the cup in exchange for extra rations. They were probably the only ones actually celebrating the occasion. Whether he won or not, they would finally be rid of him.</p>
<p dir="ltr">And now that his name had been called, he had successfully clinched the possibility of their precious ‘Duddykins’ ever becoming tribute, for this was the last year either of them were eligible.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Harry scrutinized Ron’s clenched jaw and red-rimmed eyes and assumed he’d just been to visit Ginny.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Hi, Ron. Thanks for coming to see me,” Harry said after it became clear Ron was only going to stare at him, expression inscrutable.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Harry hadn’t been sure he would come, and he wouldn’t have blamed, either, for wanting to stay with his sister. Even if Ron <em>was </em>about to threaten him on Ginny’s behalf, Harry was absurdly grateful anyone bothered to see him at all before he was swept away and likely wouldn’t see any of them ever again.</p>
<p dir="ltr">He cursed himself for the thought the second after it occurred to him. Harry had never been one for giving up, and he’d already survived 17 years with the Dursleys hadn’t he? He couldn’t very well imagine himself capable of murder, but then he couldn’t really imagine not at least trying to defend himself, either.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Of course I came, Harry. You’re my best mate.” Ron wasn’t looking at him now. His shoulders were curled inwards, like an immense weight had been placed upon his shoulders, and a sudden wave of sympathy for his friend washed over Harry.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Before he could swallow the words, he was saying, “I’m sorry… you know, about Ginny.” He winced and shut his mouth before he could mention Fred.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Ron shuddered, and then visibly pulled himself together, his broad shoulders straightening. “Don’t be ridiculous, Harry. That wasn’t your fault, there’s no way you could have stopped it from happening. None of us could have. It’s those stupid <em>wankers </em>at the — ” Ron wisely cut himself off, glancing about the room in a way that told Harry he was looking for cameras. And even if there was any, Harry thought, they wouldn’t be able to see them. Harry was convinced the Ministry had ways of spying on the people that only they knew about.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Look, Harry,” Ron continued after a moment. Harry saw the struggle on his face and had an idea of where this conversation was going. “I’m not… I’m not gonna ask you to give your life for her, or anything, because that isn’t fair, but… I just— could you— ”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It’s alright, Ron. I understand.” Harry smiled weakly in an attempt to stop Ron from looking so miserable. “Of course I’ll try my best to look after her. I’m offended you even thought you had to ask.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">A heavy weight was suddenly upon him as Ron’s long arms wrapped him up and pulled him into a hug that hindered Harry’s ability to draw breath. He didn’t even pretend to put up a struggle, falling into the embrace like it was the only thing keeping him standing.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I’m gonna miss you, mate.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Christ, I’m not dead, yet,” Harry said, voice muffled by the press of fabric. His head was buried in Ron’s shoulder, and he desperately wished in that instance that Ron would just never let go. That time would cease, and he could spend the rest of forever right here.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But unfortunately Harry could not stop time, and Ron could not stay, and there was a train waiting to take him to the Ministry, a ticket to hell with his name on it.</p>
<p dir="ltr">And as the train sped by fields of wheat, a sight so familiar after years of staring at them from atop a hill, moving at speeds greater than Harry could possibly comprehend, Harry couldn’t say with any degree of certainty whether the life waiting for him was really any worse than the one he was leaving behind.</p>
