          <div class="userstuff"><p>Dear Potter,</p>
<p>I'm sorry.</p>
<p>I want to apologise for everything. I can make a list of things I've done wrong.</p>
<p>1) Offering everyone chances based off their blood purity.<br/>2) Hurting you.<br/>3) The war, and everythng I've ever done.<br/>4) Being a coward.<br/>5) Running away from my problems.<br/>6) Accidentally punching you in the face when you kissed me on our date last weekend.</p>
<p>I know I've done many stupid things, but I hope you'll forgive me. If it's alright with you, I'll pick you up at six? Wear that green jumper I got you.</p>
<p>Love from your favourite git,</p>
<p>Malfoy.</p></div>
