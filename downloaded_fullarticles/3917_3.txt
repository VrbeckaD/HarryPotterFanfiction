    <p>
  <span>The cupboard door is open.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
  <span>He knows this before he even opens his eyes. The space where the door is supposed to be is like an open maw, waiting. Just waiting. He feels</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Unsafe</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Here with the door open, but when he reaches out he feels- what does he feel?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He feels cold.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
  <span>The hallway outside the cupboard is dark. He presses his palm against the floor and digs his nails into the wood, burrowing and anchoring until he feels safe again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The cupboard is too big around him. The door that is not a door is too close. When he reaches up, there are no cobwebs to catch his fingers and the stairs are wider than they used to be.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>This is not his cupboard, and outside is not his hallway, and inside-</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Oh my,</span>
  </em>
  <span> the voice is soft and Harry breathes it in and it tastes like smoke and coats his throat like ash and he thinks- </span>
  <em>
    <span>This is just too easy.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Who are you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The darkness doesn’t answer, but he feels it when it leaves, like pressure leaking away, unnoticable until it’s gone</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
  <span>And </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It’s gone?</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
  <span>When he opens his eyes, he is in his cupboard again, and the door is closed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>With trembling hands, he reaches out to touch it. The wood is solid, but when he scratches, it breaks away like grains of sand beneath his nails, the sound of it like whispers against the floorboards where it falls.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He picks his nails clean and licks the grit away, just to make sure, and he tastes-</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He closes his eyes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He doesn’t dream.</span>
