  <strong>3rd Person POV:</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>Percy Weasley knew it was dangerous messing with time; but the unknown spell could help everyone, especially his family. Sure he could apologize, but he thinks this will be so much better. Fred wouldn't be crippled, and George would still have his ear. His family would be whole again and he could make sure all of their sorrows and tragedies wouldn't happen. He would make sure he fixed all of his horrendous mistakes. He could change the fight and explain things to his dad instead of storming away....Â </p><p>As he finished his letters to his family explaining everything, and yes even apologizing he set up the spell for the ritual. He stopped to watch his owl Hermes fly away, then continued prepping. When he finished he started chanting and was waiting for something to happen. If the spell had gone right he would wake up in the burrow in his fifth year, with all his memories. Instead a big column of smoke appeared around what looked like a portal. As he tried to stop his chanting the column got bigger and bigger. Soon he's engulfed by the smoke and by the time the Weasley's get to the house he'll be gone.</p><p>Percy Weasley was no more. As he closed his eyes and let darkness fill his vision worlds away a baby is being born with messy red hair and blue-green eyes. This childs name is Jason Peter Todd, and when the time comes to remember his past life he will no longer be the Percy Weasley his family came to love.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>
