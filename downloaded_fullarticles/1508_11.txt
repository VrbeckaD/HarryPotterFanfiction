<p> </p>
<p>At the scratch of an owls claws against a window, Harry looks up from his sandwich. Standing he walks over to the window to push it open. Lifting his right arm for the owl to land on Harry spins lightly on his feet walking back over to the table and sitting down.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Once Harry had sat, the owl hoots imperiously as it raises one of its legs into the air. While untying the letter from its leg Harry offers it the last of his sandwich. Hooting at him again the owl jumps off his arm and flies out the window, sandwich held in its beak. Looking down at the letter Harry grimaces at the Gringotts logo embossed on the front of the envelope.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Carefully ripping the envelope open, Harry pulls the letter out and fattens it out on the table. Starting from the top, Harry cautiously reads the letter.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">
  <em> Heir Potter, </em>
</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p align="center">
  <em> This correspondence is in regards to a few inconsistencies we have noted down in our records.  </em>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em> To correct these we firmly request your presence at your utmost earliest convenience. </em>
</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p align="center">
  <em> Bloodfang </em>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em> Potter Account Manager </em>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em> Gringotts Bank </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Looking up from the letter Harry pulls his wand out of its holster and mutters "Tempus." under his breath. A slightly hazy 3:47 hangs in front of his face before slowly disappearing. Waving a hand through the smoke a few times, sheathing his wand Harry thinks,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>'So... Ginny said they would be back around 5:30, and they're probably talking about the dragon which I know they are still angry about on account of the looks they always give me.' Wincing, Harry shakes his head slightly. 'I shouldn't keep them waiting, that will most definitely make everything worse.'</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Standing, Harry picks up his empty plate and brings it into the kitchen. Setting in it into the sink Harry turns toward the door, absent-mindedly watching out of the corner of his eye as his plate is washed. Freezing, Harry shakes his head before pulling his wand back out then pointing it in front of himself and firmly says, "Accio parchment, Accio quill, Accio inkwell." Catching the three items when they fly down the stairs, Harry quickly jots down a note to Ginny telling her where he is heading in case she gets back before he does.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Setting the note onto the counter, Harry walks out the door, grabbing his jacket off the hook next to as he goes by it. Shrugging the jacket on Harry shoots a quick, locking charm at the door. Spinning lightly on his heel, Harry disapparates to Diagon Alley.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Appearing at the apparition point in Diagon, Harry quickly moves out of the small area and onto Diagon Alley proper. Harry walks down toward the bank at a brisk pace waving hello to a few people along the alleyway that he knows but not well enough to stop and chat with them.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Stepping up to the doors, Harry grimaces at the glares the door guards give him without moving their gazes from the street, walking in his eyes flick quickly over the second set of doors and he quickly scans the warning imprinted on the door.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">{ <b>Enter, stranger, but take heed</b></p>
<p align="center">
  <b>Of what awaits the sin of greed,</b>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <b>For those who take, but do not earn,</b>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <b>Must pay most dearly in their turn,</b>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <b>So if you seek beneath our floors</b>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <b>A treasure that was never yours,</b>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <b>Thief, you have been warned, beware</b>
</p>
<p align="center"><b>Of finding more than treasure there.</b> }</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Walking past the second set of doors and fully into the bank, Harry can see the way all the goblins currently in the room seem to straighten and shift slightly in their chairs subconsciously to keep him in their eyesight. Wincing, Harry steps up to the nearest teller, thinking 'Here we go...'</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The teller makes him wait almost ten minutes before he 'She...It..?' calls him forward. "What?" He snaps at Harry.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Uh... I got a letter telling me to come to meet someone called uh... Bloodfang?" Harry says while quickly checking the letter to make sure the name was right.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The goblin imperiously raises a hand, palm out, toward him, snarling, "Letter." at Harry's confused look.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A quiet, "Oh," leaves Harry at the word before he quickly hands the letter over to the goblin, not wanting to anger him more than he already had. The teller scans the letter then calls something over his shoulder in a weird growling language. Another goblin comes up behind the teller eyeing Harry across the counter. "Take this wizard to see Bloodfang." The word wizard is sneered out mockingly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The second goblin snarls, "Follow me." at Harry before turning smartly and strides down a hallway behind the counter, expecting Harry to follow him. Hurrying around the counter Harry rushes to follow after the goblin. Keeping pace with the goblin Harry gazes around in fascination, he had never been this way before, he is pleasantly surprised at the elaborate paintings adorning the walls. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>As he had been studying the paintings while he was walking, they get to a grand ornate door rather quickly. "Here." the goblin escorting him snarls again before turning and walking back the way they had come. Turning Harry faces the door then raises a fist, hesitates slightly before he knocks roughly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Enter." A gruff voice echoes out through the door. Harry pushes the door open, stepping through he walks up to a desk on the far side of the room. "Um... I'm Harry Potter. I got a letter asking me to come to Gringotts."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The goblin sitting behind the desk looks up from a large stack of folders, raising an eyebrow at Harry he replies, "Yes, yes. I know, I sent it. Now, before we get started I'm going to need to confirm you are who you say you are."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Confused, Harry asks "How will you do that exactly?"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"You are to place seven drops of blood onto this parchment." Pulling a piece of parchment out of the top folder and a knife from a drawer on the desk the goblin sets both down on the part of the desk closest to Harry before continuing, "Using your blood the potion the parchment has been soaked in will write out a few things we need to know to show you're the person you say you are."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"And if I'm not?" Harry questions but the goblin only grins at him sharp teeth bared.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"OK, understood." Harry quickly but cautiously grabs the handle of the knife with his right hand, bringing the tip of the knife to his left-hand middle finger, he makes a quick slicing motion with his right hand. Letting a slight hiss out through his teeth he holds his left hand over the parchment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Watching carefully as it starts to drip, Harry counts the seven required drops out in his head before quickly putting his finger in his mouth. Sucking lightly on the cut Harry and the goblin both watch as the blood slowly shapes into letters then words on the parchment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The goblin picks up the parchment and looks it over, his eyes flicking through the first two sections before he tilts his head at a slight angle toward Harry, eyes not moving away from him, then he informs Harry, "I am Bloodfang. I have been the Potter Account Manager for 2 years now. The last one, Grimclaw, was killed in the Dark Lord's slaughter. When I took over the account I found inconsistencies in the amount of money in the Potter family vault. For the past two years, I have been digging through buried records and I found that Grimclaw had been moving money from the vault and transferring it elsewhere without your permission. Would you like to know what he was doing with that money?"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry's mouth opens and closes a few times before he starts to answer that he would when the goblin starts speaking again, "On November 1st, 1981 Albus Dumbledore arranged for 5,000 galleons to be given to Grimclaw yearly. Also On November 1st, 1981 Albus Dumbledore arranged for a 10,000 galleon transfer to his personal vault to happen yearly. On August 1, 1990, Albus Dumbledore arranged for a 5,000 galleon transfer to Molly Weasley's personal vault occurring yearly. On September 1, 1995, Albus Dumbledore arranged for a 3,000 galleon transfer to Ginerva Weasley's personal vault yet again occurring yearly. These transfers continued until I found them just after the last transfer to Ginerva Weasley and stopped them."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry just stared at him completely still, Bloodfang waits almost a minute for a response, before looking over the parchment with Harry’s inheritance results more thoroughly before he speaks again, "Ah... well I would recommend that you use our neutralizing pool to neutralize the potions that you are under and also schedule an appointment with our healers to ritually break the blocks put upon you, it would be 10 galleons for the neutralizing and 50 galleons to break the blocks. Would you like to do this?"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry nods looking dazed at all the information he had been given. Bloodfang writes down a few things on a piece of parchment, rolls it up and waves a hand over it, standing he watches the scroll disappear. Striding around the desk he tells Harry, "The amount has been taken from the Potter family vault and your appointment is one week from tomorrow for the breaking of the blocks. We can do the neutralizing pool now" </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Bloodfang continues his stride the rest of the way to the door, pulls it open and yells something out around the doorframe in that same weird growly language the teller had used. In slight shock, Harry reaches out and grabs the parchment with his results on it and dazedly reads it.</p>

<p>Looking up Harry tries to process what he had just read but before he could really start to understand it, Bloodfang raises his voice to get his attention and tells him, "Follow this goblin here," he points to a goblin standing just outside the office scowling at Harry, "He will take you to the neutralizing pool, remember it only neutralizes them for a month after that the effects will come back. Return to Gringotts and we’ll have them neutralized again, for a small fee, of course." </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Smiling closed-mouthed at Harry, Bloodfang ushers Harry out of the room, closing the door after him. Stuffing the parchment into his jacket pocket Harry follows distractedly after the goblin guide mentally focused on assimilating all the information that he had been informed of in such a short amount of time.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Arriving back to the Burrow a few hours later Harry wanders distractedly into the house, unconsciously following the noise level into the family room. A chorus of hellos greets him startling him out of the daze he had been in since reading about the potions he was on. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ginny stands from the arm of the couch and walks up to him with a warm smile on her face. She asks, "So what did the goblins want?" before leaning in for a quick kiss. At the question, Harry's mind quickly starts scrambling for a good reason he could tell her and doesn't notice her lean in.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Focusing back on her right before her lips touch his he pulls away from her before she can kiss him, Harry then lies straight to her face "They wanted to talk about the dragon, had me pay the amount the repairs had cost." From his spot on the couch with his arm wrapped around Hermione, Ron loudly says, "Ohhhhh... tough luck, mate." </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry looks over at them from where he is carefully edging around Ginny while trying to seem like he is acting completely normal and gets an idea. Remembering that neither Ron nor Hermione had been listed on the parchment at all he calls over to them, "Hey Ron, Hermione can I speak to you two, alone." He nods slightly toward Ginny to say it's about her and he has to hide his relief when they stand while nodding their heads.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ron tells him, "We can talk in my old room." The three of them then quickly walk up the stairs to Ron's old bedroom.  Ron and Hermione sit down on the bed while Harry stands in front of them looking as if he is about to start pacing. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hermione and Ron exchange a look before Hermione calmly says, "Harry, what's wrong?" A burst of noise escapes from Harry aimed at Ron, thankful for the silencing charms on the room Harry exclaims, "Your sister love potioned me!"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Another set of looks are exchanged between Ron and Hermione, these slightly amused before Ron says, "Mate, just ‘cause you're nervous for the wedding this weekend doesn't mean you should accuse Ginny of giving you a love potion." </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I'm not saying this because I'm nervous. Do you honestly think I would do that?” Harry asks them looking at them pleadingly. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hermione looks away from him as she says “I don't know maybe Harry after all you have some pretty crazy ideas all the time.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Not about something like this,” Harry tells them miffed at her reply.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Growling slightly under his breath at their shrugs Harry reaches into his jacket pocket and forcibly pulls the piece of parchment out and hands it to them and frustrated he tells them, "Just read it."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry turns and starts pacing the length of the room as the other two read, Harry watches them in his peripheral vision and can tell when they get to the potion section as Hermione's eyes narrow and her lips pinch together unhappily as she keeps reading and Ron's eyes continue to widen for each of the first three but narrow suddenly at the last one. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ron suddenly stands and shouts "HOW DARE THEY DO THIS! THIS IS SO WRONG! HOW DAR..." Ron's voice suddenly cuts off at Hermione's softly spoken, "Silencio."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“That’s not even everything!” Harry snaps out, “My account manager told me that Dumbledore had arranged for money, MY money, to be transferred to the old account managers' personal vault, Dumbledore’s personal vault, Molly’s personal vault, and Ginny's personal vault. 23,000 galleons a year for the last four years and for the five years before that 20,000 galleons a year and for the ten years before that he had been taking 15,000 galleons a year from MY vaults, stealing my money! Do you know how much money that is all together? It’s almost 350,000 galleons!” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Panting slightly Harry stops pacing and stands directly across from them, Hermione still sitting on the bed parchment held in hand as she stares at Harry, Ron standing in front of the bed also watching Harry, his face and ears red with anger, the color slowly dying down to pink. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The three of them stay where they are for a few minutes as Ron and Hermione process everything Harry had told and shown them, Harry waiting for a response. Suddenly Hermione’s shoulders stiffen and she sits up straighter and she says an icy, “Wait a minute.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Both Ron and Harry’s heads turn slightly to face her, the coldly furious look painted on her face surprising them while she waits until she has their attention before she very primly states, "I just realized that if you're under potions and have blocks on your magic, Harry, then who stopped Dumbledore from giving potions and putting blocks on me and Ron."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry’s expression darkens before he murmurs, “He had better not have, or I will…” the words trail off as Harry descends into angry mutters. Hermione's icy expression melts away into a fond one at the threats Harry continues to issue toward the already dead Dumbledore. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Exasperatedly, Hermione opens her mouth to stop him before he gets even more creative or silly as the last one he had muttered had been of force-feeding him sherbert lemons until he explodes when she notices Ron waving his wand wordlessly canceled the silencing charm. Breaking through Harry’s threats of suffocating Dumbledore with his own socks, Ron suggests, “We’ll have to go to Gringotts ourselves and get checked, ‘Mione. I mean we did the most basic one when we opened that vault a couple of years ago but that test really only shows your name.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry’s muttering stops and his expression brightens considerably at that idea before he tells them, “Let's go now! We can pretend its something for the wedding so they don't get suspicious. At Gringotts, they have this thing that neutralizes the effects of potions for a month and that will give us time to figure a few things out.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The other two agree before Hermione casts a quick incendio on Harry’s inheritance result parchment, turning it to ash before the three of them leave the room, walking downstairs they go through the now empty living room and to the back door, hearing voices coming from the kitchen. Harry waits impatiently as Ron and Hermione quickly pull their coats on, Ron then ushers them outside before calling back into the house, “Bye everyone we’ll see you tomorrow.” Closing the door Ron quietly tells the other two, “C' mon let’s go before they try to make the three of us stay.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Quickly the three move away from the door past the ward lines before they apparate away right before the door opens again and Ginny pops her head outside.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p> </p>
<p>While the three of them are walking down Diagon Alley together Ron asks, “So how do we do this, mate? Last time we told them we wanted to open a vault and they directed us to a random goblin. Do we just ask to get an inheritance test?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“No, I think I can ask to be taken back to the goblin that did mine, he introduced himself as the Potter account manager anyway.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Are you sure it works like that?” Hermione asks Harry skeptically. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I mean it should. What other way do you think it would work?” Harry shrugs as they pass Flourish and Blotts. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Walking up to the closest open teller, Harry walks slightly faster to be in front of the other two before he steps right up to the counter and confidently says, “We need to be taken to see Bloodfang.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The goblin looks up from the scrolls in front of him and scowls at the trio as he snidely questions, “And do you not know the way to his office?” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Expression confused answers the goblins question with another question, “So we just go back by ourselves?” rather than answering the goblin just looks back down and starts shuffling through some scrolls ignoring Harry completely. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Looking back at Ron and Hermione, Harry says, “So I guess we just go back by ourselves. C'mon follow me.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ron nods and says, “We’re right behind you, Mate.” Hermione nods in agreement. Turning around, Harry walks around the counter and down the hallway toward Bloodfang’s office, the other two following along after him. Once in the hallway, Hermione makes a sound of excitement before she pushes past Harry as she rushes over to the elaborate paintings Harry had seen earlier.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Hermione we need to go check we can’t stop to look at paintings,” Harry says in exasperation </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Give me a minute, then we’ll go, OK Harry?” Hermione says distractedly as she starts to study the paintings causing Ron and Harry to exchange fondly exasperated glances.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I think these show the goblin wars, from the goblins side of course,” Hermione exclaims after few minutes. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Before Hermione can get completely absorbed in studying the paintings Ron calls over to her, “‘Mione, we have to keep going, we can’t just stand here forever.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Startling slightly, Hermione turns to face the two men, blushing slightly she crosses her arms and harrumphs as she tells them, “I know we have to keep going but I’ll probably never see these again and they’re just so exciting.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>They start moving down the hallway as Hermione speaks, arriving at the ornate door Harry knocks roughly, more confident than he had earlier. Bloodfang’s gruff voice calls, “Enter.”  through the doors again. Exchanging looks with Ron and Hermione, Harry pushes the door open and walks in ahead of the other two.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Raising his head from the pile of folders on his desk, noticeably smaller than it had been earlier, Bloodfang beckons them forward once he recognizes Harry.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Walking forward the three move right up to the opposite side of the desk from Bloodfang, “Ah… Heir Potter, What business you need me for?” Bloodfang questions once the three had stopped in front of his desk. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry stars speaking almost before he finishes the question, “I would like inheritance tests done on my two friends here and if needed I want to pay for them to use the neutralization pool.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“And which test do you want to do?” Bloodfang asks as he moves some files more toward the side of his desk than in front of him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“The one that shows everything,” Harry tells him immediately.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Nodding his head Bloodfang opens on of the drawers in his desk and pulls out two pieces of parchment and the same knife Harry had used in the test earlier, setting them down on his desk on the side closer to the trio. “Seven drops on one parchment,” Bloodfang tells them before sitting back slightly in his chair eyeing the three of them for a minute before he starts looking through one of the folders.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Turning toward the other two Harry opens his mouth to ask who wanted to go first when Hermione pushes past him and picks up the knife slicing her middle finger on her right hand. Hermione sets the knife down next to the parchment after doing a swift wandless cleaning spell. She holds her non-dominant hand over the parchment. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>She waits semi-patiently for the seven drops to land on the parchment before moving it slightly back and doing a wandless healing charm on it. After Hermione sets the knife down, Ron moves past Harry and slices his own finger and holds it over the other parchment, after the seven drops he holds his hand out to Hermione who rolls her eyes as she heals the cut. The room watches as the blood spreads on the pages and slowly writes out words Hermione's finishing quicker, Hermione picks it up and the other two hover behind her to read it.</p>

<p>Rocking back on her heels in shock Hermione sucks a breath in through her teeth at the results, immediately she starts to think through all her memories trying to figure this out.

<p>When he reaches the end of the results Harry growls out a curse before he starts to pace in front of the desk. Finishing a few seconds after Harry, Ron just continues to stare down at the parchment trying to comprehend everything written on it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“As I said earlier this afternoon it is 10 galleons for neutralizing any potions and it would be 50 galleons to break the blocks, and you would need an appointment for the second,” Bloodfang interjects into the silence following reading the results, looking up from the files he had been flipping through.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I want both for each of them and I will pay,” Harry says immediately, stopping his pacing in between the other two who look up from the parchment clenched in their hands.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Which vault would you like the money taken from?” Bloodfang questions calmly, already grabbing a spare parchment to record his answer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“The Potter Family Vault.” Harry blurts the first one to come to mind.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Nodding Bloodfang writes something on the spare piece of parchment, seals it, then waves a hand over it before he jumps up and walks past them to the door which he opens then calls out in the weird growly language.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Within a minute another goblin comes up to Bloodfang who tells him something in the growly language before turning back to the trio and telling them, “Follow this goblin, he will take you to the neutralizing pool.” Bloodfang then quickly ushers them out of his office and closes the door with a toothless smile.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p> </p>
<p>After using the neutralizing pool, the trio talk and decide together that it would be better to not go back to the burrow tonight and to head to Ron and Hermione’s flat. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Arriving at the flat Hermione unlocks the door then usher the other two in ahead of her calling for them to hang up their coats when they walk straight into the living room. Sheepishly the men walk back into the entry room to hang up their coats on the hooks.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>All three of them then walk into the living room Ron half-collapsing on the nearest couch Harry walking slightly further to do the same on the second couch. Rolling her eyes lightly Hermione slumps into the armchair. For the next little while, the three just lay there contemplating everything they had found out that day.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Suddenly in the silence, the words, “Merlin if only we could go back and change all this!” seem to burst unwittingly out of Ron’s throat.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In the silence following his words, Hermione shrugs and offhandedly replies, “We could.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>At the reply, both Ron and Harry sit straight up on their couches and say at the same time, “WHAT?!?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Yeah I found this ritual third year and memorized it but it wasn't any use at the time so I kinda just put it with all the other useless but fascinating knowledge in my mind.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Let’s do it, then!” Harry exclaims, jumping up from the couch and walking over to a bookshelf with potion ingredients muttering under his breath he starts picking up different items asking Hermione, “Do we need this?” With each one. Both Hermione and Ron watch him for a few minutes, the only noise other than Harry questions, being Hermione’s responses. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Signing Ron turns to Hermione questions, “So what do we need?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“4 Bicon horns, 3 Ashwinder eggs, 2 quarts powdered rue, 9 rose thorns, 3 tablespoons pearl dust, 3 teaspoons hairy fungus, and the two harder ingredients are freely given unicorn blood and time turner dust.”  Hermione lists out to them.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“How are we going to get the last two things,” Harry complains as he turns away from the bookshelves to face them from where he had picked up the first six items.</p>
<p><br/> “Well, I might have a time turner hidden away from third year.” Hermione sheepishly tells them before continuing with, “And I think I know a way to disguise human blood as unicorn blood long enough for the ritual to work.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“And what do we need to do that?” Ron questions her.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“A pint and a half of virgins blood,” Hermione said turning to face Harry.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><br/> “Why are you looking at me!?!” Harry says voice going slightly high at the end of the sentence. He looks around to find who she referring to.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rolling her eyes Hermione informs him, “Harry me and Ron have been married a year and a half now and you've only really dated Ginny and she has told me she wants to wait until you guys are married before doing anything. If you want to do this you are the only virgin among us.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Shoulders slumping he grabs his wand and conjures a jar and a knife. Adding measurement markers on the side of it he cuts his forearm sideways and lets the blood start to fill the jar.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>While waiting for the blood to drip enough to fill the jar, Hermione goes into the bedroom, coming back with the time turner. Then she waits as Ron moves all the furniture to the edges of the room. Walking to the coffee table where the rest of the ingredients are Hermione kneels next to the table and summons a cutting board from the kitchen along with a potions knife.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Slicing up the ingredients into small bits she pours them into a shallow bowl before breaking open the time turner and pouring the sand into the bowl as well. Mixing the ingredients together she casts a small spell on the contents of the bowl, putting them in stasis before she asked loudly, “What age should we go back too?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Not saying anything the three of them think this over before Ron says, ”11 maybe start right from the beginning?” Thinking this over the other two agree with his suggestion.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A few minutes later, Harry casts a healing spell on the cut before grabbing the jar and moves over to Hermione to hand it over to her, thanking Harry softly she mutters a spell aimed at the blood. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Watching as the blood flashes a soft white she nods decisively before she stops the stasis spell, then pours the blood carefully into the bowl watching as it flashes white again well mixing. When the color had faded back into red she stands and moves into the open space Ron had cleared and carefully pours the contents of the bowl out walking in a circle. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>After the mixture had conformed to the necessary shape on it's own flashing white once again she sets the bowl down on the coffee table and tells the men, “We need to stand in the circle.” Stepping into the circle Hermione grabs both of their hands in her own before she chants, “Mitte nos retrorsum: Venite figere nostra praeterita, ut futura creare novum.” They have to close their eyes against the bright white light that flares up from the circle. </p>
