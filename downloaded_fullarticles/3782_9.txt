    <p>Harry was quick to discover that being the King of the Magical world didn't just mean that he got to have everyone in the world (magical, anyways) listen to him and actually do what he said, <em>when</em> he said it. There was a mountain of paperwork that went with it that needed his attention when he returned and had settled into his new role. Unfortunately, that mountain of parchment was just Great Britain's pile, take into consideration almost every other country and he was almost drowning in it all.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sirius, being one of the brightest students of his year back in the day, was a great help for him, when it came to some of the paperwork, but that still didn't lower the tower of parchment to a more manageable height. Harry had a horrible feeling that it was going to take him almost five years just to take care of <em>half </em>the pile.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“This is too much.” said Harry groaning and sitting back in his chair, tossing a quill down on the large cherry wood desk. The desk was amazingly sturdy and smooth, and the chair that he sat in was comfortable and supportive, but it didn't stop him from being almost completely drained after sitting for countless hours at a time. “I haven't even <em>touched </em>the other countries...let alone species! How did Meandenbor manage to do all this before he died?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“He must have had some tricks of his own...the man was king for Merlin knows how long.” Sirius looked over the paperwork before him. “This reminds me of all the work my father had to do being the Patriarch of the Black family, I never saw the man much, thank goodness for small favors...but that's not what we want to happen to you.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>They sat in silence as they took a short break, Harry was slouching heavily in his chair and rolling his shoulders languidly. He wanted to get away from the desk and walk around, but if he had this much work, he couldn't without feeling a little guilty. Then Sirius' voice broke through his thoughts. “Now that I think about it, you know who would be a big help with all of this?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Percy?” asked Harry with a snicker, that was the first person that came to his mind when he saw all this paperwork.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He had never seen anyone love a report more than Percy, not even Hermione. Percy had always been the one person that he could count on to be punctual, organized and very efficient. While he was unable to wrangle in his younger twin brothers, he still managed to keep the other Gryffindor students on a tight schedule with classes. Gryffindors were easily the most rambunctious house, but they were almost always on time. His bag was always neat as a pin and his homework would be handed in crisp, clean and completed to the fullest extent, with no wiggle room for sub-par work.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Actually, that's <em>exactly </em>who I was thinking. I may not have met the lad and I've heard less than flattering things about him from his brothers and sister...but if what Molly said was right, he has a natural knack for paperwork.” said Sirius with a thoughtful smile. “Also, you could divvy this all up into different categories and have other people help you, not <em>just </em>Percy.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Hmm.” Harry looked down at the paperwork before him, he <em>could </em>use the help. Hell, he would <em>beg </em>for help if it came to that. This was all too much for him to do, especially at his age and his young attention span when it came to work on paper, especially after months and months of being on the road and being on the best adventure of his life. He was getting restless sitting behind the desk all day, barely had enough time to walk about and stretch his legs and explore his new home, and he still was finding new rooms every time he left his office. He wanted to do a good job, but he also wanted a change of scenery every once in a while, the office was nice and cozy, but the view was getting a mite old.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“This is also me being subtle and telling you that we need to tell the others that we're both back in our world.” said Sirius with a cheeky smile. He quickly dodged one of the cushions his godson had thrown at him. “Ah, ah, ah, that was not a very regal attitude!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I'll give you regal.” said Harry with a smirk.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>True, Harry missed them all and wanted to see them again, but he just couldn't get away from doing all this paper work,...he had just enough free time lately to bathe, though it took him almost two hours of scrubbing with scented soap to start smelling...more civilized. He also had made a bit of time getting Will-O-Wisp settled in her stable, (which she now shared with a two dozen winged horses that he didn't even knew he was now the proud owner of) getting to know all the House-elves in Castle Valor, and managing all the paperwork that lay before him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There was just no time to do anything else, and there still was no time.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“If you want to go and get them, that's fine...and if I remember, you were telling me that you guys were watching over me while I was “sleeping”, I'm pretty sure that they're freaking out over an empty bed right now.” said Harry. “So seeing you back ought to be a bit of a comfort.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Aye, Remus at the very least will be freaking out. He may dress like a hungover Irishman, but if he doesn't have certain things squared away in a certain order, he tends to go a bit mad. He'd be a good idea for secretary too, if only his penmanship wasn't so horrible. But he does love to keep things in a certain order, your nursery and the hall closet was always neat as a pin whenever he came over to visit Lily and James, explains why James kept inviting him now that I think about it. Prongs hated to clean with a passion.” said Sirius with a fond smile as he thought back to the old days.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Seeing as our hair stands up like I live in a tornado, that's not surprising.” said Harry with a snicker, he stopped when Sirius gave the top of his head a appraising look. “What?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Have you...seen yourself lately? I mean...seen yourself, in a mirror.” said Sirius looking at Harry with a smile.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry blinked a few times, and shook his head. “No...not really...should I have? There's not that many mirrors in Arda.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sirius took out his wand, (amazingly, both Harry's and Sirius' wands were waiting on a table when they arrived in the castle's throne room) and conjured up a mirror on Harry's desk. “You may want to have a bit of a look-see.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry picked up and stared at the reflection in the mirror.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The last time he had actually seen his reflection was far back in Lothlorien, as men in both Rohan and Gondor did not waste time checking how they appeared in a reflective surface and there he saw that his hair was getting a bit longer. His hair, once short and stuck up all over the place was now long enough to go down just past shoulder blades and had a windswept look. His once pale skin was now a healthy tan and he was now at least a half a foot taller than he was when he went on that crazy adventure. He didn't even realize till now that he was still without glasses, and he didn't even need them. He didn't have an undernourished look to him anymore but now had a lean slightly muscular build. It was as if he was now a totally different person, with a completely different past, but the scar was still there...so that part of his past was still visibly present.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Wow...” said Harry as he turned his head from side to side. “That's...different.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I know right? All I saw was the color of your hair and the eyes, and I knew it was you. Didn't dawn on me that you changed that much.” said Sirius with a smirk. “But yeah, you grew up, my little cub grew up...” he added with a fond look at Harry.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry looked up at Sirius with a smile. “Never thought this would happen. I had figured on dying before I could even...well...I didn't think I would survive Voldemort to be honest.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“And you did, you survived him and you got something he could never have, a world where people want you.” said Sirius with a careful tone. “And a world that would be crushed if something awful were to happen to you.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Two, actually, that are of that opinion it seems.” said Harry as he looked at a the map of Middle Earth hanging on the wall.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-</p>
<p>While Sirius went out and gathered up everyone that was at Headquarters to bring them back to Castle Valor, Harry decided to take a break and sleep a bit, revel in the time off. He had been running himself ragged and was not taking very long to rest or even sit down to really eat. Without Sirius there, he figured that he could finally take a bit of time for himself.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He walked into his chambers, disregarded the comfortable couch and armchairs before the fire or even the seats on the shaded balcony and collapsed onto his bed without changing out of his clothes. It was only moments later that he was fast asleep, sinking slowly into the plush mattress, a luxury that he hadn't had for months.</p>
<p>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-</p>
<p>Sirius was starting to get a mite irritated, it was taking all sorts of coaxing and promises to explain <em>everything </em>once they got back to the castle for them to even get them down in front of the front door. But they were all just interrogating him left and right about where he went, where Harry was and how did he come back, and they were barely giving him the time to answer their questions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And the surprising thing was, it was Hagrid that was the most vocal, instead of Hermione.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Where did ya go? Ya didn't even leave me a note sayin' yeh were takin off! I thought someone had gotten in and took yeh by accident and were aimin' fer Harry!” shouted Hagrid shaking his finger at Sirius angrily. “Now yeh say yeh was with 'im all this time?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Not the whole time Hagrid, not until the very end. It took me a long time to get to him.” said Sirius holding up his hands in submission. “I didn't meant to go, and I had no choice in the matter, Meandenbor kidnapped me and took me to wherever the heck Harry was...well...at least a rough area of it...”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“But how did Harry's body disappear? Where did he go?” asked Hermione quickly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“It must have...merged with him when he came back, I don't know, I don't really care...let's just go to Castle Valor so you can talk to him.” said Sirius. This was the seventh attempt for him to get the rest of them out into the carriages that were waiting for them outside. None of them seemed to be willing to move very fast towards the front door.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Doesn't Castle Valor move in the sky? How are we going to find it again?” asked Ginny as brought her mother her cloak, she was eager to see Harry, but she too had some questions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I got here in one of the...I suppose they're the 'Royal Carriages', they can take anyone to and from Castle Valor. They can find the castle no matter how long they've been gone.” said Sirius. “Or at least that's what Chippy said when I asked to take one.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Who's Chippy?” asked Ron curiously.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Chippy is one of the House-elves at the castle, she and her family have been serving Castle Valor for centuries.” said Sirius matter of factly, though he was starting to get a bit dizzy from all the questions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hermione immediately began to growl.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Oh no...come on Hermione, lighten up.” said Ron looking pointedly at the Gryffindor Prefect. “So...is lunch going to be provided?” he said looking at Sirius who laughed out loud.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As they gazed out the windows of the carriage they all gasped when the glorious view of Castle Valor came into view from behind a cloud bank. Dumbledore had to admit, it looked much better and less intimidating in the bright sunshine than it did it the freezing cold rain.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The towers and turrets were standing imperiously over it's cloud-based kingdom, and despite it's heavenly position, there was a massive garden on all sides of the castle, with trees, flowers, fountains and small rivers of flowing water going from one corner of the castle to the other. They could see birds travel from one tree to another, twittering away happily.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A storybook castle, hidden among the clouds.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Where are we?” asked Ron staring transfixed at the scene below them. “Is this...”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“It is indeed, this is Castle Valor.” said Dumbledore in a whisper.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Harry's castle.” said Sirius with a smile.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Harry's...?” said Hermione startled, she didn't figure he would take it, preferring to stay out of the spotlight and perhaps he was just staying there for the time being, perhaps wounded or just tired. “You mean he took the crown, he really took it? I thought he wasd just meeting us or here, or...”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“No, he chose to take the crown...and boy...can he <em>use</em> it.” said Sirius with a smirk at he thought of that final day in that strange world. “Voldemort didn't stand a chance...”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“What do you mean?” asked Bill.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You-Know-Who's dead?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“But we thought he just disappeared!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Harry really defeated him?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“He'll tell you all about it, hopefully not over lunch...that story would put <em>Ron</em> off eating.” said Sirius with a wink over to Ron.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Challenge accepted!” said Fred and George together.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Nothing and we mean NOTHING can stop Ron from eating.” said Fred.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“'Cept spiders...there's no spiders involved is there?” said George.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“No...” said Sirius with a quirk of his brow.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Challenge accepted then.” said Ron with a smile.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Yeah, but I would like to have a decent meal in there somewhere.” said Sirius. “So...no...not today”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The carriage landed softly before the large doors of Castle Valor and before they could get out and marvel at the sight and intimidating size of the castle, a small house-elf with bright blue eyes and a short button nose came out of the large doors. It was wearing a toga of rich gold and red fabric, which, in contrast to Kreacher who they had had constant contact with in Grimmauld Place, was absolutely sterile and perfectly pressed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I'm sorry Misses and Sirs, but the King is resting, the King cannot see you today.” said the elf squeakily. “Please come back another day.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Chippy, it's me, remember?” said Sirius coming forward from behind the crowd. “These are Harry's...err...Fainasinqui's friends...”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Fain what?” said Bill looking round at Sirius as Chippy curtsied.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Long story, Bill. We'll be quiet and not disturb him, Chippy, but when he wakes up, could you tell him we'll be waiting outside?” said Sirius. “In the...what garden has those fish swimming in the pond?” said Sirius looking around the gardens. “And all the fruit trees?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“The east garden, Mr. Sirius, would Mr. Sirius and company like refreshments?” said Chippy curtsying again.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Yes, that would be nice, and uh...have all the bags taken into the hall by the stairs, Har....Fainasinqui'll divvy up the rooms later I suppose.” said Sirius. “Merlin, that name's going to take some getting used to. I wish they knew who I was talking about when I say Harry, but he hasn't had the time to tell them to call him Harry yet...not a whole lot of time to tell them anything much.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I would like to know where <em>did</em> that name come from?” asked Dumbledore as they wandered to the eastern garden. “I've never heard of a name like that, quite exotic.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“That and it has more letters than Dumbledore's own name.” muttered Ron.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I'm going to let Harry tell you, he had more interaction with the people that gave him the name then I did.” said Sirius. “I really only interacted with three people for the most part...those guys were fun, one was a right pain in my ass though.” he added with a smirk.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As they followed Sirius around the perimeter of the castle, they marveled at the lush gardens of Castle Valor. There seemed to be an endless amount of flora surrounding the castle and quite a few animals living in the vast gardens. As they looked around, they finally reached the eastern garden and the sight made them pause and stare.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Instead of the diverse plants that the front garden possessed, the eastern garden was full of tress full of bright pink cherry blossoms or fruit, fountains of various styles bubbling over with water, and several ponds of brightly colored fish.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sirius led them over to a gathering of tables and chairs, where a ample lunch was waiting for them.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“So....what happened with you all while we were gone?” said Sirius taking a sandwich and sitting down.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hermione and Ron looked at the Animagus in disbelief. “Really? You think <em>your </em>story isn't more important right now?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I saw that Grimmauld Place had spell damage done to the outside of it.” said Sirius. “<em>I </em>want to know what happened to <em>my</em> house. You tell me about what happened while I was gone, and I'll tell you all about my adventures, though they don't even come close to measuring up to Harry's.”</p>
<p>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-</p>
<p>Harry continued to sleep on, he was so tired and the bed was so soft and his dreams were pleasant. Not one of them had anything to do with the crown that was now upon his brow, but had a certain blonde kept fluttering in and out.</p>
