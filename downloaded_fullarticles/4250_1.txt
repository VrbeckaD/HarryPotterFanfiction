    <p>"Come on Harry! We're gonna miss our ride to The Hotel!" </p><p>Harry looked over to his dear friend of six years Hermoine Granger as she waved her hand over his face. "Seriously Harry, now isn't the time to be zoning out." </p><p>"Sorry 'Moine, just a bit tired you know?" "Yes, well we still need to be going. At this rate we'll never catch up with Ron and The twins." Harry nodded as he grabbed his suit cases and headed towards the exit.</p><p>They had both just arrived in Korea for relocating due to the war. After Dumbledore's death the ministry decided the best action would be to hide the few that could defeat Voldemort while everyone else was busy trying to protect the school and it's students. </p><p>Why they chose Korea, Harry would never really understand. The only reason he could think of is they have good food.</p>
