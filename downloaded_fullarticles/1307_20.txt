    <p>The pity hung heavily in the air. Cassie could feel it in the look that Dumbledore gave her over the rim of his half-moon glasses. She fiddled nervously with a blonde curl, wrapping and unwrapping it from around her finger. The scar that spread web-like across her right shoulder was tingling slightly and she was desperately resisting the urge to scratch at it.</p><p>“I have to say, Miss Fawley, that I am very glad you decided to re-join us for this school year.”</p><p>Cassie pursed her lips slightly. “No offence Professor, but I’m still not sure it’s a good idea.”</p><p>Dumbledore leant forwards in his chair and touched the tips of his fingertips together thoughtfully.</p><p>“You know we will make every provision possible to ensure you are able to continue this year in relative comfort. Your situation is unfortunate, but I see no reason you should have to miss out on what is undeniably the most important part of your school career so far.”</p><p>“Because, Professor, my education shouldn’t come before the safety of others.” Cassie explained, slightly exasperated. This was an argument they had been having for the last fortnight, first when Dumbledore had shown up unexpectedly to her house a couple of days after the attack and then back and forth by letter since then. Even though Cassie was convinced that she was right, that her being back at Hogwarts was a huge mistake, she had discovered that Dumbledore was an incredibly frustrating person to argue with. Eventually she'd given in and agreed to return, but that was before her first experience of a full moon last night. It had taken her father physically dragging her to the Hogwarts Express to get her to the school at all.</p><p>“You are not a danger to anyone merely by being present, Miss Fawley.” smiled Dumbledore benignly. “And I’ve asked you in here today to explain the arrangements I’ve been making for you these past few weeks.” There was a knock on the door, and Dumbledore leant back in his chair. “Ah, wonderful.”</p><p>Professor Snape swept into the headmaster’s office, looking even more sour in the mouth than usual. He was followed by a tired looking wizard whom Cassie didn’t recognise, with worn robes and a set of fine silvery scars across his face.</p><p>“Severus, Remus, immaculately timed. I was just explaining the arrangements that we have put in place for Miss Fawley this year.”</p><p>Snape scowled, as if his being there was a waste of his precious time. The other wizard, Remus, gave her a small encouraging smile and nodded genially as Dumbledore began to outline the plans.</p><p>“Professor Snape here has agreed to brew the Wolfsbane necessary to make the full moon somewhat easier for you.”</p><p>Snape surveyed her disdainfully. “You will come to my office at prearranged times during the week before the full moon. The Headmaster has indicated that, as you have proven yourself not entirely incompetent when it comes to Potions,” – he said this with a sneer that betrayed exactly how he felt about her so-called talent – “you may wish to learn how to brew the Wolfsbane yourself. It is not an easy potion, but I suppose it cannot waste more than the contents of my stock cupboard and my time to attempt.”</p><p>Dumbledore nodded pleasantly. “You may go now Severus.”</p><p>Snape gave a curt nod and stalked out of the office. Cassie noticed that he cast a dark glance in the direction of the other wizard before the door shut behind him.</p><p>“And this is Professor Lupin, our newly appointed Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher. He has agreed to mentor you this year, providing moral support and a sympathetic ear. Your situation is somewhat an area of expertise for him.” Dumbledore chuckled at some unshared joke.</p><p>Lupin stepped forwards. “I was thinking we could maybe have tea in my office after the feast. Talk things over, make arrangements, that sort of thing.”</p><p>“I'm not staying.” she said firmly.</p><p>The two professors glanced at each other.</p><p>“Stay for dinner.” Lupin offered. “And then come and meet me in my office. We can decide on the best course of action then.”</p><p>Cassie hesitated, sorely tempted to refuse and leave at that moment. She got the feeling, however, that tea with Professor Lupin was the minimal requirement for a peaceful solution, so she nodded.</p><p>Dumbledore stood and began snuffing out his candles with a wave of his hand.</p><p>“Excellent. Now that that’s all arranged, I think we should make our ways down to the feast. Your friends will no doubt be waiting to discuss the joys the holidays have held for each of you.”</p><p>Cassie got the feeling that was a pointed comment aimed at her.</p><p align="center">****</p><p>“You alright Cass?” Izzy asked, nudging her with a bony elbow.</p><p>“Mmm? Yeah. Just didn’t sleep well last night.”</p><p>“Or for the last year, by the looks of it. You’re ill.” Izzy turned to Amy, who was examining her fingernails. “She looks ill. Doesn’t she look ill?”</p><p>“You’re mothering, Izzy.” Amy said.</p><p>“You could at least pretend to be concerned.”</p><p>“I’m hungry, okay?” Amy replied irritably. “They’re running late.”</p><p>“It was those Dementors.” Izzy said, shuddering slightly at the memory. “Merlin, those things were awful. Remind me never to commit a crime so I don’t have to ever meet another one.”</p><p>“Dunno why they had to come into the carriages.” said Amy. “Do they really think one of us would be stowing Black away?”</p><p>“Hiding him in the luggage rack.” Cassie offered with a wry smile.</p><p>“There we go.” Amy said, elbowing Cassie gently in the ribs. “She’s returned to the land of the living. Told you she was fine.”</p><p>“Speaking of, where were you on the train?” asked Izzy “We waited in our spot on the platform, but you weren’t there.”</p><p>She was right; Cassie had avoided their usual meeting point, hoping to delay the moment when she had to face her friends and tell them what had happened to her over the summer. It had been easy enough on the train, because the three had occupied the same carriage on the Hogwarts Express since first year. Izzy, a loud and gangly bespectacled girl dressed head to toe in black, and Amy, round faced and wearing white ankle socks with a little flower on them, had got into a fight over who would get the window seat and Cassie had been forced to play peacekeeper. Nothing much had changed in the six years that had passed, except that Izzy shouted a little less now and Amy had grown out of ankle socks.</p><p>“I...I was running late, only just got on before it left, and then my trunk burst open, and hinkypunk bile went <em>everywhere</em>, all over Pansy Parkinson’s trunk, and you know what a little shit she is, that really wasn’t an argument I wanted to have, so I spent most of the journey scrubbing it up, and there was this one bit that just got all over my Potions essay and wouldn’t come out even with my strongest scourging spell, and Snape would kill me if I handed it in covered in bile, and then I spent the rest of the time trying to stuff everything back into my trunk. And then the Dementors came and started sniffing around the luggage rack and that was nasty ‘cos I think they thought I was stealing something from Parkinson’s case, had to be rescued by the conductor. He was lovely, made me tea and everything, and then we pulled in to Hogsmeade and I only just got the last carriage up and I think Dumbledore’s speaking now.”</p><p>She said all of that very rapidly, hoping that they would stop listening and silently thanked the Headmaster for getting up when he did because she was very rapidly running out of lies. Amy shrugged and turned her attention to the front, but Izzy gave her a severe look for a moment before doing the same. Cassie tried to convince herself that that was just Izzy’s general expression, but didn’t quite manage it.</p><p>“Even the gravest business comes second to the happiness of reuniting with old friends and the joy of welcoming new ones.” said Dumbledore jovially. “So now we have hopefully done plenty of the former, it is now time to do the latter. So if you will do the honours, Professor McGonagall?”</p><p>McGonagall marched the line of first years up the centre of the hall, each of them with the same awe struck look that every new batch had. When the Sorting Hat was revealed to dumstruck expressions Cassie smiled, remembering a similar expression on some of her classmates’ faces when they had first seen it too. She hadn’t been surprised though, because she had been coached through every step of the ceremony by her parents and was as prepared as humanly possible to follow in her family’s footsteps and become the newest Fawley Slytherin.</p><p>Amy was obviously thinking along the same lines as her, because she nudged Cassie as the Sorting Hat began its song and mouthed “Remember ours?”</p><p>Cassie nodded, and Izzy turned around and whispered “It’s weird. Six years ago this was us, now this the last one we’ll ever see.”</p><p>Amy sighed dramatically. “We’re so old.”</p><p>“That we are.”</p><p>“I can hardly remember when you were that size. Little Cassiopeia Fawley.”</p><p>Cassie winced at the use of her full name. Her mother had insisted on it; apparently it was traditional in their family. Cassie always imagined generations of Cassiopeia’s stretching back across the ages, all despising their name.</p><p>“I do remember that you were crying.” added Amy.</p><p>“‘Course I was crying. I thought my parents were going to kill me.” Cassie subconsciously adjusted her tie, the yellow and black stripes very different from the green and silver she had been expecting. “Our sorting was the start of the tradition of me being the family disappointment.”</p><p>Her stomach dropped as she remembered the new, extra-special way in which she was disgracing her parents, but the others didn’t seem to notice.</p><p>Amy raised her glass in a toast “To the family disappointment!” and was promptly shushed by Izzy and Penelope Clearwater at the same time. She pulled a face at Izzy’s back, but Cassie only managed a weak smile. She had managed to forget everything for a while, enjoying being in the company of her friends again. Now she was just dreading being in the common room that evening, when distractions from the truth would be harder to come by.</p><p>Tea with Professor Lupin was also an unappealing prospect. She glanced at him at the teacher’s table where he was singing merrily along with the school song. He caught her eye and smiled warmly, but she looked away quickly.</p><p>Dumbledore stood again and smiled out at the hall. “Welcome! Welcome to another year at Hogwarts! I have a few things to say to you all, and as one of them is very serious, I think it best to get it out of the way before you become befuddled by our excellent feast.” His expression became sombre. “As you will all be aware after their search of the Hogwarts Express, our school is presently playing host to some of the Dementors of Azkaban, who are currently here on Ministry of Magic business. They are stationed at every entrance of the grounds, and while they are with us, I must make it plain that nobody is to leave school without permission. Dementors are not to be fooled by tricks or disguises – or even Invisibility Cloaks. It is not in the nature of a Dementor to understand pleading or excuses. I therefore warn each and every one of you to give them no reason to harm you. I look to the Prefects, and our new head Boy and Girl, to make sure that no student runs foul of the Dementors.”</p><p>There was a long pause after this announcement, and the hall was quieter than Cassie ever remembered it being before.</p><p>“On a happier note,” Dumbledore continued, his tone suddenly brighter “I am pleased to welcome two new teachers to our ranks this year. Firstly, Professor Lupin, who has kindly consented to fill the post of Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher.”</p><p>There was a smattering of applause throughout the hall. Izzy lent over and whispered “He’s a bit shabby, isn’t he?”</p><p>“I think he’s cute.” Amy said. “Like, scruffy-chic.”</p><p>“That’s not a thing, Amy.”</p><p>“Is too.”</p><p>In an attempt to prevent an argument and also seeing an opportunity to explain her planned absence that evening, Cassie announced “He’s nice. He said he wanted to talk to me later, y’know, about the Dementor thing that happened on the train. I think he just wants to check I’m okay.”</p><p>“Aw, that’s sweet.” Amy said, and apart from that her meeting with Lupin passed without comment and attention was returned to Dumbledore.</p><p>“As to our second new appointment, well, I am sorry to tell you that Professor Kettleburn, our Care of Magical Creatures teacher, retired at the end of last year in order to enjoy more time with his remaining limbs.”</p><p>There was a general sigh of discontent, particularly amongst the seventh years who took the subject with Cassie. They were very fond of Professor Kettleburn, even if his lack of fingers and the chunk of his face that was missing were slightly disturbing.</p><p>“However, I am delighted to say that his place will be filled by none other than Rubeus Hagrid, who has agreed to take on this teaching job in addition to his gamekeeping duties.”</p><p>The disappointment at Kettleburn’s retirement was replaced by enthusiastic applause. Hagrid was well liked by everyone except the particularly snobby pure-bloods, but no-one paid attention to their disgusted looks at this news.</p><p>“Well, I think that’s everything of importance. Let the feast begin!”</p><p>Food appeared on the golden platters on the table and everyone begun to tuck in. Cassie, however, merely picked at a chicken leg and pushed some pasta salad around her plate.</p><p>“Aren’t you hungry?” Amy asked.</p><p>“Not really.”</p><p>Izzy scowled at her. “I’m telling you, you’re ill.”</p><p>“Thank you for the observation Izzy. I’ll make a note of it.”</p><p>“You should eat as much as you can.” said Amy, tucking into her stew and dumplings. “This is the last welcome feast we’ll ever have!”</p><p>“Are you going to be doing that all year?” Izzy asked irritably. “Because there’s a lot of lasts this year. Last Halloween, last Hogsmeade visit, last time we’ll walk down the bloody Charms corridor…”</p><p>“You bet.”</p><p>Izzy groaned and stabbed at her lasagne.</p>
