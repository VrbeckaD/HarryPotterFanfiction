Other than the one from the original author </p>
<p>7 years later, after the war with voldemort. Twenty-five and a half years old Harry James Potter bids his farewell to his childhood (classmate) friend from Hogwarts as the three golden trios had their group hug.</p>
<p> Harry had decided after 7 years that he wanted to retired and moved out of England out of the Wizard world and wanted to start a new life as just Harry Potter, a normal human being instead of being the most powerful wizard.</p>
<p>He bids his farewell to both Hermione and Ron.</p>
<p> Hermione who was now married to Theodore Nott and had three children with him, two son, Remus Theor Nott (the eldest son) and Hermson Lyle Nott (the youngest son) and a daughter named Helenia Rose Nott. Her relationship with Ron didn’t last long, but the two had stay friend despite their past relationship as boyfriend and Girlfriend. </p>
<p>Ron who was now also married and had four children with Luna Lovegood who was now Luna Weasley had two son and two daughters. </p>
<p>While Fred and George who were now a married man and had each 2 children of their own, even Percy Weasley and Billy Weasley too were married as well and had each 3 children of their own with their respective wife.</p>
<p>He even gave a farewell hug to Ginny Weasley who was now Ginny Longbottom, both him and Ginny had broken up after the whole war with Voldemort were over two years later, and the whole family and the wizarding world had expected Harry to finally get back together with Ginny. A year before the final battle, Harry would have expected it as well. However, they have both changed a lot.</p>
<p>During the year where he was constantly on the run, escaping from Voldermort's clutches, being tortured to near insanity and finally walking to his death, had changed Harry so much that he did not think he could even imagine a life with Ginny anymore. The young man felt so weary to his bones that the idea of taking care of someone else made him feel distinctly unhappy.</p>
<p>After years of service to a world that did not respect him or his privacy at all, all Harry wanted was to disappear into someone's arms and have them protect him instead.</p>
<p>With Ginny, he would be the one who was supposed to take care of her, to love and protect her. Harry just could not do it anymore. Not even the fear that the Weasleys may shun him for his decision could force him to get back with Ginny. Ginny was a strong woman. She had shown her strength time and again.</p>
<p>Harry truly respected her for that but he did not think he could lead a life with her. They had sat down and Harry had tried hard to put his feelings into words. They had talked for hours and Ginny had finally smiled sadly and told him not to worry about it. The war had changed all of them. Though she still loved Harry and she knew Harry still loved, he was no longer in love with her. Ginny knew that even if she forced him to marry her, they would never be happy.</p>
<p>After everything Harry had given up, she could not in good conscious tie Harry to her.</p>
<p>They had broken the news to her family and weathered the fallout that followed the news. The older Weasleys had accepted the news without much protest. Ron and Hermoine were a bit put out but they knew from the look in Harry's eyes that he was serious about the decision.</p>
<p>Arthur Weasley had calmly accepted their decision. It was Molly who could not accept the news. She tried talking to Harry many times, trying to convince him to let go of the past and accept his feelings for Ginny.</p>
<p>The first few times, Harry had listened to her as calmly as he could before shaking his head and leaving. However as the pressures of rebuilding the wizarding world fell even more heavily on his shoulders, Harry did not have the strength to fight against Molly so he started to limit his visits to the Burrow and only met his friends separately outside.</p>
<p>Ginny had finally had enough and told her mother she was seeing someone, which happen to be Neville Longbottom, and even told her mother that the two of them were planning to get married soon, once everything was settle down. Once her daughter had made up her mind, Molly was forced to stop forcing the two together again.</p>
<p>But after a few more years, one years later as both Neville and Ginny had finally settle down and got married, her mother did forget and move on about pinning him and Ginny together, then another year later, Ginny give birth to her and Neville first child, a boy they named Jarrison Harry Longbottom.</p>
<p>Harry don’t know whether to be proud that his two friend had named their first child after him, or concern over it for the fear and concern over Ginny who might still not get over their break up. But after seeing the genius smile that the young woman who is now a mother of her own? He knows at the moment that he didn’t need to worry about anything.</p>
<p>He even hugged Draco Malfoy a farewell hug, his ex-lover, after his break up with Ginny years ago who he, well mostly they both had ended their relationship after the whole orderly with dealing with the media and their threat, and their relationship didn’t really have any good setting and healthy, not that they didn’t have their ups and down during their time together as a couple those years ago of being boyfriends.</p>
<p>Where now married to Astoria Greengrass who were now Astoria Malfoy, thought their few short relationships of 3 year did end up with a result of a child, to which was both Harry and Draco first child, a baby boy who they both named Scorpius Draconius who was born when Harry was at the age of 21.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Not that Harry was surprised at first when he found out that male wizard were able to get pregnant but happy all the same since it means that he could have the family he also wanted to have, thought that dream almost came true if it wasn’t for this whole argument about the who the child should rightfully belonged too.</p>
<p>The child was now in the hand of his father (Draco) after the trill and fight for the hand and right with their son? Scorpius for Harry sadly news to be parted with his first child were now with his father, after all Draco is the rightful father of the child and not to mention that the child was a replica a mini version of his father from both look down and ups to the hair and gene, expect for Scorpius’s eyes which the child inheritance his green eyes.</p>
<p>He didn’t even won the right to win his child, not when both the child parent weren’t even married, so the child was handed down to Draco, since the boy was rightfully the father’s illegitimate child. Much to Lucious Malfoy dismay that his grandson had come out of wedlock, but Harry did get the chance of raising his son till Scorpius turned 3 years old at which Draco demanded him to hand the child over to him when he found out about the boy, that he had had a child with him.</p>
<p>The two did have a heated fight (argument), but in the end Scorpius ended up living with Draco and was now a ‘Malfoy’ instead of ‘Potter’. But Draco wasn’t that harsh to not let the child have the right to talk to his biological mother (Harry). Harry  was allowed to see and spend his time with his child every weekend.</p>
<p>Draco even allowed the boy to continue and still have some sort of connection to his biological mother, via sending owl letters and email letter despite to Draco’s hatred for muggle technology whenever the child wanted to. The child, their son, Scorpius was going to turn 5 years old this coming August 10..</p>
<p>Harry then bent down to be level with his son Scorpius who was now whimpering and crying silently beside his father (Draco). Harry smiled softly at the sight of his first child and hugged the boy at which the child hugged back, tightly.</p>
<p>“M-Mama! I don’t want you to go! Why do you have to go and move out of the country? D-don’t you want to see me anymore every weekend?” The child asked to which shocked Harry as he hugged his son closer to him.</p>
<p>“No, I would never, not want to see you? Of course not. I love you too much to stay away from you, you were my first child, and I will always love you.” Harry said.</p>
<p>“T-Then why?” The child asked. Harry thought of it for a moment before saying.  “Mama.. Just need some time off, a sort of vacation, but I’ll be back after maybe 3 or 5 months?” Harry said.</p>
<p>Though he didn’t want to tell the child the truth about the bad news that the reason why he wanted to go somewhere else, was the reason that he need a new start, a new beginning to start his life and to move on from the whole wizarding world, about Ginny, about his past relationship with Draco who he still hasn't gotten over.</p>
<p>Thought he would never forget to come back here in England once in a while to visit and see his son, he didn’t want to miss his son as the boy grows up. So he had planned to come back here every 3 or maybe 5 month, beside he promise himself to be there for on his son’s every birthday, and Christmas too, if Draco allowed him to, before he goes back to the place he going to permanently live with, which was in America (Gotham).</p>
<p>The child had gotten used to calling Harry Mama, not that Harry wasn't the childs biological mother who gave birth to him. Thought Harry didn’t mind it, in fact he kind of felt proud about it, to be called mama by his child, it was the only proof that he was the first to give birth to the new head of the Malfoy, he kind of liked to rubbed it on Astoria’s face, and liked to show her that he was the first person to have been knocked up first by the great Draco Malfoy.</p>
<p>Astoria hated it, that the fact that he was the first person to ever give Draco his first heir, a son no less, and it’s wasn’t a happy news at all, after all to whoever had been first knocked up by Draco and had given birth to a baby boy was a heir to the Malfoy’s bloodline, where a proof that Astoria ’s child, or to whichever gender of a child that she would give birth to Draco would never have the right to own the Malfoy’s family fortune. To the wizarding world, a first child will always be the one to have the have the right to own the family fortune, after all a first child is the very first that very been born from the family, same thing that apply to an only child.</p>
<p>The second child would only inheritance a few things, or would only inheritance the mother’s side of the family fortune and not the father’s side of family fortune. After all, a second child will always be the second place in everything, unlike the first child who will have everything and the first to own the family fortune.</p>
<p>“You promise to come back for me every 3 or five months, mama?” Scorpius asked as Harry smiled softly at his son and nodded his head.</p>
<p>“Yes. I promise. Now stop crying and give me that genius smile, that I love the most. Mama won’t be happy to be seen off with that frowned and upset expression that graces your cute, handsome face, love.. And Mama will promise to call you on your cellphone when I get to America, okay?.” Harry said playfully.</p>
<p>The boy indeed stopped crying as the child wiped his tears from his cute and handsome face and nodded in agreement with his mother.</p>
<p>‘He looked like a cute child version of Draco, merlin! If I didn’t know that Draco can be this cute as a child. Then I’m proud to say myself for being the one to give Draco’s a son, his junior.’ Harry thought as he smiled down at his son before leaning in and kissed the boy’s forehead before getting up just on time as the announcement of his flight were about to board.</p>
<p>“Well, looks like my plane is here.” Harry said as he turned to face his friends, family and ex-lover and son with a smile as he adjusted his hand bag before bbidding them one last goodbye before he walk away boarded his plane.</p>
<p>-0-</p>
<p>When his plane finally arrive in America as he got off and took a connecting travel bus that was heading toward Gotham City. When the travel bus stopped to the bus station as he got off, took a taxi to head to his hotel for the meantime. When he was finally settle in his hotel room as he began to unpack his stuff and cloths and put them all in their cabin, by using his magic of course, after all no one could see what he was doing inside his hotel room, beside the curtains were all closed  so that nobody would caught him doing magic from outside his window.</p>
<p>When he was done packing, he settled down on the couch, turned on the TV while grabbing a newspaper He snorted at the headline of the newspaper. About a scandalous info about a rich playboy who goes by the name of one ‘Bruce Wayne’ who was planning to open a new company somewhere in Florida and New York again and was also planning to build a ‘Wayne’ company in England as well in the future.</p>
<p>‘Hmph! Great just what I need a billionaire playboy. Almost sound just like what Draco would do with his money!.’ He snorted, thought he did find that this ‘Bruce Wayne’ was indeed handsome, good looking, and very muscular, more muscular than Draco medium body built. This Bruce Wayne’s body where built like a tank, all muscular and brain.</p>
<p>He twitched his nose as he toasted the newspaper to the table as he snatched the remote control and switched a channel, which happen to be the America’s TV news channel. He lowers the remote control and watch and listens to the news report.</p>
<p>The news where all about this ‘Dark Knight’ (Batman) savior of the Gotham City. Harry was surprise and shocked to see and hear that this muggle city too, have their own hero that they rely on.</p>
<p>He shrugged at the thought of it, not that he isn’t a savior in his own world back then in England, just then the report changed into the news about ‘Bruce Wayne’ as they showed some foot stated of the playboy billionaire in a conference room, talking to the many news reporters, journalists, interviewers, etc as he heard the older male deep baritone voice which made him flushed and turned on by it, he sinker lower in his seat as his felt his boner. He had no idea just how this Bruce Wayne’s voice made him so turned on, sure the older male was charming, handsome and wealthy, and also has a great body built.</p>
<p>He gripped the remote before shutting the tv off before he kill himself from being turned on just by hearing this billionaire playboy Bruce Wayne. His face was flush red into a tomatoes color, not that he couldn’t feel his hard on beneath the baggy pants he was wearing. He groaned and moaned at that same time. He hadn’t had this kind of turn on or release after his son, Scorpius, was born.</p>
<p>And the only first person who has made him turn on like this was Draco, and that was when they were still dating and where together. But damned that this Bruce Wayne who he only know for a short moment of his life and only meet him and see him in the TV and Newspaper for the first time had sent him shivering and turned on at the same time at the sight of this older male, and his deep baritone voice only made it even harder for him to not to go horny like a teenager who couldn’t control his needs.  </p>
<p>He groaned painfully at the thought of it and decided to get up and take a cold shower just to get rid of his naughty thoughts. He often wonders why he was always attracted to guys who were a playboy themselves? Just looked how his life ended up with, dating a billionaire playboy like Draco Malfoy? He ended up with a broken heart and knocked up with the prat’s child. After his quick shower he decided to take a walk outside the street in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>Unbeknownst to him, the night in Gotham’s streets was a not place to be lurking around during night time, especially not when the place where where it was filled with dangers, thieves, and killer clowns, etc.</p>
<p>-0-</p>
<p>Harry had made a stop at a small store and bought a few things that he’ll need in his time staying in this place when he heard a cried of help from somewhere as he immediately went toward to whoever cried for help.</p>
<p>There in a some alley part of Gotham where a young mother with her young daughter about the age of 7 were crawling away in fear as 7 huge, men surrounding them with knives and daggers and were threatening the young mother and her child to hand over their money while some of the guys were saying dirty stuff about taking the young mother and raping her in front of her child. Harry’s blood boiled at the sight of it, how dare these people do such a horrible thing to this innocent people?!</p>
<p>The poor woman was terrified and was pleading for the 7 men to let her and her child go.  He put his grocery bag on the floor before going towards the mother and child and said. “HEY! Why don’t you people leave them alone!” he yelled as the 7  huge men turned around to glance at him and glared. One of them leered at Harry, making the younger man feel completely dirty Harry barely stopped himself from shuddering in disgust.</p>
<p>“Well, look what at what we have here boys? A little hero among us. A beautiful one too… Looks like we will be having quite treat tonight. I bet that pert little ass of yours had never been touched before. Don't worry, darling, by the time we are done, you will be begging for more," the leader of the gang said as his eyes glazed with lust. Harry wasn’t amused with their threat and glared back at the leader of the gang, the group havingforgotten about the mother and her daughter of whomthey were threatening and went toward Harry, encircling him, to prevent him from escaping them.</p>
<p>Not that Harry doesn’t know how to defend himself. He was a well known and powerful wizard back home as well as a powerful top auror and mediwizard back in his hometown. And despite his slender form, he was the only one who was a skillful and powerful

They were not only taught how to use defensive and offensive magic but they were also taught a few muggle defense moves to defend themselves against harm if they don’t have their wand with them, they cannot always rely on their magic and wand, it was a good thing too, learning to defend themselves comes in handy when it’s needed.</p>
<p>One of the gang, the leader was about to snatch Harry when he immediately dodged and took defensive position. The leader was about to grabbed Harry again when Harry gave the leader a punch in the gut,  causing the man to dropped on the floor and moaned in pain. His men stared in shock at their leader who was beaten up by a slender male who they thought was defenseless. Harry than told the woman to grab her child and run away and the woman did as she was told and ran away from them, and to hide somewhere.</p>
<p>Harry hoped she made it home safely because right at the moment, he was sure he was not going to escape unscathed. He was outnumbered as their rage fuelled their actions as knives and rods made their appearance.</p>
<p>The rest of the group  snapped out of their shock and was going to attack Harry, when a shadow figure landed behind the leader of the gang and kicked him in the back and sent him sprawling Harry watched his savior knock the leader out. Harry then snapped into action and helped the person who saved him.</p>
<p>Together with the figure garbed in black, the seven men were taken care off and each of them were tied up before Harry and his rescuer finally took a good long look at each other.</p>
<p>The figure before him was wearing a dark cloak, which had initially hidden his body. Now, the cloak was pushed behind, giving Harry the perfect view of his savior.</p>
<p>The man was extremely tall, his height and bulk easily surpassed Harry's own small and slender body. He was pale, where his mask did not cover him. His suit was made of protective material that helped to provide some padding and Harry was quite certain it was also partially made of Kevlar. Harry's eyes took in the man's strong thighs, his well-defined chest and finally the grim line of the man's lips.</p>
<p>Harry refused to feel embarrassed for checking out the man before him. He did possess quite a figure. So he simply raised an eyebrow and saw the man's lips tightened even more. He could easily imagine the frown behind the mask and almost laughed. The adrenalin coursing through his veins finally receded.</p>
<p>"Well, when I read about you, I never actually thought I would meet you on the very first night I ventured into the city," Harry finally said as he leaned against the wall, his eyes studying the man before him. Batman had already sunk back into the shadows though his eyes remained on Harry.</p>
<p>"You should not be here. You should leave, now," the man growled, quickly glancing behind him to ensure the men were still tied up.</p>
<p>"What about them?"</p>
<p>"The police will handle them."</p>
<p>Harry nodded and made to get up, he went and grabbed the grocery bag he was carrying a while ago before leaving.</p>
<p>"Do you have any way to return to your home?"</p>
<p>Harry nodded. "Yeah, I should be going. Batman, thank you, for your help."</p>
<p>Batman said nothing as he watched Harry leave the alley. He kept his eyes on the slender figure until the younger man disappeared from his sight. He then turned to study the ten men they had both brought down together and frowned in distaste. He hated rapists.</p>
<p>Ensuring they were properly tied up, he finally fled back to the roofs. His eyes roamed around the streets, looking for the slender figure but he could not see the other man anywhere. Frowning once more, he stepped back into the shadows and watched as patrol car came across the unconscious men and called for back-up. Once he was sure they were handled, he slipped into the shadows to monitor the rest of his city.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>-0-</p>
<p>When Harry came back from his stay in hotel for the meantime before going on hunting for a permit apartment first thing tomorrow morning.  He placed the grocery bag on the dining table before sliding down on a chair. Taking a deep breath and closing his eyes.</p>
<p>His first night here in Gotham where indeed something else. He can’t wait that will his day be tomorrow. He open his eyes and remember that he was to post to make a call to Hermione and to his to let’s them know that he made it safely in America. Pulling his cellphone out from his pants pocket, he immediately dial a number he knew and wait for that person to pick it up.</p>
<p>After the three ring from his phone as the person finally picked up his call and said. “Hello?”</p>
<p>“Hey, Hermione!. It’s me, Harry. I made it safely at America. I’m staying in a Hotel at the moment. And sorry that it took me so long to call you. I kind of forgot about calling you to let you know that I’m still in one piece and alive. I just got back to my hotel room from my grocery shopping. So how’s everyone back there at home?” He asked. Hermione squealed in delight to hear the good news that Harry made it safely in America before scowling her friend for forgetting to call.</p>
<p>Soon the two friend began to exchange their stories of the day they been doing. After Harry ended his call on Hermione, he immediately went to call Draco’s cellphone, as his ex-lover immediately picked up his call. “Hello, Harry.” Draco said.</p>
<p>“Hi, Draco. I’m just calling to lets you know that I made it at America safely. So, how Scorpius doing?” He asked.</p>
<p>“Fine. In fact his here and wanted to talk to you.” Draco said as he pull away from the phone and handed it to his son, as both Harry and their son immediately began to have their conversation.</p>
<p>“Hello, mama. I miss you so much already. Are you in America now? How was the place?! Is the city really big like what others people say about that country? And how come you took so long to call!?” His son complain as Harry chuckle before greeting his son and explain his adventure he had in Gotham city, he didn’t tell his son about his encounter at some of the Gotham Alley, he didn’t want his son to worried about him and especially didn’t want and need to hear Draco teasing and complain about him being a magnet trouble.</p>
<p>When he was done talking to his son, Harry told the boy to hand the phone over to Draco as the two ex-lover began to exchange some conversations as Draco had giving him the information about the apartment that Nott’s friend who lived in America (Gotham) and found a suitable and nice enough of an apartment for him to live permanently.</p>
<p>The apartment was not too far from the company building (tower) of one ‘Bruce Wayne’. And that Nott also had found him a suitable job for him to take while living there. And also told him to meet up with the friend of Nott’s so that he could get on with his job right ahead first thing tomorrow and meet his new employer or boss.</p>
<p>Harry told Draco to tell Nott that he was thankful for his help before saying his goodbye and went to bed.</p>
<p>Over the year, Harry had become close friend with Thoedore Nott, and the fact that Nott was his bestfriends husband make him get to know better about the other slytherin, not that he never got a chance to hang out with his ex-lovers fellow slytherin friends when they were dating. In fact he got closer to his ex-lovers fellow slytherin friends and got to know them better and realize that not all slytherins were evil or cunning like what hagrid said abou allt the slytherins to be.</p>
<p>Harry closed his eyes and think of what his day would be tomorrow and was already looking forward for tomorrow for his first day of meeting his new job here in America as he fell asleep. </p>
<p>-0-</p>
<p>The next morning, Harry woke up early and had his breakfast before going out and go towards the place to he was to supposed to meet Nott’s friend who had found a job for him to take while living here permanently. The address that Draco handed to him last night over the phone was in some café shop, as he went over there and to the cashier to order his drink and  a light meal and also asked the counter cashier about a person named: ‘Lucius Fox’ as the counter lady pointed her finger to the side of the café shop near the window where an elder man was sitting, reading a newspaper while his other hand held a cup of coffee in a plastic mug.</p>
<p>He thanked the counter casher and went toward Mr. Fox and sat beside the older male. Mr. Fox stopped reading and glancing up with a raise brow before nodding his head and said. “Ah, you must be Harrison Wilbur?” He asked. Draco had explained to Harry about using a fake ID and name as Nott had already made him a fake documentary file about him and using a fake name that goes by the name of Harrison Wilbur.</p>
<p>His friend had explained to him that he should use a fake name just in case since Wizards from all over the world knows who ‘Harry Potter’ was, and he didn’t want any of the Wizards to know that he was here in America. So he had agreed to use a fake name, ID, etc.</p>
<p>Harry nodded his head at Mr. Fox.</p>
<p> “Theodore Nott, told me all about you, and about you wanting to live here permanently. I have already found a suitable apartment to your taste and a new job for you to take, so you don’t need to go job hunting.” Mr. Fox said as he soon began to explain about what his job was about. Mr. Fox also asked him if he wanted to first see his apartment or go and meet his new boss, Harry answered that he wanted to know the place he was working and the boss he was to suppose to be working with. His job was to be a secretary to a well known businessman.</p>
<p>They drove to the place Harry was to supposed to work in. Harry was more getting to know about the Gotham City, the city were nothing compare to his hometown in England (London).</p>
<p>But the place was big. Soon they made it to a tall building (tower) that had a symbol of ‘W’ on the top of the building as they went inside the building and parked the car in the parking lot. Mr. Fox then lead Harry to his boss’s office to meet his boss.</p>
<p>Mr. Fox lead him out of the elevator and went toward a big double door that he guessed was to his Boss's office. Mr. Fox open the door as he let Harry led inside the room. Harry eye’s widened at the sight of the room, it was huge, made of a black marble walls, book case was painted in black and were filled with books, the office even had a mini bar on the side, had a huge flat TV screen on the living area, the desk was made of black glass table, with a MAC brand computer, the room was painted in black and gray. On the desk of which the luxurious back of the chairs was facing them.</p>
<p>“Mr. Wayne.” Mr. Fox said to which made Harry halt at his exploration of the room in mid shock at the word that come out of Mr. Fox’s lips. ‘Wayne?! As in Bruce Wayne the billionaire playboy?!’ Harry asked himself with a silent scream inside his head.</p>
<p>“What is it, Mr. Fox?” Bruce Wayne asked. Harry took a huge gulp. He recognize that voice, and only heard it at that TV news channel last night, but damn, hearing it in person was even more appealing.</p>
<p>“Mr. Wayne. I have brought your new Secretary just like you asked and this time I have picked a male one instead of female.” Mr. Fox said.</p>
<p> “And what wrong with having another female sectary Mr. Fox?” He asked, still not facing them, he was still busy looking outside his huge window while sitting down on his luxury chair. Harry rolled his eyes at Bruce reply. He could already understand as to why Mr. Fox didn’t hire another female Sectary, with Bruce Wayne reputation of being a playboy? There was no error of a female sectary falling to his flirtatious and seducing the woman into bed.</p>
<p>“Well sir. If I hire another female sectary, then none of your work would get done with you trying to ah. Seduce them.” Mr. Fox said.</p>
<p> “Hmm..” Was all Bruce said and then turn around to face them. Harry then did, for the first time see Bruce Wayne in person at last, and he couldn’t help but to checking out the man before him.</p>
<p>He did possess quite a figure with a well body built. Bruce Wayne were only wearing his sleeve shirt with a tie suit, his jacket weren’t on, but he can already see that this man possess a quite figure, he could totally understood why plenty of woman would fall in love with this man. Bruce Wayne was indeed, charming, handsome, had a sharp, deep blue eyes, jet black hair, sharp chick bone, sharp nose, firm arms, sharp and muscular shoulders, the man was totally an Alpha type, all borne, muscular, brain, looks and wealth.</p>
<p>Bruce for his part looked slightly shocked to see Harry, he had met the younger man yesterday night on his Batman night duty as he helped the younger male save the young mother and her child, and wasn't able to see close up the slender young man. But seeing it up close in broad daylight was even better.</p>
<p>He could totally see Harry better and clearly. Harry to him was a beauty, who possess quite a sexy figure, a little feminine built but lovely all the same, he couldn’t help but to let out a soft, quite purr at the sight of Harry’s feminine and cute figure. Harry’s eyes like what he had expected and see from last night were indeed emerald green. They look fitting on his feminine face, with huge green eyes, cute cheek bones, and cute sharp nose, lovely, cute, testy lips.</p>
<p>Bruce could feel that he was turned on by the sight of Harry, and yes Bruce is bi. He had dated a few slender male before but none of them was as this attractive like Harry was. He could already see that he would be enjoying having this man as his Secretary.</p>
<p>“Name?” He asked. ‘Might as well try and see what this gentlemen can do, and if his able to keep up with me.’ Bruce thought with a smirk, this was the guy he just meet and saved from last night and couldn't get enough of wanting to see this person again one more time. And he was lucky that this British young man would be his new secretary, oh he would have plenty of fun from teasing this young fellow.</p>
<p> “His name is Harrison Wilbur, Mr. Wayne, and he is 25 and half years old, born in England, Surrey London, birthday is on July 31, 1987.” Mr. Fox said as Harry stared at Mr. Fox in disbelief. (AN: I know Harry real birth year where 1980, but I wanted him to be a 7 years younger than Bruce.)</p>
<p>“Hmm… Got any family? Relatives? Children?” Bruce asked. </p>
<p>“Well, his biological parents are deceased.”</p>
<p>“Relatives, siblings?” Bruce asked. </p>
<p>“None, Sir, he is an only child. But he was raised by his parents close friend and went to a private school in England sir, along with his parents’ friend’s child.” Mr. Fox said. “Mmm.” Was all Bruce said as he kept on staring and checking out Harry. Harry was getting uncomfortable with Bruce checking him out.</p>
<p>“Hmm… Well then, I want him to start working for me first thing tomorrow morning. Mr. Fox, I want you to hand him my schedule and information about what he will do as my secretary, as well as my mansion address and also give him my cellphone number as well Alfred's too. Oh, and please also give him the files of my usual clientele, the company files and give him a tour of the building so he won’t get lost, that's all, I’ll see you tomorrow, Mr. Wilbur for you first day of work. Oh, and Mr. Fox, can you give him a more suitable attire for him to wear tomorrow. You may leave now gentlemen.” Bruce said.</p>
<p>Mr. Fox sighed in relief as he nodded his hand and placed a hand on Harry’s shoulder.  “Come on, Mr. Wilbur.” Fox lead him out of the office. Harry was still in shock and in disbelief. He got the job. Like really got the job. Soon Mr. Fox gave him Bruce’s usual schedule, the placed he usual went to, his phone number, and his butler's phone number who happened to be the Alfred that Bruce just mentioned a while ago, then Mr. Fox had handed him a few document files about the Wayne’s company usual clientele,etc.</p>
<p>He even got a tour inside the Wayne’s company building and met Bruce’s men who were working in the company. He was also given the private key.</p>
<p>He often wondered why Nott had given him this job, he didn’t want to work with a billionaire playboy and be his secretary, he wonder if this was one of those pranks that Nott was giving him. He was going to make a phone call tonight. But as for right now he didn’t have a choice but to accept the job since he was already given one, even if said job wasn’t the kind of job that he was hoping for.</p>
<p>“Does Mr. Wayne never have any male secretary before?” Harry asked Mr. Fox after one of their tour of the Wayne’s company.</p>
<p>“He has one before, but none of them had lasted long. They couldn’t keep up with him keep on bringing women to work, and couldn’t handle deal with him. He wouldn’t even take his secretary seriously, it the reason none of his male secretary couldn’t last long. The only one who lasted long where an Italian male secretary that I hire before but his staying here and working with Mr. Wayne only lasted 5 month before he finally break down and quit his job as being Mr. Wayne’s personal secretary.” Mr. Fox said.</p>
<p>Harry gulped at that information. He didn’t know that this ‘Bruce Wayne’ were far worse than dealing with one ‘Draco Malfoy’. And yes he used to work with Draco when they were still dating before and used to be one of ‘Draco Malfoy’ most top and number one secretary that lasted long before they broke up that Harry had quit being Draco’s personal secretary since he didn’t want to stay and keep working with Draco as his secretary when their relationship as lovers wasn’t working well, and he didn’t want to have any tie with Draco anymore and working with him while they broke up wasn’t a good idea it was only going to hurt him more.</p>
<p>Mr. Fox notice his reaction. “Are you already backing out from the job, Wilbur?” He asked. Harry shook his head no.</p>
<p>“No, is just that. I worked with guy like him before and used to be one of those secretary that deal with guy like them. So no need to worry about Mr. Fox, I think I can handle Mr. Wayne just fine. I lasted 3 year with working with my client before who were also a playboy and hard to work with him but I managed to get him to finish his work done in time before the deadline were.” Harry said.</p>
<p>“Ah, I see. So what made you quit your job if you already did get a decent job back then at your hometown?” Mr. Fox asked. Harry looked away looking sad.</p>
<p>“It’s a personal one. The guy I worked with used to be my fellow classmate and best friend. We had a sort of fight and I didn’t want to get in his life now that his married. His wife where one of those woman that don’t like me much. Astoria, that her name was one of the most popular and beautiful girl in our school and she mostly head over heel in love with my best friend who were a playboy ever since we were high school. He ended marrying her anyway duty to the family tie and well they were you know? Arranged marriage by their parents ever since they were little. We kind of grow up together and his wife didn’t like me much anyway. The guy parents made me quit my job as his secretary since it would ruin his job and relationship with his wife though the guy didn’t mind me still working for him as a secretary. But I made a decision and told him that I would quit since it was for the better good. I didn’t want to make his life any more trouble then I already had.” Harry said, truthfully, thought he didn’t tell the whole truth that the reason why he quit working with Draco was because of their relationship as lovers.</p>
<p>“Hmm.. Most be a tough life then?” Mr. Fox said, Harry shrugged.</p>
<p>“Not really. The guy wasn’t even in love with his wife, he was in love with someone else, but he didn’t have a choice since his father was the one who arranged the married for him.” That was true, Draco was forced to marry Astoria’s for their family sake, and it was Harry the one who broke up their relationship, despite Draco protest and didn’t want to break up with Harry, and after that break up was the time that Draco was married to Astoria, and it was within that week that he found out that he was pregnant with Draco’s child.</p>
<p>3 year later It didn’t take long for Draco to put two and two together when the news of him being pregnant with an unknown child’s father did Draco understand that their last relationship had ended with a child, a child that came out of wedlock, when Draco’s father found out about this he threw a fit, and it was Draco’s father that forced him to demand to hand the  child over to them, Harry at that time was outnumbered and powerless. In the end his son was now with his father.</p>
<p>“Ah, well it a good thing that Mr. Nott had told me about you then. It looks like I don’t have to worry about giving Bruce another failed secretary. And judging by your explanation? I think I can already tell that you will do good and prefect for Mr. Wayne. So I’m hoping to see you do your best as his new sectary, alright?” Mr. Fox said.</p>
<p>“Yes, of course.” Harry said. Harry was going to kill Nott later on. ‘Damn that good for nothing cunning slytherin!’ Harry cursed inside his head before following Mr. Fox and continue their tour while discussing about the job as Mr. Wayne new secretary.<br/>
