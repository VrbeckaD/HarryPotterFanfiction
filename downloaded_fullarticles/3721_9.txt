    <p>Severus Snape, the Headmaster in Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, was doing a thorough cleanup in a dessert shop, also known as, Headmaster’s office.</p><p>“May I assume I am the successor of some dessert shop in Hogsmeade instead of the Headmaster’s office, Dumbledore?” Snape cast an “Accio sweets” and “Protego”, marveling at the spectacle that umpteen kinds of sweet fleeting to him.</p><p>The Dumbledore in portrait chose to visit other portraits in Hogwarts, avoiding the awkward scene that Snape replaced all he once owned with his possessions.</p><p>Snape sighed. He had known that great wizard had sweet tooth - all the passwords of his office were desserts, but, that much? Hiding so many in his office?</p><p>The office was in a chaos, given that all the sweets had just left their shelters in such a rapid speed. However, something caught Snape’s eyes among all those mess.</p><p>A book.</p><p>Dog-eared. The pages of which yellowish.</p><p>Amidst those iridescent wrappers, the book stood out.</p><p>Out of slight curiosity, Snape took it up. To his astonishment, it’s a book on potions making, on the cover of which marked in unmistakable handwriting of Dumbledore, “Dark Magic. Side effects are unbearable”. What was Dumbledore playing at? Brewing a potion on his own?</p><p>He browsed the book causally and a potion came into his notice.</p><p>...drink it before casting a Patronus. The memory you use to perform the spell will be reviewed in a vivid way. Almost realistic hallucination.</p><p>Side effect: you will forget this memory forever. This potion is usually used for condemned criminals before their execution as an action of humanity.</p><p>Driven by a motive from nowhere, Snape pocketed the book without informing Dumbledore when the old guy returned from other portraits with a merry smile on his face.</p><p>“Happy with what you’ve got, Severus?” asked Dumbledore.</p><p>“As happy as you are,” said Snape dryly. “After the war, I would prefer somewhere more suitable for an old man rather than a fusion of candies, if I ever manage to survive.”</p><p>Honestly, survival didn’t mean so much to him at that moment. He might commit suicide as long as the Dark Lord fell then perhaps he could meet his Lily in the afterlife. If not, he would strangle Merlin for what the bloody hell of life had he sent to him.</p><p>Snape mused, fingering the book in his pocket.</p><p> </p><p>Snape has no time to ponder on the potion afterwards as the bestial Carrows put the whole Hogwarts under their tyranny. Detentions. Tortures. Pains. The hospital wing was always overloaded. Thus, he was busy making more effective healing potions for Madam Pomfrey so the book lay idle in his drawer for a long time.</p><p>However, it’s odd that that book often haunted his mind: he craved to re-feel the touch in his vivid memories, regain the fever crush once burnt in his young heart. Now those feelings still existed yet they had faded into smoldering ashes, from which on phoenix ever came out.</p><p> </p><p>Breathing the chilly air in Dean Forest, Snape looked around, spotting Potter doing his watch.</p><p>He dropped the Gryffindor sword into the chilly lake nearby - Snape never failed to torture Potter as long as he could and not put him in mortal peril. Then he focused on the day Lily called him “Sev” instead of “Severus”...</p><p>His heart stung.</p><p>That memory was faded. He was growing old. An old man couldn’t remember everything he experienced, could he? Snape knew the realization that crashed over him when he found his name could be so beautifully spoken between her lips. Yet there was nothing left. What robe did she wear that day? What were they talking about afterwards? His memory betrayed him.</p><p>“Expecto Patronum,” whispered Snape. Of course he’s capable of a nonverbal one, yet he needed that little noise to divert Potter’s attention to...this way. Also, the ability of performing a Patronus soothed him, assuring him that life wasn’t full of regrets and redemption, though the mirth was always too fragile to be touched.</p><p>How desperate he was to make it true! Even in a split second! There were eons of darkness ahead whilst the only source of light was left behind him, for all eternity.</p><p>The redhead was rescuing Potter form the lake. He hated to see such reunion as his would only come in afterlife. Sighing gloomily, Snape turned and set off.</p><p> </p><p>“How is it going?” was the first thing Dumbledore in portrait asked the moment he hit the grounds of Hogwarts. Merlin, he had long known that great wizard never cared about him, nor Potter or even himself - he cared only about victory.</p><p>“Everything goes well. Potter gets the sword. And the icy lake in Dean Forest is delightful. Thank you for assigning me to such a charming night expedition,” sad Snape with his usual sarcastic tone.</p><p>“Well, well,” smile Dumbledore, “don’t be so - ”</p><p>“I need to rest, if you excuse me/”</p><p> He had no intention to linger. Once he got his chamber, Snape opened the book.</p><p>This potion was named Once More - a poetical name, which portrayed its function exactly. The Potions Master examined the ingredients and discovered they were not so rare or expensive as he had expected. Most of them could be found in Hogwarts while the rest could be available in any apothecary outside.</p><p>The impulse allured him.</p><p>Let me have a try, thought Snape.</p><p>It’s a risk. Enormous risk indeed, given that he didn’t had so many happy memories for trials or any volunteers who could sacrifice their own ones, he had little chance. It had to be improved. He could lose no memories.</p><p>Not a single one.</p><p> The most precious treasure that kept him alive, both physically and mentally, all lurked in his mind, the mind that even the Dark Lord failed to fathom.</p><p>That night was doomed to be sleepless.</p><p> </p><p>Five detentions today from the Carrows.</p><p>Madam Pomfrey was complaining loudly about the frequency yet Snape could do nothing. The Dark Lord was watching him and everyone knew Severus Snape was a blood-curdling fiend like any other Death Eaters.</p><p>And as good as a turncoat.</p><p>A murderer, as well.</p><p>He had took notes on how he brewed Once More. The stirs, the ingredients, the heating time and temperature. He would make it accurate that how he created this bloody hell. Also, he added some soothing herbs that had a reputation for easing the aftermath.</p><p>If only amnesia was some kind of aftermath.</p><p>Snape chose a starry night to drink his first Once More. It had been a long time before he finally decided what memory he would give out. Couldn’t be a monumental one, nor too happy. They day he wore the Dark Mark had been one of his happiest memories, but not anymore after Lily’s death. Before he drained the phial, Snape scribbled a few words on the notebook.</p><p>Then everything spun.</p><p>It was a sunset. A spectacular one. He and Lily was roaming along the lake side after dinner. There were pleasant breezes, her hair messy in the cozy air.</p><p>Lily stared at the scarlet globe that was sinking under the surface. Snape stared at her.</p><p>“The setting sun had boundless beauty , yet the darkness is so near,” said Lily, still lost in thoughts.</p><p>“Isn’t the dark the other side of the coin?” said Snape.</p><p>Lily chuckled.</p><p>Bathed in the breezes, Snape was dazzled an lost in trance. Which one was more flamboyant, the sinking sun or her hair?</p><p>He couldn’t tell.</p><p>He wished it were forever. They would forever stand by the Black Lake in Hogwarts with no Potter in the castle to worry about. Merlin, make my memory amber, make it enduring.</p><p>Snape woke up.</p><p>It’s not like a dream. A coma might be a proper term. The Headmaster of Hogwarts lay on the stone floor in his chamber, his obsidian eyes blank and bottomless.</p><p>He blinked, slowly getting to his feet.</p><p>What happened? It’s like waking from a most pleasant dream with committing nothing into his memory. What memory had he used?</p><p>No idea.</p><p>Snape grabbed the notebook and checked it. Before he drank the potion, he scribbled:</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <em>Go to the Black Lake.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>What the bloody hell?</p><p>Anyway, Snape put on his usual black cloak and stroke out of the castle. It was wicked and wild wind, messing his hair as Snape walking towards the lake.</p><p>The Black lake was deadly quiet. No merpeople. No tiny bubbles emerged from surface. Not a spark of light ever reincarnate itself.</p><p>He stood here for a long time, not recalling any merry memory that have taken place here.</p><p>Had there been any Gryffindor who happened to be peering through their window, why would find their formidable Headmaster, the bat of the dungeons, lingering besides the lake, looking like a puppet on a lonely string more than ever before.</p>
