    <p>hello! my name is jen, and here are the standard rules for prompts:</p><p><strong>1.</strong> <em>No odd kinks. </em>(You may still request smut with a kink, if you’d like, but nothing super rare. Think newly married couple: vanilla with just a bit of optional spice.)</p><p>
  <strong>2. </strong>
  <em>I will not write anything <strong>sexual</strong> in the furryverse. Bad experiences have traumatised me. Fluff/non-sexual prompts are still applicable.</em>
</p><p>
  <strong>3. </strong>
  <em>No rape/non-con. </em>
</p><p>
  <strong>4. </strong>
  <em>I do <strong>not </strong>“have” to write your prompt(sorry, bro)but I will try to as long as I am comfortable with it. </em>
</p><p>aaaand that’s it pretty much! if ya’ll have any questions, feel free to ask when you request something! i’ve provided a link to my tumblr in case you want to have a longer or more private conversation about the specifics of your prompt, so don’t be scared to reach out. </p><p>i am here for your metaphorical disposal. </p><p>(once again, just thought i’d remind you that i won’t write anything I don’t want to. sorry if this means i have to say no to your prompt. nothing against you, i’m just a bit squirmish sometimes! that being said, please feel free to suggest weird prompts too, like horror or sci-fi. i’m trying to broaden my horizons with this piece!) </p><p>thanks so much!</p>
