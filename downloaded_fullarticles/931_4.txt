    <p align="justify">Heavy rain droplets were falling against the bay window looking out to the small garden with two oak trees and lush green grass. Although the young woman normally loved hearing this particular sound, minus heavy thunder, could not be calmed by it today as she was standing and contemplating in her room. This room had been her home on this planet. She wanted to memorize it as much as possible before she would give it up for some time or even forever. Her parents had worked very hard to live on a planet which would have been considered extremely primitive by the rest of the galaxy, but as it was far in the unknown regions her parents needn’t fear prosecution by the empire. In a relatively short time they had completed their medical studies and their approbation as dentists under their new aliases Kento and Mallie Granger, made a vast amount of money at the stock market to be able to provide their son Galen and newly born daughter an easier life.</p><p align="justify">They had been able to flee at the last minute into the unknown regions without preparation, from the Wookie homeworld Kashyyyk, where they had eventually found refuge during the Great Jedi Purge. Her mother had survived the vicious attack of Trandoshan slavers, heavily wounded, but her love for her family had given her strength to pull through. Her father had often teased her mother that her stubborn Mandalorian heritage probably was part of the reason she had survived.</p><p align="justify">Hermione fought back tears as she stood with the window to her back next to her bed with white linen and black floral pattern and light blue blanket and reread the article of the Daily Prophet of yet another murdered muggle family. Her parents had often spent hours in the evening in this room and told her and Galen countless stories of the Galaxy, of the Jedi Order and of Mandalore. To help their children integrate into this planet’s culture they had also researched epics, stories and fairy tales children usually grew up with. But Hermione also remembered how strict they had been in their own curriculum with their own children. It had not been enough to simply learn the curriculum in this country, but their parents had drilled them in different languages from this planet and the most frequent ones in the galaxy, science, history of the Republic, the Jedi Order, Mandalore and most important of all: The Force.</p><p align="justify">Hermione and her brother had both been taught from a young age to utilize the Force and to control their emotions. Five Meditations throughout the day had not been uncommon and she had secretly continued doing this in Hogwarts. The years before her brother had gone to Durmstrang had been the happiest they had in this house. Galen had been invited to Durmstrang and to Hogwarts but had decided on Durmstrang as he had argued that he needed to go his own way. In her fourth year, they had been able to train with each other secretly as he had been part of the Durmstrang delegation at the Triwizard Tournament, which had led to some confusion as it had been obvious to some that they knew each other well. Her gaze fell on the Muggle picture of the murdered family again and she took a calming breath and gathered the Force around her. Her family had already been through so much. Now it was her turn in protecting them.</p><p align="justify">Her brother was currently in America to train as an Auror, but he had decided to fight against Voldemort and its followers with the backing of another magical community. But as of now he had still not their backing as they refused to help those in danger from the Death Eaters. He had first wanted to initiate himself into Voldemort’s forces to fight from within, but after heated deliberation with his sister he had concurred that it may have worked if they believed him to be a pureblood, but just like his sister he was considered a “Moodblood”. So far nobody knew that they were related. She could therefore not obliviate him, but she would have to do it with her parents. She had contemplated to obliviate and sent them off-planet but had come up empty.</p><p align="justify">Her mother’s Mandalorian houses were enemies to each other and neither of them would grant her family sanctuary as she had been a bastard child. Her worth to any of the families was quite clear as they had given her to the Jedi Order although they had despised it at that time. There had never been a Mandalorian Jedi since Tarre Vizsla, thousands of years ago. Her mother's maternal family had been willing to instruct her mother, Galen and her separately in the fighting styles of Mandalore, during summer holidays, but never would have taken the risk at letting the Empire find out their relations to a Jedi.</p><p align="justify">Her grandmother’s house had been more forthcoming as they had lost one important member of the clan towards the end of the Clone Wars. A half-sister to her mother had been murdered by a Sith.  Hermione had even contemplated trying to contact the Chiss Ascendancy, as their territory was nearer to Earth then Mandalore, but she had nothing to bargain with them and they only knew about her father as he had accidentally come in contact with them. No. She had to hide them somewhere on Earth. The other human families with force-sensitive children, her father had rescued with the help of Senator Bail Organa, were already packing. This was her trial. She had to make sure that Harry would be able to defeat Lord Voldemort, but leaving her family behind without any memory about her or her brother was probably the hardest part and she hoped that she would catch her parents unguarded. They were war veterans and after all and would become extremely angry at her eliminating herself from their memory. Wiping one single escaped tear from her cheek and sniffing shortly she pulled the Force towards her once more for comfort and courage. </p><p align="justify">“Hermione, tea is ready darling!” her mother called from the living room where they were watching some documentary about Australia.</p><p align="justify">“Coming, mum!” Hermione answered and was glad that the wavering was hardly noticeable in her voice.  It was time. She took one last glance and banished all her things in a small enchanted box, to make the room look like an unused guest room. Walking through her doorpost she almost dripped over their astromech R5, who had silently hovered behind the door. She had ordered him to rely on a recorded message to her brother if he would be able to.</p><p align="justify">“Keep them safe,” she whispered patting him as he responded with two short beeps.</p><p align="justify">Crookshanks would stay with her family and she had relayed the command already to the half-Kneazle cat, who complied, even though he didn’t want to. Silently she crept down the stairs, using the Force to shield her intention from her parents until she stood behind her unexpecting parents, who were happily chatting about the documentary and raised her wand with trembling hand. She had to do this right. If she did it wrong she could destroy their minds forever. She took another breath, centred herself and concentrated on the story she was planting in her parents’ heads and what she had to delete from their brains. Finally, she felt that she was able to do it and whispered with wavering voice and tears in her eyes:” Obliviate.” The wand lit up and Hermione could feel the magic of her spell doing what it was supposed to do. With the disappearing memories of her and her brother she also observed their disappearing in the family pictures.</p><p align="justify">One by one she could see her baby self in the high chair, disappear from the picture next to her mother, disappear from the pictures with her brother in various places: In Rome, in the garden, in oxford, at the Lake Garda, in their hidden Correllian freighter and many more. Having performed her heavy-duty she let the tears run down her cheeks as she stole out of her home taking it in one last time. The house, with the red bricks, the clean white windows and elaborate white door and their high hedges surrounding it. She took another deep breath and with her head looking down, her shoulders pulled up she walked determined towards her trial, which -unknown to her- would only be the beginning of a hard and dangerous life leading her away from her home planet in the Unknown Regions.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p>
