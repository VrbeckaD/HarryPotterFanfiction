</center><p>It was such a tedious thing, being pursued. Being desired but never truly <em>wanted</em> and yes, Prince Draco knew there was a significant difference.</p><p>Women travelled to his marble palace from every nook and cranny of the earth; royalty, nobility, gentry, daughters of knights, farmers, butchers and bakers and candlestick makers, all journeyed with the intent of trying for his hand. The attractive, unwed prince of a rich island nation, scion of the great house of Malfoy was simply too tempting a promise to resist. But they all inevitably, tragically failed in their foolish quests to win his love, for they always seemed to forget the most important part of his reputed tale.</p><p>He was cursed you see… Or blessed, depending on the weather or the woman.</p><p>Unfortunately, the moment he decided he could not love them, his gaze would turn them to ice. The fact they continued to dock in his kingdom in spite of such (true) rumours was the true curse, they never learned their lesson and the reward was never greater than the risk.</p><p>Their fate was always the same, right down to the icy, preserved expression of their final agonised scream. Women rich beyond belief, legendary beauties, warriors, cruel minded ladies and kind-hearted girls with flowers in their hair and youthful hope in their eyes shared alike in their destiny.</p><p>They always vanished after, usually the moment he turned away, consumed by self-disgust (the perfect moment if there was one, he could never bear to turn around to catch them being removed or ‘magically disappearing’). He never knew where they went; perhaps they melted? Logic made him suspect that someone had the woeful task of moving them, but he’d never managed to get a word out of his staff.</p><p>At least he could console himself (or his trusted Council of Twelve could in his stead) with the fact there was a good reason for his lack of affection. His heart was not a free commodity, no matter how impossible the circumstances.</p><p>It belonged to a woman like no other. A woman he had dreamed of countless times, the image of her so tangible he truly believed one day, he would witness her riding toward him on her skeletal winged horse, riotous, chestnut curls emerging from beneath a golden helm in the shape of a lion’s gaping maw, her polished golden armour sparkling in the morning sun or perhaps reflecting midnight and a million stars…</p><p>He sighed, trying to put her from his mind to focus on his duties. He didn’t even know her name; and yet, he was besotted. Consulting his advisors was difficult enough without the folly of distraction in the form of her curves and radiant smile which appeared behind his eyelids in the gentle embrace of slumber.</p><p>It would be so easy to nod off while they droned on about landowners or taxes (perhaps it was the landowners complaining about the taxes? He wasn’t certain); but it was important he try to listen for the good of his subjects…Another hour to sundown and he could dismiss them in favour of a light supper, a good book and when he was finally tired and able, the welcome warmth of his bed.</p><p>He watched the light slink away, replaced by shadows, feeling his excitement at the prospect grow.</p><p>But unbeknownst to the young prince, his excitement was misplaced, had he been able to see what the shadows carried it would have been replaced with dread and soul-consuming terror.</p><p>A powerful deity from the depths of the underworld had heard tales from the recently deceased and decided she wished to possess him; Fables about his beauty, prestige and of course the way his grey eyes held ladies captive before they froze to death as punishment for persisting, showing their truly evil natures or attempting to force his hand in marriage; made her long for that which she could not have. His resistance was a siren’s call to the entitled.</p><p>Unseen, the goddess Astoria lurked through the palace, an invisible voyeur stalking her prey, hopefully for the last time, watching over what she coveted as he slept, innocent, handsome and unaware; she was always long gone before he rose, however, the suspicious feeling he was being watched always lingered.</p><p>Having gathered her power while he fended off frivolity, proposals and attempts at courtship, Astoria rallied her army with a cry, struck the earth three times, speaking an ancient incantation and ascended.</p><p>Her physical form was gruesome. Her skeletal, emaciated body was only exaggerated by her loosely draped chiton. The handful of mortals that witnessed her rise into to the land of the living immediately found themselves her newest subjects. Weak-hearted, cowards the lot of them. Her army trampled their corpses into the earth as they began their siege: Meanwhile, a brave watchman with a will made of steel ran through the night with news for the prince from the farthest shore.</p><p>Admirals, Generals and all manner of personnel arrived within an hour. Draco’s great hall became a war room where they discussed defences, protection and succession in rapid-fire, with little care for the feelings of the sovereign who sat on the throne listening to their thinly veiled whingeing about the situation he had placed them in.</p><p>“Why can’t he freeze them?”</p><p>“Mythical soldiers from the underworld? Are you mad, they would be immune!”</p><p>“We don’t know for sure.”</p><p>“Well perhaps we could place him in danger for our own sake…”</p><p>“And if this-this <em>demoness</em> murders him… What then? We have no available heir!”</p><p>“Then we know what we must do.”</p><p>“I say we put our best legion in front of his highness.”</p><p>“And what… Expect them to stand there and be slaughtered?”</p><p>“GET OUT!!!”</p><p>Draco was exhausted. Discussions had been going on for hours and they were no closer to a decision on how to best deal with the threat and havoc the otherworldly woman wrought.</p><p>His anger twisted and grew while his tone darkened, barely more than a whisper it carried the weight of a scream.</p><p>“All of you get out… Tell everyone that does not wish to fight to run as fast and as far as they can.”</p><p>His advisors stared, the generals muttered their displeasure and yet the moment they noted the prince’s stony expression they bowed politely before scurrying off to do his bidding.</p><p>By nightfall the palace was fuller than he expected as he watched on from the astronomy tower while his people evacuated, they spilt out of the city gates, eddying like floodwater in their rush.</p><p>And then they began to fall.</p><p>Most dropped instantaneously, others staggered and slipped unwillingly until everyone was strewn around the gates.</p><p>Then he saw her.</p><p>The watchman hadn’t been wrong. She was a walking horror. Fear gripped his heart but Draco refused to let it reach his features, he would not show weakness now.</p><p>‘Let her come’ he thought vindictively.</p><p>It was reckless, but he had to admit he wanted to see if his power was a match for such a being.</p><p>The closer she came to the gates the more he doubted himself. His men fell, then his advisors, then his Council of Twelve and finally he realised she had forced them into a deep sleep.</p><p>He would face her alone.</p><p>She reached the portcullis unopposed and with every step, he could not see but knew she took, he was filled with bitter rage.</p><p>The moment she shattered the doors to his throne room, her intentions booming and echoing off the crisp white, stone walls, he exploded; his power nebulous and devastating, freezing everything in its path including the arrogant goddess that had invaded his land.</p><p>He was no fool. The moment she was indisposed Draco made his escape. What else could he do?</p><p>Unfortunately, it wasn’t enough to hold her long. She pursued for a time until she realised it was futile; after that, it didn’t take long for his advantage to slip, she gained the upper hand by doing the one thing he didn’t expect; leaving.</p><p>In her stead, she left his castle surrounded, putting his last few defences to sleep; every exit swarmed with her soldiers, the secret tunnels were heavily guarded and to top it all off, she had placed an infallible sentinel; a twelve headed dragon, right at his gate.</p><p>He’d never thought freedom was something he would grieve in his lifetime; and yet, salty tears dripped down his face until his body was wracked with sobs.</p><p>His people suffered on his behalf and would continue to do so; his army, his advisors and worst of all his twelve closest friends; What could he do but give up all hope and surrender?</p><p>No!</p><p>That would not do.</p><p>Trapped in his apartments without a soul to hear his pathetic cries, he turned his face to the clouds with a wish held deep in his heart that the warrior he dreamed of might swoop in and save the day.</p><p>“Is she even real?” He screamed to no one. or so he thought</p><p>An unexpected voice drifted down from the heavens but he did not react; his concept of reality was so fragile he was hardly concerned about hearing a disembodied voice from above.</p><p>“You know in your heart she is.”</p><p>He stared at the clouds drifting past, wondering if they would answer a second time.</p><p>“Then where is she?”</p><p>“We know not… Ask the Wind, it knows more than I.”</p><p>So, he did. And when the Wind explained that he knew nothing, Draco asked the Stars, then the Moon and finally, the Sun.</p><p>His sorrow unbridled, tears began to slip unbidden down his cheeks and the Sun, feeling sympathetic, shone a little brighter to dry his tears while it told the young prince all it knew of his beloved.</p><p>“She is coming for you. From the depths of the sea, she will rise triumphant and make her way to liberate your kingdom. But she cannot defeat Astoria by mortal means; her quest will be arduous, but I will hasten her to you, I will guide her.”</p><p>Shielding his eyes from the piercing rays, he thanked the Sun profusely for its kindness and compassion, bidding it goodnight as it slipped below the horizon.</p><p>He was elated, high on the knowledge the woman he had envisaged and wished for was real. She was the match that set the deep, twisted forest of his loneliness ablaze. There was no way to describe how freeing it was, after so many years pining for a future he thought reality had denied him, having it in his grasp provided more hope than he knew what to do with.</p><p> </p>
