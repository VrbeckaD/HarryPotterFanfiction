    <p>Morticia strolled into Gomez’s study, her daughter balanced on her hip. Her husband was watching his trains speed along their tracks with a manic glint in his eye. She smiled softly at the sight. After the model locomotives crashed, he set down the controller and looked to her.</p><p>“What a wonderful crash, eh Tish?” He chuckled.</p><p>“Indeed, Qeurido. I come bearing the most wonderous news. She bounced Wednesday slightly.</p><p>“Oh? Has another world war begun?” He bounced on his heels like a child on Yule morning.</p><p>“Not that wonderous, dear. Cousin James and his wife, Lily, have passed away. Just moments apart, too.” Gomez smiled.</p><p>“Ah, how romantic! What of their daughter? Holly, wasn’t it? Beautiful name. A pretty plant, but highly deadly.”</p><p>“The girl lives. I believe that we should claim her. She’s about a year younger than Pugsley, and has no other real living family to speak of. At least, no magical family. Her mother’s sister is an <em>ananis</em>, and, from what I remember of the wedding, quite hateful. I shudder to think of what she would do to the poor girl.” Morticia frowned. The very thought of someone harming a child, especially one of their blood, infuriated her.</p><p>“We can go tomorrow, Tish. I’m sure Mama wouldn’t mind watching Wednesday and Pugsley for the night! And our little Lilith would love some time with her Grandmother, right Wednesday?” He cried with his usual exuberance, scooping his daughter into his arms, and bouncing her on his hip. The girl scowled at him, and continued to suck on the poison-dipped rattle her mother had given her earlier. Morticia smiled at the sight. Soon, their little family would grow once more…</p><p>X0X0X0</p><p>Petunia was furious. How dare her sister just up and die, leaving her brat to such upstanding <em>normal </em>people as her family?! Weren’t freaks supposed to live longer, and be immune to <em>normal</em> illnesses? But no, she now had to take care of some freakish child, who was far too quiet, and who’s eyes were too green and knowing. At first, she had hoped the girl was normal, unlike her freakish parents. That hope was quickly dashed when the girl made a bottle float towards her when Petunia had gotten distracted listening in on a row between Mr. and Mrs. Three. The little hope she still held, that maybe the girl could control herself was destroyed when her hair began to change colors. She had felt hate rise within her, and decided than and there that she wanted as little to do with the girl as possible, and stuffed her into the cupboard under the stairs. Out of sight, out of mind. She had then started on dinner, and thought of what to tell Vernon. As she pulled the roast from the oven, she heard a knock at the door. Maybe it was her latest package from Sears. She did so love catalogue shopping. She turned off the oven, and made her way to the door. Petunia opened it and shrieked. Standing there were two freakish looking people. The woman was pale as a sheet, with long dark hair, blood red lips and nails, and eyes that seemed empty and devoid of life. The man had on a suit that reminded her of old-fashioned prison clothes. It was loose, and striped in black and white. He had a pencil thin mustache, and dark hair, slicked back. His eyes were as dark as the woman’s, but held a glint that unnerved her.</p><p>“Pardon me, but are you Petunia Evans?” The woman’s voice was soft, but held something that unnerved Petunia. It reminded her of a knife wrapped in velvet.</p><p>“Dursley, actually. May I ask who you are?” She sniffed. She had abandoned that name at the first opportunity.</p><p>“My name is Gomez Addams, and this is my lovely wife, Morticia. We were informed that you have custody of our niece, Holly, and were wondering if we might check on her.” The man bounced on his feet like an over-excited toddler. Petunia had a wonderous idea.</p><p>“Of course, please come in.” She stepped aside. “Would you like some tea?”</p><p>“Ah, no thank you.” The woman moved with an unnatural grace. The two settled onto the loveseat in the lounge.</p><p>“Allow me to fetch her. I’ll be just a moment.” She stepped back into the hall, and smiled to herself. This would work, else she had no clue what to do with the brat. She stooped slightly and picked up the brat. The girl just looked up at her with a calm, passive gaze. She re-entered the lounge, trying not to drop the brat, despite her dislike of her niece.</p><p>“Oh, Gomez, isn’t she just adorable.” The woman cooed, scooping the brat from her arms. “Such brilliant eyes.” She settled back onto the loveseat, smiling down at the girl.</p><p>“I’m not actually sure that Vernon, my husband, and I will even be able to keep her. Vernon just got a new job, and we have our own son to take care of, Dudley. We may have to put her in an orphanage.” Petunia fretted.</p><p>“If need be, we could take care of her, right Qeurido?” Morticia glanced at her husband.</p><p>“Of course, Tish! Why, Wednesday would be thrilled to have a sister!” The man cried. Through all this, the baby kept quiet, glancing around the room.</p><p>“Why, I couldn’t possibly ask you to take care of her. Children can be so expensive.” Petunia sneered in her head. Who would name a child <em>Wednesday</em> of all things?</p><p>“Think nothing of it! We could easily afford a dozen children, right Tish!?” The man-Gomez-was far too loud.</p><p>“Of course, Gomez. Really, Petunia, we insist. This way, your son and Holly both get the care they need.” The woman attempted to reassure her.</p><p>“If you’re certain. I just want her to get all the love she deserves.” Petunia gagged internally.</p><p>“Of course, we’re certain. She’s family after all! Now, where are her things?” The woman smoothed a hand over the girl’s hair, which had faded to the same shade of black as hers.</p><p>“Allow me to fetch it. All she has is a blanket and a small diaper bag.” Petunia scuttered out of the lounge, and scrambled to gather the girl’s things from the cupboard. Nearly half an hour later, she watched the odd family leave her home, and heaved a sigh of relief. With luck, she’d never have to see any of those freaks ever again.</p><p>X0X0X0</p><p>With a loud pop, Morticia, Gomez, and Holly landed in the entry hall of the Addams’ family home.  The three headed towards the kitchen. Strapped into an electric-high chair was Wednesday, while Lurch stood behind her and Grandmama worked at a cauldron.</p><p>“Hello, dearies! Is this the little dear? Oho, her magic is delightful! Such a deep gray! She’ll fit right in! I’ll finish dinner and then prepare the adoption ritual! Lurch! I’ll need my extra-large lead cauldron from the attic! It’s a good thing I stocked up on belladonna last week. For now, we eat!” The hag-woman cackled, waddling into the kitchen. Gomez strode over to Wednesday, and swung her into his arms.</p><p>“How is my little Lilith, hm? Say, Mama, where’s Pugsley?” Gomez’s words came out a little slurred, as Wednesday had his mustache in her grip, pulling tight.</p><p>“Sleeping by the hearth. Dinner’s ready!” Mama plunked a medium sized cauldron onto the table. Morticia set Holly in her lap, and took the bottle Lurch offered. The family soon settled into dinner, all the adults excited for dinner. At one point, Wednesday had thrown a senbon at her new sister, which had gone off course when Holly had glared at it. A few minutes later, Pugsley had bitten her leg, and she had kicked him in the face, leaving a small gash in his brow. Brother and sister had babbled at one another for a minute before resuming their meals. Apparently, they had decided they liked her.</p><p>X0X0X0</p><p>The adoption ritual was simple. The girl was placed up to her chest in a burbling black philter, made primarily of carnations, grave dirt, and water from the main fountain in the yard. The girl giggled and splashed the potion, not concerned about the foul scent. Morticia and Gomez each held a child, and stood in a triangle around it, with Mama at the final point. Morticia drew the family black rhodium athame, and gently sliced her finger tip, letting thirteen drops fall into a chalice of the same metal. She gently pricked Wednesdays, allowed the blood to drop, and passed the athame and chalice to her husband, letting her daughter suck the blood from her cut. Gomez repeated the process, passing the tools to Mama. Once the hag-woman had bleed into the chalice, she gently poured it into a baby bottle, before feeding half of it to Holly. Once the baby had drunk the necessary amount, Mama pulled the bottle away. Holly was encompassed in a black aura, which seemed to suck the light from the candles in their holders. Her eyes darkened several shades, and her hair changed from messy auburn to silky black. Over all, she looked like a blend of all four parents. She giggled, and reached for her mother. Morticia cooed, sweeping her up. With a daughter on each hip, she turned to Gomez.</p><p>“Oh, Querido! She could pass for Wednesday’s twin if Wednesday was a few years younger!”</p><p>“That she could, Tish.” He chuckled. “Mama, could you take Pugsley?” The hag took Pugsley, and Gomez took his new child. “Mama, as tradition, you should name her. You are matriarch.” Gomez kept his voice quiet as he swaddled the infant in a soft back shroud.</p><p>“Little one.” Mama spoke, staring her new granddaughter in the eye. “You shall be named Hydra Hysteria Addams, third of your name.” The newly named Hydra gurgled, yanking her grandmother’s hair.</p><p>“She loves it!” Gomez crowed, eyes gleaming in the candlelight. Not an hour later, Hydra fell asleep in a crib with her new brother and sister.</p><p>“Something tells me that our family is not complete yet, Querido. Shall we remedy that?” Morticia looked at her husband over her shoulder on her way out of the nursery. The imp like man bounded after her, and the children slept to the sounds of screams.</p>
