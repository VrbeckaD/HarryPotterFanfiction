It irritated his swollen eyes and a little part of him wanted to hit something, but mainly he just wanted to stop. Stop walking, stop needing, stop crying. Stop feeling.</p><p>His mum was gone, and now so was his dad, and he was too young for this, and what was he meant to do. He couldn’t - there wasn’t any way to -</p><p>His dad would have hated this, he thought distantly, as he leaned against the side of the building, trying to catch his breath in-between the sobbing. He would have said something gently sarcastic, and tipped his head up, and told him not to be unhappy, sweetheart. His dad wasn’t here right now though. His dad was never going to be here again. He - what - what was he meant to do now?</p><p>He had never imagined a world without his parents - it wasn’t something imaginable.

His eyes ached, and he rubbed at them harshly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Later, he was never really sure how long he stayed there, staring down at the grotty pavement, covered in cigarette butts and chewing gum. He looked up, confounded, when Lily and Sirius arrived.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>They sat either side of him, Lily fiercely dragging him into her arms. He sheltered in her shoulder, and cried and cried.</p></div>
