    <p>It all started because Sirius was late for Quidditch practice. He was sure James was going to have his head for, and he quotes this directly from the source, undermining his captaincy. Sirius has demanded how could his everyday tardiness reflect on his best friend's leadership skills before reviewing his own words, and yeah, okay, he could see how that could diminish James in the eyes of the rest of the team. If they see him letting Sirius get away with shit, then they will attempt to do the same.</p><p>Shit. He had even promised to be on time this time. It had just been so early! He couldn’t wake up even if he had wanted to!</p><p>His thoughts of quidditch, angry best friends and promises broken came to an abrupt stop. His head turned unwillingly to the forest. Pulled in by how tempting the Forbidden Forest looked all of a sudden, he walked dazed towards it. The trees seemed to edge away from him, to make a clear path for him to follow. And follow, he did. Deep into the forest he went, no worries of centaurs and man eating giant spiders.</p><p>Later on, he will wonder why nobody had stopped him. If they had even seen him walk into the forest in full daylight, not even attempting to hide the fact that he walked straight into the forbidden.</p><p>~#~</p><p>Death stalked, caged in the skin of a fox, back and forth, gnashing his teeth together, annoyed that once more, he is forced into the body of one so much weaker than him. There was no other choice, he knows. Humans can not bear to see Death in all its glory. So he is forced to communicate with them through possession of lesser beings. He could not even possess a human because the mortals then get weepy when he leaves a corpse behind.</p><p>Sirius Black, his charge’s brother, arrives, walking calmly towards the orange fox. It wouldn’t last.</p><p>He was correct as Sirius woke up, jerky head turns, loud swears and all that comes with realizing you’re not where you were supposed to be and you have no idea how you came to be where you are.</p><p>Death waited for him to regain his bearings and when Sirius turned to leave, he gave his presence away.</p><p>“Do not leave, Sirius Black,” he commanded in a deep serious voice that did not belong to a fox. Sirius startled and his eyes widened into tennis balls as the fox continued to speak. “I did not go through all the trouble of bringing you here just for you to leave straight away.”</p><p>“You’re talking!” Sirius exclaimed. Well, that’s quite obvious. Not the smartest tool in the shed, was he. “You’re a fox!”</p><p>“Yes,” Death quickly got cut off before he could elaborate.</p><p>“And you kidnapped me!” He accused.</p><p>“Not quite. I intend to return you after a little chat,” he assured the boy, bored already of this conversation. Why do humans always have to be like this? They always react the same, Death thought uncharitably. Oh my god, an animal’s talking! Big deal, there are actual dragons in the world and they are scared of talking animals.</p><p>“You are? Thank Merlin! I thought for sure you were leading me to your family of evil foxes to make me your next meal. The meat on my body keeping your family full for the next month.” He said with a large grin.</p><p>“No. No murder,” unfortunately, he replied drily. “Just here to warn you of a great calamity soon to come to someone close to you.”</p><p>“What? Is something going to happen to James? Remus? Is it Death Eaters?” The boy spoke worriedly.</p><p>“A great calamity will befall your sister, Sansa.”</p><p>Immediately, the handsome boy’s posture changed from frantic to defensive. Death’s eyebrow raised in curiosity but it was terribly ineffective as a fox.</p><p>“Sorry to break it to you but Sansa and I don’t speak. You’ll have to go to one of our cousins or our horrid bitch of a mother if you want to warn someone of her great calamity,” he spoke the last words sarcastically. Sirius turned to leave and Death sighed. Humans can be so selfishly human at times.</p><p>“Well, I cannot go to them as you are the one closest to her here at Hogwarts.” The boy continued walking out of the clearing. Death raised his voice. “Due to an... error, Sansa is at the moment susceptible to madness and eventually, suicide.”</p><p>Sirius stopped in his tracks.</p><p>“What?” His voice cracked. “You’re lying! Sansa is fine.” He hissed.</p><p>Death knows that humans know nothing of what is beyond their little bubble which bursts when they die and they then learn all the gossip of what happens down below, the affairs of the gods, and what happens after they die so he is lenient in the face of such disrespect from the young wizard.</p><p>He continues speaking as if no interruption happened.</p><p>“Sansa Black is in a very vulnerable mental space right now due to an error, on our part, of how we placed her soul into this body.”</p><p>He paused as Sirius seemed already ready to burst with questions.</p><p>“When humans die, their souls are wiped clean of memories of their lives. They forget crimes they committed, people they loved and who they were. They get a fresh start as they are then placed into a newborn babe.”</p><p>“Wait! Back up! Reincarnation is real?” He asked in an incredulous tone.</p><p>“Yes,” the grave voice resonated out, bored. </p><p>“So how did you mess up with Sansa?” Death wished he could bite the annoying wizard.</p><p>“Due to special circumstances of her past life, she and many others were given the chance to request for how they wanted their next life to go.” Yes, that’s a good understatement for giving rewards towards those who fought during the long winter. The Old Gods had felt pity towards the few that had outlasted the White Walkers and those who had died in their attempts. Sansa had been one of many who died. So they had given each one thing they wished for in their next life. The Targaryen girl wished to be queen in her next life, and so she was born Elizabeth Tudor, whom they had moved heaven and earth to make the Virgin Queen, bringer of the golden era.</p><p>Sirius looked as if he wanted to ask why the special treatment, so he quickly spoke on so that the boy wouldn’t have the chance.</p><p>“She and her family, at the place of asking for one thing each, shared two wishes that they agreed on. One was that they will all be together in their next life and the other was that they will remember their past one. After much deliberation, we agreed. How to explain what we did to them… We put a thick blanket to hide the memories in their minds and not erase them, and when they reunite, it will come off.” There, that’s understandable for the human brain.</p><p>Sirius’ jaw was hanging open. It was quite comical really. Then his eyes narrowed in defiance as he demanded, “What does that have to do with me? You still haven’t told me how this will make my sister go loony!”</p><p>“If you’d just let me finish, when I was placing the blankets on their memories, Sansa was last. Unfortunately, that meant I was quite tired,” he admitted reluctantly. “Her blanket was quite thin. For the past few months, it’s been breaking slowly at the seems. Her memories are peaking through.”</p><p>“Well, that’s good, isn’t it?” Sirius said carelessly. “Sansa is getting what she wanted.”</p><p>“It’s happening too early. They’re supposed to come all at once! Like this,” Death snapped his fingers. </p><p>When Sirius continued to look clueless to why that matters, Death sat down on his furry hind legs.</p><p>“Right now, she is feeling all the pain and loss she’s gone through in her last lifetime. Imagine living a lifetime, going through the motions of heartbreak, death of people close to you and all the pain comes with living. It happens and you mourn and move on. With no memory of why she is feeling this way, she cannot mourn or move on. She simply feels longing for things long dead that she doesn’t remember. The world doesn’t remember. When the souls aren’t cleansed properly, it often leads to miserable people who wallow in bottles, are depressed or end up in the loony bin. 80% of cases of these particular souls kill themselves.”</p><p>Sirius paled at that.</p><p>“Why did you let her remember?” He snapped.</p><p>“There was a collective decision made,” Death replied stiffly. “That since she will be together with family, she won’t be so alone as to, well-” he faltered. “We told them the risk and they wished for this anyways.”</p><p>“So what do you want?” He demanded. “What do you want from me to help my sister? Haven’t you done enough?”</p><p>“We wish for you to simply keep an eye on her in case she resorts to something drastic.”</p><p>Sirius’ fists clenched. Death continued.</p><p>“In the meantime, we are going to speed up their reunion. It was meant to happen in a couple of years but this means that it will need to be more urgent.”</p><p>“Who of her old family is she reuniting with?” Sirius questioned.</p><p>“Her siblings, from the eldest to the youngest. There are four of them. And a cousin who has been raised alongside them.”</p><p>“Tell me about Sansa Stark,” the boy demanded.</p><p>“I’m afraid that we do not speak of past lives with mortals,” Death replied unapologetically.</p><p>“Right, and you’re doing such a good job at that,” Sirius drawled out.</p><p>Death bent his adorable whiskered face to the side. Fair.</p><p>“Fine. Sansa Stark had been a beautiful and stupid little noble girl whose family got destroyed and split up when she was thirteen. She then went through a series of trials that would make the strongest of men falter and came out quite - slytherin. Then Winter came and she died at eighteen.” Death told him the vague overview of Sansa Stark’s life bluntly.</p><p>Sirius' face went grave at hearing that his little sister died so young.</p><p>“So I just make sure she doesn’t, you know… until she is with her other siblings,” his lips pursed.</p><p>“Yes,” the fox grinned revealing sharp teeth. “And then you can go back to pretending she doesn’t exist.”</p><p>The fox slumped dead. Death left as he had given his message and he now had to help put a family back together. Not his usual department. Let it never be said though that he doesn’t fix his mistakes.</p><p>Sirius was left alone with his turbulent thoughts and a fox’s corpse in the middle of the Forbidden Forest.</p><p>~#~</p><p>Sansa looked tired and there were dark bags under her eyes. Her face was even more pale than it usually was in comparison to her hair which was bunched messily in a ponytail. Sirius wondered if the red of her hair was inherited from her past life. </p><p>When she was born, it caused quite a scandal. His father had roared that his mother had slept with a Weasley. Only after a blood test did Orion Black believe that was his daughter. Maybe the fox, or whatever it really was, had pushed for the Starks to retain their names as well. After all, what Black isn’t named after a star? Other than Narcissa, of course. But even then, that was more Black than Sansa.</p><p>James elbowed him in the gut making him spill his pumpkin juice down his chin.</p><p>“What was that for?” He snapped.</p><p>“You haven’t been paying attention, have you?” Remus said softly, giving him disappointed eyes that made him shift in his seat guiltily. “James was just telling us his ideas of where to bring Lily on a Hogsmead date.”</p><p>He made sure to look interested and ooh and awe at the right times as James went into a soliloquy of Lily’s perfection and how she deserves to be given the best date to end all dates so that she considers marrying him in two years time.</p><p>Then, Sansa got up to leave the great hall and he stood up abruptly to follow her, interrupting James’ ‘perfect spot to kiss Lily for the first time’ explanation. He rushed after his estranged sibling to the confusion of his friends.</p><p>“Sansa! Sansa!” He called after her as he jogged. “Wait up!”</p><p>She paused and turned towards him. A shadow crosses her face before it smooths out, inscrutable to strangers. Not to him. Her big blue eyes gave her away showcasing the annoyance she felt.</p><p>“What is it Sirius?” She said, voice tight and controlled.</p><p>“Just wanted to check in on my baby sister! See how she’s doing!” He said with a grin.</p><p>“Well, I’m fine. Thank you for asking.” She turned to leave but he placed a hand on her arm to stop her.</p><p>“You sure? You’re looking a little pale,” he mused. “Exams getting to you?”</p><p>“What’s the game here Sirius?” She demanded, frowning in suspicion. </p><p>He reminded himself that just because the Potters were more his family than the Blacks ever could be doesn’t mean he wants Sansa to die. They hadn’t talked for real in ages so Sirius is really making her suspicious. “What do you want?”</p><p>“Can’t a brother worry for his little sister when she’s a bit under the weather?” He raised his arms in a surrender pose.</p><p>She really wasn’t looking good, he could see from much closer. Her face was ghostly pale but her eyes were puffy red like she had cried all night.</p><p>“As I’ve already told you,” she snapped, tearing her arm out of his loose hold. “I’m fine.”</p><p>Attempt 1: Complete utter failure.</p><p>~#~</p><p>At night, every night, he watches the Marauders Map and vigilantly watches over his sister. Soon he is as pale and sickly looking as she is and his friends exchange worried glances but it pays off. Almost every night, she roams the castle, never caught by prefects and then returns to Slytherin dorms. No secret meeting, or midnight snacks in the kitchen, just wandering on the grounds.</p><p>James, Remus and Peter sit him down for an intervention. </p><p>“You need to stop stalking your sister, mate!” James exclaims, subtle as ever.</p><p>“That’s not what I’m doing! I’m not…” he falters before slumping into his seat. “Is it really that obvious?”</p><p>“Yes!” He replied emphatically with Peter nodding nervously behind James.</p><p>“There have been some weird rumours going around because of it,” Remus offered.</p><p>“Tell me every one of them,” Sirius answered with a large rakish grin to the delight of James who laughed at his friend’s indecency.</p><p>By the end of the night, Sirius has learned the most vile rumours he’s ever heard about him with his sister involved. His sister of all people!</p><p>By the end of the night, Sirius also has recruited three new allies to the Sansa needs our help squad. They weren’t doing it for her, a Slytherin but for their brother and best friend, they would keep an eye on her.</p><p>~#~</p><p>“Leave her alone, Black!” Barty Crouch Jr. attempted to flex menacingly but only ended up looking like an overgrown ferret. “Or I’ll curse you with boiles! Sansa doesn’t want anything to do with you lions!”</p><p>He stood between them, a twisted version of Prince Charming protecting a vulnerable princess. Except this princess didn’t need his protection, she needed to be protected from him. He knew exactly what type of crowd Crouch Jr. ran with and he didn’t want his sister involved with them. She’s always been impressionable.</p><p>His sister had her back to him as she sat in her seat in the potions classroom. He had just wanted to check in with her before she went to class. Even though every time he does this, her eyes narrow in suspicion and she tries to avoid him with more fervour.</p><p>James and Remus backed him up, one hand on their wands, making it quite clear that if he followed through with his threat, it wouldn’t end well for him.</p><p>“My sister,” Sirius stressed, “can speak for herself, thank you very much.”</p><p>He shoved his way past Crouch Jr. to Sansa and laid his hand on her shoulder to ask her if they can talk privately but she shoved his arm violently away as if his touch burned her and jumped out of her seat.</p><p>“Don’t touch me!” She yelled, everyone in the classroom watched the scene as she moved, eyes wild, not seeing him at all.</p><p>“Bloody hell!” Someone exclaims. He’s not sure who, it might be James but honestly he’s a bit too busy right now to care. She was showing more emotion in this moment than she has in the last five years she’s been at Hogwarts.</p><p>“Sansa, it’s me! Sirius!” He tries to get closer to her but she flinches away. And he knows she can’t see him. She isn’t flinching away from him but from whatever she was hallucinating. This was different. This was close to madness.</p><p>“I’m not going to hurt you!” He tells her as he holds her shoulders to stop her from squirming away.</p><p>“Do you really think I’m stupid enough to ever trust lions again,” she hisses, teeth bared.</p><p>Her face slackens, her eyes lose their venom and he can see the confusion fill them. Sansa notices the quiet classroom’s many eyes on her for the first time and flushing red, she runs out of the class.</p><p>~#~</p><p>“So she was like ‘do you think I’ll ever put my trust in lions again!’” Sirius mimicked his sister’s voice. “She wasn’t herself at all! Sansa is literally a puppet, no emotions or opinions that aren’t what mommy dearest wants! She doesn’t make scenes!”</p><p>The Fox, this time Bird, looked at him pensively. He shivered, it was rather unnerving to see animals that aren’t adorable like dogs, cats and stags show such human expressions.</p><p>“Well, that does sound like something Sansa Stark might say-”</p><p>“My friends thought it was just her time of the month and she was pissed to be touched by a blood traitor!” </p><p>“Yes, well I could see why she would not want to be touched by you. You don’t smell very good,” the Bird continued speaking even as Sirius’ face turned into a tomato. “In her last life, there was a noble house called the Lannister’s who held the sigil of a lion. The Lannister’s brought great harm upon the Stark family. I fear that not knowing who they are or what they had done but knowing that she hated the lions, it confused her into associating Gryffindors with Lannisters.”</p><p>Sirius looked down and bit his lip.</p><p>“So it’s getting worse?”</p><p>“Not necessarily, it just means that she has gone beyond nightmares and gut feelings to outright mixing her two lives together. We’ve always known she’d reach this stage but we didn’t think it’d happen so very quickly.” The Bird sighed. </p><p>“It’s gotten past the stage of just checking in on her, I need to do more,” Sirius insisted, a dark look in his eye.</p><p>“You’re right, we need someone to support her until the Starks are reunited. But she doesn’t trust you, I’m thinking of bringing in Narcissa Black in the summer as Sansa is more likely to trust her over you.” The Bird mused.</p><p>“No!” Sirius exclaimed. “Sansa is my sister, Narcissa might even tell her fiancé who could tell you-know-who!” Sansa might become a target for that man’s madness. Merlin saggy tits knows that she has enough already to worry about.</p><p>“Then gain her trust by the end of the year. If not, it’s Narcissa’s turn.” He said firmly.</p><p>Sirius nodded mutinously. </p><p>“Fox, what did the Lannisters do to my sister’s other family?” He hastily added. “Just so I could look for signs that she’s remembering things about them, or well, anything from Westeros, you called it?”  Apparently it was a long forgotten name for Europe back in the Middle Ages, that’s what the Bird said, about the land his sister hailed from.</p><p>The Bird looked at him, scrutinizing him deeply, and gave chilling proclamations.</p><p>“Joffrey Lannister, Sansa’s fiance at one point, had her father executed. Jaime Lannister pushed her little brother out of a tower leaving his legs useless. Tywin Lannister had her mother and older brother murdered at a wedding. Cersei Lannister kept your sister hostage for years where she was beaten and humiliated daily. Need I go on? I have more.” The Bird said, somehow managing to give a nasty grin while sounding as bored as they come.</p><p>Sirius shook his head wordlessly. His fists were shaking and he wanted nothing more than to curse these Lannister bastards with the cruciatus curse for beating his sister.</p><p>~#~</p><p>“Sirius, may I speak to you?” His sister asked between gritted teeth. “Privately?”</p><p>Will wonders ever cease? He’s been badgering her the same way he used to do so as a child to convince her to follow him on adventures, now he did so just to force his way back into her life. He feared it wasn’t working, this strategy but that was obviously foolish of him because it hadn’t failed him yet. And it wasn’t failing him now.</p><p>He shared a glance with the Marauders, Peter frowning nervously at the floor, not meeting his eyes, James shaking his head no, and Remus' obvious reluctance to let him go off with her alone and Sirius turned towards her and quipped to his sister, “After you!”</p><p>The three of them had tired of trying to befriend Sansa, not knowing why they were doing so, only knowing that Sirius was obsessively worried about her and she wanted nothing to do with him or any of them. Which she’s made extremely clear, the potions incident came to mind. James privately thought Sirius was trying to stop her from becoming a Death Eater. Either way, she didn’t want their help.</p><p>Sansa led him to an empty classroom, and once he was inside, she promptly locked it. She turned towards him quietly with ice cold eyes. Sirius couldn’t help but gulp. This was all starting to feel vaguely threatening and maybe he should have listened to his friends.</p><p>“Why are you following me everywhere?” She spoke clearly, hands clasped together on her skirt in a ladylike fashion.</p><p>“You know why, you have to know that I’m worried about you Sansa,” he said exasperated.</p><p>“Let me rephrase that, why are you acting as if you are worried about me now.”</p><p>“Are you kidding? You look as if you haven’t slept in days and a gust of wind can knock you over. Why else would I be worried!” He hoped he looked sufficiently angry at her lack of self care. Don’t be any more suspicious, he begged internally.</p><p>Sansa gazed at him coldly and she felt never more like a stranger than in this moment.</p><p>“I don’t know but sometimes when I’m trying to understand a person’s motive I play a little game. I assume the worst. What’s the worst reason you have for caring about me all of a sudden,” she said the last sentence, clearly not believing a word of it. “I came to the conclusion that the worst motive you can possibly have is that you’re a spy.”</p><p>A jolt went through him. She knows, or at least she’s too close to the truth.</p><p>“You’ve been Dumbledore’s man for many years now. With your ties to our family, you’re trying to get an in, to get information on Death Eater activity out of us. Out of me.”</p><p>“No! No, no, no, no!” He said hurriedly. “That’s not it at all!”</p><p>“Really? Because I am clearly the weak link. We were close as children, I’m here at Hogwarts with you. You’re my older brother. I’m younger, so you might think I’m naive.”</p><p>“I’m not trying to get information out of you!” He said loudly. “I’m worried about you! The people you’re friends with - they’re bad people! Bellatrix, Crouch Jr., Malfoy, Snape! Those Death Eaters in training are dragging you down! I don’t want you having only those people to turn to.”</p><p>This was all true, he realized. The past month of stalking his sister, he saw her alone, no friends but standing just on the outside of the same group of acquaintances that he knew were up to no good. He worried constantly for her future, if she would be pressured into becoming a Death Eater or a wife to one by them, his family, or  Voldemort himself. He had pushed it to the back of his brain as it was one of their least worrying problems overall but still… She was his little sister.</p><p>“I’m trying to show you that you have me too! I’m here! If you don’t want to be branded by that snake, you can come to me!”</p><p>Maybe it was the fierceness of his tone, or that she could see no lies in his eyes but the stern face she made slowly came undone to let her vulnerabilities and tells be shown.</p><p>She was falling apart, he thought, morose. Sirius watched his sister’s mask crumble and for the first since that dratted hat sorted her into Slytherin, he could see the baby sister he used to play with. </p><p>She rushed into his arms, landing with an oof, but it didn’t matter as she began to cry, large, shoulder shaking sobs into his chest. That day they missed the rest of their classes and she whispered between his arms of dreams, terrible and beautiful alike, dreams of ice blue monsters, iron thrones forged of swords and giant wolves. Of feeling trapped and on her guard wherever she went. Of weirwood trees with faces carved in. And of a longing pulling at her heartstrings making her unable to do anything but choke on how powerful it was.</p>
