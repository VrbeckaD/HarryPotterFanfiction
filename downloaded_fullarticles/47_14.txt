    <p>“What’s first on the list then, son?” Lyall put a hand on Remus’ shoulder as he peered down at the list in his hands.<br/>
“Um, three sets of plain black work robes…” Remus read aloud.<br/>
His father nodded. “Madam Malkin’s does that best,” he began to steer his family towards the shop when he felt his wife pull on his sleeve.<br/>
“Are you sure, Ly? Can’t he have some of yours? I expect they’ll be expensive here,”<br/>
“Don’t be ridiculous, Hope. The boy deserves his own set of robes. Her prices aren’t ridiculous; I’m sure it will be fine,”<br/>
It was relatively quiet at Diagon Alley. The only sign of activity was shopkeepers getting everything ready for the hustle and bustle of wizards and witches that would occur in about a week. Most people were still on holiday or hadn’t really thought about school supplies yet. It would come later for them, but not for the Lupin family. They’d come early for two reasons: in hope of getting any offers there might be for early-birds and to avoid the madness of the entire population of Hogwarts buying all they need at once. They hadn’t actually been in any shops yet, but from the near silence of the crooked street, it seemed their plan was going smoothly.<br/>
“Lyall!” Hope fretted, pulling her husband’s sleeve again. “Someone’s in there!”<br/>
Lyall glanced at his son, who didn’t seem overly worried – a little tense, but more curious than anything as he peered through the window at the small girl stood on a stool as a short witch fussed around her. There was no one else in there.<br/>
Lyall sighed. “It’s one little girl. Honestly Hope, you’re more worried than Remus is. Maybe he’ll make a friend. Come on, we’re going in,” he decided firmly as he led the way into the shop.<br/>
Madam Malkin turned around and smiled at them as they walked in.<br/>
“Mr Lupin! I haven’t seen you around here for a while. What brings you back to us? Ah!” Her smile widened as she spotted Remus behind him. “Bringing the next of the Lupins, are we? Good, good.”<br/>
Lyall nodded and smiled in greeting, nudging Remus forward slightly. Hope hurriedly interjected.<br/>
“If you’re busy, Miss,” she nodded to the girl stood on the stool with measuring tapes floating around her. “We can come back–”<br/>
“No, not at all!” Madam Malkin smiled. “I can do two at once; it’s not a problem.”<br/>
Remus hadn’t realised he was staring at the girl until he saw she was smiling at him. He managed to quickly smile back before focusing on his shoes. It was hard to tell with her on the stool, but he figured she was just over a head smaller than him. She had a lot of soft, curly brown hair that seemed to hover around her face like a halo.<br/>
Madam Malkin ushered him over to another stool next to the girl for him to step onto. He prayed he wouldn’t fall and embarrass himself.<br/>
“How much are your robes, if you don’t mind me asking?” Hope enquired.<br/>
Before Madam Malkin could reply, Lyall’s head snapped up.<br/>
“Merlin, I left my wallet in the bar! Come on, Hope. Remus, hang on there, we’ll be back as soon as we can.” He dragged Hope out of the shop before she or Remus could argue and the two of them hurried down the cobbled street. Madam Malkin chuckled quietly.<br/>
She began taking Remus’ measurements, smiling kindly as she told him: “You’re tall for you age. I expect you’ll grow to be as tall as your father.” Remus gave her a small smile.<br/>
“I’ll be back with some more material,” she said to the two children before bustling away to the back of the shop. Remus wondered why she didn’t just summon some, but he didn’t ask, of course.<br/>
“Hello,” the girl said suddenly. She held out her hand past the floating tape measures and pieces of fabric. “I’m Dorcas. Dorcas Meadowes.” Remus noticed her perfect smile and white teeth as she beamed at him, before shaking her hand.<br/>
“Remus. Remus Lupin,” he smiled back at her.<br/>
“You’re early, probably for the best. It gets awfully busy here when everyone is around,” she nodded wisely. “Were they your parents?”<br/>
Remus nodded. “They wanted to come early to avoid the rush. Are your parents here too?” He realised the girl had been alone in here since he arrived, apart from Madam Malkin.<br/>
She shook her head. “I don’t know where they are. I’ve never met them,” she stated calmly. “They left me in the Leaky Cauldron, or we think so. No one actually saw anyone or myself until I started crying on one of the bar tables. I’ve been here ever since.”<br/>
“Oh, I’m sorry,” Remus hoped he hadn’t upset her by asking. Goodness, he was awful at making friends. He’d spend his school life completely alone at this rate. To his relief, Dorcas simply shrugged.<br/>
“It’s alright, I never knew them. I don’t feel like you can properly miss something if you’ve never even had it.” She seemed very mature for someone so young. She reminded Remus of himself. “Besides, I get all the inside knowledge and best offers of Diagon Alley. I stay at the Leaky Cauldron too, which is fun. Tom’s nice as well: everyone is here.”<br/>
Remus nodded. He supposed the man at the bar that had let them through was Tom. He did seem very friendly.<br/>
“Hey, how would you like to come for ice cream with me at Fortescue’s after we’ve got our robes? It wouldn’t spoil lunch or anything, it’s only ten o’clock,” she added upon noting the hesitant look on Remus’ face.<br/>
He shuffled his feet awkwardly. “I, um, I’m not sure we have spare money for ice cream,”<br/>
“Oh, that’s okay,” Dorcas brushed the matter off. “Florean’s very nice; we’re good friends. He always gives me free ice cream, I’m sure he’ll give you some too.”<br/>
Remus perked up. “Okay then,” he grinned.<br/>
By the time his parents had returned, Madam Malkin had finished both their robes. Hope helped Remus fold his as Dorcas went to pay for hers. She whispered subtly to the witch as she handed over her coins.<br/>
“I don’t think they have much, could you give them a lower price and I’ll save up for the difference?”<br/>
Madam Malkin beamed at her. This girl’s boundless kindness never ceased to fill her with admiration. She nodded and winked at the small girl who smiled and hurried back to Remus. Before Lyall had even opened his wallet, he and his wife heard the tinkle of the bell and two sets of feet running out of the shop.<br/>
“Remus! Where is he going?” Hope looked flustered, even Lyall seemed nervous at his son’s sudden departure.<br/>
“Don’t worry, I heard them planning to go for ice cream. It’s only a few shops down from here, they’re not far away,” Madam Malkin assured the fretting parents.<br/>
Hope nodded, a little less panicked. “Who was that girl, anyway?”<br/>
“She’s called Dorcas Meadowes, Miss,”<br/>
“I know that name,” Lyall’s brow creased as he searched his mind for where he recognised her name.<br/>
“You probably read about her in the papers, sir,” Madam Malkin said as she wrapped Remus’ robes in brown paper to protect them. “A while ago now, but it was all the talk: baby left at the Leaky Cauldron, big search for the parents or whoever had left her there. They never found them,”<br/>
“Ah, of course,” Lyall nodded. “’The Child of Diagon Alley’ they called her,”<br/>
“Oh, how terrible for her,” Hope frowned.<br/>
Madam Malkin shrugged with a small smile. “It’s alright, really. She seems quite happy here, and we all take care of her, especially Tom,”<br/>
“I’m sure you do,” Lyall smiled. “Thank you again, Madam Malkin, are you sure about the price? It seems quite low…” he trailed off as Hope elbowed him lightly.<br/>
“No, you caught my early-bird sale,” Madam Malkin smiled.<br/>
She waved as they left the shop, resolving to not remind Dorcas to pay the extra.<br/>
“Hello, Florean, how are you?”<br/>
The ice cream seller looked down over his till at the two small children smiling up at him.<br/>
“Hello there, Dorcas my dear, I’m very well, thank you. School shopping, are we? Who’s this?” he nodded at Remus who was stood close beside her.<br/>
She nodded. “We’ve stopped for a refuel of ice cream. This is my friend, Remus,” Remus felt his stomach warm at this comment. “I told him we should come here, as you have the best ice cream there is,”<br/>
“I certainly do,” Fortescue grinned proudly. “Well then, any friend of yours, Dorky, is a friend of mine. I’ll give whatever you two’d like for free!”<br/>
Remus’ smile widened and Dorcas nudged him as she whispered: “Told you,” with a smirk.</p>
