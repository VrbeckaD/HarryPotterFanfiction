    <p>Teddy: Hi? Who is this? </p><p>James: We met at that club on Hillcrest? This is Connor, right?<br/>
James: Thanks for finally responding. I was getting a complex over here.</p><p>Teddy: Sorry. I dunno who Connor is.<br/>
Teddy: I'm not the person you're looking for. </p><p>James: Well, that's shit. </p><p>Teddy: Sorry, dude. </p><p>James:  It's fine. Never been given a fake number before, though. Now I'm going to get a complex for that instead.<br/>
James: My ego...it hurts. </p><p>Teddy: Ah, that really sucks. Your poor ego.<br/>
Teddy: Props to this 'Connor' bloke for managing to give you a private number. Effectively scared the crap out of me. </p><p>James:  Ooh, private number. Didn't know we had a VIP over here.<br/>
James: That was sarcasm, by the way. I know it's hard to tell over text, but I'm fluent in it. Pretty sure 98% of what I say is sarcastic, so let's get that out of the way now.<br/>
James:  So. I'm bored as all hell, and I just got my pride beaten to a pulp, so seeing as your number was the one that hurt me so...I think it's your duty to appease me. Build my ego back up.  </p><p>Teddy: Oh, God. I'm absolutely not a VIP, that is some bullshit. I don't consider myself Important in any way, shape, or form.<br/>
Teddy: I cannot possibly reconstruct your entire ego, I don't even know you. You could be eleven years old for all I know. You're probably not, but. </p><p>James:  Blimey, I was joking. That just sounded entirely depressing. I'm sure you're worth something.<br/>
James: Yeah, I'm an eleven year old that frequents clubs. I can barely see over the bar but they're like "Aw, mate, it's okay. Here, have a pint."<br/>
James: I'm 18 for the record.<br/>
James: Pretty smart, but my laziness keeps me from making top marks. So, you win some, you lose some. Bloody brilliant at football though.  </p><p>Teddy: 18, fun. Quite the time to be alive, with all the... Uni. And sudden realisation that you now have to adult for yourself. Fun. </p><p>James:  Ahh, bugger, you just sounded like an old bloke.<br/>
James: Dare I ask?<br/>
James: Are you a 50 year old pedo?<br/>
James: I'm all for older men, but there's a line. </p><p>Teddy: Yes, that's me, the 50 year old pedo that you accidentally contacted.<br/>
Teddy: No, I'm 23. </p><p>James:  Oi, you never know.<br/>
James: I could have been connected to anyone.<br/>
James: 23. And this cynical? You must be a hoot at parties. </p><p>Teddy: It's the after effects of university and too much time online.<br/>
Teddy: You'll have to rip my cynical tendencies from my cold, dead, adpocalypsed millenial hands. </p><p>James:  Mm, now we're getting somewhere.<br/>
James: I like that spark.<br/>
James: You seem less stale now. You always like that? Have to be yanked from your shell? 
James: I'm going to shrink you now.<br/>
James:  Lemme guess...an extrovert that hides in an introvert's clothing? </p><p>Teddy: That 'spark' is actually called 'reality.' Fun, huh?<br/>
Teddy: I am always like this, yes. Outgoing in certain circles, generally.<br/>
Teddy: Major ambivert. </p><p>James:  Reality? Never heard of her.<br/>
James: I like that, actually. Layered. Complicated. Mysterious. Be still my heart. </p><p>Teddy: Okay, that's dramatic. I'm not layered, complicated or mysterious. Just a tad socially inept and bad with in-person interaction. </p><p>James:  I'm a very dramatic person. Theatrical, really. It's a pity I am shit at acting and can't memorize to save my life, or I could have made a damn good career out of performing.<br/>
James: Socially inept is my kink.<br/>
James: I mean it, though. You don't give yourself enough credit, mate. Besides, it's the digital age. Don't need to thrive on in-person interaction.<br/>
James: So far, you're a better conversationalist than Connor was. He wasn’t much more than a pretty face with a brilliant arse. </p><p>Teddy: "Socially inept is my kink" sounds like something that I'd have written on a t-shirt and it'd sell hundred of copies. Just saying.<br/>
Teddy: Thank God for the digital age, honestly. All the important shit I have to say can be done online. Coming out in person? Don't know her.<br/>
Teddy: Connor sounds painfully dull. What I lack in, uh, conventional attractiveness, I make up for in conversationalism (and vocab, apparently.) </p><p>James: You need to give me a share of the profits, you thief.<br/>
James: Sneaky way to push your sexual orientation in there. I have to say, I'm pleased.<br/>
James: Conventional attractiveness, you say? Not a fan, actually. </p><p>Teddy: Sigh, fine. I'll find another to pay my rent.<br/>
Teddy: Thank you, thank you, I saw my opportunity and I took it.<br/>
Teddy: To be fair, majority of the things that make me less 'conventionally attractive' were personal decisions. </p><p>James:  That sounds sneakily like what I find extremely attractive. This gets better by the minute.</p><p>Teddy: Is that so? Care to elaborate? </p><p>James:  Colour.<br/>
James: That sounds odd on its own. Let me expand.<br/>
James: Coloured tats. Especially sleeves. Fucking hell, yes.<br/>
James: Coloured hair. The more unnatural the better.<br/>
James: Ah, and tell me you have a lip ring and I'll literally jizz. Excuse the crass, but I'm not sorry. </p><p>Teddy: Uh huh. Interesting, interesting.<br/>
Teddy: Should I be apologising for my lack of tattoo sleeve? </p><p>James:  No, no, my new favorite ambivert, I won't hold it against you.<br/>
James: Are you not denying the others?  </p><p>Teddy: I'm definitely not denying the others. </p><p>James:  Blimey.<br/>
James: You own my heart, mate. </p><p>Teddy: On your scale of unnatural hair colours, where does bright blue fall? </p><p>James:  I'm swooning. </p><p>Teddy: That's cute.<br/>
Teddy: How d'ya feel about septum rings? Industrial ear piercings?<br/>
James:  This is like porn to me.<br/>
James: "Baby, let's talk body mods."  </p><p>Teddy: Oh, lovely. </p><p>James:  I can't tell if that's sarcasm, so you've got me there.<br/>
James: I've bared my soul here.<br/>
James: Give me something back.<br/>
James: I'm now afraid I'd be disappointing to you. </p><p>Teddy: I don't think I have any specific requirements? Like. If I'm attracted to someone then I'm attracted to them.<br/>
Teddy: I don't know. There's certain stuff that's frequent with the people I'm into.<br/>
Teddy: The messy hair thing.<br/>
Teddy: Kind of broody but only vaguely? I don't know. </p><p>James:  Well, I have a few tats and gauges, but my parents were pretty anti. I plan on getting more, but it's all fairly tame for now.<br/>
James: Ahh, I have chronically messy hair. It's pretty much bedhead or just-fucked hair 24/7. 
James: So, if that's your thing I'm here for it.<br/>
James: Skinny as all hell, but also a lite tone from football. Strong ass legs, you can imagine. 
James: And glasses. My father gave me shit eyes.  </p><p>Teddy: Gauges. Nice. Into that.<br/>
Teddy: Oh. My God. Insane hair + glasses. Why are you actually, like, suddenly the love of my life? </p><p>James:  Right back at you, handsome.<br/>
James: Kismet, mate.<br/>
James: I'm James. </p><p>Teddy: Oh, you have a cool person name. Mine’s... the opposite of that.<br/>
Teddy: Actually, my chosen name is better than my legal name, but still? I'm Teddy. </p><p>James:  James is a cool person name to you? You need to get out more.<br/>
James: Hahaha, that's brilliant actually. Is the nickname because of Teddy Lupin? Matching hair, need matching names too?<br/>
James: What's your given name then? That bland? Can't be more boring than James.  </p><p>Teddy: It’s just always been my nickname, I guess. </p><p>James:  That's funny. So is it Theodore? Edward?<br/>
James: Both are equally embarrassing.<br/>
James: You can admit it to me. What you lack in cool name you make up for in brilliant conversation and beauty.</p><p>Teddy: Hah. Blegh, you got me, it's Edward. I hate it too, you can laugh. </p><p>James:  I won't. My name is James. We're on a level playing field. My brother's name is Albus which is far cooler than James. I got the shaft.<br/>
James: You have siblings? </p><p>Teddy: Nah, I like your name. Better than Edward. I think my parents just wanted me to be the least cool person in the world?<br/>
Teddy: No siblings, though. Thank God. My parents would've given them shit names as well. Like... Dorothy. Or Richard. </p><p>James:  You took that and shoved it up their arse. Made yourself far cooler.<br/>
James: HA! So true.<br/>
James: I have the one brother. And a sister - Lily. </p><p>Teddy: At least your parents dished out some adequate names.<br/>
Teddy: My parents were probably just pissy that they've both got weird ass names so they had to give me the blandest fucking name they could find. </p><p>James:  Well, Teddy's cool. I like that nickname.<br/>
James: And I've liked talking to you. Same area code, so I assume we're close. Would it be weird if I invited you for a drink? </p><p>Teddy: It wouldn't be weird, but. I don't think I'd be able to say yes. </p><p>James:  Oh. Right.<br/>
James: Yeah, no, it's fine.<br/>
James: Stupid of me for thinking you'd be single.  </p><p>Teddy: No. No, no.<br/>
Teddy: I am single.<br/>
Teddy: I just don't think I should say yes. It's nothing personal! Just that I can't. </p><p>James:  Can I ask why? I'm not sure my ego can take being rejected twice in the same week. </p><p>Teddy: It's.. kinda complicated.<br/>
Teddy: There was something you said earlier that really threw me off and. There's a chance that, uh.<br/>
Teddy: You may know of me. Like, me behind these texts. </p><p>James:  Okay? James: Not speaking your language here. It's honestly fine, though. I'm being stupid. We can be the digital equivalent of pen pals.<br/>
James: No, on second thought, it's going to bother me.<br/>
James: You a student teacher at my uni or something? I'm pretty sure that doesn't fall under the ethics code of professor/student relationships if you're still a student yourself.  </p><p>Teddy: Fuck, I'm just going to have to tell you, aren't I?<br/>
Teddy: This is gonna be weird. Kill me. Just kill me. </p><p>James:  Remember when you told me I was dramatic? Well...pot, meet kettle.  </p><p>Teddy: Ha-ha.<br/>
Teddy: Look. Earlier you asked me if my nickname is inspired by Teddy Lupin. </p><p>James:  And?<br/>
James: It is?<br/>
James: Riveting, really. Seriously scandalous. </p><p>Teddy: Oh my God. NO.<br/>
Teddy: I AM Teddy Lupin. Christ. </p><p>James:  Oh, come on, mate. If you're going to catfish me, you can do better than that. 
James: I don't fear rejection THAT bad. Blimey.</p><p>Teddy: Cool, then, you don't have to believe me. </p><p>James:  Oi. Now you're just being childish.  </p><p>Teddy: I'm really not?<br/>
Teddy: Whatever, it's fine if you think I'm making shit up, but, y'know. There it is. Do with that information what you may. </p><p>James:  Okay. Then I guess that's that.<br/>
James: Sorry to have wasted your time.</p><p>Teddy: Mhm. Sorry to have wasted yours.. </p><p>James:  Wasn't a waste. Was having fun until then.<br/>
James: Needed the pick-me-up. You provided it. I'll just delete the last bit from my memory and keep the good shit. </p><p>Teddy: Just putting it out there that had you believe me when I was honest with you about why I was hesitant to meet up and been cool about it, I would have agreed to meet up? </p><p>James:  Mate, listen, what are the odds that I mention him then you happen to be him?<br/>
James: I'd be fine with it if you were. More than. He seems like a genuine bloke. I'm not a fucking fanboy. I just think his music is cool. I don't know what you expected to happen?<br/>
James: What turns me off to YOU is the lying. And thinking I'm that stupid. Think about it....I get a wrong number from a guy in a club, then I mention Teddy Lupin to the person I'm texting, who seemed interested...then they happen to BE Teddy Lupin? Come on, mate. Just stop. </p><p>Teddy: I really don't know what you want me to say here. I don't see why I'd have any reason to lie.<br/>
Teddy: I talked about my hair colour and all my specific piercings before I knew you know of me, which.. If I was lying about who I am based on you mentioning me, that wouldn't add up.<br/>
Teddy: And a bunch of other stuff. Private number, because of last year when my old number got leaked.<br/>
Teddy: Or when I said you'd have to pry my cynical tendencies from my cold, dead "adpocalyped" millennial hands?<br/>
Teddy: That was all just me talking about things going on in my life, but sure. Whatever. Fine. Have a nice day. </p><p>James:  Okay, I see your points here. But the chances are a million to one here.<br/>
James: Look, I get it, right? My mum is a famous football star on the England team, and my dad is a prominent police commissioner that has handled high profile cases. I'm not new to small fame. Nor am I new to liars. My last name tends to rile people up.<br/>
James: So, believe me when I say this is not some fanboy freak out. I've just been told a lot of lies in my lifetime. Ways to get in with me for my name. When you're so used to people like that it's hard to trust.<br/>
James: I'm not trying to be a git here. But you realize what you're telling me is ridiculously hard to believe? </p><p>Teddy: I guess I see why it'd be difficult to believe, but I don't know what else to tell you to get you to believe me. I know that I'm telling the truth, and it's fine if you think I'm lying.<br/>
Teddy: I've laid all my cards out at this point. There's not much else I can offer up for you to believe that I'm who I say I am. </p><p>James:  Alright.<br/>
James: Alright, so if you change your mind about meeting up, I'll give it a go.  </p><p>Teddy: Okay, then. Let's meet up.<br/>
</p><p>James:  Okay.<br/>
James: Tavern on Storrow?<br/>
James: 8 o'clock?</p><p>Teddy: Sounds like a plan. </p><p>James:  See you then.</p>
