    <p align="justify">A brown-haired boy was walking down the streets of London, his deep green eyes paying attention to every small detail. It was the seventh time he has been called to the Ministry of Magic, they were trying to recruit him as an Auror. But even though he was feeling that it was the right path for him, he couldn’t let himself become one. He felt that he would, again, be forced to do what was <em>right</em>, not what he wanted. To condemn the people dragged into the wrong path instead of helping them. He would do what anyone always did with him, judge and decide, without letting him speak. Then, he would become like them all. And he never wanted that. But the pressure he was constantly receiving from the Ministry of Magic was hard to live with, and he was starting to think that, maybe, he should do as they wanted, do what people wanted him to do, because he was <em>the boy who lived</em>.</p><p align="justify">He couldn’t help but wonder what his parents or Sirius would have told him. He clenched his hand around his wand, in his pocket. All he wanted was to be able to get advice from his loved ones, but no one seemed to understand, and the only ones who could have were dead. Even Mione told him that he should become an Auror because he was the symbol of a generation, the one who defeated the dark forces. And Harry Potter knew that, and it was another reason why he was so sad because his own life was not really his. It was an object, a symbol, a common property. His existence was here to remind the wizards of the war, of Voldemort, of the fact that they won. But he was tired of all of that. All he wanted was to find a nice job, away from all this frenzy. He has lost so much, he was exhausted. Exhausted of people loving him just because he was breathing, exhausted of people mystifying him, calling him a living legend while he was not perfect, exhausted of people smiling at him, treating him like he was made of glass. He was not a precious little thing that needed to be loved, he needed to be let alone. Not to have his picture in the journal every damn day.</p><p align="justify">As he was looking around, a bird caught his attention, flying weirdly, he must have been caught by a cat. That was exactly how he was feeling, like a little stupid bird, in the middle of cats, waiting for him to make the smallest move to catch him. So he was standing still, not daring to move, barely breathing. It has been a few years since the war was finished. Two to be exact. But it seemed like the memories would never let him go. And the people would never stop to tell him about it either.</p><p align="justify">While he was walking, looking at the sky, he felt a body hit his, making him fall, letting a gasp out. He stood quickly back on his feet, running his hand through his hair, making them even messier. Apologizing, he put his eyes on the person he just hit, still on the floor.</p><p align="justify">“<em><b>I-I am so sorry, I was lost in my thoughts… exc...</b></em>” he stopped, a surprised look on his face. This look on his face, this platinum blonde hair, this cold glare. He seemed as surprised as him. They were both here, staring at each other, not daring to say a word. Harry’s voice seemed to have disappeared, his barely opened lips were trying to let a sound out.</p><p align="justify">The blonde man noticed the surprised look on the face of the man standing before him. He had a smirk, his slim lips taking the shape of a smile. “<em><b>Potter...</b></em>” He just said as he used to. He seemed to be a little bit different than before, noticed Harry. But the war probably changed him, it changed all of them.</p><p align="justify">It made the green-eyed man come back to his senses, noticing the muggles looking at them suspiciously. He gave his hand to this man he hated so much. “<em><b>Malfoy.</b></em>” Seeing him made the sorcerer feel a bittersweet feeling. He reminded him of the good times at Hogwarts, but also of the fight, and all the hard times. Especially the hard times.</p><p align="justify">Once the Slytherin grabbed his hand, he pulled to make him stand on his feet. Clenching his hand around his wrist, he talked to him. “<em><b>We are bringing attention to us, follow me Malfoy.</b></em>” He said it with a colder voice he intended to, but with his old enemy, there was no need to fake it. He dragged him into a smaller street, there, they could talk without being interrupted. His glare over the <em>death eater</em> was only filled with despise and animosity. The Slytherin knew it was easy to read it in his usually laughing green eyes, now cold. And he never intended to hide it, he did not want to. “<em><b>What are you doing here, Malfoy? You should be hiding with your dear friends the death eaters before the Aurors find you all.</b></em>” He was staring at him, perfectly aware that he was being hurtful in purpose. But after all, Draco Malfoy was one of the reasons he suffered so much.</p><p align="justify">Noticing the look Malfoy slid on his hand, still around Draco’s wrist, Harry hastily let him go. Recovering the usage of his hand, he massaged his wrist distractedly, revealing a red mark left by Potter’s grip. Still avoiding his eyes, he talked with his usual distinguished voice. “<em><b>I know you’re afraid to let me go, Potter, but you didn’t have to grab me that hard, did you?</b></em>”. This little pretentious voice annoyed the Gryffindor more than he would have thought. “<em><b>And why don’t you look at me when you’re speaking, Malfoy?</b></em>” Saying that he grabbed Draco’s chin, making him face Harry, and raise his eyes. “<em><b>Are you afraid?</b></em>” Without moving his face a bit, Draco swiped the savior’s hand off his face, with a disgusted look. But Potter had time to see his cold glaze slide on his lips. “<em><b>Do not touch me, Potter.</b></em>”</p><p align="justify">A slow smile took place on the brown-haired boy’s face. “<em><b>Oh, really, Malfoy?</b></em>”</p>
