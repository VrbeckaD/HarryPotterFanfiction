    <p> </p><p>"What if the Hat sorts us in two different houses?" Molly asked Yasha.</p><p> </p><p>"Then we won't sleep in the same dormitory and won’t attend classes at the same time."</p><p> </p><p>"But what if..."</p><p> </p><p>"Molly." Yasha snapped.</p><p> </p><p>Silence overtook their compartment.</p><p> </p><p>"Everything’s going to be fine. We are going to get sorted, get to class, make some friends, make some enemies, play Quidditch, watch Quidditch and fret about exams. Are we clear?" Yasha barked at Molly.</p><p> </p><p>It wasn't very like her, but Molly did not blame her. She was probably just as stressed as he was. Everyone launching into the unknown, like this at barely twelve. Even if they had an idea of what they were going to do.</p><p> </p><p>Learn magic, Molly sighed, allowing himself to be lost in thought. To cast spells and brew potions. That's what Yasha's mother had said. At least, Molly had felt a bit reassured. Somehow, somewhere, a part of him was considered normal. Even if being part of the circus made that kids they encountered often called them freaks, Molly had always felt even more so.</p><p> </p><p>The Hogwarts Letter hadn't really been the worst part, thanks to Yasha and her witch mother who was able to explain to them what was happening.</p><p> </p><p>"What if they have me under my other name?" Molly whispered.</p><p> </p><p>"Mum sent a letter. They are honouring your wishes on that front, I'm certain. Professor De Rolo is a nice Headmaster according to Mum. Let's trust him."</p><p> </p><p>"What if..."</p><p> </p><p>"You're not going to make any friends at school if you continuously spout what ifs!" Yasha interrupted. She then proceeded to retrieve a book, Defense Against the Dark Arts, and started to read it.</p><p> </p><p>Well, it was a train, there were nowhere to Yasha-out to.</p><p> </p><p>She was right, though. Maybe he ought to be more trustful, more confident. If anyone knew he was scared, they would tease him. Yasha was right. He had to toughen up.</p><p>He had to hide his weakness, but how?</p><p> </p><p>Molly didn’t have the time to think about it more. Someone suddenly opened the door of their compartment and slammed it behind them.</p><p> </p><p>They were tall and lanky, so much that Molly doubted they were in their first year. They wore a faded brown jumper and jeans whose holes had been patched with mismatched fabric. Their ginger hair cascaded around their head and when they turned around, their big, round, piercing blue eyes took in their surroundings and filled with a certain kind of anxiety that reminded Molly of the youngest child in the circus, Toya. Toya when she was asked to speak in front of a crowd.</p><p> </p><p>Immediately, Molly knew what to do. He immediately spoke up, hoping to sound light hearted enough.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, hello, you. Wanna sit? We have Pumpkin Pasties, Chocolate Frogs… Don’t tell our parents, but we’re also brought Muggle Sweets to share. Do you want to try Pink Wafers or Bull’s Eyes first?”</p><p> </p><p>“My parents told me not to accept sweets from strangers.” a small voice piped down from down below the newcomer’s waist.</p><p> </p><p>All the three taller children’s gaze went below, meeting the rusted copper coloured eyes of what appeared to be a very, very small girl.</p><p> </p><p>“Well, that’s a good rule in general.” Molly admitted. “My name is Mollymauk Tealeaf, Molly to my friends, and I am glad to meet you. Just like Yasha… Right, Yasha?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yasha Kord. Nice to meet you, help yourself with the sweets. I don’t like Bull’s Eyes.” Yasha said before moving some of her stuff from the seats and pushing the Muggle marbled sweets towards the two newcomers.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m Nott Buttonsmith.” the small voice piped up. “I’m a girl before you ask.” she added with a heavy cockney accent, as if defying them to say otherwise.</p><p> </p><p>“Hello Nott and welcome to this compartment. Eat sweets only if you want them.” Molly said as he presented his hand to shake.</p><p>Her eyes not leaving his, she took his hand, gingerly, with her gnarly fingers attached to small, burly arms. When they shook their hands, her hair, a dark with some sort of green highlights, shook from where they limply hanged from her grey beanie.</p><p> </p><p>Handshake out of the way, Nott <em> climbed </em> into one of the seats and pointedly looked up to the taller student behind her. Feeling the gazes on him, they shivered.</p><p> </p><p>“Hmm, <em> ya... </em>I’m Caleb. Caleb Widogast… I guess I’m a boy.” he finally said.</p><p> </p><p>“Nice to meet you, Caleb.” Molly told him with a bright smile.</p><p> </p><p>Taken with an idea, he searched his backpack and retrieved a faded set of cards.</p><p> </p><p>“Who wants to get their fortunes told?” he said, winking.</p><p> </p><p>Nott looked curious. Yasha scoffed. Caleb’s eyes squinted into two slits.</p><p> </p><p>“Divination is not a skill that’s learned, not really.” he said.</p><p> </p><p>“My mom says she took Divination as an elective in Third Year.” Yasha answered.</p><p> </p><p>Molly listened to their banter, smiling as he shuffled the cards.</p><p> </p><p>“Who wants to go first?” he asked, offering Caleb his widest smile.</p><p> </p><p>“No thanks.” The redhead immediately said.</p><p> </p><p>“What Caleb said.” Nott was swift to say once presented with the cards.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s ok.” Yasha said. “We’ll learn proper Divination in third year. So, where are you guys from?” she asked in turn, apparently, just as loath as Molly to let the discussion die entirely.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m from, er… East End.” Nott said, her accent softening, as if she was self-conscious, suddenly.</p><p> </p><p>“My parents are from Germany.” Caleb said. “And you?”</p><p> </p><p>“I was born near East End.” Yasha said. “Before my mother brought us to the Circus.”</p><p> </p><p>“And I only know the circus. I was born in Ireland and only left it when we did the grand British tour.” Molly added. “So I guess I’m a little bit from everywhere!”</p><p> </p><p>“That must be nice.” Nott said. “Travelling. Won’t you get tired, staying at school all year? Can you even write to your parents if they move around often?”</p><p> </p><p>“There’s a P.O. Box.” Molly shrugged. “In case Gustav can receive Owls, but he is fond of no news, good news.”</p><p> </p><p>“Well, you know if you have questions you’re too embarrassed to ask the teachers, you can also write to my Mum.” Yasha said in a soft giggle.</p><p> </p><p>“It must be good. To enter Hogwarts with someone you know.” Caleb said.</p><p> </p><p>The way he said some words, as if he was whistling them, was odd. Maybe because his parents were German?</p><p> </p><p>“Well, you know me now.” Nott said to Caleb. “And I guess we know Molly and Yasha.”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s not the same, we met in the train. Molly and Yasha grew up in a circus and can owl each other’s parents because of it.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh… I guess it’s not the same, then. But at least we’re friends, now, right”</p><p> </p><p>Molly looked at Nott and Caleb’s exchange, the way Caleb looked inspired by Nott and Nott hopeful. It was strange and endearing.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, we are.” Caleb answered, and something beautiful happened.</p><p> </p><p>For the first time since the odd duo had entered the compartment, Caleb’s lips stretched in a wide toothy smile full of pearly white teeth too wide for his jaw and Molly was blinded by it.</p><p> </p><p>Turning back to Nott, Molly felt ashamed to think that she didn’t look like much, her size that of a four year old, so much that she had to physically climb a seat before settling on it. Her own smile was made of crooked teeth and it made wrinkles appear around her eyes that made Molly think of the Goblins he saw at the bank in Diagon Alley.</p><p> </p><p>For a second, Molly wished someone, anyone, would smile at him like Nott and Caleb smiled to each other.</p><p> </p><p>The little party of four spent the time chatting away the anxiety. Yasha and Caleb spoke about the Defense of the Dark Arts book. Nott looked at Molly as if he was about to eat her and stared at his scar.</p><p> </p><p>“No, I'm not Harry Potter in disguise.” Molly joked.</p><p> </p><p>Caleb laughed and Nott grumbled. Yasha said nothing but her eyes narrowed into slits. Molly shrugged. A voice rang in the whole train, informing them that the Hogwarts Express would reach its destination in thirty minutes. Molly’s stomach suddenly became a bag of knots.</p><p> </p><p>Similarly, Nott and Caleb’s face drained of all blood while Yasha took deep calming breaths.</p><p> </p><p>“I guess we’ll let you girls get into your robes first.” Caleb told Yasha and Nott, standing up.</p><p> </p><p>Molly and Caleb closed the door behind them. Similarly, several students, some in their Muggle dress, others in robes, were chattering. Caleb was hunched as they waited and similarly, he tried to hide his whole body behind his shoulders as he later put on a faded black robe, frayed at the ends and seemingly very old and probably having belonged to an older siblings or maybe an uncle.</p><p> </p><p>Outside, Nott was hiding between Yasha’s legs, her robe a much better quality, but her hat having trouble staying on her head properly on account of the shape of her ears, slightly pointed at the top.</p><p> </p><p>“No, no, no, you don’t understand, I have to keep the hat on.” Nott was whining as Yasha crouched to be on a level with her.</p><p> </p><p>“You will have to put it off to be sorted.” Molly said.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes.” Caleb added. “Do you remember when we read it in <em> Hogwarts: A History </em>?”</p><p> </p><p>Nott nodded, not looking at all happy. Molly crouched in turn and removed the hat, taking handful of dark green hair and carefully arranging them to frame the little girl’s face, effectively hiding the pointed ears.</p><p> </p><p>“There, we don’t see them anymore.” he told her before caressing her hair one last time and straightening back up.</p><p> </p><p>Nott only looked marginally reassured and as the train slowly came to a halt, she stayed hidden between Caleb and Yasha.</p><p> </p><p>Molly was at the front, trying to navigate the mass of students, tall, lean, small, round, all talking, gossip, schoolwork, Hogsmeade Weekends. It was all fascinating, he thought as the platform filled with laughing and shouting masses. At some point, someone pushed Caleb into his side and Molly took a pointy elbow to the ribs.</p><p> </p><p>“Watch it, weirdo.” Molly heard a taller student tell the redheaded young wizard.</p><p> </p><p>Caleb’s head seemingly went further into his shoulders than before after that, the group not able to confront the older student who was parting the crowd like the Red Sea.</p><p> </p><p>“Where are we even supposed to go?” Molly complained.</p><p> </p><p>“Over here!” Yasha exclaimed, pointing her finger in the direction some students, smaller ones, were separating from their taller schoolmates.</p><p> </p><p>“FIRST YEARS! FIRST YEARS! COME AND SEE ME IF YOU’RE A FIRST YEAR!”</p><p> </p><p>The tallest man Molly had ever seen (and Bo was very tall!) was shouting at the top of his considerable lungs.</p><p> </p><p>“Let’s make our way over there.” Nott piped up from somewhere in their legs. “I want to breathe more than Molly’s calves.”</p><p> </p><p>“What’s wrong with my calves?” Molly wondered out loud before Yasha and Caleb pushed him forward.</p><p> </p><p>“Nothing.” Nott said hurriedly as they arrived near the goliath of a man who was now shouting.</p><p> </p><p>“IS THAT ALL FIRST YEARS?! ARE YOU ALL HERE?”</p><p> </p><p>“I think so, Mister Grog!” a high pitched voice sing songed to their left. “Can we get into the school to get Sorted and have very good grades and behave, now?”</p><p> </p><p>“Well, we can now that everyone is accounted for!” Mister Grog said with a tone of voice that seemed to be his speaking voice but very much counted like shouting to Molly. “Follow me little Firsties.”</p><p> </p><p>The walk from the station in the dark forest was treacherous to eleven years olds (give or take). So much that Caleb suddenly stopped and took Nott in his arms rather than let her stumble and fumble between their legs. It was quite the good idea for him to do so because Molly would have dropped the little girl upon seeing the castle.</p><p> </p><p>He had seen Gustav pet lions and tigers and make them run towards a crowd for a scare. He had seen Bo swallow swords and break walls and Ornna jump into fiery circles of flames at thirty feet of height and always catch the rope on the other side.</p><p> </p><p>He had never seen such a great, dark, body of water into which was reflected an equally huge castle illuminated by what seemed like ten thousands lights. Molly didn’t hear all the exclamations of his fellow new students over his own enthusiastic and vocal surprise.</p><p> </p><p>“This is so big.” Nott whispered.</p><p> </p><p>Molly bit back a <em> that’s what she said </em> (something Bo often said but Molly had only a vague idea of what it meant.) and followed the lead of the giant man, Mr Grog.</p><p> </p><p>“Now, all of you are going to enter the boats. No more than four of you per boat. Four rhymes with oar! I will know if you don’t obey that rule because I’ll have to drag your bums out of the lake before the Giant Squid gets a hold of you!”</p><p> </p><p>“A Giant Squid?” Molly wondered. “That’s fascinating! Can we tickle it?”</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t recommend it.” Mr Grog answered as he helped a student with a green ribbon in her hair.</p><p> </p><p>“Get into the boat.” Caleb said, sullenly.</p><p> </p><p>He had reserved a skiff where Nott was already installed, gripping the wooden sides of it, looking unsure. Yasha and Molly finally followed them and settled, the taller girl taking one of the oars and pushing them off the shore like several students had started to do already.</p><p> </p><p>“Once you’ve pushed, rowing is unnecessary, those are magicky little boats. We’ll see each other on the shore and wait for m… YOU! OVER THERE, DON’T ROCK THE BOAT!”</p><p> </p><p>Molly only had the time to turn around at that. Only the splash was seen and heard as well as “OSKAR!” shouted in a high pitched, yearning voice.</p><p> </p><p>“What happened?”</p><p> </p><p>“The girl with the ponytail was rocking the boat.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oskar is a dumb name!”</p><p> </p><p>“Let me see!”</p><p> </p><p>Another splash was heard as Mr Grog dove under water.</p><p> </p><p>“Mr Grog is so brave.”</p><p> </p><p>“Mr Grog doesn’t want to get fired, yeah.”</p><p> </p><p>The chatter kept on but no one could sea under the dark waters and thus, once all hypotheses were thrown in the air and the first boats started to reach their destination, the students were suddenly extremely silent and Molly too started to feel uneasy. Was a student going to drown on their first year? He had a hard time wrapping his head around the fact.</p><p> </p><p>Finally, after what felt like an eternity, something emerged. Mr Grog first, swimming to shore. Then a boy with a green sheen to his skin, similarly making his way to the good side of the lake in an expert way.</p><p> </p><p>“He swims really well for someone we feared had drowned.” Yasha said as everyone else cheered.</p><p> </p><p>“Did you see the Giant Squid?”</p><p> </p><p>“Is your name really Oskar?”</p><p> </p><p>The wet boy didn’t say a thing. He simply held his arms extended to his sides as if to ward off the onslaught of questions and then puked all over the floor, causing a chorus of disgusted screams.</p><p> </p><p>“Gross!” the girl with the ponytail spat.</p><p> </p><p>“Now that this is over, let’s go to the castle, otherwise the Headmaster is going to tan my hide quite litterally.” Mr *Grog said before spitting back his share of water back into the lake, renewing the disgusted effusions.</p><p> </p><p>“Well, that’s a good first day of school.” Molly exclaimed.</p><p> </p><p>“Someone almost drowned.” Caleb pointed out.</p><p> </p><p>“And swam to the shore like he trained for the Olympics.” Yasha added.</p><p> </p><p>“What are the Olympics?” Nott asked as they all turned around.</p><p> </p><p>“We’ll explain later. For now, time for wizard stuff!” Molly exulted, making his way towards the castle, taking the sight of Hogwarts at night one last time.</p><p> </p>
