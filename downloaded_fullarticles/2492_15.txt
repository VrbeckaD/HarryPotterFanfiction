    <p>It’s always the smallest decisions in our lives that make the biggest impact. Sometimes those decisions could be the same such as breaking the rules and getting expelled, or they could be different. A fated meeting by an apple tree. Sometimes it’s better we stay acquaintances than become soul mates, sometimes it's better for adversaries to become lovers. It is our choices that make us what we are, and those choices can rewrite history in the making.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A sister that never met her tragic end.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Duels that never happened.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>War never fought, wizards never killed...</p>
<p> </p>
<p>These choices we make may seem small and insignificant at first, but they are life changing and world building.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>If a butterfly flaps its wings...</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Or if an apple falls from a tree...</p>
<p> </p>
<p>----</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It had been a couple days since his mother’s funeral, but that didn’t mean Aberforth could mope around the house like Albus. Somebody had to do the chores around the house, and it certainly wasn’t his dainty arsed brother. Abe pushed back his sweat slicked red hair out of his dirt covered face, his skin had begun to darken from the sun. All the months holed up in school had left his skin pale and freckled. He shaded his piercing blue eyes from the sun using his hand, this summer was going to be Hell on Earth. Aberforth had just finished cleaning out the goat pen when he had heard the noise- no, it wasn’t the cheerful bleating from the goats for their newly cleaned space, it was a rustling of leaves from up in the apple tree.  Aberforth pulled out his wand and pointed it at the tree as he approached cautiously.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Who’s there?" Aberforth questioned gruffly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Why it is I, the Norse goddess Idunn rewarding you for your hard labor with an apple."  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>An apple fell from the tree, Aberforth catching it in his hand.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“What if I don't want eternal youth?” Aberforth questioned the mysterious voice.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Ah, familiar with the Prose Edda? Nice to find somebody in this place that is familiar with Norse mythology.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Get out of our tree, you have no right to be on our property."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"You are no fun." A boy with a light Germanic accent, brown eyes, and golden wavy hair appeared swinging upside down on the tree’s branch, hanging in front of Aberforth’s face.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Aberforth’s wand jabbed at the boy’s throat.  "If you don’t leave I’ll hex that stupid hair of yours into hay for the goats." He took a bite out of the apple, juice dripping down his chin.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Touchy, touchy. My aunt Bathilda sent me over to invite you for tea. Aberforth, correct? She said you’d be tending to the goats."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Aunt Bathilda? Didn’t realize she had family from abroad. I’m guessing I can’t say no to this invitation to tea." Aberforth frowned as he lowered his wand.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Mandatory, I’m afraid." Gellert pouted. "Auntie insists you come over, oh and your brother as well." And with that the golden haired boy disappeared back into the tree. "Tea is at noon," the sing-song voice chimed, seeming further away.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Aberforth checked his pocket watch and huffed. "That’s in half an hour! Not much of a notice." </p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Well then you better wash up quick then, I doubt Auntie will be pleased if you show up covered in goat shit." The boy laughed as he left.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Aberforth scowled, this boy was already getting on his nerves and knowing Bathilda she’d force them to be friends. What a bunch of rubbish. Abe pulled off his mud caked boots before trudging through the back door of the house. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Albus, Bathilda wants us over for tea in 30 minutes." Abe called up the stairs as Albus appeared at the top of the steps looking frazzled with a puzzle piece sticking out of his messy red hair.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Abe I can’t, I just got Ariana to calm down." Albus glanced back at the room he had just left nervously. "You go."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Me?! But I don’t-"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Abe, please." Albus was a complete mess, and Abe knew his brother trying to help was better than him moping around.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"...Fine." Aberforth rolled his eyes as he went to wash up and change out of his dirty clothes into more appropriate attire for tea.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>---</p>
<p>  "I am glad you came over." The golden haired boy smirked as he answered the door to Bathilda Bagshot’s home. "Your brother could not make it?" </p>
<p> </p>
<p>"No, he had other obligations."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Oh, how unfortunate! I know Albus has been really upset since... well." Bathilda cautiously approached the subject carrying a tray of biscuits and scones. "Come in, come in.  I see you already met my great nephew, Gellert Grindelwald. He's about your age Aberforth, I thought you two would get along like tea and biscuits!"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Aberforth side eyed the golden haired boy, he doubted that very much but he figured he’d humor Bathilda with the idea. They entered the parlor area where they sat in plush chairs, and Aberforth was not in his element. Bathilda waved her wand and the pot of tea poured itself into three cups.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Thank you, Mrs. Bagshot, but I have a lot of work to do around the house this summer though, I’m not sure-"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Gellert can help you!” Bathilda smiled warmly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I can?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“He can?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Gellert needs to get out of the house and away from his books, he studies too hard. A good bit of manual labor would be just what he needs after… after the Durmstrang incident.” Bathilda's lips pursed into a frown.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Aunt Bathilda…” Gellert grumbled as he shrank into his seat. “Don't-"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Oh Gellert, hush.” Bathilda waved her hand dismissing the boy who's cheeks were now red with shame.  “He was expelled from Durmstrang towards the end of the term. I'm going to try to re-enroll him at Hogwarts starting fall term.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Gellert scowled as Abe raised a curious brow. “Expelled? How do you get expelled from Durmstrang?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Well, he-"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Auntie, please!” Gellert interrupted. “I'll tell him.” He fiddled nervously with a loose thread on his shirt. “The headmaster said I was expelled for conducting questionable experiments, but I was really expelled for a different kind of experimenting.” His cheeks were flush with embarrassment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Oh.” Aberforth shrugged. “Hogwarts is more lenient, but you'll need to be more discreet. Not everyone is as open minded.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Are you open minded, then?” Gellert smirked raising an eyebrow.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I suppose.” Abe looked nonplussed as Bathilda had become quite uncomfortable with the turn of the conversation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Alright then boys! Off you go, I must get back to work on my writing. Gellert, dinner will be at 7, please be on time for once.  Aberforth, you're more then welcome to join us this evening.” Bathilda scurried off with the tea tray, leaving it in the kitchen for Dippy the house-elf to clean and locking herself in her study for the day.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Gellert turned to Abe. “I knew that would get her to leave us be. So, do you have anymore chores for the day?” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“No, I finished with the goat pens.” Aberforth shrugged. “I have the rest of the day to myself it seems.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Well, what shall we do then?” Gellert cocked his head curiously.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“We could go to town, I can show you around Godric's Hollow if you'd like.” Abe shrugged. “Up to you.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“It is rather hot outside though, is there a stream or pond to cool off in?” Gellert's cheeky smile implied he was up to something.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Well, there is a small pond to cool off in the woods on the outskirts of town…”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Perfect, let's go!” </p>
<p>---</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The pond was in a small clearing of the woods, the trees allowing just enough sunlight to come through. Lily pads sat on the surface of the water, moss covered the rocks that surrounded the pond. Frogs croaked from the hollowed logs by the edge of the pond, crickets and cicadas joining the orchestra of sounds. The water was cold to the touch as Abe wiggled his fingers in the clear water. It had rained the other day, which had cooled down the pond. Aberforth rolled up his pant legs and dipped his legs in slowly into the freezing water. He removed his robe throwing it off on a rock nearby so it wouldn't get wet, and rolled up the sleeves to his white shirt, when suddenly-</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <em>SPLASH.</em>
  </strong>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Gellert’s head came up from the surface of the water. “Come on! It's much easier if you jump in.” Gellert teasingly splashed Abe with water.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“No, thank you.  I'm fine right here.” Abe watched as Gellert swam closer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“It's not fun if you're just watching.” Gellert grabbed Abe's foot that was in the water and pulled. “Come. In.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“N-O. In English, that spells no.” Abe tried to pull his foot back but Gellert pulled harder causing Abe's to slip off the mossy rock he sat on and fall into the pond. He was absolutely soaked, and still in his clothes. “Damn it, Gellert! I said no!” The water was rather deep, Abe struggled to hold onto the slippery rock.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You can't swim?” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“No, I can't!” Abe's hands slipped from the rock, Gellert catching him in his arms as he cast a wand-less floating charm.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“There. Better?” Gellert whispered sensually in Abe's ear, still holding him against his bare chest and- wait a minute.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Are you naked?!” Aberforth pushed away.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Yes? How else am I supposed to swim? With clothes on?” Gellert smirked slyly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Abe's cheeks reddened as he tried not to stare under the clear water at Gellert's bare skin. This was going to be a problem. Aberforth was certainly not against messing with boys in his dormitory at Hogwarts, but this. This was different. Gellert wasn't an inexperienced boy looking for a quick release, he was a Greek statue that should be worshiped upon. Abe thought his eyes would burn if he stared at Gellert too long, he was like the sun and Abe was Icarus flying way too close.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I-I should go.” Abe swam away from Gellert to the shallow end to exit the pond.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Gellert frowned. “I thought you had the day off. Please, Aberforth. Don't go.” Gellert swam closer as he grabbed Abe's hand.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You can just call me Abe.” Aberforth averted his gaze.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Please stay with me, Abe.” Gellert's brown eyes seemed to twinkle, and Aberforth was mesmerized by the young man. “I have no other friends here. It'd be an awfully boring summer without you.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I'm your friend?” Abe squeezed Gellert’s hand that was still holding his.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“If you want to be.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Tell me why you were actually expelled.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I did!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Gellert, you can't bullshit a bullshitter.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Gellert looked away nervously, then looked back into Abe's blue eyes.  “Fine, but you have to promise me we'll be friends and you won't run away.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Abe nodded.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“The boy I had sex with, I tried the Cruciatus curse on him. Just to see what would happen, I was curious. He trusted me, I didn't force him to do anything against his own free will.” Gellert eyed Abe nervously as he continued.  “He never told me to stop, and the Cruciatus curse isn't supposed to kill anyone but… He never came back from the infirmary.” Gellert bit his lip. “I never meant to hurt him, I just wanted to see what it was like to cast an unforgivable.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Aberforth was quiet for awhile. “My father cast an unforgivable curse, he was sent to Azkaban for the rest of his life. I'm not sure if he even regrets it. Do you?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Of course! I regret it every single day. Alexei was a good friend of mine, he was a hard worker. He remind me a bit of you. He was very stubborn.” Gellert smiled warmly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Did you… love him?” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Maybe,” Gellert sighed. “I don't know. Maybe I only loved him because I felt guilt from what I did.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Loving somebody because you feel guilty, is not real love. I know that from experience.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Oh?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“My brother.” Aberforth scowled. “Ever since our mother passed away he's been taking care of us, but he keeps trying too hard to reassure us that everything is fine. Then he mopes around and cries himself to sleep at night. And no, it's not grief for our mother, it's grief for the ruined plans he made. He was supposed to go on a world tour with his… <em>friend</em>. My sister and I... He feels guilty if he left us. That's not love.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I'm really sorry, Aberforth.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“It's just… frustrating.” Abe sighed as he relaxed into the water.  He had never really talked about his feelings so openly before, except with his mother and she was… gone.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“If you need help this summer with the goats and other chores, I will help. And not just because Bathilda volunteered me.” Gellert smiled and gave Aberforth a quick kiss on the cheek. “Friends?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Abe blushed. He wasn't sure if it was a foreign greeting he was unfamiliar with or if Gellert was flirting with him. He nodded his head, placing a chaste kiss on Gellert's cheek. “Friends.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The golden haired boy was smirking. He brought his hand to cup Aberforth's cheek, bringing the red haired boy closer to kiss him properly on the lips. Abe brought his own hand to the back of Gellert's neck deepening the kiss bringing them closer together.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>Friends, indeed.</em>
