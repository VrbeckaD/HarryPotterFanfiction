    <p>      I do not own harry potter, the brilliant J K Rowling does. i just own the oc's if and when i decide to add them. I am writing this on a touch screen laptop which the keyboard is broken so it will take time in between each chapter. i do not have a beta, this is my first fanfiction that i have decided to post. I love reviews, i ask for no flames. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>       Chapter 1: Trees, Rivers, and Monsters.....oh my, and other stuff. </p><p>          The boy with dark colored hair peered at his surrounding with a look of awe. He was quite certain he had fallen asleep in his bed in the smallest room in number four private drive in Surrey, England. But he had awoken in a completely different environment, and unfamiliar one at that. He was surrounded by large, beautiful trees of different species ones with grey bark that sat alone but there were also ones that were thin but just as tall stood in a cluster. As he walked the moss squished under his toes and soon his surrounding turned from moss covered trees to thick jungle under brush and than to the vegetation of the amazon that he had once seen in a picture book that Dudley had thrown away after he had opened the gift during one of his birthdays. Soon the sun that shown threw the canopy turned dark and he was jumping at every little sound he heard, even his own footsteps.</p><p>          Hadrian jumped as a hoot came out of no where in a tree away from the boys emerald gaze sat a grey and orange feathered bird, next was squeaking of mice, branches crunching that he was hundred percent correct was not him. Hadrian so wished this was a dream of his but it was unlikely. He would be celebrating his thirteenth birthday soon and he dreaded thinking of spending it here, he would rather be at the Dursleys than this beautiful yet terrifying place. There was another sound only this time it was much, much, much closer. It was right behind the dark headed boy, Hadrian slowly turned and his eyes widened at what he saw. On all fours stood not even ten feet from the twelve nearly thirteen year old was a huge feline with black fur, big sharp looking teeth, white colored eyes and a pink tongue. He turned and ran and it did not take him long to locate a cave where he spent the rest of the night in. He woke the next morning to teeth pulling pain in his stomach which reminded him of his crisis of food and safe drinking water. He made his way from the cave and easily found fruit, it took him longer but he eventually found water. "I need to find a way out." he told himself and stood again after he had took sips from a rock, Hadrian did not want to spend another night here he needed to get home and away from here, where here was anyway.</p><p>          Hadrian pushed his way out from some big green leaves and did a double take. He had just stumbled upon a moving river and clenched his hands into fists. He could do this he could swim it was no big deal just some water, he breathed in and entered the clear blue water. In the middle he could not touch the bottom but froze as 'something' brushed against his right leg he quickly moved his body faster and dropped onto the sandy ground. For hours all he did was walk take a break walk again take a break. soon the sun went down and he spent the night high up in a tree, not sleeping a wink. This continued on for days and soon he could not tell what day it was. But this night he sat in a hallowed out tree that was still standing, the rain just kept coming as did the shivers and oncoming hypothermia, not that he new. Suddenly out of no where it felt as if someone had taken sharp claws from the lower half to his shoulder coming around to his front. His head hurt and he could not open his eyes from the pain and he heard nothing, his arms and legs were on fire, his stomach felt as if his intestines were turning inside out to the point he thought he was dying. Hadrian wasn't sure when he passed out because when he woke it was in his bedroom of private drive number four. </p><p>            Hadrian spent the next day only getting up to shower and to later eat and drink something. Once he was mobile again his Aunt and Uncle who had not even questioned his lengthened absence put him to work on cleaning the house since Vernon's sister Marge Dursley would be coming to stay for the week bringing along her horrible dog ripper. He should have had more control of his emotions he was use to her saying things about him and he was to act the part of a dim fool or no food for a week as Vernon had yelled before she arrived just like every year. But when she started on about his mum and dad he blew up, literally he blew her up into a balloon and she was whisked away. He had quickly packed all of his belongings and drug his trunk down the stairs and needed to threaten the whale of a man to let him leave with out any physical violence. He had walked until it had gotten dark and he had sat in a little playground surrounded by bushes and trees. He just sat there thinking on what his next plan would be when a scruffy black dog walked from a bush vertical of him. He watched the scruffy black dog shift and mold into a man a scruffy man with unwashed black hair, pale skin and blue eyes.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>That is all i have  at the moment so please comment. It will be getting longer i promise but i am a senior in high school and I am exhausted  and it would not leave my head and soon between my free hours and lunch break morphed into this. I have looked over it for spelling mistakes and grammar but i suck at grammar so point it out to me if any one spots some. Thank you and come again.</p><p> </p><p>Djinthehouse</p><p> </p><p> </p>
