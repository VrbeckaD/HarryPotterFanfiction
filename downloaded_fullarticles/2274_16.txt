    <p>The 11 year old kid clung tightly to his mum as he looked around the place he dreamt he would visit someday. He sealed his lips tightly together because he didn’t want to show how excited he was. But the twinkle his beautiful amber eyes could not be missed. </p><p>His eyes were always a dead give away to his feelings though the kid had managed to perfect the art of hiding his emotions so early on his life. There was just something about the kid that was quite unique. He managed to retain the innocence of his age or even more innocent than an average 11 year old. Yet he also had the sereneness his disposition befitting a wise old man. Almost zen-like some would say.</p><p>The boy, called Remus Lupin, was the only child of a beautiful, short and sweet like a chocolate bar, Hope Lupin. And a kind, if slightly eccentric and extremely witty Lyall Lupin. Remus was much loved by them both. In fact, Remus had no doubt his parents loved to moon and back, quite literally as well as figuratively! You see, Remus Lupin, is a sweet, kind, witty kid who turns into a werewolf once a month and has been doing that ever since he got bitten at a tender age of five. </p><p>Lyall and Hope have protected the kid so far from the wolf within him and the world outside as well that is determined to hate due to prejudice. So protective were they that when Remus received his Hogwarts letter, Lyall burnt it at once and absolutely refused to allow Remus to go there. Not because he was ashamed of his son, no, God No! But he wanted to protect his son from ridicule, from hatred and most importantly from the ministry who would be sure to find out. </p><p>Whatever, Dumbledore had to say in this matter, despite the immense respect Lyall had for the man, his former Headmaster, he would not risk his son’s life and future by sending him to Hogwarts or to any other magical school. Dumbledore simply didn’t understand, Lyall reasoned. Though what possible future, Remus, his lovely Remus, could have in the muggle world, he wasn’t sure of either. </p><p>Remus who had been stunned and then excited and happy like any other 11 year old also was wise to the risks it posed. But the excitement of going to the school he had heard and read so much about. The excitement of learning things his father had learnt and the excitement of meeting other wizards and witches was too much for even the normally poised Remus to contain. </p><p>What worried his dada so strongly was not something he wanted to get excited about. So he went back to being the poised Remus who only allowed himself to show the disappointment in the lonely confines of his room. No, his dada was right, it would be foolish to assume that he could go to Hogwarts like a normal kid and make friends and have a normal life. </p><p>He was, will have to be, happy with his muggle existence, his one or 2 muggle friends. He would get to stay at home with his parents who doted on him, would learn magic from his dada who was, Remus was sure, a better teacher than all the teachers at Hogwarts put together. </p><p>So with these thoughts Remus had written off the hope of going to Hogwarts and avoided all attempts by Hope to discuss his feelings/disappointment. He was fine, he swore, ate Hope’s delicious and freshly baked chocolate brownies, fudge sticking to his long slender fingers. </p><p>His eyes, those beautiful light amber eyes betrayed the emotions, Remus didn't know how to train them not to. Not yet. He would have to control them, it wouldn’t do to go about showing anyone the pain, loneliness, helplessness, fear. Not especially to his parents who had sacrificed so much for him. </p><p>That night at dinner, he had sat at the table eating his dessert, like every other night, another excellent brownie, the chocolate sauce covering his pink lips, his amber eyes darker from sleep and his curly brown hair picking up some chocolate as well. Remus always ate chocolate with his whole being, literally. His mind, body and soul craved chocolate and Remus was sure, if the whole concept of soul mate was true, then he had already found his. </p><p> Lyall, as always was watching his son from the corner of eye, his face overflowing with fondness for his son and a smile that showed his contentment. He was always content watching Remus happy and Remus was always happy when he was eating his brownie. Hope was making tea for Lyall and herself, when they heard a pop and out of thin air appeared a tall fatherly figure. </p><p>He didn’t have the large belly or red clothes and it wasn’t christmas yet, so no it definitely wasn’t father christmas, thought Remus, whose sleepy eyes suddenly wide and sparkling with curiosity. Then the recognition hit him, of course this was, Albus Dumbledore, the Headmaster at Hogwarts, the most widely respected and most powerful wizard in the world. </p><p>Remus had wondered briefly what he might be doing here but knowing that Dumbledore was fond of his dad and also that he might have some ministry work with him, he quickly decided to make himself scarce. He knew after all that when adults discussed work, he shouldn’t interrupt. </p><p>Lyall and Dumbledore had stood there looking at each other as as Lyall opened his mouth to say something, Dumbledore spoke quite abruptly,  “Come Lyall, do be sensible. What use is it to hide him from the world he truly belongs to. If I am not much mistaken the boy has definitely inherited your brilliance and might I add Hope’s kindness. A formidable combination if I might add”. </p><p>He paused as he looked again at Remus with fondness, sure of his assessment of the kid he was meeting for the first time. “Or is it that you don’t trust me to keep him safe?” he taunted again cutting Lyall’s retort short. The two men looked at each other for a few minutes, Lyall cleared his throat and said “Remus, please say goodnight to the headmaster, clean up and go to bed, my love”. </p><p>As Remus moved into the kitchen to clean up, he saw his dad looking at Dumbledore beseeachingly. Dumbledore’s eyes became kinder still as he motioned for Lyall to sit and said “Lyall, I understand and am as you very well know, fully aware of the consequences. I have taken every precaution in the school to ensure Remus’s as well as other student’s safety. All teachers have been informed and they have all vowed to treat him like every other student and also guard his secret as their own.” </p><p>As Lyall looked uncomfortably over to Remus listening intently to this conversation, Dumbledore motioned for Remus to join his dada on the couch. Remus looked at his dada, who gave him a defeated nod of approval, and nervously shifted and plopped down close to Lyall on the shabby canvas couch, Hope joining him on the other side.</p><p> Lyall was perplexed, “Why are you insisting on this Albus?”. Dumbledore smiled kindly at the three Lupin’s in front of him  and said, “Hogwarts never has and never will make any biases. Remus would have had a place if not for the incident 6 years ago, and that incident changes nothing to my decision to give him that place”. </p><p>He had gotten up, knowing that he had managed to convince his old student and added rather cryptically, “besides, I have a good feeling about this”. Lyall, who knew Albus’s ways very well, did not enquire the meaning of that. Dumbledore had turned again, and with a twinkle in his eyes, made a movement with his hand in the air and caught a chocolate frog out of no where and held it out to the boy. </p><p>Remus had just gaped stupidly at the headmaster, whilst his mum smiled kindly at him and goaded him to take it but his dada stood there with a slight frown on his face and his jaw set but quite defeated. If Dumbledore insisted on it, Lyall would have to trust him and part with Remus to send him to Hogwarts. It was not that he was not happy about it, oh he was ecstatic, as any parent would be. But it was his dear Remus and he wasn’t like other kids after-all.  </p><p>As Remus reached for the chocolate the headmaster had looked straight into his eyes and Remus was certain he would never be able to hide anything from this man. And then with the same twinkling eyes and kind smile added, “oh, I do hope you like Chocolate! There is lots of it to enjoy at Hogsmeade” and winked. He then turned again to Lyall, and added “I will send the rest of the details of special arrangements made for Remus at Hogwarts soon” and with another pop had disappeared.</p><p>Remus had stood there with mouth wide open, gaping, as Lyall fell heavily on to the couch. Remus could not believe it nor understand it. His dada had not said yes but the headmaster was confident that Remus would be at Hogwarts. In fact, he had gone out of his way to make arrangements for him at the school. Remus was not stupid, he knew that meant the details of where and how his transformations at full moon were to take place. </p><p>Remus hadn't dared to hope until Lyall had spoken. But Lyall had remained silent for the rest of the night. Remus had spent all night tossing and turning, with excitement and an anticipation that was frankly killing him. Why couldn’t his dada just say if he was truly going or not. After what seemed like hours Remus fell asleep and dreamt of a huge castle that night!</p><p>Remus had woken up that day and had gone down with much less anticipation than the night before. After all his dada would have said yes if he had in fact agreed to send him. He sat at the breakfast table, not daring to ask, not even daring to show his dad that he had slept scarcely, from excitement the previous night. He busied himself with porridge and honey, the exact color of his eyes now. </p><p>Lyall was reading his daily morning dose of Prophet, the magical newspaper, Hope was making tea for Remus and an hour went by quietly. As they finished breakfast and Lyall his paper, he got up, smiled at Remus and said “Why don’t you go change, my Love? We need to take a trip to Diagon Alley to buy your books and things for school. We don’t have many days left now for 1st of September after all!” </p><p>Remus thought he was still dreaming when he felt a sudden rush of warmth which he recognised as his mum’s. He looked up to see his mum, tears welling up in her beautiful green eyes. Lyall, now going into get ready himself, ruffled his son’s curly hair fondly, before giving them both a gentle nudge to get ready. Remus ran to his room so fast that he fell on his bed, face down, panting. He straightened himself up, with an ear splitting grin and he pulled over his favourite T-shirt and Denims. </p><p>He skipped 2 stairs at once coming running down, a smile still plastered on his face that made his face look absolutely angelic. Remus could not believe his luck as he clinged to his mum’s hand with his hand taking his other arm and apparating to Diagon Alley.</p><p>Thus, with his eyes wide and lips tightly sealed and hands gripping his mum's tightly, Remus found himself in walking around in Diagon Alley. He spent a lot of time inside Flourish and Botts and had to be literally dragged out by his mum with the promise of stopping at Fortescue's Icecream parlour. Unsurprisingly he had 2 large scoops of chocolate ice-cream topped with chocolate chips and chocolate sauce. </p><p>Lyall didn't necessarily have much money but he could never bring Remus to Diagon Alley and not buy him an ice-cream at Fortescue's, even if that meant he would himself starve at lunch for the next week. After buying his books and other items, they had money only for second hand robes, but Remus hardly minded. Who would, when you had had the best time of your life. </p><p>Remus was also watching other kids around, a tall boy with close curls and a kind smile, slightly older than him animatedly chatting with some other boy about Quidditch. His attention then shifted to a hyper excited kid, with thick glasses and the craziest hair he had ever seen, bouncing around the 2 older kids listening to their conversation about the wizard sport Remus had heard about but not paid too much attention to. </p><p>As he was making his way out with his parents, his attention briefly stopped at another dark haired boy, this boy's hair however flowed perfectly and this time Remus was embarrassed for himself! He noticed pain flit through the boys perfect but haughty features just as his dad apparated them out of the Diagon Alley. </p><p>Remus had a few more days in which to eat as many of his mother's brownies as possibly could and read as many of the muggle books as he possibly could, reread Hogwarts A History and pack all his things into the second hand trunk. On the eve of the departure, Lyall and Hope came into Remus's room and sat next to him on his bed where he was just finishing his last muggle book from the library. </p><p>Remus looked up, smiling beatifically at his parents, grateful to them for everything. His dada had already explained to him all the details of how he would be transforming. He had also explained to him the importance of ensuring that no one ever finds out and given him instructions after instructions. He had also told him a lot more stories of his own time at Hogwarts than he had ever before and he told him a few more that night. Then checking to see he had everything packed they each kissed him on his forehead and tucked him to bed. </p><p>Morning of September 1st, the 2 proud but anxious parents took Remus to the station on to the crowded 93/4 platform. Lyall pulled him aside before letting him board the train and for one last time, gave him instructions after instructions. If the idea of not making friends, keeping to himself, tugged at his heart, Remus didn't show it. </p><p>He would do what his dada asked him. He would keep to himself, not involve himself with anything, make himself scarce and focus on learning magic, make his dada, his mum proud and not give Albus Dumbledore a reason to drive him out. His mum hugged him one last time and kissed him several times on his cheeks which had now turned pink as he noticed a boy, the boy with the perfect hair, give him a haughty smile. </p><p>He tore away from his mum and boarded the train and tried to find somewhere empty to sit where he could go unnoticed. Everywhere was full and as he was searching, the same boy from before was behind him, tutting impatiently for him to move and find a compartment. As he found a compartment with just one boy he moved in and to his annoyance, the haughty boy as he had now taken to calling him, followed suit. </p><p>Remus stowed his trunk and found himself face to face with the boy with the unruly hair who was smiling at them, yes the haughty boy had stowed his own expensive trunk with golden locks, not smiling, grinning at them madly. </p><p>Remus was not sure if this was going to work, not sure at all. But thank god, soon the 2 boys began talking animatedly and Remus was left to his thoughts.</p>
