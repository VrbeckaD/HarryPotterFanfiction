<p>Conflagration </p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Heat engulfs you, you’re enveloped by the fever stoked by Snape, who surrounds you, caresses you, presses you against the wall, mouth on your skin, body wrapped around yours. </p>
<p>You spear his hair with your fingers, clinging, kissing. There’s nothing gentle about his assault, nor in your response. </p>
<p>He enters you, lighting an inferno, a conflagration, and you’re consumed in flame. You strain together, heat building until it bursts from you, obliterating thought, every sense, everything. </p>
<p>“Wow,” you whisper once the fire’s mere embers. </p>
<p>“Indeed,” he replies. And as soon as he touches you once more, the fire builds again.</p>
