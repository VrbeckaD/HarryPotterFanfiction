    <h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
    <p>You live on Naboo as a healer, treating animals and people alike. You are never paid, but instead trade one service for the other. Some days you have nothing to do and other days you have hands to few.</p><p>Never, though, you expected this to happen.</p><p>The rain pours down, droplets as large as Tima eggs. But you are safe in your little home. That is, until there is a knock on your door. It’s late, you expect no one. It is likely someone lost in the terrible weather.<br/>
You open the door to a tall man, with long black hair and a sallow skin. You gape up at him. “My ship crashed, I need a place to wait out the rain.” There is something commandeering in his deep voice. It is not very polite, but you disregard it. You couldn’t leave the poor guy out in this weather. You step aside to let him in. He doesn’t thank you with more than a slight nod.</p><p>You barely dare tell the man to make himself at home. He flops down on the chair by your small working table. He heaves a deep sigh. You kick yourself mentally in the butt and decide to man up and be hospitable. This man might scare you a little, but that is no reason for you not to show him kindred. You retrieve a towel and hand it to him. “T-Thanks..” There is a note of hesitation in the man’s voice. You have no idea how to reply, so you back off to the sitting area.</p><p>He sits there, at you table, observing your small house. His eyes stray over to you. “I’m going to need a place to sleep.” He does his best to sound strict. “How about you tell me your name first. I’ll give you a pillow in return.” You answer.</p><p>He has to think on it for a few moments. “I’m Ben Solo.” He then begrudgingly answers.  </p><p>“If you tell me what happened, you can also earn a blanket.” You try to be playful, hoping he will open up a little bit. “My ship crashed.” Is the curt answer. “And yet here you are.” You reply. “And yet here I am. My ship is too small to offer me shelter and I can’t repair it in weather like this.” There is something severe in Ben’s dark eyes that you see even from where you are sitting.</p><p>It’s late, you’re starting to feel sort of tired. “Alright, I am turning off the light.” You stand up and go over to your bed. You dig a spare pillow and a comforter from under it. “Where am I supposed to sleep?” It is only half a question. “On the couch.” You reply. “That will never fit.” Ben argues, rather loudly. “Well …” You honestly have no idea what to say. Ben is most certainly too tall for your couch.<br/>
“Well?” Ben asks furrowing his brow. “We can share the bed.” You mumble. “Share???” Ben’s voice is hard and your take a step back. “Y-yeah…” You nod. “Is that the type of service you provide?” The severity is back in Ben’s eyes. “I am a healer, not a harlot.” You reply, not about to let him insult you. “Sure you are.” Ben rises from his chair. He is over at you in two big strides.</p><p>Ben peers down on you. There is something electrifying about him, between you. He’s demanding, but also desirable.</p><p>You back off to the bed. Ben follows you, his eyes focussed on yours. You sit down on the edge of the mattress, not breaking eye contact. Ben crouches in front of you. He pulls off one of his black gloves and reaches out to touch your face. Chills run down your spine, it feels as if there is electricity under his skin. You shut your eyes, knowing what is going to happen next.<br/>
Ben’s lips are cold and clumsy upon yours. You accept them, feeling the same electricity as with his fingers. Ben arches forward, to press his lips tighter against yours. You lift a hand to cup his jaw. This is escalating quickly and you can even muster the brain power to give any sort of objection. Not a single cell in your entire being thinks of objecting, even if Ben is all but a complete stranger to you.</p><p>Ben presses you into the sheets, hovering over you. He seems indecisive on how to carry on. You draw his face to yours again, kissing him slowly, tenderly. Ben’s hands tighten on your upper arms, the electricity thrumming over your skin. He is swift to deepen the kiss. His tongue invades your mouth. You whimper, encouraging him. His tongue searches your mouth. His fingers leave bruises on your arms, but you barely notice it.<br/>
Ben’s pelvis sinks down against yours, he’s letting his body down. He is, however, much taller than you, so his back needs to arch a little bit to accommodate the contact between your pelvisses and your mouths. He is trying his best though. You in your turn do your best to make him as comfortable as possible.</p><p>In order to avoid Ben getting some sort of hernia, you nudging him gently, until his is on his back on the mattress. To your surprise, Ben is rather compliant. His hands find your hips once you straddle him. The severity isn’t in his eyes anymore. He actually seems rather insecure.</p><p>You start to slowly rock your hips. You pelvis grinds against Ben’s. He groans softly and looks up at you, willing you to carry on. Willing you to give him more. You lean in and kiss him deeply. Ben responds in turn, his tongue invades your mouth again. You moan, bunching your fists in the sheets. You keep rocking your hips and earn another little groan from Ben.</p><p>Soon enough Ben tugs at your upper garments. You waste no time in getting them off and stare him down to do the same. He pulls his black clothes over his head. You marvel at his amazing sculpt and his wide shoulders. “What?” Ben asks. You lift a hand to run over the pale skin of his broad shoulders. “You’re handsome.” You cooe. “T-thanks.” It seems Ben is not quite sure how to react to a compliment like this. There is insecurity in his eyes. Like he’s never been paid a genuine compliment before.<br/>
You momentarily get off of him to take off your trousers. Ben shimmies out of his leather pants. He brings down his boxers too, his pale, long cock flopping free, slapping noisily against his abs.</p><p>You curl your fingers around his cock. Ben groans and closes his eyes. It makes you smile and feel bubbles well up in your lower stomach. This is good. You lean in and place a kiss on the top of his glans. Ben sighs, pleasurably. You give him a firm lick. Ben groans again. Something in his face tenses, but you can’t name what it is. You lean in and slowly take him in your mouth. “Ohhn.” Ben groans, his deep voice vibrating in your heart. The sound of him is almost hypnotising. You flick your tongue out at him and suck gently. More groans pour from Ben’s lips.<br/>
Ben seems to gain confidence, as you feel his fingers tangle in your hair. His hips start to slowly rock, driving his cock in and out of your mouth. Deeper and deeper, in and out of your throat. You whimper, but quite enjoy his dominance. Not to mention the raw groan streaming from his mouth.</p><p>You wriggle away after a while. You wouldn’t want Ben to finish without sharing in the fun. You crawl away from him, turning your back to him and drawing down your undergarments. You lower your torso against the mattress. “Come to me, Ben please.” You whisper.<br/>
There is no hesitation in Ben now. He sit up on his knees, taking hold of your hips. He wastes no time prepping you, which you actually don’t mind. He lines up and thrusts in. You feel as if he splits you in half, in a very good way. “Oh yes! Ben!” You cry out for him. “Hngh Fuck!” Ben calls out as well. He remains still inside you for a couple of heartbeats. You can practically feel his heartbeat inside you.<br/>
You can’t keep silent when he resumes his thrusts. He pulls out almost all the way and rams himself back in. Time and time again. He places his hand flat on your back, which somehow gives his thrusts more impact. You can’t help but moan for him. He leans in to breath against the shell of your ear. Gooseflesh runs down your spine. “You are so loud.” He hisses. You can’t muster more reply than a string of desperate moans.</p><p>He plows you like a beast, breathing down your neck and digging his fingers into the flesh of your hips. You clench around him, causing him to inhale sharply. You are close to your climax. Ben can feel it to. “Do it.” He all but commands. It is as if your body obeys. Your climax washes over with intensity. You call out his name and let is wash you away.<br/>
Ben holds you steady, not moving inside you. He lets you calm down, before fucking you into a second, less intense climax. He fucks you right through it. Your mind is completely blank, all you can still think of is Ben, his thrusts, his grip, his groans. You never want this to stop.</p><p>Ben spills his seed, too soon for your taste. But you voice none of your sentiment. You let Ben spend himself, huffing and groaning above you.</p><p>He remains inside you until he goes fully flaccid.</p><p>He lays down on the bed and gazes at the ceiling. You get up to go to the bathroom. When you return, Ben is under the sheets, his face to the wall. You crawl into bed with him, spooning up against him. He doesn’t shrug you off, but doesn’t react either.</p><p>When you wake up in the morning, Ben has already left.</p>
