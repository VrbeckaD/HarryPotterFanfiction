    <p>Albus knows that the feelings he carries for his best friend weren’t right.</p><p>He doesn’t know when it happened. It was just suddenly there. He tried to ignore them. Shut them up. Forget them. However, it just got worse and worse over the years. He plays this game for 3 years now and everyday it hurts more.</p><p>Seeing Scorpius laugh with Rose or other Girls. Seeing him grow up and get more and more handsome. Seeing him laugh, cry and smile. Soon they´ll finish Hogwarts. Soon Scorpius´ll get a beautiful wife and small offsprings. It hurts incredibly thinking about it.</p><p>Albus knows he had to move on, but how could he? He loved everything about Scorpius. He loved all these little things nobody ever notices. He loved how Scorpius´ long, pale fingers wrapped around books or mugs. He loved how his lips slightly move when he reads. He loved how elegant he moved his whole body.</p><p>Albus knows he should stop thinking like this about his best mate. And Albus knows he should stop imagine how it would be like kissing those soft lips. Because it will never happen. Never. And still, Albus watches Scorpius when he sleeps. Like he does now.</p><p>The dorm is already empty, everyone was off to breakfast, but Albus couldn’t bear waking Scorpius. He looks so peacefully, delighted and vulnerable. Albus´ love for this boy overwhelmed him. He wanted to protect him at all costs and let nothing hurt him again, because this boy is always so kind to everyone although he already went through so much pain.</p><p>Albus wanted to kiss Scorpius so bad. He couldn’t stand this longing anymore and all of a sudden Scorpius´ lips are less than an inch away from Albus´.</p><p>Just in this moment Scorpius slowly opens his eyes, Albus, now aware of what he was going to do, abruptly turns around and storms out of the dorm.</p><p align="left"><em>Why can’t you control your stupid actions</em>, he screams in his head, <em>why are you so weak</em>. <em>It isn’t even this hard, just stupid feelings, you fool</em>.</p><p align="left">Eventually he stopped running, feeling the tears streaming down his face and breathing hard, in the next bathroom he starts sobbing. His body is shaking uncontrollably and there are this voices in his head again. <em>You’re such a weak fool, Albus Potter. Cant stand a little pain without sobbing like a toddler.</em></p>
