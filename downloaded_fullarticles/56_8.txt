    <p>Dumbledore was a bit worried. Hagrid reported back from his visit with Harry. If he could have called it a visit. Vernon Dursley had shot Hagrid in the arm. Hagrid said he saw Harry curled up in a corner but that the Dursleys wouldn't let him near the boy. Their own son was huge compared to Harry. Hagrid said Harry didn't even look like he was old enough to go to Hogwarts.</p><p>Dumbledore was now waiting in his office for Severus Snape. If anyone could discover what was wrong with the boy, it would be Severus. Was it all a ploy by the Dursleys to keep Harry? He knew over the years that they had demanded more and more money to care for Harry. Maybe they were afraid of losing their source of money? He stopped his musing as Severus was announced.</p><p>____________________________________________________________________________</p><p>Severus Snape couldn't believe he was actually doing this. He was heading toward Petunia Dursley's house. How he hated the woman. Why Dumbledore left the Potter spawn there he would never understand. He found number 4 but he didn't feel any magic. He discreetly pulled out his wand and ran a scan. There weren't any wards on the house or even in the area.</p><p>He put his wand away. He headed up the walkway of said house. He wondered if they used a ruler to measure the grass. Knowing Petunia she most like screamed every time the grass put a blade out of place. The whole area just screamed, "we want to make everyone believe we are normal". He was sickened by the whole neighborhood. He would also bet that there were at least three neighbors spying on him as he approached the pristine house. He knocked on the door. He heard a child scream "Mum, there is a freak on at the door."</p><p>Severus, if he was honest, wasn't a bit surprised by that. He would bet the contains of his vault that Petunia raised Potter and her son to be spoiled brats and taught them that the world revolved around them. He was going to have Dumbledore testing some potions for him.</p><p>"What do you want?" Petunia asked through clenched teeth. "We already told you the boy isn't going."</p><p>"Hello to you too, Tunney. I am here to speak to Potter."</p><p>"What didn't you freaks understand? We said no. He isn't going." She went to shut the door but he pushed against it.</p><p>"Do I need to remind you that I am over 17 and can perform magic outside of Hogwarts?" Severus sneered. "Now, I want to speak to Potter. I will leave after that."</p><p>"Fine."</p><p>Severus resisted the urge to wipe his face. He followed Petunia into the house. He looked around noticing the wall of pictures. He looked at them and not one of them had Potter. They either contained the fat blob he could see eating ice cream in front of the telly or a family of three. He could see out of the corner of his eye that Petunia walked to a door. Why was she opening a door to a boot cupboard? "Get out."</p><p>Severus watched as a small child emerged. The boy looked to be about 7 or 8. He was so skinny, Severus wondered if he could count the boy's ribs. The clothes he had on were huge and Severus could see some bruises. He could see some blood that dried on the clothing and skin. He felt his stomach sink as he finally looked at the face. It was Harry Potter. The boy had blue spiked hair, Lily's green eyes. "Potter?"</p><p>"Freak, tell him you are staying here." Petunia's claws squeezing the boy's shoulders.</p><p>Severus didn't even wait for a response. He stunned her. When she fell over he walked closer to the boy. He stopped moving when the boy started to retreat. "Harry, I promise you, I won't hurt you. I am here to remove you from here to someplace safe." Harry tilted his head and Severus felt something strange caress his skin. "I knew your parents. They would have never wanted you to remain here." He ignored the feeling. He recognized what it was. He had the same gift. It wasn't an uncommon gift but one that was usually found in magical children who were abused. Their magic developed a way to protect them. It would allow them to know who would hurt them or not. It didn't keep them safe from their abuser but it did keep them safe from others who might do the same thing.</p><p>Harry slowly walked closer to Severus. He glanced at his fat cousin who still hadn't moved from in front of the telly. Severus didn't move as Harry touched the dark mark on his arm. "You help Harry?"</p><p>"Yes." Severus still hadn't moved. "I'm here to take you to Hogwarts. Once there, we will get you healed, some food, some clothes, and a real room for you."</p><p>Harry glanced back at the still form of his Aunt. "She bad?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"Uncle too?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>Harry walked back to the cupboard. Severus watched Harry pull out a ratty blanket and three toys. "Ready."</p><p>Severus saw the blanket that had HJP on the corner. It was the baby blanket he had given Lily for Harry the day Harry had been born. He got up and peeked inside the cupboard. He was hoping to find more clothes or even something to suggest it wasn't as bad as he was thinking it was. He found an old baby mattress on the floor. The cupboard was filled with cleaning supplies. In the farthest back corner, in crayon, was "Hary's room" written on the wall. He looked down at Petunia. "You will get yours. Karma." He refrained from cursing her as he didn't want Harry to be afraid of him.</p><p>_____________________________________________________________________</p><p>Severus had to give Harry a stomach soother on the Knight Bus. Harry was now curled up on his lap, playing with his robes. He was thinking of how to stop Dumbledore and his plans. He knew Dumbledore had to know what happened at that house. Dumbledore, after all, had been telling everyone for years how Harry was being well taken care of, how his relatives loved him, how they were making sure he was getting the proper training.</p><p>He also knew that Hagrid had been originally sent to retrieve the boy. Severus knew Dumbledore did that for a reason. It didn't make any sense as only a Professor, preferably a Head of House, was required to inform students they were magical. Granted, technically, Harry should have already known that but why Hagrid? What did Dumbledore hope to accomplish by sending Hagrid?</p><p>"What you called?" Harry tilted his head to look at his savior.</p><p>"Severus Snape. I am the Potion Master and Professor at Hogwarts."</p><p>"Pr'fssor Snap. You be my Pr'fssor." Harry snuggled into the man and went to sleep before Severus could recover.</p><p>_____________________________________________________________________</p><p>"He's still sleeping." Poppy explained as Severus and Dumbledore sat down in her office. "He is well below the average weight and height for his age. His back and legs are covered with scars. From the scan I did, I found a lot of scarring on his head. I am not sure what caused the scars but I expect him to be mentally behind. Not just from the scaring but from speaking to him. I couldn't touch him. He flinches when I get close."</p><p>"He sat on my lap on the bus." Severus wasn't sure what Dumbledore's plans were but he knew they didn't involve a mentally disabled Potter.</p><p>"I know. He said it's because you are his." Poppy pulled out a scroll. "That is his history." Severus and Dumbledore read down the very long list of injuries. "I've seen healthier torture victims. What are we going to do?"</p><p>"Can he handle first-year material?" Dumbledore wanted to kill the Dursleys.</p><p>"I am not sure. Mentally, he is behind in everything. However, he also shows signs of being extremely intelligent. It's like his mind can't match up with what he wants to say at times. He knows what he wants to say but he can't process how to say it. He doesn't like to be touched but isn't able to explain why."</p><p>"Autistic?" Severus and Poppy had studied muggle medicine and kept up with the advances when they could but they weren't up on all the new muggle advances, especially the mental health ones. They knew in a lot of ways muggles were more advanced in science and in some cases cures.</p><p>"I believe so. I did a bit of testing while I was healing him. Socially, he is at the higher end of the autistic scale. He won't have problems interacting on one on one but he will not be able to understand social boundaries or even understand why someone might want to hurt him. Mentally, he is at the level of 6 or 7 years old in regards to emotions, even speech patterns. However, he does understand complex words that I would place at a higher end of a teenager. It's like he has a dictionary memorized but doesn't know how to use the words correctly or even able to match them to emotions or how to correctly respond to a question that would fit with the words. A good example is when I asked him if he was injured. I asked him does his stomach hurt as well as his rib cage. His response was "yep, Harry hurt." When I asked for clarification, which he understood, his response was "ribs ouchies, tummy sore."</p><p>"I see. Severus?" Dumbledore looked at the results again.</p><p>"He can't return and I agree with Poppy. I don't know why he trusts me enough to let him touch him. I told you about the house. You looked at the memory. I'm frankly not surprised. He could hear the telly from his cupboard. He could have learned the words from the telly and since he couldn't see the telly he wouldn't be able to put them into context. I am going to guarantee that they weren't teaching their son anything. Harry wouldn't have been able to use the words in his life."</p><p>"I looked at Harry's records from his primary school. They agree with what I have learned."</p><p>"Do you believe he can handle first-year material?" Dumbledore didn't even want to think of what he would do if his savior wasn't able to be their savior.</p><p>"Yes, he will need Severus' help. Harry won't be able to handle Minerva's stiffness, it will scare him more. Filius' gleeful attitude would scare him because he wouldn't know how to react to it. Pomona, while gentle and sweet, she doesn't have the ability to push him when needed and to back off and let Harry work out whatever is needed. Pomona wouldn't push him forward either. She would be entirely encouraging but she is too touchy-feely for Harry also. He responded better to Severus because I believe Severus knows how to handle abused students." Poppy glanced at Severus. "Since Harry established a connection with Severus. Severus has the experience with abused students. Harry would do better with Severus. Harry would benefit from Severus range of materials he can teach to understanding when it would be too much for Harry."</p><p>"Why don't we wait until his sorting before we make that decision." Dumbledore stated. "For now, he can stay in the Infirmary."</p><p>"I am afraid that won't work. He won't like the open space to sleep in. I had to give him a Dreamless Sleep Potion. He is used to a small cupboard, Albus. He is in a strange place. He will need someone to be around for him, like Severus. I can't. If I get called away and he wakes up, I am not sure what will happen." Poppy knew Harry needed to be with Severus. Severus, coming from an abused background, would understand Harry better. She knew that Severus was one of the few staff members who had his medical license and knew about something about muggle medical issues.</p><p>Severus knew what Poppy was doing and agreed with her. "I will set up a room for him." He didn't even give Dumbledore time to respond before he was out the door. He would have to order Harry's school supplies. There was no way the boy was going to be able to handle anyone who wanted to meet the Boy-Who-Lived. He also didn't think that Harry would be able to handle all the stimulation of Diagon Alley. The boy barely handled the bus. He knew it was only because he had kept Harry on his lap.</p><p>________________________________________________________________________________</p><p>"Harry, I am going to stay with you." Severus was standing at the entrance to the Castle with Minerva. They were waiting for the boats to arrive.</p><p>Harry was bouncing in place but wouldn't let go of Severus' hand. Harry had been a bundle of nervous energy all day. He had worn out Fang after lunch while Hagrid and Severus worked on the garden. Hagrid's loud voice scared Harry at first but the half-giant toned it down. Harry got used to the man. Hagrid's gentle ways won him over but only Severus could touch him.</p><p>Most of the staff over the last month had worked with Harry. They all agreed that Harry would be able to handle the work but he would need help with social interactions. Harry would have to have someone with him all the time. They found a house elf, named Tina, who would follow Harry around. They taught Harry how to summon the elf. They found Harry would spend time playing games with the elf while Severus would brew.</p><p>"They here." Harry watched the students trudge up to the castle. He waved at his new friends. Severus had introduced him to Draco and some of his friends. Dumbledore had tried to get Harry to be friends with Ron Weasley but the boy scared Harry. Dumbledore had kept trying to force the issue until Minerva found Ron teasing Harry, and calling Severus names.</p><p>"They promised they would be, my little bat." Severus reminded Harry. They ignored Minerva's snort.</p><p>*****Flashback to about a week after Harry arrived at Hogwarts*******</p><p>"Why are you living with the greasy bat of the dungeons?" Ron pushed Harry down to the ground.</p><p>"Who?" Harry didn't like this boy. He was like his cousin.</p><p>"Snape, you know the mean old greasy bat of the dungeons." Harry went to get up but Ron pushed him back down.</p><p>"My Pr'ffsor isn't that."</p><p>"Yes, he is. He's a Death Eater, a snake. All Slytherins are evil. Don't you know that? Are you that stupid?"</p><p>"Not stupid." Harry tried to get up again. He wanted to leave and find his Pr'ffsor.</p><p>"He is so. All Slytherins are evil and he is the Head of Slytherin. So the greasy bat of the dungeons is the worst one."</p><p>"Mr. Weasley, my office now!" Minerva couldn't believe the boy. He had already been warned about his attitude.</p><p>Harry saw Severus and ran to him, wrapping his arms around the man's legs. "You bat?"</p><p>"They call me that." Severus answered.</p><p>"You bat, I little bat." Harry announced, smiling up.</p><p>"Yes, you are my little bat." Severus knew Harry was his. He was surprised at how quickly Harry had wormed his way into his heart. He had a lot of Lily in him.</p><p>****************End flashback************************</p><p>The sorting was to begin but they all knew that Harry wouldn't react well to anyone staring or making comments if they knew who he was so before any names were announced. Severus escorted Harry to the three-legged stool.</p><p>"Now?" Harry looked at Minerva.</p><p>"Now." She confirmed. They had already introduced Harry to the Sorting Hat.</p><p>Harry sat on the stool. "Well, Mr. Potter, I have been expecting you."</p><p>"Hi. I go with my bat."</p><p>The Sorting Hat snorted if you believe a noseless hat could do that. "Yes, I do agree. I see quite a mind there. They will bring it out, you little bat. Let it be-" The Sorting Hat "-Slytherin."</p><p>Harry grinned and made his way to the Slytherin table where the upper years welcomed him. "I'm a snake and a little bat." He announced, rather proudly, as he sat down.</p><p>"Yes, you are."</p><p>Severus glanced at Dumbledore who looked like he swallowed a lemon. Severus hoped the man didn't think Harry would go to Gryffindor. The boy wouldn't have made it in the house of the lions. He glanced at Ron Weasley who looked furious. He knew Dumbledore wanted Harry and Ron to be friends for a reason. Ron, however, wasn't subtle about being Harry's friend. He had heard Ron refer to Harry as his best mate. He also heard about how they would be going on adventures together, how they would have so much fun together. Ron had been bragging and it had been the day Draco and Vincent had been over to visit. Draco and Vincent got along wonderfully with Harry. Both boys looked at Harry as if he was their little brother. Severus had heard Ron informing Draco about being Harry's friend, not some snake. Draco, which he was a bit surprised by, laughed and walked away. He learned later that Draco knew Harry wouldn't care for Ron's attitude.</p><p>______________________________________________________________________</p><p>"You don't want to sleep in your dorm room?" Severus was a bit surprised to find Harry following him out of the common room after he gave his yearly opening speech. Harry had stayed behind Severus during his opening speech. Harry didn't not like people looking at him. He had been hoping that Harry would feel comfortable enough with Draco, Greg, and Vincent to remain with them. </p><p>"No, too loud." Harry held up his arms to be picked up.</p><p>"You know you do have to sleep in there, eventually." Severus picked him up and started walked toward their quarters. He wasn't sure why he was comfortable picking up Harry but he was. He normally wasn't a lovable person. Harry was small enough to be carried without any problem. "How about once classes start you attempt it?"</p><p>"No classes, I here?"</p><p>"Deal but you have to try." Severus knew Harry was very good at trying to obey.</p><p>Harry nodded his agreement and buried his head in Severus' neck. "Bat?"</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"Tired."</p><p>Severus carried Harry into his bedroom. The bedroom was painted to look like a forest with all different kind of animals which Harry had made up stories about. Draco had helped pick out the theme with Harry. So there was even a dragon in the forest, and yes, of course, a bat and a baby bat.</p>
