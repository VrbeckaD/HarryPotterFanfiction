    <p>You've heard of Sirius Black right? And you've heard of Neville Longbottom right? Well everything you think you know about them is a lie. Why you ask? Because Aaliyah Black is living proof of everything you don't know. Who's a Aaliyah Black you ask? Well read below to find out just who she is.</p>
<p>Aaliyah Black isn't an only child. Oh no she's not. She's the half twin-sister of Neville Longbottom. How you ask? Well when her mother Alice Longbottom was trying to get pregnant with her husband Frank Longbottom, Aaliyah's father Sirius Black asked Alice and Frank if Alice could be a surrogate for him.Â  They agreed and the rest was history. Now I know what you're thinking "but that still doesn't explain how their twins?" Well that's simple. Once Alice got pregnant with Sirius' baby, she also found out that she was pregnant with her husband's baby. Now there's one more piece of information that none of the books mentioned about Neville Longbottom and that would that he has a curse on him. Well on him and Aaliyah.</p>
