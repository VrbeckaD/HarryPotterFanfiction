But his friend was lying dead a few feet away from him, so if that didn't get him into trouble, then he didn't know what would. </p><p>Oh yeah, and Lord Voldemort had risen. But he was bound to do that sooner or later, right?</p><p>"Ah..." Voldemort took his first breath of air. Not out of his nose though, gross. "Mister Potter, we meet at last."</p><p>Silence. Uh, what was he supposed to say to that? </p><p>"You're a lot uglier than when you showed up in my dreams."</p><p>Another silence. Voldemort blinked. </p><p>"...that is the rudest thing anyone has ever said to me."</p><p>And that was probably saying a lot. He looked like an uncircumcised penis.</p></div>
