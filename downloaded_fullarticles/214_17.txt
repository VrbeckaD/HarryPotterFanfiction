    <p>“Why is the Minister of Magic coming to our Halloween feast?” Ron asks trying to fix the dress robes he hates.</p><p>“To show good relations between Hogwarts and the Ministry. Honestly, it’s just a PR stunt. But we get to dress up and have a bigger party than normal so I’m not complaining.” Hermione replied, and with a quick flick of her wand transfiguring Ron’s old, hideous dress robes into normal black ones like Harry’s. Ron gives his soulmate a grateful look before pulling her into his arms and placing a hard kiss on Hermione’s lips.</p><p>“Ok, ok you two we get it, you’re soulmates. Jeez, you two are as bad as Harry and Ginny.” You chuckle while rolling your eyes at them. </p><p>Your best friends had all found their soulmates, Hermione and Ron, Harry and Ginny, Neville and Luna, hell even Draco Malfoy, the biggest git of them all had found his soulmate (Pansy Parkinson). But you were still searching. It was hard being one of the only seventh years at Hogwarts without a soulmate, scratch that THE ONLY seventh year at Hogwarts without a soulmate. You were trying to hold out hope but it was difficult when every other person in your year had found their soulmates. Most of the fifth and sixth years had found theirs as well. </p><p>“Oh just you wait, Y/L/N, I bet once you meet your soulmate the two of you will be all over each other.” Hermione teases as she pulls away from Ron.</p><p>“If I ever meet him.” You mutter hoping her, Ginny and Luna wouldn’t hear. But they did of course.</p><p>“Y/F/N Y/M/N Y/L/N! You will find your soulmate soon!” Ginny yelled as she rushed across the room towards you.</p><p>“You will find him when you least expect it.” Said Luna’s misty voice.</p><p>“Don’t you dare give up hope!” Hermione shouts.</p><p>“Guys calm down. Imagine how Y/n feels, seeing everyone else happy with their soulmate and she’s all alone. It’s got to be hard to have to keep the hope up. While we all know she'll find him, it probably gets hard to remember. We love you Y/n/n and we know you will find your soulmate but it’s ok if you need us to help you keep the faith. That’s what friends are for.” Harry says giving her a quick hug.</p><p>“Thanks, Harry. Alright, we better get going.” You reply trying to stop the tears from spilling. Your familiar Boo, an all-white cocker spaniel poodle mix, came up and licked a stray tear away. Normally dogs weren’t allowed at Hogwarts, however, given the connection you shared, Dumbledore and McGonagall made an exception.</p><p>“Yes please, I’m starving,” Ron answers, putting his stomach. Hermione slaps his arm.</p><p>“You’re always hungry!” She exclaims with a giggle. The seven of you, Harry and Ginny, Ron and Hermione, Neville and Luna (Luna had gotten ready with you), and you all walked down from Gryffindor tower to the Great Hall.</p><p>As you approach the Great Hall you get an odd feeling in your stomach, like butterflies. Could it be that you might meet your soulmate tonight? People didn’t have external markers to show who your soulmate was, everyone always said they just knew. Love at first sight and all that. It was difficult to explain but everybody always said you would know when it happened. You push the feeling away not wanting to get your hopes up. </p><p>“You lot over here now!” You heard Professor McGonagall yell at you and your friends. You knew you were a little later than you should’ve been but didn’t think it would be a big deal. Boy, were you wrong.</p><p>“20 points each from Gryffindor, and Ravenclaw respectively,” she whispered yells at all of you. “For your tardiness, need I remind you the Minister of Magic is coming tonight. He will be here at any moment and the students are supposed to be seated by now. Hurry along!” She turns and the rest of your group heads towards the Hall but you’re stuck in place. Something is holding you in place and then he walks in. </p><p>You had seen pictures of course but nothing could compare to the real-life image of him. He was extremely dashing, he had hardly aged from his Hogwarts years. Looking just as dashing as ever at 35.</p><p>“Y/n, let’s go,” Ginny whispers trying to urge you to follow them but you can’t. </p><p>It’s him, it has to be. Just then a look of realization comes across his face and he looks around until his eyes land on you.</p><p>“Miss Y/L/N, get into the Hall.” Professor McGonagall commands looking slightly embarrassed that one of her students is making googly eyes at the Minister of Magic. What McGonagall failed to notice was the Minister making those eyes right back at the Gryffindor girl. </p><p>“Minister Riddle, I apologize profusely for Miss Y/L/N’s behavior, she is usually such an exceptional girl, I have no idea what has gotten into her.” McGonagall huffs in annoyance and slight embarrassment. But Tom waves her off and walks towards you.</p><p>“Hello, I’m Tom. You are?” He asks simply enchanted by his soulmate. You were his soulmate. He had been searching for you for so long and he finally found you. </p><p>“Y/F/N.” You whisper shocked. The most powerful (and handsome) wizard in your world was your soulmate.</p><p>“Well, Tom I guess you finally found her after all these years.” Dumbledore chuckles. He and Tom hadn’t gotten along well Tom’s first few years at Hogwarts, however, by his sixth year, the two were incredibly close. Tom has shifted his focus from merely mastering the Dark Arts to mastering them in order to fight them. He had become the greatest Auror the Ministry had seen and eventually the Minister of Magic.</p><p>“Found who? Albus, what is going on?” Professor McGonagall asks confused.</p><p>“Minerva, Albus, I would like you to meet my soulmate,” Tom replies not taking his eyes off of you.</p><p>“WHAT?” Your friends all shout in shock. </p><p>“He’s my soulmate.” You reply turning back to your friends with a smile.</p><p>“You lot go take your seats this instant,” McGonagall commands your friends, still shocked. Your friends comply though their jaws are practically on the floor.</p><p>“Make sure there is a place for Y/F/N next to me at the head table please.” Tom requests of McGonagall who rushes into the Great Hall to make sure there is a seat for her beside Tom.</p><p>“Albus, I would like it if she enters with me and we announce that she is my soulmate tonight. What year are you darling?” He asks tucking back a stray piece of your hair.</p><p>“I’m in my seventh year.” You answer blushing at the heated gaze he is giving you.</p><p>“Good. And your family?”</p><p>“My parents died a year ago. My mum was a witch and my father a muggle. They left me a sizable inheritance, I have a loft in Diagon Alley where I stay in the summers. It’s just me and Boo now.” You reply, startled when his eyes darken.</p><p>“Who is Boo?” He asks harshly.</p><p>“My dog, he’s my familiar.” You explain the fire in his eyes dying down. </p><p>“Thank Merlin.” He murmurs before pulling you closer and pressing his lips down against yours in a hard, possessive kiss.</p><p>“Jealous handsome?” You ask jokingly when he finally lets you up for air.</p><p>“You have no idea darling.” He answers wrapping and arm around you and pulling you close.</p><p>“Headmaster, Minister, we are ready whenever you are.” Professor Flitwick announces as he emerges from the Hall. He shoots you and Tom a curious glance but says nothing and walks back into the hall.</p><p>“Well Tom, Miss Y/L/N, shall we?” Dumbledore asks motioning you into the Great Hall. Tom keeps his arm around your shoulders and tucks you in close to his side. </p><p>The three of you enter the Great Hall and when you do you hear a number of gasps and shocked looks on everyone’s faces, students and professors alike. Your friends however just look confused and slightly worried but you shoot them a smile and nod slightly hoping to ease their concerns. </p><p>Dumbledore leads you and Tom to the front of the hall and stood at his podium. Tom stands beside Dumbledore and moves his arm from your shoulders, holding your hand instead. </p><p>“Happy Halloween everyone! It’s an extra special Halloween as we have our esteemed Minister of Magic joining us. I believe he has a few things he would like to say to you.” Dumbledore says as he ushers Tom over and steps off to the side. Tom walks over towards the podium dragging you by your hand along with him.</p><p>“Hello, Hogwarts students and staff. It is my great pleasure to be here with you all this Halloween. I also have a very special announcement for you all this evening. I have found my soulmate at long last. This beautiful young lady next to me, Y/F/N Y/L/N is my soulmate. Now let the feast commence!” He says with that signature smirk of his. He guides you towards the head table, where he pulls out a chair for you and then sits down next to you, keeping his eyes on you the whole time. Dumbledore claps his hands twice and the food appears on everyone’s tables. Instead of the usual house tables, there were smaller circular tables for smaller groups of people to sit. </p><p>“So you mentioned that your parents passed away?” Tom asks hesitantly looking at you.</p><p>“Yeah, they were in an accident last summer, a car crash. But they left me a small fortune, my mother was from an old pureblood family to which she was the sole heir. I have a small loft in Diagon Alley, for in the summers. But other than that it’s just me and Boo. He’s the cutest little puppy.” You explain with a smile.</p><p>“I’m sorry for your loss. But you needn’t worry about that loft anymore. If you give me the address I can send some of my people to collect your things and move them to my manor.” He offers before taking a bite of his food. </p><p>“Oh, that’s not necessary-“ you say before he cuts you off.</p><p>“Yes, it is. After the feast tonight we shall move you into my manor.” He announces as if it's a fact.</p><p>“Excuse me. What about Hogwarts?” You ask slightly annoyed that he seemed to have everything planned without even bothering to run it past you.</p><p>“We can have tutors brought in to help you finish the rest of your schooling if you really want to. Or you don’t have to finish at all if you don’t want to.” He says as though it’s common sense.</p><p>“I want to finish at Hogwarts though. I want to graduate with my friends.” You argue. While he may be your soulmate and the Minister of Magic that didn’t give him the right to demand you quit Hogwarts.</p><p>“We can discuss it later.” He replies dismissively. You know he has no intention of changing his mind but he doesn’t want to argue right after meeting you, let alone in front of everyone. </p><p>The two of you talk all through dinner and the rest of the staff stares on in amazement. Most of them had taught Tom while he was at school or had heard a lot about him. And in all their years of knowing him they had never seen him smile, he always had a smirk but never a genuine smile. Until now. After dinner and before the dancing began Dumbledore and Tom had another announcement to make.</p><p>“This year the ministry has decided to once again host the Triwizard tournament. Our friends from Durmstrang and Beauxbatons will be joining us tomorrow afternoon. During the next week, you will have a chance to decide if you wish to compete in the tournament. Minister Riddle has a few things to add.” Dumbledore says allowing Tom to take the stage.</p><p>“We have decided that only students 17 or older may compete. I understand many of you will be upset and disappointed in this decision. However, I would like to stress that this is an incredibly dangerous tournament. These tasks are designed to test you, the tasks are not easy, and you could be seriously hurt or even killed. Therefore, we are limiting it to of age students, who we believe are best able to make that decision for themselves. If it goes well, we may decide to continue having the tournament in future years and then you all will have the chance to participate, should you wish to. Happy Halloween everyone! I cannot wait to see you all at the selection of champions and then at the tasks. Good luck to you all!” He announces before turning around and heading towards you. He bows before you and offers you his hand.</p><p>“May I have this dance my darling?” He asks with a cheeky grin.</p><p>“But of course my love.” You reply, taking his hand and the two of you join everyone else dancing.</p><p>“So the Triwizard Tournament, eh?” You ask slightly stunned by the announcement you were sure that Harry would enter and probably Ron and maybe even Ginny. You, however, weren’t really interested in competing but you were excited to witness it.</p><p>“Yup, I was a Triwizard champion you know. But two years after I won, a champion died so it was suspended. We’ve put new rules in place to hopefully prevent any future mishaps.” He explains holding you tight.</p><p>“Maybe I should put my name in huh?” You tease but as soon as the words leave your tongue Tom’s eyes blaze with rage.</p><p>“Absolutely not! I forbid it!” He growled, tightening his grip on you before pulling you off the dance floor. </p><p>“I will not allow you to participate in such a dangerous event, ever. I will give you anything you could dream of as long as you stay safe. I will not allow you to be put in danger. Do you understand?” He says harshly gripping your shoulders tightly.</p><p>“Yes, Tom. I was only teasing I don’t want to enter the tournament. I’m sorry I upset you.” You mutter looking down slightly ashamed. He just wanted to protect you and you had made him think you wanted to put yourself in danger.</p><p>“I’m sorry for how I reacted. It’s just, I waited so long to find you and I can’t allow anything to harm you.” He explains pressing a soft kiss to your forehead.</p><p>“I understand. It’s ok.” You reply leaning into him and wrapping your arms around his neck.</p><p>“What do ya say we get out of here?” He asks with a smirk.</p><p>“And go where?” You ask with a chuckle.</p><p>“Our place.” He answers bluntly.</p><p>“Tom-“ you begin but he cuts you off.</p><p>“You are my soulmate. My place is your place now. Just for tonight at least. Tomorrow is a day off anyway and then it’s the weekend. We can work out arrangements for the rest of the year over the weekend. Get a plan together.” He phrases it like a suggestion but you already know better. Tom Riddle was a man who got exactly what he wanted. And what he wanted now was you.</p>
