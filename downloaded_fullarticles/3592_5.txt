    <p>The Rune Thief paused at the doors of the throne room and eyed them from top to bottom.  He squinted and touched a small squiggly rune on the side of the goggles he wore, and his spell sight flared to life.  With a satisfied nod, he eyed the doors again, using this sight to search for any alarms.</p><p>When the shuffling of a guard patrolling the corridor sounded behind him, he wrapped his cloak tightly around his thin frame and slipped into a darkened alcove. As the guard passed by his hiding spot he didn’t dare to even breathe until the guard had passed.  Once the echoing footsteps retreated, he returned to his contemplation of the door.</p><p>His lips stretched into an easy grin when he finally saw the alarm spell in the top right corner.  Quickly slipping to the wall he used his finger to draw a circular rune with two lines slashed through it on the surface. He touched the palm of his left hand to the rune and then quickly did the same for his right.  Nodding to himself he knelt and did the same near the floor, touching the toes of his soft slippers to the runes on the wall before he used them to ascend hand over hand up the wall.</p><p>At the top of the wall, he tapped the spell in a few places and quickly scrawled his disabling rune, a V shape with a small circle inside of it, over the alarm rune. After another smug smile he dropped with a catlike grace and slipped inside the now open door of the throne room. He quickly pressed himself against a darkened wall just inside, eyeing where the moonlight spilled onto the floor and partly onto a small, jeweled chest.</p><p>He breathed a deep sigh of relief and skittered across the floor, reaching hungrily for the chest when the torches along the walls flared to life. He froze, hands outstretched, heart thundering in his ears.  The spellsight faded in the light and he blinked at the sight on the throne in front of him.</p><p>The man on the throne peered down at him frowning before it turned into, from what he could tell, a genuine smile.  “Well done,” he said, and clapped.</p><p>The thief relaxed, long enough to bow floridly, before he made a break for the window and ran headlong into a shield spell.  He shook his head to clear it and glared up at the man on the throne.</p><p>“<em>That</em> was not so well done.”  The man laughed at him, “Did you really think I would let you loose, now that I have you trapped where I want you?”</p><p>The thief shrugged and started inching towards the door.  There were no guards in the room; he could make it back through quite easily.</p><p>The man, <em>King</em>, his brain helpfully supplied, sighed and swung his legs up over the arm of his chair.  </p><p>“You have only two options, I’m afraid.”  He said in a bored voice, “You can either stay here, marry me, and become co-ruler at my side,” The King’s black eyes glittered and the thief did not trust that gaze, “Or,” he continued, “You can get hauled to the dungeon by my guards.”</p><p>  Raising his eyebrows he smiled and said, “I hear they are dreadfully cold and musty this time of year.” Pulling candle from a small box he set it up on the arm of his throne.  “You have until the candle runs out to decide.”</p><p>The thief considered his options and tried very hard to ignore the way the man’s sinuous voice flowed over him like water.  He knew he’d taken a risk breaking into the Palace of King Severus Snape. <em>I really ought to face the consequences for buggering this job up</em>. On the one hand, he was sure he could break out of any dungeon, but on the other… He could start making real changes.  He could make things better for him and his friends from the inside. <em>He’s not too bad looking either.</em>  The Thief eyed the King up and down and opened his mouth with a grin, his voice saccharine, “What if I told you to go bugger yourself?”</p><p>King Severus blinked at him for a moment before he started to laugh and for some reason that laugh made the thief’s toes curl.“I would tell you no one but my consort is allowed to speak to me in such a manner.”</p><p>The thief pretended to muse on it for a few moments more before he sighed, “Fine.  If I want the joys of telling you to go bugger yourself without the joys of dungeon rats,” He pulled down the hood of his cloak and pushed his goggles up into his messy black hair.  “Fine.  You win.  Just,” he paused and fixed the man on the throne with a determined eye, “You don’t get to touch me.  I’ll sleep in the same room and present a united front to whomever you want but you <em>do not</em> touch me.  I’ll slice you open if you do.”</p><p>The King just smiled that smile at him and he could feel the first vestiges of panic at his situation.  “Good,” The man practically purred.  “Very good.  Now,” he dropped one leg off the arm of his throne, “Do you have a name?”</p><p>“Harry, my liege.  No surname. Just Harry.”</p><p>“Well, Harry,” Severus said it slowly as if he were tasting the word, “You can have mine, and by all rights as my betrothed, may call me Severus.  None of this… liege nonsense.”</p><p>“Until there is a ring on this finger and I've acquired your last name, my King, you will continue to be my liege.” Harry grinned at him</p><p>Harry watched heat flare in the man’s eyes. “I do hope your prohibition doesn’t last too long.”</p><p>“I’m not giving up my freedom to be someone’s pet in golden chains,”  Harry replied with a challenging glare.</p><p>“I see…” the King mused.  He worried his bottom lip with his teeth a moment and Harry steeled himself for the inevitable order. But: “That is not what I offer, be at ease.  Return to your home and meet me back here in three days time for the ceremony.”  He smirked. “You may choose yourself how you wish to make an entrance.”  He steepled his long thin fingers.</p><p>“How do you know that I won’t just bugger off and never come back?” Harry asked, unable to stop himself. “Are you stupid?”</p><p>Severus actually laughed at him. “You’re a smart young man. Do you want me to threaten your family?  I can if you want.”</p><p>“Don’t have any family.” Harry mumbled.</p><p>“Well, in that case there’s not much I can do, is there?”  He hummed, “What about this, Harry.  You come back in three days, marry me, and I’ll give you unrestricted access to the warded royal library.”</p><p>Harry choked on his sharp inhalation.  “Are you serious?”</p><p>“As the plague.” Severus held up a hand.  “The magic on that place is so intrinsically tied to the throne that I knew you could not have made it in yet to pillage it for it’s magical tomes. Wed me and I will let you in.”</p><p>Harry clenched his teeth.  There went any hope of him running out on this. “Fine.  Fine,” he ground out and then ran from the room out the door he came through.</p><p>With a frustrated application of his forehead to the wall, he clambered back up to the ceiling and set himself up in a shadowed spot just inside the door. Harry watched from the shadows as his King, <em>and betrothed,</em> some treacherous part of his mind whispered, paced around before yanking on a red bellpull and a red liveried servant came from a side door and bowed.</p><p>“You rang, your majesty?”</p><p>“Yes,” King Severus said, “I need you to wake the court Wizard and tell him to come here at once.”</p><p>“As your Majesty commands.”  The servant bowed again and scurried from the room.</p><p>Harry watched as not four minutes later a bespectacled and robed man with a very long beard bustled into the throne room.  “Severus,” he greeted with warmth, “Why call me out of my bed at this hour?”</p><p>Severus beamed.“I’m getting married in three days.  I need you to prepare the rituals, Albus.”</p><p>The old man beamed at Severus, “Finally, my boy.  Finally.  Who is the young noble that’s finally drawn your attention?”</p><p>Severus’ smirk grew. “Not a noble, Albus.  The Rune Thief was here tonight.”</p><p>Silence.</p><p>“You caught him?”  Albus asked after several very tense minutes. “And why the shift in subject?”</p><p>“You're usually much more on top of these things, old friend.”</p><p>Albus gaped at him for a few moments. “Severus, you cannot be serious.”</p><p>“When have you known me to be jovial, Albus?” Severus contradicted himself with a laugh. “He has agreed and will be back in three days’ time for the ceremony.” Harry spotted a small, wistful smile.  “After all this time of seeking him, he has agreed to be mine. I cannot wait until I can sit him down and talk with him and worship him the way he deserves.”</p><p>Harry blushed hot and fierce under his goggles and hood. He nodded to himself, not needing to hear more as he slipped away into the night.</p><p>Once he was out on the streets, another small rune stitched into his clothes gave them the illusion of peasants’ garb and he ran home, feet pounding the cobbles and gasping at the cold air until he thought his lungs would burst. The stone buildings all around him blurred as he let his feet carry him home.</p><p>When the abandoned cathedral that he called home finally came into view, he slowed, breathing hard.  His thoughts whirled and tumbled around each other so much that he didn’t even notice there was someone waiting for him until he ran headlong into their chest.</p><p>“Pup!” His godfather peered down at him, concerned.  “Are you all right?  You never lose yourself like this.”  Then he paused.  “Did you get it?”</p><p>Harry laughed, the noise bubbling out of him in half hysterical sobs, “No, no I didn’t.”</p><p>“What’s wrong?!”  Sirius framed Harry’s face with his hands and searched his eyes.</p><p>“Hush, Sirius.” Remus startled Harry with how quiet he’d come up to them from the side. “Do not stress him even more.”</p><p>“I didn’t get it,” Harry muttered, “And I have to go back in three days.”</p><p>“What, why?”  Remus asked.</p><p>“The king caught me,”  Harry mumbled, “And he only let me go because I agreed to marry him.”</p><p>The silence that followed after his last statement deafened him. He flinched when he thought about the inevitable explosion when Sirius finally worked through what was happening.</p><p>Sirius made a strangled noise and flexed his fingers in a very suggestive manner.  “I’m going to kill him,”  he said very quietly.</p><p>Harry’s eyes flew open in panic and he shook his head frantically.  “You <em>can’t</em>.  This is my chance to change things, to make him listen!”</p><p>“You have no idea <em>what</em> he is capable of, Harry!” Sirius snarled.  “You have no idea how long that man has been in cahoots with,” Harry watched him take a deep breath, cutting off what he was going to say.  “He’s not a good man, Harry.  The four of us… Me, Remus, and your parents were once part of the court and he,” Sirius’ voice had grown louder, “He’s <em>evil</em>.  You have to understand that.  He’s not going to let you change anything!  He’s the one that did this to us!  Snivillus might as well not be human.  He’s a block of stone!”</p><p>“You know, dearest,” Remus interjected with a wince, “you must admit the country has gotten better with Severus in charge of things.  He has Albus and Minerva to advise and help him, after all.”</p><p>“Oh yes,” Sirius bit at the words like a dog biting meat from a bone, “He has two old and powerless aristocrats to help him with the peasantry.  Yes, I’m feeling so relieved!” He tugged at his long, dark hair in frustration.</p><p>Harry inched away from the two of them, eyes narrowed.  This was not at all like he had planned tonight to go.</p><p>“Dearest,” Remus said again, soft and gentle.  “Do think, will you?  Once Harry is married to the King you, as family, will have immunity because I have a… feeling, if you will, that Severus does not want to harm him.”  He turned to Harry, “What did he say to you?”</p><p>Harry laughed. “I told him to go bugger himself, at first.  Then I told him that I wasn’t going to be a pet on a golden chain and he told me that he would never do that.”  Harry sighed, shoulders slumping with weariness.  “He said he wouldn’t.  Besides,” he grinned, “I can always get free if life becomes too unbearable.  I’m the best there is.”</p><p>Sirius looked to Harry as if he were going to argue more and then he sighed. “I’ll trust your wolfish instincts, love.”  Then he perked up as the full impact of Remus’ words sank in.  “Immunity you say?  Does this mean I can prank him and make his life miserable and get away with it?”</p><p>Harry rolled his eyes as Remus laughed and kissed his mate’s cheek.  “That’s exactly what it means.  Just make sure you don’t go too far.  I’m sure Harry will only be able to have <em>so much</em> influence on what happens.”</p><p>“I’m sure you both overestimate my influence here, <em>Snuffles</em>.” Harry grinned at his godfather.  </p><p>“I’m wounded, pup.”  Sirius pressed the back of his wrist, palm out, to his forehead and swooned a bit, leaning on Remus.  “You catch me snuggling with my mate and this is the punishment I have to endure?”</p><p>“You were cuddling him in wolf form with your nose buried in his fur.  You deserve it.”  Harry laughed.  “Now, if you’ll excuse me, I really need to go tell Ron and Hermione.”</p><p>“Tomorrow, Harry,” Remus shook his head.  “It's late, and you need sleep.  Go up to bed and we’ll be up soon.”</p><p>“After you two get done snogging like teenagers,” Harry muttered. “Fine, fine.  I’m twenty years old and I’m still getting bullied and mothered.  I see how it is.”  He gave them both a mocking salute before he scurried up the rope that led to the bell tower and his “room.”  Once there he curled up in the massive pile of pillows that served as his bed thinking of a way to keep from getting caught again.</p><p>Harry grabbed his notebook full of runes and scribbled a few things into the margins. Taking a pillow and placing it in front of him he drew a rune for silence (a triangle) and drew a rune for sight (a crossroads) over top of it.</p><p>The runes glowed red for a moment before the pillow fabric went see through.</p><p>He let out a whoop of satisfaction before cancelling the rune mashup.  The feathers were still visible inside of the pillow, but he was off to a good start.  If this worked, he could embroider the rune directly into the cloak Remus said his father had left him.</p><p>If it worked.</p>
