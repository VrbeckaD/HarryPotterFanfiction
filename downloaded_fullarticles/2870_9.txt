    <p>Harry POV<br/>
Draco Malfoy was standing with his back to the door, his hands clutching<br/>
either side of the sink, his white-blond head bowed.</p>
<p>"Don't," crooned Moaning Myrtle's voice from one of the cubicles.</p>
<p>"Don't. . . tell me what's wrong ... I can help you. . . ."</p>
<p>"No one can help me," said Malfoy. His whole body was shaking. "I can't<br/>
do it. ... I can't. ... It won't work . . . and unless I do it soon ... he says he'll<br/>
kill me. ..."</p>
<p>And Harry realized, with a shock so huge it seemed to root him to the<br/>
spot, that Malfoy was crying -- actually crying -- tears streaming down his<br/>
pale face into the grimy basin. Malfoy gasped and gulped and then, with a<br/>
great shudder, looked up into flu-cracked mirror and saw Harry staring at<br/>
him over his shoulder.</p>
<p>“W-What d-do you w-want Potter” Malfoy tried to wipe away the tears before I saw, but we both knew it was too late. </p>
<p>“Why are you crying?” I don’t know why but seeing Malfoy do anything but sneer made me uncomfortable.</p>
<p>“Like you c-care” Malfoy stuttered seeming frustrated with the turn of events and his new stutter.</p>
<p>“Why can’t you just answer my bloody question” He is always so difficult, was it so hard to just answer one question without asking more.</p>
<p>“Because it’s none of your business” Malfoy was gaining his confidence again now that his stutter was gone. I need to get answer out of him fast before he hexes me.</p>
<p>“Answer me Malfoy. Why are you crying and who’s going to kill you?” I softened my voice at the end kind of fearing the answer I might receive. By mentioning why Malfoy was in the bathroom seemed to reopen the wound that never really healed to begin with. He proceeded to burst into tears again and turned back towards the sink with his head bowed.</p>
<p>“P-Potter p-please j-just go, p-please don’t p-pretend you c-care” Draco half sobbed half stuttered. The fact that Draco Malfoy allowed himself to be this vulnerable in front of him scared him even more especially when Malfoy said please.</p>
<p>“Malfoy whatever it is, let’s go tell Dumbledore i’m sure he… “ Before I could finish my sentence Malfoy shot around and screamed </p>
<p>“NO, no I c-can’t talk to P-Professor Dumbledore, it w-will only make it worse please I’ll never bother you again just please l-leave it alone” Why does Malfoy keep saying please he never says please but at this point I don’t care whatever has him this scared can’t be good I need to tell Dumbledore whether Draco Malfoy likes it or not while I was thinking of ways to get Malfoy to go with me to Dumbledore I looked up and Malfoy was staring at me with his grey eyes that looked so empty and he uttered one sentence that I new would change my life whether it was a good change or a bad change. </p>
<p>“Harry please the Dark Lord has my Mom if I don’t do what he wants he’ll kill her I can’t lose her” I could tell the toll it took on Malfoy's body as he fell to the floor and wept I was to concerned with the blond to focus on the fact that Draco Malfoy called me by my first name, or the fact that it didn’t bother me.</p>
