    <p>‘Damn the Dursleys’ was Harry’s first thought as he rounded the corner at a sprint. ‘And damn butter and eggs to the furthest recesses of hell.’ His second and third thoughts were expletives of immense creativity and rudeness, and the rest of his brainpower he directed toward finding an escape. Harry imagined things might’ve been easier had he been able to use magic, but after the close call he had with the ministry last summer, wherein he fought off <em>two bloody dementors</em> and was very promptly threatened with expulsion from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, he decided not to risk exposure in the middle of a Muggle residential street. There was only so much leeway the Boy-Who-Lived would be allowed. Harry glanced behind him as he ran, wincing at the stitch in his side all the while, and tried to see through the blood and sweat that had gotten in his eyes. Yes, the man was still following him, though he too looked winded.</p><p>See he should’ve known from the minute he woke up drenched in sweat and crying that his day would go badly. Harry could only recall the familiar dark eyes and swirls of tangible, scratchy magic that had plagued his dream, but the rest was lost to him. Slipped through his fingers like silt as he awoke.</p><p>His aunt had no sympathy for the tired boy, as the minute he came into the kitchen after his morning ministrations she very nastily demanded he go to the store and pick up a few groceries she needed. Though, in what Harry considered a heroic effort, he managed to hold off rolling his eyes at her, Petunia’s keen eyes spotted an attitude and as such she gave him a nice little telling off before tossing some notes at him and sending him on his, in her words, ‘no good, delinquent way.’</p><p>After he had purchased the few odds and ends Aunt Petunia had listed, he had begun to make his way home. Harry had felt that something was off, the hairs on the back of his neck were raised and he felt the familiar tingle of residual magic, similar and not to Diagon Alley. Harry heard scuffling and looked back to see a man walking the same way. There was something different about the man, though he looked remarkably normal with graying hair and a relaxed gait. He wore muggle clothing in time with the current trends, all of it matched and casual, looking to the casual observer as though he was just out for a quick walk. Harry knew, however, that appearances were deceiving and his instincts told him not to trust the man’s supposed harmlessness.</p><p>Harry sped up and rounded another corner, looking back to find the man had gone. ‘Maybe he hadn’t been trailing me,’ Harry thought as he scanned his surroundings carefully, ‘Maybe I’m just being para-.’ WHAM. Harry felt the force of a spell hit him in his side and knock him to the ground, Aunt Petunia’s eggs and cream cushioned his fall only slightly, while his forehead impacted with the pavement with a THWAP. A weight settled on his back and pinned him to the ground, leaving him unable to reach to his wand in his back pocket. Harry heard huffing and puffing from above him and he could feel legs on either side of his torso as the man began chanting. Harry’s arms flailed around in his search for leverage, something to grasp onto, a rock, anything, before they found a small can of tuna.</p><p>He then swung one long arm around and tossed the can in the general vicinity of the breathing, hearing a satisfying THUNK, a few swears, and feeling the man shift. This was all Harry needed in order to twist and dislodge his attacker. He kicked at the vague shimmery form indicative of a Disillusionment Charm and broke into a run, sprinting around corners and through Little Whinging like a man possessed.</p><p>The bloodied boy looked back once more to find the man had shed his Disillusionment and was gaining on him. ‘Right, bugger the Ministry.’ Harry thought as he whipped out his wand.</p><p>“Stupefy!” He shouted as he threw his wand arm behind him.</p><p>The gray haired man deflected and threw a nonverbal orange spell of his own.</p><p>“Potter!” The man bellowed. “Potter, wait! Harry James Potter!”</p><p>Harry ignored the man and opted instead to cut through the alley. He recognized the streets now. They were very close to St. George’s, his primary school, and Harry knew how to get to safety from there if the Ministry Aurors didn’t arrive on time. Luckily, he heard the tell tale pop of a wizard Apparating nearby.</p><p>“Harry!” A familiar voice called. “Stupefy! Harry look out!” But it was too late,in the split second he had turned on instinct towards the voice (Remus’ he noted) the enemy wizard managed to knock him flat with another nonverbal spell, catch up, grab Harry’s arm, and began chanting again. The last thing Harry saw was Remus’ outstretched hand, reaching, but grasping nothing but air just inches from where Harry and the man disappeared in a flash of orange lightning.</p><hr/><p>“Boy.” Harry heard a muffled, fuzzy voice call gently. He groaned. His eyes snapped open, before he shut them against the light with another groan.</p><p>“Aye, looks like you took a rather good knock to the noggin if that bump is anything to go by. Ah yes, there’s a good chap. Open those eyes. Slowly now, slowly.” Harry was pleased to note he could open his eyes without it feeling like a pike had been very suddenly driven through the top of his skull. Once his vision stopped spinning he began to recognize the sterile, white walls and the smell of fresh linen. Why, it was the Hogwart’s infirmary! He bolted up into a sitting position and looked towards the source of the voice. It was an elderly man, not the same that had been chasing him. The man had a short rounded nose and a round face. His hair was all white save for a few strands here and there that stubbornly remained black, and he had a slight hunch. Harry recognized the wizard. He had seen his portrait in Professor Dumbledore's office not even two months ago, when the previous Hogwarts headmaster, Armando Dippet, had scolded him for his breakdown after Sirius…after the events in the Department of Mysteries. It took him a few moments to realize the professor had been speaking.</p><p>“-took us by surprise, of course. It’s not every day a bloodied boy falls from the sky in a flash of lightning. Especially on a rather sunny day. Lucky our own Professor Dumbledore had been on one of those strolls he so loves taking. Oh here’s me rambling on. Do you speak English then?”</p><p>Harry’s head was swimming. He chose not to be insulted as he had just been staring at the headmaster with his mouth near touching the floor. That didn't stop him from interjecting a little bit of dryness into his voice.</p><p>“Yes I speak English. Sir. I’m just… I'm really rather confused. Have I-have I been trapped in a portrait or...I-this is Hogwarts isn't it? You said Professor Dumbledore found me?”</p><p>“Portrait? What on Earth do you mean portrait? That bump must've rattled you a bit more than we thought.” He exclaimed, sounding a bit bemused. “Madame Bobbit will get you fixed up straight away.<br/> “Madame Bobbit!” Professor Dippet called.</p><p>“Yes. <em>Yes</em>, headmaster I can hear you perfectly fine! Now scoot a bit.” A middle aged woman, no doubt the Madame Bobbit that had been summoned by the former headmaster, came out from Madame Pomfrey’s office. She was short and very slightly plump with broad shoulders and a stern face. Her mousey brown hair was streaked with only a few strands of gray and was tucked away under her nurse’s cap very neatly.</p><p>“Alrighty deary,” She began as she pulled her wand from her sleeve. “Why don’t we start wi-” The doors of the infirmary opened, cutting Madame Bobbit off soundly. A man walked in. He was wearing bright green robes with sky blue pegasi flying about on them. It all clashed horribly with his graying auburn hair and beard. It wasn’t until Harry met the man’s ice blue eyes, spotting the twinkle that nearly always shined, that he recognized who it was.</p><p>“Professor Dumbledore!” Harry exclaimed. The professor stopped in his tracks, looking rather taken aback.</p><p>“Ah.” Dumbledore said slowly. “I’m afraid I can’t return such an enthused hello.”</p><p>“Albus, this is...well we haven’t gotten his name yet, but the poor boy seems to be under the impression he’s been trapped in a portrait. I imagine it’s the bump on his head, but-”</p><p>“Ahem,” Madame Bobbit said crossly. “If I could <em>get on with my examination</em>.” Dippet quieted, looking properly chastised, while Professor Dumbledore motioned for her to continue with a smile. Harry thought it looked more cheeky than charming, but it seemed to appease the matronly nurse.</p><p>“Why don’t I start with some diagnostics. These spells won’t hurt dear, so don’t you worry.” She told him soothingly, waving her wand in front of his forehead and muttering to herself.</p><p>“There doesn’t seem to be any major damage, no internal bleeding, or bone breaks. Can you tell me your full name darling?”</p><p>“Harry James Potter.” Harry dutifully replied.</p><p>“And how old are you?”</p><p>“Fifteen.”</p><p>“Alright Mr. Potter, the date now if you’d please.”</p><p>“July 17, 1996.” It grew very quiet.</p><p>“Mr. Potter, I- surely you can’t mean...Albus! How did you say you found him? How exactly?” Harry wasn’t an idiot, and he certainly wasn’t so oblivious as to miss the shock on all three adults’ faces. He was very quickly catching on to the fact that Dumbledore was young, and Professor Dippet was Headmaster, and that he was lying in the infirmary headed by Madame Bobbit rather than Madame Pomfrey. “Madame Bobbit, if we could just have the room.” Professor Dippet asked, not without a note of steel that as of yet had been absent in his ramblings. The matron pursed her lips, but obeyed either way. Dippet turned to Dumbledore.</p><p>“You said he fell from the sky? Mr. Potter, could you tell us how you came to be here? From...1996 was it?” Dippet conjured up two chairs. “Leave no detail out, young man. And don’t you dare lie.”</p><p>“I’m not actually sure how I got here, sir. I was sent to the store for my Aunt, and I noticed a man was following me. Something felt off, and out of nowhere he attacks me. I managed to get away and ran, firing off spells, hoping the ministry would show up, but they were too late. He grabbed me before my friend Remus could help. I just remember orange light surrounding the man and me. And then I woke up here in...whatever year it is now.” Harry had said all of this without taking a breath, feeling both like Hermione and very slightly light headed. He reached up to touch his tender forehead, his thumb brushing the empty bridge of his nose.</p><p>“My glasses!” Harry had had those things since he was 7 years old, never once had he given up on them, and now he had lost them and he would be blind in whatever bloody year it was.</p><p>“Oh, yes.” Professor Dumbledore piped in, “I had nearly forgotten.” He reached into his robes and pulled out exactly half of Harry’s eyeglass frames. “It’s July 17, 1943, by the way.” He finished as Harry stared down at his glasses.</p><p>“I had noticed you were dressed rather oddly, though I thought perhaps it might be cultural wear of some type.” Professor Dippet added. Dumbledore closed his eyes, and took a single breath in, while Harry’s eyebrows shot to his hairline. “In any case, I imagine this all must be rather disconcerting all around. I’ll have to research this orange lightning. I’ll likely not contact the ministry as of yet,” He continued whilst standing and banishing his chair. “They’re rather tetchy at the mo’. This whole Grindelwald business, and that awful muggle war.” Dippet was murmuring to himself more than anyone at this point, closing the door behind himself with a snap. Then it was silent, the air thick with awkwardness.</p><p>“Armando is a lovely man, Mr. Potter, but sometimes he speaks before he thinks. Ravenclaw brain, with none of the follow through.” Dumbledore sighed.</p><p>“Sure, sir.” Harry paused, unsure as to what to ask first. There were so many questions. Did Dumbledore know anything more? Had he identified the spell on his own yet? “What were you doing with my glasses?” Was the only thing that came out. ‘Great,’ Harry thought, “Now I look like an absentminded half wit.’ Dumbledore chuckled.</p><p>“Well Harry, may I call you Harry?” Harry nodded. “You had visible wisps of magic coming off you and your clothes like steam before it dissipated. Your glasses were the only things unaffected. Beyond only having half of the frame. I thought I might do some tests on them to see why.” He held up a hand before Harry could ask anything. “I found nothing. Not a trace of magic.”</p><p>“Sir, could <em>you</em> not send me back home?” Harry inquired, half pleading. “You’re the greatest sorcerer I’ve ever met.” Dumbledore furrowed his eyebrows.</p><p>“I take it we’re close in your time for you to place such faith in me.”</p><p>“Yes, you’re my headmaster, and you defeated-” Once more Dumbledore held up a hand.</p><p>“Forgive me Harry, but I must ask you not to tell me of my future accomplishments.” He continued over Harry’s protests, “I find myself more than tempted to ask, but anything you say may throw me off course, changing the very history around us.”</p><p>“But, sir! I’m here now. Wouldn’t that throw history off course anyway? You certainly never mentioned meeting me in 1943.” Harry’s well of patience had ran out, and the shock wore off. He was spitting angry. “I’ve been dropped here by some bloody Death Eater no doubt. Hoping I’d die or be converted or some nonsense.”</p><p>“Death Eater?” Dumbledore cut in. “What do you mean Death Eater?”</p><p>“They follow Lord Voldemort. There’s a war on in my time and-”</p><p>“What still?”</p><p>“No,” Harry said darkly, “A new war. Like I said, they follow a Dark Lord named Voldemort and-”</p><p>“You’re a soldier! You’re not yet 16, you cannot possibly be fighting in a war, future me allows you to-”</p><p>“Well you see, I have no choice. I-”</p><p>“You’ve been drafted? What on Earth am I up to in your time? I hope I haven’t drafted the entirety of the student body. What could you possibly do against-”</p><p>“No you don’t understand. There’s a prophecy, Voldemort killed my parents over it, it says I have to fight him, and-”</p><p>“A load of tosh,” Dumbledore interrupted strongly. “Prophecies? Dark Lords? You’re fifteen years old, and an orphan to boot. I don’t see how you could win an entire war.” Harry was both shocked and offended. The younger Dumbledore was visibly angry, and saying things so at odds with his future self it made Harry's head spin. “I’ve seen what fate drives men to do, Mr. Potter, I’ve seen what men will do for their supposed destiny.” Piercing blue bore into emerald as Dumbledore spoke. “The horrors of war are never brought on by the apathetic, and no one crosses into the dark so happily as a man who believes he is guided by the universe. I would've hoped I remembered that, no matter who I become, or what predictions I hear.”</p><p>Harry had no idea what to say back. Who knew the Professor could be so morose, so downtrodden. They sat there quietly for a few moments, both lost in their own thoughts.</p><p>“Professor?” Harry called gently. Dumbledore came back to himself. “Sorry, but. You never answered my question. Can you send me back?” Dumbledore sighed once more, adjusting himself in his chair.</p><p>“What do you know of time travel?” He asked.</p><p>“Not much.” Harry admitted. “I mean, when I was a third year my friend Hermione and me used a time turner to go back and save my godfather from a Dementor’s Kiss and saved a Hippogriff from execution.” Dumbledore’s eyes lit up with surprise and interest, even as he asked his next question.</p><p>“And when you used this...time turner…to go back, did you find yourselves causing some of the events you experienced previously?”</p><p>“Yes, exactly! Why? What does it mean?” Harry queried eagerly. Maybe Dumbledore could get him back to his time.</p><p>“The popular theory at the moment, is that time is a single stream. One could theoretically go back and divert the stream for a bit, but it always returns to it’s original form, and those diverting events are a springboard for the original timeline.”</p><p>“Theoretically?” Harry asked weakly. “You mean, you mean no ones sure? That this is all-”</p><p>“Hypothetical? Yes. We’ve not yet advanced beyond theory. Which means…well…”</p><p>“I’m stuck here.” Harry said flatly, in spite of the tumultuous riot that was going on in his head. Dumbledore pat his hand in an attempt to be consoling.</p><p>“I’ll talk to Armando about accommodations for you dear boy.”</p><p>Harry threw his head back against the headboard.</p>
