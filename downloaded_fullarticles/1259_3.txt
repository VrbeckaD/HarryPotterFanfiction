</p><p>
  <u>Sirius POV</u>
</p><p>I guess that I am dead now, it didn’t hurt as much as I thought that it was going to.</p><p>“Sirius!”</p><p>Was that Harry, I guess I can still hear him I hope that Moony stops him from doing anything.</p><p>“Sirius!”</p><p>Am I ready to die yet?</p><p>“Sirius please come back.”</p><p>No, I don’t think that I am ready.</p><p>Let me go, let me go, I said let me go!</p><p>
  <u>Nobody’s POV</u>
</p><p>A woman was walking back to her house when she saw a boy no more than four laying in a snow bank. He had short wavy black hair and was wearing a robe that was too big for his small frame.</p><p>“What are you doing out here?” She asked the boy picking him up.</p><p>He opened his eyes and she saw that they were a deep silver blue, but then just as quick, he shut them. His face was red and he seemed to have a fever that was climbing higher and higher.</p><p>“Oh no, I need to get you back to my house.” Then she took off as quick as she could without slipping on the ice that littered the path.</p><p>She came to a small house located in a square within view of a magnificent castle, “Charles, Charles where are you?”</p><p>A man in his early thirties peeked around the door frame he had short brown hair and brown eyes, “I am right here dear, what is wrong?” Then he saw the small child sweating and breathing heavily in his wife’s arms, “My word who is that?”</p><p>“I don’t know but what I can tell you is that he is sick, and we need to help him. I need you to go get me a Pepper-up potion, a fever draught, some snow, and a pot of water.” After saying all that the woman cleared the kitchen table and laid Sirius down on it. When she just saw her husband standing there not doing anything she glared at him and he went running to go get what he was told to.</p><p>When the woman looked back down she saw the child slowly open his eyes, she smiled kindly at him, “don’t worry dear we will fix you right up, can you tell me your name?”</p><p>Just then Charles walked in slowly hearing his wife.</p><p><strong>‘I don’t know, can’t remember, who are you?’</strong> Sirius asked not noticing that he wasn’t speaking English.</p><p>The women to her regard didn’t even spare a minute when she regarded in turn, <strong>‘my name is Ophelia dear, and the man in the doorway is my husband Charles. Can you not remember anything dear?’</strong></p><p>
  <strong>‘I remember that someone needed me, and the word Moony. I am so sleepy, is it alright if I rest?’</strong>
</p><p>The woman just smiled at him and brushed the hair out of his face <strong>‘Of course you can dear.’</strong></p><p>Then Sirius closed his eyes and fell asleep, Charles walked over and seeing the small smile on her face knowing that she had decided to take care of him. So smiling he walked over and picked the small boy up and carried him into the extra room.</p><p>“You know that if you want to take care of him that you have to come up with a name,” Charles said pulling the blankets up to fight off the small bite of cold.</p><p>“How did you know that I was going to say that I wanted to take care of him?” Ophelia asked surprised, as he turned around.</p><p>Then walking out of the room he turned to her and smiled, “you have that look like it wouldn’t matter what I said you would do it anyway.”</p><p>Kissing her husband softly she said, “you really do know me well, my love.”</p><p>“Of course I do.” He said puffing his chest out importantly causing Ophelia to laugh, “So do you have an idea for a name?”</p><p>“Hmmm, I was thinking Salazar since that would be the easiest to say in parseltongue, Sal for short.” <br/>Charles sighed and shook his head, “your family and having overly complicated names.”</p><p>“Oh hush.” She said laughing at him until they hear whimpering. When they looked in they saw Sal thrashing in his sleep, seeing this Ophelia walked over petting his head and saying soothing words in parseltongue.</p><p>When he finally calmed down, she sighed and whispered to her husband, “I wonder what he went through that it traumatized him this much?”</p><p>Charles shook his head and kissed the top of hers, “I hope we don’t find out because I have the feeling if we do then it will be because he told us.”</p><p>She looked up at him shocked, “A vision?”</p><p>He shook his head again, “No from what I can tell his past is dark, his present cloudy, and his future unsure. But what I can tell you is that he will be important but I don’t know how.”</p><p>“Alright, then we have to do everything possible, to make sure that his future is brighter than his past and clearer than his future.”</p><p>With that resolute answer, Ophelia stood up headed to bed with her husband chuckling behind her. He knew that as soon as she decided something there was a very small chance of her changing her mind.</p><p>The next morning Sal woke up to the sun shining in his face, he was confused till he remembered the kind lady helping him. Then as if called she walked into the room, she had dark hair braided and pinned at the top of her head along with kind brown eyes.</p><p><strong>‘Good morning, how are you feeling?’ </strong> She asked setting down a tray with some porridge with honey on it.</p><p><strong>‘I am not as hot, but I still can’t remember who I am or where I came from.’ </strong> He said shaking his head as tears started to form.</p><p>Ophelia jumped up and hugged but then when she felt him stiffen she released enough to give him room to escape if he wanted to, but when he didn’t she smiled softly. <strong>‘Don’t worry about remembering if you don’t that is fine, but if you do that is also fine. Don’t push yourself to remember we are not going to send you away if you do, but we are also not going to send you away if you don’t. So don’t worry about any of that right now, alright Sal?’</strong></p><p>Sal leaned back away from the kind lady and asked, <strong>‘What did you call me?’</strong></p><p>
  <strong>‘Sal which is short for Salazar we figured that since you don’t know your name, and we don’t know your name, we would call you Salazar Slytherin which is mine and my husband Charles’ last name. Is that alright?’</strong>
</p><p>Sal just burrowed into the hug more, <strong>‘That sounds great.’</strong></p><p><strong>‘I am glad.’ </strong> Ophelia pulled him tighter against her and kissed the top of his head.</p><p>Charles was leaning against the doorway watching the exchange while smiling. He stood there for a few minutes before he heard the door to the shop open when he walked out his smile vanished.</p><p>“What are you doing here Theseus?” He growled at Ophelia’s brother.</p><p>He had greasy black hair that was long and pulled back leaving his monkeyish face on display. “I just came to see how my dear sister has been doing.” He said sneering at the thought.</p><p>“I am sure that you were because you care about her so much,” Charles said discretely reaching under the counter where he knew his wand would be along with nudging awake the black mamba that helped protect the store.</p><p>Along with the mamba, he woke up the coral snake that slipped into the back to warn Ophelia that her brother was there.</p><p>“Of course I care her child will be the heir to our dark magic,” Theseus said standing up straighter as if he was presenting an important award.</p><p>Charles scoffed, “As if Lia would ever allow her child to sink into the abyss that she herself fought tooth and nail to climb out of.”</p><p>Theseus leaned on the desk so that he was nose to nose with Charles, “That might not be her decision.”</p><p>“Yeah well it isn’t yours either, and if I find you near my Lia or one of ours, I will show you exactly why it is that I was considered so dangerous, am I clear?” Charles said whispering as Theseus watched a swirl of gold appear before it disappeared again.</p><p>Theseus looked like he was going to argue before he decided against it and stormed out of the store.</p><p>“Is he gone?” Ophelia called from the back.</p><p>“Yeah, he’s gone.” As he said that Lia came out of the back with the coral snake wrapped around her neck like a colorful necklace.</p><p>“What did he want this time?” She asked putting down the snake on top of Serene the black mamba who had slithered on top to curl up.</p><p>“He was threatening us by saying that if we had any children he would take them to teach them dark magic,” Charles said pulling put some herbs to make a potion to cure a cold along with one to help with rashes.</p><p>“I am sure you did not threaten him back?” She asked raising an eyebrow in his direction.</p><p>“Of course not, do you not know me at all?” He asked looking thoroughly offended.</p><p>“I asked because I know you.” She said looking at him again.</p><p>“Fair point, I might have threatened him a little.” He said looking sheepish.</p><p>Lia rolled her eyes, “of course you did.” Then she walked over to him and gave him a peck on the cheek, “good job honey.”</p><p>“Thank you, darling.” He said kissing her back, “speaking of kids how is Sal, did he like his name?”</p><p>Lia turned back to the pepper up potion she was making, “yes he did, and he is doing better I think by next week he should be all set and ready to get out of bed. Right now though he is sleeping since his body needs rest.”</p><p>He nodded his head, “That makes sense, how old do you expect he is?”</p><p>Lia looked thoughtful, for a moment before answering, “I suspect four, maybe five.”</p><p>Charles shook his head and sighed, “So young, it makes you wonder what kind of people it was that left him out in the weather like that.”</p><p>Charles felt arms wrap around his waist when he looked over Ophelia was standing there leaning against him.</p><p>“Are you sure that it is alright if we raise him?” She asked looking longingly at her husband.</p><p>“My love, of course, it is alright, how could you think it wouldn’t. I am sure that you will be an excellent mother, and of course, I will be there the entire time.” Charles said pulling his wife around to kiss her forehead.</p><p>“How do you always know the right things to say?” Lia asked chuckling.</p><p>“It is just part of my charm, of course.” He said haughtily.</p><p>Ophelia started laughing, then Charles joined in till they were laughing together.</p><p><strong>‘Excuse me?’</strong> A small voice called from the doorway.</p><p>When they turned there was Sal standing in the doorway.</p><p><strong>‘Hello dear, are you hungry? ’</strong>Ophelia asked walking over and bending to get on eye level.</p><p>Sal nodded slowly as he blushed softly, this lead to Lia chuckling softly at the cuteness.</p><p>This dynamic lasted through the rest of winter along with the early parts of spring. Charles who knew a handful, of words from Lia could understand a small amount of what Sal was saying. It was the middle of spring and Sal was sitting in the front of the shop practicing some reading and writing when the shop door opened and a boy about ten comes running in.</p><p>He had bright red hair and green eyes that were more of an apple green than an emerald green.</p><p>When the boy turned around and saw Sal a smile burst onto his face. “Hello, do you live here?”</p><p>Sal nodded since Lia had said that not many people understood the language he spoke.</p><p>“Ok, well do you mind if I hide here a little bit since I ran away from my sitter?” He asked propping himself up on a stool.</p><p>Sal shook his head no.</p><p>The smile got larger, then he looked confused, “do you not speak English?”</p><p>Sal shook his head no <strong>‘No I only speak parsel.’</strong></p><p>The boy's eye lit up, “That is so cool, what language is it?”</p><p>Sal looked down at the book on animals and flipped till he found a picture of a snake, then he pointed to it.</p><p>“Snakes, is it the language of snakes?”</p><p>Sal nodded slowly waiting to see what the reaction would be since he had a feeling that it might not be good.</p><p>“That is so cool, do you understand English?”</p><p>Sal nodded and put his fingers together a little.</p><p>“So a little, hey do you think you can teach me?” the boy asked excitedly.</p><p>Sal shrugged, then thought and nodded slowly.</p><p>“Ok so maybe but you think so. Ok so how about you teach me snake and I will teach you English?”</p><p>Sal thought about it and then nodded.<br/>“Great I am Godric Gryffindor and I am ten, nice to meet you.”</p><p>Sal pointed to the sign that said Slytherin, then carefully he wrote out Sal and the number four.</p><p>“So your name is Sal Slytherin and you are four right?”</p><p>Sal nodded again.</p><p>Godric thought for a second and said, “Well you are smart for four.”</p><p>Sal shrugged.</p><p>“So is Sal short for your name?”</p><p>Sal nodded again.</p><p>“Ok, then you can call me Ric.”</p><p>Sal smiled and nodded.</p><p>“Are your parents around usually at this time?”</p><p>Sal shook his head.</p><p>“Alright I will come normally at this time, but if I can’t or your parents are here, I will send a bird with a red and gold ribbon. Do you have a bird?”</p><p>Sal nodded since he learned that his parents keep birds to send medicine or messages.</p><p>“Alright, so you can send a green and silver ribbon since your families use them as ties.”</p><p>Sal nodded again and smiled.</p><p>“My Lord, my Lord where are you?” A soldier yelled outside.</p><p>“Oops, well I better go don’t want them finding me here. I will see you tomorrow and we can start.”</p><p>Sal nodded smiling at his new friend.</p><p>“Alright bye,” Ric said running out into the day.</p><p>Sal sat there smiling glad that he had made a new friend.</p><p>Then Serene slithered up from under the counter.</p><p>
  <strong>‘Are you going to tell your hatchers?’</strong>
</p><p><strong>‘Not yet I kind of want to surprise them.’ </strong>Sal said smiling at the idea of his parent’s expression when he could converse with them naturally.</p><p><strong>‘If you are sure hatchling, but do not be surprised if they are upset with you’ </strong>The snake pointed out gently.</p><p><strong>‘I won’t, do you think it is true that I am smarter than others my age? ’</strong>Asked remembering what Ric had said.</p><p><strong>‘How should I know, I do not really make it a habit of mine to interact with other hatchlings your age.’</strong>She shuddered at the thought of all the kids grabbing at her</p><p><strong>‘Okay but if you could make a guess?’</strong>Sal asked almost pouting.</p><p>Serene sighed before answering, <strong>“If I was to make a guess, then yes I do believe that you are smarter than other hatchlings your age.’</strong></p><p><strong>‘I wonder why that is?’</strong>Sal thought out loud.</p><p><strong>‘It would do well for you to not overthink it.’</strong>Serene said lying down in a spot of sunlight that had seeped through the window</p><p><strong>‘I guess you are right.’</strong>Sal admitted going back to the page in the book that he was working on before Godric had shown up.</p><p><strong>‘Of course, I am when am I ever wrong.’</strong>         Serene scoffed at the idea that she was wrong, which caused a small giggle and an eye roll at the sunbathing snake.</p><p>Over the course of a few months, Ric would find a way to ditch his guards and make his way to the Apothecary. They would then take turns teaching each other their language and after a year they could hold conversations in both languages easily. They even started writing letters to each other switching and mixing the languages making it hard for anyone else to read. Lia and Charles were impressed and a little suspicious about how fast he was learning but they brushed it off as him remembering what he already knew. Then when he called them Mom and Dad at Christmas they didn’t really care as long as he was alright.</p><p>A few months after that, Ric told Sal that he was not going to be able to come for a couple of weeks since his uncle was visiting and he knew he wasn’t going to be able to ditch him. The second week in Sal was sitting in the apothecary reading his book again when he looked up and saw a greasy haired man come walking in.</p><p>“May I ask who are you?” The man asked haughtily.</p><p>Sal pretended to ignore him, he didn’t like the feeling coming off of the man it was oily, cold, and dark. Instead, he poked Serena awake, she slithered out the back and into town while Theseus tried to get an answer out of Sal. She slithered fast trying to find either Ophelia or Charles, Just as she was going to give up to head back to the shop to protect Sal himself she spotted a familiar crop of bright red hair. Ric was with a woman with hair as bright as his and a man with golden blonde hair who had a sword strapped to his side.</p><p>Ric was the first one to spot the familiar deadly snake, “Serena what is she doing here?”</p><p>The woman looked up from the conversation she was having with a merchant, “what is it dear?” Then she noticed the large snake heading their way. “Oh my, that is a very large snake.”</p><p>“And very deadly if I remember correctly.” The man said raising an eyebrow at the snake that was fast approaching.”</p><p>“Yes, but not if she likes you, actually she is very lazy and rarely leaves the shop, so what is she doing here.” Ric contemplated as she came up to him.</p><p><strong>‘Ric I am so glad I found someone, Sal he needs help, and Ophelia and Charles won’t be back till tonight.’  </strong>Serena said worriedly.</p><p>“What do you mean Sal needs help?” Ric asked now worried also.</p><p>“Honey, do you understand what she is saying?” The woman said surprised.</p><p>“Yes, but I do not have time to explain how right now, my friend is in trouble,” Ric said starting to panic.</p><p>The man looked at the woman quickly and nodded, “Alright let's go help your friend.”</p><p>Ric smiled, “Thank you mother, Serena you lead.”</p><p>The man and the woman looked shocked as the snake seemed to nod, but they did not have time to contemplate it as Ric took off running. It was only a few minutes until they came upon an Apothecary with a dark green door and silver writing saying Slytherin’s Apothecary.</p><p>Ric took a breath and calmed himself and walked into the shop when the man and his mom walked in they saw a young boy with dark black hair and bright blue-grey eyes being interrogated by a greasy haired man.</p><p>Ric looked over the situation then put on his best-worried face, which wasn’t hard due to the situation, “Jared there you are we have been looking all over for you, we told you to wait in the square. I am so sorry sir I hope he wasn’t bothering you.” He said innocently.</p><p>The man sneered, “And who are you?”</p><p>“Oh I’m sorry Godric Gryffindor prince of this town and this is my mother Queen Clarissa and my uncle Lord Oliver.” He said pointing to each person, in turn, a mischevious glint in his eye.</p><p>Theseus paled at the names that he had heard then stiffly he bowed, “my apologies my Queen my Lord I had no idea.”</p><p>Clarissa stood up straight bringing her regal air up, “then maybe next time you should check before going off on someone.”</p><p>Theseus bowed stiffly again, “I sincerely apologize again my Queen, my Lord, my Prince.”</p><p>Then he walked out of the apothecary, they waited a few moments to make sure he was gone before Ric turned towards Sal. “Are you alright he didn’t touch you did he?”</p><p>“No, I’m fine you got here before he could really do anything,” Sal said giving Ric a hug he subtly looked over Ric’s shoulder at the Queen and Lord standing in the doorway. <strong>‘So is that your mom and Uncle?’</strong></p><p><strong>‘Of course, they are what did you think I grabbed a couple of random strangers off the street? So do you want me to introduce you to them or not?’ </strong>Godric said putting his hands on his hips and nodding towards his mother and uncle.</p><p><strong>‘I guess there really isn’t any other choice since now they know what you have been doing.’ </strong>Salazar sighed</p><p><strong>‘Well not really, I kind of rushed over here when Serena found us.’ </strong>Godric said sheepishly, rubbing his neck.</p><p><strong>‘Godric you idiot.’ </strong>Sal glared at his friend.</p><p>
  <strong>‘Yes, Salazar you twat.’</strong>
</p><p><strong>‘I have an idea how about you pay attention to the two people standing in the shop looking very confused.’ </strong>Serena said breaking them out of their playful insult battle. that was going to happen.</p><p><strong>‘Oops, sorry.’ </strong> They both apologized</p><p>“Anyways’ Uncle, Mother this is Salazar Slytherin my friend slash brother slash teacher,” Godric said giving Sal a hug from behind.</p><p>“Hello, you can call me Sal, everyone does,” Sal said blushing slightly.</p><p>Clarissa bent down and looked Sal’s blue-gray eyes, “Hello Sal I am Queen Clarissa but you can call me Issa if you want.”</p><p>Then his Uncle knelt down, “You can call me Oliver no title needed.”</p><p>“Alright, Sal do you want us to wait with you until your parents get back, in case that man comes back?” Oliver asked.</p><p>Sal looked up at Ric silently asking if that was alright, Ric smiled and nodded at the younger boy.</p><p>“Yes please.” He said smiling shyly.</p><p>Clarissa and Oliver smiled and nodded.</p><p>“So what do you like to do?” Clarissa asked the smaller boy.</p><p>Sal smiled and went to pull his book on animals out from behind the counter.</p><p>Oliver picked the book up and looked at the cover, “so do you like animals?”</p><p>Sal nodded, “Yep I like them a lot, there are a lot of interesting animals that don’t live around here.”</p><p>“You’re right there are, and some of them are really big,” Oliver said.</p><p>Sal’s eyes lit up, “You’ve seen them?”</p><p>Oliver looked at Clarissa who smiled at him, “Yes I have I travel all over, would you like to hear some of my stories?”</p><p>Both boys nodded at that, so Oliver did. He told them stories about faraway places and interesting people till both boys fell asleep.</p>
