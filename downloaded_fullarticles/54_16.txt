          <div class="userstuff"><p>Alice wraps Lily's ankle while Lily, humming, daubs at the slash down Edgar's arm. Half an arm's length away, Remus fumbles at the stove to heat cocoa, while James and Frank wrestle with a wood fairy protecting the kindling. Lily can't hide her smile.</p>
<p>They should not be so happy. <i>She</i> should not feel quite so giddy. After all, they're half an hour from fighting Death Eaters. Tomorrow, they'll fight more.</p>
<p>Lily strokes Alice's silky hair and offers her hand.</p>
<p>Alice's startled grin makes Lily laugh. She calls out the <i>resonƒÅre</i> incantation; the radio gets louder. Soon enough, they're dancing.</p></div>
