    <p>Prologue</p><p>How the Aurors on duty could have missed the baby he was holding was beyond him. Seriously, if this was the state of the wizards charged with keeping the peace and fighting Dark wizards, Sirius was beginning to understand the Ministry's failures during the war. Throwing him in Azkaban without a trial was one thing but throwing Harry in with him was just pure incompetence. And of course, his status as a mad murderer made it impossible for him to explain the situation, the few times he bothered trying, without someone laughing in his face.</p><p> </p><p>He really should have given Harry to Hagrid when he’d had the chance, for surely anything would have been better than a cold, humid cell in Azkaban, surrounded by Dementors and criminals. Half the people in this prison wanted to kill him for Merlin’s sake! How was he ever going to raise Harry properly in an environment as unforgiving as this?</p><p>He was pulled from his thoughts by a small whimper coming from Harry. Immediately, he scrambled to get to the child and pull him into his arms. “It’s alright, it’s alright”, he whispered, holding the boy close and peppering small kisses on top of his head. It seemed to do the trick and, after a few minutes of Sirius rocking Harry gently, the boy went back to sleep.</p><p> </p><p>Sirius sat back against the cell’s wall and looked up at the ceiling. “Lily, James, I’m so sorry”, he choked out on the sobs that were starting to escape him. He had failed them both and now he was all alone, left to care for a baby without his best friends’ guidance. The only one left was Remus and he hadn’t seen him in months, didn’t dare hope he would ever see him again. That was fine (it wasn’t), it just meant he could focus all his attention on Harry. He had to pull himself together, stop crying or dwelling in the past. He had responsibilities now. Sirius may have to raise Harry in Azkaban, but the kid would get all the love in the world and Sirius would everything in his (granted, extremely limited) power to provide all that a child needed to grow up.</p><p> </p><p>But first, they had to survive a meeting with Bellatrix.</p><p>She had arrived a few hours prior, had been thrown in the cell across from Sirius’. Fortunately, she was stunned, but it was only a matter of time before she woke and noticed both him and Harry (the kid wasn’t discreet when he was awake). His luck must really be rotten because, as soon as he said her name in his mind, he saw her body, clad in those awful prisoner clothes and lying on the hard ground, twitch before a groan fell from his cousin’s lips. She pushed herself to her knees, seemingly in pain but was soon attempting to stand up, grasping the prison bars for support. She raised her head then, and met his eyes, hers widening for a fraction of a second before she started cackling madly. “Oh, the irony”, she said, tone condescending, “Little Sirius, thrown in jail by his precious Light friends”. She smirked at him. “Proud of yourself <em>cousin</em>?”</p><p> </p><p>He wanted to lunge at her, slap her for what she’d said but he used the tiny bit of self-restraint and common sense, because obviously there were two sets of bars separating them, he had left and merely snarled at her. He wanted to bite back with a snarky remark, bitter words already at the tip of her tongue but he was interrupted by the shifting of the bundle of flesh in his arms. Harry opened his eyes and, upon seeing him, began to babble in that baby’s language that no adult could ever pretend to understand. Apparently, Bellatrix had noticed Harry because her whole body seemed to have shifted to face the baby and she proceeded to look at him fondly, a fleeting look of adoration passing on her features, before she noticed the tell-tale scar on his forehead and let out an animalistic growl. “What is <em>he</em> doing here?” she asked, gritting her teeth noisily. Sirius scoffed before looking back up at her. “Like it’s any of your business to know” “He killed my Lord of course I have the right to know,” she bit back. “Besides I heard he’d disappeared before they could get him to safety”, she said, softer.</p><p>“He didn’t technically disappear. Just… nobody looked for him in the right places. He’s been with me all this time. Damn Aurors didn’t even check what I had on me before throwing in this bloody cell. No wonder we almost lost really…” Briefly, Sirius wondered why he was even telling her that before remembering that he was never good at keeping secrets, especially when talking to his cousins. “I’ve been giving him half my rations. Merlin knows the kid needs it more than I do, and he’s been sleeping on my extra outfit. It’s not ideal but it works, I do my best.” As he rambled on, Sirius saw Bellatrix’s face soften, something akin to compassion appearing. “Poor child,” she said, “you were destined for Greatness yet are forced to achieve it in the deepest pits of hell.” She was lost in her thoughts for a few seconds, a faraway look on her face, before she straightened up and said, with a determined look on her face and a tone that left no place for arguments “Doesn’t matter anymore now that I’m here. They’ll see. They’ll learn. Even by throwing us Azkaban they won’t be able to destroy our faith. And that little man,” she pointed at Harry, “he’s going to show them all the truth about us. We’re going to teach him and he’s going to be great.”</p><p> </p><p>‘Oh Merlin’ Sirius thought, ‘I’m screwed’</p>
