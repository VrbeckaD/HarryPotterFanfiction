</center><p>Harry just celebrated his sixteenth birthday in the privacy of his bedroom, under the threadbare covers the Dursleys gave him for Christmas the year before.  They were intended as an insult, but Harry was just grateful for covers, so he let them have their laughs, while acting up some of the sadness they’d like to see – so they would not be taken away – and brought them up to his room.</p><p>He didn’t care what they thought, or what they thought about him.</p><p>“Happy Birthday, Harry,” Harry said.  He closed his eyes and made a wish.</p><p>After Harry metaphorically ‘blew out the candle’, he opened his eyes to see Snape had snatched the covers off him, and loomed above him, furious.  “Unacceptable.  <em>Unacceptable!</em>”</p><p>“What have I done now?”   <em>Cunting old, bat.</em></p><p>“Not you.  Merlin Potter.  This is… what are these?”  Snape said still holding the ratty old blankets.</p><p>“Those are mine,” Harry said snatching them back.  “Don’t judge me – what are you doing here, Snape?  Um, <em>Professor</em> Snape.”</p><p>Snape was looking down his long nose at Harry in a peculiar way.  If Harry didn’t know any better, he’d say all the usual disdain was gone, still he looked angry.  “Gather up your things, we’re leaving.”</p><p>“What?  But the blood wards, sir.”  As much as Harry didn’t want to go anywhere with Snape, he would rather dice flobberworms for him all summer than stay with the Dursleys another second.  Unfortunately, there was the whole staying safe from Voldemort thing to worry about.</p><p>Snape sighed looking exhausted.  “There is another option.  C’mon.  Grab your things Harry, we’re going.”</p><p>“Wait a minute, you’re not Snape,” Harry said, grabbing out his wand.  His real one.  The one the Dursleys thought they had was just a gnarled old stick.  “Snape would never call me, Harry.”</p><p>“<em>Expelliarmus!</em>” Snape said, catching Harry’s wand.  “We don’t have time for this nonsense, Potter.  Where are your things?”</p><p>“I don’t have things.  Just my trunk,” Harry said pointing.</p><p>Snape shrunk his trunk, and put it in his pocket.  “Take my arm, Potter.”</p><p>“What’s going on?  You haven’t told me anythin—”  Harry didn’t get to finish, Snape grabbed his arm, and apparated them away.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>~**~</p>
</center><p>“I’m sorry, sir.  Could you say that one more time?” There’s no way Harry just heard what he thought he heard.  Snape had apparated them outside the castle, and Harry had to follow him across the castle grounds, barely able to keep up with the pace his long legs were travelling.</p><p>He was deposited in front of Dumbledore.  “You have one chance to set this right, Headmaster, or you’ll never see either of us again,” Snape had said, and who the blazes knew what he meant by that? Then, Snape whirled himself and all his layers of black robes away.  Dumbledore began to stumble out a story.  It was the first time Harry saw the man, anxious.</p><p>“Severus Snape is your father Harry, and he’s taking you back from your relatives.  The blood wards work for him too.  As I understand it, your mother was able to weave him into the spell as well.  Very talented witch your mother was.”</p><p>Harry was shocked to death, and barely knew what to say.  None of this could be true, Dumbledore was having him on.  “But sir, he hates me,” Harry argued</p><p>Dumbledore sighed long, and exhausted.  “No, he doesn’t hate you my boy.  Just the opposite, and a lot of good acting.”</p><p>Harry crossed his arms, because c’mon really, Harry’s just supposed to let it go at that?</p><p>“Severus loved your mother dearly, but well, it’s my fault really. I guilted him into spying for the Order.  Yes, you heard right.  He’s been a spy all this time.  A double agent, working for Voldemort, and me at the same time.”</p><p>The spy part he believed, that made a lot of sense actually.  “You <em>guilted</em> Severus Snape into spying for the Order?” Harry was sure no one could guilt Snape into anything.</p><p>Dumbledore smiled.  “I tried, anyway.  The only sense he saw in my plan was that it was the best possibility at the time for keeping you safe, and that’s the real reason he agreed.  He’s fretted about you for all of the time you’ve been alive, and largely disagrees with my care of you.”</p><p>Harry had to agree with Snape there.  At sixteen, he enjoyed the benefits of getting to do what he liked, but having seen what real parents, like Ron Weasley’s, did for their children, Harry knew kids were meant to have structure and rules.  They’re to the benefit of the child.  <em>You feel more loved, rather than less.</em>  “Then why is he so awful to me?  I don’t get it.  Don’t tell me all of it’s an act.  Some of it’s far too real.”</p><p>Dumbledore twisted his lips.  “Can’t get anything past you, can I?  So like your father, you are.”</p><p>“<em>Dumbledore.</em>”</p><p>“Right, sorry.  Your father is a stern man, and perhaps a little too strict at times.  Your behavior <em>does</em> get on his nerves, that much is real, but his disdain for you is all fabricated, one hundred percent.”</p><p>Harry huffed, not wanting to believe any of it, yet it would be nice to have a family and that bit has him open to the idea.  His relatives were horrible to him.  Sure some changes were made over the years, he no longer lived in a cupboard, but things still weren’t great.  Does he really want his family to be Snape though?  Whether he did, or not, it looked like that was what was happening.  “Why now?”</p><p>Dumbledore got quiet. “He didn’t know what was going on with your other relatives, because I kept it from him. I had him believing you were an arrogant prick with a silver spoon in your mouth.  He’s furious, not even speaking to me.  He wants you removed immediately, and since only the blood of a relative can truly protect you, he’s it.  He’s quit spying immediately and has demanded things put to rights.”</p><p>Snape quit spying for Harry? No. There must be some other nefarious reason. “If he’s so furious, why’d he allow you to break the news?” Harry said, lifting his eyebrows.</p><p>Dumbledore nodded.  “For you, Harry.  He knows you trust me.”</p><p><em>Trusted</em> him, Harry’s not sure he can now. And Snape his biological father? His world was a bit turned upside down right now. There was a lot to process. “Well, you’ve broken the news. What now?”</p><p>“Did you want to see proof?”</p><p>Of course he did, but for some reason, he wanted it from Snape. There was nothing to say he would get it from Snape, his experiences with Snape told him this was all an elaborate scheme to finally pulverize Harry like the man seemed to want to, but something in his gut was speaking to him, a hunch.  Besides, if all of this was true, he wanted to hear it from Snape personally. “I think I’d rather like to have him show me.  Any other questions I have he can explain.”</p><p>“Very well. He’s asked that you meet him in his quarters.”</p><p>Brilliant.  Right through Slytherin territory.  It was summer, thankfully – no Slytherins to deal with, but there was always Peeves. “Thank you, sir.  One more thing I would like to know from you – how long did you know?”  About his relatives he meant.</p><p>“Regrettably, the whole time.  Harry, I’m sorry.  I know it’s no excuse, but there was a lot at stake.  We needed your father, and we knew there was no way he would continue if he knew.  You were the lamb; I know the lamb never likes being the lamb.”</p><p>Harry wanted to argue that he was a child, and shout other such injustices at him, but that’s really the cut and dry, and there would be no point.  Dumbledore knew, and he did it anyway.  Harry nodded.  “If you’ll excuse me, Headmaster.”</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>~**~</p>
</center><p>In the years that followed, he would forgive the headmaster, because Harry believed in forgiveness and compassion for himself, and you could only have that for yourself by letting go of the actions of others that affected you, for reasons you may never truly understand.</p><p>But they were never close again.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>~**~</p>
</center><p>Harry managed to make it to Snape’s, door with all of his limbs, but unfortunately his skin was blue from whatever the hell Peeves dropped on him.  He was not so much worried about blue skin, as he was about heading inside, and having it out with Severus Snape, his <em>father.</em></p><p>Truth be told, Harry had always felt a burning desire to impress the man, Harry never understood, until now. Even some of his disobedience was often to get Snape’s attention.  Professor Snape was the only adult who even tried to provide structure for him, subconsciously Harry appreciated it, and wanted it.</p><p>Knowing Snape was his father was going to make the need for his attention so much worse, Harry just knew. That sounded like enormous pressure.  Maybe it was better to start the bar low, he could head straight back to Dumbledore, and see if he would let him into Gryffindor tower.   He could go to bed, and ignore everything he’d heard tonight.  The professor might try to chase after him, but Harry was good at thwarting Snape, if he did say so himself.  This way the professor wouldn’t expect too much.  <em>Good idea, Harry.</em></p><p>Right then, he’d turn around, and head straight back to Dumbledore.  He would then need to write to Hermione, so she could remind him of the incantation to get rid of the blue.  As he’s mid-turning-heel, the door to Snape’s quarters opened, and looming above him for the second time that night, was the dark Potions Master, supposedly the one who helped give him life.</p><p>Snape grabbed his collar, and dragged him inside, shutting the door tightly.  “You’re blue, Potter.  Why in Merlin’s name are you blue?” he said stalking off like a whirlwind, and to his cupboards looking for something.</p><p>“Your lousy Slytherin poltergeist did this to me.  It’s a wonder I’m in one piece.  You couldn’t have met me in Dumbledore’s office?”  Harry glared at his father, crossing his arms. They hadn’t talked about a thing yet, but the feeling in the air was different. Already, something had changed between them. Subconsciously, Harry had already begun the testing process, as children are prone to do, even when they hadn’t grown up away from their parents. Harry liked the immediate and easy comfort he felt.</p><p>“Merlin, spare me,” he said returning his robes floating behind him. “Peeves does not belong to any house; we don’t actually know where he comes from.  Drink this.”</p><p>Harry accepted the flask taking a whiff.  “That’s vile.”</p><p>“I said drink it, not smell it.”</p><p>“How do I know this hasn’t been poisoned?” Harry didn’t really think it had been. He just felt he should ask. Not only did Snape feel different, he was acting different too. He seemed relaxed, which felt odd to say about the cantankerous Potions Master.</p><p>Snape smiled like he was amused with him.  “You don’t, but if you fancy looking like a, what do muggles call them?  Right, Smurfs.  If you fancy looking like a Smurf, far be it from me to stop you.”</p><p>Snape knew what a smurf was…? Wait, not important right now. He was distracted from the real issue - Snape was his father! And another thing, maybe he didn’t need, bliming, bleeding, bloody Snape. He shoved the flask back.  “I’ll get Hermione to tell me the incantation, thank you very much.  Worked the last time.”</p><p>“Of course there was a ‘last time.’” Snape shoved it back.  “I’m sure it did, but this time, the incantation won’t work.  This is the handiwork of your Weasley twins.  They always get in here sometime before start of term, and load Peeves up with their latest inventions.  This is a new formula – Argus’s cat had an unfortunate run in with a blue balloon bomb last week.  You need the potion.”</p><p>Harry had half a mind to stay blue, and to try his luck with Hermione, but if Snape was telling the truth, he’d have to come crawling back to him for the potion, and that would be worse than downing the vile thing now, and take his chances.  Ugh, fine.  Harry chugged it back, making retching sounds afterward.  “<em>Disgusting.</em>  Can’t you make them taste like cherries, or something else nice?”  He looked at his hand flipping it over and over.  “Why’s it not working?”</p><p>“Give it a moment, Potter.  It’s a potion, it will take a bit of time to get into your system.  While we wait, have a seat.”</p><p>Harry noticed there was tea and biscuits waiting by the fire.  Right.  Snape had been expecting him.  Huh, so homey and nice.  Or was Snape just trying to lull him into a false sense of security? Harry sat down, but his nerves were a bit frayed, and he was on his guard.  “Do we really have to talk about anything?  Couldn’t we just enjoy this nice tea together?”  Harry wasn’t good at talking, and it was freaking weird having Snape look at him like… well like, maybe he did actually care about Harry.</p><p>Harry knew Snape’s ire well and right now wasn’t it, instead he looked more like a concerned Darth Vader.</p><p>Snape sat down across from Harry and poured them both tea.  “We need to talk, whether we like it or not. It will be uncomfortable, it could get heated, but we need to talk, Harry.”</p><p>Harry’s not sure he’ll ever get used to the man calling him by his first name. It startled him, but only for a second, because really, it was kinda nice, and relaxed him some. Can he live in this world, even just for a minute where he was getting the father he dreamed about when he was cold in his lonely cupboard?  Harry didn’t care who his father was, as long as the man would be <em>his</em> father.</p><p>Snape as a father was likely to be a nightmare. He’d be so strict for starters. Ugh, was he going to have to learn every potion there ever was? No. <em>No!</em> He wouldn’t do it.</p><p>Then Harry remembered, Snape was a Slytherin and if he truly was a spy for Voldemort, he’d be good at elaborate tricks. What if Snape locked him in a worse cupboard? That’s it, that’s what he’s doing. Taking back his parental rights just so he can inflict the abuse he’s always wanted to!</p><p>“Calm down, Potter. I’m not going to do whatever it is you’re winding yourself up about.”</p><p>Harry glared. “It’s not like I don’t have good reason to get wound up.”</p><p>Snape seemed genuinely regretful. “You have every reason. We have much to discuss and I don’t presume we will repair sixteen years’ worth of wounds in one night.  Not to mention, you have a bedtime, which we’ll need to respect.”</p><p>“Bedtime?  I don’t have a… oh.”  Harry got it.  Snape was giving him a bedtime.</p><p>“Ten o’clock on school nights, eleven on the weekends, and midnight when you win at Quidditch,” he explained with sly eyes.  “For the rest of the summer, you may stay up until eleven.”</p><p>“Why later when we win?”</p><p>“Don’t you want to be able to attend the victory party as long as possible?”</p><p>True, but Harry didn’t think Snape would care about something like that.  <em>Why would he care about something like that?</em> Harry, nodded.</p><p>“I’m electing not to wait until we sort through what we need to, to begin parenting you. My parental rights have been restored, and you need structure yesterday. I will make rules for you, and you will follow them whether you like me, or not. And I would obey me if I were you.  I’ll be able to tell if you’re getting sleep, or not, and the last thing a child wants is his father coming to check on him in front of his peers.  If I have to speak with you about it too many times, there will be punishment.”</p><p>That took Harry’s breath away.  He thought he should be arguing, perhaps telling Snape to stuff his bedtime nonsense, all his rule nonsense for that matter, but he did none of that.  It was nice to have someone care. If anything, Snape seemed to pinpoint the most effective way to make Harry feel safe, and looked after. “Yes, sir.”</p><p>Snape sipped his tea, and Harry did the same staring at him, with more than a little awe. A sense of brightness washed over him, and though he had no reason to let go of his suspicions, the little orphaned boy inside of him who wanted this to be true and work out so badly spoke up. “A-Are you really my father?”</p><p>“I am, and I plan to prove it to you.  If you are anything like me, and I have observed that you are, innately you’ll be suspicious, and require a substantial amount of proof.  I have access to your birth certificate, and there are potions for proving paternity.  You will require both.”  Snape doesn’t say why. “I will provide any other proof you need. You may even view my memories should you wish.”</p><p>Harry did want to see the proof, but that Snape would go through this much fanfare with such confidence, Harry had the sneaking suspicion what the proof would tell him.  “You were so awful to me though,” Harry said, and can’t help the wobble in his voice.</p><p>“I know.  I am regretful.  Rest assured, I will make it up to you, and we will see the family therapist about it,” Snape said.  “Both separately, and together.”</p><p>“Family therapist?” Snape was willing to do therapy with him? That alone was more than any adult had done for him. Maybe… maybe there was hope.</p><p>“You’ll meet her this week, and we will have weekly sessions together.  Her family has counselled the Prince family for generations.  We’ll choose another day for you to go on your own as well, and for me.”</p><p>“Prince?  Aren’t we Snape?” Maybe Harry was jumping on the bandwagon a little quick here, but what did he have to lose? If this didn’t work out, he was no worse off. Well, unless Snape was going to feed him to Naghini, or something, but that was seemingly less likely all the time.</p><p>“Merlin, no.  Snape is an alias, used for my spying days, which are now over, effective immediately.”</p><p>Snape, wasn’t even Snape?  The world must be ending.  “Have you really quit spying?  For me?” The golden trio had mostly suspected Snape of working for Voldemort, not spying for Dumbledore if Harry was honest. To learn that not only was he a spy, but that he was giving up spying for Harry on the same night, Harry just couldn’t begin to comprehend it all.</p><p>“Indeed I have.  You need me, and that’s more important than the whole world.”</p><p>Harry barely knew what to say to that.  Was it possible he had a real parent, to care that much about him?  “What about snake face?”</p><p>“We will be limited as to where we can go, until the war is over, but I’m as safe as anyone else at Hogwarts, and anywhere really. You’re safest with me.  I have already got someone to be my replacement.  Things will work out.  Voldemort isn’t going to win this one, Harry.”</p><p>He was so confident, like a superhero.  Harry wanted to believe him, but he still had questions. “But your dark mark.”</p><p>Snape, Prince? Severus.  Harry settled on that for the time being.  Severus slid his robes up revealing his pale, bare arm.  “Gone.  Most magic can be undone.  As much as I wanted to protect you, and your mother, I wouldn’t have done so in a way that would never allow me to get back to you.  I made sure I knew how that thing could be removed.  As you can see, it worked.”</p><p>Harry’s kind of touched.  Severus has set them up for family therapy, and is rather sentimental about things.  He heard about Harry’s treatment by his mother’s relatives, and quit spying in a second to take him away from them, something not even Dumbledore had done.  He could have been living at Hogwarts this whole time.</p><p>In return, Harry was willing to work on forgiveness for Severus’s harsh treatment, so long as Severus didn’t do it anymore.  <em>Harry won’t tolerate it anymore.</em>  But sod it!  He wanted this.  Maybe he’s fucking crazy, but yeah, he truly wanted this.  Even if Severus was strict, and occasionally terrifying, Harry was getting the sense there was so much more to him that would balance him out.</p><p>“In light of all this, I must forbid you from participating in the war, any more than you have.”</p><p>“But the prophecy.”</p><p>Severus shook his head. “Most don’t understand the true nature of prophecy to begin with. Prophecy is only a <em>potential</em> future. It’s the destiny side of the coin with the other being free will. Free will is the contradiction to free will, and a contradiction, in reality cannot exist. In order for free will to thread itself into destiny, you must be able to change events. We change the future, by exiting. We make our own rules by refusing to obey the will of another.”</p><p>“So we just, exit the war?”</p><p>“We have done more than our fair share, son. It is time for others to step up, and they already have.”</p><p>“It feels wrong to abandon everyone though.”</p><p>“We aren’t. We’ve done all we can and because we’ve done so much, others want us to have this opportunity to live. Our families were torn apart, many murdered. It’s time for us to have some moments, in case they are numbered. We can exit the war, but there’s always possibility we won’t escape it. As your father, I want you to have this. I want you to understand you are more than a lamb for a cause. That your life is yours and yours alone; it’s not meant for others Harry.”</p><p>Harry barely knew what to say to that. There were a lot of concepts in what Severus had said to grasp. He had a feeling they would be dealing with them in therapy.</p><p>“Harry, my child, there is only so much the world can ask from you. It’s already taken a lot, I hope you can allow some of what was taken to be returned to you.”</p><p>That was some big stuff. Too big for tonight. But Harry did have a few more curious questions, he thought were easier to traverse for now.</p><p>“James Potter, why him?  I thought he bullied you, and that was why you hated him, and in turn me.”</p><p>“He did, and then apologized shortly after.  We became good mates.  Lily was better friends with him than I was at first, and he was a formidable wizard.”</p><p>Harry could sense a little more there too, that perhaps there was something deeper to Severus’s relationship with James, but first he needed to know.  “I was born before you left?”</p><p>“Yes.” Severus hardened.  “I’m sorry, Harry.  Thinking of that time still hurts.  I hope you can forgive a little hesitancy about it.  I hate thinking about all the years I lost with you, and about losing your mother along with James, and other good friends.”</p><p>“Would you rather talk about something else?” Harry found he was suddenly enjoying the conversation, and didn’t want it to end.</p><p>“I’ll be fine, Harry.  Ask what you need to.”</p><p>“Was there any more to … I mean was James… Did James, ugh.”  Harry didn’t know how to ask, and the relationship he had with James was really Severus’s business, but after having grown up idolizing a man you thought was your father, it was hard to just think he might be an actor set to play your father.</p><p>Severus smiled.  “Your mother, James and I were a family together in the end.  Prince family rules dictated I needed to take on a spouse suitable for the Prince family name.  I think your grandfather would have approved of either, if I had fallen in love with James first, it just happened to be Lily first.  James came in later, but the decision to have you was always the three of us.  He would have liked for you to consider him <em>Dad</em>.”</p><p>That was, well, perfect considering the circumstances.  <em>Huh, what would that have been like?  Having two dads, and a mum?</em></p><p>“Do you have other questions, Harry?”</p><p>“Loads, which we probably won’t get to all of them tonight, but I would like to know what this means going forward.”  Harry squirmed in his seat.  “Are we going to acknowledge our, um, relation?”</p><p>Severus nodded.  “Absolutely. I am going to be your father, in every way.  You need a proper family, and a proper parent.  No one looks after you, that’s going to change.”</p><p>The way Severus was looking at him said all kinds of stuff, and Harry knew he was probably going to get hit with a bunch of rules, but also a lot of love and care, and that was fine with him.  Still he had to ask.  “What if I don’t want it?” Harry said.  He’d always wanted a family, but family wasn’t a word he could trust.</p><p>“You don’t have much choice, I’m afraid.  I still have full parental rights, since my name is on your proper birth certificate.  Harry Potter is also an alias.  As you know, a wizard doesn’t reach majority until he’s twenty-five.  You’re stuck with me until then, Potter,” he explained, not sorry about it.</p><p>“Why do you keep calling me Potter then?” Harry said, annoyed.  If Harry was to be his son, why call him by his fake name?</p><p>“It’s what you’re used to.”</p><p>“You could call me Harry.”</p><p>“You assume Harry is your real name.”</p><p>“Isn’t it?”</p><p>Severus shook his head.   “Not exactly.  You’re Emersyn Severus James – Emersyn for your mother’s father, and Severus my name, as per wizarding tradition, since you are the Prince family heir.  James for your dad.  We thought Harry was a clever alias for you.  Emersyn is on the tree of relations to the name Harry.  Distantly, but if you follow the German version of the name Harry, Heim, it leads to Emersyn.”  Severus smiled clearly proud about their cunning.</p><p>“Am I no longer Harry Potter?”  Because Harry was kinda freaking out.  It was one thing to find out your professor was actually your biological father and maybe have to change your last name, but to not be Harry Potter at all? that was losing a whole identity.</p><p>“I think you’ll always be Harry Potter, just as I will always be Severus Snape.  We can decide what we’d like to do with that much of it.  However, our roles to each other will change.  You’ll be my son, Harry and I will be your father.  It’s best you refer to me as such.”</p><p>Of all of it, that’s the part Harry minded the least, looked forward to even.  Harry wanted a real parent.  It was his greatest wish as a little boy.  Regardless of any other apprehensions he might have, Harry was most afraid of finally getting a Father only to be denied everything that went with that.  Declaring him as Father was a stamp of ownership, and he wanted that no matter what their past had been.</p><p>“Prince men and women are fairly territorial,” Severus went on to explain.  “Now that I can, I’m letting the world know you’re my son.  I’m grateful to James for what he did, allowing you to use his name, and influence, but you’re also mine, and people will know.”</p><p>Harry nodded, feeling glad.  “F-Father is your preference, sir?”</p><p>“It is.   Princes are fairly formal, as you will soon learn.  But I don’t mind Papa for less formal times.  I’m just not really the <em>Dad</em> sort, like Arthur Weasley.  I rather think James would have been the <em>Dad</em> type,” Severus mused.</p><p>Harry sipped more of his tea thinking about everything his father had to say.  “So I could still refer to him as, Dad then?”</p><p>“Of course, Harry.  He most certainly was your dad, that hasn’t changed.  Do you have any other burning questions for me?”</p><p>“Not for tonight, sir.”  They’d already covered a lot Harry needed to process.</p><p>“It’s fast approaching bedtime, I want you to have enough time to brush your teeth, and anything else you need to do.  I’ll show you to your room.”</p><p>“Room?”</p><p>“Come.”</p><p>Harry followed Snape through the small dungeon quarters down a hall and to the right.  Inside was a plain room, with a double bed, a desk, and set of drawers.  His trunk was at the end of the bed, back to its original size.  It wasn’t much, but it had potential.  All of it a mega step up from living at the Dursleys’.  One thing that stood out from the rest of the stark room, was the plethora of comforters, including a patchwork quilt that looked handmade. “It’s not much yet, Albus put it together for us while I came to fetch you with the help of the house elves, but we can order whatever you need, and we’ll make it nice.  We have a much nicer home I will bring you to when it can be arranged.  You will have your own room there too.”</p><p>Harry didn’t know what to say.  “Thank you, sir.”</p><p>“You may use the loo across the hall to get ready for bed, you can use the mirror there to confirm you are no longer a Smurf.”</p><p>That prompted Harry to look at his skin, which had returned to its usual color.  “Hey, I’m not blue anymore.”</p><p>“Nor are you poisoned,” Severus said, with a giant smile Harry’d never seen before.  “Wonder of wonders.”</p><p>Harry rolled his eyes.  “All I’ve learned is that you take your time with your victims.  Lull them into a false sense of security.”</p><p>“Get to bed, Potter,” Severus said, but he was smiling, which was really starting to weird Harry out.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>~Four Weeks Later~</p>
</center><p>The weird thing about living with Severus, was that it wasn’t weird.</p><p>A lot happened in a month. Severus showed him his birth certificate, and verified it with a paternity potion, which involved both Harry’s and Severus’s blood.  At the end, Harry was more than satisfied about the truth of his paternity.  Frankly, he was happy about it.  No Severus hadn’t been kind to him, but when looking back through his actions, they always had a base of care and worry, they were overlaid with the nasty parts, which Harry was coming to understand was cover.  Still, he had to experience that, and it wasn’t pleasant, but that’s what the therapy was for, and it was already helping loads.  Their therapist, Dorine, was excellent.</p><p>Actually, things were moving smoothly with his father.  The man was strict, which came as no surprise, but Harry already felt loved and cared for, beyond comprehension sometimes.  His father had the ability to mix his severity with love in a way that worked for Harry.  Having new rules, and restrictions pointed out how much he lacked them.  Rules brought him freedom in an odd way.  Without having to make so many decisions on his own, it left room for Harry to relax in between.</p><p>In just four sessions of therapy together, plus four each on their own, they’d hashed out a lot of stuff.  Not to mention, Harry was already pretty good at not living in the past, forgiving, and letting things go, which went a long way to healing.  It made no sense to Harry to hang onto something that wasn’t real.  He’d had feelings, the feelings went through him, and he could let it go without dwelling, merely by <em>choosing</em> to.  All of his father’s actions showed a real commitment to healing what had been wounded between them and that was what Harry decided to focus on. Focusing on mistakes seemed counterproductive to a happy life in general.</p><p>Harry was even allowed to shout at his father during sessions to get his frustrations out, so it didn’t live in his body, or his mind.  Getting the pent-up feelings out of his body like that went a long way to healing from the past, even if the sessions were hard for him and his father.</p><p>It paid off. Harry found they quickly grew an easy comfort with the other, since they found they were alike in many ways, which meant they could butt heads sometimes. But overall it was a good thing. They had the same dry and inappropriate humour; in only a month they’d developed quite a few inside jokes.</p><p>“Really Papa, broccoli again?  If you’re trying to starve me, at least have the courtesy the Durselys had, and tell me to my face.”</p><p>“If I wanted to starve you Potter, I’d do a far better job than they did.  Eat your broccoli.”</p><p>“Is it because it’s green?  Merlin it is, isn’t it?  Broccoli is a Slytherin vegetable.”</p><p>Severus couldn’t keep a straight face and laughed, which his father had a pleasant laugh Harry enjoyed, especially when it was because of something he said.  From then on, they sorted all their food into houses, giving and deducting faux points when they were presented with a dish they either liked, or were offended by.</p><p>Things could have gone another way, if Harry’d let them, but he wasn’t that sort of person.  Harry didn’t want to dwell on the shit parts of his life, he’d rather be playful about them.  He learned from them and it made him who he was.  In fact, he hated the times in therapy when his father broke down, regretful for decisions he made he thought were right at the time, only to find out that they were not.</p><p>This is not to say Harry never felt upset about his previous circumstances, but he saw the new opportunity before him, and rather than waste even more time, he chose to seize the day.</p>
