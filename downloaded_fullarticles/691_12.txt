    <p>The Doctor sat in an dark alley, wishing her long coat would provide more warmth against the howling wind or a warm meal would fill her aching belly, or a home......</p>
<p> </p>
<p>   "At least I have a coat," she thought, reaching into her pockets, and sighed.<br/>
Was she always homeless? Honestly, she didn't know, but that wasn't saying much. She couldn't even remember her name, much less if she owned a home.</p>
<p>   "Meow?"</p>
<p>   The Doctor blinked, pulling a strange, orange device out of her trouser pocket. She pressed the button, and suddenly a bright light and a small sound emitted from the crystal tip.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>    Standing beside her was a grey speckled cat, holding up his paw, with bits of blood leaking from the underside.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Mew?" he asked, quieter, with his lion tail waving. The Doctor frowned.</p>
<p>"Would you like some help, little one?"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>--------</p>
<p>  Newt was lugging a pail of flobber worms to the Kneazles, as they rubbed cat-like on his legs.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>    "Malcom, Timothy?" he called, dumping some in thier resepected bowls. "Rome, Simba?" He turned to see only three, pigging- out. "Simba?"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>   Newt sighed, setting down the empty pail. "Where has your brother gotten off to now?" Newt asked them, climbing the basement stairs. "Simba?"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He could've hit himself, as he realized he didn't close the door all the way.</p>
<p>"Oh, no," he called, going outside. "Simba?" No answer. Newt shut the door and started to look for the tiny creature.</p>
<p>-------</p>
<p> </p>
<p>     The Doctor tore a piece of her already torn sock, holding the lit tool in her mouth. Carefully, making sure there wasn't any glass or metal bits in his paw, she wrapped it up.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>    "It's going to hurt- I'm sorry- but just for a little while, okay?"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>  It meowed in response. "Good boy," she smiled, tying the fabric. She took the sonic from her mouth. The creature stepped, slowly, testing out the pain, into her lap. She rubbed his head, and his ears went back.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>    "Simba!" She heard someone ask, a ball of light lit the alley, brightly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>    The Doctor looked at the comfort animal and asked," Is that your name?"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Simba?" the voice called again.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>   She got up, holding him kindly. "He's okay, he's here."</p>
<p>    The owner of the voice sighed a sigh of relief and she came out of the alley.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>----</p>
<p>  A woman a bit shorter than he came out into the sidewalk, holding the kneazle. It's paw wrapped in bloody cotton fabric.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"He cut himself on something, but I wrapped it up, and he's not limping." she said, handing him over. "He's so cute, though."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>  Now, Newt could acually see her. She had short, blonde hair, that was not too uncommon for the 1920's, but she wore a man's suit, with boots, and she looked like she hadn't cleaned herself in a bit. He face was smugged with dirt and grease and her hair looked filty.</p>
<p>  "What's your name?" She asked. </p>
<p>  "Newt Scamander," He said, kind of awkwardly. "You?"</p>
<p>  She smiled deeper. "No idea! Wloke up four days ago in this alley with zero memoriers, and... it feels so nice to be able to talk to someone, Mr. Scamander."</p>
