          <div class="userstuff"><p align="justify">“Right, Harry, time to get things really started.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You first mate, Veritiserum or dare?”</p><p>“Ron, I don't think…” Harry rubbed the back of his head, hesitating.</p><p>It wasn't that he didn’t want to enjoy himself, to let loose for a few hours.</p><p>Tonight of all nights, it was expected.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>It was just… it’d only been scant months since the war and sometimes he had to remind himself that he <em>could</em> cut loose.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>He could act his age without the burden of imminent death and societal expectations a tangled scarf around his neck, choking him.</p><p>He relaxed his shoulders and took a swig of his drink, grimacing at the taste.</p><p>He truly did prefer butterbeer.</p><p>Ron had booked the back room of the Leaky Cauldron for Harry’s Stag Party. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>The public nature of the spot would have been a concern had it not been warded to the gills by none other than the Acting Minister of Magic himself—Kingsley Shacklebolt.</p><p>Nothing and no-one was going to ruin the last hurrah of the bloody Chosen One.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Or so Ron had announced as he'd pulled a grumbling Harry into the pub for supper.</p><p>Harry flicked his glance around, taking in the group surrounding him. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Those resting in chairs around the table with the remains of their devoured feast cooling upon it and those lounging sated around the perimeter.</p><p>At Ron, his first mate in the Wizarding world, his first true mate ever.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As much as Harry adored Hermione, Ron would always hold the mantle for longest true blue. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Ron was one of the very select few who could truly say they knew the ‘real’ Harry.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The parts he kept for himself, hidden from the world.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One of the very few whom he had no secrets from.</p><p>He took in Dean and Seamus, the former—curiously wearing long sleeves despite the heat given off by the fire—trying without success to keep the latter from drowning himself in his cups before the stag party got underway. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Seamus’s way of dealing with the fallout of war.</p><p>They each had their own vices. Each of them held together by bits and scraps of memories, hopes, nightmares and vices.</p><p>He knew what some of those in the room grappled with, others he wouldn't even begin to guess at or pry.</p><p>Harry took in Neville.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Back to the wall. Eyes darting around the room.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Arms and feet randomly twitching from long term exposure to the cruciatus curse.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Despite that, Neville still emanated a placidness Harry now knew to be a deceptive mask for survival.</p><p>Harry watched as dancing nerves rippled the skin of Neville’s sinewy forearm and caught Neville's eye before, as usual, it slid away.</p><p>‘<em>Why’s he never able to hold my gaze anymore?</em>’ Harry wondered, puzzled.</p><p>These were the boys-turned-men he'd spent his formative years growing up alongside.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Despite their disagreements and differences, when it counted, these were the men who'd stood with Harry against Voldemort and had fought in the war on the frontlines and in the proverbial trenches.</p><p>And then, there were the newer additions to their motley crew.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Draco Malfoy, surprisingly, had turned out to be less of an arsehole and more a sarcastically witty git once free of his father’s tyranny and the enlightenment that blood supremacy was utter bullshit.</p><p>He worked with Hermione, furthering creature rights.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Having no hope in hades of joining Hermione as an employee of the Ministry—”And why in Merlin’s name would I want to tie myself to that bureaucratic stinksap,” he'd muttered once when asked—Draco had gone into private practice with two of their classmates, creating the Wizarding equivalent of a non-profit advocacy organization.</p><p>Daphne Greengrass and Theodore Nott—the latter who was lounging against the fireplace, staring at the flames and pretending not to flinch every time a door slammed in the hallway beyond the door to their room—were the classmates.</p><p>Classmates who Harry could now claim as true acquaintances, if not solidly on the road to proper mates.</p><p>Next to Theodore stood Blaise Zabini.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Now, there was a surprise.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Harry hadn't known Blaise well—or any of the Slytherins—before the war, but had always assumed the Zabini’s were neutral.</p><p>They'd never publicly came out in support of Voldemort's spouted Pure-Blood propaganda, though they'd neither disdained it publicly either.</p><p>According to Hermione, who'd gleaned enough information through conversations with Malfoy and sworn to extreme secrecy, Blaise had lost his father in the first war. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>As she'd relayed the confidential information to Harry and Ron over dinner one evening, she'd told them that one of Voldemort's followers had feared his influence in politics and his sizable wallet, and had cursed the man into an early grave while simultaneously attempting to defile Blaise's<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>mother.</p><p>His mother's magic had fought back to protect her, but the intense struggle splintered something within her magical core.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The result earned her the condition that led to her being crowned ‘The Black Widow.’</p><p>Blaise had started a company whose credo was to assist all muggleborns with integration into Wizarding Society upon their first sign of accidental magic.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Not waiting until they turned eleven to bring them into the fold.</p><p>He claimed it was all done for the designer suits—adamantly deigning Muggle Designers superior to traditional Wizarding tailors—but Harry knew that was just an aloof veneer. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>To those allowed beneath his carefully cultivated facade, they saw a man completely dedicated to eradicating barriers for those he knew to be disadvantaged in their world, and bridging the ignorance gap for both the Pure-Bloods and Muggle-borns alike.</p><p>Harry, Ron And Hermione had become, over the past few months, some of those allowed beneath the surface of his smooth demeanor and Harry felt he could consider both Malfoy and Zabini as friends.</p><p>The rest of the Weasley men had politely declined to partake in the evenings festivities.</p><p>Arthur was still acutely grieving over Fred, Charlie was back with the dragons in Romania, Bill was with Fleur as she dealt with apparently horrific first trimester symptoms, and Percy and George had removed themselves to the continent shortly after the war to escape the haunting memories and the devastating personal losses.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>George had shattered all the mirrors in the Burrow before he left in a fit of mourning after seeing his missing ear, and Percy’s fiancé had been killed in the aftermath of the Battle of Hogwarts shortly after he'd witnessed Fred die in front of him.</p><p>The breaking of the dawn hadn't meant safe, they'd learned.</p><p>Just because Voldemort had fallen didn't mean the war had been completely over.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>There'd been residual resistance throughout the Wizarding Community before the Ministry was able to extinguish the remaining Death Eaters and capture their sympathizers.</p><p>‘<em>Why the fuck am I mulling on this?’</em> Harry thought, knowing the emotional spiral that would occur if he jumped head first into the memory and guilt laden rabbit hole.</p><p>Harry clenched his teeth, willing his thoughts to more neutral, if not happy,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>ground.</p><p>To focus on anticipation of the night ahead, and of the pinnacle event occurring in a fortnight.</p><p>Ginny would become his wife, the Weasley family his family in name as well as in essence.</p><p>This was the time and place of his supposedly last ‘hurrah!’</p><p>After taking in the blokes in the room, he smiled fully.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>No one would betray anything spoken of or done in this room.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></p><p>He was safe.</p><p>And they'd also triple checked that no beetles were present either!</p><p>“Alright Ron, I'm game,” he flung his arm around Ron’s shoulders.</p><p>Ron let out a whoop and clapped in approval, setting about getting the table cleared and the seating area arranged for the next stage of what Harry envisioned would be relatively tame antics and taking the piss.</p><p> </p><p align="center">*******•••xXx•••*******</p><p> </p><p>“S’Alrigh Samush.” Neville slurred, though his glassy eyes were surprisingly focused on the man slouched in the chair in front of him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Verita… virararta… oh bugger.” He waved his hand in annoyance, his face screwed up comically.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Troothsh or dare.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Truth.” Seamus said immediately.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I'm done with dares after that last one!”</p><p>Despite being much farther into his cups than the rest of them, he'd developed a tolerance that allowed him the dignity of not being as noticeably drunk as Neville was.</p><p>Or as Theo, Harry noticed. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>The quiet Slytherin was passed out in a squishy armchair in the corner by the fire.</p><p>The light of the flickering flames threw his delicate bone structure into relief, and the tiny dribble of drool leaking down his chin didn’t detract from the sight of slightly parted reddened lips.</p><p>Lips that bore similar shape and color to Ginny’s.</p><p>Harry took another drink from his tumbler of fire whiskey, finding his throat parched.</p><p>The darkness outside the leaden windows gave testimony to the late hour, and the bodies scattered haphazardly around the room in various states of sobriety and dishevelment indicated how rowdy the night had become.</p><p>“—it’s not something I've ever put a name to it or anything…”</p><p>Harry realized he'd zoned out and missed the first half of Seamus’s answer and the question entirely.</p><p>“What did you ask him, Nev?” He said, though wasn't sure if Neville heard him.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>His face was turning a shade of green…</p><p>“WIZARD DOWN!” Bellowed Ron, as Neville, in spectacular fashion, coated the floor with his stomachs contents.</p><p>‘<em>At least,’</em> Harry thought, ‘<em>Nev was smart enough to turn the other way</em>!’</p><p>Blaise, seated near Harry, gave a sigh and flicked his wand lazily.</p><p>The mess vanished, and with another wave and a flick, so did the smell of sick.</p><p>Neville hoisted himself up and staggered toward the door leading to the loo.</p><p>Harry threw a silencing charm against the door as the sound of retching began.</p><p>“He asked if I prefer blokes to witches, or the other way round,” Seamus answered. “I told him both, in equal fashion. Don't really care which to be honest… it's more the person, you know?”</p><p>Harry blinked.</p><p>“You like…erm, I mean…”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Harry scratched the back of his head, looking slightly bewildered as he took in Seamus with fresh eyes.</p><p>He'd grown up hearing from Uncle Vernon that same gender intimacy was an abomination, and that people like <em>them</em> are why the world was going to the dogs.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>It was a lesson that had permeated Harry's subconscious to a level he hadn't realized until this moment. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>He'd never questioned the possibility of there being any other option than himself with a woman.</p><p>With a witch. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>And honestly, with all that had gone on these past seven years, he hadn’t explored past staying alive, to have the chance to really delve into if he <em>had</em> any other preferences.</p><p>To have someone acknowledge, so casually and forthright, the desire of someone of their own gender, of both, equally…</p><p>It was like the sun had risen over the sill and spread its light across the floor of his suppressed brain, scrubbing at the words of hatred imprinted on the inside of his eyelids.</p><p>He knew that sometimes he could be naive and obtuse, to the annoyance and amusement of his two best mates.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He really hadn't been exposed to much enlightened thinking, growing up the way he had.</p><p>He had so many questions, hearing Seamus’s candid profession.</p><p>Questions spinning around like an obscurial in his brain, waiting to be released upon the air like the newly vanished vomit.</p><p>“Right, my turn.” Blaise said, smoothly interrupting Harry as he began forming the questions into vocalized reality. “Potter, veritaserum or dare?”</p><p>Harry realized with a jolt that he actually hadn't seen the taller man drink past what he'd imbibed over dinner.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Come to think on it, neither had Malfoy.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Draco.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Malfoy.</p><p>Whatever, it was all getting bloody confusing keeping everything untangled in his mind. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Malfoy was the tosser from before, Draco the reformed acquaintance.</p><p>So, Draco.</p><p>Harry had, on the other hand, drank more than he should have knowing he was shite at holding his spirits.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Alcohol, he'd discovered, loosened his tongue, and all the suppressed<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>sass, rage, angst and inappropriate humor had free reign. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>But other than two pink spots on his cheeks, he didn't appear as drunk as he was and no one was the wiser until he suddenly blacked out.</p><p>“Ummmm…” Harry hedged, but then decided to throw caution to the wind. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Truths were always oh so boring, and he felt a twinge of fire dance along his veins in anticipatory abandon.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>He knew the man across from him would come up with something good.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Dare.”</p><p>He'd witnessed the type of dares Blaise had doled out over the course of the night, and wasn't concerned that he'd humiliate him too horribly.</p><p>They were all mates after all, and most weren't in the state to remember much about now anyway.</p><p>It was only as the last of the word left his tongue that he began to feel true unease deep in his veins.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Anticipation be damned.</p><p>Blaise’s eyes gleamed as the flames of the rooms candles danced reflectively in their depths.</p><p>“I admit myself curious Potter… and almost, dissatisfied.” He began, his long fingers stroking his chin thoughtfully. “I've listened to and been witness to years of antagonism and utter hatred between you and Draco. Yet after everything, it seems you've been able to bury the wand and shake hands almost without care.” He dropped his hands, sat forward, and rested his arms on his knees. “How, and why?”</p><p>“Blaise, you're going soft. That's not a dare, that's a truth wrapped in a Hufflepuff scarf,” Draco’s drawl was like smooth whiskey over ice, a direct contrast to the sharp pop and crackle of the fire in the hearth.</p><p>Blaise hadn't let his gaze leave Harry’s, and it was that intensity that prompted him to answer.</p><p>“If Hermione could tolerate him, hades; if she could champion him to Ron and I like she did after everything she'd endured, I figured he must not be such an arrogant arsehole as he'd been.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Or,” Harry coughed, eyes flicking over Draco before slamming back to Blaise, “the arrogant arsehole I'd believed him to be.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That he was someone it was worth getting to know proper.”</p><p>Now both Slytherins turned intense gazes upon him.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Blaise had an almost triumphant air about him, if the slight smirk flirting with the corner of his lips was anything to go by.</p><p>Draco was looking at him like he was a puzzle worth solving. His cheeks were tinged pink with what Harry assumed was heat from the fire across the room.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Couldn't be from his words…</p><p>Harry’s stomach felt off suddenly, like how it did when he'd performed the Wronski Faint and his body and mind traveled faster than his insides.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“I know you're marrying the firecracker in two weeks, and as someone who’s been at the end of her wand more than once I offer sincere congratulations and condolences in advance.”</p><p>Now Blaise leaned back, the epitome of relaxed elegance save for the feral gleam to his gaze.</p><p>“But before then, Potter, your dare is for you to properly put the past behind you two. Put it in the past with the same passion of emotion you threw at each other these past seven years.”</p><p>“What do you—”</p><p>“I dare you, Harry Potter, to snog Draco Malfoy.”</p><p>Harry's mouth gaped open like fish.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>‘<em>What the bloody fuck?</em>’ He thought, trying desperately to quell the sense of intrigue—curiosity?—that arose within him at Blaise's words.</p><p>“Not some second year peck, nor some sixth year Valentine's Day kiss.” Blaise continued. “I mean, a snog worthy of a broom-closet tryst. Let this be the final Battle Ground for all the pent up shite your friends and I have been witness to.”</p><p>Harry turned to throw an incredulous look at Draco only to notice his face shutting down, his features hardening into the facade he’d projected in sixth year.</p><p>The year Harry had been all but obsessed with the blond, stalking him round the clock. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>In fact, he'd spent more time obsessing over Draco then he'd spent fantasizing over Ginny, come to think of it.</p><p>Well if <em>that</em> wasn't a mindfuck…</p><p>“Blaise, no.” Said Draco, ice coating every syllable. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Blaise merely raised an eyebrow at Harry.</p><p>“Well Gryffindor? Are you going to fulfill my dare, or do we need to come up with a proper retribution for forfeiting?”</p><p>Harry looked at Draco.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Draco stared back benignly, lips pressed together, chin thrust slightly forward, posture ridged with ingrained poise.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“That's a bloody cruel thing to inflict upon a best mate Zabini,” Harry said dryly, “Throwing not only his school enemy but also a bloke at him? Look at him! He just said no!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I will not, will <em>never</em>, snog someone unwilling.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>He'd started off in jest, but by the end his words had become louder and edged in granite.</p><p>“And what the fuck kind of dare is that anyway Zabini?” Harry glared at him.</p><p>“Let's just say that Draco and I have an understanding about tonight, and leave it at that.” Blaise said, nonchalantly. “File it under, ‘things Blaise does for shits and giggles.’ And know that, for tonight, I have explicit permission to control Draco’s choices and actions. Or haven't you been paying attention?”</p><p>Harry had, in fact, noticed the way Draco seemed to wait a beat before eating, drinking, bloody hell, even leaving to use the loo. He just hadn't paid mind to it past the notice of observation.</p><p>“What did you—”</p><p>“None of your business Potter,” Draco said, then lowered his eyes briefly. “Harry. Fuck that's a hard habit to break.”</p><p>“Tell me about it,” mumbled Harry.</p><p>“Wa’s happnin’ overs heeer?” Ron swung himself into the chair next to Harry, his mug sloshing on the table what looked like a mix of fire whisky and…</p><p>“Is that blood?” Asked Harry, eyebrows shooting up under his hairline.</p><p>Ron's cheeks flushed brighter than they already were, warmed by drink and fire.</p><p>“T’was a gift, from Charlie. Dragons blood, elf wine and fire whisky mixed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The blood helps stop a hangover and makes the drinker able to…”</p><p>He leaned closer to Harry as if to share a secret.</p><p>His state of drunkenness, however, meant that all in their vicinity heard, “It'll give you increased stamina. You know, in bed.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Ron wiggled his eyebrows and smirked.</p><p>“And you didn't think to share any with the man of the hour, before sampling it yourself?” Drawled Blaise, and both Harry and Draco shot him looks that could have scorched earth.</p><p>“S’why I came over,” Ron said.</p><p>“Here Harry, so you don't feel like dung tomorrow. Have some. ” He held the mug out toward Harry. “Though keep whatever you and Ginny get up to later between yourselves.”</p><p>Harry, knowing he never tolerated liquor well judging by the hippogryffs that paraded through his brain the morning after, took a hardy swig.</p><p>“Fuck that's rancid,” Harry said, grimacing as the thickened liquid slid down his throat. Moments later he felt a warmth in his stomach, which began spreading through his body.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He took a few more, smaller sips, relishing the feeling of contentment and warmth spreading though him.</p><p>“Harry here was just about to fulfill or reneg on a dare,” Blaise said once Harry had retuned the mug to Ron.</p><p>“What's the dare?” Ron asked.</p><p>“To snog Draco,” said Harry, waving his hand toward the pale man in front of him. “And not just a peck, or a school grade kiss. What was it you said Zabini?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“A snog worthy of a broom closet tryst,” Seamus piped in helpfully, and Harry groaned.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>He'd forgotten Seamus was still there, and had heard everything.</p><p>Seamus, who never backed down from a dare, no matter what.</p><p>Seamus, who Harry now knew didn't have a preference for whom he got off with… and no one batted an eye.</p><p>That it was ok!</p><p>Ron's face was comically blank, for all of two seconds, before he roared with laughter.</p><p>“If you'd have picked anyone else, Zabini, I'd have duelled you for asking him to step out on my sister. Even if it is a game!” He shook his head chuckling, and took another sip of his drink. “But these two,” he jerked his thumb at Harry and Draco, “this is payment for the amount of annoying shite they put me and Hermione—and I'm sure you and yours as well—through over the years.”</p><p>Ron’s expression suddenly sobered as he turned toward Harry.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“In fact, Harry, if it hadn't been for the fact you’ve never shown any preference towards males, I'd have thought you were into him. Like, <em>into him</em>, into him.”</p><p>“Sitting right here Weasel.”</p><p>“Eat dung Malfoy,” Ron said cheerfully.</p><p>“Anyway, Harry, the way you went on and on about him every year, I thought at first you were more like Charlie. But then Cho, and Ginny… well, after that I figured he was just your nemesis and that was that.”</p><p>“Charlie likes men?” Blurted Harry, though realized he didn't know the man enough, or at all in fact, to know about his favorite food let alone his sexual presence.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Why this was at all shocking him, he hadn't a clue other than he felt left out of a big, obvious, secret.</p><p>That apparently wasn't secret, or even taboo in the Wizarding world.</p><p>“Of all the things you took from that drivel, that is what you focused on?” Blaise laughed. “You are interesting, Potter.”</p><p>“Well,” Ron says, kicking his leg out at Blaise who merely crossed it over the other out of reach. “He says he prefers the solitude of working with dragons, but if he <em>needs</em> an itch scratched, he seeks out blokes. Found that out graphically when I walked in on him and his dorm-mate, his seventh year over Easter hols.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Ron’s face was an amusing display of disgust and embarrassment at the memory. “It took ages to get the image of his pale freckled arse out of my head!!”</p><p>As the laughter died down, silence fell upon the five wizards sitting around the end of the table farthest from the fire.</p><p>Dean had begged off earlier, needing to be up early for his shift at the Quibbler.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>He was now the official illustrator and layout artist—Graphic Designer not a title in the Wizarding world—and assisted Luna in helping her father establish the paper as a legitimately viewed source of news rather than a joke read.</p><p>Neville was currently desecrating the washroom with his stomach contents, and Theo’s obnoxious snoring reminded Harry of Aunt Marges dog Ripper.</p><p>“Well Harry, you gonna snog the bloke or forfeit?” Said Seamus, nodding toward Draco. “You're holding up the game mate.”</p><p>Harry glanced at Draco, who was inspecting his nails as if he had not a care in the world.</p><p>“Oh bloody hell, it's just a fucking snog,” Harry said, standing up with such force he wobbled slightly on his feet before Ron reached a hand out to steady him. “I'm sure Ginny will take the piss out of me when she hears about this.”</p><p>He looked at Blaise and smirked.</p><p>“Or you,” he said, jabbing his finger toward the smug Slytherin. “Might be the recipient of one of her Bat-bogeys. Be warned Zabini!”</p><p>Harry turned and offered his hand to Draco.</p><p>“Come on, let's get this over with.”</p><p>“So romantic Potter.

Not the Chosen One—I got over that rubbish after first year—but you, Harry. Just you. But I was never on your radar… not until I all but threw myself at you after a match. In public.

Since we announced our engagement actually.”</p><p>Ginny nodded, her eyes blazing through the tears.</p><p>“At first, I felt so guilty, but we weren't together, you and I. You LEFT me Harry, like some delicate flower, but I fought. I was there, in that war, in the bloody trenches.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And I was terrified. Angry. And Neville… well, he saw ME. He fought WITH me, FOR me!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Ginny sniveled, and Harry sat up, reaching for her hand.</p><p>“Not just because it was for the greater good, and I was just along for the ride.” She finished quietly, and Harry grimaced.</p><p>“It wasn't like that Ginny,” Harry whispered, though deep in his gut he wondered if her words held some truth.</p><p>She shrugged.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“It was to me, Harry. Impact over intent.”</p><p>Harry grimaced again.</p><p>“Did you know Neville could have been the Chosen One, instead of me?” Harry asked.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Ginny's eyes widened and she shook her head ‘no.’</p><p>“S’true. Dumbledore told me, after the disaster at the Ministry.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The prophecy applied to both of us, but Voldemort chose me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Marked me. It was a choice between Neville and I before I even knew his name or that he existed at all.”</p><p>Pulling her hand into his lap, he rubbed circles along her knuckles as he asked quietly, “did you, I mean, do you still fancy him?”</p><p>“I don't know,” she mumbled, chewing on her lip before looking up at Harry.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Yes, Harry. Yes, I do. Those feelings didn't just go away because you came back.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But I thought, ok, Harry and I will put it all behind us.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We were in a war, we’ll forge a new life together in peace. Be a unit. The past is past.”</p><p>She shook her head, shoulders drooping.</p><p>“But they're still there.”</p><p>They stared at each other, all the regret and guilt and love and sorrow written upon their faces.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Mirrors of each other's truths.</p><p>“I think,” Harry began, “I think I…”</p><p>He couldn't say it, the words choked in his throat, strangling his tongue.</p><p>Ginny's face softened and she cupped his chin.</p><p>Her thumb traced comforting circles along his jawline, mimicking Harry's movements upon her knuckles, tracing over spots tender from the previous nights activities.</p><p>“Oh Harry,” she said, and there was a gentle rebuke to her words. “One doesn't snog someone the way you and Malfoy apparently went at it last night, if one doesn't have feelings… strong feelings. It's alright to admit that, especially to me, considering everything.”</p><p>Harry felt the wind go out of him.</p><p>This was the first acknowledgment that what he maybe, possibly, felt… that it was ok.</p><p>That he wasn't unworthy, like his Uncle always proclaimed those of his inclination to be.</p><p>“I'm so sorry Ginny.” Harry felt his own tears build behind his eyelids, and soon they were falling alongside Ginny’s. “I never… I hadn't realized…”</p><p>“I know Harry. And that's almost the hardest part.” Ginny raised his chin so she was looking directly in his eyes. “Even though you didn't know it, it was always there, visible to any who chose to look but you…”</p><p>She leaned forward and they sat there, foreheads touching, holding hands as they cried for the loss they knew was happening.</p><p>Had happened—they both just hadn't known to acknowledge it.</p><p>“You know, Hermione warmed me, back in fifth year.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She cautioned that you weren't, well, weren't all that ‘knowledgeable or aware,’ when it came to dealings of sexual desires and all that. She knew I was, growing up with brothers and thin walls; with parents who multiplied like rabbits and who weren't shy with their affections toward one another. But she subtly pointed out ways that your naive nature could hurt you, and me, if we became involved.”</p><p>Harry frowned.</p><p>“It would have been great had she filled me in on that conversation,” he muttered.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Ginny laughed and socked him in the arm.</p><p>“Right, that would have gone well. Since when did you ever listen to her when it came to Malfoy?”</p><p>Harry blushed.</p><p>“Just recently,” he said.</p><p>“Point, me.” Ginny said, then sighed. “You're a good man Harry.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I’m not overly pleased that it took snogging Malfoy on your stag night to realize you're head over tit for the bloke, but better now than after the wedding.”</p><p>“Would there have actually been a wedding Ginny?” Harry asked. “I mean, there's Neville. And, well, it doesn't feel like we were a good fit on either side of this, this go round.”</p><p>“I suppose I'd have done something dramatic like leave you at the stone or something equally gossip worthy.” Ginny cheeked, “Honestly Harry, I would like to think we'd have talked before hand and cleared the air about Neville at least. If last night hadn't happened, I know you and I would have been happy together. I just don't know if we'd have been… fully satisfied.”</p><p>“You felt it too?”</p><p>“The awkwardness? Yeah.” She grimaced sheepishly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I thought it was just because I had more experience so knew what to expect.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It takes a bit of time to figure out how to get a girl off proper, so I knew it would be a bit bumpy at first. Guys are much simpler you know.” She smiled and winked.</p><p>Then made a gesture that would have earned her a stern swat from Mrs. Weasley.</p><p>Harry laughed. Then blushed.</p><p>“Oh sod off,” he said, glad they could still joke with each other despite how raw they both felt.</p><p>“Knowing everything though, it does make things clearer in that respect.” Ginny said and Harry agreed.</p><p>“There always felt like something was missing. Though I didn't know what.”</p><p>“I'd say a Malfoy sized—”</p><p>Harry covered her mouth and shook his head.</p><p>“Not yet. Not there yet Gin. Still getting my head round saying this all out loud. This may not be a total shock to you, but I'm just coming to terms about this about myself.”</p><p>Ginny's eyes softened and she nodded in understanding.</p><p>“So this is yours,” She handed him the engagement ring he'd found in a dusty lead box that had been hidden away toward the rear of the Potter vault. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>The fire opal had suited her, as did the thin gold Gaelic threading around the band.</p><p>It still did.</p><p>“Keep it Ginny,” Harry said, closing her fingers back over the ring. “We may not be getting married anymore but I still love you. I’ll always care for you. Sell it, wear it on a string, give it to Neville's grandmother, whatever… it's yours to do with as you please.”</p><p>Ginny looked at him a moment, then quietly pocketed it.</p><p>She bent and wrapped him in a hug.</p><p>“I'm going to go. I need some time Harry, to sort myself out. And you need time too.”</p><p>Harry nodded, his sinuses clogged from the amount of tears he'd shed so quickly. Summoning two handkerchiefs he handed one to Ginny before wiping his face and blowing his nose.</p><p>“See you around Harry.” Ginny said, dropping a kiss to his forehead.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Then she was up the kitchen stairs and out of the house.</p><p> </p><p align="center">*******•••xXx•••*******</p><p> </p><p>“I wondered when you'd arrive,” Hermione said, pulling a dazed Harry into her arms as he staggered and stumbled out of her floo like a drunken monkey.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>He still hated to use the bloody floo network.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Even after all this time.</p><p>“What do you mean?” Harry said after detangling himself from her welcoming embrace.</p><p>“After what Ron told me, I had to see for myself. I've been practicing, you know? Occlumency and legilimency.”</p><p>“How?” Asked Harry, but knew before Hermione had replied.</p><p>“Malfoy.” They said together.</p><p>“Figures,” Harry muttered.</p><p>“Anyway,” Hermione said, dragging Harry toward the sofa and pushing him down against some sad looking throw pillows. “Ron let me try and see bits of last night. And I…”</p><p>She trailed off, words seeming to fail her as her face turned rather like a tomato.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Are you alright Hermione?”</p><p>“Fine,” she squeaked and Harry whipped his head around at the sound of Ron’s laughter coming from the doorway to the kitchen.</p><p>“Oh she's fine all right.” Said Ron, throwing himself down into the armchair across from the sofa and pulling Hermione down atop his lap from where she'd stood in front of Harry. “More than fine. Apparently seeing you two going at it in my mind lit her fuse, which Charlie's gift helped keep aflame.”</p><p>“Ronald, hush. That's private! And tactless, you great git! Now let. Me. Up!” Hermione said, swatting at her boyfriend, though her words were devoid of any menace.</p><p>Harry was mortified.</p><p>It was one thing to begin to even contemplate, well, what he was contemplating.</p><p>It was another thing entirely to learn that the sight of what he was contemplating impacted his friend's own intimate encounters.</p><p>He felt like Alice falling through the Rabbit hole. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>It had been the only muggle book he'd been able to read cover to cover without Dudley and his gang taking it and destroying it for fun.</p><p>The discombobulated world felt very apt right now.</p><p>“Ginny and I are over,” Harry blurted. “She was with Neville while we were on the run. Still fancies him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Can't blame her, not really. Especially not after…”</p><p>He broke off and gazed into the banked fireplace.</p><p>He saw Hermione and Ron exchange a look through his peripheral vision, before Hermione came and sat next to him on the sofa.</p><p>“Harry,” Hermione said gently, “there's nothing you could say that will change how we see you. How we feel about you.”</p><p>“I don't know how… I wasn't raised to even think the things I'm thinking now.” Harry felt old tensions rise within him, suddenly aware of what those tensions had meant. So many things began to make sense, to slot into holes he hadn’t realized he’d needed filled.</p><p>Cedric.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Tom Riddle from the diary.</p><p>Regulus.</p><p>Hell, even the younger version of Sirius he'd glimpsed in Snape’s pensive memory.</p><p>He'd found all of them incredibly attractive.</p><p>More-so than Fleur, which said a lot about why he was able to withstand her allure where Ron couldn't, even now if caught unawares.</p><p>And earlier, before learning he was a wizard.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Different boys would catch his eye, but he never acknowledged the truth for what it was.</p><p>Part was age and innocence of childhood, part was subconscious suppression for survival.</p><p>And all the while his uncles words paraded though his brain, telling him he's ‘the wrong sort’ while he quietly buried everything that made him more of a freak.</p><p>Like he hadn't heard that, every single day he'd lived with the Dursley's.</p><p>But this time those words hit home and dug in deep.</p><p>“I told you about Charlie, yeah?” Ron said. “He’s my brother and I love him.  And Seamus swings both ways, and hell, if what Hermione says is true regarding Rita's book on Dumbledore, he was himself entangled with Grindlewald in their youth.”</p><p>“Dumbledore?” Harry couldn't picture the elderly Headmaster in any role but the one he'd known him in—picturing him as a young man, with Grindlewald…<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>It was mind boggling.</p><p>More of his internal walls disintegrated at this news.</p><p>“It must have been a massive shock, becoming , well, interested, instead of feeling like you were snogging wet parchment.”</p><p>“Understatement of the century.” mumbled Harry. “It was even more shocking that he snogged me back. That he was as into it as I was.”</p><p>“Oh Harry, you are so blind sometimes. Malfoy has been besotted with you since forever. One only looks at how much he went out of his way to not only gain your attention—and in super creative ways—to know he’s into you.”</p><p>“What's your reasoning behind him calling me a king then Hermione,” Ron asked. “Even wrote a bloody song about me!”</p><p>“To get Harry's attention and with the bonus of humiliating you. Honestly, teaspoons the both of you.”</p><p>She was beaming at them, and Harry felt lighter than he had in…</p><p>Forever, really.</p><p>No Voldemort.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>No shackling Ginny to a man who—now that the floodgates had opened and he saw with clarity his own desires as they were for the first time—wouldn't have been able to satisfy her as she deserved.</p><p>And vice versa.</p><p>He was facing this new and terrifying territory with his best mates beside him.</p><p>“Oi! I just want to say, I don't want to hear anything about what you and Malfoy get up to. Like with Ginny, the ward of silence remains.”</p><p>Harry felt his stomach clench.</p><p>“Is it because he's a bloke?”</p><p>Ron recoiled as if struck.</p><p>“Merlin no Harry! It's because it's bloody Malfoy! If it was any other bloke, but the ferret…”</p><p>Hermione threw a stinging hex at Ron, who yelped.</p><p>“What Ron is doing the worst job of saying, is that once he's over the shock of knowing there's a chance Malfoy will be a part of our lives even more than he anticipated given my current work situation, he will be thrilled to be there to ensure your happiness.”</p><p>“Bleeding ferret.” Harry heard Ron grumble as he rubbed his calf where the hex had hit.</p><p>“And until he gets there, you can always come to me.” Hermione reached out and placed her hand upon Harry's arm, squeezing gently. “You're not alone Harry.”</p><p>And for the first time, in maybe forever, Harry felt the utter truth to those words.</p><p>“Can I use Pig to send an owl?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Course mate,” Ron said, getting up to retrieve Pig from the other room. He came back with some parchment, a quill, and the perpetually rumpled miniature owl.</p><p>Harry penned a letter to Draco, asking if he could pop over.</p><p>“Someone’s eager,” quipped Ron, reading over Harry's shoulder.</p><p>“Oh sod off you wanker.” Laughed Harry.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>It felt great, being with Ron and Hermione.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Knowing he was accepted.</p><p>Just for being Harry.</p><p> </p><p align="center">*******•••xXx•••*******</p><p> </p><p>Harry's hands were sweating as he climbed the steps of Draco's flat. </p><p>He was thankful to not have to return to Malfoy Manor to seek out Draco.</p><p>Following the war, Draco had eschewed anything to do with the Manor or the Malfoy Estate in principle, turning everything to do with the mansion over to his mother and getting a flat with Theodore and Blaise.</p><p>it was located in a posh area of London that apparently was a hotbed for Wizards and Witches<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>hiding in plain sight.  As Harry had walked from the apparition point to Draco’s flat, he’d been captivated by the neighborhood, and found himself enchanted by the quirks and subtle hints of Wizarding culture woven discretely amongst the muggle landscape.</p><p>Upon his father's death—which Harry couldn't say he was particularly saddened over—Draco had shifted all assets that had been used for anything Death Eater related to his mothers competencies, washing his hands of the whole thing completely.</p><p>Draco had then emptied out his entire trust vault left to him by his grandfather, setting up a new vault separate from the old Malfoy money. The ministry was systematically withdrawing reparations from the vaults of those who'd followed Voldemort or were professed Blood Supremists like Umbridge and were now expecting them to financially assist in the rebuilding of the British Wizarding community.</p><p>“Father already destroyed my family once. I’m unwilling to leave myself open to having to pay, yet again, for his bad choices. Let them take from the old accounts.
