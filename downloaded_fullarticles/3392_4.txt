    <p>Ylva pov</p><p>Mama always says that a name is important, whether we are pureblood, halfblood or muggle born, we should be proud of our name. According to mama a name says a lot about a person, for example, she mentioned that the black family name are so important because of the dark arts that they dabble in, just like the Malfoys. </p><p>Mama further mentioned that the Potter’s are just as influential name as the blacks, although they do not have the same love for the dark arts. “A name is set in stone darling, and one should always live up to your name” was her words to me, like Romeo and Juliet the muggle play mom and I saw a few weeks ago, “the Capulets and Montagues would not be seen dead with each other” she would remark ever so often as Romeo and Juliet would declare their undying love towards one another, which tragically was the outcome of the story when they both died for the other.</p><p>I once asked mama why she called me Ylva, as she is so obsessed with the meaning of names, but she never said, there is just always the tiny little smile on her lips as she looks at me at the whole 5,3 curvy body, with my flaming red hair and blue eyes, and my small button nose, and tells me that when I am ready I will understand the meaning of my name.</p><p>I was normal, or as normal as can be I suppose, see the thing is, I have magical powers, yes you heard me correctly I am a witch, well a halfblood witch to be honest, my mom is a witch and my dad is a muggle( non-magic folk) I grew up in a happy home, where mom and dad lived happy in love with each other, there were times we struggled as a family to make ends meet, my Pa being a baker and having his own bakery( no wonder I am a little overweight), and mom working as a healer at St. Mungo’s hospital for Magical Maladies and injuries, but all our mouths were fed, and our beds were warm, and we were very close as a family and that made all the difference in the world, at least it did until Lord Voldemort came and murdered my parents. He tried to kill me too, but unfortunately I was away on vacation with my aunt and uncle in America. My aunt and uncle moved to England after the death of my parents so that I can stay at Hogwarts.</p><p>I am about to start my sixth year as a Gryffindor student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, in Scotland, my best friends are four boys that call themselves the Marauders, again a name with meaning, they call themselves the Marauders because of all the mischief they get up to by pranking people especially the students in Slytherin house, and by specifically a student named Severus Snape, although they call him Snivellus. The Marauders real names are James Potter, he is a tall boy with black unruly hair, brown eyes and glasses, also with a nickname of Prongs, which you would also find out the meaning later, then we have Sirius Black, tall, handsome, player, lady’s man, he has long black hair with grey eyes, and the most mischievous smirk, he was supposed to be sorted into Slytherin like all off the black family members, although he does not at all put any stock in the pureblood superiority nonsense that the rest of his family uphold, he is also called Padfoot by his friends. Third we have the studious, more responsible and more mature Marauder, Remus Lupin, he is tall, with sandy brown hair, brown eyes and his body and face covered in various scars, we call him Moony, lastly we have Peter Pettigrew, a shorter plumper boy with blonde hair, he kind of has a ratty face, and appearance, with his small beady brown eyes, and poor hygiene, he doesn’t smile often, but is always happy to be included in our little circle of friends, the marauders calls him Wormtail, I affectionately refer to him as Wormy. I am also best friends with Lily Evans, who secretly has a crush on James Potter, which she said she is never ever going to admit aloud.</p>
