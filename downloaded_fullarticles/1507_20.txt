          <div class="userstuff"><p>Running in circle’s ‘round a blood thirsty fate<br/>
Tearing out flesh served on fine silver plates<br/>
Words spun with venom laced through the wine<br/>
Dinner parties serving to darken the mind</p><p>A bright brilliant peacock struts through the gate<br/>
The attendants all gasp and frolic and mate<br/>
But the peacock’s pure feathers hide blood dirtied claws<br/>
And the lion among snakes seems the only one who saw</p><p>The peacock speaks boldly and leads them astray<br/>
The lion plays dirty, and planned for this day<br/>
Sneaking around sunsets and skirting the skies<br/>
Seeking out subjects and surfacing lies<br/>
When lions see peacocks they eat them alive</p></div>
