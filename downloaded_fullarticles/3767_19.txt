<p>I woke up in a stranger's bed with pins and needles in my head," came through my headphones as I walked down the street to my favorite coffee shop. It was a little, well, I don't know what color it is.</p>
<p>Let me explain. When we're born, the world is in black and white. And it stays that way until we meet our soulmates. Which I very clearly haven't. But, I'm only 19, so I've got time.</p>
<p>I walk in and order my usual, very complicated, drink. It's 50% espresso, 25% almond milk, 20% almond based creamer, and 5% caramel creamer. Once I get my drink, I take a sip as I walk to a table. Not looking where I'm going, I bump into someone. I look up at the man's face, and the whole world burst into color. I could tell by the look on his face, that it happened to him too. He is tall, about my age, and has black hair and brown eyes framed by glasses. I then notice, my beloved coffee is all over my favorite jacket. He seems to notice too.</p>
<p>"Oh lord, I'm so sorry! Can I buy you a new coffee to make it up to you?" He asked.</p>
<p>"Oh, sure! I'm Lily by the way," I mutter.</p>
<p>"James," he answers. I give him my coffee order and we sit down and talk for hours.</p>
<p>
  <strong>*2 Years Later*</strong>
</p>
<p>BANG! I rush out of the kitchen following the sound, scared that someone broke in. But instead, I find James and our son Harry on the floor of the living room trying to clean up a smashed pumpkin.</p>
<p>"Guys!" I exclaim. They both freeze and look up. Even though Harry is only one, he knows what's up. Harry giggles and my face softens.</p>
<p>Suddenly, there's a different bang. The bang of our front door being knocked to the ground. In its place, stood a man. He was grinning a wicked grin. He pulls a gun on James.</p>
<p>"Lily!" James yells. "Get Harry and run! Run upstairs and out the window. Now!" I scream and pick up my infant son.</p>
<p>I run up the stairs and hear a loud bang. The world goes back to black and white. <strong>(I was gonna end it here, but nope!) </strong></p>
<p>James is dead. The man went quiet. He seemed to have forgotten about us until Harry lets out a wail. I hear boots stomping up the stairs as I close the door to the nursery. Put Harry in a basket with blankets and a bottle. I tie a rope to it and lower it out the window. I drop the rope after it. Then I sent a frantic text to Sirius. It said;</p>
<p>"James has been murdered. Now the man is gonna kill me. Harry is outside. The basket is under the nursery window. Tell him his Mama and Dada love him."</p>
<p>As soon as it sent, the murderer opens the door. I start to cry, thinking about orphaning my child. The man raises his gun and shoots. The bullet goes straight through my stomach. The last thing I see is the strange man shooting himself in the head.</p>
<p>

<p>The man's mask fell off, revealing him as Peter Pettigrew, one of James' best friends.</p></div>
