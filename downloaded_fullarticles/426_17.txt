    <p> She's always been different, if not in obvious ways, but in more subtle ways too. For example she'd always sleep with a seemingly different internal clock, she'd laugh at little insignificant things or at inappropriate times; even prefers foods so left field to her friends it's almost like she's a different entity, like if they like deep-fried, sweet, fatty foods, she likes dried fruits and proper roast dinners with all the trimmings.</p><p> The most glaringly obvious difference about her, however, is the insane pains she gets under her skin over the majority of the left side of her torso. The pain comes and goes, sometimes more intense than others and never at a convenient time for her. It's often itchy as well, meaning she'll scratch at it, maybe under her armpit and get disgusted looks.</p><p> Now, one of the more evident differences is her tattoo; it still hasn't come. It would usually come through about 14, all her friends have theirs, from generic locks and roses to a creature of some kind, or jewellery. They're all quite small, no bigger than a size 11 foot-print, to as small as a penny.</p><p> Harry has a crystal clear glass of an opaque maroon liquid, just below the swell of his shoulder. And Ron, Ron has a brown bunny encased in what must be a crystal ball. This rather detailed tattoo she'd seen, right between his shoulder blades, when he took his shirt off at the lake.</p><p> She loves the lake, it's a sanctuary she likes to take solitude in, all the animals and mythical creatures around her, nature doing it's damnedest to entice her to walk into the forests; and the stones she skips creates an aesthetic even Ron sometimes takes time to enjoy.</p><p> She still, to this day, doesn't know why she was placed in Gryffindor, she's never gotten along with the other Gryffindor girls and would most likely have done a thousand times better if she'd been placed in Ravenclaw with more studious house-mates. She even thinks, for one weird second she'd suit Slytherin, her sarcasm and slyness has never fit in the Gryffindors.</p><p> She remembers all of this as she's looking at the millions of prophecies swirling around her, stacked so high up that if this room had a light source other than the faint blue of their wands or the lightly glowing orbs of words stacked high, there'd probably be clouds swirling around and through the many shelves.</p><p> Harry has just reached for his prophecy when Lucius' arrogant tone clearly splits the air and makes her shiver in distaste.</p><p> The man in question walks out of the shadows, his face obscured by the death eater mask. His pointed hood making him look like an evil gnome and his robes give him a certain finesse any type of billowy long clothes would.</p><p> Harry's just started reaching out to pass the orb to the man, after many complaints from his friends when she collapses, pain ripping through her shoulder and upper ribs.</p><p> A feral scream loosens from her lips and her teeth clench in agony.</p><p> A similarly agonised scream can be heard, but it echoes from wherever it had rung from, making it sound terribly far away. The pain intensifies and she can't decide what's happening around her; her shoulder feels like it's being ripped from her body and her ribs feel like they've all broken at once, making it hard to breath.</p><p> Her body rolls on it's own, disorientating her and squeezing out moans and whines, the pain slowly radiates outwards until she can feel the top of her chest, shoulder, half her upper arm, the side of her neck and the majority of the left upper side of her back, all burning. What must be the middle of the pain sheet starts to dull to a low throb and soon the rest of it has also neutered down to dull throb, any sudden pulse makes her convulse, her sweaty forehead sticking to the grid of the gargantuan room.</p><p> "-rmione! Hermione, can you hear me? Hermione!" Someone shakes her shoulder and she grimaces at the hand pinching into her tender flesh.</p><p> "Hermione!" The world seems to run her over as sound comes back as crackles and shouts. Whoever it was that had given their own scream has seemingly recovered far faster than she has because she can no longer hear them, but then again, from the racket her friends are making and the under-water tint, it wouldn't be a surprise that they have simply drowned the other out.</p><p> Whoever was shaking her shoulder gives up trying to get her attention and opts to lifting her by the arm, slinging her arm over their neck and forcing someone else to sling her other over their neck as well.</p><p> Her head bobs as she's dragged along, ghosts of pain shooting through her whenever either one of her carriers needs to suddenly stop and attack what must be death eaters coming at them.</p><p> She hears Luna cast, soon followed by the distant crashing of glass and crumpling of metal, she must have knocked a shelf over.</p><p> The two carrying her speed up and her feet occasionally catch on the grid beneath them as the soles of her shoes dig into the little holes.</p><p> "Over here!" She hears and suddenly they've changed direction, opting to run down a narrower path branching off of the main pathway. She grunts every so often when one of the guys carrying her runs into a shelf accidentally. The isle doesn't seem to be big enough for all three of them.</p><p> Then she's falling, or it might be her muddled mind playing tricks on her, but she swears she was being tugged along by two people one second and the next she's fallen through, or more rather pushed, through a narrow door that slams shut as the last of them fall through it.</p><p> She sighs as the feeling of weightlessness settles into her bones, lifting the gravity from her tortured shoulder and giving her a chance to breath; although it's hard to do so with wind whipping around her head.</p><p> Surprised yells echo around her, which is soon interrupted with umphs and she cries out as all of a sudden, gravity's back to punish her.</p><p> She flops to the ground and just lies there, unable to move her tortured limbs, they feel like they're on fire.</p><p> "Hermione!, Get up, come on!" She's soon tugged to her feet again, but one side of her feels lower down than it was, they must have swapped she thinks. She can barely roll her head to the side, let alone open her eyes.</p><p> "Wooaaahhhh, what <em>is</em> that?" She grunts as she's settled against something cold and hard.</p><p> "I hear them too Harry."</p><p> "What? It's an empty arch."</p><p> "No, there are voices."</p><p> A few shouts and murmured warnings either too distorted or too quiet for her to hear, and then. "Give me the prophecy boy." Lucius Malfoy sounds so very appealing in that moment.</p><p> His calm words, enticing every bone in her body to sleep. But she can't, she needs to wake up, get up, do something!</p><p> She's just managed to stand up, leaning heavily on the wall for support when there's a flurry of activity behind her and she's soon pinned to someone's front.</p><p> She can't help her head flop back onto her captor's shoulder, it's lower than her head is and she grunts as it strains in the air to reach it's target. "Shhh." The arm that isn't firmly holding her arms to her sides strokes her back. "We wouldn't want to hurt ourselves any more now, would we?" The sultry calm words of the woman behind her soothes her, and a deliberately placed breath tickles it's way past the shell of her ear.</p><p> She tries to speak but her dry throat refuses to co-operate and the woman tuts and coos to her quietly.</p><p> She's oblivious to what's happening in the room around her.</p><p> There's a gentle tug on her sleeve as it's pulled down her arm and straightened out. The woman rests her chin on Hermione's shoulder, close enough to force their cheeks to press together and her face reddens at the surprising heat flooding through her veins.</p><p> "Let her GO!"</p><p> "Aww, does lickle gingy want his play-thing back?" The woman taunts, Hermione shivers, but not out of disgust.</p><p> "She's defenceless, you're <em>sick</em>." Another voice yells in their direction. Hermione finally manages to squint her eyes open and rolls her head enough to get a lung-full of cinnamon smelling curly black hair.</p><p> There's maniac laughter bubbling out of the chest pressed to her back and she struggles to keep her knees locked so she doesn't collapse, this woman is supporting far more of her than she can help. But the witch doesn't seem to mind, nor notice as she's shifted a little.</p><p> She stares at the ceiling, her bearings slowly filing back into her, even as white plooms of smoke join the party and the woman behind her tenses, but doesn't let go. She moves and Hermione moves with, unable to not. Nymphadora's voice rings through her head as a light grunt blows into her ear from behind and the arms circling her loosen.</p><p> She's dropped, but a warm bony hand grabs her wrist just as an equally warm palm grabs her forearm. She can tell the three of them are airborne.</p><p> "Hermione!" The grip on her forearm falters and is soon pushed off and she's still flying around now only supported by one warm grip, that warm grip soon turns into two secure arms.</p><p> The wind buffets around her as soft lashes from whatever the smoke is hits her face, there's a pull behind her bellybutton as they apparate away; the sound of spells crackling and pained shouts from both sides instantly disappears, soon to be replaced by the light crackle of a nearby fire, she's placed on a soft fluffy rug.</p><p> "Bella! What are you doing? Why is she here?" Hermione curls into herself, trying to creep closer to the fire's warmth.</p><p> "What's wrong mother?"</p><p> Warm hands sweep away tiny baby hairs from her neck, letting the cool air and warmth of the fire wrap her up in a nice blanket of serenity. "Why is <em>she</em> here?!"</p><p> "Will you two shut up?" That same voice, that now has a name, that nice, soothing voice that could send flowers into early bloom and rough seas to calm. That voice, Bella.</p><p>~~~</p><p> It's worse than a crucio, that's for sure. About ten times worse to be more accurate; her back feels like it's being ripped open and her spine's being mangled to death by rats.</p><p> A scream tears from her throat, unable to help it and she grunts as she grits her teeth out of sheer determination to see through the pain. She's felt worse, she tells herself, far, far worse.</p><p> Up! Get up!</p><p> She teeters on the edge of collapsing again and falls against one of the metal shelves to ensure she doesn't.</p><p> Move!</p><p> She takes a step, then two and soon she's following one foot behind the other, wobbling precariously, leaning left and right as she tries to run after the little shits.</p><p> The shelves start collapsing in on themselves as the idiot blonde blasts one of her comrades back. The shouting of the teens stops as the slam of a door sounds loudly over the smashing of glass. Those still caught within the disaster of smashed glass, soon to meet their fate, but not her, no, she needs to find the girl.</p><p> She needs to know.</p><p> Her fellow death eaters and her apparate out of the room, leaving the masses of smashed glass and crumpled metal to be tidied by someone who actually cares, and reappear, circling at the top of a very tall room. The death chamber if the arch she spies is anything to go by.</p><p> Her arm twinges every now and then, but it's nothing compared to the pain from earlier. She shudders at the thought.</p><p> She watches like a hawk as Malfoy talks to the boy and his followers.</p><p> The girl!</p><p> She's propped up by the wall off to one side, well out of harms way, not if she can help it. She grins - oh the things I will do to you. - She looks up at her fellow death eaters and growls lowly. "She's mine." She doesn't need to specify to whom she's referring, they already know.</p><p> Mudblood, the girl, she's mine.</p><p> Lucius fails in coaxing the boy to give him the globe, and that's when she reacts, like a caterpillar’s body the other's follow and they soon have everyone pinned.</p><p> The girl grunts as her head falls back against her shoulder and she can't help the pang of sympathy that courses through her. "Shhh, we wouldn't want to hurt ourselves any more now, would we?" She rubs a hand into the girl's back and the tenseness seems to loosen in the girl's stance, or what little isn't supported by herself.</p><p> She spies a glimpse of a castle turret, glowing lights warming the picturesque brickwork and bringing the girl's thin neck to life. It's a masterpiece. She grins.</p><p> Of all the people.</p><p> The girl slouches further and Bellatrix stands a little taller, subconsciously offering her as much comfort as she can in the position they're in. She breathes over the shell of her ear and rests her chin on a dainty shoulder.</p><p> "Let her GO!" She looks up to the ginger boy, and squints. Little rat.</p><p> "Aww, does lickle gingy want his play-thing back?" She taunts. The disgruntled look on his face is priceless.</p><p> "She's defenceless, you're <em>sick</em>." Another voice yells in her direction. The girl in her arms rolls her head and she smirks as a little moan leaves her lips. She cackles and clutches onto the brunette more firmly, she's now almost a dead weight, but she's like a stick anyway, naturally lanky.</p><p> Her sister's Nymph appears and she scowls, "Give her to me." Bellatrix scowls, that's not nice, has she not learnt to leave what is not hers. She can do with them what she will.</p><p> The auror casts plenty of strong spells, one catches her arm as she tries to twist the girl out of the way of her Niece's poor aim. She's momentarily stunned but it's long enough for the young witch to slip from her arms and she only just has enough time to latch onto one of her wrists as her niece does too.</p><p> "Hermione!" Bellatrix lets her smug look take over her face as Nymphadora falls away, hit by a rather well timed flipendo.</p><p> Time to go. </p><p> The room's rather overwhelming noise soon disappears and is replaced by her Sister's library and warm fire. Said witch slams her book shut and launches herself out of the chair. "Bella! What are you doing? Why is she here?" The brunette curls forward, trying to wriggle closer to the roaring fire.</p><p> "What's wrong mother?" Draco comes in just as she's reaching to brush soft hairs away from the girl's neck and strokes a light thumb over the tattooed turret. "Why is she here?!" She scowls as Draco's squeaky voice breaks her eardrum and makes the girl on the rug whimper in discomfort.</p><p> "Will you two shut up?" She throws over her shoulder, far too enraptured with the girl already.</p><p> By the time both blondes have stopped moving forward she's picked the girl up, her soft snores giving away her state of unconsciousness. She smiles. "Goodnight, Cissa"</p><p> And with that she exits the library in a flurry of black lace skirts.</p><p>~~~</p><p> The girl moans softly and ruffles about under a thick black duvet.</p><p> Bellatrix perks up at the movement, but then the young witch stills, and her head drops back down when there's no other sign of the girl actually being alive. "Come on Muddy, please wake up soon." She whispers, stroking her thumb over the back of a sun-kissed hand.</p><p> "Bella you need to eat."</p><p> She waves her hand in the direction of the door, where her youngest sister's head pokes round.</p><p> "It won't do you any good not eating and stressing over the girl. You know this."</p><p> "Go away! Cissy." The younger witch sighs and pulls the door shut with a click.</p><p> The black grandfather clock in the corner of her room chimes at seven. Five hours since she'd apparated the girl here. She sighs. Cissy has come in twice, the first to give her a pain potion and the other to give her a large hand held mirror.</p><p> The moment her darling sister had vanished again she had untied her corset, letting it flop to her waist, casting a glance at the other girl once in a while and turned her back to the large standing mirror next to the window.</p><p> She had held the hand held herself and inspected the new tattoo that covers the majority of her back, lower neck and dips just below where her skirt fabric hugs her hips. The tattoo itself is beautiful, just like the creature in her bed.</p><p> The scene depicting Hogwart's Black Lake, but from the vantage point of the viewer in which Jean clad legs stretch out before the lake with books dotted about on either side. The book in the viewer's hand clearly says 'pride and prejudice' she had frowned in thought, she'd never heard of that book title before.</p><p> But before she could further delve into her memories a quiet moan had floated up into the room and she'd quickly clothed herself with a flick of her wand and reappeared beside the sleeping girl.</p><p> Kitten hasn't moved since.</p><p> She forewent tea time in favour of being there when the girl wakes. She must have felt the tattoo's painful materialism far more than she had, her body obviously unable to cope with the sensory overload.</p><p> The girl shuffles again, but then rolls over and curls towards Bellatrix. She tugs the hand into the circle of her body and sighs. "Wake up little witch."</p><p> Said witch huffs and her brow furrows a little. Bellatrix smiles and pushes back a large amount of brown hair from the girl's forehead, she leans closer, "wake up, little witch."</p><p> The girl mumbles and curls more tightly around the hand she's pulled into her stomach.</p><p> She smiles, the girl - Hermione if she remembers correctly - seems to be a sleeper. "Wake up, you need food, if you do not eat, I will heve to force it down you." She squeezes the hand in hers.</p><p> "M'not hungry Molly." Bellatrix frowns, Molly?</p><p> "You need food girl. Wake up."</p><p> An "mmmmhhhhhhnnnooooo." is exhaled and Bellatrix sighs, the girl is also proving to be rather stubborn.</p><p> "Fine, if you won't voluntarily wake up, I'll take matters into my own hands." She stands from her stool, grabs the end of the rumpled duvet and tugs, effectively pulling the thick cover off of the girl who whines in complaint and abruptly sits up, her eyes stubbornly closed as she feels around for the lost warmth.</p><p> Not being able to find said duvet, she yawns and stretches, seemingly oblivious to Bellatrix stood beside her, doing her absolute best to burn holes through her head with an intense glare.</p><p> Her sixth sense seems to come into play and slowly a bleary eyed brunette turns towards the older witch. Her gaze is focused on Bellatrix's face now, her head tilted in thought as her sleep addled mind tries to remember who she's looking at.</p><p> "You know, there's plenty of food in the kitchens if you would care to wake up fully." Bellatrix huffs, she crosses her arms.</p><p> And just like that, the trance the girl was in is broken and she jumps a mile high trying to get off the bed. "Y-you'r-you're. Yo-" She falls over the side of the bed with a thump and groan.</p><p> Then her head pops up, along with a wand raised in her direction.</p><p> "Really? This is the best I get for the hospitality I've shown."</p><p> "Well, what do you expect when you're stood right there."</p><p> Bellatrix looks down at her feet, stood firmly planted on the wooden floor. "Yeees." She says slowly, looking back up to the girl's head. "I could stand over here if you'd like?" She takes a single step back.</p><p> "No I mean as in you...you're Bellatrix Black Lestrange, how can I not try to defend myself." The witch's wand wavers slightly as her hand shakes.</p><p> "Now, before you start, I want you to consider that A) I'm far more powerful than you could ever dream to be, B)I've looked over you, ensuring your health, I'd have thought if I'd have wanted to kill or maim you I would have already done so and C) You still have your wand." She crosses her arms over her chest with impatience.</p><p> "Oh, and I hate the name Lestrange. I loathe my husband."</p><p> "Why have you kidnapped me?" The girl ducks a little further behind the bed.</p><p> "Please, I haven't kidnapped you, I merely....borrowed you. There has been a recent happening that I find you will be rather interested in."</p><p> The brunette raises an eyebrow.</p><p> "Which I will not show to you yet, you have to earn that right. Now, you can either put that wand away and go about today in a more civilised manner, or you can develop arm-ache in, what I assume, is your already sore arm."</p><p> She watches with a gleam in her eye as the brunette shifts uncomfortably before letting her arm drop to the bed with a sigh of relief.</p><p> "Now.....Tea?" She turns to the door, she then steps forward until at least a meter from the exit and holds her elbow out expectantly. She doesn't turn around and soon feels a hand slip into the crook of her arm.</p><p> "Why am I here?"</p><p> "Like I say, I will show you in good time. You must have patience little witch." She doesn't need to look up to the young witch to know the face she's pulled at the nickname.</p><p> They make it to the long dinner table, in one of the smaller dining rooms to find the three Malfoys still sat eating quite happily.</p><p> The girl trailing closely behind her pauses in the doorway and Bellatrix turns back with an expectant look. She holds a hand out, the same hand that's attached to the same arm where she had held onto earlier.</p><p> The young witch hesitates for a moment, wearily eyeing the preferred hand before sliding her own into it and allowing herself to be gently tugged towards the table. All three pairs of eyes look up. Draco seems to choke around his mouthful of food and Lucius lets out an indignant cough.</p><p> "Ah, Bella, so good of you to join us. And you are?" Hermione looks up for a second before her eyes instantly flit back to the floor.</p><p> "Hermione, Hermione Granger." She says awkwardly, toeing the ground as Bellatrix takes a seat.</p><p> "Come now little witch, you can't be expected to stand there idly by now would you?" Her dearest sister passes her hand over the chair furthest from herself, on the other side of Bellatrix, with Draco facing her.</p><p> Her poor nephew doesn't know what to do with himself as he glares at the girl across from him.</p><p> Bellatrix sneaks a hand across the small gap and rests it on the girl's jiggling knee; she tenses under said touch and with a quick reassuring glance relaxes again.</p><p> Narcissa clicks her fingers and a little elf in a torn, dark grey rag that just barely clings to one of it's shoulders appears next to the blonde witch. "Twiggy, would you be a dear and serve our guest?" The Elf squeaks in reply and snaps back out of the room.</p><p> "Now, I think I'm speaking on behalf of my darling husband and son, why are you here?"</p><p> The brunette turns to Bellatrix, who raises an eyebrow at the girl. "Why am I here?" She mutters and older witch smiles faintly.</p><p> "As I have said to you on at least two occasions already, you will find out once you've earned that right. Along with you dearest Cissa." Narcissa only sits up straighter and eyes the black haired witch in thought.</p><p> Lucius coughs and sips his wine, trying to clear his throat. "You will remain quiet until I have told Cissy at least." The man coughs further, the threat coming across as clear as a whistle.</p><p> By the end of the meal, and the three Malfoys had patiently waited for Bellatrix and the little witch to finish eating, Hermione has seemed to have relaxed enough to converse with the three blondes as she had in Bellatrix's room. She's got quite a bit of sass.</p><p> They'd made their way into the library, where there's a lit fire, which Draco sits infront of, her sister and brother-in-law are sat in the smaller of the two settees and Hermione and herself are sat in the leather three seater, at a clear vantage point of the other settee.</p><p> Lucius and Bellatrix have a glass of fire whiskey each, and Narcissa has a glass of wine.</p><p> Bellatrix discretely watches as Hermione itches part of her shoulder, which she knows has the tattoo beneath. The eldest Black doesn't think the brunette knows she has her tattoo yet.</p><p> "So Hermione, it has come to my attention that you have a distinct knack for getting top marks in nearly every subject, is this true?" Narcissa watches Hermione intently, awaiting an answer.</p><p> "I do, yes. I do find it hard to find a challenge though."</p><p> "I understand, my sister has always sought out more of an obstacle in her work." Bellatrix smiles faintly at her sister's subtle compliment.</p><p> Hermione yawns and unknowingly shuffles closer to Bellatrix, who happily accepts the new distance with an open arm. Hermione hesitates for all of two seconds before she happily curls under the bend of her arm.</p><p> When the brunette has rested her head on her chest she rests her own on the crown of the young witch's head and squeezes the shoulder trapped beneath her hand.</p><p> Bellatrix looks back to Narcissa who looks like she's about to question what she's just witnessed and shakes her head with a look that says 'no'.  The blonde nods quietly, the men oblivious to what just transpired, having branched off into their own conversation a while ago.</p><p> It isn't long before Hermione's fallen asleep and Bellatrix is carding her fingers through knotted bushy hair. She presses a kiss to her forehead before sliding an arm under her knees and lifting her up.</p><p> "Goodnight, Cissta." She carefully flicks her wand, which pushes her hair slightly to the side to reveal part of her tattoo and she just knows her sister has seen it.</p><p> She makes it to her bedroom in record time and gently lays the girl on her now dark green duvet.</p><p> She takes a moment to just stand and watch the girl, tracing each and every feature, from the faint laughter lines creasing her eyes to the incredibly faint dimple in her cheek.</p><p> She's utter perfection and Bellatrix doesn't know what to do with herself in light of her roaring emotions. They are far too alien to her to start figuring out and her head hurts when she dwells too long on them.</p><p> She leans down to, once again, brush her unruly hair out of her face and traces a finger over the tattoo on her neck stood proudly poking out of the collar of her shirt.</p><p> Hogwarts, her sanctuary, or what was once her sanctuary. Her teachers understood her, had understood her, they'd probably be horrified if they saw her now.</p><p> She really isn't all that evil, the media likes to fabricate and expand, make things more...idealistic. Sometimes she really hates the media, but it is good for making her infamous. After all, stories must originate on an idea, no matter how small it is. She grins to herself.</p><p> This sweet, innocent, naïve little witch ... she won't know what's hit her.</p><p> Her hand tugs at the back of the girl's neck, bunching the soft hairs together and exposing her throat. She leans down to press her lips to the steady pulse, this girl, the other half of her life source, will know what it means to be Bellatrix Black's soulmate.</p>
