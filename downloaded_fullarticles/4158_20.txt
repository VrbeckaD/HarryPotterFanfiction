    <strong>Dedicated to: </strong>
  </em>
  <em>
    <strong>those who died not only in the books, but the ones in our own world, who sacrificed for various causes, whether they were victorious or not.</strong>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <strong>We will celebrate their lives, and not their deaths.</strong>
  </em>
</p><hr/><p>
  <em>No words can tell, no flowers repay,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The loss we had one year today</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Till memories fail and life departs,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>You will live forever in our hearts.</em>
</p><p>~In memory of all those who died or fell victim during both Wizarding Wars</p><hr/><p>Do you remember those who laid down their lives, those who cast away their youth, their possible legacies, ambitions, possibilities, and sanities? Those who not only are remembered on the carving of a tombstone, but are also wasting away, quiet and unnoticed, while their hopes and dreams live on without them?</p><p>The names of those who died or sacrificed in both the first and second Wizarding Wars will live on in wizarding textbooks, but only their memories, and not who they were truly, will live on.</p><p>Let this following memorial, Only Our Memories Live On truly celebrate the sacrifices, by celebrating the victims, and celebrating their lives, however short they were.</p><hr/><p>
  <em>In the quiet of the evening</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I sit and think of you,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I open up my memory book,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Of the things we used to do,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>And as I turn the pages,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>My eyes are filled with tears,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>For, although I have my memories,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I can't hold back the years.</em>
</p><p>~Dedicated to those who died not only in the books, but the ones in our own world, who sacrificed for various causes, whether they were victorious or not.</p><p>Remember them, by not HOW they died, but for what they died, for whom, and most of all, but they truly gave up, whether it is a normal life, ambition, or the experience of what life has to offer.</p>
