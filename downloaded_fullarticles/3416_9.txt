    <p>
  <strong>Hello and thank you for taking an interest in my story.</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>This is a Bill Weasley/OC fanfiction. I have nothing against Fleur, I just feel that BIll is underappreciated and I really love him.</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>Harry Potter was the very first fanfiction that I started reading and I always come back to it. I thought, 'why not write a Bill/OC fanfiction?' So, I have started one and am sort of happy with how it's coming along.</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>Ophelia is currently twenty-two in the story but will be turning twenty-three in November. She's the same age and Tonks and Charlie, having gone to Hogwarts with them. Bill is twenty-four but will be turning twenty-five.</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>My OC is from the Black family and is Sirius' sister - not his daughter.</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>I really do hope you enjoy this story and please tell me what you think either through reviews or PMing me if you wish.</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>Please enjoy - thank you x Comet96 xx</strong>

  <strong>I'm Nervous and my Hair's Turned to Teal.</strong>
</p><p>Why did a knock at the door seem so frightening?</p><p>I suppose it had everything to do with Voldemort returning and the dangers we would be facing in the coming years.</p><p>"Are you ready?" Sirius asked, his hand settling on my shoulder carefully. It was like he knew what was going on inside my head and didn't want to startle me.</p><p>I looked up at my older brother, giving him a bright smile to try and reassure him. Sirius smirked, lifting a strand of my curly hair that was now a bright teal. I cursed under my breath, shaking my hair until it settled on black. While it may have been my natural colour, it wasn't my preferred ginger, it also showed that I was stressed.</p><p>That was one downfall of being a Metamorphmagus. My hair was always a dead giveaway for my emotions.</p><p>It seemed that it was a family trait, seeing as our cousin, Nymphadora also has the gene. Andromeda, Dora's mother, and my cousin had told us that one of our ancestors in the Black family was also a Metamorphmagus, but that had been centuries ago.</p><p>"I'm just stressed and worried," I told him, rising from my seat as another knock could be heard.</p><p>"FILTHY BLOOD-TRAITOR! HOW DARE YOU STEP FOOT IN MY HOUSE!" I shared a look with Sirius at the yells of our mother, hoping he'd go deal with her while I answered the door.</p><p>"You can deal with, mother," He said, rushing out of the parlour. I huffed, pulling my wand from my boot as I rose.</p><p>"You always do this," I grumbled, wishing Sirius was here to listen.</p><p>Stumbling over the bottom step, I was sure Kreacher had tripped me, I wasn't as clumsy as Dora, I started up to the first floor, where mother's portrait hung in the hall.</p><p>"Ophelia, sweetheart," she said softly, her eyes lighting up upon seeing me. It was no secret that Reg had been mother's favourite, but I had been her only daughter and she loved me for it. I hadn't liked her, not after the way she treated Sirius.</p><p>He had always been my favourite.</p><p>"Mother," I greeted, rolling my eyes. It wasn't unusual for her to greet me pleasantly and then start yelling when she remembered I chose to live with Andromeda rather than Narcissa.Â <em>Silencio.</em></p><p>With my nonverbal spell, Mother was silenced, and I no longer had to listen to her whining voice. Hopefully, it would last for a while, and the closed drapes over her frame would stop her from shouting.</p><p>"Opie," Sirius called, using my nickname. I glanced down at him, seeing Albus Dumbledore standing behind him with Minerva McGonagall. "Are you ready?" Why did he keep asking me that?</p><p>"I suppose there's no need to wait any longer, right?" I muttered, descending the stairs, giving a small smile to each Professor.</p><p>"No need in postponing it, Miss Black," Albus agreed, waving his hand towards the kitchen.</p><p>Sirius nodded, leading us down to the kitchen and I followed, feeling like I was back at Hogwarts and was being sent to the Headmasters office. As we all sat down at the large table, I flicked my want and a tea set appeared, the teapot steaming with a strong brew. The teapot filled the cups, which then floated in front of us before settling. Milk and sugar were added to those that preferred it.</p><p>"Thank you," Albus said, picking up his cup and sipping the hot tea. "You know why we came."</p><p>"Because we offered the house as headquarters for The Order," I replied, feeling the need to hurry this along so we could get it over and done with. I was feeling stressed enough as it was without the added intensity of the situation.</p><p>"Yes, and we'd like to use it, but first we need to add the Fidelius Charm to prevent unwanted guests from coming," Albus stated. I nodded, feeling that he was being reasonable.</p><p>A few members of the family knew about the house, but with the Fidelius Charm placed upon the house, along with a few other spells father placed upon the building, they wouldn't be able to enter.</p><p>"Who's it going to be?" Sirius asked, his eyes flicking between Albus and Minerva. "Ophelia, right? Seeing as the house is hers." I felt the shock brush through me at his words. Did he think I owned the house?</p><p>"The house isn't mine," I told my brother. He looked at me, his eyes flicking over my hair and down to my hands. I glanced at my hands holding my teacup to see that my fingernails were a lime green, no doubt matching my hair.</p><p>It was a trick I had taught myself back at Hogwarts, turning my fingernails the same colour as my hair so I could keep my morphing in check. I was still having issues with my emotions, finding it hard to keep them under control.</p><p>Lime green could mean shock or surprise.</p><p>I had logged all the colours and connected them with emotions, sometimes the emotion was different, and I tended to work out which I was feeling.</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"Mother left it to me, but I was only thirteen when she died. Father had left you in the will, but mother changed it after he died. She didn't want you having the house, but it's your birthright." I glanced at Albus seeing him nod. "I asked Albus to help me write a new will, and I was adamant that the house belonged to you, even if you were in Azkaban," I told him, wanting to make things clear with him.</p><p>I didn't want him treading carefully around me in the house because he thought it was mine. It was his home now and he could do what he wanted with it. That was why I was so accepting when he asked if it could be set as headquarters.</p><p>"You did that for me?" Sirius asked softly, a gentleness in his eyes. I shrugged, it was no big deal after all and I didn't want the house, I was fine at Andie's.</p><p>"It's yours," I told him, closing my eyes briefly to change my hair from lime green to ginger. Mother hated it when my hair was ginger or red. It was too Gryffindor for her and she despised it.</p><p>"Shall we move on then?" Albus asked, a twinkle in his eyes. I had thought he told Sirius he owned this place, he wouldn't have been on the run for almost a year if he had this place.</p><p>"Albus, you'll be Secret Keeper, won't you?" I asked, not being able to trust anyone more than him. He shook his head, confusing me.</p><p>"I was thinking of having more than one."</p><p>"You can do that?" I asked simultaneously with Sirius.</p><p>"Some wizards can." He shared a look with Minerva before looking back at us. "I suggest that along with me, the pair of you also become Secret Keepers. It'll be safer in the end. Sirius can't leave the house, so people won't suspect him, I'll be at Hogwarts and I'm under investigation with the Ministry, so I'll be watched regularly. Ophelia can easily change her appearance and not be recognized, she can go around and inform the Order of the headquarters," he explained.</p><p>"I thought having more than one Secret Keeper would be more dangerous," I mumbled, tapping my fingers on the table.</p><p>"It's safer, it'll be harder to figure out who the Keeper is when it's three of us." Albus did make it seem like the better solution.</p><p>"I agree," Sirius said, the passion detectable in his voice.</p><p>I knew he would agree. Albus had warned him not to leave the house at all and I knew he felt like this was his way of helping the Order.</p><p>"I think it's a solid plan," I sighed, rising from the table, running my hand through my hair. "Shall we get on with it then?"</p><p>Albus rose, followed by the other two and he led us up the stairs and out of the house into the night. Crossing over to the park, we stood in front of the gates, looking at the house.</p><p>Albus cast the spell on himself first before turning his wand on Sirius. A cold feeling washed over me as his wand landed on me. An intense pressure on my shoulders and then I felt light.</p><p>"Well, that's all planned out," Albus said, his eyes flashing to Minerva as he handed her a piece of paper, no doubt with the address on. She took it, read the words and then set the paper on fire. "We'll leave you for tonight, but I do ask if you will go to the Weasley's and inform them on the headquarters immediately, Ophelia." I nodded, understanding why he wanted them to know so soon. "I'll inform Kingsley, Alistair and a few others tonight. We'll be around tomorrow at eight for our first meeting."</p><p>"Good night, Albus, Minerva," Sirius said just before they apparated. He glanced at me, giving me a warning look, one that said, 'be safe'. I gave him a small smile before apparating.</p><hr/><p>
