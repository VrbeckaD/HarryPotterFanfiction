"So much <em>green;</em> it's unnatural."</p><p>"<em>Green</em>," Draco sniffed, "is arguably the <em>most </em>natural colour; and <em>'all this'</em>, Potter, is breakfast: A good, healthy breakfast."</p><p>"What's wrong with coffee and a doughnut?" Harry complained, taking a coffee cup, "And why are these cups so small anyway; are these for the house-elves?" Draco watched him hold it in front of his face, scowling before wandlessly enlarging the cup to three times its original size.</p><p>"Well, that <em>was </em>an espresso cup; and doughnuts, Potter, are not healthy," Draco sighed, "nor are they acceptable breakfast fare. We're having green juice with avocado and eggs on toast."</p><p><em>"Green juice,"</em> Harry scoffed. "You know <em>green</em> isn't actually a flavour; though it sounds like it'll taste healthy<em>.</em> Juice shouldn't taste healthy, it's meant to taste good. Otherwise, it's not juice; it's a <em>potion</em>."</p><p>"It does taste good," Draco protested, throwing the ingredients into the juicer. "It's made with green apples, pineapple, cucumber, yellow carrot, celery, kale, capsicum, mint and Chlorophyll."</p><p>Harry winced, swallowing his coffee too quickly, "Chloro-<em>what?</em> Isn't that the thing with plants and sunlight? Sounds like a potions ingredient to me..." He picked up the bottle of dark green liquid from the counter, "Do you need a prescription for this? Is it even legal? Are you sicâ€”"</p><p>"Potter!" Draco snapped, "it's just food. I'm not sick, it isn't illegal, and I'm not asking permission to have a healthy fucking breakfast!"</p><p>Draco held his finger on the button of the juicer, drowning Harry's attempt to respond, taking a series of calming breaths. Salazar, what was the point of observing a healthy diet when simply occupying the same room as Harry Potter was enough to give him hypertension.</p></div>
