    <p> </p><p> </p><p>The walls of the little house on Spinner’s End seem to close in around the frail boy. His panic rises and rises until it feels like he’ll never make it to the front door. His wand is lost to him--he’d dropped it but was too petrified to try and double back—and his luck grows worse by the minute.</p><p>The boy’s hands and trousers are smeared with blood, as he’d slipped up in the liquid while darting down the staircase. He tries not to think too hard about where the blood had come from as he grabs the nearest door frame and swings into the kitchenette. He slides across the tiled floor when his bare feet smack down into another wet substance—not blood, but he doesn’t want to think too hard about that, either. Bony knees strike the floor and throb in pain, but the boy, Severus, does not stop in his frantic scramble for the door leading out of the house. It’s right there--just within arm’s reach, clunky doorknob and everything, but Severus’ focus zeroes in on the noises coming from behind him.</p><p>Joints popping and jaw clicking, with a heavy footfall that seems slow and deliberate. Severus’ long hair sticks to his sweaty face. His teeth chatter, and his hand trembles so hard that he doesn’t even have to turn his wrist in order to undo the lock on the door.</p><p>Severus can hear new drops of liquid hitting the surface of the kitchen table. One of the chairs sounds deafening when it’s tilted back and dragged across the cracked tile with no polite intentions. If Severus dies now, the least he can say is that he tried to leave. He swallows hard and clasps the doorknob firmly—as soon as he touches it, the room goes still, and the noises behind him stop.</p><p>If Severus closes his eyes, he can pretend that this stretch of silence means that this has all been a bad dream. If he waits for the seconds to crawl by, he can pretend that he’s no longer in any danger. His heart skips a beat when he feels the doorknob successfully move. The door opens just a tad, and it gives him a false sense of security.</p><p>“Your legs will give out eventually.” Says the voice behind him.</p><p>Severus steels himself and walks out into the night air.</p><p> </p><p align="center"> -Present Day-</p><p> </p><p>Harry’s jaw is set with dissatisfaction when he appears at the top of a green hill in the middle of nowhere. The area is littered with dipping dirt trails and sloping terrain; white flowers litter the fields, and the breeze makes them all shift in unison. Low mountains can be seen in the distance, but they’re so far away that they’re only a faded purple. If he were here under any other circumstances, Harry supposes that he’d really enjoy the view. Unfortunately, he can only muster a buzzing frustration in light of recent events.</p><p>--</p><p>“Snape?” Harry asked, his voice carrying a bit of indulgence. He’d thought it was Remus pulling his leg, and despite everything, it was funny. Remus rubbed at the back of his neck, pointedly not making eye contact with Harry for a moment. The two had been seated on a bench in an empty muggle park—it vaguely reminded Harry of when he first met Sirius, albeit his godfather had been a grumpy-looking dog at the time.</p><p>“I’m not quite joking, Harry,” Remus said with trepidation. “Not everybody in the Order is happy about it, but Dumbledore says—“</p><p>Harry looked somewhat betrayed at that. Of course there was no room for an argument if Dumbledore had been the one to approach Remus with the subject. Remus clears his throat and tries again.</p><p>“Dumbledore says that Snape has a private bit of land. Heavily warded, secluded. I like to think that you’d be safe there—“</p><p>“Safe, so long as I’m miserable, stuck there with him!” Harry protested, his brow set in a heavy crease. “You may as well stick me with Vernon again.” Remus tried not to sigh but he did rub at the bridge of his nose. He was exhausted, and the dark circles under his eyes told Harry that he hadn’t slept in days. The look on Lupin’s face made Harry second guess his own whining, but he still felt that he wasn’t being treated fairly.</p><p>“We’ve talked about this, Harry,” Remus said gently, trying not to rouse the boy’s temper. The days without Sirius left the two of them in a tense position; they shared in their mourning, but certain topics left them both snippy. “We don’t have many options at the moment. Everything the Order suggests is flawed somehow, and there are too many damned loopholes.” Lupin tilted his head back and stared tiredly at the nearest apartment complex. “For Snape to suggest something like this…I want you to know how high our stakes are.”</p><p>Harry made a face. Snape had suggested the move to his property? He was pretty sure that he could imagine the reluctance and distaste involved. The professor probably had to keep from gagging when he spoke to Dumbledore about it.</p><p>Harry adjusted his glasses and stared down at the band-aid on the back of his hand. What he wouldn’t give to be a Weasley for the Summer. He’d rather stay at Hogwarts, or be with Hermione, or…be anywhere other than where Lupin was telling him to go. It was then that Lupin placed a hand on his shoulder.</p><p>“…It’s just for the holiday…if we think of another solution, I’ll take you elsewhere as soon as possible. I promise.” Harry felt his eyes sting again. Lupin’s mouth quirked. “Think of it this way; I’m sure he can’t kick out if you decide to put salt in his sugar pots.”</p><p>Harry smiled a little.</p><p>--</p><p>Now, Harry finds himself catching sight of a building as he makes his way down a barely-used path. Dumbledore sent him here; Harry can’t apparate, and Snape seems paranoid about Order members (or anyone, really) finding out about this place. Hedwig shakes her head a bit from where she rests in her cage, and Harry likes to think that her movement is one of disapproval.</p><p>“If he gives us any chores, I suppose they can’t be much worse than what Aunt Petunia gave us, right?” Harry asks his owl. At least one thing won’t change; Hedwig will be his only companion throughout the isolating Summer months.</p><p>Once Harry arrives on the property, he gets the full picture, but it’s nothing he would’ve otherwise associated with the Potions Master. The property as a whole has no clear shape; its perimeter is marked with loose, wooden fencing. ‘Farm’ is the first word that comes to mind, and it leaves Harry wondering if Dumbledore even sent him to the right location. There is a building that is no doubt a barn, albeit it isn’t but so large, and it isn’t painted red. The dark wood is fractured in some areas, and the roof has seen better days, though the structure as a whole doesn’t seem to be in danger of collapsing anytime soon. To Harry’s far right, there is another small building, and its fenced-in yard includes a handful of chattering hens and a couple of ducks.</p><p>Farther back behind the chickens’ area, there seems to be a shed, but it’s compact and otherwise not worthy of observation. Throughout the main yard, there aren’t any stepping stones or decorations. The patchy grass almost makes Harry snort, as he doesn’t think Snape’s done many outdoor activities in his lifetime.</p><p>Harry has only seen Snape in black robes for the past five years; one wouldn’t assume that he could tolerate dirt on his cloaks and shoes, but maybe he uses spells to keep the dust from kicking up onto his trousers. Despite Snape’s hair, his classroom and mannerisms always made Harry think he was somewhat of an organizational nut, hell-bent on maintaining the pretentious air that many Slytherins seem to have.</p><p>Harry’s feet carry him forward and he finally takes in the main house—the one that he’s supposed to stay in from now on. It’s…rustic, to say the least. Harry’s never seen a building like this in person; most of the structures back home consisted of more brick and stone. The house isn’t large, but it isn’t small, either; there are two floors and a front porch. Harry feels less claustrophobic than he did moments ago, considering he thought that he’d be in a cramped space with Snape for days on end. Now he wonders if he’ll even have to run into his professor much at all. Maybe he can just stay in certain rooms and avoid talking to him altogether, and Snape would probably appreciate that, too.</p><p>There are three small steps leading up onto the porch, and a black cat sits at the bottom of them, eyeing Harry before narrowing her eyes at Hedwig. There’s no hissing involved; however, so Harry isn’t too concerned about that potential relationship at the moment.</p><p>“Right on time. I wasn’t expecting as much.”</p><p>Harry braces himself and looks up at the front door. Snape is standing there, glowering (as he is wont to do) and he looks no different from usual. Harry was at least expecting a different type of cloak due to the new setting, but his sour professor can’t even grant him that much. His wardrobe is just another reminder of how uptight and intolerant Snape is—a reminder of how Harry’s going to have to deal with the same old nonsense from him despite his recent traumas.</p><p>“Professor,” Harry greets. The least he can do is try and be reasonable. He’s not sure that starting off day one with an attitude will win him any favors. Then again, Snape doesn’t seem to like a kiss-ass, either.</p><p>Snape’s lip quirks slightly, and Harry can’t tell if it’s harsh amusement or general indifference.</p><p>“If you’re expecting me to wait on you hand and foot this season, you’re in for disappointment.” Snape’s low cadence makes Harry frown. Snape doesn’t expect Harry to reply to him, he just jerks his head slightly, urging Harry to follow him inside.</p><p>“You’ll be staying upstairs. There is a guest room to the right, around the bannister, at the end of the row. The kitchen is here.” Snape vaguely gestures to the left. “I don’t care when you eat, but I do care if you don’t clean up after yourself; I’m not your maid.” Harry wants to take in the layout of the bottom floor, but he’s scared of missing something as Snape narrates with a bored tone, like he’s reading from a script.</p><p>“I won’t always be here; when I’m not keeping children from blowing themselves up, I’m developing research. There may be times when I am gone for several days, and there will be chores that I expect even you can accomplish. You are to finish all of them. I’ve a lab in the basement, and should you even <em>think</em> about sneaking in or grabbing something from my stores, I will send you back to your relatives so quickly that your head will <em>spin</em>.” Snape adds with some venom, turning on his heel in order to glare down at Harry. Harry says nothing, but his grip on his suitcase tightens a bit.</p><p>“Yes, there are animals on the property. No, I’d rather you didn’t enter the barn at all. Starting tomorrow, you’ll never be short on work—school-related or otherwise. Don’t make your stay here <em>inconvenient</em> for me. Your insufferable Headmaster seems to think that this is what’s <em>best</em>.” Snape finishes with a mocking tone, letting Harry know just what he thinks of Dumbledore’s approval. Harry isn’t one to argue with Dumbledore, but this time, he can’t help but share Snape’s inclination. He just barely considers wanting to find out what Professor Trelawney gets up to during vacation instead.</p><p>Snape begins to stalk down the hall leading behind the staircase, and Harry wants to kick himself for opening his mouth, but he’d rather not get yelled at later for something he wasn’t informed of.</p><p>“Professor?” Harry calls out, shifting his weight from foot to foot. The old rug beneath him translates no noise to the wooden floorboards. Snape pauses and already seems irritated, but he indulges and turns slightly.</p><p>“Can Hedwig fly?”</p><p>Snape raises an eyebrow. “Is she not an owl?” His voice drips with sarcasm and Harry tries not to take the obvious bait.</p><p>“I just…can I send letters?” Harry’s voice loses a bit of volume. He still isn’t sure what Snape reacts worse to, even after all of their occlumency training—showing backbone or showing hesitation.</p><p>Snape is silent for a moment, and Harry can practically see his professor determining whether or not to reply with a certain amount of condescension. Finally, Snape thankfully settles on an ‘I couldn’t care less’ tone.</p><p>“There is an outer ward that your owl cannot breach. She can be loose on the property but cannot leave it.” A pause. “Regardless, every Death Eater in the country knows what your owl looks like. No letters.”</p><p>Snape dismisses himself, and Harry looks down at Hedwig with a sigh.</p><p>“Wonderful.”</p>
