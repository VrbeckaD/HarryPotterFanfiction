    <p>               Once upon a time, Harry had to serve detention in the Forbidden Forest with Hermione, Malfoy, and Neville. Hagrid, who had just finished a whole keg of West Indian Moonshine, explained their mission.</p><p>               “Eh, summat’s been killin’ dem unicorns in der,” he began, “so we’s a gonna have a looksie, seen? True bredren, dat.”</p><p>               The three of them pretended to understand, and fell in line behind the big oaf. Soon they came to a fork, where a centaur was waiting for them.</p><p>               “Eh, Ronan, me bredren, you seen dat real bad man in ‘ere? I gonna put a bomba blood clot in him, seen?”</p><p>               Ronan stood still for a moment, eyes comically dilated. Then he chortled, grasping at flies that weren’t really there.</p><p>               Hagrid said, “Man, he’s real chill, eh? You two, go dat away wit Fang. Me, I and I is goin’ dat away wit dese two, seen?” And off they went.</p><p>               Malfoy said to Harry, “I heard there are werewolves in here. You can have point.”</p><p>               Harry frowned and argued, “But I have less wizarding experience than you! <em>You</em> take point!”</p><p>               Malfoy grimaced, unable to argue with that logic, and then said, “Fine, let’s have Fang go in front. <em>He’s</em> expendable.” But Fang just sat there licking his own butt. He did not inspire confidence.</p><p>               Just then, Harry noticed something in the bushes. “Hey, what’s that silvery white stuff?” They went in for a closer look.</p><p>               Malfoy snickered, for no apparent reason. “I think it’s unicorn blood. At least, it’s not supposed to be red.”</p><p>               Harry agreed. “We must be close by. It’s a shame that the others left. Hey, where’s Ronan?”</p><p>               The boys looked around. Vaguely, in the gloom, they could sort of make out a silhouette. As Ronan was lost in visions of Popocatepetl Chili, he plowed face first into a tree.</p><p>               Suddenly, they heard an evil slithering from up above. Stunned, they raised their eyes to the forest canopy; Fang peed on a rock.</p><p>               Suspended overhead by ropes was the unicorn in question, very much alive. Hanging from it upside down was a figure in black robes. Its face was hooded and covered, and it leaned in towards the unicorn’s…</p><p>               Malfoy asked, “Since when do unicorns have elephant trunks?” while Harry screamed in horror, <em>“It isn’t blood!!!”</em></p><p>               Harry was scarred for life.</p>
