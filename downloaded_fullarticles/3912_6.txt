"Yes, prongy my boy?" Sirius asked, scratching his armchair.<br/>
"Last night, by the forbidden forest... What were you burying?" James asked.<br/>
"NOTHING! I WASNT BURYING ANYTHING! I RESENT THE INSINUATION!" Sirius said quickly, after he had recovered falling of his chair. Remus looked up from his book curiously. Peter flicked his eyes between the two of them.<br/>
“What did you do, Sirius?” James voice became suspicious.<br/>
“Nothin’…” Sirius hunched in his chair, very obviously guilty.  James stood up, walking slowly backwards to the door. Remus stood up too, following James. Sirius watched them both, before comprehension dawned on his face. But it was too late.<br/>
Remus and James dashed out the portrait hole. Sirius sprinted after them, Peter following suit.<br/>
“James, Stop!” Sirius shouted, but James kept running. The Entrance doors were flung open and the Marauders disappeared into the night.<br/>

The stag charged down the dog, and both transformed back, in a scuffle over the pile of dirt. Remus joined in, if only to try and pry them apart. No-one saw Peter digging.<br/>
Peter dug out the hole and stared at the buried things. He let out a squeak, which James heard, and James leaped over to the hole, Sirius clinging to his leg and yelling “NO!”. James peered into the hole and froze.<br/>
“That’s what this is about? Come on, Padfoot! I thought it would be interesting!” James whined. Sirius bolted as Remus walked over to the hole, yelling “Sorry, Moony!”<br/>
Remus peered in.<br/>
“It is interesting, James,” he declared. “Those are MY socks,”</p></div>
