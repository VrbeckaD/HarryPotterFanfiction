  <em>
    <span>There is a black-haired violet-eyed boy slouching down on a chair and shuffling through papers. He glances up and blinks.Then he straightens up.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Violet-eyed boy: Hello there everyone! My name is Alan and I’m here with my younger brothers to give you a disclaimer because our lazy author doesn’t want to do it every single chapter.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>He turns his head and calls off screen.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Alan: Yo! Alex! Adrian! Y’all need to come over here!</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>From off screen two black-haired boys come onto the screen. One boy has Killing-Curse Green eyes while the other has Ocean Blue eyes.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Green-eyed boy: (</span>
  <em>
    <span>snaps</span>
  </em>
  <span>) We were coming Al. Screaming was completely unnecessary.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Alan: (</span>
  <em>
    <span>huffs</span>
  </em>
  <span>) Well how was I supposed to know that? Magic?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Silence.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Green-eyed boy: Yes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>The blue-eyed boy sighed. He had a feeling that making the disclaimer for their lazy author would be much longer than necessary.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Blue-eyed boy: Hello everyone. My name is Adrian and, well, Alan already introduced himself so all that’s left is my other older brother. (</span>
  <em>
    <span>Points to the green-eyed boy</span>
  </em>
  <span>) That boy is our brother Alexander. Alan and I call him Alex for short but for your own safety I am recommending that unless he gives you permission to call him that not to call him Alex. He’s already sent 32 people to the hospital for that and is more than prepared to send the hospital some more.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Alexander: (</span>
  <em>
    <span>with no bite in his tone</span>
  </em>
  <span>) Thank you for that marvelous introduction Adrian. Is there anything else that you want to say?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Adrian: (</span>
  <em>
    <span>frowns</span>
  </em>
  <span>) Uuuummm…..I don’t think so…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Alan opens his mouth to say something.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Alexander: (</span>
  <em>
    <span>Without looking at him</span>
  </em>
  <span>) Not you Alan. Remember: </span>
  <em>
    <span>The Incident</span>
  </em>
  <span>.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Alan looks offended at first. Then he snaps his mouth shut and keeps quiet. There is a tinge of red on his cheeks.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Alexander: Anyways are we done here? I was in the middle of my project before that dunderhead of an author of ours forced us to come here and I would like to get back to it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Alan: Our bloody author wants us to give the readers a disclaimer that lasts throughout the whole story ‘cause, you know, no need to do it every chapter.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Alexander: (</span>
  <em>
    <span>irritated</span>
  </em>
  <span>) Excuse me? Why the bloody hell do you have to give a disclaimer every chapter? If you found the story it already says “</span>
  <em>
    <span>Harry Potter”</span>
  </em>
  <span> on it! All you need to do is search up Harry Potter and you will find a perfectly reasonable explanation of what’s going on! If you don’t know about Harry Potter then why are they here?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Alan: Well….because….actually..you know what..I don’t know….</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Alexander: (</span>
  <em>
    <span>incensed</span>
  </em>
  <span>) This is completely unnecessary! My time is being wasted here and I don’t want to waste another second of it!</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Alexander turns sharply on his heel and tries to open the door.The door won’t open. A paper suddenly appears on the door. Alexander picks up the paper.</span>

</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Alexander: (</span>
  <em>
    <span>reads aloud</span>

  <span>) </span>
  <b>You need to do the disclaimer properly otherwise you won’t be able to leave.</b>
  <span> (</span>
  <em>
    <span>furious and snarls</span>
  </em>
  <span>) </span>
  <em>
    <span>Excuse me?!?</span>
  </em>
  <span> Who the fuck does that ignorant, disrespectful, self-righteous little brat think that she is?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Adrian: Uh, Alex, she’s our author..</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Alexander: (</span>
  <em>
    <span>still furious</span>
  </em>
  <span>) She’s keeping me from saving Soraya! I’m trying to make a potion that will cure cancer and if Soraya dies because of her I’m going to make this story utterly miserable for her!</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Alan and Adrian share a glance. Normally such a threat would be amusing and completely impossible, but their brother had done several things that were supposed to be impossible before so…</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Alexander: (</span>
  <em>
    <span>after calming himself down</span>
  </em>
  <span>) Alan was there a script that she gave to to read for the disclaimer?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Alan: Yes. (</span>
  <em>
    <span>holds up the paper</span>
  </em>
  <span>) This.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Alexander: (</span>
  <em>
    <span>reads it</span>
  </em>
  <span>) What did we do to have her as an author?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Adrian: (</span>
  <em>
    <span>hesitates</span>
  </em>
  <span>) Is that a good thing or a bad thing?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Alexander shoots Adrian a look and neither Adrian nor Alan can tell what it means.</span>

</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Alexander: (</span>

  <b>This disclaimer is for selfish purposes only. I have no reason nor any immediate desire to say what I don’t own in every single chapter.</b>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Alexander: </span>
  <b>So I will say it once now. I don’t own Harry Potter and, unfortunately, I never will.</b>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Adrian: </span>
  <b>If you don’t know what I own and don’t own read the Harry Potter series. Thank you for reading this disclaimer.</b>

  <span>Alexander: We’re done!</span>

  <em>
    <span>Alexander runs to the door and tries to open it. It opens. Alexander doesn’t hesitate to go through it, leaving Alan and Adrian smiling in amusement and fondness in his wake.</span>

</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Adrian: Should we go?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Alan: (</span>

  <span>) Yup. (</span>
