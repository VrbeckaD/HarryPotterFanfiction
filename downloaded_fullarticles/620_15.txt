Down in the countryside of France, amidst the rolling hills and the wheat farms, was a girl, no older than ten, with long light brown hair and sparkly forest green eyes. She was wearing a plain pink summer dress and tall leather boots for she was out in the fields where there was mud. The bottom of her dress had a line of mud already and the girl wasn’t looking forward to going back home because her mother would not be happy. </p><p>Looking around behind the big oak trees at the edge, she frowned. The girl turned away and dramatically stomped her feet a few times, pretending to walk away. A sigh of relief was heard within the forest, along with footsteps, and she spun around, throwing her arms in the air with a loud, “Yes!”</p><p>There was a boy standing there with short blonde hair and bright ocean blue eyes, wearing a blue plaid shirt and brown pants, complete with leather boots on his feet. As soon as the boy was spotted by the girl, her hair changed into the same shade as his hair and her eyes were the same colour blue. The boy, instead of shocked, pulled the girl into the forest where they were hidden and hit her on the arm.</p><p>“Êtes-vous un idiot?” <i>‘Are you an idiot?’</i> The boy hissed, “Que faire si quelqu'un vous avait vu?” <i>‘What if someone saw you?’</i></p><p>The girl was not phased at all by the boy’s anger, just rolled her eyes at him, “C'est bien, Draco. Ci, personne ne croit en la magie, de toute façon..” <i>‘It’s fine, Draco. No one is nearby, anyway.’</i></p><p>It was true what she said, no one, other than them, had come here in years. Although the forest was public to everyone, people were wary of what hid in the shadows. Not only were there dangerous magical creatures living within the forest but the closet building to it was a large manor. The girl and the boy lived in this manor, along with their parents and multiple house elves and a few horses and one peacock their father bought by accident. In the town close by, there were purebloods, half-bloods and muggle-borns but anyone with common sense would know that their family was not good. They seemed like a normal family but their parents and ancestors past was too dark and so the children were assumed dark as well when in fact, they believed none of that purebloods is superior nonsense. But no one ever got close enough to figure that out.</p><p>“Voulez-vous jouer à un jeu?” <i>‘Would you like to play a game?’</i> The girl asked Draco, her hair turning ginger with mischief. His eyes narrow at her hair not impressed with the new change of colour. The girl laughs, and just on purpose, changes her hair to rainbow just to annoy her brother.</p><p>His hair turned a blood orange from frustration which made him even madder from the irony. To this day, his sister was the only one who could get a reaction out of him. Crossing his arms over his chest, the boy says, “Quel type de jeu?” <i>‘What kind of game?</i></p><p>She smirks, “Effrayée, Dray?” <i>‘Scared, Dray?’</i></p><p>“Vous le souhaitez, je suis juste un peu inquiet,” <i>‘You wish, I was just a little worried.’</i> Draco replies, “Et j'ai pensé que je vous ai dit de ne pas m'appelez.” <i>‘And I thought I told you not to call me that.’</i> </p><p>“Alors tu dois arrêter de m'appeler par mon nom complet. Cassiopeia est beaucoup trop longue.” <i>‘Then you have to stop calling me by my full name. Cassiopeia is way too long.’</i> The girl, Cassiopeia, responds. </p><p>Draco rolls his eyes but Cassi continues, “Et le jeu auquel nous jouons est…” <i>‘And the game we’re playing is…’</i> She leans in close and smacks her brother on the arm, “balise!” <i>‘tag!’</i></p><p>Cursing, the boy watches as his sister darts off out of the forest and across the field. He sprints off after her, his boots spraying dirt when they land on the ground from the speed he is going at. The girl is sadly not as fast as she thought and before she even can do anything, she is tackled to the ground by her brother, covering her dress in even more dirt.</p><p>The two lay on the grass, panting but laughing, enjoying their life as kids even though this was only a fraction of their childhood, the rest full of manners and punishments. It was nice, just them two and no one else but Cassiopeia knew they would be separated soon. Their mother wanted to send her brother off to Hogwarts, the British wizarding school, while she was expected to join Beauxtrons, the French wizarding school. She would not get to see Draco at all throughout the year, other than winter holidays and summer. She did not know how she could be apart from him that long and for eight whole years since Beauxtrons went for an extra year than Hogwarts. </p><p>“Je suis inquiet, Draco, parce que vous serez envoyé à l'école en Angleterre pendant que je reste en France. Ce qui va nous arriver?” <i>‘I'm worried, Draco, because you'll be sent to school in England while I stay in France. What's gonna happen to us?’</i> Cassiopeia speaks, knowing keeping her worries to herself will cause more problems later on. </p><p>He sighs, looking over to her, “Je ne sais pas, mais nous allons envoyer des lettres à l'autre. Peut-être que nous pouvons même persuader mère et père de vous envoyer à Poudlard aussi avant que nos lettres viennent! Ensuite, nous n'aurons pas à s'inquiéter.” ‘<i>I don't know, but we're gonna send letters to each other. Maybe we can even persuade mother and father to send you to Hogwarts before our letters come! Then we won't have to worry.'</i> Draco suggests, positively. </p><p>Cassi shrugs, “Je suppose, mais nos lettres arrivent bientôt. Nous sommes déjà en mai et notre onzième anniversaire est le 20 et 21 Juin.” <i>‘I guess, but our letters are coming soon. It’s already May and our eleventh birthday is June 20 and 21.’</i></p><p>It was a tradition in the wizarding world for when a child turns eleven, they would receive a letter from a wizarding school. Sometimes it depended on what country you lived in or if you had applied beforehand for what school accepted you. Their father had first wanted to send them to the wizarding school, Drumstrang, in Russia because their father knew the headmaster. Luckily, their mother did not want her children that far away from her but now they were being sent to different schools. They could never win. </p><p>This was on purpose of course because their father did not want the world to know he had a daughter for personal reasons. Having an only child was respected and even having more children was fine but twins were bad luck. It was also the reason that their father did not think females should have equal rights but should take care of the children and cook and clean. That’s why their mother did not get her dream job, to be a herbologist because she was supposed to learn to be the perfect wife and herbology was a laughed-open subject, their mother would never have gotten permission to pursue it. </p><p>But Cassiopeia had been planning a big speech to tell her father. </p><p>She was not going to back down now when she was so close to being free of not having to control her emotions and pretend to be the cold, perfect daughter. She could finally be a kid again with her brother. The only thing in between her and her dream was her father and just because she happened to be related to him, that was not going to stop her. She had waited much too long for this. </p><p>So, Cassi sits up from the grass abruptly making her brother frown, confused. She grins and using her limited English, she says, “ I have a plan.” </p><p>And then she spills it all, the speech and the reaction their father would have and the end result, both of them together. The girl expects her brother to say no, he is still thinking that their father is great. But perhaps she is rubbing off on him because he smirks back at her. He sits up on his elbows and opens his mouth.</p><p>“Let’s do it.”</p>
