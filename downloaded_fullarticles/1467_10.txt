    <p>I began writing the works of this series in 2015. That April,a friend and I had a mental exercise as to 'what if James and Lily Potter had lived'. This is the result of that.</p><p>This series is inspired by AidanChase's Everybody Lives AU and Animegirl300's putative Lionheart series, and I owe my inspiration to both of these wonderful authors. It involves five narrative arcs. The first involves the Marauders Era. The second is the first war against Voldemort. The third is Harry's childhood. The fourth is Harry's time at Hogwarts. And the fifth and final arc is the next generation. The story titles will be listed in the overall series description.</p><p>This series is also being posted on AO3 and Alternate History,but this is the definitive edition. There will be worldbuilding,and the effects of PODs (Points of Divergence) will be explored.</p><p>By arc,the PODs are:</p><p>Arc 1</p><p>Snape and the Marauders are in more of a 'friendly rivalry'</p><p>Arc 2</p><p>Regulus,Peter,and Severus pretend to become Death Eaters:they are really double agents,spying on the DEs for the Order of the Phoenix</p><p>Regulus doesn't die at the Horcrux cave</p><p>Fabian and Gideon Prewett successfully evade the Death Eaters sent to kill them</p><p>In a similar vein,Caradoc Dearborn and Marlene McKinnon don't die. They get married after the war.</p><p>Benjy Fenwick also lives</p><p>When Voldemort comes to Godric's Hollow, Peter AKs him while James duels with some Death Eaters. Thus,James and Lily live in addition to Harry. Peter loses some of his magic,and Harry is still marked by Voldemort.</p><p>At the same time,Aurors rescue Frank and Alice Longbottom just as they are starting to be Crucioed. Rastaban and Rodolphus are killed, Bellatrix and Barty Jr still go to Azkaban.</p><p>Arc 3</p><p>Sirius marries Amelia Bones</p><p>Harry has the childhood he deserved</p><p>Arc 4</p><p>Theodore Nott gets sorted into Ravenclaw</p><p>Only the 'Voldemort half' of Quirrell dies</p><p>Ginny is less affected by the diary:for example,she doesn’t kill Hagrid’s chickens</p><p>Penelope Clearwater does not get Petrified</p><p>Dumbledore modifies Ron's Memory Charm, erasing only Lockhart's memories of the 1992-1993 school year</p><p>The 'Prisoner of Azkaban' is an OC cousin of Sirius and Regulus</p><p>During the time travel to stop Buckbeak's execution, Remus has Macnair sent through the Veil</p><p>Somewhat different Quidditch World Cup (haven't thought of the differences yet)</p><p>The Quidditch Cup isn't held due to the TwT, but Quidditch is still played</p><p>Cedric doesn't die at Little Hangleton, but Barty Jr does</p><p>Umbridge is more successfully quashed</p><p>Benjy Fenwick is pushed through the Veil instead of Sirius. The Carrow twins are also pushed through the Veil,after which Sirius destroys it with Fiendfyre.</p><p>Lee Jordan ends up being cursed by the necklace instead of Katie</p><p>Dumbledore's Army is reformed one year early</p><p>Grindelwald shows up at Hogwarts searching for the Elder Wand. Snape kills him instead of Dumbledore.</p><p>Battle of Nine Potters. Dedalus Diggle is killed instead of Moody.</p><p>There’s no such thing as a Taboo curse</p><p>Regulus is captured in the Trio's place. The Trio successfully rescues him from Malfoy Manor,but Dobby isn't killed (but which see)</p><p>Fred,Lupin,Tonks,and many others survive the Battle of Hogwarts,but Moody and Dobby are killed</p><p>Arc 5</p><p>All of the Trio go back to Hogwarts for their eighth year</p><p>Different names for some of the next generation</p><p> </p>
