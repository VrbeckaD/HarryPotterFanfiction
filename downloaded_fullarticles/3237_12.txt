    <p>When the betrothal of Louis IX, King of France to Lady Margaret of Provence is announced, it’s considered a relief to those in Ferdinand’s Court. Louis’s mother Blanche, an<em> infanta</em> of Castile, has performed well enough in politics of late that many nobles feared she would turn her attention back to the land of her birth and contest her cousin’s rule. Or worse in their eyes—reject her son’s birthright and continue to rule the Kingdom of France on her own.</p><p>Salazar thinks they’re all being ridiculous. It isn’t the Queen of France’s politics they fear, but the woman herself, proven to be both intelligent and powerful.</p><p><em>Estefania, you would be committing acts of murder by no</em>w, he thinks in distant grief. Even her three-times-removed great-grandson, Salazar’s grandnephew, has fallen for the nonsense that was just beginning to plague non-magical circles nearly two hundred-fifty years ago. Salazar is reassured by the actions of Diego’s wife Genoveva, who is very good at playing the role of dutiful spouse in public, but rules their House when at home in Burgos.</p><p>Neither of his sister’s descendants know who Salazar is. They weren’t even informed why his presence was needed to oversee Diego’s private ascension as Magical Marqués of Burgos.</p><p>Salazar would much prefer that <em>not</em> be necessary, but he still lives, and the magic of the land and crown insists that Salazar still holds the title he was granted at age twelve. He must always declare who has the right to act in his stead before the new Magical Marqués can do so. Not even the change of the title narrowing in scope from the whole of Castile to Burgos released Salazar from that responsibility. He supposes nothing will unless he were to swear allegiance to another throne—and given some of what he knows of the strife to come, he’d really rather not.</p><p>Ferdinand III knows why, and he despises Salazar for it. Salazar would not be lingering in Court if it were not for the fact that his presence enrages his king. In Ferdinand’s eyes, and in the eyes of many rulers who have held Castile or León (or both) through the long years, a man who cannot die is an affront to their God and his Son. It makes Salazar long for Queen Berenguela, who is sensible enough to realize that if her God hasn’t struck him dead, then of course there must be a reason why he lingers.</p><p>If Salazar cannot have understanding, then he’ll settle for being the reason why a ruler grinds his teeth through every gathering of his Court. He already plans to move on when the summer military campaigns begin. It would be pleasing to see Iberia united again, but the cost—that, Salazar does not approve of. He doesn’t want to witness something he cannot stop.</p><p>Ferdinand’s summons ruins that plan. Salazar wonders what is driving the king to request his presence when it is nearing midnight.</p><p>“You know that the marriage of Marie to Baldwin will occur this summer,” Ferdinand says without any hint of hospitality at all.</p><p>“I’m aware. I’d planned to attend.”</p><p>Ferdinand gives him a narrow-eyed look. “No. You will attend to the royal wedding in France as my appointed magical representative.”</p><p>“That, Your Majesty, is <em>not</em> my role in this Court. That is the role of your Alférez, or one of your recognized magical nobles.” Those with magic are known only to the king, though Blanche would also recognize their political value. Salazar is no longer aware of who is or is not magical in the north of Iberia any longer, and he often prefers it that way.</p><p>“Your role in my Court is most unwanted, Salazar Fernan.” Ferdinand stares at him, but Salazar is not the one who looks away first. “The Magical Alférez must remain here for the campaigns that will reclaim the whole of our lands from heretics.”</p><p>Salazar manages not to roll his eyes, but only just. “Of course they must. I am still already indisposed—”</p><p>“The Kingdom of France must <em>not</em> let itself lose what Christian magicians they have due to fear!” Ferdinand interrupts him. “Too few remain as it is. The Crusades take our young men in droves. There must be those left behind who can defend their realm if the tide ever turns.”</p><p>Salazar thinks about reminding this idiot that he is not Christian, and therefore not the best choice, but decides not to. Ferdinand already wishes to be rid of him, and Salazar has no desire to discover what it’s like to burn to death without the mercy of dying afterwards. “Fine. Then I will attend to both.”</p><p>Ferdinand sighs. “You will not. You will not interfere in my family’s affairs any more than you have already done.”</p><p>“Don’t insult your mother, you young idiot,” Salazar retorts. Not when Berenguela travels on Ferdinand’s behalf to gain support for her son’s campaigns of reunification. “I promised her that I would see to her namesake’s affairs, and that includes the marriage of your niece to the future Emperor of Constantinople.”</p><p>“My half-niece,” Ferdinand corrects in an icy voice. “And your fathering of her is exactly why you will stay away. You are ill fortune that will not taint her marriage.”</p><p>“You say that as if I am Death Incarnate,” Salazar says, trying to decide if he is amused or outraged. Then again, there is no reason why he cannot be both. It won’t be the first time that old magical oaths meant he had to obey the words of a complete idiot.</p><p>“You cannot die. Mother might consider you blessed, but men are wise and know better.”</p><p>Salazar glances up at the ceiling. “Please cease to insult a woman who is your strongest ally. I have no wish to assassinate another monarch when this century is still so young. Or do you forget that while you cannot get rid of me, I can most certainly rid the world of you?”</p><p>Ferdinand smiles, a cold expression that Salazar would rather see on the man’s corpse. “I have not forgotten. That is why the Crown of Castile and León to which you are pledged is ordering you to attend to the betrothed couple in France from the beginning of March until Death takes me to the gates that reveal the Kingdom of Heaven. Only then you will be released from that instruction. The one exception granted you to temporarily depart France before that time is if you are needed to oversee the confirmation of Diego’s Heir as Magical Marqués of Burgos.”</p><p>Salazar regards his king, feeling the prickling magic beneath Ferdinand’s words. “Your Majesty, I truly, utterly loathe you, and hope you die a horrific death.”</p><p>“Marqués, trust me when I say that I feel similarly about you.”</p><p> </p><p align="center">*          *          *          *</p><p> </p><p>Salazar is not the idiot that his king would likely prefer him to be. He knows how to keep and maintain allies. The Queen of France, Blanche of Castile, is glad to see him again, welcoming him into the French Court by naming him a trusted friend and important ranking Marqués in Ferdinand III’s kingdom. None ever seem to notice that Blanche doesn’t name the lands Salazar is supposed to rule. All her courtiers need to hear is that Salazar is in favor with their Queen and a foreign King; the rest is inconsequential. Their disappointment lies in the fact that Salazar has no sons or daughters available for the making of political alliances.</p><p><em>And that is why I do not tell anyone if I’ve fathered a child</em>, Salazar thinks, trying to stomach the company of Blanche’s supporters until he can be rid of them. Such has only happened twice since Marion’s death, but his first five children were each hounded for political alliances, as were the latter two daughters. He’ll not put another of his through that if it can be avoided.</p><p>It appears otherwise, but his youngest daughter’s marriage is political by chance. She is fortunate enough to be wed to a man who adores her. It’s Salazar’s granddaughter whom he fears for. Magical decree now keeps him from seeing to Marie’s safety, leaving him to stew in impotent fury.</p><p>“You could not have found an older match for him?” Salazar asks Blanche of the future queen. Louis IX is now nineteen, but his betrothed will only be thirteen years old when they are wed in May.</p><p>“I did try, but it is difficult of late to find someone of suitable blood who is not a relation,” Blanche replies. “If they are not a blood relative, then they’re an enemy who is in no mood to talk of marriage contracts.”</p><p>“And the fact that your son will be able to lay claim to Provença has absolutely nothing to do with your choice.”</p><p>Blanche smirks at him, a reminder that he might have had too much influence on her political education. “No, Salazar. That is merely considered sensible.”</p><p>She is more persistent now in her private attempts to learn the secret of his longevity. He has told her often that he made a deal with Death, but she never believes him. No one does.</p><p>Magicians hid their powers from others centuries ago, which safeguards them, but it had a side effect Salazar did not foresee. The knowledge of the other, of the ethereal, is disappearing from magical awareness. The non-magical have no trouble believing that there is a being called Death, but they think of him—and it is always <em>him</em>—as an angel of God, not a universal Aspect for all living things. The Church of Rome loudly insists that this world is the center of existence. If that is not the height of arrogance, especially given their religion, then Salazar has never understood the meaning of the word.</p><p>He is sensible enough to ingratiate himself to Louis and his bride before he ever mentions magic to them. Blanche knows who he is and what he is capable of, but Louis will soon rule in her place. It will be his words that decide whether or not magicians will be a welcome part of the Kingdom of France, if a secret one, or if Louis will ban them as the English did.</p><p>Salazar doesn’t want to be responsible for that, either. The magicians of France have hidden themselves away so well that the few magical nobles remaining are building a school. It is less about a need to educate the young and more a necessary means for those who remain to be able to speak to one another without fear of discovery. Maybe one day it will only serve as a school, but he still hopes the same for Hogewáþ.</p><p>He asks the young couple one question a month after their marriage, and that single question regarding magic tells Salazar everything he needs to know about the new king and queen. “Congratulations,” Salazar tells Blanche in the privacy of her personal chambers. “You’ve bound your son in marriage to a religious fanatic.”</p><p>“Piousness is a virtue, Salazar,” Blanche reminds him, pouring two goblets of wine.</p><p>“Piousness, perhaps,” he allows. “But you will have no acknowledged magical nobles remaining in your kingdom by the time Louis and Margaret’s reign is done. Those magicians will rightfully fear for their lives.”</p><p>Blanche frowns. “Louis has never spoken in such a way before.”</p><p>Salazar releases an amused snort before he accepts the second goblet. “He wasn’t in love before.”</p><p>“Love?” Blanche shakes her head. “They’ve known each other for three months. She should not hold such easy sway over my son.”</p><p>“Then you didn’t mean to place a sheep upon the throne?” Blanche’s eyes narrow, which is all the answer Salazar needs. “You did exactly that. Blanche, you will not live forever. You can’t realistically expect to rule through Louis for all of his life!”</p><p>“I would have no difficulty at all if you would but tell me what keeps you young and hale,” Blanche responds in a sweet voice.</p><p>Salazar peers into his goblet. “Terrible wine.” He smiles when she laughs, but the urge to laugh has not been with him of late.</p><p>Blanche has always been very observant. “You are troubled by something else.”</p><p>“I hope you’re not offended by my presence in France, as I may be here for a very long time.” Salazar tells her what Ferdinand did, invoking the magic of the Crown to be certain his words were obeyed.</p><p>“What did you do to anger him?” she asks.</p><p>“I exist,” Salazar says in a dry voice. “Worse, I am father to your niece, his youngest sister.”</p><p>“Of all the foolish things to be so offended by! Of course, I have always wondered if you were also—”</p><p>Salazar quickly shakes his head to keep those words from gaining further ground. “Absolutely not. Your sister Berenguela and her husband’s other children were all conceived during their marriage before the Pope rudely voided their contract. Berenguela’s namesake was conceived after she returned to Burgos.”</p><p>Blanche raises an eyebrow. “The timing was very good, then.”</p><p>“Or perhaps everyone was convinced to conveniently forget that Berenguela of Castile should have been born a full two months prior to her actual birthdate,” Salazar counters, smiling. “None of us ever thought my daughter would be considered for a political union, not after Pope Innocent destroyed the legitimacy of her named parents’ marriage.”</p><p>“And my foolish nephew Ferdinand banished you to France in order to keep you away from a niece he himself has never met.” Blanche draws Salazar into her arms. “I am sorry. I know how careful you are to watch over your family. Or in this particular instance, <em>our</em> family.”</p><p>“Thank you.” It’s getting difficult to accept another’s touch again. Nizar made him promise not to let that happen, but sometimes it’s hard to keep to that vow.</p><p>He didn’t need to think of his brother in this moment. Now he feels doubly burdened.</p><p>Blanche promises to speak to her son in the matter of magic and the kingdom’s defence. Maybe she even begins to do so, but then an assassination attempt makes it a moot point. Much later, Salazar discovers the attempt on the king’s life was made on the orders of men from Toulouse, those still dissatisfied by the Treaty of Paris signed five years previous.</p><p>In the meantime, he’s just finished killing three well-armed assassins with his wand when the new queen begins shrieking that Salazar is a demon sorcerer. The new king is shouting for his arrest.</p><p>“You cannot possibly be serious,” Salazar says in disbelief, given that the enemy is dead and these idiot royal children are alive.</p><p>Unfortunately, they are both quite serious, and also attempting to stab him. Salazar yanks his brother’s Cloak out of his pouch and hides beneath its gossamer folds. His sudden disappearance doesn’t endear him to young Queen Margaret, who now wants him found, hung, drawn and quartered, and then set on fire for good measure.</p><p>“Don’t you think that’s a bit much?” Salazar murmurs under his breath, watching from the limb of a tree as armed men search the grounds. Then he sees the fear in Margaret’s eyes and can only sigh. Sometimes he thinks the scrying that told him of what was to come, those warning glimpses of this type of fanaticism, were as much a blessing as they are a curse.</p><p>“What in God’s name did you do, sacrifice a goat, bathe in its blood, and wear its horns in front of them?” Blanche asks when Salazar can finally reach her private chambers—two days later. “It’s taken quite a bit of effort to keep them from declaring <em>war</em> against Ferdinand for his sending of a sorcerer to our kingdom! It required my oath that Ferdinand didn’t know of your abilities to calm them, and I do hope God forgives me for both the oath and the lie.”</p><p>“God will likely be pleased you saved another innocent from an unmerciful death.” Salazar bundles up the Cloak in his hands and slumps down in a chair. “I’ll have to leave your Court, even if I cannot leave this kingdom.”</p><p>“I’ll send word to Ferdinand. Surely my nephew will see reason,” Blanche says.</p><p>Salazar shakes his head. “Ferdinand probably meant for my appearance here to be seen as an insult in the first place. It would give him the means to declare a just war and lay claim to your kingdom as well as the Caliphate. Save your words for those who matter, Blanche.”</p><p>Giving in to what is politically inevitable, Blanche offers Salazar a residence far to the west of Paris, a keep built near the Sélune River when magicians were less feared. “It is no palace, but it has weathered many ocean storms and even more invading armies. It will harbor a fugitive fleeing the king’s justice quite well,” Blanche explains before she sends him off. “It belonged to my mother before the Treaty was signed. I’ll conveniently forget to mention its existence to my children.”</p><p>“Then I’m in your debt.” It’s a kinder alternative than hiding under an Invisibility Cloak until Ferdinand does Salazar the grand favor of dying.</p><p>“There would be no debt at all if you told me how to maintain myself in the same manner that preserves you.”</p><p>Salazar smiles at her. “I’ve told you the truth throughout your life. Would you prefer I start lying to you now?”</p><p>Blanche raises both eyebrows. “And if I were to ask how one gained an angel’s attention?”</p><p>“These lands still need you,” Salazar says. “I wouldn’t chance an encounter with Death in any great hurry, were I in your place.”</p><p>“Then what made <em>you</em> chance it?” Blanche asks.</p><p>“Necessity,” he replies, but that is not the entire truth.</p><p>Salazar knew already that he would succeed. Those circumstances have yet to cease being awkward.</p><p> </p><p align="center">*          *          *          *</p><p> </p><p>Salazar has forgotten Blanche’s penchant for understating a place’s importance. The moment he steps foot onto the estate in Normandy, he knows at once that it was held as a magical property until sometime in the last twenty years. The wards that keep the land hidden from non-magical eyes are only now beginning to fade. He renews them before he bothers to venture closer to the building.</p><p>It is no mere cottage, but a keep comparative in size to his home in Ipuzko. He is also sharing it with elves.</p><p>“I’d no idea you had a clan in Normandy,” Salazar says to the elf that greets him at the door. “Or that you’d taken on this sort of role.”</p><p>“The survivors of our clan, the Elves of the River Sélune, were granted sanctuary by the last magical lord to live here,” Gizzet tells him as he ushers Salazar indoors. “Queen Blanche and deceased King Louis wrote our safety into the laws of the kingdom so that we may shelter here, in this keep, in perpetuity. We need only care for the guests the royal family sends our way.”</p><p>“I imagine you will see few guests after the death of Blanche, as her son and his new bride fear magic.”</p><p>Gizzet’s ear twitches. “We have heard such, but you are welcome here, Lord Salazar. The Queen Blanche sent a hawk with a missive to warn us of your arrival. The old lord’s chambers are yours for the whole of the time you need dwell here.”</p><p>“That is very kind of you, especially as I have no idea how long that will be.” Scrying has only shown him an image of a man dying in his bed, but not enough detail to even guess at Ferdinand’s age. His king could die of wounds received in battle tomorrow, or die of old age a century from now.</p><p>The former lord’s chambers are composed of a sitting room filled with tapestries and books, padded wooden furniture, and a fireplace with a shelf above it. The fire burning in the hearth is a blessing after a journey of many miles, unable to rely on Desplazarse for lack of known landmarks. He might not be capable of dying, but he still hates the cold, and Normandy does not yet seem willing to admit that it is summer.</p><p>He pulls one of the chairs close to the hearth and sits down. The next thing he knows, another elf is shaking him awake and asking if he’d like supper, or if he’d prefer to sleep through the meal. He joins them in the kitchen, but between the heat, the comforting return of elf chatter, and the food, he sleeps through part of the evening. He’s been awake for too many days, and that sort of debt always catches up at once.</p><p>Salazar rouses by ten o’clock the next morning, fills a bath, heats the water, and proceeds to enjoy the fact that he is clean without freezing for it. By the time he’s done, the elves have absconded with all of his clothes except for his last pair of clean breeches and a shirt.</p><p>The only empty wall space in the sitting room is above the fireplace. Salazar thinks it a fitting location as he reassembles the wooden frame with practiced ease. He resets the canvas and then places the reconstructed portrait on the wall with a good sticking charm. There are other magical paintings in this keep, after all, and he won’t deny this portrait the chance to wander when the opportunity has been provided.</p><p>“And there is the man who is stuck in exile while in exile,” Nizar’s portrait greets him, looking far too happy with this state of affairs. “Where the fuck are we?”</p><p>It’s been too long since he’s spoken to the portrait; it takes him a moment to recall what the word <em>fuck</em> means. “Normandy. Queen Eleanor used to own the estate, but it was definitely run by magical hands before that time. You do not need to be so happy about this.”</p><p>The portrait snorts in amusement. “I’m seeing it as a forced period of idleness for an idiot who has forgotten the meaning of the word.”</p><p>“I have not.”</p><p>“You haven’t stopped moving or conniving since you left the school, <em>idiota</em>,” Nizar retorts. “And before you deny it, do let me remind you that being stored in a stupid pouch means that yes, I’m aware of what you’re up to all the time. You haven’t taken a rest in actual centuries. You should write a nice thank-you letter to those young royal idiots.”</p><p>“I should be thanked for the death threats, then?” Salazar asks.</p><p>“As if that has ever stopped you.”</p><p>“No. I suppose it hasn’t,” Salazar admits, sitting down on the chair he slept in yesterday afternoon.</p><p>“And now you’ve decided to be sad. Cheer up, Sal. At least this time no one shot you in the face.”</p><p>Salazar winces. “Please stop reminding me of that.” He hadn’t actually needed to know what it felt like to pry a crossbow bolt’s tip from the inside of his own skull.</p><p>He doesn’t realize Nizar hasn’t wandered off to explore when the portrait speaks again. “What is it, then?”</p><p>“I miss you.”</p><p>“How? I live in your pocket,” Nizar says.</p><p>“Oh, I rarely have the chance to miss your chatter. I meant…” Salazar hesitates. “You.”</p><p>“Ah.” Nizar gives him a searching look. “You know, you don’t actually have to stay away from Hogewáþ for a thousand years. There is nothing stopping you from returning. Well, aside from needing to wait for an idiot king to die.”</p><p>“Except for the fact that your history insists I do not return,” Salazar replies.</p><p>“Pfft. I am painted proof that history doesn’t know what it’s talking about,” Nizar says. “Besides, I’m not telling you to shout your name from the battlements. You don’t have to tell anyone. Just go back, assure yourself that things are fine, and wander off into the wild again.”</p><p>It’s such a tempting idea. Salazar would love to do exactly that…and that’s why he cannot. “I can’t chance it, Nizar, and not only for the fact that I worry I’d be unable to leave a second time. It doesn’t—it feels as if it would be a very bad idea.”</p><p>“Fair enough, but you’re only allowed one hour a day to mope like a sodden idiot. I’m not above convincing the elves in this house to drag you about in order to prevent it.”</p><p>“You know that there are elves here?” Salazar asks in surprise. “You’ve not seen them yet.”</p><p>Nizar’s portrait taps his ear. “I heard the conversation when you spoke to them yesterday, Sal. I can also hear them through the other portrait frames in the keep. Now get your arse out of that chair and go find something to do that isn’t dwelling on things you can’t change.”</p><p>“I promised her, Nizar. I don’t like breaking such a promise.”</p><p>“And I imagine Berenguela knows that it was not your fault, Sal.”</p><p>Salazar isn’t certain of that. “If I hadn’t spoken to Ferdinand that way—”</p><p>“Now you’re really reaching for excuses, aren’t you? The blowhard would have found another way to exile you from Castile, Salazar. This was just the first convenient reason.”</p>
