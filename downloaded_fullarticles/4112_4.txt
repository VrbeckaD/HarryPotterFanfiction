  <strong> <em> <u>James </u> </em> </strong>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p><em>Don’t go back. Leave them to work it out,</em> he argued with himself. <em>But they’re your best friends, and they’re about to kill each other.</em> Truthfully, he wasn’t even sure what they were fighting over, but they hadn’t spoken directly to each other in weeks. Not to mention the strain that was present anytime they were in the same room. Peter had noticed it, too. He and James had discussed it at length, working out what it was that Remus and Sirius were so furious with each other over, but there was nothing. Well, nothing that they knew of.</p><p>But it had to be something. Peter and James had spent every moment that Remus and Sirius were off hating each other trying to think up new ways to get them on speaking terms again, but nothing was helping. They’d tried going to James’ Quidditch match – Remus and Sirius sat on opposite sides of Peter, and barely even chanced looking in one another’s direction. Then, they had tried doing a prank together. That had worked out well – Remus had actually smiled in Sirius’ direction once, but as soon as he realized he was doing it, he immediately wiped it from his face.</p><p>Now, it was the morning after the full moon, and they were at it again, despite how ferociously Padfoot had protected Moony from that feral wolf they had run into the night before. In the heat of the moment, James thought it was enough to prove to them how much they meant to each other. When morning came, and they were all back to themselves, Remus quickly pulled a blanket over his naked body and sulked off into the furthest corner of the room, as the rest of them got dressed. Granted, he was usually a little standoffish after a full moon, ashamed of what he’d become, ashamed of what he would have done without the Marauders to keep him occupied.</p><p><em>I have to go back,</em> James thought. As he and Peter had made their way back to the entrance at the Willow, there had been a loud thud from within the Shack. They’d shared a nervous glance. James made Peter go on ahead, with the promise that he’d catch up. Whatever that noise had been, it wasn’t good. It sounded like someone had been shoved against the wall. With the fatigue of the full moon, he doubted Moony would have the strength to push Sirius that hard, which meant that Sirius was antagonizing Remus when he was at his weakest. James couldn’t let him do it. His feet spun in the dirt, and he went racing back down the hidden pathway to the Shrieking Shack, afraid of what he was going to see.</p><p>When he walked back into the Shack, his steps creaking the whole way, he could hear their hushed voices – he wished he had Remus’ sense of hearing. Sure, he was trying to keep the group together, and he definitely didn’t want his best friends to hate each other, but he was dying to know what exactly had happened between them. As he peered around the corner, he was surprised to see that Remus was the one with Sirius pinned to the wall, his hand wrapped tightly around Sirius’ throat, cigarette still between Sirius’ teeth.</p><p>“Remus!” James shouted, rushing toward them. Remus uncurled his fingers from around Sirius’ neck, as he yanked at the blanket around his shoulders, pulling it up around his gaunt collarbones.</p><p>Sirius swallowed hard, his eyes absolutely fixed on Remus. Remus stepped slightly away from him, but just barely – not enough that James felt that the fight was over.</p><p>“What the hell happened?” James yelled, his voice cracking under the tension. He shoved Remus’ shoulder, but Remus stood firm, standing resolutely and returning Sirius’ icy gaze.</p><p>“Nothing,” Sirius said, through gritted teeth, his sharp, white canines glinting from underneath his snarled lips. James looked back to Remus to see what was almost a smile – it was nearly cruel.</p><p>“What is going on with you two?” James exhaled heavily, pushing his unruly hair from his face.</p><p>“I can’t be in the same room with him without wanting to tear him apart,” Sirius responded, his jaw tensing, cigarette ash burning with his breath, and a short huff from Remus indicated that he felt the same.</p><p>“Why?” James asked, exasperated, the stress of the last few weeks coming to a head. “Why are you both fighting in the first place?” What seemed like a smirk suddenly appeared on Sirius’ lips, but Remus was the one to respond.</p><p>“I hate you, Sirius,” he said, spite dripping from his words, as James’ head whipped around, in shock of what had just been said. “I hate you so fucking much,” Remus repeated, pulling his lip into his teeth as he narrowed his eyes in Sirius’ direction. James was immediately taken aback – he had never heard Remus swear in the<em> entire</em> time he’d known him. Eyes wide, James turned back to Sirius, but his expression was no different.</p><p>James watched Sirius’s eyes travel across Remus’ face. Usually, the faded, pink scars that peppered Remus’ cheeks made Remus appear softer, for some reason. Not today. With the look he was giving Sirius, the scars only made him look dangerous. Sirius leaned forward, his forehead nearly pressed to Remus’, if not for James standing between them and the hot ash dangling from Sirius’ lips.</p><p>“I’d love to see just how much you hate me,” Sirius taunted, an arrogant grin on his lips.</p><p>“James, please leave,” Remus requested instantly, at James’ shock. Remus wasn’t the type for fights, he wasn’t the type to hold a grudge, he hated confrontation. What had Sirius done that had made him so outright furious? Enough to say that he hated him? Enough that he would fight him?</p><p>“No, I won’t!” James growled, squeezing his way in between the two of them, to which they both responded by widening the gap. “I don’t know what happened between you two, but you’re going to have to learn to forgive each other! I won’t lose you both over this.”</p><p>Remus sighed, wrapping the blanket further around his bare skin. “James, listen,” he began, the tone of his voice softening significantly.</p><p>“This doesn’t concern you, Prongs,” Sirius interrupted quickly. James turned to look at him, but Sirius held his shoulders, smoke curling around James’ throat. “This is between me and that … bastard there.”</p><p>“Sirius!” James balked at the way Sirius could talk about one of his best friends.  “Just … tell me what’s happened,” James pleaded, and for a moment, it seemed like Remus’ gaze toward Sirius softened, and James remembered what it was like before all of this happened. He remembered Remus helping Sirius with his stances for Defense Against the Dark Arts – their professor had been a real critic of Sirius’ ease in casting defensive spells. He remembered Sirius helping Remus with his prefect duties in the evenings – though James was sure Sirius couldn’t possibly have been much help. He remembered when they were <em>friends</em>.</p><p>“He’s ruined my life, James,” Remus said softly, looking just over his shoulder, where Sirius’ face was perched. James strained to see the expression on Sirius’ face in his peripherals but couldn’t.</p><p>“And him mine,” Sirius replied, in a near whisper.</p><p>“Then let’s fix it!” James offered, feeling very much on the verge of the end of their friendship and scrambling to save it. “We can get everything back to the way it was.”</p><p>“I don’t want it to go back to the way it was,” Remus replied immediately, his gaze still unbroken, fixated on where Sirius was standing, just behind James.</p><p>“Neither do I,” Sirius responded, his voice fading with each syllable.</p><p>“But I …” James started to argue again, and Sirius pushed him back toward the direction he came, back toward the tunnel that led him to the Weeping Willow.</p><p>“Go back to Hogwarts, Prongs,” Sirius said, and James finally got a look at his face – he had never seen Sirius’ expression look so solemn, he could swear there were tears in his grey eyes. “There’s nothing you can do.” His two friends stood, locked in an unending stare, waiting for the ceasefire to end.</p><p>“Just … promise me you’ll talk,” James begged.</p><p>“I’ll make him talk,” Remus promised, jaw clenched. Finally, James turned on his heels and headed back the way he came, praying to Merlin that this would all blow over.</p><p>  </p><p>
  <strong> <em> <u>Peter </u> </em> </strong>
</p><p> </p><p>Peter stood at the entrance to the Willow, just outside the reach of its furious branches, thrashing at him needlessly, and he wondered if he should go back. James had passed him in the passageway, looking positively ashen, mumbling something about the end of an era. Remus and Sirius had before had tiffs, but never anything this serious. It had been weeks since they last spoke to each other – Peter had been counting on his calendar. He and James had spent many waking nights trying to figure out how to get the two of them to become friends again. Nothing worked – not Quidditch, not pranks, not food fights in the Great Hall. Peter began to wonder if they could ever be friends again.</p><p>With a deep breath, he changed back into Wormtail and pressed the secret knob at the base of the Willow, heading back into the secret passage that led to the Shrieking Shack. Even if he had to get in the middle of a fist fight, he’d make them talk to each other. They were going to solve this.</p><p>He remained Wormtail as he entered the Shack, creeping silently between the cracks in the walls, heading to the room they were all last in together. He heard a slightly raised voice, but only one, and he couldn’t make out what was being said.</p><p>As he changed back into himself, and entered the doorway, he saw Sirius – just Sirius, Remus was nowhere to be seen – Peter hadn’t passed Remus in the passageway back, so where had he gone? Sirius stood alone, wrapped in Remus’ blanket, leaning against the furthest wall of the Shack. His head was thrown back against the wall, his eyes closed, cigarette between his teeth.</p><p>He let out a heavy sigh, followed by the name of his former best friend. “Remus,” he said – his voice sounded strange, sort of choked and tense, smoke dribbled from his lips.</p><p>“Remus?” Peter repeated aloud, and Sirius startled, choking on smoke, with eyes wide as he looked toward the door where Peter stood. “Is Remus here?” Peter asked, looking around.</p><p>“No,” Sirius replied shortly, and Peter began to wonder if he had made the right decision in coming back. Obviously, Sirius was broken by his falling out with Remus – why else would he remain behind in the Shack after all his friends had gone? Why else would he be speaking Remus’ name aloud in the little sunlight trickling in through the grimy Shack windows? Peter knew he had to do something – he had to fix this. He didn’t know what the problem was, but he couldn’t stand seeing Sirius like this.</p><p>“I’m just …” Sirius began. “I was thinking of a fight we had earlier.” As he finished speaking, he contorted his mouth around his smoke, as if trying to keep himself from tearing up.</p><p>“A fight?” Peter clarified.</p><p>“A terrible fight, yes,” Sirius sighed, letting his head hang. “Oh, gods.” Peter had never seen Sirius in such a disheveled, fragmented state.</p><p>“That bad?” Peter said, gritting his teeth. He had never known Remus to show anger at this capacity, enough to put his best friend on the edge of tears.</p><p>“Yes.” Sirius paused, his head falling back against the wall, eyes closed. “Oh, yes.”</p><p>“What was the fight about?” Peter prodded. He and James had been trying to work out what had happened between the two of them for weeks, looking for clues in everything they said, tracing their memories back to when exactly it was that they stopped speaking.</p><p>“Remus!” Sirius shouted, taking Peter aback. He’d shouted so abruptly that the cigarette fell from his lips. “It’s Remus’ fault.” Sirius’ voice shook, his breath falling out in staggering steps. “Why don’t you ask him?”</p><p>“Where did he go?” Pete wondered, mostly to himself.</p><p>“He’s off su … sulking,” Sirius replied, his voice catching in his throat, as he spoke.</p><p>“Maybe I should go find him.” If Sirius was this wrecked over their argument, it had to be Remus who was still angry, Remus who was not willing to make up.</p><p>“Oh, yes,” Sirius whined, his face contorted in what appeared to be pain. “Yes, yes, go find Remus,” he begged Peter, as if suddenly aware that Peter could fix this. Peter looked at him with a pitiful expression – this was a side of Sirius he was not used to seeing.</p><p>“I’ll do that. Later, Padfoot,” he said, giving him a consoling look as he went back toward the tunnel, back toward Hogwarts. He had to find Remus. He had to set things right between two of his best friends. For Sirius. For James. For the Marauders.</p><p>  </p><p>
  <strong> <em> <u>Lily </u> </em> </strong>
</p><p> </p><p>She couldn’t help but stare – and she wasn’t the only one. Every eye in the Great Hall was on him. Despite how she wasn’t surprised at this turn of events, she was surprised at the details. Sirius Black had the biggest shiner she’d ever seen – nearly the whole right side of his face was black and blue. That wasn’t even the surprising part. What surprised her was the rumor of who had put it there.</p><p>Sirius Black wasn’t exactly known for his subtleness, and it often got him into trouble. Usually a slap in the face from a girl he’d made a lewd comment about, but she hadn’t seen him with any girls lately to have warranted a wound like that. When she inquired about how he’d gotten such a nasty injury, she gasped out loud to find it was Remus Lupin who had given it to him. Weren’t they supposed to be best friends? Weren’t they half of the Marauders, the indivisible pranksters that nothing ever came between?</p><p>“Remus?” Lily wondered out loud, and Marlene nodded, responding despite her mouth full.</p><p>“That’s what I heard. Molly told me she heard from Alice who heard from Frank who heard from James that the two of them haven’t spoken in weeks.” Her head continued to bob, as Lily’s eyebrows furrowed. In <em>weeks?</em> Marlene continued to talk, and to eat. “Frank said that James caught Remus with his hand around Sirius’ throat this morning.” Lily’s mouth dropped open.</p><p>“What?” she hissed. Remus was the only one of the Marauders that she would actually say was her friend, and she had never even heard him yell. Never even seen him angry. “Are you sure?”</p><p>“That’s what I heard,” Marlene shrugged, shoving a corner of toast into her mouth. Lily looked down the Gryffindor table, where Sirius had just begun to sit, next to James. Remus (and Peter) sat across from both of them and she watched carefully to see Remus’ reaction to Sirius.</p><p>At the sound of Sirius settling down across from him, Remus lifted his eyes – not even bothering to raise his head. As his gaze caught Sirius’, Remus’ eyes narrowed, his lips tightened into a thin line, and Sirius was immediately flustered. He went to put his hand on the edge of the table to lower himself down, but slipped, nearly crashing into the table with the bottom of his chin.</p><p>It seemed like the whole room gasped – Sirius Black was <em>not </em>clumsy. He was the most frustratingly debonair person in the entire castle, and he was <em>flustered</em>? What exactly had Remus done to him to make him so nervous to be around him? Not to mention, comparatively speaking, Sirius had always been the better fighter, mostly in that Remus <em>never</em> got into fights. How could Remus have landed such a perfectly placed punch without Sirius fighting back? What had Sirius done to deserve it?</p><p> </p><p>Lily had never been more desperate to talk to James Potter.</p><p> </p><p>Just as she was letting herself get lost in the planning, devising some excuse for her to talk to James without making it seem like she was fishing for information, Remus slammed both hands down hard onto the Gryffindor table. Even at the distance she and Marlene were sitting, her plate still rattled in its place. Her eyes widened, as did all eyes in the room. They all fell on Remus.</p><p>For what felt like days, he stared Sirius down, unwaveringly, and Sirius seemed to shrink into his skin. Finally, Remus shook his head, in what appeared to be disgust, and marched from the Great Hall. As soon as he disappeared around the corner, conversations exploded around the room.</p><p> </p><p>“Was that Lupin??”</p><p> </p><p>“Are you serious? <em>He</em> gave Sirius the black eye?”</p><p> </p><p>“I heard they were fighting over a girl!”</p><p> </p><p>“I didn’t even know Remus could throw a punch that hard. I’m a bit impressed.”</p><p> </p><p>“Is it just me, or did Remus look more … fetching than usual?”</p><p> </p><p>Marlene’s was one of the more ridiculous questions. Lily rolled her eyes. Marlene was only giddy that Sirius got punched in the face after the rather unceremonious way he had ended (or rather, hadn’t even started) things with her the year before. But he hadn’t been with another girl since, and that wasn’t at all like Sirius Black – he usually went through them weekly. Was that what he and Remus were fighting over? A girl? </p><p>“I’ll meet you in Charms,” she said, standing quickly, despite Marlene’s protests. James called after her as she raced past them on her way out of the Great Hall. Finally, she caught up to Remus, outside the entrance to Gryffindor tower, but he hadn’t given the password, yet. The Fat Lady was yelling at him, but he stood there, one hand raised to his face, pushing through the golden curls at his forehead.</p><p>Out of breath, she ducked behind a corner, waiting. For a long time, he stood silently, his shoulders rising and falling with forced deep, even breaths. Much to the Fat Lady’s annoyance, he steadied himself, pressing his palm flat against her portrait, his other hand sliding down his face.</p><p>“I ought to kill him.” Lily barely heard him mutter under his breath, and immediately, her jaw fell slack, the air escaped from her lungs. <em>Kill him?</em> Had it really gotten that bad?</p><p>“Remus,” she said softly, stepping out from around the corner. In his surprise, he turned his head quickly, but kept his back to her, pushing his hand all the way back through his hair.</p><p>“Lily, what …” he cleared his throat. “Um, what are you doing here?”</p><p>“What the hell is going on with you and Sirius?” she asked straight away, and she watched Remus swallow hard, his jaw clenched tight.</p><p>“It’s really nobody else’s business,” he replied coldly. At first, Lily balked at his answer – she wasn’t sure she’d ever heard him speak this bluntly before. She wasn’t even sure she’d heard him say no to anything before – he was, by all rights, sort of a pushover. At least, until recently.</p><p>“Has he done something to upset you?” she asked, instinctively reaching out and placing her hand on his forearm. Immediately, he tensed, letting out terse laughter.</p><p>“Oh, it’s his favorite thing. To <em>upset</em> me.” He let out a long, slow breath.</p><p>“What has he done?”</p><p>Remus let out a short huff. “What has he <em>not</em> done?” he answered ambiguously.</p><p>“Remus,” Lily sighed, her hand still on his arm. “Let me help you fix this.”</p><p> </p><p>This time, Remus’ laughter was spontaneous and genuine. Almost as if he were happy.</p><p> </p><p>“Trust me, Lily. You<em> really</em> can’t help me with this.” He whispered the password to the Fat Lady, the portrait opened, and Remus disappeared into the Gryffindor Common Room, leaving Lily to wonder just what was going on in the ranks of the Marauders these days.</p><p>  </p><p>
  <strong> <em> <u>Sirius</u> </em> </strong>
</p><p> </p><p>Once morning came, Remus threw the blanket over himself and went directly to the furthest corner of the room. Sirius tried not to let the expression show through on his face – he was going to get an earful after last night. He had stood in between a werewolf on a full moon and a feral wolf that was getting cheated out of a stag dinner. And the werewolf was certainly going to let him know what a blithering idiot he was for it. He threw cautious glances over to the decaying armchair that Remus had thrown himself into, but Remus had pulled the blanket over his face. With a deep breath, he lit a cigarette between his teeth.</p><p>Peter was the first to leave – he managed to convince James to go with him. The four boys usually all went back to the castle under James’ cloak – a safety precaution. This time, Sirius had convinced James and Peter to go on ahead without them, for the first time. They’d only obliged because they wanted to give Remus and Sirius time to work out whatever their problem was. </p><p>Despite what Remus was surely thinking, Sirius <em>wasn’t </em>actually a blithering idiot – he knew that James and Peter had been constructing situations to bring he and Remus back together and, truthfully, it was downright adorable. They hadn’t failed to notice Sirius and Remus constantly avoided each other and, knowing James, he was likely panicking internally about the sanctity of the Marauders, crumbling to pieces.</p><p>Once James and Peter had left, Sirius stood, walking cautiously over to where Remus sat sulking in his dusty armchair. Remus peered out from where his face was hidden by the folds of his blanket.</p><p>“Are you cross with me, Moony?” Sirius asked, sweetly. For a moment, Remus just stared, breathing in sharply through clenched teeth. He stood slowly, just before yanking the cigarette from Sirius’ lips, tossing it onto the windowsill next to him, and shoving Sirius hard against the wall behind him. Sirius let out a soft cry, as Remus’ lips crashed into his own, violently and desperately.</p><p>“You could have been killed,” Remus mumbled between kisses. “I would have had to watch you <em>die</em>, Sirius.” Remus’ lips traveled down Sirius’ neck, his hands slipping down Sirius’ bare waist, tucking softly into the elastic of his boxers. Sirius hummed contentedly in response.</p><p>“I’m sorry, Moony,” he said, letting out a soft moan as Remus cupped his lips around Sirius’ Adam’s apple and his slender fingers slid between Sirius’s legs. “It was instinct, I just wanted to keep you safe.” Remus’ touch became heavier – Sirius’ breathing became heavier.</p><p>“He couldn’t have hurt me, you idiot,” Remus panted into Sirius’ ear, Sirius craned his neck toward him. “He could have hurt <em>you</em>.” Sirius pulled the edge of the blanket away from Remus’ throat, threading his fingers through Remus’ hair and pulling just hard enough to lean his head back.</p><p>“I won’t do it again,” Sirius promised, dragging his tongue up the length of Remus’ long neck, and dipping his hand into Remus’ blanket, curling his fingers around Remus’ naked, erect cock.</p><p>“<em>Merlin,”</em> Remus moaned softly, his head still leaned back as Sirius bit down softly onto his collarbone. One hand slid up the length of Sirius’ expansive waist and curled softly around his neck, as he started to push his hips against Sirius’. Suddenly, his head straightened, and his eyes got wide, his fingers just barely tightening at the skin on Sirius’ neck. “Someone’s coming.”</p><p>Sirius froze, listening to the creaking of the floorboards of the Shack. “It’s got to be James.” Remus started to move away, but Sirius’ grip on his cock tightened. Remus narrowed his eyes.</p><p>“You wouldn’t,” he swallowed hard. Sirius’ mischievous grin devoured his face, as he plucked his cigarette from the edge of the window and placed it back between his lips.</p><p>“Wouldn’t I?” he asked, and Remus blinked hard.</p><p>“Sirius. Do not do this to me in front of James,” he half-threatened, and half-begged, his fingers tightening further around Sirius’ throat as Sirius’ fingers slid up and down Remus’ length.</p><p>“Too late.” Sirius exhaled a breath of smoke just as James came racing over.</p><p>“Remus!” he shouted, evidently causing Remus to realize that he had his hand still wrapped around Sirius’ throat. Slowly, he uncurled his fingers, likely hoping Sirius would do the same. Sirius’ wrist moved just enough to unsettle Remus, but not ruffle any of the blankets between them. Remus yanked at the edges of the blankets, and shifted backward, trying to dislodge Sirius’ grip, but to no avail. Sirius continued to gaze lecherously at him, swallowing hard at the site of Remus in such a disheveled state.</p><p>“What the hell happened?” James yelled, and he gave Remus a shove in the shoulder, causing the grip that Sirius had on him to shift hard, and Sirius could tell by the expression on Remus’ face, it was all he could do to keep from breathing out, hot and heavy. </p><p>“Nothing,” Sirius replied through clenched teeth, trying to keep his grin under control – Remus’ expression lay somewhere between near-orgasm and plotting Sirius’ violent end.</p><p>“What is going on with you two?” James asked, frustration in his voice as he tried to smooth his mussed hair. Sirius almost laughed out loud. He thought he would try being truthful about it.</p><p>“I can’t be in the same room with him without wanting to tear him apart,” he replied, quite honestly, his jaw tensing as he flicked his wrist, shifting Remus in his hand. Remus let out a sharp breath, leaving Sirius to wish he was underneath the blanket entirely. He sucked hard on the cigarette in his lips, cheeks caving deeply.</p><p>“Why?” James asked, his voice cracking. “Why are you both fighting in the first place?” Sirius couldn’t cover up the smirk on his face as he swirled his thumb over the head of Remus’ cock. Remus breathed out instinctively, trying to cover it up by speaking.</p><p>“I hate you, Sirius,” Remus said, his voice trembling a bit, and as James’ head turned toward Remus, in shock of what he had just said, Sirius lasciviously slid his tongue over his top lip. “I hate you so fucking much,” he repeated, pulling his lip into his teeth and leaning, just slightly, into Sirius’ touch.</p><p>When James’ turned his attention back to Sirius, Sirius turned his expression cold, but he couldn’t stop his eyes from wandering over Remus’ face, scattering over every scar and wishing he could put his lips on all of them. Especially the gruesomely long scar that stretch all the way across Remus’ waist, ending underneath his hip bone, at the crease of Remus’ leg. When Sirius sucked on the end of the scar, Remus became a throbbing, begging mess. Just thinking about it had Sirius painfully hard. Watching Remus writhe at his touch had him aching. He couldn’t help himself. Damn James for interrupting.</p><p>Sirius leaned forward, as much as possible with James between them, and stated in a ragged, breathless tone, “I’d love to see just how much you hate me.”</p><p>“James, please leave,” Remus begged, darting his tongue out to wet his lips.</p><p>“No, I won’t!” James growled, and he suddenly began squeezing his way in between them. Immediately, Sirius released Remus and they both took wide steps away from James, Remus awkwardly adjusting the blanket to conceal his erection. “I don’t know what happened between you two,” he started. <em>Sex,</em> Sirius thought to himself, <em>A lot of sex happened between us</em>. James continued. “But you’re going to have to learn to forgive each other! I won’t lose you both over this.”</p><p>Remus sighed, and Sirius watched the wheels turning in his head. “James, listen,” he started to say, but Sirius saw this going in another direction, so he interrupted.</p><p>“This doesn’t concern you, Prongs,” Sirius spouted out, to stop Remus from telling him the truth. No, they could hide it for a while longer. They could have fun with it a little while longer. James turned to look back at him, but Sirius held him in place. “This is between me and that …” he mouthed the word ‘<em>sexy</em>’ to Remus while James remained turned, smoke pouring from his lips. “… bastard there.” </p><p>“Sirius!” James hissed, and Sirius could almost not contain his laughter at poor James thinking that he actually could stay mad at Remus. “Just … tell me what’s happened.” Remus finally gave in to Sirius’ plan, but couldn’t keep the affectionate way he looked at Sirius out of his gaze.</p><p>“He’s ruined my life, James,” Remus stated, in the softest voice Sirius had heard him use in a long time, and Sirius well understood. His cheeks flushed as he held Remus’ gaze.</p><p>“And him mine,” he replied in like tone, and in his mind, he repeated it over and over for what it really was. <em>I love you, Moony. I’m in love with you, Moony. I’m so in love with you, Moony. </em></p><p>“Then let’s fix it!” James’ voice went all squeaky, as if he were afraid this was the bloody, gruesome death of the Marauders. “We can get everything back to the way it was.” Remus spoke before he finished.</p><p>“I don’t want it to go back to the way it was,” he said, the breath falling from his chest. To Sirius, it was almost as if James weren’t there at all, he and Remus were standing alone in the Shack.</p><p>“Neither do I,” Sirius replied, the ends of his words falling off as he got lost in the color of Remus’ amber eyes, remembering what it was like without him, and never wanting to go back there.</p><p>The times Remus helped him in DADA – how Remus would softly put his hand at the small of Sirius’ back to straighten out his posture, the way Remus’ gaze would travel to his feet and back as he examined the way Sirius stood, and the blushing on his cheeks when he realized he was staring a little too long. The nights that Sirius helped him with his prefect duties – how they got stuck in a hidden passage while trying to hide Sirius from Filch and Sirius absolutely had to know how Remus tasted. And the way his heart stopped beating when he realized that Remus had kissed him first. How he tasted just the way Sirius imagined, only better – like warmth, and sweetness, and Christmas fucking morning.</p><p>“But I …” James said, pulling Sirius out of his memories and before he could say more, Sirius pushed him to the door. He had to be with Remus, he couldn’t wait any longer.</p><p>“Go back to Hogwarts, Prongs,” Sirius said, not able to tear his gaze away from Remus. “There’s nothing you can do.” Remus blinked slowly, keeping the smile from his face, but not from his eyes.</p><p>“Just … promise me you’ll talk.” James furrowed his brow, as he turned to go.</p><p>Remus replied right away, his voice a near growl. “I’ll make him talk.” Sirius raised a brow, as James’ creaking footsteps grew more and more faint.</p><p>“I thought we were having a nice moment there, but you had to make everything sexual, like you always do,” Sirius grinned, walking backward as Remus walked forward, toward him.</p><p>“I can’t help it,” Remus said, taking his comment in stride, opening the edges of his blanket and pulling Sirius inside. “You’ve made me a horrible person. You’ve ruined my life, remember?” Remus pinned Sirius to the wall, angling his bare hips against Sirius as he pressed his lips to Sirius’ jaw, biting softly and working his way down Sirius’ throat. Sirius maneuvered his cigarette to the other side of his mouth, to save Remus from the ash.</p><p>“<em>Moony</em>,” Sirius breathed out, leaning his head back against the wall. “Maybe I should fondle you in public more often.” Remus rotated his hips, settling them between Sirius’ legs.</p><p>“I quite like this little charade we’ve got going,” Remus hummed, sucking at the base of Sirius’ neck, as Sirius ran his fingers through the back of Remus’ hair.</p><p>“You like pretending to hate me?” Sirius taunted, lifting one leg and wrapping it around Remus’ hip, to which Remus responded by pressing further into him. Sirius let out a soft, throaty moan.</p><p>“You’ve no idea how badly I wanted to blow you just now,” Remus growled, quickly dropping to his knees, pulling Sirius’ leg over his shoulder. He kissed down Sirius’ waist with an open mouth, tugging at the waist of his boxers, biting onto Sirius’ lean hipbone.</p><p>“Is this how you’re going to make me talk?” Sirius swallowed as he peered down into the blanket, where he could just barely see the amber glow of Remus’ eyes looking back at him.</p><p>“There’s really only one thing I want you to say,” Remus responded quietly, as his wet lips curled around the head of Sirius’ cock. Sirius exhaled hard, his fingers wound into Remus’ soft curls.</p><p>“Fuck.” It was barely a word, all full of breath and smoke, expanding through the emptiness of the Shack. Sirius’ knee jerked, his leg tightening from where it was thrown over Remus’ shoulder. In reply, Remus pushed further into the gap between Sirius’ legs, swallowing Sirius’ cock in full. His hold in Remus’ hair stiffened, and Remus gripped just as tightly onto the underside of Sirius’ thigh.</p><p>“I’m waiting for you to say it,” Remus whispered, leaving Sirius open and empty for just a moment, before taking him back into his throat. Another smoke-filled moan was ripped from Sirius’ lungs, his hips twitching to meet Remus’ lips more closely. Remus’ fingers slid up higher underneath Sirius’ thigh.</p><p>“Remus.” Sirius’ voice was urgent, his eyes fluttered closed as Remus’ hand slipped up the center of Sirius’ arse, his fingers teasing at the opening.</p><p>“<em>Merlin</em>, say it again,” Remus hummed in a deep growl, his words mumbled against the tip of Sirius’ cock, as he lapped his tongue at the slit.</p><p>“Remus,” Sirius repeated, a bit louder, a lot breathier, feeling like he would inevitably come apart.</p><p>“Remus?” Sirius heard, and his eyes flew open to see Peter standing where James had just been standing only moments prior. Sirius choked on smoke. “Is Remus still here?” Peter asked.</p><p>“No,” Sirius replied quickly, as Remus was deathly still beneath the blanket, Sirius’ cock still buried deep in his throat. “I’m just … I was … thinking of a fight we had earlier.” Remus took this opportunity to bite down, ever so softly, onto the base of Sirius’ cock – just enough to apply pressure. It was all Sirius could do not to yell out – he held his breath, pursed his lips around his cigarette, and clenched his fingers in Remus’ hair.</p><p>“A fight?” Peter asked, worry in his expression.</p><p>“A terrible fight, yes,” Sirius explained breathlessly, as Remus pushed a finger into his mouth, alongside Sirius’ cock. “Oh, gods,” Sirius breathed out quietly, ash falling onto the blanket Remus was hidden in.</p><p>“That bad?” Peter winced. Sirius nodded vigorously, wondering how in Merlin’s name he was going to get this conversation to end, or whether he was going to come right there in front of Peter.</p><p>“Yes,” Sirius responded, just as Remus slid his slick finger around the edge of the tight ring of muscle at Sirius’ arse. “Oh,<em> yes</em>,” he muttered, feeling his eyes roll back into his head.</p><p>“What was the fight about?” Peter asked, leaning against the wall next to him. Sirius grimaced, wracking his brain to think of ways to get rid of him, but his brain was solely focused on Remus – his gloriously wet mouth and his inexorably hot finger, which he began to push slowly in.</p><p>“Remus!” Sirius called out suddenly and Remus went still. The cigarette fell from his lips, nearly lighting the blanket on fire. “It’s Remus’ fault,” Sirius recovered, with shaking breath, “Why don’t you ask him?”</p><p>“Where did he go?” Peter asked, and Sirius felt very much that he would strangle Peter the next time he saw him – when Remus wasn’t paying him back with interest for fondling him in front of James.</p><p>“He’s off suck … sulking,” Sirius stammered, pulling less than gently at Remus’ hair.</p><p>“Maybe I should go find him.” Remus was inside him, up to the knuckle, when he started to pump slowly into Sirius, pushing in and pulling out, his mouth still wrapped around Sirius’ cock, unmoving.</p><p>“<em>Oh, yes</em>,” Sirius moaned. “Yes!” he corrected with a shout. “Yes, go find Remus.”  Peter stood there, looking curiously at him, and Sirius could feel himself coming out of his skin.</p><p>“I’ll do that. Later, Padfoot,” Peter said, with furrowed brows as he walked back the way he’d come, as silently as the way he’d entered. Sirius tried to keep it together, despite how Remus never once stopped moving inside him. Once Peter left, Remus went back to sucking, devouring Sirius’ cock.</p><p>“Fuck, Moony,” Sirius moaned, throwing the blanket off to the side and watching Remus move his mouth and his fingers in time. “I hate you, Remus Lupin,” he growled, putting his hands over Remus’ ears and pushing his cock a bit deeper into Remus’ throat. Remus responded by humming, vibrating his lips along Sirius’ length with every push. And Sirius broke – coming in a shaking, throbbing, cursing heap.</p><p>“I hate you, too, Sirius Black,” Remus replied, as Sirius slid along the wall, boneless, right into Remus’ lap. Remus kissed him lightly on the tip of his nose.</p><p>“I hope you know this means war,” Sirius threatened, as Remus wiped the cold sweat from Sirius’ forehead. “I’ll suck you off right in the Gryffindor Common Room, I swear to Godric.”</p><p>“I doubt that very much,” Remus scoffed, reclining back onto the blanket that Sirius had strewn across the floor, knowing full well that Sirius’ eyes were on every inch of his bare skin.</p><p>“I could pay you back right here. I know you need it,” Sirius breathed out, kneeling over Remus and drinking in the site of his best friend – pink and aroused and breathless. They had discovered very quickly that getting Remus off right after a full moon was almost better than taking him to Madam Pomfrey.</p><p>Not long after they’d found out about Remus’ condition – but before they had succeeded in becoming animagi – the boys had worked hard on mastering a few of the more basic healing spells. Poppy had gladly helped them with it. When the moons weren’t so bad, they could take care of Remus on their own.</p><p>The last night’s transformation had been unusually calm, compared to other, more violent moons. The only real incident was between Sirius and the feral wolf – Remus’ Wolf hadn’t even made contact with the wild animal. Scars on Remus’ skin were few and far between that morning – the boys had easily healed them before James and Peter headed back to the castle. The rest of the healing Sirius could do with his mouth.</p><p> “I am … <em>aching</em>. In more ways than one,” Remus implied with a grin, resting his hands behind his head as Sirius laid over him, placing delicate kisses across all of his scars – old and new.</p><p>“Let me take care of you, Moony,” Sirius hummed against Remus’ skin, working his way toward his favorite of Remus’ scars. “But don’t think this means I forgive you for what you just did to me in front of Pete.”</p><p>“Oh,” Remus let out a long sigh as Sirius ran his tongue along the long, craggy scar at his hip, arching his back into Sirius’ mouth, just a bit. “You enjoyed it, Pads. You always enjoy it.”</p><p>“I won’t say I didn’t,” Sirius agreed, as he nibbled at the bottom edge of the faded scar, putting his mouth very near the proximity of Remus’ cock. Remus keened, breathing heavy and squirming under Sirius’ lips. “But in front of Peter? He would have seen me <em>orgasm</em>, Moony, is that what you wanted?”</p><p>“No,” Remus breathed out hard. “I want to be the only one who gets to see that.” Sirius looked up at him, taking Remus’ cock into his hand and pumping it softly.</p><p>“That’s my Moony,” he hummed, running his tongue along the vein at the underside of Remus’ cock. Remus let out a growling moan, his head falling softly back onto the blanket.</p><p>“<em>Pads.</em>” He balled up the blanket in one fist, the other fist brought to his lips, as he bit down onto his knuckle, while Sirius plunged him into the back of his throat. Remus let out a short yell, the fist that had been buried in the blankets went flying in the direction of Sirius’ hair just as Sirius head happened to bob up. Remus’ fist collided into Sirius’ eye with a dull crack.</p><p>“Shit ... fuck,” Sirius mumbled, sitting back on his heels, still straddled over Remus’ knees. Immediately, Remus sat up, taking Sirius’ face into his hands.</p><p>“Oh, shit, <em>shit</em>. Padfoot, I’m … I’m so sorry,” he grimaced, kissing softly onto the forming bruise around Sirius’ eye. “Sirius, Jesus, I’m so, so sorry.” Sirius looked at him, with one eye open.</p><p>“Are you kidding? This is perfect. People will really think we hate each other now,” he grinned, connivingly, pushing Remus back down onto the floor. “In fact, I’m really kind of digging this hate kink we have going on. I think I might be a masochist.” Remus let out a bubbling laugh that Sirius wanted to swallow and keep forever – the kind of laugh that put wrinkles into the corners of Remus’ eyes.</p><p>“Do you want me to pull your hair, too?” Remus teased, as Sirius leaned over him.</p><p>“Don’t ask me questions you already know the answer to, Moony,” Sirius grinned, biting softly at Remus’ bottom lip before peppering his chest with kisses.</p><p>“I can’t believe you’re still going to suck me off after I punched you in the face.” Remus carefully eased his fingers through Sirius’ hair, lightly tucking his long hair behind his ear.</p><p>“I might want to blow you <em>more</em> now, actually,” Sirius laughed softly, taking the length of Remus into his hand and kissing from base to end, circling the tip with his tongue, as Remus’ breathing got louder, heavier, scattered. Sirius quickly took the whole of him in his mouth, pressing Remus’ legs wider apart so that he could settle in between them.</p><p>“Sirius,” he exhaled, gripping hard onto his shoulder.</p><p>“I’m waiting for you to say it,” Sirius teased, sliding a single finger along Remus’ scar, starting from the top of the scar, at the curve of his waist and past the end of the scar. Beyond his hip bone, down the inside of his thigh, letting his mouth take over, until he plunged Remus back into his throat.</p><p>“Oh, fuck me, Sirius,” Remus moaned, and Sirius pulled him from his mouth.</p><p>“My fucking pleasure,” he growled, swallowing Remus again and pressing his thumbs deep into the indentations at Remus’ hips. The sounds coming from Remus’ lips alone would be enough to get Sirius off a second time – Sirius moaned, and it reverberated into Remus’ skin.</p><p>“Fuck, fuck, fuck,” Remus muttered, holding one hand over his eyes and yanking hard at Sirius’ hair with the other. The pressure of his mouth on Remus’s cock doubled. Remus only, <em>ever</em> swore in this very context, and Sirius was the only one who ever got to hear it said this way. Which meant that every time he heard Remus curse, Sirius was nearly <em>immediately </em>erect.</p><p>“Ah, fuck,” Sirius mumbled, Remus’ cock still between his teeth, as he let his hand reach down and slip into his boxers, pumping himself in rhythm with what his mouth did to Remus. Remus continued to let slip a string of curse words, only working to spur Sirius to pump him harder, and faster.</p><p>“Pads, I’m … oh, <em>fuck,</em>” Remus said, drawing out the word, his breath shuddering as he came in Sirius’ mouth, and Sirius swallowed it down. Just as Sirius had started to think he was going to come again, just after Remus had, Remus reached out and slowed his hand.</p><p>“Wait,” he said, with a dangerous grin on his lips. “I want you hard. All day.”</p><p>Sirius rose his eyebrows. “Well, <em>Moony</em>.”</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong> <em> <u>Remus</u> </em> </strong>
</p><p> </p><p>Ever the drama queen, Sirius made Remus go back to Hogwarts first – he wanted to make a grand appearance in the Great Hall with his brand new, swollen black eye. Sirius was practically giddy over seeing James’ reaction to his battle wound. While Remus couldn’t understand why Sirius loved to see James in such a fractured state over his friends falling apart, Remus certainly understood his excitement in seeing the responses of everyone in the Great Hall to his face. Remus made a point of going straight there from the Shack, instead of going back to the dorm first, so he could be there when Sirius made his entrance.</p><p>James and Peter were already tense when Remus sat at the Gryffindor table – they had already told each other their stories of going back to the Shack, and the situations they thought they had walked in on. Remus struggled to appear miserable, when, in fact, he’d never been happier in all his life.</p><p>“Are you … alright?” Peter asked timidly, as Remus shoveled food down his throat. Before everything changed, Remus never had an appetite the day after a full moon. Ever since Sirius had discovered how to ‘<em>take care’ </em>of him afterward, it was like he couldn’t eat enough in the day. And it wasn’t even just that – it was Sirius, in general. Being with Sirius made every other aspect of his life seem so much easier – full moons included.</p><p>“Peachy,” Remus replied in a mumble, through a mouthful of food. The irony was that, despite the irritated tone he used to say it, it was actually the truth. Everything was exceptionally rosy.</p><p>“Remus, listen …” James began to say, just as a stifling hush fell over the Great Hall. Remus could feel the smile creep onto his face, despite how hard he tried to suppress it. Without looking up, his eyes found Sirius, looking absolutely devastated, his hair tied back with his wand (which he <em>knew</em> drove Remus wild), to be certain that everyone in the room could see the swollen side of his face.</p><p>Gasps erupted from everywhere, including from James and Peter. It was getting harder not to let out a laugh – if only they knew the real context of how Sirius had gotten that injury.</p><p>Sirius walked slowly over to the Gryffindor table, going so far as to nervously glance around, and pretend to scratch his forehead to cover his conspicuous injury. At that, Remus couldn’t help but let out a small snort – Sirius, the king of needing attention, wanting people to stop staring? James glanced over at him in response, and Remus over-dramatically rolled his eyes and grumbled nonsense into his breakfast.</p><p>When Sirius neared their table, all eyes were on them. The word was spreading like a virus that Remus was the one who had given Sirius his vicious wound, and everyone was waiting to see what Remus would do to him next. Even James and Peter were eyeing him warily. Sirius’ eyes fell on him for a moment, and Remus, looking up at him through his eyelashes, let his eyes drift lazily down Sirius’ torso, a single eyebrow rising slowly. And Sirius, getting entirely lost in watching Remus, went to place his hand on the table to sit, and missed it completely, nearly slamming into the edge of the table underneath him.</p><p>Again, gasping bloomed all over the hall. Remus stifled a grin and he could hear the tiny sigh that escaped Sirius’ lips in response. Their eyes met for the briefest moment, and Remus could see the glow in the silver of Sirius’ gaze. James was speaking in a hushed tone, but for Remus, everything was dulled – Sirius Black may as well have been the only person in the entirety of the Great Hall.</p><p>As Sirius sat, Remus extended his leg underneath the table, as Sirius did the same, and the two locked their feet together at the ankle for just a moment. It had become somewhat of a ritual for them, their way to say <em>‘good morning’ </em>without letting James and Peter in on their secret.</p><p>“Sirius?” James snapped, tearing the two of them from their moment of solitude. “What the hell happened?” Instinctively, Sirius glanced over toward Remus, who was specifically not looking directly back.</p><p>Sirius swallowed hard, pretending to get emotional, but his eyes fell on Remus and they suddenly went dark, feral. “Remus is an animal.”</p><p> </p><p>Remus choked on his pumpkin juice. Sirius never broke his gaze.</p><p> </p><p>“I’ve never seen him this way, James. He’s absolutely out of control.” Sirius ran his foot, suddenly shoeless, up the inside of Remus’ leg, underneath the table. Letting out a short huff of air, Remus rolled his head back – he knew where this was going. Sirius wasn’t going to let their game of payback come to an end.</p><p> “Don’t let him fool you, James,” Remus retorted, shifting down into his seat as Sirius’ foot slid up along Remus’ thigh. He was going to call this bluff. Sirius wouldn’t dare get him worked up in the Great Hall. Would he? He glanced over at Sirius, and the answer was all over his face. <em>‘Wouldn’t I?’</em></p><p>“Have I done something to upset you, Moony?” Sirius asked innocently, pressing the ball of his foot against Remus’ crotch, and Remus laughed in response.</p><p>“James, this is all an act – he’s not as sweet and boyish as you think. He’s done some terrible, cruel things to me. Things you would be aghast to know. In fact, why don’t I tell you all about it?” Remus threatened, and Sirius’ foot was still for a moment, as his eyes narrowed in Remus’ direction.</p><p>“Go ahead, Remus,” Sirius fired back, his voice silken, his smile wicked, his foot sliding back and forth along Remus under the table. “I’d love for them to find out what I’ve done to you. What I’m still doing. What I’ll do to you every day for the rest of your life.” Remus hung his head to conceal his smile.</p><p> </p><p>Dammit. Why did Sirius always win at these torture games?</p><p> </p><p>Instantly, Remus stood and slammed both hands down onto the table, ensuring that all eyes in the Great Hall were on him. He purposefully leaned forward, to appear like he was trying to intimidate Sirius, when actually, he was using the hanging hem of his sweater to cover the <em>swelling</em> that Sirius had caused. For added effect, he stared Sirius down for a long time, and Sirius pretended to look shaken. The look in both of their eyes was the same – <em>‘Wait until I get you alone.’</em></p><p>With an over-dramatic shake of his head, Remus stomped from the Great Hall, off toward the Gryffindor Common Room. Once he reached the Fat Lady portrait, Remus stood silently, taking in a deep breath and pushing his hand up over his face, through his hair. Sure, the charade was fun, but he’d rather just grab Sirius by the collar and snog him right there in front of all four houses and Dumbledore and McGonagall and everyone. He’d rather be able to rest his head on Sirius’ shoulder at the Gryffindor table, or lie in Sirius’ lap in the Common Room, or let his fingers find Sirius’ on the way to Potions.</p><p> </p><p>Merlin, did he have it bad.</p><p> </p><p>Not to mention, the not-so-little problem that Sirius had just caused under the Gryffindor table wasn’t getting any littler, not when he was thinking about all the things he’d like to do to Sirius Black. With an unsteady breath, Remus steadied himself against the wall, or rather, against the Fat Lady’s portrait with his free hand, the other still covering the flushing of his face. He didn’t even hear the shrill way the Fat Lady fussed over the fingerprints he was leaving all over her frame.</p><p>He laughed softly to himself, trying to ease the heat in his veins. “I ought to kill him.”</p><p>“Remus,” he heard from behind him, and he had just enough sense left not to turn around, as the swell beneath his zipper wasn’t exactly diminished.</p><p>“Lily,” he said, gritting his teeth. Her timing, as always, was perfectly abysmal – she had nearly caught he and Sirius on numerous occasions the last couple months. “What … what are you doing here?”</p><p>She didn’t skip a beat. “What the hell is going on with you and Sirius?”  Even just his name, on someone else’s lips, was enough to send a jolt down Remus’ spine.</p><p>“It’s really nobody else’s business,” he replied, more bluntly than he’d ever spoken to Lily. She was one of the few people, outside of the Marauders, who even cared enough to speak to him – he usually had much more patience than this, especially with her. But all he wanted to do was take a cold shower and plot the ways he was going to pay Sirius back for this. Though, he should probably do that in reverse order.</p><p>Lily was quiet at first – she was likely as surprised at Remus’ answer as he’d been. “Has he done something to upset you?” she finally asked, and he felt her fingers fall softly on his forearm. Her touch was like fire, and he could only wish it were Sirius.</p><p>“Oh, it’s his favorite thing. To <em>upset</em> me.” He had to stop thinking about Sirius, he had to get on with his day – lately, that was becoming more and more difficult.</p><p>“What has he done?” she asked in a near-whisper.</p><p>Remus laughed – it sounded short. “What has he <em>not</em> done?”</p><p>“Remus, let me help you fix this.” Just like Lily. Just like James. To want to fix everything. It was ridiculous how perfect they were for each other. Eventually, she would come to see it. But this was one thing that nobody – nobody but Sirius – could help him get out of. And he never wanted out of it.</p><p> </p><p>Remus laughed loudly, realizing Lily had no idea what she was getting herself into.</p><p> </p><p>“Trust me, Lily. You<em> really</em> can’t help me with this,” he groaned softly, trying to adjust himself to a more comfortable position without actually adjusting. Quickly, he uttered the password to the Lady and raced into the Common Room, making a break toward their dorm room, where he could get some relief.</p><p>There was barely enough time for Remus to suffer through an icy shower and get half-dressed before Sirius was bounding through the dorm room door. As he entered, he gave Remus a stimulated glance, as Remus had just begun to pull a jumper on over his bare skin.</p><p>“Did I miss anything fun?” Sirius smirked, sliding his hands around Remus’ waist before the sweater had time to cover it. Remus grinned, kissing him softly.</p><p>“I needed a cold shower.” Remus pretended to frown but couldn’t keep his smile stifled.</p><p>“Oh, I thought you’d come up for a wank. I wanted to help.” Sirius waggled his eyebrows, his fingers still tucked underneath Remus’ jumper. As Remus rolled his eyes wide, Sirius pulled him in close. </p><p>“Saving that part for later,” Remus replied, wrapping his arms tightly around Sirius’ neck, pressing his lips to the swollen skin underneath Sirius’ eye. “How’s the black eye?”</p><p>“It’s brilliant, I’ve never had so many people stare at me at once.”</p><p>Remus laughed softly. “That’s not what I meant.” Sirius continued, unfazed.</p><p>“You’re being pegged as quite the badass, you know. They’re all so shocked, Moony. Quiet, little Remus Lupin – who knew?” The mischievous smirk on Sirius’ face only grew with each word.</p><p>“They’d be even more shocked if they knew what you were doing to me at the time.”</p><p>“I almost want to out us, just to see the reaction,” Sirius howled with laughter. In response, Remus leapt forward and covered his laughter with his lips.</p><p>“Does it hurt, Pads?” he asked about his eye, peppering feathered kisses across Sirius’ face.</p><p>Sirius’ smile was like sunlight. “What hurts is not being able to kiss you at the Gryffindor table, or in the Common Room, or whenever the hell I want. Having to tell you good morning with my feet.”</p><p>“We could just stop keeping it a secret,” Remus offered, half-hopefully, but knowing what could be the consequences of that decision. How would James and Peter react? How would their House react? Would they be separated – would one of them have to be reassigned to another dorm? There was too much that <em>could </em>change – and neither of them were sure of what <em>would</em>. Remus knew what Sirius’ response would be – he was having far too much fun with their act to give up now.</p><p>“We could risk it.” Remus’ eyes widened, as Sirius pressed his forehead against Remus’, his fingers tracing through the slight stubble at Remus’ sunken cheeks. “I’d do it, Moony. If it meant I could have you whenever I wanted, kiss you whenever I wanted, take your hand whenever I wanted.”</p><p>Remus cheeks flushed slightly. “I had no idea you were such a romantic, Padfoot.”</p><p>“What can I say? You’ve ruined me, Moony.” The silver of Sirius’ eyes was as white as Lumos, and he softly pushed his lips to Remus’ for a moment, before pulling him toward the door.</p><p>“Does that mean our game is over?” Remus asked, warily. Sirius looked back, with a raised brow.</p><p>“Not on your life, Lupin.”</p><p> </p><p>It was Friday night, there was a secret party with some of the other Houses, taking place somewhere outside of any of their Common Rooms. That was part of the fun, James said – the risk of being caught by Filch, with a bottle of firewhisky, no less. James had somehow convinced Remus and Sirius to tag along, in some attempt at getting them both properly pissed enough into either resolving their fight, or at least finding out what it was about. Even Lily had come along, likely for the same reason.</p><p>Sirius and Remus played their roles throughout the night, while casting each other subtly suggestive glances, each of them wishing they hadn’t come along, that they were back in their dorm. That day had gone on much like the morning, each of them insufferably teasing the other to their breaking point. James had cornered them so quickly after class that neither of them had gotten any relief.</p><p>Yet, neither were they letting up – the game was only getting more intense. In the halls on the way to Potions that afternoon, Remus had grabbed Sirius by the shirt collar, in a rather large crowd of people, and whispered quite breathily into his ear, ‘<em>Fuck me right here, Sirius,</em>’ followed by sucking on his earlobe. To anyone else, it must have looked like rage – the intense clenching of Sirius’ jaw.</p><p>So, they were stuck at James’ party – both of them desperate to sneak away and solve each other’s problems in private. Unfortunately for Remus, Marlene McKinnon was at this party, and was tipsy enough to be hitting on Sirius the entire night. It only made Remus’ problem worse – he wanted to take Sirius by the throat and mark him as his own. The firewhisky in his gut wasn’t helping.</p><p>At some point, someone suggested a game of spin the bottle – someone else upped the tension and suggested seven minutes in heaven. They compromised on a combination of the two. Much to James’ disappointment, Lily remarked that she wouldn’t dare be involved in their ridiculous game, but Remus could swear she was blushing violently as she planted herself in the corner. Irritated with the way Marlene was shamelessly throwing herself at his boyfriend, Remus also sulked away from the game, knowing the only person in that circle that he wanted to kiss was also the person he was pretending to hate.</p><p>Sirius sat in, but Remus saw the gears turning in his head – he was plotting something. It was evident in the lascivious glances he kept casting in Remus’ direction. The game started, a few of them went off into an adjacent classroom together, coming back breathless and flushed, James and Peter included. Remus was surprised that James had gone in with someone who wasn’t Lily, who had mysteriously vanished.</p><p>When it came to Sirius’ turn, Remus saw his fingers clutched onto his wand, hiding underneath his crossed legs. Of course, when the bottle stopped, it landed just in the center of two people – pointing from Sirius right toward the direction where Remus was brooding in the corner. Sirius put on a false look of surprise and, honestly, near-horror. Remus almost laughed.</p><p>“L-Let me spin again,” Sirius stammered, glancing at Remus to make sure he was getting the message. Gladly, Remus sauntered over to their circle.</p><p>“Wait just a minute,<em> Sirius</em>,” Remus said, injecting extra spite into his voice when he spoke Sirius’ name. “Can we do anything we want in there? Can I do anything I want to you?” No longer acting, Sirius swallowed hard, watching Remus carefully, and the circle got a little quiet.</p><p>“You want to fight him?” Peter asked, concern in his voice. <em>Bless Peter for being oblivious. </em></p><p>“Why not?” Remus answered vaguely, not removing his eyes from Sirius.</p><p>“No, you can’t!” Marlene cried, and Remus couldn’t stop his eyes from rolling in his head.</p><p>“Maybe they should,” James replied under his breath. All eyes darted over to him. “They need to get this out, whatever it is. Maybe they should just let it come to blows one more time and it’ll be over.”</p><p>“Glad you’re seeing it rationally, Prongs.” Remus’ low voice rumbled in his chest as he grabbed Sirius by the shoulder of his collared shirt and threw him in the direction of the empty classroom. Everyone seemed to be holding their breath as Remus slammed the door behind him.</p><p>Behind the closed door, Sirius finally let the rehearsed fear in his voice melt away, giving rise to a deep hunger in his tone. “Make it rough, Moony. They’ve got to believe it.” Remus paused, closing the gap between them, and wrapping his fingers around Sirius’ throat.</p><p>“Do you want me to hurt you, Sirius?” he asked, his voice lower, darker, more desperate. Sirius lifted his chin, as Remus pressed his thumb under the curve at his jaw.</p><p>“<em>Yes</em>,” he breathed out, his voice trembling. With only a moment’s hesitation, Remus threw Sirius against the wall, slamming the palm of his free hand against it, to increase the force of the blow. Sirius let out a loud grunt, which Remus quickly muffled with his lips, sliding his tongue deep into Sirius’ mouth. The hand on Sirius’ throat spread down, covering every expansive inch of Sirius’ waist, dipping hard between Sirius’ legs for a moment before gripping his hips and bringing them to his own. Remus curled a fist with his free hand, punching hard into the wall behind Sirius, shifting his hips into Sirius each time. Remus only allowed their lips apart so that his mouth could travel down Sirius’ neck, biting hard onto the skin, but not sucking.</p><p>“I need you to yell for me, love,” Remus demanded softly, and Sirius obliged, though the sound came out more pleasured than pained. Sirius buried his fingers into Remus’ hair.</p><p>“Is this what you’re like when you’re drunk? <em>God</em>, I should get you drunk more often,” Sirius panted into Remus’ ear, as Remus loosened the tie at Sirius’ neck.</p><p>“Drunk, and frustrated as <em>fuck</em> because of you,” Remus growled, tearing buttons from Sirius’ white shirt, ripping some threads from the stitching. “And fucking Marlene McKinnon thinks she can have you.”</p><p>“You’re the only one who can have me, Moony,” Sirius hummed. “But I’m not going to pretend that I don’t absolutely love this. Does jealousy always make you this rough?”</p><p>“I’d rather not test it,” Remus replied, clenching his teeth around the collar of Sirius’ shirt and pulling until the seams popped. “Because I feel like I could rip you apart right now.”</p><p>“Fucking<em> hell</em>, I’d let you, Moony.” With one last, impatient kiss, Remus stepped back, holding Sirius’ chin between his thumb and forefinger.</p><p>“Ready?” he asked. Sirius braced, nodding. Remus reared back and slapped Sirius hard across the cheek, opposite to his black eye, just in case. Sirius winced, breathing in through his teeth.</p><p>“God, I really am a masochist. I’ve never been more attracted to you,” Sirius laughed, closing one eye and holding his reddened cheek. Remus moved Sirius’ hand and kissed his warming skin.</p><p>“Please don’t make me do this all the time,” he whined.</p><p>“No promises,” Sirius grinned, kissing Remus softly. “Can I at least rough you up a bit?” </p><p>“Please do,” Remus smiled, spreading his arms out to his sides. Sirius reached up and mussed Remus’ hair a little more, stretched the neck of his sweater a little more. “Careful, I like this jumper.” With the collar stretched out just a bit, Sirius planted his lips against Remus’ neck, for just a moment. Remus’ eyes fluttered closed, and he let slip a satisfied sigh, before Sirius took a step back.</p><p>“Do you want me to hit you?” Sirius asked, tilting his head, as if deciding where it was he was going to plant his fist. For a moment, Remus was silent – mulling it over, pressing his lips to one side.</p><p>“Can we fake it? I’m still sore from last night.”</p><p>“Come here, then,” Sirius smirked, taking Remus’ face into his hands, pinching hard onto one of Remus’ cheekbones a few times, turning it red and slightly swollen.</p><p>“Does I look as beat up as you do?” Remus laughed, and Sirius’ eyes traveled down to his feet and back, his already flushed cheeks brightening for a moment.</p><p>“Well, yeah, but it looks like you <em>really</em> enjoyed it.” Sirius rose an eyebrow, his gaze falling on Remus’ crotch, and Remus let him look for a while.</p><p>“Can’t pretend that I didn’t,” he grinned, putting his hand between his legs, trying to adjust.</p><p>“Jesus, Remus,” Sirius groaned, lunging at him and gliding his tongue into Remus’ mouth. “You can’t just touch yourself like that and not expect me to want to bury my face in it.” Remus laughed, pushing Sirius away, to which Sirius responded by throwing his fist against the wall.</p><p>“Ready?” Remus asked, again. Sirius wriggled his hips, scrunching his nose.</p><p>“Not really, but if I don’t get out of this room, everyone outside is going to get an earful of me fucking you into the wall.” Remus swallowed, trying not to focus on that thought as he opened the door, and threw Sirius out by the back of the neck. A few gasps told Remus that their ruse was successful, and as he walked from the room, all eyes were on him.</p><p>“Well?” James asked, as if one fight would solve everything. Remus glanced up at Sirius once, letting his gaze linger, but trying hard not to look at him with anything but contempt. It was impossible.</p><p>“I’m going back to the dorm,” Remus muttered, rubbing his pinched cheek.</p><p>“Remus,” Sirius said, in a loud voice. Remus turned back to look at him, as did everyone else in the room. He stood stone-still for a moment, before saying. “We didn’t finish.” Remus nearly smiled.</p><p>“I beat you, Black. You’re a mess.” When all eyes turned back to Sirius for his reply, Remus let himself bite down onto his bottom lip, and Sirius clenched his jaw.</p><p>“So are you.”</p><p>“Alright, fine. You want to finish this? Let’s go.” And Remus walked out of the door, with Sirius close behind, telling everyone it was fine and to stay there and to definitely not come with them.</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong> <em> <u>Lily</u> </em> </strong>
</p><p> </p><p>That evening, Lily begrudgingly accepted an invitation to a secret all-House party, in a relatively abandoned part of Hogwarts, with a lot of interlocking, empty classrooms. James Potter had been the one who asked her to go, and she asked if Remus and Sirius would be there – her curiosity was getting the better of her, but she wasn’t the only one. In passing, James mentioned quietly that it was sort of a ploy into getting them to spend time together, and maybe trick them into being friends again. Lily knew there would be firewhisky involved, and honestly, it wasn’t a bad plan.</p><p>As soon as Marlene heard that Sirius would be there, she jumped at the chance. Like many girls at Hogwarts, she never truly got over him, even though the most they had ever done was snog in the Common Room, and that was really only the one time. But that was his signature – love ‘em and leave ‘em.</p><p>The party went well enough, there was drinking and laughing, and James was actually not the worthless git he usually was, but maybe that was the firewhisky talking. Lily had been keeping a watchful eye on Sirius and Remus throughout the night. There were certainly a lot of shared glances between the two of them, but the strangest part was when one of them was caught looking by the other, neither of them looked away. In fact, she paid extra attention to Remus, and it almost seemed like his whole face softened every time Sirius looked in his direction. Definitely not a trait of someone supposed to be angry with him.</p><p>There was something going on. Was this all an elaborate prank? What was the point of it all? Had Remus even been the one to give Sirius the black eye? Rolling her eyes, she began to wonder if she would ever understand James Potter or his mental group of friends.</p><p>Once everyone was good and drunk, someone got the brilliant idea to play a mix of spin the bottle and seven minutes in heaven, and Lily found herself immediately looking to James. With a huff, she announced that she wouldn’t dare be involved in anything so degrading, and she wondered if she imagined seeing the glimmer die in James’ eyes. She may have considered rushing from the room to hide her flushed cheeks.</p><p>But her mission wasn’t over – she was going to get to the bottom of whatever was going on, which meant that she couldn’t leave. When Remus decided to sit the game out, she knew her chance had come, but she decided to give it time. At the moment, he was staring daggers into Marlene, for reasons that were entirely unclear to Lily. A few couples took their turn, coming out of the room mussed and panting. Just as Lily decided she had seen enough, and started to head toward Remus, James Potter spun the bottle.</p><p>She froze, watching the neck of the bottle make circles. Her heart was in her throat, and she didn’t want to admit that she knew the reason why. The empty bottle slowed, slowed, slowed, landing on Mary MacDonald. Lily’s eyes widened, and she immediately slipped from the room.</p><p>Without thinking, she found herself at the door of the furthest end of the classroom, the same classroom that James Potter was about to step into, in order to snog Mary. Why was she doing this? James could kiss whomever he wanted. She certainly didn’t want it to have been her. <em>Did she? </em></p><p>Just before they entered at the back of the room, Lily crouched behind a large desk at the front, kicking herself for what she was doing. What did she expect to happen? James was going to kiss Mary – likely more than that – and she’d have to sit there and watch, and <em>listen</em>, to the whole thing. Yet, she stayed.</p><p>From where she sat, she could see everything through the legs of the desks in front of her. James walked into the room, pulling Mary by the hand, who was extremely red in the cheeks. Lily felt her cheeks go red, too. And then, nothing happened. James let his head fall forward, pulling his glasses off.</p><p>“Listen, Mary,” he said with a sigh. “Tell them whatever you want when we get out of here, but I can’t … do this. Not with you. I’m sorry.” Lily’s breath caught in her throat. He wasn’t going to kiss her?</p><p>“It’s okay, James. I think I understand,” Mary nodded, with a smile.</p><p>“Is it that obvious?” he winced, pinching the bridge of his nose, settling onto the top of a desk.</p><p>“Well, to everyone but her.” James let out a short laugh.</p><p>“Maybe it’s better she doesn’t know,” he sighed again, placing his glasses back onto his nose and running his fingers through his dark, messy hair. Her eyes may have caught the way his arm pressed against the seams of his shirt as he lifted it, and the tiny sliver of bare waist she saw as the hem raised.</p><p>“I think you should tell her,” Mary said, settling down onto the next desk.</p><p>“I don’t even know what I would say.” His breath fell out in steps, like he was nervous, and Lily began to wonder if she’d seen him take a drink all evening.</p><p>“Give it a shot. Practice on me,” Mary coaxed. James let out the breath he was holding.</p><p>“Lily, I’m in love with you.”</p><p> </p><p>Lily stopped breathing.</p><p> </p><p>“That sounds like the perfect thing to say, to me,” Mary said, patting him on the shoulder, as James buried his face in his hands, his breathing echoing through his cupped fingers.</p><p>“She hates me, Mary. If I tell her, she’ll laugh in my face.”</p><p>“She didn’t seem to hate you tonight.”</p><p>“But then she disappeared!” James shouted dramatically, throwing his hands in the air. Mary covered the giggle that escaped from her mouth. “I was hoping to get her in here and tell her everything, but my whole plan went underwater. As usual.”</p><p>“I’ve got it!” Mary shrieked, nearly sending James flying off the desk. “Remus and Sirius.”</p><p>“What about them?” James asked, almost exasperatedly.</p><p>“Ask her to help you figure out how to get them to stop fighting.” James was silent – Lily couldn’t see his face, but she knew there was a light going off in his eyes. The one that usually meant trouble.</p><p>“That’s perfect,” he breathed out, in a whisper, followed by shouting. “Mary, that’s perfect!” Taking Mary completely by surprise, he leaned over and hugged her. “Thank you.”</p><p>“What should I tell everyone outside?” she asked as they pushed themselves off their desktops.</p><p>“One second,” James said, and Lily sat in complete confusion as James began to run in place, jump up and down, do jumping jacks, do a set of push-ups (which Lily pretended she wasn’t impressed by).</p><p>“What are you doing?” Mary asked.</p><p>“Tell them you snogged me within an inch of my life,” he said, breathing hard. Lily also pretended that his labored breath wasn’t causing a deeper blush to form underneath her skin. “Then when I follow you out, I’ll look the part.” He grinned, his trademark, James Potter grin, and Lily swallowed hard.</p><p>As they swung the door open, there was whistling and howling, and she distinctly hear the slapping of skin in a high-five, to which she rolled her eyes heavily.</p><p>For a moment, she just sat still. James was in love with her? Since when? Sure, he’d asked her out all those times in fifth year, but he was just showing off back then. He had just done it to irritate Severus. And, alright, so he liked to follow her around and annoy her, and he seemed to always find her line of sight in a crowd, and lately it seemed like his face brightened when he noticed her looking at him, and …</p><p> </p><p>Oh, God.</p><p> </p><p>James Potter was in love with her.</p><p> </p><p>Just when she was about to get up and run all the way back to the Gryffindor Common Room, she heard Marlene scream from the other room.</p><p>“No, you can’t!” Lily strained to hear more. Something was mumbled in reply, she couldn’t hear it.</p><p>“They need to get this out, whatever it is.” It was James’ voice. Was he talking about Remus and Sirius? “Maybe they should just let it come to blows one more time and it’ll be over.” It had come down to this – the two of them were going to have an all-out brawl, over whatever it was they were so furious with each other. As the door to the empty classroom shut again, she froze, realizing that Remus and Sirius were about to duke it out, and she had no way to escape.  Lily held her breath, watching as the two friends stood facing each other.</p><p>“Make it rough, Moony,” Sirius finally said, his voice rich and low. “They’ve got to believe it.” Lily’s eyebrows furrowed. What did that mean? Remus quickly closed the gap between them, bringing his hand up to Sirius’ neck. A quick gasp slipped into Lily’s throat, and she covered her mouth to conceal it.</p><p>Remus spoke – his voice rumbled, deeper than Lily had ever heard him speak, and the words he used terrified her. “Do you want me to hurt you, Sirius?” he asked, pushing his thumb up underneath Sirius’ chin and forcing his gaze up to the ceiling. Never had she seen Remus act so cruel.</p><p>“<em>Yes.</em>” Lily’s jaw fell open, as Sirius’ voice quivered. He <em>wanted</em> Remus to hurt him? Without a second thought, Remus shoved Sirius against the furthest wall, at the same time, slamming his open palm next to Sirius’ face. From where she was sitting, Remus’ back was to her, she couldn’t see either of their faces. Suddenly, Remus began punching the wall in the same spot – his knuckles looked raw every time he drew his fist back. She almost cried out to make him stop before he hit Sirius with one of those punches. In fact, she had just begun to move out from behind the desks to stop it, she had to stop it. As she moved toward them, she froze, her hands flying up to her lips to stop any sound. They weren’t fighting.</p><p> </p><p>They were <em>snogging</em>. Really, heavily, <em>explicitly</em> snogging.</p><p> </p><p>Lily tiptoed carefully back to her place behind the row of desks, but she couldn’t take her eyes away from them. When did <em>this</em> happen? Remus’ hands were on Sirius’ hips, pulling him against his own, and their mouths were so deeply intertwined, she wasn’t sure how they could ever be separated.</p><p>“I need you to yell for me, love,” Remus panted, his hand pressed into the wall high above Sirius’ head, and Sirius let out more of a moan than a yell, driving his hands into Remus’ hair.</p><p>“Is this what you’re like when you’re drunk?” Sirius laughed, with Remus’ lips on his throat. “God, I should get you drunk more often.” Remus tugged at Sirius’ tie. When Remus spoke, his voice was gravel and stone, Lily had never heard him sound so untamed.</p><p>“Drunk,” he agreed. “And frustrated as <em>fuck</em>, because of you.” Lily’s eyes widened. Never, in the entire time they had been at Hogwarts, had she heard Remus swear before this moment. Now she knew what he was saving it for – he was practically tearing the clothes from Sirius’ skin. “And fucking Marlene McKinnon thinks she can have you.” Lily pursed her lips together to keep from laughing – now she knew why he had been giving Marlene death glares all night. She’d been flirting with Remus’ boyfriend. Is that what they were? Boyfriends? Or was it more like friends with benefits?</p><p>“You’re the only one who can have me, Moony,” Sirius replied, with a song in his voice, and Lily was sure she hadn’t ever heard him sound so happy. She certainly hadn’t ever heard him pledge his fidelity to any one person before – obvious now, it was because he had been waiting for Remus. “But I’m not going to pretend that I don’t absolutely love this. Does jealousy always make you this rough?”</p><p>“I’d rather not test it,” Remus said, his voice mumbled from where his teeth were pulling at the collar of Sirius’ shirt. “Because I feel like I could rip you apart right now.” Lily blinked slowly – this was definitely a side of Remus she’d never seen before.</p><p>“Fucking hell, I’d <em>let</em> you, Moony,” Sirius groaned, grabbing Remus’ face and kissing him desperately for a moment, before Remus pulled him away from the wall. Softly, he held Sirius by the chin.</p><p>“Ready?” he asked, and Lily’s eyebrows furrowed. Ready for what? Whatever it was, Sirius nodded, and Lily leaned forward in suspense. Remus slapped Sirius as hard as he could. Lily flinched at the sound.</p><p>Sirius clenched his teeth, hissing as he pulled in a breath, letting it out slow. “God, I really am a masochist,” he laughed, holding his hand over his reddened cheek. “I’ve never been more attracted to you.”</p><p>Remus moved Sirius’ hand, kissing softly onto the place he just inflicted pain. “Please don’t make me do this all the time.” Finally, Lily could recognize the familiar, easy tone of Remus’ voice, and she may have breathed a sigh of relief at hearing it.</p><p>“No promises,” Sirius smiled, the most genuine smile she’d ever seen on his face, as he gently pressed his lips against Remus’ again. “Can I at least rough you up a bit?”</p><p>The look on Remus’ face was golden. “Please do.” He held his arms out to his sides, as if to tell Sirius he could do anything he wanted to him. First, Sirius’ fingers went into his hair, and Remus’ eyes fluttered closed – Lily had never seen him so relaxed, so comfortable. When Sirius pulled at the neck of his sweater, he opened a single eye to look down at him. “Careful, I like this jumper.” But when Sirius’ lips found the skin of Remus’ neck, he let his eyes roll back, let his head roll back, face to the ceiling. Lily heard him sigh.</p><p>Sirius took a step back. “Do you want me to hit you?” He tilted his head as he looked Remus up and down, as if he were judging his outfit. Remus was silent, but Lily could tell he was considering it.</p><p>“Can we fake it? I’m still sore from last night.” He raised his arms over his head to stretch as Lily blushed, at first trying not to wonder what it was he was sore from. Until she remembered that the full moon had been last night. Remus’ lycanthropy was a secret, by all accounts, but she arguably paid more attention to the Marauders than was healthy, pretending it wasn’t because of their fearless leader. She hadn’t told anyone else about her discovery – and she never would. Nobody outside those four boys needed to know.  </p><p>“Come here, then,” Sirius smiled, holding Remus by the jaw and pinching the skin over Remus’s left cheekbone in a few places until it turned bright red.</p><p>“Do I look as beat up as you?” Remus quipped at the black eye he had given Sirius – Lily began to wonder if Remus had even been the one to give it to him, or at least, what the situation had been then.</p><p>“Well, yeah,” Sirius huffed, his eyes falling down Remus’ torso, settling just below Remus’ belt, a bright pink flush spreading through his cheeks. “But it looks like you really enjoyed it.” The blush on Sirius’ cheeks spread to Lily’s, and she held her cold fingers over her face to calm it.</p><p> “Can’t pretend that I didn’t.” Remus’ smile was wicked, his hand slipping over his zipper, moving himself underneath it. Lily’s face felt like it was on fire. Sirius’ expression slacked.</p><p>“Jesus, Remus,” Sirius hissed, immediately stepping over and taking Remus by the neck, pulling him into a fitful kiss. “You can’t just touch yourself like that and not expect me to want to bury my face in it.”</p><p> </p><p>Remus laughed, Lily’s mouth dropped open, and Sirius put his fist into the wall.</p><p> </p><p>“Ready?” Remus asked. Sirius moved his hips, his legs, his expression.</p><p>“Not really, but if I don’t get out of this room, everyone outside is going to get an earful of me fucking you into the wall.” Lily wondered if there was steam coming from her ears. Sirius and Remus were not only snogging – they were shagging. And everyone thought they hated each other. At Sirius’ blunt comment, she watched Remus swallow hard, and it made her think that maybe they weren’t yet shagging, because it seemed that the thought of it had provoked Remus in a way that she hadn’t yet seen.</p><p>As Remus threw Sirius from the room, the gasps told Lily that the people outside hadn’t heard any of the conversation in the room – only what sounded like a brutal fist fight. There was muffled speaking outside the door that she couldn’t make out, until Sirius shouted Remus’ name.</p><p>“We didn’t finish,” he said, and even from there, Lily could hear the breathlessness in his voice. As she heard him say it, she began to realize that everything the two of them had said earlier in the day, earlier in the party, could be completely misinterpreted. Neither of them ever admitted directly to being angry with one another or having animosity toward each other. Everyone else said it, and neither of them denied it. She remembered what Remus had said to her earlier. “<em>It’s really nobody else’s business</em>,” he had said bluntly, and <em>“It’s his favorite thing. To upset me</em>.” Remus hadn’t been talking about a fight, at all.</p><p>“I beat you, Black. You’re a mess.” Remus replied calmly.</p><p>“So are you.” Lily could imagine the expressions on their faces.</p><p>“Alright, fine. You want to finish this? Let’s go.” She heard Remus walk toward the door, and Sirius less than calmly following after him. The unknowing bystanders in the room tried to stop him, and Lily laughed about the desperation in Sirius’ voice, in trying to convince them to let him go. He convinced them by saying that he needed to face whatever Remus had in store for him. Lily snorted as she escaped the room.</p><p>Just as Sirius walked from the room, Lily walked back into it, and James’ eyes were on her immediately. With all that had just happened, she’d nearly forgotten what she’d heard James say, and when his hazel eyes met hers, she felt a rush of heat spread through her cheeks. After all she had just seen, and heard, she half-expected her blushing response to be destroyed, but there it was.</p><p>“James,” she said in a whisper, and she watched his jaw clench tightly in response, his chest suddenly rising with nervous breath. “I think we need to talk.” His eyes widened, he swallowed hard.</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong> <em> <u>Sirius</u> </em> </strong>
</p><p> </p><p>“Do you think James and Peter will come back?” Sirius asked as Remus pushed him up against their dorm room door, biting underneath the corner of his jaw.</p><p>“I don’t care,” Remus growled, sliding his tongue up Sirius’ neck, over his ear. Sirius responded with what could only be described as a purr, and the force of Remus’ lips increased.</p><p>“Tell me what you want, Moony.” Sirius’ voice was deep, smooth, decided. Eyes wide and dark, Remus looked back at him, sliding both hands down Sirius’ waist, lifting him off the floor and wrapping Sirius’ legs around his hips. Without breaking his gaze, he pressed his hips further into Sirius’.</p><p>“What I want,” Remus replied, and Sirius had never heard his voice so low, so desperate. “Is to make you come,” he paused, gripping tight onto Sirius’ hips and thrusting hard into him. “Again.” Remus pushed Sirius’ hair to the side, and Sirius turned his head to let Remus at the bare of his neck. “And again.” Sirius let out a hiss between clenched teeth as Remus bit down. “And again.” At that, Remus let Sirius slide down his hips, just a bit, before thrusting into him again, their hardened cocks grinding against the fabric between them.</p><p>“Fuck, Moony. <em>Fuck</em>,” Sirius growled, tearing the sweater from Remus’ shoulders.</p><p>“And then, when you’re right on the edge,” Remus breathed out, slowly pulling at Sirius’ tie, working down the buttons of Sirius’ shirt. “When your skin is slick with sweat, and your cock is in my mouth, and you’re begging me to let you come,” Remus continued panting hard into Sirius’ ear, sliding his fingers agonizingly slowly down Sirius’ waist, with Sirius’ breathing becoming more uneven and ragged with each breath. Before he could finish, Sirius turned and put his lips over Remus’, sliding his tongue deep into Remus’ mouth, and moaning every frantic breath into him. At that, Remus seemed to come unhinged – when their lips parted, the breath fell from Remus’ lungs, gritty and divided and dangerous. “God, I want to fuck you, Padfoot.” His voice shook.</p><p>“<em>Jesus</em>. Then fuck me, Moony,” Sirius voice rose in impatience as he pushed Remus’ face toward the ceiling, working his lips all the way down to the curve of Remus’ neck. And Remus let him suck, let him sink his teeth in, and didn’t seem at all concerned whether James or Peter or Lily would see any mark left behind.</p><p>As Remus slipped his hands underneath Sirius’ legs, and carried him over to Remus’ four-poster, Sirius didn’t once let his lips stray from Remus’ throat. They remained on Remus’ skin until Remus let him fall onto the bed underneath him. With a ravenous look in his eyes, Remus crawled over where Sirius lay, and Sirius watched him with rapt attention as Remus enclosed them, whispering a precautionary Silencing spell.</p><p>Though Remus eyes never left Sirius’, once his attention was back in full, they traveled across Sirius’ bare chest and every mark that came with it. The freckles still left over from the summer he’d spent with James, the scar that his father had given him as a souvenir when he had fled his childhood home, the love marks that Remus had bitten into his skin that hadn’t yet faded. Teeth marks from the Wolf that lived inside Remus.</p><p>With a careful smile, Remus’ eyes darted back up to Sirius’, as he bent, watching Sirius closely as he pressed his lips to Sirius’ chest. Sirius darted his tongue out to wet his lips, letting his head fall back onto the pillow, as Remus’ mouth sank lower and lower, and his hands rid Sirius of his trousers.</p><p>“Do you know how many times I imagined doing this to you, Pads?” Remus asked coyly, slipping off his own trousers, as Sirius arched his shoulders, his head sinking back further.</p><p>“Tell me, Moony,” he hummed. Listening to the sound of Remus’ voice, particularly in this manner, in this tone (often with his words mumbled by Sirius’ cock), was one of Sirius’ favorite things.</p><p>“Every minute of every fucking hour,” Remus growled, curving his mouth, hot and wet, around the arc of Sirius’ waist. “Every time I watched you put your hair into a bun with your wand, every time you came out of the shower in just a towel, every time we ran from Filch and you’re as breathless as you are now.” His tongue swirled around Sirius’ jutting hipbone, dipping down into the crease at Sirius’ leg, and Sirius bent himself backward trying to give Moony more skin to tease.</p><p>“More, Moony. God, give me more,” he whined. “Tell me what you wanted to do to me back then.”</p><p>“<em>Oh</em>,” Remus’s laugh echoed into Sirius’ skin, as he pushed Sirius’ legs further apart, still working his way down, inside. “The filthiest things you can imagine, Pads. I wanted you in every fucking way.” His mouth worked rhythmically at the skin of Sirius’ inner thigh.</p><p>“Goddammit, <em>tell me</em>, Moony,” Sirius begged, his voice hoarse, as Remus whispered a few spells into Sirius’ skin, and Sirius felt a rush of warmth and cold, all at once, in the places he wanted Remus to be.</p><p>“I wanted you just like this, Padfoot,” Remus purred, leisurely sliding his arms underneath Sirius, and turning him onto his knees, his hands at Sirius’ arse, angling his hips upward. “I wanted to taste every part of you.” Remus’ mouth moved up the back of Sirius’ thigh, he pressed his lips at the tight ring of muscle, and Sirius fell apart, his breathing tattered and destroyed. Once Remus darted his tongue out, lapping at Sirius’ entrance lightly, Sirius couldn’t hold the shouting moan that tore from his lips.</p><p>Remus paused for just a moment. “I wanted to fuck you in every way, and I wanted you to curse my name as I made you come.” His warm breath fell between Sirius’ legs. He whispered another spell, rubbed his hands together, and wrapped his fingers around Sirius’ cock – his hands were suddenly warm and slick, and Sirius gripped hard onto the sheets as Remus’ tongue found him again, swirling and dipping indecently into him.</p><p> “Fuck, Moony, fuck, <em>fuck</em>,” Sirius mumbled senselessly, a shameless moan filling every vowel as Remus lapped and sucked and drove his tongue deep into Sirius. Every moan from Remus’ lips sent a vibrating shudder into the base of Sirius’ spine, until his entire body shook, just as Remus promised he would. Every flick of Remus’ wrist, every thrust of Remus’ tongue sent Sirius’ vision white, until he was shouting Remus’ name, over and over, his voice fading and his breath failing.</p><p>Just as he hissed the last, drawn-out syllable of Remus’ name, on the very edge of coming apart, Remus pulled away from him, pushing him onto his back and settling a very heavy hand on Sirius’ chest. Sirius looked up at him, Remus’ chest was <em>heaving</em>. He slid his slicked hand along his own cock, swallowing hard.</p><p>“Merlin, I <em>need </em>to fuck you,” he said, his face flushed and his voice trembling. Sirius didn’t even pause.</p><p>“Do anything to me, Moony,<em> anything</em>,” Sirius growled, every inch of skin throbbing. Instantly, Remus aligned his hips, Sirius’ legs wrapped around his waist, and Sirius could feel him slowly pressing in, widening him, and Sirius was taking him, taking him, pulling him in further. As Remus pressed in full, they both took in a sharp breath, and Remus’ eyes went soft as he looked down at Sirius.</p><p>It wasn’t the first time, but Remus was just as timid as he was when it <em>had</em> been the first time, sliding in and out of Sirius gently, tenderly, carefully, but clutching hard onto Sirius’ hips and digging his fingernails into Sirius’s skin, as if to try to hold himself back. With a smirk, Sirius locked his feet behind Remus’ back and pulled him in, pulling a tight moan from deep in Remus’ throat as he raised his head.</p><p>Remus’ eyes found Sirius’, and he spoke, his voice muted. “I don’t want to hurt you, Sirius.” Sirius’s smile still in place, he took Remus’ hand and wrapped it around his cock, pumping himself with Remus’ fingers.</p><p>“You couldn’t if you tried,” Sirius’ voice sang out, vivid and rich, as he arched his spine into Remus’ touch, into Remus’ cock still buried within him. The bright, amber color of Remus’ eyes burned as his eyelids fluttered closed, his fingers tightening round Sirius’ cock, as Sirius’ own hand slipped away.  </p><p>Remus smiled, but it was no longer his casual, reserved smile – it was the smile that Sirius alone was allowed to see, the vagrant, fixated smile that usually meant Sirius needed to get him alone rather quickly. It was the same smile that Sirius had found on Remus’ face during their private DADA lessons, the same smile that Remus would give him the morning after a full moon. That smile folded into Remus’ teeth as he bit down, and pushed his hips hard into Sirius’, to which Sirius responded with a moan he couldn’t keep down.</p><p>Breathless, Remus snarled, his canines glinting. “Is this what you want?”</p><p>“Yes, fuck. <em>Harder</em>, Moony,” Sirius gasped, his voice calloused with too much breath. Remus complied, pulling out nearly completely before thrusting his cock into Sirius again. His deft fingers worked the shaft of Sirius’ cock with precision, gliding his thumb over the head with every stroke, and Sirius fitfully screamed, and cursed, and moaned, until his throat could make no more sound. Sirius’ hand shook as he scraped his fingers down Remus’ scarred chest, taking Remus’ free hand in his own and bringing it to his lips. His tongue darted out, slipping in between Remus’ two middle fingers, as he drew them into his mouth.</p><p>“<em>Oh</em>.” The sound shuddered from Remus’ throat. His eyes moved guideless over Sirius’ skin, his hips moved in rhythm to his hand on Sirius’ cock – the same rhythm of Sirius’ mouth, sucking on Remus’ slender fingers. As Sirius lapped his tongue between Remus’ knuckles, Remus’ eyes were immediately drawn to Sirius’ mouth, Remus’ own mouth falling agape as he watched the obscene movements of Sirius’ lips. With his eyes on Sirius’ lips, Remus buried himself into Sirius again, and again, harder and faster.</p><p>With only a few more thrusts, Sirius began to writhe underneath Remus – his mouth fell open noiselessly, and Remus’ fingers hung emptily in their place. On the verge of orgasm, the whole of Sirius’ body aching and trembling – Remus went motionless. His hand lay still on Sirius’ cock, his hips began to move back, slipping himself just out of Sirius. And the expression on Sirius’ face was tortured.</p><p>“You know what I want you to say,” Remus bargained, his voice hollow as he dragged his forefinger along Sirius’ bottom lip. Sirius bit down on it. “Say it, and I’ll let you come.”</p><p>Sirius opened his mouth to whine, but his voice was empty. He looked up at Remus with a pitiful gaze, but the lecherously wicked smile on Remus’ face told him he would get no sympathy. Instead, Remus took Sirius’ hand and returned his affection, sliding Sirius’ finger deep into his mouth, up to the knuckle. His tongue swirled around Sirius’ finger for a moment, before he pulled Sirius from his mouth, pressing two of Sirius’ fingers taught against his lips. At the skin between Sirius’ fingers, Remus slipped his tongue through, back and forth, and Sirius clawed at Remus’ chest, begging silently. Finally, Remus shifted his hips, brushing the tip of his slick cock against Sirius’ arse, teasing at the entrance, still lapping at Sirius’ fingers with his tongue.</p><p>“Please,<em> Remus</em>!” Sirius shouted, in more of a whisper, and Remus groaned gratefully.</p><p>“Say it again,” he demanded, breathing shallow.</p><p>“<em>Remus</em>,” Sirius accommodated in a quivering tone.</p><p>“Oh, fuck,<em> yes</em>,” Remus growled, shoving himself deep into Sirius, and Sirius used what little voice he had left to let out a loud, prolonged moan, in the shape of Remus’ name. With Sirius’ slicked fingers in his own, Remus wrapped both hands around Sirius’ cock, and Sirius curved into the stimulation.</p><p>“Gods, <em>Remus</em>, please. Say something, please.” Sirius’ voice came out ragged and raw. “Please.”</p><p>Remus shuddered, his pace quickened as Sirius spoke, his whispered voice strained. “Merlin, I love it when you beg like that. I’m so fucking close.” He dug his fingers into Sirius’ hip. “Beg for it again.”</p><p>“Harder,” Sirius whined immediately. His cock twitched, as Remus’ hips did the same. “<em>More</em>.”</p><p>“You’re close, too, Pads. I can feel it, God, you’re so hard.” Remus’ fingers tightened around Sirius’ cock, and Sirius responded by throwing his head back against the pillows underneath him.</p><p>“<em>Yes</em>, Moony, don’t stop.” His chest rose sporadically with racing breath. “Don’t stop.”</p><p>“I want you to come, I want to <em>make</em> you come.” Remus’ voice buzzed, his breathing erratic and rushed, but the movement of his hand steady and rhythmic. “I want it to be me. I want it to <em>always</em> be me.”</p><p>“<em>Yes</em>,” Sirius arched his neck, breathing out his reply. “Only you, I only <em>want</em> <em>you</em>.” Remus was speaking again, hurriedly, as if to convince himself to say it before his nerve ran out.</p><p>“Dammit, Sirius, I am so in lo- … Oh, <em>fuck</em>.” The guttural groan in Remus’ throat interrupted his thought, a shudder spreading through his spine as he came, and Sirius felt a soft heat fill him as Remus went still. But he was suddenly much more interested in what Remus had just been about to say.</p><p>“Remus.” His whisper was interrupted by an emptying groan as Remus slipped from him. “What …” he began to ask, but Remus quickly bent, and buried Sirius’ cock into his mouth. In the warmth of Remus’ mouth, and as stimulated as he had already been, he barely had time to shout Remus’ name before he was spilling out, white and hot, down Remus’ throat. Licking his lips, Remus looked up at him, an eyebrow raised.</p><p>He breathed out slowly through pursed lips. “That was …” He pressed a kiss to Sirius’ chest, leaving his lips to linger as he breathed in deeply. “Fuck.”</p><p>Sirius laughed, running his hand through Remus’ disheveled hair, letting his fingers ghost down Remus’ cheek. Remus leaned into his touch, closing his eyes. Though they hadn’t exchanged the words directly, Sirius knew what had been on Remus’ lips – because it was constantly on the edge of his own. As Remus opened his eyes, the color of the sun at dusk, and smiled in the way that only Remus Lupin could – quiet and reserved, but dominant and proud, all at once – Sirius knew. Of course, he’d known for some time. Truthfully, he knew before he’d ever even had the conscious thought. That he was ruined. That there was only, ever, Remus Lupin.</p><p>“Fuck,” he agreed.</p>
