    <p>Harry lay in bed. It was 11:55 on July 30 and he was moments from his 17th birthday. This summer had been both ok and horrible. It was ok in that over the last school year he had finally had a decent growth spurt. He was up to 5’9” and Vernon no longer seemed threatening. Not to mention he had become skilled in a number of wandless spells. Dudley hadn’t been much of an issue since the summer before fifth year with the dementor attack. On the bad side of things, he was missing Sirius something fierce. He also had not heard from his friends all summer. Letter after letter sent out and no replies. A wandless tempus, 11:57, he wasn’t planning on any gifts this year. Maybe Remus, and Mum Weasley would send him something.</p><p> </p><p>His thoughts, turned dark. All the people he had lost in the last couple years. Cedric, Sirius, Dumbledore, they were all dead. Ron and Hermione, even Neville and the twins, all seemed to be ignoring him. 11:59. He had to turn Ginny down himself. He wasn’t sure why but things never felt right with her. Midnight. “Happy Birth…” He didn’t get to finish his wish to himself as suddenly pain racked his body. At first he thought it was another attack from Tom. However, his scar was one of the few things not hurting.</p><p> </p><p>First, it felt like every bone in his body was being stretched. Then his muscles proceeded to writhe and contract painfully twisting his already painful bones. He was glad he had placed up silencing wards as he could tell by his raw throat that he was screaming. Next came a pain in his hands and feet as it felt like they were shifting and growing. His back, oh fuck his back felt on fire. Suddenly, he felt a massive tearing in his back saw blood and gore splash across the room. That pain was to much as his world suddenly went black.</p><p> </p><p>He awoke sometime later to a pounding headache, and a pounding on the door. As he groggily swiped for his glass, he growled as he heard a crunch where his hand hit. <em> Wait he growled, and no pain from any glass. </em> Finally he opened his eyes, fully and yet his room was clearer than ever. Looking at his hand, he was surprised to find it covered in emerald and sapphire scales and ended in claws. In a bit of a panic he went to roll over, and cried out as something caught on the bed and wall. Harry strained his neck to look over his shoulder. He bit back a curse when he saw large wings also covered by emerald and sapphire scales. Although, small obsidian scales covered the more membranous part of the wings. Upon seeing that, he pushed up till he was kneeling then stepped off the bed.</p><p> </p><p>Immediately, he conjured a mirror in front of him. First thing he noticed was that the emerald, interwoven with sapphire, scales covered every inch of skin he could see. Second his hair was longer and completely smooth and shiny. Also, he had to be at least six foot six. He had broad shoulders and his muscle mass had greatly increased. <em> On top of that, he had conjured a mirror effortlessly...how? </em> His wings touched both walls and were only halfway unfurled. His eyes had taken on a bit of a glow and were slit like snake or dragon eyes. From his head, just above his temples, sprouted two horns that swept back in a soft arc. Looking down he noticed his feet had shifted and sprouted talons. It took mere moments for him to take this all in. Harry had a choice to make. Answer the door like this, or try to change back then answer it. <em> Wait today he was 17. He was now an adult in the wizarding world and could leave. </em> Smirking, Harry moved to the door.</p><p> </p><p>An hour later found Harry sitting in the Leaky Cauldron. His things were in a room upstairs. He was sitting at a table by himself, chuckling as he tried to hold in stronger guffaws. When he had opened the door, not realising his new strength, he had torn the door off its hinges. Vernon who was bellowing at Harry, fell back against the wall eyes wide in fear. Petunia had fainted and Dudley was nowhere to be found. Shrugging his shoulders, Harry moved back into the room. He then closed his eyes and focused on looking human. Opening them again, he looked in the mirror once more. He was back to human alright, and anyone could tell it was him by the scar. However, he was still around six foot four and probably 210-220 lbs of rippling muscle. He looked like a player from american football.</p><p> </p><p>He had gathered his things quickly. Vernon was still frozen as he walked out the door and called the Knight Bus. Harry asked for the Leaky Cauldron and they shot off. He trusted Hedwig to come find him. No one on the bus, nor anyone in the tavern had recognized him. His new size plus the longer hair covering his scar helped with that. So he sat there, drinking tea, and eating breakfast, laughing in his new found freedom. Suddenly, an owl flew in and dropped a letter right on his plate. Luckily, he had finished. The owl flew off without waiting as Harry opened the parchment.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> To Lord Harry James Potter-Black, </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> It has come to our attention, that you have come into your inheritance this day of your 17th birthday. As we no longer need to go through your magical guardian, we request your presence to meet with your account manager Nograk. There is much that needs brought to your attention and we are sure you have questions. Come at your earliest convenience. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> With regards, </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Griphook </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Gringotts Manager. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Harry sat back in surprise once more. <em> Lord? Since when was he a lord, and what is this about a magical guardian? Well no time like the present. </em> Making sure he had his wand and Gringotts key, Harry made his way out of the tavern and off to the bank. As he came closer to the guards outside, he noticed that he could now sense them in a way he had not before. It was like whatever he was could recognise them as fellow creatures. They apparently could sense him too. He bowed his head and as the knowledge came to the front of his mind, he greeted them in Gobbledegook.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “{Blessed day to you, I am friend. May your enemies bleed from a thousand cuts.}” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>The guards seemed taken aback, but nodded and gestured inside. Continuing on his way, Harry came to the large front desk.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “{Well met, Griphook. May your vaults be overflowing. I received a missive to meet with Nograk.}” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “{Lord Potter-Black, we have been expecting you. Please offer a drop of blood to confirm who you are.}” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Harry extended a claw and pricked his finger allowing a single drop to fall on a piece of parchment. When it fell, a flash of magic sprung up and the parchment revealed his full name.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “{Right this way Lord Potter-Black. We have been trying to reach you for some time.}” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Harry was led down a long hallway, before being ushered through a rather opulent door. Inside, a rather royally dressed goblin sat behind a well crafted desk. The walls were lined with bookshelves and in between hung weapons of fierce construction. Harry often forgot that goblins were considered a warring race. The goblin was standing and gesturing before him.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “{Lord Potter-Black, please be seated we have much to discuss. A few things we should discuss today. First, you should take an inheritance test, it will let us know what you are as well as what lordships and other titles you can claim. Second, there are discrepancies in the accounts we already know you claim. We have tried reaching you ever since, your godfather’s will was brought forth. However, all attempts were sent back to us by your magical guardian claiming everything was fine, we even have notes with your signature stating such.}” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “{Ok what will, also what magic guardian. I have never been told of any of this.}” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “{We were afraid of this. Albus Dumbledore was your guardian, although come to think of it, I am sure your parents had a will as well. Before the inheritance test, we should have both brought forth and read.}” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Harry nodded, and Nograk called another goblin inside. He was dispatched to bring forth the two wills. Moments later the goblin came back.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “{The wills are sealed Lord Nograk. I could not retrieve them.” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Nograk moved to say something but was interrupted as Harry roared.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “{Who the fuck sealed those without making sure I had seen them. You will fix this or there will be retribution.}” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Harry took deep breaths to try and calm down. When he opened his eyes again, before him were two bowing goblins. Completely forgetting gobbledegook for a second, he stammered out.</p><p> </p><p>“Umm, what..why are you bowing, get up get up please.”</p><p> </p><p>After raising their head the two looked at harry. He then realised he had let out his creature form in his rage. He quickly calmed himself, but he didn’t shift back just yet. It was Nograk who responded.</p><p> </p><p>“Well Lord Potter-Black, we know what creature you are. You are a draken and by your colors you are of a royal lineage. The Draken have always been first amongst magical creatures. You are the first to be seen in the last century. Yes, of course we will rectify this situation. Sharptooth take word to King Ragnok, he will want to see this.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry shifted quickly as he slumped into the chair behind him. <em> A draken, and he was some sort of creature royalty, what the bloody hell. Merlin’s balls this was a lot to take in. </em> Straightening himself he peered over at Nograk.</p><p> </p><p>“So what does this mean. Who sealed those wills? Oh, sweet Circe this is a lot to fathom.”</p><p> </p><p>“Do not worry overmuch Lord Potter-Black. We should start the inheritance test now. By the time we finish, the King of the Goblin nation, and the wills should have arrived. Now please, I need you to let seven drops of blood fall onto the parchment. It has been treated with a potion that will react to your blood.”</p><p> </p><p>So Harry once again pricked himself with a claw, and let seven drops fall before his magic sealed the wound. With a bright blue flash, words began to appear across the parchment.</p><p> </p><p>

  <b>Mates</b>
</p><p>Unknown-Neko</p><p>Unknown-Veela</p><p> </p><p>Harry sat back, head spinning. He was Merlin’s heir, bloody hell. Professor McGonagall was his godmother, did she even know? He had mates, what did that even mean. <em> Breathe, Harry breathe. </em></p><p> </p><p>“Well Lord Potter-Black, it would seem that is how you are a draken. Heir to Emrys indeed, Merlin was the first draken granted the boon of an ancient dragon he healed with his magic. It is often overlooked by modern wizards and their often prejudiced ideals about creatures. You are as powerful as he was. Yet you may face similar prejudices. Enough of that, would you care to claim your Lordship rings now?”</p><p> </p><p>Harry sat up and collected his thoughts. He settled his breath. “Yes, let’s do that. Thank you Nograk.”</p><p> </p><p>“It is an honour.” Nograk made another deep bow before snapping his fingers and four wooden boxes appeared on the desk. “Let us start with the Potter ring, as that will assuredly accept you.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry opened the first box. The Potter ring was fairly simply, a gold band that thickened at the top. There the Potter crest, that of a roaring lion sat. It’s eyes were two inset rubies. As he slid it on his finger, a warmth flooded through him. It was like coming home, peaceful and happy. It shifted size to fit his finger better. Next came the Black ring. It was formed from some sort of black metal. The black crest was at its top. Three ravens flying over crossed wands, one eye of each raven was inset with a amethyst. Slipping it on another finger, he felt cold magic sweep over and through him. It was not unpleasant, more like dipping into the Black Lake. With that, it settled and shifted to fit his finger. <em> Two down, </em> he thought.</p><p> </p><p>When he opened the next box he was surprised. A thick gold band, no jewels and the crest was interesting. A triangle, inset with a circle and split in two with a line. This time when he slipped it on, he felt a chill pass down his spine and suddenly three men stood in front of him. One held a wand, one a stone, and one wrapped in a cloak. The one with the wand spoke.</p><p> </p><p>“This is the Elder wand given to me by Death and first of the Deathly Hallows. Have you ever used violence other than to protect yourself or your loved ones? Have you ever injured an innocent to pursue your own goals? Would you heal an enemy, if you knew that doing so might mean they still try to bring harm to those you care about?”</p><p> </p><p>Harry thought about this long and hard. “I do not like violence, I have felt guilty every time I have ever used spells to attack another. I used to want to be an Auror, but now having faced battle… well I would much rather lay down my wand or only raise it to help others from here on out. I feel responsible for each life that I could not save, or who died because Voldemort wanted me. I have retaliated, not always with the purest of intentions, to those who have hurt me and mine. I never liked it and I take great pains in not doing it again.”</p><p> </p><p>The man bowed. “Then this belongs to you. May it serve you well. It will never turn from you so long as you hold to those ideals. It is powerful and men covet it. However, if you are careful, you shall be its last owner.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry felt a weight settle in his hand. Looking down he found the wand in his hand. He could feel energy thrumming beneath the surface. Then the man with the stone was speaking.</p><p> </p><p>“This is the Resurrection stone. With it, you could see your loved ones, but to do so holds them in the plane a mere mirage of those you love. Would you waste away your soul, holding on to those who have gone? Would you let them go and move toward the future?”</p><p> </p><p>Harry had to breath hard after that before settling himself. “As much as I would love to see and talk to those I have lost, I have people still in my life that need me. Like the Mirror of Erised, I can turn from this. I shall place it in a vault, I do not need the distraction of temptation.</p><p> </p><p>“They are always with you. You hold their memories in your heart always. Take care to remember that.” and so Harry felt the stone in his other hand. Then the last man spoke out.</p><p> </p><p>“Ah Harry, this one is already yours. You may have broken a few rules, but you have always used the cloak to do what you thought was right. Continue to do so and it will serve you well.” this time Harry felt nothing, but he knew the cloak had never left his pocket.</p><p> </p><p>As the vision ended, Harry found himself still holding the wand and stone. Nograk was staring in shock. “Lord Nograk, please place this stone in the Peverell vault. It need not see the light of day again.” He then placed the stone on the desk. He slid the elder wand into his wand holster next to his holly wand. “Well one more to go it seems.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry opened the last box and gasped. The ring inside was made of pure platinum and was in the shape of a dragon. As he reached for it, the ring unwound and the dragon reared up. The emeralds it had as eyes seemed to stare into his very soul. He held it gaze and kept his hand where it was. Slowly the dragon crawled forward. It sniffed at him and nipped at a finger. Finally, as if deciding Harry was worthy, it crawled onto his finger and settled into place. The wash of magic Harry felt swirling around him was immense. When it settled, he felt powerful, more so than ever before. Maybe, this was the power the Dark Lord knew not.</p><p> </p><p>The door to the far end of the office opened with a bang. In came a procession of fierce looking goblin guards. Behind them walking more sedately, was King Ragnok, behind him looking distraught was Griphook, in chains. Harry stood and bowed low. <em> “{Your highness, you honour me with your presence. May your riches know no bounds and all your enemies fall before you.}” </em></p><p> </p><p><em> “{Stand my Lord, it is I who should bow to you.}” </em> He did just that before continuing. <em> “{I must apologise on behalf of the goblin nation for our negligence and for the betrayal of this one.}” </em> pointing at Griphook. <em> “{This own sealed the wills, upon reading them to Albus Dumbledore. Dumbledore bribed him, with money that should have been yours. If you can forgive us for these actions, and knowing Griphook shall be punished, I would name you brother and kin to the goblin nation. We will offer you all support in what is to come. We only ask your support as well should we ever have need.” </em></p><p> </p><p>Harry stood in awe for a moment. Some instinct told him this was a great honour. He knew what conflict was coming. The might of the goblin nation on his side would mean a great deal.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “{There is nothing to forgive. A nation should not be judged for the actions of one. I am honoured by your offer and graciously accept. I swear to honour the goblin nation and offer my help should they need it. By Lady Magic, so mote it be.}” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “{I, King Ragnok, do swear that Lord Harry Potter-Black-Peverell-Emrys, is brother and kin to myself and the goblin nation in all but blood. I swear to honour him, and come to his aid should he need it. By Lady Magic, so mote it be.”} </em>
</p><p> </p><p>With that, a swirl of magic whipped through the room as Lady Magic blessed the oaths given. After the room settled, King Ragnok departed, his guards pushing Griphook before them. Harry shudder not wanting to know what was planned for the goblin. He and Nograk again sat at the desk. The goblin was grinning, a fearsome sight to behold, all teeth. Harry returned it in kind also showing as many teeth as he could and letting his fangs show. They concluded their business, and Harry promised to return soon to check out the familiar vaults. He departed, he noticed a change in the main entrance, and as he looked around he noticed goblins all offering him nods, well wishes, and those fearsome smiles. The other patrons stared and whispered not sure what was going on.</p><p> </p><p>It was as he stepped through the front door that it happened. He caught a glimpse of blond hair and a scent as someone brushed past him. <em> MATE! </em> his instincts screamed at him. Before he could turn around a hand grabbed his elbow and he felt a familiar tugging as if passing through a tube. They vanished from the spot, only to reappear elsewhere moments later. Harry let all his features out on full display with a growl. Instincts say his scales were natural protection against spells. His eyes found his target. <em> No, no it couldn’t be. His first mate was none other than… </em> Standing before him, hands held up, no wand in sight, head bowed in submission.</p><p> </p><p>“Lord Malfoy” he growled out. “I think kidnapping is illegal. Especially, when it’s the boy-who-lived.” He began to stalk towards Lucius. Harry was stopped suddenly by another scent and a soft voice from behind him.</p><p> </p><p>“Please, my lord, my dominant, please do not harm our mate. My Lucius, my love. Please.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry relaxed as a woman, a beautiful woman came into view to stand beside her husband.</p><p> </p><p>“Lady Malfoy, am I to understand that I am safe here. Me, Harry Potter, am safe in the home of Death Eaters.”</p><p> </p><p>She looked up at him then, as he let his features to revert to normal. She searched his face, and he swept his hair back revealing the scar that was still there. Lucius even looked up as she gasped.</p><p> </p><p>“How, you are not the boy my son tells us of?”</p><p> </p><p>“My birthday is today, I came into my inheritance. I was just leaving Gringotts when your husband grabbed my and disapparated us here. I learned many things there. One, I am a draken of Emrys’s line. Two, I am lord of four Ancient and Noble houses. Three, Dumbledore is not as pure as everybody thinks. Four, I have two mates, a veela and a neko, and every instinct in me is telling me its you two. So tell me, how is it, that magic saw fit to mate me with two people who hate me and what I stand for.”</p><p> </p><p>This time it was Lucius who spoke up. “Dominant, please sit listen to our story. I am not a death eater by choice.” Harry sat, his eyes suspicious and a spell on his tongue. “Those claims of being imperiused, yes they were lies, but I might as well have been. I went to the Dark Lord on my own at first. He was charismatic, and I had been raised on the ideals of blood purity and separation from muggles. Then, I came into my inheritance. Mine came late as my father had placed blocks on me. Blocks that kept it at bay. That is until the dark lord cruciod me and my magic needed to heal me. I am a veela, and he tortured me for it. I wasn’t pure anymore, but I was useful, my family had power.</p><p> </p><p>When I found my mate, the first time, the first time Narcissa was brought to me. It was an arranged marriage and she was younger than I. As soon as we could we slipped away to Gringotts to confirm some things. We found out we were both submissives. Our dominant mate was a draken. We have waited twenty years for you. Twenty years in which we were able to have a boy. Those loyal to the dark lord kept us under watch, kept us under threat if we did not act our part. Now he threatens our boy, you must have seen Draco this past year. Our lives were on the line if he did not fulfill his commands. We taught Draco in secret, he doesn’t believe in blood purity either, but we all have had to do what we must. Please, I beg you, forgive us, keep us safe.”</p><p> </p><p>“Is Tom here right now? Is Draco? You must come with me, right now. With Draco and only what you can carry. You must leave all this behind, at least until the war is over. I will not make you fight but you must promise to leave Riddle. If you can do that, then I believe you and we can work on this. I will give you a safe place to stay, but we must leave now.” He looked at them expectantly but not with malice. His new instincts told him that Lucius was sincere. It would take work but they were family now, he could feel it coming off both of them.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, yes we will go with you. Love go find Draco, have him pack a trunk. Only what is needed we can buy anything else. I’ll go pack our things. We will meet back here in ten minutes. Mitsy, Tippy.” Two house elves popped in. “Mitsy take Mistress to Draco then help them prepare. Tippy please apparate me to our room. Then stay with us I will have more instructions when we meet back here. Ten minutes, that is all we can take.” And they popped away. Harry disillusioned himself and stayed on alert. He knew Death Eaters were in the house, even if Voldy wasn’t. Sure enough less than ten minutes later three people and two house elves popped back into the room. Not able to help himself, Harry disillusioned himself directly in front of Draco who would have screamed if Harry hadn’t clamped a hand over his mouth.</p><p> </p><p>“Luc, Cissy, are we ready to go. Hello, Draco, we can explain once we are out of here. I need you to come here, I have a portkey.”</p><p> </p><p>Narcissa stepped over, grabbing his arm, but Lucius took a moment to bend down.</p><p> </p><p>“Tippy, Mitsy, you have served us well as have all our elves. We must leave for a time. Please hide yourselves. Tell the others. We will be back when we can. Until then keep our home safe. Keep each other safe. I promise we will return.”</p><p> </p><p>Then Lucius stood and came to grab Harry’s other arm. Harry pulled out the portkey, just as the doors burst open. “<em> Portus </em>” There was the familiar tugging at his navel, as the image of an enraged Bellatrix disappeared before him. Moments later, all four landed just outside the door of Potter Manor. He looked down at his mates.</p><p> </p><p>“Welcome home. Let’s go inside, we have much to discuss.”</p><p> </p><p>He led them inside, keeping a hand on Draco as well. Didn’t want the boy to get a shock or worse trying to get in. As soon as they stepped inside, they all got a surprise as a house elf popped up in front of them.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh dear, oh dear. Dopsy not be knowing, Lord Potter, master Dopsy is sorry, Dopsy not knowing new master be coming.” She moved to wring her ears but Harry shouted out.</p><p> </p><p>“Stop, Dopsy stop. I did not know I even had this manor until today or that it came with an elf or are there more of you. Potter elves to me.” There were multiple pops until six elves stood before them. “Ok, we have met Dopsy, who are the rest of you and what do you do.”</p><p> </p><p>“Bitsy be your cook Master.”</p><p> </p><p>“Wipsy be Head elf and nanny for babies”</p><p> </p><p>“Redan be groundskeeper”</p><p> </p><p>“Tipsy, Dipsy and Dopsy, be personal elves master.”</p><p> </p><p>“Ok, thank you all, I can tell you take care of this place. Bitsy I believe a bit of tea and biscuits would do. Then a late lunch. Redan, the grounds looked amazing, keep up the good work. Tipsy, you will help Draco, Dipsy, please take care of my mates, and Dopsy I will be taking you on as my elf. You three, we need three rooms prepared. Make sure mine and Lord and Lady Malfoy’s rooms are connected. Please place Draco nearby, until we can explore and he can pick his own room. Now Wipsy, no babies at the moment, but if you could lead us to the sitting room, then help Bitsy with lunch that will be most helpful. Now later tonight we will go over rules. No self punishment until we have that talk.”</p><p> </p><p>He turned to the Malfoy family, who were all staring at him a bit in awe and confusion. He gave his best charming smile, one side of his mouth pulling up a little higher than the other.</p><p> </p><p>“Everything ok? Shall we?”</p><p> </p><p>“Potter, did you just call my parents, your mates.” Draco was paler than usual.</p><p> </p><p>“Come on Draco, we can discuss this in the next room and if your gonna go by last names, its Potter-Black-Peverell-Emrys. I would prefer you call me Harry though.” Harry gave a smirk. “Wipsy, shall we.”</p><p> </p><p>Wipsy led them down a bit of hallway. It wasn’t Malfoy Manor, but it was well decorated. It had a homey quality that Malfoy Manor seemed to lack, though that might have been the charade that family had to present. Harry was in awe. This was his and if things worked out, he had people to share it with. Yes they were older, but one of the things Nograk had explained was that creatures lived far longer than even wizards and were able to have children longer as well. That was a weird thought. He knew submissives of both genders could bear children. He also knew instinctively, that while Lucius and Narcissa had Draco, no matter how much they tried they could not have another child until their dominant, him, came into their lives. He had always wanted a family, could this actually work out to give him one.</p><p> </p><p>They made it to the sitting room. It was decorated in warm shades of peach and cream colors. It was nice but he was redecorating to be more modern soon. It would do for now however. “Please, sit.”  Harry took an armchair as did Draco, while Lucius and Narcissa took a loveseat.</p><p> </p><p>“So Draco, yes I called you parents my mates. That is what they are. Look this is weird and awkward. I just came into my inheritance today and it came with so much information. I’ve been trying to wrap my head around things all day. Lucius explained all that’s been happening to your family and I couldn’t leave you all there. I wish I had taken your hand that first day, you just reminded me of my bully cousin, and i despise bullies. Plus Ron and Hagrid had already told me that all evil wizards come from Slytherin. You know the hate wanted to put me there, I had to beg not be be placed there. That idea changed after third year. Pettigrew was a Gryffindor and yet he gave my parents up to be murdered. I just want all three of you to know. The past is the past, I am over it, you’re forgiven. Please forgive me as well, especially you Draco.”</p><p> </p><p>Draco looked like he was about to speak, when Lucius suddenly gasped out in pain and fell to the floor. He was clutching his left arm. “It’s the mark.” Narcissa screamed out. “He’s trying to kill Lucius through it.</p><p> </p><p>Harry quickly pinned Lucius to the floor with his magic. He only did so to keep the man from thrashing. He then let instinct take over. He grabbed Lucius’s arm on either side of his arm and reached out with his magic. He could feel it, that dark energy pulsing into Lucius. It was attacking his mate’s core and it was killing him. He pushed his own magic deeper, wrapping it like a barrier around the dark magic. He then began pulling those dark strands up and out of Luc. Harry made sure he left his mate’s core intact as he fought Tom. He thought of the idea of having a family. He thought of his love for his friends, for Remus and Tonks, Ron, Hermione, Neville, and even Luna. He had family, people who loved and cared for him, and now he had more. With that thought, he pulled as hard as he could, pouring all that love into it, as if it was the most powerful patronus. Finally, the dark magic was gone, evaporated into thin air.</p><p> </p><p>Harry opened his eyes and released his magic hold on Lucius. The man sat up and ripped his sleeve up his arm. Everyone gasped as the skin was bare. Harry had magically burned the mark away, leaving bare arm. It was interesting being this close to Lucius, and Narcissa who had kneeled down beside him. They were beautiful, both of them. In her worry, some of Narcissa’s Neko traits had popped through. Those ears and tail were way to cute, for a woman who seemed to be made of ice most of the time. Lucius’s veela and his draken responded. Merlin, Lucius was pretty. Both looked at him in awe, and apparently his draken had come out in full. He could feel his wings wrapping around all three of them. He growled deep in his chest, comforting his mates. It was a promise to take care of them. He heard a responding trill from Lucius as well as a purring from Cissy.</p><p> </p><p>Suddenly, he remembered Draco and quickly pulled back his wing still they sat behind him. He turned to Draco with trepidation, but Draco rushed passed him to kneel by his father. He was amazed when Luc showed him the bare flesh on his previously marked arm. In a surprise gesture, Draco hugged his father tight before turning to Harry.</p><p> </p><p>“All is forgiven, if you already care enough to do that for my father, who am I to get in the way. Who knows, my own birthday is in a week. I might end up a creature with a mate as well. Just promise me I don’t have to call you dad or something equally disturbing.” Draco shuddered at the thought and Harry did to. Harry reached out a hand like Draco hand done nearly six years ago. “Lets just make it Harry, and maybe friend.”</p><p> </p><p>Draco shook the offered hand. “In that case call me Drake or Dray, all my true friends do.”</p><p> </p><p>They all took their seats again, though Harry now sat between Cissy, and Luc. They drank their tea and got to know each other. Wipsy came and got them at some point, practically demanding they eat the lunch prepared for them. Draco then pardoned himself to go explore a bit. Harry, Luc, and Cissy settled back on the coach. They talked about everything. Harry decided to lay everything out before them. They were horrified when he talked about how the Dursleys treated him. Cissy clung to him as he told of them of each school year. Luc held back a bit, not used to showing such emotion and affection. He let Harry throw and arm over his shoulder though. Finally, they were just talking about well anything.</p><p> </p><p>Wipsy came again and got them for supper. Draco was there, and they talked about his birthday coming up. Harry promised, if Draco gave him a list of friends he trusted and wanted there, that he would find a way to make it happen. They then made plans for all three Malfoys to get checked out at Gringotts just to be sure. Harry needed to go to Grimmauld Place, and settle a few things with the Order. He sent Dopsy to collect his things from the Leaky Cauldron. Then it was decided that a shopping trip was in order. Harry needed an entirely new wardrobe. All of the Malfoys needed things as well.</p><p> </p><p>Finally, it was time to go to bed. Draco said goodnight to his parents, giving his mother a kiss on the cheek. Once he was in his room, Harry showed Luc and Cissy there room. He mentioned that if they needed anything, he was just through the door. Cissy went up on tiptoe and kissed him on the cheek. Harry said goodnight and turned to leave but felt a hand on his arm. Luc pulled him back and gave him a chaste kiss on the lips. “Thank you, for saving my life and for saving my family. We can make this work.” Harry blushed as he mumbled that it was nothing and went to turn in. He lay there for an hour, tossing and turning. He heard the door open from his mates room and a soft “Harry” call out. He motioned his mates over to his bed, and the slipped under the covers with him. He pulled both of them to his chest, growling contentedly. Within moments all three of them were asleep. Tomorrow was a new start for all of them.</p><p><br/>
