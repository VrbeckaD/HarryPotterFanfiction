    <p>Walking out of Dumbledore’s office, Harry couldn’t help but let his eyes betray the anger that leaked out of his perfectly placed mask. His mask firmly in place as he walked quickly to the Owlerie. Tomorrow would be the day that Albus too many middle names Dumbledore would lose his power. As he entered the owlerie, he quickly set out to write three letters; one to Draco, one to Neville and the last to Chief Ragnok. To Draco he simply wrote <em>Its time</em>, trusting that Draco would understand the two words, he quickly sealed it and place it aside. To Neville, his Neville, he told him to meet him at Gringotts the day after tomorrow at 8:30. And finally to Chief Ragnok, he informed him that he would be coming in the day after tomorrow at 8:30 to claim his Lordships and emancipate himself. Leaving no room for questions, he called Dobby and had the overly excited elf deliver the letters. Sirius’ death proved to be the last straw, he remembered vividly as Dumbledore shot the green curse at Sirius. While the old coot thought no one saw, Harry saw perfectly and he watched as the man quickly escaped towards the atrium without anyone knowing he was there in the first place. 

As he turned and made his way back to the Gryffindor 
common room, he began to go over once more everything that has happened since his First year. <em>Why would he send Hagrid to pick up a muggle-raised wizard? It was his plan all along, Hagrid did nothing but spurt anti-Slytherin bullshit and praise Dumbledore and Gryffindor. Why didn’t Hagrid tell me more about the Wizarding world? Hermione and Ron. Gods those two are complete idiots. For someone who claims to be the Brightest witch, she could at least learn to put up some privacy wards. Although I knew that they were being paid to be my friends, it was nice to hear them say it out loud. The stone, the old coot set it up from the beginning. How is it that Dumbledore just conveniently disappears from the castle the same night that Voldemort goes after the stone? That bastard had my entire life planned from the beginning, to him I was nothing but a weapon that would be destroyed when the time came. There was a reason the hat wanted me in Slytherin, I’m naturally a snake. I’m glad Dumbledore sent that big oaf of a man to collect me when I got my letter. Because had he not gotten drunk off his arse, I wouldn’t have had the chance to go back to Gringotts and speak to Chief Ragnok.</em></p>

  <b>
    <em>Flashback</em>
  </b>
</p>
<p>After seeing Hagrid walk back towards the Leaky Cauldron, seemingly forgetting about him, Harry decided to follow his instincts and go back to Gringotts. He had a feeling that something wasn’t right and he was going to get to the bottom of it. Walking towards the nearest teller, he makes sure to mind his manners as he says “ Hello sir, can I speak to someone about my accounts please”</p>
<p>Peering over the counter with a light sneer, in a clipped tone the goblin says “ Name”</p>
<p> “Harry Potter sir” in a light whisper loud enough for the goblin to hear him. </p>
<p> “Follow me” the goblin says as he quickly walks to the Potter account managers office deep in the bank. With two quick knocks on the door, he enters followed by Harry. After a quck discussion, the goblin leaves Harry alone with Griphook. </p>
<p>« Two visits in one day, Mr.Potter to what do I owe the pleasure? »</p>
<p>« Well sir, call me crazy but after leaving the bank with Hagrid, something in mind told me that something wasn’t right about my accounts so I decided to comeback and see if I could figure out the problem »  Harry finishes a little out of breath.</p>
<p>« Well I can’t say that I’m surprised Mr. Potter, because over the past few years we have been sending out many owls for you and your guardian to come and discuss a few things but you haven’t shown up until today » The goblin responded.</p>
<p>« Owls sir? I never received any owls. And what do you mean by guardian? You mean you sent letters to my Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon letters?</p>
<p>A slight sneer appearing on his lips as he answers « No, your magical guardian Albus Dumbledore »<br/>
« Who is that »</p>
<p>« Excuse me? Are you telling me that Dumbledore hasn’t been handling his responsibilities?<br/>
« I’m sorry sir but I don't know who that is »</p>
<p>With a slightly aggressive growl, Griphook simply says « Mr.Potter, I think it would be best if you performed an inheritance test so that you can see what I’m talking about » Bringing out the materials, he tells Harry too prick his finger and allow three drops of blood to fall onto the parchment. After doing so, his eyes widen at what he sees:</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Hands shaking a little, he silently hands the parchment over to Griphook who begins to growl as he further reads the parchment. Quickly he summons the Potter Vault Statements and as he reads it over he becomes even more upset at what he sees.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <b>500 galleons a month to Arthur, Molly, Percy, Fred, George, Ronald and Ginevra Weasley.</b>

<p> </p>
<p>Silently he gets up and and leaves the room without so much as a glance in Harry or rather Harrison’s direction. Five minutes late he comes back with a much large Goblin who looks equally as upset as Griphook. After a few more minutes of talking, they look over at Harrison and simply say «  Mr. Potter we at Gringotts deeply apologize for your inconvenience and we would like you to know that we are going to do all that we can to rectify your problems and reclaim all the money »</p>
<p> </p>
<p>After considering what was just said for a moment, Harry tells them « Thank you for your support and I deeply trust the two of you to fix these problems. But I would ask that you don’t stop the money from being taken from my vault. I would like to see what these people are up too first before I decide to take my revenge. I would also like to wait to claim my lordships as well until I’m ready to make my move. As for the blocks can you take those off of me please take them off of me and also would it be possible for you to compose a list of all necessary books that I should read in order to be a proper Pureblood heir and eventual lord »</p>
<p> </p>
<p>At hearing that Harrison has his own plans for the thieves, they smirk violently and the larger goblin, Ragnok says « Certainly we can take the blocks off of you and give you something so that any compulsion charms and potions placed upon you will dissolve or become null immediately » With a smirk that could put the goblin nation as a whole to shame, Harrison begins to plan the downfall of Albus Dumbledore</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <b>End of Flashback</b>
</p>
<p>Walking into the room room, he immediately casts a disillusionment charm and silently walked towards the three people who’ll be in for a shock very soon.</p>
<p>“I swear if we weren’t getting paid for this” Rob say with disdain clearly in his voice. His friendship with Harrison has been nothing but fabricated on both sides. While he has been playing Harrison since their first year,Harrison has also been playing him. But unlike Ron, Harrison is much better at it. Since their first meeting, Harrison always knew that Ron was jealous of him. It was clear. But once he learns of Harrison claiming his Lordships, his jealousy will he even worse.</p>
<p>« I know » responds Ginny « But it’ll be worth it once we get married and I become the next Lady Potter »<br/>
Harrison couldn’t help but snort at her remark.Harrison only has his eyes set on one person and it definitely isn’t some chit who sleeps her way through all four houses. Since before she even started at Hogwarts, Molly repeatedly told Ginny that one day she would marry Harrison and become the next Lady Potter and be a rich, high society woman. Since her first year, she has been throwing herself all over Harrison much to his dismay. </p>
<p>« Its ok, Dumbledore says Harry is going to propose this summer and once you two get married and you get pregnant we can finally get rid of him »<br/>
Deciding that he heard enough, Harrison walks up to the dormitory and silently packs his trunk. He promises himself that after he claims his lordships he’s going to get himself a new wardrobe of nothing but the finest quality. For the past four years, Narcissa and Draco and been nagging him to get new things but he has been refusing because he didn’t want anyone questioning him. But their jaws are going drop once they set their eyes on his new wardrobe. </p>
<p>Sitting on the bed, Harrison closes the hangings and spells them shut and places a silence ward up and proceeds to cries his heart out for his godfather, the man who he’d just started calling dad five months ago. Gone. He cries for hours until he finally falls asleep.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Eyes snapping open with glee, Harrison silently casts a tempus and gets up. Walking through the dorm he notices that he’s the first one up and walks toward the showers. Off in his own world thinking about how much fun today and tommorow are going to be, he doesn’t even notice the other person that steps into the showers until he feels strong arms wrap around his waist and lips on his neck. Smiling knowingly, he thinks back to his third year when they finally got their heads out of their arses, much to Draco’s amusement, and confessed their feelings for one another. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Neville Longbottom has always worn a mask. He always let others think that he was some clumsy, borderline squib whose only talents was tending to his plants. That was until his first year when his bright brown eyes locked onto emerald green ones. The only person to see through that mask was Harrison. The only person to encourage him and see him for the Gryffindor that he was supposed to be. Quickly becoming friends on the train, Harrison decides to tell him everything since technically they are god-brothers, and Neville vows to do all he can to help Harrison. He tells Harrison about the mask that he puts up and why he does it. He likes to see who will truly be his friend or who will make fun of him. It wasn’t until their third year when Draco decided he was through with them tip-toeing around each other and locked them in an unused room and told them that he wasn’t letting them out until they « Pull you heads out of your arses » After a little bit of hesitation, they quickly confessed their feelings for one another and ended up snogging each other until Draco forced them apart 30 minutes later. Ever since, they’ve been inseparable. During the summer before their fifth year, Neville’s body transformed quite a bit. The 5’9 boy covered in fat, was soon replaced with a 6’2, broad shouldered, pure muscled man. His face went from soft and fatty to sharp, strong and chiseled. His aristocratic feature were only highlighted further by his haircut with frames his face beautifully. His new look got him a very thorough inspection that lasted for a few hours from his boyfriend.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He wiggles his arse a bit and smirks when he hears the small groan and feels the growing hardness on his back. Slowly, he wiggles out of Nevilles strong grip and walks away from him with a quick « Later » leaving his lips as he laughs at the expression on his boyfriends face.
 Leaving the bathroom, he quickly puts on his clothes and heads down to the Great Hall and eats a small breakfast and reads a book that he got from one of his vaults. Ignoring the glare of his favorite Potions Master, he quickly becomes annoyed when his « best friends » show up. He wasn’t even given the chance to say anything before Hermione roughly snatched the book from his hands and asks him where he got it and why didn’t she know he had it. His eyes widen a bit as the centuries old book is taken from his hands but he quickly takes it back and tells her that « First of all don’t take things from me. Second of all, I don’t have to tell you everything you’re not my mother » Leaving her there stammering for a retort, he packs his things and leaves. He doesn’t miss the amused smile on Neville’s lips as he makes his way back to the dormitory. But before he could even walk up the steps, he received a note from a second year, telling him to come to the Headmasters office and that he is very partial to sugar quills this time of year. Groaning, he makes his way to the headmaster’s office and knocks on the door.</p>
<p>After receiving an overly amusing « Enter » he walks in to the sight of Dumbledore long with the rest of the Order and to his disgust Remus. The same Remus who cheated on his godfather with Tonks and told Sirius that he was nothing but a « quick shag ». </p>
<p>With his Blue eyes twinkling, much to Harrison’s disgust, « Ahh Harry my boy have a seat. Lemon drop? »</p>
<p> </p>
<p>« No thank you Professor » Harrison responds almost immediately. He isn’t stupid, he knows those things are laces with compulsion potions and veritaserum. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Silently taking a seat off to the side, he lets off a quiet sneer as the headmaster tells him how important it is that he stays at his relatives house all summer because of the wards. The same wards that Harrison realized didn’t exist. With a polite « Of course Headmaster, I wouldn’t want any death eaters trying to attack me » Little to Dumbledore’s and the rest of the Order’s knowledge, Voldemort is dead and has been for the since the he left the graveyard after the Third Task last year. The think that attacked him at the Ministry was nothing but a poly juiced Lucius Malfoy who has been like a father figure to Harrison and helped him take down Voldemort. Harrison used a spell that he found to recall all of the horcruxes back to Voldemort. The sheer force of the renewed soul killed the snake like man. Not taking any chances, Harrison forced a dagger in his chest and pulled out the limp heart and burned it. </p>
<p>After assuring everyone that he was going to stay at his relatives house all summer, he quickly got up and with a vicious sneer in Remus’ direction, he left without another word. Walking with a quick pace back to the dormitory, he silently gathers his things, shrinks them and puts the trunk in his pocket. Making sure that he had everything, he didn’t here the footsteps approach him until he was roughly turned around and kissed violently. </p>
<p>“You’re going to regret what you did earlier” Leaning in closer, he whispers “I’m going to make sure you can’t walk for a week” Smirking when he hears the clipped moan. He walks away after grabbing Harrisons arse one last time. Laughing darkly he leaves Harrison alone in the room. Standing there in shock, all Harrison could think about was how this summer was going to be the best one yet.</p>
