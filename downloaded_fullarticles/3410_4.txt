  <b>September 1 – Hogwarts Express (Prologue)</b>
</p><p>“Draco, please, stop glaring at the students and get on the train!” Hermione said with an exasperated sigh as she peeked out of the window of the compartment she managed to occupy. Like every year, she was glad that she could sit in the wagon that was reserved for the teachers, prefects and head boys and head girls; it simply was more quiet and peaceful.</p><p>She had taken up the position as Professor of Transfiguration only a few years ago, at a moment when she didn't exactly know where she wanted to go in her life. It seemed like a good opportunity, so she accepted, to the relief of Headmistress McGonagall. By now, the students seemed to admire her for her fairness and considerate way of teaching.</p><p>“Draco, come on... You can scare the first-years when we're back at Hogwarts.”</p><p>“Just making sure that they hurry up— we don't need another case of a student missing the train because their parents couldn't let them go.” He turned around to smile at her, his scowl immediately softening as soon as their eyes met.</p><p>He had put on the official school robes for the day, even though Hermione suspected he mostly wanted to be treated with the respect he deserved as a Hogwarts professor. However, in his case, his reputation preceded him—having started his position as the Professor of Potions the same year as she had, he was by now known for being a stern teacher whose pedantic approach made the students groan more often than not. There was still an air of his dark past hanging around and a few rumours made rounds anew each year, so ever since the students had figured out that the two professors were dating, they preferred to go to Hermione with concerns. They didn't dare question Professor Malfoy on an essay or protest any points he had taken from them.</p><p>If only they knew that he was actually a rather soft-hearted person on the inside, with a romantic side that Hermione had never expected.</p><p>This was the man she was going to spend the rest of her life with—if he managed to get on the train before it left the station.</p><p>And just as she opened her mouth to tell him once more to finally join her in the compartment, the train tooted as a signal of imminent departure. To her relief, he sprinted towards the wagon door and climbed in, just as the train started to move.</p><p>“All aboard?” she asked as he joined her, closing the compartment door behind him.</p><p>“Yes, all aboard. Nothing hurries them up more than a stern look from their Potions teacher,” he replied with a smirk, just before he reached for her hand to bring it up gently. “But I'm glad to return. Finally getting back to work, so to speak...”</p><p>She saw his ardent smile as he had another look at the ring on her finger. She had been wearing it for almost two months now and it was still a thought she had to get used to; and so did he, given the happy smile on his lips.</p><p>Just as she wanted to pull him down for a kiss the door to the compartment was opened, causing them to move apart a few steps. Hermione relaxed when she saw that it was Neville, looking for a seat.</p><p>“I'm really sorry, guys, but every other compartment is full–”</p><p>“Longbottom, just sit down and take a breath,” Draco replied, sounding amused, and took his seat next to the window, facing backwards. He simply shrugged when Hermione sat down in the opposite seat and sent him a questioning glare just as Neville put his luggage in the overhead luggage rack.</p><p>“So, how was your research trip? You were in... South-East Asia, right?” Hermione asked when Neville finally found his seat and relaxed into it. “Did you find what you were trying to find?”</p><p>Neville laughed and nodded. “Oh yes! I've learned lots about how they use plants and herbs in their daily life and as medicine... I've brought back so many samples for the greenhouses, I actually had to ask McGonagall for permission to bring them all. The students are going to love the new stuff, and it might be something for your potions experiments, Malfoy.”</p><p>“Just let me have a copy of your notes, and then we can discuss anything further.”</p><p>“Don't blow the dungeons up again, like with your last experiment!” Hermione tried to keep her laugh under control but utterly failed at it. Draco's private study lab had looked like a bomb had exploded, and it took him a whole day just to get the remnants out of his hair again.</p><p>“No explosive stuff this time, I promise!” Neville said, lifting his hands defensively at Draco’s glare before both joined Hermione’s laughter at the amusing memory; their collaborations usually worked out to the benefits of the students.</p><p>“But now I'm curious,” Neville continued, leaning back with his head in his hand. “I heard a few snippets about an engagement while walking through the wagons–”</p><p>“The Weasleys must be updating their friends, I guess.” Draco shrugged, just as he gently ran his foot along Hermione's calf.</p><p>“It's true!” With a big, happy smile, Hermione lifted her left hand to display the engagement ring Draco had admired just minutes ago. “We're engaged!”</p><p>“Congratulations!” Neville got up to hug Hermione and offer Draco a proud handshake. “I vaguely remember something just before the End of Year Feast–”</p><p>“And I would rather forget it,” Draco said with a groan, shaking his head at Hermione, who just shrugged. “You wouldn't believe me if I told you what she actually did. Honestly, she'd make Salazar proud...”</p><p>“Don't believe his whining, Neville. He loved it in the end.” Hermione kicked her fiancé in the shin for his words, which earned her a low, surprised yelp from him.</p><p>“I'm always up for a good story,” Neville said with his head tilted in curiosity, imploring them to start.</p><p>Hermione didn't get a chance to even open her mouth before Draco raised his finger to stop her.</p><p>“I will tell the story, my love, to make sure you don't leave out any details...” After a deep breath, Draco sat up, turning towards Neville with a side-look to her. “So, that scene just before the End of Year Feast was only the first part...”</p><p> </p>
