    <p>Ahsoka slammed the door to the orphanage open, her white hair settling with her dyed blue tips just reaching above her chest. School had not been fun today, just because it was the last day of school does not mean that you can bully her more. That’s not how it works.</p><p>“Ahsoka! Stop slamming the fucking doors!” yelled the owner of the orphanage, Ms. Smith. She hated Ahsoka just because of how she looked and acted. She thought all the kids were useless, and didn't really care about any of them, just the money she got from the government. Ahsoka just sighed and walked into the small room she had been given. She was glad to have a room to herself but she was sick of the small space.</p><p>At this point, she was only eleven years old, too old for someone to want to adopt, too young to be able to fend for herself. She had to start high school after the summer. She was, well, excited isn’t quite the right word. How about saying she was prepared for the torture in Hell? Yeah, that sounds about right. For now, she was relieved that summer could finally start.</p><p>------------------------------</p><p>Two weeks before school started up again, Ahsoka collected the post and shifted through all the letters, seeing most for Ms. Smith. That is, until the last letter. It was addressed to her. She walked into the kitchen and placed all the letters besides hers on the counter. She turned over the letter but before she could look properly, the letter was snatched out of her hand.</p><p>“Are you trying to open my mail?!” Ms. Smith shouted at her. Ahsoka flinched but stood her ground.</p><p>“No. Its addressed to me, therefore I have every right to open it up.” She tried to take it back, but before she could, Ms. Smith tore it to pieces and chucked it into the bin.</p><p>“No! No one would ever want to contact you so go to your fekking room!” Ms. Smith slapped Ahsoka, knocking her to the floor. She then kicked her in the stomach before walking off with letters in hand, grabbing a bottle of vodka on the way and slightly swaying. Like she needed that. Ahsoka could tell she had already had at least one bottle.</p><p>Ahsoka walked out to her ‘room’ that could fit a bed, a nightstand, a small mirror, a window and drawers. All she had were small knick-knacks that had been given to her when her parents had been killed. This included a book, a headdress that she usually wore, a weird blue and golden box, a necklace with a crystal on the end, and a communicator-thing that would show these symbols whenever she opened it.</p><p>Ahsoka sighed as she walked into her small room. She couldn’t get around her bed as the drawers were pushed against the bed and the bed was pushed up against the wall. Her nightstand was pushed in between the bed and the opposite wall. On the roof of her room were a bunch of beams which she liked to climb on as they went up a bit.</p><p>Ahsoka walked to her mirror and saw that her the left side of her face was red and when she lifted her shirt, her stomach was splotched with purple and black. When she prodded it, she hissed. Defiantly bruised ribs. Nothing she hasn’t dealt with before. Usually the Mistress wasn't so bad, maybe a few verbal insults and average negligence, but when she drank she always got physical. Ahsoka had had to stop her from hitting some of the younger kids. While she would normally just keep to herself, the older ones in the orphanage would always try and protect the younger ones, and while Ahsoka was young, she was still at least the fourth oldest out of eleven.</p><p>Careful of her ribs, Ahsoka climbed up into the beams and just lay there thinking for a couple hours, swinging her leg that hung off the beam with her arms behind her head. She was pulled away from her thoughts by a small tapping on her window. Curious, she hopped down and walked over to the window. When she opened it, she saw there was an owl sitting there with a letter held in its beak. She stared blankly at the owl before blinking rapidly and reaching out to take the letter. Giving the owl a quick scratch on its head, it cooed before flying away, leaving Ahsoka dumbfounded.</p><p>Unbeknownst to her, someone had seen the owl fly to and from the house, and he smiled gleefully knowing he had just found a magic user. His leader would be happy to hear that he had found him a new follower... Only problem was, the owl also realised the unfriendly presence was there, and it hurried its flight path. It needed to give warning so the child wouldn’t end up in trouble.</p><p> </p><p>

</p><p> </p><p>‘Witchcraft and Wizardry?’ Ahsoka silently thought, though she was intrigued by this proposition, even knowing that it could just be a prank, but something inside her told her that it wasn’t. That, and a literal owl dropped it off. She took out the second piece of paper, and read that over too, mainly ignoring all of the unfamiliar names within.</p><p> </p><p>

</p><p> </p><p>Ahsoka just rolled her eyes. That was no help at all. Honestly, she was excited about the idea but knew that it was ridiculous to believe in magic, though there were always times where she would believe in it. Childish beliefs.</p><p>-----------------------------</p><p>It was a week before school started up, and Ahsoka was just drifting in and out of sleep when she heard knocking on the front door, but just ignored it. She was once again pulled from her thoughts by a loud banging on the door accompanied by the shouts of the lovely Ms. Smith saying she needs to come downstairs. Ahsoka just sighed and stuck the letter under her pillow and making her way down the stairs. Maybe someone was looking for a child to adopt?</p><p>As she entered the main room, she instantly felt a chill go down her spine. Something was... off. She first noticed how none of the other children were there, so that put adoption out the window unless the person was specifically looking to adopt her, which was unlikely. The next thing she noticed was the man that stood in the room. He towered over the eleven-year-old and had a dangerous glint in his eyes.</p><p>She instantly distrusted the man but tried not to make it obvious on her face. She walked forward when she was shoved from behind by Ms. Smith and was forced to shake the man’s hand.</p><p>“Ahsoka, this man is from a school that he wants you to attend. It’s a boarding school so plwase go and pack your stuff. He has already shown appropriate ID and I believe this would be a good opportunity for you.” The Mistress had a sickly-sweet smile on her face, and Ahsoka huffed at the obvious fake smile. But what scared her was that the man just smirked. While she couldn’t know what he was saying, a small voice was heard in the back of her head.</p><p>‘<em>Too easy.</em>’ The voice made her involuntarily shiver but she put it up to imagination. She had always gotten thoughts that she believed were from other people but she always thought it was just her mind playing tricks on her.</p><p>“Are you from Hogwarts?” She questioned the man.</p><p>“Yes. Now pack your stuff. We have much to do.” The voice sounded the same as before. Her gut instinct was to refuse, but Ms. Smith was glaring daggers at her, so she quickly turned on her heel and returned to her room. She grabbed her rucksack and packed her book, blue and gold box and communicator, as well as some extra clothes and shoes. She wore black jeans, a white t-shirt and a red hoodie. She thought about putting her headdress on, but decided against it and put it away before putting on her necklace.</p><p>“AHSOKA! HURRY UP!!!” Ahsoka just rolled her eyes and shut her door, slamming it just to annoy the woman. She saw other children look at her curiously, others with envy, and some with malice. Yeah, not everyone here was friendly.</p><p>She rushed down the stairs away from the peering eyes and the man stood by the open door. Ms. Smith just shut the door behind them as soon as she stepped out. Honestly, she would never understand that woman. Ahsoka wondered if this just happened with any child that caught the interest of someone. How did that woman even get this job?</p><p>The man walked beside her in silence, having a firm hand on her shoulder, leading her through the streets of London. She was still getting weird vibes from the man and she still couldn’t understand why. He hadn’t done anything particularly creepy to warrant such suspicion, did he? He led her to the entrance to the underground and down the stairs. No one else seemed to realise they were going down the abandoned tunnel.</p><p>“Um, sir? This underground station has been closed for years.” She informed, fear starting to creep into her soul the deeper they went. “Don’t worry. It’s just one of the ways to get to the school. It has a secret floo network entrance.” His hand tightened in assurance, but she felt something else. Deceit. And what was he on about? What was floo powder?</p><p>As they got to the bottom, Ahsoka saw that the place was definitely abandoned, and she tried to slow down, but the man just shoved her forward. She started to try to pull away from him but she couldn’t get out of his grip. “Let GO of me!” Ahsoka shouted, tugging and pulling on his arm. The man just chuckled and looked at her with dangerous eyes.</p><p>“Now, now, young one. I only want for you to meet my master.” He was about to start dragging her further before being stopped by a single frightening shout that echoed throughout the empty underground.</p><p>“Let the girl go. Now!”</p><p>------------------------------</p><p>Plo-Koon was generally calm and reserved, always keeping up a stoic façade of never losing it. However, when his owl, Keldor, returned to him after delivering a letter to a new student hooting and screeching while circling round his head, you could say he was slightly alarmed.</p><p>He let the bird lead him to a Port-Key, and he remembered the general place where Keldor had been sent to. He grabbed the ashes and transported himself to the nearest exit near the original address with Keldor perched on his shoulder. </p><p>When he arrived, he could feel a strong light magic signature, but it was being shrouded by darkness, and he immediately knew what was happening. The light magical presence, however, was stronger than he had ever felt besides one, even stronger than Yoda’s.</p><p>Running down streets and through crowds of people, his owl staying above him until they reached an abandoned underground tunnel, and Plo immediately knew this was where the dark magic user had taken her. He sent Keldor to hide and lead the girl away from the inevitable fight that would take place.He quietly made his way down the stairs, quickening his pace when he heard the sound of shouting and struggling. As he reached the bottom of the stairs, he saw a girl fighting against a dark magic user, his essence flowing freely.</p><p>The young girl had pure white hair with her tips died blue, glowing sapphire eyes, patched skin, and was wearing black jeans, a red hoodie and a sort of headdress. She fought against the grip, but the dark magic user simply laughed, and was about to drag her off, probably to his leader. This was when Plo Koon intervened.</p><p>“Let the girl go. Now!” he shouted, voice echoing in the barren cavern. The dark magic user looked towards him and smirked. Plo’s blood was boiling, and he was ready for a fight.</p><p>------------------------------</p><p>Ahsoka looked behind her to see there was a man was a man wearing red robes and a mask covering half of his face. He had brown hair and tan skin. Somehow, Ahsoka already felt she could trust this man, even though she had only just met him.</p><p>The man holding her smirked at the newcomer and Ahsoka was thrown aside into the wall, where she hit her head and fell dazed to the floor, but could still listen to the conversation that was taking place in front of her.</p><p>“To what do I owe the honour of the famous Plo Koon being in my presence?” The man said with a patronising bow, a sadistic grin on his face. The newly named Plo Koon just further glared at the man who had tried to kidnap her.</p><p>“Trying to kidnap a child will often warrant a visit. Leave now or face the consequences.” Plo Koon took a threatening step forward, and Ahsoka felt a strong essence of sorts radiate off him. She had felt these sorts of things before, but never this... pure. And it made her feel safe.  What happened next, however, shocked and frightened her. Each pulled out a wooden wand of sorts, but that wasn’t what was frightening. It was what came out of it. Fire, light, darkness, nothing and yet, everything.</p><p>‘<em>Magic...</em>’ She thought. And if her assumptions were right, only one of the magic users were good. She watched as spell after spell was shot, when a spell nearly hit her. Then a familiar face flew down and started circling around her.</p><p>It was the owl who had originally delivered her letter, and she got up to follow it, nearly being knocked down by a blast of lightening nearly hitting her. The owl flew further down the tunnel, and Ahsoka raced after it, wanting to get away from the danger behind her.</p><p>She heard a shout behind her, and turned around to see a spell of sorts heading right for her. She held her hands up to cross her face in an act of defence, and was shocked to see that there was a shield in front of her. She stared, dumbfounded.</p><p>The hoots of the owl brought her back to reality and she continued to run after the bird as it flew rapidly down the softly lit tunnel. She was running out of breath when she saw that the tunnel was becoming lighter, and found herself at an exit that led outside onto a street.</p><p>She looked for the owl, only to see it sitting on a sign. She walked closer and read the sign.</p><p>“Dexter’s Diner, huh?” She earned a hoot in reply. The owl blinked at her, as it jerked its head to the door.</p><p>“You want me to go inside?” Another hoot. She looked around, and didn’t see Plo Koon or the other man anywhere, and nobody seemed to notice the diner, for some reason. She also... felt, many presences inside, and all were stronger than what she was used to.</p><p>“Alright then.” Ahsoka shrugged, and opened the door, letting the owl go in first, then stepping in herself. The owl flew over to the serving area, and a tall muscly man pet the owl on the head. She cautiously followed the owl over, and the man caught her wary gaze and gave her a friendly smile.</p><p>“Welcome to Dexter’s Diner! Since you’re with this little guy, I can only assume that you didn’t originally come here for food?” He leant an arm on the counter. She felt at ease with this man so she decided to see if he knew what was going on, but still unsure if she could tell him what she saw. She was about to answer when she felt a hand softly fall onto her shoulder and give what she guessed was a reassuring squeeze, and the recognisable voice of Plo Koon answered for her.</p><p>“Yes. We ran into a bit of trouble, and Keldor knew this would probably the safest place for her.” The man, who she now guessed was Dexter, frowned.</p><p>“Are they at it again?” He questioned, and she saw Plo Koon tip his head in answer.</p><p>“Yes. I was lucky to have found her in time.” Plo Koon replied grimly. However, Ahsoka was just so confused. Now that the shock had worn off, she wanted answers. Like, I don’t know. Who were these people? Why had the man tried to kidnap her? What was all that voodoo magic about? What was that forcefield thing that had stopped her from possibly being killed?!</p><p>“Sorry to interrupt, but could someone please tell me what’s going on? And what all that was back there? And how that owl seems to be better at directions than me?” Ahsoka was frantically trying to find out why this was happening. Plo Koon turned towards Dexter, and he led them over to a brick wall that was hidden from the front of the store.</p><p>Plo Koon pressed his hands to certain areas to the bricks, and just like in the movies, the bricks parted into an area. Ahsoka stood there, before noticing that Plo Koon and his owl, Keldor had moved forward. She followed suit, and looked back as she watched the bricks close behind them.</p><p>Plo Koon turned to her.</p><p>“What is your name, young one?” Right, she completely forgot to tell him her name. Well, not like she had much time.</p><p>“My name is Ahsoka.”</p><p>“Ahsoka, have you ever heard of a possibility of magic being real in this world?” Ahsoka shook her head, and Plo Koon seemed to give a small sigh at that.</p><p>“I didn’t think so. Your reactions made me believe that you hadn’t heard of it. It is strange though, as nearly all magic users know about magic from parents or other family members. Are your parents a wizard or witch?” He questioned. Ahsoka hung her head slightly.</p><p>“I wouldn’t know. Never met my parents. They died before I was young.” Plo Koon hung his head in condolence and there was a short silence before Ahsoka decided to start getting answers to the questions that were bubbling in her head.</p><p>“So, what is all this about magic?” Instead of answering, Plo Koon simply gestured around the corner of the brick wall, where she could hear many voices and loud noises. She warily walked around the corner, and stopped short as she marvelled towards the scene before her.</p><p>“Welcome, Ahsoka, to Diagon Alley!”</p>
