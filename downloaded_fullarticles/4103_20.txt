    <p>In his zeal to see Tina again, he’d of course forgotten her landlady’s rules.  And in his desire not to overstep his bounds, Newt hadn’t apparated directly into the Goldsteins’ apartment…true, he didn’t know what wards Queenie and Tina had protecting their abode, but nonetheless, it wouldn’t be polite to simply appear in a lady’s sitting room, whether one knew how to bypass the wards or not.  No, he’d rung the bell like a gentleman.  A ‘No-Mag’ gentleman.  </p><p>And of course come face to face with Mrs. Esposito.  Who had practically shooed him away from the door.  Not before Tina had appeared at the top of the stairs to bear witness.  Naturally.  </p><p>He found himself nearly pushed from the porch, with Tina in hot pursuit. She grasped his lapels, pulling him to within an inch of her face before she froze, taking a step back and letting him go.  She offered her hand instead.  “Mr. Scamander…”</p><p>“Ms. Goldstein,” he replied, dipping his head as he took her hand.  In his front pocket, Pickett attempted to wriggle free for a peek at the person who’d been taking up practically every spare thought Newt had as of late.  Not that a Bowtruckle could read minds, but he assumed he must have been rather absent-minded for his creatures to take notice.  </p><p>Her eyes were bright…almost too bright now that Newt was here with her.  He’d thought about them…dreamed about them for going on months now, but here in person, he almost had to look away.  </p><p>Almost.  </p><p>“How…how are you?” she asked, gently removing her hand from his so she could grip the sides of her housecoat as she wrapped it around her.  She’d obviously been in a hurry to get down here once she’d realized who was knocking at the door.   </p><p>“You’re cold…I’m sorry…” he looked away for the first time since he’d been in her presence, realizing belatedly that it was rather cold.  Snowing, in fact.  He bent slightly to set his case down, spotting Mrs. Esposito still standing at the door, glowering in his direction.  </p><p>Tina took notice, turning to bid her return inside, waving her hands and promising she wouldn’t bring him into the apartment.  “How can I, Mrs. Esposito?  You’re going to be guarding the entryway!”  </p><p>When finally the landlady returned indoors, Tina turned back, taking his hand and nodding down at the case.  He reached down to take the handle just in time for the crack of their apparation and reappearance inside Tina’s apartment.</p><p>It looked exactly the way he remembered it, sans the scarves and other things knitting themselves in front of the fire.  Queenie was nowhere to be found either, and the only room that had the lamps on was the sitting room, likely the one Tina had been occupying before he arrived.  There was a book open and face down on the coffee table.  An apple with a few bites taken out of it.  A pair of brown house slippers haphazardly laying on the floor.   </p><p>Newt took off his coat, careful to allow Pickett time to crawl up his sleeve to his shoulder before he folded the garment over his arm.  </p><p>Tina tidied up with a flick of her wand, grabbing the apple out of midair and taking another bite as the book and the slippers floated by and into their rightful places.  His coat, too, floated up and over to a hook by the door.  She gestured to the sofa before taking up residence in the chair beside it.  She folded one leg underneath and sat down, pulling the other up and giving her an almost catlike look as she perched on the seat.  </p><p>Newt realized belatedly that he’d been staring at her when she raised her eyebrows, tilting her head and taking another bite of the apple.  </p><p>He sat down on the sofa, setting his case on the floor at his feet.  “How are <em> you </em>, Tina?”  </p><p>Her lips twitched upward in the corners, a small shy smile that he immediately recognized. “I’ve been doing very well, Newt.  And yourself?”   </p><p>He could immediately feel the tension draining from his shoulders.  He’d been slightly (more than slightly now that he was thinking about it) worried about her reaction to him once he’d returned.  He wasn’t the best at written correspondence, and he hadn’t really sent a letter in advance to foretell his coming.  He’d mostly just grabbed one of his books (as promised) and hopped on the boat.  </p><p>It was rather rude of him to simply drop in on her, he supposed, and he wasn’t sure how to go about apologizing.  Simply coming out with it seemed to be his safest bet.  </p><p>“I’ve been well…I do apologize for dropping in on you so very suddenly…” he looked down, sufficiently contrite in his poor manners.  </p><p>“No, no…don’t…” Tina reached for his hand, squeezing it briefly until he looked up at her.  “Really, Newt…” she shook her head, grinning widely.  “I’m just so happy to see you.”  </p><p>Pickett chirped indignantly, causing her to reach up and hold out her hand.  “And you too, Pickett.”  Newt was pleasantly surprised when his anxious little Bowtruckle hopped immediately into Tina’s outstretched palm.  He wasted no time making his way up to the front pocket of her blouse. She shrugged.  “Must like the way I smell or something…”  </p><p>Newt knew better.  Pickett was a little scamp, he was.    </p><p>But, he merely returned her smile, reaching for his case. “And that’s me as well...I’m so happy to see you...as is Pickett…” He nodded towards the mischievous little creature who was currently peeking at him from Tina’s pocket.   “I should have written, Tina, to let you know when to expect me…I was simply so excited to see you again, I just hopped on a boat and came here…”  He set it flat on the coffee table, untying the rope and flipping the locks.  The book he’d brought for Tina was in a satchel hanging near the tip top of the ladder down to his cabin, so it was simple to reach in and come back out again.  Tina flinched as he held his hand out, as if she expected something to bite her.  Newt supposed it was a reasonable assumption, given his track record with opening his case.  “No, Tina…just my book.”</p><p>“Your book?!”  She set her apple on the table again, taking the book from him with only the slightest squeal as she flipped it open to the title page.  “Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them…by Newt Scamander…”  She took her bottom lip between her teeth to stave off a wider grin, but she immediately flipped past the acknowledgments page and onward to the introduction.  </p><p>Newt wanted to stop her.  To point out the acknowledgments page…in the hopes that she’d read what he’d written there about her, but he held back.  It would be easier if he wasn’t in the room while she read it.  He didn’t think he’d be able to stand the tension.  Watching her read it.  Hoping she liked it…hoping that she didn’t look up at him and call him a nitwit.  A fool.  A moron for writing what he wrote.  He knew deep down that Tina would never…ever say something so hurtful, but then there was the niggling little voice in the back of his mind that never let him relax in a comfortable thought.  </p><p>She had shifted in her seat to angle her body towards him, her legs both curled beneath her as she read through the introduction, chuckling at a word here and there.  She chewed on her thumbnail as she read.</p><p>She finished the intro more quickly than he was prepared for, and she caught him looking at her.  This time, his eyes were following her hairline as it dipped down behind her ear.    </p><p>Newt apologized quickly and she either didn’t hear him, or ignored it entirely.  “I’m going to read all of this later, but I want to spend some time with you before you have to go…”  She closed the book again, placing it on the coffee table as she unfolded her legs, standing again to her full height and walking towards the darkened kitchen.  “Are you hungry?”  </p><p>“Before I have to…go?” he asked quietly.  </p><p>She raised her eyebrows.  “Are you…staying <em> here </em>? Or…I assumed you…”  </p><p>“Oh! No, no, I have have room already…” he jutted his thumb vaguely behind him.  “I got one when I came into town…I just…I wasn’t planning on leaving for a while…” he glanced up at the clock on the wall. “If I’m intruding, though…I realize it’s nearly suppertime and—”  </p><p>She laughed aloud.  “Oh…” She shook her head again, momentarily covering her face.  Her cheeks turned a rather lovely shade of pink.  “I was confused…I thought…but never mind.  Newt, please stay for dinner?”</p><p>He found himself nodding.  Smiling slightly at her flustered appearance.</p><p>She pressed her lips together, waving her wand as a tablecloth and dishes appeared on the table.  She set three places before turning her attention to the food.  Her brow furrowed as she mumbled the necessary incantations to put what turned out to be a very handsome-looking chicken with peas and carrots onto the table.  A chocolate cake followed, looking decidedly less handsome, but still most definitely edible-looking.  </p><p>Tina cursed under her breath as the cake sort of flopped onto the serving plate, the frosting splattering down onto the table cloth.  She fixed it with a scouring charm, though.  </p><p>She sighed, shrugging her shoulders.  “I’m no Queenie, but hopefully it’s edible this time…”  </p><p><em> This time? </em>  </p><p>Newt decided that changing the subject might prove to be more prudent than to react at all to what Tina had just said.  “Where <em> is </em> your sister? I…I assume she’s still living here?” </p><p>“She is…she’s…” Tina sighed again.  “Out.”  </p><p>The way she said the word practically dripped with disapproval.  </p><p>“Oh…”  </p><p>“She’s visiting Jacob.  She always visits him on her way home from work…”  Tina shook her head.  “I know—I know <em> why </em> , but I just… <em> wish </em> she was being more careful.  If Jacob’s memory is jogged…I didn’t like obliviating him any more than she did.  But…”  She looked helplessly at Newt.  “MACUSA law…I wish she could let him go.”  </p><p>Newt tried to look sympathetic, even though he had to admit to himself that he was completely on Queenie’s side here.  If Jacob’s memory could be jogged by anything, it’d be by Queenie.  Ever since Jacob had backed into the rain that fateful day, Newt had second guessed his decision to allow it.  </p><p>And judging by the look on Tina’s face, she felt the same.  His heart went out to her, for the quandary she was surely in.  He wished there was a right answer.  A quick fix.  Something that could make it an easy decision for her.  </p><p>“How <em> is </em> work, Tina?” he asked, opting to change the subject yet again to something that he knew Tina would want to talk about.    </p><p>She smiled, taking a seat across from him at the table. “It’s good.  Definitely more exciting.  I’ve been moved back up to Auror again—”  </p><p>She lapsed into animated chatter about her job, filling him in on the high points and the low points.  How she was thrilled to once again be back in the thick of things.  How nice it was to not be bored and boring in Wand Registration.  </p><p>He loved listening to her talk — about anything really — it was so nice to hear her voice.  </p><p>They both began eating, and as much as Newt usually wasn’t picky about this sort of thing…he had to admit that Queenie was the better cook of the two Goldstein sisters.  </p><p>But, fortunately, Tina had already found her way to his heart and hadn’t had to use his stomach at all.  Which was probably a good thing.  Considering her blatant overuse of salt.  Newt actually considered himself the better cook of the two of them at the moment, and that was saying something.  His specialty was porridge.</p><p>The chocolate cake <em> was </em> good, though.  Even if it wasn’t pretty looking, and if the frosting inside the cake had a decided lack of cocoa.  </p><p>He ate two helpings of everything, regardless.  It genuinely surprised Tina when he asked.  </p><p>She kept Queenie’s food out on the table for her, casting a warming charm over the plate as she cleared and washed the dishes with a flick of her wand.  </p><p>It was nearly eight by the time he’d finished the absolutely over-steeped cup of tea Tina brought him after dinner.  He honestly hadn’t ever had tea this bad before, but he chalked it up to her being American and a little heavy-wanded with her cooking incantations.  </p><p>He said goodbye to her in her living room, and as much as he wanted to do something more than touch her face this time, he couldn’t work up the courage.  Luckily for him, she was a bit more bold than he and leaned in to hug him before he apparated.  He appreciated their comparable heights in that moment, because they fit together so unbelievably well.  Her head on his shoulder and his likewise.  She carried a slight floral scent in her hair, one that he recognized, but not by name.  It hung on a note of something he didn’t know from anywhere other than Tina herself.  He pulled away from her before he was ready, not wanting to overstay his welcome either in her home or in her arms.  </p><p>“Come along, Pickett…” He said, arching a brow at the little imp as he pretended not to hear him.  “Pickett...let’s not overstay our welcome with Ms. Goldstein…”</p><p>Tina smiled then, reaching into her pocket to allow the bowtruckle to hop onto her hand once more.  It took some finagling, pleading and bartering to get him back into Newt’s coat pocket again.    </p><p>She folded her arms and stepped back slightly, waving as he raised his wand.  He apparated out into the street, aiming for an alley between her building and the next.</p><p>He hoped to see Queenie the following day.  He wasn’t able to stay for a very long time this visit.  He was really only going to be here for five days. The following day was Saturday, so he hoped to be able to stop in and see her before he had to leave.  </p><p>Not to mention, he aimed to see Tina every day he was here…if she’d allow such a thing.  </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>Tina exhaled steadily as the crack of Newt’s apparition faded.  Her heart was thudding in her chest so hard, she was certain it was audible.  She couldn’t help but grin and giggle just a little.  </p><p>Newt was just so…</p><p>Just so wonderful.</p><p>Her entire body felt warm as she mentally recounted the events of her afternoon.  Every word he’d spoken — there hadn’t been many, but Newt hadn’t ever really been a man of many words.  It was the little things.  The looks.  The smiles.      </p><p>And he’d eaten her cooking.  Her horrible, horrible cooking.  She knew she was heavy-wanded when it came to seasonings; she somehow had never really gotten the hang of it.  Just another thing Queenie was good at that she wasn’t.  It hadn’t really ever been an issue before today.  Because she’d never really wanted to cook for someone else before today.  </p><p>But for whatever reason, she’d decided to attempt a chicken.  And with him there in the kitchen with her.  He’d surely seen her mumbling the cooking incantations under her breath, but he didn’t seem to mind.  </p><p>And he’d eaten two helpings.  Of everything.</p><p>She hugged her arms around herself and practically skipped back to her bedroom to change into her pajamas. Her slippers were under her dresser where she’d sent them earlier.  She was intending to make a cup of cocoa and curl up with Newt’s book.  He was so passionate about his creatures, she wanted to see what he’d written about each one.  She wanted talking points for the next time she saw him.  Whenever that was.  </p><p>She frowned when she realized she hadn’t gotten a promise of a next time from him, but she assumed he’d be by again. He would be, right?  </p><p>She heard the front door open and close, so she ducked her head out of the bedroom door, delighted to finally see Queenie coming home.  “You’re late,” she called.  A reprimand, but a very, very light-hearted one.  Queenie hadn’t been herself lately.  Only really smiling when she was coming from seeing Jacob.  Which was most of the reason why Tina hadn’t put a stop to the visits.  It pained her to see her beloved sister so upset, and by a law that really — the more Tina thought about it — was really so dated and unneeded.  There should be something they could do about it.  Given Newt’s opinion of America’s laws concerning No-Maj relations, she had to believe Britain had it figured out.  Why couldn’t they?  Why couldn’t her sister be happy?     </p><p>Her sister smiled, stepping out of her coat as it flew to the the hook on the wall.  “I know, I’m sorry, Teeny.  I just…I needed some quiet…”</p><p>Tina couldn’t help but soften even more at the tone of her voice.  She knew how loud it got in New York for someone like Queenie.  She didn’t know where she went off to, though.  Where in this bustling city she could go to get some peace.  Queenie often said that everyone’s thoughts just shouted at her here.  People were so passionate, so driven…and their thoughts reflected that.  </p><p>“How was Mr. Kowalski?” she asked, shooting Queenie a look as she toed off her shoes.  The mauve heels flew back towards her bedroom.  Queenie shook her head, failing to hide her mischievous smile.  </p><p>“I think the real question is, how was <em> Mr. Scamander </em>?”  </p><p>Tina blushed, grinning widely.  “He’s fine.  He came by to drop off his book.  And to have dinner…”  </p><p>“Dinner?  Oh honey…you cooked for him…”  Queenie tilted her head sympathetically.  “A whole chicken?  That’s…ambitious.” She raised her eyebrows.  </p><p>Tina rolled her eyes.  For the love of Mercy Lewis.   “Now, now.  He <em> likes </em> my cooking.  He ate two helpings of <em> everything. </em> Even if I did forget the cocoa in the filling of the chocolate cake again.”  Maybe her cooking wasn’t bad, maybe it was just for people with…different tastes.    </p><p>Queenie smirked.  “You’re too impatient.  You over-salt and you under-cocoa.” Usually Tina didn’t mind her kind-hearted jabs at her homemaking skills, but for some reason they were striking a nerve tonight.     </p><p>Tina huffed indignantly.  “He was HERE, watching me. I was nervous.  Besides, it doesn’t matter.  He liked it.”  <em> And I even made him tea after. </em>  </p><p>“We have tea?” Queenie wrinkled her nose.  “Where did you find tea?”  </p><p>“From that tin in the cupboard…” Tina pulled the tin in question from the counter, floating it over towards them.  </p><p>Her sister raised her eyebrows.  “I don’t remember buying this…was it here when we moved in?”  </p><p>“NO,” Tina scoffed.  “I bought it once to see what all the fuss was about…it’s not my taste.”  </p><p>“Well, I suppose it doesn’t go bad, does it?” Queenie asked.  The truth was, neither of them drank tea or really knew much about preparing it.    </p><p>Tina shrugged in response.  “He didn’t complain.  About anything.  He had seconds. <em> Of everything </em>.”  She could barely contain her squeal of excitement.  </p><p>“Well…he <em> is </em> a Brit…”  </p><p>“What’s that supposed to mean?”  </p><p>“And he lives alone.”  </p><p>“And what’s <em> that </em> supposed to mean?”</p><p>“I’m just saying…” Queenie grinned.  “I’m happy for you, honey.”  She sat down at the table and picked up her fork and knife.  Tina poured her a glass of water while she cut her food, taking a tentative bite and frowning.  “Oh Teeny…”  </p><p>“What?”  </p><p>“Marry this man.  Before you turn him into pickle…”  </p>
