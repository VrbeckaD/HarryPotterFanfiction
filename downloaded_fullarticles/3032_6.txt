  <span>Dad insisted that I got ahead on reading my AP chemistry textbook. It’s apparently a very hard class.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <b>GryfRose: </b>
  <span>Understandable, but you have to get up in 3 hours to get to school on time. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>

  <b>GryfRose: </b>
  <span>Albus got yelled at by a teacher when he got here. Scorp has the bright idea of taking the elevator, which conveniently wouldn’t open for like 2 minutes while he was on it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <b>AlbusPott3r: </b>
  <span>But I won fair and square.</span>

</p><p> </p><p>
  <b>AlbusPott3r: </b>
  <span>your definition of weird looks is people looking at you in amazement in how fucking great you are. Come on, I know you read the entire chem book last night, but we need to pay attention. Y’know suck up to the teacher. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <b>SlythScor: </b>
