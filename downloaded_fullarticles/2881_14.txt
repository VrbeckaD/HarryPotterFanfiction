    <p>I plop down on the chair and throw my bag to the nearest bookcase. “<em> I hate this weather.” </em></p><p>   “Well, good afternoon to you too,” Remus says, undisturbed. I roll my eyes and grab a random book out of my bag. “That’s the only thing you wanted to say? What a conversation starter.”</p><p>   I stop moving and turn around slowly to look at him. “You’re supposed to say more than that. It’s not my fault you didn’t answer my-”</p><p>   “How am I supposed to answer a sentence? You didn’t ask a question, Janie.” He turns the page and looks up. His legs are on the table, one over the other, and his hair is tangled. “You’re late. I thought we were going to study at <em> five, </em> not <em> six. </em> Even a toddler would know the difference,” he teases.</p><p>   “Don’t call me Janie. It’s Jane, ass. And sorry I’m late, a fifth year was bullying a first. We had to go to miss Sprout to fix it,” I say, slapping his arm lightly. “And it’s snowing outside. I can’t run when it’s slippery. You know that.”</p><p>   “You can’t run at all,” he mumbles under his breath.</p><p>   “<em> Excuse me?” </em> I hiss. Now I slap his arm harshly. “Look who’s saying.” A small smile tugs at the corners of his lips when he turns another page. “Just shut up, Remus. I still need to do that assignment.”</p><p>   “Me too.”</p><p>   I arch an eyebrow. “Why the hell did you wait?”</p><p>   “Because we made a deal. We would do it together, remember?” He sets down his legs and shoves his chair closer to the table. “Come on. It’s just a couple of exercises. We’re going to be fine. We still have… like… An hour for ten questions.” He lifts up his white quill and puts his elbow on the table, pursing his lips while looking at the paper in front of him.</p><p>   “You’re not reading this, are you?” I ask after a while.</p><p>   He bursts out laughing. “Of course not. But I’m <em> looking </em>at it. That’s more than you, Janie.”</p><p>   I scowl. He has called me that since the moment we met, just because he didn’t catch my name right. Later on, he said he found it too cute to stop. I can still remember the serene, brooding look on his face when we first met each other during the journey to Hogwarts, like he felt he didn’t belong there. At first, he didn’t seem to really notice anyone. That was until we had to patrol together. When we got to the cabin where his friends were sitting, he told them to stop fooling around with the candy wrappers. They didn’t take him seriously, so I may or may not have have hexed the wrappers a bit so that they would attack them. Since then, we have been best friends. I look outside. It’s still snowing, as it has been for days. Snow is nice when you look at it, but being outside when you’re in a hurry, that’s a disaster.</p><p>   “Oi! Janie! We still have to do this!” Remus calls out, poking me in the side, which makes me jump. I give a squeal.</p><p>   “Was that necessary?” I ask. “You don’t have the right to do this every time you want to!”</p><p>   “Yes, I have.” He smirks and leans towards me. “You know you like it, Janie,” he whispers in my ear, making my cheeks turn red. “Just admit it.” Then, without a warning, he sits up straight and writes down his name on the paper. “Great. We can start. That’s a first.” My jaw has dropped. When he looks at me again, he looks at me oddly. “You okay, Janie? You look a bit bedazzled.”</p><p>   “Yeah, I’m fine,” I say, making it no big deal. My friends are convinced I like him, and vice versa. I, on the other hand, am convinced he absolutely isn’t interested. How could he be? Come on, be real. I clear my throat. “Where were we?”</p><p>   “I think you were going to confess something.” He leans forward once again. “Weren’t you?”</p><p>   My hand hits his face within seconds. “Yeah, right. Keep on dreaming, loverboy.” With a satisfied smile on my face, I turn to the exercises. “Wow, this is easy. That’s just writing down what is told in the book.”</p><p>   “Mr. Lupin, miss Rames?” someone asks. I tense when I recognize the voice of the librarian. <em> Shit. Now we’re going to get it. </em></p><p>   “Yes?” Remus asks, turning around.</p><p>   “If you can’t be quiet, you will have to leave.”</p><p>   It’s quiet for a few seconds. Maybe Remus is trying to form an answer, maybe he’s just staring at the librarian like she’s lost her mind. “Alright. Come one, Janie, let’s go.” <em> What? Is that really his answer? </em>“We can continue elsewhere, where don’t have to be quiet.” He picks up the books and rolls of parchments, throws both our bags over his shoulders and grabs my hand. “Let’s go,” he adds finally, dragging me out of the library.</p><p>   “I’m sorry!” I call to the librarian, but before I can hear an answer, Remus pulls me out of the door. “Where are we going to go?” I ask him sceptically. “The library was the only place where it was quiet.”</p><p>   He shrugs. “Your dorm, maybe? I don’t know, is it quiet there?”</p><p>   “My <em> dorm? </em>Have you gone nuts?”</p><p>   He looks genuinely shocked. “I meant your common room,” he says quickly. “Common room, not dorm. I swear.”</p><p>   Laughing, I shake my head. “You’re lucky you’re cute. Otherwise I would definitely think you’re creepy.” <em> Hold on, did I really just say that? ‘You’re lucky you’re cute’? What is he going to think of that? </em></p><p><em>    </em>“Is it quiet in your common room?” he asks, letting it slip, thank God.</p><p>   I shrug. “Depends. When my friends are around, no. But, being two prefects, we could send them away. Yours?”</p><p>   He presses his lips together and shakes his head. “Usually not. Trust me, you don’t want to meet the other Marauders. They’re… much to handle. You can just hang around with me, you’re not ready for them yet.” He starts walking to the kitchens, where the Hufflepuff common room lies. “I can barely keep up with them. I don’t think it’s a good idea to work in my common room. We would have to go to my dorm, and they would think we were hitting it off. <em> Not </em>a good plan.”</p><p>   I giggle. “If you say so.” In silence, we walk further. When the portrait opens and when he wants to walk down the stairs, I stop him. “Stop.”</p><p>   He turns around, a small frown on his face. “What is it? Is there a monster downstairs?”</p><p>   “A few.”</p><p>   “What?”</p><p>   “Well… I might have to warn you for my friends. They’re not as much to handle as your friends, I suppose, but uhm… they tend to… humiliate me in front of everyone and to… tell inappropriate things. Let’s keep it on that.”</p><p>   Remus’ face lights up. “Really?” he asks, dragging out the vowel. He wiggles his eyebrows. “Things like what?”</p><p>   I inhale deeply. “Secrets, mostly. Some made up shit.” I shrug, laughing. “Really, sometimes I wonder why I still hang out with them. Same as with you, actually. But the worst, is my twin sister. Zola.”</p><p>   “Really?” he asks, clearly surprised. “Why is she the worst?”</p><p>   “Well… Ehehehe.” I run a hand through my hair, still wet from the snow, and put my hands on my hips. “I love her, really. She is a cinnamon roll, too cute for words, sometimes. But... How am I going to say this? She’s horrible.”</p><p>   “Well, so much for sisterly love.” He smiles like he doesn’t believe a word from what I just said. “Come on, let’s go downstairs. They can’t be worse than my lot.” He starts walking down the stairs, his hands tracing the old stones beside him. I swallow thickly, but follow him downstairs, hoping my friends aren’t there.</p><p>   “Jane! You’re here!” someone calls. I tense. <em> Shit. Chase. </em>He wraps an arm around my shoulder and pulls me to the center of the common room, to the table under one of the huge planters hanging from the ceiling. Faye and Skyler are sitting there, along with Kevin and Ryan.</p><p>   “You done with your homework?” Faye asks, taking a bite of the chocolate bar in her hand.</p><p>   “No,” I say, gesturing to Remus, who is still holding my books and other stuff.</p><p>   Skyler’s head shoots up. “Who’s that?” she asks, leaning forward and placing her elbows on the dark wood of the table.</p><p>   I hesitate. “Nobody,” I finally say. They know too much about him without meeting him in real life, mostly because of my stories, but he doesn’t have to know that. I nod to the couch in front of the raging fire. “Come on.” When we’re both settled, Faye stands up and walks over to us.</p><p>   “So this is Remus?” she questions, whispering in my ear. I nod. “You’re right, he is cute.”</p><p>   I choke on air. “Shut up,” I mumble when I’m done coughing. “You don’t want to cross that line.”</p><p>   “What line?” Remus asks, a slight smirk on his face. He lifts his quill and writes down the number one without even looking at me.  </p><p>   <em> Shit. He heard us. </em>“Nothing,” I say out loud, waving Skyler away with my hand. I turn around to Remus. “Just… nothing. So. Question one. We’re not going really fast, are we?” He doesn’t answer. When I look up at him, he’s looking at the table where my so-called friends are having a conversation, frowning “Remus? What’s going on?”</p><p>   “I thought I heard my name.”</p><p>   “Really?”</p><p>   He frowns and looks back at his parchment. “Yeah. But maybe I didn’t. Let’s do this.”</p><p>   “Wait.”</p><p>   “What now?”</p><p>   “Some music.”</p><p>   He puts his quill on the parchment. “Music? How are you going to do that, Janie?” He looks around. “Really, how? It’s not like you got a radio or something here.”</p><p>   “I don’t need a radio.” I slid my hand in my pocket and wiggle my phone out of there. Holding it between two fingers, I wiggle my phone in front of his face. “We have this.” He frowns again. I smile mischievously and search through my songs. “You’re going to like this one,” I say eventually.</p><p>   “Which one?” He leans closer and puts his chin on my shoulder. “<em> Heroes </em>?”</p><p>   “Yeah. Listen.”</p><p><br/>    Don't tell the gods I left a mess<br/>    I can't undo what has been done<br/>    Let's run for cover</p><p>
  <em>   What if I'm the only hero left</em>
  <br/>
  <em>    You better fire off your gun</em>
  <br/>
  <em>    Once and forever</em>
</p><p>
  <em>   He said go dry your eyes</em>
  <br/>
  <em>    And live your life like there is no tomorrow son</em>
  <br/>
  <em>    And tell the others</em>
  <br/>
  <em>    To go sing it like a hummingbird</em>
  <br/>
  <em>    The greatest anthem ever heard</em>
</p><p>
  <em>    We are the heroes of our time<br/>    But we're dancing with the demons in our minds </em>
</p><p>
  <em>   The crickets sing a song for you</em>
  <br/>
  <em>    Don't say a word don't make a sound</em>
  <br/>
  <em>    It's life's creation</em>
</p><p>
  <em>   I make worms turn into butterflies</em>
  <br/>
  <em>    Wake up and turn this world around</em>
  <br/>
  <em>    In appreciation</em>
</p><p>
  <em>   He said I never left your side</em>
  <br/>
  <em>    When you were lost I followed right behind</em>
  <br/>
  <em>    Was your foundation</em>
</p><p>
  <em>    We are the heroes </em>
</p><p><br/>    “Nice,” he says finally, when the song has ended. “But we still have to do homework.”</p><p>   “Sorry.” I put the song on repeat and throw my phone on the couch.</p><p>   “You don’t have to apologise.” He smiles fondly and places his hand on mine. A jolt of electricity travels through my body and I pull my hand away at first, but pretend it’s just to grab his better. His hand is warm, like a small heater.</p><p>   “I know the first one.” He pulls away his hand, a slight smirk on his face, and picks up his quill.    “That’s the sentence in the book. We just have to copy it.”</p><p>   “Remus?”</p><p>   He writes down the sentence and looks up, his eyebrows arched. “Yeah, Janie?”</p><p>   “My hands are cold.” I slide towards him and put my head on his shoulder. “You have to warm them up.”</p><p>   He bursts out laughing. “I have to?” I give a small nod. “As you say, ma’am. But how are we going to write then, huh?”</p><p>   “You’re a wizard. You’ll figure something out.” A few minutes later, our homework is done and taken care for. “How long do we have before dinner?” I ask.</p><p>   Remus looks at his watch, golden with a platina edge. “Half an hour.”</p><p>   “Bonita!” My head shoots up. My twin sister comes running down the stairs and gives me a hug. Then she sees Remus. “So this is Remus?” she asks. I nod. “You’re right, he is handsome,” she smirks and walks away.</p><p>   “What?”</p><p>   I swallow thickly and refuse to look at him, my face is probably as red as a tomato. “I told you she’s horrible.” <em> Do I have to say that I’ve never said that or not?  Isn’t it clear then that I </em> did <em> say it? </em></p><p><em>    </em>“Yeah... right. You know,” Remus says, quickly changing the topic of conversation, “last night I woke up in the middle of the night and I couldn’t sleep afterwards, so I’m beat right now.”</p><p>   I frown. “Why couldn’t you sleep?”</p><p>   “Sirius,” Remus groans, as if that explain everything. Which, to be honest, it kind of does. “He thought it was funny to pull a prank on all of us. Well, mostly James, but it ultimately affected everyone. He placed a spell on James, so that he woke up floating near the ceiling.”</p><p>   “What?” I burst out laughing. And I’m not the only one. Remus’s story seems to have caught the attention of Zola, who comes walking to our place on the couch.</p><p>   “And you couldn’t sleep because of that, because…?” Zola asks, falling on the lazy chair next to the couch.</p><p>   Remus grins. “James started screaming when he woke up, waking everyone in a one-mile radius. And then he almost killed Pads. I mean, Sirius. He nearly killed <em> Sirius. </em>”</p><p>   “We know who Pads is,” Zola states, leaning forwards and placing her elbows on her thighs. “It’s not really hard to figure out your nicknames. But, how late was that? We heard some commotion too, right, Jane?”</p><p>   “Yeah. Like… around 4 a.m.? Something like that? Or later?” I look at my sister, who looks to be thinking hard, but I know she isn’t. She’s only pretending so she’s able to look serious. Without that façade, she would probably be grinning like a lunatic. She loves pranks and would probably love to prank Sirius. And she loves the idea of me having a boyfriend. You know, we are two of the model students of Hogwarts, but we both love to just be ourselves when we’re done with homework and no-one is looking.</p><p>   “No idea, Jane,” Zola says, “I’m not a living clock.”</p><p>   “Unfortunately,” I mumble under my breath. However, it is still too loud, because Zola tickles me in retaliation before continuing our conversation without missing a beat.</p><p>   “Well, I’m off. I’m going to the Great Hall. You coming too?”</p><p>   Remus and I exchange a look. “Yeah, sure. Come on.”</p><p>   “Great. To my… friends,” he says, hesitating a little between the words ‘my’ and ‘friends’. “Acquaintances.”</p><p>   Zola nods enthusiastically. “Yes, obviously, come on!”</p><p>   “She is crazy,” I stage-whisper in Remus’ ear, dragging out the vocal.</p><p>   He grins and stands up. “I understood that reference,” he whispers in mine. He pokes in my side and walks to the portrait hole. Zola wiggles her eyebrows and I groan, covering my face with my hand. Zola slides her arm around my waist and starts humming a cheesy love song.</p><p>   We walk ahead of Remus when she whispers in my ear, “He <em> definitely </em>likes you.”  I just roll my eyes, but a warm feeling spreads through my chest.</p><p>   “Oh, come <em> on </em>, you madman, let’s get real. That’s not going to happen, dork.”</p><p>   “Oh, I like that, I’m a dorky madman. It’s <em> totally </em>going to happen, sis. Just you wait and see.” We climb the stairs, Zola almost unnoticeably swaying her hips a little (mostly because I would have to start doing the same), leaning on me for support, her arm now over my shoulder. When we get to the last step, Zola’s feet catches on the stone and she falls forward.</p>
