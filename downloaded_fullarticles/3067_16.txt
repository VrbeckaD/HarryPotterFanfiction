  <u> <b> <b>Chapter 1</b> </b> </u>
</p><p>The trip back to Kings Cross passed uneventfully. When they arrived, Harry and Hermione helped each other with their trunks until they were met by George and Sirius; Sirius cast feather-light and shrinking charms on both trunks, and grinned at their thanks. Hugs were exchanged all around, then the four left the station for the drive back to the Grangers’ home. </p><p>For once, there wasn’t any nervous tension or awkwardness on the trip home. Harry and Hermione dug into the books they were reading, as usual, but not from any need to avoid a discussion. Nothing terrible had happened since they were home on Easter hols, and it was actually kind of a relief to learn there wouldn’t need to be a difficult discussion of the year’s chaotic events when they got home, but that was mostly because they were there for it.</p><p>Harry knew that the Quidditch World Cup was coming up. Fred and George had spent the train ride talking about it. Apparently Arthur could usually get tickets and they had hinted they wanted Harry and Hermione to come. Harry wasn’t sure he wanted to. He loved Quidditch, for sure, but this was the first summer that Sirius was free and he wanted to spend it with Sirius, Remus, and his parents.</p><p>Hermione had put the twins off, saying they would have to ask their parents before they could agree to such a trip. She also knew there had been some thoughts about visiting one or two of the Potter properties, and she didn’t know when or if that might happen. She didn’t want Mr. Weasley to buy tickets for them and then find out they were out of the country.</p><p>Given how unpredictable their summer plans could possibly be, both Harry and Hermione set to organizing their summer homework the moment they got home and their trunks unshrunk.</p><p>“This is just sad, Moony,” Sirius teased them. “The son of James Potter doing homework the day after the end of term…”</p><p>Harry was already working on his Arithmancy essay, since it was going to take the most research to complete, and he rolled his eyes. “If I get it done quickly, I have the rest of the summer to have fun and not worry about it,” he informed them with a huff.</p><p>Sirius snickered, but Remus only smiled. “As long as there’s fun prioritized in there somewhere,” Remus answered.</p><p>“Of course there is,” Hermione replied matter-of-factly. “But who wants to haul homework along when we go on vacation?”</p><p>“Says the girl whose favorite tourist stop is a book shop…” Sirius continued to tease.</p><p>“Nothing wrong with that, Pads,” Remus put in, standing up for his niece. “Just because you avoided the library like the plague…”</p><p>It was Sirius’ turn to huff. “Moony, you’ve seen my family library. I’m pretty sure it <em> is </em> a plague.”</p><p>“Speaking of vacations, I picked you up some audio cassette primers for Latin,” Jean interrupted the bickering as she breezed into the kitchen. “You’ve all said that many spells are in Latin, and since it’s the basis for French, Spanish and Italian, I thought it would be a good set of lessons.” She spoke while checking the oven. Something smelled delicious. “Twenty minutes until dinner.”</p><p>Harry grinned; he’d been picking up something of other languages from Hermione and during their travels, but it would be nice to be able to really catch up on something. “Thanks, Mum.”</p><p>“You’re welcome. We ordered them in from a shop we know in France,” Jean explained with a smile. “It’s not really a taught language anymore, more’s the pity.”</p><p>“Oxford still teaches Latin, Mum,” Hermione spoke up, finally taking her attention away from her Ancient Runes homework. “And the University of Edinburgh. I looked it up because I was curious. The University of Leicester does, too, though their catalogue says it’s a different sort of language course because it’s all taught by academics. There aren’t any native speakers anymore.”</p><p>“I think Beauxbatons teaches a Latin course to their first and second years,” Remus mused thoughtfully.</p><p>“Beauxbatons?” George asked curiously as he joined the rest of the family in the kitchen.</p><p>“The Wizarding school in France,” Sirius answered. “There are three major European schools: Hogwarts, Beauxbatons and Durmstrang.”</p><p>“Is there any difference in education?” Harry asked curiously.</p><p>“Slight differences,” Remus recalled. “Certain electives can be offered at one school but not the others, but the International Confederacy of Wizards makes sure that most major education systems remain consistent. That way wizards who hire immigrants know they’re hiring someone with similar education.”</p><p>“Do any wizards go on to post-secondary education?” Hermione asked. “Not just masteries but Oxford or Cambridge?”</p><p>“A few have,” Remus noted. “I considered it, but I wouldn’t have been able to afford it. Part of our cooperation with the muggle government includes a protocol that allows muggle-born students to apply to a university if they have the grades and can pass A-levels.”</p><p>“I still never understood why you’d want to,” Sirius grumbled.</p><p>“Perhaps because magic can’t, and clearly doesn’t, solve everything,” Jean suggested lightly, reminding Sirius that he was the only one present who hadn’t grown up at least partially in the muggle world.</p><p>“There’s definitely a lot more to the world than wizards study,” George agreed. “And if a person is interested, wizard or not, why shouldn’t they go to University?”</p><p>“I’m surrounded by swots!” Sirius exclaimed. “Merlin, do I miss James sometimes.”</p><p>“Well, you know what they say, Uncle Sirius,” Hermione said with a cheeky grin. “If you can’t beat them, join them.” She held a book out in Sirius’ direction. Sirius sighed and grabbed the book, noting that it, at least, was a book on defensive magic.</p><p>Harry knew the last six months had been hard on Sirius. Proving his innocence to the DMLE had been one thing, but getting the wizarding world to accept the truth was another thing entirely. People fled his general vicinity when he was out in public, some thought that regardless of his innocence he was still a mad and dark wizard, and people <em> watched </em> him. In general, Sirius was learning to avoid crowded situations. It left him unable to resume his old job as an auror. Amelia had offered, clearly out of guilt about the fact that everyone had turned on Sirius, but he declined.</p><p>Not only was he having issues in his personal life, but his nephew had nearly been assassinated mere months before to try and prevent Sirius from testifying. The event had terrified Sirius of losing Harry. Harry didn’t really remember the worst of it, but the way his family now watched him, it must have been bad.</p><p>“Knut for your thoughts?” Harry asked.</p><p>Sirius jumped, realizing Harry had caught him staring, then smiled slowly at his godson. “Just thinking about what I should do next.”</p><p>“You mentioned looking over your family properties,” Hermione recalled. “How did that go?”</p><p>Sirius grimaced, then refocused. “The family manor in London is a disaster; I probably need to get a team of curse-breakers to give the place a thorough review before it can be made habitable again. Most of the other properties are in better shape, but they’re rather more public locations. If they weren’t well kept, they’d draw attention. Merlin, I never thought I’d go back there.”</p><p>“Why?” Harry asked, staring at Sirius.</p><p>Sirius paused. “Home was always… hard. My parents had my life planned out from the moment I was born, even though I didn’t fit the mold I was expected to fit into. When I went to Hogwarts and got sorted into Gryffindor, I was hoping that they’d wake up and see who I really was but instead…” Sirius bowed his head. “It’s one of my worst memories. It was like I was a puppet. I was expected to fall-in. My younger brother could. He was always the golden child. So when I ran away at sixteen, I promised myself I’d never go back. My father and mother both died while I was in Azkaban, so it’s my property now, but actually going there…”</p><p>Harry looked at Sirius and was shocked to see how pained he looked. “So going back there sounds like what would happen if I were forced back to Privet Drive,” Harry realized. Sirius nodded stiffly.</p><p>“You could sell it, or donate it to someone,” Hermione suggested. “Or hire someone to act on your behalf while all the curses are removed, then you could repaint it and get new furniture.”</p><p>Sirius raised his eyebrows. “What do you think, Remus, interested in the gig?” he finally asked.</p><p>“Wh-what?” Remus spluttered. “Me? Why-?”</p><p>“You need work, and you’ve been there before. Plus you know more about dark curses than nearly anyone I know,” Sirius said.</p><p>“You really trust me with this?” Remus asked in disbelief.</p><p>Sirius just stared back at his best friend with a look that closely resembled Hermione’s expression when Harry was being particularly thick about something. “I can’t think of anyone I’d trust more.” Remus sputtered, but no words actually formed.</p><p>“Have you thought about what to do with your family inheritance?” Jean asked Sirius; he’d been wrestling with the difficulties his family had left him since Easter and had discussed the options several times with the Grangers.</p><p>Sirius sighed and shrugged. “I have no direct heirs, nor am I likely to anytime soon. You five are all the family I choose to acknowledge. Well, and maybe the Tonkses, but…”</p><p>“Tonkses?” Harry asked curiously.</p><p>“Andromeda Tonks was born a Black,” Sirius explained. “My cousin, and the sister of Narcissa Malfoy and Bellatrix Lestrange.” Harry sucked in a breath, recognizing both names. “She was disowned for marrying a muggleborn named Ted. They have a daughter named Nymphadora who’s five years older than you. Andy actually wrote me a letter a week ago. She wants to meet up, to talk.”</p><p>“You should,” Jean encouraged. “You need to hold on to family. Which reminds me, We have a Granger family reunion coming up in a couple of weeks.”</p><p>Harry’s eyes went wide. They’d mentioned the reunion last summer, to prepare Harry, but he couldn’t help but feel a little conflicted about the event. There were still moments that he felt like a bit of an outsider within the family. As if she were reading his mind, Jean stroked his hair softly.</p><p>“They’re going to love you, Harry,” she reassured him. “Blood doesn’t matter. You’re family.”</p><p>Harry smiled, more at the fact that he noticed that he’d grown a couple inches more than anything. It reminded him of how much his parents inexplicably loved him. At the very least, Harry belonged with them, and they were intent on getting Harry to believe that he was worth so much more than the Dursleys had taught him he was.</p><p>“And Sirius is avoiding the question,” George put in slyly. “If you don’t want to talk about it, just say so,” he added in a more normal tone.</p><p>Sirius shrugged. “I haven’t really figured it all out yet. Beyond what we just discussed.”</p><p>“That’s okay,” Jean agreed. “Besides, what was it you said over Christmas? ‘The extra wing of the house wasn’t put in to be temporary’?”</p><p>“That’s right,” Remus chimed in, calmer once he was no longer on the spot about helping Sirius with his properties. “We’re here to stay.”</p><p>The first weeks of the summer passed in a blur of homework and lessons in the park. When the Grangers started packing for the family reunion, Jean refused to listen to protests and insisted Remus and Sirius pack as well. “You’re family. They’re family. So you’re coming.”</p><p>As it turned out, everyone had an excellent time. George’s parents’ home was a small manor house in the south of France, and the little town nearby had plenty of hotel space for those who chose not to stay in the manor itself. Jean and George had elected to go the hotel route, to give Harry a space where relatives couldn’t invade. Jean’s siblings and their families also attended, so Hermione got to introduce her brother to their cousins on their mother’s side as well as their father’s extended family. Though George had no siblings, he had quite a lot of cousins, many of whom also had children.</p><p>The days were filled with football and cricket and splashing in the pool. Harry’s new family members had apparently been well prepared by Jean and George and Harry noticed that they were extra careful to treat him as one of the kids.</p><p>Even Sirius and Remus didn’t feel out of place for too long. The family was, in general, boisterous and welcoming. If anyone was surprised that Jean and George’s adopted son came with two “uncles,” no one commented on it. Even if it was a little odd to see everyone busy and functioning without magic, it was a sight they’d grown accustomed to at the Grangers’.</p><p>Before returning home, the family made a visit to the Isle of Skye. Sirius and Remus were able to take them to the edge of the main Potter estate, but none of the adults could approach the gates. They all knew the property was warded, but it was definitely disconcerting to simply reach a point at which they couldn’t continue to walk forward.</p><p>“So what now?” Harry asked. He and Hermione were unhindered by the wards, as the Goblins had said they would be.</p><p>“You press your hand against the gate and state your name and who in the group has permission to enter,” Sirius explained.</p><p>Harry tentatively stepped forward and pressed his wand hand against the gate. “My name is Harry Potter. I give permission for George Granger, Jean Granger, Remus Lupin, and Sirius Black to enter.”</p><p>With a loud, grating creak, the gate opened. “Does this remind anyone of a horror movie?” Jean joked.</p><p>They all entered and gasped at the view as the door closed behind them. The front yard was more like the park near their house. There was a pond off to the side with a couple trees near it.  Harry spotted the edge of a Quidditch Pitch beyond that. The main path led through a short maze of bushes, then up a hilly front lawn, and eventually to the house. The manor was huge.</p><p>“Some of the best times of my life were here,” Sirius commented, breaking the silence. “It was really the first home I’ve ever had.”</p><p>As they approached the grand front stair that led to the entry, a muffled pop sounded and a pair of House Elves appeared in front of them with wide eyes. “A Master Potter has returned!” the first one exclaimed. Unlike the tea-towels or pillowcases they’d seen depicted in books on House Elves, these two wore neatly tailored clothing with the Potter crest on the front.</p><p>“And a Mistress Potter, too!” the second added in an excited tone.</p><p>Sirius broke into a grin. “Pipsy! Spiffy!” he greeted them.</p><p>“Master Sirius, welcome back,” the first elf beamed. “We is waiting so very long for Potters to come home.”</p><p>“I’m sorry to have kept you waiting,” Harry said softly. “I didn’t know anyone was here.”</p><p>“No sorrys,” Spiffy said sternly. “You’s here now, and with more family. All elves is being happier with your arrival. Come in, come in.”</p><p>Spiffy led them from the foyer to a sitting room. Given the large, ornate house, the sitting room was furnished in a way Harry hadn’t expected. Instead of the stiff furniture Harry thought he’d see, the sitting room had a lot of big, overstuffed couches and chairs around a large fireplace. There was a wireless in one corner. A broomstick was propped on an end table, like it’s owner was coming back for it in a moment.</p><p>Sirius and Remus froze. “They… they were in a rush to get under the Fidelius. That broomstick… it was your father’s.” Sirius explained. Harry went over and touched the broom.</p><p>“He took me for rides on this,” Harry recalled, barely remembering a rush of wind and a deep, booming laugh. “Before I could even sit up…”</p><p>Remus nodded. “He did.”</p><p>“We lived here, before…” Harry murmured. Before Voldemort heard the prophecy and sent them into hiding, before Peter betrayed them all and ruined the lives of an entire family, this had been home. Harry suddenly got the image of getting his Hogwarts letter here, of Lily teaching him his letters and numbers, of siblings… he felt guilty, wanting to know what would have happened. He loved Hermione. He loved his parents. But he still kinda wished he knew what would have been. A life without knowing how cruel one human being could be to another before the age of five.</p><p>Sirius nodded.</p><p>“Attacked, we was. Before Master James took you’s and Mistress Lily into hiding,” Spiffy mused sadly. “We all fought nasty, wicked wizards. Would’ve died to protect home and family. But Master James, he says, ‘keep our legacy safe for my son, Spiffy.’ And so Spiffy did, with other house elves to help. But Master James died, away from home.”</p><p>“Do you want to stay?” Harry asked slowly. “Or is this too full of sad memories to be comfortable?”</p><p>Spiffy shook her head. “We stay. We all stay. We bonds to House of Potter because Potters good to all peoples, including to House Elves,” she stated firmly. “Bad wizards is being bad to everybody, including Elves who only wants to help them. Good wizards is good to everybody, and we return love where it’s given.”</p><p>Hermione stepped up to Harry’s side, when he seemed at a loss for how to respond. “Then I think we can come to love you, too, in time, and we hope we can live up to your expectations of Potters.”</p><p>“You will,” Spiffy said confidently. “Can Spiffy have Mistress’s name?”</p><p>“I’m Hermione Granger, bonded sister to Harry Potter,” Hermione introduced herself. “These are our parents, Jean and George Granger. It seems like you know Uncle Sirius and Uncle Remus already.”</p><p>Spiffy nodded. “Master and Madam Grangers is welcome to Potter Manor,” she said with a brief bow. “House is being clean, but guests not expected. Spiffy will have rooms prepared and dinner ordered for Potter Family.” She popped out of the room before anyone could argue with her.</p><p>“Well,” Jean said after a moment. “That was different.”</p><p>Sirius chuckled. “That’s normal behavior for the Potter House Elves.”</p><p>“Any sentient being can be cowed into submission,” Remus said slowly. “But Elves are quite cheerful and helpful when they feel appreciated.”</p><p>“Did we want to continue looking around?” George asked. “I know this place is likely to be full of memories for the three of you, but if we want to make use of the home at some point…?”</p><p>“We should stay,” Harry murmured. “It’s just… hard, I think.”</p><p>“But think of how happy the Elves are to have you home,” Hermione offered. “Maybe their joy can help offset some of the sorrow?”</p><p>Harry just shrugged, and Hermione didn’t push. She noticed that he drifted closer to Sirius and Remus as they began to move through the house, though, and told herself firmly not to let it bother her. They had memories in this house, and she didn’t. Just one more thing she couldn’t really understand, so she wouldn’t stop them from taking comfort in each other if that was what they needed.</p><p>Spiffy reappeared as they headed further into the house. “Usual rooms prepared for Master Sirius and Master Remus. Rooms in family wing ready for Master and Mistresses Granger. But Spiffy is unsure if Master Harry would like the Master Potter’s suite or another room?” She looked uncertain, blinking up at Harry.</p><p>“My parents’ room?” Harry asked awkwardly.</p><p>Spiffy shook her head. “No, no. Was Master and Mistress Potters’ rooms; Master James’ parents. Master James didn’t want to change once they were settled…”</p><p>When Harry looked both relieved and uncertain, Jean stepped in. “Why don’t we leave the master suite until you’re of-age, Harry?” she suggested gently. “You and Hermione should have rooms more suited to your age for now, I think.”</p><p>Harry looked at Jean, then glanced at Sirius, who shrugged. Then Harry nodded. “I think that sounds okay,” he agreed, turning his attention to Spiffy. “Can you find rooms next to each other for my sister and me, please?”</p><p>“Of course!” Spiffy said, perking up now that she knew what Harry wished. “I gets them ready now!”</p><p>With a pop, she disappeared. Harry looked around with interest. The nearest room was a mid-sized ballroom that made Sirius smile. “We had some pretty wicked parties here,” Sirius said. “I’d spend a lot of nights over here after I was sorted into Gryffindor.”</p><p>“Padfoot’s parents begrudgingly admitted that if he had to be sorted into Gryffindor, at least he was socializing with the right people,” Remus explained.</p><p>“They weren’t blood traitors?” Harry asked, shocked.</p><p>“Well,” Remus hedged. “They certainly stood against Voldemort, but the Potter name is a bit too influential for anyone to call them that.”</p><p>“Except for my mother,” Sirius added with a scowl. “Though even <em> she </em> only said it behind closed doors. Your grandmother was originally a Black, Harry. Of course, my mother called people blood traitor for doing almost anything. I was a blood traitor for being sorted into Gryffindor and disrespecting my father, for example.”</p><p>“Sirius’ mother was a piece of work,” Remus said, frowning.</p><p>“I like to think Mrs. Potter was more of my mother…” Sirius noted.</p><p>“What was she like? Both of them, I mean,” Harry asked.</p><p>“Well Mrs. Potter was always feeding us. She made the best things. Stews over Christmas, homemade fish and chips… she made her own Pumpkin Juice… Both Mr. and Mrs. Potter knew that I never got… love… at home. Mr. Potter would take me and James to Quidditch games and such.”</p><p>“That sounds fun. Dad has taken me to Muggle footie games,” Harry said with a small smile. “Mum says she and Hermione used to go, but neither of them is very interested in sports. I like to go watch, though, so now we watch on the telly or once in a while at a live game. Plus there’s a kids’ team that plays in the park over the summer.”</p><p>“You could join if you wanted, you know,” Hermione chimed in. “I could take a different class or just read in the park while you practice. If you think you’d have fun.”</p><p>“Maybe,” Harry hedged after a moment. He liked spending time with his sister and Quidditch kept them apart a fair bit during school.</p><p>The night spent at Potter Manor was comfortable. The House Elves doted on Harry and Hermione in particular, and Hermione eventually asked them directly for an explanation of the bond between House Elves and Wizards. Assured by the mutualistic benefits involved in the Bond, she was able to let go of her ingrained gut response to what outwardly appeared to be slavery.</p><p>Around two in the morning, however, they were all awakened from their beds by Harry screaming bloody murder. Hermione was in Harry’s bedroom first, just by virtue of distance, but the adults were right on her heels. Hermione sprang into bed and tried to wake Harry. He’d stopped screaming but was now writhing in bed and crying.</p><p>“He’s not waking up!” Hermione cried in shock.</p><p>“Here, Hermione,” Remus said, brandishing his wand. She backed away, letting Remus and her mum onto the bed instead. “Ennervate.” The spell had no effect, making Remus frown. Hermione leaned into Sirius, trying to make herself smaller and out of the way.</p><p>Jean felt Harry’s forehead, firmly holding his head. “He’s burning up...” she said slowly. She stroked Harry’s hair, making shushing noises at Harry. When Jean leaned over and kissed his forehead, Harry froze, then bolted upright so fast he nearly banged heads against Jean.</p><p>“Harry?” George asked, kneeling by Harry’s bed and feeling his pulse. “God, his pulse is racing, Jean. Harry, it’s Dad.”</p><p>Slowly, at a glacial pace, Harry blinked, then turned towards George. “Dad?” he asked in a whisper.</p><p>“I’m here, kiddo,” George said. Harry looked completely destroyed.</p><p>“Dad, I think he’s really dead.”</p><p>“It was just a dream, kiddo,” George reassured him, not having a clue what Harry was talking about.</p><p>“He was there…” Harry said softly. “There was a muggle and he was… I think he killed him.”</p><p>George leaned Harry’s torso against his chest, the teen now too large to hold in his lap without it being awkward. “Shhh, I know.”</p><p>“He was with Pettigrew,” Harry murmured, starting to sag.</p><p>“It’s okay, Harry,” George reassured him.</p><p>Harry then stiffened and sat up again, pushing away from George. He got out of bed and went over to the window, clearly trying to ground himself.</p><p>Everyone stared at him, all trying to figure out how best to comfort him. “What did you dream about?” Sirius asked curiously.</p><p>Harry answered very quietly. “There was an old man…” Harry started slowly. “He must have been a caretaker of a manor somewhere, but the manor had been abandoned. He saw a light on in the house, so the old man went to investigate… Voldemort was there with Pettigrew, and a giant snake… And someone I didn’t recognize. They were talking about the World Cup… and killing someone named… Be… Bertha Jorkins? There was something about something happening at Hogwarts. They… they were plotting to kill me.”</p><p>Sirius and Remus exchanged a glance; they recognized the name. Bertha Jorkins was a Ministry employee, though neither was sure exactly what she did. She’d been a couple years younger than them and had been rather besotted with Sirius, though the feeling was never mutual. They might not know if Harry’s dream was just a dream, but if they could confirm her status, they might have a better idea one way or the other.</p><p>“We’re not going to let them get to you,” George said firmly, missing the byplay between the two wizards as he focused on his son.</p><p>“I’m not sure you can stop them,” Harry mumbled, still shaken but calmer now.</p><p>“Do you remember the name of the third man?” Remus asked. “Did anyone address him?”</p><p>“Uh,” Harry blinked, trying to grasp it. “Crutch?”</p><p>“Crouch?” Sirius asked, eyes widening. “Barty Crouch?”</p><p>Harry looked at Sirius sharply. “That’s it,” he nodded. “Barty Crouch, Jr.” Sirius exchanged a long look with Remus. “Why? Who is he?”</p><p>“Barty Crouch, Sr. was the man who sent Padfoot to Azkaban without a trial,” Remus revealed softly. “His son… his son was one of the Death Eaters who tortured Neville’s parents.”</p><p>“But he died,” Sirius countered. “He died about a year after he was brought in. I remember it, because Crouch and his wife used to come to visit him every month, then they stopped coming and I remember reading in the paper that his wife died not long after that.”</p><p>“If Voldemort isn’t actually dead,” Hermione pointed out, “could this Crouch Junior also still be alive somehow?” Her eyes went wide. “Oh… is this… Melody’s family?”</p><p>Harry blinked, distracted from the dream and his own worries when she brought up their friend. Melody had graduated the year before and was of age, but just because she no longer lived with her father it didn’t necessarily follow that she would be safe.</p><p>There was a quiet pop. “We is hearing noises,” Spiffy said, precariously holding a tray with six mugs on it. Spiffy put the tray on an ottoman at the foot of Harry’s bed. “Bad dreams is going away best with a bit of cocoa. Or that is what Mistress Potter would be sayin’ when Master Harry was a babe.”</p><p>This caused Sirius to smile slightly. “Lily always did love her cocoa,” he remembered fondly.</p><p>Spiffy popped away again, and everyone grabbed a cuppa. Harry blew on his steaming mug a couple of times before speaking. “Do you think it was a dream?” he asked hopefully.</p><p>“Maybe,” Sirius hedged. “But you are naming real people, at least one of whom I doubt you’ve heard of before.”</p><p>“Which means we have a starting point to look into it,” Remus pointed out. “For now, though, I would try to put it from your mind. Enjoy the rest of your summer, and let us worry about dark lords and threats.”</p><p>When they returned home, they only had a few days to get unpacked and everything re-situated before Luna’s planned visit. Mr. Lovegood had arranged in advance for them to pick Luna up while he made a two-week business trip to some remote part of Africa. Luna was a little sad she couldn’t go with him yet, but Mr. Lovegood had promised to take Luna next year. She took it in stride and at least could look forward to two weeks with the Grangers.</p><p>Jean and George quietly requested that Harry stay inside for the time being, and Harry agreed. Everyone was a bit shaken up at Voldemort plotting Harry’s death within Harry’s dream, real or not.</p><p>While Luna was over, Sirius and Remus spent time at Potter Manor, unpacking a lot of stuff that had been in storage. Harry and  Hermione helped Luna finish her homework in record time, reviewed their own briefly, and spent the remainder of their weeks either reading, at the park, or exploring London when an adult could accompany them.</p><p>A few days after Luna returned home, Sirius surprised the kids with a late birthday gift for Harry. “I wasn’t sure if I could get them,” he admitted as he handed Harry an envelope. “And I didn’t want to disappoint you, if I couldn’t.”</p><p>Harry tentatively opened the envelope; inside were four tickets to the Quidditch World Cup being held the very next week. “We get to go to the World Cup?” Harry asked, eyes huge.</p><p>“They’re not great seats, this close to the game,” Sirius began, but was interrupted by Harry throwing himself into his godfather’s arms.</p><p>“This is amazing!” Harry exclaimed. “There are only four?” he asked after looking in the envelope again.</p><p>“Muggles can’t get to the game,” Sirius admitted. “But Jean and George said it was okay. You and I can go with Remus and Hermione.”</p><p>Harry blinked, then turned to his sister. “Do you want to go?” he asked hesitantly. “I know you’re not really a fan…”</p><p>Hermione smiled. “I’m happy to go if you want me to, Harry. You can be excited for both of us, but I do think it will be interesting to see a professional game.”</p><p>“We’re happy to let you go,” George said. “However, Jean and I would prefer if you didn’t stay overnight. Remus and Sirius have described all the pre-partying and post-partying people do and frankly Harry, given your fame, we’d prefer it if you weren’t there.”</p><p>“We just want to make sure you don’t get hurt or anything,” Jean confirmed. “The way Sirius describes it, some of these parties can get rather wild.”</p><p>“I don’t mind,” Harry assured them. “I’m happy to get to go at all!”</p><p>Arriving at the World Cup, neither Harry nor Hermione could hold back their amazement at the size of the stadium. As they were directed to their seats, Sirius and Harry definitely drew stares, or rather Sirius drew stares and Harry drew curious glances when they managed to catch a glimpse of him behind Remus and Sirius.</p><p>They were seated on the Bulgarian side, close to where the Quidditch players flew out of the locker rooms. Sirius knew he’d be a bit more comfortable in an area where both he and Harry were less likely to be recognized, and to combat the distance between them and the players, purchased omnioculars for all four of them, so watching the game wasn’t too much of a challenge.</p><p>Harry spent most of the game studying every aspect of Lynch and Krum’s approaches to the game, taking mental notes for upcoming house games at school. Hermione, Remus, and Sirius, meanwhile enjoyed the overall aspect of the game. At various points, house elves came by with wizarding delicacies from Ireland and Bulgaria.</p><p>Others around them who were attending mostly for their quidditch-mad friends or families also entertained each other with various things they’d bought from street vendors or brought from home. Hermione spent some of the game conversing with them as best she could.</p><p>At one point, Hermione caught sight of a crowd of red-heads in the Top Box, and she recalled the twins telling them the Weasley family would be attending this year too. She took out her coin and sent a message to the twins, saying she hoped they were having fun.</p><p>It was late when they got home, and went directly to bed. Despite remembering that Harry’s dream had mentioned the Cup, the adults had gone to bed thinking it was just a dream, and it was rather silly to think that it could somehow be prophetic. The morning after the game, however, the Daily Prophet’s headline shocked them all, and the beginnings of dread started in the pit of their stomachs. <em>‘SCENES OF TERROR AT THE QUIDDITCH WORLD CUP .'</em> <sup>1</sup></p><p>“That’s Voldemort’s… mark,” Remus explained softly after Hermione asked what the image of the snake coming out of the skull was. “Any time there was an attack… any time someone was going to find a loved one dead. That skull was floating above the person’s house.” Sirius had gone pale-green and silent.</p><p>“The Prophet seems to think this was the work of Pettigrew,” Harry said, reading the article in full. “Except I could guarantee some of the parents of our friends were there too… and given the last few years, signs point to Voldemort being a real threat, regardless of what the Wizarding world thinks.”</p><p>“You said he was sort-of alive first year, didn’t you?” Hermione recalled. “Attached to Quirrell somehow, and trying to get at the Philosopher’s Stone?”</p><p>Harry nodded. “Yeah. Between that and the shade in the diary second year, I’d definitely say there’s more people involved than just Pettigrew. Somehow, Voldemort isn’t dead.”</p><p>“You’ve said there are ghosts at Hogwarts,” George ventured a guess. “Is it possible for one of them to be resurrected? Could that be what Voldemort is trying to do?”</p><p>Remus shrugged. “I don’t know of any way, magic or not, to bring a person back from the dead. Even if they still exist as a ghost.”</p><p>“There are ways to animate a corpse. Infieri and the like,” Sirius added with a shake of his head. “But that doesn’t make the corpse a person again.”</p><p>“What about vampires?” Jean asked. “I mean, if the legends have some things right about werewolves, then surely there’s some grain of truth in other similar stories.”</p><p>“Vampires are dark creatures,” Remus acknowledged. “They do exist, though Anne Rice only has a few of the details correct.”</p><p>“Is Anne Rice a witch?” Hermione asked curiously.</p><p>“Who’s Anne Rice?” Sirius asked curiously.</p><p>“An American author of gothic fantasy fiction,” Remus answered promptly.</p><p>“Muggles have some pretty interesting versions of people in the magical world,” Sirius said with a smirk. “Like the story about Hobbits? What was that?”</p><p>“It’s just a story,” Harry laughed. “And despite the Statute of Secrecy, things get out. Rumor, myth, and legend catch the imagination of muggle writers, so it’s become fantasy. Sometimes I wonder if some of these stories weren’t written by wizards…”</p><p>“That’d be interesting,” Hermione said thoughtfully. “There are plenty of things that we have access to that muggles would love as a fantasy. I wonder if there’s any regulation regarding the statute and publishing in the muggle world.”</p><p>“I don’t think you’d be breaking the statute if it was published as fiction,” Remus said slowly. “I don’t think it has ever come up; muggle-borns are so often encouraged to leave the muggle world behind them as they grow into adults in the wizarding world.”</p><p>“There are writers known in both worlds,” Sirius spoke up. “But most of them published before the statute was enforced.”</p><p>George frowned. “Why would they be encouraged to leave their families and their lives in the muggle world behind?”</p><p>Remus sighed. “Because even among those who aren’t focused on blood status and tradition, having magic sets wizards apart. And to be entirely honest, the people who govern wizarding society prefer it that way. It makes them the ultimate authority.”</p><p>“It also helps feed into the feeling of superiority held so dear by the elitists,” Sirius added. “Clearly the wizarding world must be better if so many choose it over their muggle families.”</p><p>“That’s horrible,” Jean grumbled. “Wizarding society is just one <em> aspect </em> of the world. They don’t have a world all of their own.”</p><p>“It’s mostly leftover fear of a time when witches and wizards were persecuted,” Remus said. “Most people aren’t as accepting as you two. Look at Harry’s aunt and uncle.”</p><p>“Sometimes muggle-borns get kicked out by their parents,” Sirius offered. “Especially if they’re from religious homes. It’s not… they may not burn us at the stake any more but there are <em> reasons </em> why witches and wizards are afraid of the muggle world. It might be elitist and wrong, but it’s not unjustified to want everyone you love to be safe.”</p><p>Jean sighed and her shoulders slumped. “No, I can’t argue with that. There are many close-minded people in the world. Perhaps that’s one thing wizards and muggles do have in common.”</p><p>“Then we just have to teach them better,” Harry said with an expression of determination. “I mean, I don’t think we can get everybody or even a lot of people at once. But just remember how well our AA group took to their day in Muggle London.”</p><p>“We can change things,” Hermione agreed. “It just takes time.”</p><p>“There’s always going to be people who won’t want the change,” George pointed out. “It takes generations of people for that kind of thing to disappear. Eventually, if you put in the work, you can change things one person at a time. Though I’m not entirely sure how to change things in the muggle world without them all freaking out about the truth.”</p><p>“Exposure,” Jean said with finality. “That’s the only way to get anyone used to anything.”</p><p>“Which is the one thing the Statute of Secrecy explicitly forbids,” Remus finished glumly. “Still, perhaps we can find a way in time.”</p><p>“We can certainly try!” Harry and Hermione said together. They grinned at their synchronicity; it was one of the things they did both feel strongly about. Strong enough to work for it.</p><p> </p>
