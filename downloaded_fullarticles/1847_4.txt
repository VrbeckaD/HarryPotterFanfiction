    <p>
  <span>Harry spent many nights thinking about it.  He was going to have to stop Voldemort or die, he would be killing someone. . His life would have been a series of trauma and disasters following rules and plans of other people. His childhood was full of abuse by the miserable people he was living with and he stayed with them...because he was told. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t understand you” He overheard his cousin say one evening as he lay in bed reading after a walk around the neighborhood just to get away from Uncle Vernon’s racist ranting.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Wh-what” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why do you stay here every year?  My parents never liked you….and you don’t seem very happy” He saw Dudley sit a cup of tea on the bedside table. “Your headmaster makes you come back every year and you just...do”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“....” Harry hesitated , thinking of how to explain it.  “He says staying will protect-”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“...protect you?  Yeah some protection” Dudley rolled his eyes. “What’s going to protect you from mum swinging a frying pan at you or Dad trying to throttle you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What are you getting at?” Harry asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Just.. I reckon I just realized that you’ve gone through a lot of shite you shouldn’t have to and….you just...put up with it. Don’t you want anything better? If I were you I would have run away ages ago. I mean you have bloody magic I’m sure you’d stand a chance.” Dudley said, sitting on the edge of his bed. “So..why?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“....I suppose I” Harry thought about it and realized Dudley had some good points.  Seems like that dementor last year really changed him. “I...there’s a very dangerous dark wizard out there. and….I’m supposed to stop him. “</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re sixteen” Dudley said. “That shouldn’t be your problem.  Your biggest problem should be having to ask out the girl in your class on a date.  Are all the adults in your life honestly just...waiting around for a kid to stop their dark wizard?  That’s pretty shite of them”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry had no words.  He couldn’t explain why he was doing this other than, ‘because Dumbledore told me to” or “because the prophecy says.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s complicated, Dudley”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Doesn’t sound like it.  Either you do what everyone tells you to do...or, well, you don’t and you get a life.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Anyway I thought I’d bring you a bit of tea. I know it doesn’t make up for everything I’ve done but...well, I’ve been bullying you for a long time...and that..that dementor thing made me realize I really shouldn’t have…” He shrugged. “I’m sorry I guess is what I’m trying to say.  And think about what I said...you deserve to live not ...just solve other people’s problems”  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thanks Dudley” Harry sipped some of the tea, in shock a bit over his cousin’s change of heart.  He went back to reading but he couldn’t get Dudley’s words out of his head. All his life since he turned eleven he’d been assumed a hero or someone who was the answer to the wizarding world’s problem with Voldemort.  But he wasn’t an answer, he was a person. He never asked to be the solution to whole society’s problems. What if he did kill Voldemort. Would it really change anything aside Voldemort being dead?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There would still be wizards who hated muggleborns.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There would still be wizards who worshiped Voldemort.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There would still be wizards who practiced the dark arts.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And he would still be having nightmares every other night- or every night- likely e</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He couldn’t change what had already happened. No magic existed to bring back the dead. He couldn’t control other wizards’ hearts and minds.Not truly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>All he could do is end one dark wizard. Would another take Voldemort’s place?  What would he be expected to do then?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Was Harry’s whole life going to be cleaning up the mess in the wizard world?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He realized...he didn’t want that.  He liked being able to save someone when he could. But damn it, he didn’t sign up to be the wizarding world’s janitor. Part of him still wanted to kill Voldemort.  Get him out of the way but...why </span>
  <em>
    <span>not</span>
  </em>
  <span> have a bit of a life first?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Half awake now, Harry got up and wrote all these musings in a letter, and sent it to Dumbledore.  It caused a pain in him to not be able to send things to Sirius anymore. Though the more he entertained these ideas,..the more he started to feel excited. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He started packing his trunks and packed all his things.  He pocketed his Gringotts key, planning to use it for something. As he did he thought about what he wanted to do.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He wanted to see the world, see what was out there. He couldn’t do that with just a broom.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry wrote a quick note to the Dursleys with a small heartfelt note to Dudley.  He was right. It was time to start living. Leaving it taped to his door Harry left out the back door and took off for Diagon Alley</span>
