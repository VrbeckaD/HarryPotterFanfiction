  <em>'Good Morning'</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em><br/> Scorpius rolled over. Two golden-hazel eyes were looking directly at him. He felt it, the want. Lips brushed against his, and fingertips trailed slowly down his back and under his arse. The kiss deepened. Jamie…. He was so perfect. Scorpius moved against him, and he was so aroused, so ready. Lips on his neck. Lips on his abdomen. Lips… and tongue coating his cock. He stretched and let his head fall back, falling further and further….</em>
</p><p> </p><p>He rolled over again, and he was awake. <em>Fuck</em>. What the fuck do you call a dream that’s so absolutely amazing it does nothing but make you ache for what you don’t have?</p><p>Scorpius stared up at the hangings over his bed, letting the morning wake him up. There was nothing to do now but go for a run. He had to do something to try to pound this out of his system.</p><p>He pulled on his tracksuit and trainers, set a wake-up charm for Albus to make sure he got up in time for his rounds with the creatures and in the greenhouses, took a piss and tugged one out, and then set off. He forced one foot after another, letting the impact shake the thoughts out of his head. Lately, running was the only thing that was really working. If it wasn’t for running, quidditch, and his wandless magic work with Williams, he might be going absolutely mad about now.</p><p>The sun was just making its way into the valley in the early November morning. Just under two months had passed since he and Albus started their 6th year, which meant it was also eight weeks since he’d really spent any quality time with Jamie… eight weeks…. And eleven weeks since…</p><p>Scorpius’ mind wandered back to the late August weekend when Jamie’d finally finished Initiate Intensive Training and had come to Uist to visit him at the dig. He couldn’t help but smile at some of the memories. The sex had been unbelievably great. He had no idea that forced abstinence could pay off so spectacularly. Merlin, he could actually feel his arse tightening at the memory of Jamie inside him... the moment when his hand slid beneath them both and his fingertip brushed Scorp’s slick slit. He thought he might lose a nut he came so hard.</p><p>He took a breath and sped up his pace. He was going to have to try to think of something else or he was never going to make it the entire 10 clicks he wanted to cover that morning. When he reached the trail to Hogsmeade he appreciated, once again, that he and Williams were able to convince McGonagall to let him leave the grounds on his morning runs. He needed the extra space to roam, and couldn’t really test himself if he didn’t have a chance to get out into the countryside beyond the school and village.</p><p>Albus should be waking about now. A small chuckle escaped from his throat as he thought about the alarm he’d set.</p><p> </p><p align="center">------^^^^-------</p><p> </p><p>WAKE UP YOU LAZY OAF! ALBUUUSSS POTTTERRR! I MEAN YOU. YOU NEED TO WAKE UP!!</p><p>Albus threw a pillow at nothing knowing full well he wasn’t going to stop the wake-up charm Scorpius set without the use of his wand. He swore, no check that, he <em>knew</em> Scorpius derived some sort of sick pleasure from setting the alarm to emit the most obnoxious, screeching, wailing noises imaginable. He must have set it for full banshee this morning.</p><p>He hung his arm over the side of the bed and rifled through his clothes, finally digging his wand out from the crumpled heap. <em>“Silencio!”</em> He commanded, and the alarm went silent.</p><p>He rubbed his eyes, and scratched his scalp. Then, he decided he could probably afford a few more minutes before he absolutely had to wake up in order to make it to the stables to help Hagrid with the creatures this morning. He’d only closed his eyes for a minute before it started again.</p><p>WAKE UP ALBUS! WE KNOW YOU’RE TRYING TO SKIV OFF!!! GET YOUR MAGNIFICENT ASS OUT OF BED AND DOWN TO THE STABLES OR THE GAGGLE OF THIRD YEAR GIRLS WHO ARE NO DOUBT READYING THEMSELVES FOR THEIR MORNING GAPING SESSION WILL BE SORELY DISAPPOINTED. YOU WOULDN’T WANT TO DENY THEM THEIR WEEKLY DOSE OF ALBUS POTTER’S MAGNIFICENT MANE AND MIRACULOUS, MUSCLED, MAN-BODY, WOULD YOU?</p><p>Albus couldn’t help laughing out loud now. “Man-body?” That was rich. <em>Fucking Scorpius</em>. Fine… he was getting up.</p><p> </p><p align="center">------^^^^------</p><p> </p><p>Scorpius wondered how Albus was enjoying his wake-up charm. Maybe he’d swing by the stables on his way back to the Dungeon and see how his morning was going when he finished up. The likely entourage of young girls he’d encounter there made him smile a little bit.</p><p>He had to admit, though, the girls weren’t wrong. Albus was looking good. When he got back from America he definitely had a different spring in his step. He’d let his hair grow, which was a good look for him, and he had a swagger… Scorpius realized nearly immediately what had happened, Jamie took a little longer to catch up.</p><p>Their Albus had popped his cherry while he was abroad.</p><p>“Libby” was an older woman, by just thirteen months, but significantly more experienced than their young Albus. Scorpius felt his lips twitch at his silent endearment. He knew Albus would have his tongue if he ever heard him mutter the words aloud… Anyway… The upshot of Albus’ time in the states, aside from better hair, was that he’d been successfully initiated into the ways of the fairer sex. Whatever it was Libby taught him, it seemed to have a lasting effect as far as Albus’ appeal to female half of the student body was concerned because he was literally now beating them away with a stick.</p><p>When Scorpius got to the fork where the road broke for the village he turned toward the incline to make his way out of the valley and away from Hogsmeade and the school. The work was harder now, and it forced him to focus on his pace. That was good because it kept other thoughts from crowding his mind.</p><p>The sky was crystal clear this morning. Not a cloud in sight. He’d made his way high enough and far enough from the village that he could get a bit of a view down into the valley. It really was beautiful here, especially early in the morning. It was like it was just his, as if he was the only person to see it.</p><p>Suddenly he felt as if Jamie’s hand was in his. Gently squeezing it as they watched reflected sunlight dance across the inky, northern night sky. His heart pulled at the thought of Jamie’s tight, quiet voice confessing his insecurity and unhappiness… feeling out of place… that it wasn’t what he thought. He knew Jamie might struggle a little out beyond the walls of the school, but he hadn’t counted on the extent to which being Harry Potter’s son might be a hindrance as much as a help.</p><p>Jamie was worn down by the suspicion that he was going to advance just because his father was Head Auror. He didn’t know how to deal with being judged negatively because of his name. Scorpius wanted to console him, to tell him it was all going to get better, but he really didn’t know. Worse still, he was privately a little jealous that Jamie had never once experienced this kind of setback… the kind of whispers and judging Scorpius faced when he was just eleven and all by himself on that train.</p><p>Alone except for Albus.</p><p>Scorpius reached the apex of his route and began the descent back down to the village. He could see well into Hogwarts’ grounds from this vantage point and wondered if Albus had made it to the stables yet. He couldn’t quite see them because of some blocking trees, but he was probably there. He rarely missed a Saturday with the creatures.</p><p>His gaze shifted to the rooftops of the village as he thought about the trip to Hogsmeade that afternoon. He’d need to stock up with chocolates and pepper imps to keep him going during study sessions. He’d joined a handful of the cross-house tutorial groups Albus had organized that fall as one of the duties of his “Prefect” position. Scorpius had a sneaking suspicion that the whole scheme was a means for Albus to broaden his potential dating pool beyond the Slytherins and Gryffindors he knew best. Now that Albus seemed to have become more comfortable with, and appealing to, the opposite sex he was taking full advantage. However, the tutorial groups did have the upside of giving Scorpius a more constructive and serious mechanism to dive into his studies… and he definitely appreciated that.</p><p>Scorpius thought about how his evening would likely play out. He and Albus would take up residency at the Broomsticks with their usual group, Carlos, Yann, Philippa and Paul, as well as the three women at Hogwarts who still remained immune to the charms of one Albus Severus Potter; Rose, Phoebe and Aishah. Actually, Scorpius wasn’t entirely sure about Phoebe and Aishah, but they were both sensible enough not to get caught up in the current Albus craze.</p><p>That seemed to be one upside of Jamie leaving. Albus had finally come out from under his brother’s shadow. Mind you, he could still be a broody git, but being relieved of the close-at-hand comparison really freed Albus to just be Albus… Scorpius shook his head with a smile. Finally everyone else was getting to see the Albus he knew, smart, darkly funny, loyal as hell.</p><p>He felt his heart squeeze and knew it wasn’t the exertion, it was his body getting back at him for having a good thought about Jamie being gone… gone. He wasn’t really gone, though, he was in London, training and working with Nott in his time off. But, somehow he just felt like he was disappearing… leaking away, little by little.</p><p>Scorpius took a deep breath and picked up his pace for the final leg. If he was going to make it through this he needed to just bear down and work through the unpleasantness.</p><p> </p>
