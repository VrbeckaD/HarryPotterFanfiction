    <p>It's been 3 months since then, so why am I living on the same tent that I was when I was on the run with Ron and Hermione? Oh right…. I'm the savior. Everyone wants an autograph, or take a picture with me, to speak to me, to touch me, to worship me!!! I'm sick of it!!! Why can't I just be a normal person for once?! Even Ginny did that… At least here it's quiet. Lonely but quiet. No crowds. No press. No savior. Just the same Harry Potter that lived under the cupboard so many years ago.</p>
<p>“Isn't it time for you to return to civilization Harry?” - asked Hermione - “It's been 3 months. We miss you. Me and all of the Weasleys. Ginny feels awful about everything. She still loves you.”</p>
<p>“What she said to me isn’t something that I can forgive. I thought she knew me better than that.”</p>
<p>“But…”</p>
<p>“Look Hermione, I miss you guys too, but here... I’m free from what everyone expects from me. They all want me to become an auror or the Minister of Magic! Right now, I couldn’t care less about any of that. All I want is the peace and quiet that I never got since my parents died. I believe that I deserved at least that after the war.”</p>
<p>“I get it Harry, and so does Ron, but we think that it’s not healthy for you to be here, in the middle of nowhere, alone, with your nightmares…” - as Harry opened his mouth to deny that, Hermione said louder: - “Don’t even try to lie to me Harry Potter! You look like you haven’t slept in ages and THAT is due to the nightmares.”</p>
<p>“They aren’t always that bad. Besides, I’m not the only one with that problem and you know it!”</p>
<p>“True, but me and Ron… we have each other for support. You have no one since you broke up with Ginny. You can’t be alone forever, Harry. Why don’t you try and go once a week to The Three Broomsticks? It might be good for you.”</p>
<p>“I can’t promise you anything but I will think about it ok?”</p>
<p>“Thanks. That’s great to hear. I have to go now. I’m meeting Percy today about a job interview in the Ministry.”</p>
<p>“That’s amazing ‘Mione!! Good luck! Give Ron a hug for me please.” - said Harry as he hugged his best friend.</p>
<p>“Thank you. See you.”</p>
<p>“Bye.”</p>
<p>When Hermione disappeared, Harry picked up the book he had been looking at when Hermione arrived to his tend. It was the photo album that Hagrid had offered him, and since then he had added more photos of him with his friends and the Weasley family. Even though he hadn’t seen most of them in the last few months, he still thought about them all, but because they reminded him of the war and the people that died for him, he couldn’t face them.</p>
<p>His nightmares didn’t help him since half of them where memories from the war and the other half were his friends blaming him for surviving when so many didn’t and how that wasn’t fair. The last ones were the worse.</p>
<p>Ron had suggest him to go to the same mind healer that he and Hermione were visiting. The only problem with that was the fact that someone would hear about it and tell the press that Harry Potter was crazy, and he didn’t need more news about himself.</p>
<p>Maybe he should follow Hermione advice and go out for a bit. If he went to Hogsmeade he could probably meet Neville there since the last thing the heard about him was that he was learning from Professor Sprout in order to become a herbology teacher.</p>
<p>Harry then got up from the sofa and went to the shower. After, he cut his beard but not completely, just enough for him not to look like a homeless. He didn’t do it all because he got used to it during the months on the run. As he finished dressing, he took his invisibility cloak and put it on his jacket pocket and vanished.</p>
<p>It was half past nine at night. Few people were on the streets so it was easy for Harry to get to the Three Broomsticks unnoticed. Once inside, he tried not to bring attention to himself and went straight to the bar asking for a butterbeer. He waited, and when he got it, he turns around and saw Luna sitting at a table on the far corner of the pub by herself.</p>
<p>“Hi Luna. Mind if I join you?” - he said as he approached her table.</p>
<p>“Oh, hi Harry. Of course not. Haven’t seen you in a while. How have you been?”</p>
<p>“It depends on the day but normally I’m ok. What about you?” - Harry sat down in front of her and had a drink from his butterbeer.</p>
<p>“I could be worse but keeping my mind busy helps me. Me and my father have been rebuilding our home and also Neville as asked me for help to reconstruct Hogwarts. Both things help me. Actually, I’m waiting for him. Why don’t you wait here for him too? I know that he will enjoy seeing you.”</p>
<p>“I haven’t been in public in a while so I came here hoping that I could meet him and catch up. Seeing you here is great as well, even though I was not expecting it.”</p>
<p>“Harry!! It’s so good to see you! Where have you been? I asked Ron and Hermione but all they said was that you were trying to avoid the papers. Merlin, I missed you man.” - Neville had just arrived to the pub and to their table. Harry got up and hugged his friend. He had almost forget how the other boy was taller than him.</p>
<p>“Sorry Neville. I just got sick of all the garbage the papers were writing about me and so I went underground for the last few months. What about you? Are you still working with Professor Sprout to become a teacher?”</p>
<p>“I am but mostly for now we have been reconstructing the castle. We have finished all the exterior walls and this week we started the floors and the interior walls. You could come and help us. An extra pair of hands is always welcome and since McGonagall is the new Headmistress I’m sure she will do everything in her power to keep the journalists out of Hogwarts.”</p>
<p>“Don’t get me wrong Neville, I would love to help rebuilding the castle but it brings a lot of memories that I would rather not relive if I can avoid it.”</p>
<p>“Harry, I know that the war was hard for you, but you can’t forget that you weren’t the only one affected by it. I was kept prisoner for several months at the Malfoy Mansion with Mr.  Ollivander. Neville and the others that stayed at Hogwarts were tortured by the Slytherin students and the Carrows.” - Luna said with a soft voice.</p>
<p>“Besides Harry, Hogwarts may be almost destroyed now but by the time we finish, it won’t be the same castle that we once knew. And you won’t be by yourself, me, Luna, Seamus, Dean, Katie, Susan, Hannah and so many others. They might not be there every day but I’m sure you will enjoy seeing them, even if it’s just for an hour a day.”</p>
<p>“I can promise you Harry that you will not regret it.”</p>
<p>“Thanks for your words but I’m still not comfortable with it though I will send a letter McGonagall about my situation, and then decide.</p>
<p>“If you do come let us know okay?” - Neville asked with a kind smile on his face.</p>
<p>“I will, don’t worry. It’s getting late so I’m going back home.” - Harry got up from his chair, grabbed his jacket and before he left he said - “Sorry for interrupting your date. Have fun for me too okay?” - he winked at Neville and then left.</p>
<p>Arriving to the street, we walked a bit, just enough so that he could see what once was the majestic Hogwarts castle, the first place he could call home. After taking a last look at the castle he vanished.</p>
