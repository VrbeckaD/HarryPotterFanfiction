There will, however, be some Dumbledore bashing ahead.</p><p>CHAPTER ONE</p><p>The pale man stood in the graveyard. That Harry Potter had just escaped his clutches yet again was not making him happy. (Understatement) Harry had thrown some kind of bomb at Voldemort (for that was the man's name), which had made everything pitch black, even to his hyper vampire senses. He had heard the brat say something before he left, something about thanking the twins when he saw them again. Then he had apparated away, and when had Harry learned to apparate anyway? That was a sixth year learning curve, if his rather long memory served him correctly. Still, the vampire collected his senses and moved on. He would deal with the brat after he dealt with his followers…</p><p>...Followers who were now apparating to his side. Already, he could smell their utter terror at beholding his snakelike face and crimson eyes.</p><p>"Welcome, my friends… thirteen years it has been, and yet, you stand before me, as though it were only yesterday… I see that we are still united under the dark mark… OR ARE WE?!" He paused, scenting the air for show. "Guilt… I smell guilt in the air…"</p><p>Lucius Malfoy twitched, as though longing to step back, but too scared to further annoy his vampire lord. But Voldemort was already annoyed, and spotted the movement at once.</p><p>"Lucius, I believe you lost something of mine… CRUCIO!"</p><p>Agony unbearable hit the blond. It seemed to last forever, but was in reality over in minutes. Voldemort stopped to sneer at the weak fool he had called his left hand.</p><p>"To ensure that you take better care of other people's things, I believe a lesson is in order… Summon your son. I would speak to him."</p><p>Terror for his boy filled Lucius. But he obeyed.</p><p>He dared not do anything otherwise.</p><p>JUMPCUT!</p><p>Harry lay in the grass, clutching at Cedric's body and the Triwizard cup. He hadn't cared much for Cedric, but Cedric had treated him fairly, which is more than anyone besides Hermione, Ron, and the Twins had done. All he knew was that he was at his breaking point, and he could feel coils of evil snaking around inside him. He wasn't traumatized by the fact Voldemort was back. Although he was a right pain in the neck, Harry had been getting bored without his nemesis around.</p><p>Hands turned him over. He could hear Dumbledore asking if he was alright. Rather than laugh as he wished to, he forced tears out of his eyes. Opening them, he forced out, "He's back! Voldemort's back! I couldn't leave Cedric, not there! It was so horrible!" Forcing himself to blubber wordlessly, he made sure not to look Dumbledore in the eyes. He may have been an old fool, but he was also a master Legimens. Of course, Harry had no difficulty playing Dumbledore like a fiddle because he was good at acting like he was supposed to in situations like this. He had nearly blown it after Quirrell died, but he had only been eleven at the time. To his mind, that was several lifetimes ago.</p><p>Madame Pomfrey came by with a stretcher to take him to the hospital wing. Shooting her a grateful look, Harry allowed himself to be guided onto the stretcher. He knew the fanatic Barty Crouch Jr. would come for him eventually, and the Headmaster dared not cross Madame Pomfrey in her domain. Obliviate her, maybe, but cross her? No. Anyway, Harry knew it would be relatively safe to talk to the Weasleys, his godfather, and Hermione there, and Crouch Jr. would have to defeat a woundless and quite comfortable Harry. He made sure to hold onto his wand, but otherwise allowed his mind to go blank.</p>
