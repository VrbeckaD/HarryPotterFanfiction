    <p>Crowley knew his letter was coming. His parents almost sent him to Durmstrang to make him more of a man, but much to his relief, they decided against it, wanted to keep with the Hogwarts tradition.</p><p>When it arrived, his parents congratulated him, which meant a lot, because they rarely supported him in anything else. The Crowley’s were a notorious pure-blood family, going back centuries, the first of his family tried to kill the minister of magic, when they first came around. So his parents expected him to be evil, which was a lot of pressure for an 11-year-old boy who thought the cruellest thing he could manage was gluing coins to the pavement.</p><p>He knew the streets of Diagon Alley well. His nanny had brought him here a lot when his parents were away and she was bringing him for the last time, because he won’t need a nanny after he’s started boarding school.</p><p>Most of the boring shopping was over in a flash; he got his robes and his wand and all his books and most importantly, his owl. He’d wanted a snake but his nanny insisted that it would be a bad idea. How would a snake deliver any letters from his parents, she tried to argue. Now they were just wandering around. It might be the last time he would see her but he didn’t want to say anything. He’d been raised to not speak out of term and thinking about this made him feel quite unwell so he assumed it wouldn’t be the most exciting conversation, especially not with someone he cared about.</p><p>The streets were busy, it was nearly September, so all the first years had decided to come on the exact same day apparently, it was probably tradition too. Everything was.</p><p>After a full day, they headed for a floo, London probably had one of the biggest floo networks and it was lucky he lived there, Crowley hated walking.</p><p>At least his parents came to wave him off, he thought. Maybe they weren’t so bad after all. As the train was pulling away from the platform, he realised he hadn’t found himself a seat. He sauntered vaguely down the train and noticed that a few doors had shut quite suddenly as he’d passed. He knew his family’s reputation would affect him but he didn’t expect it to be this early on.</p><p>There was an empty room, or so he’d thought, a boy his age was sat upright, reading of all things. His bright white-blond hair was the first thing that caught Crowley’s attention. The boy’s head snapped up as Crowley stumbled into the compartment.</p><p>“Is this seat taken?” Crowley gestured.</p><p>“No.” He turned back to his book.</p><p>Crowley stood and stared for a few seconds before dragging in his trunk.</p><p>“You can sit down, you know.” He muttered, eyes carefully following Crowley.</p><p>“Yeah, I am.” He fell onto the seat, loudly. The boy cringed.</p><p>Crowley sat for about a minute tapping on his leg, looking round the compartment, trying to find a way to amuse himself.</p><p>“What are you reading?” He started, looking at the blond boy with as much interest as he could possibly muster.</p><p>“Sorry?” He jumped.</p><p>“I asked what book are you reading?”</p><p>“Oh. It’s just some introduction.” He glanced up.</p><p>“For class?”</p><p>“Um no, not quite. It’s an introduction for everything. It’s all a bit new.” He said, sheepishly.</p><p>“Oh! Are you a muggle then? Well, muggle-born?” Crowley added.</p><p>“Yes. I believe that’s the term.” He smiled politely.</p><p>“I’m Crowley by the way.”</p><p>“Aziraphale.” He said, warily.</p><p>“Cool name.” Crowley grinned.</p><p>“It’s from the bible. I was named after an angel.” He glanced down.</p><p>“Nice. What’s a bible?” He frowned.</p><p>/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////</p><p>Aziraphale was surprised, to say the least, when he received his letter. His family believed in the simple everyday magic of miracles and what not. They didn’t believe however that Aziraphale could be magic. He just wasn’t special enough. But the letter they were reading definitely said something different on that matter.</p><p>They couldn’t believe their eyes as they stepped into Diagon Alley. Aziraphale thought it was incredible, they just thought it was strange.</p><p>Aziraphale paced to the bookshop first, without a second glance and almost bought the whole shop. Next, he purchased a snowy owl, and ironically they matched in colour. Aziraphale’s hair was almost whiter than the owl.</p><p>After he’d bought the essentials, his parents hurried him away. Disappointed, Aziraphale went to his room as soon as they got back and started reading. They weren’t very surprised.</p><p>Aziraphale quietly got on the train, suddenly feeling very relieved, guiltily he waved goodbye and then scuttled into the nearest carriage and picked up his book.</p><p>As the train sped up the country, he started to worry. The thoughts in his mind were stopping him from focusing on the book. There was a loud noise as the door slid open and a tall boy with vibrant red hair hanging to his shoulders stumbled in. He seemed confused for a few seconds and then realised someone else was in the carriage. </p><p>After he’d sat down, Aziraphale could focus even less on his book, he kept glancing up at the boy but he knew he was never any good at being subtle. The boy was distracted though so he didn’t seem to notice.</p><p>Aziraphale watched as a few other first years stopped outside the carriage and pointed at the boy, whispering.</p><p>Suddenly, the boy snapped out of his trance and started a conversation. Aziraphale could tell that he was acting a bit wary, but he tried to lighten up so the first person he’d encountered wouldn’t run away.</p><p>“I’m Crowley by the way” He introduced. Aziraphale expected that wizard names would be strange but he’d never even imagined the name Crowley. Crowley would probably think the same about his.</p><p>“Aziraphale.”</p><p>“Cool name.” He grinned. Aziraphale felt flattered. Normally people would just think his name was silly.</p><p>“Thanks. It’s from the bible. I was named after an angel.” He added, realising that maybe that wasn’t the best thing to say.</p><p>Crowley paused for a few seconds, “Nice, what’s a bible?”</p><p>Aziraphale chuckled, “Do you not know?”</p><p>Crowley shook his head slowly, he looked sheepish but his eyes were smiling, “No. I don’t know much about muggles, if I'm being honest.”</p><p>“Oh well, I can help.” Aziraphale put his book down quickly, “Basically the Bible is this book that people have to worship God. I’ve been reading about wizards and I think the correct way to put it would be that God is similar to Merlin, but for muggles.”</p><p>Crowley smirked, “Okay, makes sense.”</p><p>A prefect slid open the door, quietly. They both looked up. </p><p>“We’re nearly there. Please change into your robes soon.” She smiled and then closed the door and moved along the train. Crowley turned to Aziraphale and grinned.</p><p>“What do you think it will be like?”</p><p>“You have more idea than me.” Aziraphale chuckled.</p><p>The trip from the train to Hogwarts wasn’t much time at all. They had separated the first years but now the sorting ceremony was starting. They filed into the hall slowly, Crowley nudged Aziraphale and pointed at the ceiling. Stars were littered everywhere and they made Crowley’s eyes shine with glee.</p><p>“I love stars.” He murmured.</p><p>“They are beautiful.” Aziraphale smiled.</p><p>The old sorting hat was in tatters. Crowley didn’t know how it could tell who anyone even was anymore. A few Griffindors and a Ravenclaw had been sorted already.</p><p>“Anthony Crowley.” Professor McGonagall announced. Crowley stalked over to the hat, aware of the unwanted muttering that his name caused.</p><p>“Ahh. A new Crowley,” The sorting hat announced, “I’m putting you in SLYTHERIN!” It shouted.</p><p>Aziraphale watched as Crowley’s face contorted into a small smile and the hall seemed to go quiet with unease, except the Slytherins who cheered. He jerked up and walked to the Slytherin table, avoiding everyone’s stares. Aziraphale tried to smile at him but he didn’t notice.</p><p>“Aziraphale Eden.” She called.</p><p>Aziraphale sat down gently.</p><p>“Aziraphale. Hmm. Griffindor is off the table straight away. You’re not very adventurous. Slytherin is out too. Can’t send a muggle-born there. You’re extremely intelligent, Aziraphale, but Ravenclaw wouldn’t fit you. You are definitely HUFFLEPUFF!” Aziraphale smiled and the Hufflepuff table cheered him.</p><p>There was a gap between Crowley and the rest of the table, not large enough to be too noticeable but a gap nonetheless. Aziraphale sat down as calmly as he could. He caught himself staring at Crowley from across the room. Crowley glanced up at him and gently smiled. </p><p>Everyone was sorted quickly and then the feast began. Aziraphale was looking forward to this the most. He noticed though that Crowley hadn’t eaten much and the feast was nearly over.</p><p>Crowley has his head in his hands. Aziraphale picked up a slice of angel cake and put it on his plate and then noticed that Crowley was smirking at him.</p><p>When they were all leaving the Great Hall, Crowley hang back from his house, he nudged Aziraphale, “Looked like you enjoyed that cake, Angel.”</p><p>“Very funny.” He tried to hide his smile. Both the house dorms were in the basement so completely disregarding their houses, they walked slightly behind the crowds, together. Crowley heard a few people call Aziraphale’s name when they reached the door but he didn’t move.</p><p>“Right, well, I think you’re being called.” Crowley stammered.</p><p>“Ah, yes I am. Well. Goodnight, Crowley.” He smiled and turned away.</p><p>“Night, Angel.”</p><p>When Aziraphale glanced back again, the Slytherin door had closed.</p><p>As the weeks past, Aziraphale started to adjust more. Two boys in his dorm had been quite chatty with him. Their names were Newt and Brian. Brian had been explaining that he and his friends had been separated. Wensleydale in Ravenclaw, Adam in Gryffindor and Pepper in Slytherin. He said he’d introduce Aziraphale to them when he got the chance. </p><p>“Do you know anyone here?” Brian asked.</p><p>“Not really. I meant someone on the train though.” Aziraphale smiled.</p><p>“What’s their name?” Brian popped the last of his chocolate frogs into his mouth.</p><p>“Crowley.”</p><p>Brian coughed, “Crowley?”</p><p>“Yes, do you know him?”</p><p>“Know him? No one knows him. Everyone’s heard of him though. And his family.” Brian rambled.</p><p>“What do you mean?” Aziraphale frowned.</p><p>“Crowley’s family have done some bad things. Really bad. If I were you, I’d avoid him. It’ll end badly.” Brian cringed. </p><p>“Oh. Alright,” He stood up quickly, “I think I’m going to go to the library. See you in a bit, Brian.” He didn’t understand Crowley. He didn’t think he was bad. But everyone seemed to be wary of him.</p><p>Aziraphale turned sharply round a corner and collided with someone. They both fell to the floor.</p><p>“Oh I’m terribly sorry.” Aziraphale said quickly, sitting himself up.</p><p>“Angel?” Crowley sat up slowly, rubbing his head. He ran his hands through his hair and raised his eyes to Aziraphale’s, who’s brain had short circuited as soon as he heard Crowley’s voice. </p><p>“Crowley.” He breathed. </p><p>“Why were you going so fast?” He chuckled.</p><p>“I was going to the library.” He answered.</p><p>“They aren’t going to run out of books, angel.” He smirked, “Come on.” He stood up gracefully and held out his hand to help him up. Aziraphale took it.</p><p>“You don’t have to come with me, you know?” Aziraphale turned and said as they were walking down the corridor.</p><p>“I’m just making sure you don’t walk into anyone else. I’ve been looking for you actually.” He tilted his head.</p><p>“You have?” He asked softly.</p><p>“Yeah. ‘Course. Just because we’re in different houses doesn’t mean we can’t be friends.”</p><p>“We’re not friends.” He stated, remembering what Brian had told him about Crowley.</p><p>“Not yet.” He smirked.</p><p>The first few months weren’t too hard for Aziraphale academically. However, it was hard pretending he wasn’t friends with Crowley when his dorm mates asked what he’d been doing. He was bad at lying. Every time he saw Crowley, he wanted to tell him how much he enjoyed being his friend but he knew that everyone would disapprove. Crowley wasn’t in any of his classes but they found ways to see each other.</p><p>The first few months weren’t hard for Crowley socially. He really liked Aziraphale and everyone else was too scared of him to try and be friends. The only people in Slytherin who were making an effort were Hastur and Bee who he’d known since he was a baby.</p><p>The term ended in a few days and Aziraphale was really enjoying Hogwarts. </p><p>He briskly walked to the library. It was their meeting place. Crowley didn’t read. He’d explained it once. How the words muddled up so he just didn’t try. Aziraphale started reading to him then and Crowley didn’t argue.</p><p>“Hey Angel.” Crowley smiled.</p><p>“Hello.”</p><p>“Can we go to the lake today? I just want to talk and you aren’t allowed to in the library.”</p><p>“I don’t see why not.” </p><p>As they got down to the lake, Aziraphale noticed Crowley was shivering. It was his fault. He was the one who wanted to leave the castle.</p><p>Before Crowley could process it, Aziraphale had draped his coat over Crowley’s shoulders. It was warm and he wrapped himself up in it. It smelt like Aziraphale too; old books, hot cocoa and angel cake. He glanced at Aziraphale who was looking at the snow drifting down onto the lake and smiled.</p><p>“Thank you.” Crowley said sheepishly.</p><p>“I always tell you that you should wear a coat and you never do.” He chuckled, a breath of white air huffed out his mouth and he held his hands together.</p><p>“You’re cold now. Here-“ He tried to hand back the coat, but Aziraphale wouldn’t take it.</p><p>“-No. You know you’re colder than me.”</p><p>“You’re too nice to me sometimes.” He smiled.</p><p>“Well, I am a Hufflepuff.”</p><p>“You’re the nicest Hufflepuff I know.”</p><p>They both turned and smiled at each other.</p><p>“What did you want to talk about earlier? I mean it’s why we’re standing in the cold, right?” Aziraphale reminded him.</p><p>“Oh I just wanted to ask what you were doing when term ends. I’m guessing you’re probably going home, but I was wondering if you wanted to see each other over the holidays and ngk I don’t know-“ He cut himself off, when he realised that Aziraphale was just watching him ramble.</p><p>“I am going home. There’s a lot of services that my family always go to and I can’t miss them. Do you want my address so you can send an owl when you’re free?” He guessed.</p><p>“Yes. That’s what I was getting to.” Crowley added.</p><p>The train left and it was snowing. Aziraphale was sat with his Hufflepuff friends but halfway there, he excused himself. He walked down the train until he saw Crowley in a carriage with about 4 other Slytherins and they were all laughing about something. Crowley looked up and saw him and his eyes widened. He gestured for Aziraphale to move out of view from the carriage.</p><p>Aziraphale heard him make some excuse to leave and then shut the door of the carriage and walked toward him.</p><p>“Hi.”</p><p>“Sorry I guess I’m a bit earlier than we arranged.” Aziraphale apologised.</p><p>“Don’t worry about it, Angel. I was so ready for you to drag me away from there.” He smiled.</p><p>According to Aziraphale, the train journey ended too soon. He said goodbye to Crowley and stepped out onto the platform then headed to his parents. They seemed relieved that he showed up so they could leave. Aziraphale glanced back and saw Crowley look around for his parents and notice a house elf then walk over to her and nod solemnly and then start to leave. He glanced up at Aziraphale at the last second and stared after him.</p>
