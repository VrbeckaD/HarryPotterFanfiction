They are reading The Tales of Beedle The Bard. There is large bookcase on the background, small wooden table is in the corner with framed photos and lamp on it. Baby broom is resting at the bookcase, it is a gift from Harry. Pygmy puff is hiding on one of the shelves, Weasley twins are admiring Teddy and gifting all the new toys from WWW to him one of the first. On the sofa near the window Remus left his bag. In my imagination Remus has only come back from Hogwarts, where he is working as a professor. The day was exhausting, but he couldnâ€™t refuse Teddy to read the book together" width="793" height="799"/>
