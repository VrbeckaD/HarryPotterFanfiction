          <div class="userstuff"><p>“Don’t worry, they’re going to love you,” Harry said with a smile, rubbing soothing circles into Draco’s back. Draco snorted, <em>easy for him to say. </em>Draco was the first boyfriend Harry was ever bringing home, and he was fairly certain Harry hadn’t even bothered telling his parents that he was bringing home a boy. He had just used the phrase, “Someone very special to me.” He loved his boyfriend terribly, but Harry <em>clearly </em>lacked a sense of self-preservation that for Draco had been such a crucial part of his upbringing. “I should warn you though, my parents are kind of gym rats too.”</p><p>“Great, so I’ll be this little twig at a table where everyone could bench press me and tear me in half,” Draco said with a snort.</p><p>Harry merely chuckled, “I like bench pressing you.”</p><p>Draco blushed crimson at that, as the two made their way down to the carpark from their school. Draco would never admit how much he liked it too. There was something about knowing that Harry could easily lift him, not only once but repeatedly, for what seemed like hours that really got to Draco, and made his legs tremble. It didn’t hurt that Harry had a habit of manhandling him most of the time, pulling Draco into his lap during lunch, or just at random whenever they were together, or pressing soft kisses to the side of his head. Harry was nothing if not affectionate and though Draco loved it, it was unfamiliar to him. Deep in his mind, he felt like he shouldn’t be doing this, but of course, he loved Harry. Loved sitting in his lap, and the small kisses loved the way Harry would just hold him. Not asking anything of him, not trying to push him into anything, just… holding him tight with loving reverence.</p><p>Draco swallowed back his nerves as best as he could as Harry drove them out of the city and into the suburbs where his parents lived. It was a relatively short drive, all things considered, though it felt like an eternity. Frankly, everything felt like an eternity, and Draco felt as though he was being walked to the gallows. <em>What if they hate me? </em>he wondered. <em>What if they don’t think I’m good enough for their son? What if they’re homophobic and Harry is too good to realize it? What if… </em>he was starting to panic. Harry placed a hand on his knee and smiled at him.</p><p>Draco sighed, he needed to believe in Harry, he thought. Needed to believe that Harry <em>must </em>know his parents well enough to know how they would react, right? Draco couldn’t say he did. He was fairly certain his father would react poorly, judging by how he had reacted to hearing Pansy was a lesbian, but his mother… she was a different story. Narcissa Malfoy was notoriously unreadable.  Never giving away more than she was prepared to at any given time. Draco had tried not to think too hard on it.</p><p>“Everything is going to be great,” Harry promised. Draco took a deep breath as the car came to a halt outside a handsome two-story country home. Harry came around the other side and opened his door for him. Draco blushed, taking Harry’s hand and the two made their way up toward the house.</p><p>“I’m home,” Harry said, pushing open the door. Draco swallowed, following close behind him, his hand still in Harry’s.</p><p>“Hello darling,” Harry’s mother appeared quite quickly a few moments later. Draco’s eyes widened. Harry hadn’t been kidding when he said his parents were gym rats. His mother’s arms looked almost larger than his whole head, and he was fairly certain she had at least a six-pack hidden under her t-shirt.</p><p>“Mum,” Harry said. “This is Draco. My boyfriend.”</p><p>Harry’s mother smiled, pulling Draco in for a hug. “Well Draco, it’s so lovely to meet you. You are so absolutely adorable,” she said. Draco gasped, feeling his bones crunch under her tight hug.</p><p>“Darling, you should have told us you were bringing home your boyfriend, I would have dressed up out of these gym clothes,” she said, shaking her head.</p><p>“I said someone special to me,” Harry argued. “Where’s dad?”</p><p>“Out on his night run,” Harry’s mother said. She smiled at Draco. “You have a great figure, do you work out?”</p><p>“Er… no, just lucky I guess.”</p><p>The woman nodded, “You are just precious. Whoever knew Harry would have such an adorable boyfriend.” Draco was worried Harry’s mother might pinch his cheeks next.</p><p>“We’ll have dinner soon, I hope you don’t mind tandoori tofu. We don’t eat meat or dairy. James is actually <em>very </em>lactose intolerant. So we make it work.”</p><p>Draco blinked, “I’ve never had tofu,” he admitted.</p><p>At this Harry’s mother looked aghast. “Well, you will absolutely love it. Harry’s father is a brilliant cook, which is a good thing because I couldn’t cook to save my life,” at this she laughed.</p><p>Draco smiled. “I’m not much of a cook either,” he admitted.</p><p>“Well luckily for you, our Harry takes after his father in that regard. He’s just a fabulous little cook.”</p><p>Harry smiled, “Mum.”</p><p>“Oh look at me, carrying on. I’ll leave you, two boys, alone for a while. Go show Draco your bedroom Harry, but mind you’re not getting up to any funny business.”</p><p>“Mum!” Harry groaned, making his out of the kitchen and towards the stairs.</p><p>“I’ll call you when dinner’s ready,” she called after them. Draco followed Harry awkwardly up the stairs.</p><p>“Well, that went better than I would have thought,” Draco admitted.</p><p>“Just wait till you meet my dad, he’s a laugh riot,” Harry replied as they reached the landing and made their way into Harry’s bedroom. </p><p>“Do you think I’m too skinny?” Draco asked, staring at himself in the full-length mirror on the door of Harry’s closet.</p><p>“No,” Harry said, wrapping his arms around Draco’s waist from behind. “You’re perfect.”</p><p>“Easy for you to say, you’re ripped. I’m all soft, and bony.”</p><p>Harry chuckled. “I like you soft and bony. Besides you don’t have to have muscles and workout just because my family does.”</p><p>Draco sighed, “I’m not used to dating an Adonis.”</p><p>Harry smirked, “You’re not exactly ugly dear.”</p><p>“No but I’m not you,” Draco said.</p><p>Harry turned him around then, so they were face to face. “Draco, I wouldn’t want to date someone who looked like me. That’s not what I’m attracted to. I’m attracted to you. You’re beautiful and sweet, and you make me happy. That’s all that matters.”</p><p>Draco sighed, laying his head on Harry’s chest. “Thank you,” he said. Harry held him tight.</p><p>“Of course my love,” he replied.</p><hr/><p class="p1">
