    <p>Seven Days! </p><p>Seven fucking days after the battle of Hogwarts, Harry goddamn fucking Potter sent her on a mission. </p><p>SEVEN. FUCKING. DAYS! </p><p>Hermione was beyond furious as she paced before the gates. She was not at the gates of her beloved Hogwarts. No. He sent her <i>here</i>, the place of nightmares. Her arm still stung beneath the warmth of the charm the Mediwitches placed on her. It had only been two months prior that Bellatrix tortured her inside the Malfoy Manor – where Harry had sent her.</p><p>“Ahem.”</p><p>Hermione jumped at the sound, unaware anyone was present. Hermione turned and casually leaning against a pillar was Draco. Hermione’s eyes widened and she gasped before her hand flew to her mouth and her cheeks burned. Draco wasn’t dressed in his usual dark clothing. He was wearing a pair of blue denim jeans, an emerald green shirt, and his hair wasn’t slicked back in its usual aristocratic way. His hair lazily hung low into his eyes which he combed back with his fingers. Draco Malfoy looked different yet the same.</p><p>Hermione’s anger, which had momentarily simmered, came back to boil. Without a word, but a flick of her wand, Hermione gagged Malfoy before he vanished. Taking a deep breath, Hermione entered the grounds of Malfoy Manor once more. She approached slowly, drinking in the enormity of the Manor. Hermione was both amazed and confused. She can’t remember the Manor being “light”. She can only recall it as place of darkness. Yet the bright sandstone building almost blinded her as she finally reached the entrance.</p><p>At the same time, Draco reappeared, soaking wet and his shoes made a “sploshing” sound with every step he took. His face now wore the same hard pinched look she remembered from school, she could feel the same contempt as he could, and it took everything she had in her to stop her lips from curling up. </p><p>“Enjoy your swim?” She said bitterly.</p><p>“Quite.” He threw the gag at her, but she missed it, and it dropped to the ground with a soft splat. “I’d have preferred it if I was able to breathe properly.”</p><p>“You don’t deserve it!” Hermione’s anger was back, and she was now comforted with the emotion. “I don’t even understand why you are here and not rotting in Azkaban.”</p><p>Draco had no reply, he just smiled at her. This confused Hermione as she was waiting for a smirk and an insult. But he just smiled. She was about to say something when the door opened.</p><p>“Hello…What on earth?” Narcissa Malfoy looked at her son, her shock evident on her face. “Have you lost your mind?”</p><p>Hermione didn’t hide her smile this time, but instead bit her tongue to hold back her laughter. </p><p>“My apologies.” Draco said and Hermione could see him fighting back his response. He turned to her though, his cold grey eyes boring into hers. “Excuse me, it would appear I need to change.”</p><p>“Into a ferret? Too late.” The words flew out of Hermione’s mouth before she knew what she was saying, but she wasn’t the least bit sorry.</p><p>Recognition flared in his eyes and Draco stormed passed his mother, his shoes sloshing and leaving a wet trail in his wake.</p><p>Narcissa looked at Hermione, though there was only a hint of a smile there. “Was that you who decided my son needed a swim in the pool?” She said as she stepped aside to allow Hermione to enter.</p><p>“I was angry.” Hermione answered honestly, but gasped as she stepped inside the Manor. Hermione was expecting a normal looking house. What greeted her was…Hogwarts. “What the…”</p><p>Hermione turned in every direction. “When the students start arriving, I wanted them to feel safe.”</p><p>When Harry had agreed to relocate the students from Hogwarts, she never in her wildest dreams thought he’d agree to Malfoy Manor. She was yet to even understand why the Malfoys and Harry could ever be in agreeance with each other. Yet, here she was, sent to oversee the transfer and that all Dark artefacts had been properly removed and catalogued for the Ministry.</p><p>“Only the East wing has been charmed to accommodate the students. The West wing is still our private home.” Narcissa said as `she led Hermione to the left.</p><p>Behind a portrait was a doorway, as they stepped through, Hermione found herself in a living room. It was a large, open room and to her right was a kitchen. To her left there were huge glass, bi-fold doors that led out to the gardens. Again, Hermione felt confused. Everything was light in colour with very elegant floral arrangements. She felt like she was in a completely different home.</p><p>“It is different.” Narcissa said, as if reading Hermione’s mind. “The last few days have been extremely difficult but refreshing.”</p><p>Hermione furrowed her brows as she still had no idea what she was doing here. Her anger was beginning to return, but Narcissa began walking through, motioning for Hermione to follow. There was a hallway in front of them and a staircase. They ascended the stairs, just as they reached the top Draco emerged from his room. This time he was wearing dark jeans with a blue shirt and Hermione’s eyes met his.</p><p>“Just in time, Draco,” Narcissa smiled. “You’ll be working up here.” Narcissa opened a door opposite where Draco appeared from and Hermione entered the room. “This is Draco’s personal study. I have set this up as your office, much to Draco’s displeasure.” Narcissa’s tone changed and Hermione picked up on the fact Narcissa wasn’t happy at the last comment.</p><p>Hermione sat her bag down on a nearby armchair and explored the room. It was impressive. The walls were lined with books, pictures in frames, little mementos, and personal touches. But what impressed her the most, was there was no hint, not even one thing, that reflected Slytherin in this room. </p><p>Hermione relaxed and finally smiled. “There are so many books here,” she said as her fingers traced over volumes of books she’d never heard of. She looked back at Draco. “I thought you’d have more green in here.”</p><p>Draco remained silent and expressionless but Narcissa grinned. “Draco prefers to keep school, at school.” Narcissa crossed the room to a shelf and pulled a book down and flipped through its pages. “I haven’t cleared this room of anything.” Narcissa said as she handed the book over to Hermione.</p><p>“Earth Magic.” Hermione said as she read the title. </p><p>Narcissa took a deep breath, sighed, and leaned on the back of a sofa. “That book,” she said as she pointed to the one in Hermione’s hand. “Would be considered Dark Magic by the Ministry. You wouldn’t find that in the library at Hogwarts.”</p><p>“Why?” Hermione opened the book to a random page and began to read. “The Earth will work with you to enhance your power. You can draw on the elements but be aware of one’s emotions.” Hermione closed the book and smiled. “Sounds like the kind of stuff in movies.”</p><p>Narcissa laughed and chanced a look at Draco who was grinning. It was the first time Hermione had seen Draco show any emotion other than anger.</p><p>“We’re controlled in learning at school,” Draco said, making the hair at the back of her neck prickle. There was something in his tone that made her feel at ease. Her earlier anger was all but gone. “Magic simply exists. There really is no such thing as Dark Magic. Just Magic.”</p><p>“Oh, you mean like there is no such thing as Mudbloods, just Witches and Wizards?” There it was, her anger. Hermione threw the book down on the sofa behind Narcissa. “Why am I here?”</p><p>Draco was silent again, only this time his face was full of emotion. He looked conflicted. It was Narcissa who answered for him. “There has not been enough time for either of you to digest the last battle. But I assure you both that is about to change. Use the time we have wisely.”</p><p>Narcissa’s tone was motherly and pain ripped through Hermione like a knife as she thought of her own mother. A mother who would never remember she has a daughter.</p><p>“Mr Potter and I had a very lengthy discussion.” Narcissa said.</p><p>“You spoke to Potter?” Draco looked intrigued. “When?”</p><p>“When your father and I went to the Ministry a few days ago.”</p><p>“Father turned himself in?”</p><p>“He did.” Narcissa remained calm and Hermione felt like she shouldn’t be here for this conversation, but Harry didn’t tell her anything, so her interest was piqued. “He’s working with the Ministry to round up the rest of the Death Eaters. If he co-operates and abides by his terms of detainment, he will be given a full pardon.”</p><p>Hermione could not believe what she was hearing, and evidently, neither did Draco. “There is no way Potter is letting father go. You are a fool if you believe him.” Draco’s voice cracked and for the first time, she saw raw emotion in him. His face was one of despair. </p><p>“We will discuss this further at another time, Draco. I would say more, but…” Narcissa looked at Hermione. “I believe Mr Potter wishes to speak to you directly about this.” Hermione nodded, though there was an uneasy feeling growing in the pit of her stomach. </p><p>“Harry told me about your parents,” Narcissa continued. “I can’t even…” Narcissa was momentarily lost for words as her eyes became clouded. “It takes great skill to do what you did, not to mention the courage.” Narcissa wiped away her tears.</p><p>“Mother?”</p><p>“I leave this room to you, Miss Granger.” Narcissa ignored Draco for the moment. “You may use what is here to your own advantage or you can hand what you deem unsuitable over to the Ministry. However, I think,” Narcissa looked around the room. “That you’ll find what you need here to help you recover your parents.”</p><p>Silence greeted the room as Hermione looked over all the books. She honestly had no idea what to say. Could she really restore their memories without causing permanent damage? When Hermione made no effort to respond, Narcissa ushered Draco out of the room and Hermione sat on the sofa.</p><p>“What the hell is going on, Harry?” She whispered to herself.</p>

  <p>~~*~~</p>
</center>Later that evening, Hermione returned to the Burrow. Harry and Ron were yet to arrive back from the Ministry with Arthur, Molly was just setting the table for dinner and George was laughing along with Ginny as Percy tried to solve a puzzle that kept flying out of his grasp.<p>“Hermione, dear.” Molly greeted her. “Sit down, dinner won’t be long.” </p><p>“Have you heard from Harry?” Ginny asked as Percy finally solved the puzzle and it floated back to the table.</p><p>“No.” Hermione shook her head and sat opposite her friend. “I was hoping the boys would be back by now.”</p><p>“They won’t be long,” Molly said as she pointed her finger towards her clock. “They moved to ‘Travelling’ about five minutes ago.”</p><p>No sooner had Molly placed the first dish on the table Arthur entered the room followed by Harry and Ron. Hermione immediately brightened as Ron came over to her, placing a soft kiss on her head before sitting beside her. Dinner had been different since the battle. George was coping well, under the circumstances, but there was a noticeable silence with the absence of Fred. </p><p>After dinner, Hermione, Ron, Harry and Ginny made their way up the many stairs to Ron’s room. Hermione giggled as she sat on Ron’s bed and he sat beside her. His arm wrapping around her, hugging her to him. Ginny and Harry sat on the ground and Hermione smiled as Harry had Ginny’s hand in his. </p><p>“How did today go?” Ron said to her.</p><p>“Yes.” Harry added. “How was the Manor shaping up? We’re sending the first lot of students there tomorrow.”</p><p>“Why there? Why not just send the students home?”</p><p>Harry hesitated, but Hermione knew him too well. He wasn’t sure how to explain things. “When I was in the forest, when I went to Voldemort, he used the killing curse on me again.” Ginny gasped, but Hermione figured something like that was going to happen. “It was really weird. I had a dream about Dumbledore and then I was awake in the forest.”<br/>
Harry paused again to gather his thoughts. “Voldemort needed confirmation that I was dead. It was Narcissa Malfoy that came to me. She felt my heart beating and knew I was alive. She only wanted to know if Draco was still alive. When I confirmed that he was, she lied to Voldemort. She told him I was dead.”</p><p>“She saved your life.” Hermione said and it made sense now. “But why the Manor?”</p><p>“We knew we had to get the students out of the castle. They are in tents now, but we are still recovering bodies. It’s best if they are relocated for now. We’ve allowed students to return home if they wish, but we also have some students who’ve lost their families. The Manor is big enough to cater for the students and because it is under Ministry watch, it will be just as protected as Hogwarts.”</p><p>Ginny hugged Harry tighter. “We should go see George before bed.” Harry nodded and looked at Hermione.</p><p>“Are you OK with this task?” </p><p>Hermione nodded. “I’ll be fine.”</p><p>Harry accepted her answer. “We’ll be back. We’ve been helping George with a new product.”</p><p>“The puzzle?” </p><p>Ginny smiled. “Yes. Harry suggested it. It’s based off the maze Harry faced in the Triwizard Tournament.” </p><p>Harry and Ginny left the room and as soon as they were gone, Ron was kissing Hermione’s neck. Hermione smiled, loving the warmth on her skin. She caught his chin with her hand and moved his lips to hers. She hugged him tight, pulling him down on top of her. He kissed her with a fiery passion, and she gasped as she felt his hand move up her abdomen under her shirt. </p><p>His hand cupped her breast, circling her nipple with his thumb. Hermione moaned and arched her back, pressing her body against Ron. Before she knew what was happening, Ron moved his lips to her breast, moving the fabric of her bra aside, his tongue flicking against her hardened nub before sucking it into his mouth. </p><p>“Oh, Ron,” Hermione grasped his head, holding him tight as her body responded to him, sending bolts of electricity right to her core. </p><p>Ron moved his hands to her waist, unbuttoning her jeans. His hand slid down, a finger sliding through the wetness as he found her clit. Hermione discarded her jacket and top but couldn’t remove her bra as Ron began to move his hand rhythmically. Her hips moved in time with his hand, her body began to tremble, and Ron moved his lips back to hers, kissing her deeply.</p><p>“I love you,” he whispered against her lips as Hermione’s body exploded underneath him. </p><p>It took Hermione a few minutes to recover, but she grinned, pulling Ron down to kiss her again. She moved her hand down his back, and around to the front of his jeans, feeling his hardness through the material. </p><p>“My turn,” She whispered to him and went to unbuckle his belt, when Ron stopped her.</p><p>“Wait,” He said, stopping her hand. He sat up on the bed, pulling Hermione up with him.</p><p>“What’s wrong?” Hermione asked. “Did I do something wrong?”</p><p>“No.” Ron smiled. “You are perfect. And I meant what I said. I love you.”</p><p>Hermione’s heart was hammering in her chest, the uneasy feeling she had earlier that day returned, and she couldn’t stop the tears pooling in her eyes. “What is it, Ron?”</p><p>Taking a deep breath, Ron looked at Hermione. “I’m not returning to finish Hogwarts. My Auror training has been approved and prioritised by Minister Shacklebolt. I’ll be helping Harry to reform the Ministry and go after the remaining Death Eaters.”</p><p>Hermione took a moment but smiled. “Ron, this is amazing.” She hugged him tight before pulling back again. “If they are going to accept you in, you won’t need to worry about the grades. This is good news.”</p><p>Ron was beaming at her, but his smile soon faded. “Hermione, unlike Harry, I won’t be in the offices much. I’ll be out in the field, I could be gone for days, weeks, or months at a time. I think it might be best if we cool it off for a while.”</p><p>Hermione was lost for words. She shook her head at the absurdity of all this. “What do you mean ‘cool it off’? What we just did is not cooling things off.” Hermione’s tears began to fall. “You’re breaking up with me. I can’t believe we just did…that and you’re breaking up with me.”</p><p>“Hermione, I didn’t mean for that to happen. It just did. I don’t regret it. It’s just, I don’t want us to go too far, then I leave, and we end up missing each other too much. Or you decide to not wait for me, or…”</p><p>“Or you find someone else?” Ron’s silence was enough for her. She found her top and jacket and put them back on and fixed up the rest of her clothing. “Goodbye, Ronald.”</p><p>Ron watched Hermione turn and as she was about to leave, he grabbed her arm and gently turned her. “Please, Hermione, don’t be like this.”</p><p>Hermione pulled her arm free from Ron’s grasp and she found her anger again for the day. “How else am I supposed to be, Ron?” She didn’t wait for a response, instead she went straight to Ginny’s room. </p><p>The room was empty when she arrived, but Hermione got herself ready for bed anyway. Her tears flowed fast making it difficult to see. But what she hated the most was that her body still lightly throbbed from Ron’s ministrations from earlier. She had never abandoned herself in such a way before. Ron was the first boy she had ever wanted to be with and now he was gone, she felt violated, used, and unlovable. Hermione climbed into bed and it didn’t take long for sleep to take over.</p>
