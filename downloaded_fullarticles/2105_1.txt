  <strong> <em>Hampstead, London</em> </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong> <em>22 February 1986</em> </strong>
</p><p> </p><p>The Grangers were just washing up after breakfast when the doorbell rang.</p><p>"I'll get it!" called 6 year old Hermione.</p><p>"No you won't," George Granger said. "Hermione, you know the rules."</p><p>Hermione's shoulders slumped. "But I was expecting..."</p><p>"I know, kiddo. But you don't answer the door. Even if you're expecting books."</p><p>Dr George Granger opened the door on the chain to find two men and a boy about Hermione's age on his front porch. His first impression was that they were religious proselytisers - they were all three dressed in suits. Though usually the religious doorknockers didn't have clothing quite so - expensively tailored. They all three looked as if they had just stepped out of a banker's office in the City - even the child. </p><p>"Can I help you?"</p><p>"Are you Dr George Granger?" one of the men asked. "We'd like to come in if we could. It's about your daughter, Hermione."</p><p>No. No, they could not.</p><p>"I'd like a little more information than that. Who are you?" he asked. He had his finger on the 'emergency call' button on the security system by the door. It would sound an alarm at the central monitoring station, and security guards would come out within twenty minutes. It was expensive technology, but worth it to keep his family safe.</p><p>"I'm Regulus Black, and this is my husband, Barty and our son Aries," the man said. He pulled out an identification card that showed that he was with Her Majesty's Home Office.</p><p>"Do you normally bring your family with you on government business?" George Granger asked.</p><p>"In these cases, I find it helps," Regulus Black said. He handed his ID card to George through the chain and said, "You should go to the phone book look up the phone number for the Home Office. Tell them you would like to verify that Regulus Black works for the Ministry of Extraordinary Education. We'll wait here."</p><p>"Papa..." the little boy protested. George was amused to see the other man pull him aside and hand him a book. The boy, disgruntled, sat on the step and started reading. <em>So he's just a normal kid. Even though they've got him dressed in a suit.</em></p><p>After a few minutes of verification, and consultation with his wife Jean, George let the strange family into his house. He couldn't help notice that the boy was staring at <em>everything, </em>as if he was visiting from another planet and was trying to work out what earthling homes were like. The adults were more circumspect, but seemed a little uncomfortable. </p><p>Jean rescued them all by offering tea, and by sending the children upstairs. Hermione was happy to take Aries's hand and pull him along, promising to show him all of her books and toys. And whatever strange place the men had come from, it was at least a place that served tea. They were perfectly comfortable with that social nicety.</p><p>Finally, Regulus Black set his teacup down and clasped his hands together in front of him. "I'm afraid there's no easy way to say it, so I'm just going to blurt it out. Magic is real, there are a secret population of witches and wizards all over the world, and your daughter is one of them."</p>
<hr/><p>"... Paul put you up to this," George finally said. His best friend was a champion practical joker - though how he'd arranged the Home Office to be in on it as well...</p><p>"Show us," Jean said, always the more pragmatic of the two.</p><p>The man who hadn't shown an ID... Barclay? Barney? reached inside his suit jacked and pulled out a thin stick. He waved it at one of the empty teacups, spoke a nonsense word, and the teacup changed shape and sprouted fur and... turned into a gerbil.</p><p>Jean reached out, scooped up the gerbil, and stroked it, confirming to herself that it was a living creature and no longer a teacup.</p><p>"This is an illusion," George said.</p><p>"This explains so much," Jean said.</p><p>"What do you mean?"</p><p>"The floating books. The exploding television. The time she screamed 'Quiet' and no one could talk for a quarter hour. The bathtub bubbles turning different colours," Jean said.</p><p>"I'm sure there's a scientific explanation for... all... this..." George said. He suddenly found himself floating halfway to the ceiling.</p><p>"Barty, put him down... gently." Regulus said. Barty did so, to George's relief.</p><p>"Are you really from the Home Office?" George said.</p><p>"I work for the Ministry of Magic," Regulus Black said. "It is a secret Ministry within Her Majesty's government. There is an International Statute of Secrecy to keep the knowledge of Magic a secret from the muggles - that's non-magical people, but exceptions are made for direct family members of magicals as well as certain government officials. To most of the government, my department is known as the Ministry for Extraordinary Education. But officially, we are the Ministry for Magical Education."</p><p>"So what does it mean?" Jean asked.</p><p>"Normally, about 90% of magical children are born into magical families, so they have adult magicals around them to help them learn to control their magic. For the 10% that aren't, we assign them a family to act as their intermediary to the magical world. When she is age 11, she can begin boarding school in Scotland, but in the meantime, she can be introduced to other magical children, such as Aries, and learn about the magical world." Regulus said.</p><p>They talked about school. Regulus admitted that there were other magical schools besides Hogwarts, but that Hogwarts was the one he went to, and so he was biased. They asked whether there were books explaining what was going on. Barty pulled books out of his pocket that should not possibly have fit in there (more evidence of magic). They discussed the magical section of the British Museum, and how to get to Diagon Alley.</p><p>On the whole, despite George's skepticism, and their completely different cultural backgrounds, they had a lot in common. They were all four swots, for example. Regulus wasn't nearly as much of one as Barty, but even he was eager to explore the Grangers' bookcases. Regulus was pleased that they didn't seem to have the muggle attitude against gay relationships that he'd noticed when he'd done these visits before, pulling away as if they thought he was contagious. </p><p>One of the reasons Regulus brought his family to these visits was to let them see a wizarding child. But another was because he and Barty wanted to 'adopt' a muggleborn family. They were just waiting for the right family to click with. If the family had a problem with his choice of partner, then obviously he wasn't going to put in the time to form a closer relationship, and he passed their names along to be matched with someone else. </p><p>Maybe, with the Grangers...</p><p>"Mummy! Daddy! Aries can do magic! It's not just me! It's not just me!" Hermione shouted, and came running down the stairs, tripping over the last three in her haste and excitement. Barty still had his wand out and caught her in mid air and floated her into her parents's arms. She was so excited that she barely noticed. "Look! Look! He turned my hair BLUE! Because I said it was my favourite colour!" </p><p>Aries came running down behind them. "Hermynee showed me her tellovizh!" he announced happily. "We watched Cartunes!"</p><p>Jean laughed, and George ruffled his hands through his daughter's blue hair. "It's beautiful," he said. "You're my beautiful, magical witch."</p>
