  <em>October 5th, 1995</em>
</p><p>Harry James Potter, a Slytherin, sat outside near a tree thinking about the beautiful Gryffindor girl he met on his first day ever at Hogwarts. He loved her with all his heart. She was kind, caring, loving, beautiful, and helpful. He highly doubted that she loved him back since he was a Slytherin. Even if she did love him back, they probably wouldn't date each other. A Slytherin and Gryffindor dating or even being friends with each other was unacceptable. The only people Harry knew who would be alright with dating a Gryffindor were his three friends Draco Malfoy, Daphne Greengrass, and Hagrid. And Professor Snape would also be alright with it.</p><p>He remembered when he started 4th year, he started having dreams about Hermione. He always did since later in his first year but, starting in 4th year, it was very different. He had thought of someone to tell why was there a wet spot on his underwear. He had decided to ask Professor Snape about it since he thought of him as a father figure. A father figure was what he was glad to have since both his father and mother were murdered by Lord Voldemort when he was only a year old. The Dursleys treated Harry like dirt so, Uncle Vernon wasn't a father figure, Aunt Petunia wasn't a mother figure, and Dudley defiantly wasn't a brother figure.</p><p>When he asked Professor Snape, he remembered him saying: "What kind of dream did you have?" He had told him about the dream and who the person was. Professor Snape told him not to worry and that was perfectly normal. Professor Snape knew that Harry loved Hermione with all his heart and knew why he was scared to date her if she loved him back. Professor Snape thought of Harry as the son he never had. </p><p>
  <em>A Few Hours Later</em>
</p><p>Harry stood on the Astronomy Tower with a notice-me-not charm and a silencing charm on him as it was time for all students to be in their dorms, watching the night sky and the night stars. He often did this when he was going through a lot of stress or when he needed to think. He was thinking if he should tell Hermione his true feelings for her and if she loved him too, he was thinking if he should date her or not. I wonder what my mother and father would say. "Harry," a voice said. Harry recognized that voice. It was his father's voice. When it kept on happening before, he had told Professor Dumbledore and told him, that his mother and father decided when they died, they would be able to talk to Harry in his head.</p><p>"Don't be scared to admit your feelings to Hermione. Even if I was a Slytherin, I wouldn't be afraid to admit my feelings for Lily. You should never hide your feelings from someone you love regardless of what house you're in."</p><p>"Your father's right," A voice said which Harry knew was his mother's.</p><p>Harry smiled and said softly: "I guess your right."</p><p>Harry then asked a question he never asked before. "Are you mad at me for being in Slytherin?"</p><p>"No Harry," James said. "Your only one of the few who truly represents Slytherin. You did a good job changing the Malfoy boy's thoughts on non-purebloods and non-witches and wizards." </p><p>"Your father's right Harry," Lily said.</p><p>Harry was relieved to hear that his parents didn't hate and weren't even mad at him for being in Slytherin.</p><p>"So, do I need to confess my feelings to Hermione tomorrow?" Harry asked.</p><p>"It doesn't have to be tomorrow. You can do it when your ready Progslet," James said smiling.</p><p>"Thanks, Father," Harry said smiling</p><p>"Anytime Progslet."</p><p>"Well, I think I'll be heading to the Slytherin dorms. Good night mum and dad," Harry said in a neutral voice.</p><p>"Good night Harry," Lily and James said at the same time.</p><p>Harry put on his invisibility cloak and put out both charms he did and then walked to the Slytherin Dormitories. When he was at the door, he said the password, and the door opened, he went inside and went upstairs to the boy's dormitory.</p><p>When he walked up to his bed, he put his invisibility cloak in his bag and got his bed and layed down. After thirty minutes, he fell asleep.</p><p> </p><p> </p>
