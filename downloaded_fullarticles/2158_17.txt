I shudder this was his bad and why was is bad  always that small. I feel nervous and  I feel little awkward at my big cloths. His eyes were looking at me when i finally sit on the bad. My back to him.A hands fall on my back making me jump but then it was gone.</p><p>" harry" Ron asked gently</p><p>I turn and throw myself at him , burying my face at his chest. He seems startle foe a moment but then put his hands on my hair to make me clam my shaking.and before i cab stop myself i am telling him everything what happened with ginny and me. How i had lied about my sexuality and how she had looked at me with angry tears.i just kept taking but Ron never interrupted me and i am grateful for that moment .i tell him she called me a liar .i tell him everything, well i tell him almost everything.when i got to the part where she asked me if i was in love with him, i stopped and the words won't come out of my mouth, and i think that okay for Now. Maybe someday i will be able to tell him how it ended.</p><p>After i am done talking i felt my throat dry,and i felt hollow and soft inside and little bit reviled. Through all the talking Ron kept his hand on my hair tugging gently. At one pointe his hand rub against my eyebrows. I lay curled up against him not wanting to thought the things i am saying about his own little sister. After a long puse he spoke.</p><p>"It's kinda sound stupid when you speak like that "</p><p>i looked at him confused.

I lay stiffly against him, wanting an answer.</p><p>"Don't worry harry i am not going anywhere "</p><p>I tried to sit back up but he just holds me against his chest. When i speck my lips are moving against the fabric of his shirt. I saw his nipple get harden and a dark buzz want through my body.</p><p>"You also said your mom you would have to leave eventually"</p><p>"Ye. Yes " he draws out.</p><p>"Then why are you leaving.

I punched his arm gently. He catches my hand and entwins our fingers together.</p><p>"You are not mysterious" i tell him seriously.</p><p>"Please" he scuffles.i rolled my eyes.</p><p>"I didn't tell ginny everything well she looks broken after you two broke up and i didn't wanted to hurt her more.so i just tell her everything that involves you...."</p><p>"What involves me ?.....
