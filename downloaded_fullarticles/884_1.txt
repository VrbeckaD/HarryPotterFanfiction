  <em>How long, baby, have I been away?</em>
  <br/>
  <em>Oh, it feels like ages though you say it's only days.</em>
  <br/>
  <em>There ain't language for the things I've seen.</em>
  <br/>
  <em>And the truth is stranger than my own worst dreams.</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p align="center">---</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Hermione had not been expecting this.</p><p>Draco and Blaise promised her that it’s only going to be a small gathering for their homecoming and her birthday. <em>Just a few friends,</em> the men had told her. <em>A small party, nothing big.</em> She should’ve known better than to trust the word of a consummate Slytherin—reformed or not. <em>The lying bastards.</em></p><p>Hermione was sure there were at least fifty people in Blaise’s rather large apartment. Knowing him, there were probably more. Nearly all their classmates from every house were there even the ones she hadn’t interacted with during her stay at Hogwarts. It still felt surreal to see them all in one place and not a single fight breaking out.</p><p>It wasn’t that she wasn’t grateful. She knew they both had meant well, they always did when it comes to her, but tonight she had really just wanted a small party. She’d been looking forward to catching up with Harry and the rest of her old friends. She sighed. <em>Oh well.</em> Nothing she could do about it now.</p><p>It had been five years since she left London and went to the US to continue her studies. She was really surprised to bump into Draco and Blaise one day as she rushed towards her first class. She found out that they were both taking Mastery in Potions and they were classmates.</p><p>She pretended not to know the two for a week but living in a foreign land all by yourself tended to bring out something that makes you reach out to something familiar.</p><p>But it was Draco who approached her first. Claiming he’s having difficulty about brewing a certain potion for their preliminary practical exam. Hermione immediately recognized it as a truce of sorts. Probably urged by Draco, Blaise eventually reached out to her too and so began their road to forgiveness and healing.</p><p>But that newfound friendship was tested two weeks later when Hermione found out she was pregnant. Throughout her pregnancy, Draco kept asking who the father was but Hermione kept her mouth firmly shut.</p><p><em>It’s none of your business,</em> she would always say and Draco eventually ceased asking.</p><p>The child’s paternity came into question again when Hermione finally gave birth to a boy with sandy colored hair and a pair of pale grey eyes. As luck would have it, Draco was the one who accompanied her to the hospital.</p><p>
  <em>“So it was true,” Draco said as he cradled the child in his arms. Hermione felt fear gripped her insides. “About you and father.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>There was no point in hiding it anymore. “Yes,” she said softly. She reached out her arms and Draco gently placed the sleeping baby in it. “How did you know? Did he tell you?”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“No. I just noticed things. Don’t worry, I won’t tell him.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Hermione looked up at him, surprised. “Why?”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“As you said,” he flashed her a boyish grin, “it’s not my business.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Thank you, Draco,” she said as tears started to form in her eyes. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“So what are you going to name the little one?”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“I was thinking of Roman.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"My great grandfather's name was Roman," Draco seemed to ponder that for a moment before nodding his head in approval. “Roman Malfoy. I like it.”</em>
</p><p>“Mommy!”</p><p>Her son broke her train of thought. Hermione watched as Roman skidded to a halt in front of her, face flushed from running around the apartment all day. She scooped him up in her arms. “Happy birthday mommy!” The five-year-old threw his arms around Hermione’s neck and kissed her soundly on the cheek.</p><p>“Thank you, angel.”</p><p>“Big brother is gonna teach me quidditch! Oh, and Uncle Blaise and Harry too!”</p><p>At the mention of his name, Blaise Zabini approached the two.</p><p>"It's good to be back, isn't it?"</p><p>"It is," Hermione replied.</p><p>“You don’t mind, do you? Us teaching Roman how to ride a broom?” he asked as he ruffled her son’s sandy curls which have grown a lot and is now covering almost half of his face. “He’ll be riding with Potter so he’ll be perfectly safe.”</p><p>Hermione smiled and placed his son back on the ground. They both watched him run off and disappear to Merlin knows where. “No, not at all. Ever since his magic started showing, he’s been a huge ball of energy.”</p><p>“It's a sign that he's going to be a formidable wizard when he grows up,” he smirked.</p><p>"Is that so?"</p><p>"It is. Considering who his parents are."</p><p>Hermione remained silent at that.</p><p>She and Blaise were a different story. Hermione knew that the Italian wizard had developed feelings for her throughout their time in the US but the moment he found out the identity of Roman's father, he grew a bit distant with her although he still loved Roman as if he were his.</p><p>The news of her pregnancy soon reached London and everyone automatically assumed the father was either Blaise or Draco but most people assumed it was Blaise since Roman’s hair color was slightly similar to him than Draco’s.</p><p>
  <em>If only they knew.</em>
</p><p>A week after the news broke out, Harry came over to the US, using the Wizarding Summit as an excuse to “drop by” since he was “in the neighborhood”. Two days after that, Ginny came over when one of her quidditch matches was held in the US too.</p><p>A lot of her friends came over even Luna who was traveling with Rolf Scamander to study various magical beasts.</p><p>Ron was the last to visit. It started as a screaming match between the two, with their past being brought back again for discussion. It wasn’t until Roman came in that Ron suddenly calmed down.</p><p>
  <em>“He looks like you,” he said as he crouched down to face the child. “Hello there, mate.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Roman narrowed his eyes at the redheaded wizard. “I don’t like you. You’re mean to mum.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Roman!” Hermione chastised. “That’s rude.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Ron waved her off smiling. “It’s alright,” he said to her then he faced the child again. “Your mother and I were just discussing things. I apologize if I’m being mean.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The boy merely harrumphed and stormed off.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Draco’s bratty attitude is rubbing off on him,” Hermione sighed.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Well, it’s bound to happen. He’s a Malfoy after all.”</em>
</p><p>“Does Mr. Malfoy know?” Blaise asked her suddenly, bringing her back to the present. “I mean about—”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Blaise nodded. “It’s been five years, Hermione. Don’t you think—”</p><p>“He made his choice, Blaise.”</p><p>The Slytherin shrugged. “Alright, it’s your life. I’ve got to go find the little one, Happy birthday Hermione.”</p><p>Hermione watched Blaise walk away. She wondered vaguely where her son had got to, but she brushed the thought away, knowing he was more than safe here.</p><p>She glanced around, wondering, trying to spot Harry, Ron or Ginny amongst the crowd, but to no avail. She sighed and went to get a drink.</p><p>Hermione Granger had spent the last five years of her life juggling to raise her son and finish university. It was so damn hard and she almost gave up university in favor of getting a job to support her son. The money she had stored was only for her education. Getting pregnant wasn’t part of the budget.</p><p>Draco and Blaise were a live saver though. At first, she didn’t want to accept any help from them, especially Draco. Hermione eventually gave in when he told her that she and Roman are family whether she liked it or not and deserved only the best a Malfoy could give. And the fact that his father would have his head on a pike if he found out that Draco neglected his duties as big bother to Roman.</p><p>The subtle threat of Draco informing his father about Roman’s existence if Hermione didn’t accept his help only made her acquiesced more. Damn the Malfoys and their underhanded tactics.</p><p>She missed him sometimes. In fact, she missed him far more than she would care to admit. Draco still saw him on occasion but thank Merlin Draco never brought him to the apartment they were staying that Hermione didn’t have to endure his company. She didn’t think she would be able to stand it. Absentmindedly she wondered if he was happy. Happy with his choices.</p><p>“Are you alright?” A voice brought her back to reality. She must’ve been making a face.</p><p>“Oh yes, thank you!”</p><p>Hermione turned and in an instant, her whole world shifted. Pale grey eyes met her warm brown ones.</p><p>“Happy birthday, my dear.”</p><p> </p><p> </p>
