    <p>
  <span>There were a few times of the year that Sirius was really excited for. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Usually, the days and weeks and months flew by and they had a hard time keeping up with them, but one of those dates was rapidly approaching. New Year’s with the Potters was the other </span>
  <em>
    <span>big</span>
  </em>
  <span> event, and they supposed, their friends birthdays too, but Sirius’ birthday was a favourite. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It seemed a little self-centered to be excited for their own birthday. But Sirius had never really been able to celebrate it as a child, and their first birthday with the Potters had been so much fun, it had ignited something in them. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>This year, they and Remus had planned something quiet for their actual birthday. Sirius sort of wished there would have been a big party with all of their friends, but everyone seemed busy. Remus said they could all go for drinks on the Saturday before instead, maybe even to the jazz bar. The offer of Remus playing the piano had placated them enough to agree.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius had a vague feeling Remus had something planned, though. He was insistent on meeting Sirius at his flat, instead of coming to meet them at the studio or letting Sirius come to the gym. But James had also been incredibly stubborn and </span>
  <em>
    <span>insisted</span>
  </em>
  <span> Sirius stop by their flat to pick up their present. James, in that way brothers did, had grumbled and pouted and said </span>
  <em>
    <span>but we’re going away the day after, we won’t see you. Just come and swing by for five minutes, then go to Remus. You don’t want to begrudge your brother seeing you on your birthday, do you?</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>With a weary sigh, Sirius stepped off the bus, shouldering their bag as they walked the short distance around to James and Lily’s flat. Work had been good today; Marlene had put balloons all over the studio and sat at reception as each class came and went, instructing them all to sing Sirius happy birthday. Of course, all of their clients had been too terrified of Marlene to even entertain the idea of </span>
  <em>
    <span>not</span>
  </em>
  <span> singing. Sirius thought the sixth rendition of the day was going to be ringing around in their head all night.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As usual, Sirius got to James and Lily’s flat and knocked on the door twice before opening it to step in. Except, the door was locked. Strange, James and Lily’s door was </span>
  <em>
    <span>never</span>
  </em>
  <span> locked. Sirius bit their lip and knocked again.</span>
</p><p>After a moment, James appeared at the door, looking a little flustered. “Hey! Happy Birthday! Sorry, sorry, must’ve locked the door and forgotten. How’s your day of birth going, Your Royal Highness?” James sketched a little bow as he stepped back to let Sirius into the flat.</p><p>
  <span>Sirius rolled their eyes. “Hi, you idiot. I’ve had every class today sing Happy Birthday at me thanks to Marlene, so I appreciate you </span>
  <em>
    <span>not</span>
  </em>
  <span> breaking into song.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James gave them a look. “No you don’t. You love your birthday. Come on</span>
  <span>—</span>
  <span>” James grabbed their hand and pulled them down the hallway towards the kitchen</span>
  <span>—</span>
  <span> “your present is just in here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James hit the light switch just inside the doorway and Sirius immediately jumped in surprise as a loud cheer went up through the room. At the Potters farmhouse table sat Lily, Marlene, Dorcas, Frank, Alice, Mary and Peter. Remus stood at the head of the table, smiling at Sirius.</span>
</p><p>Sirius, for once, was speechless. “You…” It dawned on them all at once why everyone had said they were busy that evening, why Remus had been so insistent on seeing them at their flat, why James had been so insistent they come here. “You bunch of utter wankers, I love you.”</p><p>
  <span>“Aww, you love us!” Remus pulled them in for a kiss.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius melted into the kiss immediately, kissing back for a moment before they pulled away. “Did you plan all of this? You mastermind.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Maybe,” Remus said coyly, patting their cheek.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sirius, I was looking into your natal star chart, and I wrote up an overview for you. But I want to say that I think you’re really going to be having a wonderful year.” Mary smiled at them. She had her hand resting on her baby bump. The kid was going to be joining them soon and Sirius hoped it wasn’t tonight.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh,” Sirius said, grinning. “Thank you Mare, I hope the stars are right, then.” Remus lead them to the seat at the head of the table and Sirius sank into the chair, with what they presumed was Remus’ seat on one side and James on the other.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Marlene leaned forward over her lurid drink. “I think so too, Sirius. This is your year, darling.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“For sure, your year.” Remus sat down in the empty chair next to him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James poured them a healthy glass of wine before picking his own drink up. “To Sirius, and to a great year!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius covered their face with their hands, laughing a little. “You guys are ridiculous,” they tried to say, but everyone cheered over them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So, Sirius, what do you want the most?” Alice asked on the other end of the table.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius puffed out their cheeks, buying themselves time by taking a long drink of their wine. “Asking the big questions right off the bat, Al. I don’t know. If I tell my wishes, they won’t come true, will they?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s not true, putting it into the universe is supposed to help… Mare says that a lot.” Peter gave a nod.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius pointed towards Peter, and then to Mary. “Oi!” Sirius didn’t </span>
  <em>
    <span>want</span>
  </em>
  <span> to put their birthday wishes out into the universe. Most of them seemed ridiculously soppy. Sirius wanted to win another international pole competition. They wanted to still be with Remus in a year’s time. They wanted to be more comfortable in themselves. </span>
</p><p>“So, put it into the universe, Black.” Lily held a hand out.</p><p>“That’s a lot of pressure.” Remus laughed.</p><p>
  <span>Sirius looked between them all staring at him, Marlene with her glare, Dorcas grinning next to her fiancée, Alice and Frank interested, Mary placidly waiting as if the universe were listening next to her, Peter grinning. Lily raised an eyebrow and James was grinning his </span>
  <em>
    <span>stupid</span>
  </em>
  <span> grin. Sirius glanced to Remus, knowing one of their wishes was about him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re not going to let me eat without saying, are you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, probably not.” Lily nodded with a little grin</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius rolled their eyes. “Fine,” they said as they held up three fingers. “I want to win another international pole competition. I want to… feel better in myself, I guess. And I uh</span>
  <span>—</span>
  <span>” they glanced at Remus before looking back at their wine glass</span>
  <span>—</span>
  <span> “I want to still be with Remus this time next year.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Those are some great wishes.” Remus gave them a soft smile.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Mary sat back in her seat, nodding. “I think that’ll happen, Sirius. It’s a good year for you. Your Jupiter retrograde is going to be just lovely, I think.”</span>
</p><p>Sirius grinned at Remus, tearing their eyes away from him after a moment. “Thank you, Mare.” Sirius reached for Remus’ hand over the table and laced their fingers.</p><p> </p>
