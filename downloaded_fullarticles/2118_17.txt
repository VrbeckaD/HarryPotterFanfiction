    <p>Rose snuck out of her room past her parents' shouts and to the Floo. "Potter Residence."</p><p>A very tired Harry Potter appeared, his hair unruly as ever. "Rosie? What are you doing calling this late?"</p><p>"Is it a bad time?"</p><p>"No, no. Is everything okay?"</p><p>"Kind of. Can I come over? They're fighting again."</p><p>Harry nodded, and stepped a bit to the side as she fell through. "I'll get you some cocoa and we can talk if you'd like."</p><p>"I'd like that very much."</p><p>—-</p><p>"Does it bother you much?" Her uncle asked, chewing on his straw.</p><p>Rose nodded. "I don't know how you ever handled it, Uncle Harry."</p><p>"I don't either. Granted, I didn't live with them after they got married, so it's different kind of fights."</p><p>Rose nodded. "Hugo usually crawls under the bed and cries. He doesn't talk to Dad at all the next day. I know it hurts him a lot.”</p><p>Harry nodded. "It bothers you too. Have you talked to them about all this?"</p><p>"Mum usually cries if I try. Dad does too. Then they fight about fighting."</p><p>Harry nodded.</p><p>"How come you're so...indifferent to it? It doesn't seem to bother you." Rose asked, stirring her cocoa.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Harry shrugged. "I guess I'm used to yelling. I grew up with my uncle, who really liked to yell, and they yelled in school so,"<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Rose nodded again. "Thanks Uncle Harry."</p><p>"No problem Rosie. Why don't you kip in Lily's room for the night? If you need anything Gin's asleep and I'll be out here."</p><p>"Shouldn't you get to bed too?"</p><p>Harry laughed. "Can't. I have too much paperwork. 'Course if Ginny knows I'm not sleeping she'll kill me...Maybe I should get to bed."</p><p>Rose laughed and went off to her little cousin's room. </p><p>—-</p><p>It was the next morning at breakfast that Ron, Hermione, and Hugo stood in the Potter's kitchen.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>"Why the hell did you run off, Rose?!" Ron yelled.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Ginny held up a hand. "No more yelling!"</p><p>Ron looked to Harry. "Back me up Mate."</p><p>Harry sighed and shook his head. "Gin's right, Ron. You don't realize how all the yelling is affecting your kids. Look at Hugo, he won't look at you, Rose comes over here once a week at two in the morning, and neither of them want to talk to you because they're scared of hurting you."</p><p>"Harry!" Ron exclaimed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Hermione gazed at her children. "He's right."</p><p>Ron stared at her aghast.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Ginny cleared the table. "Kids, go upstairs."</p><p>"We aren't the best of parents but we're better than—" Ron was interrupted by Ginny's stern voice. "Don't you dare accuse us. This is on you."</p><p>Harry sighed. "You two need to get help with this. I love you both, but it's not healthy."</p><p>Hermione nodded. "You two are right. Come on, Ronald."</p><p>Ron grabbed a piece of bacon before he was dragged off.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>"Did they just—"</p><p>"Leave us with their kids? Yes."</p>
