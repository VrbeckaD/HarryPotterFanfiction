  <b>Prologue</b>
</p>
<p>Voldemort stepped into the nursery with a sneer on his face as he looked at the redhead that Severus loved so much</p>
<p>“You have a choice,” Voldemort hissed. “Step aside and live to fight another day or die.”</p>
<p>“I will never choose my life over my son’s,” Lily said as she stood protectively in front Harry.</p>
<p>“Very well,” Voldemort said and cast the killing curse. He stepped over her lifeless body and walked closer to the crib. He examined the little green eyed boy sitting in the crib with tears streaming down his face and his tight grip on his blanket.</p>
<p>Voldemort raised his wand, but instead of casting the killing curse that day, he simply levitated the boy into his arms and apparated out of the house. He appeared in his manor and stalked into his study.</p>
<p>He sat the boy gently on his desk as he called an houseelf. “Yes, master,” the houseelf said.</p>
<p>“Get Pettigrew,” Voldemort said. The houseelf nodded it’s head and popped out of the room. Voldemort sat in his chair and stared at the child who was staring back at him with wide eyes. After a few minutes, there was a knock on the door.</p>
<p>“Enter,” Voldemort commanded. The little child didn’t even jump at his voice, he just stared curiously at him. The tear stains on the child’s face beginning to fade slowly.</p>
<p>Pettigrew entered and bowed, drawing Voldemort’s attention away from the child. “Yes, my lord,” Pettigrew said, a tremor in his voice.</p>
<p>“Come here,” Voldemort said, pulling his wand out.</p>
<p>Pettigrew made his way towards Voldemort fearfully and kneeled beside his chair. Voldemort grabbed his left arm and pushed the sleeve up. He pointed his wand at the dark mark and summoned his Inner Circle. When he was done, he pushed Pettigrew away.</p>
<p>“Leave,” Voldemort said.</p>
<p>“Yes my lord,” Pettigrew said before fleeing the room. After the door shut after Pettigrew, the floo flared to life and seven people walked out of it.</p>
<p>Voldemort greeted each one. “Lucius. Severus. Bellatrix. Rodolphus. Rabastan. Barty. Fenrir.”</p>
<p>“Tom,” they all greeted back.</p>
<p>Lucius was the first one to notice the Potter child sitting on the desk. “Who is this?”</p>
<p>“Harry Potter,” Voldemort answered with a flick of his wand, making his snake glamors disappear.</p>
<p>“You didn’t kill him?” Severus asked as he examined the boy.</p>
<p>Voldemort shook his head. “I couldn’t do it.”</p>
<p>“What about his parents?” Bellatrix asked as she sat in an armchair.</p>
<p>“Dead,” Voldemort said nonchalantly.</p>
<p>“Are you okay with that Severus?” Barty asked with a lick of his lips.</p>
<p>"I didn't care about Potter at all and Lily.....I haven't loved her in a long time," Severus answered with a shrug.</p>
<p>"What do you plan on doing with the boy?" Fenrir asked, sniffing in the child's direction.</p>
<p>"Keeping him," Voldemort said as if it was obvious.</p>
<p>"You mean you're going to adopt the child?" Lucius asked with a raised eyebrow.</p>
<p>"Yes?" Voldemort stated back. "Will that be a problem?"</p>
<p>Lucius shook his head. "No, I just wish you the best of luck. Children at this age can be a handful."</p>
<p>"He is right you know," Rodolphus said.</p>
<p>"How is Bellamy doing?" Severus asked the LeStranges. Voldemort picked Harry up when he yawned and began to rock him as he listened to the conversations around him.</p>
<p>"Bellamy is doing good," Bellatrix said with a smile. "Although he is looking more like Rodolphus than me."</p>
<p>"He still has your crazy black hair Bella," Rodolphus said, kissing her on the forehead.</p>
<p>"What about you Lucius?" Voldemort asked. "How are things going with you and your son Draco?"</p>
<p>"Things are going good, although Narcissa is spoiling him completely," Lucius said with a sigh.</p>
<p>"Oh I can already see the tantrums when he gets older and can't get his way," Rabastan said with a chuckle.</p>
<p>The others laughed. "Oh geez I feel so old talking about this," Lucius said.</p>
<p>"Oh come on," Severus said. "You're only nineteen, we all are. We still got another fifty years before we can say that."</p>
<p>Voldemort snorted. "I don't know about that Severus. Some of us might end up with gray hair before the kids end up at Hogwarts."</p>
<p>Lucius face twisted in horror at thinking about getting gray hair. "Let's not talk about that shall we," Lucius said with a shake of his head.</p>
<p>The others chuckled. "Anyways, Severus, do you think you can make me a blood adoption potion?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, I can, but are you sure about this Tom?" Severus asked.</p>
<p>Voldemort looked down at the sleeping figure in his hands and nodded his head. "I am."</p>
