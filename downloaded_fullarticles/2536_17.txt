    <p>
  <span>It was unnerving, how quickly one's life could change. Half a year ago, Marlene had been far enough down the line of succession to be able to live her life more or less the way she wanted. Then the storm began. First her Uncle and Aunt, Their Majesties King Fleamont and Queen Euphemia were taken by the plague, leaving her cousin James and his new wife Lily to reign over the kingdom of Phoenixordo, earlier than anyone had prepared for. Then, out of nowhere her parents succumbed to the plague as well. Like the thunder after a strike of lightning, the newly anointed King James sent orders that Marlene was to live at the capital castle. As heiress presumptive to the throne, she needed protection. James’s letter, written to his cousin in his own hand stated, ‘I already have a Kingdom to manage, thus, I needn’t expend my energy fretting endlessly over my only family being kidnapped or murdered because she's too far away for me to keep an eye on her.’</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Marlene resented the comment, but she had to admit, she had a bit of a reputation. Her father and mother had doted on her endlessly. She was their only child, and she was as bright as she was beautiful. Marlene was exactly what fairytales wrote about when they described princesses. Her blonde hair fell in gentle waves. The spark behind the vibrant blue of her eyes hinted at her spirited nature. She moved with such a grace that she’d become something of a distraction for the stable hands and serving boys. Her father had insisted that she was the most beautiful princess in the kingdom from the time she was 10. Her mother had constantly fussed over her, her hair, her clothes, and her posture. They'd given her the absolute best tutors and she'd excelled in her studies and was as sharp as a whip. Marlene was everything the world had expected of her. But after the course of the last month, the Princess was also very much alone.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>At least with her cousin, King James, she might have some reprieve from feeling the constant weight of the loss of her parents. It hurt, and Marlene couldn't seem to move past the pain that ached in her chest. The thought that someone would use her as bargaining was troubling enough on its own, but added with everything else made her breathing labored. She welcomed the feeling of safety that came with living in the same fortress as his Majesty. It helped her to feel more secure than she had managed those few nights in her father's castle - her castle, she remembered - after James’ letter and guarded escort had arrived. She hadn't brought much, well, except her entire collection of dresses - which now included her mother's wardrobe - but those were essentials. At some point she'd be able to put on her colorful dresses again without feeling a sense of wrongness within herself. Someday she wouldn't see her mother in every damned mirror. Someday.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Marlene had hated carriage rides since she was a child. They gave her headaches and made her spine rattle. She would have preferred to ride the whole way there on the back of her chestnut mare, Truda, but James’ guards advised her that it was completely out of the question. She missed the feeling of being a few very important places further down the line of succession. As a girl, and even as a maiden princess to some extent, she’d been permitted to do as she pleased; now she felt like someone’s gold chess piece. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her ill temper was only increased by one of the courtiers of His Majesty's Court who decided his presence was necessary for her arrival. She stepped out of the carriage and tried to ignore the pounding in her very bones as the man stepped up to her. His features were not in and of themselves hideous. But it was somewhat disconcerting that it looked like he'd seen a portrait of her and then taken it upon him to recreate her image on himself. The way he styled and presented himself though, was astoundingly garish. He wore an all lavender outfit, which he strutted about in with such flagrant pride that the color must have been intentional choice, rather than some aging tailor’s error. It made him resemble a decorative baked sweet. His curly blond hair was a bit of puffed cream topping and his blue eyes were some sort of garnish. That sort of thing never even tastes any good, in Marlene’s opinion. The over all image was hideous, and it would have perhaps been something to laugh to herself about later, if it were not for the idiot believing that he was permitted to speak.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Your Grace,” the man bowed and Marlene's upbringing and training kicked in and she nodded politely to acknowledge him before continuing to follow the escort to His Majesty’s office.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I am Gilderoy Lockhart, Marquess of Occamy, heir to the Duchy of Oblivium, It’s an honor to make your acquaintance.” He followed after her and Marlene bit her tongue to keep from lashing out at him. He had no right to trouble her with his loathsome voice, let alone trail along after her like a spaniel. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“How lovely for you, my Lord.” She picked up the pace of her steps, in hopes of getting the point across. </span>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>“Not as lovely as you, dear Princess. You are everything that was rumored and more.”</span>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>“Yes, well,” Marlene focused on being a princess and controlling her tongue, “kind of you to listen to Court gossip about me and all but I have an appointment with his Majesty.” </span>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>“By all means, but do allow me the honor of escorting you to the door.” He moved to take her arm but she sidestepped him.</span>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>Marlene pursed her lips and let out a slow and even breath to steady her will. She knew there was no polite way to get rid of this clown, so she’d need to endure him for another hundred paces or so. She would just have to survive the pain of swallowing her more brazen insults. </span>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>“If you must.” She chose a lofty tone to try and push the issue that she was </span>
  <em>
    <span>anything</span>
  </em>
  <span> but interested in his company.</span>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>“I must. And I must confess that I have been longing to meet you since I saw your portrait. Never in my life have I seen a noble lady who looked quite so like myself. If we were to wed, our heirs would be so beautifully golden that the sun itself would look dull by comparison.” </span>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>Was this dunce truly out of his mind? Marlene smiled as her destination came into sight. “Right well… Best not give the sun any cause for anger. Good day, Lord Gilderoy.” With that, she let the door slam in Lockhart's face, taking pleasure in the moment of silence before she heard James chuckle.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Little Marly is still slamming doors I see. Welcome to your new home, Cousin.” He stood and embraced her and Marlene took a moment to just be glad to be with family again, the last few months had been incredibly lonely. She and James had been great friends as young children, but it became dangerous to travel about a year before James started as a squire, Marlene’s parents put her visits to a halt. They kept her at home to protect her, and consequently the cousin pair drifted apart. She took note of the small changes in what was Uncle Monty’s office while she was a child, with her only cousin's arms around her shoulders. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Her only family now</span>
  </em>
  <span>, she reminded herself. Whatever differences there were, the warm welcome of her cousin was a relief. She could finally start to fill in some of the emptiness that dwelt within her since they'd buried her parents.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I only slam doors when someone has made themselves a pest.” She stepped out from his embrace and smirked up at him. He had gotten impossibly taller in the years she hadn't seen him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Who could possibly be pestering you?” James laughed and pulled a soft chair out for her. Marlene fell into it gladly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Some Lord Lockhart seems to be under the impression that I'd be his perfect bride,” Marlene drawled as James handed her a drink. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, that unfortunately,” James took a seat across from her and threw his feet onto the desk, “will be a problem in the foreseeable future. You’re my heiress presumptive. Even imbeciles like Lockhart know that marrying you is the best chance any other family has to ending up on the throne.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“James, the absolute last thing I want is to end up on the throne. So would you mind doing your </span>
  <em>
    <span>heiress presumptive </span>
  </em>
  <span>a favor? Presume to go get an heir upon your wife! I’d be forever in your debt if you’d bestow upon me a little nephew or niece to dote on... and push all this ridiculous responsibility on to. Immediately would be preferable, but I’ll be kind and wait 9 moons.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Marlene nearly jumped when a woman with beautiful red hair and piercing green eyes walked in laughing, accompanied by a tall man with jet black hair and pale skin. He could easily be the best looking man she'd ever seen, but Marlene reminded herself that after dealing with Lord Lockhart for five minutes she may very well have found something deeply appealing in anyone who was not him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, my love,” James stood and the tall man smirked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Really your Majesty, not in front of the Queen! You’ll make her jealous.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Marlene laughed, this man was dry, but there was something about the way he held himself that made Marlene feel like he was carrying a weight far greater than his humor could maintain.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>James rolled his eyes and pulled the woman into his arms. “Lily this is the Princess Marlene, my cousin, and as she reminded me, the next in line until we produce an heir. She seems to think we ought to be putting more effort into that endeavor.” He nuzzled her neck and Queen Lily laughed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Marlene curtsied low, with practiced elegance, “Your Majesty, it's so wonderful to meet you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lily bowed her head, “Your Grace, I hope you'll find our castle to be a home to you now.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Marlene chuckled, “Is that enough formality?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Heavens, yes!” Lily laughed and embraced Marlene. “I've heard so much about you from James and I've been so excited to get to meet you! He tells me you're quite the scholar. None of the Ladies here were properly educated and if I have to spend one more afternoon discussing the most popular color for fabrics this season, I'm going to scream.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well, just respond to every comment on fabric colors with something philosophical or ask them about the fabric dye that most represents their mortal soul.” Marlene grinned wickedly and Lily laughed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I'm going to abscond with her,” she turned to James.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah good,” the tall man drawled, “now my dearest King and I can profess our undying love and escape away unhindered.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lily rolled her eyes, “Marlene this is Sir Sirius. He's our cousin on his Majesty’s mother's side, and his dearest friend. He’s let his reputation as the bravest knight in the kingdom go straight to his head. He thinks he can command an army </span>
  <em>
    <span>and</span>
  </em>
  <span> the heart of my own loving husband… the nerve” Lily smiled at her jest.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“One simply does one's best. Your Grace,” he nodded to her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Marlene nodded politely and noted that he didn't immediately propose marriage, or really bother with her at all. That was what she wanted with these new courtiers, to be left alone.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I regret that we must bid you farewell until dinner, dear Ladies.” James kissed Lily's hand and stared at her for a moment like a lovesick puppy before sighing and pulling away. “Sir Sirius and I have some work to hammer out.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lily linked her arm with Marlene's and pulled her through a different door that thankfully didn't have Lord Gilderoy Lockhart standing on the other side.</span>
