    <p>It had been a normal dinner in Hogwarts' Great Hall. And it was. For that year. Like every year since Harry James Potter, the boy who lived, attended the magical school of Britain there was a certain feel of doom in the air. Not everyone felt at ease and thought that they would survive this year without any incidents or injuries. Especially since it was known that the Dark Lord was back. That he had a real human body, one made of blood and flesh. He was once again a breathing being whose goal was it to eliminate Harry Potter, everyone who stood in his way and rule over a pureblooded magical world. In his world there were no muggles and therefore no muggleborn wizards and no halfblood. Those were the scum of earth and had no right to be in his presence nor to be alive and breathe even one gasp of air. And eventhough Voldemort was a real threat to Harry Potter and all his friends and allies, he concerned himself with another issue, with another person. Someone who he and every other person who attended Hogwarts thought of as an enemy. Someone that was as old as him and started in Hogwarts the same year as him. The heir of the Malfoy family, a blond Slytherin, the teenaged boy called Draco Malfoy. </p><p>Since the beginning of the year, Harry had become somewhat obsessed of his fellow classmate. He did not behave like any other year. And that meant only one thing for Harry Potter: Something was up with him! Or rather he was up to something. Every cell in Potter's body screamed to him that he better do something before the Slytherin does something that might hurt him or his friends. His family was after all a known ally of the Dark Lord and therefore dangerous. His family was into the dark arts, a magic that was not only dangerous and violent but also deadly. Especially towards non-pureblooded wizards. Harry had no such luxus that he could ignore his senses that told him that he better take care of this issue. Hardly were his senses ever wrong. And one misstep might cost someone's life. Someone who might be close and dear to Harry. And eventhough his friends thought him insane, mad or obsessive, he would always trust in his gut. No matter what.</p><p>„I am sure of it. Malfoy is up to something!” Harry was sure of it. There was no doubt in the matter.</p><p><br/> “Bloody hell, Harry! Can you just once, for the love of Merlin, talk about something else while we are eating? Or like ever talk about something else than bloody Malfoy? It's not like we see the ferret face every day in classes and now you even talk every time about him when we eat? I have enough! I am not like you, not my whole life resolves around Malfoy or what he's up to!"</p><p>Stunned, Harry looked away from his friends to his plate that was hardly filled with food. He had been too concerned with the blond Slytherin to even think about eating. In retaliation, Harry only mumbled something incoherent. After Having stated his opinion, Ron resumed eating. Or more likely shoveling excessive amounts of food into his mouth.</p><p>Conversation at the Gryffindor table had halted shortly. Everyone was aware that Harry was starting to obsess about a certain Slytherin. He nearly only talk about Malfoy and that he might be up to something nefarious. The Gryffindors had decided to ignore his rambling. Ever since Voldemort had come back and Diggory died, he was not the same person. Something that not anybody understood eventhough the Gryffindor had witnessed a death with his own eyes, just mere metres in front of him. Harry was more closed off and easily angered. They were all aware that such happenings were not easily worked through and Voldemort was a danger to all but it is not like they, simply average students, could really do anything against someone like the Dark Lord. It is better to leave this matter to the adults and the order. They were all not powerful enough to really help them. They were only just learning how to fight. Some had decided to join Dumbledore's army but that was mostly because they wanted to be able to defend themselves and because they believed in Potter. He had survived every action that Voldemort had planned against him. He had defeated him as a baby and survived the encouter at the final task in the Triwizard Tournament.</p><p>But still no one really believed that Malfoy was up to something really evil. Even his close friends thought that he was just talking nonsense. Most likely did he try to relieve his stress  by obsessing over Malfoy. Malfoy might be a bully but nothing more severe. He seemed more like a cowards and not some mastermind or spineless underling that would follow every task given to him. Especially since his father was in Azkaban and therefore rather powerless. Nearly all students of Hogwarts thought that he was rather harmless. All bark but no bite.</p><p>Since Ron's voice had gotten rather loud, the Gryffindors had stopped their conversation and looked towards the Golden Trio. It seemed like a typical quarel between friends, so the rest of the Gryffindor table started resuming theirs talks with each other and also continued eating their breakfast. Ginny shortly looked towards her brother and his friend  but did not say anything to or about them. She started talking to Dean. She sometimes felt like an outsider with these three friends. They were just so close to each other and talk about things that she had no clue about it. And it rather annoyed them to explain everything to her so that she too could understand what was going on. She felt rather useless and decided to distance herself a bit for some time. Establish her own school life, with her own friends and problems. Just something normal and every normal student would do. Maybe she did not suit the life of one Harry Potter and his gang. She scoffed.</p><p>Hermione just shook her head while trying to secretly get a peek of the Slytherin table and a certain blond wizard. To her surprise he was seated with his back to the Gryffindor table. This was a rather unusual occurrence. Normally, he would not waste any opportunity to sneer at them or to try to provoke them. Maybe something was really up with Malfoy. In the last few weeks, it had seemed like he had lost some weight. Something hard to spot since their robes rather hide the bodies from everyone's eyes. In general, he did not behave like he normally did, especially with them, Non-Slytherins. He hardly bullied them or engaged in any kind of conflict. The more Hermione thought about it the more suspicious she got with his behaviour herself. There was no way that he might be too concerned with his grades. They had gotten worse since the beginning of the year, but he seemed not to really care about them. Every time Hermione was in the library, which was often, he was never there. And every time Harry looked at the Marauder's map, he was definitely not his room in the Slytherin dorms. Hermione sighed. It seemed like this school year, like every other one, won't be easy and normal. Was it too much to ask for a normal school year? All because a homicidal dark wizard was on the loose and trying to kill all non-pureblood wizards and anyone who was only a tad bit muggle-friendly. Well, at least she could never say that her life was boring. Hermione sighed again and massaged her temples. She was starting to get a headache.</p><p>Just then the blond wizard stood up and exited the Great Hall rather quickly. Without any of his usual followers. Strange.<br/> As soon as Harry observed this, he jumped up. “I’m gonna follow him!”<br/> “Harry!”, Hermione hissed.<br/> But it was no use in trying to stop him. He was already on his way to follow him out of the Great Hall.<br/> “Ron, let’s get up and follow Harry. We can’t afford to have these two beat each other up and lose any House points. Or get Harry in detention, it's not like he has anything else to do.”<br/> “Why not? Just let him beat the ferret up.”<br/> “Ron! Don’t you think Harry is in enough trouble as it is? He does not need to add any more detention or more antagonizing Malfoy. Just one school year without any trouble. Is that too much to ask for?”<br/> “Fine, fine. We are tallking about Harry Potter. There is no way that any year would be normal. That ain't bloody possible. But whatever. I’m going, I’m going. Bloody hell.”</p><p>The two Gryffindor left the Great Hall, without any other Gryffindor since they were busy eating and did not really wanted to put up with Harry and his new-found obsession. Not even Ginny who was now busy flirting with Dean. Hermione was not sure if Ginny was using this relationship to make Harry jealous or if she really liked Dean. But if it was the latter then it had not shown much effect. Harry was way too busy being obsessed with Malfoy and chasing him around. As they walked a few steps they saw Harry leaning, impatiently, on a pillar.</p><p>“There you are! Hurry up! He’s waiting in Myrtle’s bathroom. I think something serious is happening.”<br/> “Do you think the others bought that? It wasn’t too much?”, Ron asked while hurrying.<br/> “No one seemed suspicious or really bothered in Gryffindor. And I think Malfoy is not on good terms with the rest of Slytherin, they seemed not to really care that he hardly ate something and left so early. Not even Goyle or Crabbe”, Hermione stated.<br/> Just a few minutes later the Golden Trio arrived in Myrtle’s bathroom, only to see Malfoy pacing around in the bathroom. No Myrtle in sight.<br/> “Oh look, who’s here? The scarhead, blood traitor and the know-it-all!”, Malfoy sneered.</p>
