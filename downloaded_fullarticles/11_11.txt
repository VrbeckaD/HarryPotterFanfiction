    <p>CHAPTER ONE</p><p>August 2nd, 1995</p><p>All was right in the Wizarding World, at least if Cornelius Fudge was asked. And as the Minister of Magic, he often was. He was sitting in his office, enjoying his night time tea. Much of the walls were covered in magazine cutting of articled concerning the Ministry's affairs. His desk was currently littered with scrolls, covering the better part of the space.</p><p>He had wished to go home on time today, but had been caught up with his duties. It was partly because Dumbledore would not stop sending him letters and demanding he take action against You-Know-Who. Somehow, Dumbledore had been charming the letters to be quite persistent until they were read, so there was no ignoring them. Next, he'd be sending him, the Minister, Howlers. Even more irritating were the worried letters from people who were buying the lie. Much of his time was spent delegating the inquiries to his employees.</p><p>A haggard looking witch, his assistant of four years, strode into his office without knocking, carrying several scrolls of parchment in her hands.</p><p>"I just received word from Mafalda. The Potter kid used the Patronus Charm in Little Whinging, in front of his Muggle cousin. Your memo informed the whole Ministry to bring matters concerning Potter straight to you."</p><p>It took a moment for Fudge to comprehend what he'd just been told. Slowly, a smile spread across his face, and his stale tea started to taste much better than it had moments before. "Excellent. Yes, Mafalda was right to send word. Would you please send word back to her, Amanda? I'd like to see her right away."<br/>
Amanda nodded and was quickly on her way.</p><p>Fudge was not sure whether he was going to keep Amanda. She had been a loyal assistant, but who had her loyalties at the moment, he wasn't sure. After all, she had been recommended by Albus Dumbledore many years ago. He certainly didn't need anyone on the inside aiding the Headmaster.</p><p>There had been a time when he had been keen on receiving advice from Dumbledore, often writing to him several times a day. He had been inexperienced then, unseasoned and naive, it was no wonder he had sought the guidance of the legendary Albus Dumbledore. It was unfortunate that the old man had ultimately lost his mind. He could kiss his career goodbye if he spared even a second to consider the man's blabberings. But that was, possibly, Dumbledore's intention.</p><p>Fudge tried to gather the scrolls scattered on his desk into a more manageable pile as he waited eagerly for Mafalda. Usually, he didn't bother with underage use of magic but he had requested to be informed of all matters concerning the Potter boy.</p><p>How Potter had come mixed up in all this, Fudge didn't know... Many had guessed that perhaps fame had gotten to his head. He had seemed so charming and down to earth the first time Fudge had seen him, but people could change. The signs had been there for him to see, earlier, but he supposed he had been too kind to him them. The nonsense about Black being innocent and some rat being responsible... He hadn't gotten his face in the Daily Prophet because of that lie, he had made sure of that! Now, his tales about the return of the Dark Lord would certainly earn him a reputation as the biggest liar in the Wizarding World. The trash campaign against him and Dumbledore was sure to assure the doubters of the fact.</p><p>Fudge would still have liked to know what had happened in the maze and how Potter had managed to turn the trophy into a Portkey! He didn't think Potter had killed Cedric Diggory, that far Fudge didn't believe the boy had gone, but something fishy was going on there.</p><p>At the knock on his door, he smiled. "Come on in, Mafalda."</p><p>Oh, was the boy in trouble now!</p><p>* * *<br/>
August 6th, 1995</p><p>Never did he feel as right as home as he did when on a broom. He had never flown in the open sky before, watching the clouds go by, the stars in the night as well as his Advance Guard, smoothly changing places around him, the switches timed like a clock.</p><p>They sped through the air, the rush of wind blowing Harry's troubles and worries away, making him forget about the hearing, about the Dementors and the rest of the horrible summer, even of the reason he had to be escorted by Aurors to safety in the first place.</p><p>He wanted to do a few swirls in the air, but didn't think Moody would appreciate it; who knew if he'd make him ride on the back of someone else's broom if he didn't behave. He settled for smiling happily to himself, pondering whether the Dursleys had arrived home yet. His uncle's face, distorted with anger was a much funnier thought when he wasn't there to be on the receiving end of his rage. The thought made him laugh out loud, but the sound was drowned by the whoosh of the wind in their ears.</p><p>Like predators surrounding their prey, one by one the guard circled Harry. Kingsley Shacklebolt was on his right, next it was Emmeline Vance, now Sturgis Podmore... Everyone kept their wands at the ready, turning their heads in every direction, continuously scanning the sky for unwanted company.</p><p>They hadn't been flying for too long, when the chill of the night started to seep through his clothes, gluing his hands to the broom more tightly... Harry started daydreaming about Mrs Weasley's cooking. With luck, there'd be warm food waiting for him wherever they were going. He wouldn't say no to hot soup.</p><p>Harry had lost track of time, Moody shouting directions at timely intervals to dodge Muggle towns and motor ways, when something made Harry look at his left. He didn't see anything, but his instincts were often right. Someone was there.</p><p>He was just about to shout out to the others, to look out, when he felt a spell hit him. Momentarily, he expected to fall from his broom or something otherwise bad to happen, but he only felt an odd sensation on his skin. When he had been Disillusioned, it had felt like an egg breaking on his head and trickling down his body, but removing the charm had the opposite effect. It gave the impression of the trickles travelling up his body back into the wand that had cast the magic, making Harry shiver.</p><p>He spared a peek at his body. He wasn't a human chameleon anymore; he was just as visible in the night as the rest of the group.</p><p>Noticing this, Harry heard Moody swear under his breath as he turned around on his broom and turning his head upwards, trying to see their attackers and casting jinxes into their supposed location. Soon enough, three figures covered by hoods and masks became visible in the night.</p><p>"Death Eaters!" Moody shouted as a warning to the others. "Keep flying, Harry, we'll lose them! And keep your head down!"</p><p>As Moody said this, the air was suddenly full of different shades of light, flying in all directions between the attackers and the guard. Harry would have been impressed at the exceptional wand work and the quickness of their counter-blows if the situation hadn't been as dire and he wasn't terrified out of his skull.</p><p>A flash of red light and Sturgis Podmore was falling off his broom towards the ground with horrifying speed, aimed for a sure death coming from this aimed a spell at his falling body with excellent accuracy, making it descend much more slowly, falling through the air like a feather would.</p><p>"Keep going!" Kingsley yelled from above Harry.</p><p>No one paid the body any mind after that. Harry hoped Sturgis landed somewhere safe, and not in a lake or in the middle of a road.</p><p>The hooded people weren't aiming at Harry, but trying to fly between him and his guards, shooting them with curses and driving them farther away. They were trying to separate him from the rest of the group to make him easier to snatch.</p><p>Little by little, they were succeeding. Hestia Jones, currently on his right side, was forced to drift away to avoid being knocked off her broom, leaving that side unguarded. Harry tried to circle around the Death Eaters, but it was for naught as more and more attackers appeared from nowhere.</p><p>Harry wondered wildly if Voldemort had had his followers attend compulsory flying lessons to enter his services.</p><p>Remus Lupin showed up from somewhere, shooting a jinx at the man or woman closest to Harry, but was blocked. The counter-strike almost hit the professor, but the men seemed to be quite equal in skill, the fight going nowhere.</p><p>At last, a curse with an odd incantation managed to get through Remus'Â defences, making him lose altitude and disappear out of sight. Horrified, Harry turned to see where his old professor had disappeared to, but to his relief he saw Remus conscious and able to regain height before he could hit the the ground.</p><p>Curses with bright green light were freely flying in the air now. Harry didn't think anyone on their side had been killed yet, but it was only a matter of time. In the worst case scenario, the guard would be killed off one by one, leaving him alone with the Death Eaters. Moody had mentioned a back up crew that would take their place in case they were all taken out, but he was not going to wait for them. The blood of Cedric Diggory was already on his hands, he couldn't handle anyone else's. If Remus were to die, Sirius would have lost all of his best friends along with his godson -</p><p>Trying not to stop and think about the implications of what this would mean for his own fate, he crouched down over his broom and prepared for take off.</p><p>"Harry, no!" bellowed a distressed sounding Tonks from somewhere, but Harry didn't even have time to comprehend from what direction it was coming from. He ignored her and swerved to the left, weaving his way between the Death Eaters, away from the circle and took off into a dive, wanting to get as far away from the fight as possible. Combined with the power of his broom and his slight frame that allowed him to speed smoothly through the air, he was able to shake off his pursuers as they were far too heavily-built to keep up with him.</p><p>For a while, he could see no one else in the heights with him and he had a moment to think he was safe â but that one second of relaxing and slowing down cost him. A Death Eater Harry didn't remember seeing before, had managed to circle in front of him and cut off his escape. He was forced to stop so abrutly he almost flew off his broom from the front.</p><p>He was lean and small, his posture giving away a history of flying experience. It was no wonder he was the one that had been able to catch up to Harry. The man's wand was pointing directly at his heart.</p><p>"You're surrounded, boy! There's no escaping now", bellowed a voice from behind him and with a start Harry realized it was right. Having caught up with him, several figures were circling him in the air, his guard nowhere to be seen. "Fly down!"</p><p>Harry saw no other choice as he couldn't stay on his broom for the rest of eternity. He didn't think they'd knock him off his broom as he figured Voldemort wanted to kill him himself and the drop of several hundred feet would easily kill him... He considered this option fleetingly, but decided against it as it was practically suicide.</p><p>With his heart somewhere around his throat, he started to aim his Firebolt towards the ground, intending to land near the edge of a thick forest. He accelarated into a quick dive, faintly hoping to lose them again. Maybe there was a small change to run by foot into the woods and lose them, he could hide until Remus and the rest would find him there. Once on the ground, he threw the Firebolt onto the ground, knowing it was no use to try to fly it amongst the trees. He attempted to break into a run, but soon felt a cold hand land on his shoulder.</p><p>"Master's going to be pleased to see you", rasped the man, and Harry felt his insides drop into something ice-cold. It was Nott. He had relived the night in his dreams enough times to know everyone who had been there to witness the rebirth of Lord Voldemort, even if he'd only heard the man speak once.<br/>
Desperately, Harry tried to raise his wand to curse him off, but Nott noticed, stopping his efforts by pressing the tip of his own wand against his throat. The man was close enough for Harry to smell the heavy stench of sweat coming from him.</p><p>"Don't bother, boy", he growled. "Drop it."</p><p>More Death Eaters dropped from their brooms, five in total, circling Harry and Nott. Harry wasn't sure if there'd been more people in pursuit in the beginning or not. Not seeing any way around it he obeyed, his wand slipping out of his grasp and falling into the moist grass.<br/>
Harry recognized several of the men around him, Lucius Malfoy's cold and hard eyes staring straight at him. He tried to appear brave, keeping his head high and staring back. Noticing this, Malfoy's lips twisted into a cruel smile.</p><p>Harry couldn't believe how his biggest worry only a short week ago, had been boredom and being left out in the dark. He'd even take on a few dementors gladly, those he could handle. He knew the game had been lost; he was going back to Voldemort and there was no way out this time.</p><p>Lucius crouched down at Harry's feet to retrieve the wand. He considered kicking his side, just for the fun of it, but Lucius stood up soon, running his fingers on the wand and examining it carefully. Harry felt sick.</p><p>"The Order clearly isn't up to their task anymore. Giving you up this easily. They should have known there'd always be someone lurking around that house of yours", Lucius mused, still handling the wand.</p><p>"They weren't prepared, that's for sure", Nott agreed, his grip on Harry painfully tight.</p><p>One of the hooded Death Eaters moved around, restless. "Why are we standing around jacking? Let's get going. Master won't like it if Potter gets injured in another fight, the Order folk will find us eventually. "</p><p>Lucius nodded, shoving Harry's wand into his robes, keeping his own at the ready. "Nott, you've got Potter? You can go first, wait for us in the yard. "</p><p>Nott nodded. "Hold onto my arm", he said to Harry who saw no reason to resist at this point. They could just as easily knock him out and transport him that way. He held on to Nott's arm, feeling like a little kid being escorted home by a police man. Suddenly, he realized he'd have his first experience Apparating with a Death Eater.</p><p>END OF CHAPTER ONE</p>
