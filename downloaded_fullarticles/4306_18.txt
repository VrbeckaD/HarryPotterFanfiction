          <div class="userstuff"><p>Harry knocked the shot of firewhisky back. He didn't know why he was at the bar, watching the blond from across the room. Pining for someone who didn't even know he existed was sad. Harry didn't know what he was doing.<br/> <br/>So Harry ordered another firewhisky...<br/> <br/>Maybe if he drunk enough, it would stop hurting so much.<br/> <br/>He ordered another drink.<br/> <br/>Green eyes looked up to see grey one's staring at him intently.<br/> <br/>Harry's mouth went dry, so he quickly took another drink. He would need all the courage he could get if he were to survive Draco approaching him.</p></div>
