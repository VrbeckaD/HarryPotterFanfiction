    <p><br/> They sit around the dining table at the Potters one evening when James’ mum has gone to have tea at a neighbours and Mr Potter lets them all have a cup of beer each. They sit with their elbows on the table, clutching their mugs and laughing raucously at every anecdote and dad-joke that Mr Potter offers them.<br/><br/> Remus feels like a child at heel; looks around at the others and sees his own beaming adoration of Mr Potter reflected back in the faces of the others and it makes him feel overwhelmingly nostalgic for this moment even as its being made.<br/><br/> He frowns into his cup and Mr Potter catches him, reaches over and pours him another nip with a wink.<br/><br/> It’s the summer holiday just after their fifth year and James has invited them all to his house for a week. The weather has finally broken, and the intense stickiness of the previous two weeks has culminated in a colossal downpour with rolling thunder overhead and sharp cracks of lightning viewed best from the gardener’s shed at the bottom of the back garden.<br/><br/> In truth the best view is from the roof of the house, although this is only accessible via flying up on a broom, which Mrs Potter banned resolutely after witnessing two roof tiles go hurtling past her bathroom window to shatter on the patio and embed themselves in the lawn.<br/><br/> They are subsequently roped into helping with chores. It’s manual labour in the form of shifting items out of the ornate sideboard cupboards in the parlour so that Mrs Potter can donate the “tat and nik-naks clogging it up” to charity.<br/><br/> The tat she refers to turns out to be beautifully crafted ceramic ornaments and china sets and old wedding gifts - several of which have baffled Remus to the point of thinking that perhaps you only come to realise the use for them once you’re married.<br/><br/> Mrs Potter says she doesn’t trust the boys to handle the likes of it all with magic, so they form a chain and pass gift boxes and pieces of crockery and glass down their line by hand so that Peter and James can dust and rewrap them in newspaper on the carpet.<br/><br/> “I remember this one,” Mr Potter says about the next item that Sirius pulls from the cupboard, about an hour and a half into their work.<br/><br/> Sirius stands up with it in his hands and Mr Potter’s shoulder is obstructing his view slightly, but Remus can sort of see him going through the motion of lifting a lid to check the contents inside.<br/><br/> “Ugly old thing, I always thought. Needed some pattern work on it,” Mr Potter adds plainly and gives a shrug as he takes it from Sirius and turns to firmly press it into Remus’ waiting palms.<br/><br/> In hindsight, Remus knows he should have been expecting something like it to be unearthed, and taken more care to avoid exactly this, but as it goes, he gets so caught up in the camaraderie of the task that he obliviously stands there and lets Mr Potter hand him an antique silver serving dish.<br/><br/> His first thought when he drops it is hoping it isn’t a priceless family heirloom - nor an expensive antique, for that matter - and he’s struck with the fear that he’s about to be shouted at by Mr Potter, or looked upon with grave disappointment, which is much more keeping with his style.<br/><br/> It hits the carpet between them with a hideously loud crash and everybody starts and turns to see Remus clutch his hands to his chest, before yelping a desperate “sorry”, and inexplicably bending over to try to pick it up.<br/><br/> “Wait.” Mr Potter’s hand shoots out in warning and Remus seems to come to his senses and freezes.<br/><br/> “Shit!” Sirius says, as he leans past Mr Potter to see the red flesh of Remus’ palms and the look of startled horror on his face. “It’s burned him!”<br/><br/> Mr Potter then tells the others not to touch the bowl sitting on its side on the ground and takes Remus’ wrists in his hands and gently guides Remus out of the parlour.<br/><br/> They walk down the long, quiet hall and Remus glances back over his shoulder to see if Sirius, at least, will follow him out, but nobody does. There’s something a little strange about being alone with the parent of a friend, Remus thinks, as though they speak different languages and their translator has gone missing.<br/><br/> He hisses through his teeth as Mr Potter puts his hands under a cold running tap and, still tutting under his breath, begins to get a very worn looking book down from a shelf in the kitchen. He flips to a page with a green tab sticking out of the top and hums in a way that lets Remus know he’s found what he was looking for.<br/><br/> “Okay, my boy, give them here.”<br/><br/> Remus turns the tap off with his elbow and holds his hands out to Mr Potter who stands to survey the damage with his spectacles perched strategically on the end of his nose and his hands on his hips.<br/><br/> They both peer down at the sore, blistered skin, and Remus breathes past the urge to cry a little at the shock of it.<br/><br/> “Got a little aversion to pure silver, have you, son?” Mr Potter asks gently, his eyes now focused on the book in his hand.<br/><br/> Remus doesn’t know what to say to this; frightened of giving something away; frightened of Mr Potter <em> knowing </em> and deciding he shouldn’t be in his house, or hanging around with his son, or even in his son’s school. He gives a small shrug in response and Mr Potter raises his head to give Remus a soft smile.<br/><br/> “Nothing to worry about. Hardly anything much is made of silver these days. I’ll get Euphemia to use the normal dinner set for our evening meals and there’ll be nothing more to worry over, how about that?”<br/><br/> He hovers the tip of his wand over Remus’ left palm and begins uttering some healing charms that instantly soothe the raw skin. It takes no longer than ten minutes for him to do both hands and Mr Potter says it’s because he barely held the bowl for a second or two.<br/><br/> “Like it never happened, eh?” Mr Potter beams, after scrubbing a hand over the skin of Remus’ hands to check it doesn’t still hurt anywhere.<br/><br/> Remus nods, and finds he’s almost closer to tears than he was after being burned.<br/><br/> Mr Potter doesn’t ask Remus anything else about it, and he doesn’t mention the bowl at all - just gives Remus a look that says any secrets are safe with him, and that they’re okay, then claps Remus on the shoulder and turns to replace the book on the shelf.<br/><br/> “Go on back now, lad,” he tells Remus over his shoulder, who utters a ‘thank you’ and scurries from the room.</p><p> </p>
