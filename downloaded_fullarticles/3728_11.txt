    <p>A young woman of about twenty sat propped up on her bed re-reading Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince for what seemed to be the tenth time. She brushed her curly platinum blonde hair out from her face repeatedly to no avail. Finishing the last pages of the book the sighed contentedly closing the novel and placing it by her bedside and stretching out her stiff back before walking over to her computer. Between working full-time and college half-time she still managed to somehow make time to read Pottermore articles and browse the Harry Potter wiki for any and all information about the wizarding world.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> A large binder was full from everything that she had learned, from important dates in wizarding history to backstories on all of the notable characters. The almost three-inch-thick binder was chocked full of wisdom, her name Fate Grim written in sharpie on the side. Unfortunately, it would only ever be used for fanfiction or to create her daydreams. Whenever something new was added to her knowledge she would instantly write it down to use later. She had never been to England as she currently lived in the states but she desperately wanted to go and see the sights that inspired the books. Of course, to do that money would be needed, which she had none to spare on such things.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Spending some time catching up on some fanfiction she had been invested in she glanced at the time and sighed, realizing it was already 3 A.M. Lately it was becoming harder to separate herself from reality and her imaginations. Like any obsessed fangirl she wished she could have gotten her letter from Hogwarts, walked its halls, experienced buying her wand and studying magic into the late night. Instead she was stuck with the monotony of normal college work and normal boring jobs. She had no living family and hardly any friends to spend her time with, resulting in her fascination with books. They were her distraction from her dark thoughts that twisted her reasoning every so often. As far as relationships went there were no special people in her life. Unlike in her books it was much harder to get to the essence of a person. It was easy however to misunderstand someone and their intentions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Realizing she was going down a dark mental path she pulled up youtube and put some music on to fall asleep to knowing that work would come far too soon for her liking. Grabbing the binder she clutched it to her chest as she made herself comfortable in bed and closed her eyes. While sleep had a hard time finding her something else did not. Fate had a strange feeling that seemed to stem from her very soul. Her entire body started tingling with a warm sensation causing her to open her eyes. What she saw stunned her for an orb no bigger than a fist was floating beside her emitting a soft yellow glow.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For a moment she thought that she was seeing things and that this surely couldn’t be real. Her gut feeling was telling her differently. Never before had it been wrong; she would go so far as to say she had the intuition of a feral cat, able to sense danger and abnormalities. What she felt from this orb made her feel calm, something she hadn’t felt in years. Slowly and cautiously she extended her hand in front of her to grasp the ball of light, binder still in one hand. The moment her fingers touched the mysterious object there was a flash of light and Fate disappeared along with it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The world was dark, filled only with a constant buzzing noise. Fate awoke in this space greeted by the sight of the orb in front of her. It slowly transformed before her eyes into the image of a celestial woman, her aura oozing power. Long brown hair fell around her shoulders in droves and she looked as beautiful as an elf from lord of the rings. Fate for her part remained completely calm. This was either a weird dream, she had somehow gotten ahold of the neighbors “special brownies” without her knowing, or the being in front of her was completely unfathomable to her. If it was the last and she wanted her dead she couldn’t stop it so why bother?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Greetings.” The orb, no woman standing in front of Fate said with a small smile, seeming to read her mind. “I am not here to hurt you. In fact I might just save you.”</p>
<p><br/> Fate raised an eyebrow as if to urge the woman to carry on. She couldn’t seem to find her voice, maybe she was in shock after all?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“If your life carries on like this you will continue until a bout of depression takes you. From there you will simply be another soul to reach the underworld from this strand of reality. I can offer you a way out. Of course, I won’t be doing this for free. When your life in whatever reality you choose is over, you must serve me for the amount of time that you live your new life.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>These conditions sounded very fair and quite frankly she probably wouldn’t mind doing whatever the person asked of her if this turned out to be true. Without even bothering to ask what the terms were Fate agreed instantly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I want to go to the world of Harry Potter and become a witch!” Fate said with excitement any nervousness leaving. This would obviously be the world she would choose, after all she knew the most about it. The goddess nodded her head and a book and pen appeared in her hands.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“What’s a new life without paperwork? Fill out this form and I’ll be ready to send you off!” She said cheerily.</p>
<p>
  <em>To whom it may concern,</em>

<p>Fate signed her full name on the line after reading the terms finding they weren’t nearly as bad as she was expecting. Death clapped her hands and the contract disappeared and with a smile on her face pointed her finger at Fate’s forehead. Fate’s world turned black, the only thing she could still feel was her binder, still held firmly in her hand.</p>
