          <div class="userstuff"><p>It's the 31st of July 1981, Harry Potter's first birthday and his parents have arranged a party for him.</p><p>James smiled. "Look at him, Lil. He's clearly enjoying his present from his godfather Padfoot anyway."</p><p>Lily beamed, "Yeah, godfather Padfoot. That never gets old, I can't believe we chose him over Moony."</p><p>James smirked. "Moony is too serious, no pun intended."</p><p>Remus shouted from a corner nearby, "Hey! I heard that!"</p><p>Lily chuckled. "That's the whole point, stupid."</p><p>Remus replied, "I gave Harry an educational first birthday present, what's wrong with that?"</p><p>James assured him, "Absolutely nothing, Moony."</p><p>Remus disappeared back into a crowd of party goers.</p><p>Lily grinned. "That was a close one, Prongs."</p><p>James pondered, "I wonder where Padfoot is?"</p><p>As if he heard him, Sirius appeared beside the happy couple and asked, "Who said my name?"</p><p>Lily told him, "Prongs."</p><p>Sirius inquired, "What do you need, Prongs?"</p><p>James explained, "I was just expressing my gratitude towards the present you gave Harry."</p><p>Sirius sat down on a chair beside James and said, "You're very welcome my dear Prongs and Lily."</p><p>Lily frowned. "It's not fair that you four have cool nicknames and I'm just Lily."</p><p>James answered, "You're not just Lily to me, Lil."</p><p>Sirius added, "Plus we can't exactly give you a nickname unless you're A) a Marauder or B) an animagus and you're neither, Lil."</p><p>Lily stated, "It's just Lily to you."</p><p>James smirked. "That's you told off, Padfoot."</p><p>Lily glanced at Harry zooming inbetween party goers and sighed. "I remember when I fell pregnant with him, where did the time go?"</p><p>Sirius responded, "I remember the Halloween party I threw which led to his and Neville's births."</p><p>James smiled. "Me too, what a night that was!"</p><p>Lily grinned. "We sure had fun at that party."</p><p>Sirius smirked. "Fun is one word for it."</p><p>Remus appeared again and asked, "Did I hear someone mention Padfoot's Halloween party of 1980?"</p><p>James smiled. "It was Padfoot, Moony."</p><p>Remus grinned. "I remember that party better than all of you because I wasn't drunk."</p><p>Lily replied, "Hey, that drunken fling made Harry."</p><p>James assured her, "He was only pulling your leg, Lil."</p><p>Lily beamed, "I know Prongs, I know."</p></div>
