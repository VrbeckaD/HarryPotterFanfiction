    <p>Charlus and Dorea Potter knew their son would be a talented wizard from the moment he was born. When Dorea took him in her arms for the very first time, she smiled down at his ice blue eyes and dark hair. She certainly did not expect that dark hair to change to blue, and her reaction was of both joy and fear. Joy in knowing her son had an extraordinary power, and fear in knowing what that power meant to others. </p><p>Dorea and Charlus knew that if others found out about their son's power, they would surely want him dead, so they strove to hide him from the rest of the world, under the pretense that he was ill and fragile, until the time that they could teach him to control the power and hide it himself. And so, it was not until he was five years old, the boy was introduced to his mother's family, the Blacks. </p><p>The Black family was large, powerful, and one of the oldest wizarding families there was. They held themselves as royalty, and expected to be treated as such. They held their heirs in high standards, and although Dorea's son was not a Black by name, he was by blood, so he, too, would be held to the same standards as the other children of the Most Ancient and Noble House of Black. </p><p>Dorea was nervous at first, praying her son would not slip up and reveal his power, at the risk of his own life. However, she could not keep him hidden forever. Her family would have to meet him eventually. As her husband made conversation with her father and cousins, Dorea watched her son, who was playing with the daughter of her niece. The other Black's noticed her behavior, of course, but dismissed it as her worrying for her son's health, which as far as they knew was the reason for his seclusion.</p><p>Dorea Potter had nothing to be concerned of, though. Her family adored the child, who was lovely to look at and intriguing to speak to. They spent quite awhile doting over him, telling Dorea how much he looked like her, asking if he'd revealed any magical talent yet, and even going as far to say that he was more Black than Potter. Dorea breathed more easily when they left her family late in the evening. Her son had not slipped up once. The only problem now was keeping his appearance that way from now on. </p><p>When Dorea told her son this, he simply looked at her with coal black eyes that mirrored her own, and a sweet smile that said he understood, and she thought then the exact same thought she'd had when he was born. </p><p>Isidor Lycoris Potter would be an extraordinary wizard.</p>
