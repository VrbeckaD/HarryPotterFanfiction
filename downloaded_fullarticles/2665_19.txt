    <p>It was the last day before a two week school vacation and they were having S.E.L (Sexual Education Lessons) and Harry was finding it hard to stay awake, despite going to bed early the night before, his sleep had been plagued by odd dreams that kept him from a blissful slumber, and now kept him from learning in Snape's new class. <br/> <br/> This unfortunately would result in Gryffindor eventually losing 100 points due to Harry continuously falling asleep and hitting the desk to alert Snape that he in fact was falling asleep during his class. <br/> <br/> 'Mister Potter, would you please wake up. You might learn something.' The words were a growl from thin lips close to his shuttering eyelids. <br/> <br/> 'Sorry, sir. I...(Yawn)...I didn't get much sleep last night.' <br/> <br/> 'Is that so, perhaps you should not be staying up with your dormmates talking about the size of girls breasts.'<br/> <br/> Harry blinked, mouth falling open and cheeks turning pink. 'I...What? Why would we do that? Is that what Slytherin do all night down in the dungeons?' He looked askance, turning briefly to spy Malfoy jerking his eyes away from his seat next to him; Snape had put them at the same bench and separated Harry and his friends. <br/> <br/> 'I went to sleep before everyone else, actually, sir. My dreams were just...Odd that my body didn't get much sleep, turning it over in my head.' He yawned again, unhelpfullly covering it with a hand after everyone else yawned as well. <br/> <br/> 'I see, well, do try to stay awake. Again, you may just learn something. Fall asleep in this class again and you and your house will find themselves 100 points less than this morning. Understood?'<br/> <br/> Harry nodded dumbly, yawning. <br/> <br/> 'Very well...' Severus went to turn away, frowning momentarily as he caught a flash of difference in the teens eyes, then went back onto lecture about proper contraception. It was moments before another thunk told the class that Harry had fallen asleep again. The Professor sighed in annoyance, banging down the packet of muggle contraception he had picked up for this very class. 'POTTER! I will not tell you again!' 'You are pushing your luck.' He kicked a sneaker beneath the desk. Harry jerked awake. 'You are damn near close to losing ALL of Gryffindor's rubies.' <br/> <br/> Harry couldn't stifle the yawn, that turned into something akin to a mewl as a hand gripped the gaping jaw. 'This is an important class, unless you wish to be in the dark come your first time Mister Potter. Do you wish for little Potter's to be running around when you, yourself are still a child?' Snape glared intensely, his hand still gripping Harry's jaw. <br/> <br/> 'Erm...No?' Harry questioned, words sounding as squished as his cheeks. <br/> <br/> 'Then pay attention.' The jaw was let go and he turned back away, watching out the corner of his eye as the teen rubbed at his face and blury eyes. He did look quite tired, bags beneath his silver eyes. Wait. What? Severus spun back around, black eyes intense. <br/> <br/> 'What?' Harry yawned. <br/> <br/> Severus blinked, frowning, 'Nothing...' His eyes briefly flicked to the blonde teen beside the raven teen; he was leaned back with an expression that spoke of someone ripping one off. 'What is the matter Mister Malfoy?' He had the brief thought that perhaps the blonde had seen the same. <br/> <br/> Draco shook his head, he himself frowning. He thought he saw...No, and he thought he smelt...couldn't be. He'd been having all sorts of new aromas since 3 months ago and the smells kept getting stranger and potent, especially around Potter; and just now, out of nowhere, it had gotten immensely strong, but just for a moment. He sat straighter, still shaking his head of it. <br/> <br/> THUNK. <br/> <br/> 'For the love of! Potter, WAKE UP.' <br/> <br/> The jerk from the teen who he had just yelled at, his face inches from the tanned pert nose, sent the boy tumbling backwards after a frightened stare at his professor. 'The hell!' Harry yelled back, stumbling as he disentangled himself from the toppled chair, righted himself and kept standing when Severus grabbed at the chair, anchoring it to the ground. <br/> <br/> 'I rather think that to be my phrase Mister Potter, as you have been repeatedly warned and have repeated ignored them. Get out of my classroom, now, if you are not going to learn in class then you can learn in detention, with me to night at 8.00 O'clock. I expect you at my office door before that time, do I make myself clear?' <br/> <br/> The teen blinked dumbfounded and then jerked his head as he grumbled 'Yes sir, very clear.' The bag was grabbed from newly polished floor-boards of the old classroom and thrown over a shoulder as the raven did an about face and trudged from the room, his classmates avidly watching the spectacle. Severus hadn't really expected the brat to leave so compliantly much less leave at all. <br/> <br/> He paused then quickly cleared his throat as the door shut. 'Hum, hum...Well, let those words and Potter's actions be you're advice for this lesson about how this class is going to go.' <br/> <br/> 'Shit.' Harry grumbled, scrubbing down the side of his face and through his messy black locks. </p>
