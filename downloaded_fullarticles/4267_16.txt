    <p>Marcus leaned casually on the bar of The Green Man and tapped two fingers on his empty whisky glass. Sadly he'd been here enough in the past month or so for the barman to know his usual order. He liked this pub, it was normally quietish but with plenty of monosyllabic locals who were good for the occasional game of pool in the back room. Despite being in a mainly white, working-class part of town he got no grief from the regulars, probably because the barman was blacker than him and the owner was a Chinese octogenarian who seemed to be running some kind of suspect dominoes casino upstairs. At the moment the old guy was enthusiastically supervising the setting up of a karaoke machine in the far corner. Marcus caught the barman's eye and gestured over with his glass<br/>
"Jon, what's up with Xiu?".<br/>
Jon grunted and rolled his eyes "It's all your fault" he said "Xiu decided that he wants more young people like you in so he's having monthly karaoke nights. He's roped my lad into bringing his team tonight for 'good advertising'"<br/>
"Huh" muttered Marcus, slowly sipping some more whisky.</p>
<p>An hour or so later the infernal music machine was up and running. A couple of the regulars had had a go, including Geoff, the virtually mute angler, who had done a surprisingly melodic rendition of <em>The Sound of Silence</em>. In the lull Marcus noticed Xiu eyeing him up as the next victim. He very carefully turned his head away slightly, it wouldn't do to insult the old guy but he didn't think he could stand the embarrassment of public singing. The door suddenly banged open, causing everyone to do the <em>local stare</em> at the new man until they realised it was Jim. Jim got nods.<br/>
"Hey dad" he said as he settled next to Marcus at the bar "The lads are just coming, even managed to entice that cute new guy I was telling you about"<br/>
Jon nodded "Well done lad", his brow wrinkled "New guy?" he asked. Jim rolled his eyes, making Marcus smirk into his glass.<br/>
"Ye-es dad" he replied in a sing-song voice "<em>You</em> know, cute, focused, probably out of my league but keeps checking out my butt in the changing room. Definitely <em>not</em> straight."<br/>
</p>
<p>Marcus started to get the cold tendrils of fear creeping down his back as he stared at his drink. He turned his head slightly towards the younger man.<br/>
"Jim? I'm Mar, new guy at the bar."<br/>
The other lad grinned cheekily "Dad's told me about you" he said, accepting the proffered hand and shaking. Marcus raised his eyebrow at Jon who had the grace to look away slightly abashed.<br/>
"Not every week someone gay, black and under 25 pitches up here and stays for more than one drink. You've been here more than at your own place for the last month" Jon finished, radiating parental concern. Embarrassed, Marcus frowned and looked down, that amber liquid was suddenly looking mighty interesting again. He shrugged off his discomfort and turned back to Jim.</p>
<p>"New guy?" he grunted. At the slender man's nod he carried on "Just over a month?" nod "light brown hair?" nod "complete all-rounder?" nod. Hoo boy, now for the biggie. "Most enthusiastic Scot you'll ever meet?" nod and grin "Shitballs" said Mar with feeling.<br/>
Jim chuckled "I take it you're the one he's not over?" he asked.<br/>
"Shit" said Marcus "I gotta move". He lifted the hand nursing the whisky glass but, before he could down the contents, the barman gently removed it from him.<br/>
"Jon?!" he exclaimed but Jim put a hand on his arm and forced Mar's focus back towards him.<br/>
"Hey Marcus, you don't need to leave, just maybe head up the far end of the bar. I'll do my best to keep him distracted with the rest of the team."
The smaller man smiled as Mar nodded his assent and then stood. Leaning down to Jim's ear, he murmured "If you need to truly distract him, ask him why he never turned pro. You'll either shut him up completely or get a half hour rant depending on his mood."
Marcus straightened and strolled along to where Jon had placed a full glass at the far end of the bar. It wasn't a moment too soon - as he sat down the door flew open and a bakers dozen of rowdy football players appeared, complete with a few girl/boyfriends in tow.<br/>
"JIM!" came the universal cry.<br/>
"Lads!" he called back, "Get your beers in, then we'll show 'em how karaoke's done!" </p>
<p>The door banged shut and there he was. Slightly tousled hair, shy smile. Marcus' eyes slid slightly lower. Oh shit, was that what he thought it was?
 <em>oh shit</em>. A slight gap opened in the crowd, Oliver was wearing <strong>THAT</strong> shirt. He closed his eyes and swallowed as memories overwhelmed him. The shirt he'd bought for Ol two years ago that had been ripped off the footballer's body more times than he'd care to admit; the shirt that had stayed on when they'd fucked so many times because Marcus just couldn't resist Oliver in it. It wasn't much really,
 just a slightly form fitting, royal purple t-shirt with white piping on the sleeves and neckline. But once it was on, oh once it was on. Oliver's trim footballer's body turned into that of Adonis. All his ex had had to do was put on that shirt and raise his eyebrow and Marcus was gone. Every time they had gone out to one of his rugby team's nights out Ol had worn that goddamn t-shirt and they'd ended up fucking in the toilets or an alley or just gone home early. <em>Every. single. time.</em></p>
<p>Shit, Marcus was way too drunk for this. He looked down the bar slightly desperately and saw Jon pouring pints close by.<br/>
"Jon, can I get a water?" he asked. Frowning, Jon didn't look up from his pouring but nodded. As the first pint was filled, the barman flipped up the next glass, dumped the first on the bar, and, using his free hand, flicked an empty one to Marcus, then passed him the soda hose. In less than five seconds he was fully focused on the pint at his tap again.<br/>
"Cheers mate." Marcus said, impressed.<br/>
The older man graced him with a nod "Stick it back on the hook when you're done".<br/>
The rugby player did as instructed, then virtually downed his pint of water. He stood abruptly, suddenly dying for a slash and managed to get to the gents without embarrassing himself. After a long pee at the urinal, Marcus washed his hands and splashed his face. He felt the alcohol running through his system become slightly subdued as he studied himself in the mirror.</p>
<p>He didn't know what Ol had ever seen in him as he stared slightly bleary eyed at himself. Strong brow, strong jaw, lips slightly thin over wonky teeth (he'd chosen rugby over the brace the orthodontist had said he'd needed at fifteen) combined with his hulking frame made him look like a caveman. He kept his hair short because a caveman with a 'fro would just look ridiculous. Jim was wrong, Ol couldn't possibly miss him, it was only Mar that was pining. Here in the men's bog Marcus allowed himself to admit that maybe he was drinking a <em>smidge</em> too much.
 Shit, okay, he was drinking to avoid their flat where <em>everything</em> reminded him of Ol. He splashed his face again, sniffed and strode back out of the bar, pausing next to the karaoke stand where three of the elderly Go players were destroying  <em>Stayin' Alive</em>. Marcus grinned suddenly, grabbed the clipboard and scrawled down two songs. Still smiling, he headed back to his stool for another pint of water while he waited to be called.</p>
