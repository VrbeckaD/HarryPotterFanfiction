<p>Anonymous </p>

<p>Draco drew Harry towards an inconspicuous doorway. </p>
<p>“They don’t make it easy to find,” Harry murmured. </p>
<p>“Of course not.” Draco tossed a smirk over his shoulder. “Where’s the fun in that? Then <i>anyone</i> could get in.” </p>
<p>“Right,” said Harry as Draco nodded at a bloke standing guard. </p>
<p>The bloke smirked at Draco, ignoring Harry completely, and as they slipped inside, the loud music was replaced by something softer, more sensual. </p>
<p>Harry looked around, but it was too dark to see anything.</p>
<p>“Don’t stare,” whispered Draco. “Although, if you see something interesting—”</p>
<p>Harry shook his head. “Let’s do something <i>you</i> like.” </p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Spinning around, Draco walked Harry backwards until he hit the wall. “Relax,” he whispered.</p>
<p>Harry nodded, closing his eyes. “Okay— Oh!” Draco dragged his teeth over Harry’s neck, eliciting a moan, and as Harry arched closer, he tried to ignore the music of lovemaking he could hear all around them. </p>
<p>“Heady, isn’t it?” whispered Draco. “There are people fucking all around us, yet we’re completely anonymous.” </p>
<p>Harry whimpered as Draco palmed his cock through his trousers. “Anyone could see,” he gasped. </p>
<p>“I know.” Draco deftly undid Harry’s flies, freeing him. “So, are you an exhibitionist, Harry?” </p>
<p>Harry shivered. He had no idea.</p>
