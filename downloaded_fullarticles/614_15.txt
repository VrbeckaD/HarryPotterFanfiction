    <p>Hermione Granger wasn't the sort of girl who enjoyed group projects — once submerged in the said academic situation, she tended to thrive under pressure and quickly assume her rightful authoritative position, proving to everyone she could complete the task by herself. It was undeniably a frustrating atmosphere, trapped within a never-ending cycle of her classmates wrong answers, and her own misery. No, what really bothered Hermione Granger, was her professors adamant insistence that she work alongside her classmates.</p><p>Group projects reminded her of mundane memories of primary school, how her below-subpar classmates would somehow always get credited for her work. Her surprising hatred for group activities was a monstrous coffee stain on her otherwise spotless attitude towards education.</p><p>Despite Hermione’s previous track record with the education system, her sixth year was proving to be the most difficult. Not only was the world she lived in growing continuously darker by the moment, but potions class seemed to be the fundamental root of all her problems.</p><p align="center"><em><strong> Potions</strong></em>.</p><p>Somehow, someway, Harry had surpassed her moderately impressive talent in brewing potions, and that was a problem. Despite her forced positive attitude, problems kept popping up all around Hermione; not only was their new potions professor practically begging Harry to live in a glass case by his bed, but Professor Slughorn seemed to disregard <em>EVERYTHING</em> Hermione said. It was unbelievable, unjust, and most importantly, yet another unwanted problem to crowd her (already jammed packed) brain.</p><p>“You really should follow my instructions.” Harry murmured out of the side of his mouth, his eyes still fixed unblinkingly ahead, “It's obviously the correct way to do it.” Even as he spoke, his Potion began to simmer a reproachful shade of blue — exactly what the entire classroom had been working feverishly towards for the past forty-five minutes.</p><p>“Perhaps,” Hermione hissed from between her teeth as she continued to angrily stir her Potion (which was an unforgiving shade of yellow) “<em>YOU</em> should stop listening to the writings of a mysterious book — do you remember what happened last time you listened to whatever a book told you? You fought a snake and Ginny ended up killing chickens! So many chickens, Harry.” Hermione let out a disapproving sigh, her flyaways fluttering in front of her vision.</p><p>“The potion is supposed to be red, right?” Ron blindly interrupted, his brow furrowed as he stirred his blood red position, his left eyebrow still smoking. (From where Pansy Parkinson had “accidentally” flung a spoonful of her pink Potion at his face)</p><p>“No, Ron.” Hermione snapped, still breathing heavily. “It's supposed to be <em>that</em> color,” she gestured angrily with her spoon in Harry’s direction, splattering her potion across their tables surface, “Take a look at the insufferable idiot you share a room with.” She slammed her fist against the leaves she should've been properly chopping (this way, it released more of her stress) and fought off the urge to silently cause Harry’s cauldron to explode.</p><p>“Do you mind if I just…” Ron trailed off, casually copying the unfamiliar scrawling that covered Harry’s pages on the back of his hand, once again vanishing from the argument.</p><p>“Are you finished?” Harry asked, with the sort of edge to his voice that implied dangerous and uncharted territories lay ahead in their conversation, “because I have to turn my potion in. You know, the perfect example of what Slughorn wanted..”</p><p>“I'm not even close to being finished,” Hermione argued, her finger jutting outwards and angrily jabbing against the front of Harry's robes (a bad habit the both had grown accustomed to — when angry, Hermione poked) “<b>You are cheating</b>.”</p><p>“Like you've never done anything wrong before!” Harry fired back, his voice climbing to an angry whisper, which was beginning to attract several moderately amused stares from their classmates — “If I can remember correctly, last Saturday morning — ”</p><p>“That wasn't <em>cheating</em>.” Hermione interrupted, her cheeks quickly filling with blush at Harry’s mention of her casual rule breaking the previous weekend — he had found her in the kitchen, attempting to enchant several house-elves into believing they were diplomats from Spain.</p><p>“Oh, it wasn't?” Harry shot back, mimicking the way she spoke; despite his juvenile approach to annoying Hermione, it worked. Huffing angrily, Hermione surged sideways, attempting to grab the Potions book, intent on using it as kindling for the common room fire.</p><p>“Hermione — what the <em>hell</em> — get <strong>OFF</strong>!” Harry complained, his voice tinged with surprise as he held the potions book above his head, his gangly arms aiding him in their scuffle. The slight disruption from their usual whispering caused Ron to look up, roll his eyes, and return to his potion, which now held the consistency of a thick purple soup.</p><p>“Give it —” Hermione grunted through clenched teeth, her arms flailing about furiously, as if she was a passive aggressive windmill, “ — <em>Harry</em>!” Despite her best attempts, Harry shoved her back into her seat, the potions book secured firmly under his left arm. Breathing heavily, he pushed his hair out of his vision, his eyes narrowing ever so slightly.</p><p>“You're mental!” he hissed, “Let me make my <b>own</b> choices! I <em>know</em> what I’m doing — ”</p><p>“No, you don't.” Hermione interrupted him, angrily stirring her potion, refusing to acknowledge how hopeless her entire situation was, “You're going to end up killing someone.”</p><p>“No, I'm not!” Harry argued back, his voice raising an octave above whispering, causing several students to turn and watch in bewilderment as Harry Potter argued with Hermione Granger, both angrily stirring their potions as they spoke; as their argument progressed, the quicker they stirred.</p><p>“<em>YES</em>,” Hermione growled in his direction, her attention from their argument momentarily faltering as her school robes caught on fire (she had placed her sleeve a little too close to the flame underneath her cauldron. Perhaps, if she tried hard enough, her sleeves minor combustion could be used as poignant example of Harry’s reckless track record.) “You just might kill someone, I mean, out of the three of us, you’re the only one with a previous track record involving <strong>DEATH</strong>!”</p><p>“Look —” Ron interjected, his (still smoking) eyebrows screwed together in concentration as his potion began to resemble the color of mustard, “ — ‘Mione, it's <em>Harry</em>. He’ll be alright...and even if this book ends up being dangerous, he’ll be <em>fine</em>. It'll be like it always is.” He looked up to find both his friends looking at him in bewilderment.</p><p>“What?” Ron squawked, “I'm just speaking from experience! Everything always ends up <b>fine</b> for Harry, I mean, he could've picked any of the books...but he picked that one.” He nudged his best friend's shoulder, “Maybe it's good luck.”</p><p>“Yeah,” Harry agreed, in a smug sort of way, “this book probably is lucky Hermione, I need all the luck I can get.”</p><p>“<em>Ron</em>!” Hermione hissed in exasperation, still slightly smoking, “You're supposed to make him feel <strong>BAD</strong> about using the book, not rekindle the fire of heroism that constantly burns underneath him!” Turning to Harry, Hermione opened her mouth, intent on lecturing him until the sun went behind the clouds, but instead she found an empty seat and a retreating figure as Harry made his way to the front of the class, his cauldron clutched in his grasp.</p><p>“I hate him.” Hermione murmured sourly, slouching back into her seat, returning her attention to her potion, which was beginning to turn a dark navy. “He never <em>thinks</em>.”</p><p>“He'll be fine.” Ron repeated, sounding like a broken children's toy, “ — by the way. Do you remember what Harry's book said to do? My instructions smudged together.” He held up his right hand, showing that his carefully scrawled instructions had indeed become an inky mess.</p><p>“Please shut up.” Hermione whispered, concentrating on not smashing her head against the desks wooden surface, “I'm trying to think.”</p><p>Ron’s aggressive mumbling faded to silence as he attempted to decipher his own writing and Hermione was finally granted what she'd always wanted: silence. Of course, her bliss was short-lived.</p><p>“Sluggy loved it.” Harry greeted the pair when he returned, failing to acknowledge the death glares Hermione shot him, and how Ron weakly began attempting to steal Harry’s potions book from his bag, “Told me he'd never seen such a perfect replica.” He smirked, obviously proud of his accomplishments, no matter how he'd achieved them. “</p><p>Did you tell <em>sluggy</em> your potion was laced with lies and deceit?” Hermione grumbled, silently berating herself for giving up on her pre-decided silent treatment so quickly. Ron snorted beside her, oblivious to the fact that his potion had turned to the consistency of wet cement.</p><p>“I don't understand why you're so interested in my moral compass.” Harry yawned, clearly enjoying himself — it was a rare occasion to see the golden trio without at least one member steaming from an argument, “You’ve helped me break rules loads of times.”</p><p>“Very true, you literally brewed an illegal potion when we were twelve, Ron piped up, his face immediately falling once his gaze fell upon his potion, which had evaporated all together, taking his cauldron with it. “What the fuck,” he grumbled, poking his head under the table, obviously looking for his cauldron.</p><p>“That is just <em>one</em> of the times.” Harry continued as he tapped his finger lightly against the desk, smiling lightly at the way his best friend began to squirm with anger, “Face it Hermione, you’re just unhappy because you're not the best.”</p><p>“Did you take my cauldron — ” Ron began, but was interrupted when Hermione angrily slammed her potions book down against the desk, rising slowly to her feet.</p><p>Hermione prided herself in being the rational one, the voice of reason — the reason they were all still alive — but it that moment, all she wanted to do was cause a social disruption. Harry was everything to her, he was her true best friend. During the summer between their second year he had somehow acquired one of his cousins old cell phones and without having any second thoughts, Harry had quickly called Hermione, something he still did almost every summer night they were apart — their friendship was stronger than anything Hermione had ever dreamed of, but there were times where she truly, deeply, unquestionably, wanted to smack his head with a book.</p><p>“I am leaving.” She spoke with a level voice, hoisting her cauldron off the table and marching away from their desk, her school bag swinging behind her.</p><p>Watching her march to the head of the class, Harry frowned. “She’s only mad because she knows I’m right.” He grumbled, he glanced over at Ron was miserably starting from scratch, using one of the scrappy school cauldrons. “Ron,” Harry spoke in disbelief, “where the fuck is your cauldron?”</p><p align="center">- - - - - - - - - - - - - -</p><p>Exactly four tables away, Draco Malfoy glared angrily down at his cauldron, his mouth twisted firmly into a frown. Try as he might, he couldn't seem to create the desired potion — his table mates were having similar luck, but they were often subpar at most things, so being in the same boat as them only made Draco’s mood worse. Goyle was sleeping, using his cauldron as a pillow, Crab had been sent the Hospital Wing fourteen minutes earlier, for accidentally eating a beetle, and Theodore Nott had given up altogether and was blatantly doing his charms homework underneath his desk.</p><p>Despite his previous success in potions, their new professor was absolute rubbish — Slughorn spent a disgusting amount of time fawning over fucking Harry Potter, who had somehow discovered how to use his brain. Malfoy had spent the first forty-five minutes of class watching the trio from the corner of his eye. There had been some minor explosions (verbally and physically) and it had ended with fucking Potter proudly marching to the front of the class, leaving a steaming (literally) Granger in his wake. Did it bother Draco that Slughorn prefered Potter over him? Not at all. Did it bother Draco that Potter somehow was better than him at something?</p><p align="center"><em> OF COURSE</em>.</p><p>But, to be perfectly frank, Draco could give exactly zero fucks about Slughorn. He’d be dead soon, they all would. Harry Potter would meet his end, as would his adoring ginger sidekick (who looked worse for wear this morning — was his fucking eyebrow smoking?) and even god damn Granger would finally be silenced. (Yet Draco had a painful feeling that Granger would somehow resurrect herself and haunt him for the rest of his life, her shrill voice filling his brain for eternity.)</p><p>“Oi, Malfoy —” a distant whisper broke through Draco’s clouded thoughts of death and destruction, to meet the narrowed eyes of his fellow companion, Pansy Parkinson. Her face was twisted in her ever-present sour expression, her fingers tapping angrily against the wooden top of her table, her potion an alarming color of orange, “— How the fuck do we do this rubbish?” She had constantly turned to Draco for help in potions, his skill in this class had carried practically the entire Slytherine House over the years. Beside her, Zabini carelessly threw an entire frog carcass in his cauldron, causing a purple flame to overflow from the top, burning off his mate’s eyebrows all together.</p><p>“Fuck off, Parkinson,” Draco whispered back, inching his cauldron closer to his chest (his potion was a despicable shade of lime green) “Figure out yourself.” Refusing to help Pansy was probably not the smartest choice, she would inevitably make him suffer — Pansy thrived off of others unhappiness. Pretending to ignore her angry expression, Draco began to stir his potion feverishly; this was not the best choice. Somehow, his potion had obtained a somewhat acidic quality, which quickly became prevalent when it dissolved his spoon.</p><p>“Pansy,” Zabini whispered hoarsely, momentarily diverting Pansy from glaring at the back of Draco’s head, “My eyebrows are gone.”</p><p>Sighing with annoyance, Draco began to rummage through the desk drawers for another spoon — when he heard it: “I'm leaving.” The shrill sound of Hermione Granger’s voice, dripping with annoyance, found its way to his ears. Glancing up from his quest for a spoon, Malfoy caught a glance as Granger stomped past his table, muttering darkly to herself, her cauldron clutched tightly to her chest. Although Malfoy had a hard time deciphering exactly what she was saying, he heard the words “<em>insufferable</em>” and “<em>idiot</em>” tossed about.</p><p align="center">Despite himself, he smirked.</p><p>They were in dark times, indeed — a war was looming, darkness was gathering, fear was growing and Draco was at the center of it all. Yet, there he was, sitting in the back of potions class finding it within himself to laugh at the misfortunes of Hermione Granger. More often than not, Draco found himself actually relating to the mudblood; it would happen in the strangest ways — she would laugh at the same jokes their professors told, often he would find her name written neatly on the checkout list to the same books he intended to read, she would roll her eyes at the exact thing he found annoying...it was infuriating. The misfortune of being alike to someone you desperately despise was something Draco wouldn’t wish upon anyone, not even their bloody savior Potter.</p><p>In another life — a better life — Draco would’ve dedicated his entire school year to the pursuit of figuring Potter’s overnight success in subject he was clearly inferior in. If he was still twelve years old, desperate for his father's approval, Draco would’ve sabotaged Harry — even two years ago, Draco would’ve allowed his wounded pride to control him. But now? All Draco could do was laugh softly at the misfortunes of Hermione Granger, who was suffering the same fate as he.</p><p>“Mate — whatya thinking about?” Goyle asked sleepily, interrupting Draco’s brooding thoughts, “Yer potions on fire.” He concluded his poorly structured sentence with a series of alarmed grunts and frantic hand gestures, causing Malfoy to roll his eyes once again. “My what?” Draco snapped, annoyed that Granger had somehow inspired some nostalgia to take bloom in his chest, “Goyle, use your fucking words. We’ve talked about this.” With a lazy wave of his wand, Draco extinguished the fire.</p><p>"In his defense," Theodore murmured, still obviously doing homework for another class, "Your potion <em>was</em> on fire." </p><p>Before Draco could reply (in a most likely grumpy fashion) Slughorn’s voice rang through the musty dungeon, bouncing off the grimy walls, “Attention students! I have a delightful announcement to make!”</p><p>“Is it about my growing need to kill myself?” Pansy grumbled as she mixed her sludge-like lime green potion, “because if so, allow me to deliver my 12 minute speech.” When Draco met her eyes, she shrugged. “What?” She whispered, “I've prepared for this moment.”</p><p>“For the next 6 weeks, you will be working alongside each other, at an attempt to create a unity between the Houses.” Slughorn gestured to where Potter sat in the back of the class, smiling proudly at his favorite student, “Just ask Harry Potter, the best student in the class — I am undoubtedly his favorite professor, yet I hail from the Slytherin house, Gryffindors sworn enemy.” He chortled slightly, apparently oblivious to the silent awkwardness that had settled above his students. “Each of you will be matched with a student from another house — together, you will work alongside each other to accomplish unthinkable potions, impossible tasks and most importantly, you will begin to understand the importance of having allies who aren’t quite like yourself!”</p><p>His booming announcement was met with glum silence. Draco glanced back to Pansy, who rolled her eyes and whispered,“They're going to stick me with a fucking Hufflepuff, I fucking know it.”</p><p>“Your partners have been selected randomly,” Slughorn continued, refusing to acknowledge that no one was excited about his sad attempt at creating house unity, “Except for you, Harry. As the only student who successfully created this afternoon's potion, you have the prize of picking anyone you want as your partner, regardless of their house.”</p><p>Draco rolled his eyes in annoyance, aggressively smashing his beetles into a powder with the back of spoon. The Dark Lord had specifically sought Draco out, he’d practically been groomed for this exact moment in his life, yet here Draco sat, grinding beetles and mashing frog eyes. It was ironic, really, how drastically his life had changed — before, The Dark Lord had swept past Draco's kneeling form with little regard. But now? Now, Draco Malfoy was a secret weapon. (A secret weapon who couldn’t brew a simple bloody potion, but a secret weapon none the less!) He was important. He was needed. He was terrified of the darkness that surrounded him, but it had been so long since Draco Malfoy had even seen the light, that he barley noticed anymore.</p><p align="center">Slughorns childish voice began to call out partnered students, his enthusiasm meeting a rather cold silence. Perhaps it was the past solider-like regime Snape had instilled in them with anything concerning potions, or perhaps it was simply because the students disliked him, but Slughorn was fighting an uphill battle, one he’d inevitably lose.</p><p align="left">The afternoon sun was dwindling, there were only a few more names on the list when it happened: Slughorn cleared his throat and called into the echoing dungeon, "Draco Malfoy shall be partnered with Hermione Granger! They must create a potion that resembles the elixir of life!"</p><p>At the sound of her name, Hermione's eyes jerked up in adamant horror and met Malfoy's at once, the pair of them squinting in annoyed bewilderment at each other from across the dungeon. "Oh no," Hermione muttered to herself as she pushed herself up from behind the desk, trying to ignore the sinking feeling in her stomach, "this <em>can't</em> be happening." Unfortunately for <strong>everyone</strong> involved, it was. Malfoy was dealing with similar feelings of displeasure as he watched Granger make her way towards him, her arms perched firmly on her hips. In the grand scheme of things, being partnered with a Mudblood wasn't the worst thing that could've happened to Draco Malfoy (He could've been eaten by the giant squid in the lake, or perhaps Professor McGonagall could've forced him to participate in a hugging contest with a Hippogriff) but it pretty fucking high on the list. If it had been any other Mudblood in the entire school, Draco could've dealt with it with the poise and grace only a Malfoy possessed (i.e. being a dick) but this was Hermione Granger, his insults had never seemed to affect her, no matter how hard he tried.</p><p>"I suppose this was your doing." Malfoy spoke as a greeting once Granger reached his table, her usually bright face twisted into a frown, "Found yet another way to torture me to death with your Mudblood activism and your Gryffindor pride?" As he spoke, Hermione rolled her eyes, only causing to infuriate Malfoy further — this, Hermione was not aware of, but if she was, it only please her. The dungeon around them was softly buzzing with several conversations as their classmates made awkward smalltalk, attempting (but gravely failing) to ignore the pairs conversation.</p><p>"Oh, please." Hermione grumbled, mentally making a list of all the ways she could get out of her current situation (Feigning death was too high up on the list for her liking) "Like <em>I </em>would willingly manipulate a situation to spend more time with <b>you</b>." As she spoke, Hermione's eyes narrowed in suspicion as she glared up at him. Draco Malfoy, like most people, was taller than Hermione — but he was infuriatingly tall. <em>Too</em> tall. "Did <strong>you</strong> do this? Is this another one of your dumb plans? What are you going to do, Malfoy? Insult me to death?" She snorted at her own joke, crossing her arms across her chest. It was a strange moment in both of their lives: here they stood, on the cusp of adulthood, taunting each other with playground insults. The watercolor paintings of their childhood had long dried and the time to grow up was arriving too quickly; but as the world changed around them, Hermione Granger and Draco Malfoy could cling to one constant — they'd always have the other to blame.</p><p>"If I ever show signs of wanting to spend excessive time around <em>you</em>, please alert the Hospital Wing," Draco sneered, "Tell ol' Poppy that I've been cursed and by some cruel twist of fate, the side effects include fraternizing with the enemy."</p><p>"Don't call teachers by their first name, it's unprofessional." Hermione protested as she reluctantly filled the seat across from his at their new potions station and began to sulkily stack her potions textbooks on the worn wooden surface. The pair feel into an uneasy silence, Hermione obviously attempting to hide herself behind an enormous stack of books, and Malfoy glaring holes into said stack of books.</p><p>"What about Hagrid?" Malfoy snapped after what seemed to be a blissful eternity of silence (realistically it had been 56 seconds), "You and all the other Potter sympathizers <em>love</em> to spend time with that offish buffoon, but we <strong>all </strong>call him by his first name, which is Hagrid." Draco paused, triumphantly leaning back in his seat, "Don't try to hide, Granger. You know I'm right."</p><p>"Hagrid is his last name." Hermione spoke from behind her teetering pile of books, "You should talk less."</p><p>"You can't be serious." Draco grumbled, glancing around the dungeon in disgust. His other classmates seemed to be getting along impossibly well with their partners, even Pansy seemed intrigued by Luna Lovegoods ramblings — no doubt their potion would be a legitimate fire hazard. Zabini was already hard at work at wooing one of the Patil twins, and Theo had somehow convinced his partner (some willing Hufflepuff) to help him with his charms essay, the two of them scribbling a way in the corner. "And I get stuck with the filthy Mudblood." Draco sighed.</p><p align="center">"Don't call her that."</p><p>Any sign of their previous argument had vanished as Harry placed a protective hand on her shoulder, stepping forward slightly to be in line with Hermione. “Fuck off Malfoy.” Harry spoke so softly it was even hard for Hermione to hear and her left side was practically smashed against his ribcage. Although Harry had been submerged in the wizarding world for six years, his go to defense mechanism was still to clench his fist in anticipation of a fist fight — it happened often enough that Hermione typically would tap the wand in his left back pocket. It was a gentle reminder to say: <b>we have magical abilities, idio</b>t. If Harry wasn't careful, the next time he fought Voldemort he might impulsively punch him in the face.</p><p>“I’m sorry, but are you my partner as well? Is this a packaged deal?” Malfoy asked in a clipped tone, his upper lip curling into a sneer, “I’d hate to spend time with either of you separately, but together? I just might convince Weasley to be our partner as well, get the complete experience.” Three sets of eyes found Ron in the crowd, who was slouched wordlessly next to Luna Lovegood, his eyes closed in evident slumber.</p><p>“Hermione is <em>my</em> partner. Slughorn said I could pick anyone I wanted—” At this point in the conversation, Harry was carefully rolling up the sleeves of his robes, as if he was a member of some underground fight club that catered to tall, skinny boys with anger issues, “And I picked her.”</p><p>“Don’t I get a say in this?” Hermione finally snapped, “Obviously, I am repulsed by the idea of spending time with Malfoy,” She flashed a fake grin in Malfoy’s direction, “But am I understanding this correctly? You don’t think I could survive being his partner?” Thousands of thoughts were whizzing about Hermione’s head, her fingers were itching to tap angrily against something (she settled for her thigh) but mainly, she was firmly determined to take on the challenge at hand.</p><p>“I know you couldn’t.” Harry snapped in his ‘<b>I’m a very important person</b>’ voice that he only reserved for moments where he wanted to ensure he got his way, “You hate him more than anyone we’ve ever met. By the way, how is your insane aunt? Still batshit crazy? Does it run in the family?” Harry took a step closer to Malfoy, now officially planting himself in front of Hermione, “Is your mum next?”</p><p>As Hermione gagged at the sophomoric insults her best friend was tossing about, Malfoy evidently took Harry's jab to heart and promptly responded with, “At least I have parents.” </p><p>"Alright, now you're just making basic observations," Hermione protested, pressing the heel of her hands firmly against her forehead, "You can't possibly be offended by that, could you Harry?" Perhaps it was the fact that Harry was yet again recklessly bending the rules to his will, or maybe it was the fact that he'd practically said he didn't believe her, but Hermione was annoyed. And when Hermione was annoyed, she usually stubbornly clung to whatever point she wanted to make, regardless of the doomed outcome. </p><p>"Harry," Hermione grasped the edge of his sweater and yanked him closer to her, "Please stop attempting to fight my battles for me, you quite literally have too many of your own to face." He opened his mouth to protest, but Hermione sushed him by placing a finger over his mouth. What a strange picture to see, Harry grumpily leaning against the table, Hermione balancing on her tippy toes, pressing her finger to his lips. "I'll be fine." She said, smiling slightly up at him, "It'll be like it <b>always</b> is. Besides," She glanced back at Malfoy, who was deeply engrossed in examining his fingernails, "It's just Malfoy. How harmful can he actually be?'</p><p align="center">It seemed like everyone was about to find out.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>
