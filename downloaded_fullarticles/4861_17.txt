— </em>from<em> Antigonick </em>by Sophokles, trans. Anne Carson</p><p align="center"> </p>
<hr/><p>  </p><p><em>Blood</em>. Tom snarls in a corner, knees skidding on stale water. He’s watching in fury as a gang of boys from his form stalk across the communal showers, towards him like a pack hunting their prey. </p><p>How did everything go so <em>wrong</em>, Tom thinks. He can feel his body shake, unsure if it comes from adrenalin or all his eight-year old’s worth of rage. His first adoption ultimately turned into an educating experience of what not to do, and he was sure to apply the knowledge when he left the orphanage a second time. </p><p>Picture-perfect, keen-eyed, sharp-mind Tom, hiding any — <em>funny business</em> (as his previous adopter explained him away, back to Mrs. Cole) — with the veneer manners and polite obedience provided. And the Thackerays had immediately welcomed him to a new home with open arms. Be a wolf in lamb’s clothing, Tom had repeatedly reminded himself. Yet right now, as Tom tries to shakily rise up from the floor, he knows he isn’t the wolf anymore.</p><p>Groupthink, as a psychological term, wouldn’t be used until decades later;<br/>
but here. In this moment; <br/>
— <em>Now</em>: Tom back on <br/>
the ground again. Thin skin breaks <br/>
under fingernails and cracked knuckles. Blood being smeared <br/>
across porcelain tiles. The feeling of raw flesh <br/>
against cold water. Darkness edging<br/>
into his vision.</p><p>Everything is going off like snapshots in Tom’s mind, occasionally erupting in bursts of red fire. The persistent humming at the back of his mind gradually rises into a whine, but only this doesn’t fade away; Tom is lying in sticky redness, and unable to think. The pain aching around his sides has been gradually giving away to a persistent thudding in his head, so painful it makes him feel as if his teeth is rattling in accordance to the same beat with his mind.  </p><p>Tom tries to scrabble against the wet floor for purchase, unwilling to lay down as rugby practice. The boys laugh, and the leader is saying words foreign to his ringing ears, but the twisted face he makes is universally recognizable as a sneer. Suddenly all the air is expelled from his lungs as Tom falls. He’s choking on coughed-up air and blood, with a footprint newly muddying his torn cotton shirt.</p><p>One part of him is desperate. His eyes are stinging with unshed tears and he’s in so much pain, but he keeps his mouth clamped shut, jaw achingly tight. His lips are twisted together so hard they turn white. </p><p>Tom knows what he needs to do so they will stop hurting him. They want him to beg for forgiveness for being a strange child, but he refuses to open his mouth. It’s not a matter of pride, not really; he’s given up so much more, in order to go from a penniless orphan, to living in Westminster and attending one of the finest prep schools in the country. Tom doesn’t want to dwell on regret, on both what he has and has not done. Looking into his own soul isn’t a luxury he can afford. And doesn’t he sound cynical, for a child? Yet opening his mouth and apologizing — and apologizing for <em>what</em>, exactly? — feels like a revolting notion that goes against the very core of his body.</p><p>He knows he’s not a freak. He’s special in the way that clearly no one else is in the world. People fear what they don’t understand, and how Tom loathes this part of humanity. (Is this what makes him a monster?) So when Tom pushes away from the floor to stand up again, his black hair sticky and thighs a pulpy mess, Tom looks at the boys pulling back their legs to give him another round of kicking.</p><p>And <em>smiles</em>, because Tom remembers what it is that they fear about him. He knows that the boys will definitely fear <em>this</em>, and suddenly the ringing in his mind explodes outwards, as if in agreement. </p><p>“Like fireworks," Tom tells Harry much later, as they sit crisscrossed in bed together, tangled in bedsheets and each other’s limbs. “It was glorious.” </p><p>Right now, though, Tom is falling back onto the floor again, collecting yet another bruise to his already black-and-blue body. It’s not the force of another kick that knocks him backwards, but rather something that seems to expel out of him without his volition. The boys around him freeze, eyes darting from side to side, the human mind automatically deferring to animal instinct — until the leader of the gang shakes if off with a rattled laugh. Tom replies with one of his own, matching grin for grin, and he’s entirely conscious of the way he bares his teeth mimics more of a snarl.</p><p>Then as if time has slowed down, Tom feels suspended in amber, aware of the multitude of unlimited possibilities trembling in every single second. Pain becomes a dim afterthought, an echo of ache turning in his bones. He feels himself burning, from a concoction of desperation and rage shooting through his veins. And for one magnificent moment Tom lights up like a shooting star, hot and molten to his very core. </p><p>He goes <em>incandescent</em>.</p><p>And — as if the laws of nature are bending in acceptance to a new sun, the wet floor gives a faint shudder, and shower cubicles tremble in harmony with the lavatory basins. The walls behind him lurches, and Tom wonders if this is why villains throw back their head in the old films, laughing like a maniac in the backdrop of their explosions. His anger has gained a new blade-sharp edge of vicious giddiness, and suddenly Tom is overwhelmed by how he wants too many things oh-so desperately.</p><p>The boys are stumbling back now, their faces marked with alarm and worry. Tom doesn’t know which part of what’s happening comes from conscious control, or as an extension from his own soul. As the latrines start gushing out fountains of tepid water, Tom finds he doesn’t really care.</p><p>That was me, he thinks. Wasn't it?  </p>
<hr/><p><br/>
In hindsight, limping out of the half-destroyed changing rooms with a deranged smile on his face wasn’t the best decision Tom’s ever made.</p><p>One of the boys that had kicked his stomach sees Tom and shudders, his mouth automatically moving in a silent prayer. Now instead of jeering down at Tom, as they had done so a handful of minutes earlier, the boys are lying together on smashed floor tiles. Another boy is on his knees, enthusiastically vomiting out buckets of brown sludge and red water. Tom looks at them and sees a heap of broken images.</p><p>“I think it was the water pressure,” Tom offers politely, to the shocked crowd of masters that had rushed to the scene, still warm from wearing a uniform soaked through with blood.</p><p>He tries to stop smiling, and finds that he can’t.</p><p>Between the suspended space of exhilarated uncertainty that lasts until he finds out Hogwarts exists, Tom keeps coming back to this point in the chasm years. It’s less a hymn of onism strung from regret (after all, he went back to the orphanage and found <em>Harry</em>), yet nevertheless still a moment tinged black, with the closure of a path that Tom will never be able to access again. Perhaps it’s this first feeling of true lost that sticks uncomfortably close to him.</p><p>(In the particularly harsh winter spanning past his ninth birthday and into the edges of late March, Tom huddles with Harry beneath their thin moth-eaten blankets, and unwillingly remembers the weekly joints of roast beef at the Thackerays. The fine clothes, the Latin prep books, the mews house tucked behind the grand shadow of Trafalgar Square — all luxuries he’s never had for the first six years of his life, fine things of splendor he didn’t have the time to grow accustomed to. But <em>oh</em>, it’s the constant hunger lurching in his stomach that hurts the most.</p><p><em>—</em>He doesn’t think of love, because what affection the Thackerays gave him was but a pale intimacy of how Harry treats him.)</p><p>The boys refuse to tell the Headmaster what happened in there, of course. Tom didn’t need to solicit a promise from them; after all, how <em>do</em> you explain your too-quiet too-clever classmate adopted from some poor shanty orphanage in backwards London, that you were beating bloody and black and blue, suddenly imploding in the light of white divinity?</p><p> </p>
