    <p>Summer holiday has finally started and barely a week has passed since Charlie Weasley last saw you. <em>This will not do</em>, he had concluded after a few restless nights. The heat was starting to melt his brain, and in frenzy, he had confided in Bill that he wishes to see you. It was fairly amusing, to be honest, as the two oldest siblings were helping mum with gardening and Charlie kept mumbling about something Bill only heard in snippets <em>“(Name)…see her…dragons…bloody hell…quidditch….does (Name) like quidditch?…or dragons?….</em>”. After an hour or so of this, Bill dropped his gardening tools and while mum was preoccupied with weeding out some pests he had approached his brother, laid a hand on his shoulder, and grinned mischievously, “Bloody hell Charlie, are you in love or something?”</p>
<p>Charlie had nearly gotten a stroke, there and then. After fumbling with his words, sweating, and blushing, he finally admitted that, “Wouldn’t it be fun…for the whole gang to come visit? Just for a couple of days…”</p>
<p>“Like who?” Bill grilled, hardly containing his glee. Charlie gulped.</p>
<p>“Like…Penny, Tonks, Barnaby…Rowan…(<em>Name</em>).” His voice grew silent by the word. Bill leaned in.</p>
<p>“Sorry, didn’t catch that last part.”</p>
<p>“Are you serious?”</p>
<p>“No, I’m Bill.”</p>
<p>But eventually, like a good older brother, Bill had eased up on his teasing and promised to invite the whole gang over for a visit. Charlie had beamed, already looking forward to it. Bill had ulterior motives in mind. This new information about a crush had sparked his interest and he swore to himself that he would stop at nothing to embarrass Charlie in front of you. All in good, brotherly fun of course.</p>
<p>Days passed like weeks and the start of July couldn’t come any quicker. Charlie was restless with anticipation. By now he had chatted the whole Burrow off about you and your friends. He was obvious, really, and even Fred and George had secretly started referring to this mysterious (Name) as ‘<em>Charlie’s stupid girlfriend’</em>. Ron was excited. Percy – indifferent. Little Ginny hid at the mere mention of guests coming over.</p>
<p>The day is sunny, cheery, windy. The fields are golden with rye and sway at the lightest touch. Charlie had just landed and hopped off of his broom, an old quaffle in his hand as his hair is a dishevelled mess. Bill already on ground waits for Charlie with a grin plastered onto his face as he notes a group of fifth years being smothered by his mother. Charlie takes in a deep breath and approaches the gang with a silly smile, his brother following suit.</p>
<p>“<em>Mum</em>…!” Charlie whines, and at his voice Molly gives him a displeased look, but lets Rowan go; his attention then turns to the eager group of classmates, “…Mornin’.”</p>
<p>“Wicked place you got, Charles.” Tonks says as her eyes wander around area, “Were you playing Quidditch? Can we practice later?”</p>
<p>“Sure.” He agrees, glancing at you, “…Hey, (Name).”  You grin at him and he can feel his cheeks heating.</p>
<p>“Quite the hairdo you’ve got there.” You comment. Charlie rubs the back of his neck, embarrassed.</p>
<p>“Enjoy it while you can…” Molly mumbles ominously, finally turning to leave, “Come now, <em>everyone</em>! Breakfast is ready!”</p>
<p>The day continues with jests and snickers. Before long, everyone disperses.</p>
<p>Tonks had taken a special interest in Fred and George. She had lured them outside, grinning all the while, as they showed her where the broom closet is and she had borrowed one. The three of them lay on the grass, brooms beside them, discussing pranks and jokes and giggling mischievously at the expense of others. Tonks sometimes sends a look Ron’s way, or Rowan’s, whispering something to the twins only they know about. If the day goes by without a prank pulled, it will truly be a miracle.</p>
<p>Bill and Rowan took Ronald and Ginny under their wing. The shy girl hid behind the second youngest sibling as Rowan ushered her outside to play in the sun. While Bill is preoccupied with teaching Ron to throw, Rowan grasps a hold of little Ginny’s hand, and the said girl blushes behind her ears. The two of walk around the perimeter, casually, in no rush, and sometimes stop to admire some pretty flowers.</p>
<p>Barnaby had made his way to the very top of the Burrow, nestled near attic as he listens to the resident ghost howl and cry. His interest shifts from the closed door to Percy Weasley, curiously watching him with an expression that clearly says ‘<em>Are you mad?</em>’, but once he notes Barnaby’s dull stare the younger boy quickly scurries into his room and locks the door behind him. Lost in thought, Barnaby knocks on the attic. The ghost falls silent. A heavy thump echoes from the other side and Barnaby blinks, “<em>Hello</em>? Anyone in there? If you say yes, then I’ll know you are.” While he gets no verbal response, something crashes and wailing follows. Stilled by suspense, he continues to eagerly listen.</p>
<p>You are lounging outside, watching the rye sway as scents of dirt, flowers, and cooking tint the air. Cool wind blows past you, tickling the back of your neck and playing with the strands of your (colour) hair. Your lungs expand with oxygen as you take in a deep breath. <em>Relaxing</em>. Grass pickles your palms and bare legs. You bathe in sunlight. The summer heat collects oils on your skin.</p>
<p>Your eyes shut for a moment. You hope to get a tan. Distant screams of Tonks and the twins greet your ears, that and Bill’s cursing, possibly sniffles from Ronald but you aren’t too sure. You ignore the commotion and let yourself drift away, the noise now a pleasant buzz mixing with chirps and crickets. Before long you feel a presence and soon the grass next to you crunches as someone sits down. You recognise who it is immediately, without having to open your eyes. The earthy scent mixed with ginger makes your heart skip a beat. You tilt your head, grass grazing your cheek as you do, and smile at Charlie. Your eyes fluff open and you are fully prepared to see him grinning, but you note his grim expression and then your eyes catch at his once long hair and you promptly sit up.</p>
<p>“<em>Bloody hell</em>, Charlie…” You murmur, your fingers coming to gently touch his now short locks. He doesn’t pull away – frankly, he does not move at all, simply regards you in quiet sadness. Your hand falls before it can reach him. “I guess your mum wasn’t joking when she said <em>enjoy it while it lasts</em>…” you mumble with a soft frown knitting your brows, trying to ease him with a tender smile but it hardly works. Desperate and not wanting him to feel down any longer, your fingers grasp a hold of his wrist and his blue eyes flicker to you, “I think you still look dashing.” You admit, and he blushes behind his freckles.</p>
<p>“…Thank you, (Name). Means a lot…<em>Really</em>.” You are pleased with his answer and you hardly contain it.</p>
<p>“<em>Oi</em>! (Name)—“ Tonks yells, right behind you. The two of you snap your head to her, “<em>Woah</em>!” Her eyes land on Charlie, “The <em>hell</em> happened? What’s with the hairdo? Got tired of brushing every morning?” She falls silent, thoughtful, “I get you…I do. Did the same thing, too.” She finishes with a grin, falling to her knees right in front of you. Her hand lands on yours, “Anyway, (Name), you should’ve seen what me and the twins did! We took this invention of Tulip’s and—“</p>
<p>“Blimey, is that smoke?” Charlie mumbles. You blink. The air tints with the smell of burning wood.</p>
<p>“<em>Oh no</em>.”</p>
<p>“Oh <em>yes</em>!…Wait, why are you panicking?!”</p>
<p>000</p>
<p>Tulip’s invention turned out to be a fake fire charm that lit anything it touched in flames, but never actually harmed. The prank was intended to scare Ronald to death, and it had worked, and the twins were snickered as Bill tried to calm down the poor boy. A crisis was avoided. Charlie’s new haircut was greeted with light mocking and acceptance.</p>
<p>“It looks lovely, Charlie.” Rowan had reassured.</p>
<p>“Oh, well now you really <em>are</em> copying our style.” One twin whined.</p>
<p>“Well said, George.”</p>
<p>But you had wandered away from the commotion and joined Barnaby on the staircase. Charlie thinks he even saw the two of you hugging, giggling, <em>bonding</em>. That did not sit well with him, and once Ronald stopped crying and mum took him away to play inside with Ginny and Rowan, he approached Bill worriedly.</p>
<p>“Hey, now that you can’t wear a pony-tail, mind if I steal your look?” Bill asks, deep in thought, “Having my hair loose is tougher than it looks.”</p>
<p>“<em>Bill</em>.” Charlie calls him, a bit impatient, “Can I…talk to you?”</p>
<p>Bill gives him a look, “Aren’t you already?”</p>
<p>“It’s about (Name).”</p>
<p>“No, <em>really</em>? I’m stunned. The only thing you ever talk about is (<em>Name</em>). And dragons…More of (Name) these days, though.”</p>
<p>“I think she likes someone else.” Charlie admits. Bill’s playful demeanour falls.</p>
<p>“And why do you think so?”</p>
<p>“I saw her. And Barnaby. They were…<em>hugging</em>.”</p>
<p>Bill wanted to tease him. He really <em>really</em> did, but seeing Charlie so defeated and distraught made him reconsider. His little brother is asking him for advice and he must be responsible and caring. He will tease him at a different time, he is sure there will be plenty of opportunities to do so, “Barnaby is a good lad.” Bill says after a while, and Charlie’s shoulders slump, “<em>But</em>…I don’t think (Name) fancies him. They are <em>good friends</em>, mind you, but between you and me? Rowan mentioned (Name) having a crush. And it’s <em>not</em> Barnaby.”</p>
<p>“Who is it, then?” Charlie questions, “If it’s Penny I don’t stand a chance.”</p>
<p>“No one stands a chance against Penny, but it’s not her, either.”</p>
<p>“Then who?”</p>
<p>“Blimey, Charlie, get a hold of yourself and ask her. It’s still the same (Name) that spilled ink on your robes in History.”</p>
<p>“<em>What</em>?” Charlie frowns, “<em>No</em>. No it’s <em>not</em>. She’s <em>three</em> years older now.”</p>
<p>“Just go and talk to her before I do.”</p>
<p>Charlie narrows his eyes at Bill, “<em>You wouldn’t</em>.”</p>
<p>“Try me, Romeo.”</p>
<p>000</p>
<p>Late night. The sky is inky black and stars like glass shards glimmer outside the open window. Dim oil lamps light up the small interior of Bill and Charlie’s room. Tonks is nestled into her sleeping bag, on the ground, next to Rowan and Barnaby as the trio snore, long asleep. Bill sits on his bed, his face blushed from the heat, as he shows another picture of baby-Charlie – in this one he has pigtails. You slap a hand over your mouth, eyes twinkling with silent laughter as you admire the picture and glance at the teen Charlie sitting beside you, close enough that your shoulders brush, as he looks at the photograph with a mixture of mortification and amusement.</p>
<p>“Did you braid them?” You ask Bill quietly. He grins proudly.</p>
<p>“I dressed him, too.” He points out, “Embroiled a dragon on all of his clothes. He would cry unless I did.”</p>
<p>“No I wouldn’t.” Charlie mumbles. You have a hard time believing him.</p>
<p>Bill rolls his eyes, “That and a—“</p>
<p>“-<em>Niffler</em>.” You finish for him, giving the picture back with a small smile, “I know. It’s his second favourite.”</p>
<p>“You remember that?” Charlie blinks stupidly.</p>
<p>You nod, “<em>Of course</em> I do. You told me during Care of Magical Creatures. Don’t <em>you</em> remember?”</p>
<p>“I do, it’s just that I figured you wouldn’t…”</p>
<p>“Why did you figure that?”</p>
<p>“Is it just me or am in <em>desperate</em> need of some pumpkin juice <em>at this very moment?” </em>Bill intervenes not-so-subtly, standing up, “I’ll be right back, but not <em>right</em> back, you know? Need anything from the kitchen? It’s quite <em>far</em> away so sorry but the journey will be <em>tremendously long</em>.” He doesn’t exactly wait for either of you to answer as he skilfully avoids the sleeping human obstacles and heads out the door, it clicking shut a moment later.</p>
<p>Silence. Crickets chirp from outside and Bill’s dull footsteps echo downwards.</p>
<p>“Should I question it?”</p>
<p>“<em>Nope</em>.” Charlie sighs, “Just ignore him. It’s best for all this way, really.”</p>
<p>“…Well, <em>anyway</em>…” You start, unsure, “I just…I wanted to thank you.” You say, a shy smile pinching your cheeks. Idly, you pull a stand of your hair behind your ear, “For inviting us to stay over.”</p>
<p>“<em>Oh</em>…” Charlie blushes under the warm light, “Oh, it’s nothing, really. It was Bill’s idea.”</p>
<p>“That’s not what Bill said.”</p>
<p>“It was my idea.”</p>
<p>“That’s more like it. Well, either way. <em>Thank you</em>. It’s been…a <em>fun</em> day.” You admit, “I was hoping that…We could play Quidditch tomorrow?” You ask, hopefully. Charlie grins.</p>
<p>“Sure. Of course. You never played before, have you? That’s fine, I can teach you. Or Bill can. But I can, too.”</p>
<p>“You teaching me is fine.” You say, “Later we can have a friendly match. <em>You and I versus Tonks and Bill</em>. Rowan and Barnaby can be the judges.”</p>
<p>“Sounds brilliant to me.” He agrees, eagerly.</p>
<p>Unbeknownst to either of you, you had been leaning into one another, some force like a magnet pulling you close. Before he knows what he is doing, his fingers graze the side of your cheek, a sheepish smile on his lips, as you blink your lashes in the cute way you do. He feels your breath on his lips and promptly snaps awake. Embarrassed and awkward he jerks away, and you do, too, scooting a bit further as to not invade his personal bubble anymore. Clearing your throat, you slip onto the ground and inside your sleeping bag, one you promised to share with Tonks, as you murmur, “<em>Goodnight</em>, Charlie.”</p>
<p>Still unable to look at you, he watches the ceiling, counting dust particles as they helplessly fall, “…<em>Night</em>, (Name).”</p>
<p><em>Merlin</em>, and there is still a whole week left of your stay! If this is the start of the holiday, how will it end?!</p>
