    <p align="center">                 </p><p>Smoke billows from the gaping hole blown into the side of a dilapidated block of flats. Residents crowd outside as sirens blare in the distance, still several street corners down.</p><p>The air surrounding the complex is oppressive on Harry’s lungs when he arrives on the scene. Not wasting any time, Harry searches out for sparks of life and, upon pinpointing three weak pulses, rushes inside.</p><p>Two of the victims that he locates are out cold; he hauls them from the building first. The last one clings to consciousness and Harry’s suit as Harry drags him over the threshold and onto the pavement. His sand-colored hair is matted with blood, and coughs rattle his frame when he tells Harry the situation was originally a kidnapping.</p><p>Three minutes after Harry has pulled the last victim from the burning complex, the police and paramedics show up.</p><p>Relief flooding him, Harry gets out of the way of the medical professionals as they surround the victims. </p><p>But the hand of one of the cops landing heavily on Harry’s shoulder and his dismissive “We’ll handle it from here” causes Harry to straighten. The tightening of the man’s grip after the unwitting zap he gets for touching Harry when he’s unaware sets Harry’s teeth on edge. “We’ll also have to ask you some questions, of course.”</p><p>It’s said casually enough that Harry has no doubt he’s their prime suspect. “Of course.” He pauses for a long, drawn-out moment. “Sir.”</p><p>He tells them he arrived after the explosion, rescued the remaining victims, and saw little else in the debris and smoke. Aside from the brief tidbit the injured teenager gave Harry, he has nothing else to provide the police.</p><p>Unhappy with the scant information and believing Harry knows more, the cop continues interrogating him.</p><p>Part of what grates on Harry about his interactions with constabulary while wearing his suit—a clear indicator to all who see him of his hero status—is the disregard and dismissal his law enforcement counterparts display for him. Although, he knows run-ins could turn much worse.</p><p>While Harry has been divulging what little he knows of the situation to the one officer, the other one has been asking the teenager more questions whilst a paramedic attends to his head injury.</p><p>According to the witness, not everyone in the hostage group made it out. Dead bodies are still inside.</p><p>Harry only finds out about that, though, because the officer shouts it to the cop interrogating Harry before dashing inside the building with night stick raised.</p><p>The policeman with Harry darts him an accusatory glance, but Harry ignores it. His powers had detected the electrical currents present around the bodies of people still alive. With the smoke being as thick as it was and dead bodies producing no energy output, there was no way for Harry to have known more people were inside. Maybe if he’d only argued with the boat lady from earlier for five seconds instead of five minutes . . . .</p><p>He makes a move to head inside the building when an arm jolts out in front of him.</p><p>“Oi! Easy there, bovver boy. You’ve done what you’ve done. Now, it’s in the law’s hands.” The man’s mouth doesn’t say “bugger off now,” but the tilt of his head and the jut of his chin certainly does.</p><p>Since <em>Harry </em>is the one who arrived on the scene first, saved the people still alive, and fully cooperated with the officer’s demands for information, he’s at least due for some attempt at being treated as an equal. His teeth grind together. It’s his case too. He deserves to learn what happened to the people he’d been unable to save.</p><p>However, the glint in the officer’s eyes also says to consider himself lucky he isn’t being stuffed in the back of the police car, so Harry drops it.</p><p>Frustrating as hell, but that’s just how Harry’s night’s been going.</p><p>From the start of his patrol at 6:00 pm to the current time of 9:00 pm, Harry’s been run ragged.</p><p>It began decently enough, sure. He stopped the tube from derailing by short-circuiting its internal wiring and pulled a bloke back from being run over by a passing trolley car.</p><p>Next came the robbery around 6:30, where there was a holdup in some business place or other. Harry didn’t really have time to register a name on the sign being flung at him by some gravity controlling crook. He got a tear in his suit for that, the top of his thigh bleeding ever so slightly into the surrounding fabric. </p><p>7:00 pm was the boat theft a little old lady decided to hound him about for a quarter of an hour that seemed to stretch into six. Stolen right from off her lawn. Family heirloom at that—apparently passed down several generations. She also explained to him that he “should get right on the case like any beneficial hero worth the air he breathes” would.</p><p>And he was ‘getting on it’ when the explosion from outside the West End shopping district of London shook the very street he stood upon at precisely 7:30 pm. After making his excuses to the <em>delightful </em>old woman, who wouldn’t accept them for an entire five minutes, Harry reached the scene of what wound up being the kidnapping-turned-murder around 7:45 pm.</p><p>Reflecting on the frustrations from the whole evening as he leaves the burning flats to the authorities, Harry feels irritation coursing in his veins alongside his electricity.</p><p>Harry loves being a superhero. He enjoys saving people in wreckages, rescuing cats stuck in trees, and defeating evil. The joy on the faces of the people he helps are worth whatever comes beforehand, or even after. But as Big Ben chimes for nine o’clock, Harry can’t wait to head home.</p><p>Just one more circuit around the last section of London, and he might make it home by ten to eat Mrs. Weasley’s delicious cooking. Sure, it’s a little early for him on a Friday when crime’s busiest, and he doesn’t have to worry about waking up the next day with assignments due for classes. But he wouldn’t mind having a soak in the tub for his sore thigh—after all, a guy working this hard has got to treat himself right sometime.</p><p>Thoughts of a bubble-bath surrounded by cinnamon-scented candles after dinner dash from Harry’s mind when he catches the glint of a familiar-looking mask out of the corner of his eye. He immediately jumps down from the rooftop—taking some unfortunate shingles with him—and into the shadows cast by the darkened building.</p><p>Taking a breath, Harry works to calm the adrenaline rush so that he can properly power down. Sneaking around while being lit up by his power would be like tailing someone with headlights on.</p><p>Once he grows calm enough that his skin and hair stop sparking, and the jagged lines on the body of his suit that follow the pattern of the scars that lay underneath cease glowing, Harry creeps out from behind the building. He sneaks across the empty street until the ditch where he’d seen the flash of white comes back into view. At this point, he’s approaching on his hands and knees, forcing away thoughts of what the police could accuse him of now if they ever catch him like this.</p><p>Finally, he reaches the edge of the ditch. Stomach pressed flat to the earth and body tense, he gingerly peeks over the bank.</p><p>The first thing that he sees is the white dragon skull mask, visible like a beacon in the moonlight. He has to strain his eyes to make out the form clad in black sprawled out in the ditch. But when he does, he jolts to his feet and powers up again in a flash. Lightning dances on his fingertips as he prepares for an attack that never comes.</p><p>Apparently, Paper Dracon is unconscious.</p><p>Still, Harry lowers his hand cautiously until it’s at his side. He tilts his head and walks around the ditch for a better angle.</p><p>Paper Dracon is lying on his back with his left leg splayed far out—while his right bends his heel toward his body. His right arm stretches above his head as though reaching out for the dragon skull mask several meters away, but the hand stays limp. His left arm remains on his chest, hand twisted in the black fabric over his heart—which Harry hopes still beats.</p><p>Patches of what Harry assumes must be skin peek out from multiple tears throughout the costume, noticeable from this distance only for the sharp pale contrast they provide to the surrounding darkness. His long, black trench coat fans out under him like a cape. Little white shreds decorate the ground where any of Paper Dracon’s numerous pockets have also torn.</p><p>The villain’s face is turned slightly towards the arm reaching out, so Harry can see that the black under-mask he wears is as severely damaged as the rest of his suit. Normally, the under-mask functions as a generic coverall. All the Villain Agency members wear them. They cover the entire head like a ski mask with no mouth hole and the eye holes done up with white fabric. Harry remembers calling him Venom the first time he saw it, and Paper Dracon sputtering comically before sending a particularly nasty barrage of attacks at Harry. Since then, Harry has learned that Paper Dracon wears the dragon skull face mask for identification.</p><p>But now, the mutilation the mask has suffered threatens the identity of its wearer; one of the white eye patches is completely gone, and a long gash slices diagonally through the fabric covering Dracon’s cheek. It’s barely noticeable with the dark red blood encrusting it. There’s even a large enough tear at the top of his head that a tuft of hair threatens to bust through. But it also must be matted with blood for it to stay in place with the wind snatching at the loose fabric ends.</p><p>With care, Harry lifts his hand in the direction of Paper Dracon, closes his eyes, and feels for any energy radiating from the body like he did earlier at the explosion site. A light crackling pulse answers him, fainter than he’d like, but present nonetheless.</p><p>Opening his eyes once again, Harry sits down cross-legged and considers the prone body.</p><p>His villainous rival needs medical attention, no doubt about that. This would be Harry’s prime opportunity to finally put the wanted criminal behind bars if he was certain the police would provide him with the necessary treatment.</p><p>If Harry were to take him to the hospital, Dracon would get treated—however, the guy would no doubt be arrested the second he regains consciousness. As much as Harry wants the villain to face justice, he also has plenty of questions crowding his mind. And Harry doesn’t doubt for a second—especially considering the most recent incident—that law enforcement would not make him privy to any of their interviews with Paper Dracon.</p><p>Harry sighs. <em>What happened to you, Paper Dracon?</em></p><p>There’s the other option of waking him up and just asking, but Harry suspects that whatever caused the severe injuries Paper Dracon’s sporting would have him on edge. Waking up to see a hero he hated would just serve as icing on whatever shit cake Dracon’s already eaten. He'd probably attack Harry on sight and agitate his wounds in the process.</p><p>Taking him back to the Weasley household is out of the question. His friends and partners would never forgive Harry for unwittingly revealing the location of their base to a villain in the Agency’s pocket.</p><p>But Harry couldn’t just leave him out here to succumb to his wounds and still call himself a hero. Villain or not, pain-in-the-arse or not, Paper Dracon needs help.</p><p>Unfortunately for Harry, he’s the only hero on call tonight for this section of London.</p><p>While debating what to do, Harry’s eyes become unwittingly drawn back to the top of the mask where the frayed edges of the torn material keep catching in the light breeze. Without truly thinking it over, Harry imagines grabbing at the flicking end and just . . . pulling the mask away.</p><p>His heartbeat spikes, and his breath catches in his throat as he envisions finally seeing the face attached to the voice that’s antagonized him for so long. But then his traitorous mind pictures the opposite—a situation where Harry’s the one lying defenseless on the ground, and Dracon’s lifting Harry’s mask away.</p><p>He has to grip his elbows and hunch over from the chill breeze suddenly cutting right through him.</p><p><em>Okay, so none of that, then</em>.</p><p>Even when he calms himself enough to uncurl, Harry’s fingers still shake. Before looking at the body again, he delicately stuffs his hands under his thighs.</p><p>In the distance, he hears Big Ben chiming ten o’clock and, cursing below his breath, wonders how long he’s sat here deliberating. As the night wears on, the temperature will only continue to drop, and then it won’t matter what Harry does with the corpse.</p><p>Reluctantly, he removes one hand from beneath his leg and is satisfied to find it steady. No point now in waiting for the villain to come to his senses on his own, not if he wants to remain part of the living. Harry considers his options before directing his hand in Paper Dracon’s direction. Closing his eyes, he feels out for the electrical pull he’d sensed earlier and startles when finding it even fainter than before. <em>Shit</em>.</p><p>Harry takes a breath and focuses on the energy field surrounding the body, rather than the one circulating through it, and speeds it up a small fraction—</p><p>Paper Dracon gasps, his back arching off the ground. Then he starts wheezing and coughing as though choking on blood. For all Harry knows of the extent of his injuries, he very well might be.</p><p>Still uncertain as to how Dracon would react when he finally sees Harry, he decides to power down again so as to appear as innocuous as possible.</p><p>Groaning, Paper Dracon rolls over and struggles to his hands and knees. He goes to lift his mask up—probably to spit out whatever blood’s collected in his mouth—when his head suddenly whips around to face Harry. “Motherfucker.”</p><p>That startles a snort from Harry, and he feels himself power up to respond. “Hullo to you too.”</p><p>Dracon remains frozen.</p><p>Harry wonders if it’s because he’s realized how much it hurts to move in his state. He swings his legs out from their crossed position and over the edge of the ditch, idly kicking the dirt with his heels. “Rough night?”</p><p>“Fuck you.”</p><p>“Must be, for you to sound so ineloquent.” Harry wonders how wise it is to be wasting his chance to talk to Paper Dracon by antagonizing him. But that anxious energy’s back and sparking in his veins.</p><p>“At least I don’t sound like Siri,” Paper Dracon says, struggling to his feet.</p><p>Harry frowns and watches Dracon stagger a bit before his legs remain steady under him. “Hey, my voice is much lower pitched than that.”</p><p>In the second it takes for Harry to be swarmed in white, he realizes he should have said something smarter, like <em>how ‘bout we both go to the hospital?</em> He opens his mouth to shout, and a flurry of the stuff flies inside and clings to the back of his throat. Now he’s the one choking, flinging his arms about to swat at the persistent horde around him, only dimly grateful for his mask covering up his nose and lenses shielding his eyes.</p><p>Paper Dracon really must be badly injured if he isn’t wasting energy to mock Harry in that moment.</p><p>Regardless, Harry can feel his suit beginning to give way under the barrage—not to mention the little bits scraping along inside his mouth.</p><p>Gathering his energy to him, he feels it travel faster and stronger from the scar on his forehead down the channels opening up along his body. He can see the light emanating from his suit now on the back of his eyelids; he feels the electrical energy building up to the tips of his fingers.</p><p>He lets the pulse loose.</p><p>Crackling echoes around him as every last bit of whatever Dracon had attacked him with either turns to dust or catches fire. Harry’s eyes shoot open to see the last flurries of paper scraps burn in front of him.</p><p>So, the bastard had attacked him with the ruined bits that had fallen out of his torn pockets. Pretty slick, for a guy who’s half dead on his feet.</p><p>Speaking of him, Paper Dracon had apparently been bending down to pick up his dragon skull face mask when Harry’s blast had knocked him to the ground again. He’s struggling to a kneeling position while Harry hacks out the ash still in his mouth.</p><p>Harry sees Dracon abandon further attempts to stand in favor of crawling towards his discarded outer-mask. <em>Nope</em>. Adrenaline pumping, he bolts forward into the ditch, and his foot catches Dracon’s hand as it closes on the mask.</p><p>Dracon makes a garbled sound and tries to jerk his hand from under Harry’s foot, but he holds it trapped between the mask and his sole.</p><p>“Wha—what the <em>hell </em>was th-<em>ah</em>—at?” Harry’s coughing only infuriates him further.</p><p>Dracon cranes his head up, so Harry assumes the prick’s looking at him. “Which bit?” he asks thinly.</p><p>“Which—! The bit where you suffocated me with confetti!”</p><p>“Oh.”</p><p><em>Oh?</em> Harry suddenly remembers Dracon’s hurt.</p><p>He takes pressure off the hand under his foot, and it gets whisked from underneath him. Replacing his foot atop the mask, Harry watches as the villain cradles the hand close to his chest. Now that he’s this near, Harry can hear the ragged, stuttered breaths coming from the villain.</p><p>“Well . . . now what, <em>hero</em>?” There’s the venom that’s been missing.</p><p>“You need medical attention.”</p><p>A hoarse bark of laughter rips itself from Dracon’s throat. “Really? What was your first clue? Was it all the bloo—”</p><p>He cuts off as Harry crouches down to his level and holds out the mask. It feels thinner in his hand than it does under his foot, and Harry notes a crack that threatens to take off the left horn.</p><p>Almost like he’s afraid Harry will snatch the mask away should he move too fast, Paper Dracon slowly reaches out the hand cradled to his chest. Once Dracon’s fingers delicately wrap around the mask’s edge, he whips it back to himself, fast as any of Harry’s lightning bolts.</p><p>“Great. Now, bugger off.”</p><p>“Hold on,” Harry says as Dracon tries to stand. He unthinkingly grabs the villain’s upper arm when he starts to fall over.</p><p>“Let <em>go</em>!” Dracon rips free and falls anyway.</p><p>“I meant it! You need help.”</p><p>“And where am I gonna get it? You?”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>“I sure hope your day job isn’t as a comedian.”</p><p>Harry frowns, and Dracon sees it.</p><p>“You sure did a bang up job helping me when you blasted me—” he takes a breath that sounds like it hurts “—and stomped my hand.”</p><p>“’Cause you attacked me with your stupid paper!”</p><p>“Not before your first shock!”</p><p>Harry pauses a moment. “That was to wake you up.”</p><p>“Well, I’m awake. Great bloody job.” He scrambles to his feet, his back to Harry. “Now go home, hero.”</p><p>“Not until you get treatment.” Harry notes how Dracon’s back tenses more and wonders when it tensed in the first place.</p><p>When Paper Dracon speaks, the venom’s been replaced by exhaustion. “How about we quit playing around.” He turns to face Harry, dragon skull mask on, and lifts his arms, wrists up and hands clenched. “We both know this’s to arrest me.”</p><p>“I—No. No, I wasn’t going to—” Harry suddenly remembers his plan to appear innocuous. Biting the inside of his cheek, he powers down.</p><p>Dracon’s drawling voice comes from the darkness now bathing them. “Where were you planning on taking me, then?”</p><p><em>Er . . .</em> Harry hadn’t yet figured that out.</p><p>He is still contemplating an answer when his eyes, still adjusting, catch a flash of white as it leaves Dracon’s uncurling right hand. Harry has a moment to shield his head as a giant paper swan catapults into him, knocking him down.                                                                           </p><p><em>Dammit</em>.</p><p>The origami bird’s flapping at him with its wings and pecking at him with a sharp beak. As Harry powers back up to blast the swan, he sees another equally large white shape flying away.</p><p>By the time he strikes the bird and the paper catches fire, Paper Dracon’s long gone.</p><p> </p>
