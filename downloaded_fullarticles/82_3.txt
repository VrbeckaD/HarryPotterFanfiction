    <p>Chapter 1</p><p>“Have all the preparations been made Doctor?” the young man asked as he stood by another dressed in blue with a red cape.<br/>“I’d prefer it you called me Doctor Strange, but yes the preparations have been made. Now all we have to do is invite the guests and awake the guest of honour.” He said in a odd mix of aloofness and lust.<br/>“Come, come now I know the pollen is strong here as per my request but surely one as great as you can withstand it a little longer.” A pleased smile crept along the younger man’s face although it was somewhat hidden along his beard, “Now remember everything needs to flow perfectly, you already handled the processing of this planet surely the rest will be easy.”<br/>“Yes Mr.-”<br/>“Tsk tsk tsk” as the young man shook a finger, “You know better than to mention my name even in the slightest. Remember it was I who helped you with Abraxas and banished him to the far realm singly. Simply call me Sir and there will be no consequences beyond your ken.”<br/>“Yessir, although I must admit some of the local flora and fauna never mind the beasts of this planet may prove to be rather dangerous in the right context.”<br/>“Never fear Doctor Strange, I had taken care of those aspects before even bringing you here. Now without any further ado let us invite our many guests. You were able to locate them am I right is saying this?”<br/>“Yessir, all the guests you ‘invited’ have been located, tracked, and taken care of in terms of their absence from their specific realm and reality. All things that happen here and in their home worlds and realities will proceed as if they were there to begin with. No matter how taxing that is on me.” The Doctor muttered under his breath.<br/>“Now Doctor don’t think my senses are that dull, as I recall this is just me collecting on the many debts you owe me.” As the youth smiled, “or should I pull the contract up?” his eyes glistened in delight at this opportunity to tease, “I must admit it is rather lengthy to say the least and may take lifetimes to ensure that this contract if fulfilled to the fullest let alone to my liking.”<br/>“My sincere apologies Mr.- Sir, it won’t happen again.”<br/>“Well that is good to hear, now let’s invite the guests. I am eager to see what they will do given this… situation.” As the younger man’s eyes lingered towards the Doctors’ crotch, “hmmm seems you’ll need a medication for that. Don’t worry I’m sure you’ll find a solution for it.” As a smile creeped up again.<br/>With that Doctor Strange started weaving his incantations, mustering up the powers of the arcane fabric as the archaic symbols fleeted and danced about his fingers. Slowly portals started opening along the green grassy field below the hillside where the two men stood and with it came all manner of persons and the belongings they had at the time. Some if outlandish apparel whilst others seemed more common and others the Doctor was all too familiar with. Seeing some of them made is heart sink knowing what his “employer” had in mind. Thoughts of what were about to come to pass started flooding into the Sorcerer Supremes’ mind. Tantalizing. Teasing. Fiery feelings and sensations that almost completely distracted him from the task at hand. He could feel his member throb at the thought of what may be. Pulling himself back together he observed the land to make sure that all the persons were invited. However, if he missed a few it would only be a matter of time till his employer reminded him about his mistake and had him rectify the situation. From the looks of it all of them were here. Slightly lulled into a hypnotic sense of awe and curiosity.<br/>“May I take my leave Sir”<br/>“Your work is done for now Doctor Strange, now take care of your personal matters and do not disturb our guest of honour. For if you do, I can only assure you the pains and anguish that would swiftly follow. Now begone.” As the young man dismissed him without a second thought.<br/>Now it was the moment he had been waiting for. Simply put this was all just a way of expressing his love, but in a rather different manner. He knew that she couldn’t resist if she was put into this situation. Hell, he knew that even if she wanted to resist it would be completely impossible. He had studied her for far too long making sure to list all of those whom she had fantasized about in a medley of fanfics over the course of years. All her interests lay before her now. A buffet of possibilities. Just thinking of her in a multiplicity of circumstances caused an erection. Sure, it was great watching her pleasure herself to these previously fictitious characters, even while she thought him asleep as to make her feel like she was pursuing a guilty pleasure. However, it was not always the case as sometimes watching her please herself was just too inviting. He could still feel the soft folds of her pussy as he rubbed his face along it. His lips kissing it up and down. The slick sensation of his tongue mixed with her juices as it danced around her clit the way she liked it made him stiffer than the pollen could have. But enough of that. It was time to address the public.<br/>“Fondest greetings to you all, heroes, wizards, and persons of great renown. It is with my greatest pleasure I introduce to you someone special” and with that the young man showed the multitude a woman.<br/>She was a rare beauty to say the least. From head to toe she radiated it. At least until closely inspected. Then she was the incarnation of lust. From her beautiful brown hair that was parted as to assure you could see her eyes. Eyes at a light blue as if at a midday on the crisp clear ocean on a sunny day. Thin seductive lips that seemed as if without warning or prompt were already whispering sultry sweet nothings and muffled curses as you pleasured her time and time again. She had breasts that although were not a large as her hips were a wonder to behold even though they could only see her cleavage in the dark blue satin dress. Her curvy pear-shaped figure drew various volumes of moans from all those that looked upon her. All that laid eyes upon her wanted her. Their blood boiled with lust for her seeking to pleasure her by and at whatever means. The young man who introduced the masses to her tried to hide his smug look. It was all he had hoped for and perhaps a little more.<br/>“I see you are already wanting of her and believe me when I tell you, you will all have a chance” he paused as the crowd let out moans of pleasure and eagerness, “You see this lady, lets’ call her…Belle. Is here with us asleep now, but she will be awake very soon. Take her image in quick for I cannot display this any longer without you making a mess here” with that the crowd fell silent as they took her in learning every nook and cranny of her before the image faded, “Now, here are some rules. Enjoy your time here and with her. There will be a point system set up for each of  the following categories; how you addressed fucking her whether through permission or not, how many there are of you during this sexual revel, how many times you and her orgasm, and how many times I am present or watching. There is an arranged time but telling you when this contest is over makes it seem pointless. You may team up or work alone I could care less how any of it is done other than you have your way with her and let her have her way with you. As you can already tell the pollen pollutes this entire planet and seeks to bring out all the sexual urges and tensions you may have locked away. The same will be said of Belle, so don’t be surprised if you find her coming on to you. Now sleep.”<br/>And with that the masses fell under the charm the young man had placed upon them. Some hurried and talked one with another before going to a place of lodging. Others rushed into bed filled with a burning urge to wake at sunrise as to pursue their ample prey. While some couldn’t manage themselves properly and were found very sticky and active rubbing themselves off until fatigue settled in and caused them to fall asleep where they stood. Hand in pants for some while others just lay about naked on the grass.<br/>“Seems things went a bit better than planned with the pollen” the Doctor whispered as he took his place back at the young man’s side.<br/>“Indeed, well it seems we will have to transport the rest to unoccupied lodgings and wait for dawn.”<br/>“Do you think this best Sir?”<br/>“I know what I am doing, believe me she will enjoy this just as much as I will.”<br/> </p>
