    <p>Lance rushed to the living area of the castle in excitement.  It had taken them a while, but Pidge had finally developed something strong enough to pick up feed from an earth news channel.</p><p> </p><p>He leaped over the couch, landing by Keith, and grinned as Pidge tinkered with the last of the wires.  Suddenly it came to life.  Lance cheered, but the celebration was cut short when they saw their faces on the screen alongside a stoic and serious woman.</p><p> <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/7d/ce/0d/7dce0d48512d902cbb2edd59b7d93063.png" alt="" width="687" height="715" data-pagespeed-url-hash="2029808044" onload="pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);" data-pagespeed-url-hash="2029808044" onload="pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);"/>(by Februarywhite on tumblr)</p><p>
  <em> “The Garrison still refuses to release information on the whereabouts of the three missing space cadets, one of whom, we have been informed, was the daughter of Colleen Holt, who had lost her son and husband just 6 months prior to the loss of her daughter, another being the grandson of the Prime Minister of Samoa. The Garretts are demanding answers and the shutdown of the space exploration camp.  Another family, the McClains, are demanding to know where their lost son is.  Hailing from Cuba, the McClains are also having to cope with the destruction of Hurricane Irma.  Speaking of this tragic event, Jerry, how are things going on your end?” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>The screen switched to an equally stoic man in the middle of a disaster area. <em> “Thank you, Anna.  As you can see behind me, the damage at Varadero Beach here in Cuba looks like a bombshell went off.  Irma has truly shown her wrath.  Now I stand beside the grandmother of Cadet Lance McClain.  Mrs. McClain?  Can you tell us how you feel in such a situation?” </em></p><p> </p><p>The camera focused on an elderly woman. <em> “I feel like mother nature is taking her revenge. I feel it is justified.  You can't predict mother nature's mood.  But I feel rage for the disappearance of my nieto and his friends.  They should be ashamed of themselves for losing not only the Holts and Shirogane, but for losing my nieto and his friends.” </em> She turned to the <em> “Lance, if you are watching this, stay safe and come home as soon as possible.  As for the survivors of Irma, I have fresh water and plenty of room at my house, seeing as it’s the only one standing.” </em></p><p> </p><p>They all turned to Lance, whose skin was ashen and eyes wide and watery.  They knew he was the one who missed home more than anything.</p><p> </p><p>He stood, without saying a word, and headed for the hangar.  They followed him, making sure he didn't rush off into space.  What surprised them was Lance going into Blue.  The particle barrier came down, denying them access to Blue, as well as her Paladin.  All four looked at each other and silently agreed to let him have his moment.</p><p><br/> </p><p>A moment turned into a day, a day turned into two days, and by the third day they were starting to worry about him.  They all tried coaxing him out of his lion.  He wouldn't come out.  Finally Keith had had enough. He walked up and looked at Blue.</p><p> </p><p>“Let me in… Please, I just want to help.”</p><p> </p><p>After a long pause, she finally lowered her head and barrier and let him enter the cockpit.</p><p> </p><p>Keith saw discarded water packets and was relieved to find that Lance had been hydrated, at the very least.  Lance sat huddled in his chair, his long legs pulled up to his chest and his head buried in his knees.</p><p> </p><p>Keith frowned, not liking the sight in front of him.  He picked Lance up, throwing him over his shoulder, earning a surprised squeak.</p><p> </p><p>“Put me down, Keith!” Lance shrieked.  When he got no reply, he did the first thing to come to mind.</p><p> </p><p>Keith yelped, almost dropping Lance in the process. “Did you?  DID YOU JUST <em> BITE </em> MY <em> ASS?!” </em>he demanded, only for Lance to start laughing.  Keith felt himself flush to the hairline.  He immediately dropped Lance, who took off down the hallway. Keith growled and gave chase.</p><p> </p><p>“GET BACK HERE MCCLAIN!” Keith screeched, to which he was answered with a “NEVER, MULLET!”</p><p><br/> </p><p>Lance slid under the couch. It was cramped, having very little space between it and the floor. He stifled his laughter in order to keep quiet.</p><p> </p><p>Then he saw the white boots. “Hey, Shiro, did Lance pass through here?” Shit, Lance hadn't seen Shiro.  He begged whatever higher powers that might be listening that the older man wouldn't say anything.</p><p> </p><p>“What did he do?” Shiro asked, amusement in his voice.</p><p> </p><p>Keith gave a frustrated sigh. “I finally got Blue to let me in.  I tried to get him to talk, but he just sat there, so I picked him up and carried him out over my shoulder.  Well, he demands I let him down, and obviously I don't listen-”</p><p> </p><p>”Because you're too busy groping his thighs.”</p><p> </p><p>“Shut up!  Well, anyway.  He <em> bites </em> my <em> ass! </em>” There's a pause before Shiro is laughing, a deep belly busting laugh. “It's not funny!  His teeth hurt!”</p><p> </p><p>That just makes Shiro laugh harder. “I thought you were a masochist?”</p><p> </p><p>Oh?  Now <em> that </em> is information Lance can use.</p><p> </p><p>“Shut up!  I was drunk on nunvil when I told you that!  You said you would forget about it!” he can't think of an actual comeback and Lance watches those boots stomp out of the living room.</p><p> </p><p>“You can come out now Lance,” Shiro says, and Lance wiggles out from under the couch.  Shiro let out a long-suffering sigh. “Why... Of all things... Did you bite him... On the ass?” Shiro asked slowly, an eyebrow raised.</p><p> </p><p>Lance just shrugs. “It was there in my face, all juicy and round... What was I supposed to do?”</p><p> </p><p>Shiro just smacked himself on the forehead with a groan.  Hearing the commotion, Keith peeked into the common room and immediately charged at Lance upon seeing him.  Shiro watched Lance take off with Keith hot on his heels.  At least things were back to normal.</p>
