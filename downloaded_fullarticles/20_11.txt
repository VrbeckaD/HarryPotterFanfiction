    <p><span>Hermione sat at the table with all of her favorite people. The war was over a year ago, most of them still healing and recovering. The letters before them were expected but unwanted. It had been rumored for the last few months this would pass, but they honestly thought more of the Wizengamot would vote against it. Obviously, not. </span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><br/>
<em><span>Official Decree from the ministry. </span></em><em><span><br/>
</span></em><em><span><br/>
</span></em> <em><span>We are informing you of the marriage law that affects witches and wizards of childbearing years between the ages of eighteen and thirty-five. This law states: witches and wizards between those ages are to be married within three months to their magically matched partner and to have two children within the first five-years, given there are no complications. The Ministry of Magic has gone through great lengths to ensure a perfect match. Each of you will receive another letter with individual appointment times that you are to adhere to. This is to determine if you are ineligible. Anyone that tries to falsify these tests will find themselves locked in Azkaban. Should you choose not to follow the new law, you may take leave into the Muggle world, without your wand. </span></em></p><p>
  <em>
    <span>The Minister for Magic,</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Kingsley Shacklebolt.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“So what are we going to do about this?” Molly asked. “We can’t just marry all our babies off in the next three months. This is preposterous! We fought a war, just to be told what to do!” </span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>“Mum, there isn’t a thing we can do. They will snap our wands. What I’m wondering is if I could just get married before my match comes out? Me and Angie are perfectly happy.” George wondered. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione remained silent while the Weasley family spoke over each other trying to create loopholes. It was only when Harry cleared his throat that she looked up. With a raise of his eyebrows, he expected her to come clean. She nodded and Harry spoke up to get everyone's attention before looking directly at her.</span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>“Everything you’re thinking of isn’t going to work. The ministry already has who is and is not married, if you’re all of a sudden married, they will snap your wand. They will match you with your perfect person. The one that will compliment you in the best of all ways.” She said.</span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>“How can you be so sure Hermione?” Ron asked.</span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>“Because I was the one to create it.”  </span>
</p>
<hr/><p>
  <span>Draco was lying in his bed staring at the letter. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Well so much for a nice pureblood wife. The ministry will set me up with a half-blood or muggle-born. What will my father say when he hears of this?</span>
  </em>
  <span> Draco sighed. He felt more relief than he should have. He didn’t want to marry a pureblood, otherwise, he already would have. Draco knew he should go speak with his mother and let her know about the bad news, but he was basking in the silence for just a bit longer. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Narcissa Malfoy had been making the most of her time on house arrest. She was pardoned of all charges, but they still wanted to punish her in some way for being involved. Lucious received life in Azkaban, while Draco was cleared of most charges. He was only sentenced to six months of house arrest, mandatory anonymous charity donations, and was to seek counseling. </span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>Draco walked into the small dining room, where his mother was already seated for breakfast. He eloquently sat in the seat across from her, taking his napkin and placing it onto his lap. He then addressed his mother, as he was taught his entire life. </span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>“Morning mother. What are your plans for this day?” </span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>“I plan to continue monitoring the construction of the drawing-room and I wish to paint this room a lighter color. Any objections?” </span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>“None at all. How is the construction going?” </span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>“Ahead of schedule. I am pleased to say it will be unrecognizable when it is finished. What is it that you plan to do with your day, my son.”</span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>“I plan to make my way to the Ministry. It seems they’ve had a new law come about that I’m not terribly fond of.” When his mother looked at him in question, he pulled the letter out of his pocket and handed it to her. Watching her eyes read back and forth, it was the small tells that gave him any insight into what she was thinking. </span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>“Well. This isn’t entirely unexpected. They forced us to do this during the last war and it was revoked after our numbers had gone back up. That’s why the Weasleys have seven children.”</span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>“Was there a two-child rule back then as well?” </span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>“Yes, but we were given the privilege to marry who we pleased, which as you know, for us purebloods, makes it harder for us to carry more than one child. I wouldn’t fight it though Draco. A magical match, surely you’ll receive a pureblood. No other blood mixes with that.” </span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
</p>
<hr/><p><span><br/>
</span><span>A week had passed and letters were arriving with their appointment times. The ministry had received a lot of backlash from the letters but ensured everyone that the magic that matched their partners was unflawed. As per an agreement set up with the Ministry, unless Hermione told them, no one was to know it was her who created it. When they approached her six months ago, they told her about the law that was going to pass and how it had passed last time. This set her mind to work on creating a way that would ensure a perfect marriage. While she loved Ron and would undoubtedly marry him to save each other, she knew, they were not a perfect match and would not have a happy marriage. He had agreed. Their ideas of marriage were vastly different. She wanted to work, he wanted a stay at home wife. She wanted two children, he wanted a flock of them. Hermione was just not able to sacrifice her need to work or they might have been able to come up with a compromise.</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span>A memo flew into her office and laid itself before her. Glancing down, she cringed. It was time.<br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span><span><br/>
</span> <em><span>Hermione Granger,<br/>
</span></em><em><span><br/>
</span></em> <em><span>You are to be at St. Mungos to meet with Healer Davies tomorrow at five in the evening regarding the marriage law. </span></em><em><span><br/>
</span></em> <em><span>Your Minister, </span></em></p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Kingsley Shacklebolt</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>That must mean her match has been found. She was tempted to contact him and ask who it was but knew better of it. Before they would reveal her match, they had to be sure she was fertile to have children. With the continued curses from Bellatrix, she wasn’t sure if she’d actually even be able to have children. With a sigh, she checked the time to see if it was time for lunch. Getting up she left the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures to make her way to the sandwich shop to meet Harry. </span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>“You alright?” Harry asked when he saw her. She hugged him and they ordered their food. Taking their sandwiches and crisps to the table, Harry let her know his appointment had been scheduled for three that afternoon. </span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>“So you’ve been matched then?” </span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>“Yea, well wasn’t it obvious that I would be one of the first they’d want to be matched? I already found out who it is, and I couldn’t be happier.” </span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>“Oh? Who?” </span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>“Ginny.” Harry smiled. “I also, uh, happened to see who you were matched up with if you’d like to know.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione’s eyebrows rose. “Well, I suppose it wouldn’t hurt. If I’m not fertile they’ll never know, right? Unless they peak of course.” </span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>Harry looked at her in confusion so she explained what she had read in terms of the cruciatus curse and its potential effects of being able to have children. Harry was shocked but understood. He knew there would be many people who had been hurt, tortured or cursed at that were all thinking the same thing. </span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>“Well, I’m not sure what you’d prefer then. Your match is Malfoy.” </span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>“Ha. ha. Harry.” Hermione rolled her eyes. When she noticed Harry hadn’t changed faces, or laughed with her, she realized, it was the truth. “You’re bloody joking? Malfoy? He’s my perfect match? I must have done something wrong in the calculations. There’s no bloody way! He’s a pureblood and I certainly am not. Someone must have rigged it.”</span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>“Hermione. Your calculations are flawless. I watched you work hard on this for six months. Malfoy was always your second in school. He always sparred with you. It certainly makes sense. Someone intellectual who can keep up with you.” </span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>Hermione covered her face in her hands and wrapped up her sandwich. She couldn’t stomach it at that point. How in the world were she and Malfoy supposed to get along well enough to procreate? She would have to hope that she wasn’t fertile. She would adopt. Yes. Adoption was her answer. There were plenty of orphan children due to the war. She would adopt. </span>
</p><p>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>“And you’re just okay with this?” </span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>“Well, I wasn’t at first. But I asked Kingsley about it and he also said he was shocked. He affirmed you’d have the necessary protection and they were just waiting on the results of your test. Malfoy’s not a bad guy, Hermione, you know that. Anyway, it’s time to head back. Try to eat that later would you?” Harry said as he stood and left the shop.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hermione would just have to wait until tomorrow. She’d either be told she’d never be able to have children, or she’d be marrying Malfoy. She would either be adopting a child, or she would be seeking protection. Harry was right, Malfoy wasn’t a bad person. But with a muggle-born wife? She knew the Malfoy’s had a tendency to make things disappear. Would she be one of them?</span>
</p>
<hr/><p>
  <span>Draco climbed out of bed at half-past three. He’d never missed two meals before. He felt like he had been beaten to a pulp. He hadn’t had a growth spurt in a couple of years, but he felt in his bones, this would be his final one. Cracking every joint in his body, he needed to grab a bite to eat before his appointment. He’d been matched. Not a surprise really, he’d be matched with a nice little pureblood, have his heir, and life would go on. A loveless marriage. Maybe he’d grow to love his match. He doubted it though. He despised all of the pureblood women. They were greedy toddlers. Sighing to himself, at ten to five, he apparated to St. Mungos. </span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>He arrived outside of Purge and Dowse Ltd. Leaning forward, he opened his mouth, only to smell something sweet. He leaned back, looking around. Draco didn’t spy any flowers, the building was as it always had been. The closed for refurbishment sign still in place, the chipped dummies with wigs still in the window. It still looked shabby. Shaking his head, the sweet smell taking over his senses, his whispered “Wotcher, I’m here to see Healer McClivert.”</span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>The dummy faintly nodded and he walked through the glass to a large reception area. Walking through the hustle and bustle of people, up to the welcome witch, he smelled the sweet scent again. It was like a trail he was following. </span>
  <em>
    <span>It must be a perfume, </span>
  </em>
  <span>he thought. Being advised to the sixth floor, a floor they added for the purpose of the marriage law. </span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>The scent was getting stronger as he approached the sixth floor. Walking in, the only other person was Granger, but the scent was overwhelming. He nodded in her direction to greet her, not missing how her cheeks pinkened slightly. Picking up a Witch Weekly Magazine, he tried to breathe through his mouth. It was like her perfume was calling to him. Distractedly, he tried to figure out what her perfume was while aimlessly turning the pages to make it look like his mind wasn’t on her. Was it strawberries from a strawberry field? No, that wasn’t quite right. The more he inhaled, the more the scent seemed to change, like a fire. Draco pulled his eyebrows together trying to recall all the perfumes from Diagon Alley, but none of them smelled like this.</span>
  <em>
    <span> It must be a muggle perfume. </span>
  </em>
  <span>Hearing Hermione called into the other healer’s office, he had to know. </span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>“Granger,” He started, clearing his throat. “What fragrance are you wearing?” He almost retracted his question from the look of confusion on her face. </span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>“I’m not wearing any.” She said before walking into the appointment. </span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
</p>
<hr/><p>
  <span>Hermione walked into Healer Davies office full of emotions. When Malfoy first walked in, it was like a hit to the gut. This was the first time she had seen him since his trial a year ago. He had filled out, was much taller and more attractive than she remembered and he smelled </span>
  <em>
    <span>DIVINE. </span>
  </em>
  <span>Like parchment, grass and the forest. She was sure it was just her mind getting ready for their upcoming nuptials. Making him look more attractive than she remembered. She hadn’t expected to see him until their letters were sent and he was busting down the minister’s door fighting against their marriage. </span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>After talking to Harry, Hermione had researched everything Malfoy had done over the last year. She found that even though his probation was only for six months, he had continued to support causes anonymously and continued on in his therapy until about a month ago. She also found he supported other causes that weren’t something she expected to see Malfoy galleons at, and had purchased a property in Wiltshire. Hermione looked through the Daily Prophet for dates he had gone on over the last year, but either he dated secretly or hadn’t dated in a year. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He only spoke as she was called in and his question confused her. She hadn’t been wearing perfume, but his comment didn’t sound as though she smelled awful. Shaking her head, she smiled at her healer and tried to cool herself down. It was warm in the office and she had important things to discuss.</span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>Healer Davies did the diagnostic after she laid down on the bed. “Well Ms. Granger, I know you had your concerns about the curse affecting your body, but it seems it has had no effect on your reproductive system. I’m not sure it would affect someone of your type anyway. My only hope is that the magical matching system takes your kind into perspective, otherwise you won’t have any children.” </span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>Affronted, Hermione was fuming. “Excuse me? My kind? Isn’t that the entire reason the war happened and why we’re forced into a marriage law? I expect my husband to have intercourse with me and produce the two children required by law whether he is pureblood or not. As long as I am able to have children, that is the extent of your opinions, Healer Davies.” </span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>Healer Davies looked at her very confused before she had a sudden realization. “My goodness! Ms. Granger. That is not at all what I mean. I thought you were aware of what you are. My comment was simply that there are specific men that will help you produce children. A beta, for example, is not one of them.” </span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>“A beta? You mean like a wolf? So what does that make me?” </span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>“Similarly yes. You’ll need an Alpha, as you are an Omega.” </span>
</p>
<hr/><p>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>Twelve Grimmauld Place was always a place of comfort. Harry and Hermione had fixed the place up to live in. Ginny, Harry, and Ron all sat in shock after Hermione revealed to them what the healer told her. She had stopped at Flourish and Blotts to pick up a few selections on Alpha and Omegas. It wasn’t terribly out of character for her to pick them up for work as that was her department and with the new law, there could be a reason to buy them, or so she told the associate. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You do realize how rare Omega are in our world right?” Ginny asked, still shocked. “I mean, a half-blood is more likely to be an Omega than a muggle-born. That makes you extremely rare! And she’s sure?” </span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>“Positive. She explained all the symptoms and what I should expect coming up. She also told me that most witches would have come of status around seventeen as they finished Hogwarts but the stress and challenges of the war must have prevented it. Much like it would a monthly. I’ve started to notice the symptoms.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So are you… coming into it now then?” Ron asked awkwardly. Hermione blushed and nodded. </span>
</p><p>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>“That might be enough to disqualify you from the marriage law then. Especially because Alphas aren’t widely known, same with Omegas.” Harry said. </span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>Ginny snorted. “Are you barmy? Harry, they’re going to try to find an Alpha. Hermione is essentially a baby-making machine now. It’s a great way to repopulate our world.” </span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>“How would they, uh, test if you’re an Alpha?” Ron asked, receiving glares from Ginny and Hermione, “What? I mean, we already know each other. We know we’re great together. The only reason we even broke up was that we wanted a different amount of kids. You’d still be working for the ministry by repopulating the Wizarding World and we could have six or seven, or more kids.” </span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>“And that Ronald, is why we broke up,” Hermione said standing and going to her room. Ginny followed her, glaring at her brother. </span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>Hermione laid face down on her bed groaning. Ginny laid next to her, linking her elbow with hers. An owl flew through the window with a ministry seal. Taking it, Ginny handed it to Hermione holding her breath. Harry hadn’t told her who Hermione’s match was. Hermione opened it, read the letter and handed it to Ginny as she face-planted into her pillow.</span>

  <span>“Malfoy! They can’t be serious Hermione. You’re a muggle-born! You’ll be killed!” </span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>“Harry said they have safety measures in place. I’m sure that’s what the contract is for, to ensure people don’t kill each other. Not like it matters though, I have to go tell Kingsley I’m no longer eligible for Malfoy because I’m an Omega and to ensure I get paired with an Alpha. I just wonder how Malfoy’s taking it.” Hermione said as she blushed, remembering how good he smelled. </span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>“Probably coming up with your murder plan now.” Ginny laughed, missing the glow on Hermione’s cheeks.</span>
</p>
<hr/><p>
  <span>Draco had learned well enough early on, how to ignore his mother drabble on about the gossip of the purebloods. He honestly cared less about what hairdo they got, but it made her happy, so he’d pick up keywords to respond back with. What he was really thinking about was his healer exam and what happened in the waiting room. Granger wasn’t wearing any perfume. He found that incredibly hard to believe, but she smelled fantastic. </span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>As he was thinking this, an owl flew into his window with a letter from the ministry. Assuming it was his results, he opened it slowly. Reading it, his eyes got wider as he read the name at the bottom. In shock, he handed the letter to his mother. </span>

  <span>“Hermione….Granger…” Narcissa stammered. “They’ve set you up with a muggle-born, and that specific one. There must be a flaw with the match system. There’s absolutely no way that’s able to happen. We’ll go straight to the ministry tomorrow to fight this.” </span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>“Mother, I’m not ineligible.” </span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>“Well, this is some sort of sick joke. They’re doing this just to get back at us.” Draco was lost in thought as his mother continued her rant. He knew, even if they were doing this to get back at their family, they would never pair him up with Granger. She had filled out, and was beautiful in her own way. Intellectually, she would keep him stimulated and be able to match his wit. They enjoyed a good sparring during Hogwarts so the energy could be shifted to the bedroom. He had never thought of her as a prospect before, but she was definitely better than a pureblood princess if she spoke of more than just a new hairstyle or who came to what event, and that perfume that’s driving him crazy, well, he could smell it all day.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...tomorrow morning, I expect you up early to be at the minister’s office, fighting this.” </span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>“Yes, mother.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p>
<hr/><p>
  <span>Hermione sat outside Kingsley Shacklebolt’s office nervously rubbing her wrists together. The sensation was relaxing her nerves as she prepared herself. She was hoping Kingsley would keep her secret from Malfoy, knowing he’d demand an answer. Taking a deep breath in, her eyes widened. She smelled him before she saw him. Parchment, grass, the forest. Looking up, she saw Malfoy walking towards her. </span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>“Granger.” Draco greeted, as he held his breath. </span>
  <em>
    <span>It must be her shampoo or conditioner. She smells like fire again. </span>
  </em>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>“Looks like we both received the letter? Here to fight it?” </span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>“My mother has raised some concerns.” </span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>“Such as?” </span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>“The validity of the matching system for one. Is that also your concern?” </span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>“Um. Well no, I know the system is without flaw, but I have come to find that I might be ineligible.” Hermione said as she took another deep breath. “Is it warm in here?” She asked as she fanned her shirt. She felt like the room had become quite a few degrees higher. </span>
  <em>
    <span>This must be one of those heat flashes I read about.</span>
  </em>
  <em>
    <span><br/>
</span>

    <span><br/>
</span>
  </em>
  <span>Draco was wearing a white button-up shirt and black trousers and felt that it was quite comfortable. Her cheeks had started to get pinker and her...fragrance... was starting to overpower his senses again. </span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>Kingsley opened the door just as Draco opened his mouth to speak. “Hermione! … Mr. Malfoy? I wasn’t expecting this on the first day? Have you already planned a date then?” </span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>“Well, um, no. It seems we’re both here in disagreement.” </span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>Kingsley sighed but welcomed them in. Walking to his cabinet, he opened the door and pulled out a file. “Look. Hermione, you know yourself that there’s no flaw to the matching system. I’m a bit surprised you’re here at all. I have made a separate, specific contract for the two of you, and before you object to this marriage, I want you to read it. If you’ll take a seat, I’d like to discuss everything with you two.” </span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>Hermione was trying to listen to everything he said, but her mind was starting to get hazy. The heat was taking over her entire body. “Blimey, it’s boiling in here.” She mumbled. “Kingsley, I found out information at my appointment yesterday that should prove I’m not eligible for this marriage.” She rushed out as she went to sit. She swayed a bit, causing Malfoy on instinct, to grab her wrist to steady her. Her hormones instantly went into overdrive from the contact. She felt an embarrassing amount of fluid gush between her legs. The smell of parchment, grass and the forest burst through her senses, and she moaned as Draco let quickly let go, dropping her in the chair. She closed her eyes to center her mind. </span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>“Hermione, are you alright?” </span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>Taking a deep breath in through her mouth, keeping her eyes closed, she hesitated in her answer. “Sir, I can’t marry Malfoy because, I’m, um, an…” </span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>The realization of what Hermione was, felt like a bucket of cold water had been thrown at him. </span>
  <em>
    <span>The strawberry smell, the fire smell, the flush of her cheeks, and is that</span>
  </em>
  <span>… he inhaled deeply. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Arousal</span>
  </em>
  <span>. He almost moaned. “An Omega…” Malfoy whispered stunned. Hermione nodded faintly. </span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>“How can you tell Mister Malfoy?” </span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>“Because, as it turns out, Granger and I are indeed a perfect match.” </span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>Hermione looked up at Draco in shock. </span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span><br/>
</span>
  <span>“That’s right, Granger. I’m an Alpha.” </span>
