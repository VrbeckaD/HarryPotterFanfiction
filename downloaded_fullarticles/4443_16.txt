<p>It's Halloween, and it's just the right kind of weather to accommodate. Maybe most people wouldn't want a storm battering at their house on this night, especially not the mundane neighborhoods Lily remembers going trick-or-treating through as a child. But they are hiding, and staying in, and James makes the <em>worst</em> jokes about the weather as Lily pops popcorn the old way, <em>her</em> old way, without magic. James is at the table, helping clear away plates while Harry smooshes the last of his peas in his tiny fist.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There's just a bit more racket than normal, over the storm, and something in Lily's throat tightens. Her fist closes tighter around the pan she has the popcorn in, absently sliding it toward the back burner. It's nothing, likely, a branch torn loose by the storm, or...</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The wards drop without further warning, and Lily cries out in outrage, Summoning her wand to her fingertips even as the front door bursts open.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>Heartbeat</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There's a gods-awful clatter as the plates in James' hands crash to the floor.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>Heartbeat</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Lily bolting for the table, shielding spell on her lips as soon as worn wood comes in contact with her skin.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>Heartbeat</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>James blurring and there's a stag in front of the table.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>Heartbeat</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The shield charm leaves her wand, aimed at her son, his face still a mess from dinner.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>Heartbeat</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rain is blasting through the front door, but a body blocks the wind for a moment</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>Heartbeat</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And Prong's hoofbeats on the floor are louder than the thunder to her ears, and she's grabbing for James' wand as she moves past it on the counter</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>Heartbeat</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There's a spell coming from the bulk in the doorway, but her's is faster, shimmering slightly as it solidifies around Harry's highchair.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>Heartbeat</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The other spell bounces off the wall right before Prongs lets out that deafening bugle and her ears are filled with the sound of a heavy impact.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>Heartbeat</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She freezes, almost. The most powerful stunner she knows is on her lips, hand ready to throw it through her wand, but Prongs is buried tine-deep into the body, and she doesn't pause at Voldemort's face but at the fact that she refuses to hit James.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>Heartbeat</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>James shakes himself like a dog, tines inflicting massive damage where they're buried, and when he steps back, Lily sends the stunner like a curse from her very soul.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>Heartbeat</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There are no words, but James' wand shivers in her hand and she lets it go. <em>Incarcerous</em> flies from her wand on the tail of the stunner.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>Heartbeat</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For a moment James stands on two feet, horns shrunk somewhat but not yet gone, hard-looking fingers grasping his wand as it smacks solidly to his almost- palm.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>Heartbeat</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Other spells come flying through the door, and Lily casts the dueling shield in front of James as he turns his wand to the dark wizard at his feet.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>Heartbeat</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Blood erupts from the wounds in Voldemort's chest at whatever spell James casts, and the body jerks against the floor.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>Heartbeat</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The spells fizzle against the dueling shield, and James' face is more than human enough to show the absolute cold fury that has taken over him. He levels his wand at the door, and whoever is on the other side.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>Heartbeat</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Reducto,” he snarls, and it's the first words Lily has heard clearly since the wards around the house shattered. He's still mostly Prongs below the waist.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>Heartbeat</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The curse levels most of the front lawn, from the sound of it, and James advances toward the doorway even as his feet change back. Lily keeps her wand on the fallen wizard in her foyer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>Heartbeat</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sirius pops into the room already looking fit to battle, wand raised. Lily flinches, about ready to bring her wand to bear on him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>Heartbeat</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And then his eyes do that thing when he's about to change down to Padfoot, that hard-to-mimic color-swirl when flint-grey human starts to go to grey-black canine, and Lily jerks her head at the door.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>Heartbeat</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sirius walks past Voldemort's body, barely pausing as his wand twitches in fashion Lily would have called casual if not for the light that flicked from the tip. By the time Sirius has rushed out the door, the body was completely bound in glinting metal chains.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry's watching, Lily notes when she glances at him. He's quiet for being a year old, for the interruption of his evening, for the fact he's still behind the shimmering blue shield charm.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He doesn't look scared.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>Heartbeat</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>Heartbeat</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The lawn is suspiciously silent, but Lily stares at the door, on guard, keeps Harry in her field of vision. James is a competent duelist, just as Sirius is, and she'd seen her husband's face as he walked out that door.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>Heartbeat</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>James walks through the doorway first, and for a moment all Lily can see is the blood caked in his hair. He smiles, and does the same thing Sirius did, but far more noticeable with his green eyes. Her hand doesn't shake as she lowers her wand.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>Heartbeat</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Padfoot crosses the threshold, and as James turns to repair the door and erect new wards, the dog hikes a leg over Voldemort's mangled body.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>Heartbeat</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Padfoot!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He barks unrepentantly and changes back up to Sirius in a flash. Lily sighs. “You'll be cleaning that yourself.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>Heartbeat</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“After someone else moves the body away,” and tips his wand into the now-familiar incantation for the <em>Patronus</em> charm.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Ma?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>Heartbeat</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She lets her guard down enough to walk behind the shield and pick up Harry. He smears pea on her cheek, but wraps both arms around her neck.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>Heartbeat</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>Heartbeat</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The door, repaired, scrapes closed and shuts out the sound of the storm to its previous volume. James carefully dismantles the shield charm and hugs both of them.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>Heartbeat</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>They might not be fully safe yet.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But they're alive.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>Heartbeat</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>Heartbeat</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>Heartbeat</em>
