    <p>It started, as some great friendships do, with a train ride. The train in question was currently chugging through a rolling field on its way to Hogwarts. The friendship in question would, quite literally, change the world–the wizarding world, at least. Even world-changing friendships, however, need a beginning, and that is why we find ourselves in a small train compartment of the Hogwarts Express with a certain boy called Remus Lupin.</p><p>As eleven-year-olds go, Remus was not much to look at. He was rather tall and gangly for his age, with a mop of curly brown hair that constantly fell into his eyes. More notably, however, were the pale scars crisscrossing his body. He was a werewolf, and the scars were left over from rough nights with full moons. Remus–quite dramatically, as eleven-year-old werewolves tend to be–felt as if they were constant reminders of the monster that he became every month.</p><p>At the moment, Remus was staring out the window at the passing fields. The compartment was silent except for the noise of the train clanking along the railroad, which made quite a lot of room for his anxieties to be heard. <em>Nobody will like you. You’ll fail all your classes. The whole school will find out you’re a werewolf and you’ll be removed.</em> Remus firmly told himself that he was being ridiculous, but a knot of nerves still twisted in his stomach.</p><p>There was a loud giggling noise from the train hallway outside, and Remus glanced over as a couple slid open the door and fell, tangled together, onto the seat next to him. He squashed himself against the window, but they didn’t notice anything. Instead they proceeded in an attempt to suck each other’s faces off. He edged out of the compartment, cringing and trying not to brush against the couple.</p><p>The train was full of students catching up with their friends, laughing and chatting. Nearly every compartment was filled, and Remus caught snatches of conversation as he wandered down the cramped hallway. He paused, looking back at the front of the train and wondered whether there would be more space there when he felt someone run into him with a muffled grunt.</p><p>“Oh, I’m so sorry!” A short blond boy with watery blue eyes tried to pick himself up off the ground, juggling a trunk and a cage with a disgruntled-looking black cat inside.</p><p>“No, no, don’t worry about it.” he said to the boy. “Here, let me hold your trunk for you.” He reached for the polished brown handle, and the boy offered it to him gratefully.</p><p>“I’m Peter,” the boy said. “Peter Pettigrew.”</p><p>“Remus Lupin.”</p><p>“Are you a first year?” said Peter.</p><p>Remus nodded. “You?”</p><p>“Same here,” Peter said. “Do you want to find somewhere to sit down?”</p><p>“As long as there aren’t any couples trying to mangle each other’s faces in there, that sounds good.” Remus said with a wince.</p><p>He followed Peter down the hallway, towards the back of the train. They stopped outside a compartment with two boys, one with black hair and pale features and the other with a deep brown complexion, who looked about their age inside. He looked at Remus, who shrugged and nodded, and then eased the door open.</p><p>“Snivellus, back again?” said the dark-haired boy with a cocky grin. He did a double take when he realized that Remus and Peter weren’t whoever he was expecting. “Oh, my apologies.”</p><p>The other boy snickered and pushed his glasses up his nose. “Good morning, gentlemen,” he said, imitating the first boy’s posh accent. “My name is Sirius, from the Noble and most Precious house of Black. I am terribly sorry if I offended you.”</p><p>The first boy threw a Chocolate Frog at his head. “Shut up, James.”</p><p>Remus coughed. “Uh, do you guys mind if we sit here? Everywhere else is full.”</p><p>“Sure, go ahead.” said James. He unwrapped the Chocolate Frog and ate it in exaggerated bites as they sat down, smacking his lips as Sirius rolled his eyes.</p><p>They introduced themselves and got to talking about Quidditch (Sirius and James were both Holyhead Harpies fans, Peter was a supporter of the Wimbourne Wasps, and Remus barely knew how to play), which lead them into broom spells, then Chocolate Frog card collecting, then a game of Exploding Snap. Before the boys knew it, they were changing into their robes and leaving the train.</p><p>“Firs’ years over here!” A gigantic bearded man waved his arms and they fought through the crowd of students to reach him.</p><p>“That’s Hagrid, the gamekeeper,” said James proudly. “My dad told me all about him.”</p><p>“He must have giant blood in him.” whispered Peter, who only came up to the man’s waist, in awe. They followed him and boarded a fleet of small boats at the edge of a lake with the rest of the first years.</p><p>“My dad said the giant squid in here ate someone once.” James said casually to Sirius. Peter’s eyes widened.</p><p>“Really?” said Sirius, holding back a snigger.</p><p>James nodded. “Absolutely.” He leaned over the side of the boat and pretended to squint into the murky water. “Look, there’s something there.”</p><p>Peter followed James’ finger with an open mouth. He peered into the lake like he saw movement. Remus gazed into the water, but saw nothing. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw James wink at Sirius.</p><p>James dug his fingers into Peter’s side, tickling him and yelling, “Ahhh!” Peter screamed, and so did Remus. James and Sirius burst out laughing, and after a moment, so did the other two boys.</p><p>As Hogwarts came into view, there was a chorus of gasps. The castle towered over the black lake like a giant. The reflection of hundreds of lights shimmered in the rippling water as the boats slipped quietly towards the castle.</p><p>The first years gathered in the Great Hall, gaping at the charmed star-strewn ceiling. Professor McGonagall gave them a stern speech, explaining how houses worked at Hogwarts, house points, and other things that Remus was too anxious to pay attention to. They murmured with nerves as she led them past the entire Great Hall to the ragged Sorting Hat sitting on a wooden stool. James grinned at Sirius while the Sorting Hat sang its song, and Sirius smiled rather weakly back, determined not to let his anxiety show. Remus felt as though his heart would beat its way out of his chest. Peter was quite ready to sit down somewhere in a corner and let the Sorting Hat come to him.</p><p>The first person to be Sorted was “Avery, Roland!” The hat declared him Slytherin, and the table on the far left erupted in cheers. “Aubrey, Bertam!” was promptly named a Ravenclaw.<br/>
“Black, Sirius!” was the next person to be called.</p><p>Sirius walked up to the Sorting Hat with a grim sort of determination. The last thing he saw before the Hat covered his eyes was the table full of green and silver watching him.</p><p>“Another Black, hmm?” said a small voice. If the Sorting Hat had a head, Sirius thought it would have chuckled. “Interesting.” said the voice again, and laughed. “Well, well, well. This is novel indeed. There’s a first time for everything, I suppose. I think I’d better put you in GRYFFINDOR!”</p><p>Professor McGonagall took the Hat off, and he blinked furiously at the sudden brightness of the Great Hall. There was a long moment of silence, and then the Gryffindor table erupted in cheers. Sirius walked over, feeling as if he was in a cloud of fog. The Slytherin table remained stubbornly mute and glared daggers at his back. From the line of first years, he saw James cheering. He sat down, some people clapping him on the back, and watched the rest of the Sorting.</p><p>Cheng, Daisy was the first Hufflepuff, and her twin, David, went to Ravenclaw. Lily Evans, the girl from the train, was the next Gryffindor. Remus became a Gryffindor as well, and he took a seat next to Sirius, looking thoroughly stunned. A shy-looking girl called Alice Longbottom became a Gryffindor as well, along with Dorcas Meadowes and Marlene McKinnon. Mary McDonald was a Hufflepuff, and Adrian O’Hara was Sorted Slytherin.</p><p>The Hat sat on Peter’s head for almost five minutes, and just as the crowd started to murmur, it announced him a Gryffindor and he walked over, tripping over his shoelaces amidst gales of laughter. James was Sorted Gryffindor as soon as the Hat fell over his eyes and he sat down with an exhilarated grin.</p><p>“I guess we’re stuck together now.” James said, wiggling his bushy eyebrows at them. Behind him, Severus Snape became a Slytherin.</p><p>“Just you wait. My mother will find a way to get me to switch houses.” said Sirius, only half joking.</p><p>“Dumbledore will never let that happen,” Peter said as they dug into the feast. “Besides, it’s not like it was your choice.” Sirius only nodded, suddenly very interested in his roast beef.</p><p>As the last crumbs of apple pie disappeared from the golden plates, Headmaster Dumbledore stood up from the front of the room and clinked his fork on his glass.</p><p>“Another excellent feast, another beginning of a year. I would like to remind students of some important rules, some for the first time and others...not.” He looked at a set of redheaded twins from the Ravenclaw table, eyes twinkling. “As usual, the Forbidden Forest is off-limits to students. This year, there is a new addition to the school grounds. The Whomping Willow is highly dangerous and I strongly advise students to stay far away from it at all times.”</p><p>Remus had gone pale and was staring at Dumbledore like he had three heads. James elbowed him. “You okay?” he muttered. Remus nodded.</p><p>“Fanged Frisbees, Ever-Bashing Boomerangs, and Yodeling Yo-Yos,” Dumbledore finished reading a list and neatly snapped the roll of parchment back into place. “If anyone has any questions about the list of forbidden objects, they should inquire with Caretaker Filch. Now, off to bed!”</p><p>The Great Hall echoed with chatter as everyone pushed back their chairs and stood up. The first years followed one of the prefects, Victoria Young, up and down flights of stairs and past moving paintings. They reached a portrait of a rather plump lady wearing a pale pink gown, who regarded the first years with interest. “Password?” she said.</p><p>“Grapefruit.” said Victoria, and the Fat Lady swung forward to let them in.</p><p>The common room was an explosion of red and gold. A crackling fire was already burning in the fireplace, and students milled around, talking to each other and catching up. There was a pause, and once the other Gryffindors realized the first years had entered, they broke out in cheers and chants of “First-ies! First-ies!” James and Sirius took exaggerated bows, blowing kisses to older students, who wolf-whistled back. Lily Evans rolled her eyes, and Remus hid a grin.</p><p>“The dormitories are upstairs.” Victoria told the first years once the celebratory cheers had died down. “Girls on the right, boys on the left. Your name and your roommates will be on the front of your door.”</p><p>“Race you!” said James to Peter, Sirius, and Remus, and they hurtled up the stairs, elbowing each other and laughing.</p>
