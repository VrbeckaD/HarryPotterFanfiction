    <p>(Naomi's POV) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It was finally time for me to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry! I was only slightly excited, as I had already been taught many spells at a very young age. Many were taught to me by Severus Snape, who I had not seen in years. My mother was a witch and my father, well, I never knew my father. It is unknown who he is, or if he is still among the living. Mum was killed shortly after I was born. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>For a while I stayed with Professor Dumbledore himself, then stayed with Severus Snape. However, the ministry did not like the idea of me staying with either of the male Wizards and forced them to send me to an orphanage. I guess that's where my story begins.</p><p> </p><p>-Flashback-</p><p> </p><p>The first family I was adopted by was kind enough, they took good care of me. The woman had bright blue eyes and brown hair while the man had black hair and brown eyes. By the time I'd gotten used to being in their family, they were killed. Dementors had come and attacked them, sucking out each of their souls right before my eyes. It was horrifying. All I could do was stand as their souls were eaten and their bodies fell limp, never to move again with their faces frozen into an eternal state of horror and pain. I can still remember the screams and mine mixed in with those of my 'family'. </p><p> </p><p>It was almost dark out, the sunset making the sky a blood red color as the sun sank beneath the hills. Before the dementors could kill me, a tall man with brown hair and bluish grey eyes had cast a patronus in the shape of a wolf that sent the dementors running. I remember just standing there, staring back and forth between my dead 'parents' and the man who had been kind enough to save me. The man had come close to me, his patronus vanishing, before stopping and standing rigid. The sun had completely gone and it was a cloudless night. Before I could say a word, the man stared up at the full moon with horror before sprinting away, in the opposite direction of me and the small house in the middle of nowhere that I had lived in for only about a year. </p><p> </p><p>I had collapsed after the man left and apparently found by Snape and Dumbledore themselves. When I woke up I told them the entire story, but left out the part about who saved me. I said I could not remember how I escaped. It wasn't long after that I was taught by Snape how to cast a patronus along with a few much simpler spells such as 'Wingardium leviosa' 'Lumos' and 'expelliarmus.' </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>I had to use his wand of course, as I was too young to have one of my own. It was not long before I was sent to yet another muggle family. They were complete idiots. They called me a freak and more often than not, didn't feed me. They had been good friends with my last foster family (which I found hard to believe) and blamed me for their deaths. It wasn't long after my arrival that I ran away. I can still remember that night. I had grabbed a pocket knife, some food, and my clothes before hitting the road. We lived right by a forest, quite simply in the middle of nowhere. Many strange hings had occurred during my little wilderness exploration. The ministry of Magic ended up catching me and sending me to live with the Weasley family, whom was very welcoming. Why did they take me in? That's a question I still ask myself to this day.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-End of kinda flashback-</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Oi, Naomi! Have you even been listening to a word I've said?!" Mrs. Weasley groaned in exasperation, interrupting my long string of thoughts.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>I had just been punished along with Fred and George for letting a few spiders loose in Ron's bed while he slept. When he woke up he nearly had a heart attack! It was perfect and we managed to catch it on camera. Unfortunately, the happiness was tainted as I could not get the memory of my first 'parent's' deaths out of my head. I honestly just wanted to go into my room and listen to my iPod at this point. (Dumbledore had been kind enough to buy me one for my birthday a few years ago).</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Umm.... No. Sorry?" I tried.</p><p> </p><p>"You shouldn't be following along with Fred and George's idiotic pranks! I expect more out of you Naomi!" she huffed, storming out.</p><p> </p><p>I giggled and looked at the two red headed twins.</p><p> </p><p>"Ppffffttttt! Little does she know it was my idea!" I chuckled mirthlessly, still a bit disturbed by the memories flashing through my head at the moment.</p><p> </p><p>"Good work sis!" Fred said, giving me a high five.</p><p> </p><p>George then picked me up and spun me in a circle, laughing heartily. He set me down and the twins then left the kitchen. As soon as the door was shut I frowned and walked up the steps to my room. The Weasleys had kindly given me my own room seeing as they had one extra. I have slowly been becoming less and less antisocial. I wanted to show people that even though my past may have broken me, I was learning how to pick up the pieces.</p><p> </p><p>I was reminded every day that I had a family who cared for me. My nightmares had pretty much stopped but now, ever since I'd gotten my Hogwarts acceptance letter, my nightmares have gotten worse and I have find myself spacing off randomly. There were still things the Weasleys didn't know about me. For one, I'm an animagus. However, instead of one form I have a few different ones. I can transform into a silver wolf with green eyes that matched the color of my natural ones, as they did in all of my animagus forms, a snowy owl, or a black panther. They do not know my true parents either. </p><p> </p><p>According to Severus, who went to school with my mother, my mother's name was Claire. She was a very powerful witch with a strong connection to animals. She was also brave and had the same hair and eyes as I did. Unfortunately, Snape didn't know who my father was.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Naomi! It's time to go to Diagon Alley for school supplies!" Molly Weasley called.</p><p> </p><p>I groaned and grabbed my iPod, setting it on shuffle and shoving my headphones in my ears before jogging downstairs to the fireplace where everyone but Ginny and Mr. Weasley were waiting. We used floo powder to get to Diagon Alley and set off. Before we started shopping, Snape apparated nearby and came over to me, gesturing for me to take out my earbuds. I groaned, seeing as I was in the middle of one of my favorite songs,, only to pull out my earbuds when Severus shot me a dangerous look.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Hello Naomi. Proffesor Dumbledore has instructed me to bring you to Gringotts. Apparently you have a full account left by your parents. It will pay for your school supplies and whatever else you wish to buy." he stated monotonously.</p><p> </p><p>"And we are supposed to trust y-" Molly started, only to be cut off by Snape pulling a letter out of his robe and handing it to her.</p><p> </p><p>No doubt it was Dumbledore's instructions for Snape, signed by the great Professor himself. Molly grumbled and handed the letter back to him roughly.</p><p> </p><p>"Naomi-"</p><p> </p><p>"Chill Mrs. Weasley, I'll be fine," I promised, waving at her and the others.</p><p> </p><p>I noticed Fred and George had some sort of candy in their hands. I raised my eyebrow and gave them a knowing smile. They winked at me simultaneously and turned around to follow their mother.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Well then Sever- ugh professor Snape... I'm gonna have to get used to calling you that now I suppose," I groaned.</p><p> </p><p>He chuckled lightly and started walking, beckoning for me to follow. We passed quite a few shops along the way. I was especially excited to see a shop full of animals and another full of books. </p><p> </p><p>"Okay, I am definitely checking those ones out!" I said happily.</p><p> </p><p>The professor laughed once more and nodded at the huge building in front of us.</p><p> </p><p>"This is Gringott's. We will pick up your money here and then get your supplies. I trust you have your letter with the list of needed supplies?"</p><p> </p><p>I nodded as he led me into the large white building. There were goblins everywhere. They were sitting in desks on either side of the path to the main desk, working away. I stuck close to Snape's side, as the goblins slightly unnerving. He led me to the front desk where an old goblin with long fingers sat, writing with a quill on a piece of parchment. the professor pulled out a key and set it on the table.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Ms. Carter here wishes to enter her vault, number 314," Snape drawled out in monotone.</p><p> </p><p>The goblin nodded and led us through a corridor where we then entered a strange cart. It almost looked like an amusement ride. It was attached to two rails on either side of it, which I presumed was to guide it to the vault. Snape gripped the rail in front of our seat and I followed suit. It was a fairly short ride through a dark tunnel before we stopped at a vault numbered 314.</p><p> </p><p>"Here we are, vault 314." the goblin stated.</p><p> </p><p>The goblin got out of the cart and opened the vault. Inside was loads of gold and gems, all piled up together in a massive heap. My eyes widened and I gasped lightly at the sight.</p><p> </p><p>"Oh. My. Merlin." I managed to say, grabbing a few handfuls of gold and putting them in a leather pouch Snape handed me in silence.</p><p> </p><p>We left the bank, thanking the goblin who helped us and started walking towards the book shop. Snape helped me find the books I needed for school and waited patiently for me to buy them before walking out with me.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Seeing as I have no idea where the Weasleys went, I'll stick with you until you finish shopping and then we can look for them," Professor Snape stated.</p><p> </p><p>I nodded as he led me into the shop full of animals. There were many different animals, owls, toads, cats, even rats! There was only one that caught my eye though. A silvery speckled owl with silver eyes sat in a cage off in the far corner of the shop. The shop owner saw me staring at it and frowned.</p><p> </p><p>"You don't want that one Miss. She doesn't like anyone. Her last owner brought him back because she kept biting!"</p><p> </p><p>That was that then.</p><p> </p><p>"Can you open her cage?" I questioned.</p><p> </p><p>The owner frowned and came over. Snape stood beside me as the shop owner opened the owl's cage. The owl screeched and stayed at the back of the cage, looking quite terrified.</p><p> </p><p>"Hey girl, it's alright," I murmured, watching the owl carefully.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The gorgeous owl looked at my stretched out hand and hopped onto my arm. She stood still as I stroked her head reassuringly. </p><p> </p><p>"How much is she?"</p><p> </p><p>"Free. I've been trying to get rid of that one for quite a while! I'd be happy to give him to you." the owner stated.</p><p> </p><p>I smiled and put the owl back in her cage before picking the whole cage up. Snape went to grab something from the other side of the store and came back holding two large bags of owl treats.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"For your owl," he said, gesturing at my new owl.</p><p> </p><p>"Thank you," I smiled.</p><p> </p><p>We walked out of the shop with Severus carrying my school books and me carrying my owl and the treats. Of course, on the walk I spotted the candy store.</p><p> </p><p>"Oh heck yes!" I shouted, running to the shop and leaving Snape to keep up with me.</p><p> </p><p>Once inside I bought a few bags full of candy, Snape laughing as I attempted to carry it all.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Can you apparate with me back to the Weasley's to drop this stuff off?"</p><p> </p><p>"Why not," he sighed.</p><p> </p><p>I grabbed the professor's arm and we apparated, suddenly appearing in my room at the burrow. I just set the owl on my dresser before throwing everything else on my bed to clean up later. Snape set down my books on my dresser as well. The owl hooted at him demandingly. Snape chuckled and grabbed a treat we had just bought and fed it to her.</p><p> </p><p>"Im curious, Miss Carter, what's her name?" Snape questioned.</p><p> </p><p>"Enigma," I replied instantly.</p><p> </p><p>"Ahh."</p><p> </p><p>he professor smiled and let me grab his arm as he apparated us once again. We landed in the same spot the Weasleys and I had a few hours earlier. I saw Molly Weasley's red hair outside the pet shop we had been in earlier and headed towards her. I bumped into someone in the crowd and accidentally knocked them over.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Sorry," I stated monotonously.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Damn. Too much time hanging around Severus. The boy I'd knocked over had bright blonde hair and a cold sneer on his face. Was he really giving me a dirty look because he can't stay on his feet?</p><p> </p><p>"Or not," I muttered under my breath.</p><p> </p><p>The kid got up and glared at me. I didn't glare back, simply gave him a bored expression. Snape just stood behind me silently. I sighed and pulled the blondie to his feet, nearly sending him toppling forward because of his momentum.</p><p> </p><p>"Watch where you're going next time girl!" he hisses.</p><p> </p><p>I rolled my eyes as a man with long blonde hair the same color as the boy's and a woman with black and blonde hair came up beside him.</p><p> </p><p>"Im sorry, I didn't realize you didn't know how to walk," I stated, once again in monotone.</p><p> </p><p>"Mmmph. My name's Malfoy, Draco Malfoy." he stated, holding his hand out for me to shake.</p><p> </p><p>I flicked a strand of my long, curly black hair out of my eyes and just stared at Draco's hand disdainfully.</p><p> </p><p>"Naomi Carter," I stated before turning towards Molly and the rest of the family, only to see them heading over to me.</p><p> </p><p>Molly was glaring at the Malfoys harshly.</p><p> </p><p>"Hello Mrs. Weasley," I greeted.</p><p> </p><p>"Good to see you safe Naomi. I trust you found everything alright?"</p><p> </p><p>"Of course, with help from Professor Snape of course," I replied, smiling slightly in Snape's direction.</p><p> </p><p>"Good day Mr. and Mrs. Malfoy," Molly stated, dragging me towards Ron who was looking through the pet store window.</p><p> </p><p>"Bye Professor Snape, see you at school!" I called over my shoulder.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>I saw him nod and apparate away, leaving the Malfoys standing in rage on the sidewalk.</p>
