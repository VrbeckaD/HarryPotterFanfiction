    <p>“Percival.” Seraphina Picquery’s voice echoes off the tiled walls of Percival Graves’ bathroom, where he is, on the twentieth day of his retirement, enjoying a nice shave.</p><p>“Seraphina,” he says back, wiping his straight razor clean. “I hope you’ve called because you’ve missed my glittering personality and charming ways.” He pulls his cheek taut and passes the razor over it, the hair falling in a soft rustle, the heat of his hand shocking against newly bared skin.</p><p>“I do miss you, but no, this isn’t a social call. I need a favor.”</p><p>Percival glares at his phone, perched on the corner of the sink. It, unhappily, refuses to turn off in spontaneous protest.</p><p>“<em>Retired,</em> Seraphina.”</p><p> "Yes, I know, but this is-“ the shuffle of papers, ”-an unusual case. One that needs a male Dominant.“</p><p>Percival wipes the razor clean one last time and closes it, placing it back on its shelf above the toilet. "That’s what you said about the last client, and that one broke me.” He scoops up the phone on his way out of the bathroom and goes to the kitchen, where a new espresso machine with a ludicrous amount of knobs and gears sits, humming happily. </p><p>He has no idea how it works, but now, for once, he has time to figure it out, after years of bad police station coffee. </p><p>A pause on the other end. “I didn’t think Theseus would affect you so badly when I sent you to him.”</p><p>Percival ignores the twist in his stomach at the name with long practice, blinds himself to the flash of auburn hair and hollow eyes in his mind’s eye. “Well, it did. Send my replacement.”</p><p>”<em>Damn it, Percival</em>-“ and the unexpected profanity in her voice has him scrambling not to drop the bag of coffee beans, ”-there is no replacement!“</p><p>"Still?” He’d given three weeks’ notice, after Theseus; it’s been nearly two months now, and it’s not as though the world is hurting for male Dominants. Male Dominants who can be a sex surrogate, though…</p><p>“Yes, <em>still</em>. You were a rare gem, it seems; I’ve interviewed close to a hundred candidates and I haven’t found a single male Dom who wasn’t inexperienced, entitled, cold, self-centered, indiscreet, or God forbid, all of those at once. And I don’t even want to ask you, but like I said, this one’s challenging, high-profile-”</p><p>“How high profile?” Percival sets the milk to steam and turns around to survey his apartment: white, black, gray, silent and still. Retirement might be boring, and it wouldn’t harm anything to devote an hour or two a week to one client-</p><p>“You would need to sign a nondisclosure agreement before I could tell you much more, but I can say that the prescription for a surrogate came from Newt, and Newt specifically wants you.”</p><p><em>Newt?</em> Well, that makes sense, as mortifying as it might be; Newt saw how Percival and Theseus interacted, how Percival cared for Theseus even at his most fragile, and if Newt’s providing therapy to someone in need of surrogacy, it makes sense he’d think of Percival, first. But Newt doesn’t counsel the jet set, the sorts of people who’d require an NDA before even meeting - who <em>is </em>this client?</p><p>Damn it, now he’s interested, almost invested, the old cop’s curiosity raising its head once more. </p><p>“If- <em>if </em>I did an initial consult with Newt and the client, would you pay the usual rate? Understanding, of course, that I’m not guaranteeing anything.”</p><p>Seraphina, thankfully, is too polite to mention his capitulation. “Of course. I’ll fax over the NDA, and then you and Newt can set up a time to go meet the client.”</p><p>Percival takes his latte with him to his office, pushing a case of crops out of the way with his foot. He’d used the one with a rabbit-fur tip on Theseus, towards the end, and the memory twitches his lips into a smile.</p><p>“Oh, and Percival?”</p><p>“Yeah?” </p><p>“Thank you. If you hadn’t taken it, I would have had to send Abernathy, and that would’ve been a disaster for all concerned.”</p><p>“You wouldn’t. The man can barely articulate the difference between a surrogate and a non-medical sex worker, he’d be a nightmare in any client-facing scenario!”</p><p>The fax whirs, sounding worryingly like the espresso machine for a moment, and spits out the first sheet of paper, bearing Newt’s signature, Seraphina’s as the proprietor of Picquery Surrogates, a space for Percival’s, and at the bottom, in a trembling, unsure hand, the client’s name:</p><p><em>Credence Barebone. </em><br/>

Fuck.</p>
