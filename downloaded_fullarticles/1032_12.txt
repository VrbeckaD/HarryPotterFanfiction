    <p> </p><p>Pansy Parkinson should have been born a boy. She knows it deep inside her bones.  </p><p><em> Father would have preferred a boy, </em>she thinks critically. </p><p>It isn’t really a slight to her, she knows her father tolerates both his daughters well enough. He has made peace with it, he will after all, never have any sons. His love for her late mother being one of the few admirable qualities all can agree on about Lord Parkinson. He’s a strict man, a careful one. Terribly tall, all sharp features, and cold blue eyes. What her mother ever saw in him, if she saw anything at all, died with her. </p><p><em> I would have preferred to be a boy, </em>it's a bitter thought, and it slips into her mind when all the lights are out. When nobody can catch her repeatedly breaking things in her room. Over the years she has gotten much better at silencing her own screams and hiding the evidence of her own violence. Cruelty it seems, comes far too easily for her these days. </p><p>
  <em> “Silencio maxima” </em>
</p><p><em> Crash. </em> </p><p>Reparo. </p><p><em> Crash. </em> </p><p>Reparo. </p><p><em> Crash. </em> </p><p>Reparo. </p><p>She picks out a ceramic vase shard from her hand, blood running down her forearm, it stings but there is something oddly mesmerising about watching it smear along her pale white skin. She casts a quick healing charm and pulls down her cashmere robe sleeve again. </p><p>But Pansy is not a boy.</p><p>She is a pug faced girl, with too sharp eyes just like her father, and an upturned nose. She knows no matter how sleek and elegant her clothes are, how perfectly styles her hair, exceptionally done her makeup is, she will never be beautiful.  </p><p><em> Girls like you don’t have to be beautiful Pans, you’re rich and of the right sort. What does it matter what you look like? </em> Draco’s voice drawls in her ear. Sometimes he is so obtuse, as if he really is as dumb as a he pretends to be. </p><p>She sits down at her vanity mirror, and does her last touch ups. After all there is no need to look anything other than striking, red lipstick and subtle eyeshaddow. She applies a few setting and de-smudging charms, and a quick glamour spell over the ghastly spot she has developed over her right temple.</p><p>She’s good at this, always has been. Magic comes easily to her, like breathing. If only socialising was just as easy.</p><p><em> How easy it must be to be a good looking man... </em> She scowls at herself in the mirror, adjusting her bangs. <em> No that wont do. </em>She relaxes her whole face again, a blank slate. </p><p>She remembers sitting in her mother’s solar reading, the smell of earl grey and freshly baked lemon tea cakes. Books littered around the room, about flowers again, her mother loved everything that grew. <em> Don’t let them know what you’re really thinking Pansy darling, the world is cruel to those who don't know how to to play by the right set of rules</em>. </p><p>Her eyes sting, it’s been a long time since she’s let herself cry about her mother. It ruins her makeup after all, and that just wont do.</p><p>She knows that had she been beautiful like her mother, things would have been easier. Pretty people get what they like. They get the boys, the girls, the right opportunities, forgiveness, fourth and fifth chances. Power. Choices. </p><p>It really is absolutely rubbish, all of it. She chucks an empty perfume bottle into the wall for good measure, the shattering glass is satisfying. Sharp and loud.</p><p>She summons it back again, with a quick wave of her wand, and makes it piece itself together like nothing ever happened.</p><p>+++</p><p>“Pansy? Can you fix my hair?” A soft voice snaps her out of her own thoughts. Pansy turns and raises an eyebrow. Most people flinch or look away, her pale eyes unnerving, even her own housemates often back off when she's in one of her moods. But Daisy just smile, her own blue eyes warm and lovely as a pale blue summer sky. She never could refuse her sister anything, and with a huff she waves her over. </p><p>“You can’t keep coming to me for this when you get to Hogwarts, you know” Pansy stands and motions for her sister to sit on the satin chair. Daisy shrugs, and sits down. </p><p>“I know, but I thought it might be nice one last time before it all changes” Her sister is trying to look calm but instead she end up looking worried.</p><p>“Not everything will change” Of course some things will, and there is a war coming, but there is no need to worry Daisy. Not yet. </p><p>“Papa says it will. But as long as I’m sorted into Slytherin or Ravenclaw, like Aunt Dianna, it will be alright.” Pansy smiles, then comments “God forbid you get sorted into Hufflepuff.”</p><p>Daisy gives a worried glance at her sister in the mirror, </p><p>“But...what if I am a Hufflepuff? That would be positively dreadful?”</p><p>“Don’t be an idiot Daisy, it’s unbecoming. There has never been a Parkinson's sorted into Hufflepuff, or even worse into Gryffindor, and you will not either.”</p><p>“But-”</p><p>“It simply isn’t done.” She takes a moment to figure out what to say before adding “Besides, you can talk to the hat you know. If you want it bad enough, it will let you pick”</p><p>“Really?” her sister looks hopeful, it's fragile and soft and makes Pansy worried all over again. That her sister is not ready for the social politics outside her fathers curated social sphere...No matter Daisy's manners and easy charm. She wants to wrap her up in soft blankets and hide her from the cruel world. The one that will hurt her no matter how lovely she looks. Daisy, thank merlin, looks nothing like a pug. </p><p>“Daphne Greengrass got to pick between Ravenclaw and Slytherin, she chose Slytherin of course. A better fit for her, but her younger sister Astoria is perfectly happy in Ravenclaw.” </p><p>“Did you get to pick?”</p><p>Pansy hesitates, biting her tongue. Her sorting had been quick, she’s a Slytherin through and through. Cold, calculating, and cares so deeply about her own she can taste blood in her own mouth. She relaxes her jaw and forces herself to smile.</p><p>“No, I could never be anywhere else.”</p><p>“Oh… will you still like me if I’m not a Slytherin... like you?”</p><p>“Yes Daisy, you’re family, and nothing is more important than family. Besides blue suits you just as well as green” her sister smiles again, her soft brown hair gently curled. Pansy puts away her wand.</p><p>“There, all done” She claps her manicured hands, and gives her bedroom one last look over to make sure she hasn't missed anything. Things can of course be owled, but it’s such a pain to do so. </p><p> “Have you packed your trunk and given it to the elves? Nymphty will take it to the carriage” </p><p>“Yes Pans, I did that ages ago.” Daisy raises from the chair, and delicately smooths out her lilac skirt again “It’s all sorted. I sent Demeter ahead, Papa said she could fly to school. That it would be more comfortable?”</p><p>“He’s right, there is no point in bringing an owl on the train. Dreadful to be locked up in a cage for no reason when one has wings” </p><p>She picks up Philip, her british shorthair, who meows unhappily about being disturbed from his sunny pillow by the window. Putting him gently into his cage, the two girls leave the room. Walking down the long corridor past all the family portraits, a few wish them good luck with the school year, or to uphold the Parkinson name.</p><p>Their mothers portrait is empty as usual. Pansy tries not to let that affect her.</p><p>They continue on, walk in silence down the grand staircase. Their father stands in the foyer, sharp grey robes on, arms behind his back. If it weren't for his temples starting to gray and the wrinkles around his eyes he would look like he was a man still in his mid 30s instead of late 50s. </p><p>“I have a meeting at two at the ministry and can’t be late.” Lord Parkinson checks his silver pocket watch again, scowling, and motions for them to hurry into the carriage. </p><p>“Of course father”</p><p>“Dipper?” Her father's voice cuts across the marble room, with a sharp crack the house elf in question appeared.</p><p>“Yes Master?” The glassy eyed elf, rasps out. </p><p>“I will be dining in the red room tonight, see to it that the fire is lit and that I have a variety of whiskey set out on the table. Lord Greengrass will be joining me, you are dismissed.”</p><p>“Of course, Master” He bows deeply, his long nose almost touching the floor. Before disappearing again, as quickly as he came. </p><p>They get in the carriage without another word, and they’re off. </p><p>+++</p><p>Platform 9 ¾ is busy, witches and wizards of all ages rushing about, hugging their loved ones one last time before term. Steam rolling onto the platform from the large scarlet train.</p><p>Her father grimaced, at the chaos before making his way to the train. Quietly levitating their trunks behind him.</p><p>A few of the other people stop and nodded at Lord Parkinson. Pansy put up a bored expression on her face and linked her arm with Daisy. Her sister seemed calm, but she could feel little terrors of nerves or excitement through her arm. But before she could give any words of comfort, her fathers voice cut across sharply,</p><p>“Ah Julius, back from France then?” Lord Parkinson, sat down the trunks and shook hands with a slightly shorter but equally dark haired man. </p><p>“Nathaniel, always a pleasure. Yes, we got back last night, Emelia and I. You remember my daughter don't you? She’s been made a Prefect this year.” </p><p>“Of course. How do you do, young lady?”</p><p>“Very well, my Lord” Emilia said sweetly, before curtseying to Lord Parkinson and nodding at the girls. Daisy and Pansy did the same. Emelia however avoiding her eyes completely preferring to look away at the others students.  Pansy tired not to feel disappointed that the older girl didn’t look her way. </p><p>“Where is your lovely wife and son?”</p><p>“Oh they stayed behind a bit longer, Andrew is beginning his new job in the french ministry this fall, and Andrea couldn’t bear to be parted with him so quickly. You know how women are” Emelia's lips thinned but she stayed quiet. Pansy looked at the older girl, she was taller than herself, curvier but in the right way, as her mother would put it. A Ravenclaw, Pansy already knew this of course, she had seen her around in the halls. She was friends with some of the upper year Slytherins who studies on Saturdays in the library. Pouty lips and light brown eyes with long pinned up hair. Her hair was even darker than Pansy’s, almost as black as the night sky, she wondered what it would feel like to run her fingers through the long hair. Would it be soft? What would it smell-</p><p>“- but as much as I would like to chat, I miss set my daughters off. It’s daisy’s first year and Pantsy’s fourth.” Pansy snapped back with the mention of her name.</p><p>“Yes yes, plenty to do! Shall I see you at the gentleman's lunch on Thursdays? I seem to remember Lucius saying something about exotic meats from the colonies”</p><p>“Of course” Pansy and Daisy said their farewells and the two families parted ways. But not before Pansy could quickly look over her shoulder to watch Emelia and her father walk to the prefects compartment. </p><p>After her father had put away the trunks, he turned to them, looking serious</p><p>“Now you two be good, send a letter to me once you get to Hogwarts. I will be away on business the next two weeks, but will write back when I can. Make me proud”</p><p>“Of course father”</p><p>“Yes Papa”</p><p>“Take care of your sister Pansy”</p><p>“Yes father” he nodded curtly at her, seemingly satisfied. Before kissing them both quickly on the cheek and turning to walk away. </p><p>For a fleeting moment she allowed herself to think of her mother, smiling and hugging her goodbye during her first year, telling her to owl every day. Even if her father has called the behaviour unpropper. <em> Nathaniel I will hug our daughter goodbye for as long as I like, and you will be quiet if you have nothing nice to say, </em> her mother had said calmly. <em> She doesn’t need hugs, she needs to pull herself together to make a good impression! </em>Her father had hissed back, his face turning cold. </p><p>She clenched her fist, once, then twice. Long nails digging into the soft part of her palms. Red half crescent moons forming on her pale skin.  </p><p>“Come along now Daisy, let us find my friends, I'm sure some of yours will be with them as well. I have to introduce you to the other pureblood girls, impressions are everything after all.”</p><p> </p><p> </p>
