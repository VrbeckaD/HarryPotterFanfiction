  <strong>Crazy Crossovers – Up for Adoption (or laughs)</strong>
</p>
<p>Hello!!!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Well, I have to say that my imagination is hundreds of times stronger than my will to write unfortunately. Therefore, I will not deny this any longer and keep ‘potentially’ good ideas under lock down. I’ve decided to compile a list of crossovers with possible pointers and scenes (if there were any already written…not likely) and leave you, dear fellow writers, to decide whether you wish to take them up and bring them to life or tear them to pieces.</p>
<p>The stories are from various fandoms. Over the years I’ve lost track of how many ideas I had because I was barely into writing and never put down notes when they came. Some of them are from vague memories and may be downright silly and stupid but hey…when inspiration comes it slams!</p>
<p>I will try to put them into categories like Anime/ Cartoons/ Games/ Books etc. and generally give as much information as possible. If you adopt them, I do not expect you to follow the beats perfectly; those are <em>my thoughts</em> and <em>my way</em> of organizing the plot. You can take the overall concept if you like it.</p>
<p>Like I said, some of those stories are pretty vague and will probably feature one fandom over the other. That’s either because I’m not very familiar with the second one or because I didn’t bother to actually think of a plot that involves characters from both shows.</p>
<p>Oh, and before I forget! Pairings…yeah, no. Do whatever! Really, I don’t care! I choose to not focus on pairings in my stories because I feel like I’m purposely tripping myself. I usually write adventure and drama and add romance only when I can and it’s not even the main focus. Just background stuff…But you can do whatever you want as long as you send me the link to the story you make.</p>
<p>With that being said, let’s get going!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <strong>Anime/Cartoons</strong>
</p>
<p><em>Fate/Stay Night </em><strong>/</strong> <em>Danny Phantom</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>This story started out from another idea I had that involved Danny Fenton – main character from <em>Danny Phantom</em> – dying and becoming a full ghost. I admit I recently started watching the <em>Fate Series </em>and I am not that knowledgeable, if at all, about the lore of the universe. I’ve watched <em>Unlimited Bladeworks</em>, but it didn’t really catch me as<em> Fate/Zero </em>did.</p>
<p>All I know, or better said, all I <em>cared</em> about when coming up with this was the Grail War and how well the ghosts in <em>Danny Phantom</em> would fit in the Classes of the Heroic Spirits. I thought it was a fun concept to mull over…you know, just for kicks.</p>
<p>This is what I came up with:</p>
<p>
  <em>Servants:</em>
</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Lancer – Danny Phantom (I honestly prefer his alias to be only Phantom, guess I’m weird like that; and in my head canon Danny knows how to use a bo staff because of Maddie)</em></li>
<li><em>Rider – Lydia (I’m sure one of her tattoos can be rideable beings)</em></li>
<li><em>Berserker – Pariah Dark (he was the first thing that I thought of)</em></li>
<li><em>Assassin – Penelope Spectra</em></li>
<li><em>Caster – Desiree</em></li>
<li><em>Archer – Skulker</em></li>
<li><em>Saber – Fright Night</em></li>
</ul>
<p>
  <em>Masters (meh!):</em>
</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Sam Manson – Lancer (Phantom) because obviously!</em></li>
<li><em>Vlad Masters – Saber (Fright Night)</em></li>
<li><em>Freakshow – Rider (Lydia)</em></li>
<li><em>From here I just randomized them - </em></li>
<li><em>Paulina Sanchez – Caster (Desiree)</em></li>
<li><em>Maddie Fenton – Assassin (Spectra)</em></li>
<li><em>Valery Gray – Archer (Skulker)</em></li>
<li><em>Guys in White – Berserker (Pariah Dark)</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Now, even for a newbie I understand some things about <em>Fate</em> and I know this doesn’t make much sense. The Ghosts aren’t Heroic Spirits and the Masters aren’t Mages. But: 1. Imagination; 2. AU; and 3. The Holy Grail isn’t <strong>fair</strong>!</p>
<p>This is more of an adaptation than a crossover, but it can be both if you can make it work.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <strong>Anime(?)/Cartoons</strong>
</p>
<p>
  <em>RWBY <strong>/</strong> Danny Phantom</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This idea was just a spark of the moment. I love <em>RWBY</em> , it's a great series, with some bumps but still, and like <em>Fate, </em>it was more of ‘how would the characters be in another universe?’.</p>
<p>This is an AU of what if the characters from <em>Danny Phantom</em>  were in the <em>RWBY</em> universe. The only thing I ended up doing was settle on the main characters’ semblances (Danny, Sam, Tucker, Valerie and Jazz) and weapons. And that’s about it.</p>
<p>Oh, I also got this idea that everyone has dual weapons as a team theme.</p>
<p>(The name is hard…)</p>
<p>
  <em>D S J T – Team Desert (?)</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>D V S T – Team Dust</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <u>Danny Fenton </u>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Semblance: Ghostly Wail. He can generate powerful sound waves with his vocal cords that can destroy everything as far as 100 meters. It takes a lot of aura and can be damaging to his throat.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Weapon: Vitae &amp; Mors. Twin pistol swords that can be connected to form a broadsword. His gloves are imbued with Ice Dust.</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <u>Samantha Manson</u>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Semblance: Specter Walk. She can merge and travel super-fast through the shadows. She cannot attack when she’s in the shadows; it’s only a speed technique.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Weapon: Crimson &amp; Scarlet. Dual pistols strapped to her lower arms. On the back of her wrists there are short blades which she can use in close combat.</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <u>Jasmine Fenton</u>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Semblance: Soul Protect. She can generate shields that she can use for defense, or she can throw them as projectiles and turn them into platforms for offense. It takes a lot of concentration and a calm nature for precise control. It can also be exhausting to use it for long.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Weapon: Eveningstar &amp; Dawnbreaker. Gauntlets with cables that can be used as whips. Dust vials can be inserted and give the whips more power.</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <u>Tucker Foley</u>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Semblance: Apparition. He can teleport, instantly jump from one point to another as long as it is in his range of sight.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Weapon: Two laser pistols that can be connected at the bottom of the handle and be used at the same time with one hand.</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <u>Valery Gray</u>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Semblance: The Wall. She can cover her body with an impenetrable shield.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Materialization. She can imitate colors and patterns like a chameleon and blend in with her surroundings. She can be seen from up close or if someone has incredible sharp sight.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Weapon: The Red Hunt. A bazooka that can be separated into two tonfas.</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I also have some sketches for Danny’s weapons and I think Sam’s, but I need to look for them.</p>

  <strong>Anime/Books</strong>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Fullmetal Alchemist <strong>/</strong> Harry Potter</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I am a huge fan of both of these series but I will <em>never</em> write for them, especially <em>FMA</em>. I have a story started and published about <em>HP</em> and <em>Kingdom</em> <em>Hearts </em>back on FF.net but that will not come back. I’m not even sure where I was going with that. Anyway, I have a lot of respect for <em>FMA</em> and I don’t feel very confident writing for that series because I feel like Ed (read everyone) is too smart for me. I don’t wanna butcher anybody so I don’t wanna go into that.</p>
<p>Regarding <em>HP</em>, this story revolves around the twins, Fred and George Weasley. It happens after they left Hogwarts in the fifth book, when they are experimenting with their inventions and they, for some reason, delve into alchemy stuff and get accidentally transported to Amestris.</p>
<p>Thing is, I drew stuff from the first anime, how the gate is a portal to a different universe, but in my head-canon, the gate is something that only works if alchemy is involved. As in, if somebody does alchemy in <em>any</em> world, it will automatically connect to the gate and the world of <em>FMA</em>…as in the world of <em>FMA</em> is the source of alchemy and anybody that commits taboo in other worlds end up there, if they survive the price. Does that make any sense? </p>
<p>My point is that the twins end up in Amestris and are found by Edward and eventually taken in by him and the Rockbells. I thought whether to make a language separation and that would be the reason why Ed even pays them any attention but that’s up to you.</p>
<p>In the <em>FMA</em> timeline, everything happens after the Promised Day. I loved that ending but I also love badass alchemist Ed so if you can explain a way for him to keep his alchemy and save Al that would be great because the main thing in this story is that Fred and George learn alchemy from Ed and Al. And Ed is also a state alchemist because I enjoy team Mustang.</p>
<p>The rest of the story is nonexistent. This is what I have:</p>
<p>Fred and George Weasley experiment with their merchandise in their free time (shortly after they leave Hogwarts during the fifth book; they are 17) and they accidentally activate a transmutation circle that brings them to Amestris. They lose their magic in exchange and Fred loses his left arm as well(?).</p>
<p>They are found by Ed and he takes them to the hospital. They tell him what happened but Ed is skeptical, however, the fact that they don’t know anything convinces him. Ed is a little over 16, following the Promised Day, but he reasons that he knows too much about them now so he is somewhat responsible for them. He agrees to help them get back home and in order to do that he proposes to Fred to get an automail arm.</p>
<p>Following a two-year-old recovery, Fred and George start studying alchemy after wearing Ed down. In that time Winry moves to Central with Ed and Al where she opens an automail shop. Ed returns to the military as a State Allchemist while Al journeys to Xing and then returns to Amestris to study.</p>
<p>3 years since the twins arrived in Amestris, they live next to Ed and Al and work to fix daily objects with alchemy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <strong>Anime/Movies/Books</strong>
</p>
<p><em>Fate Series <strong>/</strong></em> <em>How to Train Your Dragon <strong>/</strong></em> <em>Harry Potter</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>I cannot take full credit for this. The story that kick started this annoying worm is called <em>‘Fate Ingens Cor’</em> by Ten-Faced Paladin from Fanfiction.net. It’s an amazing work, pretty long and can be found on Fanfiction in the <em>Fate/Stay Night </em><strong>/</strong><em> Harry Potter</em> category. I recommend you check it out and I won’t give any spoilers.</p>
<p>As usual when I read a good story and reach a point when there are no more chapters, I begin to fantasize and move the plot forward on my own. Most of the times it ends by adding a new fandom…yay me! This time the victim was from <em>How to Train Your Dragon</em>, to be more precise it’s Hiccup (duh!).</p>
<p>Again, no thoughts about the plot since everything was a spur of the moment thing but I thought about Hiccup’s powers as a Rider class Servant and a bit about his relationship with his Master, Neville Longbottom. I love Neville. Truth to be told, I never payed attention to him in the beginning but by the end of the books he definitely impressed me.</p>
<p>Now, Neville is the underdog. Like Hiccup. He is the boy who is shy, not good at much and with confidence issues. Like Hiccup. Their relationship is based on this likeliness and Hiccup’s belief that Neville will bloom and become a character worthy to be recognized the same way he was when he put an end to the Viking/Dragon war and all the, as of yet, historical non-canon things he’d done after becoming Chief. Hiccup is trying to help Neville come out of his shell and Neville is starting to realize what it means to stand up for yourself and for what you believe in. Neville’s motivation to win could be related to his parents, maybe punish Bellatrix Lestrange, stop Voldemort altogether, heal them so he could have his family back, something along those lines.</p>
<p>Hiccup would definitely be a Rider class Servant. He can summon dragons, individually for quick attacks or to protect Neville, or can activate his Reality Marble and have an entire army of dragons ready to torn his enemies apart at the snap of his fingers. I also like to think that Astrid had finally beaten some fighting skills into him, like swordsmanship. He has Inferno for that and the Flight Suit for other occasions if you wish.</p>
<p>Since Hiccup is known as the Dragon Conqueror, using dragons is a quick way to make his identity known so he usually doesn’t summon them unless absolutely necessary and battles using his quick thinking and sword skills. Hiccup is smart and reckless but he can make plans and analyze a situation on the fly. He deals well under stress and that’s when he shows his strong points.</p>

  <strong>Anime/Anime</strong>
</p>
<p><em>Bleach </em><strong>/</strong> <em>Shaman King</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <strong>Story 1</strong>
</p>
<p>This was a throwaway idea I had that I pondered on for about an hour before giving up. I’ve watched <em>Bleach</em> and eventually lost interest but <em>Shaman King</em> is something that I will always love. I think it’s the first anime I’ve watched and I had no idea it even was an anime at the time. (Discovering the manga was akin to Paradise!)</p>
<p>The story doesn’t follow the ending of either the anime nor the manga of <em>Shaman King</em> because Hao is still alive and taken in by Yoh. During the final battle, he is greatly weakened and loses the Spirit of Fire because the Patch Tribe took it back. The tournament is put on hold and while living in the same house as his brother and his crazy gang, Hao gets around to the fact that destroying non-shamans maybe wasn’t the way to reach peace.</p>
<p>I never thought that he would make an 180 and suddenly forgive humans, no way. Hao is still a sadistic asshole, he still is quick to jump the gun and he still goes into moral arguments with everyone but he is willing to listen at least. As far as the Patch Tribe and Anna are concerned, Hao is still a danger to the world but Yoh can be very stubborn. So they’re stuck with him.</p>
<p>Plot-wise, the story doesn’t go far. Since I doubt Hao’s ideals are unique to him, I thought about bringing a group who share his shaman-only world belief as the antagonists of the story. They mock him for his somewhat change of heart, saying he’s gone soft and that he’s not worthy to be looked up to as they did before. I think I imagined this scene and Hao handing them their asses because he’s epic like that (no matter how weak he may be), and the surprising return of the Spirit of Fire because Fire loves Hao no matter what the Patch says.</p>
<p>But this group of baddies isn’t that weak and useless and they bring out the Hollows which they unleash upon Tokyo for some reason… (to make a point?, declare war on the Patch?, insert another purpose?) </p>
<p>I chose to go with the Oversouls in the manga and also keep the Five Elemental Warriors thing. While I love the anime, the manga was a beast in terms of power-ups and the finale was much better.</p>
<p>The gang plus Hao does as expected and defend the city from the Hollows until the Shinigami show up. From there the plot is to take down the group of humans who can control Hollows either on their own or by working together. (In the <em>Bleach</em> timeline this can happen anytime, I didn’t give it much thought)</p>
<p>The premise of this story was that Shinigami are spirits and Shamans are humans who can communicate and fight <em>using</em> spirits. Soul Society is aware of their ‘race’ and of the Shaman King’s very important role of becoming one with the King of Spirits (The Spirit King) in order to bring balance to the world every 500 years. I suppose that this detail can be better integrated considering the new reveals in the <em>Bleach</em> manga of the Spirit King and his entourage. (I don’t know more than that though)</p>
<p>The purpose of this new group is something like taking the King of Spirits by force (kinda like what Hao tried in the anime), but using Hollows which automatically brings the Shinigami’s attention.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Story 2</strong>
</p>
<p>This story is in reverse to the other one as in, it focuses on the <em>Bleach</em> characters more. This is an AU and it’s about Orihime Inoue being a shaman, competing in the shaman tournament.</p>
<p>And now everyone, let’s welcome the first pre-written text of this list.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Start scene </em></li>
</ul>
<p>
  <em>Orihime Inoue was very happy. Clad in a long, dark orange dress split on both sides to show her beautiful legs and a white top with intricate tribal designs similar to the dress, she nearly skipped down the sidewalk of her hometown. Karakura Town was the same as always. The sky was bright, the people were happily chatting and there was no Hollow or other dangers of spiritual nature in sight. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>It has been nearly a year since Aizen was defeated and a couple of months since she had seen her friends before she had to leave to Tokyo. She was ecstatic to be back and couldn’t wait to tell everyone what she has been up to lately. She shyly peeked at her left forearm where a pager with a dark blue cover and silver metal feathers was firmly strapped. She couldn’t stop from smiling.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Her feet took her down streets she remembered with a tad bit of nostalgia. Soon enough she was at her old apartment, gazing with a soft smile at the building as memories of her brother, of that night when everything began resurfaced. She sighed thinking how much her friends would have changed in those months before deciding to head to the school. Maybe she could get lucky and catch Tatsuki, Ichigo, Chad or Uryu.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>________________________________________</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>By chance, when Orihime arrived the students were running off as the bell kept ringing and announcing the end of the last period. In the mass of bodies, Orihime’s keen senses spotted her best friends’ unmistakable spiritual signatures and she rushed in their direction. But before she could get there…</em>
</p>
<ul>
<li><em>End scene</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Disappointing, isn’t it? Yeah. That’s as far as I got.</p>
<p>Orihime is a character that I found annoying, then good, then meh, then annoying. She’s a damsel in distress but for some reason I like her. Her power is really cool and she has so much potential with it. I stopped watching <em>Bleach</em> after the Winter War, so I don’t know how Orihime is after the time skip. (I know I like her new design!)</p>
<p>It suddenly hit me one day that Orihime’s hairpins and spirit fairies are kind of like a shaman and their guardian ghosts. She’s doing Oversoul with the hairpins! It totally makes sense! She has a guardian ghost for attack, some for healing and others for shielding. So. Much. Potential!</p>
<p>The story takes place after the time skip in <em>Bleach</em> and after the preliminary rounds in <em>Shaman King</em>. Orihime qualified for the Gobi Village stage and she came back in Karakura to tell her friends what she’s been up to lately. Orihime is definitely stronger than before. She can fight Hollows and win, maybe not Arrancars but she can survive for a while at least. (Make her stronger dammit!)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <strong>Anime/Cartoons</strong>
</p>
<p><em>Naruto </em><strong>/</strong> <em>Xiaolin Showdown</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <strong>Story 1</strong>
</p>
<p><em>Xiaolin Showdown</em> is one of my all-time favorite shows. Before the disastrous reboot that won’t be spoken of, <em>Xiaolin</em> was my muse. It was what got me into writing in the first place and I still hold hope that I will come back to finish my old stuff…someday…</p>
<p>This story started about 10 years ago, back in high school when I used to spend more time doodling in my special ideas notebook than paying attention in class. I think I created more spin-offs on this idea than focusing on building up the world and the plot. The story deviates at the end of season 1 of <em>XS</em> when Raimundo is kicked out of the temple and he somehow travels to the Elemental Continent to start a new life. (Because that’s what 14-15-year-old kids with superpowers do! It makes total sense!)</p>
<p>The Elemental Continent is hidden from the rest of the world by a magical space-time barrier thingy. How he got there I don’t remember. Something that I do remember (and I’m actually embarrassed about) is that Raimundo was blood related to the Uchiha’s and unlocked the Sharingan during his stay there.</p>
<p>(This was during the part of the anime when the Sharingan was a badass power that made sense and not bullshit deux-ex-machina.)</p>
<p>Not much happens next and then the rest of the Xiaolin gang appears looking for a shen-gong-wu and lo and behold they meet the new and improved Raimundo. I’m sure I’m forgetting some things but I can’t find my old notes.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Story 2</strong>
</p>
<p>I called this one, are you ready? Ok…<em>Ninjas of the Soul</em>!</p>
<p>I honestly don’t remember this one, I only have some notes and a few paragraphs of story that are kinda pointless. I also noticed after reading my notes that the story is kinda cut off from the main plot of the <em>Naruto</em> series.</p>
<p>Basically, it’s another ‘how the characters from <em>Xiaolin Showdown</em> are in the <em>Naruto</em> world’ kind of story. It’s an AU, where everyone is born in the Hidden Leaf and are trained as ninja by Fung-sensei…and they battle this evil organization called the Heylin from taking over the Elemental Continent.</p>
<p>The story is that there are these energy points around the world and I think I somewhat remember thinking about this a long time ago and developing the story really well but from the notes I have…it couldn’t be further from the truth. I believe I was at the stage in which I didn’t write down in detail what’s going on with my plots and only used short 3-4 words descriptions because ‘I knew what’s what duh’.</p>
<p>So yeah, energy (chakra?) points around the world that when all activated they could like, blow shit up? I think Chase Young at the end stopped the whole thing but I seriously don’t know how, why, or what he was doing before…?</p>
<p>It’s very confusing and I put this here for kicks because I don’t know what’s up with this story, I just liked my monks in ninja garb I guess.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <strong>Anime/Cartoons</strong>
</p>
<p><em>Soul Eater</em> <strong>/</strong> <em>Danny Phantom</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>This is an AU that I made up while working on another <em>Danny Phantom</em> massive, crossover AU. It was a ‘what if?’ moment that honestly kept me interested for a few hours but not enough to actively work on it.</p>
<p>Pretty much, the Fentons are a family of Meisters with Maddie, naturally, being a badass graduate of Shibusen/DWMA, whichever you prefer. Her children, Danny and Jazz are also Meisters and they go to the school and are partners with Sam and Tucker(?) respectively. I was thinking of Sam being a scythe (because I love imagining Danny with a freaking scythe, I’m such a fangirl!) and Tucker (or somebody else dunno who though?) being some sort of gun (I’m not into guns, but something really technological cause it’s Tucker).</p>
<p>PS: <em>Soul Eater</em> ignited my love for scythes. As cumbersome and ill-suited for real life battle as they are…THEY LOOK COOL! And that’s all I need!</p>
<p> </p>

</p>
<p>
  <em>Danny Phantom</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Title: Green Twilight</p>
<p>This is really old. Beginning of high school old. And it involves high school too!</p>
<p>So I have a thing for Phantom. That was wrong. I have a thing for Phantom’s design and I also like stories where Danny is full ghost. I will put up a separate chapter for a huge fic idea that revolves around that too.</p>
<p>For now, in this AU, Danny has always been a ghost. There is no Danny Fenton. Instead, Danny is the King of the Ghost Zone and…I dunno, I guess he’s bored and he wants to try high school. Lol, no! I don’t have notes for this, remember: stage where I didn’t write down detailed synopsis, but I think there was a threat from humans and the ghosts decided to check it out. So with mumbo-jumbo cloaking amulets, Danny and Ember go to Casper high to get closer to Jazz and the Fentons and figure out what the threat is.</p>
<p>And now, the cringy scene…</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Start scene</em></li>
</ul>
<p>
  <em>The clouds swirled threateningly over the sky of Amity Park, shadowing the beautiful sights of the small city and succumbing them in a monotone abyss. The life was slowly warming up as the people woke up ready to begin another day. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>The morning air was cool and refreshing after the rain from last night and it lured every young soul back in their beds. But that unfortunately was impossible since it was Monday and all the youngsters gathered at Casper High, prepared for the homework and study induced torture.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>A boy and a girl ran down the street, knowing full well they were late since ‘somebody’ forgot to set the alarm clock. The girl slowed down scowling and resumed a more steady pace after seeing the school coming into view. The boy on the other hand continued to run and only stopped when he reached the gate.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>He turned around and waved a hand in the air as he shouted at his friend. “Would you hurry up? This is our first day!”</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>The girl’s frown deepened and she gripped tighter her school bag. “Shut up! I didn’t even want to come here…Why did I have to come anyway?”</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>The boy rolled his eyes and answered tapping his foot. “Be-cause you seem to be the only other sane person who can blend in and not trigger…too many…problems…”His voice trailed off making the girl smirk while raising a delicate eyebrow.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“Did you call yourself a sane person?” she chuckled and stopped beside him. “Really now, when you’ll be sane, I’ll be a Barbie doll!”</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>The boy rolled his eyes replying. “Now that’s a nightmare!”</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Together they entered the school evading as much as possible the students still running on the corridors. Their first stop was the Principal’s office. The duo quickly got their locker keys and schedules before rushing to their first class with one Mister Lancer. When they entered, the teacher was already at his desk and checking if everyone was present. He looked up when the two came in.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“Ah…I see the new students decided to finally come. Care to introduce yourselves to your classmates?” The boy shrugged smiling brightly while the girl just growled. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“My name is Daniel Sky but you can call me Danny.”</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“And I’m Ember McLain. Can we sit down now?”</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Ms. Lancer blinked and motioned for them to sit on two free seats in the back of the room before he continued the lesson.</em>
</p>
<ul>
<li><em>End scene</em></li>
</ul>
<p>
  <em> </em>
</p>
<p>Well, that’s about it for now! The next few ‘chapters’ I’ll put my more massive stories for which I didn’t write anything other than world building and random character notes and stuff like that…</p>
<p>Thank you for taking your time to read this and have an awesome day!</p>
<p> </p>

  <strong>Bonus round!</strong>

<p>Time for silliness!!!</p>

<p>
  <strong>Anime/Cartoons</strong>
</p>
<p><em>Shaman King <strong>/</strong></em> <em>W.I.T.C.H.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Yeah! I know…Let’s get this over with…</p>
<p>In my defense, this was one of the first crossover that ever crossed my mind. At the time I only knew both fandoms from the TV shows. <em>Shaman King</em> manga was nonexistent to me and the <em>W.I.T.C.H.</em> comics were unavailable and frankly I only cared about the show.</p>
<p>So I said, to hell with it! Yoh, and the totally by coincidence chosen Five Elemental Warriors, aren’t going to be shamans! They will be Guardians of the Veil and there would be love sparkling between them and the girls. And that’s final! Oh, and they’ll have wings and cool armor too!</p>
<p>All ridiculousness aside, I don’t remember much of the plot but I do remember a clash between the teams and that Yoh and co. had more experience in battle than the girls and that they trounced them bad. Then they all meet at Hay Lin’s grandma tea shop and the girls are surprised and yeah…<em>Behold the cringe!</em></p>
<p>It’s stupid and it doesn’t make sense but…crack fic? Parody?</p>

<p><em>Galactik Football <strong>/</strong></em> <em>Sonic the Hedgehog</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Yes, this happened as well!</p>
<p>This was a start to me expanding the world of Sonic the Hedgehog beyond their planet. And since Sonic is such a sucker for new things I figured he would be up for some extreme football. (Maybe he could invite Mario sometimes too!)</p>
<p>There is no plot, unless you count the one in <em>Galactik Football</em>. It was basically me liking two things and putting them together to enjoy the awesomeness. And I liked making charts and putting teams against each other, thinking who’s better and who can make it to the finals.</p>
<p>And I was like 12-13 and had no idea of the complexity and confusion that is the Sonic Universe.</p>
