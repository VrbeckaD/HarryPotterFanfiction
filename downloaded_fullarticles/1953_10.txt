    <p>The air around the castle is dense like the tension developing through every bone in his body. Screams are heard as the Dark Lord’s reign continues. Draco sneaks inside the castle, feet light under the flooring and his wand tightly in his grasp. Both Blaise and Pansy follow behind him, wands drawn and hexes on the tip of their tongues in case they are ambushed.</p><p>“I hate this,” Pansy whispers, her eyes shifting around the vestibule. “Are we almost there?”</p><p>“Almost,” Draco answers. He doesn’t turn, his gaze strictly in front of him. His shoulders are stiff and his jaw is clenched as they continue to move through the halls.</p><p>Even with the moonlight shimmering under the looming darkness of the night, it gives nothing but a melancholic ambiance. The air is acidic, bitter and sharp—a fetor of metal intertwining in the ether. With every minute passing, the shadows grow larger and wider, casting an everlasting dejected tenor in the once blithe citadel.</p><p>The trio stop in front of the Headmaster’s office. Once inside, Blaise barricades the doors and stands by it.</p><p>“I’ll keep guard. Get what you need and let’s go.” Blaise speaks, his face pale with a bruise forming under his eye.</p><p>The pair nod and make their way over to the large desk. Draco wanders around the office, eyesight flickering over everything with a newfound emotion of guilt before he stops in front of the table. With shaking hands, he flips through the paperwork and opens every drawer. Pansy, who is to his right, doing the same. What they are looking for isn’t here and it disappoints him. Just as he’s about to give up, he notices one drawer is left untouched.</p><p>“Did you try opening this one?” He questions, looking up at Pansy who turns to him with furrowed brows.</p><p>Pansy shakes her head, “No.” She reaches over and pulls on it but the drawer doesn’t budge. Taking her wand out, she tries another approach. “Alohomora!”</p><p>But still, the drawer doesn’t open. Draco tries pulling it once more before sighing and pointing the wand at the desk and looking over his shoulder. “Pans, you might want to move.” Pansy tenses before nodding, she steps back and ducks behind one of the bookcases. Draco turns back to the task at hand. “Expulso!”</p><p>A blue mist blasts through the tip of the wand, hitting the drawer. The detonation is powerful enough that it not only opens the drawer but destroys half of the desk. The wooden counter is coated in soot and smog. Blaise coughs slightly, casting him a glare. Draco shrugs and tugs on the drawer, hissing as the heat from the eruption burns his palm, leaving an angry red singe on his skin. Pansy comes around and stands by him, her silent form of support. They both hold their breath as they get a glimpse of the device inside the compartment.</p><p>With a shaky breath in, Draco grabs the device, his fingers gently grasping on the golden chain. He slowly pulls it out, feeling the heavy gazes from both Pansy and Blaise on him as he finally has the Time-Turner in his possession. Draco bites his lip, gripping the device gently between his fingers, looking over at his two friends.</p><p>“You think it’ll work?” Pansy murmurs, her eyes wide with a mixture of apprehension and hope.</p><p>“It has to,” Draco breathes, clutching the Time-Turner tightly before putting the chain around his neck, hiding the utensil under his shirt; the cold metal pressing right above his heart. He adjusts his black blazer over his shirt and nods. “Let’s get out of here.”</p><p>The trio leaves the office and round the corner. The three aren’t actively part of the Death Eaters and their regnant over the castle. Once Dumbledore was killed, Draco was taken back to Malfoy Manor, he was so agitated he called over Pansy and Blaise who risked their lives just to be with him. In the end, the three agreed that this is going too far. Sure, blood purity is something that was engraved into their minds since they were able to understand it but seeing their previous headmaster lifeless and the Dark Mark in the sky is a quick reality check.</p><p>Knowing the Dark Lord wants nothing more than to get his grubby hands on the Elder Wand, Draco keeps it hidden in his person and escapes the manor with his two friends. Their plan is to get the Time-Turner from Dumbledore’s office, knowing it only takes you back a few hours but that’s exactly what they need. Just a few hours to stop Dumbledore’s death and make sure Draco doesn’t let the Death Eaters into the castle.</p><p>And now here they are, trying to avoid confrontation as they find a way out of the campus grounds to apparate back to Pansy’s place; where they can take the next step of their plan without the fear of being caught.</p><p>As they are about to exit the castle, they tense when they notice someone stepping out from the shadows. It’s Crabbe. He is wearing all black, a wand in hand and a distant expression on his face.</p><p>“Where are you going?” He questions, taking a few steps closer, making the trio step back. He raises an eyebrow at their actions, his wand twirling between his fingers on his right hand. “Well?”</p><p>Pansy steps forward, “We’re leaving.” She squares her shoulders, a sneer evident on her face even with the heavy darkness in the hall. “So I suggest you move.”</p><p>“Pansy,” Blaise hisses, his eyebrows furrowed as he grips his wand tightly.</p><p>Crabbe’s eyes dance in malicious mirth, “Is that so?” He turns to Draco. “Shouldn’t you be in the manor with your parents?”</p><p>“Shouldn’t you be there, too?” Draco retaliates, holding his ground.</p><p>The sound of footsteps approaches, Draco swallows the lump forming in his throat before licking his dry lips. Blaise looks behind his shoulder, a bead of sweat running down his forehead as he turns back to Crabbe who is still blocking their way out. Pansy’s eyesight is locked on Crabbe, her fingers twitching in anticipation to hex the bastard so they can escape.</p><p>Before any of the four could do anything, a howl is heard from outside the castle. The sound temporarily distracts Crabbe, who turns to see where it is coming from. Pansy takes advantage and raises her wand.</p><p>“Flipendo!” A bright blue mist hits Crabbe right on his back, the Knockback Jinx propelling him against the wall. The force is strong enough that the wall trembles, causing rubble from the ceiling to descend around his fallen body. Pansy turns to her friends, “Let’s go!”</p><p>The trio run past Crabbe’s body and out of the castle, the sound of voices and footsteps grow louder as the door closes behind them. The air is frigid over Draco’s skin but he continues to run. Pansy is running in front of him and Blaise behind him, they both look just as determined to escape as he does. Draco could almost taste freedom.</p><p>Just as they are about to reach the area where the anti-apparition jinx ends, a green light flashes behind them.</p><p>“Avada Kedavra!”</p><p>It’s almost like slow motion as the green flash travels past Blaise and Draco and heads directly towards Pansy’s direction. She turns, her face morphing from confusion to betrayal as her eyes widen and her mouth opens slightly. Draco and Blaise run to her but it’s too late. The spell hits her right between her eyes, the momentum of the spell harshly ramming her limp body into one of the nearby trees in the Forbidden Forest.</p><p>“Pansy!” Both Draco and Blaise call out as they sprint to her fallen body.</p><p>Draco feels his blood run cold once he gets one look at Pansy’s face. Her eyes are open, the dark irises are lifeless and gelid. He turns to see Blaise getting on his knees next to her, his fingers tremble as he cradles Pansy’s face in his hands. Angry tears glide down Draco’s cheeks as he turns to the assailant.</p><p>Fury burns in his bones as he watches Crabbe step closer, a reluctant Goyle behind him with three other hooded figures.</p><p>“You bastard!” Draco hisses, switching his wand for the Elder Wand. “She was your friend!”</p><p>Goyle’s face morphs into remorse but Crabbe’s expression is stoic. He flickers his gaze from Draco to Pansy’s body. “There is no such thing as friends.” With that, he raises his wand. “Crucio!”</p><p>Draco didn’t even get a chance to blink as he is shouldered into the ground which leads the spell to miss him. He turns, Blaise is on the grass with him. They share a look before nodding and retaliating. The two use spell after spell, working together against two former friends and three Death Eaters. Blaise manages to use a full-body bind on Goyle and two Death Eaters while Draco uses stunner on the last Death Eater; leaving Crabbe alone against the two of them.</p><p>“You were always shit at dueling.” Blaise taunts.</p><p>Crabbe wheezes slightly before his frown turns into an ugly sharp smile. “Yeah? Wasn’t so bad when I hit Pansy.” Before either could say anything, he raises his wand once more. “Avada Kedavra!”</p><p>The spell is directed at Draco this time. He’s busy attempting to catch his own breath that he isn’t able to react in time. All he sees is Crabbe a few feet away from him with his wand raised before a green mist of light fills his vision.</p><p>This is it.</p><p>This is how it ends.</p><p>A vision of faces flicker in his mind; his mother and father, Pansy and Blaise, Severus and Dumbledore—even Harry Potter. His mind wanders back to the first day he attempts to befriend Potter and how he rejected him. Regret fills Draco as he recalls where all those recurring mistakes lead him. This is the path he chose, he is going to die at the hands of a friend and if that isn’t karma, he doesn’t know what is.</p><p>Just as the spell hit Draco in the chest, right over the Time-Turner, he feels an extra body weight on his own. He turns to see Blaise wrapping his arms around him, his face full of terror as he tries to tackle him to the floor once more but Blaise isn’t quick enough.</p><p>The two stiffen as time stops and their bodies freeze in midair. Draco looks down at his chest, a golden mist illuminates from underneath his shirt before it grows bigger and surrounds both of their bodies. The golden haze increases and becomes turbulent as it swirls in the air around them. Terror overflows Draco’s veins as everything around him disintegrates in front of his eyes and he falls into the deep darkness with open arms.</p>
