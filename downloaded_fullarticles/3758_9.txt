</p><p>"Have a biscuit, Remus."</p><p>"Thank you, Minerva." He smiled warmly, digging a ginger snap from the proffered tin. "What can I do for you?" he asked as he bit in.</p><p>"It's a wonderful problem to have, don't mistake me," McGonagall sighed from behind the Headmistress's desk, handing over a long piece of parchment. No less than three dozen names were listed; a quarter of the names had sharp little checks next to them. "We haven't had this many Muggleborns on the register in nearly a century! But I only have so much time to make these visits, and Filius won't return for another three weeks, Hagrid is still in Romania, Neville can't be spared from Greenhouse Ten... I'm afraid I have to start cutting the holidays short for the rest of our staff if we're to get anywhere with this list before August."</p><p>"I certainly don't mind," Remus said amicably, scanning the parchment.</p><p align="center">

  <u>Aberdeen, Scotland:</u>
  <br/>
  <em>Charming, Alexander<br/></em>
  <em>Charming, Arthur</em>
</p><p>"You've tackled the first few, but I'd've thought you'd prefer to start in your very own Scotland?"</p><p>McGonagall gave him a sharp look over her spectacles. "Don't think I haven't noticed those little parcels you squirrel away every month. I suspect I won't have to twist your arm to get you to visit Charming Chocolates in person."</p><p>"Do you know," Remus grinned broadly, "it'll be my first proper visit? Found them in a Muggle mail-order catalog at the Hogsmeade post office."</p><p>"Well, now they can put a face to the name for their best customer," she quipped fondly. "Perhaps make your purchases first, I rather think they might close up for the day when you start with the spells."</p><p>Remus left the office with a happy flutter in his chest, browsing the rest of the list. He set an ambitious goal for himself: three visits in one day. That would certainly earn him a guilt-free box of chocolates from his favorite shop. A spring in his step, Remus set out to Kent to visit one <em>Langley, Imogen.</em></p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Six hours later, Remus hustled down a street teeming with couples, families, kids, and teenagers. The crowd around him moved lazily in the summer heat; people wandered aimlessly in and out of the quaint little shops and restaurants that dotted Bell Street. He tried not to get impatient, but intense smells and loud noises pressed in on him from all sides. His patched Muggle clothes scratched at his skin every time someone brushed by and he very much wanted to call it a day and Apparate back home to Teddy.</p><p>But he had promised himself a heaping box of chocolates if he could make three visits today, and by Merlin he would get it.</p><p>Charming Chocolates was a tiny establishment squeezed between a loudly colored tea shop and a boutique that seemed to mostly cater to elderly women. Bright red awning, trimmed in gold, covered the front of the chocolate shop, and a matching red door carried a sign:<em> "Our family business closes at 7:00 sharp." </em> His watch read 6:55pm and with a panicked lurch in his stomach, Remus barged through the door.</p><p>If he was uncomfortable on the crowded street, he was in hell now. The shop was no bigger on the inside than it looked on the outside - <em>Muggles</em>, he reminded himself, <em>have to make do without wizard space </em>- and it was packed with shelves, bins, chocolates, and people. A dark wooden floor, old, scratched, and polished; a matching dark wooden ceiling with low beams that nearly touched Remus's head and did not improve his claustrophobia. There were too many colors, sounds, and smells to distinguish. Even the walls were busy: floor to ceiling, the cream-colored walls were covered in neatly arranged shelves, newspaper cut-outs, photos, even sketches and paintings. He couldn't even begin to guess what a blond man sporting an archer's kit had to do with chocolates, but he was the subject of several posted drawings.</p><p>"Welcome tae Charming Chocolates!" a friendly Scottish man called out from the left, somewhere near the front counter. "We close in five, so get to it!" Remus nodded vaguely in the direction of the voice and shuffled through the crowd, heading for a more deserted back corner.</p><p>True to his word, the man at the counter seemed determined to close up shop despite the potential for business on a mild summer night. He cleared the crowd at top speed and within minutes, Remus found himself the last customer.</p><p>The shop looked completely different when it was deserted: modest in size, it featured several narrow display cases crammed together in the middle of the room, showing off an enticing array of shiny chocolates, cheerful gift-boxes, and brightly colored foil. Behind the long front counter was a door with a gold hand-plate on it - presumably to push through to the kitchen - and a doorway that revealed a lopsided set of stairs leading up.</p><p>"Check out now or come back tomorrow, ma friend!" the Scotsman called, closing the cash drawer. "Got tae get dinner started fer the wee ones."</p><p>"Actually, I'm here to speak with the family of Alexander and Arthur Charming," Remus began, pulling out two identical sealed letters.</p><p>"Are ye?" he seemed delighted with the surprise. "An' what d'ye want wae ma boys?" The man lifted a section of the counter and stepped through, hurrying over to the door. In one smooth motion, he flipped the sign to closed and locked the door. Then he waved cheerily through the window at the disappointed face of a young woman on the other side. He was a stout man, average height with thick arms that were covered in coarse hair. Golden-brown curls on his head and rosy cheeks made him look like a child that had gotten hold of a wand and tried to disguise himself into an adult.</p><p>"My name is Remus Lupin, I work for a school in Northern Scotland," he went on. "I was hoping to sit down with your family to discuss your boys' acceptance into our program." Program. One of the Muggle parents earlier that day had used that word to describe Hogwarts. It seemed fitting.</p><p>"Remus Lupin, ye say? Ha!" the man said, lighting up. "I bleedin' well know our <em>preferred customers</em>, mate, even the mail-order ones! An' this ain' a ploy to get free - "</p><p>A loud series of crashes and bangs foretold the arrival of a young boy from upstairs. He stumbled and fell down the last few steps, collapsing in a heap on the ground behind the counter. The crashing continued as a large contraption bounced down the stairs behind him, finally breaking apart into pieces around him. The horn of a gramophone skittered and spun around madly across the floor, eventually coming to a rest at Remus's feet on the other side of the counter. There was a resounding silence as the boy cringed on the floor, hiding his face, and then the man launched into a cacophony of laughter, swears, and accusations.</p><p>"...stealin' ya brother's gadgets all a'time! And jus' where were'ya goin' in such a hurry, curry? Runnin' from Alec, no doubt!"</p><p>Remus thought he heard the ceiling creak, as if someone were walking around upstairs right above him. He didn't give it much thought - there were at least two Charming children in residence, after all. Then the boy climbed to his feet and lifted his head, looking perfectly contrite, and Remus felt all the air in his lungs whoosh out at once. He had seen that look a thousand times, he himself had helped James Potter <em>perfect </em>that look and later he saw young Harry wear it in his third year as Remus scolded him for sneaking out -</p><p>"Sorry, Monty," Arthur Charming mumbled.</p><p><em>"'Sorry, Monty'?!" </em>the man echoed incredulously. "'Sorry, Monty,' s'all a ever hear from ya, but never a word'a explanation, no! Up tae no good, a know better!" Monty's back was to Remus and therefore the man missed the moment Remus's brain fizzled to a stop upon hearing those words directed into a young James Potter's face. It was his Hogwarts days - no, it was Harry's third year all over again! "Now tell me," Monty's voice dropped to a conspiratorial whisper. "Wha's the scam?" The ceiling over Remus's head creaked again - someone was definitely walking around upstairs. Why hadn't they come down to investigate the ruckus? And what was a young Potter lookalike doing in Charming Chocolates?!</p><p>"No scam!" Arthur replied quickly, hands twisting in his obnoxiously yellow shirt. "I was helpin' Alec move some things around and - "</p><p>"Ha!" Monty barked loudly, stooping low to lift up a jagged piece of whatever Muggle contraption had broken apart. "Tha's a load! ALEC!"</p><p>Arthur winced and within moments another set of feet thumped down the stairs, a bit more gracefully this time. An identical boy - brown skin, black hair, wide eyes - dressed in more muted colors stopped at the bottom step, taking in the destruction on the floor with obvious distress.</p><p>"Arty, you absolute shit!" he cried. "I <em>told </em>you!"</p><p>"Oi, watch yer language!" the man scolded.</p><p>Arthur seemed determined to avoid his brother's accusatory gaze and instead looked anywhere else - eventually noticing Remus.</p><p><em>"Montyyy," </em>he nudged the man insistently as Alec began picking up the pieces dejectedly. "Still gotta customer."</p><p>"Don' think a customer'll get ye outta trouble, ye chicken nugget!" Monty looked ready to launch into another tirade and Remus finally broke through his shock.</p><p>"Alexander and Arthur Charming?" he croaked, blinking rapidly against the bizarre image of <em>two Potter boys </em>staring back at him curiously. He stepped forward and cleared his throat, running nervous fingers along the envelopes in his hands. "Is your mother around? This is usually a conversation best had as a family."</p><p>The boys grimaced and Monty rolled his eyes. "You'll wan' James then," he said.</p><p>"James?" The name sent a new wave of static through his brain as he stared at the fidgeting boys.</p><p>"Their father."</p><p>"I-I'm sorry, I thought you were - " Remus stammered. Didn't this man call them <em>his boys </em>earlier?</p><p>"Their other father," Monty returned quickly, smirking in a way that was nothing less than a challenge. The boys narrowed their eyes, a united front, and Remus suddenly felt warm around the collar.</p><p>"Sorry!" he spluttered. "Sorry, I apologize, I'm not - I'm not making a very good impression, am I?" he laughed, sounding manic. Monty quirked a brow. "I only - your boys here, they remind me so much of someone I once knew, years ago," he confessed. "Spitting image, really, only without the glasses."</p><p>"Da' wears glasses," Alec muttered. Remus's gaze flicked over to Monty automatically before he remembered there was another father. James.</p><p>"So 'e does," Monty conceded, relaxing slightly. "Is that your man there?" he asked casually, pointing a thick finger to a small framed photo that hung on the wall next to the stairway. Remus stepped a bit awkwardly through the opening of the counter and peered at the photo curiously, only to feel his stomach drop out of him.</p><p>It was a Muggle photo taken outdoors somewhere, perhaps a park. Arthur and Alec posed in front of a relatively young man that had draped himself over their shoulders, grinning broadly at the camera as he curled his arms up and ruffled the hair of each boy. The man wore a beaten up Muggle cap on his head but Remus could see locks of wild black hair poking out from under it. Most damning of all, though mostly obscured by the hat, was a familiar jagged line that cut down from his forehead over his right eye, looking very much like the tail-end of a bolt of lightning. And those green eyes sparkled at him, happily...</p><p>"Y'alright?" Monty asked, poking Remus in the shoulder a bit harder than was strictly necessary.</p><p>Remus coughed, attempted to clear his throat, and promptly began choking.</p><p>"Er..." Arthur said, staring up at him warily. "D'ye need some water or somethin'?"</p><p>Remus felt his face turning red as he tried to suck down some air, but he managed to shake his head in the negative. He could hardly think for want of air, but he knew he was making a decidedly poor first impression.</p><p>A glass of water was pushed into his hands anyway and when he eventually managed to drink it down, he felt better...until he glanced at the photo again.</p><p>"Do you know," he rasped dumbly, "it's like looking at his twin." <em>Harry is alive. Harry has a family. Harry is behind Charming Chocolates! </em>Remus didn't know what was going on, but he knew he needed to recover this moment, and he needed some help.</p><p>"That may be," Monty answered quietly, sounding strange. All three shared a mysterious look that Remus had no hope of understanding as he thought rapidly of how to recover.</p><p>"Is he around? J-James?"</p><p>"He'll be home in an hour with take-away," Arthur said, his Scottish accent much lighter than Monty's but still very much present. Frankly, it was surreal to hear that accent from a Potter clone. <em>Like James and his spot-on McGonagall impressions!</em></p><p>"Right, I can return then if you'll pardon the interruption to dinner," Remus said quickly. "I really must insist that both parents are present. It's very important, you see. Very important. Yes, you'll understand once I explain the program, there's quite a bit to go through - "</p><p>"Program?" Alec asked.</p><p>"What program?" said Arthur.</p><p>"Mr. Lupin comes from a school," Monty explained, still staring oddly at Remus. "Wants tae talk t'ye both."</p><p>"We've got a school lined up for next term," Arthur said. "Da' said it's all settled."</p><p>"We've got our uniforms," his brother added.</p><p>"You'll want to hear about Hogw - er, our program," Remus insisted. "Trust me. Shall I return at eight o'clock?"</p><p>Monty sighed in a long-suffering way that made Remus think he was trying to sound more put-upon than he actually was, before nodding. Remus went to let himself out the front door but only succeeded in crashing into it before remembering to turn the lock. With a parting wave at the little family that watched him - <em>Harry's little family </em>- he escaped back onto the busy street.</p><p>The moment he deemed the adjacent alley clear, he Apparated back to Hogsmeade and took off at a sprint toward Hogwarts.<br/><br/><br/></p><hr/><p> </p><p>An hour later he returned with McGonagall, windswept and breathless. She had listened with rapt attention to his frantic story before she tore into a drawer of personal belongings, retrieved an old photograph, and dragged Remus back out of Hogwarts. Sometimes she hardly seemed to need a cane, but it was at her side anyway, clunking away with every hurried step.</p><p>"I don't want your hopes to be dashed if this doesn't turn out, Remus," she said, her voice oddly gentle against the firm line of her mouth as she followed him down the street toward Charming Chocolates. It was darker now, the street lights were on and the crowd was just beginning to thin. "And not a word of this to his friends until we're certain."</p><p>"It's him, Minerva," he insisted for what felt like the hundredth time in an hour. "You'll see!" He hadn't lost that manic feeling since he saw the photo on the wall. He could hardly feel his feet as they carried him closer to the shop. To Harry.</p><p>"Do you need a Calming Draught?" she asked.</p><p>"Do you have one on you?" To his surprise, she offered him a dainty mesh bag of all-too-familiar lemon drops. He chuckled to himself as he popped one in his mouth. Trust Dumbledore to lace his candy with potions…</p><p>It was a fraction of a dose, but it calmed the shaking in his limbs and that was enough. She returned the bag of candy to her plain black robes - which seemed to be passing in the dark light of the evening as a modest Muggle dress - just as they reached their destination.</p><p>With a steadying breath, Remus reached out and pulled firmly on the doorknob.</p><p>The door clanged against its frame but didn't open.</p><p>
  <em>"Son of a - "</em>
</p><p>"Mr. Lupin!" McGonagall hissed as a figure approached from the other side of the door.</p><p>"Ah, the prodigal professor returns!" came Monty's voice, slightly muffled through the window of the door. A lock clicked and the door swung open. "And 'e's brought reinforcement!"</p><p>"Minerva McGonagall, Headmistress of Hogwarts," she answered in an accent that was suddenly thicker than anything Remus had ever heard from her.</p><p>"Hogwarts?" Monty snorted, stepping aside and gesturing them inside. "Funny name for a school."</p><p>"It's a funny school..." Remus muttered as the strong smell of curry hit his nostrils. Mixed with the sweet scent of chocolate, it was an oddly specific combination that threw him back to his sixth year Christmas holidays at the Potter cottage. He could almost hear Euphemia Potter singing in the kitchen, just out of sight, while the Marauders tore apart the house in raucous holiday fun.</p><p>"James's unpackin' the food now, have you eaten?"</p><p>"We couldn't impose - " he started, suddenly feeling mortified at the intrusion into Harry's new life. <em>He's clearly run away from us for some reason and we're just barging in to ruin what he's spent twelve years building, </em>he thought in horror, <em>and interrupting dinner while we're at it! </em>This was an awful idea. What was he thinking? He should have sucked down a lemon drop earlier, he obviously hadn't been thinking clearly when he went tattling to McGonagall, he had to fix this or Harry would hate him forever -</p><p>"Too late for that, come on through!" Monty clapped a warm hand on his shoulder and shoved him through the door behind the front counter.</p><p>It swung open to reveal a kitchen the same size as the rest of the shop. A shiny white tile floor and deep red walls greeted him. To the left, old appliances and a huge oven hood took up two walls with a large rack of pots and pans hanging overhead. A spacious island-counter across the middle of the room was covered in neatly-arranged trays of neatly-arranged chocolate drops. With an odd jolt, Remus recognized these treats from the first Charming Chocolates variety-box he had requested via mail-order three years ago.</p><p>The other two walls were more homely; less for business, more for family. A heavy wooden table, looking centuries old and impossible to move, jutted out from the wall on the right, some half-dozen mismatched wooden chairs surrounding it. Books and comics were stacked up neatly on the end that was nestled against the wall, and the strangest metallic figure stood at the head of the table:</p><p>The short, human-like figure seemed to be made of a hodgepodge of metal and plastic Muggle items. Exposed wires running the length of its "body" were neatly cinched together at regular intervals with plastic ties. Bright, colorful paint gave the illusion of an alien creature wearing modern Muggle fashion. Remus guessed that the artist may have meant for its creation to sport blue skin, red hair, and yellow overalls, but that was the extent of his coherent thoughts on the...thing.</p><p>"James?" Monty called out, leading Remus to a seat next to the Thing. He nervously pulled out the chair but couldn't bring himself to sit, lest he find himself eye-level with that expressionless painted face. "There ye are..."</p><p>Remus nearly forgot why they were there until he heard McGonagall gasp quietly next to him. She gripped her cane with white knuckles and stared over the head of the Thing as a man emerged from a large pantry, a stack of plates in one hand and a cane of his own in the other.</p><p>It was a testament to Dumbledore's old drugged candy that Remus didn't fall to the floor in a dead faint at the sight before him. Harry Potter limped over to the other side of the table and began distributing plates, giving his guests a polite but vague smile. He was much older than when Remus had seen him last - obviously twelve years older, he was just about thirty now! His untamed hair was streaked with greys and his forehead creased into wrinkles as he took in their expressions. Harry shot a questioning look at Monty, who shrugged and made a quick, strange gesture with his hands in reply. Whatever it was, it must have made sense to Harry because he gave a careless shrug in reply and finished placing the plates.</p><p>"BOYS!" Monty called. Remus and McGonagall had yet to make a move since Harry's entrance, even when Harry clearly gestured for them to take their seats. Remus wanted to stop staring, wanted to play along with Harry's casual act, but he was stuck...he didn't think he'd ever be unstuck again in his life.</p><p>"Mr. Charming, is it?" McGonagall finally spoke. Harry nodded. <em>Liar! </em>"I haven't had curry in years. Thank you for your hospitality."</p><p>Harry offered another small smile and gestured again for them to sit as he took the seat across from Remus. McGonagall sat primly and Remus fell into his seat, scraping the chair on the tile. When Harry leaned his cane (which was painted in a hundred dazzling colors with tiny, seemingly random brushstrokes) against the Thing, an alarming whirring-noise started up from within the Thing's depths. Harry shot it a quelling look and Remus was even more alarmed when the whirring settled back into nothing. <em>Is it sentient?</em></p><p>Footsteps thundered down the stairs behind them and soon they were joined at the table by the twins. Monty sat at Harry's side, Arthur next to Monty, and Alec took the remaining seat next to McGonagall. The Thing clunked ominously at the head of the table.</p><p>"Well," Monty said after an awkward pause. "Tuck in!"</p><p>The boys didn't need telling twice. They dove into the packages and loaded their plates with more food than Remus thought they could possibly eat in a single day, but there was plenty to go around. Numbly, he reached out and spooned some rice, chicken, and curry onto his plate, accepting a couple of samosas and a piece of naan as the various takeout dishes traveled around the table.</p><p>The kitchen was silent with the exception of a few passing remarks from the boys. Monty grunted his approval for some dishes, but otherwise the meal was spent in relative quiet. Remus felt the tension in the air like a vice on his head, getting tighter with each blank, curious, or polite look he received from Harry.</p><p>"'McGonagall' did ye say your name was?" Monty asked as they finished their last bites.</p><p>"Call me Minerva," she replied, looking from Harry to Monty to Harry again. "I am sorry, I didn't catch your - "</p><p>"Montgomery Gibbs," came the reply. "Monty, if ye please."</p><p>"A pleasure, Monty." But McGonagall was staring at Harry as she said it, confusion apparent on her face.</p><p>"James and a've been together for two years now," Monty explained, clearly thinking to clear up her confusion. "Known each other for a spell before then too - "</p><p>"A spell?!" Remus repeated loudly, like a git.</p><p>"Er - tha's an expression, right? 'For a spell'? Did a get it wrong?" Monty turned to Harry who smirked and nudged their shoulders together in answer. "Not much of a reader, but am sure tha's a saying."</p><p>"Sorry," Remus recovered, wondering how many times in a day he would find himself apologizing to this man. "Only, that brings us to the subject at hand."</p><p>"Reading?" said Alec, wrinkling his nose.</p><p>"Spells," McGonagall corrected.</p><p>Silence descended again and Remus watched Harry's face intently as this unspoken but definite line was crossed. He cringed, waiting for the inevitable explosion of Harry's infamous temper...</p><p>But none came.</p><p>Harry simply blinked at McGonagall, his eyebrows lifted slightly in politely masked incredulity. No tension in the shoulders, no grinding of the teeth, no narrowing of the eyes behind those odd rectangular glasses. Just the same as the other Muggle families Remus had visited earlier that day; Harry was displaying all the mannerisms of a polite Muggle father who found himself entertaining a couple of nutcases for dinner.</p><p>McGonagall took over from there. She delivered the letters to the boys - when had she lifted those from Remus's pocket? - who read them with all the usual shock and awe and disbelief that always came from Muggleborns. She demonstrated a few simple spells: Arthur and Alec gave identical squeals of surprise when their chairs began floating, and then Arthur became disturbingly well-adjusted to the idea and attempted to stand up while the chair lifted him toward the ceiling.</p><p>Harry stood abruptly, but he only looked confused and worried, like any Muggle father whose children had just started riding gravity-challenged furniture round the kitchen. McGonagall brought the giggling, chattering boys back down. Arthur looked disappointed but gleeful while Alec's eyes were burning with curiosity. The boys launched into a thousand questions, and Monty barked some of his own for good measure. Sitting once more, Harry took in the scene with huge eyes. He chewed on his lip and traced patterns in the woodgrain of the table. He said nothing.</p><p>Now <em>that </em>was different from the other parents of Muggleborn children. They always had loads of questions or theories to support their skepticism. <em>Always</em>.</p><p>"Are you alright, James?" Remus asked quietly. It occurred to him in that moment that Harry had never invited them to call him anything but 'Mr. Charming.' In fact, Harry had yet to say a word.</p><p>Harry's familiar green eyes landed on him but there was no familiarity in his gaze. Just confusion, worry, impatience… Complete and utter confusion.</p><p>"You don't recognize us?" Remus breathed. Harry's eyes widened and he turned to Monty, pulling on his arm to get his attention. Harry began waving his hands about, making a series of gestures that were too specific to be meaningless…</p><p>Remus nearly lost his dinner. Harry was using sign language?!</p><p>Monty shot Remus a mysterious look before using his own hands to reply to Harry. But then Harry spotted Alec watching from across the table, where McGonagall and Arthur were deep in conversation; Harry pulled Monty's hands down and ducked his head closer so Monty could whisper in his ear instead.</p><p><em>So he can hear… Is it a code then? Why isn't he speaking? Why is he using a cane? Why doesn't he </em>know <em>us?!</em></p><p>The Thing next to Remus suddenly whirred back to life and he startled when its copper-coil eyes began glowing. Alec gave a cry of triumph and pointed across the table, his fathers' conversation forgotten.</p><p>"Helen!"</p><p>Arthur and McGonagall turned their attention to the Thing while Harry sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose. The whirring increased until it was as loud as a tea kettle's whistle. Remus winced at the noise but couldn't keep his gaze from Harry for long. <em>Something is wrong.</em></p><p>A burning smell assaulted his sensitive nose and the Thing's head began shaking and popping up and down.</p><p>"Al, get yer bloody robot under control!"</p><p>"Look at her go!" Arthur whooped loudly, high-fiving Alec.</p><p>Harry met Remus's eye for a moment before he frowned and gave Alec a sharp look, which was promptly ignored.</p><p>
  <em>He doesn't know me!</em>
</p><p>"What's wrong with you?" Remus murmured. Harry's head whipped back to him and Monty looked as if he'd been slapped.</p><p>"What did ye say?!" the man suddenly said in a booming voice that instantly cut off the boys' celebrations.</p><p>"I-I-I - " Remus stammered, at a loss, still staring at Harry who was looking back at him coolly. The Thing - the robot, Monty called it - was vibrating violently now. Its arms were spinning in their sockets and it was looking less and less human by the second.</p><p>"Remus, do control yourself," McGonagall murmured under the din of noise, casting a wary glance over the scene.</p><p>"Minerva, do you not <em>see </em>- " he started incredulously, but the acrid stench of smoke and burning plastic filled his nose and he faltered, gagging on the smell.</p><p>"Go on then, what did ye say?!" Monty repeated, jaw tight, hands clenched on the tabletop. Harry pursed his lips and screwed his eyes shut in annoyance, whether at Monty's shouting, the robot's loud and smelly destruction, or Remus's manners, he couldn't begin to guess.</p><p>"See what?" McGonagall pressed while raising a placating hand in Monty's direction.</p><p>"Da'?" Alec asked hesitantly. Harry didn't open his eyes, he only pointed stiffly at the Thing, which was now sparking violently from the top of its head.</p><p>Monty's attention was finally torn from Remus when Alec stood and raced around the table to the robot, bending down behind it and fiddling with something under its stumpy legs. A hiss of smoke came billowing out of its head, stinging Remus's eyes. The sparks petered out, the movements eased up, and the whirring slowed down into nothing.</p><p>Silence reigned in the kitchen once more.</p><p>And then Harry began to sign. Alec and Arthur watched his hands with baited breath before Alec nodded, quickly moving Harry's cane to lean against the table and dragging the robot away from the table. Huffing and straining, he pulled it into the pantry, its metal feet scraping across the tile floor dreadfully. Arthur cleared the table, gently stacking dishes in the large industrial sink. Monty was back to attempting to glare a hole through Remus's face, and Remus was attempting spontaneous invisibility.</p><p>When the boys returned, they sat quietly at the table, exchanging meaningful glances but nothing more. Monty snatched up Arthur's letter and handed it to Harry, who scanned the words carefully once...twice...three times he read the letter before moving on to the supply list, eyebrows nearly reaching his hairline. He carefully folded the parchment and placed it back in its envelope before handing it back to Monty, who passed it back to Arthur, who studied the address intently.</p><p>Harry signed something else, looking between Remus and McGonagall expectantly. Remus fidgeted...was that mean for them? Harry huffed and signed again, and this time Alec translated:</p><p>"How often do you get students like us?"</p><p>"Like you?" Remus repeated blankly.</p><p>Harry signed again and Alec spoke: "From non-magical families?"</p><p>Remus thought his heart would surely stop if he didn't get some answers soon. Of all the questions, Harry had to go and ask one that denied his own identity at the same time…</p><p>"Muggleborns are fairly common, Mr. Charming," McGonagall answered. "We send faculty from the school to discuss the matter with the family. A shock like this can't be left to a letter."</p><p>Harry went on and Alec said: "You visit families often?"</p><p>"Yes indeed."</p><p>Eyes fixed on Remus, Harry signed again. Alec hesitated and Arthur smothered a laugh. This time, Monty translated, rather aggressively: "Yer not much good at it."</p><p>Remus felt his face flush under Harry's cold gaze.</p><p>"Ah, yes...of course, my apologies, I - "</p><p>Harry began signing again but McGonagall interrupted.</p><p>"Can you speak, Mr. Charming?"</p><p>Harry shook his head, glancing at Monty who hesitated for a long moment. Once he got going, however, it became apparent that he was telling more than what Harry meant for him to say:</p><p>"James woke in hospital several years ago without a clue. Couldn' remember 'is name, couldn' walk or talk. They found 'im on the street, all banged up, no identification."</p><p>"No memory?" McGonagall gasped. Remus felt his heart, which had spent the last two hours winding up tight like a spring, break to pieces as Harry glared at Monty, at McGonagall, at Remus, at the pantry, and finally at the table. <em>All these years...he's been lost and alone all these years and we didn't think to check the Muggle hospitals for a John Doe!</em></p><p>Except he hadn't been alone. Two years, Harry and Monty had been together. And the boys would be off at Hogwarts as first years now, so they had to have been born just a year after Harry's disappearance. Ever the survivor, Harry had found himself a family and built himself a life in these past twelve years. Remus remembered another period of twelve years that he himself had spent lost and alone...in that time, he hadn't done anything that could compare to what Harry had accomplished without even knowing his own name.</p><p>"So's funny you should mention tha' bloke ye once knew, Mr. Lupin..." Monty went on pointedly. "Always thought maybe we'd run across someone who might recognize - "</p><p>Harry sent Monty a withering look and started signing agitatedly. Arthur and Alec startled slightly at whatever he was saying and then Monty cleared his throat, looking chagrined.</p><p>"Right. Let's get on wi' this Hogwarts business, yeah?"</p><p>Remus thought they would, but a fire was in McGonagall's eyes and she seemed to grow taller in her seat. She pulled out the photo she had grabbed from her office and slammed it triumphantly onto the table, lips pursed around a smile as if Gryffindor were on the verge of winning the House Cup.</p><p>The boys leaned in eagerly, torsos splayed on top of the table as they gaped at the moving picture. Monty turned it around to face him, and Harry leaned in to get a better look.</p><p>"It's <em>moving!" </em>Alec wondered.</p><p>"Oi, that looks like Dad!" Arthur blurted, pointing at the shortest figure in the photo.</p><p>From upside down, Remus could recognize the Gryffindor Quidditch team. A fifth year Ron Weasley waved eagerly beside Harry who stood at the edge of his team. The Team Captain pin glinted proudly on Harry's uniform as he grinned at the camera. Ron leaned in to say something in Harry's ear and Harry replied out of the corner of his mouth. They both laughed rather stupidly before turning back to smile at the camera.</p><p>"Harry James Potter was the captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch team in his fifth year at Hogwarts," McGonagall supplied, staring at Harry who was now gaping openly at the photo. "He disappeared twelve years ago under some rather unfortunate circumstances... You can see now why my colleague here is so taken aback."</p><p>"Said he could be yer twin, he did," Monty told Harry in a low voice, nodding in Remus's direction. "Went all pale when 'e saw yer picture in the shop, like he'd seen a ghost."</p><p>Harry kept staring at the picture, saying nothing.</p><p>"<em>Quidditch </em>team?" Arthur asked.</p><p>"A sport," McGonagall answered simply. Remus wondered at her restraint. McGonagall loved Quidditch.</p><p>"What happened to Harry James Potter?" Alec asked quietly. "You said he disappeared?"</p><p>McGonagall said nothing and when Remus looked over, he saw her swallowing thickly as she looked at Harry - no, at James Charming. Her withered old hands were trembling. He cleared his throat, not knowing what he would say but forcing the words out anyway.</p><p>"There was a war, years ago, in the magical world. It started picking up in Harry's fifth year," he tapped the photo, "and by what should have been his seventh year, Harry and his friends dropped out of school to help in the fight." How to explain that Harry Potter was at the center of this war? He couldn't do it… His voice was on automatic and he barely thought about what he was saying. "May 2nd, 1998, the war was won, largely by Harry's efforts. And his friends. But Harry dealt the final blow."</p><p>"The final blow?" Arthur asked breathlessly, looking between the photo and his dad with wild eyes. Harry was back to absently tracing patterns on the tabletop, stiff with unease as he listened.</p><p>"The other side was led by a powerful dark wizard," Remus answered. "Called himself Lord Voldemort. To this day, most witches and wizards are afraid to say his name… Harry killed him."</p><p>"Yer saying Da' killed an evil dark lord with magic?" Alec said, utterly dumbfounded. Arthur's eyes lit up like fireworks.</p><p>"It certainly looks like your father," Remus admitted, uncertain how to reply…. He <em>knew </em>that this James Charming was actually Harry Potter, there was no doubt. But he had a feeling that pushing this on him too firmly would get McGonagall and himself chucked out on their arses.</p><p>"And then what? He disappeared after that?" Alec pressed.</p><p>"Then we spent the summer recovering. Funerals, memorials...it was a difficult time, we were coming out of a dark period in our history and our world was rebuilding itself. Harry was just seventeen, but he was a legend. Not a person in our world didn't know his name. He'd always been famous, of course, but - "</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"Always?"</p><p>"Why?"</p><p>"Erm - " Remus hesitated. This could turn into a very long story. "Harry had a long history in the fight against Voldemort. He - Voldemort, that is - tried to kill Harry as an infant, but the curse he used rebounded and hurt him instead. So Harry became famous overnight, at just a year old. What would have killed anyone else...left him with just a unique scar on his forehead."</p><p>Harry patted his hair over his forehead in a way that Remus had seen so many times before. It moved something inside his chest to see it again…</p><p>"So he's like a celebrity?" Arthur grinned over at his dad. "Cool!"</p><p>Harry signed something with stiff, jerky movements, avoiding everyone's eyes. Monty sent him a complicated glance before he translated slowly:</p><p>"We don' <em>know </em>tha' our James is yer Harry. It could be a coincidence."</p><p>Remus took a fortifying breath, rallying for the offensive. "When did James appear in hospital?"</p><p>"July 1998."</p><p>"Harry disappeared July 1st. When James woke up, he couldn't remember his name but he thought it might be James?"</p><p>"Right. Went by James Smith at first, then they started callin' him Charming. The doctors made it official on the paperwork before he was discharged."</p><p>"Because he was so charming?" Remus asked, getting sidetracked.</p><p>"Because he was an arse," Monty smiled proudly. Harry actually pouted and started signing, but Monty waved his hand dismissively. "Relax, ye lout, a know…" He turned to Remus and went on in a way that made Remus think he was repeating an oft-heard argument. "<em> You </em>try wakin' up in agony, no voice, no memories, helluva headache, everyone's either yellin' at ye cos they think yer deaf or they're talkin' about ye like yer thick or like yer not even there… I'd've started throwing things too!" Harry looked slightly embarrassed as the boys were giggling to each other.</p><p>"James was Harry's father's name," McGonagall smiled fondly. "And of course, Harry's middle name."</p><p>Harry signed and Monty said: "S'not like he thought o' the name himself. They gave 'im a list'a common male names an' he just chose one."</p><p>"Did you choose it because it seemed familiar?" Remus asked. Harry screwed his mouth to one side and shrugged noncommittally. Remus went on, undeterred. "You can't see it in the picture here, but Harry had that same scar," he nodded at Harry's forehead, though the scar was obscured by his hair now. "He was the spitting image of his father, with his mother's green eyes. His friend Ron here," Remus pointed at the photo, "told me about that scar on your hand..."</p><p>Now was the moment of truth. Now he would stop pretending these could possibly be two separate people. James Charming was Harry Potter, there was no denying it.</p><p>"<em>I must not tell lies, </em>right?" Harry clenched his hand into a fist and took it off the table, away from prying eyes. "Your fifth year, there was a corrupt ministry official who came to teach. She had it out for you, what with the war picking up and politics not being pure as the driven snow… She gave you detention, had you write lines with a blood quill, which left you with that scar."</p><p>The boys weren't giggling now, they were staring at the professors with something resembling horror. Harry and Monty were equally shocked. Too late, Remus realized his mistake as Harry began signing.</p><p>Monty translated with a slightly sick expression: "You want us tae send our boys tae a school tha' tortures kids in detention?"</p><p>Remus could feel McGonagall's annoyance with him permeating the air.</p><p>"As he said," she began, "it was a tumultuous time in our world. Harry was in the thick of it, he was on everyone's list, and that <em>toad </em>of a woman - "</p><p>"Who's t'say it won't happen again?" Monty interrupted.</p><p>"The war is over, the ministry's been reclaimed, the corruption rooted out - "</p><p>"It never should'a happened in the first place!" the Scotsman grunted, his voice beginning to rise again. He shoved a finger at the photo, tapping it firmly. "Tha's a fifteen year old boy there, wh - ye cannae just - just <em>leave </em>'im to fend for 'imself if there's <em>corruption </em>forcing - what's it, <em>blood quills? </em>- on bloody students!"</p><p>"You're right!" Remus admitted, suddenly desperate. "You're absolutely right. Things got very dark in our world for a few years, I won't lie. And Harry and his friends bore the ugly brunt of it. They were children growing up in a war, but they fought for a better future and they won it!" He cleared his throat gruffly as fifteen years of emotion bubbled up to the surface. "Hogwarts - magic - it's all so wonderful, Harry went on and on about how much he loved it, how much he felt like that school was his home. He gave everything he had to see it through the war and he disappeared just as we were coming out the other side. H-he never got to see it, but everyone else has… Twelve years' worth of students have come to Hogwarts since then, they've played Quidditch, won the House Cup Tournament, done homework by the lake. All those things that Harry loved, even in the middle of a war, our students get to enjoy now without fear."</p><p>"Record number of Muggleborn students this year," McGonagall chimed in somberly. "Because of what that boy did for us. He and his friends built a <em>better </em>world. Let your children be a part of it."</p><p>Arthur and Alec stared at them with wide eyes as they waited for someone else to speak.</p><p>"Da' - "</p><p>Harry signed something short and fast: a clear dismissal. The boys grumbled but got up from the table, leaving the room swiftly and retreating upstairs.</p><hr/><p> </p><p>Arthur dragged his feet while Alec hurried ahead of him up the stairs, down the hall, and into the largest bedroom. Twin beds, ironically mismatched, were nestled against opposite walls. At the end of Alec's bed was a Franken-desk he had put together from two tables and an old dresser: one surface was horizontal and sat higher than a normal desk - he preferred to sit on a high stool - and the other surface was leaning between the horizontal piece and the wall, rigged to pull out at various angles when needed. Bungee-cords held large drafting papers in place on the angled surface, but he kept it pushed up close to the wall for now. Climbing up onto the tall, padded stool, he began rooting around in the dresser-drawers tucked under the table.</p><p>Arthur shut the door behind him and flopped down on his unmade bed, which creaked loudly. Arty patted it absentmindedly, like he always did after some annoying piece of second-hand furniture "greeted" him.</p><p>"Helen's stuck in the pantry," he grumbled. "We'll never hear 'em now."</p><p>Alec sighed melodramatically. "You underestimate yer own brother..." He pulled out a modified clock-radio with a super-large antenna and the bottom half of a walkie-talkie strapped to it. He plugged it in and cringed at the loud, piercing feedback, before adjusting the knobs. At first all he got was static, then some music and a French radio station. Once he remembered to disable the actual clock-radio side of the contraption, he got the walkie-talkie to feed into the larger speaker of the radio, and the voices from downstairs began to drift through.</p><p>"Brilliant!" Arthur grinned, sitting up on his tie-dye bedspread to listen in.</p><p><em>"...visited his parents' graves alone one evening and we never saw him again. We think he ended up in the Potter Cottage nearby. It was destroyed, half a dozen dark wizards trapped inside, killed by the collapse. Harry was nowhere to be found, but..." </em>A throat cleared harshly and the voice - Mr. Lupin's - went on, much raspier than before. <em>"His blood was everywhere...not quite enough to make us think he bled out, but we knew he was hurt. Badly. And...and we never saw him again."</em></p><p>And indistinct mumbling came through as static flared. Alec lifted the contraption a few inches off the desk, which seemed to calm it for some reason.</p><p><em>"...wand recovered just outside Glasgow..." </em>Static, and Alec lifted the contraption a little higher in the air. <em>"...local hospitals, but we were using the wrong name - "</em></p><p><em>"...discharged in August," </em>Monty's voice came through. <em>"...in a shelter for a long while, had plenty of rehab 'fore he was much use tae anyone..."</em></p><p>
  <em>"Rehab?"</em>
</p><p><em>"Was hurt pretty bad, right?" </em>Monty grunted. Arthur and Alec shared a knowing look. Dad wasn't keen to talk about those days, between waking up in hospital and meeting their mother, who taught yoga at the rehabilitation center. True enough, Monty coughed loudly and plowed ahead. <em>"Met Aarti thereabouts and knocked her right up, so ye know, rehab did 'im pretty good!" </em>Monty dissolved in a fit of choking giggles while the boys groaned. Alec subtly brought the radio down toward the desk, increasing the static interference through the next part until he thought they might be in the clear of more dirty jokes.</p><p>
  <em>"...died bringin' the boys in, parents wouldn' even claim the body, said James killed her - "</em>
</p><p>Alec jerked violently and the contraption slipped through his fingers and hit the desk. Static took over and started rising in volume while Arthur leapt to his feet.</p><p>"What did he say?!"</p><p>"Was that about Mum's family?"</p><p>"They're alive? Shit, turn it down!" Arthur covered his ears with his hands as the static became overwhelmingly loud. Alec hastily picked up the device and spun the volume knob several times, to no effect. He shook the contraption roughly and several pieces rattled about inside before he tried again. This time the volume returned to a reasonable level and the static faded as he lifted it into the air again.</p><p><em>"...met in the bakery downtown - " </em>Static. <em>" - wore 'im down - years of chocolate penises - "</em></p><p>Alec rolled his eyes at the all-too-familiar love story, moving to stand on top of his bed and raise the radio high in the air with determination. Now the voices were coming through clear as day.</p><p><em>"You don't remember anything?" </em>This was a common question people posed when they learned about Dad's amnesia. It was a fascinating topic, of course, but everyone else got the vanilla version of the story. Alec, Arthur, and Monty, however -</p><p>
  <em>"He gets dreams an' what'd'ye call 'em...flashbacks? Could be walkin' down the street an' he smells somethin', remembers some odd scene - "</em>
</p><p><em>"Like what?" </em>came Mr. Lupin's eager voice.</p><p><em>"Outa context, cannae really make sense of anythin'... A fondness for gingers, can tell ye that much!" </em>Monty laughed loudly and fully. There was a pause - Dad was probably signing - and then Monty said: <em>"There dragons in yer magic world?"</em></p><p>
  <em>"Yes!"</em>
</p><p><em>"Dreams about dragons a lot." </em>A pause, then: <em>"An' flyin' on brooms, but a s'pose yer picture explains that, o' course." </em>A long pause before Monty continued, more hesitantly: <em>"Mostly nightmares. People gettin' hurt, or chasin' him. Violent stuff. He wakes up tryin' to scream some nights…" </em>Alec, still standing on his bed with the radio over his head, shared a surprised look with Arthur on the ground. They hadn't known that. <em>"All of it this same voodoo stuff, so I cannae think this is a good place fer our boys - "</em></p><p><em>"I assure you, it's safe, Monty, Har-James..." </em>said McGonagall. <em>"I know all evidence points to the contrary, but our world is as safe as yours. Harry's life was a uniquely difficult one. Out of context, those dreams must be horrifying - "</em></p><p><em>"Dinnae think context is gonna improve 'em much, miss," </em>Monty grumbled darkly.</p><p>An excruciatingly long pause, then Monty: <em>"When d'ye need our decision?"</em></p><p><em>"You'll need time to shop in Diagon Alley to get their supplies," </em>Lupin said awkwardly. He was an awkward bloke in general. <em>"If you're really uncertain, we can push that back to the day before term begins...but it'll best if they have more time with their school books, it's quite an adjustment for Muggleborns - "</em></p><p><em>"What else do you need to make your decision?" </em>McGonagall interrupted. <em>"Forgive me, but I can't imagine a world in which the Potter children don't attend Hogwarts."</em></p><p>Silence while Dad presumably signed, then Monty said, albeit reluctantly: <em>"Well ye don' have tae. They're Charmings."</em></p><p>This time, the silence seemed charged with tension. Alec and Arthur shared another look, feeling nervous. Dad didn't often lose his temper, but when he did...well, Helen was built mostly to explore the full electro-magnetic effects of James Charming's emotions. And she was already smoldering in the pantry. Arthur idly wondered if Dad had even pieced together Helen's true purpose or if he still thought she was just a mascot that Alec had built for a laugh...</p><p>Scraping sounds came through the radio as chairs were presumably pushed back from the table. The voices were fading away, overly polite goodbyes and stiff words leading their magical guests to the front door, far away from the walkie-talkie hidden within a hollowed-out book on the table. Alec dropped his arms and jumped down from the bed, depositing the radio on his large desk. Arthur climbed up to perch on his own desk - which was an old door mounted on two saw-horses. Too late he remembered the small puddle of paint he had left on its surface…</p><p>"Ach!" He pulled a hand through the blubbery half-dried paint that was smeared across his trousers now. "Oh well, need to feed the cat anyway..."</p><p>Alec jumped and spun around, climbing onto his knees atop the tall padded stool as Arthur opened his wardrobe. Arthur felt his brother eye him warily as he rifled through a drawer, opened a can of wet cat-food, and began poking around in the hanging clothes.</p><p>"You seen the cat anywhere, Al?" Alec went pale and looked at him in horror. Arthur snorted. "Keep yer knickers on, he's right here - a was just messin'." Alec hated cats. Almost as much as Arthur hated the dark. Hated. Not 'afraid of.' They were getting too old to keep being <em>afraid</em> <em>of</em> things. But that didn't mean they had to like them.</p><p>"So did it work?" he asked, patting the wrinkled head of the hairless cat that was going to town on the can of food in his wardrobe. Alec didn't look away from the cat and Arthur raised his voice a little. "Al? Did ye get what ye needed earlier? Nearly broke ma leg falling down those stairs..."</p><p>"I didn't ask ye tae actually <em>fall</em>," Alec snapped at him, regaining a little color in his cheeks now. "I told ye to cause a distraction, not fling yerself to yer death!"</p><p>"Monty's gettin' cleverer, I had to make it look good!" he said cheekily.</p><p>"Yer just tryin' tae hurt yerself so I hav'tae do yer chores!"</p><p><em>Well he's got me there. </em>"So did ye get it?" he asked again with a smirk, rooting through the drawers of the wardrobe to find his pyjamas.</p><p>Alec sighed and pulled something out of his pocket. Dad's latest mobile phone. He was supposed to have it with him whenever he left the house - like earlier, when he went out to run an errand and pick up the take-away - but really he just used it to text the others and send dumb pictures to Monty. And of course, the boys had to have their mobiles on them at all times. <em>Just in case</em>, Dad would say. In case of what? In case a kidnapper snatched them up and didn't think to check their pockets? It was 2010. Everyone and their dogs carried mobiles.</p><p>It was just as well that Dad always conveniently <em>forgot </em>to keep his mobile in his pocket. He had a strange habit of shorting out his electronic devices. After three family laptops, Dad was no longer allowed near a computer. The tube-telly in their sitting room seemed to be immune as long as they didn't try to upgrade to a flatscreen (and as long as Manchester didn't lose). After sixteen mobile phones, this was the only the latest. And, miracle of miracles, it was currently still working. Possibly because Dad never kept it with him and likely texted on it using a ten-foot pole.</p><p>Alec had already pried off the back and was poking around inside the device, wearing his terribly stupid Inventor's Goggles. A strap around his head held a series of magnifying lenses that were glued into metal rings on flexible goose-neck spokes. Alec would twist the lenses closer or farther, adjusting as needed while he poked around at tiny wires. And he looked bonkers.</p><p>"Wha'd'ye reckon they meant about Mum's family?" Arthur asked lightly, scratching the wrinkly, fleshy cat behind her ears. Alec barely spared him a glance before he shrugged. "I thought they were dead?"</p><p>"Da' never actually said that," Alec replied. "Jus' said they weren't round anymore."</p><p>"Yeah, <b><em>anymore</em></b>," Arthur signed as he repeated the word. "Ye don' say it like that unless ye mean they died."</p><p>"Well, maybe he meant it a diff'rent way," he shrugged again. "So they used to be around and...then they weren't."</p><p>"Cos Dad <em>'killed her'?" </em>Arthur went on, his voice cracking. He picked up the cat and cradled her to his chest, running his fingers over her back. "She died giving birth! How's that his fault?!"</p><p>Alec gave him an uncomfortable but pointed look, his green eyes huge behind the magnifying lenses. "Well. He didn't <em>kill </em>her, but he did… You know… Er, and then she died."</p><p>"Ugh, shut up," he said, his nose wrinkling at the thought of what had to have happened that led to their conception, which led to their birth, which led to Aarti Patel's death. "Tha's stupid."</p><p>"Da' said they didn' wan' anything tae do with him," Alec insisted, bending over the phone again with his tiniest pair of needle-nose pliers.</p><p>"Yeah, cos he dinnae have a family. He said they were all about that stuff." Their mother Aarti had come from a conservative background. Dad said that the Patels had wanted their daughter to end up with a Hindu. They were nice enough though, he said, until she got pregnant with his sprog. Then they turned her out. And now '<em>they aren't around anymore...'  </em>"Oh." Arthur suddenly felt very stupid, stupider than Alec looked in his Goggles. Bloody hell, his grandparents hadn't died. They had disowned Aarti and left James to fend for the newborn twins alone. "Shit."</p><p>"Yeah, shit," Alec murmured in agreement.</p><p>"Well. Maybe it's best. If they'd stuck round to help, maybe Dad would never've met Monty," he said, trying to sound a bit more chipper than he felt at the moment. He wondered if he could find his long lost grandparents online... Minutes ago, he would have wanted a happy family reunion and the promise of more presents on his birthday. Now he just wanted to give them a piece of his mind.</p><p>"I think he'd'a still ended up working in the bakery," Alec sighed. "He worked there before we were born."</p><p>"That was the grocery."</p><p>"Oh."</p><p>"We had to move cos Dad didn' like the area or somethin'," Arthur tried to recall. There was some sort of break in that had spooked Dad into moving...was it their flat that had been burgled or the neighbor's? They were little more than toddlers at the time; he only remembered Dad's long rants in which they had both picked up some interesting swear-signs. "Then he started a' the bakery wae Monty."</p><p>"Chocolate penises," Alec confirmed, nodding sagely.</p><p>"Tha' was a good birthday," he remembered fondly.</p><p>Alec snapped the phone back together and took off his Goggles triumphantly. "The extra coils I put in last time burned through but it's holding up so far," he grinned.</p><p>"Got a theory?"</p><p>"Yeah," he snorted. "We thought he was more like Hawkeye but Da's apparently the wizard-Hulk!"</p><p>Arthur giggled madly and the cat in his arms meowed in protest as he squeezed a little too hard. "All this time, he's just been Hulking out magic-style when he's stressed? And he always tellin' <em>us </em>tae treat <em>our </em>things nice! The git..."</p><p>A knock at the door and Alec damn near hurled the mobile into the closest desk drawer in a panic while Arthur flew to the wardrobe to stow the cat.</p><p>"Come in!" Alec squeaked as soon as Arthur had the wardrobe closed.</p><p>The door opened to reveal Dad leaning heavily on his cane, a sure sign of a long day. It was probably best his mobile was in Alec's desk drawer for now. He cast a blank look over the chaos of their room but didn't say anything against it. James Charming liked order - <em>everything has a place, you just have to get it there, </em>he would say - but he let them do what they wanted with their room. And they both wanted a bit of a mess...it distracted from the stolen mobile and stowaway cat.</p><p>"So..." Alec started, sucking on his lip. "...how are things, Harry?"</p><p>Dad shot him an annoyed look that was softened by the ghost of a smile. Their dad wasn't a foul-tempered man by a long shot. He had a temper sometimes, sure, but Monty was far more likely to go off. And yeah, Dad would get frustrated when Arthur tried sneaking yet another new drawing to the wall downstairs without framing it first, and then rearranging everything to make enough room for it (two inches of space around each frame, that was the key), and then dusting it all again for good measure (apparently for the health inspector's benefit but they would be hard-pressed to find any dust in their living space either). But Dad's slight neuroticism was just a quirk, really. Easily overlooked when you considered the crippled mute amnesiac as a whole.</p><p><b><em>Monty and I will talk. Will let you know soon,</em></b> Dad signed, balancing his cane against his leg to free up his other hand.</p><p><em>Wait, is this seriously up for debate? </em>Arthur thought.</p><p>"We want to learn magic," Alec said flatly. Neither of them were much in the mood to deal with their dad's weird issues. Arthur was 96% certain the other Muggleborns didn't have to worry about whether their parents would bug out and keep them home because of some dirty politics that went down a lifetime ago!</p><p><b><em>You can learn from home. Safe here,</em></b> he replied, keeping his movements deliberately slow and smooth.</p><p>"But the magic school has - er, Quidditch? That sport from the picture?" Arthur protested weakly. Dad gave him an unimpressed look.</p><p>
  <b>
    <em>You want to play a sport?</em>
  </b>
</p><p>"I'd like the option," he grumbled.</p><p>"It's not the same learning at home as it is at school," Alec insisted.</p><p><b><em>You teach yourself all the time</em></b>, Dad argued, nodding at the dozens of homemade contraptions on Alec's side of the room. <b><em>We can hire a tutor.</em></b></p><p>"It's not the same and you know it," Alec huffed, folding his arms across his chest. Arthur nodded and copied his brother. United front. That's what they needed to convince their father. It worked about half the time.</p><p>
  <b>
    <em>I agree. Different. No decision yet.</em>
  </b>
</p><p><em>You mean you haven't convinced Monty to keep us home yet, </em>Arthur thought darkly.</p><p>"Are ye even giving them a <em>chance</em>, Da'?" Alec sighed. "I mean, ye believe 'em, right? About Harry Potter?"</p><p>Dad didn't say anything for a long moment. His mouth twisted at the corner as he chewed the inside of his cheek. Then he grabbed his cane, tapped his watch to indicate the late hour, and nodded goodnight to them, closing the door gently on his way out.</p><p>Muffled inside the wardrobe, Arthur's secret cat gave an annoyed meow.</p><p> </p>
