    <p>If he didn’t do something quick, he and Baz were both absolutely <em>dead</em>. </p>
<p>For multiple reasons.</p>
<p>One, it was at least negative 10 outside, and neither of them had anything more than their Watford jumpers and trousers on. They might literally freeze to death. But more importantly- they had to run. Why?</p>
<p>There was a chimera. Again.</p>
<p>And guess what? Simon didn’t have his wand. </p>
<p>Well, not the right one anyway. Not the one he could show Baz. The stupid one that couldn’t contain his magic and only accepts dumbass spells that never work and rely on pop culture? Yeah it was broken. Snapped in half. Kaput. </p>
<p>Now his other wand, that he got from Ollivander? The one that had cool Latin spells, that is actually compatible with his magic and actually works? The one he used at Hogwarts? The one that he could not <em>under any circumstances show anyone at Watford especially Baz</em>? Yeah, that one he had.</p>
<p>And so, Simon Snow was stumped. He had no idea what to do, except run, and that was going to stop working real quick. </p>
<p>“Fuck!” Baz said, and apparently real quick meant <em>now</em> because there was no way in hell he was going to keep running away when the thing had Baz.</p>
<p>So he turned back towards the hideous thing and pulled out the Sword of Mages, (which was the only goddamned thing in this magic world that he could use) and turned around. </p>
<p>“Hey ugly! I think monsters eating other monsters is cannibalism!”</p>
<p>The chimera looked confused. Baz scowled. Simon still didn’t have a plan.</p>
<p>“Well, go on Snow, Chosen One and one who will save us all- get on with the saving,”</p>
<p>“Baz if you don’t <em>shut up</em>-“</p>
<p>And of course that was the moment she took her giant cat paw and swatted the sword out of his hands. Because he wasn’t paying attention. Because he was arguing with Baz. Stupid arrogant prick. It’s his fault anyway.</p>
<p>“Good job, Chosen One! No wand, no sword. How’re you going to get us out of this one?” </p>
<p>“You’re the one who tripped and got yourself grabbed by a fucking chimera.”</p>
<p>The chimera did not like being called a fucking chimera. </p>
<p>She threw Baz against a tree.</p>
<p>Simon ran to him. “Baz, you okay?” Baz sat up, disoriented, and shivering from the snow. Could vampires even get cold? Apparently.  </p>
<p>“I’m fine, get off me.” He scowled and shook the snow out of his hair. Then he paled.</p>
<p>“Simon, watch out!” </p>
<p>Simon turned around to see the Chimera running at him full force.</p>
<p>Simon blames his lack of options for what happened next.</p>
<p>“<em>petrificus totalus!</em>”</p>
<p>The chimera fell down like it was dead. It was basically stone. </p>
<p>Simon covered his hand with his mouth as he stuffed his wand back into his sleeve. “Oh my god.”</p>
<p>“Snow, how did you do that?”</p>
<p>“Oh my god.”</p>
<p>“What was that?”</p>
<p>“I’m dead.”</p>
<p>“Snow how did you-”</p>
<p>“I’m so dead.”</p>
<p>“Simon!”</p>
<p>Simon took his hand off his face, rubbing his hands on the back of his neck to warm them. “What?”</p>
<p>“What spell was that?”</p>
<p>“Doesn’t-“</p>
<p>“And how did you cast it? Your wand was broken two minutes ago.”</p>
<p>“Headmistress McGonagall is going to kill me. I’m dead. Professor Potter will kick me off the team and-“</p>
<p>Baz slapped him across the face, making his cheeks pink from more than just the cold.</p>
<p>“What the fuck, Baz?” he exclaimed, holding his hand to his face.</p>
<p>“Sweet Merlin and Morgana, Simon! Can you get out of your own head and explain what the hell just happened?”</p>
<p>“No!” His eyes widened. “I can’t explain. And I have to take you to Hogwarts.”</p>
<p>Baz took a step back and cocked his head. “Hogwarts isn’t real, Snow. Are you sure you aren’t the one who hit your head?”</p>
<p>Simon closed the gap Baz had created. “Baz, do you trust me?”</p>
<p>Baz took another step back. “You’re my archenemy, I don’t trust you as far as I can throw you-”</p>
<p>Simon closed the gap again. “Well I mean obviously you don’t like <em>trust me</em> trust me, but like when it really comes down to it, like when we’re fighting a monster and you trust me to save you and all that, you know I won’t hurt you when it matters, right?”</p>
<p>“Of course I don’t know that, Si-” Simon grabbed his arm and cut him off.</p>
<p>“Okay, great,” he said, and suddenly the boys were in a new place.</p>
<p>-=+=-</p>
<p>Baz was absolutely going to be sick.</p>
<p>His stomach was in his mouth and his heartbeat was in his head and his intestines were tied in knots where his feet should be and all in all, he was not having a good time.</p>
<p>He was still holding on to Simon though. That was a plus.</p>
<p>And they were standing in a village. It was still nighttime, and it was still snowing, which means Baz probably didn’t black out. The snow covered the rooftops and danced to the ground, and people milled about, looking happy. It was a pretty place.</p>
<p>“Snow, where are we?”</p>
<p>Simon looked back at him- his eyes were sparkling. He looked happier than Baz had ever seen him. </p>
<p>“Hogsmeade.”</p>
<p>“Hogsmeade like in the Harry Potter books? As in the <em>fictional</em> town near Hogwarts?”</p>
<p>Simon scowled at him and dropped his hand. “It’s not fictional. And Professor Potter is a real person. And he gets touchy when you mention the books. A witch named Rita Skeeter published her biography of him under an alias. Without his consent. And most of it isn’t even true. It was horrible.”</p>
<p>“You’re telling me that the Wizarding World of Harry Potter, which has eight movies, seven books and its own theme park, is real.” </p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Okay, Snow, that’s it. I don’t know where you sent us to, but it is not there. You’ve clearly got a mental affliction and need to go see the Mage.”</p>
<p>Simon’s grip on his arm tightened. “I will not. And neither will you. I need to go talk to Professor Potter. And you’re coming.”</p>
<p>“I am not.”</p>
<p>“Baz I will freeze you like I did the chimera and drag you there. You’re coming.”</p>
<p>“Fine, but only so I can prove that you’ve got a mental affliction,” Baz huffed and crosses his arms. “Well? Where are we going, oh chosen magician?”</p>
<p>“Well I was going to take the secret passage in the Hog’s Head, but if you’re oh so eager to see that it’s real, we’ll go through the front door, your highness.”</p>
<p>They ended up calling a strange triple decker bus which had a talking head talking to an odd, ancient looking man arguing about whether to let them on before Simon told them he was a wizard visiting from Beauxbatons. (Wasn’t Beauxbatons an all girls school? Baz hadn’t seen the movies in forever) He then told him that if anyone at school tried to talk to him, he could only speak French. Baz was pretty sure that was just a tactic to get Baz to not ask questions. (But by the way, Baz <em>does</em> speak French, not that Simon knew that)</p>
<p>And then they were in front of a castle. Which Baz was surprised to see. Maybe Simon wasn’t completely batshit insane after all. Simon was looking at him expectantly.</p>
<p>“Can you see it?”</p>
<p>“Can I see the huge as fuck castle directly in front of me? Yes of course I can see it, dimwit.”</p>
<p>Simons eyebrows knit together momentarily, but then his eyes got wider, and he grinned. </p>
<p>“Oh cool!”</p>
<p>Baz waited for an explanation, and when none was given, said, “Why- Why wouldn’t I be able to?” </p>
<p>Simon turned to him again. “Well, muggles can’t. It looks just terrible and sad and it has a big danger sign on it. Or so I’m told. I can’t see the facade. But you must have enough magic in you that the enchantment doesn’t work. Or maybe it recognizes your magic as equally as ours.”</p>
<p>They walked the long way to the entrance, and right before they reached the colossal iron doors, Simon stopped Baz with a hand on his chest. He took out his wand, which apparently was not broken, or maybe he had two, and turned to Baz. </p>
<p>“Do you have a particular sentimental attachment to your Watford jumper?”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“Because I’m going to turn it into something else.”</p>
<p>“Can you turn it back?”</p>
<p>“Yes”</p>
<p>“Without burning your school down?”</p>
<p>“My school’s made of stone. Also yes.”</p>
<p>Baz nodded. He pointed the wand at Baz’s chest, and to his surprise, whatever spell he muttered worked exactly as it was supposed to. Simon looked Baz in the eye when he saw his astonishment.</p>
<p>“I’m so bad at magic at Watford because it isn’t really my magic.” He looked down at his shoes, embarrassed. “Your magic is like a grease fire. You and Agatha and everyone else all have a blanket to smother it and control it. All I have to use tame the fire is water, because the fire I normally have is a regular fire.” He shrugged. “But when I add water to your fire…” he trailed off and made a mushroom cloud gesture with his hands. “It’s not the way everyone thinks. It’s not that my magic is super powerful, and that normal spells can’t contain it, it’s just different. I’m just different.” He looked down at his Watford jumper and spelled it into a red jumper with gold stripes. “But not here. Well, actually sort of yes here, too. Turns out I’m the Chosen One no matter what kind of magic I wield.”</p>
<p>Baz looked at his sweater. “So I take it our savior is in Gryffindor, then, your highness.”</p>
<p>“You guessed it.” And with that, Simon walked through the doors.</p>
