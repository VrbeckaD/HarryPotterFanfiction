Liverpool Harbour</p><p>Dear Tina, </p><p>Please let Queenie know that I arrived safely in Liverpool this morning. I’m sure she’ll be delighted to know the weather is awful, as to be expected of the north of England in late Autumn. I’m writing this at the docks, before going to my parents’ house in Dorset. I’ve been given precisely twenty-four hours before I need to present myself to the magical law enforcement department, and I have several letters waiting for me in Liverpool which tell me I need to thank Theseus for such a generous reprieve. If it were up to Travers, the head of the aurors at the Ministry, I would probably have been in front of them the second my feet touched English soil. </p><p>Can’t be helped. I’m off to drop my creatures somewhere the Ministry can’t get their hands on them, and then I will present myself. I’m sure it will all be fine. I’m usually quite good at getting out of scrapes. </p><p>Dougal only ate half his apple when we were on the steamer, and I blame you entirely for always splitting your apple with him. He presented me with half an apple covered in spittle and was far too pleased with himself. </p><p>I hope you are enjoying your triumphant return to the investigative team. I know you can’t talk about active cases, but I am certain that you are doing wonderfully. How’s Queenie doing? Has Mrs Espisito officially adopted the cat in the garden yet? </p><p>Hope the weather is alright for you, the muggle paper said there was a snowstorm a few days ago. </p><p>Newt Scamander</p>
