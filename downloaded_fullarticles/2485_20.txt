  <em>July 1997</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Remus ducks the curse being fired at him, he leaps behind a cement block to dodge the bullets being fired at him, running from the Death Eaters chasing him.  He sprints, trying desperately to make it into the building classed as a ‘safe zone’ due to it’s current function as a medical centre.  The building explodes in front of him, the shockwave sending him flying back into the very Death Eaters he had been trying to outrun.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Avada ke-” One begins, only to be shot in the head.  Remus lays, dazed, on the ground as war continues half a metre above him.  Curses, projectiles, and all manner of insults flung between two opposing sides, Muggles and Wizards.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“YOU FREAKS WILL BURN!” Someone calls with surprising clarity.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“WE WILL NEVER BE DEFEATED BY INFERIOR BEINGS SUCH AS YOURSELF!”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Remus ignores both sides, crab crawling along the ground and out of the road.  Once out of the direct range of fire, Remus runs to the burned building, ignoring the cries of the re-injured injured.  He heads into the bottom of the crumbling building, slipping into a manhole, covering it closely, and sprinting down the sewage pipes.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Remus!” A voice calls as Remus enters a chamber, a new edition to the sewers that they had constructed a mere month ago.  Remus nods for Hugo Granger to follow him in, and he does so, along with the machine gun all but attached to him these days.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Our location has been compromised,” Remus tells the gathered group of freedom fighters.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“What?  Already?  How did they find out where we are?” Percy Weasley asks.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“They’ve got Dudley and more than a few ways to make him talk,” Neville reminds Percy, “We should have moved the moment he was captured.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“We couldn’t have known they would blow up a safe zone,” Remus says, shaking his head.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Regardless, we need to move,” Lily Moon says, having had her hearing restored through a dark ritual performed by Molly Weasley and Sirius prior to Molly’s execution and the beginning of Sirius’ undercover reconnaissance mission within the Muggle resistance.  Word is they have a new player, one ramming his way through every side’s defences. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“We can be packed within the hour-” Percy starts saying. </em>
</p><p><em>Remus shakes his head, “No,” He interrupts, “They are right on top of us.  We need to go, </em>now.<em>”</em></p><p>
  <em>The group grabs their gear, sets fire to the chamber, and separates down different tunnels of the sewers.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Remus, we have to talk.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Remus sighs, “Tonks, whatever it is, it can wa-”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“No, Remus, it can’t wait.”  Remus frowns as she grabs his arm and pulls him back to stop him moving forward.  The other three resistance members of their evacuation group stop as well, Remus gestures them onwards.  They would not die because of his girlfriend’s eccentricities.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“What is it?” Remus asks.  Tonks sighs, tears filling her eyes.  Remus’ hardened exterior cracks as he reaches out a hand to cup her face, “Tonks?”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“I’ve been trying to tell you for weeks but…there’s just never time,” Tonks begins.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“And there isn’t really now either, I still have to get to the shelter before moonrise so, whatever it is, just say it.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Tonks bites her lip for a moment, wiping away the lone tear that falls before determination overcomes her again, “I’m pregnant.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Footsteps sound from the direction they came, both look there instinctively before Remus grabs Tonks’ hand and starts pulling her down the tunnel leading off from the one they are meant to take.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Remus?”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“We need to get you somewhere safe.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Tonks wrenches her arm from his hand, “No, I’m not leaving you!”</em>
</p><p><em>“Stop thinking of yourself and think of the child!” Remus snaps at her, “This isn’t </em>safe<em> Tonks, I have already lost so much.  Please, don’t put my child at risk too.”  Tonks hesitates a moment more, the footsteps getting ever closer.  Then she nods, grabbing Remus’ hand, and together they run.</em></p><p>

</p><p>Twenty-four years later</p><p> </p><p>“Teddy!  Get up!” Victoire calls, Teddy groans, shoving xyr face further into bed, “Edward Remus Lupin –”</p><p>“Alright, alright, I’m up,” Teddy tells xyr spouse as xe drags xyrself up, muttering under xyr breath as xe dresses and heads out to the kitchen, “Why am I up?” xe asks, unaware that xyr hair has changed to the same pale red shade it always does when someone wakes xyr.</p><p>“Because I have arrived!”</p><p>Teddy spins in excitement towards the voice, missing xyr spouse’s pleased look, and spots xyr beloved younger sibling. “Hope!” Teddy calls happily, allowing xyr sixteen-year-old sibling to jump at xyr as xe wraps xyr in a hug.  Then Teddy puts xyr down as xe jerks back in shock, “Hope Lupin what the devil are you doing here?!”</p><p>Hope winces, tugging at the sleeves of xyr dress, “Visiting my brother.”</p><p>“Hope you can’t just cross divides like that, how did you even make it through the wall?” Teddy demands.</p><p>Hope scowls, “I don’t know why it should be so difficult to come see you.”</p><p>“Hope don’t start this again.”</p><p>“It’s stupid!” Teddy sighs, closing xyr eyes and pinching the bridge of xyr nose.</p><p>“That’s enough, Potter!” Teddy’s eyes snap open to see xyr sibling before xyr, but looking around, they are not in xyr house.  They’re in a room with a large table, many people sat around it, two seem to be having a standoff of sorts.</p><p>“Whaaaaaaaaaaaat?” Hope asks, the room turns to look at the two intruders.</p><p>“Who the hell are you?” A person with shaggy black hair and round glasses asks.</p><p>“Who the hell are we?  Who the hell are you?!” Hope replies.</p><p>Teddy just keeps staring at the person, “Sorry but, did xe just call you Potter?  As in Harry Potter?” Teddy eventually asks, everyone in the room exchanges confused looks.</p><p>Supposedly Potter shakes xyr head with a frown, “No, Potter as in James.  James Potter.”</p><p>Teddy’s pretty sure xyr heart stops beating.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>NOTE:</strong>
</p><p>So, to explain the whole xe/xyr thing.  The world is currently made up of sectors (Not like Hunger Games, it’ll get explained don’t worry.)  But the one Teddy lives in doesn’t recognise Gender as a difference in everyday lives and as such they all use gender neutral pronouns and words such as spouse and sibling as opposed to wife and sister or husband and brother.  The other two sectors don’t do this.  One is like how we live, some people decide on gender neutral things, others don’t, some believe in that stuff, some don’t (If you are one of those people please keep it to yourself) and the other is very traditionalist in there being a big difference between male and female.  Again, all of this will be explained as the story goes on, but I felt it worth pointing this out to all of you now.  I’ve done this for a reason, again, explained later.  But that’s why when written like this, from Teddy’s experiences, it’ll all be gender-neutral because that’s how he thinks and lives, but if it’s focused on someone else it won’t be.  I’ll make sure that doesn’t get too confusing, I have a plan on that, don’t worry.</p><p> Anyways, hope you’re all looking forward to this story and that the first chapter hasn’t let you down too hard!</p><p>Thanks for reading!</p>
