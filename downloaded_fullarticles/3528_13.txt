<h1>Prologue</h1><p>
  <em>July 31, 1991</em>
</p><p>The Record Keeper didn't leave his hall where the Book was very often, but sometimes he felt the urge to walk around Diagon Alley. When he did magic obscured him to where no one recognised him for who he was. If someone came to the book to see if they had a soulmate, the arch would not let him through, and he would be called back. Apparition was allowed for the Record Keeper no matter where he was. Magic provided for those who did her will, and it was never more evident than in the Record Keeper for the Book of Bound Souls.</p><p>The voice of an excited child drew the Record Keeper's eyes toward where a young girl was chatting with a resident of the Alley. As the girl talked her magical aura flared a little, and the Record Keeper was intrigued. He walked toward where she was and stayed near her. There was something very shiny about her magical aura, and the Record Keeper knew precisely what that meant. Outside of the Hall, the Record Keeper was the only one who could see that part of magical auras, and it meant that she had a soulmate.</p><p>There was a fifty percent chance that her soulmate was going to be at school with her and she and he or she and the witch would grow slowly into love. It would be lovely, and it would be sweet. The longer that he looked at her, the more that the Record Keeper knew about her. She was Muggle-born with a robust magical core. He had seen one like her many years before, and her death had been a sharp pain in the Record Keeper's heart for a long time. He knew those who were destined for greatness. It was an effect of being drenched in magic like he was all of the time. He was the only one who could see it that he knew of but it was still humbling.</p><p>After so long the pureness of magic still made the Record Keeper feel humble and sometimes like he was unworthy of magic. The Muggle-born child laughed at something the other person said, and her aura flared again, and this time the Record Keeper saw the reason why he was out and about in the Alley that day. There was a purple tinge to the edge of the aura and that only meant a single thing.</p><p>Turning around to look, the Record Keeper tried to see if anyone else's aura was flaring in response but there was none. He frowned because he hoped that she would find her two mates that day. Magic would be kinder to the three of them if they met before they went to Hogwarts, their love would grow with each class shared and each meal that was eaten together. They would be fast friends and inseparable by the time they hit their third year, yet the other two were not there.</p><p>Almost an hour of wandering around later, the sound of a loud speaking man drew the Record Keeper's eyes over to where that man was. The Record Keeper stayed where he was as he watched a half-giant walk with a young boy who looked like he needed help in many ways. The boy's clothes were oversized to the point of it being stupid, yet no witches or wizards on the Alley looked twice at him. The Record Keeper frowned at that because it was profoundly stupid of them. Magical Britain was becoming too insular, and he knew it, but he could do nothing about it.</p><p>The boy seemed happy to be with the half-giant, but the Record Keeper wondered where his parents were. Even if the child were a Muggle-born, his parents would be allowed to be with him. When the boy stopped at one point to look around, the Record Keeper gasped, and it drew a few eyes to him, but he waved those eyes off and held up a hand before taking it to his mouth to fake sucking the blood off of it. The eyes turned away, and the Record Keeper followed the child from a discrete distance. The Record Keeper knew those eyes, he knew them well, as well as that hair. The child was the spitting image of his father with his mother's eyes, and that explained why he was with someone who was not his parents but surely whoever had been raising him would have come with him?</p><p>The boy's aura flared when he got excited about something, and there was the purple. The Record Keeper turned to find the Muggle-born girl, but she was gone from his sight. Magical triads were rare enough that there was no way that the two of them weren't going to start to bond long before they hit their third year. Following them around, the Record Keeper was shocked that the boy was like he was. This was not the child of his favourite bonded pair in the last years. He had their blood, and he had their magic, but he was not as he should have been.</p><p>Stopping when he saw another familiar face, the Record Keeper watched a set of parents with their son. When he turned back, the other boy was gone. The Record Keeper cursed himself before focusing on the Pure-blood family. The son looked stern, and there was unhappiness on his face as he looked around. He was looking for someone and as he got more and more upset that he couldn't find him his magical aura flared.</p><p>The Record Keeper nearly fainted when he realised the full extent of why he had been drawn to the alley that day. A triad was going to be formed at Hogwarts in the coming years as the three children that he saw around the Alley came together. A Pure-blood, a Half-blood, and a Muggle-born coming together as a triad was going to be the talk of the British magical world for a long time to come.</p><p>
  <em>September 19, 1996</em>
</p><p>The Record Keeper stayed out front the entire day and only went inside the room with the book when someone came in but given that it was school time he wasn't sure if who he was waiting on would come or not. There were allowances for children at Hogwarts who wanted a trip to the Book. It didn't happen often, but it was better to allow them to come with a professor from the school than for them to sneak there and possibly injure themselves.</p><p>The end of the school day came and went, and the Record Keeper was getting more and more upset as the one he wanted never came. When darkness fell, he knew that she was not coming to him and that made him sad. He walked to his bedroom and laid down, wondering what was keeping her from him.</p><p>
  <em>June 5, 1997</em>
</p><p>The Record Keeper stayed inside the room with the Book because he was a guarantee that the young man was going to show up. It was a Pure-blood tradition to come on the day of their seventeenth birthday to see if they had a soulmate or not. The rest of the custom was to show up after lunch but before dinner, so that one did not seem eager but also, so that one did not burden the Record Keeper with working late into the day.</p><p>It was a game that the Record Keeper, no matter who he was never told them was stupid as he did not feel tired and no matter what he never stopped working.</p><p>Lunch came and went, and so did dinner, and for a few minutes, the Record Keeper thought about going out to see if the young man was too scared to enter on his own and was in the atrium or even out on the sidewalk. When night fell, he stepped out into the atrium, but there was no one. Outside the Alley was full of the late night shoppers who worked all day. There was no sight of white blond hair anywhere.</p><p>There was something horrible going on, but he had no way to prove any of it, and that made him mad.</p><p>
  <em>July 31, 1997</em>
</p><p>It was the last chance, and the Record Keeper knew that, if the Half-blood didn't show up then none of them was going to and that meant that things were worse than even the papers said. That things were worse than what Magic was whispering to him. With the sweeping changes that were everywhere, the regular guards for the book were gone and instead it was a group of Goblin guards who made sure that the Record Keeper and the Book were safe.</p><p>No war, no matter the leader, had ever breached the hall where the Book was. Even those who sought to change the world never touched the book with ill intent. Not after Magic herself burned an entire army down when it marched on her halls hundreds of years before. This war was no different, no one was coming for him and his book.</p><p>The triad had gone horribly wrong, the Record Keeper thought as time ticked on and turned into August. If they had bonded like they should have, they would have sought out the book to confirm what their magic was telling them, even if they waited for the youngest of the three of turn seventeen.</p><p>Magic was going to burn the world, and the Record Keeper was going to sit back and watch it happen.</p><p>
  <em>October 9, 1999</em>
</p><p>The Record Keeper heard the doors outside open and looked at the magical time display that was above the arch, it was just after four in the morning, and he had no clue how was arriving to check if they had a soulmate. The Record Keeper stood up from his seat, and he saw the same young man who had come on this day a year before. That confused him because no one else ever came a second time, even after finding out their soulmate. The utter pain on the young man's face was still there when he looked at the book.</p><p>"Welcome," the Record Keeper said with a smile on his face. The young man looked at him and pushed back his hood before taking the cloak off. Tucked under an arm was a package of some kind.</p><p>"I could not sleep, and I knew that you would be awake at this hour, even if you were sleeping when I entered you would wake up. I brought us breakfast."</p><p>"Visiting isn't going to change what is."</p><p>"No it's not, but at least you are someone who understands why it hurts even though I have never even spoken to him. You might not have felt the pain, but you understand."</p><p>"I do."</p><p>"My best friend doesn't, but then he has no wish to visit the book."</p><p>"Your best friend?" The Record Keeper asked as he invited the young man back to his room where there was a table set up for eating. The young man set out several pastries and expanded a large thermos of something. When he took the lid off, the Record Keeper could smell excellent coffee with just enough sweetness and cream to it.</p><p>"Yes, I tried to get him to come last year on his birthday in June, but he scoffed and told me that he had no soulmate. Draco can be very stubborn."</p><p>"Draco?" the Record Keeper asked, and he looked at the young man again. That was not a fact that the Record Keeper knew. He had no clue that the two young lords were friends, but it made sense in a way.</p><p>"Draco Malfoy, his father convinced him that he had no mate and that it would be stupid for him to come on his seventeenth birthday like all other Pure-bloods do. I tried again last night to get him to come today, but he refused. He's too busy with his post-Hogwarts schooling."</p><p>The Record Keeper wondered at a Pure-blood father keeping their child from what was the tradition. There were ways of seeing soulmates if one was not the Record Keeper and if the Lord had figured out who at least one of his son's soulmates were, he could see that man keeping his son from the Book to make sure that no one ever knew. Family seers were the best way for it to happen. There were some who could see it and wrote down information in family records to say if a future member would or would not have a mate.</p><p>If the Record Keeper had the power, he would force the young Lord to come and see what his father denied him but he could not. Coming to see the book had to be willing and free of all compulsion.</p><p>"So are you going to keep trying?" the Record Keeper asked.</p><p>"Yes. Because one of us deserves a happy ending."</p><p>The Record Keeper bit his tongue to keep his words to himself because he knew that volunteering to remove that information from the young man's head would hurt. The young man was the kind to keep a hold of a pain to remind himself that he was alive. His life was nothing but pain, and only his soulmate could remove it, but first, that soulmate had to fix himself.</p>
