          <div class="userstuff"><p>The kiss was meant to be quick.</p><p>Newts lips were so sweet though. Each brush of them coax her into another, and he seemed similarly affected. It wasn’t the first time they had kissed, but the first time that the room spun around them. Allowing her body to lean into his, feeling it gently cradled in response by her lovers’ arms, the kiss deepened.</p><p>This time, thankfully, they were alone. Tina decided this time wouldn’t be rushed. For a long time, they exchanged deep kisses. Stopping only periodically that to catch a breath, Newt leaned his forehead on hers.</p><p>It wasn’t until a harsh knock on the door of the apartment sounded that they jumped apart.</p><p>Both of them scrambled to fix the crinkles in their clothing. Tina tries to pat down the now frayed and messy ends of her hair while Newt wipes what he can of lipstick smudged on his lips. Tina does the same he answers the door.</p><p>“Oh, Kama. Do come in.” As they spend the afternoon talking about what Kama can tell them about Grindelwald’s following in France, Yusuf makes a concentrated effort to make as if he doesn’t notice she didn’t have time to apply her lipstick. Or, finish taking the smudges off her bottom lip.</p></div>
