          <div class="userstuff"><p>Smoke pierces his eyes, making tears try to crawl out into the open while dread runs cold in his veins.</p>
<p>“You triple <em>fucker</em>,” Theseus sobs while trying to examine the wound, and swears under his breath, “stop moving! I can’t— <em>I can’t do it—</em>”</p>
<p>“You—” Percival groans under the pressure of the redhead’s hands on his stomach before licking his lips, tongue raspy and dry as parchment paper and <em>fuck, is he back in the office now, parchment paper, parchment paper—</em> “Thes, calm— calm down, you can— you <em>can</em> and you <em>will</em> heal me.”</p>
<p>Shrapnel in there. Suddenly it feels like too much; looking at the battlefield around them, at Percival’s pale face, at his forehead painted red like a fucking Monet, how messed up this all is.</p>
<p>“<em>Fuck!</em> Perce! I can’t—”</p>
<p>Theseus is breathing far too fast, ragged at the edges, holding back the swirl of ice kissing his lips—</p>
<p>The older man’s voice breaks through the dust from the trenches.</p>
<p>“Theseus— <em>now.</em>”</p>
<p>Sometime in between painful breaths, the red-haired man keeps gnawing at his cracked, crimson nails until the tremors are under basic control; prods at the wound, removes the whole thing, mends the splintered veins and shattered arteries, a flow of magic swirling around the wounds.</p>
<p>He <em>manages.</em></p>
<p>He sews up the gash with trembling hands, stained with wet, running blood, stitches irregular and imprecise, but enough to make the wound hold up. Enough. <em>Enough.</em></p>
<p>“See, you are able—” but blood gushes out of Percival’s mouth quickly before he can finish his sentence.</p>
<p>“<em>Don’t belittle me and don’t bloody speak,</em>” Theseus snarls as he tightens a stitch particularly harshly with the tip of his wand. “<em>Worried sick </em>about your sorry arse—”</p>
<p>It takes all of Percival’s strength to reach out for Theseus’ neck and pull him down to him for a quick, messy kiss— more of a snap of lips, hungry and impatient and desperate, lipstick made out of blood and mascara out of burnt flesh that runs along the seams of their eyelids.</p>
<p>Fools in love, the both of them.</p>
<p>“It’s not something I do, dying,” Percival manages to mumble weakly against his lips, and the way the blood drains from his roughly cut cheeks only frightens Theseus more.</p>
<p>The shades are fading in his mind; <em>shut the door, count to four.</em></p>
<p>It is their first kiss, and yet feels like the last one.</p></div>
