    <p>
  <em>"Avada Kedavra!" The spell slipped from Bellatrix's lips with horrific ease and the force of the spell shot her dark locks backward as it shot off towards her selected target. Aviana could only watch as that deadly bright green surged toward her father, and she made a move to do something - anything - but it was all over in the span of a few seconds. Only after a few seconds of scrounging for her voice, did Aviana release a scream. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>At the despaired sound of his child, Sirius Black's eyes met her own and when he found her looking at him he took note of something other than his duel with Lucius Malfoy. Seeing the dreaded curse surging toward him almost immediately had him jumping out of the way… to collide into the ancient archway that was behind him.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Pain clutched at her heart as Aviana took note how her father's soul started to warp out of his body, as if it was now free from it previous captivity. He looked at Harry first, whom from the pictures she knew looked so much like his father, before he looked from Harry's anguished face and darted toward her own. His own gray eyes reflected back at him, only hers held a slant that he once happily told her that Aviana got from her mother. </em>
</p><p><em>He opened his mouth to speak, to possibly call out to her, but no words came from him. Aviana watched numbly, eyes wide as her mind pleaded for this to only be a nightmare… one that she ached to be free from. She watched as her father, the one that she had been slowly getting to know for the past two years, was ripped away from her. Ripped away to somewhere she couldn't follow and it was </em>all thanks<em> to -</em></p><p>
  <em>Through the red that tinted at her vision, she could distantly hear Harry scream. For now, she paid it little mind. Aviana's tore her now narrowed eyes away from where her father had once stood and locked them upon Bellatrix's face. The witch wore a mock look of anguish though her gray eyes flared with triumph, and Aviana had a feeling that in Bellatrix's twisted mind she was eliminating the blood traitors in their family. If she thought that Aviana would stand for it, would stand still and let the older witch kill her… then Bellatrix was much more crazy than Aviana originally thought. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>The corners of Bellatrix's lips twitched upward in a silent taunt before she turned to skip through the tunnels of the Ministry. Someone grabbed Aviana when she sought to go after her, wrapping her curved form in their arms from behind for comfort. The seventh year ached for blood though, the Veela part that was descended upon her from her mother quickly bubbled towards the surface. In one quick movement, Aviana brought her hands upward like she was about to fist fight before she brought her hands downward and connected her elbows hard with the person's ribs. Whoever it was quickly let her go, finding the error in grabbing her as Aviana darted after her. It wasn't long until Harry caught up with her, the both of them leaving Remus to stare after them sorrowfully and Tonks to rub her pained ribs gingerly.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"I killed Sirius Black! I killed Sirius Black!" Bellatrix's loud taunt echoed through the building, and Aviana didn't before have knowledge of the kind of hatred that she now held for this woman. She was a Ravenclaw, though she walked in her father's footsteps at times by playing an occasional prank. The only thing beside sorted into a different house, was eclipsed to her father Aviana didn't really care for attention. Maybe that was a side effect of growing up in the orphanage due to her father's imprisonment and the fact that she couldn't live with her mother. That was due to her mother's full Veela status. However all of that being said, she didn't know any hatred other that what she held for Voldemort. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Snakes might be poisonous; but Aviana was a heart of a lion cradled underneath those raven feathers. Lions come in tribes and they look out for their own. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>The hunt had begun.</em>
</p><p>Aviana gasped for air as she bolted upright out of bed, feeling as if her lungs weren't getting enough air to supply her. It happened again, another nightmare only to wake up to a reality that she couldn't escape from. A life without her father in it. It was supposed to be a time where they would all move forward, finally, for now war wasn't upon them. All but a chosen few expected her to move on, to pretend that she hadn't lost her father.<em> A bunch of hypocrites, I tell you. </em>Aviana thought with a growl vibrating within her throat, <em>they make it seem like we all didn't lose something… someone.</em></p><p>The blanket fell down her front and the saturating cold seeped into her form to claw at her her bones. Goosebumps immediately covered her body as Aviana shivered, before the witch grabbed her wand that laid on the night stand. After the familiar spell left her lips, she instantly felt warmer. <em>Oh, the wonders of Magic.</em></p><p>Her amusement quickly escaped her as she looked at her surroundings. Call it whatever you would like… but Aviana felt closer to her dad after his death by sleeping in his room. His pictures and all his things seemed to be just as he had left it. It was <em>personal</em> and <em>that </em>in itself meant so much more to her than anything that all the Gallons in the world could buy. Remus hadn't understood at first, had yelled at her with the frustration of being the last Marauder standing… but when he looked at her before the final battle, Aviana would have liked to believe that he understood. They both knew loss… and pain. In response to that, they sought comfort in what they knew… what linked them to the dead.</p><p>She shook her head sadly and looked around her once more. <em>I can see why you hated this place though, dad. </em>It wasn't grimy; no, it was more than that. Dark magic could be sensed and sacrificial blood still was so caked on the walls that even Winky couldn't wash it off. It was the thought that her father had been held under the cruciatus curse in this very house that made Aviana's stomach turn. <em>How am I supposed to live here by myself? With no one to help keep the nightmares away?</em></p><p>Her broken heart felt like it sunk deep into her stomach, disproportioned and not at all pleasant. The crack of the house elf that she had once saved during her sixth year popping into her room, magically hovering a breakfast tray with her. "Oh, Winky." She sobered up her expression into a grateful one, for while she was indeed grateful Aviana also wanted to conceal her emotions from the world. <em>It only gave you heartache, after all. </em>"You didn't have to bring me breakfast." She smiled softly at the house elf that clung to her as her 'Mistress', a name that Aviana secretly hated. House elves were living and breathing as well, she didn't see why they were forced into servitude… even if she didn't get involved in that S.P.E.W non-sense that Hermione started back in school.</p><p>"Winky wanted to Mistress." The elf insisted even though Aviana cringed slightly at the last word that the she-elf used. She felt warm with Winky's kindness, some gestures such as these were huge to Aviana and she loved that, with Winky… she didn't feel so alone. These moments, these fleeting precious spans in time, meant the world to her. Being beside someone that cared made a difference in this fractured world around them.</p><p>"...Thank you." Aviana tried to collect her thoughts and be polite… when all she really wanted to do was go back to bed. Just when she was contemplating on resting her head against the pillow behind her, an insistent tap sounded on the window. With a groan vibrating from her throat, Aviana flicked her wand at the window silently to open it and in flew an owl wearing an important looking Gringotts vest. <em>How adorable</em>, Aviana silently cooed as she looked at the bird that seemed to be stern looking for… well, a<em> bird. </em></p><p>It flew to the bed, sticking his leg out in offering to her. As soon as Aviana took the envelope that was held within it's mouth, offered him a Gallon to take back with him and gave the owl a piece of toast in return; the messenger chirped in satisfaction before flying out of the room. As soon as he was out, Aviana shivered and with a wavy of her hand, shut the window once more. She noticed Winky looking at the envelope as well, and shrugged in confusion before turning her attention to the thin object in front of her. Slowly she moved to pick it up, turned it over and hesitantly broke the official seal. Pulling out the parchment that was within, Aviana released a breath before opening it and reading the top line.</p><p>
  <em>Lady Aviana Black...</em>
</p><hr/><p>Aviana sighed as she finally pulled herself out of bed, letting the letter fall onto the covers before she did so. Her fair legs bare from wearing one of her father's button up shirts to bed. It was probably the same one that he had worn to the wedding of Lily and James Potter all those years ago. If that was the case, then Sirius Black was just as sentimental as his daughter. Sighing once more in longing for the dead, Aviana grabbed her robes, undergarments and wand before making her way to the shower.</p><p>As much as she wanted to wallow, to maybe curl up in bed with a good book… Aviana knew she couldn't. The letter had been notice of Professor Snape's Will being read today and that she was summoned. <em>"I have other manners to discuss with you. Matters of great importance."</em> was stated by Sharptooth, the manager of the vaults of those of the <em>Ancient and Most Noble House of Black</em>. It was odd to think that Aviana was summoned to the reading of a Will from her late professor, not because she was close to him mind you but from her recollection, quite the opposite. All that Aviana had done was focus on her work, for she knew no one caught her doing such seldom pranks. She had an internship with Madam Pomfrey back then on top of all her studies; for Aviana wanted to be a healer. To be brought to the reading of the Will, meant that her name was in it. As confused by it all as she was, Aviana felt warm with the thought that he thought of her.</p><p><em>I would like to think that we had a mutual understanding, respect for one another. A common ground, </em>Aviana smiled as she shower head with her wand and adjusted the temperature before starting to undress.</p><p>It was time to 'get this show on the road', so to speak.</p><p>After her shower, Aviana chose to get dressed quickly before she would eat her breakfast. Choosing a black top that had quarter length sleeves and a pair of black jeans, both of which hugged her curves, Aviana slipped on some ankle socks and her black combat boots before she went to look at her reflection. Aviana fancied herself to be pretty, though she was called beautiful by more than one person in her lifetime… the young witch had thought it might have been the half Veela gene running through her veins that made them say that.</p><p>Nevertheless as she pulled her hair into a french braid, Aviana scanned her face before turning back to what she was doing. Only when she finished tying a silver ribbon at the end of it, did her gaze wander back to examine her face. She liked that she could see a mixture of both of her parents while eyeing her five foot-three inch frame. She had her father's midnight black curls that fell half way to her bottom, her eyes and his high cheek bones. From her mother, she inherited her button nose, heart shaped face and after Aviana met her face to face; she understood why her father meant about the shape of her eyes. Those beautiful almond eye shape that added an almost exotic tone to the both of them. To complete the look, she found a white gold chain that had been her father's to put on.</p><p>Aviana would have liked to think of herself of not so vain… but the reality of it was everyone held some degree of vanity to them. Women across the world, muggles and magicals alike, had this inner wish to be considered beautiful. It was just… Aviana had seen others that far surpassed her, in the witch's private opinion. Sighing lightly at her thoughts, she finally moved to eat her breakfast.</p><p><em>Toast, eggs, bacon and coffee…</em> Aviana hummed softly, the vibration concealed within her throat, as she gratefully took hold of the precious black liquid before adding four little sugar cubes to it. Stirring it gently even as she raised it to her mouth, Aviana pulled the spoon away to take a sip; only to moan gently in response. She then moved to pick up her remaining piece of toast with one last thought before her mind was focused solely on the food in front of her.</p><p>
  <em>I can only hope that today will be a good day.</em>
</p><hr/><p>Placing the letter carefully in the bottomless bag that helped her stand by Harry's side in the war, Aviana grabbed her wand and made her way to the fireplace to floo to the Leaky Cauldron. Tying the bag securely at her waist, she grabbed a generous amount of floo powder in hand before she called out to Winky, telling the elf that she should be back soon before once more opening her mouth to speak. "The Leaky Cauldron, Diagon Alley." She stated in a clear voice before throwing down the gray powder and was whisked away by emerald flames.</p><p>Through the fireplace, Aviana spiraled downward as magic guided her to the gateway of her destination. She watched as multiple gateways were lit with green embers, along with the massive amount of people coming in and out of them. In this moment, Aviana felt much alike Alice did when she fell down the rabbit hole; she never did like traveling by floo because of it. She shut her eyes as magic decided to stop her from free falling and instead pulled her left and right like she were naught but a ragdoll.</p><p>Finally she was thrown out of a fireplace, Aviana quickly catching herself from stumbling but clutching at the cold stone cradling her. She took a moment to wave her hand, briefly showing her wandless ability, to remove all of the soot covering her from head to toe. After doing so, she nodded to the bartender before making her way towards the entrance of Diagon Alley. Tapping the sequence of bricks that she knew now by heart, the archway opened up to reveal to Aviana that many of the windows of the lingering shops were boarded up. Many were still under repair after nearly being torn apart. The young witch signed before she stepped forward, absentmindedly cataloging the sound of the bricks closing behind her.</p><p>The war may have ended six months prior but the entire wizarding world was still suffering to clear up the aftereffects; both of loss within and damage to their homes, to their businesses. Aviana reckoned that they were slowly getting back on their feet; for she noticed a few new shops opening up. It was something that somehow surprised her, mainly because the Purebloods hated change, but Aviana could only hope that with the war being cast behind them… tomorrow would hold a better future.</p><p>After all, that was all that she could really do at this point; hope. Aviana slowly meandered her way through the small crowd towards the large white columned building she knew to be Gringotts. On her way, she noticed that one of the new shops was a bookstore, and the young witch knew that she wouldn't be able to ignore the eager reader within her. She would have to check it out at some point. Rounding the corner, she locked her eyes upon her destination and quickened her pace. Walking up the stone steps as quickly, but safely, as she could she noticed that security had increased dramatically. Most have been after Harry, Ron and Hermione broke into the bank… though the sign that always amused her with it's dare still remained. Now there were several Aurors guarding the entrance, all equipped with Secrecy Sensors and other high-tech gadgets used to detect concealment charms and potions. Aviana was one of the few that respected that, after all they couldn't be too careful. Especially when there were some death eaters still at large.</p><p>Once Aviana passed through security, she headed towards the row of desks where the goblins sat and after choosing one that didn't look as busy with their work, she spoke. "Merry meet." Aviana offered to the Goblin, whom had been ignoring her presence; the phrase coming from her naturally after reading about the proper way to greet Goblins. The Goblin didn't sigh deeply with annoyance after being interrupted but his head shot up in surprise at the greeting; clearly he put up with ignorant witches and wizards for years too long. After a quick moment of gawking at her, the goblin quickly composed himself to return the greeting. In response, Aviana smiled politely, "My name is Aviana Black. I received a letter from you about the reading of Severus Snape's Will." She untied her pouch quickly and wandlessly summoned the letter to her hand before offering it to him.</p><p>She was silent as the goblin in front of her looked it over before he nodded his head, "Very well Lady Black, everything seems to be in order. My name is Sharptooth. Come to my office and we shall discuss matters there." Aviana privately thought that Sharptooth was aptly named, as with a closer look she took notice of a row of very nasty looking pointed teeth. When the goblin smiled briefly at her, she was once more reminded of the Alice in Wonderland book that she loved whilst growing up in the muggle world. She tried not to gulp at the thought that Sharptooth looked quite like the Cheshire Cat; whom is an intelligent and mischievous, <em>insane</em> character that gets Alice in trouble whilst he wasn't helping her. She took this in the face of value to tread carefully as Aviana followed Sharptooth to a small office. Once she was seated in a chair, Sharptooth handed her a letter then withdrew a small pouch and set it on the dark hardwood desk. He offered them both to her with a silent, grand gesture of his hand for being respective of the items and Aviana opened the letter first.</p><p>In elegant cursive at the top it claimed the paper in her hand to be "The Last Will and Testament of Severus Snape".</p><p>
  <em>Being of sound mind and body, and under no influence of potion or curse, I, Severus Snape, do declare this to be my last will and testament. I leave the majority of my possessions to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, for I know they will be kept safe there. I however, to Miss Aviana Lily Black, leave my entire collection of potions supplies and ingredients with. Along with my personal notes on how to better the effects of potions. May you use them well and don't leave them with any dunderheads that I had to teach. So mote it be.</em>
</p><p>Aviana couldn't help it, she smiled softly at the 'dunderhead' comment and tried to swallow the laugh that threatened to be released from her. "The items left to you are in this pouch." Sharptooth said after Aviana had clearly finished reading the will. "It is a magical pouch, enchanted with an undetectable extension charm and featherweight charm." <em>So the pouch was like her own… but not.</em> She nodded her head as she listened intently, "I have also taken the liberty of connecting it to your vault here at Gringotts, so that you may on put your hand in the pouch, think of what you need and it shall appear in your hand. That is not all I summoned you in here for Lady Black." Sharptooth was suddenly the one that treaded carefully and it made Aviana quickly become suspicious. "I also wish to inform you of some very important information which has recently come to our attention… tell me, what would you say if I told you that there was a great possibility that you father was still alive?"</p><p>Aviana blinked with widened eyes at Sharptooth before she became quickly guarded, looking at him with an intense gaze that cataloged his every move. Whatever she had predicted that he would say… that certainly wasn't it. "...What?"</p><p>"The Veil of Death-" Aviana's eyes darkened at just the mention of that thing, but she did not stop the Goblin from continuing, "which resides in the Department of Mysteries at the Ministry of Magic was, until recently, thought to be a portal between life and death." <em>You aren't yet telling me anything that I don't already know, </em>Aviana thought unkindly as she thought back to the countless number of times she researched the Veil, trying to determine if there was any hope for her father. Little did she know that her frustration flashed through her eyes and Sharptooth quickly continued on, <em>I have sat in front of many heirs to the Blacks throughout the years… she is the only one that showed restraint even when her heart grew hardened, even if it was for but a moment. </em>"We goblins recently discovered an ancient parchment telling of it's true purpose. The Veil of Death is not, in fact, a portal between life and death... but a<em> gateway</em> to another <em>world</em> entirely." Aviana could feel her bottom lip slowly lower as she gaped at him in shock. If what Sharptooth was saying was true, the implications of it were impossible.</p><p>Sharptooth quickly continued, "I tell you this information because of how it will affect the Black family vault. As I understand your father, Sirius Black, fell through the Veil during a duel some years ago. It is entirely possible that your father is still alive." Aviana gaped at Sharptooth, this was… more than anything she had ever <em>dared</em> to <em>dream</em> of. She didn't know what to say or do when faced with this revelation. There was a possibility that her father was alive and well... but trapped in another world. Aviana made a snap decision in that moment, one that she knew in her heart that she really didn't have a choice in. Dimensional travel shouldn't really be possible but then again neither was magic supposed to exist. Aviana knew that she would move mountains if it meant that she could set her eyes upon her father once more.</p><p>"Do you know this world on the other side of the Veil?" She questioned of Sharptooth, daring to contemplate that what he was saying was true.</p><p>"As it happens, I do," Sharptooth grinned toothily once more. "It is a place called <em>Middle Earth</em>. Middle Earth is an entirely different world to the one that we live in. It can be a very dangerous place to be, I warn you. If you are planning to journey there, I will advise you to make some preparations. Namely, a will, in the event that you do not return. I can make the proper arrangements today if that suits you."</p><p>"What do I need to do?" Aviana hardened her tone, her question leaving her before she could even sort out her thoughts. She slowly smiled at the thought of reuniting with her father, brightened for the first time in what seemed like years and Aviana knew that she would give anything to be with her father once more… even her own life.</p><p>
  <em>After all, 'the ones we love never truly leave us'... right dad?</em>
