          <div class="userstuff"><p>Harry woke up, groaning he placed a hand on his forehead. He had a headache. A sigh next to him and Draco rolled over, looking at him. A slightly panicked expression on his lovers face. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Harry swore he could hear the </span>
  <em>
    <span>what's wrong? </span>
  </em>
  <span>that went with the expression. He smiled fondly, Draco was truly a mother hen. However that smile disappeared when Draco looked at him shocked. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>"I'm not a mother hen Harry Potter." the blond scowled, meanwhile Harry could clearly hear the fondly thought </span>
  <em>
    <span>idiot</span>
  </em>
  <span>. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>"Draco please tell me you're using legilimency. Like you did once before." Harry close to begged. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>"I'm not doing anything! It seems like the potion that exploded yesterday during the auror raid has some kind of side effect." </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Harry could see the wheels turning in Draco's head, but what was even more confusing was all the thoughts that hit him at once as the blond thought about solutions. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>"Love please stop thinking. I can hear each and every thing." Harry said, burrowing his face in his pillow as to silence all. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>"Harry, we have to call Hermione. We appear to be sharing all our thoughts and you are not reacting well to it," the blond told, cuddling Harry from the side. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Harry nodded, but was not quite willing to get up. A sigh was heard, before Draco send his patronus to Hermione explaining the situation. Then he was being held again, hands stroking his hair.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>I love you</span>
  </em>
  <span> was heard in his head. He sighed contently, before trying to project it back. A small kiss on his back convinced him that the message was received. Maybe this sharing thoughts wasn't completely bad. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>However he would still be glad if they didn't share their thoughts anymore. Otherwise he would never be able to propose to Draco. </span>
