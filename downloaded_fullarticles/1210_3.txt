    <p>Disclaimer: Don’t own Harry Potter or Dark Hunter.<br/>I have only read bits and pieces of Ash’s book so some of what I put in his backstory may not be cannon. There will be some slash early on but not sure yet whether it will be a permanent pairing. Let me know what you think. </p><p>Chapter 1</p><p>Ash paused as he walked down the busy London streets to just people watch for a few seconds. He wasn’t often needed over here, despite the booming population for some reason there wasn’t a high volume of Daimons. He didn’t know why and if anyone else did they weren’t telling him. Something made him shiver and look around, his eyes focused on a family across the street and he grimaced as he saw the man and woman and the way they treated their son. But then he looked past them and his eyes widened slightly behind his sunglasses as he stared at the small dark haired boy. Those eyes……he had seen those eyes before so long ago and on a grown man, not a child. Was it possible he was a descendant? The boy looked at him and then flinched and looked away, obediently following the family as they continued walking. There was some sort of power wrapped around the woman, her son and the boy, power that almost felt familiar but not. Whatever it was it wasn’t a threat and he did have a meeting to get to with the local Dark-Hunter.</p><p>```````````````````````````````<br/>Harry groaned and rolled onto his back, blinking dazedly up at the blue sky above him. Since when was the sky ever so blue over Hogwarts at this time of year? And as he became aware of his body again he realised it was why too hot for a Scottish February. He managed to roll to his side and then sit up, hissing in pain as various wounds made themselves known. Sitting up he looked around to find himself on a beach of white sand leading down to the clearest blue water he had ever seen, not that he had ever been to a beach before. But he had seen pictures, especially Hermione’s family holiday snaps and if he had to guess he’d say he was in the Mediterranean somewhere. He got to his feet shakily and took stock of himself after ditching his ruined robes, leaving him in jeans and a long sleeved jacket. He still had his moleskin pouch around his neck and the single Hallow he had kept, his Father’s cloak, as well as his wand thankfully. So all he had to do was find the nearest Wizarding community and organise a portkey home. </p><p>`````````````````````````````<br/>So getting home was going to be a lot harder than he originally thought. Considering he was stuck in the past and in a place even most Wizards thought was a myth. Hermione would have killed for the opportunity to see the legendary Atlantis in person. It was utterly amazing and nothing like what he vaguely remembered from history classes about societies so long ago. A quick transfiguration spell had changed his clothes so that he would blend in better and he was thankful he had gotten contact lenses before Diagon Alley was hit since no one was wearing glasses. The city had found was magnificent and in some ways reminded him of pictures he’d seen of Ancient Athens. It had taken a lot of quick spell work to figure out the language and that had led to another problem, his name. Harry was a rather modern and English name, something that would stand out a mile. So he had simply chosen to use an older, foreign version of it. While it still didn’t totally blend in he needed something similar so he would respond to it naturally and it was obvious to everyone he had not been born on Atlantis anyway. So now his name was Haraldr and he was from very far away, a traveller. His story had been accepted so far and so he had managed to get a room in a nice inn using some of his Wizarding money since it was gold, silver and bronze. He had been given the name and location of several people who would be willing to buy it, giving him access to local currency. </p><p>He didn’t know how he had ended up so far in the past but he knew he was stuck until either someone back home found a way to get him back or his luck kicked in and he found a way back himself. That meant he had to make a life for himself in case it took years. Which meant getting money and a permanent place to live. Depending on how much money he got he would either live a life of luxury or find some sort of work. He could handle all of that after years of looking after himself. What was hard to adjust to was the sight of slaves. Seeing other humans being owned made him feel utterly sick. And there was nothing he could do about it; slaves were simply a part of life in ancient times and one person, even a wizard wasn’t going to change that. And that was another thing; he’d gone to a temple the other day and been totally shocked to see magic. Sure the Statue of Secrecy hadn’t even been thought of yet but to see magic so openly had been surprising but also good news for him as long as it wasn’t limited to only priests. At least the place being a monarchy was something at least vaguely familiar. </p><p>`````````````````````````````<br/>Harry smiled as he stood on the balcony of his home and looked over his garden where a young woman was working. After buying his house he had done something that would have made Hermione curse him, he had bought slaves. He hated owning people but at least with him they had good lives and were basically free in all but name. He knew he confused them but he figured they’d get used to him eventually. The house was far larger than needed for one person but status was everything in Atlantis and he did not want people trying to walk over him. He glanced over as an aging man walked towards him and bowed slightly. “You don’t need to bow to me Akakios.”</p><p>“Of course Master. You have received an invitation from Lord Estes to attend one of his gatherings.”</p><p>“Do you know who Lord Estes is?”</p><p>“Of course sir, he is the younger brother of King Icarion of Didymos and has lived here for over twenty years. He is friends with the Atlantean Royal family as well and acts as Ambassador for his brother. His parties are lavish and very popular, especially among young men.”</p><p>“Do I want to know why?”</p><p>“Because there are always many tsoulus of both genders.”</p><p>Harry frowned. “I don’t know that word Akakios.” </p><p>“It means sex-slave.” The older man answered, he knew even if he did not understand what his master thought of slavery. Sure enough Harry’s features tightened in anger and disgust. </p><p>“How bad would it be to turn down the invitation?”</p><p>“It would do your reputation good to be seen at his party, at least for some time. Many of the rich of your age attend and it is a good way to socialise with them.”</p><p>Harry groaned and slumped down on a nearby kline, the reclining couch was nowhere near as comfortable as the plush couches in the Gryffindor common room but he was getting used to them. “So go or be treated as an outsider for a long time.” He muttered and received a nod in reply. “Very well send my acceptance and I will need appropriate cloths I suppose. Just please keep in mind I do not like displaying my body.” </p><p>“Of course Master. I will see to it at once.”</p><p>```````````````````````````````<br/>Harry felt very uncomfortable as he reclined on a kline amongst other young men around his age. The food was rich, even richer than that served at school, and his stomach did not like it at all so he was only nibbling. At least the wine was nice though he was careful not to overindulge. He smiled and laughed when appropriate but he hated being there, how could they be so shallow? All they cared about was their own pleasure. He was just considering leaving, he had been there for two hours after all, when the evenings ‘entertainment’ entered the large room, men and woman dressed very scantily and all highly attractive. A young woman smiled seductively at him and knelt beside his couch but he sent her away with a flick of his wrist and she simply moved on to the young man beside him. Harry closed his eyes briefly to block out the sight of her quickly removed clothes. Hearing a commotion he glanced over and heard a laugh from one of his companions. “Good luck Haraldr, just a night with him costs more than my father gives me to spend in a year.” The young man commented and Harry blinked, that was a lot of money. Surely no one could be that expensive. Cursing his curiosity he got up and moved closer to see. A teenager knelt on the floor, golden blonde hair falling down his back and eyes firmly fixed on the floor. Harry felt something against his magic and shivered slightly even as his magic wrapped tighter around him, shielding him. He couldn’t be more than fifteen or sixteen and yet he was being treated like a piece of meat as the others bid for a night with him. The boy glance up and green met odd swirly silver for a second. He only needed that long to come to a decision and place a bid so far above the others they had no chance.</p><p>Lord Estes laughed. “For that much you could have him for a week!”</p><p>“Then how much would it take for a month?” He asked seriously and the man’s eyes went wide even as Harry sent a silent compulsion charm at the man. He named a figure and Harry nodded. “Done.” If Hermione was still alive she would kill him for purchasing a sex slaves services but he could give this boy a month of peace. “Follow me.” He addressed the younger male who stood and followed him from the villa. Sensing he was having trouble keeping up Harry slowed his pace. They soon reached his own villa and he walked inside tiredly. Akakios was soon walking towards them. “See to it that he has a room and anything he needs Akakios.”</p><p>“Of course Master. Do you need anything?”</p><p>“No, just sleep.” He looked at the teenager and sighed. “Go with Akakios, he’ll get you settled for the night and we can talk in the morning.” The teen just nodded and trailed after Akakios. Once they were gone Harry retired to his own room and stripped off. He quickly washed down with cold water from a jug and then collapsed into bed. </p><p>When he walked out to the balcony the next morning he found breakfast waiting for him beside the stone bench he liked to watch the sunrise from as a teenager kneeling beside it. “God morning, I hope you slept well.” Harry greeted as he sat down. He reached out slowly and gently tipped the teens head up, not liking the way he stared down all the time plus he wanted to get a better look at him. “I am Haraldr and this is my home. What is your name?”</p><p>“Acheron Master.” </p><p>“As I am sure you heard last night I have ‘purchased’ you for the next month. But I have no intention of having sex with you.” He could feel Acheron’s surprise at that. “If I wanted sex I would go find a willing partner, not a slave who can’t refuse me. While you are here you will receive three meals a day and have your own room which I will not enter. As long as you remain on the grounds, do not steal or use violence then you can do as you wish.” He explained calmly. He doubted Acheron would believe him but he would learn. And Harry planned on more negotiating with a certain lord to buy more of Acheron’s time. </p><p>`````````````````````````````````<br/>Acheron stared around him at all of the books, a hand almost touching some of them. Not that it would do him any good, he couldn’t read. “Found something you like?” He tensed at the sound of his temporary masters voice but for the past five days the man had kept his word. “You can read any of them you like.” Acheron looked away. “Can you read?”</p><p>“No Master.” </p><p>“Would you like to learn?” His Master asked and Acheron risked a glance at him, seeing no cruelty in his eyes.</p><p>“Yes please Master.”</p><p>“Alright, we will start with something easy.” He chose a book and then sat, patting the seat beside him. Acheron cautiously sat beside him, waiting to be struck but instead the older man simply opened the book and began teaching. </p><p>TBC….</p>
