  <span>“Don’t be so nervous,” Monica told him as they followed the tall older woman who’d shown up at their door only a few months ago with a letter and an explanation for why their daughter had some rather miraculous things happen around her since she was a baby.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Never mind that she was nervous out of her wits as well, trying to put on a brave face for Hermes and Hermione who were more curious and excited than anything.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione held her grandfather’s, Hermes, hand, excited and doing her best to appear as fearless as she looked with her hair fluffing up in the late August chill. They’d debated for months about it, months of going back and forth, delaying it for a full year, until Hermes, Monica’s father, had put an end to it and directed their attention to Hermione who sat on the other side of the table. They hadn’t even noticed the way she stared at her plate, the way everything on the table hovered a good few inches off the table.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Minerva had been present for the conversation and shocked that a muggle-born child had such power at so young of an age. It isn’t until she has a moment alone with the girl that Hermione tells her, in no uncertain terms, that she’d practiced because she remembered making something float as just a baby after her mother had fallen in the kitchen. When she asked exactly </span>
  <em>
    <span>how</span>
  </em>
  <span> she practiced, Hermione, rather sheepishly, admitted to spending a lot of time in the library’s section about witchcraft most of it sounded like rubbish, but there were a few texts that she’d found that seemed to be worth something.  Minerva chocked it up to something about the side of town her grandfather lived on in Athens.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>That had been all of a week ago that Hermes had, more or less, forced his daughter and her husband to do what was best for Hermione even if that meant sending her off to school again much earlier than they’d intended, so here they were at the entrance to Diagon Alley following Minerva around. They’d had quite a row about it before it was decided as it would be the second time that Hermes had stepped in, the second time that they would have to send her away and maybe only see her on holidays. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>But Hermes had won out in the long run because as much as Monica and Wendell wanted to spend the rest of their lives with Hermione to try and learn her, to be the parents they wanted to be to her, to make up for the years apart, they all knew that keeping her from her birthright, keeping her in a world that would never fully understand her would be antithetical to being the parents they always strived to be.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her parents were a tad wary about what exactly was on the list for school, it being the oddest school shopping trip they’d ever been on, but Hermes had taken the lead, at the currency exchange, establishing a bank account for Hermione with the Goblins at Gringotts, helping her trade a portion of her muggle money from her bank shaped like a large book into wizarding and storing it in the small vault she’d been given along with his own contribution to the store. He made a note to move her college fund to the wizarding bank and took charge of procuring the things on her list while her parents looked around trying to cling to one another for sanity.</span>
</p><p><span>“Thanks, </span>pappoús<span>,” she said as they walked ahead of her parents who were still staring into the shops, confused and muttering to one another. </span></p><p>
  <span>“Anything for you, mikros,” he said as they journeyed into the shop that had all of the cauldrons apparently. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Cauldrons and then clothes?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Must we save the books for last?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermes laughed, squeezing her hand, “Alright, chemistry stuff, wands, pet, books, and then robes.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She pouted, “You’re plotting against me, pappoús.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Only plotting to get back to the non-magical side of the world before your parents turn tail and run.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She looked back at them looking more and more freaked out as they walked along, Hermione looked up at her grandfather.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You aren’t… surprised?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Me?” He asked with a scoff. “My great-grandmother used to tell me stories of magic quests and things. Considering how old she was when she passed, this isn’t particularly surprising… not to mention solid marble doesn’t move around on its own to help tiny people get up to the higher shelves of the bookcase...”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She smiled, wrinkling her nose at that one. Not to mention Hermione had always been different from other children. Muggle children were usually born with a soulmark. They started off as birthmarks, but by the time one was about five years old, they begun to take shape. Sometimes they were letters, sometimes numbers, they would always be some clue as to when, or if, you would meet your soulmate. They usually changed over time. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Monica and Wendell had their alma maters on insides of their wrists in each other’s neat cursive. Hermes had his wife’s nickname on the back of his left ring finger in her neat cursive. Hermione never had soulmark. When the letter had come from Hogwarts, he could only nod and say that made perfect sense. There was no way his Mia wouldn’t have a soulmate. Wizardry was really the only option. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He didn’t know how wizarding soulmates worked, but he was sure that she’d meet hers in enough time.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione worried her lip, “Do you think… they’ll be okay?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He hummed, “It… will take time, mikros, but they will get there.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione nodded and walked into Potage’s Cauldron Shop. There are a few other groups of people around and though they enter, her parents stay outside, apparently deciding that they needed a moment before entering any place else. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>*</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lily smiled indulgently watching Harry nod and listen to Severus about the differences between the Cauldron makers, insisting that he get the better pewter cauldron made in London by the oldest Cauldron makers in the wizarding world. It was probably the closest thing they would get to a bonding moment for at least another year or so.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I would hate to have to deduct points for melting your cauldron in class.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You wouldn’t!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Severus gave him his normally flat look making Lily and shake her head, “Come on, Harry. We still have to get it engraved.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry nodded giving Severus a suspicious look before picking up the suggested cauldron and moving towards the front to pay for the cauldron he’d selected. Lily turned seeing the very out of place pair. The older man looking at cauldrons and trying to speak to the shopkeeper. His smile bright in his dark face, his hair peppered gray. She would have guessed a grandfather to the young girl who had her face obscured by the Cauldron Magazine she was reading. Only the volume of her hair visible over the top.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Muggles,” Severus said seeing where she was looking. “Rather personable muggles at that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lily smiled turning towards the pair and Severus watched her go. Harry looked up at him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She’s having one of her moments isn’t she?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Severus pat him on the shoulder, “Hopefully you inherit these moments along with your eyes. I assume the wit will come in your seventh year.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry glowered at him, “Just you wait… when I pass Potions with flying colors.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Severus nodded, “That would be a sight indeed.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione lowered the magazine, then looked up at her grandfather before turning to look through the rows of cauldrons, muttering to herself and glancing at the magazine in her hand as Lily grabbed her grandfather’s attention. Hermione looked between the rows of cauldrons by type, then by manufacturer until she found the one she was looking for. She lifted it, finding it surprisingly light and carried it in her arms back to her grandfather who was conversing with Lily and Harry as Severus had gone outside to speak with someone.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mia,” Hermes said with a smile, “Where’d you get off to?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I found the best,” Hermione said, walking towards him with the cauldron she’d picked out. “For a first year at least.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lily nudged Harry who seemed shocked with an amused smile as the cauldron was the very same one that Severus had identified as the best in the lineup. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Be careful,” Lily whispered to him. “It looks like you and Draco will have some competition.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione smiled at them both and held out a hand to shake with Lily and Harry. With niceties exchanged, they went on with their shopping, Lily giving her a kind smile and a pat on the shoulder before leaving with Harry. Severus came back to join them with a shake of his head.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you going to tell me to make friends?” Harry asked as they exited and Lily laughed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s what school is for, dear,” Lily said. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Severus let out a scoff of laughter and continued down the alley to gather the rest of his supplies for school. For Harry, it feels more like a chance for his mother and stepfather to be stopped and asked for an autograph. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione’s trip through Diagon Alley was very odd and exciting. Hermes tricked her with a stop for ice cream and then through three other shops before the bookstore. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You sneaky old man,” he only grinned at her and opened the door gesturing her into the establishment and watching her get lost in the stacks, finding first the books that she needed and three others as they’d agreed upon. What he isn’t counting on is them being the biggest books she could possibly find. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Magic… is a wonder. I’m sure this book is meant to be in multiple editions.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She beamed at him, “I think I rather like the wizarding world.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermes shook his head and helped her get her books to the cash register. She counted out the money herself, making sure she was sure of the amounts before loading them onto her cart and heading out. Crookshanks meowed at her from within his cage contentedly as they headed back towards the rather large fireplace. Minerva sent them to the floo point where they’d parked and helped the load things in before giving her her ticket. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Welcome to Hogwarts, Ms. Granger,” she said kindly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you, Professor.”</span>
