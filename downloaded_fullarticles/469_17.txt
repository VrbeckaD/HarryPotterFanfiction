    <p>She stood tall, looking her death in the eye as he mocked her. She wasn’t afraid, if it worked she would return to the fight and destroy Voldemort, if not the horcrux would still be destroyed and in turn Voldemort would still die, just not by her hand. She watched him raise his hand, “Avada Kedavra.” Harriet could see her body fall, but before it hit the ground she was elsewhere. </p><p>Lily. Her mother was there, as beautiful as everyone said she was and her anger a sight to behold. Her mother grabbed her in a tight hug but before she could speak Lily did. “There isn’t much time, listen carefully, and when you wake do exactly as I tell you if you want to live.”</p><p>The words Lily spoke were almost as strange and foreign as having a conversation with Luna. Betrayals, Theft, and Gryffindors plotting like Slytherins. Contracts wrote to bind her, trap her and if she died like they hoped a will in place to take her apparently vast fortune, Wizengamot seat and Ladyships. Things Harriet has never heard of, people she never suspected. Lily told her what to do, how to escape and survive the next 48 hours. </p><p>She woke in the forest cold, so cold and in so much pain. Narcissa leaned over her, “Is my son alive?” Harriet half nodded and suddenly Narcissa was saving her life and wasn’t that just as strange as her conversation with Lily. She waited for them to move off, and heard Voldemort’s instruction to fetch someone to carry her body to Hogwarts. </p><p>Standing as quickly as her pain filled body would allow Harriet transfigure a log to look like her and then swiftly transformed in to a red fox and headed toward the shrieking shack, running as fast as she could through the woods. Her mother said to save Snape, even though he was a git and an awful person it wasn’t his time. He had things left to do, and like her a new future to navigate. She reached the shack, changed back, and tore open the door only to find Snape bleeding out. Kneeling down she searched through his pockets like instructed and found Dittany and the anti-venom Snape had created after Arthur’s attack. </p><p>Quickly pouring the dittany on his throat while wiping away the blood with her free hand she continued to pour, once the wound closed she grabbed the antivenom and fed it to Snape, massaging his newly healed throat to force the potion down. Once that potion was gone she searched for a blood replenishing potion, did the same with it and waited. She had her instructions and she was going to need his life debt to her. </p><p>Snape woke grabbing his throat, his eyes frantically searching the room before they landed on her. Harriet could feel his sigh before she heard it. “Potter, what the hell are you doing?” </p><p>“Saving your life apparently.” She offered him a hand and pulled him up.</p><p>“You should be at Hogwarts killing Voldemort not here, now GO be the hero.” Snape sneered at her, which honestly if he hadn’t she would have been worried. </p><p>“The horcrux is gone, Voldy AKed me, I saw Mum and I’m back.”</p><p>Snape stared at her, “What do you mean you saw Lily?” </p><p>“Mum said to save you, take you to Gringotts with me and explain everything there.”</p><p>Snape narrowed his eyes at her, “And why should I believe you?”</p><p>Harriett looked down at her nails trying to appear more casual than she felt.  “Mum told me to tell you she knows that you are the one who told Voldemort the Prophecy and that you only asked him to spare her. She said it was an act she will never forgive.” Harriet looked up at him, “Is it true?”</p><p>He stared at her, and she looked him directly in the eye. She could feel Snape forcing his way through her memories and knew he found what he was looking for when he torn his eyes away from hers and staggered toward the wall. “I’ll go with you.”</p><p>“Can you side along us to Gringotts?” </p><p>“Only if you are prepared for them to kill you on sight.”</p><p>“I have a plan, well Mum gave me the plan so I am sure it will work.”</p><p>“Well if Lily is the brains behind it I am sure it will.”</p><p> </p><p>They arrived on the steps of Gringotts with a crack, instantly the guards were on them pushing them roughly up the steps and into through the doors. “It might be a good idea to enact your plan.”</p><p>“Timing is everything.”</p><p>“Hush Thief.”</p><p>One of the tellers saw her and shouted, “The bank is closed, everyone out!” The wizards and witches in the bank all stared at her a started muttering.</p><p>“NO! No one leave. I call the Goblins Oath-breakers and demand an audience with the King.” Harriet shouted over the din.</p><p>The teller staggered back, “You have no right, Thief.”</p><p>“I have every right, I didn’t steal anything. I was merely reclaiming property that two goblins conspired to keep from me. I call you Oath-breakers, and these witches and wizards have a right to know if their money is safe here or not. I deserve to treat with your king to prove or disprove these charges.”</p><p>The teller turned to one of the warriors standing behind him,”Skullcrusher go speak with the King, Firebreath bar the doors until this matter is resolved.” The warriors ran off to do as told and Harriet looked at the faces around her.</p><p>“I think these good witches and wizards should be made comfortable, not to mention seats for me and my companion. Maybe a table, and chairs for your King and his advisers?” Snape started at Harriett in shock, he couldn’t believe they were still alive let alone the fact she was making demands from the goblins. </p><p>“I find myself agreeing with you, Thief, much to my disgust.” He turned and whispered instructions to the teller next to him and chairs for her, Snape and the witches and wizards that were her witnesses appeared, a moment after the table and four chairs fit for royalty appeared as well. </p><p>Harriett looked toward Snape willing him to follow her lead, and went to sit down. </p><p>Twenty minutes later a large group of very well dressed goblins marched in the room, showed their teeth to her and Snape, then sat down. </p><p>“I am King Gringott, I am the eighth King to hold this title; the first to have his honor besmirched by a thief and the first to be accused of being an Oath-breaker. Tell me why I shouldn’t have your head on a pike already.”</p><p>Harriet leaned forward, showed the King her teeth and grinned. “Because Dumbledore paid my account manager, as well as the Black account manager, to hide my heritage from me. They allowed him unfettered access to my accounts after I was emancipated by the ministry when I was forced to compete in the Tri-Wizard tournament, they never once sent me a statement, nor I was ever greeted by an account manager on my first visit. My property was stolen, traded, sold all for the profit of the account managers and Dumbledore. They have denied me my heritage, my vaults, the right to hear my parent’s and my godfather’s wills and as for breaking in...if I had been allowed to claim the Black Lordship I would have already had the Horcrux in my possession.” Harriet leaned back, crossed her arms over her chest and smirk. “So tell me again how I am a thief, and you’re not Oath-breakers.”</p><p>The Goblins on either side of the King were muttering among themselves as Gringott VIII stared at her. “I was told nothing of a Horcrux.” </p><p>Harriet shrugged, “I was public enemy number one, I had other things on my mind, also I don’t see how it is my job to keep you informed of what happens in your bank. I mean it is why you are the King right?” Snape made a small distressed sound and reached over and pinched her leg. </p><p>“Skinshredder, go find Account Managers Twofingers and Picaxe then bring them and the books to me.” The King pulled a dagger from his belt and a sharpener from his pocket. He looked at Snape, who had been silent the whole time and pointed the dagger at him. “Why are you here?”</p><p>“I owe Potter a life debt, she wants it registered and has promised to rent a ritual room here to remove my dark mark.”</p><p>Gringott turned narrowed eyes on her, “You can do this?”</p><p>“I can do a lot of things, the question is do you need my services and how much they are worth to you. The only other ones I’ll do for free are Narcissa and Draco Malfoy, I owe them a debt and should they want this I would consider the debt paid.”</p><p>“We will discuss the cost, and while we do I will send a few messages.” </p><p>Feeling smug Harriet replied with a grin, “You do that. Also I’m starving how long is this going to take?” Snape gasped.</p><p>“As long as it takes. Would you like to register the Professor’s debt and remove his mark?” A guard appeared at his shoulder as he spoke and handed him several thick ledgers. He handed one off to his left and the other to his right. “I will need time to review these and question Twofingers and Picaxe.” He gestured at the two pale goblins now surrounded by guards.</p><p>“Sounds good to me.” Harriett cracked her neck as she stood. “Lead the way.”</p>
