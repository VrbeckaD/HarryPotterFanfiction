    <p>“Thorn! Thornthorn Thorn!” Lyra squawked insistently.</p>
<p>“Yes?” Thorn asked, cracking open one eye to stare at her. </p>
<p>“We should go hunting!” she shouted excitedly.</p>
<p>“Yes, alright,” Thorn shut his eye and pretended to go back to sleep.</p>
<p>“Now Thorn!” Lyra shrieked, jumping onto his head, “We should go now!”</p>
<p>Thorn yawned in response, which shook Lyra off, and made her growl indignantly.</p>
<p>“Don’t ignore meee,” she whined, “you promised we would go!”</p>
<p>“I did not promise we would go at the crack of dawn,” Thorn reminded her. Truly he didn’t mind going now, but it was so amusing to see her get all huffy and annoyed.</p>
<p>“But I want to go, why not now?” Lyra demanded using her forelegs to bounce on Thorn’s snout once again.</p>
<p>Thorn snorted, then stretched and slowly rose from the ground with another yawn, “very well.”</p>
<p>“Yes! Yes yes yes!” Lyra danced around his legs and crowed in excitement. She craned her head up to stare at Thorn, “I want to catch a deer.”</p>
<p>“Have you told Regulus we’re going?” Thorn asked.</p>
<p>“Yes, let’s gooo,” Lyra bounded in an antsy circle.</p>
<p>“One-moment hatchling,” Thorn told her as he reached out for the mind of his rider.</p>
<p>“Murtagh,” nothing, clearly the man was still deeply asleep. Thorn felt bad about disturbing one of the rare nights Murtagh hadn’t awakened to some sort of nightmare or vision of the future.</p>
<p>“Murtagh,” he tried again, and this time he felt a sleepy response.</p>
<p>“Hm - Thorn, wha’ time is it?” Murtagh was not nearly awake enough to have any sort of coherent thought, but Lyra’s impatient demands were growing louder.</p>
<p>“Lyra wants to go hunting,” Thorn explained.</p>
<p>“Now?” Murtagh asked.</p>
<p>“Now,” Thorn answered.</p>
<p>“Okay.” Murtagh’s conscious faded back into sleep. Thorn felt worried that perhaps Murtagh would awaken later and wonder where they had gone off to. But he remembered that Lyra had told Regulus, who would surely remind Murtagh lest he forgot. </p>
<p>“Ready ready?” Lyra was practically vibrating with excitement.</p>
<p>“Oh yes,” her good mood was infectious. Thorn scooped her up onto his back and waited till she settled.</p>
<p>“All set?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Go go go!” Lyra chanted, flapping her wings in excitement.</p>
<p>Thorn spread his own wings and launched himself into the air, revelling as they caught the wind and were propelled upwards.</p>
<p>“Wooooo!!!” Lyra cheered, “go Fasterrr!!!”</p>
<p>Thorn felt laughter bubble up at her enthusiasm, “if I go any faster you’ll fall off,”</p>
<p>“No I won’t,” Lyra chanted, “go fasterrr,”</p>
<p>Thorn sighed, but then he obliged her, swinging his wings to propel himself higher into the air.</p>
<p>“When I’m big, I’m going to fly and catch the sun!” Lyra cried.</p>
<p>“And what will you do with it once you’ve accomplished that?” Thorn asked indulgently.</p>
<p>“I’m going to give it to Regulus, and he’s going to be so happy he forgets to be sad,” Lyra explained.</p>
<p>Thorn hummed, “humans are complicated creatures hatchling, they often make their own troubles, I think it would be an impossible task to make them forget to be sad.”</p>
<p>Lyra whined, “but I don’t like it when he’s sad, and he’s always a little sad, and it -” she switched abruptly into Regulus’ mother tongue. And though Thorn couldn’t understand the specifics, he knew she was complaining.</p>
<p>“I know, but that is something that he must work through over time; eventually he’ll feel better,” he consoled.</p>
<p>Though he couldn’t see her, Thorn felt Lyra fix a glare at the back of his head.</p>
<p>“You promise?” she asked, disbelief clear in her tone.</p>
<p>“I do.” </p>
<p>Perhaps it was not right to promise what Thorn could not be sure of, but Lyra was young, only a month and a few weeks old, she did not need to worry about the sorts of hurts that could not be healed, even by time.</p>
<p>Lyra hummed, and she settled for the moment, contentment radiating through her. </p>
<p>Thorn let the worries of the ground fall from him as he let the wind carrying him, the sun shining warmly on his back.</p>
<p>It would be the end of summer soon, and having lived in the wild forests for nearly a hundred years, Thorn was well used to the change of the seasons. He was looking forward to the changing of the leaves; it had been a genuine surprise when he had first seen it. Murtagh had laughed at him, and then explained that the leaves would be back in the spring, that in the meantime, once the leaves had fallen, the snow would come.</p>
<p>Thorn was not fond of snow, it was cold and wet, and so bland in its uniform whiteness, but Murtagh liked it well enough, and he was certain Lyra would enjoy it.</p>
<p>“Thorn THorn Thorn! Look look!” Lyra’s excited cries broke him from his thoughts, swinging his head around he saw the herd of deer that had caught her attention.</p>
<p>“Well done hatchling,” he complimented, “hang on,” he instructed. Thorn brought his wings in and angled his head downwards, letting the pull of the earth catch hold of him.</p>
<p>Lyra shrieked in delight as they gained speed. </p>
<p>“I want to catch one!” Lyra cried, never mind she was twice as small as the deer below them.</p>
<p>“Wait, Lyra!” Thorn cried as she lept off his back and smashed into a deer. The rest of the herd scattered instantly. </p>
<p>“I got it!” Lyra cheered, as she stood above her catch.</p>
<p>“That was dangerous Lyra!” Thorn cried, “you could have broken your neck!”</p>
<p>“I knew what I was doing!” Lyra called back, “you should go before the deer outrun you!”</p>
<p>Thorn growled in annoyance, loath as he was to admit it, she was somewhat right. There was no way a deer could outrun a dragon, but the longer he waited, the more of a pain in the ass it would be to chase them down.</p>
<p>“Stay here,” Thorn ordered as he wheeled around.</p>
<p>“Good luck!” Lyra called smugly.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“Why didn’t you just wait?” Thorn asked as he landed with his prey.</p>
<p>Lyra looked up from where she was already gorging herself on her own catch. She didn’t respond, just stared at him as she continued to chew.</p>
<p>“That was dangerous Lyra, how do you think Regulus would feel if something happened to you.”</p>
<p>Lyra growled, “that’s cheating.”</p>
<p>“Oh, is it?” Thorn asked, “and why is that?”</p>
<p>“Because he’d be so sad,” she seemed deeply troubled by the idea.</p>
<p>“Exactly,” Thorn agreed softly, “I’d be sad too.”</p>
<p>She poked at her deer guiltily, “well, I wasn’t trying to make you sad, I just knew I had to jump from high; otherwise I wouldn’t catch the deer.”</p>
<p>Thorn sighed, “well now that you know, don’t do it again.”</p>
<p>“Fine,” she huffed, then resumed tearing into her catch. </p>
<p>Thorn turned to his own breakfast, his rumbling stomach making itself known.</p>
<p>They ate in silence for a few minutes before the sound of wingbeats filled the air. </p>
<p>Thorn glanced up as Fírnen descended from the sky.</p>
<p>“Greetings,” he hummed as he landed, “I hope you are well?”</p>
<p>“We are, thank you,” Thorn answered, trying his best to be polite, “And how are you?”</p>
<p>“I am well,” Fírnen came closer, “may I join you?”<br/>
“Of course.” Thorn shifted to the side as Fírnen settled next to him.</p>
<p>There was a long awkward silence, though Fírnen was barely a year younger than Thorn, their first conversation had only been two months ago.</p>
<p>Thorn had not yet decided how he felt about the other. </p>
<p>As old as Fírnen was, he had never fought in a battle where the goal was to down the opponent by whatever means necessary, never felt the rush and the rage and anguish. But he was clearly respected by the other dragons and by the two-legged races. Thorn wasn’t sure if he felt he respected Fírnen in the same way; if he could ever. He certainly wanted to befriend the other dragon, but Fírnen was reserved, and with every passing moment, the possibility seemed to grow smaller. </p>
<p>“I caught a deer!” Lyra crowed. </p>
<p>“A most impressive feat,” Fírnen agreed. Lyra puffed up in pride. Then she tilted her head in thought.</p>
<p>“Did you catch one?” she asked, Thorn, worried Fírnen would be offended at her insinuation he could not hunt, but the other simply huffed a laugh.</p>
<p>“I am not hungry at this moment. I will hunt later.”</p>
<p>“Oh,” Lyra hummed contemplatively, “are we going to talk more about storms today?” </p>
<p>“Actually, we will be talking about the history of the dragon riders today,” Fírnen answered. </p>
<p>“Hmmm,” Lyra tore another chunk from her meal, “is it going to be boring?”</p>
<p>Fírnen gave a startled snort, as Thorn choked.</p>
<p>“Why do you ask that?” Fírnen asked, bemused.</p>
<p>“Regulus said he was bored in his history classes, but we’re going to be talking about dragons, so I wasn’t sure,” Lyra answered, unaware of the befuddlement she had caused the older dragons.</p>
<p>“Well,” Thorn began, “I think the experiences Regulus has had are likely different then what will happen now.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I can’t speak for your rider, but I think the history of the dragons and their riders is quite a fascinating one,” Fírnen added, “for instance, did you know that it was originally the dragons that chose to have riders?”</p>
<p>Lyra tilted her head, “no. But didn’t the dragons always have riders?”</p>
<p>“No,” Fírnen answered, “in fact, there are dragons in Argnor now who have no riders.”</p>
<p>“That sounds lonely,” Lyra commented. Silently Thorn found he agreed. He could not imagine a life without Murtagh, annoying as his rider’s choices could be at times.</p>
<p>“I did not know that,” Thorn confessed, “May I join you for this particular lesson?”</p>
<p>“We would be glad to have you,” Fírnen replied.</p>
<p>They sat in silence for a few moments, before Lyra piped up, “I’m done.”</p>
<p>Thorn hummed, eyeing the half of the deer she hadn’t eaten. “Are you going to finish that?”</p>
<p>She looked at the carcass, “I want to give it to Regulus.” Thorn highly doubted Regulus would want a half-eaten deer corpse, but decided it would be useless to try and explain that to Lyra. She was too young to understand that humans were particular about what they ate. </p>
<p>“Then I shall help you carry it back to him,” Thorn offered.</p>
<p>“Yes, good, let’s go,” Lyra climbed to her feet and looked at Thorn expectantly. </p>
<p>Because Thorn still felt like teasing her, he didn’t move and simply stared back.</p>
<p>Lyra huffed loudly, “Please. Let’s go now please.”</p>
<p>Thorn looked over at Fírnen, “I’m ready when you are.”</p>
<p>Fírnen climbed to his feet, “then we shall go.”</p>
<p>“Yes!” Lyra cheered.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>They found Regulus sitting in a field with Murtagh. Thorn was not surprised in the least. The pair were curled together over a book in between them. </p>
<p>Murtagh glanced up as Thorn’s shadow fell over them, contentment radiating from him. The fear that was always present in his mind was barely a whisper through their bond. </p>
<p>“Having fun?” Thorn asked as he landed and walked closer. Lyra jumping down to present her catch to Regulus.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I’m just realizing that sword fighting is not the only thing I’m rusty at,” Murtagh answered, gesturing to the book.</p>
<p>Despite the self-deprecating joke, he seemed happy enough, and that pleased Thorn.</p>
<p>Murtagh turned to look at where Lyra was presenting her gift to Regulus. He pressed a hand over his mouth to hide his snicker at the pinched look on Regulus’ face.</p>
<p>“Did you catch that yourself?” he asked Lyra, amusement seeping into his voice.</p>
<p>Regulus gave him an unamused look.</p>
<p>“I did!” Lyra boasted happily. </p>
<p>“That’s good; it’s nearly lunch-time,” Murtagh commented, “now we don’t have to go find something.”</p>
<p>“That’s right!” Lyra cheered</p>
<p>Murtagh pulled himself to his feet. Then he offered a hand to Regulus, pulling him up easily when he took it.</p>
<p>They headed back towards the cottage Arya had given them. “You seem happy,” Thorn commented to Murtagh.</p>
<p>“It’s nice to sleep without prophetic dreams for once,” Murtagh replied. </p>
<p>Thorn was sure that part of it, but he was equally sure that spending the morning with Regulus was another. </p>
<p>Now that they had settled the business with King Orik and the human King Ajihad, Murtagh had no reason to worry about his friend anymore, and so could finally enjoy Regulus’ company without worry.</p>
<p>“I am going to join the dragon’s class this afternoon,” Thorn commented half worried Murtagh would be upset. But he was pleasantly surprised when his rider simply nodded.</p>
<p>“I hope you have a good time.”</p>
<p>“I’m sure it’ll be exciting.”</p>
<p>Murtagh grinned, “I’m sure it will be.”<br/>
***</p>
<p>“You aren’t coming with us?” Thorn asked when Regulus began to say his goodbyes to Lyra.</p>
<p>“We have…” Regulus waved his hands for a moment, “fighting!” Lyra offered helpfully, as Thorn saw an image of Sionra holding a sword. </p>
<p>“Ah,” he hummed, “then I wish you good luck.”</p>
<p>Regulus nodded, “thank you,” he turned to Lyra, addressing her in his language. She shorted and replied, something that made him huff and shake his head. </p>
<p>It was a rather amusing relationship the pair had. Murtagh thought it was rather funny how Regulus always fussed over Lyra, but Thorn was sure Lyra fussed in her own way, it just involved far more threats and violence.</p>
<p>“Let’s go!” Lyra cheered when she had finished her conversation with Regulus.</p>
<p>“After you,” Thorn said to her. </p>
<p>They made their way through the trees to an open space where Fírnen and the other two dragon trainees were. </p>
<p>Thorn was not sure he wished to spend time with Hurana and Vornongr, especially Vornogr, because of the feud between Sionra and Murtagh, Thorn was on bad terms with the pale orange dragon.</p>
<p>“You have told us you’d be gracing us with your presence,” Vornongr commented idly, “I would have made preparations.”</p>
<p> “No need to burden yourself, I know you feel inadequate next to my glorious self,” Thorn said as he settled on Hurana’s other side. He would not abide by a dragon half his size insulting him and getting away with it.</p>
<p>Vornongr growled.</p>
<p>“Peace friends,” Fírnen ordered, “we are all here for knowledge, there is no need for grudges.”</p>
<p>“Are we going to talk about battles?” Lyra asked.</p>
<p>“Yes, surely there must have been some great feats,” Hurana chimed in, “I am most interested to hear of those.”</p>
<p>“Yes, battles are a part of what we will be discussing, but there are many other interesting subjects as well,” Fírnen explained. </p>
<p>“Like hunting!” Lyra piped up in excitement.</p>
<p>“Yes!” Hurana added. </p>
<p>“Of course, but I was thinking more along the lines of the great diplomats that were among the order of the dragon riders, you see in the ancient age -”</p>
<p>“What’s a diplomat?” Lyra yelled, interrupting Fírnen’s sentence.</p>
<p>“Oh well, they are a person who speaks with others to achieve a specific goal,” Fírnen began to explain, only to be interrupted by Lyra blurting something. He stopped and sent Thorn a confused look.</p>
<p>“I think she’s just repeating the word, but in Regulus’ language,” Thorn offered sheepishly.</p>
<p>Fírnen hummed, “well as I was saying -” he then launched into a long speech about several ‘important’ dragon diplomats and scholars.</p>
<p>Thorn had to fight to keep his attention from wandering after an hour. He was regretting his decision to come after another hour. And he felt terrible about it, this was clearly a subject of great interest for Fírnen, but he was quite certain that both Vornongr and Hurana had stopped paying attention after the first ten minutes, and Lyra was clearly fast asleep. </p>
<p>“And that concludes the accomplishments of Nolgrun. Now his significant works include -” Fírnen continued, oblivious of his audience’s disinterest.</p>
<p>Thorn was done; he did not care about Nolgrun in the least. Stretching out his mind, he reached for the bond he shared with Murtagh.</p>
<p>“Murtaghhhh,” he groaned, “if I have to hear one more word about Nolgrun I’m going to claw my own snout offfff. </p>
<p>Amusement curled through their bond, “I don’t know what to tell you Thorny, you made this choice.”</p>
<p>“But I regret it, tell me something interesting to distract me,” Thorn whined. </p>
<p>“Regulus is trying to fight Tazuz, but Tazuz won’t fight back and just keeps knocking him off his feet.”</p>
<p>“You’re at the training?” Thorn asked, “and Sionra hasn’t tried to stab you yet?”</p>
<p>“Oh no she did, but then I knocked her over, and she fell on her ass,” a sense of smug glee went through their bond at that comment, “now she’s yelling instructions at Regulus, but he doesn’t know enough of the technical terms she’s using to understand.” </p>
<p>“That sounds infinitely more amusing than what’s happening here,” THorn groused.</p>
<p>“Oh, it is.” And Thorn was presented with Murtagh memory, wherein Regulus was trying to hit Tazuz, but the urgal kept sidestepping him until Regulus lost his footing and crashed to the ground. Tazuz only stood by and waited patiently for Regulus to stand up before the same cycle repeated itself. </p>
<p>“-orn, Thorn, Thorn!” Lyra’s cries pulled Thorn back into awareness.</p>
<p>“Yes?” He looked down at her, and she was bouncing, “we’re talking about battles!” she shouted in delight, “you’ve fought in battles, right?” </p>
<p>Thorn glanced around; he noticed that Fírnen, Vornongr, and Hurana were looking at him expectantly.</p>
<p>“I- yes. Though I don’t think they would be of any interest to you,” Thorn did not want to talk about the war he and Murtagh had been forced to fight for Galbatorix. </p>
<p>“Why not?” </p>
<p>Thorn curled his talons in, “they were not very honorable, and I would not have fought them if I had a choice.”</p>
<p>“Oh,” she hummed thoughtfully.</p>
<p>“Then we will not press you,” Fírnen acknowledged, “now the battle of -” and launched into another long story.</p>
<p>Thorn did not pay attention. He couldn’t fight off the awful feelings that had resurfaced with the memories.</p>
<p>Though the bond, he could feel Murtagh probe lightly, a quiet question if he was alright. Thorn sent a reassuring feeling in reply. He would be fine.</p>
<p>He turned his mind back to Fírnen’s lecture.</p>
