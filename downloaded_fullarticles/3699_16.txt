    <p>Kyoutani was walking back home through the damp streets of London, his hands deep in the pockets of his coat. It wasn’t raining yet, but it was only a matter of time. The sky was grey, heavy on his head, and he hurried, burying his head in the collar of his coat. His eye caught a movement as he crossed a backstreet and he stopped, peering through the not-so-clear air. He heard a slight noise and stepped forward: a dog was growling and barking at something hidden under garbage. Kyoutani walked faster and the dog hurried away, letting him push aside the empty card-boxes and other stuff to find a small, drenched dog curled up on himself and sleeping tightly, seemingly of exhaustion.</p>
<p>	“Poor thing”, Kyoutani murmured, “I can’t leave you here.”</p>
<p>  He opened the top of his coat, picked up the dog that almost fit in his hands and tucked it against his chest. It was shivering and smelled badly, and was probably hungry. He checked briefly for a collar but found none, before resuming his walk back home.</p>
<p>  He was unlocking the door to his apartment when the dog woke up, disorientated and yapping angrily.</p>
<p>	“Calm down buddy”, he said, his voice not as gruff as it usually was, “you’re safe with me.”</p>
<p>He took off his shoes as he entered, discarded his coat and rolled up his sleeves before putting down the dog in his sink. The animal was looking at him curiously, growling and showing its teeth. He poured warm water on the other side of the sink before putting the dog in and carefully washing its long, tangled, muddy fur. The dog quieted down, his trembling stopping as he warmed up, and Kyoutani wrapped him up in a towel. Once clean and dried, the small dog looked really cute. It was a Pomeranian with long, dark fur that he would need to brush later. He gently scratched it behind its ears before putting it down on the floor.</p>
<p>	“I’ll give you something to eat”, he said, taking out what was left of the meat he had eaten the day before, warming it up and cutting it to small pieces in a plate. He filled a bowl with clear water and put it besides the plate, before spreading newspapers in a corner of the room.</p>
<p>	“No poo elsewhere”, he said, pointing to the newspaper, “okay?”</p>
<p>  The dog stared at him and for a moment he had the feeling at was telling him “are you stupid?”. He then went off to take a shower, putting on an old pair of sweatpants and warm socks before he prepared himself some dinner. The dog was curled up next to the couch, staring at him while he ate, and did not stop watching him when he washed the dishes.</p>
<p>	“You know staring like that is a bit creepy”, he said, turning to the dog.</p>
<p>It yelped and he cursed as he turned back to the sink and found his sponge scrubbing his plate dutifully.</p>
<p>	“I hate it when it does that”, he grumbled, before he slumped on the couch.</p>
<p>The dog was still staring and he patted the couch next to him.</p>
<p>	“C’mon little guy”, he said, extending his hand towards the TV’s remote control, which floated through the room and into his hand.</p>
<p>The dog managed to jump on the couch at the third attempt and sniffed his hand, and he would have sworn there was an intelligent gleam in those dark eyes. A bit later he turned down the TV, yawned and went to bed. He distinctively heard the dog running after him and watched it settle in a corner of his bedroom. A few moments after, he was sleeping.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>  Kuroo waited until he was sure the Muggle was sleeping tightly before turning back into a human. He hated how helpless his Animagus form was, but at least he was somewhere warm thanks to it. His robes were clean though torn, and his hair as hopeless as ever.</p>
<p>	“<em>Muffliato</em>”, he murmured, towering over the Muggle.</p>
<p>But was he really a Muggle? He had distinctively seen him using magic. A Muggle-born wizard, then? But why would he be living like a Muggle, then? It made no sense. The only thing he knew was that if the guy was a wizard, then he had to hurry out of there before he was discovered as being an Animagus.</p>
<p>	“<em>Accio wand</em>”, he then said, extending his hand, his own clasped tightly into his fist.</p>
<p>But no wand came flying into his hand. Now that was getting weird. He walked out of the bedroom and through the small apartment. There was no sign of anything magic there. There were… what did Muggles call these? <em>Plugs?</em> Plugs, he decided, walking around. And no chimney, thus no Floo network connection. So not a wizard. <em>But he used magic.</em> Were there untrained wizards in England? He couldn’t remember. He <em>should</em> have payed attention to his History courses. Well, Potions and Defense Against the Dark Arts had been way more fascinating.</p>
<p>  His eyes fell on the “fridge” and the idea of food – more food – made his stomach grumble. He opened it, took out food and quickly set to a meal that he practically inhaled. Then he searched again, opening drawers and locked doors, and finding nothing, <em>nothing</em> that could suggest a wizard was living here. Once he was sure there was nothing to fear from him, he pulled a vial from his robes, hanging from around his neck, and clasped it tightly in his hand. He was going to find a way to make up for what he did, and no one would stop him. He only needed a place to settle and make experiments, now that his own house had been taken over by the Ministry of Magic.</p>
<p>  He put the vial back, returned to the bedroom and changed back to his Pomeranian form. He struggled a bit but finally managed to climb into the Muggle’s bed. There was no way a Muggle slept in a bed while he slept on the floor.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>  Kyoutani woke up to small bundle of warmth against his stomach, slightly surprised at first. Then he smiled: the little dog had climbed in bed with him and was sleeping peacefully against him. He lightly scratched its head, which woke him up.</p>
<p>	“We’ll need to find you a name”, he rasped sleepily. “A cute name because you are a cute doggy.”</p>
<p>The Pomeranian didn’t seem too happy at this perspective, nuzzling his open palm.</p>
<p>	“Alright, what about Caramel?” he asked, and the mighty beast lightly bit his finger. “That’s a no then. Spooky? No again? Bagel? Pancake? So you don’t like food, then. Black? A bit simple, isn’t it?” He thought for a moment. “I know! Kuro!” He seized the small dog and held it above him. “Kuro it’ll be, it fits you!”</p>
<p>Kuro seemed to be looking at him in disbelief, and he laughed quietly. Kyoutani finally got out of bed and went to the kitchen, where he gave food to Kuro who had followed him, before going to the bathroom and dress for work.</p>
<p>	“You’ll be coming with me”, he said. “I work at the local zoo.”</p>
<p>  He took a backpack out before cooking breakfast. Soon enough, he had put Kuro in the backpack before going down the street to buy a red harness and a leash for him, before walking to the bus stop that would stop not far from the zoo. Kuro was surprisingly calm in his back, but he supposed it was a nice thing. Probably these small dogs were easily tired. That was a good thing, he didn’t have time to take him for long walks. His job wasn’t the most interesting thing ever, but he got to be near animals.</p>
<p>	“You know”, he said to Kuro, “when I was a kid I wanted to work in natural reserves in the States. I don’t think I can actually do that, but I’m saving money to go to University and learn how to take care of animals to become a caretaker here.”</p>
<p>	“Who the hell are you talking to, Kentarou?” one of the caretakers asked – it was Yahaba, always meddling with things he shouldn’t have.<br/>	“He’s cracked up, Shigeru”, Daishou laughed, and Kyoutani glared at him.<br/>	“Ignore them”, he said to Kuro, ignoring them himself.<br/>	“C’mon Ken, we’re just teasing! Show us what you’ve got… Oh my, Shigeru, look at how cute it is!”<br/>	“Keep your filthy reptile-lover hands away from Kuro”, Kyoutani growled as the small dog smelled Daishou’s hand that was petting him.</p>
<p>  He didn’t seem to like what he smelled, because his small pointy teeth closed on Daishou’s hand, making him yelp.</p>
<p>	“Son of- He bit me!” he cried out, showing off his punctured hand.<br/>	“That’s because you’re an ass”, Kyoutani retorted. “Kuro is an angel.”<br/>	“Is he now?” Yahaba said, carefully petting the dog, who growled in response. “Kentaro this beast is nowhere nice!” he replied, whining.</p>
<p>Kyoutani didn’t answer, gathering his things and setting to work. He cleaned up the alleys and made sure everything was ready to welcome clients, before taking a stroll around with Kuro. The small dog seemed to be fascinated with Daishou in the snake enclosure, where he was murmuring something to them. That made Kuro growl and Kyoutani walked away. Having the dog bark would break havoc there.</p>
<p>	“I don’t like Suguru either”, Kyoutani said, “but he sure knows how to deal with snakes. I had never seen that before.”</p>
<p>  He took Kuro from his backpack, keeping him in his arms, delighted to have the small ball of fur with him. He planted a kiss on Kuro’s head after making sure no one was around. He didn’t like it when people knew how soft he really was – he felt vulnerable. Animals, especially dogs, were trustworthy. Suddenly, Kuro started to bark, and Kyoutani turned around: for a reason he didn’t know, there was a penguin walking up to them.</p>
<p>	“What the actual fuck”, he murmured, “come here”, he said, extending his hand towards the bird.</p>
<p>  He jumped when the penguin wheezed through the air and right in his arms, almost making him drop Kuro.</p>
<p>	“Shit”, he cursed, looking around, but no one seemed to have seen him.<br/>	“I knew it”, a voice said.</p>
<p>Kyoutani turned, still holding the penguin and Kuro, now completely frightened. Kuroo could feel his heart rate grow crazy: Kyoutani was panicking. Daishou was standing there, grinning.</p>
<p>	“You are a wizard too”, he said.</p>
<p>Kyoutani’s eyes widened.</p>
<p>	“What? No! Wizards don’t exist!”</p>
<p>Daishou laughed loudly.</p>
<p>	“You can stop hiding from me, Kentarou! Come on, between wizards!”</p>
<p>He extended a hand towards him and Kyoutani took a step back, the two animals held close to his heart. Even without magical powers, Kuroo could feel his fear. One thing was sure: Kyoutani had never heard of wizards, or else he wouldn’t have reacted in such a fashion. How he had escaped magical education was another question. What was worrying Kuroo, however, was that his fear might trigger a disaster. And Kyoutani seemed to be powerful. Very powerful and completely unpredictable.</p>
<p>  Daishou didn’t seem to have caught on the same thing, as he stepped closer, growing impatient.</p>
<p>	“Kentarou, you can stop pretending, now!”<br/>	“Get away from me!” Kyoutani growled, Kuroo felt the strength of his spell, though unconscious.</p>
<p>  Daishou stopped moving completely, unable to come any closer. He looked angry now, and he whipped out his wand from nowhere. Kuroo sighed. Even if he was on the run, he couldn’t let a wizard duel a novice. That went against his ethic. He jumped from Kyoutani’s arms, changed his form and pulled out his wand.</p>
<p>	“Stand back”, he simply said.</p>
<p>  Daishou effectively jumped back out of surprise, and Kyoutani imitated him. Now if the Muggle didn’t have a heart attack he would be lucky. </p>
<p>	“Who the hell are you?!” Daishou cried out.<br/>	“It is none of your concern. You are frightening this Muggle-born, can’t you see?”<br/>	“Why would Kentarou be afraid of a fellow wizard? He’s done nothing wrong!”<br/>	“Get away now or I will have to use force”, Kuroo threatened.</p>
<p>  Daishou only steadied his wand. <em>Too bad</em>, Kuroo thought before snapping his wrist. Daishou collapsed when the Stunning spell hit him, and Kuroo turned to Kyoutani. The young man was deathly pale, clutching onto the penguin, eyes wide with fear. He seemed to be unable to move, but Kuroo wasn’t reassured.</p>
<p>	“Kyoutani-san”, he said, “I wish you no harm. Please do not be afraid.”</p>
<p>  Slowly, he walked closer and took the poor bird from Kyoutani’s arms. It could wander around; someone would soon pick him up.</p>
<p>	“You… You were a dog!” Kyoutani finally said.<br/>	“Yes”, Kuroo nodded, “I know it is a shock for you and you might have a lot of questions”, he said, “but for now you need to sit down and drink a bit. Preferably at home.”</p>
<p>  Kyoutani didn’t move, so Kuroo gently took his elbow to lead him away from the Stunned wizard on the floor. That wasn’t really helping the peaceful image. When Kyoutani’s automatic pilot seemed to have switched on, Kuroo went back to his Animagus form. The way back home seemed really, really long, and Kyoutani didn’t say a word through it. Finally, they arrived to his apartment, and Kuroo resumed his human form. His torn and tattered clothes didn’t really help either, but Kyoutani followed his lead and sat on the couch.</p>
<p>  Kuroo took out his wand.</p>
<p>	“<em>Accio glass</em>”, he simply said, and he poured water in it from the pitcher before handing it to Kyoutani who seemed to have come back to his senses, though he still looked a bit dazed.<br/>	“You were a dog”, he repeated again.<br/>	“Yes”, Kuroo confirmed again. “Some wizards can achieve an unchangeable animal form. Mine is a Pomeranian.” Not willing to frighten him even more, he knelt by his feet to be able to look at him. “I am a wizard, Kyoutani-san. And you are one too.”<br/>	“No. It is impossible, wizards don’t exist!”<br/>	“I saw you perform magic. You should have gone to a Wizarding and Sorcery School by your eleventh birthday, I have no idea why no one noticed you. But you definitely are a wizard.”</p>
<p>  Kyoutani’s hands were trembling when he pushed them through his hair, trying to process the thought. Kuroo knew that as strange as it seemed, it also explained all the weird things that had been happening around him – at first only when he was angry, sad or frightened, but slowly, as he progressively lost control, at the most innocuous moments.</p>
<p>	“And who… who are you?” he said. “You’re not British.”</p>
<p>  Kuroo chuckled. That much was obvious – his accent was thick, though his English was quite good. And he looked very much Asian.</p>
<p>	“My name is Kuroo Tetsurou, Kyoutani-san”, he said, bowing his head, “and I come from Japan.”<br/>	“Why were you buried under trash in your dog form?” Kyoutani said, a bit brazenly.</p>
<p>  Kuroo studied him for a moment. If he could get Kyoutani to help him… Then maybe things would be easier?</p>
<p>	“I owe you the truth”, he said. “Back in my country, I was trying to create a new magical instrument. Things… didn’t go well. I have to admit I used Dark Magic to get the results I wanted, but it backfired terribly. Now if it had only been about that, I would have paid my debt. But… my friends were victims of it, and I am the only one capable of helping them. So I fled with the hope that I’d be able to find a solution.”</p>
<p>  He had a feeling honesty would get through to Kyoutani more easily than a lie. He wasn’t wrong, he realized, as Kyoutani slowly nodded.</p>
<p>	“You can stay here”, he said, “if you help me control this… magic. My life’s been hell because of it. I don’t want it.”</p>
<p>  Kuroo nodded.</p>
<p>	“I can teach you magic and how to use-”<br/>	“I don’t want to use it”, Kyoutani cut him harshly, “I just want to get rid of it!”</p>
<p>Kuroo gaped. He was more powerful than most wizards, and yet he didn’t want it? Still, he nodded. He’d managed to make him change his views on the matter. He could always lie to get him a wand, and the rest would be a piece of cake.</p>
<p>	“We have an agreement, then.”<br/>	“And sit on the couch, not on the floor”, Kyoutani grumbled.</p>
<p>  Kyoutani looked really flustered, probably thinking back to all the things he had said to the dog that was really a human. Kuroo chuckled in a low voice and sat on the couch next to him. Kyoutani grabbed two covers, gave him one and wrapped himself in the second, settling comfortable before staring at him.</p>
<p>	“Now, explain everything”, he said.</p>
<p>And Kuroo did.</p>
