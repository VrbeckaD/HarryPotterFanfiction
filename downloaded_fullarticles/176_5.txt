    <p>From afar, Draco could see the lights. He’d never seen the building before, of course, but strangely it was exactly what he had imagined. It was the complete opposite of Malfoy manor, that was for sure. There were no elaborate gardens. No peacocks running around, knee-height fences to stumble over when it was dark and no high fences around the gardens, if there were any at all. One of the few similarities would the presence of wards were probably all around the house, but Draco couldn’t sense the presence of magic yet. They weren’t on the premise yet.</p><p>“Draco,” Snape called over his shoulder. “Get a move on. We can’t afford to be tracked and caught now.”</p><p>That sounded much more familiar already. Exasperatedly, Draco sighed and brought up a hand to pinch the bridge of his nose, as though that would do anything to cure the lingering headache that he’d been stuck with for a couple of days already. Arguably, the headache was the person telling him to move along. Snape was the kind of person that any person could only handle small doses per day of. Draco had been stuck with the Potions Master ever since they fled the scene and lost Bellatrix and the others, though. That was when Snape harshly reminded him that he failed his task and that the Dark Lord better not find him, because it wasn’t going to end well for him. And because Snape made an Unbreakable Vow, he’d been hiding Draco since and lying to the Dark Lord about it.</p><p>Draco hadn’t asked what Snape told the Dark Lord, and subsequently the other Death Eaters and his parents. The thought crossed his mind that maybe Snape had said that he was dead, but they would know that was a lie right away: he could be tracked through his Dark Mark, and the Mark was still active. Perhaps the best excuse had been that Draco fled the scene at the first opportunity. It was realistic because that was how they thought of him – that he was a worthless coward -  and Snape would never get any blame. He merely did what the child, as they called him, couldn’t do.</p><p>Well, the worthless coward and the blood traitor made a great pair, Draco thought sarcastically as they approached the newest hide-away that Snape had picked out for him.  As it turned out, Severus Snape was a liar and a blood traitor. It figured. Snape had been siding with the Order of the Phoenix since the start of the war. Not to give information to the Death Eaters, but to give them information about the Death Eaters. When Draco exasperatedly asked ‘but why?’ he’d been told it was none of his business. Whatever the case be, the Potions Master almost lost his double-triple spy status when he killed Dumbledore, but apparently some of the wiser (if there was any such thing) members of the Order of the Phoenix had such blind faith in Dumbledore’s faith in Snape that not even killing the old man was too much of an issue.</p><p>Idiot Gryffindors. Anyone with an inch of self-preservation would not have any faith in Severus Snape (or Albus Dumbledore, for that matter) and his clean conscience. He killed a man. Alas, he killed a man so Draco didn’t have to do it and subsequently kept him alive. He couldn’t hold too much grudges against him for that reason. What he hold a grudge about, however, was where Snape decided it was best to hide him for a while.</p><p>Truth be told, he wasn’t sure who had lost it more: Snape for thinking it was a good idea, or Molly and Arthur Weasley for actually agreeing with it. Vaguely, Draco remembered an incident between Arthur Weasley and Lucius in Flourish and Blotts. Of course, that was also when Lucius slipped Arthur’s daughter (Ginevra?) the horcrux-diary to open the Chamber of Secrets. Realistically, Molly and Arthur Weasley should not let any Malfoy in their home ever.</p><p>Yet here they were. Draco could feel the surge of magic as they passed through the wards that had been placed around the strangely-built house in front of them. Snape had told him where they were after apparating earlier: Ottery St Catchpole, in Devon. Draco had never heard of it. So far, what he got of Ottery St Catchpole was hills and meadows. It looked quite peaceful. Perhaps it was in peace time, he thought. It made the ideal place to fly around and play some quidditch. The muggles, who no doubt lived in Ottery St Catchpole as well, wouldn’t even see it. There were no houses around the Weasleys’ residence that Draco had seen from where he had walked.</p><p>Snape knocked on the front door of the house. Draco stood still behind him and looked up at the building. He could count five chimneys at first glance and figured that whenever they needed another room, they must just have built it on top of the existing structure. To a muggle it must look like it was about to collapse, but it was clearly held up with magic. It was a very strange building, but it didn’t seem to bother Snape at all.</p><p>They heard footsteps at the other end of the door and seconds later, Draco heard a voice that he assumed belonged to Mrs Weasley. “Who is it?” She sounded nervous, but he figured that was natural considering the hour that they arrived at and the current circumstances in the wizarding world. But then again, a Death Eater wouldn’t exactly knock on the door. They would come crashing through the roof. And surely their wards would hold, Draco thought, so a Death Eater wouldn’t be able to find them at all.</p><p>Other than the two standing at her door, that was.</p><p>“Molly, it’s Severus,” Snape replied. He looked aside at Draco briefly, the kind of glance that Draco couldn’t interpret if he tried. “I have him with me.”</p><p>Promptly, the door was opened after what sounded like multiple locks being undone. The logic on that escaped Draco. Snape stepped in first, passing by Mrs Weasley, and Draco followed him after looking at Mrs Weasley briefly who was standing by the door. He stood still half next to and half behind Snape like a child hiding behind one of his parents and folded his arms over one another uncomfortably. A first look around made him conclude he was standing in the Weasleys’ kitchen, which was also the dining room if the table with a bunch of chairs standing there was anything to go by. It smelled like someone had just cooked in there and had just done laundry as well. Neither Draco could relate to, because at home House Elves did all that and he didn’t come nearby the creatures.</p><p>Mrs Weasley shook hands with Snape before averting her gaze to him. When she spoke, however, her words were directed at Snape. “Severus, what have you done to him? He looks like he hasn’t slept well or had a good meal in days,” she observed crisply before moving in the direction of the kitchen counter. “Do you want some soup, dear?” she asked. “I made extra because I knew you were coming tonight and that you may be hungry.”</p><p>Not usually one not to have a witty remark at the ready, Draco felt awkward and uncomfortable when Mrs Weasley addressed him like that, if she was at all. No one called him <em>dear </em>and especially not someone whose resistance leader he tried killing multiple times. He looked at Snape, who looked back at him and gestured in the direction of Mrs Weasley.</p><p>When he still didn’t speak, Snape sighed exasperatedly. “Draco, for the love of Merlin, you’ve been whining to me for days. I know you can reply for yourself, so do it.” </p><p>“Yes, thank you, Mrs Weasley,” he said eventually.</p><p>She turned around to smile at him. “Have a seat at the table, dear, and make yourself comfortable. I’ll show you to your room once you’ve eaten. It’s always better to sleep with a full stomach.” She looked over at Snape then. “Will you be joining him for dinner, Severus? There’s still plenty left.”</p><p>To Draco’s surprise, Snape was actually kind to her. “No, thank you, Molly,” he replied. “I ought to get going or it might get suspicious. Wormtail keeps asking me where I keep disappearing to. It smells delicious, though. Perhaps another time.” Maybe, Draco figured, it was just impossible to be unkind to a woman like Molly Weasley. No one was that kind. No, no one should be that kind.</p><p>Snape turned his gaze to Draco then, calculating and concerned like Draco had seen it be the entire school year. He felt inclined to throw another temper tantrum at Snape because people looking at him like that made him very tired, but it hadn’t helped throughout the school year and he doubted that it would now. He spent the year repeating that he was fine, that he didn’t need help, that nothing was wrong with him and that he could do it and now here they were. Perhaps Snape should be the one throwing a temper tantrum at him for all his bullshit.</p><p>“Behave yourself, Draco,” Snape said eventually. “I know this situation is far from ideal for you, but this is the best we can do. Don’t screw it up.”</p><p>Draco looked aside to look at Snape briefly and shook his head then. “I’m not stupid enough to screw this up,” was all he said.</p><p>Clearly, Snape thought that Draco didn’t like this. He didn’t, that was for sure, but he was also completely aware that this was the best option for him for the other alternatives were worse. Hiding from the Dark Lord in a place with a roof over his head, a bed to sleep in and a kind woman giving him soup to eat was better than staying in abandoned places where wards had hastily been put around and eating Snape’s disgusting leftovers.</p><p>“That’s what I’m counting on,” Snape said.</p><p>Draco made his way over to the kitchen table slowly and choose the seat as far away from the kitchen counter and Molly Weasley as possible as Snape approached Molly. He heard them speak softly, but he couldn’t understand the words they were saying. He also didn’t want to eavesdrop, so he tried not to try it. Instead he extracted a bottle of water from his bag and took a few slow sips. Afterwards he put it down in front of himself, leaned back on the chair and closed his eyes.</p><p>He heard Mrs Weasley and Snape say goodbye as the latter left and the former locked the door again. He was officially left in the Order headquarters. If they weren’t entirely convinced that he was a child in over his head they just chanced leaving a Death Eater here, so they must be sure, Draco thought. He personally wasn’t so sure. If he had a chance at finding out information and running back to the Death Eaters at hopes of redemption, he may just. But who wouldn’t? He didn’t want to be seen as a blood traitor and spent his days with the Weasleys. He wanted to go back to his parents and be useful to the cause. He wanted to prove they were wrong, even when they clearly weren’t.  </p><p>“Draco, honey,” Mrs Weasley spoke, and Draco’s eyes flew open. “Would you rather go to bed first and have some food afterwards? You seem very tired.” The words didn’t at all sound judgemental, whereas Draco felt like she should make him feel bad for potentially making her warm up soup for nothing.</p><p>“No, thank you, Mrs Weasley,” he was fast to say, almost stumbling over his words. “I’d really rather eat first, if that’s not too much of a burden.”</p><p>Molly Weasley studied him briefly with the gaze of someone who didn’t know what she was seeing but was determined to figure it out. It made Draco incredibly uncomfortable and made him want to fold his arms over one another defensively. After a moment it passed and Mrs Weasley smiled. “Of course not, dear. You’re never a burden here. And your soup has just been warmed up.”</p><p>Draco highly doubted that, but he found it wisest not to comment. He watched with tired eyes how Mrs Weasley moved back to the stove and filled an entire bowl with the soup from the pan on the stove. It looked to Draco like she had made soup for weeks with a pan as big as that. She got a spoon from a drawer and headed back over to him to hand it over.</p><p>“Thank you, Mrs Weasley,” he thanked her politely as he tried smiling. He blew on the soup in hopes of cooling it down before he took a small sip and was pleasantly surprised by the taste. Apparently Mrs Weasley didn’t need House Elves to make good soup. “This is really nice, Mrs Weasley,” he tried complimenting her awkwardly.</p><p>“Thank you, dear,” she said, still standing by the table. Instead of walking back into the kitchen, like he expected her to, she took a seat in front of him. She folded her hands over one another and put them upon the table before taking him in again and smiling. “When you’ve had enough, I’ll take you up to your room,” she said. “We have a full house, but we moved some things around so you could have a room of your own. You’ll take Fred and George’s room. You can also borrow some old clothes from the twins. Bill, Ron and -” she paused briefly before she continued, “and the others don’t have your height and Severus said you only managed to bring a small amount of your own clothes.”</p><p>That was accurate enough, albeit Snape didn’t quite know how much Draco managed to bring. With the knowledge that he may have to flee the scene and wouldn’t exactly have time to pack, he researched a charm that would allow him bring loads of stuff in a small bag. He landed on the Extension Charm, which had turned out to be quite useful. He had brought books, notebooks, potions and clothes alike in the small bag that he carried with him at all times but was only ever seen taking out a bottle of water, so it seemed that no one was the wiser.</p><p>“That’s very kind of you,” he said. “Thank you, Mrs Weasley. That really helps.”  That was when he paused to take another spoonful of the soup, which was just as good as it had been with the first few sips. He wondered if all of Molly Weasley’s cooking was this good. “Is there anything I can do to return this favour somehow?” he wondered. “I feel very uncomfortable asking this of you. I don’t know how any of your family members agreed.”</p><p>“You don’t have to worry about that, Draco,” Mrs Weasley reassured him. “If you want to help out in any way, I have just the chore for you. Severus told me you’re excellent at brewing potions when you set your mind to it. Could you help us out with that, dear?” Draco nodded, and Molly continued. “Arthur should be home soon. He collected some ingredients on his break, so I’ll look into what would be most useful for you to brew for us. But only when you feel rested enough to do it.”</p><p>Draco opted not to get into feeling rested, because he doubted he was going to anytime soon. He hadn’t slept well since last summer and by now he had given up on it ever happening. When he fell asleep after hours of tossing and turning it didn’t last long and was disturbed by nightmares frequently. Being in a place he didn’t know probably wasn’t going to help him sleep much either.</p><p>“Is your husband still at work?” Draco asked, checking his heirloom watch habitually. He stiffened once he realized how much the watch was worth and how little the Weasleys clearly had to spend if their house was anything to go by. “It’s late.”</p><p>“It’s very busy at the Ministry, of course,” Molly replied. “Arthur got promoted last year. He’s the head of the Office for the Detection and Confiscation of Counterfeit Defensive Spells and Protective Objects. Rufus Scrimgeour created the office to make sure the panic surrounding Voldemort,” Draco flinched visibly, but Molly carried on, “isn’t taken advantage of by people who sell fake charmed objects or advertise about fake protective charms.”</p><p>Draco remembered his father making fun of Arthur Weasley for having the possibly most unimportant position within the entire Ministry of Magic. Apparently Rufus Scrimgeour recognized that the Weasleys were close to Dumbledore and tried to get into their good graces. It was all political, but that didn’t mean he had to say it aloud and spoil Mrs Weasley’s obvious glee about the promotion. It must be nice to feel valued, he guessed.</p><p>“That’s wonderful,” he told her as he tried smiling again. “He must be doing important work if he’s still not home at this time.”</p><p>Mrs Weasley smiled again. “That’s very kind of you to say, Draco. I’m sure he’ll be home soon.”</p><p>His soup was getting cold, Draco registered absent-mindedly. And with his stomach in knots like it had been for over a year now, he also knew he wasn’t going to be able to empty the bowl. Even if he had complimented Mrs Weasley on the food as soon as he tried it, he worried regardless that she may think he didn’t like it enough to finish it. Perhaps he was worried about everything because he didn’t want to give them any reason to kick him out. If they kicked him out he had a problem in the form of the Dark Lord wanting his blood. Better to be friendly.</p><p>Eventually, he had to cave in and admit he couldn’t finish the bowl of soup. Mrs Weasley didn’t seem to take offence to that. With a seemingly handy non-verbal spell she let the bowl be rinsed in the sink and lead him up the stairs to the room that she said had been Fred and George’s. There were two beds in the room, some boxes standing to the side and the room’s scent was a little odd, but it was obvious by the open window that Mrs Weasley had tried getting the scent out.</p><p>“You can find the clothes on the spare bed,” Mrs Weasley said as she walked in first, gesturing at the bed that wasn’t made yet. Draco saw multiple piles of clothes, mostly with bright colours that would not in any way fit him. “I laid out a few of everything, since I didn’t know what you most needed. But you’re welcome to use everything. That’s what the clothes are for. Do you sleep with the window open or closed, dear?”</p><p>“Closed, please,” Draco replied as he moved into the room slowly. The bed looked oddly comfortable and he felt ready to collapse in it. He watched as Mrs Weasley closed the window and made her way back out of the room then.</p><p>“The bathroom is down the hall if you want to freshen up, Draco,” she told him as she lingered in the doorway. “Sleep however long you want to. I’ll make sure the others are quiet when they wake up. If you want some food, you can come downstairs and I’ll help you find it.”</p><p>“Thank you,” Draco replied, and this time the smile felt like it came genuinely. “I really appreciate it, Mrs Weasley. Thank you for letting me stay here.”</p><p>“It’s not a problem, dear,” she reassured him again. “Good night. I’ll be downstairs for a little while longer if you need anything.”</p>
