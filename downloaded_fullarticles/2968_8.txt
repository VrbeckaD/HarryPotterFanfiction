    <p>reserve asked: Kylux, things u said through your teeth :3</p>
<p>—</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Officially, they’re having a meeting. This conference room is booked in their names; they’ve got it for an hour, although no one’s requested it after them. The translucent floor-to-ceiling windows have darkened to nearly entirely opaque: no one walking past could see more than ideas of shadows. Hux is never quite sure how good the soundproofing on these things is.</p>
<p>Inside, Hux’s belt buckle is undone and his trousers shoved down to his thighs. One of Ren’s gloves sits on the table, and it’s all Hux can see from his vantage point, shoved roughly down upon the conference table. Ren’s slick finger presses insistently inside Hux’s ass. Hux tries not to rock back on it. He wishes he had something to bite down on.</p>
<p>“I hate you,” he says through gritted teeth. Ren laughs, a hollow sound inside the mask. He works another finger inside.</p>
