  <u>Prologue</u>
</p><p>Many years ago, there were three very different and unusual brothers with a strange talent. They all had the ability to commune with Death. They found they could talk with those that had already died. They could control any corpses that they brought out of the ground. Ghosts were solid to the touch to them and they could walk with spectres of the deceased when walking through cemeteries. </p><p>These brothers were called the Peverell's and were a well known family in the somewhat secluded and secret wizarding society. They were a prestigious, influential and rich family of purebloods but even in a world where magic was the norm and everyone could do incredible things, being able to hear the secrets of the deceased and control dead bodies was not something anyone else could do and so the Peverell brothers were revered and envied for their skills, but also feared. </p><p>However, there were those in the wizarding world who wanted to know the secrets of the Peverell's powers. They wanted the gifts they had supposedly been given by Death itself. So they plotted and they planned on how to gain those powers. But there are no secrets kept from the dead and the Peverell's were informed of the plot to gain their secrets. </p><p>What no one knew or even suspected was that their gift wasn't connected to the 'gifts' Death had given them. But those trinkets did have a purpose of their own and they knew it was only a matter of time before they lost them. So they made their own plan. </p><p>Only, they didn't make the plan in time. Before they could implement it, the oldest brother and owner of the Elder wand was murdered in his sleep. The wand disappearing along with his killer. </p><p>With the whispers of their brother in their ears, they decided to call upon the one who had given them their gifts. He had to know what was happening in the wizarding world. He had to know that there were people who wanted to have the supposed power over Him. </p><p>So He was called. </p><p>And a new plan was made. </p><p>No one would ever know their secrets or how they did what they did. No one would ever know the secrets of the dead again until one that Death found worthy of His gifts was born from the Peverell bloodline once more. </p><p>And so the remaining two brothers died. Leaving only a fairy tale and myth behind them. </p><p>And the secret to talk with the dead died with them. </p><p>Until another was finally born from the Peverell line with the ability and there was a necromancer once more in the world. </p><p>Shame no one knew what a necromancer was.</p>
