    <p>While reflecting on his life Harry James Potter comes to the realization that while he is followed with what many believe is the worst luck in the world, he is still an extremely blessed person. For someone at the young age of twenty-five Harry has been through so much in his life that many probably wouldn't have survived and yet here he is, laughing with his friends with a smile on his face. Harry finds himself relaxed surrounded by his group of friends at the local pub, sitting at their usual table which has empty bottles placed in the middle, while his friends are laughing hysterically as they are animatedly telling stories with expressive gestures, Harry finds himself going back twenty years ago to one of his fondest memories.</p>
<p>Unfortunately this memory is also the beginning of his misfortune; in a small sleepy town called Godric's Hollow, a six year old Harry is being tucked into his bed by his father James Potter a tall, thin, man with caramel skin, hazel eyes and dark unruly hair and his mother Lily Potter who is a beautiful women with long thick dark red hair, with ivory skin and bright emerald eyes. After a long day of Harry running and playing with his father along with his father’s best friends Sirius Black and Remus Lupin till late that night to then go trick or treating, Lily finally convinced Harry to get out of his police man costume and put him into bed.</p>
<p>The small family was enjoying Harry’s favourite story Babbity rabbit and her cackling stump from the magical children's book the tales of beedle the bard with Lily reading while James acts out the characters to the best of his abilities. Harry's eyes were finally closing hugging his aged red deer plush toy, little tears visible within the fabric stitching with an missing ear that was never found after Harry’s teething months, when a loud BANG downstairs startles them, coming back to reality Lily and James jump into action.</p>
<p>“Get Harry and get out now” James shouts running out of the door, slammed shut behind him.</p>
<p>“Come here Harbear I need you to be quite while we go on a little adventure” Lily grabs Harry who is still clutching his deer close.</p>
<p>Running towards the window with Harry in her arms a deep menacing laugh can be heard over James shouting at the intruder, as Lily gets one foot out the window she suddenly freezes hearing another BANG then complete silence. With teary eyes Lily turns round to the sound of the bedroom door being opened, placing Harry behind her, shielding him, she reaches and grabbed her gun out from the gun holder against her lower back, pointing towards the tall man with jet black hair and sharp features in front of her.</p>
<p>“Get out of my house Riddle! Leave my son out of this, he hasn’t done anything” Lily shouts trying to keep Harry out of view who is now trying to stay hidden, cuddling his plush toy as tight as possible.</p>
<p>Riddle just laughs making the hair on the back of Harry’s neck stand on edge, slowly raising his gun towards Lily with an evil expression of glee spreading across his face;</p>
<p>BANG<br/>BANG<br/>BANG</p>
<p>The three shots echoed through out the now ominously silent house as Harry looks around to the find the scary man laying motionless on the ground across from him as his eyes suddenly finds his mother with wide unblinking eyes, starting to walk towards her Harry suddenly feels a scorching pain in his forehead. Everything starts to go blurry with tears falling down his face as black dots slowly appear in his vision, collapsing onto the ground next to his dead mother Harry finally looses consciousness.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Harry finally wakes up, regretting it almost instantly his eyes starts to burn from the fluorescent lights reaching his already sore eyes, after adjusting to the lights he realises that he isn’t at home in his warm bed and starts to freak out.</p>
<p>“Mum?” Harry calls out his voice breaking in fear.</p>
<p>“No honey” a calm voice whispers making Harry whip his head round to see a blurry figure to his right.</p>
<p>The blurry figure reaches forward and places Harry’s glasses on his face as everything comes into focus to see a tall slim women with her blonde hair tied up into a bun sitting down in the chair next to his bed in her lime green scrubs watching him with a worried look.</p>
<p>“My name is Narcissa dear, can you tell me yours?” Narcissa asks quietly placing a hand on top of Harry’s.</p>
<p>“Where am I?” Harry wonders with fresh tears falling down his face.</p>
<p>“You are in Saint Mungo’s Hospital Harry, can I call you Harry dear?” Harry nods wiping his eyes “Can you please tell me what you remember?”</p>
<p>“A bad man broke into my home” Harry looks around frantically “Where is my mum and dad?”</p>
<p>Narcissa hugs the crying boy pressing the button to call in the doctor to allow letting them know the boy in her arms has finally awoken.</p>
<p>“Harry dear, please look at me” Narcissa pauses in thought locking her blue eyes into Harry’s green eyes “I have just called the head doctor in to come have a look at you, you have been in a coma for the past two months and I’ve been watching over you dear, I knew your parents and when I heard what happened to them I immediately knew I had to watch over you” Narcissa pauses once again looking into Harry’s eyes, placing her hands on top of his “I’m not sure if I’m the right person but your parents have passed on, I’m so sorry Harry.”</p>
<p>Harry curls up into a ball, crying his little heart out as the doctor walks into the room to find Narcissa embracing Harry into a tight loving hug, whispering to the boy’s ear trying to calm him down as the doctor goes over Harry’s vitals making sure he is all okay after waking up from the coma once the doctor leaves as the young traumatized boy finally falls back asleep still hiccuping.</p>
<p>As the days pass onto weeks Narcissa is by Harry’s side most of her shifts looking after the now silent boy reading him stories, telling him about her son who is just a few months older than Harry while also trying to get him to eat, at first her efforts are seemingly wasted as Harry just sat there looking out his window. Eventually Harry starts to smile at Narcissa’s stories and slowly eats the food she brings in that she even sneaks some of Harry’s favourite chocolate in as a treat for Harry. A couple of days later a tall, thin older man with long grey hair pulled back into a pony tail walks into Harry’s room sitting on the second chair next to his bed sitting beside Narcissa, looking at Harry with his blue eyes sparkling over half moon spectacles.</p>
<p>“Hello my boy, I am Detective Dumbledore” the man explains showing Harry his silver detective badge “I am the lead investigator in your parent’s case, I just wanted to come in and introduce my myself to you and see how your going my boy”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry detective but I’m not sure if the doctor’s have told you, Harry hasn’t talked in a while”Narcissa explains with a sad expression on her face.</p>
<p>Soon later Detective Dumbledore left the two with the parting words of the social workers have found Harry’s last remaining family and they will be coming to collect him in couple of days after he gets discharged as they are getting everything ready for his arrival.</p>
<p>Harry’s last day at the hospital were a blur for him, in the late morning his relatives arrive to come collect him, his mother’s sister Petunia Dursley is a thin, blonde haired women with nearly twice the usual amount of neck, her husband Vernon Dursley is a big beefy man with hardly any neck, a large purple face with thick dark hair and a bushy moustache and their only son Dudley who has thick blonde hair and is extremely fat for a boy of six. When they arrived they said nothing towards Harry just talked to the doctors and collected his stuff waiting for the doctors to finally discharge their nephew.</p>
<p>On the way out Harry catches Narcissa, he immediately runs up to her and gave her a big hug “thank you” he whispered making the women cry as she has come to love the little boy as if he was her own over the past weeks. As they make their way to the car to Harry’s new home, Detective Dumbledore’s words ran through Harry’s head “my boy, I know it will be strange living in a new home and also in a new area but these people have proven that they will love you and take care of you.”</p>
<p>No one knew how wrong it was to leave Harry to live with the Dursley’s at number four Privet Drive.</p>
