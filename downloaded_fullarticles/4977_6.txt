    <p dir="ltr">The pretty blonde sat beside her older, black-haired sister, watching a young girl run through the Muggle playground, playing in the snow. “She’s gotten so big, Andromeda. How long until she’s due for school?” Narcissa asked her sister, purposefully not mentioning the name ‘Hogwarts’.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Call me Andy, please. 3 or 4 years now. I'm not sure what I'll do without her.” Andy replied sadly, pulling her coat further around her. Nymphadora was all she had left, with her husband dead. A commotion behind them broke Andromeda from her thoughts. A brown haired woman was screaming and shaking a child, who appeared to be crying. The only words Narcissa could catch made her glow with rage.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I never should have listened to him! He said I’d grow to love you, but I’ve never felt anything but contempt for you! I never wanted children and now I’m stuck with you forever!” Narcissa, forgetting her prim upbringing entirely, stalked over to the rude woman and terrified child followed closely by her sister.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Release the child carefully, and I’ll do you no harm.” The young blonde growled.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Who the fuck are you?” The Muggle snarled “Are trying to tell me how to live my life? Fuck off!”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Release the child carefully, and I’ll do you no harm.” Narcissa repeated, wishing she could Crucio the brunette for abusing the little girl.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Monica! What are you doing, Monica?” The women turned in unison to see a rotund man heading quickly towards them.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Gladly,” Monica glared at Narcissa. She picked up the little girl and shoved her into Narcissa’s arms without so much as a goodbye.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“What’s going on?” The young man asked, having reached the two upset women.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I’m done with that fucking monster, Wendell! I can’t do it anymore! The blonde bitch can keep her for all I care!” Monica screamed at the man who appeared to be her husband.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Narcissa stared at the couple, feeling like she’d been confounded. The man, Wendell, looked at Lauren sitting in Narcissa’s arms, stated a simple, “Take good care of her, please.” And walked off with his ranting wife.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“What just happened, Andy?” Narcissa wondered aloud, looking down at the fluffy-haired child in her arms who was still wailing and reaching for her parents.</p>
