    <p>A black greasy-haired man sat in his office holding a bottle of firewhisky and in the company of a man with long blond hair who also had a bottle of firewhisky. The man who had black hair was called Severus Tobias Snape who was the potions master and potions professor of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The man with long blond hair was called Lucius Abraxas Malfoy who works for the Ministry of Magic.  </p><p>"So Severus, how is teaching going so far?" Lucius asked.</p><p>"It could have been worse," Severus said.</p><p>"What do you mean by that?"</p><p>"Well, one of my students Ms. Granger is a very intelligent witch. I would give her points publicly in the class but, if I did, I would have to hear Draco say something like "Wait until my father hears about this." But, I give her points but, I do it secretly. She currently has and Outstanding in potions. </p><p>"And what about Potter?" </p><p>"Well, I think he could be very skilled at potions. But, the Weasley brat keeps distracting him by talking about Quidditch. And I have a feeling that a lot of the students in my house sabotages his cauldron."</p><p>"You know, this just popped up in my head but, how much would you pay to see Granger beat my son to teach him a little more manners?"</p><p>"Any amount. And if I had the power to do so, I would award her Order of Merlin, First Class," Severus responded smiling.</p><p>"Care to go on a walk?" Lucius asked.</p><p>"Sure," Severus responded as he got up from his seat.</p><p>When Severus and Lucius were on the hill that led you to Hagrid's hut, they saw Hermione pointing her wand at Draco.</p><p>"It seems like your wish has come true Severus," Lucius said smiling.</p><p>"YOU FOUL EVIL LITTLE COCKROACH!" Hermione yelled pissed off.</p><p>"Draco was probably laughing that an animal that was on only defending itself is going to be executed," Lucius said.</p><p>"Come on Hermione he's not worth it," Ron said.</p><p>Hermione hesitated for a bit but put her wand away and walked away from Draco.</p><p>Draco and his goonies then started to laugh again. Hermione turned back fast and socked Draco in the nose hard.</p><p>Severus and Lucius were laughing very hard now.</p><p>"Five Hundred points to Gryffindor," Severus said.</p><p>"He how about when we go back inside, we celebrate that by having another bottle of firewhisky,"</p><p>"Yes, we will do that," Severus said.</p><p>Severus and Lucius then heard from Draco as his goonies were running away say: "Wait until my father hears about this." Which made Severus and Lucius roll their eyes.  </p><p>When Severus and Lucius continued to walk, they saw Buckbeack get hit with an ax. Which made Severus and Lucius sigh in annoyance that the hippogriff got executed. Right after they saw Buckbeack get executed, they saw Hermione burying her head into Harry's shoulder.</p><p>"You know seeing Potter and Granger like that reminds me of Lily and James," Severus said.</p><p>"It reminds me of them too Severus,"</p>
