    <p>"Mr. Graves, I was just informed by Mrs. Penny that your consort has arrived."</p><p></p><div>
  <p>Percival looked up from the desk where he stood, hovering over some papers. "Thank you Ms. Goldstein."</p>
  <p>Queenie cleared away the tray of Percival's afternoon coffee and tea cakes, before leaving his office. Percival tried not to think of it, of his <em>order</em>. But he'd been distracted from his work, and now all he wanted was to rush home and see what the man looked like.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>It was a special order, a <em>consort</em> of sorts, straight from school (The Salem Society, which Percival thought was a fitting name) so he'd be freshly trained and in his prime. Percival had saved up for years for this moment, and now he was trapped at work, under a pile of paperwork that never seemed to end.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>By the time six o'clock rolled around, Percival was itching to go home. He put on his coat, and left it unbuttoned as he walked out of his office. He waved to a few Aurors he saw on the way out of the building, MACUSA's expansive open entryway bustling with people leaving work for the day.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>He walked the half hour home, far away from the center of the city, steps quick over cobblestones. He dodged puddles, and crossed traffic easily. New York City was his home, he could expertly navigate his way through it.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>He got up to his residence, a large single family home lined with trimmed grass and tall shrubs to hide the first floor windows from view. He waved his wand as he got near, and the front gate automatically opened. He walked gingerly up the front steps as he glanced up, at the second story window above the front door where he knew the man was waiting.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>He unwrapped his scarf and Mrs. Penny helped him take off his coat. She was a short, stout woman who had too much work on her plate to be able to pin her hair correctly. That's half the reason Percival had placed the order, so that she could have some help, or atleast that's what he told everyone about the new addition to the household.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>He went up the staircase that lined one wall, trying not to look too eager. It was narrow, so was the hallway that wrapped around and led to the master bedroom, with two smaller rooms on the sides. Percival stepped into the room, the door squeaking a bit as he pushed it open and he was eager for what he would find.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Credence stood by the claw-footed loveseat, hands at his sides, head bowed. He wore nothing more than a waist sash tied at his hip, and pinned with a simple brooch. It barely covered <em>anything</em>. He wore simple jewelry, adorned with a gold earring in each ear and two thin gold bracelets around his wrists. <em>He must be freezing</em>, Percival thought as he walked past Credence. He passed behind him to turn on the steam radiator that was attached to the far wall.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"What's your name?" He asked curiously, husky voice drawing Credence's attention.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Credence raised his head an inch, like he'd been waiting to be called upon. "Credence."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Credence," Percival purred as he walked back to the boy. He stopped in front of him, Credence's eyes still downcast. "When was the last time you ate, Credence?"</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"I don't know, sir."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Are you hungry?"</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Yes, sir."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"I'll have Mrs. Penny bring you up something." Then Percival turned and walked to a small machine that looked like a gramophone. However, instead of cranking it and music coming out, Percival cranked it backwards and called down to Mrs. Penny in the kitchen. Credence dared to glance up when he heard her voice coming out of the magical machine, and took that moment to look at his owner.</p>
  <p>Credence's gaze fell again as Percival turned, Credence's eyes torn away from the well-dressed figure. He was older, Credence noticed, and that didn't bode well for him. The older ones were more set in their ways, more likely to let the cruelty of the world jade them, and then pass that cruelty down.</p>
  <p>Percival walked past Credence to the bedroom, and Credence remained standing. He was still, waiting for an order, the picture of a perfect subservient male <em>attendant</em>. Percival still hadn't decided on a title for him. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>He came back out with a robe in hand and held it out to Credence. Credence looked down at the silky thing, a light pink color with cream colored lace around the edges. The silk felt smooth under his fingers as he took it, staring a bit deftly.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"For a little decency, hmm?"</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Credence put the robe on, the feel of it foreign, bare chest now partially covered. He tied a bow in the front, waiting for an order. Just then there was a knock on the door.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Come in," Percival called, walking to his large kidney desk to go over some financial paperwork.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"I brought the soup you requested, Mr. Graves."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Thank you Mrs. Penny. On the coffee table should be just fine."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>She put a tray down with a bowl of soup and a saucer, a slice of bread next to it, and a small glass of water. Percival didn't look up, and Mrs. Penny didn't say anything about the boy in the pink robe.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>When she left, Percival glanced over, and tilted his head slightly to the side. "I thought you said you were hungry."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"I am, sir."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"So eat."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>At the command, immediately Credence went over to the tray. He sunk to his knees on the rug on the floor, legs tucked under him, and he began to lift spoonfuls of steaming hot chicken noodle soup into his mouth.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Percival raised an eyebrow again as he watched Credence devour the soup. It had to be burning his tongue, Percival just knew it. And the way he downed the entire glass of water in barely more than three gulps told Percival that something was off. He watched as, in two minutes flat, Credence ate a ten-minute meal.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>When he was done, Credence looked down at the tray, as if disappointed. Then he leaned back slightly, hands placed gently in his lap. He waited, frozen for the next command. Percival wasn't sure just how severe his training had been, but suddenly he felt sad, and anxious for the boy. He spoke up.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"You could have sat on the couch, you know."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Credence's eyes searched left to right, flicking fast as he thought of something to say, some way to answer the question that wasn't really a question.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Were you cold, waiting for me?"</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Yes, sir."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"I'm sorry about that. I forgot to notify Mrs. Penny to turn on the heater before your arrival."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Again there was silence, Percival again confusing Credence who knew nothing more than to be obedient and serve. So Percival spoke up, "What do you like to do with your free time?"</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"I don't know, sir."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"You don't know?"</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"No, sir."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>That whole "sir" thing was going to get really old, really fast. Percival let out a quiet humph, and turned his attention back to the paperwork on his desk. "Well this is certainly going to be quite interesting," he muttered more to himself than to Credence.</p>
</div><div>
  <hr/>
</div><div>
  <p>That night, Credence was numb by the time they went to bed, just after eleven. He'd spent the better part of several hours sitting on the loveseat, waiting for Graves to finish up what he was doing. When Graves asked him if he was tired, he'd nodded, given a formal "yes, sir," and Graves had waved him into the bedroom.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>The room was small, though lavishly decorated with a bureau and a bed that had a cream colored comforter, with a bed skirt around the bottom. Credence waited next to the bed, waiting to be invited in.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Graves got undressed, his back to Credence. He wasn't sure how he felt about the whole <em>man servant</em> thing; the man seemed pretty empty, like an empty bowl waiting to be filled. When Graves turned around in long sleeve pajamas with a breas  pocket, he saw Credence still dressed and he looked like he was... waiting.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Well, what're you waiting for?" Percival asked as he pushed down the comforter on his side and removed both of the shams from the bed.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Credence scrambled, immediately laying out the robe and the sash on the trunk at the end of the bed. He gained another raised brow from Percival as he slipped under the covers, completely naked.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Percival put his wand on the bedside table, and turned off the lamp. Then he got in to bed and Credence barely moved in the spot next to him. Percival sighed, rolled onto his back, and snuggled in. He'd slept in a chair in his office twice in the past week, and was grateful to have a reason to come home to sleep in his own bed.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Beside him, Credence stared into the darkness. The house was quiet, a few creaks here and there but for the most part it was peaceful and the night remained undisturbed. Credence lay on his side, facing Percival, watching, waiting.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>When Percival began gently snoring, the noises of an older man who'd lived through nearly 40 years, Credence blinked. He continued to stare, the stories he was told at the Society running through his head.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>This was his first night, his <em>very first</em> night. It was supposed to be like a brides wedding night, and yet Percival hadn't touched him. He hadn't even laid a hand on him one way or the other, and now he was asleep, and Credence suddenly wasn't sure what to do. He was shaken to his very foundation by Percival, who was blissfully unaware of the turmoil going on in Credence's mind.</p>
