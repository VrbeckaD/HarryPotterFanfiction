    <p>Master of my Heart </p><p> </p><p>Prologue</p><p>Kyla Nott had never been one to fear storms.</p><p> She sipped delicately at the small cup of espresso that sat between her manicured fingers as she listened to her best friend Minette go over yet again what they were going to wear to BeauBuxton’s annual Gala.</p><p> It happened every year and now in her sixth year, she was truly hoping that for once it wouldn’t bore her to death. </p><p>With bright blue eyes, and long platinum blonde hair that cascaded around her broad shoulders in ringlets, at a size 22 in women’s clothes even for Parisian standards she was considered plus size.</p><p> </p><p> But never mind that. </p><p>She never did and no one else that she knew did either. </p><p>She always was a favorite with the neighborhood Parisian boys and she smiled deviously as images and memories played in the back of her mind. </p><p>She almost didn’t notice when Minette started to frown and looked towards the doorway to the café. </p><p> </p><p>A look of confusion crossed her own delicate features as she turned to see what could be capturing Minette’s now full attention. </p><p>It was there that her eyebrows furrowed in even more confusion as she saw her French guardian and confidante rush towards them as a storm raged heavily outside. </p><p>Her guardian looked flustered, worried and even distraught making Minette pale ever so slightly.</p><p> Both girls blinked as Madame Forester stopped in a huff and began to weep loudly making them glad that they were the only ones to partake in the café’s late night activities at this hour.</p><p> </p><p> “Madame Nott, it is terrible! Truly terrible. They took everything! Nothing is left but an empty shell of a place. You must go immediately. You need to be safe. At least there is a place for you to go.”</p><p> Kyla got to her feet and held out her hands to embrace the woman who meant so dearly to her. </p><p>“Madame, what on bloody earth are you talking about? What has happened?” </p><p>She asked as the woman burst into a whole new onslaught of tears.</p><p> “Your parents, mon amour. It is your parents! The Aurors! They stormed the house and your parents have been found to have evidence of the Dark Lord’s return. You are in great danger. All has been prepared for this moment though. You are to leave at once! It is the only way. The only way you will be ensured safety in these terrible times.” </p><p> </p><p>Kyla felt hot wet tears run down her face and knew her mascara was all but gone as Minette embraced her and held her close crying along with the doll like girl.</p><p>“Come, mon amour. You need to come quickly. The port key will only be open for so long. Say your goodbyes. You will not be returning to this place.” </p><p>Her guardian said softly as Kyla’s face matched the look of horror on Minette’s.</p><p> “Don’t worry, Ky. I shall see you again. I promise this on my life.”</p><p> Minette said softly in her ear as Kyla nodded and embraced her friend one last time before following her guardian quickly out of the café and leaving her now cold espresso with a heartbroken Minette. </p><p>The storm raged around them, and now Kyla knew. She was most definitely afraid of storms and all that came with them.</p><p> </p><p> For her life was now a never-ending storm and the tears of sadness and anguish that followed felt like they never would be ever wiped away. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>End of Prologue</p><p> </p><p>Chapter 1</p><p> </p><p>	Draco puffed out an exasperated breath as he watched the storm rage outside the manor’s tall floor to ceiling windows.</p><p> His bedroom was dark and the evening had a sense of foreboding that couldn’t be shaken by even the happiest thought.</p><p> He was now 17 and in his sixth year at Hogwarts.</p><p> The holidays were approaching fast and his heart hammered hard in his chest at the thought of what was to come this year after so many years. </p><p>It was the year of many things for the young Malfoy and he smirked proudly out at the raging skies knowing that he was quite ready for them all. </p><p>This year he was to be inducted into the Death Eaters just as his mother and father were at his age, and he would begin to carry out his duties to the Dark Lord, the one who was most cherished among his kind of people. </p><p> </p><p>He felt the excitement run it’s course through his veins as he thought about the other exciting piece of his life that would soon fall into place. </p><p>His mother and father had approached him last year letting him know that this year, around the holidays, he would find himself finally in a marriage contract with a young woman of his choosing. </p><p>She would be pureblood of course from one of the best families. </p><p> </p><p>His blood pumped furiously, and his cock twitched at the thought of someone finally being his own.</p><p> </p><p> His. The one he was meant to be with. It was about time. </p><p> </p><p>He felt like everyone had already begun signing marriage contracts and he was going to be left out in the bloody cold if it didn’t happen soon. </p><p>He scoffed at the idea. Malfoys don’t get left in the cold. </p><p> </p><p>They lead. They conquer.</p><p> And that was exactly what he intended for his well…intended. </p><p> </p><p>She would be his not only in name but her very soul. </p><p> </p><p>She would bear his children and carry on the legacy that his ancestors had created so long ago. </p><p> </p><p>Somewhere in the dark house a clock chimed and he knew. </p><p>It was time. </p><p> </p><p>Theodore was coming over soon and he was anxious to hear school news and whatever else his best friend had for him.</p><p> They planned to get thoroughly drunk and hoped to go down to the local bar and pick up women who didn’t know much better. </p><p>Needless to say, sex was sex. </p><p>Whether muggle or pureblood he didn’t care.</p><p> A woman was a woman. </p><p>Sex was sex. And his cock twitched at the thought.</p><p> Growing big and hard inside his trousers he shook his head knowing that if his father or mother knew where he was going and what he was doing they would be petrified with horror. </p><p>Muggles were not to be touched. </p><p>But Draco could never resist a good piece of ass. Footsteps sounded from the Foyer leading up to his room and he nodded to himself. </p><p>Theodore had arrived and now was the time to forget any worries that he may have, and live like he would live forever. </p><p>Because in a Malfoy’s case, he may very well do so.</p>
