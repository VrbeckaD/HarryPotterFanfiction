    <p>School means anything but fun. Even the word on its own sounds blunt, boring, <em>catastrophic</em>. Those were the thoughts that were buzzing in Sirius Black's head as he tapped his finger against his leg. He lazily glanced out of the blurred from the smoke window of his train cabin, trying to distinguish the usual figures of his friends within the crowd of wizards and witches biding their goodbyes to their children.</p><p>His sixth year in Hogwarts was about to begin and his friends were late, <em>as usual</em>.</p><p>The sudden jolt of the cabin door caused the boy to snap his head to it, only to find out that one of his best friends and classmate, Peter Pettigrew, was trying to open the door as if it was a magically sealed diamond door. Having occupied one of the window seats and not intending to let it go, Sirius simply twirled his wand and the door was opened.</p><p>Peter stepped inside the cabin and ran a hand nervously through his light brown hair, "Hi, Sirius."</p><p>Sirius answered with a nod of his head and looked behind the boy, "Did you happen to stumble upon any of the other two idiots who probably overslept?"</p><p>He shook his head in denial and took a seat across him, "I-I think Remus will be-"</p><p>"Oh, in the name of Merlin's blue balls, I'm stuck with you for one more year?"</p><p>Just outside the cabin stood none other than the arrogant, messy-haired James Potter, wearing his usual cocky smirk and crooked Gryffindor tie. Sirius couldn't help but smile back playfully, shoving the four-eyed boy's leg with his foot when he sat besides him.</p><p>"I thought that we'd get to see you in front of Hogwarts with your bed still attached on you."</p><p>James flipped his middle finger right in front of the dark-haired male's face, "And I thought I'd find you pining Marlene McKinnon against the hallway."</p><p>Sirius made a face full of disgust, "That was one time and hell no am I going to do it again. She may be charming but her tongue in my mouth was anything but that."</p><p>The two other boys chuckled, giving a high-five to each other for unearthing this unpleasant memory for their friend. James scratched the back of his head, or more precisely <em>beehive</em>, and sensed his cheeks taking fire, "Marlene might be like this but her best friend is . . . woah."</p><p>Sirius raised his eyebrows in amusement, "Oh, Lily Evans? The girl you've been chasing for six years straight but has not even bothered sparing you a look? At least I took a taste of her best friend." He scrunched his nose at the memory. "Maybe it's time to let go of the grip you have on her and search for someone new. Maybe you'll find someone who isn't a ginger."</p><p>"You think that I like her for her looks? If I wanted a ginger, I could go for her best friend." James sighed dreamily, staring at the foggy window as if he was falling in love with it. "She's much more than her looks."</p><p>Peter snickered, "As if you'd know."</p><p>Suddenly, all three of them shook back and forth from the sudden movement of the train. The Hogwarts train was leaving off for the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Yet the Marauders group was incomplete.</p><p>Sirius greeted his teeth, "That damn Remus . . . "</p><p>"That's weird," mused James, fixing his glasses on his nose. "The straight O's boy is not on board and late? He must have died."</p><p>Peter shook his head in disapproval, "I'm gonna miss Remus."</p><p>Sirius whacked the back of Jame's head and kicked Peter's leg, "You two are bad troll luck with bones and flesh so shut the bloody hell up."</p><p>The four-eyed boy simply snickered and remained silent as the candy cart rolled by. He was the only one who bought something from their company; a chocolate frog and Red Dragon brownies. Never failing to give you an explosive taste in your mouth.</p><p>"Why so jumpy, Padfoot?" he mused as he opened his Chocolate Frog, revealing a Dumbledore card. "Wait until you listen all about this week; I almost got Muggle-arrested! Father almost disowned me, too, but I don't think I deserved my almost-given punishment. I nearly replaced all the water in this fish tank called aquarium with fire and . . ."</p><p>The more James rambled, the less Sirius paid attention to his endless story. Usually, he would listen to every word he spelled, just so he could throw witty remarks and frustrate the boy. But that day was different and he couldn't pinpoint what exactly bothered him to the point he would act out of his character. Maybe it was Remus' unusual absence, leaving the "amazing four" incomplete. Or maybe it was the ever-growing tension in his household, deranging from his parents' constant fighting about him to his brother's sudden decision.</p><p>Royal grey eyes were focused on the changing surroundings out of the window, fields taking the place of other vast lands. Scotland was famed for its unlimited crop fields and its immense amount of animals. Little did the boy know that two pairs of worried eyes were staring at him this whole time he was spacing out.</p><p>"Sirius," James' voice boomed in the narrow space. The said boy snapped his stare towards his friend. "Did anything happen this last week?"</p><p>"Eh, you know, the usual! Girls, finishing my room decoration with new motorcycle posters I . . . found in . . ."</p><p>His grey eyes were locked at something by the door and he trailed off, causing both of his friends to turn and look at . . . a mop of pale blonde hair vanishing in the corridor. A second after, it reappeared with its owner who held a notebook in her hands and motioned with her pen on the air in front of her, as if she was writing on the atmosphere. The girl swirled around and locked her eyes on the Marauders' cabin.</p><p>And in the next moment, she had entered the cabin and had occupied the seat besides Peter. All three boys were stunned and stared at her figure until the bravest decided to speak up.</p><p>"Excuse me, but . . . " James trailed off.</p><p>The blonde girl rose her head from her notebook and looked at the boy across her, "Yes?"</p><p>Peter, even though he was startled to Hogwarts and back, cleared his throat, "Who are you?"</p><p>"Oh," she mused, raising her eyebrows. "Pandora Lovegood." And she returned to noting down Merlin knows what.</p><p>James opened his mouth to say something but Sirius clasped his hand over it. "She's obviously crazy so you better say nothing," he whispered cautiously to his friend.</p><p>"Not crazy, just a passionate researcher," Pandora added, making Sirius stiffen, for his secret opinion had been uncovered. Without raising her head from her notebook, she tapped on her ears, "Supersensory Charm. I can sense everything you can't . . . or think I can't."</p><p>Pandora raised her head and looked at Sirius with those petrifying blue eyes of her, the ends of her lips curling slightly upwards. The boy was not embarrassed at all; he simply snorted arrogantly and crossed his arms.</p><p>James adjusted his glasses, "I'm . . . James Potter. Nice to meet you."</p><p>"And I'm Peter. Uh, Peter Pettigrew."</p><p>The girl simply nodded and turned her attention back on her notes. James, famed for not being able to keep his mouth closed, leaned closer towards her.</p><p>"What are you writing down there?"</p><p>"Observations from spells, herbs usage, new charms." She turned a page. "Nothing your little brain can understand."</p><p>"Hey!" James cried out, the tips of his ears reddening from being insulted. "You're sitting in our cabin without our permission and you're calling me stupid? At least show some respect, you damn Ravenclaw."</p><p>"Told you she's crazy," Sirius muttered.</p><p>Pandora slammed her notebook shut, "You know what's crazy? Your family holding a grudge against half-bloods and your brother becoming a-"</p><p>"Enough," Sirius growled, slamming his hand against the window. His grey steel eyes stared at the girl whose blunt expression hadn't changed ever since she had focused in the contents of her notebook. "Get the hell out."</p><p>Her blue eyes remained on his figure for a moment before she stood up and left from their cabin as suddenly she had entered it. 'Well, that sure escalated quickly,' Peter thought whistled in surprise, pushing himself even more back in his seat to watch the mysterious girl leaving. The black-haired boy exhaled in relief and looked at his friends who were filled with unanswered questions but were just as glad that the girl had left.</p><p>Not even a minute of sitting in the electrified cabin had passed and the door of their cabin was opened once more, only to reveal the much-awaited member of the group.</p><p>Sirius, as if having forgotten about his outburst a moment ago, whistled, "And the prince arrives! How has your Majesty been doing?"</p><p>James ogled at the male, furrowing his eyebrows, "Where have you been?"</p><p>Remus Lupin took his seat besides Peter with a disturbed expression decorating his fair-colored face, "Was that Pandora Lovegood leaving our cabin a moment ago?" The brown-haired boy slid his suitcase under his seat and fixed a wild strand of hair which had fallen in his face.</p><p>"Will you just tell us where in Merlin's name you've been?" the Potter cursed, impatience being clearly shown on his face.</p><p>"I'm . . . " Remus trailed off, playing nervously with his fingers while staring down at them. The previously tense atmosphere had morphed into an awkward one with a speechless Lupin making everyone wait for a shocking revelation. "Eh . . . "</p><p>Sirius clicked his tongue, "Cat got your tongue, <em>Moony</em>?"</p><p>"Well it's not easy to tell you that I've been chosen to be a prefect, Padfoot!"</p><p>"Prefect?!" James and Peter nearly screamed in his face, causing the boy to blush slightly from uneasiness.</p><p>"Yes, I . . . Yeah." Remus' lips curled upwards, forming a prideful smile that he never knew he would wear for himself up to now. Being a prefect meant pride, acknowledgment, respect, power. He was chosen to be responsible for his fellow classmates and the well-being of the student body, a duty only an accountable person like him could carry out. Being a prefect surely electrified his brain.</p><p>Sirius raised his hands up in defeat, "Alright, I give up - too much has happened today, I need a break already."</p><p>"But was that seriously Pandora Lovegood?"</p><p>"Most unfortunately, yes. Calling <em>me</em> stupid . . . "</p><p>"She's crazy."</p><p>"<em>Bat-shit</em> crazy."</p><p align="center">☽ ‒ ‒ ‒ ‒ ‒ ☾</p><p>The buzzing of the students the moment they were all concentrated in front of Hogwarts was greater than the one engulfing Platform Nine and Three-Quarters. The first-years were the most anxious-looking, even though they were extraordinarily excited to enter the huge castle. The rest of the student body was more than less excited to spend another year in school, already looking forward to graduating. The minute the huge doors were opened, members of the Prefects lead their assigned groups to their dormitories where they started settling down and organizing their personal items.</p><p>James Potter was the quickest one to unpack his suitcase, yet his mind was travelling far away from the magic castle suited nearby a lake in Scotland. The moment he had noticed the girl who had a special place in his heart walking across him with her friends, chatting freely with that adorable smile on her face, he could swear he had felt his heart beat as hard and fast as the Hogwarts train's machine.</p><p>He could never get off his mind her green eyes which resembled the vast pine tree forests of the mountains surrounding the castle and her fiery red hair, as if colored by the feathers of Dumbledore's Phoenix bird he had discovered the previous year when he had sneaked in his office secretly - an action which got him heavily punished. Every time she laughed, he shivered from its clear hearing. Never in his life had he, James Potter, admired such being in that way.</p><p>'I'm truly, totally, unimaginably in love with Lily Evans,' the boy thought to himself, hugging one of his robes as if he was holding her.</p><p>Remus, who happened to have occupied the bed besides him, ogled at the Potter with curiosity, "What are you exactly doing?"</p><p>It took James a moment to snap out of his daydream, immediately throwing his robe back in his suitcase, "Uh, nothing?"</p><p>"You were hugging a robe, James," he inquired, concerned as to why his friend was acting so mental. But then it hit him.</p><p>"Lily Evans!" sang the voice of Sirius who hang from the bed above Remus' like a monkey, his nice-sculpted face having taken a smug expression.</p><p>The four-eyed boy's cheeks were tinted with a small blush and he flailed his arms above his head, "How can I not? She's the - "</p><p>"Most beautiful girl I've seen and I can't wait to shove my tongue into her mouth!" Sirius sang again in a pretentious girly voice, earning a hard shove in his face from James.</p><p>Suddenly, Peter barged in the dorm, earning the attention of all the students in it. With his exhaustion being clearly shown on his face, he neared his group of friends.</p><p>"Prefect meeting . . . Want you . . . go," he mumbled under his breath, tugging Remus' sleeve.</p><p>An unexpected wave of nervousness and excitement washed over the young boy, making him straighten his back. "I . . . guess I have to go," he murmured, earning assured nods from his friends.</p><p>"Go get them - Oh, crap, I really have to lay down," Sirius complained, rubbing his head from standing upside-down for too long.</p><p>Taking skeptical steps, Remus made his way out of the dorms and left his group of friends on their own.</p><p>Peter nearly collapsed on Remus' bed, trying to catch his breath.</p><p>"Where did you come from - London? You sound like you ran a marathon," James commented, sitting on his bed.</p><p>Peter raised his head from the bed and took a final shaky breath in, "You have no idea how scary those prefects can be. And those crazy magical stairs - I always hated them! I had to jump on some of them to get here on time!" The ginger-head sat up abruptly, making James hit his head on the bed above him from surprise. "I nearly forgot!"</p><p>"What?!"</p><p>"On my way here, I tripped on a staircase and well, I felt something weighting down my pocket. When I checked it, I found a note in it," he stated, searching in his robe pockets and taking out a folded piece of paper. "It's directed to you, Sirius."</p><p>Sirius jumped off his bed and shoved himself besides Peter, taking the note from his hands. Unfolding it, a messy handwriting decorated it with red ink.</p><p align="center">
  <em>It seems that where is evil, there is always a ray of pureness and peace. Come and meet me by the Herbology lab tomorrow, at 11 a.m. Don't be late.</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>- Anesi Doro</em>
</p><p>"Anesi . . . Doro?" the male spelled with difficulty, a smile finding its way up his lips. Laughing erupted from his mouth and with one swift movement, he crumpled the note and threw it on the floor. "Someone is messing with us."</p><p>James picked up the note and took a quick glance of its contents, "A secret fan? Could be. We have a lot of these nowadays. We could always go and meet them, see what they want us for."</p><p>"But what if it's a trap?" Peter inquired, clasping his hands together.</p><p>Both boys glanced at him with curiosity plastered on their faces. "A trap?"</p><p>"Think about it . . . We've pranked a lot of people these past years, <em>including</em> teachers," he explained, looking at James when he mentioned the teacher part. "Someone might want to get revenge."</p><p>Sirius tapped his finger on the bed stand, "And in front of half of the student body, we'd be bloody humiliated for life."</p><p>"Nonetheless, we should do some research, maybe we can find something about this . . . Anesi whatever," said James and shoved the note in his pocket. "No rush decisions."</p><p>The black-haired male sighed and punched his friend's shoulder softly, "Whatever, it's probably nothing and it <em>should</em> mean nothing to us. You know what should? Alisa Northway's ass and our new prank on Slitherus. Or, for you, Lily Evans' <em>ass</em>."</p><p>One more slap on the head earned by James.</p><p align="center">☽  ‒  ‒  ‒  ‒  ‒  ☾ </p><p>Like every welcoming meal, this year's first meal did not fail anyone's expectations. Or at least, the Marauders' expectations. Grilled meat marinated with a dark, juicy sauce, fruits gathered in elegant plates, flavored bread smells filling the air and many more plates that seemed endless to everyone in the room.</p><p>James had started eating the moment they sat at the table, not being able to contain his hunger for a second longer. It was the first time the meal was served before Dumbledore's welcoming taking place but the students didn't mind at all, seeing they were keeping their stomachs empty for this rich dinner. Peter had followed after James, the two of them resembling two trolls digging into food they hadn't seen for days.</p><p>Remus' calm expression turned into one full of disgust, "Maybe that's why Lily doesn't bother with you - and why you are only approachable to trolls."</p><p>Both boys glanced at Remus before resuming to devouring whatever came their way. The brown-haired boy sighed in defeat and put in his plate a little of everything, even though he felt the need to eat whatever came in sight. He was truly exhausted from the Prefects' meeting, yet he was full of amusement to the point he'd smile at random times.</p><p>"So . . . " James started, gulping down his last chunk of olive-flavored bread. "How was the meeting, Mr. Prefect?"</p><p>"It was just as I expected it. Outstanding, snobbish members, a variety of duties; yet I feel like this is the best thing that has ever happened to me." Remus breathed in happily and took a spoonful of soup in his mouth. "I even made new acquaintances."</p><p>Sirius snorted, "Who, Fabian Prewett, whose nose is bigger than his future?"</p><p>Remus elbowed his friend and he stuck his tongue out to him for payback. "No? The ones I met and actually liked to talk to were Edgar Bones and Pandora Lovegood - "</p><p>"What in Merlin's scrawny teeth did you do?!" nearly cried out James, furrowing his eyebrows upon hearing the name of the annoying girl from the train. "You know she insulted us, right?"</p><p>Remus sighed, feeling the glares of his friends burning his whole presence, "Yes, but . . . She actually seemed nice, less crazy than you described her to me and . . . Oh, just don't interfere with my job."</p><p>Peter clicked his tongue with a desperate look on his face, "You befriended the enemy!"</p><p>Remus groaned and simply continued eating his food, ignoring the glares of his companions. Soon enough, the boys seized down and focused back on their food or . . . the girls.</p><p>A girl with a heart-shaped face and wavy brown hair waved at Sirius from the other side of the table, a meter down from where he was sitting and he waved back, leaning forward on the table to have a better view of her. James, quick to notice the small invisible talk, looked at his friend with widened eyes, his glasses making their size look even more ridiculous.</p><p>"No shit. Alisa Northway?"</p><p>Sirius nodded to her and settled back down, keeping his eyes on her still, "Oh yes, my friend. Seems like I've got some business to settle after the meal."</p><p>Remus clicked his tongue in annoyance and let his fork down on his plate, "Seriously? Not even a day here and you'll already go and push a girl against a wall? Glad I won't be the bloody corridor inspector this night."</p><p>Sirius turned his eyes towards his friend, raising an eyebrow in curiosity, "Did a bee sting your penis today, Moony? Because you've been more moody than the Slytherin girls on their period."</p><p>"Whatever," he mumbled, propping his chin on his palm. "Do whatever your penis tells you to do."</p><p>"Why thank you!"</p><p>James could quite feel the tension between his two friends electrifying the atmosphere, some students who sat close to them looking discreetly towards their side. Truth was that no one dared to talk to them, except if they had the courage to do so or knew them as many years as they knew each other. The fact that they were nearly untouchable boosted even shy Peter's confidence, making him nearly<em> thrilled</em> to have that much power. As much power a student in Hogwarts could possess, at least.</p><p>James turned his head to sneak a glance from the Slytherin table; just as he had thought, the usual "gang" was staring at them. Avery, one of the most infamous students because of his sadistic behavior, was staring intensively at them with an ominous smirk plastered on his face. Besides him, his friend Severus Snape, the Marauders' toy whenever they felt like it, was glancing at them with his passive face which hid hatred for them. And of course, Sirius' <em>much adored</em> family, Belatrix and Regulus Black; Evan Rosier, the supposed-to-be Black who reached the Black's insanity level; and Wilkes, a nasty spawn who tried to imitate his peers.</p><p>The boy simply turned his attention back on his plate, suddenly not in the mood of eating anything else. Peeking at Sirius, he noticed that the boy had obviously noticed the intense and intimidating stares of the unpleasant company. His expression was blunt but James was smart enough to see through him, worry and anger mixed together. He wasn't a fool; he knew that his friend was far more concerned about matters that he had not dared to bring up and the weight of these matters was making him act out of his mind and on impulse.</p><p>And on that moment, James Potter swore to himself - he would not let any harm to be done to his friends.</p>
