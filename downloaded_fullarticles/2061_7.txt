    <p>It was too much. There were too many people. Harry had thought that Diagon Alley and Platform 9Â¾ were crowded, but the sheer amount of people at Hogwarts threw him. He felt surrounded, crushed, unable to breath. That was, until a woman introduced herself. The other students fell quiet, and Harry was able to gather his thoughts. As the woman explained what the students had to do, Harry let his gaze wander over the others, their faces and forms blurry, because his glasses weren't quite right.<br/>
The sudden opening of the grand doors in front of the group startled Harry, who instantly stood to attention. As the other students started to file into the Great Hall, Harry followed near the back. The room was breathtaking, with ceilings that looked like the night sky, tables of students wearing different colours, and a table with the most weirdly dressed adults the child had ever seen. A man, tall, thin and with a long beard, stepped forward, his eyes twinkling behind his glasses. Harry felt an instant distrust for the man, but listened to what he had to say. The child let his emerald eyes drift over the teachers, until he caught sight of a particular one. The man had long, greasy, black hair and dark eyes, and although he was scowling, something told Harry to trust the man. The pair made eye contact, and the man's scowl deepened as he glared at the boy, making him flinch instinctively. Harry forced his attention back to the female teacher from before -Professor McGonagall, he recalled- as she started to call their names. One by one, the students had the old hat placed on their heads before going to their assigned houses. For some, the sorting took mere seconds, but for others, minutes. A sense of dread filled Harry.<br/>
How does the hat know where to put them? He thought, What if he looks into my mind? He'll decided that I'm not worthy! He'll send me back to the Dursleys!<br/>
Before the child could work himself up too much, his name was called. As the young half-Pakistani boy stepped forward, walking gingerly onto the stage the hat was on, whispers began. Professor McGonagall let the students speak for a moment, as Harry settled himself, before calling for silence.<br/>
"Enough! Quieten down!" she called, sending an icy glare at the students. Harry felt himself shrink under the weight of the combined gazes of everyone in the room as McGonagall placed the hat gently on his head.<br/>
"Ah yes." the hat said, "So much potential. You have witnessed great tragedy child, but with the right guidance, you could become an even greater wizard. What is your view?"<br/>
"Please just let me stay, please just let me stay..." Harry repeated his mantra, squeezing his eyes shut tightly. He couldn't go back to the Dursleys. He still hadn't recovered from Vernon's last beating, and the thought of facing his relatives, the belt, the biting remarks about how he was a freak, all made Harry tremble slightly.<br/>
"Ah. I see. Hmm... Yes. Better be... Slytherin!" the hat yelled, and Harry felt his legs shake as he stood, after McGonagall removed the hat. He could stay. He could stay.</p><p>Time skip brought to you by Dumbledore's weak chin.</p><p>Harry hadn't paid much attention during the rest of the ceremony. He was just glad he could stay. A few others joined the table, including the ginger boy and the brunette girl Harry had sat with on the train. Unfortunately, despite the festivities, Harry could not help but feel uncomfortable. The wounds from Vernon's last beating had opened slightly, and while Harry was used to the feel of blood, he still disliked it. Besides, he was worried that someone might notice where his robes were darker, where the blood soaked through. He knew that, if someone found out, Vernon would make his life so much worse when he returned. He couldn't risk it. Harry was pushing a piece of chicken about his plate, when a voice pulled him from his musings.<br/>
"Everything okay Harry?" Ron asked, his mouth full of something unidentifiable. Harry, Hermione, and the blonde boy on Harry's right all shuddered at the disgusting sight.<br/>
"O... Of course R... Ron. I... I'm just not hungry." Harry smiled reassuringly, and it seemed to be enough for the ginger.<br/>
"Are you sure Harry? You've barely touched your food." Hermione frowned, and the blonde on Harry's right nodded in agreement.<br/>
"I... I'm fine. J... Just tired." Harry forced a yawn to seem more believable, and Hermione brought it. The blonde boy -Draco Malfoy, he'd called himself- did not.<br/>
"You should eat more if you're so tired. Not eating enough could lead to serious health problems." Draco emphasised, putting some extra mashed potatoes on Harry's plate. The shorter boy argued, but before anything else could happen, the old man from before -Dumbledore- cleared his throat, meaning the plates cleared themselves.<br/>
"Alright students, time for bed. Your Heads of House and prefects shall lead you to your common rooms. Sleep well, and be ready for classes to begin!" the elder called, his eyes firmly on Harry. The boy shivered. The look reminded him of a conniving fox, watching and waiting to get his prey. Harry shook his thoughts away, standing as his fellow house mates did. A boy and a girl, a good few years older than Harry, stepped forward, introducing themselves as the Slytherin prefects. They led the students over to the man they said was their Head of House. The dark haired, dark eyed man that Harry felt he could trust. He introduced himself as Professor Snape.</p>
