    <p>It was a night like any other, calm from storms, not even a drop of rain bothered the city of London. just quiet darkness covered the houses in the peaceful suburbs, only combated by the lampposts scattered around the roads. </p>
<p>The couple laid soundly in their bed under white sheets, which was one of the only furniture occupying space upstairs. Everything seemed perfect for just a moment they could catch up to their dreams to forget about their problems.</p>
<p>The cries of a naughty, little child pierced through the walls. The screaming from the other room interrupted their dreams, making both parents groan in sync. "Your turn," they both mumbled simultaneously and proceeded to try to snooze back, while hoping their first born would cut the crying. </p>
<p>The little boy didn't stop though, so Harry reached for his glasses on the bedside table with an exhausted sigh. It'd been almost a year, but James found the worst moments to wake them up. When he reached the door to their bedroom, Harry could hear a weak cheer from his wife. </p>
<p>He tiptoed into the his son's bare room, a habit he developed around the baby whether he was awake or fast asleep. He let the light from the corridor beam in, not to hurt the baby's eyes with the sudden light.</p>
<p>He looked inside the crib where the noisy child laid, his face red from the exertion that came with the crying. At that moment, Harry didn't mind the crying anymore, because it was his adorable son with his tuft of dark hair and chubby cheeks. </p>
<p>He found himself smiling, feeling his puffy, dark circles crinkle as he leaned down for the little boy. "Hey, little man. What's the matter tonight?" he asked as he lifted him up to place on his shoulder. He slowly circled his hand on the boy's back while keeping him in place with the other one.</p>
<p>"Are you hungry?" Harry asked, his voice as soothing as he managed at the middle of the night. James never actually answered, just kept on crying his heart out. </p>
<p>He only stopped his tantrum when mommy Ginny cradled him in her arms and most of the times he cried for that simply; attention from his mother. Harry had to accept defeat at some point after Ginny smirked at him smugly that he wasn't the favourite, but he did get her back when it came to bedtime stories and James calmed down by his stories.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Hey, mate." Ron opened the door to Harry's office one day looking like he slept in the dog house, which was curious, because they didn't have one of those.</p>
<p>"Hey, Ron," he greeted his old pal with a kind smile and after weighing his options he decided to comment his mood. "You look like garbage." The answer was a deep sigh, while he made his way to the armchair facing Harry's desk. He plopped down and looked contemplative for a moment, leaning on his legs afterwards.</p>
<p>"It's Hermione, she's bossy as ever," he explained, not as a complaint, but just as a exhausted acceptance. "You don't know how hard it is to pretend to be a muggle." Harry nodded to himself, smiling at the memories when they first moved to London with Ginny. "I've been cooking like a muggle, cleaning like a muggle, shopping like a muggle, using transport like a muggle... Because 'Magic is not the answer to everything, Ronald." Ron started complaining for real and imitating his wife's voice, which only made Harry laugh.</p>
<p>"It's not funny, Harry! I don't want her to be pregnant ever again!" he whined, while holding his head in his hands.</p>
<p>"Maybe she needs some time from work, I'll talk to Ginny maybe she can talk with her."  Harry walked around the desk to pat his friend's shoulder. "I'm sure they'll have something common to talk about," Harry smiled when Ron looked up at him, assuring him that everything was going to be alright. </p>
<p>"Well, mom sent me an owl yesterday," he breathed in heavily. "She thought it a good idea to have a family reunion at the Burrow. But you know mom... she is scary," Ron stopped and stood up to face Harry. "And I'm not ready for two scary women right now."</p>
<p>Harry tried to keep his face from cracking up, making quite the effort to not laugh at his friend's troubled mind. He also paid attention to keep his voice from wavering when he spoke up. "It's going to be great to get together, it's been a while," he reassured him. "And Hermione can talk to Fleur and Ginny, while we have some tea or something."</p>
<p>"Yeah, yeah... I know." Ron scratched his head, while convincing himself about the situation.</p>
<p>"And I'm guessing Hermione had the same answer about the letter." Harry leaned against his desk, checking his watch, he had to go on patrol today, but also had to help his friend out.</p>
<p>"Well, I kinda... sorta hid it from her," Ron admitted awkwardly and Harry couldn't hold his amusement back.</p>
<p>About one month later Harry arrived at the Burrow with Ginny and their two year old son, James. After Harry knocked, Mrs. Weasley opened it within a minute with a big, warm smile on her face. She wasted no time and launched herself at the young parents, embracing them in a big hug. She let go after what seemed like eternity and kissed their cheeks.</p>
<p>"Come on in, come, come," she waved at them while walking inside. The familiar, homey Burrow made Harry's stomach fill up with warmth. </p>
<p>Angelina was sitting in the living room with a small baby girl in her embrace. She stood up to greet them, Ginny and her really bonded in the last few years. She hugged both of them, greeting James in Harry's arms as well.</p>
<p>"Hey, there. Come, sit down." she told Ginny and helped her to the couch.</p>
<p>"Fed?" James asked Angelina, making grabby hands towards her. Harry took his hand and caught his attention.</p>
<p>"Don't you want to meet your new born cousin first?" Harry asked the little boy who looked confused and offended with his face scrunched up.</p>
<p>"Fed is cousin." The two year old made his argument after a moment of thinking and the adults snickered at his serious face.</p>
<p>"Harry!" Ron showed up at the end of the stairs with George trailing behind him. </p>
<p>"I'll take him to Fred, you go take a look at baby girl Rose," George offered and Harry handed James to him. George started talking with James as he made his way up the stairs, Harry heard as James blabbered on back to him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The family gatherings at the Burrow became a traditional thing, getting easier to get together each year as the kids grew. Almost every two month they met, at least so the children can spend their childhood together, even if their parents couldn't make it every time.</p>
<p>After eight years the Burrow was fuller than it seemed possible, a lot more running around with a lot more screaming and objects being knocked down miraculously. Parents being more tired each year, expect of course Mrs. Weasley, who was in her element, beaming at every family event. </p>
<p>"James, leave your brother alone!" Ginny shouted upstairs as Albus ran down for the second time this evening with an annoyed expression.</p>
<p>"I didn't do anything, I swear! He's just being such a baby!" James talked back in his usual way.</p>
<p>"James!" Ginny scolded him and thought about going upstairs.</p>
<p>"Am not..." Albus told Ginny with a deep frown. She sighed heavily, she knew too well that brothers have questionable relationships, she learned the hard way, witnessing it her whole childhood. Still she wished they could get along better, she didn't know if it was James already having Fred as his best friend or that Albus was less assertive. </p>
<p>"Dad!" Lily yelled, getting up from the toys spread on the carpet and running to her father. "Daaad!" She pulled on Harry's shirt sleeve.</p>
<p>"Yes, Lily what do you need?" Harry asked after sending an apologetic glance Percy's and Charlie's way whom he'd been having a conversation with.</p>
<p>"I'm hungry!" she whined, shaking her shoulders and pouting.</p>
<p>"Well, dinner is almost ready--" said Harry, but he was cut off almost immediately.</p>
<p>"But I'm hungry NOW!" Lily started shaking Harry's arm and made the best puppy eyes she could muster up.</p>
<p>"You just have to wait a little bit longer. 'kay?" Harry smiled at his only daughter who looked quite distraught of his statement. He didn't want her to start crying he really didn't, he turned back to Charlie and Percy a bit defeated.</p>
<p>"Hey, Lilz, why don't we check up on Granny in the kitchen." Harry thanked Merlin for Teddy coming up and leading the chatter-box of a little girl away.</p>
<p>"So, are you excited for your fourth year in Hogwarts?" Hermione asked Victorie while they were helping Mrs. Weasley in the kitchen. Hermione quickly took a liking to the girl, she was a really intelligent Ravenclaw and they could talk about any type of book at these family gatherings.</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, I--" her words got caught in her throat when the plate fell from her hands and scattered all over the floor. Hermione and Fleur looked up from what they were doing and searched for the source of Victorie's sudden distress. Teddy was standing in the door, wide eyed, with Lily clutching his hand. Victorie quickly crouched down to pick up the pieces of the broken plate.</p>
<p>"What happened?" Lily asked, while Teddy held her back from the ceramic shards.</p>
<p>"Oh, I-I'm... I'm just clumsy." Victorie stuttered, looking for Lily's eyes to smile at her reassuringly. </p>
<p>"That looks dangerous, you shouldn't pick them up with--" Teddy tried to interfere, but it was already too late Victorie had already cut her finger. Blood started to flow out slowly as she yelped and drew her hand up to her mouth.</p>
<p>"I'll clean that up." Fleur's thick accent broke the silence and hurried to her daughter. "Go look after the girls." she helped Victorie up and her daughter walked out of the kitchen with her head down and her finger held high, while she cleaned up with a flick of her wand.</p>
<p>"So, I guess dinner isn't ready yet?" Teddy asked awkwardly, then looking down at Lily, like he tried everything he could do in the matter of food, when they heard a big explosion coming from the living room.</p>
<p>"JAMES SIRIUS!" Harry shouted through the hole in the ceiling. Fred and James looked at each other knowing they messed up, then the two sheepishly smiling boys looked down at their parents. Nervously James grinned and tried his best puppy eyes on his father.</p>
<p>"I leave you two alone for one minute!" Teddy yelled with a deep sigh.</p>
<p>The rest of the evening everybody toned down, no other child wanting to get into trouble. The dinner table was quieter since the eldest Potter sibling wasn't in the mood to chat up a storm and be in the spotlight after getting scolded by his father.</p>
<p>"So, you'll be starting Hogwarts this September, am I right, James?" Ron asked trying to start a conversation with the boy across him, his guilty mood was getting to Ron. James looked up from the mashed potatoes, he was pushing around on his plate, he slowly nodded, avoiding eye contact at all costs with his dad who was sitting next to Ron.</p>
