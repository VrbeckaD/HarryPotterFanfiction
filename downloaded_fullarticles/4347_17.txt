          <div class="userstuff"><p>[Ron:]<br/>
Oh Harry, why couldn't you have stayed calm, for once instead of flying off the handle?</p>
<p>I hope you're happy<br/>
I hope you're happy now<br/>
I hope you're happy how you've hurt your cause forever<br/>
I hope you think you're clever</p>
<p>[Harry:]<br/>
I hope you're happy<br/>
I hope you're happy too<br/>
I hope you're proud how you would<br/>
Grovel in submission<br/>
To feed your own ambition</p>
<p>[Ron and Harry:]<br/>
So though I can't imagine how<br/>
I hope you're happy right now</p>
<p>[Ron:]<br/>
Harry, listen to me. Just say you're sorry!</p>
<p>You can still be with my sister<br/>
What you've worked and waited for<br/>
You can have all you ever wanted</p>
<p>[Harry:]<br/>
I know<br/>
But I don't want itâ€”No!<br/>
I can't want it anymore</p>
<p>Something has changed within me<br/>
Something is not the same<br/>
I'm through with playing by the rules of someone else's game<br/>
Too late for second-guessing<br/>
Too late to go back to sleep<br/>
It's time to trust my instincts<br/>
Close my eyes and leap</p>
<p>It's time to try defying Dumbledore<br/>
I think I'll try defying Dumbledore<br/>
And you can't pull me down</p>
<p>[Ron:]<br/>
Can't I make you understand<br/>
You're having delusions of grandeur?</p>
<p>[Harry:]<br/>
I'm through accepting limits<br/>
'Cause someone says they're so<br/>
Some things I cannot change<br/>
But 'til I try I'll never know</p>
<p>Too long I've been afraid of<br/>
Losing love, I guess I've lost<br/>
Well if that's love<br/>
It comes at much too high a cost</p>
<p>I'd sooner buy defying Dumbledore<br/>
Kiss me goodbye, I'm defying Dumbledore<br/>
And you can't pull me down!</p>
<p>Ron, come with me. Think of what we could do together!</p>
<p>Unlimited<br/>
Together we're unlimited<br/>
Together we'll be the greatest team<br/>
There's ever been, Ron!<br/>
Dreams the way we planned 'em</p>
<p>[Ron:]<br/>
If we work in tandem</p>
<p>[Ron and Harry:]<br/>
There's no fight we cannot win<br/>
Just you and I defying Dumbledore<br/>
With you and I defying Dumbledore</p>
<p>[Harry:]<br/>
They'll never bring us down!</p>
<p>Well, are you coming?</p>
<p>[Ron decides to stay behind]</p>
<p>[Ron:]<br/>
I hope you're happy now that you're choosing this</p>
<p>[Harry:]<br/>
You too<br/>
I hope it brings you bliss</p>
<p>[Ron and Harry:]<br/>
I really hope you get it<br/>
And you don't live to regret it<br/>
I hope you're happy in the end<br/>
I hope you're happy my friend</p>
<p>[Harry:]<br/>
So if you care to find me<br/>
Look to the Western sky!<br/>
As someone told me lately<br/>
Everyone deserves the chance to fly</p>
<p>And if I'm flying solo<br/>
At least I'm flying free<br/>
To those who ground me<br/>
Take a message back from me!</p>
<p>Tell them how I am defying Dumbledore<br/>
I'm flying high defying Dumbledore<br/>
And soon I'll match them in renown<br/>
And nobody in all the world<br/>
No wizard that there is or was<br/>
Is ever gonna bring me down!</p>
<p>[Ron:]<br/>
I hope you're happy</p>
<p>[Citizens OF Oz:]<br/>
Look at him<br/>
He's wicked<br/>
Get him!</p>
<p>[Harry:]<br/>
Bring me down!</p>
<p>[Citizens of Oz:]<br/>
No one mourns the wicked<br/>
So we got to bring him down!</p></div>
