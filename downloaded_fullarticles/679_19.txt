    <p>Fleur sighed to herself as she pulled the plug from the sink, allowing the water to drain out. She knew that she could have washed the pots in a second with a simple wave of her wand, but doing it like this had always made her happy, it was her way of rebelling against her overbearing mother-in-law, who constantly criticised her for doing things a simpler, more muggle way.</p><p> </p><p>She looked over at the clock hanging on the wall, seeing that Bill still wouldn't be home for another couple hours. This brought her a commonly felt feeling of sadness, knowing that within a couple hours she would be set upon by a man she didn't truly care for.</p><p> </p><p>At first she had felt bad for Bill, believing that what she was doing to him was horrible, some would call it evil of her even. But ever since their wedding night, she could honestly say she didn't care, didn't give a damn about what she was doing to him without his even knowing it.</p><p> </p><p>Thinking of that night brought anger to her usually serene mind. Thinking of what that bastard had tried to do, mere hours after their friends, his own brother, had fled for their lives, may even be dead at that very moment. </p><p> </p><p>Fleur closed her eyes and took a steadying breath, feeling the soft white feathers beginning to form on her arms as she lost control. She wouldn't allow that monster to get to her like this. She scoffed at the fact that even though he wasn't here, he could still bring her such powerful feelings of rage at the mere thought of him.</p><p> </p><p>Oppening her eyes, she looked out the window situated above the sink, peering out at the waves beating against the shore. She smiled, looking out across the water, imaginig to herself that she could almost see the land beyond, her true home, where all those that she loved and cared about were.</p><p> </p><p>Well, perhaps not all those she cared about.</p><p> </p><p>Her attention was suddenly caught by something further down the beach. Pulling out her wand on instinct, she focussed her vision, trying to make out what it was. Her eyes widened in shock at what she saw.</p><p> </p><p>----------</p><p> </p><p>"Harry! Luna! Are you okay"?</p><p> </p><p>"I'm alright Hermione. But I'm not sure about Harry", Luna said as she stepped up next to Hermione, watching in sadness as Harry knelt in the sand.</p><p> </p><p>"'Arry! 'Ermione!"</p><p> </p><p>The two girls turned, looking off down the beach as they saw someone running toward them, wand in hand and face flushed.</p><p> </p><p>----------</p><p> </p><p>"What happened"? Fleur asked, sitting in an armchair across from Hermione and Luna, who were sat side by side on a small sofa, holding steaming mugs in their hands.</p><p> </p><p>"Bellatrix was growing frustrated that me and Ron weren't talking, telling them where Harry was. She made Draco torture Ron in front of me, trying to get me to talk", Hermione muttered, looking down at the steam rising from her tea. </p><p> </p><p>"You didn't", Fleur said, not putting it as a question. She knew what Hermione would do to keep Harry safe. She knew of Hermione sending her own parents away so she could continue fighting beside Harry.</p><p> </p><p>Luna lent against Hermione, placing a comforting hand on the other girls knee. Turning to Fleur, she carried on the story.</p><p> </p><p>"After torturing him for a few days, Bellatrix had enough. She ordered Draco to finish Ronald. That's when Dobby turned up. He helped us escape. But before we could apparate away, Bellatrix threw the dagger".</p><p> </p><p>The three witches looked over at the kitchen table, where the deformed piece of black metal lay.</p><p> </p><p>"Dobby", Fleur said, thinking back. "Harry told me about the little creature during the tournament, he deeply cared for the elf".</p><p> </p><p>"He cares for a lot of things", Hermione said, levelling a look at Fleur.</p><p> </p><p>----------</p><p> </p><p>Harry sat on the soft bed in Fleur and Bill's room, looking out the large bay window at the rolling waves. He thought about the land that lay beyond. He knew that it was wrong of him. Selfish even. But he couldn't help but think of taking the girls, possibly the three people he cared most for in the world, and lead them across the sea. Take them to Fleur's home there, so she could see her family after so long. Find somewhere comfortable and safe, and live there for the rest of their days.</p><p> </p><p>But then he thought to the other people he cared about. Those that he'd be leaving behind to the wrath of Voldemort. The Weasley's, Lupin, Tonks and her family, all the people that had followed him in the DA. All those people that Voldemort would slaughter after he ran.</p><p> </p><p>A knock at the door brought him from his reverie. Looking over, he watched as Fleur walked in, closing the door behind her.</p><p> </p><p>They stayed like that for several minutes, just watching each other. </p><p> </p><p>Fleur broke first. She practically ran the few step toward him, knocking him onto his back on the bed as she held tightly onto him. Crying into his chest.</p><p> </p><p>"I'm so glad you're safe 'Arry. I didn't know if you were dead. After the wedding, I sat for hours thinking you, 'Ermione and Ron were lost".</p><p> </p><p>Harry wrapped his arms around Fleur's back. Putting his nose to her hair, he breathed in her familiar scent.</p><p> </p><p>"You shouldn't be here Fleur. You should be in France, with Gabrielle and the rest of your family. You should have left as soon as the wedding was over. I know you love Bill, but staying here with him isn't worth it".</p><p> </p><p>Fleur sat up, turning her head away from Harry in shame.</p><p> </p><p>"Fleur, what's wrong"?</p><p> </p><p>"You are wrong 'Arry".</p><p> </p><p>"About what"?</p><p> </p><p>"I, I don't love William. I never did".</p><p> </p><p>Harry stared at the beautiful woman in shock. "But, if you didn't love him. Why did you marry him".</p><p> </p><p>"I DID IT FOR YOU. I STAYED IN THIS DAMNABLE COUNTRY. I MARRIED THAT HORRIBLE LITTLE COCKROACH. I DID IT ALL FOR YOU YOU SILLY LITTLE MAN!!!"</p><p> </p><p>Harry fell back on the bed, as Fleur stood up, walking over to the window.</p><p> </p><p>"I did it all for you 'Arry",she continued in a sombre voice. "After the tournament. You chose Hermione. I didn't want to come between the two of you. But I had to be here. To help you however I could. William approached me on behalf of the Order. Asked me to join, to help them. To help you".</p><p> </p><p>Turning around, she lent her back against the glass, looking at Harry as he sat up on the bed.</p><p> </p><p>"When William asked me out, I knew that it was the best way to get close to you. In the order I was kept away, on assignments. But if I courted William, then I'd be able to see you".</p><p> </p><p>Harry stood up and walked over to Fleur. Standing in front of her, he took her hands in his, bringing them up to his face to place kisses along the knuckles.</p><p> </p><p>"I didn't know. I chose Hermione because I thought you didn't care for me like that. I thought what we had was a one time thing. A sorted affair during the tournament. Don't get me wrong, I love Hermione like no other. But you. Fleur, you're perfect. You're like no other".</p><p> </p><p>"Oh 'Arry".</p><p> </p><p>Fleur took Harry by the face, bringing his head down to place a passion filled kiss onto his lips. </p><p> </p><p>After a few minutes of kissing, Harry placed his hands on Fleur's shoulders, pushing her back.</p><p> </p><p>"I'm sorry Fleur, but I can't. You're married".</p><p> </p><p>"I don't care. It's not him I love. You were my first 'Arry", she continued in a whisper, "my only".</p><p> </p><p>"Your only? But..."</p><p> </p><p>"I never let him. Our wedding night, he tried. I stunned and obliviated him. He has tried many times since and I've done the same every time".</p><p> </p><p>Placing her hands on his cheeks, Fleur pulled him back to her.</p><p> </p><p>"You are the only man I have ever allowed to see me. To touch me. And you will be the only man to ever do so. Till the end of my days, you will be the only man who I will belong to".</p><p> </p><p>Harry's face lit up in pure joy. Taking Fleur by the waist, he pushed her back against the window, sealing her lips with his own as he plundered her mouth.</p><p> </p><p>The two of them moaned in pure, unadulterated pleasure as Harry lifted Fleur by the waist, the witch wrapping her legs behind his back as he began grinding his centre against her own.</p><p> </p><p>Fleur suddenly whimpered in loss as Harry put her back on her feet, pulling away from her. She froze in shock though as Harry descended to his knees before her, bringing his hands to her waist.</p><p> </p><p>Popping the button of her jeans, and pulling down the zip, Harry took hold of the waist and pulled it down, along with her frilly knickers underneath, and allowed Fleur to step out of them. Looking up, he watched as Fleur took hold of the hem of her shirt, and pulled it up and over her head, tossing it away to some corner of the room. Reaching behind her back, she unclasped her equally frilly white bra, pulling the straps off of her shoulders, and dropping the bra onto Harry's head.</p><p> </p><p>Harry chuckled as he reached up, bringing the bra to his nose and taking a deep whiff, before casting it away in the same direction as Fleur's shirt.</p><p> </p><p>Taking her by the waist, Harry pulled the beauty towards him, letting her comfortably lean back against the glass. Bringing his head to equal height as her crotch, he lent forward. Sticking out his tongue, he let it run once all the way up the length of her slit, hearing her release a shuddering breath. Reaching the top, he lent forward, pressing a close lipped kiss where he knew her clit was hiding away.</p><p> </p><p>Lapping at it a few times, he felt as the small nub poked out of it's hood, as if trying to reach out for more pleasure.</p><p> </p><p>Sealing it with his mouth, he lathered it with his tongue, feeling Fleur slip her fingers through his hair, pulling his face into her.</p><p> </p><p>"Oh oui".</p><p> </p><p>"Oui bebe, oui".</p><p> </p><p>Harry smiled to himself, remembering when Fleur would spiral into long bouts of French when he'd brought her the most pleasure. He lost himself in thought for a moment as his mind went back to the night of the Yule Ball, when Fleur had lead him to a small, secluded strip of beach by the Black Lake, and he'd done this same thing for near an hour, French expletives echoing across the frozen water, before she'd pushed him onto his back, mounted him, and rode him till they were soaked with sweat.</p><p> </p><p>Coming back to the present, Harry brought one hand off of her hip, bringing it down and inserting a finger into her tight opening, getting a delightful moan in return. As he continued licking her, he  began pumping the finger in and out of her at a steady pace.</p><p> </p><p>"Un autre".</p><p> </p><p>Harry crumpled his forehead, trying to think what that meant.</p><p> </p><p>"Another 'Arry. Un autre".</p><p> </p><p>Harry smiled at Fleur's ability to read his mind. Pulling the finger out, he lined it up with a second, before slipping them both in.</p><p> </p><p>"Aaaahhhh, oui".</p><p> </p><p>Pumping in and out, Harry decided to get comfy, knowing Fleur would allow him to stay like this for as long as he wished. Which if he could, he'd do for eternity".</p><p> </p><p>----------</p><p> </p><p>"How do you feel"?</p><p> </p><p>"Like I just came half a dozen times in the past hour from having a god lick me".</p><p> </p><p>Harry laughed to himself. Leaning down, he placed a heated kiss to Fleur's lips, feeling her arms slip around his neck, pulling him down into the bed sheets.</p><p> </p><p>He felt as Fleur placed her hands on his chest, pushing him back slightly. Sitting up, she pushed him onto his back so his head was propped up on the pillows. Slipping down the bed, she came to rest at his legs, kneeling between his knees.</p><p> </p><p>Reaching out, she wrapped her small hands around his engorged member, giving it a few soft tugs. </p><p> </p><p>Leaning down, she placed a soft kiss onto the tip, letting her tongue slip out to swirl around the crown. Letting her mouth sink down, she lowered her head until all 7" of the cock was down her throat. Swallowing several times, she slowly raised her head back up till her plush lips popped of the top, letting out a loud smacking sound.</p><p> </p><p>Crawling back up Harry, she came to rest her slit against the underside of his dick, rubbing it up and down.</p><p> </p><p>"You ready"? She asked.</p><p> </p><p>"As I'll always be", Harry replied, taking a breast in one hand as the other went to her waist.</p><p> </p><p>Taking hold of the cock, Fleur lined it up with her entrance, before slowly lowering herself onto it. Letting herself slide all the way down, she moaned and tipped her head back to look at the ceiling as she came to rest at the base. Harry's swollen balls resting beneath her butt.</p><p> </p><p>Placing her hands on his chest, she used it as leverage to begin pulling herself up and down the towering shaft.</p><p> </p><p>She groaned as she felt his balls slapping against her butt every time she lowered herself. Them letting a wet splatting sound echo around the room.</p><p> </p><p>Fleur looked down, her eyes fixing with Harry's as he stared up at her, his gaze not falling from her face.</p><p> </p><p>Harry was frozen in awe as he watched the goddess bounce up and down on his cock. Her silvery gold hair framed her pale white face, her swollen red lips and bright blue eyes standing out as her most prominent features. He squeezed with the hand that was palming her breast, each one the size of her head and shaped like a ripe pear.</p><p> </p><p>Fleur felt herself begin to tear up as she watched Harry staring at her as if she were an angel. </p><p> </p><p>This is what she'd been waiting for for nearly two whole years. This moment. Sat atop the man she loved as she rode him, bringing each other pleasure they both needed and wanted. This is all she'd ever wanted. And it was finally hers.</p><p> </p><p>The pure emotion got the most of her.</p><p> </p><p>Tilting her head back, she let out a high shriek as she felt the bones of her face begin to sharpen and elongate. She looked to her arms and saw as small white feathers began sprouting, coating her arms in them.</p><p> </p><p>She felt her shoulders blades tighten and constrict as something began growing out of them.</p><p> </p><p>Opening her mouth, she let out a final caw as she fully transformed.</p><p> </p><p>Harry's eyes nearly popped out at the sight before him. Sat atop him, where moments ago sat Fleur, was now the most gorgeous being he'd ever seen. Her nose and mouth had elongated into a long white beak. Mixed in with her long hair were large pure white feathers. Her arms and legs were covered by a coating of small white feathers. Her finger nails had grown out into long curving talons. And finally, out of her back had sprouted a pair of huge white wings, spread out on either side of her as if they were reaching out to opposite walls, each one at least the same size as her in length.</p><p> </p><p>Harry let out a bellowing roar as he erupted inside of her.</p><p> </p><p>----------</p><p> </p><p>"How long has he been here"? Fleur asked as the four of them stood in the living room, looking at Bill as he lay unconscious in a chair. </p><p> </p><p>"Since just after you went in to see Harry", replied Hermione, smirking at the last part.</p><p> </p><p>"What are you going to do"? Asked Luna, looking toward Fleur.</p><p> </p><p>"What are <em>we </em>going to do", said Harry, stepping forward and taking Fleur's hand in his own.</p><p> </p><p>"Smooth", said Hermione, taking Harry's other hand in her own, and picking her wand up with the other.</p><p> </p><p>Pointing it at Bill, she cast enervate. Waiting for the inevitable storm that was to come.</p>
