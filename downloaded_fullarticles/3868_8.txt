          <div class="userstuff"><p>A doe bolts through a forest, its hide golden, gems of every color glinting from its fleece. Lust is the invisible chariot it draws, the besetting, burning lust with which Ravana desires Sita. This doe is really no doe at all, but all who see it will be fascinated at once, and follow it even to the ends of the earth. This is the doe for whom vows are broken, and civilizations are annihilated, and yugas end and begin. This is the unreciprocated lust that summons gods to earth to become men and the stuff of which legends are made.</p><p>Charanas later: a doe flits through a forest, its form silvery mist. Regret is the chariot it pulls, regret for Lily that anchors Snape, and redemption its hazy destination. He has no taste for the Sanskrit epics, save for the brief research he did into Naginiâ€™s name, but still he walks in the footsteps of Dashaanan. This doe may be no doe at all, but the one who sees it will be intrigued and follow, trusting immediately, stupidly, implicitly (bravely). This is the doe that defines sagas of seven volumes and the unreciprocated love that changes the course of wars.</p></div>
