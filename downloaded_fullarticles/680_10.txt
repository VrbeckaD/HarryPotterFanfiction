    <p>Hugo Delacour Stroked his pointy beard as he looked up at the villa. He was currently attending a short family retreat with his wife Apolline and his daughters, 9 year old Fleur, and 3 year old Gabrielle. Hugo frowned slightly as he thought about their trip had been spoilt. They'd originally come as a way to check out a villa that his wife and himself were considering buying and moving into. But instead, they'd spent the entire week in a sort of cold war with a family from England who had stayed in a villa further down the beach. A villa he was currently stood outside of.</p><p> </p><p>The family had left several hours ago, which had actually caused a mini party to be held in the Delacour villa. But not too long afterwards, when Fleur had been walking the family dog, while she was passing the newly departed villa, she'd heard a strange noise coming from inside. After peeking through the windows and not finding anything, she'd shrugged her shoulders and carried on with her stroll. But on her way back home, while passing the villa, she'd heard the same noise again.</p><p> </p><p>Upon arriving back home, she'd told her parents about what she'd heard. The two adults had past it off as likely being a wild animal that had gotten into the house. After several hours of enjoying their time together reading and watching TV, Apolline had turned to her husband and stated that what Fleur had told them had been niggling in the back of her mind all day. Wanting to please his beautiful wife that he loved more than anything, Hugo had told her he'd investigate, and try and find what Fleur had heard.</p><p> </p><p>So here he is, stood outside the slightly dishevelled villa with the family Labrador Louis at his side. Pulling his wand from it's sheath, he cast a simple <em>Alohamora </em>at the front door, causing it to unlock and swing open. Casting a <em>Lumos </em>he entered the house, the tip of his wand sweeping around. Hugo was suddenly startled as Louis let out a loud '<strong>woof</strong>' and went running further into the house. Following the dog into the kitchen, Hugo froze and gasped is horror at the sight that greeted him.</p><p> </p><p>Lying on the wooden floor, with Louis standing over him licking his face, was a small and frail boy, with messy black hair coated in what Hugo believed to be dried blood. Stepping toward and kneeling next to the boy, Hugo noted that there wasn't a stitch of clothing on him, and looking to his legs, they were a horrific black and purple in colour, as well as being bent and twisted in ways Hugo had never thought possible.</p><p> </p><p>Taking several deep and calming breaths, Hugo raised his wand and cast a <em>Patronus </em>charm, a silvery blue French bulldog appearing before him, before floating into the air and flashing away in the direction of the Delacour villa. Casting a diagnostic spell, Hugo sighed in relief as it showed the boy was still somehow alive. Turning away from the boy, he took a long deep breath, before falling to his hands and knees and expelling his guts in the corner of the room.</p><p> </p><p>-------------------------(five years later)-------------------------</p><p> </p><p>Sitting up and stretching his arms above his head, Harry let out a heavy yawn as he rubbed the sleep out of his eyes. Reaching over to his bedside table, he picked up his glasses that had been place there the night before, slipping them onto his face. Suddenly he was brought completely awake by a soft moan from the room next to his. He'd heard Fleur loads of times when she decided to enjoy herself, but even though it was quite pleasing to the ears, it was still frustrating, especially when the walls were so thin making it impossible to not hear everything that went on next door.</p><p> </p><p>Slumping with a frustrated huff, Harry turned in his bed to face the wall that his bed's headboard was up against, the other side being Fleur's room, and lifting his hand, he brought it down hard on the wall, his mouth opening to begin shouting at her to keep it down. However, as soon as his hand made contact with the wall, Harry shrieked as he was briefly enveloped by bright red flames, and then loud feminine shouting.</p><p> </p><p>Once the flames disappeared, Harry blinked in visible shock and confusion as he looked around at the room, finding that he'd somehow aparated into Fleur's room, and on her bed, with Fleur pressing her back as close to the wall behind her, and her arms covering her naked breasts and vagina.</p><p> </p><p>-------------------------</p><p> </p><p>"Fascinating!" exclaimed Hugo, as he prodded Harry's arm with a finger.</p><p> </p><p>"Hugo!" Admonished Apolline, swatting her husband's hand away from Harry.</p><p> </p><p>"I mean, we knew that there would be somethings you could do that the rest of us couldn't with the blood that runs through your veins. But actual 'Flame Travelling! I believed it impossible!".</p><p> </p><p>"Can someone tell me what's going on?" Asked Harry, looking between Hugo, Apolline, and Fleur, who had managed to put on some clothes.</p><p> </p><p>"Well Harry", said Apolline, sitting down on Fleur's bed next to him. "You remember how we told you that due to your Peverell blood, then you'd be able to do things that most couldn't?"</p><p> </p><p>Harry nodded in remembrance, "like being able to talk to magical birds, and being able to cast and control magical fire better than anybody else?"</p><p> </p><p>"That's right", said Apolline. "What it appears, is that you've unlocked a new ability, an ability that hasn't been seen in any other known witch or wizard that holds the blood of a Peverell. You can Flame Travel Harry".</p><p> </p><p>Harry's eyes bulged out at what he'd been told, while he heard Fleur gasp in shock next to him, grabbing his hand.</p><p> </p><p>"What? Like a Phoenix can?"</p><p> </p><p>"Exactly like a Phoenix Harry", said Hugo. "I mean, it makes sense that one of your blood would eventually unlock the ability, most other known abilities of the Phoenix have known to manifest in a Peverell".</p><p> </p><p>-------------------------</p><p> </p><p>"I'm sorry for disrupting you this morning", said Harry, as he sat next to Fleur on the sofa.</p><p> </p><p>Everyone else was out of the house, with Hugo and Apolline at work and Gabrielle over at a friend's house.</p><p> </p><p>"It's alright, though I thought I told you that I was fine with you listening".</p><p> </p><p>"It's not that, it's just when I do listen it gets me all riled up".</p><p> </p><p>"Oh poor Harry", Fleur said, sticking out her bottom lip and stroking his face with her hand. "Are you getting all hot and bothered for your big sister and then not being able to get off".</p><p> </p><p>Harry felt as his face heated up and he knew his face must have been bright red. He groaned as Fleur threw her leg over his own, straddling his hips.</p><p> </p><p>"Do you want me to help you?" She asked, leaning down and letting her lips hover just away from Harry's own.</p><p> </p><p>Before Harry could answer, the living room door swung open, and an annoyed looking Apolline walked in.</p><p> </p><p>"That's enough now, off your brother young lady", she said.</p><p> </p><p>Bending over, she picked up her mobile phone that she must have forgotten, before tossing Harry a letter.</p><p> </p><p>"That was on the doormat", she said.</p><p> </p><p>"It's from Hogwarts", said Harry excitedly as he tore it open.</p><p> </p><p>"Congrats Harry", Fleur said, her face lit up in a beatific smile, wrapping her arms around Harry in a hug.</p><p> </p><p>"We can take you to get your things next week", said Apolline, before hurrying out the door.</p><p> </p><p>"So", said Fleur, slipping back onto Harry's lap. "Where were we?" </p><p> </p><p> </p>
