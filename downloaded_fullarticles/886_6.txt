    <p>Ianto Jones couldn’t remember a time that he hurt as much as he did that moment. Not even surviving and crawling his way out of the ruins of Torchwood One to finding Lisa a half converted and dragging her through the fire and derbies, trying not to let the cries and screams for help or death get to him.</p><p>Ianto wished he could have helped everyone or at least granted them an honourable death; at least he would have cared about them unlike UNIT who chose to slaughter them like they weren’t human and didn’t matter.</p><p>Even losing Lisa, watching her gunned down by those he worked for didn’t hurt as much; it did destroy his soul but did not cause his body that much pain.</p><p>No being tenderized by aliens cannibals who damaged his body and fear that he had been abandoned by those he once called teammates and once longed to be friends with had left Ianto in worse pain than he could imagine.</p><p>Ianto Jones if you asked anyone who worked at Torchwood Three they could rave about Ianto's coffee and the great way he keeps everything organized but not one of them could tell you his birthday or where he lived.</p><p>As the only Torchwood One survivor to work at three, in fact he was the only survivor that chose to continue working with the organization or what's left of it Ianto already had a rather large mountain to climb, the members of three hadn’t bothered to hide their dislike of anything or anyone that came from One.</p><p>It hurt deeper than Ianto thought it would when he was left in the shadows while Gwen Cooper was warmly welcomed into the fold, Ianto longed to feel that kind of warmth. He was wasting away in the dark and none of the others bothered to notice. Unless they needed his coffee, something fetched or put away, something cleaned, food ordered or Jack felt the urge to flirt and couldn’t be bothered to search for Gwen.</p><p>Ianto never let it show how much that hurt because the truth was he had fallen for the charismatic captain and it tore at him that he was nothing but easy conquest to Jack when he couldn’t have who he wanted.</p><p>Ianto didn’t know why he stayed at Torchwood Three why it was clear that no one would notice if he didn’t show up until they wanted coffee. “They probably won’t even care; I don’t know why I stay.” He really didn’t know why he stayed; they would never accept him as a true member of the team. He had a place that he could call home and maybe it was time that he went back.</p><p>There was nothing keeping him there and he was tired of it. He wondered how long it would take for anyone to notice he was missing.</p><p>Try as he might Ianto couldn't contain the hiss that escaped his lips as fingers gently brushed over the scars they had been bothering him of late. The burns are a reminder of what dangers this work can bring into your life, one that Ianto knew all too well.</p><p>"Прошу́ проще́ния" Came the soft whispered apology, followed by an even lighter finger touch.</p><p>Reaching up Ianto covered the hand in his. "It's alright; it's not your fault. I'm the one who chose this assignment and chose to stay. I know the dangers working for an organization such as Torchwood could bring. It's not that different than working at SHIELD."</p><p>There was a low dangerous growl. "Yes but at least at SHIELD you had us who cared about you and you weren't treated like a lowly coffee boy for the others to walk all over and had to pick up after the other agents because unlike Torchwood Three, SHIELD agents are not grown children." Natasha Romanoff snapped she had no love for Torchwood not one or three, especially not three with its arrogant leader and team members.</p><p>"Tosh it's that bad. She's the only one to have apologised to me and brought me coffee after the whole Lisa mess." Ianto defended.</p><p>"Dude, did you have to bring up Three? Did you know that Tasha here has all their faces on target practice dummies? Man, I would hate to think of what should happen should any of your "teammates" run into Tasha here." Clint Barton commented from the comfortable chair he had claimed the moment he and Natasha entered Ianto's flat, his keen eyes not missing a thing and it took all his willpower not to go hunt down Ianto's team when he saw the bruises littering his body.</p><p>He did own Ianto a new spoon he had bent the one he had been using in half as more and more of the Welshman's battered body came into view. "They sent you home like that? Did anyone check you out? Don't you have a doctor on your team?" Clint demanded, he was ready to track them down and drag them back to Ianto's flat - willing or unwilling- to make them see the damage the Welshman had received.</p><p>"Owen had his hands full Gwen had been shot as well as many of the cannibals." It hurt Ianto to know that he was below the monster that had tried to eat him and Toshiko and that he didn't even register on his team to ask about his wellbeing. That Jack would look right past him as if he wasn't even there and give all his attention to Gwen, even taking her in so she could talk to one of those monsters because she needed to know why not caring that one of her own teammates had been bloody tenderized.</p><p>"You're not going back there. Not only because they are cowards who can't own up to their mistakes and admit that they treated you poorly or that they can't even bother to look after you after such a disaster of a mission but because Fury has ordered you back to headquarters. SHEILD is to no longer have any more dealings with Torchwood." Phil Coulson spoke up as he watched Natasha patch up the young agent that he been made guardian of all those years ago. The backlash would be great should Ianto's parents learn of how he has been treated.</p><p>In truth, Ianto was tired of this life, tired of being ignored until the Torchwood team needed something like a coffee, a file or something cleaned. He was much more than what Torchwood Three had made him into. "I don't want to be on active duty just yet. I still have nightmares of One's fall and of what Lisa was turned into. I need to be around those who truly care about me."</p><p>Natasha's heart broke at the pain in Ianto's eyes and she wondered how long it had been since someone had touched Ianto with kindness or even touch on the shoulder, one look at him and she knew he was touched starved and while she wasn't the most touchy person she knew what it was like to go with a simple touch. "We will be there right beside you supporting you every step of the way. So what do you say are you ready to come home?"</p><p>The Welshman only had to glance at the three people in his flat, those he considered family to see the truth in their eyes, he knew where he belonged and it wasn't with Torchwood Three. "Yes, I'm ready to go home."</p><p>Ianto knew he was going to miss Myfanwy and hoped that someone was going to take care of her. He would admit if only to himself that he would miss Tosh and even Jack a little but didn’t hold out hope that they would miss him for long, after all he was only the Tea-Boy, he was no one important to Torchwood Three.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>                                                                 </p><p>It would be three days later that one of the Torchwood team finally realised that none of them had heard from Ianto since that night with the aliens it had been Ianto's first mission with the team and tensions had been high, yet none of them stopped to think of the man who had been beaten by the aliens. After a frantic search into Ianto's file delivered his home address they gathered into the SUV with apologies on their lips to attempt to make things right with the youngest of them.</p><p>All they would find is an empty flat and a note:</p><p>
  <em>You're too late Ianto's back where he belongs, with his true family and you will never see him again. </em>
</p><p>Ianto wasn't around when his former team finally noticed he was missing; it wasn't until his brush with the cannibals did Ianto truly see how little he meant to the team. When those he truly called family came for him he didn't see a point in staying at a place that didn't care about him.</p><p>He wasn’t there to see Owen, curse up a storm blaming himself for not noticing Ianto was hurting and failing as a doctor.  </p><p>He wasn’t there to see Tosh, break down into tears wondering why she didn’t reach out to Ianto sooner, understanding what it’s like to be the outsider looking in.</p><p>He wasn’t there to see Gwen, unsure of herself knowing that she had treated like he was invisible and staying away from him after Lisa because she couldn’t understand what it was like to risk the world for love.</p><p>He wasn’t there to watch as Jack let out a growl of pure rage, knowing that he had failed Ianto in the worst ways that he had let his anger and rage at Torchwood One stop him from seeing how lost Ianto truly was.</p><p>Ianto wasn’t there as Torchwood Three broke as they realised just how deeply they failed Ianto and one thought on all their minds.</p><p> Will they ever be able to make things right with Ianto? </p>
