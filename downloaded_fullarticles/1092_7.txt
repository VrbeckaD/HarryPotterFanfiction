Harry had already seen Draco’s wedding robes but Draco looked even more beautiful than he had the day he’d tried the outfit on.<br/><br/>Harry pounced on him.<br/><br/>Draco pulled back. “We’ll be late.”<br/><br/>Harry hungrily eyed Draco from head to toe.<br/><br/>“Worth it,” he said and kissed him again.</p></div>
