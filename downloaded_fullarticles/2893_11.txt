    <p>After the Anuk-Ite business was dealt with properly, and everything settled in Beacon Hills, after Stiles went back to the FBI and Lydia skipped off to uni, Malia told Scott she was taking that plane to France. </p><p>She didn't tell him how long she planned to stay there. She didn't tell him her ticket was one-way. Peter, for lack of anything better to do, she supposed, than annoy, frustrate, and otherwise be a nuisance to his daughter, decided to tag along. After all, it was his money she was spending.</p><p>And her mother's. One isn't an assassin without some capital to your name, after all. It's a petty victory, buying things with her awful biological parents' money that cost way too much and are far too frivolous, but it is one all the same. A fit of nostalgia has her buying a jeep, because emotions don't fade as easily as she'd like. But regardless of that - she's in France, she has a jeep since she left her old car back in America, she has a flat, her father is nowhere to be found and she doesn't much care about that, and Malia can do... </p><p>Whatever she wants. </p><p>So yes. After the Anuk-Ite business, you could say she runs. You'd be an idiot if you did, but you <em>could </em>say it. Really, what Malia was doing, was finding herself. A change of scenery, a sense of freedom. No supernatural messes to be caught up in that are not of her own making, so long as the Argents and the other, less proficient hunters, stay in their lanes and respect her boundaries. </p><p>Malia looks around the flat she's rented out. It's a nice place, spacious, but not too big for one person, maybe two, if a couple lived here. It's up high, with a nice view, and it's got good furnishings. </p><p>Corrine's money, of course. It's a bit disheartening using blood money - because that's what it is - but... <em>Malia's </em>using it. Corrine would <em>hate </em>that, <em>viciously, </em>so Malia's mostly okay with using it. That <em>sounds </em>like an excuse, but really, it's a good reason. A valid one. Malia will take anything that means she can hold off on joining the mundane adult world a little longer.</p><p>She never really got to be a teenager, after all. She can't be one now, too mature, too old even at nearly nineteen. But she can be a young adult, loiter around the uni and do various uni things without actually bothering with higher education just yet. She can go to parties and bars and clubs and she can go for long walks in the park, runs, jogs, she can shift in the woods and do laps in her coyote form. She can go to the movies, read, play video games like she never got to before.</p><p>It is... a little lonely, though. </p>
<hr/><p>Malia shifted and ran, and ran, and found herself in a quaint little village, with a few old-looking shops and houses and a nice-seeming B&amp;B. Malia hid behind some dustbins and shifted back, dropping the bag she'd been holding in her mouth previously, then picking it up with her now human hands and quickly removing the clothes she'd stashed away in there.</p><p>Once dressed, Malia left the little alley. Or, she was about to, then she heard a sudden, rather loud, <em>crack. </em></p><p>Malia jolted, and turned around instinctively. Her claws were already out, and her eyes were likely glowing blue, but her fangs had only partially made themselves known. </p><p>"Ah," The woman who was the source of the noise - said? Malia had never figured out if it was 'said' when people... made those noises? anyway - said. "Eet appears I 'ave startled you. I am sorry." She said, in somewhat heavily accented English. </p><p>Malia might have sworn when the woman appeared, which is probably why she knew to speak something other than French. </p><p>"Where did you come from?" Malia half-growled, startled still and not pleased by that. She was still on-edge from all the fighting the Anuk-Ite and all the previous things had caused, alongside her Mother, but at the same time, she'd grown complacent. Nothing had tried to kill her in over a month, after all. Malia resolved to pay closer attention to her surroundings; wherever the woman came from had made a loud noise, of course, but...</p><p>Malia didn't get to finish that thought.</p><p>"I apparated, of course," The woman pursed her lips at Malia. "Surely ze Americans taught you apparition? Or," She frowned, angry, but not at Malia. Curious. "Or, perhaps, iz ze American government as - barbaric as Europe's iz regarding ze education of Shapeshifters such as yourself?"</p><p>"Uhm." Malia - said. The woman humphed. "I imagine you don't even know what I am on about, do you?" "No," Malia said, bluntly. "Not a clue."</p><p>The woman laughed. It was a pretty sound - there was an edge to it, though. A buzzing, almost, that made Malia's head feel a little fuzzy. The woman really was rather pretty. "At least you are honest," The woman said. "It iz rare, zese days, though less rare than eet used to be." The woman told her, though Malia had no idea what she meant by any of that.  </p><p>The woman was blonde. Malia frowned at her, squinting. Something was - strange, though. A little fuzzy. "But I have no manners," The woman said, "I am Fleur Delacour," She said, "And you?"</p><p>"Malia Tate," Malia told her, seeing no real reason not to. "And you are which type of shapeshifter?" The woman asked. "Werecoyote," Malia said. The woman likely didn't know the significance of blue eyes, and for now, Malia wasn't going to tell her. It was likely, Malia thought, because she hadn't reacted particularly negatively or positively to her eyes; in fact, she'd shown rather no strong emotions about any of this at all. </p><p>"I have never 'eard of zat," Fleur Delacour said, musing. "Iz eet specific to America?"</p><p>"I don't think so," Malia said. "Maybe?"</p><p>Fleur Delacour humphed, again. Malia glanced towards the entrance to the alley. "I was 'ere to do a bit of birthday shopping for my daughter, Victoire," Fleur said, her eyes boring into Malia's. Malia got a distinct feeling that Fleur had assessed her in some way, and found her satisfactory enough to tell her such things. "And I imagine you were 'ere for some shopping too?"</p><p>"Not a birthday, but yeah," Malia said. "I wanted to browse." She'd gotten to browse before, of course. Kira liked to look around, Stiles liked to just... be togther, she supposed. Enjoy the quiet moments of mundane life. Lydia was perhaps the most exacting of the lot when it came to shopping; she knew what she wanted and if she didn't she'd take one look at something and decide to 'try it out' or 'try it on' and they would discard it very quickly if Lydia felt it wasn't worthy of being in either of their possession. </p><p>Malia swallowed lightly. She hadn't said goodbye to a lot of people. </p><p>"Come, then," Fleur Delacour said, imperiously. "We shall walk togezer. 'Ave you shopped 'ere before?" </p><p>"No," Malia said. "I just found the place."</p><p>Fleur nodded as she strode out of the alley. The clothes she was wearing, Malia realised, changed at the flick of the stick she was holding. The clothes she'd had before resembled somewhat a dress, but different. This attire, now, looked more like a fashionable, clean-cut women's suit, with a pencil skirt and sharp lines, perfectly tailored to her figure. </p><p>Malia mentally prepared herself, before following the woman onto the street.</p><p>"Zese are 'igh-class establishments," Fleur started explaining. "So zat attire is... acceptable if you 'ave ze money to show off. I shop 'ere rarely, zese days; the stock was so much better in ze early two-thousands - but I digress," She stopped suddenly in front of a clothes store which didn't even bother labelling prices. The stuff on the racks was gaudy and strange, and they looked - </p><p>"Az you can see," Fleur said, gesturing disdainfully towards the store, "Ze 'igh-couture muggles 'ave gotten stranger and stranger... though, I do suppose eet iz better than the stagnation of wizarding fashion over the last... oh, seventy years?" She glowered forward, but not necessarily directly at the shop itself. "No matter. Follow me," She spun on her heel, long blonde hair kept back neatly in a ponytail swishing behind her. Malia did so, for lack of anything better to do, and the woman continued in this vain with the other shops.</p><p>She stopped complaining when they reached the midway point of the street, and started making approving noises and even a few pleased sentences once they reached the far end. </p><p>"And 'ere we are," she said. "My daughter has wanted this dress for a few months now - I am rather glad," Fleur confided, "That she az not gained an interest in clothes zat are only 'in season'." Fleur sniffed. "Trends come and go. Zere are classics, zen zere is what we saw in the first shop, which is 'in season', if you are to believe ze muggles."</p><p>"Right," Malia said. Lydia had talked about much the same stuff, if a little differently and with no mention of 'wizarding fashion' or 'muggles' - which, <em>what the fuck - </em>but... hmm.</p><p>Perhaps this could be interesting. Regardless - Malia's been a little restless these last few days. It was that restlessness which brought her here in the first place, and she supposes that wasn't so bad, now, was it? </p><p>"Come," Fleur said, and Malia followed her into the shop. What followed was a rapid-fire conversation between Fleur and one of the shop's employees, entirely in french. To be fair, Malia should really have learned the language at least a little before she decided to come here but... well. Mistakes were made. Lapses in judgement. </p><p>She'll learn. A fair few people had told her she was quick at that when she wanted to be. </p><p>Fleur and Malia left the shop fifteen minutes later with Victoire's dress and a pair of jeans Malia felt weirdly guilty about buying, even if it was her father's money. </p><p>She hadn't let him buy her a car. She'd used her mother's money for that. </p><p>"So," Fleur said. "I suppose I should explain ze wizarding community of France, az eet iz rather different from your American version."</p><p>"Yeah," Malia said. "Must be." France was different from the USA in so many ways. Why would the supernatural world be any different? Malia had never met any wizards before, true, and it was strange that Fleur seemed to think she had - but Malia would only correct her if that seemed like a good idea, and right now... something in her gut made her think it wasn't. </p><p>Perhaps it was the paranoia. But Malia couldn't shake the feeling this woman wouldn't like to know she'd told someone wholly unaware of magic about magic. </p><p>Fleur held out her arm once they reached the alley way. "I can apparate you into ze street," She said, "Bypassing ze statue. I shall show it you when we leave. First, though - books. I shall attempt to tell you all I know that would be useful, but zere are some things only you will need zat I do not know or care for knowing."</p><p>At least she seemed honest enough. Malia took her arm. "I must warn you," Fleur said, "Zat side-along apparition is... unpleazant for the first few trips." And with that, and a sickening <em>crack, </em>they were gone from the alley. But Malia could feel the movement - and Fleur was right, it was <em>awful, </em>and Malia was wholly certain if she - could tell if she had a stomach and a mouth right now in the right places, she'd have vomited up lunch. </p><p> </p><p> </p>
