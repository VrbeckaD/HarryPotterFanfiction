    <p>“You’re lovely,” Gellert surprises Newt that night; he’s not sure why he didn’t realize Grindelwald got inside the case.</p><p>Newt blushes to the tip of his ears, trying to get Dougal back to his nest. It’s unbelievable how Gellert can still make him flustered after months of being together.</p><p>“What are you doing here?” Newt giggles when he feels Gellert’s arms around his shoulders.</p><p>“I’ve come for you,” he whispers in Newt’s ear, right before he kisses the back of his neck. “You need to go back to bed, darling.”</p><p>“But I have to feed the occamys first.”</p><p>“Then we’ll feed them and then we go back to sleep, alright?” Gellert takes one of his hands and intertwines their fingers together.</p><p>Newt nods, feeling warm inside; it has never been a problem for him to do everything on his own, but now that he has someone he can appreciate how good it feels to have company, to feel cared for and protected.</p><p>After they feed all of the occamys and Newt’s sure the rest of them are fine, he goes back to bed with Gellert and curls up happily next to him.</p>
