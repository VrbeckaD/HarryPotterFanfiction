    <p>At the end of the summer, Harry was happy he would be going back to Hogwarts. Dudley was a terror ever since his girlfriend had left for college. Harry bore the brunt of his anger and couldn't wait to step through the barrier on the platform 9 and 3/4.</p><p>Harry loaded his trunk and Hedwigâ€™s cage into the car. He was minding his own business when Dudley decided to pour his cup of his mother's lemonade on Harry's head, right before they were leaving for the train station. Harry gasped and pushed Dudley over, punching him in his overly large gut. His Aunt Petunia yelled at him and pushed him into the car while Dudley laughed and ran into the house.</p><p>Uncle Vernon got into the car and turned around to threaten Harry. "Listen here boy! This is a warning to keep your head down at the train station." Harry just sighed and tried to move into a more comfortable position, since his shirt and pants got soaked when Dudley pulled his prank. Biting his lip to keep back his insult, Harry just stared out his window. He tried his best to ignore his family, their insults really weren't going to dampen his spirits today.<br/>-<br/>I hope you like! I have no idea where this story is headed but it is nice to write something</p>
