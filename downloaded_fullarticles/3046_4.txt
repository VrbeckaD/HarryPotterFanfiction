    <p>August 1, 1975</p>
<p>Severus Snape sits alone in his room in his house on Spinner's End, thinking about the offer he was made at the end of the previous term. It has been two months since the proposal of joining the Death Eaters, and of training with Avery and Mulciber. Two months, and he still has not made his final decision. He has until September 1st, that much he was told before departing for the summer holidays. They mentioned power and glory: two very things he has desired for many years. He has long thought of himself as lonely, with the only exception being his childhood friend, Lily Evans.  But he also thinks of himself as weak.  Weakness brought on from his less-than-grand home life, as well as being a constant target for the torment of his longtime enemies, James Potter and Sirius Black.</p>
<p>He strongly believes that he would do well because of his passion for the Dark Arts; he even went so far to create a particularly nasty Dark curse of his own, Sectumsempra. He has intended to use it on Potter and Black one of these days, but they always seemed to have the element of surprise. It’s as if they’re waiting for him around every corner, their "pranks" becoming excessively nastier with each passing day. He considers for some time all of the good that he would get from of accepting this offer. Through joining the Death Eaters, he could finally be something to someone, and he would no longer be weak. Worries about people like Potter and Black would become a thing of the past.</p>
<p>Lately Lily, his only true friend, and the one he has loved since the very beginning, has not seemed to want to help him out nearly as much as she has in the past. She still despises Potter and Black for how they treat the person who told her all about the existence of magic, and the one who became her very first magical friend. However, she disapproves of nearly everything he has come to know and love. She dislikes the Dark Arts, and she objects to his contact with Avery and Mulciber.</p>
<p>"There is something not right about those two. The things they say and do are horrible," her words have echoed in his mind more than once.</p>
<p>Severus has had enough of constantly being viewed as an outcast- Like he could have helped this hellhole that he is forced to call a life! Lily has other friends now, where he still has only her. They, like everyone else, saw him as a lost cause from the very moment the sorting hat was placed on his head and called out the word "Slytherin." But he just can't stop thinking of all the potential he could have if he agrees to the offer. He takes all this into account for the first time in the two months. He can’t believe how much time he has already wasted, and makes his final decision. He will join the Death Eaters. It will prove the escape necessary to finally get himself out of this awful situation- A situation that he has desired to get himself out of for nearly his entire life.</p>
