    <p>Blaise Zabin had always been the proper pureblood Heiress.</p><p>She had never allowed herself to fall into the same useless vices other girls her age took for granted or went ga-ga over. Be they boys, make-up, gossip, or vanity.</p><p>As a strong, independent young woman, Blaise saw herself as a leader and role-model for other young girls. At the tender age of thirteen, she had the world at her feet! or rather just her fellow Slytherins.</p><p>Blaise was the undisputed Queen of Slytherin. Draco, the poor dear, really had the silliest idea that he was somehow the prince of Slytherin!</p><p>Blaise could not help shaking her head at her oblivious best friend, Draco had always seen himself as the leader of Slytherin. And in most cases, that would have been true, especially as a Malfoy. But Draco had the unfortunate habit of being as rash and more fool-hardy than a Gryffindor!</p><p>Draco didn't have a cunning bone in his body! Sometimes Blaise wondered how her friend even made it into the house of cunning and ambition.</p><p>Case and point, his ongoing rivalry with Harry Potter. Blaise had explained over and over again that baiting Potter only made him look like a fool! That he should allow Potter to commit social and political suicide by entertaining the Weasley's.</p><p>By engaging Potter, and by extension Ronald Weasley, he was giving them credibility and making them relevant.</p><p>The silly fool would just nod in agreement and then go right back to fighting Potter and Weasley in the hallways, like an uncouth ruffian, totally ignoring her advice. </p><p>It was enough to give a girl wrinkles! </p><p>It seemed like ever since Potter turned down Draco's hand of friendship, the boy still held a deep grudge against Potter.</p><p>Blaise had cautioned him many times on antagonizing Potter, the boy who lived had many supporters, though not as many as he did before he'd started hanging around Weasley. It was still a significant amount, but Draco was arrogant, coasting along on his father's power and name. </p><p>But for all Draco's rather Gryffindor mannerisms, he was incredibly loyal and generous to those he considered his friends.</p><p>Potter, the fool-missed out! Draco was worth ten Weasley's! Blaise knew her bestfriend could be a brash, hotheaded, spoiled and rude little shit! But she loved him anyway! Blaise accepted Draco, flaws and all.</p><p>That is why she had Draco posing as the Prince of Slytherin. Though her silly dragon did not know that he was merely a figurehead, he walked with full confidence as the monarch of slytherin.</p><p> </p><p>The idea to allow Draco the title of Prince of Slytherin, had been Blaise's greatest idea.</p><p>To the rest of Hogwarts, Draco was the Prince and leader of Slytherin. But to all the other Slytherins, they knew well who their true leader was.</p><p>To keep suspicion off her, and to keep from hurting Draco's fragile little ego, Blaise had instructed the rest of the slytherin's to let Draco have his way. He could be rather spoiled at times and whiny, but Draco was a rather good lad once you got to know him. So the rest of Slytherin house followed her directive and indulged Draco in his fantasy. </p><p>This kind of thinking made it more apparent why Blaise was considered one of the most cunning people of her house, if not Hogwarts. </p><p>At 13 years old, she had perpetuated the longest running scheme in Slytherin history!</p><p>That the rest of Hogwarts still believed that Draco was the leader of Slytherin, as well as the fact that nobody had caught on, or realized who the true power of Slytherin was, caused many of House Slytherin to smile in secret amusement and pride.</p><p>This anonymity gave Blaise the ability to create and strengthen her spy network all throughout Hogwarts.</p><p>Draco was a perfect figurehead, taking the attention off of Blaise and the movements of the other Slytherins. No one saw the truth, they saw what they wanted to see. </p><p>They had done it! They had managed to fool the entirety of Hogwarts!</p><p>Because of Blaise, the Slytherins were finally living up to their founder's ideals: To be cunning, swift, watchful and ambitious. To wait for opportunity and strike when it came. To rule from the shadows. To control the narrative and fool the unwashed masses to your true aim.</p><p>Blaise, with the help of her fellow Slytherins had done all of that.</p><p> </p><p>Draco may have been their first choice, back in first year, he had been the only candidate that had been deemed worthy. But when the Reaping took place-the traditional event where the older students torture and torment the first years, until they break or cry for mercy. Draco had barely lasted a day, breaking down the second things got difficult.</p><p>From this event, the shadow council- a group of 7th year Slytherins, would determine their picks for future leader, where Draco was summarily cut from the running. Blaise on the other hand, had been the only first year not to break. Instead, she'd given as good as she'd got, using spells way above first-year level.</p><p>At the time, Blaise had not known what the hell was going on, none of the first years did, but she had managed to fight back and rally the other first years. Blaise hadn't known or understood, that she had become the single focus of not only the Shadow council  but the entire House. She was the first candidate worthy of the title Queen of Slytherin.</p><p>There had never been a Queen of Slytherin, only ever Kings or Princes. No other female had ever survived the Reaping or risen above to such a place of power.</p><p>Now, in her third year, she ruled from the shadows, pulling strings, and generally being overlooked as a threat.</p><p>But then again, Blaise was the ultimate Slytherin.</p><p> </p><p> </p>
