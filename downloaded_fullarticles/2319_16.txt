  <em> <strong>Ministry Rooftop and Adjacent Buildings - Near Midnight</strong> </em>
</p>
<p>It was the third one tonight.</p>
<p>He watched as the occasional slow burn would flash along the older man’s countenance and licked his lips. Apparently, there was time to brood this evening. A slow smile tugged at his lips. <em>Not to worry, Alastor.</em> <em>You’ll have plenty to fill your time with while you wait for the Order to decide on their next move. </em>He drew deeper into the shadows of the rooftop where he often sat watching the Head Auror.</p>
<p>It was his second favorite obsession.</p>
<p>Slipping deeper into the streets London, he intentionally wound his way deeper into muggle territory, until at long last he took cover and apparated into his back yard. He used his front door at the usual times. For his other…hobbies, he found it safer to draw as little attention as possible. He’d chosen the life of a boring, predictable underachiever, and then he assumed that façade.</p>
<p>There was only one place where the many faces he’d learned to wear over the years melted away, and he was just…<em>Evan.</em></p>
<p>But to the wizarding world, he was the first and only son of Tybalt Rosier. He was a pureblood with connections to the Blacks and money to spare. And perhaps most importantly (at least in his father’s eyes), he was an eligible bachelor.</p>
<p>A state of existence that he intended to maintain.</p>
<p>The last thing he needed was a woman bumbling about his orderly existence. Odds were, he’d end up having to kill her, and then there would be questions. Ultimately there was no payoff for that kind of burden.</p>
<p>He popped the collar of his great coat, dragging it just a little closer. The chill of autumn was finally setting in, and he was reminded of the leaves that would dance along the open corridors of Hogwarts, heralding the approach of winter, and with it the promise of Christmas.</p>
<p>He moved swiftly down the neatly manicured cobbles to the main patio where he began the meticulous routine of cleaning his shoes. When he was satisfied that he wouldn’t drag anything into the house he moved into the green house, and headed for the sink to wash his hands.</p>
<p>“Tolmi.”</p>
<p>“Master Evan?” The scrawny little house elf puffed into existence several steps back, his lantern gold eyes wide and unblinking as the creature peered up at him expectantly.</p>
<p>Evan didn’t look away from the cuticles and nails he was carefully scraping. He’d use magic to truly scour himself of course, but there was something satisfying about cleaning away the grime of his activities himself. Picking up a clean towel, he began drying his hands before finally turning around to face his house elf.</p>
<p>“I’d like a light repast – sandwiches and fruit would be fine.” He discarded the towel and made his way to the stairs. “I’ll be visiting my cabin in the north tomorrow evening. Make sure the pet cage has been cleaned. It was rancid this afternoon when I stopped by to check on them.”</p>
<p>“Tolmi be sure of it.” The house elf’s ears waved with his enthusiastic nodding.</p>
<p>Evan nodded and started up the stairs. “See that you do.”</p>
<p>Tomorrow would be a <em>very</em> interesting day.</p>

  <em><strong>The Next Night – Around 11PM – Florean Fortescue Ice Cream Parlor</strong> </em>
</p>
<p>It had taken <em>months</em> of surveillance to nail down the perfect time for his latest masterpiece, and half as long to identify the weaknesses in the protection spells that shielded the ice cream parlor, but it was the perfect setting. He’d chosen a central table and carefully posed the muggle couple at the table, complete with bowls of ice cream. Beneath the table was a half-blood couple that had been preaching the Dark Lord’s propaganda while living with muggles to hide from the very wizard they sang praises about.</p>
<p>He hated hypocrites.</p>
<p>That hatred was obvious in the way he’d posed them, cowering under a table instead of facing danger head on with wands raised. Their mostly naked bodies were littered with cuts, burns, and other magic inflected injuries, making it clear that he’d ‘played’ for more than a while before he’d finally delivered them to death. The muggles hadn’t really been a threat, but being the self-respecting Deatheater that he was—he’d felt obliged to deal with them. Wouldn’t do to let them wander about. There was no telling who they’d go talking to. Best to cut those threads immediately. No loose ends meant neat and tidy, just the way he liked it.</p>
<p>However, the piece de resistance was in the set of initials he’d carved into each person’s heel. <em>A. M.</em> It was rather like an address because he knew that Alastor would be brought in immediately. He counted on it. The wily auror wouldn’t risk one of his other aurors finding the letter he’d left tucked neatly into the breast coat pocket of the muggle’s coat.</p>
<p>He leaned more fully into the wall as he watched the parlor, waiting for someone to see the gruesome presentation. He knew he wouldn’t have to wait long. There was a gaggle of women that met like clockwork once a week. Then they’d make their way down to the little corner café just a block down from the ice cream parlor.</p>
<p>
  <em>Soon, Alastor. Soon. </em>
</p>
<p>(<em>Located in the muggle's coat pocket is the following letter. It is written on standard parchment found in any store, and the ink is equally unremarkable. It is 'clean' apart from the blood that stains it.</em>)</p>
