  <em> The air was saturated in the warm scent of cinnamon and apples. A familiar place to be during his dreams. Harry shivered as cool, slim hands ran up his arms to his shoulders, short nails digging into his skin, leaving half-moon crescents on his shoulder blades before moving on to tuck into his unruly curls, pulling his head down until Harry’s lips connected the burning skin of the pale, slender neck below him, hearing his lover release a moan at the connection. He didn’t, couldn’t stop the slow, hard grind of his hips into the form below him. He couldn’t. Not when his partner was letting out all those little whimpers, the delicious moans that sounded like a deity or possibly his name and body wracking shivers of delight. Harry couldn’t help but bite at the pale skin of his lover, using his teeth to caress the bobbing Adam’s apple, allowing his tongue to trace imaginary lines across the hot skin before blowing a stream of cool air across the wet skin, eliciting another shiver, a stronger shiver accompanied with a low moan, turning the lovely neck below him a nice shade of pink and even red in some places. A beautiful color caused by Harry’s mouth and the scruff of his beard where it scraped and scratched. His mystery lover gasped and canted his sharp hips up, causing his hard cock to brush against Harry’s own member as he held himself above the lithe body spread on his dark sheets, pushing a growl to escape Harry’s throat that had the being below him falling still. And there was no way Harry could begin to stop the flare of pleasure at the show of obedience or the purr of delight that escaped his throat a moment later even if he wanted too. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> Harry tightened his hands on the slim hips, making sure to leave bruises along the alabaster skin that would still be there upon waking and ground down again. “You’re such a good boy hmm?” </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> Instinctively Harry knew it was a rhetorical question because the man below him was always good for him. His blond lover had always been so good for him in their past shared dreams. Every time they learned something new about the other. “What do you want baby?” Harry crooned in his lover’s ear, taking note of the shiver it always produced, licking the soft skin of his earlobe before pulling on it with his teeth, eliciting a whimper of delight. “Use your words baby.” He softly commanded into the damp flesh beneath his lips. It was a game they played, learned months ago since the dreams started. His mate was shy, reserved and timid where Harry was bold as brass, greedy for the pleasure he knew awaited them and not lacking in Gryffindor courage in order to take them there. His lover needed time, needed the coaxing of soft words and even softer touches before he allowed himself to lose control enough to ask and eventually beg for his pleasure. Harry savored all those moments. Where the two of them were perfectly in sync with each other before they both became lost in the space created between them. Lost in the heat only a mate could light. Lost in the commanding touches and the power play until it became too much for the both of them and they succumbed to their perfect fire. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> Harry pulled back to smile at the man below him. He knew this man even though his features had always been hidden from Harry’s sight. The long pale limbs that liked to wrap around Harry, pulling him ever closer, the sharp edges of his bones beneath smooth soft skin that went on for ages, long white blond hair that spread across his pillow. He looked as if he belonged on Harry’s bed for the rest of time, lazy in the lap of luxury, pampered and spoilt on everything Harry could and would give him. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> “Please.” A fevered whimper came from behind a bottom lip trapped by teeth, catching his attention and Harry realized he had stopped thrusting and was just staring at the perfection below him. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> “Use your words babydoll.” He commanded, using his deep authoritative voice.The scent of apples and cinnamon flooded his nostrils, stronger than before, making his cock even harder if that was possible. Harry ground down again, teasingly, making sure his cock slid against his lover’s, eliciting a high pitched moan. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> “Cock!” The male gasped beneath him, withering in his arms, ignoring the hands on his hips, raising them, attempting to entice Harry into doing what he wanted, more touch, more taste instead of asking like Harry wanted him too. Had commanded him to do. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> Harry smoothed his hands around the soft skin to his lover’s plump arse, lifting his hips up, silently urging the blonde male wrap his long, colt-like legs around his waist. Harry looked down and watched as his length pressed against his lovers, slicking each other up, precome making the glide smooth and hard. Harry hooked his hands under the other males knees, pushing them back against his chest, spreading his legs almost as wide as they could go and allowing Harry to press closer. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> “Harry.” His lover whined, making Harry bare his teeth and rolled his hips again, faster, making his cock to slide against the other’s hard flesh. “Harry!” The pale man gasped, chanted, moving his hips as much as possible within Harry’s tight grip to meet thrust after thrust. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> “Use your words…” Harry emphasize his point with a quick but hard slap on his lover’s bottom, where his thigh met his arse. He grinned feraly when his lover squealed in surprise. But a moment later Harry was purring at his lover’s words. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> “Yes! Please Harry. Pleasepleaseplease put your hard cock in me. Fill me up, all the way, fuck me, take me, claim me, knot me!” The smaller man was writhing in his arms, hard cock leaking all that delicious precome onto his toned stomach, making Harry want to lick it off, but he was distracted at the moment. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> Knot me. Knot. Me. Knot me, knot me, knotmeknotmeknotmeknotmeknotme kept wringing through his head, breaking what little control he had over himself for a moment before Harry wrestled his instinct to just shove his cock into the body below him back into his grasp. He released his lover’s hip with one hand, trailing his fingers across the soft, quivering skin on the back of a taunt thigh, to the base of his lover’s balls, drawn tight in anticipation of what was to come. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> “Not until I command it.” Harry said softly to himself as he gently pulled on the wrinkled skin of his sack before running a finger down the crack of his arse until he found the wrinkled, puckered hole. Completely and unexpectedly soaked. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> That was new. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> Harry’s eyes snapped to his lover’s face. Grey eyes widened in surprise as Harry unconsciously pushed his finger into that tight wet heat, all the way to the first knuckle. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> “Alpha….” The blonde screamed as his arse tightened around his digit, cock pumping come onto his chest, spraying so hard some landed on his cheek. It was Harry’s turn to be surprised as his lover gushed slick as he came, squirting all over the bed and his hand. Harry hurriedly removed his finger from the Omega’s arse, using his now soaked palm to slick up his throbbing cock before pushing the male’s knees back and up to his ears, allowing his glistening hole to be exposed. Harry used a hand to guide the tip of his cock to his lover’s soaked hole, pausing to take a breath before he pushed in. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> “Omega.” Harry breathed, watching as his lover’s eyes widened and his body relaxed to allow him in, almost like it was sucking him deep. </em>
