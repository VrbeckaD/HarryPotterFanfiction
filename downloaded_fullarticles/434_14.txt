    <p>Cormac sat up straight,staring his cousin Millie in her dark eyes.</p><p>”Let me get this straight,Mills. You want me to teach you how to make love? Why not Blaise himself? That one night stand I had with Penelope Miller doesn’t really count......”</p><p>Millicent took Cormac’s hands in hers. “You’re family,Cormac. I trust you not to hurt me. Blaise might accidentally do so. You’re gentle.”</p><p>”Very well. Challenge accepted. But just this once.”</p><p>Millie led him to her bed. It was an attic bed,in a bedroom fitted out with the warm gold colors of the House of Bulstrode. The bed itself was fresh-made,pillows distributed haphazardly at the head. The Sun shone warmly through a skylight.</p><p>The two undressed in relative silence. When they had finished,they gave each other’s naked body a once-over.</p><p>Cormac found a strange beauty in Millie’s chunkiness. She was a little shorter than him,reaching up to his mouth. Her shoulders were wide,like a Muggle farmer,supporting breasts easily the size of the Hufflepuffs’ endless cookie jar and which were dotted with a spray of freckles,and her jaw was thickset in a determined way. Her complexion was pale but still attractive:to him she resembled a waxen figurine with all her curves. Her wavy black hair cascaded down her back to her bum,and her hazel eyes shone with mirth as she reached for him,embracing him. They kissed briefly as Millicent pulled out her wand from the dresser and traced a figure eight with it. Cormac stiffened all of a sudden.</p><p>”What was that?”</p><p>”A 24 hour contraceptive charm. Wouldn’t want a new scion for my house now,would we?”, she laughed.</p><p>They sat down on her bed,Millie facing him. “We’ll start with the basics,Cormac. Kissing,fondling,that sort of thing.” With that she pushed him onto the pillows. She then straddled him,sitting almost on his belly button.</p><p>She leaned in,grabbing one of his hands and using it to cup a breast. “I like you”,she purred,nipping Cormac’s cheek with her lips. Again they kissed. “You’re my best buddy.”</p><p>”Being seductive,Millie? It becomes you.”</p><p>”Always.” She arched her eyebrows as he felt her,moving down,kneading her bum.</p><p>They moved together,skin on skin. <em>This feels so good. <br/> <br/></em>Next,they rolled over so Millie was on the bed. Cormac found that her tits were squeeze-worthy. “What’s in them,Mill?”<em><br/></em></p><p>She snorted with laughter. “Milk,ya dummy. Drink up.”</p><p>When he’d had his fill,the grand moment came. Millie sat on his dick.</p><p>”I’m going to time you so we come at the same time. Alright?”</p><p>Cormac nodded,and she inserted him into herself. Over the next few hours,they learned much about each other:</p><ul>
<li>She laughed during orgasm. Laughed with mirth enough for the whole of Hogsmeade’s inns. <br/><br/>
</li>
<li>When she kissed,it took your breath away. He gasped into her shoulder as he recovered.</li>
<li> The best sex is between people who know each other well,as they did. After they both came,they explored each other. An afterglow suffused her skin,made her look like some peasant goddess.</li>
<li>Those thighs,oh God,those thighs. They smelt good,they felt good,they tasted good.</li>
</ul>
