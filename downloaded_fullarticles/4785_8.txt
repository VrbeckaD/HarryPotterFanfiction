          <div class="userstuff"><p align="justify">remus loved sirius, he really did, but this was not a good idea.<br/>
right now sirius has harry on his motorbike with a helmet on that’s way too big for him. harry had turned 5 just yesterday, and he kept yelling “bike!” the whole day. sirius probably thought he was doing something so amazing, because he was wearing a shit eating grin on his face.<br/>
“sirius, enlighten me on what he’s doing on your motorbike” remus asked, making sure to look as pissed as possible.<br/>
“it was his birthday wish! i can’t change destiny, moonshine!”, sirius whined back. remus groaned, he thought sirius would be smart enough to know that toddlers can’t ride on motorbikes.<br/>
“love, harry is just a toddler. may i remind you it’s probably illegal for him to ride on a motorbike?”, remus picked harry up off the bike and took the helmet off, handing it to sirius.<br/>
“i’m going inside to put harry down for his nap. don’t be too upset, babe.” remus kissed sirius’ cheek before walking inside, carrying a babbling harry.</p><p>after remus had gotten harry to fall asleep, he met sirius in the living room: he had his hair in a distressed bun, and he was drinking tea. remus sat down in his lap and kissed his forehead.<br/>
“when he’s older”, remus mumbled against sirius’ forehead.<br/>
“what?” sirius hummed. remus knew he’d heard him, he just wanted it to be said again.<br/>
“you can let harry ride the motorbike when he’s older.”<br/>
“yes! love you, moony”<br/>
“love you too, padfoot, you dork”<br/>
and with that, everything was peaceful. they fell asleep cuddled up on the couch, and sirius may have dreamed of remus riding his motorbike. maybe.</p></div>
