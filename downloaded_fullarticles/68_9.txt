  <span>Pansy Parkinson hated everyone. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>And what was even worse – she only realised it during her fifth year at Hogwarts. She wasn’t surprised when anger overcame her once she’d heard that Potter and his gang managed not to suffer any consequences of their activity in Dumbledore’s Army. What did surprise her was this… satisfaction that she felt after what had happened to Umbridge. After all, as an honorary member of the Inquisitorial Squad, she would’ve expected something entirely different. And yet, she hated her too. It was only then that she started to really think it all over. She wasn’t the person she thought she was. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Since her first year at Hogwarts, she was trying to impress Draco Malfoy, and after watching him for a short while, she came to the simple conclusion – the best way to do so was to act like him. So, she started taunting people. What gave her immense satisfaction was mocking her childhood friend, Parvati Patil, who started ignoring her as soon as they got into Hogwarts. But back then, she didn’t know why. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>But now she knew – she just hated everyone. It didn’t matter if they were ‘the good ones’ or ‘the bad ones’ or even those neutral ones. She couldn’t stand them all. Neville Longbottom? A complete loser. Luna Lovegood? More like Loony. Ron Weasley? Thinks he’s cool because he’s friends with Potter. Hermione Granger? Insufferable know-it-all. Not to mention a mudblood. Harry Potter? How the hell can someone be so ignorant, yet still get to be the hero? Every goddamn time?</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>But it wasn’t the end of her list. Well, technically, it didn’t end at all, but she was quite surprised when she figured out she hated a handful of Slytherins as well. She couldn’t look at Crabbe and Goyle without feeling sick. And every time she as much as glanced at Milicent Bulstrode, she found it almost impossible to resist the urge of punching her in the face. But that wouldn’t have ended well for her, and sadly, she was aware of that. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Did she have any specific reason? No. She just hated them all.<br/>
There were only three people she tolerated. One of them was Blaise Zabini. She liked him mainly because he was the only person with whom she could sit in silence without feeling uncomfortable. And with his snarky comments, he was probably the only creature in the entire universe who could shut Draco up, which was – to say the least – extremely impressive. Another person was Theodore Nott who just wasn’t that irritating, and a fact he was a loner, somehow lifted her spirits. Sure, he made wrong jokes at the worst of times, but somehow she didn’t find it so annoying.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>And, of course, the worst of them all, the Slytherin prince himself. In some ways, she hated him too – or rather, wanted to hate him – but it was different, not like with the rest of humanity. He was the only one who actually took the time to understand her and treat her like a normal human being. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>He was lying next to her, his head in her lap while she was gently stroking his hair. She actually forgot about the hatred for a second, before Zabini came back and created a commotion, just because the door wouldn’t close. He fell on Goyle, which must have been a final blow to his ego of abnormal size. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>‘So, Zabini,’ said Malfoy after the commotion finally settled, ‘what did Slughorn want?’</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>‘Just trying to make up to well-connected people,’ replied Zabini, apparently trying to get on Draco’s nerves. Again. It was painfully obvious he was trying to highlight the fact that Malfoy was <em>not</em> invited. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>‘Not that he managed to find many’ he added. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>‘Who else had he invited?’ asked Malfoy blankly, while Pansy was still stroking his hair as if she couldn’t stop. She was doing it automatically. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>‘McLaggen from Gryffindor –’</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>‘Oh yeah, he’s uncle’s big in the Ministry.’</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>‘ – someone else called Belby, from Ravenclaw –’</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>‘Not him, he’s a prat!’ snickered Pansy.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>‘ – and Longbottom, Potter, and that Weasley girl,’ finished Zabini. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Draco sat up very suddenly, knocking Pansy’s hand aside. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>‘He invited Longbottom?’ he asked, not trying to hide his annoyance anymore. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>‘Well, I assume so, as Longbottom was there,’ replied Blaise indifferently, although Pansy knew that he actually enjoyed infuriating Draco. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>‘What’s Longbottom got to interest Slughorn?’ </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Zabini just shrugged but didn’t say anything. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>‘Potter, precious Potter, obviously he wanted a look at “the Chosen One”,’ sneered Draco a moment later, ‘but that Weasley girl! What’s so special about her?’</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>‘Well…’ said Pansy, watching Draco closely for his reaction, ‘a lot of boys like her. Even you think she’s good-looking, don’t you Blaise, and we all know how hard you are to please!’</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Zabini smirked for a short moment, but then snarled, ‘I wouldn’t touch a filthy little blood traitor like her, whatever she looked like.’</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>And although she knew it wasn’t entirely true, she was quite pleased with the answer. Malfoy sank back across her lap and allowed her to resume the stroking of his hair. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>‘Well, I pity Slughorn’s taste,’ he spoke up after a moment. ‘Maybe he’s going a bit senile. Shame, my father always said he was a good wizard in his day. My father used to be a bit of a favourite of his. Slughorn probably hasn’t heard I’m on the train, or –’</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>‘I wouldn’t bank on an invitation,’ Zabini interrupted. ‘He asked me about Nott’s father when I first arrived. They used to be old friends, apparently, but when he heard he'd been caught at the Ministry, he didn’t look happy. And Nott didn’t get an invitation, did he? I don’t think Slughorn’s interested in Death Eaters.’</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>She felt how Draco tensed up, but he let out a singularly humourless laugh. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>‘Well, who cared what he’s interested in? What is he, when you come down to it? Just some stupid teacher,’ he yawned ostentatiously. ‘I mean, I might not even be at Hogwarts next year, what’s it matter to me if some fat old has-been likes me or not?’</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Pansy thought for a second that she’d misheard. She ceased grooming his hair at once. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>‘What do you mean, you might not be at Hogwarts next year?’ she asked slowly, minding her trembling voice so that it wouldn’t give her away too much. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>‘Well, you never know,’ Draco said with a delicate smirk. ‘I might have – er – moved on to bigger and better things.’</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Pansy realised that she had stopped breathing. She shared a quick knowing and terrified look with Blaise, but Malfoy didn’t seem to notice. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>‘Do you mean – Him?’ Parkinson asked carefully. She thought that her heart might just jump out of her chest at any moment. An uncomfortable silence hung over them. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Draco just shrugged. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>‘Mother wants me to complete my education, but personally, I don’t see it as that important these days. I mean, think about it… When the Dark Lord takes over, is he going to care how many O.W.L.s or N.E.W.T.s anyone’s got? Of course he isn’t. It’ll be all about the kind of service he received, the level of devotion he was shown.’</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Blaise and Pansy shared uncertain looks again. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>‘And you think you’ll be able to do something for him?’ asked Zabini scathingly. ‘Sixteen years old and not even fully qualified yet?’</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>‘I’ve just said, haven’t I? Maybe he doesn’t care if I’m qualified. Maybe the job he wants me to do isn’t something that you need to be qualified for,’ said Draco quietly, leaving Pansy petrified. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>What did he mean? After all she’s done for him – from taking care of him when he was injured in the third grade to always being on his side – he’s saying he’s not coming back for the seventh year? She was almost sure everything was going according to her plan – in the fourth year they went to the Yule Ball together, and last year they spent a lot of time with each other performing their duties as prefects. And now he was laying on her lap. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>She was furious but didn’t flinch. During the holidays she decided that if she hated everyone apart from three people – those people were going to be the only ones she was going to interact with. But apparently, there was something wrong with Draco, he was different. He seemed to have become more… mysterious? Or maybe reserved. She knew he wasn’t telling them something, he acted almost as if he wanted to boast about it but couldn’t. He mentioned serving the Dark Lord but wasn’t straightforward, and he didn’t give away any specifics. And at the same time, he looked worried, which made her really anxious. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>‘<em>Well, that’s quite enough</em>,’ she told herself when he dismissed her. She just wanted to wait for him, try to talk. Very well, if he doesn’t want to say anything, she’s going to find out what’s going on, on her own. Nothing will hide from Pansy Parkinson. </span>
