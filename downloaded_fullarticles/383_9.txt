    <p>Harry could feel dozens of curious gazes burning in the back of her head as she followed Hagrid’s giant stature through the musty-smelling pub, crammed with people come to view the spectacle of the Girl-Who-Lived. Their quiet murmurs seemed more like roars to Harry's sensitive ears, and she could feel her heart beating frantically like a hummingbird, ready to burst free from her chest. She kept her gaze down at the floor, choosing instead to focus on the dirty floor of the Leaky Cauldron. Harry only dared to glance up to check they were making their way towards the exit, and she did so through the thick veil of her red hair, the messy curls acting as the perfect shield, hiding the marred left side of her face.</p><p>    For Harry, it took far too long for Hagrid to reach the exit, but she was relieved to finally be able to breathe in deep lungfuls of oxygen without smelling the poisonous stench of alcohol or tasting the musty, stale air of the half-rotting pub on her tongue. There was a lot to be said about magic from the little Harry had seen Hagrid perform, most notably giving Dudley a curly pig-tail, which Harry knew she would pay for later, but apparently whoever owned the pub had yet to grasp the basic rules of hygiene. Harry was sure that should Aunt Petunia ever step even an inch into the Leaky Cauldron, she'd be so overwhelmed with its disgusting state that she wouldn't be able to do anything but swoon and hopefully fall into one of the puddles of mysterious sticky liquid that appeared every few feet.</p><p>Her thoughts of Aunt Petunia soured however when Harry remembered that once the day ended, she'd have to return to Number Four, Privet Drive and would have to face the consequences of both her invitation to a school of magic and the 'damage' done to Dudley by Hagrid's well-meaning, but ill-advised intervention.</p><p>   Too absorbed in her melancholy, Harry almost the brickwork of the alley shifting. She glanced up in surprise, just in time to see a busy, bustling street revealed as the cracked bricks split apart and spun round in dizzying circles, making a hole in the wall large enough for a behemoth like Hagrid to fit through. Though Harry was not quite sure of the exact definition of 'behemoth', she was sure it adequately described the gentle giant and his lumbering walk as he stepped out into the street, the crowds parting for his large frame.</p><p>"Welcome 'arry, to Diagon Alley," Hagrid turned around, shooting a beaming smile at the direction of the tiny eleven-year-old cowering behind him. Gingerly, Harry stepped forwards, peering around Hagrid's hip which her head barely reached on her tip-toes. Instantly her eyes were assaulted by brightly lit shopfronts and the cries of shopkeeps trying to sell their wares, all the vivid colours and abstract shapes merging together, in part thanks to Harry's subpar vision. Her disbelief must have been evident on her face as when Harry glanced up at Hagrid, he was beaming widely at her, his beetle-black eyes crinkled rather adorably at the corners.</p><p>    As they made their way down the alley, Harry's green eyes eagerly drank in the vibrant scenery and the equally as colourful people milling around the street, dressed in strange, brightly coloured robes and complete with odd accessories like jaunty pointed hats decorated with what appeared to be moving stars. One gentleman was dressed entirely in lime green robes with a beard dyed sherbert pink, so long it brushed the cobbled street floor.</p><p>Harry's keen hearing couldn't help but pick up on tidbits of conversation including a plump woman outside '<em>Slug and Jiggers Apocothery</em>', bemoaning the price of diced frog's liver to a bored looking teenager dressed in what was likely the shop's uniform. Soft hooting, cooing and the occasional caw spilt from the dirty entryway into <em>Eelyops Owl Emporium</em> and Harry couldn't help but fixate on a large white owl in the window, currently shooting a baleful glare at the assistant trying to feed it.</p><p>The mid-afternoon sun shone brightly, and Harry squinted her eyes behind the useless lenses of her glasses against the glare of the shiny cauldrons stacked outside of Potage's Cauldron Shop, the sign beside them declaring them to be 'pewter collapsible cauldrons'.    "Yeah, you'll be needin' one o' those," Hagrid said, gesturing at the cauldron pile, "But first, we need to get yer money." And with a thick finger almost the width of Harry's thin wrist, Hagrid pointed at a grand marble building climbing above the higgledy-piggledy shops, stacked precariously on top of one another, and seemingly scraped the clear blue sky.</p><p>"Gringotts Wizardin' Bank," Hagrid announced as they reached the stairs up to the bank that gleamed impossibly white in the sunlight. Harry and Hagrid began to climb the stairs, Hagrid's gait easily pushing him ahead as he was able to take two of the giant marble steps at a time, Harry had to jog slightly to keep up but a lifetime of doing arduous chores and running from Dudley and his little gang of followers in blistering summer heat had done wonders for Harry's stamina, even in her malnourished state.</p><p>With Hagrid's strides and Harry's quick pace, they swiftly reached the dais at the top of the stairs and stood in front of the somewhat intimidating burnished bronze doors of the bank. The doors were engraved with runes, and in the topmost corner, there was an intricate drawing of what appeared a giant dragon breathing fire onto something, Harry assumed it was a village but her awful eyesight and the ineffective glasses she wore prevented her from being certain.</p><p>Harry's eyes lingered on an inscription beside the door, the cursive writing big enough that Harry didn't have to squint to read the words.</p><p align="center">
  <em> 'Enter stranger but take heed</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em> Of what awaits the sin of greed,</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em> For those who take, but do not earn,</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em> Must pay dearly in their turn,</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em> So if you seek beneath our floors</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em> A treasure that was never yours,</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em> Thief, you have been warned, beware</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em> Of finding more than treasure there.'</em>
</p><p>Standing beside this inscription, which to Harry sounded rather like a challenge than a warning, was a squat man with a pointed face, bushy arched eyebrows and a mischievous upturned nose. He wore a pressed uniform of scarlet with gold trim around the waist of the smart blazer and pressed trousers.    "A goblin," Hagrid clarified, "They're sneaky things, can be very vicious so stay on their good side, s'why yeh'd have to be mad to try an' rob this place." The goblin bowed as they passed, ushering them through the slowly opening doors and into a vast marble atrium, with pillars as wide as Hagrid was tall stretching up to support the ornately painted ceiling. Harry was reminded of pictures of the Vatican ceilings that one of her teachers had shown to her class after he'd returned from a trip to Italy.</p><p>Over a hundred goblins sat at a long line of desks that spanned most of the hall, the teller nearest to Harry was currently weighing out gleaming stones onto a set of golden scales, peering at them through small spectacles perched on his hooked nose. There were too many doors to even fathom counting, leading off into the unknown with people being ushered through them by more goblins. One family of three, all of them with light, almost white, blonde hair were being guided through one of the more decorated doors, with some kind of animal carved into the stone above the archway.</p><p>Hagrid led the way towards a free desk, the goblin in question using a brilliant red quill to scribble something down on the scroll in front of him. Hagrid cleared his throat to gain the goblin's attention. Griphook, as the gold plate in front declared him to be, leered down at Harry and Hagrid, pointed teeth jutting over his cracked bottom lip. Like Hagrid, Griphook had dark brown, nearly black eyes, but Griphook's were colder and gleamed with something sinister.</p><p>  "Goodmornin', we've come ter take some money out of Miss 'arriet Potter's account," Hagrid said, lowering his booming voice in an effort to not attract any attention from the Witches and Wizards milling around the bank. Not that Harry wasn't noticeable anyway with her flaming red hair and her visible eye a bright bottle-green that was particularly distinct. The lighting bolt scar striking across the hidden left side of her face, through her concealed left eye was also rather eye-catching though Harry did her best to ensure that it was rarely ever seen - her wild curls were an efficient screen from prying eyes.</p><p>"I trust you have her key," The goblin replied in a high, reedy voice; holding out a clawed hand expectantly. Hagrid promptly handed over a small silver key which was comically dwarfed by his great hands.   Griphook peered at the key through the gold-rimmed eyeglasses he held up to his face. "Everything appears to be in order," Griphook said with a contemptuous curl of his upper lip.</p><p>"Ah, an' I've also got a letter 'ere from Professor Dumbledore," Hagrid said, handing over a wrinkled, stained brown envelope that smelled suspiciously like a wet dog. "Its 'bout the You-Know-Wha' in vault seven hundred and thirteen." Griphook took the letter gingerly, holding it between the points of his long, claw-like nails.</p><p>"Very well," He said almost reluctantly, pushing his chair away from the desk "Follow me," Griphook snapped sharply as he hopped down from his seat, disappearing behind the oak desk before reappearing next to Hagrid so suddenly Harry couldn't help but flinch.</p><p>Griphook immediately set a swift pace towards the elaborately carved door that Harry had seen the family of blondes be ushered through by bowing goblins and she and Hagrid hurried to catch up, for someone with such small legs Griphook was incredibly speedy.</p><p>"What's the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen?" Harry whispered conspiritually at Hagrid, trying not to be overheard by the snappy goblin in front of them.</p><p>"Oh, I can't tell yer that 'arry, Dumbledore would have my 'ead," Hagrid replied, attempting to match the volume of Harry's whisper and failing quite spectacularly as his loud voice echoed around the cave that they had just entered. Harry just shrugged, dropping the subject, years with the Dursleys and Uncle Vernon's belt had instilled a general rule to never push for an answer, it had taken a lot of effort to even get the words to her original question out of her mouth.</p><p>Instead, Harry focused her attention on cave she was now in, having passed through the ornate doors as she was querying Hagrid. Like most of Gringotts, the cavern was vast and dimly lit by orange lanterns, the ceiling of the cave was nowhere in sight, obscured by mist and darkness. It was cool but not cold, and the air was dry, not damp and dingy like one might expect.</p><p>Glancing around, Harry could see carts positioned in front of various smaller caves, obviously leading further underground as the tracks suddenly dropped off into nothing. Harry felt her stomach rise into her throat as Griphook led them all over to a small cart that Harry was somewhat dubious about, how on earth would they all fit in with Hagrid's bulk?</p><p>Miraculously though, they all did, the inside of the cart feeling a lot bigger than its appearance would suggest. The wagon creaked ominously as it began rolling forwards. Harry felt herself relax slightly and before she knew it the cart tipped suddenly forwards and they dropped like a stone.</p>
