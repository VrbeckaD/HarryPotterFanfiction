    <p>Journal of Caliber Sirius Potter</p><p>This is my final year at Hogwarts. I have to say it's been fun. I'm Head Boy this year. Captain of the quidditch team again. Not to mention my title as the reigning sex god of Hogwarts. Yeah, that's pretty much my plan this year: Go to class and pretend to study, play quidditch, and have lots of sex. Anyway, there's only one thing I want to do when I graduate. I may be Head Boy but I haven't studied much and there's nothing I like doing besides playing quidditch. I've wanted to play professionally since I was three years old and I went to my mum’s first World Cup. If I don't make it though…Well, at least I have one hell of a trust fund.</p><p>XOXOXOXO</p><p>"Oh yes, yes! Don't stop!" The beautiful busty brunette lying on his bed moaned as Caliber continued to thrust into her, the pleasure becoming insurmountable. He flipped them over so that she was on top, riding every inch of him.</p><p>"Say my name" she moaned.</p><p>Oh yes, Cal thought to himself. Oh Merlin, wait- her name, what's so fucking sexy about a name anyway. It starts with a B or wait maybe it's a P, fuck, it could be a G or a D.</p><p>"Say it" she purred again, grinding her hips into Cal.</p><p>Cal ignored her request. He had made enough women orgasm that he was certain she was close and she would soon forget her own name. In one swift, skillful move she was on her back again and not a minute later, she was clenching and convulsing around Cal and soon he too came within her.</p><p>"That was, that was great" she breathed out, her ample chest still heaving as they lay completely nude in the cool white sheets, "so when will I see you again Cal" she murmured kissing Caliber's finely toned chest.</p><p>"Oh, you’re always welcome here Tara" he said smiling.</p><p>"Tara, my name's Serena!" she shrieked. </p><p>She jumped out his bed and gathered her clothes together before running out of the bedroom the door slamming behind her. Cal considered calling after her, but noted that he was in fact quite comfortable in his bed and didn't much feel like putting in the effort. Tara, he now realized, was the girl he had hooked up with last week. A glance at the clock on the nightstand told him that dinner wouldn't be served for another ten minutes, so he still had time to take a quick shower. He ran a hand through his messy black hair and grabbed a change of clothes, before heading into the bathroom of the Heads dormitory.</p><p>Caliber Sirius Potter took a look at himself in the mirror. With hazel eyes and messy black hair he was a dead ringer for the grandfather he had never met, James Potter; he had been told this nearly all his life. His tan sinewy shoulders were dusted with freckles as well as the bridge of his nose. The freckles, of course, came from his mother Ginny Potter née Weasley. The oldest of six, Caliber had started his seventh year as Hogwart's golden boy. He was Gryffindor's star quidditch player, hoping to go pro after graduation like his mother. He was an average student whose professors favorite comment on his assignments seemed to be "Apply Yourself". His parents were surprised when he was named Head Boy before the start of term, but when his mum had seen Headmistress Hestia Jones at the summer Board of Governors meeting, the headmistress had blushed like a schoolgirl and claimed Caliber had earned the position with his natural "leadership" skills. </p><p>Two weeks into the school year, all Caliber had managed to lead was a parade of upper class girls into his bed in the Heads dormitory. With one noticeable exception, of course. And ten minutes later as Cal walked down the stairs and into the Head tower’s common room, she stood there looking furious. Head Girl, Sophie Harlow; she was a petite girl with shiny brown hair and big sky blue eyes. But, what she lacked in an intimidating façade she more than made up for in demeanor. The Ravenclaw was certainly the most intense person Cal had ever met. </p><p>"How ya doin' Harlow? What's with the face? Did you score a nine out of ten on the transfiguration assignment or something?" Cal asked lightly.</p><p>"Transfiguration homework, oh that's good, Potter. Now tell me that sixth year that ran out of here crying, half-naked, I haven't seen her around. New bedding partner?" She asked accusatorially, arms crossed over her chest.</p><p>"New, old and everything in between" Cal said wryly.</p><p>"When did you pick her up?"</p><p>"Spotted her at lunch two days ago, had her in my bed by four this afternoon, not my personal record, but not bad. Anyway, I'm starved and already late for dinner and who knows who's expecting me" he said with a wink.</p><p>Sophie glared at him, as he walked out.</p><p>XOXOXOXO</p><p>Cal walked into the Great Hall and easily spotted his friends near the end of the long Gryffindor table.</p><p>"Where you been, man?" asked Fabian, Cal's best friend and cousin by his Uncle Ron and Aunt Hermione.</p><p>"I had something to do before dinner that's all" Cal said sitting down between Fabian and their friend Colin McCain.</p><p>"Something or someone?" asked his friend Jonah Pearlsteen giving him a knowing look while helping himself to some of Cal's pumpkin juice.</p><p>"I was going to drink that. It was a Hufflepuff sixth year, um, Serena Hamilton or something. Doesn't matter, she won't be back" Cal said pouring himself another glass of juice.</p><p>"What, didn't end well?" asked Colin biting into a roll.</p><p>"You know how sometimes I get girls mixed up when they have the same color hair two weeks in a row," Cal said, having the decency to look a bit embarrassed.</p><p>"You fucking idiot. You called her Tara, didn't you?" Fabian accused with a little smirk on his face</p><p>"Yeah, wait, what how do you remember her name and I don't?"</p><p>"Oh that Lexi Englehart in our Potions class is her best friend and let's just say Lexi and I are a little more than friendly. But hey, that girl Lacy O' Doyle you hooked up with after the Slytherin game last year. You think you could introduce me to that little blonde she's always hanging around with?"</p><p>"Mate, Colin's girl is coming this way" said Jonah looking up.<br/>

Immediately the four boys stopped talking as a pretty brunette sauntered over and sat on Colin's lap.</p><p>"Oh it's quiet suddenly. What, you three don't want me to hear the details on your latest sex-capades," teased Brigette Baccarat as she slipped her arms around Colin. Colin just kissed her.</p><p>"Potter, there you are, come with me we need to talk" commanded the strict voice of Headmistress Jones.</p><p>Cal didn't need to be told twice, he dropped a forkful of roast beef that was halfway to his mouth and stood up.</p><p>"Oh and Miss Baccarat, Mr. McCain, you know as well as I that anything of a pornographic nature is not permitted at Hogwarts. Separate yourselves." And with that the headmistress walked away briskly already halfway to the door before Cal even realized she was gone.</p><p>Once at her office Caliber saw family friend Oliver Wood lingering outside and he seemed to be waiting for them.</p><p>"Hey, Oliver what are you doing here?" Cal asked relieved that this is what Headmistress Jones was talking about. Instead of perhaps the party he had thrown in the head dormitories on Friday. It had been one of the wilder parties on record as Cal's sixth year brother Maxim had managed to smuggle in several crates of firewhiskey.</p><p>"Well, Potter, he is here to discuss your future. Sit. Wood, I'll leave you to it then" she commanded as she walked out the door.</p><p>Both Oliver and Caliber settled themselves into the formidable headmistress' office each taking a seat in two oversized velvet armchairs. Cal had always loved when Oliver came over to visit. Cal had grown up on the quidditch pitch, and his immediate manic love for the game bonded him with Oliver. Oliver was Cal's mentor, his idol. Cal figured his mum and dad were much too legendary for him to ever aspire to being alike.</p><p>"It's been 30 years since I graduated and walking in this office still scares the hell out of me", Oliver said smiling.</p><p>"I know what you mean. I've been in here once a week since I was a first year."</p><p>"From what Colette has told me it hasn't apparently scared you enough to stop getting into trouble". Oliver’s sixth year prefect daughter was also a chaser on the Gryffindor team.</p><p>"What kind of Potter would I be if it did?"</p><p>"You've got a point there. Now anyway, I love ya kid but I didn't come here just to discuss your detention record. As you know after my retirement from professional quidditch eight years ago I became an assistant coach of the England National Team as well as President of the Professional Quidditch Confederation of England. Now, this isn't usually part of my job but- what, why are you laughing?"</p><p>"I'm s- sorry, but this is hilarious, did you practice this?" Cal gasped out shaking with laughter</p><p>"Um, excuse me kid, but I'm trying to be professional." Oliver said looking at Cal pointedly. Then after a beat adding, "Was it alright though? I have to make this speech a few more times while Calleigh Thatcher, the national team recruitment officer is on maternity leave.</p><p>"Oliver, I'm sorry, but cut the shite there's no way I can take you seriously after your karaoke bit at the League Cup after party last year. On the quidditch field sure, but business-wise I don't think so."</p><p>"You better learn to listen to me out on the field because I can easily see you being a key player on the international level in a couple of years. And that is something I'm not going to tell every recruit." Oliver said seriously</p><p>"Wait, you’re recruiting me?!" Cal exclaimed, eyes wide, he sat perched on the edge of his seat in excitement.</p><p>"Yes, several of the quidditch clubs would like to make offers. The Holyhead Harpies are considering allowing men. They’re frothing at the mouth at getting another Potter on the team. But Puddlemere United is making a really strong push offering one of the biggest rookie salaries on record, if not the biggest."</p><p>"How big?"</p><p>"20 million galleons over three years, plus a signing bonus, but that's nothing compared to what you'll be making in endorsement deals. Firebolt, Nimbus, Quality Quidditch Supplies, Broom Juice sports drinks, even Gulliver's Body Wash wants to pay you to shower with their soap post game or at least pretend you do for millions of dollars."</p><p>"Bloody hell!" Cal let out a breath he didn't realize he had been holding and sunk back into the velvet armchair.<br/>

Caliber was no stranger to money. He had grown up in a large country manor with a personal house-elf at his every beck and call. Every childhood fantasy he could dream of had pretty much been fulfilled. But playing professional quidditch meant more to Caliber than any other dream he could have possibly had. After seventeen years of being Harry and Ginny Potter's oldest son who happened to be a very good quidditch player; Cal would become a wealthy star quidditch player who maybe happened to be Harry and Ginny Potter's son.</p><p>"Now I hate to have to bring you down to earth again so suddenly, but it's quite a bit more complex than it might seem to go pro. There are agents to discuss, contracts to negotiate, and the pressure is on. At this Saturday's match several recruiters from clubs all over the country, and even in international leagues, will be there to watch a few different players, but mainly you."</p><p>Cal's face noticeably paled at this new bit of information. "But this Saturday is the first match of the year. Not to mention. we only just had tryouts for the new members. We lost five starters last year. The team is still so new, talented sure, but really young. I half expect our new keeper to pass out from nerves."</p><p>"Well, you're the captain, right? It's the perfect opportunity to see what your leadership skills are like then, isn't it?" Oliver said standing and checking his watch. "I've got to go, I have a meeting with your Uncle Ron regarding the World Cup. I wouldn't worry too much I've seen you play and even on an off day you're a hell of a lot better than anybody else out there."</p><p>"Give Uncle Ron my regards then," Cal said standing and shaking Oliver's hand. His Uncle Ron was the Ministry Head of Magical Games and Sports and the World Cup was coming back to England next year.</p><p>"Will do. See ya, kid.”</p>
