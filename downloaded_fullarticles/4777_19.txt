    <p>"Ho, 
Millennium Falcon," I say, coming into the rec room. "I got 
a present for you that I made." I set it on the table.</p><p>"What 
is it?" Falcon says, examining the ornate, glowing cube.</p><p>"This, 
is a Jedi holocron," I say. "I promised you schematics, 
didn't I? It also contains a bunch of stories, too. Here, try it out, 
just touch it, right here."</p><p>Falcon 
presses his fingers where I indicate, and a holographic projection of 
my face appears above the cube.</p><p>"I am Stormseeker Interactive Holocron 1," the image says. "Enter your query."</p><p>"Access 
schematics," I tell myself. "Display, T3-M4."</p><p>"Voice 
imprint recognized," my projection says. "Welcome, 
Stormseeker. Searching. Data found. Displaying."</p><p>The 
image changes to a detailed representation of a utility droid 
design.</p><p>Falcon 
raises an eyebrow. "Nice. Holocron, list schematic files."</p><p>"Voice 
imprint unrecognized," the holocron says, switching back to the 
head image. "New user. Input username and passcode."</p><p>"Username, 
Millennium Falcon," he says, then looks to me.</p><p>"Passcode: 
There is no temptation, there is only choice," I say.</p><p>"Acknowledged," 
the holocron says. "Accessing data."</p><p>A 
list of file names appears above the cube. I put in everything I 
could think of into the data cube. Lightsabers, blasters, droids, 
even spaceships. I don't have the time or resources to construct most 
of this stuff, never mind that most of it isn't useful to me right 
now, but the Glass Walkers are another story.</p><p>"Display 
schematic, Ebon Hawk," 
Falcon says.</p><p>The 
image of my face is replaced by that of my ship, my former ship maybe 
I should say, left behind on a planet a long time ago in a galaxy 
far, far away.</p><p>"Zoom 
in on drive section," Falcon says.</p><p>The 
section of the ship enlarges, showing labeled components of the 
hyperdrive. Falcon looks at it intently, gauging it.</p><p>"This 
is real?" Falcon says. "This technology actually works?"</p><p>"Absolutely," 
I say, patting my lightsaber hanging from my belt.</p><p>"Huh," 
Falcon says. "I guess you really are from the future."</p><p>I 
chuckle. "Did you doubt me?"</p><p>"It's 
one thing abstractly accepting time travel weirdness," Falcon 
says. "It's another thing entirely seeing something like, this." 
He waves a hand at the display.</p><p>"Lucky 
for you, I was quite the engineer in the future," I say with a 
grin. "I had to reconstruct these schematics from memory, and my 
memory has been a chancy thing at times. I might have had to fill in 
some gaps off of new design because I couldn't remember exactly what 
was used, and replaced a few components with ones that should work 
with currently available resources."</p><p>Meditation 
exercises and being able to look things over in a Pensieve certainly 
didn't hurt, either.</p><p>"Was 
this your ship?" Falcon asks.</p><p>I 
nod. "Knew her like the back of my hand. Well. Not my ship, my 
ship. I didn't build it. Just kind of, stole it from some crime boss. 
Accidentally smuggled some drugs with it too, since it apparently 
came with a secret cargo space I didn't know about." I snicker. 
"Went over it with a fine-toothed comb after that, though, once 
I had a chance and people weren't trying to kill me. Was quite the 
adventure there for a while."</p><p>"Sounds 
like it," Falcon says.</p><p>"So, 
hey, presents aside, this wasn't the only reason I came over here," 
I say, reaching over to deactivate the holocron. "Your 
organization. Tribe. How does one join?"</p><p>"So 
you want to be a Glass Walker," Falcon says, chuckling. "I 
have to admit, I've never run across a case quite like yours before. 
I'm convinced that you must have been a Glass Walker at some point, 
and if not, you should have been. You're not a cub anymore, and yet 
you are. You haven't completely made your First Change yet, and yet 
you have. And your pack is the most eclectic mix I have ever seen 
happily working together that I'm almost surprised you don't have a 
token vampire in there for good measure. A Garou, an elf, a wraith, 
an Animagus, some wizards, and you. Whatever you really are."</p><p>"That's 
my life for you," I say. "Nothing if not complicated."</p><p>Falcon 
snickers. "So I see. Normally, I'd send a cub off on a Rite of 
Passage to earn their place in the tribe and Garou society. I'd give 
them some minor problem to solve, a basic test of some sort, 
something well within their capabilities. You're well past all of 
that and it would be nothing more than a formality. I watched you 
program a storm, hunt down fomori, rescue innocents, face down Black 
Spiral Dancers, and destroy an artifact to prevent it from falling 
into the clutches of the Wyrm."</p><p>"I'm 
not taking any glory for any of that shit," I say. "It was 
my own mistake that it happened at all."</p><p>"Too 
late," Falcon says with a smirk. "You weren't the one who 
called in the Black Spiral Dancers there. And you didn't have to 
stand your ground and stop them, either. But you did. And you've 
gotten recognition for that whether you want it or not."</p><p>I 
grunt. "Fine. So what about this Rite of Passage?"</p><p>"I 
can't send you on a Rite of Passage," Falcon says. "Not 
with all this time travel weirdness, as you call it. I can't 
determine whether you were or weren't a member of the tribe in some 
alternate timeline, and regardless, it's not up for me to decide. I 
can, however, suggest you seek recognition from the tribe's totem."</p><p>"The 
totem?" I ask.</p><p>"The 
patron spirit of the Glass Walkers," Falcon says. "Cockroach."</p><p>"Cockroach?" 
I repeat, raising an eyebrow. "Alright, how?"</p><p>"Do 
you know how to step sideways?" Falcon asks. "Or remember? 
Whichever."</p><p>"Step 
sideways?" I wonder. "Maybe I should ask for a lexicon of 
terminology next..."</p><p>Falcon 
chuckles. "By which I mean, to enter the Umbra."</p><p>"Oh," 
I say. "Hmm." I think back. "I might." I work up 
my face. "This might sound strange. I vaguely remember at one 
point that I made a deal with a spirit, Mouse, to teach me about the 
Umbra."</p><p>"Not 
strange at all," Falcon says. "That's how shapeshifters 
learn many of their Gifts. So what did Mouse teach you?"</p><p>"Among 
other things?" I say, then grin. "How to slip through the 
little holes in the world to get into and out of places..."</p><p>I 
pick apart the memories running through my head. I know I must have 
known how to Apparate at one point, but this isn't quite the same 
thing. Is it really all that different, though, when you get down to 
the basics of it? Apparation is going from one place to another 
place, but what if that other place is right on top of you, 
effectively?</p><p>Fragments 
of memory slip through my fingers. I can't quite piece it together. I 
need to find Mouse again. But just because I can't remember it 
entirely doesn't mean I can't still figure it out. The Veil is so 
thin here one might slip across with just a thought...</p><p>The 
world doesn't really so much shift as that the air feels different, 
prickling the hair on my arms. Nothing else seems different, so for a 
moment I don't think I actually did anything, until I see Falcon 
grinning at me.</p><p>"It's 
something every shapeshifter can do," Falcon says. "Most 
breeds wouldn't even need it to be taught to them by a spirit. As 
shapeshifters, we always already have one foot on each side."</p><p>"Or 
two paws?" I add wryly.</p><p>Falcon 
chuckles. "So to speak." He tilts his head at the hallway. 
"You'll have to make this trip yourself."</p><p>I 
look over to the hallway, but now that I look at it more closely, it 
doesn't really seem like the hallway that was on the other side of 
the Veil. As I turn to walk, out of the corners of my eyes, wisps of 
lines appear, like circuits, like wires. The further I go down the 
hallway, the further away from the real world it seems I get.</p><p>My 
surroundings fade a metallic hallway covered in green lines 
zigzagging about at right angles. Small metallic spiders skitter 
about, frenetically working on one inscrutable task or another. 
Doorways and intersections lead off at different points, and I think 
I could quickly become lost in a digital labyrinth like this.</p><p>I 
know what I'm looking for, though. And if there's one thing I know, 
it's computers. The systems I'd seen on this planet are primitive 
compared to what I'm used to, not surprising from a society that has 
yet to develop interstellar travel. What I gave to Falcon alone 
should be enough to catapult the Glass Walkers into the next 
millennium.</p><p>So I 
follow the lines, just like I'm slicing into a computer. I might as 
well be. It certainly feels like it. I've never felt like I could be 
so literally inside a computer system before. And it is <i>awesome</i>. 
Programs unfold around me like blossoming flowers built of sparkling 
digits. Processes flow like 
rivers of light. Metallic spider-like creatures of all shapes and 
sizes scurry around. One such weaverling the size of a Muggle 
automobile stops and takes a long look at me through large, 
glowing eyes before moving on.</p><p>I'm 
in the spirit world. I'm surrounded by spirits. These aren't real 
machines or real creatures, but spirits of order. And for the most 
part, they don't actually care about me. They're busy.</p><p>It 
would be hard to imagine that many shapeshifters who aren't Glass 
Walkers would come to this part of the Ethereal Plane. They wouldn't 
even be able to interpret what they're seeing. 
Not that that's saying much. 
I'd probably be just as lost in some mystical forest that they'd 
feel right at home in.</p><p>A 
black door opens into a room, 
a node, humming with energy, buzzing with activity, 
lit up like a Yule tree. This 
is <i>my</i> mystical forest. 
This is where <i>I</i> feel 
at home.</p><p>"<i>So 
you are here</i>."</p><p>A 
voice, calm, soft, almost feminine, from no discernible location. It 
takes me a moment to register that the words weren't spoken in 
English, but in <i>elven</i>. 
<i>Akaya hey, </i>a 
traditional greeting I haven't heard since Torn Elkandu. 
Is there someone else from Torn Elkandu here, or is that merely my 
perception?</p><p>I 
clear my throat. "Greetings."</p><p>Weaverlings 
scurry around me, some of them moving out of the way or adjusting 
their paths and making slightly annoyed clicks 
and whistles at being 
inconvenienced by my presence. 
They almost sound like utility droids. 
One of them comes up to me, carrying a box twice its size, and bloops 
indignantly at my feet.</p><p>"Ah, 
I'm in your way, sorry," I say, 
stepping aside.</p><p>The 
little weaverling makes two short bloops in thanks or acknowledgment 
and goes on.</p><p>"<i>Stormseeker</i>," 
intones the voice. "<i>Timewalker. Fateweaver. 
Doombreaker</i>."</p><p>Fuck, 
like I need any <i>more</i> 
pretentious titles? I thought I was full up on them.</p><p>"You 
know who I am," I say.</p><p>"<i>Yes</i>."</p><p>"Who 
are you?" I ask.</p><p>I 
have the distinct feeling of being watched. A rather silly thing to 
be feeling considering that there are weaverlings all around me who 
are, for the most part, cheerfully ignoring me rather than watching 
me. But I can't tell where 
the voice is coming from.</p><p>"<i>I 
am the one who thrives where others cannot survive</i><i>. </i><i>The 
one who is never noticed but is everywhere</i>."</p><p>"Cockroach?" 
I say. "It's not much of a riddle if I knew the answer 
beforehand."</p><p>A 
sound like faint laughter falls through the air, and one small 
luminous insect emerges from a wall. "Yes, challenge-response 
authentication only works if each party knows what they're expecting 
already."</p><p>"Complicated 
passcodes can be easy to forget," I say.</p><p>"I 
recommend using a dedicated weaverling as a password manager," 
Cockroach suggests.</p><p>"Wouldn't 
that also have security issues?" I ask. 
"Couldn't it be subverted?"</p><p>"If 
it were connected directly to you, it would be very difficult to do 
so," Cockroach replies.</p><p>"I'll 
take that into consideration," I say. 
"However, would it be capable of traveling across time and space 
readily? It's simple when time only goes in one direction, and not 
backwards or sideways. Sideways is the most confusing sort."</p><p>Cockroach 
titters in amusement. "If 
set up properly, perhaps. You 
just step sideways a little further than most shapeshifters."</p><p>I 
pause. "You know who I am," I say again. "You greeted 
me in the local elven dialect from where I grew up."</p><p>"Are 
you surprised? What were you expecting?"</p><p>"I'm 
not really sure," I admit. 
"I try not to, generally. 
Expectations can lead to trouble."</p><p>"But 
you expect nonetheless," Cockroach says.</p><p>"I 
suppose that's inevitable, " I say.</p><p>"Were 
you expecting the worst?" Cockroach asks. "Did you prepare 
for it?"</p><p>"Not 
really," I say. "I mean, I'm kind of hard to kill and I've 
got so many backups and contingencies that I'm sure I could have 
recovered even if I couldn't have possibly predicted what might 
happen."</p><p>Cockroach 
clicks in appreciation. "Yes. Exactly. I like you. 
You can't trust what you expect. You can't expect everything. You 
can't rely on deep planning or trying to outsmart yourself. You just 
have to be prepared to survive no matter what happens."</p><p>"I 
guess that kind of makes me a time-traveling cockroach, so to speak," 
I say with a smirk.</p><p>"Quite 
so," Cockroach replies. "Now, you sought me out 
deliberately. What would you ask of me?"</p><p>"I 
was looking to join the Glass Walkers," I say. "Millennium 
Falcon mentioned something about a Rite of Passage, but–"</p><p>"Rites 
of Passage are for cubs who haven't proven themselves yet," 
Cockroach interrupts. "You're no cub, 
and you've nothing to prove. If 
you want, you're in. Is that 
really all you sought? My blessing in that? Not to learn any Gifts or 
bargain for knowledge?"</p><p>I 
bite my lower lip. "You would teach me?"</p><p>"Of 
course," Cockroach says. 
"And since you're now a brand new Glass Walker – possibly 
not for the first time, but let’s not dwell on that – you 
even get a freebie.”</p><p>“I’m 
never one to argue with knowledge,” I say. “Especially if 
there’s no cost attached. What can you teach me?”</p><p>“Hmm. 
Let me teach you how to interact with the spirits of machines. They 
can help you to find out what’s wrong and assist in repairs.”</p><p>“That 
sounds <i>really</i> useful,” 
I say.</p><p>“I 
thought you might say that.” Cockroach 
ticks cheerfully.</p><p>I 
pause. That was the thinking 
of the Force user on the spaceship. “But what if I wind up 
somewhere more primitive again?”</p><p>“The 
spirits of a cannon or a water wheel are just as valid as those of an 
engine or computer. And I 
expect that wherever you wind up, you will adapt and survive.”</p><p>“Alright. 
True. Thank you.” I 
pause again. “I <i>am</i> 
a shapeshifter, aren’t I?”</p><p>Cockroach 
scoffs. “Of course you are. Not a sort that normally joins my 
Tribe, but definitely a shapeshifter either way.”</p><p>“What 
sort is that?” I ask.</p><p>“Give 
you a hint,” Cockroach says in some amusement. “It has 
wings.”</p><p>“A 
duck?” I guess.</p><p>Cockroach 
outright laughs at that. “Fine, fine, I won’t beat around 
the bush. You’re a dragon.”</p><p>“A 
dragon,” I repeat.</p><p>“I 
think you already knew that, though.”</p><p>“Heir 
of the Children of the Dragon’s Blood,” I say. “Yeah, 
when you put it like that, it was pretty obvious.”</p><p>“Haven’t 
seen many of your kind still around, and none of them out in my 
little corner of the Umbra,” Cockroach says. “They’re 
dying out because they can’t adapt. Most 
of them can’t even change form anymore. I 
haven’t seen a dragon shifter in an age. 
You’re lucky to have been born homid. Quick 
lifespans and endless adaptability.”</p><p>“Like 
cockroaches,” I say wryly.</p><p>Cockroach 
shows me how to detect and contact the spirits of objects, 
a simple task once it has been pointed out, or really more of a Gift 
I suppose. I make 
my way out of the Umbra and return to Millennium Falcon, still 
somewhat awestruck by what I’ve seen and learned.</p><p>He 
looks up at me expectantly, but breaks out into a grin when he sees 
the look on my face. “I take it it went well?”</p><p>“She 
says I’m in,” I say. “Also, 
she taught me a Gift.”</p><p>“She?” 
Falcon says.</p><p>“I 
didn’t take a close look and I wouldn’t be able to tell 
the sex of a cockroach anyway, and I don’t think it even 
<i>matters</i> all that much 
for spirits, but it <i>sounded</i> 
feminine.”</p><p>Falcon 
chuckles. “Well, either way, congratulations. The 
recognition of the spirits matters. Will 
you still be staying with Buried Cable Sept, or did you plan to move 
to London?”</p><p>“I’ll 
still be at Cardiff for a while yet,” I say. “I have some 
unfinished business to take care of. Then, I’ve got some 
business in the States. I’m not sure how long that will be. 
Knowing me, both far too long and not long enough. That’s about 
the way things go sometimes.”</p><p>“Yeah, 
I don’t blame you for wanting to get out of the country for a 
while,” Falcon says. “I can get you in touch with the 
local Tribe wherever you wind up. If you’re hunting Jez’kai, 
they may be able to help in some way.”</p><p>I 
give a nod. “Thanks.”</p><p><br/>
</p>
<hr/><p>The 
wards of Caer Danas alert me to cursebreakers trying to make their 
way in. Expectations aside, I didn’t expect to be able to make 
it to Beltane without interruption. I 
cast aside the book I was reading without a second thought, and cast 
a quick spell to amplify my voice.</p><p>“Everyone 
up!” I call out, leaping to my feet. “Take position. We 
are under attack.”</p><p>Remus 
and Gellert leap up from the couch.</p><p>“Who 
is it?” Sirius wonders, pulling out his wand along with the 
others.</p><p>I 
snort softly. “You mean which of the several groups that we’ve 
pissed off has bothered to show up at our doorstep even though we 
haven’t really been keeping quiet about still being here?”</p><p>Remus 
peers out the front window. “Aurors, from the look of it.”</p><p>“More 
likely to be able to be reasoned with than Black Spiral Dancers, at 
least,” I say.</p><p>“Even 
considering their corruption and demon summoning?” Sirius asks.</p><p>“They 
couldn’t <i>all</i> 
have been complicit to that,” I say.</p><p>“Guess 
not,” Sirius admits. “Is 
it wise to let them know we’re actually here, though?”</p><p>“We’re 
going to fight,” I say. “This is our house. I won’t 
let them take it.”</p><p>“Right 
then,” Sirius says. “Standing our ground it is.”</p><p>“And 
if met with overwhelming force, we shall go back in time and then 
evacuate,” I say lightly.</p><p>“I’m 
still getting used to the idea of this whole ‘immortality’ 
thing,” Sirius says wryly. “Are 
you always so flippant about it?”</p><p>“Now 
that I know you all will be safe and not dying horrible deaths?” 
I say. “Yes.”</p><p>“That’s 
reassuring,” Sirius says.</p><p>“<i>Expecto 
Patronum</i>,” I cast. The 
dragon spirit emerges from my wand, and I nod to her. “Please 
tell the people sieging my castle, I don’t want to have to kill 
them. I will parley, but <i>not</i> 
surrender. They may back off 
and send <i>one</i> 
representative to the gate. I 
will come out and meet them.”</p><p>The 
dragon Patronus nods and flies out across the grounds.</p><p>“Be 
on alert,” I turn to 
tell the others. “I’m 
going to speak with them. Cover me.”</p><p>I 
head outside. The wards let 
me know that the attempts at breaking them have paused for the time 
being. A dark-skinned man has 
approached the gate, wearing robes that remind me more of a Jedi than 
a wizard who might have gone to Hogwarts. He 
holds a wand at his side, ready but not pointing directly at me.</p><p>“Darth 
Revan?” the Auror asks.</p><p>I 
nod to him. “That’s me. And you?”</p><p>“Kingsley 
Shacklebolt. I’m here to place you under arrest–”</p><p>I 
hold up a hand and interrupt him. “Are you aware that Moody is 
possessed?”</p><p>Kingsley 
pauses. “That’s a serious accusation. Do you have 
evidence?”</p><p>I 
reach out with my senses to try to get an assessment of the man in 
front of me. A feel of the Force around him, his <i>smell</i> 
in a manner of speaking. But I sense nothing of the Dark Side in him. 
He may be misinformed or misguided, but he’s not corrupted. Not 
in that sense of the term.</p><p>“There 
were others who encountered him and can corroborate that,” I 
say. “They’re werewolves, though, so I’m not sure 
how much store you’d put in their words.”</p><p>“I’ll 
take that under advisement,” Kingsley says. “Do you claim 
that <i>he</i> is the one who 
destroyed the Ministry of Magic, and not you?”</p><p>I 
shake my head. “No. That was me. It was an accident, but it was 
me.”</p><p>“An 
accident,” Kingsley repeats, then sighs. “An 
accident that conveniently occurred immediately following your 
threats?”</p><p>“I 
didn’t say I intended nothing,” I say with a smirk. “Just 
that what actually happened was unintentional. I didn’t mean 
for a huge magical storm to destroy central London.”</p><p>“Regardless 
of the scale of what you intended, you need to pay for your crimes,” 
Kingsley says.</p><p>“What 
do you want of me?” I ask.</p><p>“I 
want you to come along quietly,” Kingsley says. “My team 
will stand down and we won’t damage the house or harm anyone 
else inside of it. We can hold a makeshift trial with what’s 
left of the Ministry, but you don’t deny your actions. You need 
to go to Azkaban for this.”</p><p>“No,” 
I say flatly. “And do you really think Azkaban would hold me, 
after I broke everyone out of there?”</p><p>Kingsley 
pauses. “We may need to rethink our criminal justice system.”</p><p>“You 
don’t say.”</p><p>“Regardless, 
you need to answer for your crimes,” Kingsley says. “You 
cannot simply do whatever you want without repercussions.”</p><p>“Yeah,” 
I say. “It would be so easy to avoid repercussions, you know. 
To avoid consequences. A snap of my fingers, and I’m in another 
country, another world, another time, another universe, and no one 
there will know what happened here. And you’d be standing there 
looking at an empty house without anyone that could make amends for 
his mistakes.”</p><p>“Do 
you intend to try to escape?” Kingsley demands.</p><p>I 
shake my head. “Not at this moment. You know, prison is really 
counterproductive. The only purpose it serves is in preventing the 
prisoners from harming anyone else so long as they’re inside. 
It doesn’t actually fix anything that they might have done, nor 
does it change them to be better people who wouldn’t have 
committed those crimes. It probably is more likely to make them worse 
people than better, especially that prison of yours staffed by 
soul-sucking monsters of doom.”</p><p>“I 
don’t like them, but I know they <i>are</i> 
effective at keeping the worst of the worst out of the general 
populace,” Kingsley says.</p><p>“It’s 
good that you think so,” I say a 
little wearily. “I’d 
really rather not have to kill you. I have the blood of too many 
innocents on my hands already.”</p><p>“You 
think you could win?” Kingsley says. “I’ve got the 
best Aurors still alive backing me up here, minus Moody.”</p><p>“Is 
there some compromise we could make?” I ask. “Is there 
something you’d ask of me that <i>doesn’t</i> 
involve being locked up anywhere, with or without the soul-sucking 
monsters of doom?”</p><p>“You 
can’t just submit a plea bargain and ask for community service 
in exchange for <i>mass murder</i>,” 
Kingsley says.</p><p>“Did 
you see the Black Spiral Dancers attack the place?” I ask.</p><p>“Yeah, 
I can’t believe you’re working with that scum, either,” 
Kingsley says.</p><p>“Working 
with?” I say in startlement. “Absolutely not. I was 
<i>fighting</i> them. I 
<i>stopped</i> them. You 
didn’t really think <i>I</i> 
brought them in, did you?”</p><p>Kingsley 
frowns. “You <i>oppose</i> 
the Black Spiral Dancers? But you broke out all the former Death 
Eaters from prison.”</p><p>“You 
know, there’s more than one group of assholes running around,” 
I say. “It would be so much simpler if ‘evil’ were 
some monolithic entity and not a bunch of squabbling factions of 
varying degrees and flavors of evilness. For 
what it’s worth, I was hoping that any of those former Death 
Eaters who were too dumb to live would get themselves eaten by 
werewolves.”</p><p>“So 
you admit that you’re evil, too?” Kingsley says.</p><p>“I’m 
really not going to squabble over definitions of morality,” I 
say. “I’m sure you find some of my views to be 
reprehensible, just as I find some of yours to be. It doesn’t 
matter. What matters is what actually happened, and what each of us 
is going to do from here on out.”</p><p>“I 
take it you still won’t come quietly,” Kingsley observes.</p><p>“Not 
a chance,” I say with a ghost of a grin. “It 
seems we’ve reached an impasse. Will it be war, then? Or shall 
we settle this in a duel, and not make a mess of things and drag 
others into it where 
permanent damage could be dealt on either side.”</p><p>“You 
would abide by the results of such a duel?” Kingsley asks.</p><p>“Of 
course,” I say. “I can’t speak for anyone else, 
though. But if I cannot earn my victory through my own skill and 
strength, then I do not deserve it.”</p><p>Kingsley 
looks at me for a long moment, before nodding tersely. He holds up 
his hand in a staying gesture toward the other Aurors who are holding 
position on the perimeter, and I do likewise toward my friends inside 
the house.</p><p>“Wands, 
then?” Kingsley says.</p><p>“As 
the one challenged, I have the privilege of choosing my weapons, 
don’t I?” I ask.</p><p>“This 
is true,” Kingsley says. “You do not wish to use wands, 
then?”</p><p>“Swords,” 
I reply flatly. “And to make things fair, I will use a standard 
metal sword 
and not my magic light blade, since you do not have one.”</p><p>“You’re 
serious about this,” Kingsley says. “Formal duel it is, 
then. I know my way around a 
blade.”</p><p>So 
we call out seconds, and see 
about obtaining 
suitable weapons. An uneasy 
truce settles over the grounds while we make arrangements. Dobby 
brings out refreshments. The Aurors won’t touch them, although 
they look wistfully toward the cool glasses of lemonade and 
the tiny cucumber sandwiches.</p><p>“I 
hate to resort to this, but with all other government and justice 
systems having broken down, the only other alternative is outright 
warfare,” Kingsley says.</p><p>Rispy 
brings out a pair of swords. “Here you go. Two swords, 
well-crafted and unenchanted.”</p><p>“Do 
you keep an arsenal around just in case?” I ask.</p><p>“Absolutely,” 
Rispy says. “You should 
see my collection of crossbows.”</p><p>The 
Auror that Kingsley has chosen as his second is a pale, middle-aged 
man by the name of Dawlish. 
He waves a wand over them, 
then nods to Kingsley. “No magic on them, no fault or defect 
that I can detect.”</p><p>“Let 
us agree on the stakes,” I say. “If I should win, I will 
not harm you anymore than may be necessary, and you and your team are 
free to go, but you and yours 
will not harm me or mine nor 
interfere with our business. 
As our business does not 
involve <i>intentionally</i> 
fucking over the world, that should not be too 
reprehensible to you.”</p><p>“If 
I win, you will go to Azkaban,” Kingsley says.</p><p>I 
narrow my eyes at him. “You cannot ask that of me.”</p><p>“I’m 
asking it,” Kingsley says. “Are you backing out now?”</p><p>Rage 
bubbles up through me, narrowly held in check by willpower. “Don’t 
ask that of me. I will agree to <i>anything</i> 
else within reason, but don’t ask me to go to Azkaban.”</p><p>Rispy 
puts in, “I can’t guarantee your safety if you insist on 
imprisonment for him.”</p><p>“You 
can’t guarantee <i>my</i> 
safety?” Kingsley asks.</p><p>“I 
can’t guarantee that he’d 
be able to hold back and keep this from turning into a war,” 
Rispy says.</p><p>Kingsley’s 
eyes fall upon my clenched fists. “You’re 
that terrified of the place. As 
well you should be.”</p><p>“That 
place is a fucking <i>nightmare</i> 
that I would not wish upon my worst enemy,” I growl. 
“I would rather die. And 
that would entirely defeat the point of the exercise.”</p><p>“Then 
you’ll just have to win, then, won’t you,” Kingsley 
retorts.</p><p>I 
take a deep breath. <i>Through 
rage, I seek justice.</i> “I’ll 
warn you one more time. If you are going to ask Azkaban of me, then 
this will be a duel to the death, yours or mine. And I implore you, 
for the sake of both of our lives, <i>ask something else</i>.”</p><p>Kingsley 
gives me a long, considering look, and I have to wonder if he’s 
going to back down or not, but Dawlish 
clears his throat and pins him with a gaze.</p><p>“He 
isn’t asking much of us,” Dawlish says. “He would 
be well within his rights to have countered with the demand that <i>we</i> 
go to Azkaban. He hasn’t 
asked that.”</p><p>“You 
really think he can win?” Kingsley asks.</p><p>Dawlish 
openly stares at him. “You have to consider the possibility.”</p><p>Rispy 
sighs. “Look. Just tell us to bugger off or something. 
Restitution or exile.”</p><p>“I 
strongly agree with that recommendation,” Dawlish says.</p><p>Kingsley 
eventually settles on, “Fine. Exile. If I win, you and yours 
are never to set foot in the British Isles again, and 
will leave by the end of the month.”</p><p>“Acceptable,” 
I say, calming. I 
take my sheathed blade in both hands, bow my head and close my eyes. 
“Through sorrow, I seek hope. Through rage, I seek justice. 
Through truth, I seek love. Through sorrow, I seek hope. Through 
life, I seek freedom.”</p><p>The 
mantra helps me to focus and control my emotions rather than letting 
them get the better of me. When 
I open my eyes again, Kingsley is standing across from me with his 
own sword.</p><p>“Are 
we ready to begin?” Rispy asks.</p><p>I 
nod tersely.</p><p>“I 
am,” Kingsley says. “May the best wizard win.”</p><p>We 
bow to one another and draw our weapons. The formalities taken care 
of, the world falls away and fades from my vision as I focus solely 
upon the duel. I wouldn’t 
generally have thought it a fair fight, no matter that he says he’s 
skilled with the blade, but this sword is heavier than I’m used 
to and I don’t have the 
size or muscle mass that I’m used to, either. 
Lightsabers weigh almost 
nothing, and this is no 
fencing foil, either.</p><p>I 
fall into Soresu form, 
focusing primarily upon defense as I get a feel for his skill and 
style, countering or evading 
his own testing attacks. He 
wasn’t exaggerating. He <i>does</i> 
seem to know what he’s doing, at least. It would be foolish to 
underestimate an unknown opponent, to scoff at them and be unable to 
imagine that they could possibly come close to a Jedi Master I’d 
fought once. I’m not on 
Dantooine, and this is no Jedi. I don’t know what he’s 
capable of.</p><p>“Left-handed, 
huh,” Kingsley says. “Don’t think it’ll give 
you any advantage. I’ve gone up against a few lefties in my 
day.”</p><p>I 
say nothing. Words are a weapon just as much as a blade, and they can 
be a shield or a distraction. Kingsley 
slowly begins to grow frustrated with his inability to get through my 
defenses.</p><p>“Are 
you going to fight, or just block everything I send at you?” 
Kingsley wonders.</p><p>“I’ll 
fight when I’m good and ready,” I say with a grin.</p><p>“You’re 
not going to wear me out, you know,” Kingsley says. “I’m 
in prime health and whatever you might be inside, you’ve got 
the body of a child.”</p><p>He 
makes quick, precise strikes, trying to find any hole in my form to 
take advantage of. I block out everything else and let the Force 
guide my actions, let me sense where he might be about to strike 
next. The key to winning any fight is to know where your opponent’s 
blade will be before it’s there.</p><p>Kingsley 
overextends himself. In the middle of a strike, I shift suddenly into 
Juyo form, in one smooth motion going from all defense to wild, rapid 
attack. Kingsley recovers 
quickly, however, as if he’d been expecting that.</p><p>Something 
occurs to me. Aurors are wizards. They’ve been trained to fight 
<i>with magic</i>. That need 
not be solely restricted to wands. After all, there’s potions 
and any number of magic items as well. I don’t know what Auror 
training involves, but Kingsley’s reflexes remind me more of a 
Jedi than anything else.</p><p>I 
almost laugh aloud at the sheer joy of the fight. Juyo form is all 
passion and energy, something the Jedi tended to shy away from. You 
have to thrill in battle, and I’m enjoying a good fight here. 
It has been a while since I was challenged by a complete unknown like 
this. Dueling with blades 
seems somehow more pure than the harrowing all-out bloodthirsty war 
the Black Spiral Dancers bring.</p><p>Kingsley 
isn’t talking or taunting now. We dance. His 
advantage lies less in his skill and more in that he’s using 
styles I’m unfamiliar with. When going up against any Jedi or 
Sith, I know all their moves already because I’ve also learned 
all their forms. Dueling Club has not at all prepared me for this. 
But I wouldn’t be Darth 
Revan if I couldn’t learn and adapt.</p><p>In 
one blink of the mind’s eye, I see where his weapon will be, 
sense his next move, and I’m there first. With one swift 
strike, I knock the weapon out of his hands and send it falling to 
embed itself in the soft ground ten feet away.</p><p>I 
step forward and hold the tip of my blade to his throat for one 
moment. “You are beaten. Yield.”</p><p>Kingsley 
glances aside to where his sword fell, it having happened so quickly 
he hadn’t quite registered that the fight was over, before 
raising his hands. “I yield. You win.”</p><p>I 
nod, and lower my sword. “As 
promised, you and yours will be allowed to leave here unharmed.”</p><p>The 
other Aurors look about themselves, and one of them says quietly to 
Kingsley, “Sir… let’s go home.”</p><p>After 
a long moment, Kingsley nods wearily. He bows hesitantly toward me, 
then turns and walks away. One by one, the Aurors Disapparate. 
Kingsley remains last. He 
turns to give me one last look, and nods to me, then vanishes with a 
crack.</p>
