    <p>From the Journal of Hermione Granger, Witch</p><p>The First of May, 2018<br/>
All magic is wish magic, in a way. In my studies of the underlying theories, I’ve noticed one thing. Underneath all of the rules, beneath the formula for enchanting language to create spells, beneath the complex motions you need to memorize… At the end of the day, it is essentially waving a finger to get what you want. We have what they call in Fantasy “Soft Magic”, that is, magic with more power than limitations.<br/>
But there exists a spell so powerful, you can do whatever you want with it. Not simply limited to whatever word that spell derived from, and what meaning was assigned to it by whoever invented it, this spell is truly Wish Magic, magic that makes your wish come true, as long as it still follows most of the rules of magic. You can, for instance, achieve things with a spoken word that would normally require some sort of artifact or object- You can slay a horcrux, for instance, with Wish Magic. You can turn back time, as with a time turner, and stability of the time-line is not a concern. You can transmute food and you can, indeed, even create animus, or a soul.<br/>
If you’re reading this, you’ve probably already deduced that this Wish Magic was implemented in the creation of all of the great wizard schools, and you can also probably deduce that it was used on Hogwarts twice, and the entire North-American continent once.<br/>
The second casting on Hogwarts created the Room of Requirement, a room that I and my family discovered in our fifth year of attending (Ginny and Luna’s fourth, of course). The deeds, or as is favoured lately, misdeeds, of Dumbledore’s Army are infamous. It is where we gathered and trained under that old bitch’s nose. Well, both old bitches. Dumbledore himself had no idea it was happening, luckily for us, or he’d likely have tried to shape us as well as Harry.<br/>
The casting on America eliminated the need for a statute of secrecy there. Any magic is seen as an American oddity, or some complicated parlour trick. If you’ve been to America, you understand how impressive this is- Appalachian wizards are especially prone to flaunting, and those in the big cities often make a few dollars off of simple shows of magic in the streets or subways. And yet muggles, domestic and foreign, simply move along.<br/>
Wish Magic has died with its practitioners, the founders of the great magic schools. Harry and I plan to travel to Japan to seek out an answer on whether or not we might be able to find any ancient books on the subject. Their kami are similar to our anima, so perhaps some text or obscure practice has survived the ages, and we might be able to finally, finally, rid the world of Voldemort. </p><p>Harriot Potter was tired of the Muggle world. She didn’t mind finally having television and batteries back, and Hermione even retrofitted some rechargable batteries to work off of magic, so they didn’t even have to keep paying for them. But she absolutely hated airplanes, and despised cars. Give her a broomstick any day.<br/>
The roads were also nice, but loud and crowded. She thought Diagon Alley was crowded, but likely the entire British wizarding population could fit into Paris if you removed all of the Muggles, and most Paris streets were at least as crowded as DIagon Alley.<br/>
Paris was on Harry’s mind lately. So were planes. Mostly because she was running across the Paris airport with Hermione trying to catch a their connecting flight from New York to Tokyo.<br/>
They left Ron, Ginny, Neville and Luna at home, since they had to take care of their affairs- have everything shut off by September, shop for clothes circa 1992, just in case this goes horribly wrong. Make sure that the living Weasleys know that Ron and Ginny weren’t dead, just going off of the grid. The usual stuff.<br/>
Harry finally caught up to Hermione, her rolling suitcase clacking on the ground. Hermione was mumbling some magic law, as she is wont to do when she’s stressed.<br/>
“Three for power, seven to last. Three for power, seven to last.”<br/>
“Three for power? Is that why we made such a good team in school?” Harriot joked to hide her stress. They were both stressed, this was the case nearly every day.<br/>
“No, we were just talented. Three for power, seven to-”<br/>
“Hermione.” Harry stopped. Hermione stopped too. “Seriously. Calm down, yeah? You almost missed the gate. That’s not like you.”<br/>
Harry pointed at said gate, showing the flight from Paris to Tokyo. Harry had picked up French over the years, and of course Hermione was an icosaglot, and French was among the first languages she learned. (Before Spanish, Portuguese, Mandarin, Cantonese, Arabic, Japanese and even Weasley. Of them, she said, Weasley was the hardest).<br/>
Hermione plopped down in the nearest empty seat. “I know. I’m just… Harry, the fate of the world is in the balance.”<br/>
“Dear, it’s always in the balance.”<br/>
“Yes, but this time more so than others. Japanese wizards don’t make kami, they just appear. It’s similar to the effects of Wish Magic, but we might have to reverse engineer the process, then the spell itself out of it.”<br/>
“You’re the greatest Artificer there’s ever been, Hermione. You’ve invented more spells than Ravenclaw herself, and you’re worrying about having to have most of the work done for you.”<br/>
“It’s not that simple! Wish Magic is the most complex there is. It’s been pulled off less than a dozen times throughout history, and it’s lost.” Hermione inhales deeply. “It’s not that I don’t have faith in myself. It’s that I don’t know if it exists at all anymore.”<br/>
Harry sighs. “And the reason why we aren’t just Apparating? Or using a broomstick?”<br/>
“Broomstick’s obvious, Harry. Use your head, it’ll take too long on a broomstick, and we’ll have to stop more often. And the Japanese wizards are sort of like the English wizards. They don’t like outsiders so much. While we’re stuck in the sixteenth century, though. they’re closer to the eighteen-fifties. They went into hiding when the Americans came about, and weren’t really open to begin with.”<br/>
“I mean, I know that, but why not Apparate to Taiwan and take a boat, or a broomstick?”<br/>
Hermione’s expression turns blank, then she grins wildly. “Harriot Lily Potter you mad genius! I hadn’t even thought of that!” She takes their things and heads off to a dimly lit corner, while Harry breathes a sigh of relief. No planes. Not this time.</p>
