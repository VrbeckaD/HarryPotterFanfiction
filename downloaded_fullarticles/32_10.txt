    <p align="justify">August that year oozed with the golden warmth of long, uninterrupted days, the sun hanging in a cerulean sky. The soft flesh of the fruit on the trees swelled and ripened, splitting open so that rivulets of warm juice dripped decadently to the orchard floor. The lake glittered, the grass turned from verdant green to ochre and brown—everything was rich and shrouded in hazy delight.  It felt like a summer they would hold onto forever, clutched tight on dark nights and grey days, a nostalgic gem when the months had stretched out and each hour bled into the next with delicious insouciance, as though time had all but ceased to be important. </p>
<p align="justify">Rabastan, however, was bored. Despite the tapestry of colour and delight in the grounds, he remained in the cool shadow of Lestrange Manor’s library, standing at the window to fix the outside world with a frown. On the small writing desk to his right sat his diary—thick parchment pages bound in midnight blue leather—and an eagle feather quill, his erstwhile companions since lunchtime. He’d written nearly ten pages since then, a slow act of adoration to the sound of his quill scratching against the parchment. </p>
<p align="justify">It was past four o’clock, though you wouldn’t have known it with how high the sun still was in the sky. The low table in the library had been set for tea just as it was every afternoon. A cake stand—silver, ornately woven, an heirloom—was laden with every delight: dainty sandwiches filled with the very best produce that the Lestrange estate could offer; scones studded with little gems of fruit, waiting to be smothered in clotted cream and jam; delicate macarons and fairy cakes iced with buttercream. Rabastan’s mouth watered when he looked at it, and at the icy jug of fresh lemonade and two glasses sitting beside it. His frown deepened. </p>
<p align="justify">Rabastan was bored because Rodolphus was late. Seventeen minutes late, to be precise. The family ate the main meals together each day, where possible, but the twin brothers always took afternoon tea alone, just the two of them. Rabastan let out a grunt of disapproval, and turned back to the window. </p>
<p align="justify">When Rodolphus did enter the library a few minutes later, he was in no rush at all. Having spent the majority of the day outside making well-meant but seemingly futile attempts at getting their latest pegasus filly to begin trusting him, he was in a good mood that was only made brighter at the idea of being able to annoy his brother mildly. </p>
<p align="justify">He didn’t feel like Rabastan would be able to blame him at all, really, when the reason for his lateness was something Rodolphus assumed his twin would be every bit as glad about as he was. </p>
<p align="justify">He’d been on time—or at the very least had been on time enough—getting changed out of the robes he wore when working with the winged horses around Lestrange Manor, nearly enough to make it down to the library only a minute or two after four, when he’d received Narcissa’s owl. Rabastan would surely understand it was only to be expected that he reply to her before afternoon tea. </p>
<p align="justify">“I know, I know,” Rodolphus threw his hands up and began his excuse before his brother had a chance to say anything. He sat down on one of the armchairs near the low table and looked up at Rabastan with a grin. “Not my fault. Cissa owled, she will be arriving after dinner tonight. Said she’s fine, elves are preparing a room, mother is excited.”</p>
<p align="justify">He was excited, too. They hadn’t heard too much from Narcissa since the start of the summer holidays a few weeks back, and though the occasional updates hadn’t been as worrying as they could have been, they were both eager to see their close friend in person.  </p>
<p align="justify">Rabastan pursed his lips and refrained from making a comment. Instead, he poured out a glass of the cold lemonade and slid it across the table to his brother. “Drink,” he urged, “you look like you’re hotter than a Blast-Ended Skrewt.” </p>
<p align="justify">“Might be,” Rodolphus shrugged, ducking his head when he lifted the glass to his lips with a smile. He often lost track of time when he was outside, more so when he was with the horses, and despite the heat he couldn’t really remember when he’d last sat down for a drink today. “Thanks. She’ll be here tonight, but she didn’t say much more.”</p>
<p align="justify">Rabastan allowed himself a smile, then. Narcissa arriving would mean long conversations stretching into the early hours, the three of them putting the world to rights. It would mean riding the horses down to the lake, and picnics, and stargazing. The boys had hoped for something exciting to tide them over until term started again, and Narcissa was providing it; soon, owls from Hogwarts would arrive with their book lists for fifth year, and that would mean a trip to Diagon Alley, too. </p>
<p align="justify">“Feels like forever since we’ve seen her, doesn’t it?” Rabastan helped himself to a smoked salmon sandwich, stuffing half of it in his mouth and speaking thickly through it. “Not since the end of term.” </p>
<p align="justify">He looked at his brother thoughtfully as he ate, head cocked a little to one side. They were about as different as twins could be: Rodolphus was dark like their father, brown tousled hair that he hadn’t fixed before tea, high cheekbones and hooded dark-blue eyes giving him a natural threatening, warning, look that only worked if you didn’t know the person behind it too well.</p>
<p align="justify">Rabastan, however, looked like their mother. The younger twin had Adrastia’s Greengrass genes: fair hair that fell onto his forehead, pink cheeks that belied a sense of innocence that wasn’t entirely undeserved. His blue eyes were inquisitive, observant, constantly flitting about the place and picking up the details that so often went overlooked. </p>
<p align="justify">“It does,” Rodolphus answered him, leaning back in his chair lazily after taking a slice of lemon cake from the tray, tapping his wand against the arm of it absentmindedly. He gave his brother a mildly disgusted scowl at the way he was eating, but only got halfway through swallowing his cake before not being able to keep silent any longer. </p>
<p align="justify">It did feel like it’d been too long since they’d last seen Narcissa. It didn’t help that with a family like the Blacks, aside from the brothers steadily growing bored of only spending time alone or with one another, you could never be sure when was an appropriate time to begin worrying. Rodolphus was no expert on the dynamics within the infamous house of Black, but between her intentions of coming out to her family; the lack of consistency and real information in her letters; not to mention how badly Rodolphus wanted to talk to someone he wasn’t related to after such a long time with just his family, he was relieved she’d finally be coming over. </p>
<p align="justify">“She didn’t say how long she’ll be staying, but I guess til the start of term,” Rodolphus continued, frowning when his wand sparked unexpectedly. He shrugged, then grinned almost immediately and continued the rhythm as though nothing had happened; elves could fix the small burn mark later. “I wonder if we’ll get told about prefect and captain positions already, too,” he said, unintentionally changing the topic, “and we’ll have to take the Abraxans for a ride when she gets here; she hasn’t forgiven me for putting her on a Greynian with no warning yet…”  </p>
<p align="justify">Rabastan chuckled at the unintentional sparks.  </p>
<p align="justify">“D’you think…” he trailed off and swallowed the rest of his sandwich. “D’you think she’s coming because of, y’know, her parents not—not taking things well?” </p>
<p align="justify">“Could be,” Rodolphus muttered, and at once it felt like the conversation sobered up. It wasn’t a far-fetched suggestion, after all. He already wasn’t too sure how exactly their own parents would have responded to one of them transitioning in that way, though he had little doubt Adrastia and Raoul would always respond better than the Blacks might. The Black family ruled their children with a much harsher hand for a reason he’d never quite understood.</p>
<p align="justify">This time he waited until he’d finished his cake to continue his thought. “We didn’t hear anything, mother and father didn’t either I guess. That—can be good or bad… But we would’ve heard it if... if it was big, right?” He assumed, or hoped, that they would have heard it already if Narcissa had been in big trouble, just as he was sure they would have heard if her family had already publicly given her their support. It would have been news either way, and it would have reached them. </p>
<p align="justify">The possibilities in between those two options were many and Rodolphus had no idea what to expect. “Can’t really imagine the Blacks being too… open-minded. She’ll be okay here either way, right?”</p>
<p align="justify">Rabastan let out a little hum of agreement, tipping his head to one side as he picked up another sandwich. He paused, his hand resting on the side of the plate, fingers either side of a particularly excellent-looking ham sandwich. </p>
<p align="justify">“Cygnus and Druella being open-minded?” He snorted a little. “Yeah, not going to happen.” </p>
<p align="justify">Rabastan sat back in his armchair and looked at his brother. Rodolphus was right—news travelled with the wind in the pureblood world. A whisper in Paris would reach London by lunchtime, their father always said, and surely that was true of Narcissa’s situation. They’d have heard <em> something </em> if the Black parents had welcomed this change with open arms, or if they’d cast their daughter to the street. <em> Subtlety </em> was not in Druella’s vocabulary; that was a trait reserved for her sister-in-law and the <em> other </em> side of the Black family. After all, it was <em> Druella </em>who had told half the pureblood world that her nephew was a Gryffindor practically before the Sorting Ceremony was over…</p>
<p align="justify">“I hope it’s a good thing,” Bastan continued. “I hope it just means that they’re generally accepting it and just… getting adjusted, or something. Learning to use her name, something like that. I hope. They can’t have kicked her out, we’d have heard about it.” </p>
<p align="justify">Rodolphus nodded, truly just wanting his brother to be right about this. “Just getting adjusted, yeah. That’s gotta be it.”</p>
<p align="justify">Bastan took a bite of his sandwich, and let out a satisfied sigh. Narcissa arriving would be good; he’d just upgraded to the new Cleansweep, meaning that his old Comet 150 was going spare for Narcissa to ride. Rabastan was as Quidditch-mad as his brother was horse-obsessed, and all he could think about was how much better it would be to have three of them flying together. The summer before, they’d build an obstacle course in the woods—hoops that changed size, trees to slalom between, a rather ingenious flaming tunnel—and Bastan was itching to see how his new broom fared. It wasn’t as fun when you were only competing against yourself. </p>
<p align="justify">“Narcissa can have my old Comet,” he said decisively, “and we can see if we can beat our times on the flying course.” He jumped up out of his chair and wandered over to where his journal lay open, swapping his sandwich to the other hand so that he could pick up his quill and scratch out a note to himself to <em> clear up the flying course </em>. “I bet Narcissa will be even better than last year.” </p>
<p align="justify">Rodolphus grinned at Rabastan’s excitement over the prospect of flying with the three of them. His brother had always been more into quidditch than he was, even though they’d been on the Slytherin team together for a while now. He liked the game and he liked flying, but he much preferred flying the horses if he got to choose; he had always liked them better. </p>
<p align="justify">When Narcissa arrived, they’d be able to fly with the three of them like they did every summer. She’d come over a few weeks during the holidays ever since they’d started Hogwarts, and it was always one of Rodolphus’ favourite times of the year when they could spend as much time as they wanted outside. Just the three of them, not a care in the world. “For her sake, I hope you’re right,” Rodolphus responded, but he had no doubt Rabastan was right in what he was saying. Cissa had never been interested in trying out for the team at all, but she never had a very hard time keeping up with Bastan when they flew together. </p>
<p align="justify">He leaned forward to fill his glass with pumpkin juice and took a sandwich as well, then leaned back in his chair again as he watched Rabastan jot something down in his journal. Rodolphus had never really understood their father’s and now his brother’s need to write in diaries so much; the one time he’d tried it he’d given up after the second day when he’d forgotten all about it. “It’ll be great to have Cissa here again,” he muttered. “I want to know for sure she’s fine.”</p>
<p align="justify">Rabastan looked up from his journal and nodded thoughtfully. “Same,” he agreed, and then echoed his brother’s words. “I want to know she’s fine.”</p>
