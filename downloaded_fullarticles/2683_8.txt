    <p>“Come on, old man, you’re nearly there.”</p><p>Snape had stopped, perhaps only twenty feet from the top. He leaned over with his hands on his knees, his back rising and falling as his lungs fought for air. His hair was plastered to his neck with sweat. Of course, if he didn’t insist on wearing those stupid robes whenever he went outside, he might find it easier.</p><p>Moody began walking back down the path. By the time he reached him, Fen and Murdo were licking Snape’s face, while he tried to push them away rather half-heartedly. He was still doubled over and gasping for breath.</p><p>“You alright, Severus?”</p><p>Moody rested a hand on the heaving back. Snape was idiotic enough to push himself to the point of collapse in his determination to prove he was alright. Moody didn’t think he’d reached quite that point, but he was concerned enough to check. If Snape expired from exhaustion after living with Moody for only a month, Lupin would be insufferable.</p><p>“If I’m… an old man…” Snape said, stopping after every couple of words to draw breath, “what… what does that… make you? A… fossil?”</p><p>“Aye,” Moody replied, relieved that Snape had energy to bite back. “But I’m a fit fossil. C’mon. If you can’t walk I’ll carry you.”</p><p>Snape pushed himself upright and began to walk again. He managed to get himself in front of Moody, walking in the middle of the path so that Moody couldn’t pass him and was forced to match his slow pace. When he reached the top, he fell to his knees and flopped over into the grass. Murdo and Fen did the same. Moody eased himself down more slowly. His missing leg seldom held him back, but he did find it difficult to kneel. He pulled out a bottle of water and handed it to Snape.</p><p>“It wasn’t really that bad, was it? Easaval’s not that high.”</p><p>Snape was silent for a moment while he guzzled water.</p><p>“I thought you were trying to kill me.”</p><p>“Now you’re just being daft. If I wanted to kill you I’ve got a dozen better ways. For a start, I could have made you walk up Hecla. Or I could have put something in that water.”</p><p>Snape passed the bottle back to Moody, a faint smirk on his face. Moody drank, before conjuring a bowl and placing it down for Fen and Murdo.</p><p>“Fortunately for you, Snape, I’m getting used to have that scowling face of yours around. I might even have got rather fond of it.”</p><p>“It’s not my face you’re fond of, you pervert.”</p><p>“I am fond your arse, true enough.”</p><p>Moody shifted himself across so his hip was touching Snape’s. He brushed a few strands of sweaty hair from the still-flushed cheeks, then lowered himself down until he was resting on one elbow. He leaned in and brushed his lips against Snape’s, once, twice and then a third time, the last more lingering. He felt the body against him stiffen, and then Snape turned his head away.</p><p>Moody sat up. They’d been all over each other since the day Snape had arrived. Well, it was more that Moody couldn’t keep his hands off Snape, but the younger man was an enthusiastic participant and even beginning to initiate their contact with more confidence. It wasn’t like him to react that way.</p><p>“What’s the matter, Severus?”</p><p>“There are people around.”</p><p>“What? There’s nobody for miles.”</p><p>“What about those hikers?”</p><p>“They passed us nearly an hour ago. Given the pace they were walking, they’ll be in Ludag by now.”</p><p>Snape glared at him and Moody rolled his good eye.</p><p>“What a modest little maiden you are. Does it really matter if a couple of hikers see us?”</p><p>Now Snape blushed scarlet and looked away, scowling. The hikers, Moody realised, had been the first people other than himself that Snape had seen in the month he’d been staying at the cottage. He’d refused to meet Moody’s daughter, or son-in-law, or any of their children. Perhaps Snape just wasn’t ready to face people yet.</p><p> “Oh, alright then,” Moody said. “Take a look at the view, since you’ve walked all the way up here, then we’ll apparate somewhere a bit more secluded.”</p><p>Snape rolled away from Moody and began getting up. Suddenly he let out a startled sound and began crawling across the grass and rocks. Moody had his wand out in a flash.</p><p>“What is it, Snape?” he hissed.</p><p>“It’s <i>Ajuga pyramidalis</i>. I’ve never seen it wild before.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Snape was now lying beside a clump of purple flowers, lovingly holding a stem between his fingers.</p><p>“The pyramid bugle. Pomona used to grow it, but I’ve never seen it growing wild. Used in Sober-up and Dreamless Sleep, among others.”</p><p>Moody put his wand away, feeling slightly foolish.</p><p>“That thing? It grows all over the hills past where the sheep graze.”</p><p>“Really? Would I be able to harvest some?”</p><p>Snape looked up, his eyes bright and not a trace of frown on his face. In spite of himself, Moody felt a grin twitching at the corner of his mouth.</p><p>“Don’t see why not. There’s heaps of it. I’ll take you up there, once you get fit enough. Now, come on, stop playing with the flowers.”</p><p>Snape stood, then put out his hand to help Moody to his feet, although he pulled his hand away once Moody was upright. Fen and Murdo were already trotting down the path, taking it in turns to look back and check the two men were following. As Snape began walking down the path, Moody after him, both two dogs turned to watch, then began to wag their tails.</p><p>When they reached a quiet spot, well back from the track, Moody called to Murdo and grabbed the thick fur on the back of his neck. Snape did the same with Fen, then Moody took his arm and apparated them all back to a field near the cottage.</p><p>“I still don’t see why we couldn’t have just apparated there as well,” Snape muttered.</p><p>“How are you ever going to get any fitter if you don’t exercise?”</p><p>“I am perfectly fine. I am not in need of exercise.”</p><p>Moody slapped him on the arm.</p><p>“Aye, and I’m not in need of another leg. Do you think I haven’t noticed that you’ve got a chair in your lab so you can sit down while you’re brewing?”</p><p>Snape scowled.</p><p>“And don’t you want to get your apparation license back?”</p><p>The scowl deepened.</p><p>“Besides”, Moody continued, sidling closer, “there are other benefits to being fitter. You’d have more stamina for other things.”</p><p>Moody lifted his hand to Snape’s shoulder, then slid it behind his neck. His other hand moved to Snape’s hip. He tilted his head slightly and moved in to kiss the downturned lips. Snape stood stiffly for a moment, then surrendered, lips parting, body relaxing, arms slipping around Moody’s waist and his hands shifting down to grip Moody’s buttocks, pulling their hips together.</p><p>“I want you,” Moody growled, pulling away from the kiss and beginning to work his way down Snape’s neck. “I want you right here, right now.”</p><p>“Outside?” Snape asked, his body tensing.</p><p>“Right here, right now,” Moody repeated.</p><p>He moved forward, pushing Snape backwards until he was leaning against a stone wall which had once formed part of a sheep pen. Moody began to shift his hips, rubbing their hardening erections against each other through Moody’s kilt and Snape’s absurd number of layers of robes and trousers.</p><p>“You want me, don’t you, Severus. I know you want me too. I can feel it. Your hot, hard cock wants me. Your tight hole wants me.”</p><p>The sound that escaped Snape’s lips was not a word. It wasn’t even close. It was a strangled whimper, like a desperate puppy. Moody loved that he could drive Snape to incoherence, but there was nothing better than hearing the words.</p><p>“Go on, Severus, say it. I want to hear it.”</p><p>“Aargh… yes… I want…”</p><p>Snape paused to draw a few deep breaths. </p><p>“What do you want?”</p><p>“I want… you… your cock. Your… hot, hard, huge cock.”</p><p>Moody loved to hear Snape’s refined voice speaking pure smut. Filthy words, from his tongue, sounded as if he was quoting Shakespeare.</p><p>“I want you… inside me… feel you… penetrate me… ah…”</p><p>“Is that so?” Moody replied, both hands now sliding over Snape’s buttocks. The muscles beneath his fingers trembled slightly, whether in anticipation or because Snape had tired himself out walking up the hill, he wasn’t sure.</p><p>“In that case,” Moody continued, his mouth close to Snape’s ear, “turn around and give me your arse.”</p><p>He pulled back, looking into the half-closed, dark eyes. Snape was looking back at him, mouth open. Moody leaned in and kissed the slightly swollen, flushed lips, then pulled back and turned Snape to face away from him. He pressed up behind Snape, hitching up the black robes so he could feel the erection without the barrier of two layers of heavy fabric. He unbuttoned the waistband of Snape’s trousers, then slid his hand down until he felt the hardness under his fingers. Snape gasped as Moody closed his hand and slowly slid up and down.</p><p>“Say it, Severus, say it.”</p><p>“Fuck me, Alastor. I want to feel your prick in my arse. I… I need you… need you to enter me now… need you throbbing and thrusting inside me… need your cock, your huge, hard cock…”</p><p>Moody, panting with need, ground his groin against Snape buttocks and wondered if he would come just listening to that voice. He could almost feel… no… that wouldn’t do. He quickly pushed Snape’s trousers and underwear down, just far enough, then hitched up his kilt so they were skin to skin.</p><p>“Oh, yes, Al, yes. It’s so huge, so huge and hard and all for me.”</p><p>Moody cast a cleaning charm and conjured lubricant onto his hand – he’d long ago learned to do it wandless – then with one finger breached the tight hole. He moved his finger around a little, then quickly followed with another. Snape seemed to need a bit of pain with his pleasure and preferred minimal preparation before Moody penetrated him. Moody certainly didn’t have any objections – he liked it hard and rough as well – but he was always a little cautious, suspecting that Snape wouldn’t yet have the confidence to say if Moody pushed him too far.</p><p>“There you are,” Moody growled, “that tight little hole just waiting for me to fill it.”</p><p>Snape clenched against his fingers and Moody felt the fingers of his other hand slick with precome as they caressed Snape’s engorged glans.</p><p>“Oh, oh Merlin, fuck me now. Fill me, please, Al, please, enter me, need you inside, inside me now, enter m– yes, yes, ahhh…”</p><p>With one swift movement, Moody withdrew his fingers, conjured more lube then grasped his throbbing penis. He pressed through the barely loosened ring, reducing Snape’s words to a pained gasp.</p><p>“What an eager little arse you have,” Moody said, feeling the muscles clench then release around him. He kept up the pressure, very slowly, feeling Snape yield to him. Occasionally there was a moan or a gasp, and Moody paused, giving Snape time to relax.</p><p>Then suddenly, behind him, something cold and wet pressed between his cheeks. He gave a startled yelp and jerked away from the sensation, inadvertently driving his full length deep into Snape’s arse. Moody heard a small cry escape Snape’s lips.</p><p>“Fuck, fuck I’m sorry, Sev, didn’t mean to do that. Those bloody dogs.”</p><p>He reached around behind him and tried to bat the dog away with the hand that, moments before, had been inside Snape. He felt a warm tongue on his fingers and pulled his hand back.</p><p>“Get out of it, you filthy mutt,” he yelled, pushing the dog away from him. He felt Snape flinch underneath him.</p><p>“Sorry, Sev, sorry, it’s those stupid fucking dogs, one of them stuck its nose in my crack. Startled me.”</p><p>Snape was breathing heavily and Moody reached up to touch his face, before he remembered where his hand had been. Instead, he moved his face close to Snape’s and kissed the flushed cheek. </p><p>“You alright?”</p><p>Snape nodded, but the grimace on his face said otherwise.</p><p>“No you’re not. I’ll pull out a bit.”</p><p>“No, just…”</p><p>Snape took another breath and held it, before exhaling slowly.</p><p>“It was a bit much,” he finally said. “Just hold still for a minute.”</p><p>Moody slid his arm around Snape’s waist and held him as he took slow breaths. Then the cold wet nose was back, with company.</p><p>“Argh, it’s both those bloody dogs now. Fuck off you stupid beasts.”</p><p>He reached behind and shoved them away. Against his chest, he could feel Snape’s back shaking. For a moment he thought Snape was upset, but then heard a soft chuckle. The unfamiliar sound stopped him in his tracks.</p><p>“Severus?”</p><p>“The dogs… they… oh Merlin…”</p><p>Moody found himself laughing as well.</p><p>“First time,” he managed to say, “I’ve… I’ve ever had a… a bloody Border Collie… try to give me a rim job.”</p><p>Snape broke into full laughter then and Moody collapsed forward with his chest to Snape’s back. He couldn’t remember when he’d last laughed like that.</p><p>“Merlin, Al, that’s… disgusting. I knew… knew you were a bit… fuck… but not that…”</p><p>“Aye, you never thought I… was that broad-minded?”</p><p>Snape was almost convulsing underneath him now. Moody held tight with an arm around Snape’s waist. They laughed, leaning on the wall, bodies joined, until Moody felt tears in his eyes and he could see that Snape was the same.</p><p>“Rim job from… a Border Collie… you… you sick bastard, Al…”</p><p>“Well… it wasn’t like I asked… or said yes…”</p><p>Moody could feel Snape relaxing around his erection, which had somehow persisted despite the dogs’ best efforts. Slowly, he began to move his hips and Snape’s laughter began to change to something more like whimpers and moans.</p><p>“Alright, Sev?”</p><p>“Mmm… yes… better than… oh…yes… that’s good…”</p><p>Snape shifted his hips back and Moody began to thrust harder, moving one hand to the top of the wall to get more leverage. Snape slid his hand along the wall and placed it over the top of Moody’s. Moody conjured lube into his other hand and reached down to grasp Snape’s now very engorged cock. The movement of their hips slid Snape’s cock back and forth in his hand.</p><p>“Merlin, harder, Al… want more… need you to fill me… harder… yes… yes…oh… oh Merlin… aaah…”</p><p>Moody began to drive deeper, now hitting Snape’s prostate and reducing him to breathless moaning.</p><p>“You feel so good, Sev… so hot… so tight… so good… come for me… come for me, Sev… want to feel you…”</p><p>Moody’s thrusts were plunging his prick in so hard that Snape was nearly losing his footing, clinging to the wall and gasping out choked cries. Moody was close, so close, the sound, smell and feeling of Snape’s arousal taking him almost to the edge. Then Snape’s hole began to contract around him and Snape let out a cry which went straight to Moody’s cock. Moody felt the wave build from his balls and then surge through him. Pulses of his hot seed burst from him, filling Snape as he shuddered and spurted his own release.</p><p>Breathing heavily, Moody dropped his forehead to rest on Snape’s shoulder. He felt Snape’s body sag beneath him and quickly wrapped his arms around the bony chest.</p><p>“You alright there, Severus?”</p><p>“Mmmm…. yes…</p><p>Moody pushed himself back, his softening cock sliding from Snape’s well-stretched arse. With a wave of his hand – another spell he’d long ago mastered wandless – he cleaned up their mess, before turning Snape around so his back was against the wall. Snape wrapped his arms around Moody’s neck and rested his head on Moody’s shoulder.</p><p>“Worn you out, have I?”</p><p>“Mmm.”</p><p>Snape nodded without lifting his head.</p><p>“Need me to carry you back to the cottage, do you?”</p><p>Snape pulled his head back and gave Moody an unconvincing glare. He looked far too relaxed to be menacing.</p><p>“Come on then,” Moody said, pulling Snape’s underwear and trousers up before smoothing his robes back down. He took Snape’s arm and they headed down the path back to the cottage, while the dogs, who appeared entirely unrepentant, trotted ahead.</p><p>By the time they got inside, Snape’s face was starting to look rather grey.</p><p>“You need to eat something, Severus. I’ll get some lunch.”</p><p>“Not hungry,” Snape replied, flopping onto a sofa and making no effort to stop Murdo draping himself across his lap.</p><p>“Broth then,” Moody said.</p><p>“I’m not an invalid,” Snape snapped back at him.</p><p>“I know,” Moody said, making sure he didn’t roll his eyes. “But I pushed you pretty hard this morning, so it’s my fault you’re feeling worn out.”</p><p>Moody retreated to the kitchen, where he heated beef broth and some vegetables that had been cooked with it. He doubted Snape would eat the vegetables, but he’d have some as well, along with the salt herring that Miona’s husband, Uilleam, still caught and prepared himself. Snape hated it, but it reminded Moody of Beathag and her family, and having a ready supply was one of the benefits of living on the island.</p><p>When the meal was ready, Moody called Snape through and they sat at the kitchen table. Snape ate most of the broth and grudgingly managed a few pieces of carrot and potato. Moody was relieved – Snape had arrived at the cottage still far too thin. Left to his own devices, Moody suspected, Snape would live on black tea and bread with margarine, or even forget meals altogether. He’d admitted that was what he had done during the summers, when Moody had discovered he had no clue how to cook.</p><p>“How can you brew Wolfsbane and not boil an egg,” he’d asked.</p><p>“It’s different,” Snape had replied, speaking as if Moody one of his dunderheaded students.</p><p>“How can it be different? It’s about putting things in a pot or a cauldron and heating them. The only difference is that Wolfsbane is about a hundred times more complicated.”</p><p>“It’s different,” Snape said again, folding his arms and getting a stubborn look on his face. Moody knew better than to try and argue the point.</p><p>“How did you survive all these years then? On potions?”</p><p>Snape rolled his eyes.</p><p>“I never needed to cook at Hogwarts.”</p><p>“What about the summers. You always used to spend your summers at Spinners End, didn’t you?”</p><p>“I was fine. Plenty of bread and margarine.”</p><p>Moody made a face.</p><p>“That’s not a balanced diet.”</p><p>“What’s wrong with it? That’s what I had growing up. Never did me any harm.”</p><p>The expression on Snape’s face had turned distinctly defensive. Moody realised he was heading down a dangerous path. He well remembered the reaction he’d had when he realised Snape’s idea of personal hygiene was to cast <i>Scourgify</i> on himself once a week. He’d quickly discovered that Snape was unaware of the gentler and more effective cleaning charms that most magical children learned from their parents, and Muggleborns picked up from their friends when they started at Hogwarts. When Moody asked why he’d never learned, Snape had come close to hexing him.</p><p>“Tea, Severus?” Moody said as he directed the dirty plates to the sink and cast a washing spell.</p><p>Snape shook his head and stood.</p><p>“I think I might have a sleep,” he mumbled.</p><p>Moody nodded. Snape didn’t like to admit it, but he often needed to sleep, or at least rest, in the afternoons.</p><p>“Alright,” Moody said. “Just let me do a quick cleaning spell on you before you go to bed.”</p><p>Snape glared at him.</p><p>“Are you actually concerned that I’m not clean, or is this because you want to sneak a couple of monitoring spells on me?”</p><p>“You’re all sweaty from this morning’s walk. You don’t want to go to bed like that.”</p><p>“Any you’re not planning any monitoring spells?”</p><p>Moody shrugged.</p><p>“I’m just going into the bedroom. And this entire place is warded up tighter than Hogwarts. Do you really think it’s necessary to put spells on me to check I’m alright?”</p><p>“Humour me,” Moody said.</p><p>“You really are a paranoid bastard, aren’t you?”</p><p>Moody raised his eyebrows.</p><p>“Do you mean to say you've only noticed this now?”</p><p>The corner of Snape’s mouth twitched up for a moment, before he gave a sigh.</p><p>“Alright, then, Alastor. Consider yourself humoured.”</p><p>Moody stood, pointing his wand at Snape. He cast a gentle cleaning spell which vanished the dried sweat from Snape’s body and hair, before adding a charm which would tell him whether Snape was awake or asleep, another which would alert him if Snape felt any anxiety or fear and a proximity spell which would tell him if anyone came within ten metres of him. He then slipped his wand back into his sleeve and took Snape’s hands in his.</p><p>“Have a good sleep, Severus,” he said, placing a kiss on the pale lips and another on the top of the dark head.</p><p>Snape merely nodded, then turned and walked from the room.</p><p>Moody didn’t like to examine why it was that he felt the frozen fingers of fear clutch at him whenever Snape walked out of the room. It was part of a rather unsettling pattern which he’d begun to notice since the former Death Eater had arrived at the cottage – the way he wanted to look after Snape, the way that he imagined terrible things happening to him whenever Snape was out of his sight, the way a room felt warmer and brighter with Snape in it. It had been a very long time since Moody had felt that way, and he found it distinctly disconcerting.</p><p>It could only mean one thing, Moody thought. Everything was about to go horribly wrong.</p>
