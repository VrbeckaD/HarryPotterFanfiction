          <div class="userstuff"><p>“Should’ve known you’d try to sneak in and out without anyone noticing.”</p><p>Harry spun around, drawing his wand out of habit before recognising the voice. Draco appeared from under a disillusionment charm.</p><p>“Didn’t want to make things awkward,” Harry mumbled, stowing his wand and wishing he’d taken Neville up on his offer to use his floo after dinner. He should never have come back to Hogwarts after the fight.</p><p>“Awkward? You are the very epitome of awkward,” Draco scoffed.</p><p>Harry tensed. “You made it pretty clear you didn’t want to see me again.”</p><p>Draco’s expression crumbled.</p><p>“I was distraught. I didn’t mean any of it. I know it wasn’t your fault, you weren’t even the one who cast the spell to bring him down. It was his own damn fault for breaking out of Azkaban,” Draco said. “I owled you. More than once.”</p><p>“I didn’t open them.”</p><p>Draco stepped close and took Harry’s face in his hands. “I’m sorry. I crossed a line, I know. Grief is no excuse. Please, come back to me?”</p><p>Harry closed his eyes and pulled away. “I’m not sure I can.”</p><p>He left without looking back.</p></div>
