          <div class="userstuff"><p>I blink, and the darkness fizzles out softly, blurring into an endless sea of lights. They are shining with all the brightness of early evening. Reflecting across the glass; a window to the city below. Red. Orange. Yellow. The glow of a cityscape awakening to the night. I have also awoken to the night. Like an owl; a night creature.</p><p>The wind rustles. It flows in through the cracked windows, sighs across my skin; bringing with it drunken shouts and laughs and car horns and leaving goosebumps on my arms.</p><p>I stare at the glass, which is black as a mirror. Dark, despite all the lights hiding behind it. What is this city? I do not remember it. What are these sheets that feel as soft as clouds and smell of fresh parchments and library books long hidden away?</p><p>I don‘t know it. </p><p>It’s not the small flat I share with Ron. Diagon Alley doesn’t glow this brightly, doesn’t shine with all the inventive fervor of over a hundred years of Muggle history.</p><p>It is unfamiliar. </p><p>As unfamiliar as Hogwarts was on that first day when I walked the halls armed only with the knowledge of a thousand, thousand books, attempting to fit in by pretending to understand this current that has always run inside me. When I rattled off obscure facts from books no one had ever heard of just so I could say, <em> see? </em> I understand. I <em> know. </em>I’m one of you. I know about your history, your society, about Harry. Harry, I know you too. I know <em> your </em> history. Don’t you? <em> Don’t you? </em></p><p>Oh, is that real magic? It doesn’t sound like anything I’ve ever read. It doesn’t <em> feel </em> like magic. Do you believe it, or are you only pretending too? </p><p>
  <em> Are you like me? </em>
</p><p>Are you <em> sure </em> that’s a real spell?</p><p>Well, it’s not very good, is it?</p><p>I know. I know it all; everything. I <em> am </em> sure. You see… I’ve read it all. </p><p>But this, now, is worse. What <em> is </em> this city? Is it London still? I sense no magic. No current of life. It doesn’t sound like London, doesn’t <em>feel </em> like London. Is it Paris? Madrid? Lisbon?</p><p>How can I study if I don’t know where to begin?</p><p>I stare, and I can’t understand. Would Ron secret me away? Whisk me off to a place so unfamiliar with not a moment’s warning?</p><p>The thought is exciting, somehow. Romantic. But… unlikely. Ron… And I hate to admit it to myself, but Ron wouldn’t do this. As much as I love him. As much as we fit around each other like two halves of a heart that broke once, more lives ago then I can count, and fell back together when our lips touched, I know he doesn’t have the spark of romance that would spirit me away to a city I’ve never seen. </p><p>Ron is not mystery nor intrigue. He is dependable. Sometimes with hard or dry or jagged edges, but always, <em> always </em> solidly there. Loving me through gentle kindness and fits of sullen anger both. </p><p>But Ron doesn’t plan secret adventures. Ron doesn’t do romance, doesn’t understand it. His love is bigger than that. Deeper. Simpler. </p><p>No, this gesture is unfamiliar. </p><p>But he is there, solidly at my back as I stare into the lights. </p><p>Merlin. <em> Why can’t I remember? </em></p><p>He shifts then, his arm wrapping around me. It trails across my stomach, and I reach up to twine my fingers through his… and I freeze. Suddenly all the air is gone from my lungs. All the air has frozen and turned to ice. </p><p>Because it doesn’t feel… it isn’t… <em> it isn’t his hand. </em></p><p>It isn’t Ron’s.</p><p>The fingers are too thin. Too delicate. The nails too perfect. The skin much too soft. </p><p>Ron… Ron doesn’t care for these things. Ron’s hand is hard and full of calluses from a holding a wand too tightly as an Auror for five years too long. From a hundred explosions at the joke shop. From a million jokes that he doesn’t need the moisturizing potion. </p><p>
  <em> It’s for witches. Haha. Good try, Hermione. </em>
</p><p><em> This </em> hand is soft.</p><p>I am afraid. Terrified even. But the Hat put me in Gryffindor for some undefinable reason. Something about me believing that even though I was smart and would do perfectly in Ravenclaw, I had read a million times a million books about heroes, and I wanted to be brave. Bravery was that thing I didn’t have in spades but always wanted. And the Hat told me that wanting to be brave, valuing courage, was enough. And then it said <em> Gryffindor! </em> for the entire Hall to believe… and over the next seven years I found it.</p><p>I <em> thought </em> I found it. </p><p>I reach for it now, pull it out of all the cracks that form the map of me. </p><p>I turn. </p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>The world… shatters. </p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>The eyes that meet mine are grey. Like molten silver. Like fog made solid.</p><p>The hair that falls across his forehead is pale. Smooth as silk. </p><p>His skin is crystalline. Utterly perfect. </p><p>He smiles. It’s like sunlight cutting through clouds after a storm. Bright and overwhelming, and full of love and love and <em> love</em>. </p><p>And he isn’t Ron. </p><p>And I can’t breathe. </p><p>I can’t breathe at all. </p><p>“Good morning,” he whispers, like the world hasn’t fallen off its axis. Like everything is normal. Perfect. “How’d you sleep?”</p><p>I whimper. I can’t help it. The courage I gathered around me is stretched too tight. It shatters. The shards dig into my skin. Shred my lungs to pieces. </p><p>“What’s wrong?” His eyes tint to a shade of concern. From silver to lead.</p><p>“R-Ron,” I whimper. “Ron…”</p><p>The lead turns to coal. His eyes are black, empty holes. </p><p>“Hermione,” he whispers. “Ron’s… <em> gone</em>. Don’t you remember?”</p><p>I shake my head. Silently. Wordlessly. </p><p>He pales. “Don’t you remember… us?”</p><p>I don’t. I <em> don’t</em>. </p><p>I don’t remember anything except the warmth of Ron’s eyes.</p><p>Everything else… Draco… is unfamiliar. </p><p> </p><p> </p></div>
