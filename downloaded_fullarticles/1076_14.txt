  <em>High in the halls of the kings who are gone</em>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>Jenny would dance with her ghosts</em>
</p>
<p align="left"><em><br/></em>The halls of the castle, once filled with light and life and magic, are now empty.</p>
<p>Abandoned years ago.</p>
<p>The people, the students and the teachers, heroes and villains alike, who once walked here, all gone.</p>
<p>Gone in the years of the war they thought ended the night Voldemort fell.</p>
<p>But no.</p>
<p>It was just the beginning.</p>
<p>And this is the end.</p>
<p>These halls are her only home.</p>
<p>Her only rest.</p>
<p>The halls of the place she once called home.</p>
<p>Still calls home…</p>
<p>The only comfort she can find is here.</p>
<p>The only place she ever belonged to.</p>
<p>These halls that still echo the sounds of years gone by.</p>
<p>Even with half of the walls blown to pieces.</p>
<p>Even with rocks the size of a car, fallen to the corridors.</p>
<p>Even with everyone gone.</p>
<p>This is her only home.</p>
<p>This is where she finds them again.</p>
<p>This is where she's not alone.</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>The ones she had lost</em>
</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p>Fred and Tonks and Lupin were the first to fall.</p>
<p>In the battle that started the real war… in the battle they thought had ended it.</p>
<p>Her parents, who she sent away to keep them safe… are still safe, yes.</p>
<p>But have no idea they ever had a daughter.</p>
<p>They have twins now… and they will never know about their older sister, who had magic.</p>
<p>Ron fell in the first ambush.</p>
<p>Fell, to protect Ginny.</p>
<p>Fell, and never got up.</p>
<p>Like all of them.</p>
<p>One by one.</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>And the ones she had found.</em>
</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p>The Slytherins came to ask for shelter in a night when the sky was dark with thunder.</p>
<p>Blaise Zabini, Theo Nott, Pansy Parkinson, Daphne Greengrass… and Draco Malfoy… ready to do anything, to prove they were not on Voldemort's side.</p>
<p>She had been the one to let them in.</p>
<p>To set them in front of the kitchen table and pour Veritaserum into their glasses.</p>
<p>She had listened, when Harry bombarded them with questions.</p>
<p>And she had been the one to tell Harry, they should help them.</p>
<p>So, for two long years, she and Harry kept a secret too big to tell anyone.</p>
<p>Hid traitors into their home and told no one.</p>
<p>Because she and Harry were their only hope.</p>
<p>And she and Harry were the only ones still noble enough to believe people should have a second chance.</p>
<p>It took time… but somehow, along the way… in between the shadows of war and the never leaving presence of death… they turned from enemies to allies, to friends.</p>
<p>From burden to comfort.</p>
<p>She can still hear their drunken banter from the nights' none of them could sleep.</p>
<p>The nights they sat beside the kitchen table to the early hours of the morning.</p>
<p>The nights the haze of alcohol, let them, if only just for hours, to forget the impossible situation they were in.</p>
<p>The Slytherins fought with them at the very end.</p>
<p>If she concentrates hard enough, she can feel Blaise beside her, wand raised and face determined, to face whatever was coming.</p>
<p>Still, hear the desperate cry… like a wounded animal makes… leaving Pansy's lips, into the dark night, when it all fell down.</p>
<p>Still remember the last flicker in grey eyes, when they knew it was over.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">
  <em>And the ones who had loved her the most</em>
</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p>Harry.</p>
<p>Her brother Harry never left her side.</p>
<p>Never abandoned her, even when he had a task, bigger than himself.</p>
<p>It was always him and her.</p>
<p>And there was nothing she wouldn't have done for him.</p>
<p>As long as she had him… she knew life would go on.</p>
<p>As long as she had Harry, there was still hope.</p>
<p>And then there was him.</p>
<p>His grey eyes always following her, where ever she went.</p>
<p>His snark comments and sharp mind.</p>
<p>Ever since the beginning, he seemed to be unable to let her out of his sight.</p>
<p>How she hated that at first.</p>
<p>And loved it in the end.</p>
<p>How he grew on her.</p>
<p>How she didn't know she was falling for him before she was already in too deep.</p>
<p>It was always her and Harry… and then it was him too.</p>
<p>He sneaked upon her… in every way possible.</p>
<p>Harry, she loved like a brother.</p>
<p>But Draco… there was never words to describe how she loved Draco.</p>
<p>And how he loved her.</p>
<p>In war, every day could be the last.</p>
<p>And that's how she wanted to love him.</p>
<p>Every day, like they'd die tomorrow.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">
  <em>The ones who'd been gone, for so very long</em>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>she couldn't remember their names</em>
</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p>Days and weeks and months and years, all blurred together.</p>
<p>In war, And now, after.</p>
<p>She'd lost count of everyone who fell.</p>
<p>And the more time goes by, the less significance hold the names for faces of people long gone.</p>
<p>The faces blur away with names.</p>
<p>And the memories blend into each other in her head.</p>
<p>Making everything a giant mass of darkness and terror and death.</p>
<p>The only things keeping her sane, are the golden threads of good memories, she'll never let go of.</p>
<p>Names she'll never forget.</p>
<p>Things she'll hold on even when all else is gone.</p>
<p>Hands that held her once.</p>
<p>Arms that comforted her in the darkest of nights.</p>
<p>All else can go.</p>
<p>All else can fade.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">
  <em>They spun her around on the damp old stones</em>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>Spun away all her sorrow and pain.</em>
</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p>Here she remembers them the best.</p>
<p>Here they are with her.</p>
<p>Here she can hear Harry laugh as he tosses his hand casually around Theo's shoulders.</p>
<p>Here Pansy turns the music too loud and makes them all dance.</p>
<p>Here Daphne braids her hair, as they watch the boys play chess.</p>
<p>Here Blaise still tries to make whiskey more drinkable by blending it with pumpkin juice. (It never worked)</p>
<p>Here Draco looks at her across his book and smiles slightly… a smile belonging only to her.</p>
<p>Here the war can't touch them.</p>
<p>None of them.</p>
<p>Never.</p>
<p>She and Harry don't have to leave for a battle or a raid.</p>
<p>Draco doesn't have to look at her with that pained look, that reminds her she might never come back.</p>
<p>She doesn't have to hold him like it's their last time together. Like it's the last kiss they share. Like it's the last she sees of him.</p>
<p>They stay.</p>
<p>Dance with her in the nights she can't sleep.</p>
<p>Drink the horrible whiskey blended in pumpkin juice.</p>
<p>Tell jokes so bad she can do nothing but laugh.</p>
<p>With them, she can take the night.</p>
<p>And another day.</p>
<p>With them, she can survive the silence…and pain.</p>
<p>She can bear all that she has lost, because of them.</p>
<p>So, she dances with them.</p>
<p>Laughs with them.</p>
<p>Melts into his arms… arms, that'll always, always, belong to her.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">
  <em>And she never wanted to leave</em>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>Never wanted to leave</em>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>She never wanted to leave</em>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>Never wanted to leave</em>
</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p>Sometimes someone tries to find her.</p>
<p>To interrupt her world, her peace!</p>
<p>She knows what they want.</p>
<p>They want her to leave.</p>
<p>They'd tell her there's nothing for her here anymore.</p>
<p>Tell her it's time to move on.</p>
<p>They have no idea!</p>
<p>Not a clue that everything is here!</p>
<p>That all she needs is here!</p>
<p>All she ever wants is here!</p>
<p>In the silence of an old abandoned castle.</p>
<p>Where the ones she loves, are with her!</p>
<p>Let them look.</p>
<p>She'll never leave!</p>
<p>Never!</p></div>
