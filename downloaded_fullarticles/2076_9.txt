    <p>Harry tried not to look nervous as he walked down the length of the jetty. He tried to put out an air of ‘everything’s normal’ as he took off his shoes and socks, rolled up the legs of his trousers, and sat on the edge of the jetty. The water was getting cooler, he wouldn’t be able to dangle his legs over the edge for much longer.</p><p>Out there, somewhere, Draco was surely watching him. Maybe he was under the jetty, looking up at his feet and considering giving him a heart attack by grabbing them without warning. He’d done that once.</p><p>More likely, he wasn’t going to show himself.</p><p>Harry kept telling himself it wasn’t his fault. Draco had kissed <em> him </em>. Not the other way around. He hadn’t even given Harry a chance to kiss back before splashing water in his face and swimming off.</p><p>Harry didn’t blame him. What good really came of it? Draco was still trapped in the lake, Harry was still free on land. Nothing had changed, except that Harry’s heart was racing just being there. He could feel a ghost of a tingle across his lips.</p><p>It was only the next day, and he hadn’t slept. He probably shouldn’t have come down to the jetty. He probably should have given Draco space, time to recover from his own bold move that he probably regretted, but he couldn't bear the thought that his absence might be interpreted as some kind of rejection, even though Draco hadn’t offered anything.</p><p>Just a peck of a kiss.</p><p>Might as well have been the whole world as far as Harry was concerned. Just the lightest brush of lips and his whole world had snapped into focus. He wasn’t completely dense, he knew what he’d been wanting. Draco’s new state couldn’t account for every thought and urge he’d had since meeting him at the jetty.</p><p>But that kiss promptly silenced anything he was telling himself to the contrary of what he really wanted.</p><p>But Draco was trapped in the lake. He wasn’t even fully human anymore.</p><p>What the hell was he doing cultivating an attachment to someone so unattainable?</p><p>“If you think any harder you’ll break something in that tiny brain of yours.”</p><p>Harry startled and kicked water everywhere. Draco was looking over the side of the jetty, one hand on the edge, his body turned out like he might swim off again at any moment.</p><p>He would, Harry knew. Draco spent more time swimming away from him than anything else. Except splashing him maybe.</p><p>“It’s been one of those days,” Harry replied, trying to read his expression.</p><p>It was impossible. Draco was like stone when he wanted to be. Immovable, unreadable.</p><p>“I know the feeling,” Draco murmured, looking out at the rest of the lake.</p><p>Harry’s stomach did a painful flipping thing. “Don’t go,” he said quickly.</p><p>Draco’s shoulders slumped. “It might be better if I did. If I found some other corner of the lake to spend my time in.”</p><p>Absent of acrobatic movements, Harry’s stomach just plain hurt. “I’d miss you.”</p><p>“You’d finally get real peace and quiet,” Draco said, turning to the jetty and resting both arms on it. He closed his eyes and laid his head on them. “That’s why you first came down here. I remember.”</p><p>Harry looked away, out over the lake. The idea of being there alone wasn’t so comforting anymore.</p><p>“Peace is overrated,” he said, laying back, legs still hanging over the edge, feet still in the water. “Boring even.”</p><p>“Don’t let your adoring fans hear you say that.”</p><p>Harry stared up at the sky. It was still light. He didn’t usually come down quite this early, but classes were over and he was too distracted to do anything productive in his office. He really hadn’t expected Draco to show himself. He wasn’t ready for this at all.</p><p>Being honest was probably best. He’d never been any good at talking his way around the truth. Or leading into it with any sort of sensitivity. And he’d never fool Draco if he tried anyway.</p><p>“For what it’s worth, I want to kiss you again,” he said, eyes on the sky while his face started burning.</p><p>“You want to do a lot more than that, I know,” Draco sighed. “You’re not exactly subtle. I thought you’d be over it by now. That the...the <em> novelty </em> would have worn off.”</p><p>Harry screwed up his face. “Novelty? That’s...no.”</p><p>“Close your eyes,” Draco said.</p><p>Harry turned his head to the side to look at him. Draco was still resting his head on his arms, but he was looking at him with the same kind of intensity that made Harry lose his head a little.</p><p>“Why?” he asked, his pulse quickening.</p><p>“You won’t find out unless you do it,” Draco said, his lips curving into a shaky grin.</p><p>That visible sign of nerves, more than anything, made Harry comply. After a few moments there was splashing. Water droplets landed on Harry but he stayed still and kept his eyes closed. There was a wet slap on wood, and then silence.</p><p>“Keep your eyes closed or I’ll drown you,” Draco muttered, his voice close to Harry’s ear.</p><p>“I saw you under the water last night you know,” Harry said stupidly.</p><p>“Just shut up,” Draco snapped.</p><p>“Make me,” Harry muttered, more from habit than anything. When Draco got that tone he couldn’t help but bristle in response.</p><p>Draco made an irritated sound, then grabbed his face. Harry flinched at first, not expecting it, but then relaxed against his wet fingers. Draco turned his head a little and then Harry could feel his breath on his face.</p><p>He forgot to breathe himself as Draco kissed him. It was just as hesitant and brief as the night before, only Draco hovered there after, so close their noses bumped. Harry kept his eyes closed and hoped for the best as he lifted his head.</p><p>Draco surprised him. Rather than a face full of water, Draco kissed him again. More than a peck, he lingered. Still shockingly gentle. Still hesitant, like he might pull back at any moment. Harry reached up blindly, cupping the back of Draco’s head and pulling him down. Draco opened to him like it had been just what he was waiting for.</p><p>He pressed Harry’s head back down against the planks of the jetty. The side of Harry’s body was getting wet from where Draco pressed up against him, but Harry was getting too lost in the heat of his mouth to really notice. Draco was hot. It wasn’t like he’d expected to find him cold, but he found himself surprised anyway. Draco’s hair was cold where it was twined around Harry’s fingers, but his mouth was a furnace Harry was happy to get lost in.</p><p>“Novelty worn off yet?” Draco asked, breathing heavily when they parted.</p><p>“You’re not letting me look,” Harry breathed, pulling him back down.</p><p>Draco made an unimpressed sound that was lost between their mouths, but he didn’t pull away. His body pressed up against Harry’s side more firmly and Harry almost reached for him before he thought about it. He wouldn’t find hips, he’d find scales. Draco couldn't get a leg on either side of him to press close.</p><p>Harry shivered and brought his other hand to Draco’s hair to so it wouldn’t wander. The last thing he wanted was Draco disappearing into the depths of the lake.</p><p>Draco shifted again, making an aggravated sound as he pulled back and rested his forehead against Harry’s.</p><p>“Why are we bothering with something so...so...”</p><p>Even at the risk of Draco bolting, Harry opened his eyes. All he saw was Draco’s expression, almost too close to focus on. It was a vulnerable thing he knew Draco would never willingly let him see. He was trusting Harry to keep his eyes closed and guilt quickly settled heavy in his belly beside the heat from their kisses.</p><p>But now that he’d looked, he couldn’t stop. Without moving his head, he looked down as best he could. He could see where Draco’s body was pressed against his side. He could even see the faintly iridescent skin bleed into scales at his hips. He couldn’t see the end of his tail, but could imagine it laying limp on the jetty.</p><p>He shifted his gaze back and let his fingers drift down from Draco’s hair. Over the warm skin of his neck until they brushed over a smooth, different texture.</p><p>With a low, almost animal sound in his throat, Draco pulled away, rolling in a fluid movement until he fell off the edge of the jetty and into the water.</p><p>Harry scrambled to the edge and uttered a low curse. Searching the water was futile. If Draco had it in his mind to flee, he’d already be beyond Harry’s reach.</p><p>With another curse, Harry flopped onto his stomach, dangling on arm over the edge to touch the water.</p><p>A moment later Draco surfaced again in front of him.</p><p>Harry stared at him, holding his breath.</p><p>“I told you not to look,” Draco finally said. He flicked water at him, but it was nothing like his usual splashes.</p><p>“That’s not what freaked you out,” Harry said, taking off his splashed glasses and tossing them behind him. They broke again and he winced. Thank Merlin for repairing charms. “It was when I touched near your gills.”</p><p>Draco’s skin flushed a pale pink as he raised a hand out of the water to cup the side of his neck. He still looked startled, wide-eyed.</p><p>“Did I hurt you?” Harry asked.</p><p>“No, I would have smacked you if you had,” Draco said, shaking his head and letting his hand fall into the water again. He quickly followed it until the water touched his chin and his gills were barely visible through the water.</p><p>Harry tracked the growing pink across his face. “So they’re sensitive then?” he asked cautiously.</p><p>Draco’s face only reddened further. “They’re how I breathe underwater, you twat! Of course they’re sensitive!”</p><p>“Come back up here,” Harry said. “Talking like this is awkward.” That and the edge of the jetty was starting to hurt where it dug into his chest.</p><p>“You come down here,” Draco scoffed.</p><p>Before he could think better of it, Harry pushed himself up, swung his legs around, and then slid off the edge of the jetty.</p><p>Just like last time, before he even had a chance to surface by himself, Draco pulled him up and pushed him up against the jetty.</p><p>“Are you serious?” he hissed.</p><p>Harry grabbed the edge of the jetty with one hand and shrugged as best he could. “You said to.”</p><p>Draco splashed water in his face and growled. “You’re going to get yourself drowned. Can you even swim?”</p><p>“Not really, but you’re here to save me, so I’ll be fine.”</p><p>Draco scowled. “Presumptuous.”</p><p>Harry ignored him. “So, your gills,” he said, looking at them now that Draco had surfaced past his shoulders again. “Touching them isn’t okay then?”</p><p>Harry’s abrupt entry in the lake had robbed Draco’s cheeks of pink, but it slowly came back as Draco stared at him. The pink moved down his neck until the patches of blue scales around the edges of his gills started to look a little purple.</p><p>His lack of answer said a lot.</p><p>“Come closer,” Harry said carefully, holding a hand out. “We can test it out and then you can know for sure.”</p><p>“Presumptuous,” Draco muttered again. But after a moment he did move closer, until he was pressed against Harry, pinning him to the side of the jetty, putting his hands on the edge to support himself. “I should drown you for this.”</p><p>Harry held back a laugh. “First you want to drown me, then you panic when I get in the water, then you want to drown me again. Make up your mind.”</p><p>Draco snorted but didn’t say anything. Instead he looked to the side, out towards the greater part of the lake. Harry took the opportunity to look at his gills up close again. Maybe touching them wasn’t a good idea. If they were damaged he wouldn’t be able to breathe underwater. Touching them at all had been so damn reckless.</p><p>“Well go on then,” Draco huffed. “The novelty won’t wear off on its own.”</p><p>Harry checked his expression, but it was like stone. “You seriously believe that’s what...no, never mind. Of course you do. Hold still.”</p><p>He pushed his concerns aside. Draco knew his own body better. If touching his gills really was dangerous, he never would have allowed it to happen. He would have swam away not moved closer. Harry wouldn’t be feeling the length of him down his front, or his tail bumping his feet every now and then as it moved.</p><p>Harry lifted his free hand from the water and brushed the outer patches of scales around Draco’s gills, where they blended away into skin.</p><p>Draco immediately flinched away, making a weak sound in his throat, one hand flying to cover his gills. His eyes were wide and directed down at the water instead of at Harry.</p><p>“You okay?” Harry asked, trying to slow the racing pace of his heart. That wasn’t a pain response, now that he got to see it. Draco face was flushed and his breathing rapid.</p><p>“It doesn’t feel like that when I touch them,” Draco muttered.</p><p>“Can I...?”</p><p>Harry reached out and slid his hand over Draco’s wrist. Draco met his gaze for a tense moment before allowing his hand to be tugged away.</p><p>When Harry brushed his thumb over the area skin became scales again, Draco’s eyes slid closed at the same time he made a loud, breathy exhale. Heat pulsed through Harry’s groin and he bit his lip and kept gently brushing that spot with his thumb.</p><p>“Is it just here at the edge or...?”</p><p>Draco shook his head as he gently brushed a fingertip along the line of a flattened gill slit.</p><p>“Edges,” he breathed, tilting his head to the side.</p><p>Harry held his breath for moment, almost expecting them to open from the stretch. But they stayed flattened. Slowly, he returned to brushing his fingertips around the edges, where patches of iridescent blue scales bled into iridescent skin. The scales were smooth, smoother than skin and he pressed harder to feel the edges of them.</p><p>Draco released a guttural sound, tilting his head even further away. Harry exhaled slowly and leaned forward until he could brush his lips along the edge of scales and skin.</p><p>“Do you think this is just a gill thing or you’re this sensitive down where the rest of your scales start too?” he asked as he brushed kisses along the edges.</p><p>This close, he could see there were no scales covering the gill flaps at all, but the skin there was the same iridescent blue as the scales bordering the overall area of his gills, and it had felt different, almost leathery. It piqued his curiosity but he filed it away to think about later.</p><p>It was already a miracle that Draco was letting him do this, if he started asking questions he’d get splashed and swiftly abandoned.</p><p>“You go anywhere near my lower body and I’ll fucking drown you,” Draco hissed softly.</p><p>Harry almost smiled at the empty threat. If Draco really wanted that to carry weight he shouldn’t freak out about Harry getting in the water.</p><p>“Might want to stop pressing against me then,” Harry breathed, kissed up his neck and along his jaw.</p><p>Draco turned into the kiss before Harry could get there. It was chaotic, biting, forceful. Harry found himself pressed even harder against the jetty, until the wood dug in enough to hurt and the there was an ominous creaking sound from the thin cross beams connecting the supports.</p><p>“You started this,” Draco said, as he broke away and moved back so suddenly Harry felt dizzy.</p><p>Harry took a moment to catch his breath as he took in how dishevelled and flushed Draco looked.</p><p>“Actually, you did,” he pointed out.</p><p>Predictably, Draco splashed him. As he wiped water out of his eyes, Harry expected to find him gone a moment later, but was surprised yet again to find him still there.</p><p>“How’s that novelty?” Draco asked, smoothing his hair back.</p><p>“Stop saying that,” Harry huffed, splashing him back for once. “I’m not here for your tail. I never even saw your tail until last night and I’ve been down here so many times I’ve lost count. Surely I’d have lost patience by now if that was what I was after.”</p><p>“Then what the hell are you doing?” Draco hissed, moving closer and looking like he actually might drag him under. “I’m trapped in this lake. I’m trapped in this body. There’s no future here. You can’t be stupid enough to want anything more than to say you’ve fucked a mer—”</p><p>“Shut up!” Harry snapped, feeling angrier than he probably should. “Just stop stalking if you’re only going to say shit like that.”</p><p>Turning, he hauled himself up onto the jetty and walked off before he said anything he might regret. Draco could know for once what it was like to be suddenly abandoned, even if Harry’s squelching loud exit wasn’t as dramatic as Draco’s almost soundless dive into the depths.</p><p>Only when he was further away did he manage to work his wand out of his sodden pocket to dry himself. It wouldn’t do for any of the students to see him walking around completely drenched from head to toe. He didn’t relish the idea of explaining that.</p><p><br/>
