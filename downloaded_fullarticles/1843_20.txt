While there was no romantic love between them they took the arranged marriage in stride and were friends. Severus and Lucius had been dating during their time at Hogwarts and had rekindled that love at the end of his son's third year. It was partly Lucius and Draco who had convinced Severus to listen to Sirius explain his side of the story and helped him escape when they found out the truth. However, Harry's bad luck had come when they realized that Dumbledore would not allow for Harry to live with his godfather and had been forced to return to the Dursleys.</p><p>Harry was devastated as well as Draco whom he had been secretly seeing with the help of Ron and Hermione since their second year. Draco had been one of the few people to believe that he was not the one endangering the school and since then they had begun a fast spiral from friends to boyfriends. Harry was surprised when Ron and Hermione had agreed to help him, but they told him that they had some atonement to do for second year as well as they saw that even though they were young Harry and Draco clearly loved each other. That summer and all the summers after per Severus' and Remus' instruction Harry kept a diary as well as a memory case filled with all of the abuse the Dursleys had done to him. If they had enough evidence then the ministry would have no choice but to put harry into someone else's care, those someones being the people currently in Severus' room discussing the future.</p><p>While Tom had come back in Harry's forth year looking completely normal it was clear something was not right with the caring and powerful man they all followed, however they were not sure what could have caused it. </p><p>"I have studied the remains of the potion and the processed used to revive Tom," Severus stated to the others,"but I cannot for the life of me say that it caused the reaction."</p><p>"Of course it didn't" Sirius said, "Your potion work is flawless and you studied for a year to figure out if it was the right potion"</p><p>"I still say it was something Dumbledore did," Lucius muttered and Remus nodded agreeing</p><p>Just as Severus opened his mouth to reply Draco burst in carrying Harry in his arms.</p><p>"Uncle Sev, Help!" he cried out</p><p>"Pup," Sirius and Remus cried out and rushed to Harry</p><p>"What happened Draco," Severus said as he rushed to his potions cupboard</p><p>"I found him walking here," Draco said breathlessly as Lucius helped him lay harry on the couch," he just came from a detention with Umbridge."</p><p>"How could a detention have caused this?" Remus asked</p><p>"look at his hand," Lucius said,"thats the mark of a blood quill."</p><p>"He has been having a detention every two or three days for the past 4 months," Draco cried as he looked down at his boyfriend</p><p>"If she did this every detention then there is not much i can do" Severus said as he came back over</p><p>"What do you mean?" sirius cried out</p><p>"I mean," the potions master replied a she looked at his patient, "that a combination of the blood loss from the blood quill as well as his blocked magic from Dumbledore is a lethal combination. I can't save him not on my own."</p><p>"So we will help love," lucius said</p><p>"No," Severus said " you cant but i know someone who can"</p><p>He paced over to the large mirror that had been a graduation gift to him and each of the marauders</p><p>"Of course," Remus breathed out</p><p>"Cast every healing spell you can think of" Severus said as he prepared the calling ritual, "and pray"</p>
