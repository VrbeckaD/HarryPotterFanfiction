    <p>•:۞:•</p><p>On the cusp of his Lordship, Mr. Percival Graves’ abrupt departure to London, Woolworth Manor was in a state of utter chaos. Every live-in member of the staff rushed around all four corners of the grand country estate. From the Dutch gardens to the high painted ceilings, everyone was in a hurry to get the stately home in order.</p><p>Two events in two days had caused an uproar throughout the household.</p><p>The first was a gossip-driven scandal that culminated in the Graves family governess being let go. The Lestrange heiress, Miss Leta, was sent back to her family in disgrace just one year inter her employ as governess for young master Oliver Graves.</p><p>Lord Lestrange was non-too-pleased that any of Leta’s supposed ‘dalliances’ couldn’t simply be overlooked by a fellow peer, but Mr. Graves was not a man to overlook improprieties.</p><p>No. The young governess had to be sent home. It was very clear that she cared more for inter-staff flirtations than her charge’s education.</p><p>Mr. Graves sighed as he passed the first floor halls of his estate.</p><p>Perhaps it was about time for a change. The young master, Oliver Graves, was getting older. He was already five years of age.</p><p>His sister-in-law, Lady Seraphina Picquery of the Ilvermorny Picqueries, had long been suggesting that boarding school would be good for the boy.</p><p>Boarding school.</p><p>Mr. Graves was loath to even consider sending his child away for so many months out of the year. Not yet. Perhaps for his secondary education, but not yet.</p><p>“When will you be leaving, My Lord?”</p><p>Mr. Graves looked up, having just finished going over the revised staff schedule for the month he’d be away</p><p>Miss Porpentina Goldstein, the head housekeeper, was pacing the front hall, wringing her pale hands, looking as anxious as she ever did.</p><p>Mr. Graves watched her with a half-amused sideways glace.</p><p>“I’ll be on the last train tonight,” he replied.</p><p>This was the second issue of the last two days.</p><p>Mr. Graves had been called to attend Parliament London. Lord Gellert Grindelwald, sanctimonious as ever, had called for a snap vote to be held in House of Lords. He had some ridiculously avant-garde new piece of legislation in mind. Since it was the esteemed Lord Grindelwald who’d called the vote, any peer who declined to attend the house sitting would be at risk of loosing his peerage and all privileges that went along with it.</p><p>“God give me strength... an entire month away revising one of Grindelwald’s backwards legislative proposals.” Mr. Graves groaned. “Perhaps I could just take Oliver to London with me.”</p><p>“Without a governess?” Tina baulked at the notion. “Would you leave him alone all day as you work? Take him to Parliament with you?”</p><p>Mr. Graves rubbed one finger over his lips. “Are you trying to contribute to my guilt?” he all-but hissed. “Because I can assure you, your additions are not necessary, Miss Goldstein.”</p><p>Tina held her tongue, looking down at the floor.</p><p>“Yes, forgive me, My Lord. I’m just worried for young master Oliver. One month with no one on staff fully dedicated to him throughout the day.” Tina looked up, her brow arching above sad eyes. “He’ll be so lonely.”</p><p>“I know, I know,” Mr. Graves sighed.</p><p>He tried to think. He had too much to do. He hated the idea of sending the boy to his aunt’s estate. Seraphina wouldn’t have time for him on such short notice. Not to mention, staying in an unfamiliar house would upset poor Ollie.</p><p>The boy needed a new minder at home, at Woolworth.</p><p>A governess? No. They weren’t going down that road again.</p><p>A full-time tutor then.</p><p>“Damn, I haven’t the time to inquire after any new staff,” Mr. Graves said, more to himself than to Tina. He ran one hand over his face, the frustration of the weeks events had drawn hard lines across handsome features.</p><p>Tine saw this his anxiety and nodded as she began formulating a plan. “I will create a schedule for you to review before you leave. My sister and the other maids can trade off minding the young master. He won’t have proper educated tutorage for the month, but–“</p><p>“Miss Goldstein, you and the others all have work to do. I don’t want you running about trying to arrange–“ Mr. Graves paused. “Miss Goldstein.”</p><p>Tina’s eyes went a bit wide and she bit her bottom lip.</p><p>“Yes, my Lord?”</p><p>“Don’t you have a child?”</p><p>Tina was appalled at the suggestion. Being an unmarried woman in household service at an estate as grand as Woolworth Manor, it would be a complete scandal.</p><p>“A child? Me?”</p><p>“No, I don’t mean–” Mr. Graves paused to find the right words. “Not your child. That orphan boy you look after. Your sister mentioned to him while she was serving the tea the other week.”</p><p>“Did she now...” Queenie... Tina pursed her lips. It wasn’t acceptable to bother the master of the house with personal trivialities.</p><p>“Yes. Mrs. Kowalski was brining the tea in and she said you were all very proud that your boy finished his studies at university. Graduated top of his class.” Mr. Graves was repeating the words in a way that he wasn’t really interested in the inane conversation, but on the plan that was forming in the back of his mind.</p><p>“Is the child back in town?” </p><p>Tina sighed. “He’s not a child anymore. But yes, I received a letter that he’s taken up lodgings in town until he can find a flat of his own.”</p><p>Mr. Graves was nodding absently. He looked up at Tine, raising his dark brow curiously.</p><p>“Do you suppose he’d be interested in the position? As Oliver’s tutor?”</p><p>Tina sucked in a breath. It was a brilliant idea, but– “Oh, I couldn’t say, my Lord. He can be very dour; I wouldn’t be surprised if he’s no good with children.”</p><p>Mr. Graves cocked his head to one side. “But, surely you wouldn’t have funded his education if you did not think him dependable.”</p><p>“You misunderstand!” Tina gasped. “He’s very responsible! And a perfect gentleman! I’m just... I haven’t exactly seen him often and... well, I just don’t know if he’d be interested in tutoring or child-minding. He seems keen on practising law.”</p><p>Mr. Graves was impressed by that. He’d been thinking about hiring an assistant, civil servitude was gruelling work. Still, in that moment his mind was too busy with the pressing matter of his son’s tutorage to further discuss any other possibilities.</p><p>“If it’s only for a month, perhaps? I can find another tutor later if your boy doesn’t wish to stay, but I’m sure he’ll find the salary worth his while.”</p><p>Tina fiddled with her sleeve as her lips pursed thoughtfully. “Well, my Lord, I’ll have to go ask this afternoon and bring him to be interviewed if he accepts and–”</p><p>Graves waved a passive hand.</p><p>“If you say he’s a gentleman, I trust you.” Graves was already heading upstairs to go pack his bags. “He can take up Miss Lestrange’s old rooms first thing in the morning.”</p><p>“Alright, my Lord, but there’s no guarantee that he’ll–“ Tina’s voice slowed as she watched Mr. Graves walk away, returning to his rooms.</p><p>With a sigh, Tina fetched her coat.</p><p>•:۞:•</p><p>Having no children of her own, no one and nothing in particular to spend money on, Tina had let the savings from her exorbitant salary build and build over the years. She wasn’t like Queenie: planning to start a little business of her own with her husband, Jacob, the chef at Woolworth; or spending money on fine lace gowns, sweets, cakes and expensive crockery for ‘when we have a place of our own’–Queenie so often liked to gush.</p><p>No. Tina did little besides work and she didn’t have much interest in anything else. It was her work at Woolworth Manor that gave her the greatest amount of pride.</p><p>However, one day, almost ten years back, everything changed.</p><p>She was in town shopping for supplies, when she came across a young boy sniffling outside the orphanage yard’s gate. He was pale and wan, his hands all scratched up, knuckles rapped bloody. Surely there was no great evil any boy could do to deserve such treatment.</p><p>That was how Tina first met Credence: a boy being punished without dinner in the cold for some ‘sin’ he’d committed–since when was not properly bushing your hair a sin?</p><p>That day, Tina crouched down and offered him the first gentle ear he’d ever had. It was a sign and from then on she became the child’s benefactor, sending money for him to the orphanage, enough to have him taken away and enrolled in a proper boarding school. Once Credence finished his secondary education there, she even secured a position at Mr. Graves’ alumnus university so he could receive their nations highest degree of education. All it took was a quick signature from his Lordship and the boy was on his way to the finest university in the land.</p><p>It was expensive, but Tina was so happy. With only a small amount of her own lavished income she was able to completely change this young man’s life.</p><p>So now, knocking on Credence’s door ten years after that first meeting on the curb outside the orphanage, Tina could only hope that he would be willing to do this small thing for her in return.</p><p>•:۞:•</p><p>Credence opened his front door with a shocked, but radiant smile on his face.</p><p>“Miss Goldstein! What a lovely surprise. And perfect timing! Come in, I just made a pot of tea.”</p><p>“Credence? Hello, you’re looking well.” Tina was surprised by the young man before her. They wrote often, but hadn’t seen each other more than a handful of times, if Credence could made it into town during the university holidays.</p><p>He’d really grown up.</p><p>Credence was far from the dour fourteen-year-old Tina remembered. His hair had gown out of that terrible bowl cut the nuns always gave him and was now waving down past his ears. He stood taller than she remembered, without the repressed hunch that he bore for years, even after leaving the orphanage.</p><p>Truly, time at university had broken him out of his shell.</p><p>“How was your graduation ceremony?” Tina asked as she sat down at the tiny table in the tiny kitchenette in Credence’s tiny rented room. “I’m sorry I couldn’t be there to see it in person.”</p><p>Credence turned around carrying a tray with a pot and two cups of tea. He set them down on the table.</p><p>“It was wonderful, Miss Goldstein. I got your letter, so you were there in spirit.”</p><p>Credence smiled as he sat down at the small table across from his patron. Though their meetings were rare, he always loved getting to sit and talk with Tina. She was truly the one person he trusted most with all things, in all his life.</p><p>“Oh, wonderful!” Tina picked up her cup and started mixing in milk and sugar, distractedly putting in far too much of both. “You had a good last year then?”</p><p>“Yes! I was almost sad to leave,” Credence sighed. “I learned a lot, but I would like more experience. Perhaps a position as a clerk in a law firm.”</p><p>Tina bit her lip. The more Credence spoke the firmer she was in her assumption that he would have no interest in the position she was offering.</p><p>“So, do you have any prospects, dear?” Tina said, too soon after a sip of too sweet tea. Her voice came out sounding a bit shrill as she continued awkwardly:</p><p>“Any work? Are you looking for work?”</p><p>Somehow, Credence didn’t notice anything suspicious.</p><p>“Yes. I’ve just started soliciting for assistant work in town. I’m just hoping earn money so I can go back to university and earn further certification,” he said.</p><p>As he bowed his head, a light blush painted his pale cheeks.</p><p>“As much as I appreciate all you’ve done for me, Miss Goldstein, I don’t want you playing my patron forever.”</p><p>Tina was smiling and nodding, but only half listening to the boy as he went on thanking her for all she’d given him over the years.</p><p>“Earning money, yes. Do you happen to have experience with children at all?”</p><p>“Oh!” Credence’s eyes lit up. “I do love children. I used to be asked to mind the little ones at the orphanage when Sister Mary–“ he stopped suddenly, noticing the earnest wide-eye look he was getting from his patron.</p><p>“Miss... What’s this about?”</p><p>Tina let out the breath she’s been holding and her entire body seemed to relax. She put down her tea and, as she did, her shoulders lowered away from where they were scrunched up nearly to her ears.</p><p>“I came on behalf of my employer, Lord Graves of Woolworth Manor. He’d like to offer you a position in the household effective, well, immediately.”</p><p>Credence actually seemed intrigued.</p><p>“Full-time employment? In a nobleman’s household? The sort of position that comes with a room on the estate?”</p><p>“Yes,” Tina was nodding. “To all of it. Yes. It’s a luxurious abode.”</p><p>“And the position?”</p><p>“Work as a tutor for Lord Graves’ young son, master Oliver Graves,” Tina replied.</p><p>“A child’s tutor?” Thus the question about children, Credence surmised. Still, he was shocked that such a role would ever fall to him.</p><p>“Surely a Lord like Mr. Graves would want one of the great minds of the country working with his son, not an orphan fresh out of his schooling,” he said, shaking his head.</p><p>“But Credence, you’re brilliant,” Tina gushed with a heartfelt sadness that he couldn’t see it too. “You were top of your class! You shouldn’t be so harsh on yourself. This is a great opportunity for your wallet for now, but you’ll be a lawyer someday soon, I know it.”</p><p>“But, I don’t know if– I didn’t study education.” Credence bit his bottom lip, finding himself anxiously mimicking Tina. “I may not be any good with the boy.”</p><p>“Oh, but Oliver’s only five and he’s such a good boy. Precious child, he just needs a friend this month. Besides, I’m sure there’s all sorts of teaching paraphernalia we can purchase. You won’t be alone in this.”</p><p>Credence felt a timid heat flare up in his chest. He was caught between wanting to jump headfirst into this new challenge and wanting to refuse all together.</p><p>It was all so sudden.</p><p>“Why does Mr. Graves need a new tutor so directly?” he asked.</p><p>Tina froze up at the question, her teacup lifted halfway off its saucer. Pursing her lips, she tried to respond without rudeness.</p><p>“The last governess was... more interested in the stable master than the child she was meant to be minding.”</p><p>“Oh, how lewd.” Credence felt his cheeks grow hot at the thought of the handsome young man who’d wooed away the governess. Some tall, swarthy man who spent his days out in the rough with the animals. God, it was like something out of one of those illicit French romance novel.</p><p>“I won’t say anything more about it,” Tina whispered, cutting into Credence’s improper musings. “Gossip is cruel. To summarize, she was dismissed.”</p><p>Credence nodded, the blush still slowly fading from his cheeks.</p><p>“So a new minder needs to replace her.”</p><p>“Exactly. You would be paid handsomely for your trouble and, though Lord Graves would have you stay on longer, just one month is all he needs.” Tina worried her lip.</p><p>“So?”</p><p>With a sigh, Credence looked around at his current lodgings. A room anywhere on a country estate would be a thousand times better than the dingy flat he was currently renting by the day.</p><p>And he loved children. They were always so sweet to him in a way that adults were not.</p><p>Shaking his head, Credence knew he had to stop thinking like that. At twenty-two, he was an adult himself now.</p><p>“I’ll come for the month,” he agreed with a sharp nod. If only as a favour to Tina, it was the least he could do.</p><p>“Oh, Credence!” Tina placed her cup and saucer down with a clatter, too ecstatic to notice she’d nearly broken the dishes. “You have no idea how god you are for doing this. Truly! You are a godsend.”</p><p>Credence just smiled.</p><p>“I should probably speak with the landlord and start packing my things.”</p><p>Tina nodded with vigour. “Please do, I will have Lord Graves’ carriage sent to collect you first thing in the morning. Since he’s in London, he won’t be using it.”</p><p>“Alright,” Credence breathed. It was all a bit much; he would have liked to talk with Tina more and get a breakdown of the people he would be working with and his situation in the house, but Tina was already drinking down the last of her tea and getting up to go.</p><p>“I must be getting back to Woolworth!” She said excitedly. She wanted to inform Mr. Graves of the good news before he was off. “The house needs to be prepared for Lord Graves’ departure and your rooms, goodness, there’s so much to do.”</p><p>“There’s no interview? Are you sure Lord Graves is alright with... all of this?”</p><p>“Of course!” Tina was almost exasperated at that point. “Credence, you’re brilliant. How well you did in school...”</p><p>A smile stretched across Tina’s lips as she reached out to touch Credence’s cheek.</p><p>Only she forgot...</p><p>Credence sucked in a sharp breath and started putting away the teacups before her hand could reach him.</p><p>Tina sighed and turned away to pull her coat back on. “I have no worries, Credence, and I am the head of the household. If I have no worries, neither does Mr. Graves.”</p><p>“Alright. I’ll try to be like you both then.” Credence stood then to show her out. “I’ll see you tomorrow then, Miss Goldstein.”</p><p>Tina clapped her hands. “I’ll give you the full tour!”</p><p>With a little laugh and a final wave, Credence closed the door behind Tina.</p><p>He leaned against a door and sighed before turning to looked over his room and the meagre belongings therein.</p><p>It would be a good experience, he promised himself.</p><p>And it wouldn’t be hard.</p><p>Just one month.</p><p>•:۞:•</p>
