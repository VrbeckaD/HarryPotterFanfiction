    <p class="western">Narcissa and Lucius Malfoy were in every respect, the perfect followers of the Dark Lord. Influential enough to have power in the Ministry, and subtle enough in their fidelity to their Lord, that if the the unthinkable were to happen, and he were defeated, they would be able to claim that their loyalty to him had been forced. And so, they lived, complacent in the knowledge that whatever happened, they would come out the best in this war.</p><p class="western">Their happiness was only increased when their son was born. A pampered child, with his father's colouring and his mother's eyes. Lucius and Narcissa doted on their first-born, even when it was more proper for purebloods to leave such early stages of childbirth to the House elf.</p><p class="western">Which was why, when Lucius came to to tell his wife some...unsettling news, it was in the Nursery that he found, cradling their two week old child.</p><p class="western">“Narcissa.” he said, his tone grave enough to merit a worried look from her. Giving the baby to the cringing house elf the corner of the room, she crossed the room to where her husband was standing and caught his hands in hers.</p><p class="western">“What is it, my love?” she asked tenderly. Surely they could not have been discovered?</p><p class="western">“The Dark Lord himself wishes to visit us. He displayed interest in Draco.”</p><p class="western">Narcissa smiled quizzically.</p><p class="western">“And why on earth does that trouble you, Lucius? If our Lord wants to honour us with his presence, I do not understand why you look as though someone had just told you Dumbledore has become Minister...”she trailed off. The grave look on her husband's face was beginning to scare her, for Merlin's sake!</p><p class="western">“Because, some of our Lord's requests were not quite, dare I say sane?” he sighed before resting his forehead against that of his wife. “But we must show our loyalty, in any case. However, I think, just in case my fears are founded that we should put in place some precautions...”</p><p class="western">A little while later, the tall pale figure of Lord Voldemort appeared, silently in front of the gates of Malfoy Manor. They opened instantly for him and stalked up the driveway, smiling coldly at the ostentatious display of wealth.</p><p class="western">“White peacocks, Lucius...” he murmured. Still, he supposed he could allow his followers their quirks, as long as they stayed loyal. And it was loyalty that Voldemort wanted now, plus a little more help. He needed to experiment, to further his power. And the Malfoys had just acquired an item with which he could do just that.</p><p class="western">So he was more than a little irritated when only Lucius was there to welcome into his home. The blond aristocrat almost cringed as he saw his master, and Voldemort allowed a hint of distaste through his usually expressionless mask. Was Malfoy <em>grovelling?</em> How pathetic.</p><p class="western">“My Lord, it is a honour, please come through, we have-” he was silenced as the Dark Lord held up a long white hand.</p><p class="western">“Spare me your pleasantries, Lucius. Did you discuss my proposal with your wife?” he asked, voice curt. Malfoy started to stammer and growing weary he resorted to his more direct method of information gathering. Crimson eyes met grey, and the Dark Lord smiled once more as he -</p><p class="western">was stopped abruptly by impenetrable mental walls.</p><p class="western">Furious in disbelief, Voldemort glared at Malfoy.</p><p class="western">“Is this treachery Lucius?” he demanded, stalking across the room, an aura of killing intent surrounding him.</p><p class="western">“No my Lord. But if you truly meant what you said earlier. If you want to <em>take my son</em> and mould him into a weapon, then I am sorry. I <em>am </em>faithful to you my Lord, never doubt that. But my loyalty to my family comes before that.” Despite himself, Voldemort was impressed. Although Lucius was clearly terrified, his voice had not shaken once, and he stood firm. But this would <em>not</em> be countenanced.</p><p class="western">“<em>Where are they Lucius? </em>You <em>dare</em> defy me???” he hissed, outraged. And as if to stoke the flames of Voldemort's fury, Malfoy was <em>smiling.</em></p><p class="western">“So I was right. You do wish to take Draco. To use magic so Dark even the <em>Blacks</em> would quail at using it.”</p><p class="western">That was it. Snapping his wand at the unexpected traitor, the Dark Lord enunciated clearly as he spoke his spell.</p><p class="western">“<em>Crucio.”</em></p><p class="western">Up in the Nursery, a tear fell as Narcissa heard her husband's scream of pain. She cradled her new-born tightly. Hugging him as tight as she dared without hurting him, she kissed him gently on his forehead. She allowed her self this one short moment of pain, fear and desperation, before pulling a pureblood mask over her features once again. She turned once more to Dobby, their House elf, and for the first time, addressed the creature with something that was neither contempt or distaste.</p><p class="western">“Dobby. Take Draco to my sister. Andromeda, Dobby, <em>not</em> Bella. He will be safe there. This letter too, make sure she gets it. I only hope she will accept my actions and not turn my son out to live in some Mudblood orphanage.” she let out a shuddering sigh, trying to hold back more tears. “Oh, and Dobby? Whatever happens, I want you to protect my son.” She paused, and the little elf's enormous eyes widened even further. “Thank you Dobby, that will be all.”</p><p class="western">“Yes Mistress!” The elf squeaked, and vanished with a loud crack. Taking Draco with him.</p><p class="western">Only then did she realise that downstairs things had grown silent. And that the Dark Lord had just appeared in the doorway.</p><p class="western">“Stand aside, you silly girl.” he said, and like her husband before her, Narcissa smiled. A sad smile, that of someone who knows that there are only seconds between them and death, and there is nothing that they can do. The smile of someone who has accepted their fate.</p><p class="western">“He is not here any longer, my Lord.” she said tonelessly. “And I doubt you will find him easily. My,” she faltered, on the verge of breaking down again. “My husband?”</p><p class="western">“Lucius did not stand up so well to my Cruciatus.” Voldemort sneered. “He broke. A pity, I suppose, but still, what use have I for either of <em>you</em>, if you betray me so easily?” he added, voice almost thoughtful. He aimed his wand at Narcissa, all precision and no passion. “Still, I am sure I can force the answer out of somehow. “ But before his spell could hit, Narcissa had already sipped the tiny bottle of poison that had been hanging from her neck, and crumpled lifelessly on the floor.</p><p class="western">The Dark Lord shrieked in wordless rage and the mirror over the mantelpiece shattered in an indignant screech. He stalked over to the body and performed a diagnostic spell. After all, Narcissa was a Slytherin, and wouldn't it be just like a Slytherin to have faked her death. But no. Unless he was wrong, and Lord Voldemort was <em>never</em> wrong, Narcissa Malfoy was most definitely deceased.</p><p class="western">He grimaced irritably. Now it would take him days to fulfil his plan, when everything was prepared now. But just then, a voice came from a pocket in his robes.</p><p class="western">“My Lord.” a fervent voice called. Ah. Severus. Smoothing his features the best he could, he drew the mirror from his robes.</p><p class="western">“What news, Severus?” he inquired. Dear god the man looked dreadful. But what he lacked in looks, Severus Snape made up for in skill, there was no doubt about that. Panting slightly the greasy haired man imparted his news.</p><p class="western">“A prophecy my Lord. I overheard at the Hogs Head. According to the Seer, one with the power to vanquish you, my Lord approaches. He will be born at the end of next month, Master.”</p><p class="western">“Tell me all you know.” He demanded imperiously. Someone who could defeat him? That was impossible surely, and yet prophecy never lied.</p><p class="western">“I did not hear much my lord.” Snape stammered. “Dumbledore caught me before I could hear everything and-”</p><p class="western">“Spare me your excuses. Tell. me. What. Was. <em>Said</em>.”</p><p class="western">“I believe it was; 'The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches...Born to those who have thrice defied him, born as the seventh month dies..' That is what I heard my Lord.”</p><p class="western">Voldemort cocked his head as he thought, before apparating to Snape's location. Once there, the dark haired man flinched in fear as the Dark Lord forced himself into the memory.</p><p class="western"><em> Those who have thrice defied me...either the Potters the Longbottoms then. And would it not be </em> so <em> more satisfying to use my own enemies as a weapon rather than those who follow me? It would be a blow to that fool Dumbledore, if his precious light magic were defeated in such a way. The Malfoy whelp can live. It is beneath me to go traipsing across the country just to use a child. No, using either a Potter or Longbottom brat has infinitely more poetry to it. </em> He grinned a predator's grin, cold and vicious. <em> And then, I will </em> truly <em> be unstoppable. </em></p><p> </p>
