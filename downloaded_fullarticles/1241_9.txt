    <p>Double potions was their last class on a Friday afternoon. Sighing gratefully, Lily Evans stirred her thick, blue mixture twice anti-clockwise and watched with satisfaction as the viscous liquid turned a deep, velvety purple.</p>
<p>“Your finished potion should be the colour of spring violets.” Professor Slughorn was announcing, standing up the gather together a tray of glass vials. “When it turns purple, please collect a sample and submit your work for marking. Don’t forget to label it, nice and clear!”</p>
<p>Lily summoned a vial from the front with a flick of her wand, pleased to see that she was the first to do so. Slughorn gave her a nod of approval and she smiled to herself as she bottled up her potion, writing “Inflammation Reducing Elixir – Lily Evans” on the front in neat cursive. She glanced at her watch, surprised to see there was still twenty minutes of the lesson left. She wondered if maybe Slughorn would let her leave early – there was a transfiguration essay they’d been set for the weekend that she’d love to get a start on before dinner…</p>
<p>The witch was dragged away from the mental list she was creating on the common properties of hedgehogs and hairbrushes when a foul smell filled the classroom, along with the sound of much complaint.</p>
<p>“Eww, what is that?” Mary grimaced, twisting around to stare at the back of the classroom.</p>
<p>Lily followed her friend’s gaze and was unsurprised to see wispy green smoke rising from a cauldron on the back row. James Potter was standing behind the offending pot, look at its contents with an expression of blank confusion.</p>
<p>Without meaning to, Lily caught Severus’ eye and saw the boy was smirking.	</p>
<p>“Not to worry, Mr Potter!” Slughorn called out kindly. “Miss Evans here has finished her potion – she can give you a hand.”</p>
<p>Severus’ smirk quickly evaporated, and Lily felt a similar expression fall from her face.</p>
<p>Grimacing at Mary, who gave her a sympathetic look, the girl gathered up her things and made her way reluctantly over to the back of the classroom. Thankfully, Sirius wasn’t in class today – the table at the back had an empty space where he usually sat. That meant she only had to endure one Marauder – though one was bad enough.</p>
<p>Dumping her books on Sirius side of the desk, Lily turned to face James, face firmly arranged in a scowl. She didn’t doubt he’d done this on purpose.</p>
<p>Strangely, James wasn’t wearing the gleeful expression she’s been expecting. In fact, he looked rather annoyed to be paired with her.</p>
<p>“Evans.” He greeted her evenly, one hand tightly grasping the desk.</p>
<p>She frowned at him in confusion for a fraction of a second, before dismissing his strange behaviour with a roll of her eyes. “Let get this over with.” Lily grumbled, and she leant over to look into his cauldron, wrinkling her nose at the smell.</p>
<p>The potion was, thankfully, the rich blue colour it was supposed to be in the penultimate stage of brewing; however, it was definitely not the right consistency. Rather than a thick liquid, Potter’s potion had congealed into a jellyfish clump at the bottom of the pot. And then there was the matter of the green smoke.</p>
<p>Lily glared at the mixture for a moment. “You added too many porcupine quills in the second stage.” She said finally, glancing up at the instructions on the board. “And you probably didn’t cut the lemon grass fine enough.”</p>
<p>Expecting a sassy remark, or at least an ungrateful grumble, the girl turned back to the boy and was frustrated to realise he was ignoring her completely, favouring a spot just over her shoulder, which he was focusing on with intent concentration.</p>
<p>The witch spun around, but the only thing behind her was, several metres away, a shelf of pickled grindylow parts. </p>
<p>“For goodness sake –” she cut off as Potter’s eyes jumped suddenly back to her, clearly struggling to focus. His hand was gripping the desk so tightly his knuckles were turning white.</p>
<p>Lily frowned, inspecting the wizard more closely. His lips were drawn in a thin line, and she could see his shoulders shaking lightly. Was he angry?</p>
<p>“Potter?” She asked, confused, as he moved to grasp the desk with his other hand too. The boy’s eyes slid shut before fluttering determinedly open and staring intently at a dark smudge on the table top.</p>
<p>“Go away Evans.” He muttered, taking a careful breath.</p>
<p>The boy was clearly trying to sound dismissive, but he hadn’t quite managed it. There was something else in his voice overriding it, and it took Lily a moment to identify the tone – it was embarrassment.</p>
<p>“Potter, what’s going on?” She asked after a careful pause, taking a step closer. “Is it the fumes? Are you nauseous?” She had to admit the rotten egg smell was getting to her a bit as well. She didn’t think she’d be having her usual omelette tomorrow at breakfast.</p>
<p>James shook his head slowly, then seemed to regret it. His eyes screwed shut dipped towards the desk, legs shaking.</p>
<p>Lily reached out a quick hand to steady him without really thinking.</p>
<p>She looked up to call for Slughorn, but the Potter seemed to sense this and before she could say a word, his hand shot up from the desk to cover hers. “Don’t say anything.” The boy hissed. “Please.” He added, in a gentler tone.</p>
<p>Lily carefully removed her hand from under his and saw a complicated emotion flit across his features.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry,” She told him, slowly. She twisted the grab a stool from under the desk and dragged it over to Potter. “Here. Sit.” She told him, and he lowered himself hesitantly down.</p>
<p>“What’s going on?” The witch repeated, but the boy resolutely ignored her. “If you tell me, I won’t call Slughorn over.” She pressed.</p>
<p>He stared up at her, and for a moment Lily forgot it was Potter at all. He seemed so different without the usual jovial, mocking look in his eyes. He looks so vulnerable, she realised for second, before quickly pushing the thought from her mind. It was still Potter. Stupid, bloody Potter.</p>
<p>“Can you cast a privacy charm?” He asked her quietly, and Lily nodded, her curiosity piqued.</p>
<p>She lifted her wand and murmured a muffliato, a spell Severus had taught her, before adding a low notice-me-not. Satisfied, she pulled the other stool over and sat down beside him, struggling to school her features. She felt oddly concerned, and she had no idea why.</p>
<p>“Look just – if I tell you this, don’t be an arse about it, okay?”</p>
<p>Lily glared at him – she was never an arse – that was his job, thank you very much – and he nodded, seemingly satisfied.</p>
<p>James started scratching subconsciously at the varnish on the desk with a bitten-down fingernail. “When I was younger,” he began, staring down at the table. “Really young, like, one or two, I had dragon pox really bad.”</p>
<p>Lily frowned. She’d read about dragon pox. It was an unpleasant illness at the best of times – but it could be very dangerous for infants.</p>
<p>“What happened?” She prompted gently, and James glanced at her, surprised at the girl’s kind tone.</p>
<p>“Well, I survived, obviously.” He told her, a little obnoxiously, before pausing. “But um, I get these moments where I feel a bit…”</p>
<p>“Green?” She joked, and Potter let out a startled chuckle.</p>
<p>“Um yeah, sort of. Dizzy, I guess.”</p>
<p>Lily nodded. “And that’s what happened just now?” She asked.</p>
<p>The boy hummed in response. “Hit just after we started brewing. Got worse as the lesson went on.” He began picking at the varnish again.</p>
<p>Lily leaned back in her chair, thinking. She told him she wouldn’t tell Slughorn, and she couldn’t exactly go back on her word.</p>
<p>“Who here knows?” She enquired politely, and James blushed.</p>
<p>“Uh. Dumbledore. McGonagall. Pomfrey obviously, and Sirius.”</p>
<p>Lily blinked. “Oh.”</p>
<p>“Yeah.” He couldn’t meet her eye.</p>
<p>The witch felt a flash of guilt. She’d forced him to confide in her something that was clearly a secret, if not even Lupin and Pettigrew knew.</p>
<p>“I won’t tell Slughorn. Or, you know, anyone else.”</p>
<p>James winced.</p>
<p>Lily wondered if he was imagining Severus finding out and grimaced at the thought. The Slytherins would have a field day with this.</p>
<p>“I really won’t.”</p>
<p>Potter nodded, seeming to believe her. “Cheers.”</p>
<p>Glancing at her watch, Lily discovered there were only a few minutes of the lesson left. She looked about and realised most of the class were in the process of packing up.</p>
<p>With a flick of her wand, the girl summoned a flask and gathered a lump of Potter’s failed potion into it. She passed it to the boy and he scratched his last name onto the brown label with a shaky hand, leaving a large drop of ink at the base of the ‘P’.</p>
<p>“Are you feeling okay now? Will you need help getting back to the tower?”</p>
<p>The wizard ran a hand over his face, rubbing at his eyes.</p>
<p>“Look, I shouldn’t have told you…” He began. “I was panicking, I wasn’t thinking.”</p>
<p>The witch didn’t say anything, watching James closely as he grimaced. “Can you just go away?” He said at last.</p>
<p>Lily blinked, shocked at the sudden change in tone. Almost at once, the barrier that she hadn’t even noticed was beginning to slip down between them sprung back up.</p>
<p>“There’s no need to be rude.” She told him, crossly. “I’m trying to help.”</p>
<p>“Well don’t. I don’t need it.”</p>
<p>Lily frowned at him before reaching to gather her things with a huff. “Fine.” She said. “See you around, Potter.”</p>
<p>“Whatever.” He muttered, and Lily strutted off, angrily dragging down the mufliato and notice-me-not as she went.</p>
<p>The girl headed quickly up to the front of the classroom to hand in her potion sample. She had been planning on taking Potter’s with her to save him the journey, but his surly attitude made her change her mind.</p>
<p>“Ah, Miss Evans.” The Professor Slughorn took her vial, peering at the violet mixture with a pleased smile. “Perfect as always. I trust you were able to assist Mr Potter?”</p>
<p>Lily scowled. “Unfortunately not.” She told him, before hastily making her way over to Mary. On their way out of the classroom she saw Potter was still at his desk, tidying his ingredients away slowly. He didn’t look up as she passed, and she determinedly suppressed the uneasy feeling that fluttered in her chest.</p>
