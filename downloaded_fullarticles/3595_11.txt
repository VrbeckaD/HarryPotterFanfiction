  <em>October 25, 1981</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Gone. In a blink of an eye, they were all gone. Taken from this world, taken from her, from <em>them</em>.</p><p>Jenna Blair was sitting on the pavement, her back facing the now empty house that use to hold so much life. So much warmth. Tears racing down her cheeks, an involuntary whimper escaped her lips. A baby girl sleeping soundlessly, cradled safely in her arms. While a young boy, held onto the only family he had left. His face buried in her sweater, crying silently. The world around her was moving in slow motion. The distant sounds of a few Auror’s entering the house to investigate did not comfort her, but only serve as a reminder of what took place only a half-hour ago. The images of what she witnessed tonight. Her sister, her brother, her brother-in-law. Dead. Gone; taken from her, from their <em>children</em>. A choked sob escaped her mouth.</p><p>Rustling from her right caught the attention of the eldest child, he held onto his aunt tightly. Terrified that whoever attacked his parents were coming back. Instead, a man with shoulder length dark hair and worried grey eyes showed up. Kneeling in front of the small group. Her vision was blurry from the tears, but she recognized the voice immediately. It was the man she loved; Sirius Black. “Jenna...”</p><p>“They’re gone!” She cried, breaking down. “Elizabeth… Alaric… Christian… they’re gone!”</p><p>Sirius looked at her, his eyes soft and sadden. It pained him to see the woman he loved in so much despair. He wanted nothing more than to hug her tight; tell her that everything will be alright, but he knew better. He saw the Dark mark above the house behind them. Knew of the meaning. She didn’t have to tell him. The Death Eaters had attack and killed. That was the reason he was here, knowing that she’d be visiting her sister. Oddly, they failed to finish off the children, which he suspected was because Jenna had arrived just in time.</p><p> “I’m so sorry.” He whispered, closing his eyes tightly when she cried harder.</p><p>“What am I going to do? The children... I can’t… I can’t watch over them! I’m 21! They need… They need their parents…” Jenna sobbed unceasingly, holding the sleeping toddler closer. Scared that she’d lose her as well if she’d let go. “I’m terrified… I can’t raise two young children. I can’t financially. I’m not even sure I can be a good mother-figure.” Breathing heavily, gulping for breath. This was too much.</p><p>Taking her face with both his large hands, starring into her beautiful green eyes. “Jennifer Blair, listen to me, you can do this. They need their aunt more than anything right now. I know you can do this, I believe in you. You’re a Gryffindor, you’re the bravest woman I know.” Using his thumb to wipe away her tears “I’ll help you any way I can.” Noticing the young boy trembling, curled up next to his aunt, an attempt to get some warmth no doubt.</p><p>“My dear, we should get all three of you home.” He tried softly. “It’s freezing, and the children are shivering.” Coaxing her to stand up from the cold floor. She felt the pain weighing her down, having trouble to speak from the grief, the guilt of not having been there sooner, maybe she could have prevented this. The fear and unknown of having to raise two young children so suddenly. The toddler moved a little, having been woken up from the commotion around her. The first thing Sirius saw when she looked up at him, were those bright chestnut brown eyes. The same ones as her father’s, Christian O’Connor. Jenna trembled, taking a huge breath of frosty air, she had to be strong, Sirius was right, they needed her more than anything “Damon… Come.” She whimpered.</p><p>“Let me bring her.” Sirius soft voice touched her ears. Nodding, she let him hold her niece. Taking another deep breath, Jenna straighten herself and took hold of her nephew’s little hand. Taking her wand out, both adults nodding and apparated to her house.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
  <em>4 years later…</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>“Aunt Jenna! I got my Hogwarts letter!” </em>
</p><p>This was the reason why on a warm summer day, Jenna had taken her nephew and niece to Diagon Alley for the first time. Earlier this morning, her nephew had gotten his Hogwarts letter. Unable to stop herself from chuckling, seeing their amazed expressions when they walked down the alley was adorable. So much to see, so many different shops with all their unique products. Once the initial shock had worn off, Damon looked over his school list, but glanced in every window as they passed, and Naomi just looked around, trying to take in everything. The first stop they had to make was at Gringotts Wizarding Bank. Coming out an hour later with the required money and a very pale looking Damon. “I don’t like carts. I hate carts.” He mumbled, trying very hard to not vomit on the stone path. Naomi, on the other hand, wanted to go for a second ride.</p><p>“Aunt Jenna, I need school uniforms, I can get those here?” Damon asked, looking up with a frown. Still looking quite pale.</p><p>His aunt chuckled and nodded. “Yes, at Madam Malkin’s Robes.”</p><p>They arrived at the shop and were in luck, she had just finished with another Hogwarts student. While Damon stood on the stand, Madam Malkin’s was fixing up his uniform robe. Jenna smiled fondly at her nephew, he had grown so much. It’s been four years since the lost of their parents, it hadn’t been easy on any of them, including herself. She wished Elizabeth could be here right now to see her son, to see him off to Hogwarts. She was brought out of her thoughts when she heard her nephew ask, “Aunt Jenna, where is Naomi?”</p><p> </p><p align="center">.  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .</p><p align="center"> </p><p>Curious chestnut brown eyes glanced around, staying at the robes shop had become too boring for little Naomi. A wizard passing by the shop with an owl in a cage had caught her attention, wanting to see it closer she had left without anyone noticing her. At first it was fun exploring this new place, it felt like she was on some big adventure. Unfortunately, as time passed, she couldn’t find her way back to her aunt and brother. Panic started to rise within the small seven years old. There were too many wizards and witches, no one she recognized. Tears streamed down her cheeks, sitting down in front of some store, scared and alone.</p><p>“Why are you crying?” Naomi looked up at the sound of a young boy’s voice. Standing in front of her, two identical twins with fiery flaming hair, brown eyes and freckles. Additionally, they seemed to be the same age as her. She sniffed and rubbed her eyes, telling them that she was lost and wanted her mum. One of the twins bent down to her level and smiled “Don’t cry, we’ll help you find your mum, I’m Fred, that’s my brother George, and you are?”</p><p>“I think she knows we’re brothers Fred! We’re twins!” George replied, crossing his arms over his chest.</p><p>Naomi giggled and both twins smiled “My name is Naomi.”</p><p>“A pleasure to meet you, Naomi!” Both twins said in unison. The twin named George extended his hand for her to take. Helping the young little girl off the ground, they were almost the same height, the twins slightly taller than she. “We’ll bring you to our mum. She can help you find your mum.”</p><p>They didn’t have to go looking very far, a short, plump woman with the same flaming fiery red hair, was rushing towards them. Two boys following her closely, one looked to be about four years old while the other looked older than the twins, possibly eight years old? The woman had a look of anger, yet relieved when she saw the twins “Fred! George! There you are! I’ve been looking- What have you two done this time?!” The twin’s mum exclaimed upon seeing the little girl. Molly Weasley starred down at her two sons, then at the girl, her eyes softening.</p><p>“We didn’t do anything!” Both twins defended themselves.</p><p>Their mother looked at them suspiciously before kneeling to the little girl’s height. Giving her a motherly, gentle smile. “What’s the matter, sweetie?” Even her voice was much kinder than when she spoke to her boys. More tears fell from Naomi’s eyes.</p><p>“I’m lost, I want my mummy.”</p><p>Molly gave her a tender smile, extending her free hand, which the little girl took without hesitation. “Then let’s go find your mummy. What’s your name, sweetie?”</p><p>“N-Naomi.”</p><p>“Naomi, what a lovely name. Percy, you keep an eye on the twins. Don’t leave them out of your sight.” She turned to her eldest son, to which he nodded reluctantly. Eyeing both his younger brothers suspiciously while they grinned back at him. All six of them walked down the alley, looking for Naomi’s family. To help with the search, Molly had asked what her mother looked like, and was confused when the little girl told her she didn’t remember. So, they looked around the crowded alley, hoping to spot them.</p><p>“Naomi!”</p><p>Jenna, with a relieved cry, rushed towards the group with Damon at her sides. Taking Naomi into her arms, hugging her tightly. “Thank Merlin you’re safe! Don’t you ever scare me like that ever again young lady.” Staring with all the seriousness she could muster into the little girl’s eyes. Once she got a nod from her niece, she smiled at the little one.</p><p>“Jennifer Blair?” Jenna looked at the older woman and gasped softly. Molly was staring at the younger witch, so many questions, worries, but she couldn’t bring herself to voice them all. They hadn’t seen each other since the funeral of Christian and Elizabeth. She had sent owl after owl, wondering how she was doing. The few that she got back, weren’t very detailed. The guilt over took her, she could have written back more often. Could have even visited her. She knew how much Molly adored Elizabeth’s children, which only made her feel worse.</p><p>Elizabeth had been Molly's closest friend since Hogwarts. After graduation, they stayed in contact, going over for tea, their oldest children would play together. Finding out what happened to Elizabeth and her husband was devastating. Mrs. Weasley looked down at the two young children and tears gathered in her eyes. Why hadn’t she noticed how much the little girl looked like her mother? The little boy, so much like his father, but with his mother’s kind eyes. “I should have known. She looks so much like her mother. They’ve grown so much since last time I saw them.”</p><p>“Mrs. Weasley, I’m terribly sorry. I didn’t mean… I should have… I’m sorry.” Jenna apologized. She didn’t need to say more; the older woman gave her an understanding smile. She understood the struggle the young witch was going through, having lost both her brothers in the war as well. It was challenging times and Molly would never dare hold it against her.</p><p>“Don’t sweetie, I understand.” Placing a hand on the younger woman’s shoulder in a comforting way. “Need to continue shopping for Bill’s and Charlie’s school books. Please come over for tea some time, and I won’t be taking 'no' for an answer.” Adding quickly when the young woman was about to say she didn’t want to be a burden. After agreeing, Molly smiled at the little family before walking away with her sons. The twins waving goodbye to Naomi, which she returned.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
  <em>4 years later…</em>
</p><p> </p><p>“You behave yourself, got it? I want you to send an owl once you’ve been sorted telling me which house you’re in, tell me how your first week went, I want to know everything.” Jenna fussed over her niece. Straightening her jacket, her nephew standing next to her, rolling his eyes at their aunt in amusement. It was like this every year. “You have everything? Not missing anything?”</p><p>“Aunt Jenna, I’m sure I’ve got everything, I will send you an owl after my first week, and I promise to not get into trouble.” Naomi said, beaming. Today was her first day at Hogwarts, she was finally going to the school her brother had kept talking about for years. The school her parents attended. Jenna smiled, trying very hard not to cry.</p><p>“Alright, watch over your sister. Damon, I’m warning you, no owls and please, please stop getting into detention.” She begged her nephew.</p><p>“Not my fault! Its that greasy hair git that keeps giving me detention for no reason!”</p><p>“The train is about to leave, come on, give me a hug.” After hugging each one, they embarked onto the Hogwarts Express. Opening the windows and waving at their aunt as the train began to move away from King’s Cross Station. Once the train station was out of eyesight, Damon went to find his friends, Naomi following, looking inside compartments to see if there were any empty ones. She didn’t get far until something cold and slimy fell on her head. The sound of a bucket hitting the floor right behind her rang in her ears.</p><p>Her brother turned when hearing the commotion, seeing his sister wipe slime from her face. Damon’s mouth was slightly opened in stun silence. Two identical heads popped out of a compartment, their brown eyes opened wide when they noticed that the victim of their prank wasn’t the one they were hoping.</p><p>“We’re terribly sorry, you have to believe us, that prank wasn’t meant for you.” George walked up, trying to explain.</p><p>“That prank was for our older brother, Percy.” Fred explained, slightly disappointed it didn’t work. Both twins backed away when she glared at them.</p><p>“You did this?!” The sounds of other students snickering and laughing only fueled her anger. She felt humiliated and they haven’t even arrived at Hogwarts. Wonderful way to start her first year.</p><p>“It wasn’t meant for you!”</p><p>Damon cleared his throat, walked passed the twins, giving them a glance before smiling a little at his sister “Its okay, Nao, let me fix this.” Waving his wand, muttering a spell, and the goo was all gone. Yet it didn’t take away the embarrassment she felt. Her eyes had never left Fred and George, muttering a thanks to her brother, Naomi turned and stormed opposite from the twins, promising herself to get them back.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
  <em>2 months later…</em>
</p><p> </p><p>After arriving at Hogwarts, during the sorting ceremony Naomi and the Weasley twins were sorted into Gryffindor. The next morning at breakfast, Fred and George, unknowingly, had their cereal bewitched. When they both went to put their spoons in the bowl, milk and cereal blew up in their face. Naomi was grinning, trying hard to hide her giggles, both twins quickly figured out that she was behind it. From then on, an all-out prank war began between the three. Which was the reason why they were in detention tonight. During potions, the three of them thought it would be funny to prank the other. Sadly, neither ideas went as planned. The prank that was meant for Naomi had, unfortunately, hit Professor Snape. While advancing intimidatingly towards the twins, who he figured were at the base of this prank, he got hit with another prank, which was meant for Fred and George.</p><p>Naomi apologized repeatedly, taking the entire blame. Fred and George starred at her in complete amazement, she was ready to get punish for both pranks. The brother’s looked at each other, deciding that they weren’t going to let her take all the blame.</p><p>“Professor, it was us!” George said.</p><p>“Naomi had nothing to do with those.” Fred added, motioning to the pranks. Naomi looked at both twins, her eyes wide when they in turn took responsibility. Denying her involvement of any kind.</p><p>“Detention. All three of you.” Snape said through gritted teeth, glaring at the trio “And 30 points from Gryffindor!”</p><p>Which was the reason why all three were now polishing the trophy room, without using magic, very much passed curfew. Filch, who was monitoring the detention, had rushed out when the school’s poltergeist, Peeves, had caused some ruckus down the hall. It was silent between the trio for some time until one of the twins, Fred, spoke. “You know, that was a pretty good prank.”</p><p>“It was brilliant.” George grinned.</p><p>Naomi giggled, “Thank you. May I add, yours was hilarious. Professor Snape’s face was <em>priceless</em>.”</p><p>All three looked at each other before breaking into a fit of laughter. Fred and George mimicking the faces that Snape had made in Potions, causing Naomi to howl with laughter. The rest of their detention was spent talking about the days event and cleaning. After that night, the twins and Naomi became very good friends.</p>
