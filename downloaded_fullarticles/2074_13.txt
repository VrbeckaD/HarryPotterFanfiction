    <span>“I’m not ready for you to go.”</span>

    <span>“We always knew this day would come, Siri.”</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“Yes, but not yet.”</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“You gave me everything I thought I’d never have. Now it’s your turn.”</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“But-”</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“No, promise me. Promise me you’ll find a husband and the two of you will raise our kids right. You deserve all the happiness you’ve given me and everyone else in your life. Be a little selfish for once, love. For me?”</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“I love you.”</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“I know you do. Thank you for everything.”</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>

  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“Thank you, Siri. Love you and the kids. Forever.”</span>
  </em>

  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>The redheaded healer peered inside, before stepping in and closing the door behind her. “Are you alright.”</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“Of course not. This has been a long time coming, but even still there’s no way to be ready for your best friend’s death. Still,” he sniffed, rising from the chair, “I have to go tell the children.” He brushed the hair back from his wife’s forehead, pressing one last kiss to the painfully young, smooth dark skin there. “I leave her in your hands then.”</span>

  <em>
    <span>It was a struggle not to look back, not to cling to the past and the safety of the lie he and Aria had worked so hard to create, but he squared his shoulders and left the room, dreading the task of telling their children that their mother had passed.</span>
