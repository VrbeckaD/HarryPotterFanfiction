    <p align="center">Prologue</p><p>Harry knows this world, not because he had <em>lived</em> on this planet, but because even he watches television and reads in his spare time. Living for as long as he had, you find yourself with a lot of time on your hands. Some worlds lack certain types of media just as others have it in abundance. He knows that the world he lives in might be different from the world he read about. It’s not the first time things don’t line up perfectly.</p><p>In other lives, Harry had managed to get his hands upon the books and movies based around his life and found numerous inconsistencies, some versions come closer to the truth than others. Perhaps in other worlds, they are the truth for those versions of him, in all honesty, it makes it easier to read. The knowledge that the books aren’t a morbid echo of his life and the consequences that resulted from them. After all, they didn’t detail just how far the Dursleys abuse had gone, didn’t mention just how much of a puppet he turned out to be, Dumbledore’s little martyr, created just the way he liked. A lot more people adored Snape and hated his father, which was awkward. He might have forgiven Snape but that didn’t mean he had forgotten what he had done.</p><p>It brushed off the consequences of collecting the three Hallows, the ending had caused a disconnect – him married to Ginny, three kids with <em>very</em> unfortunate names, and the ‘Golden Trio’ in some stage of middle-aged contentment in their lives while skipping the aftermath of Britain’s Wixen War. Not to say he had anything against Ginny, it was just the fact that Ginny outgrew her crush on him and they never had anything more than a sibling-like bond during his life, or the fact Hermione, Ron and himself had drifted apart as they moved on.</p><p>The aftermath of war had been a time of revelations and healing, Harry had been in dire need of healing. He had gotten the ministry to pay him restitution for his actions during the war – it had gone to the Goblins, so they could repair their damages and they had been reluctantly impressed. They had already begrudgingly respected him for getting past their revered security and for his merciless claiming of the estates of Voldemort’s followers as spoils of war. After all, that mark they had so revered was a <em>thrall brand</em>. What belonged to them belonged to Voldemort and as the one who killed him, Harry had been the one to claim it by rite of conquest.</p><p>Harry was aware that his actions gathered no favors, especially since the ministry sought to claim the estates of the dark families that had been wiped out only to be told that they were already claimed in their entirety. The one who claimed them was unknown and the ministry had seethed while Harry was seen to by a Goblin healer.</p><p>Said Healer had snarled in the language of their kind whose name was unpronounceable by human vocal cords, her voice had been rough though comprehendible as she detailed what had been wrong with him and what they managed to heal. Honestly, by the end of it, Harry rather uncharitably thought that what <em>wasn’t</em> wrong with him might have made a shorter list.</p><p>There had been an untold number of wards, geasa, spells, glamour’s, potions and blocks that needed to be flushed from his system, admittedly, they were surprised he was still alive since he was stuffed to the gills and spelled within an inch of his life. Honestly, the fact he could make decisions for himself was a miracle and a testament to his strength. Harry hadn’t felt strong when he was given that knowledge, had been forced to acknowledge that Dumbledore had truly seen him as nothing more than a chest piece in need of maneuvering into just the right situations to ensure his spell work was performing perfectly. He had forgiven Dumbledore then as well, though he knew that he would never forget or trust in the elder man again.</p><p>The results of his healing had been rather surprising nonetheless as his current amount of physical activity and muscle mass had been applied to his newly improved healthy body. The first thing he had originally noticed was that he could see but the first time he saw himself in a mirror had been rather bewildering.</p><p>Unknown at the time, Sirius had adopted him shortly after he was born so Harry would be his undisputed heir. Which resulted in Harry becoming a metamorphmagus seeing as Lily being a first gen had meant that her blood acted as a purifier and allowed Harry to inherit the Family gifts, much like Andy marrying her Ted had resulted in their daughter being a metamorphmagus.</p><p>Harry’s looks echoed that fact, once the wards, geasa, spells, glamour’s, and blocks were removed, well, he could hardly recognize himself. There was still his father in the curve of his brow, his mother in the shape of his eyes and the color, a mix of them both making his nose but, the lines of his jaw and cheek, the plush of his lips, the thick black lashes and even thicker hair, that was all Black even if his skin tone was a lighter tone of bronze than James’s had been. It quietly broke his heart to see those Black characteristics, to remember Sirius. He couldn’t regret it though and so he moved on, returning to Andy and Teddy after reinstating them both into the Black Family and making Teddy Heir Black. He ensured Teddy wouldn’t be taken advantage of like he had been.</p><p>The Wizarding World acted as though Harry James Potter was something they owned, and that Harry should have been thankful for the privilege – which was why Harry had first stayed close to Teddy and Andy before traveling once Teddy began to move on with his life. If they found out about Harry’s abilities, they would have demanded he does his duty and birth a bunch of baby Potter’s to carry on his name and be married off.</p><p>Turns out the Potter Family had once been fertile as <em>fuck</em> with some <em>additions</em> to the men of their line. One out of five male Potters would be born intersexed, appearance more androgynous so they could pass as women amongst the mundane since their bodies would be affected. Feminine pelvises along with the birthing canal and womb found in those born with the ability to become impregnated. In the times of before, Potter’s had been highly sought out for their fertile women and the men who had the ability to carry young. While magic could allow two men to have a child together, it was unfortunately just as common for the said man to end up with their pregnancy declared as high risk and in need of constant bed rest and monitoring. Men were not biologically capable of both carrying and birthing a child without risk of death or miscarriage. Which would then result in an infection since the only way to remove the child would be surgical. The only other choice had been human transfiguration, which would temporarily change the man’s sex, so they <em>could</em> birth the child with less risk, but most men suffered from gender dysphoria and depression. When the child was born postpartum depression was also common and so most men hesitated to take such risks.</p><p>Potter’s born with the family gift, however, were usually some form of gender fluid, gender-neutral, or non-binary, and thus were not bothered by the fact that they could carry or sire children if that was what they desired. Some Potters – just like all people – declined to have children.</p><p>Unfortunately, people’s depravity became known as Potter’s became just as known as perfect broodmares, forced to birth child after child <em>after child</em>. It had been kept secret, but intersexed Potter’s had a special bond with their children and having those bonds constantly broken when their children were taken away broke them in turn. Their body and magic turned against them until they quietly slipped away into Death’s embrace.</p><p>He couldn’t remain in Britain after everything that happened, especially with his newly realized abilities which helped him remain under the radar as he used his metamorphism to make himself look like the runty Potter people remembered. Once he left he happily ignored the MoM’s demand to return, likely their attempts to shackle him and force him to <em>do his duty</em>. As though they had not stolen enough from him and after some time they gave up, enough years have passed that they finally got it through their thick skulls that he wasn’t going to return just because they wanted him to.</p><p>However, it was on his travels that Harry realized a very important thing when he reverted to his original looks. Instead of seeing the age he had expected – that he had subconsciously been adding to his metamorphized looks – instead he looked just as young as his early twenties. It was a surprise and he hesitantly wondered if his age was going slower because of the fact he was an archmagi.</p><p>There was a difference in power levels that a wix is born with, such as a blocked core wix aka squib or a third tier wix being a Master Witch or Wizard. Mage’s were known as the most powerful amongst their brethren and when Harry had gone to a custom wand shop following the day his phoenix and holly wand no longer <em>fit</em> as well as it used to, he had been slightly surprised by the vast changes. His power levels were in the highest tier and had been Emerald, ironic but meaning that he had the potential to become an archmage. Thankfully, the wandmaker hadn’t asked and instead requested that he find resonance amongst the wand woods and then the core or cores for his wand.</p><p>The resulting wand was beautiful, eleven and a half inches, with a moderate balance between stiff and flexible. The handle and base were beech with an inlay of white willow in an interlocked latticed knotwork design along the body of the wand. A natural polish used, the wand had a core of braided basilisk heartstring, thestral tail hair, and demiguise fur. It also didn’t hinder his abilities towards using non-verbal or even wandless magic since wands like Ollivander’s were very much a crutch. He had the wand bound to him with his blood, so no one could ever take it away like he took Draco’s wand all those years ago. It had been remarkable to feel the difference between his new wand and his original one and led to him realizing that perhaps his holly wand was never really his in the first place. After all, Voldemort’s Horcrux had left its mark upon him, perhaps the wand had matched him because of it.</p><p>So, with that in mind, Harry assumed that his age had simply slowed as was common amongst wixen who had high power levels, though of course, Harry is never that lucky. The hallows were more than myth it turned out and Death was unamused over being ignored, not that Harry had intended to do that in the first place. It took time for Harry to accept the fact he was semi-immortal, and Death became <em>clingy</em>, remaining ever-present at the back of Harry’s mind. Though there were times where he left to oversee his duty and ensure people were dying like they were supposed to. Death always hated those who tried to cheat him, though Harry seemed to be the only exception.</p><p>So, Harry lived his life, traveled, learned and took advantage of his previously blocked abilities and reveled in the fact no one could recognize him. Then, Death offered more adventure, offered him the ability to cross dimensions, to be reborn with the belongings he carried around with him since he didn’t trust the ministry not to attempt to lay claim to his inheritance.</p><p>Death had laughed and <em>laughed</em>, fondly calling him a magpie and musing that those long-buried Ravenclaw tendencies were finally shining through. They had, Harry read books and grimoires without having to fear being bitten since he was their new Lord and he soaked up theory, runes, history, etc. He found a new love for potions, found out the extent of his metamorphmagus abilities – Tonks act of taking on animal characteristics had been amazing but it seemed Tonks had been in the third tier when it came to magical power and thus lacked the ability to change her shape entirely. With Death’s voice in his ear, he found a tribe of metamorphmaguses and while they were hesitant, in time he managed to gain their trust and then their fondness.</p><p>They taught him how to turn into an animal and back, had taught him about how to turn into magical creatures – though few could manage that much. To fly with a phoenix’s wings had been <em>exhilarating</em>.</p><p>Soon, however, Harry had done what he could in his world and he took Death up on his offer. Though, being reborn hadn’t been what he had expected. Some lives started over from the beginning, others started when his vessels' original soul died, and he ended up being slipped inside by Death. Sometimes they were adults and most of the time they were children. Harry had grown to acknowledge his rather gray toned morality. Dumbledore might have manipulated him into being a hero and a martyr, but Harry was above all else a survivor and survivors were rarely ever naïve or trusting as Dumbledore forced him to be.</p><p>He grew used to it, grew to enjoy the freedom he gained when he was reborn into the different universes. Death ever-present with him and the Lord of Riches seemed to enjoy his endless curiosity and excitement. His magic followed him in most of his lives, especially the Potter fertility and Black Metamorphism. Though the Potter Gift was more obvious in the lives he was born male, Death fondly amused at the back of his mind and ‘helpfully’ pointing out that it would be useful if he desired to use it since Harry’s tastes were distinctly <em>masculine</em>. Though, they made an agreement that the strictly mundane lives he lived would lack such biology since some of his parents were not so open-minded. Death agreed the first time he was abused and nearly died from neglect because he did not fit within the gender binary.</p><p>Living for as long as he had, he knows this world, but he knows he is not originally meant for it.</p><p>Though, it isn’t the first time he had been placed in a world that had originally been thought of as fiction.</p><p>
  <em>Really Death, <strong>this</strong> world?</em>
</p><p>
  <strong>You did say you were bored.</strong>
</p><p>Well… He had him there.</p>
