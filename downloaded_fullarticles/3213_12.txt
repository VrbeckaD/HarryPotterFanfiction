  <b>Prologue</b>
</p><p align="center"> </p><p>
  <span>There is an evil in this world. Hatred, sickness, death and destruction. Harry reckons he’s seen those evils with his own two eyes. He’s seen death, he knows of hatred and sickness and all too familiar with destruction. He tries to not dwell in them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Because there can be no good without evil. No life without death, no health without sickness, no love without hatred and no peace without destruction. He knows this because he’s seen them too. He’s seen love and life. Peace and health. Whether he’s experienced them or not doesn’t matter, because he’s seen them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>For now, though, he knows he hasn’t great health in him and barely living.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Dying turns out to give your body some negative consequences. The soul powers the body, the state of mind, but when that body is broken, your soul can still reside in the host shell but the physical state of the body won’t be very good.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>In fact, Harry can barely breathe without the help of various healing spells and potions. His heart sometimes stutters under the pressure of simply walking and his blood flows sluggishly. What can you expect, really? His body had just </span>
  <em>
    <span>lost</span>
  </em>
  <span> life and then is expected to work again in fine condition. Unlucky for Harry, it doesn’t work like that.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Then again, he’s lucky he was able to escape death like that. He has a good feeling about returning to Hogwarts for his final year, this year. He thinks it’s going to be the time where he’ll be able to really </span>
  <em>
    <span>live,</span>
  </em>
  <span> even if his lungs begin to ache and he tires easily than he would have when he was younger.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He needs to be grateful for the luck he’s been given now, even if he only ended up like this because of a truly shit hand given to him by fate.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He sits on a small sofa, looking out the lawn of the Weasley’s house, and basking in the sunshine. He likes warm weather. He’s come to dislike the cold and snow. There are just a few more months before he goes back to Hogwarts. It makes him excited and very anxious -- nervous -- thinking about seeing the great castle he thinks of as a home again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Teddy Lupin, son of Tonks and Remus, sleeps in his arms. He’s so small and fragile. Harry didn’t know a thing about kids, but he likes Teddy. He looked a bit odd when he first saw him, like a pink mole but now he inherits Remus’ skin and traces of Tonks’ face. He looks more like a human now. That’s a bit mean to say, (</span>
  <em>
    <span>Sorry Remus, Tonks,</span>
  </em>
  <span> Harry apologised in his head) but it’s true. Babies are weird.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He wishes that Teddy still had his parents to love him and guide him when he’s older. But he can’t turn back the time, he knows the maximum capacity of Time Turners after Sirius died and he drowned in grief.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He wishes Sirius was still alive too. He wishes that Dobby had a better life after he was freed than being killed by Bellatrix. He wishes Fred still roamed the house with George because he hates seeing George avoid mirrors and hearing himself talk like the plague. He wishes that he had been quicker and saved everyone.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He wishes his parents were still alive, but he’s accepted that they’re dead a long time ago. He doesn’t know them, not really.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>To be honest, he wishes for a lot of things that can’t be changed. He wishes he’d taken the train to nowhere and died on the forest floor. He doesn’t really like his life now, despite what he says. He gained and lost a lot. His own body is too broken to function and he can’t eat a proper meal without wanting to die. He hates this incessant feeling of keeping a sort of darkness that threatens to swallow him at bay. Constantly fighting in his head, even if the war is over.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He hears Ron shout for him:</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Harry! Come on! Mum’s made pavlova and I don’t think it’ll last!”</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Be grateful, Harry,</span>
  </em>
  <span> he thinks to himself, standing and lifting baby Teddy closer to his chest. </span>
  <em>
    <span>There are others who have it worse than you.</span>
  </em>
