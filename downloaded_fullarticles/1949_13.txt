    <p>
  <span>I move faster, glancing over my shoulder again. My uncle had been furious, blustering around like he was actually going to kill me this time.  So far, he had stayed to scream at the night sky that Aunt Marge had faded into.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I rub at my arm as I turn back to focus on the path in front of me. My arm had snapped under uncles anger three days ago and while I had repaired it, it was still weak and ached. The bruise across my face wasn’t as bad as it had been this morning, but I hadn’t stopped to heal it properly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It takes less time then I think it should to get to the Leaky Cauldron. I had managed to wrap my magic around the trunk I had bought first year and had it shrunk small enough to go into my pocket. It had taken another minute to get it light enough to go into my pocket and not rip a hole in it. So I wasn’t dragging that around like a loon, but still, a soaked, bedraggled, beaten boy showing up at the door was a shock to the bartender. I wasn’t sure what his name was, Tom was the owner but I’ve never talked to him personally besides the whole ‘you’re Harry Potter Merlin’s Beard this is amazing’ incident in my first year. This bartender was younger, took one look at me, and dragged me inside and to the back room.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What ya doin’ in the rain boy?” he snaps, his accent startling me. Before I can answer he’s flicking his wand in several directions, casting a dozen charms in half a second. My clothes dry, my hair is a poofed mess as I shake it out from his drying charm. I pat myself down and besides feeling warm and refreshed, I don’t feel much different.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I, uh, wanted a room for the night,” I say as evenly as I could. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Did ya have a guardian book ya a room?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Uh, no?” I answer, pushing my hair out of my face to see the man more. His eyes zero in on the left side of my face, and his stern look softens.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Alrigh’ boy. I’ll sign off as ya guardian, so’s long as you plan on payin’. School starts in a month. Ya stayin’ ‘til then?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If I could.” I hesitate to answer, hoping he doesn’t get angry again. Now that I know he’s not angry at me I focus. He has blond hair and blue eyes. A rough beard touching his chest and his hair pulled back in a tight tail. He was also massive, twice as tall as I was and could probably pick me up from the top of my head with one hand.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Stay there.” he points to where I’m standing and I watch him disappear in a back room. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He comes back less than five minutes later with a covered tray, a tub of paste, and a key.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Room 10 is open. Take this up. Ya eat, take a bath, and ya put this on that shiner before ya go to bed. Meet me here at 10 am tomorrow, ya understand?” he asks. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, sir,” I answer immediately, glancing at the tub in my hand. It wasn’t labeled, but I figured it was a bruise paste of some kind.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Go now. If’n anyone asks, ya name is Leon, and yer Georgies nephew.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, Sir.” I agree again before leaving the room quickly. I find the room with a 10 on it, slipping into the room and setting down the tray. I uncover it and my mouth waters at the hot beef stew, roll, and glass of butterbeer. I quickly dig in, demolishing the food faster than I normally do at the beginning feast at Hogwarts. For whatever reason, the Dursley’s had been feeding me even less than normal. I shower, smear the paste on my eye and quickly fall into bed, exhausted. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>I wake up well before ten. I’ve managed to unshrink my trunk, change, and tidy up my room before it rolls around, and when it does I cautiously leave the room. I’d noticed last night that the staircase to the left led straight down to the kitchen/bar area, and the one at the end of the hall leads to the first floor of rooms. I hesitate at the kitchen staircase, trying to listen and see if anyone was in there.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Get down here if yer wantin’ breakfast boy.” Georgie’s voice carries up to me, and I startle a little before I head down. He points to an empty table near the stove and  I sit obediently. He puts a plate of porridge, bacon, and sausage on my plate and I dig in as quickly as I had last night.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yer goin’ to Gringotts and gettin’ the gold yer needin’ to stay the rest of the summer. 60 gallons for yer room and food. After that, I expect you here every meal so I know yer eatin’, alrigh’?” he says once I’ve finished.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, sir.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My name is Georgie boy, you should use it. Take that tray out back, a strays been dropin’ by lately and I’m tired of him tippin’ bins over.” is his parting remark before he waves me out of a back door. I immediately see the guilty party, a black, skinny dog that would be huge if I couldn’t count every one of its ribs. It growls at me immediately, and I crouch low in response.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Easy boy. I’ve got some food for you.” I sooth, setting the tray on the ground. I scurry away when the dog lunges, but all it does is start in on the food. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Good boy.” I murmur as I ruffle up my hair. I hear the dog yelp and when I glanced back at him he’s low to the ground, tail wagging excitedly as he looks at me.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What?” I ask him, and he wiggles a little closer. I laugh, reaching out to him slowly and petting him when he gets close enough. I sit there petting him for a good five minutes before I sigh.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Alright buddy, I got to go to Gringotts.” I stand to leave and he whines, standing with me. He seems content to walk with me, and I allow him to with a shrug. I flip my hood up, the drizzle that had started making it easy to blend in that way.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s 10:25, surely you can open five minutes early!” a man says loudly ahead of me. I see the glint of gold as he pockets his watch, and I zero in on it like a hawk. I try to twitch myself away, but I’m still focused on it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Dammit, really? Now?” I curse myself, even as I brush against the man, barely there, and pocket his watch.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I make it to Gringotts, still disgruntled at my ‘magpie moment’ as Luna calls it, and make it to a teller.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>After my first year, Lucius Malfoy and Theodore Nott Senior made sure that I knew exactly what I was doing when it came to dealing with the goblins, and some etiquette lessons as well. I spent the winter holidays with Theo and the Easter holidays with Draco. Blaise had suggested I spend the next break with him, but I was informed that I was </span>
  <em>
    <span>required</span>
  </em>
  <span> to be home with my muggle relatives so I promised to spend Easter with him and Winter with Theo again. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hello Master Goblin, I’d like to make a withdraw from my trust vault.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Certainly. This way.” he waves me off to the left and I leave with a new Goblin. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>This trip goes much more smoothly than my last one, where I was with Theo and Blaise and their parents had taken thirty more minutes than necessary. I barely pause to drop the 60 gallons on the table in front of Georgie before sprinting upstairs. I’m surprised to see the dog with me, but I let him in and quickly lock the door. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Stupid stupid stupid! You </span>
  <em>
    <span>idiot</span>
  </em>
  <span>.” I mutter as I pull the pocket watch out from the pouch I’d placed it in. It was solid gold, with an eagle on the outside and a long chain that hit the floor when I’m holding it to my chest. A whine alerts me to the dog, who's taken home on the bed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know I know. I can’t help it. I zero in on something and I just… nab whatever it is drawing my attention. My friend calls it my magpie moments.” I cut myself off as I realize I’m talking to a </span>
  <em>
    <span>dog</span>
  </em>
  <span>. I run my hands over it again, and I focus on my magic. If I stole it, then I might as well make something out of it. Dropping to sit cross-legged on the floor I focus my magic in. I wanted something that would make noise when I tapped my magic against a number… wether with my wand or with my finger, and could turn it off by touching it anywhere. I feel the rush  I always get when I make something happen without my wand or words. When the rush settles, I know it works. Touching against the tick mark marking five minutes from now, I set it to the side and lay back. I huff when the dog jumps down and drapes himself against my side, tail wagging slowly. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>I grin happily when the alarm goes off a few minutes later.</span>
