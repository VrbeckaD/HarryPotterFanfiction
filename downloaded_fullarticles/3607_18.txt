    <p>Ed sighed and looked helplessly at the teenager's sleeping form, only her pitch-black hair visible in the tangle of cover sand pillows. So it was going to be one of those days, huh?</p><p>"Trisha, I've given you five extra minutes, you have to get up."</p><p>"But it's Saturday." She mumbled back and buried herself deeper into the comforter. "This has to count as child abuse."</p><p>Edward made and exasperated noise. He'd been trying to get his daughter up for at least half and hour. "Don't make me transmute your pillow into water, you know how that ended last time." He warned. "You will make me late for work if you don't get your butt out of bed and get ready for to day."</p><p>"UGH, Fine." She said and groggily pulled herself into a half- sitting position. "Why do I have to go to Aunt Winry's anyways? I'm old enough to stay home alone."</p><p>"You'd get bored in fifteen minutes. At least with your Aunt and Uncle there will be something to do." Ed explained. "Plus, you can show your alchemy to Alphonse, I bet he'd be impressed."</p><p>"… Okay, I'll go."</p><p>"It wasn't an option anyways."</p><p>"Whatever." Trisha rolled her eyes.</p><p>Ed raised an eyebrow at his daughter's sass. "I expect you downstairs in fifteen minutes."</p><p>"Okay, okay." She mumbled and all but pushed her father out of the room.</p><p>Trisha slumped over to her closet, pulling out whatever was closest, which happened to be a dark purple dress that she had bought over a year ago. Luckily or unluckily, she hadn't had any growth spurts recently so the dress still fit. She tended to wear simpler clothing, as being the daughter of the Fürher and the Fullmetal Alchemist always seemed to draw attention. Her bright golden eyes didn't help much either, as it was such a rare shade for an iris.</p><p>Trisha never bothered with makeup, as nobody in the household had any idea how to apply it so she had consequently messed up at every attempt. Plus, the idea of putting on what was basically slimy face paint on never really appealed to her. She wrestled with her tangled mop of black hair until it was brushed out enough to braid down her back. Even braided, the tip of Trisha's hair reached the middle of her waist. The teen knew that the length made it much more messy, but she never had the heart to cut it short.</p><p>When she felt content that she looked presentable, Trisha stuffed her feet in a pair of red- soled combat boots (which apparently once belonged to her dad) that she found in a box. The shoes had miraculously fit, so the teen girl decided to add them to her wardrobe.</p><p>She was out of her room in ten minutes flat.</p><p>Right when she entered the living room, a phone was heard ringing and her Dad's footsteps resounded through the halls towards the machine.</p><p>"This is Edward Elric." He said into the said in to the phone and was silent for a few seconds before speaking up again. "Colonel Hawkeye, what's up?"</p><p>Silence.</p><p>"Yeah… Yeah I'll be there soon. I have to drop of Trisha."… "Yes…yes I understand, Colonel. See you in thirty." The sound of the phone hanging up and being lifted up again hit Trisha's ears. Ed was calling someone else.</p><p>"Dad, I thought you said I had to hurry up." She called to him. "You'll be late if you keep calling people."</p><p>"One sec Trish." He said back. Then into the receiver, "Hey Winry, change of plans. Trisha is coming to work with me today, I'll see if I can slip by for my checkup sometime tomorrow." The conversation quickly dissolved into an argument, by the end if which Ed was slamming the receiver into the holder.</p><p>"C'mon Trish, we'll be late." He huffed as the duo hurried out of the house.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Trisha walked awkwardly behind Edward down the halls of Central HQ. The militants were casting strange looks to the non- military teenager walking behind the Fullmetal Alchemist. Most knew who she was, but there were still many confused or curious glances thrown as to WHY she was in HQ.</p><p>To be honest, Trisha didn't know why she was there either. All her Dad had said was that it was urgent business and Aunt Riza (as Trisha had titled the trigger- happy blonde in her early toddler years) said it involved the teen as well.</p><p>After what seemed like eternity, they arrived at the correct office. Inside, Team Mustang was working for once, but of course they were under the gun of a certain irked Colonel Hawkeye. When the duo entered the room everyone stood and saluted, slightly confused looks crossing their expressions.</p><p>"Brigadier General, you're late. Good Morning Trisha." Riza said from behind her papers.</p><p>"Sorry Colonel. SOMEONE's internal alarm clock was having a default." Ed sent a pointed glance to Trisha, who rolled her eyes.</p><p>"What kind of human wakes up at 7:30 on a Saturday anyways?" The teen grumbled and looked pointedly back at her Dad.</p><p>"Ah, she's got the classic Elric sass." Havoc murmured to Breda, who snickered.</p><p>"What's that supposed to mean?" Ed hissed angrily at the redhead.</p><p>"Nooothiiinng." He drawled.</p><p>"He's alluding to your rather <em>short</em> temper, Edward." A voice from behind the inner doorway called.</p><p>"Shut it Roy!" Ed yelled back. The room erupted in concealed laughter. Riza calmly shuffled her papers.</p><p>"Fürher Mustang has a mission for your Brigadier General Elric, you and Miss Trisha may enter." She said it calmly enough, but the gun loosed from its holster said enough to shut the company up.</p><p>"Yes Colonel." Ed said and headed into the inner room where Fürher Roy Mustang sat with his head propped in his hands at the large desk. The one onyx eye not concealed by an eye patch looked at the two who just entered the room.</p><p>"'Morning Papa." Trisha greeted her other father as she sat herself down on one of the large couches. "Why'd I have to show up here? It's too early to even be alive, you know." She said.</p><p>"Yeah, Roy, you know it's kind of against the rules to bring non-militants into the HQ without official pass, Fürher or not." Ed lectured his amused husband.</p><p>"Believe it or not, Edward, the three of us have been put to a mission by the Council." Roy said.</p><p>Ed was dumbfounded, "Wha- they can't put Trish on a mission, she isn't milliary."</p><p>"Don't worry, Edward, it isn't dangerous. You see, there have been hints of dangerous alchemical use at a school in the island nation the United Kingdom. Our job is to attend said school and search for any trace of it." Roy explained, handing the blonde alchemist a manila file. He flipped through it as the ravenette continued his explanation. "I am attending as a teacher in the subject of alchemy. I needed someone to come along as a guard, so that is where you come in Edward. Technically, the Council isn't leading Trisha, but today I received this letter from the same school addressed to her. For some reason, it ended up at my office rather than at home." He smirked. "You, dearest Fullmetal, will be in disguise as a student."</p><p>If Ed had been drinking something he would have spit it out in surprise, "WHY THE HELL DO YOU THINK I WOULD PASS AS A STUDENT?" He yelled. The officers on the other side of the door burst out in laughter, but the sound of a gun's safety being clicked off shut them up.</p><p>"Lemme see the letter, Papa." Trisha said and walked to the desk where Roy was holding out the note.</p><p>"It looks like a scholarly acceptance letter." The Fürher told her. She nodded in response. Her brows furrowed in confusion. "Papa, what does it mean 'Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry'?"</p><p>_______________________________________</p>
