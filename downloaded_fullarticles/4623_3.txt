    <p>Summer was going to an end but it still had a strong grip on the early days of September.<br/>
Parvati made use of this year’s final warm days by milling around on the grounds with her friends in the late afternoon sun. Though they were not the only ones who had that idea; several small groups of students were scattered in the soft grass around the lake, desperate to soak in the last bits of warmth and sunlight before turned into a dark and bleak winter.</p><p>It was a pity that Lavender hadn’t been in the mood to join them. Ever since Fenrir’s attack, she hadn’t been very comfortable being around groups of people. Still, Lavender had decided to join Parvati for their final year at Hogwarts. It might be selfish but Parvati was grateful to have her best friend with her. Yet she could not deny the guilt she was feeling when she saw how Lavender was treated by some of their fellow students. The few 8th-Year students who knew about her either treated her like a bomb about to go off or tried to avoid her altogether. Being around them in class seemed to use up all of Lavender’s energy.</p><p>So Parvati found herself reading – more like third-wheeling her sister and her boyfriend - alone on one of the last sunny days of the year.The two had just gotten into a fierce discussion of the Wimbourne Wasps’ latest loss against the Holyhead Harpies; a battle that brought a small smile to Parvati’s lips. Padma was taking apart the Wasps’ pitiful defense bit by bit while Terry desperately fought tooth and nail to defend their honor.</p><p>For Parvati, Quidditch had taken on a somewhat sour aftertaste after hearing Lavender go on about Ron’s abilities as a keeper for hours on end (she had always wondered if Lavender might have used it as a euphemism) but she still found joy in hearing her friends bicker about their favourite teams.</p><p>Suddenly, a sharp cough behind their backs made them startle. None of them had noticed being approached. They turned their heads only to be greeted by Professor McGonnagall’s stern face. Anxiety made its way through Parvati’s core. Had something bad happened? To her family? Or Lavender? Padma and Terry sported equally nervous expressions.</p><p>But Professor McGonnagall wouldn’t remain so calm had something truly bad happened, would she? But no other explanation came to her mind.</p><p>“A word, Miss Patil?” Professor McGonnagall said, though not unkindly.</p><p>Parvati felt the eyes of her friends fixate on her. She kept her eyes focused on her teacher’s face, trying to find a hint about the reason of her visit. But she came up blank. She nodded quickly before closing her novel and handing it to Terry.</p><p>“See you later,” she said to her friends before turning to her professor.</p><p>Professor McGonnagall began walking without hesitation, indicating for Parvati to follow her closer to the castle. She didn’t stop until they stood in the shadows of the old Quidditch shed. The wooden hut looked like it was about to fall apart; the wood rotten and covered in moss. Why it hadn’t been teared down or renovated, Parvati didn’t know.</p><p>“Miss Patil,” Professor McGonnagall was watching her over the rim of her glasses. “How is Miss Brown at the moment?”</p><p>The question caught Parvati by surprise. A million things her teacher could tell her had gone through her head but her enquiring about Lavender’s health wasn’t one of them. A startled laugh almost slipped from her lips when the full ridiculousness of the situation hit her.<br/>
Her teacher led her to a private part of the Hogwarts grounds to ask her about her best friend’s health. Though somewhat warmed by Professor McGonnagall’s obvious concern about Lavender, it didn’t feel right to talk about her behind her back. Especially because hiding behind an old shed made it feel like they were talking about something illegal or wrong and <em>not</em> an eighteen-year-old girl.</p><p>“Fine” was what she settled for eventually.</p><p>Professor McGonnagall raised an eyebrow but did not comment on her curtness. Her stern eyes studied Parvati for several seconds. It took an unexpectedly big effort to hold her gaze steadily and Parvati was glad when her grey eyes lost intensity.</p><p>“Very well,” Professor McGonnagall said at last. “I have … unfortunate news, Miss Patil, and I found it best if it was a close friend who would relate them to Miss Brown rather than her teacher.”</p><p>A tight knot of worry formed in Parvati’s stomach. What was going on? What kind of news were this that Professor McGonnagall did not want to convey them herself? And why was she so secretive about it? Was it about … Lavender?</p><p>“What is going on?” Parvati asked.</p><p>“An owl reached me this morning,” Professor McGonnagall lowered her voice, even though no one else was around. Parvati involuntarily leaned forward. “I was informed that Theodosius Brookridge has died last night. A potion accident as it seems, although the Magical Law Enforcement Patrol is still examining the scene. I’m sorry, Miss Patil, but without him, we do not have a secured access to Wolfbane potion anymore.”</p><p>Oh.</p><p>It was like radio silence in Parvati’s mind while she was trying to process the news. After the Battle of Hogwarts, the teachers as well as the St. Mungo’s staff had made an effort to find a reliable potion maker who would support Lavender with the much-needed potion. But only few could be interested in the endeavour and even less were willing to do it for a fraction of its normal price. The truth was that Lavender simply wasn’t able to pay the ridiculously high charge for seven vials a month.</p><p>No werewolf could afford them. Anger formed a tight knot in Parvati’s stomach when she thought about the injustice of a society not only shunning these people by denying them honest work but restricting their access to the very potion that would help them by offering it at astronomical prices.</p><p>Parvati knew that Snape had prepared the potion for free under Dumbledore’s orders.<br/>
Slughorn, as he himself had assured them, would do the same, hadn’t a curse rendered his hands almost useless during the Battle. He couldn’t take the risk of brewing a potion that relied so much on precision and detail. Dread crept through Parvati like poison when she realized that they were left with such limited options.</p><p>“What will happen now?” Her voice sounded hollow.</p><p>“Be assured that we – the school – will not give up on her,” Professor McGonnagall fixated Parvati with a hard stare. “Things have already been set into motion. As soon as we part, I will prepare letters to be sent to potion masters all over the continent – and beyond if I have to. We will put all our efforts in securing Miss Brown’s stay and continuing education at Hogwarts.”</p><p>Professor McGonnagall’s surprisingly heartfelt speech helped Parvati breathe a little lighter. It was reassuring to her that Hogwarts’s staff was on Lavender’s side. It didn’t solve the problem that Lavender needed to take the potion in less than three weeks, though. They had nineteen days to come up with a solution – Parvati wouldn’t let any of them go to waste. She knew what she had to do.</p><p>“Don’t worry, Professor,” Parvati returned her teacher’s stare just as intensely. “So will I.”</p><p>Professor McGonnagall kept her eyes trained on Parvati for a moment before giving her a curt nod.</p><p>“There has to be a benevolent soul out there – and by Merlin, we will find them.”</p>
