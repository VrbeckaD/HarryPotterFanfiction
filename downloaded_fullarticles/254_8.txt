    <p>“I just don’t understand why Ginny let <i>them</i> come.”</p><p>“Ron, come on- it’s Pansy’s engagement party too, is she not supposed to invite her own friends? You’re just sore because Blaise is here, honestly, it was <i>years</i> ago, you need to…”</p><p>Harry cleared his throat lightly and pushed Hermione’s glass of white wine across the bartop, pasting on a smile. “Here you go! Ron, anything?”</p><p>Ron shook his head, keeping his eyes on Hermione as they bickered, and Harry breathed a silent sigh of relief as they walked away. He turned around to grab a new bottle of Chardonnay, but froze at the low voice from behind him.</p><p>“Hard up for cash, Potter? I didn’t know you were working for hire...”</p><p>Malfoy. Harry turned back, wine forgotten. “I volunteered to mix drinks so they wouldn’t have to pay a bartender. What would you like?” His voice was steady- good.</p><p>Malfoy leaned against the bar. “Gin and tonic, heavy on the gin.”</p><p>“Do you want a double?”</p><p>“Just pour, Potter.”</p><p>Harry sighed and reached for the gin. “Fine, just say when-” He choked suddenly as he remembered…</p><p><i>”Do you like that, Potter?” A moan- his own. “You do, don’t you. I could let you come now but I’m not sure I will...when it gets to be too much, </i>just say when<i>…”</i></p><p>Harry blinked back to now, then grabbed the bottle and started pouring. He met Malfoy’s gaze, which had turned hot and searching, and raised an eyebrow. “Ok, Malfoy. Just say when.”</p><p>Malfoy smirked. “I remember, Potter. If you don’t, I’d be <i>happy</i> to remind you later.”</p><p>Harry overpoured the glass.</p>
