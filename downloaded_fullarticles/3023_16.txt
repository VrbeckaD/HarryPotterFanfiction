    <p>Sirius had left Remus with a parting gift after their last encounter. <em> So that you still have a piece of me when we're apart </em>. Remus rolled his eyes, remembering how dramatic his boyfriend was and how sappy he could be. Despite Padfoot's cheesy line and corny gesture, Moony found that he couldn't help but smile.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Remus sat in bed, reading a book, with Sirius Black's signature leather jacket bunched up beside him. On days that Moony felt like curling up into a ball and crying, he knew he could grab the coat and squeeze it tightly; the smells of leather, smoke and wet dog all mingled together in a perfect facsimile of Sirius-smell. Unfortunately for Moony, those days were happening more and more often.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Summers were always challenging in the Lupin residence, but the war had taken a toll on the family like never before. Lyall Lupin scolded Remus constantly, never failing to remind his son how much of a danger he posed to the world around him. <em> Stay hidden, stay safe </em> , he always preached. <em> Especially now. </em> Moony used to take walks outside for fresh air and to get out of his own head, but Mr. Lupin placed firm restrictions on Remus’ comings and goings after his son arrived home on a flying motorbike.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em> “Does this look </em> <em> hidden </em> <em> to you, Remus? Does this seem like a responsible way to act? What if you got caught? What then? The Ministry would have words for you, and they would find </em> <em> out </em> <em> about you! Is that what you want? Do you want every wizard in London to know what you are, Remus?” </em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Two days.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Remus hadn't left his room for two days.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>His mother brought him food and begged him to come out, but he refused. Everything hurt. It wasn't the same kind of hurt he felt before the moon, the dull ache in his muscles that always seemed to incapacitate him. It wasn't the same kind of pain he felt <em> after </em> the moon, when his body was bloodied and torn. This pain came from the inside, filling up his chest with a tightness that threatened to stop his breathing at any moment. It was a pain that couldn't be cured with a potion.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The only thing that kept Remus’ head above water was that goddamn jacket. It smelled like <em> him. </em> Holding it, keeping it close, was Remus’ way of pretending that Sirius was nearby.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As Remus read and reread the same sentence without absorbing anything, he heard a tapping on his bedroom window. Lupin looked up to find a large brown owl hooting angrily, pecking his beak against the glass. A sad smile crossed Remus’ face as he languidly got up and made his way to the window.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Hello Archimedes,” Remus cooed as he let the owl in. The crotchety creature hopped inside, demanding treats for his successful delivery. Remus grinned, realizing how perfect this owl was for his Padfoot. ”You're impatient. He's impatient. I bet you two get along well.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The owl gave another grumpy hoot before settling down on Remus’ desk to pick at the pellets scattered across it. As Archimedes ate, Remus detached the letter and unrolled it, letting a photograph fall to the floor.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em> Thinking of you. </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em> -S </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>That was all the letter said. Remus found it odd that Sirius would send his owl across London for three words. He bent down to pick up the photograph and suddenly realized Sirius’ intention.</p>
<p> </p>

<p>
  <a href="https://gph.is/2Bbv89K" rel="nofollow">(The photograph that Remus picked up)</a>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It was a picture of Sirius, clearly taken by himself, judging from the awkward angle. It wasn't a muggle photograph like the ones that were scattered about the Lupin home. This picture had Sirius moving, and oh, how he was moving.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Remus had to stifle a laugh as he saw photograph Sirius trying his best to look sexy for the camera. His long dark hair was let down so that it fell seductively across his shoulders, which were bare from his lack of shirt. Grey eyes smoldered through the picture, penetrating their way to Remus’ heart. Moony knew that look, and he knew exactly what photograph Padfoot wanted to do with him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Yeah, that's not happening,” Remus muttered to the picture, causing photo-Sirius to frown and try his best puppy-dog-eyes. They were much too small to be effective, but Remus was willing to give him an O for effort.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Remus brought the photograph to his bed and sat down, deciding that it was about time he put something up on the bare walls of his room. Moony pulled out his wand and cast a sticking spell, fastening both the picture and the parchment to the spot on the wall next to his pillow. That way, he could see Sirius’ stupid sexy face as he fell asleep.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Love you, Sere,” Remus muttered to the picture before standing up. He walked over to his bookshelf and picked up the broken camera that his mom had given him for his seventh birthday, along with his copy of <em> Enchanting Things: a Wizard's Guide to Muggle Contraptions and How To Make Them Useful </em>. Flipping to the page on photography, Remus muttered the spell and copied the motion, trying to turn the busted old muggle camera into a wizarding one.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Instant developed film…Hmm...” Remus muttered chewing on his lip. He needed to find a way to get his picture out of the camera without taking it to a photo shop. “Ah. There is is…”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>After another spell and some uncomfortable positioning, Remus held a perfect photograph in his hands. He sat down on his desk, grabbed a piece of parchment, and scrawled a note to send to his boyfriend along with the photo. He attached it to Sirius’ owl before giving it a loving pat on the head.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You did well, Archimedes. You can head home now.” The owl hooted gratefully and hopped over to the the windowsill before readying himself and taking off.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>~~~</p>
<p> </p>
<p>That evening, Remus settled himself into bed, cuddling with the jacket and staring at the picture of Sirius. It was a very attractive picture, he was willing to admit that. Sirius always looked handsome, but his hungry smirk was Remus’ favourite expression on that chiseled face. Nothing could top the way Sirius pined for Remus, desired him, needed him. It was one of the few things that kept Moony going on days where he had nothing else to live for. Nothing but Sirius.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Photograph Padfoot wiggled his eyebrows stupidly, a smirk spreading across his tiny lips. Moony chuckled, picturing real Sirius doing that; pretending to be sexy while being absolutely ridiculous. Padfoot was exceptional at turning everything into a joke.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Moony closed his eyes and inhaled deeply, squeezing his jacket a little bit tighter. He wondered what Sirius was up to at that moment, what kind of mischief he'd be causing with James. Remus thought about the photograph that he sent to his boyfriend and wondered if it had arrived at its destination. If Sirius had that photo, Remus knew <em> exactly </em> what his boyfriend was up to.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sirius was insatiable. Sometimes Remus wondered if Padfoot was simply in a permanent state of inappropriate thoughts. He smiled to himself, wondering what kinds of things Sirius would imagine with that photograph in his hands. It <em> was </em>a particularly good picture of Remus, after all.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em> Damn Moons, you look so fuckin’ hot in this. </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Remus laughed, causing photo Sirius to raise his eyebrow in confusion.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em> God, I wish you were here so I could fuck you right now. </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>That was definitely what Sirius would say.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em> Mmm… Moons… </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>One of Remus’ hands drifted lower as the warm scent of leather wafted through the air. His other hand pressed the jacket closer to his body, feeling the supple material against his face, imagining Sirius was there beside him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em> Fuck, Moons. Why aren't you here right now… I need you so bad… </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Remus’ fingers ran along the edge of his waistband, tickling the exposed skin above it, the same way Sirius would do. He ran his hand over the flannel that barely covered his growing erection, letting out a soft moan into Padfoot’s coat.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Moony looked up at the photograph, where the tiny Sirius was grinning tauntingly at him, knowing exactly what was going on in Remus’ mind. Remus grinned at the picture and rolled his eyes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Shut up, Pads…” He muttered at the photo.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em> Make me. </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sirius’ voice in Remus’ head sent chills down his spine. He could picture it so clearly, as if his boyfriend was right there beside him, toying with him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Fingers slipped down into Remus’ pajama bottoms, grazing his prick with delicate, barely perceptible touches. He loved the build up, the anticipation, the way Sirius always teased him before he did anything. Moony let go of the jacket and trailed his other hand up and down his stomach, sending tingles across his body.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em> Mmm, Moons… I love the way you shiver when I’ve barely touched you. </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Remus laughed to himself. Even his imaginary Sirius liked to taunt him. He wondered if maybe he was some kind of masochist, who loved to be tormented and teased.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em> Yeah, probably. </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A steady hand wrapped itself around Remus’ shaft, the other making its way towards his balls. They were Sirius’ hands, powerful and capable, hands that knew exactly what Remus loved. With a twist of his wrist, Remus tried replicating that <em> thing </em> that Sirius always did. It was nice, but it wasn't perfect; the real Padfoot was much better.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em> Don't worry, Moons. I'll teach you. We'll just have to practice together. </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Remus smirked, enjoying the notion of practicing with Sirius, perfecting his technique.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Slim fingers creeped lower, rubbing at Remus’ entrance, causing him to arch his back and sigh with pleasure. The other hand gripped harder on his cock, gently tugging, picking up the pace. Sirius continued to whisper sexy thoughts in Remus’ head.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em> Fuck, Moons. You're so tight. God, I wanna be inside you so bad, you have no idea. </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Remus had some idea. He was feeling the same thing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em> Mmm… yeah, you like when I do that? </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sirius’ voice was gruff and coarse, and Remus squirmed as his hands continued to work at his shaft and arse. The stroking became rougher, the pace increasing. Remus’ hips were writhing in pleasure as he pictured Sirius doing what Sirius did best.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Ah… yes…”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>His stomach tightened and his toes clenched as pressure built up from within. Moony could feel himself getting close.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em> Come for me, Moons… </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Faster and faster, until Remus could think of nothing but Sirius’ face and smell and cock and perfect ass.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Yes… Sirius… fuuuck…”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Everything inside of Remus seemed to squeeze together until it suddenly released in a desperate gasp of ecstasy. A few more strokes, prolonging the moment, savouring the feeling for as long as he could. Then it was done. Remus was panting, two hands covered in sticky fluid. He began to return to his senses, remembering where he was and what he was doing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As his breathing steadied and his heart slowed down, Remus’ mind once again focused on the reality of his situation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He was alone, in his bedroom at his parents’ home, thinking of his boyfriend who was across the city. Remus was fantasizing about something he couldn't have. Moony let out a sigh as he grabbed his wand from his nightstand and cast a cleaning spell. He curled up into a ball and pulled the leather jacket close to him, smelling it once more, trying to clear his mind. He wished more than anything that he could have Sirius beside him, to cuddle up against, to wrap strong arms around Moony's waist and tell him that everything was going to be okay. He wished he could feel Padfoot's warmth, his slow breathing, his soft skin and stubbled cheek. Remus looked longingly at his photograph of Sirius.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I miss you, Sere…”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He wanted to be told that he was loved, that he was worthwhile, that he wasn't a monster. He needed his best friend.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Remus’ thoughts were interrupted when he heard the sudden tap on the window.</p>
<p> </p>
