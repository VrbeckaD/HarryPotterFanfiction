  <strong>1. Chapter: Coming Home</strong>
</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">Draco apparated with a bang in front of the small cottage in the beautiful Irish countryside and eagerly breathed in the clean air. The city noise of London seemed even louder when he knew how quiet it could be out here.</p>
<p align="justify">He put the key into the lock and opened the dark wooden door. He had had an exhausting shift. The new healers in training he had to teach at the ward for potions and poisonings shattered his nerves. Fortunately he had a free day tomorrow!</p>
<p align="justify">The blond man always felt a little melancholy when he came into the empty house. Here so far out with only a few houses hundreds of meters away it could be pretty lonely, but he had chosen it that way. Sighing, he made himself a cup of tea and turned on the radio to banish the silence from the rooms and his heart.</p>
<p align="justify">Even the cat, which he had bought so he wouldn't be alone all the time, was absent. Ungrateful creature. Why did one bring a little company into the house when it was only on the road hunting mice?</p>
<p align="justify">Draco didn't like being alone. That's been going on for far too long now. But that was the way it was.</p>
<p align="justify">With the hot cup of tea he went to the terrace and let his gaze wander over the green meadows and fields. It was unusually warm for April. He hadn't been jogging for so long. He could visit the lake at the foot of the range of hills soon. A quiet rattling out of the house made Draco sit up and take notice. Surely Sammy, the pitch-black cat, had just come in through the cat flap and demanded his dinner. Then he could also make his own dinner, the healer decided and went back inside.</p>
<p align="center"> ***</p>
<p align="justify">He came out of the living room into the hallway, uttered a surprised scream and almost dropped his cup. In front of the wardrobe stood a handsome black-haired man in a dark blue and gold uniform.</p>
<p align="justify">"Harry!" Draco shouted joyfully and threw himself at his boyfriend.</p>
<p align="justify">He felt the other man pulling him tight and burying his face on Draco's neck. "Damn, baby, I missed you so much..." he muttered and kissed the soft, light skin of his lover.</p>
<p align="justify">"I missed you too, infinitely even!" Draco ran his hand into the soft black hair and inhaled the familiar smell of Harry's shampoo and battle smoke.</p>
<p align="justify">They kissed slowly and tenderly and Draco felt the butterflies flutter in his belly. He was still as in love as he was four years ago...</p>
<p align="justify">Draco fumbled with one hand for the light switch and then held his boyfriend at a distance to be able to look more closely at him. "You are back early. Are you all right? Do you need anything?"</p>
<p align="justify">Harry looked damn tired, but satisfied. Some sooty smear and a small scratch were drawn over his cheek and his robe had a small hole in the front. "We were able to complete the mission faster than expected. Connor was hit in the head pretty hard when we grabbed the perpetrators, but we managed to get him fixed quickly. I'm just so exhausted and happy to be with you again."</p>
<p align="justify">"I'm glad you're back, too. I hate being alone for so long." Draco sulked a little and pulled Harry again into a tight hug, his arms tightly pressed to Harry's sides.</p>
<p align="justify">The black haired one quickly sucked in the air between his teeth and groaned quietly.</p>
<p align="justify">"Aha," Draco exclaimed triumphantly. "So, what is it? You promised me you would tell me everything!"</p>
<p align="justify">Harry had learned all sorts of useful little healing spells from Draco in those four years, but he was still prone to injuries.</p>
<p align="justify">"Darling, I swear, it's nothing. Just a few bruises and scratches."</p>
<p align="justify">Draco did not let himself be put off and walked around the smaller man. Harry was wobbling with exhaustion in the meantime. The blonde carefully pulled the robe from his shoulders and then pushed his shirt up. The right side below the dragon tattoo was blue and purple swollen.</p>
<p align="justify">"Is everything okay with the ribs?," Draco asked and palpated the warm skin.</p>
<p align="justify">"Think so, it's just - ow! - bruised."</p>
<p align="justify">"Come on, we'll put you in the shower and then I'll see what I can do for you."</p>
<p align="justify">Draco winked suggestively and Harry grinned broadly.</p>
<p align="justify">"Oh, Mr. Malfoy! What ideas you got in your head again!"</p>
<p align="justify">"You've been gone almost three weeks! I had a lot of time to imagine what I would do with you when you got back home."</p>
<p align="center"> ***</p>
<p align="justify">Draco gently pushed Harry up the stairs to the bathroom, while the latter stumbled and unbuttoned his dark blue shirt and let it slide from his shoulders. Draco was crazy about that muscularly defined, smooth, tanned back. He bit his lower lip and saw the dragon tattoo move slightly, stretching his wings as Harry raised his arms.</p>
<p align="justify">"You woke him up," Draco said quietly and kissed the dragon tenderly. "He was just asleep."</p>
<p align="justify">The dragon on Harry's shoulder trudged once in a circle around its own axis and then rolled back together again.</p>
<p align="justify">The black-haired one yawned deeply. "I think he's exhausted too," Harry sighed and flinched as he bent down to take his socks off. "Could you perhaps make me a coffee, darling? Otherwise I'll fall asleep standing in the shower!"</p>
<p align="justify">Draco nodded and hurried into the kitchen. It was out of the question that his lover fell asleep before he had really spoiled him.</p>
<p align="justify">With the cup he went back to the bathroom, where Harry was already standing behind the frosted glass of the shower wall. The black haired man turned the tap on and let out a pleasant sigh, as the hot water ran down his maltreated body.</p>
<p align="justify">In Draco's crotch it twitched slightly. They hadn't slept together for almost three weeks and Draco had forbidden himself to lay a hand on himself to increase his lust for Harry. And by the time he opened the shower cubicle and saw his naked, shiny, wet friend in front of him, it had reached the very top.</p>
<p align="justify">"Shit, you look so good," slipped out of the blonde's mouth and Harry grinned blissfully as he was washing his hair with his eyes closed.</p>
<p align="justify">"Stop ogling at my ass and go into the bedroom. I'll be right there, my angel."</p>
<p align="justify">Draco took the cup of coffee from which Harry had drunk a big sip and put it on the bathroom shelf. Full of anticipation he went into the bedroom, closed the curtains and dimmed the light to a soft glow. Then he stripped bare and lay down on the huge bed. His penis was already aroused by the thought of what was to come.</p>
<p align="justify">A little later a freshly showered, naked man with wet hair stepped into the bedroom. Harry had been wearing his hair shorter again for two years, which Draco found a little unfortunate, but the beard had also become a little shorter, which he liked better.</p>
<p align="justify">Harry's gaze fell on Draco, who stretched himself naked in bed and he licked his full lips.</p>
<p align="justify">"Gods, I really missed that," the Auror groaned.</p>
<p align="justify">"Then what are you waiting for?" Draco returned.</p>
<p align="justify">Harry flinched again as he crawled onto the bed. He rubbed over his blue bruised side and sighed softly.</p>
<p align="justify">"Lie down, sweetheart. I'll take care of you."</p>
<p align="justify">With a soft mumble Harry let himself sink carefully backwards into the pillows. Draco angled his magic wand from the bedside table and spoke a pain-relieving spell over the ribs. Now he could finally devote himself to his lover.</p>
<p align="justify">Quickly their mouths met and they kissed greedily. Their hands were everywhere, stroking the warm skin. Draco lay down on his muscular partner and both groaned as their naked erections met. He nibbled on Harry's sensitive neck and drove his wet lips further and further down. The fresh scent of the bronze skin almost fogged Draco's mind. He placed little kisses on Harry's entire upper body and drove his slender hands over the soft skin. The black haired man trembled and purred contentedly.</p>
<p align="justify">"You know, sometimes you sound like Sammy," Draco teased as his mouth wandered deeper and deeper.</p>
<p align="justify">Harry's huge cock grew visibly as Draco drove his tongue along the narrow path of black hair under his belly button. The blonde nibbled and sucked on the soft skin in the groin and Harry's breath accelerated. His big hands dug into Draco's light blonde hair as he put wet kisses up to the base of the penis. He drove his palms over the hip bones and let his fingernails glide a little over the sides of his firm butt. Harry's erection was already shining red with unfulfilled lust.</p>
<p align="justify">"Put it in your mouth, baby."</p>
<p align="justify">Draco obeyed immediately. He loved Harry's deep voice, his dominance and his self-confidence. The blonde quickly grabbed the bobbing cock in front of his nose with his whole hand and licked with his tongue over the underside and the tip, where already a first drop of white liquid was pouring out. A loud groan escaped Harry and he jerked his hips upwards uncontrollably, pushing himself even deeper into Draco's mouth, who finally took him in completely.</p>
<p align="justify">"Oh, yes! Fuck!"</p>
<p align="justify">The pleasant pull on the back of Draco's head intensified. Greedily he let the hard cock slide in and out of his mouth with wet noises. He loved the bitter, male taste of his lover. With one hand he milked the bulging shaft, with the other he played with Harry's sensitive balls. He moved his head up and down faster and faster. Harry's hoarse moaning turned him on so incredibly. He loved it when Harry was in control, but sometimes he enjoyed it very much when he could get him to drop himself and just surrender to his lust.</p>
<p align="justify">"Merlin, Draco! Fuck, keep going!"</p>
<p align="justify">Harry cursed and twitched and held the blonde's head in position with an iron grip. He pulled his legs up, knees towards his chest, which was Draco's signal to use the one hand from his balls elsewhere. He briefly released the throbbing cock from his mouth and instead slid two fingers in, wetting them with spit. Then he quickly took the cock between his sucking lips again. He played with the little slit and sucked and licked like crazy. The moaning that rewarded him was deep and rough and music in Draco's ears. He stroked his saliva wet fingers over Harry's exposed crevice. Carefully he pressed against the tight hole, circled the sensitive skin and let a slippery finger slide in.</p>
<p align="justify">"Fuck," Harry screamed hoarse as he immediately thrusted his hips and shot a huge load of hot sperm into Draco's throat.</p>
<p align="justify">"That was quick", Draco thought to himself. He pressed his finger a little deeper into Harry's hot ass and swallowed everything he got in his mouth. Draco moved his fingers even deeper into Harry's tight hole, finding his prostate. He let his lips wander over the shiny red glans and Harry trembled and groaned because of this overstimulation.</p>
<p align="justify">"Shit, stop it! I - I can't..." wheezed the black-haired man trying to elude Draco's mouth.</p>
<p align="justify">With one last deep suck, the blonde healer released his boyfriend's twitching cock and pulled his finger out of his hole. Panting and sweating, Harry stretched out all his limbs and gasped for air.</p>
<p align="justify">"Oh, God! That was awesome, baby. You are so fantastic, my wonderful angel. What are you doing to me? I'm completely done..." stammered the Auror and stretched out his arm groping to pull Draco to him.</p>
<p align="justify">Draco's neck hair stood up when he heard the praise and he hummed contentedly. The slender man snuggled up to Harry, eager to finally get some release for his already painfully aroused cock.</p>
<p align="justify">"Three weeks is just too long! I need you now," he whispered into his ear.</p>
<p align="justify">Demandingly he kissed Harry's neck and nibbled on his earlobe. At the same time he wrapped his long arms around the muscular upper body and rubbed his crotch against Harry's thigh.</p>
<p align="justify">"I'm so hard, Daddy, please take me!" Draco felt Harry shudder at the nickname and press himself towards him. He didn't always call him "Daddy", but when he did, Harry immediately jumped on it and Draco loved it.</p>
<p align="justify">The black haired man laid a large hand on the slender neck of his lover, who immediately bent his back. Harry tensed his fingers and Draco gasped.</p>
<p align="justify">"You want me to fuck you, don't you?" he growled into the blonde's ear.</p>
<p align="justify">With a firm hand he reached for Draco's incredibly hard erection. The young healer whimpered and pressed greedily against the strong hands.</p>
<p align="justify">"Then beg for it, baby..."</p>
<p align="justify">"Please, Harry! Please fuck me!" Draco whimpered.</p>
<p align="justify">"Again, baby boy."</p>
<p align="justify">"Daddy, please... please, please, gods, take me," Draco sobbed and tried to thrust into Harry's hand, but he held him down.</p>
<p align="justify">"Merlin, you are so incredibly sexy. Begging so beautifully for me..." Harry purred into Draco's ear.</p>
<p align="justify">Draco moaned. Big warm hands grabbed him by the hip and turned him on his stomach.</p>
<p align="justify">"Kneel."</p>
<p align="justify">Draco immediately obeyed, stretched his firm butt out to his boyfriend and leaned on his knees and forearms. A slap with the flat hand against his cheeks made him sigh excitedly.</p>
<p align="justify">"Yes, more, Daddy! Please..."</p>
<p align="justify">Another slap and Draco jerked forward.</p>
<p align="justify">"Your tight little ass is so hot, baby...", growled Harry and scattered little kisses on the pale skin on Draco's buttocks.</p>
<p align="justify">Harry's strong fingers grabbed Draco's ass, kneaded it and pulled the cheeks a little apart. The blonde groaned as he felt his lover's wet tongue on his sensitive hole. Gently it circled over the wrinkly rim and Draco's hole helplessly clenched around nothing. Harry licked a wide strip from his heavy balls to his tailbone and Draco bit into the pillow.</p>
<p align="justify">"Uuuhhnnngg..." Draco couldn't think anymore, he needed more and needed it right now.</p>
<p align="justify">Harry seemed to understand him, was too impatient himself, finally wanted to taste his lover. He penetrated him with his tongue and a long scream escaped Draco's throat. He licked the sensitive skin faster and faster, pushed his tongue into the tight hole, which slowly relaxed. Draco clawed his hands into the bed sheet and breathed only intermittently being so thoroughly fucked by his lover's tongue. He had to come now! More, <em>more</em>...</p>
<p align="justify">"More!" he begged.</p>
<p align="justify">Another hart slap on the already reddened butt cheek followed. Damn, Draco was as wanton as he hadn't been in a long time. The tongue disappeared from his ass and he howled in disappointment. He heard noises from the bedside table and shortly afterwards he felt his pink hole being coated with cool gel. Harry didn't think twice. He took two fingers at once and pushed them up to the hilt into Draco. The blonde screamed at the sudden burning pleasure and threw his head up. Immediately a hand gripped his blond hair and held him in that position. His head bent back, his back arched, his ass pressed against Harry's hand. Just for a second the darker man gave the other time to accustom to his fingers, then he began to thrust relentlessly into him.</p>
<p align="justify">"Fuck, fuck, yes!" Draco's moaning and screaming was ringing in his own ears.</p>
<p align="justify">Quickly a third finger was added and Harry's erection had long since grown back to its full size. Draco knew that he couldn't wait to fuck his partner. Three fucking weeks were just too long!</p>
<p align="justify">Harry let go of the blond head of hair and pulled his fingers out of Draco's ass. He sobbed disappointed, but he knew what was coming. Again he heard Harry handling the lubricant and knew he was rubbing his enormous cock. He couldn't wait any longer, <em>please</em>... Suddenly the wet fingers grabbed Draco's penis and wiped the rest of the gel in circular movements over the already dripping glans.</p>
<p align="justify">"Fuck me! Please, Harry, <em>please</em>..." the blonde whimpered with trembling knees.</p>
<p align="justify">"God, baby! I'll fuck you so hard you'll beg for mercy," Harry growled deep in his throat and slowly pressed his cock into Draco's tight hole.</p>
<p align="justify">"Fuck, Daddy! Give me more," Draco groaned.</p>
<p align="justify">He was so full, so stretched and so full... He would tear apart right away. His arms trembled violently and Harry stroked his lover's sweat-covered back with his warm palms.</p>
<p align="justify">Finally he was inside and Draco felt so full and horny that he had to pull himself together not to come straightaway. He loved this feeling of surrendering to Harry, being trapped in those strong arms. The black beard tickled Draco's back as the Auror nibbled on his shoulder and bite tenderly.</p>
<p align="justify">"How do you want it, baby?" Harry growled. "Slow and deep?"</p>
<p align="justify">He almost withdrew completely and pushed torturously slowly back into him, stroking Draco's aroused prostate. Draco whimpered and twitched.</p>
<p align="justify">"Or rather like this?" He grabbed Draco's narrow hips tightly and thrusted into him five times at high speed and stopped immediately.</p>
<p align="justify">Draco almost sobbed when it stopped, so desperately looking for salvation.</p>
<p align="justify">"Tell me, baby..." Harry bit his back hard now and Draco gasped. "How do you want it?"</p>
<p align="justify">"Please... please...", Draco whimpered and tried to push his butt back, but the black haired man held him tightly.</p>
<p align="justify">"You have to express yourself more clearly, my sweetheart..." Harry purred against the pale skin. He gleefully let his tongue glide over Draco's coccyx, who shuddered and trembled and sucked the air in.</p>
<p align="justify">"Fast," the blonde cried. "Fast and hard and dirty, Daddy!"</p>
<p align="justify">Finally, finally! Harry began to thrust quickly into him and Draco screamed.</p>
<p align="justify">"Oh, yeeessss!"</p>
<p align="justify">Harry's deep groaning filled the room and almost drove the blonde into madness of lust. Draco bit his lower lip to hold back his hot sperm, which was already gathering in his loins. He was so hot for Harry, but he didn't want to come yet, didn't want it to be over.</p>
<p align="justify">"Shit, baby, you're so tight," Harry gasped and slapped his flat hand on Draco's ass again.</p>
<p align="justify">The sharp pain alone was almost enough to make Draco come. He whimpered and his arms buckled. Harry's strong fingers were in his neck immediately and gently pushed him down. Draco's legs gave way, he now lay flat on the bed and immediately the muscular body was above him. The feet to the right and left of Draco's ass he had now changed the angle so that he could push even better against this sensitive spot in Draco's ass. He continued to fuck him relentlessly and Draco moaned so loudly that his throat almost hurt.</p>
<p align="justify">"Merlin, yes, Daddy! Yes, take me... OOOH GOD!"</p>
<p align="justify">"Come for me, baby! I want you to come! Just from my hard cock in your perfect little ass!"</p>
<p align="justify">Harry's voice was rough and trembled with effort. Even though it didn't seem possible, the black haired man took on even more speed and banged so hard into his blonde lover that his balls beat violently against his firm bottom.</p>
<p align="justify">"I - FUCK! I’m coming! Yesss!"</p>
<p align="justify">And Draco came. He threw his head back and screamed as he pumped a huge load between himself and the mattress without even touching his hard cock once. Harry's further hits on his prostate let him see stars.</p>
<p align="justify">The blonde trembled and twitched and Harry continued panting, teasing his hypersensitive prostate. Draco moaned and bit his lower lip until he tasted blood to prevent himself from going crazy. Finally the black haired man thrusted his thick cock deep into Draco, held it there and filled his ass with hot sperm. The blonde shivered. Even his nerves seemed to tremble. In his head everything spun and he seemed to float.</p>
<p align="justify">"Merlin, Draco," Harry gasped out of breath and let himself sink on his boyfriend's slender body with shaky arms.</p>
<p align="justify">Exhausted, he pressed his full lips into Draco's neck and purred again like a cat.</p>
<p align="justify">"Are you all right?," Harry asked worriedly when Draco didn't react.</p>
<p align="justify">The healer's heart was still beating violently against his ribs and he could only nod.</p>
<p align="justify">"C'mere, darling."</p>
<p align="justify">Harry pulled his penis out of Draco and both sighed. Then he slipped from Draco’s back and lay down on his side. Tenderly Harry pulled his lover’s slender body with his back first to himself and wrapped his arms around his chest. Draco felt Harry placing one hand on the spot where his heart pounded furiously fast and the other gently stroked through his sweaty hair.</p>
<p align="justify">"I got you. Baby, that was incredible," muttered the Auror.</p>
<p align="justify">Draco shuddered as Harry lovingly scratched his neck, all the nerve endings were still so sensitive that he flinched at the slightest touch.</p>
<p align="justify">"Is everything okay? Turn around, baby..."</p>
<p align="justify">Draco had the feeling that his muscles would hardly obey him. He shrugged as he felt his more than sore ass. Whimpering, he let himself sink against his boyfriend's strong chest and buried his face on the smooth skin.</p>
<p align="justify">"Did I break you?," Harry asked with a mixture of amusement and serious concern.</p>
<p align="justify">Draco nodded his head and grinned tiredly at the black-haired man.</p>
<p align="justify">"Your lip," Harry muttered and a deep crease appeared on his forehead as he looked at the drops of blood.</p>
<p align="justify">With a trembling hand the blonde dabbed his mouth. "Oops", he just mumbled.</p>
<p align="justify">"What have you done, my angel? You have to take care of yourself," Harry grumbled and gently dabbed his thumb over Draco's bleeding lip.</p>
<p align="justify">Draco gratefully laid his slender fingers on the bearded cheek.</p>
<p align="justify">"I just had to pull myself together, keeping me from coming right away when you shoved your beautiful hard cock into me, I must have bitten it a bit too hard."</p>
<p align="justify">"Was I too hard on you?"</p>
<p align="justify">Draco shook his head, put his hands in Harry's neck and whispered in his ear: "You know you can never be too hard on me. It was so fantastic! Your huge cock felt so good in me, oh god, I get hard again when I think about it! I came so hard, I thought I was going crazy!"</p>
<p align="justify">Harry sighed slightly aroused. "Shit, baby... I missed you so much."</p>
<p align="justify">They kissed, slowly and tenderly, with caressing hands and nestled skin. Draco felt infinitely comfortable in the soft bed and the strong arms of his lover. He laid his head against his broad chest. Slowly he noticed fatigue and exhaustion creeping into his limbs.</p>
<p align="justify">"Shall we take a shower?" Harry mumbled sleepily.</p>
<p align="justify">"Yes, but too weak...," Draco complained, who actually didn't like it when he woke up the next morning all sweaty and sticky.</p>
<p align="justify">"C’mere... I'll take care of you, baby boy."</p>
<p align="justify">The bed moved and Draco felt Harry lifting him into his arms with incredible ease. Tired, the blonde wrapped his arms and legs around him and let himself be carried into the warm shower. When Harry finally put them both to bed and covered their naked with a huge blanket, Draco was almost asleep.</p>
<p align="justify">"I love you, Draco," was all he heard before dozing off with a smile on his lips.</p>
