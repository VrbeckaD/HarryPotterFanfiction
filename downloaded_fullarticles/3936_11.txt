  <em>I never really understood humans. So happy to run around after each other one moment, so devastated the next. </em>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>But sometimes, sometimes, I might take a special interest in the direction one or two of them are running. </em>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>Whether that be to make them collide headlong in their flight for another, or whether that be to keep them as far from certain others as Kismet may allow. </em>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>Sometimes I play with them for my amusement, I guess that makes me a sadist, if you wanted to classify my behaviour in human terms. </em>
</p>
<p align="center">

  <em> mean, it's true that I'm not kind. But I'm not unkind. I am just. </em>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>And I think I might tell you the story of one I took an interest in. She was named after me. </em>
</p>
<p align="center">
