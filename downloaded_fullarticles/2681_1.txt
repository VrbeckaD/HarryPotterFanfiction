    <p align="justify">My name is Kevin Martens. I’m 11, I’m from London and, apparently, I’m a wizard.</p><p align="justify">To be honest, strange things have always happened to me, but I would have never thought of magic as a cause for them; therefore, when a man came to our house to deliver an acceptance letter to this “Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry”, whose Headmistress was supposedly Minerva McGonagall, at first we thought it was a joke.</p><p align="justify">When the doorbell rang, none of us had any idea of who could possibly be; so, my mum was really surprised when she went to open the door and saw an unknown man standing on the doorstep. He was tall, with brown and silver hair and dark eyes; his clothes looked a bit off, as if he had bought them in the early 2000s and had never had the chance to wear them. Definitely not something you would wear in 2014.</p><p align="justify">‘Good evening, madam. I’m Professor Lucius Landstone, from the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. I believe you have received a letter announcing my arrival on this day.’</p><p align="justify">It took my mum a few moments to fully understand those words.</p><p align="justify">‘Whoever you are, this isn’t funny,’ she finally replied with a harsh voice, then closing the door.</p><p align="justify">My dad and I were just coming out of the kitchen. We had heard the short conversation: I was confused, but my dad looked livid.</p><p align="justify">‘Who the hell...’ he started, but then he stopped, looking at the door opening again and revealing Mr. Landstone, who had a stick in his right hand.</p><p align="justify">‘I’m sorry, but...’ he was saying, but soon he was interrupted by my dad, who shouted: ‘Go away right now or I’m calling the police!’, all while actually getting ready to punch the guy – or at least, so I thought.</p><p align="justify">Mr. Landstone didn’t lose his composure. ‘If you’d just allow me to explain...’</p><p align="justify">‘Explain what?’ I asked. While I didn’t exactly trust that person, he didn’t seem dangerous – although he had just broken our door open.</p><p align="justify">‘You must be Kevin,’ said the man. It seemed that he wanted to come in, but my parents were standing in his way.</p><p align="justify">‘I’m sorry, Mr. and Mrs. Martens, this must be a misunderstanding: perhaps you haven't actually received the letter?’</p><p align="justify">‘We have, but we thought it was just a joke. Kevin, a wizard? Magic existing in the first place?’ was my mum’s reply. I knew nothing of the letter they were talking about.</p><p align="justify">‘I can show you, madam, if you just let me.’</p><p align="justify">Something in his voice sounded too serious to be a joke... but it <em>had </em>to be.</p><p align="justify">Since my parents didn’t answer, Mr. Landstone took the chance and waved his stick: our wooden door became a glass door in the bat of an eye.</p><p align="justify">We all shouted.</p><p align="justify">‘See? This should convince you that magic exists... and I should manage to convince you that Hogwarts exists in a minute, if you’d just let me explain.’</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">            A few minutes later, we were sitting in the living room. Mr. Landstone had turned our door back into a wooden one; my mum had just put the kettle on the stove, and when she came back to the living room Mr. Landstone started telling us about what was going to become my world.</p><p align="justify">‘As I told you, I am Professor Lucius Landstone. I teach Transfiguration at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and I’m here because you, Kevin,’ he spoke to me directly, ‘are a wizard, and therefore you’ve been accepted into our school.’</p><p align="justify">There was a moment of silence.</p><p align="justify">‘Excuse me, sir, but... how do you know that I’m a wizard?’ I asked.</p><p align="justify">‘Magic leaves its signs, you know,’ he answered. ‘Haven’t you ever done something odd? Something you couldn’t understand?’</p><p align="justify">‘Well... sometimes, I guess.’ I shrugged. I had switched off lights when I didn’t want to get up to do that, I had jumped unusually high, I had repaired my dad’s phone when I thought I had broken it for good that time... but I’d never thought it was magic. I mean, magic? Come on! That had to be some coincidence. For example, I wasn’t <em>sure</em> I had broken my dad’s phone – even though it definitely looked like that...</p><p align="justify">‘But we’re not wizards... are we?’ asked my mum.</p><p align="justify">‘Oh no, madam. You are what wizards call Muggles – that is, people with no magic.’</p><p align="justify">‘Then how could Kevin possibly be a wizard?’</p><p align="justify">‘You see, while magic is usually hereditary, it sometimes shows up in people born from Muggles... Muggleborns, as we call them. Some think that it must mean that you have some witch or wizard among your ancestors, but anyways, what matters is that Kevin is a wizard. Now, Hogwarts is the most renowned wizardry school in the world, and there Kevin will learn how to develop and control his magic.’</p><p align="justify">The kettle started whistling. My mum went to the kitchen and soon came back with a teapot, then she poured some tea to Mr. Landstone and to the rest of us. She looked really confused, and so did my dad, who was absent-mindedly looking at his cup.</p><p align="justify">I wasn’t less confused than they were, but since they were talking about me, I decided that it was up to me to ask all the important questions.</p><p align="justify">‘So, um... where is this Hogwarts?’</p><p align="justify">‘It’s a castle in the north.’</p><p align="justify">‘So we’ll have to move?’</p><p align="justify">‘Oh, no, your parents won’t need to move – Muggles can’t reach Hogwarts anyways. You’ll be the only one moving.’</p><p align="justify">My dad had a little jump. ‘Wait, so it’s a boarding school?’</p><p align="justify">Mr. Landstone nodded.</p><p align="justify">‘Are you telling us that Kevin should move to this unknown place, which we can’t reach, and live there for the entire school year? He’s only eleven, you know!’</p><p align="justify">‘I understand your concerns, Mr. Martens, but I can assure you that Hogwarts is one of the safest places in Great Britain – if not in the entire world. Of course he’ll be under the surveillance of Professors and of the Headmistress, Minerva McGonagall.’</p><p align="justify">The news were shocking – I mean, <em>besides</em> finding out that I was a wizard. Was I really expected to move to this bizarre school and leave my parents and friends behind? I <em>was</em> only eleven, after all... and I had always thought I was going to a middle school in London.</p><p align="justify">‘This is your acceptance letter,’ then said the wizard, handing me an envelope. I took it: it contained two pieces of... parchment?</p><p align="justify">One of those said that had been accepted into Hogwarts, while the other had a list of schoolbooks and supplies.</p><p align="justify">‘Wait a minute, we didn't say he was going,’ objected my mum. My dad nodded.</p><p align="justify">‘Of course he's not forced to attend Hogwarts, but that would be an extremely bad idea, I'm afraid. You would deprive your son of an extraordinary future as a member of the wizarding world.’</p><p align="justify">Mr. Landstone's voice was very calm and kind. I had somehow started to trust him a bit.</p><p align="justify">Still...</p><p align="justify">‘Regardless of what they say, <em>I</em> am not sure if I want to go... I mean, that looks... tough.’</p><p align="justify">"Tough" wasn't quite what I had in mind... to be honest, I was scared. An entire school year away to an unknown place?</p><p align="justify">‘Oh, being scared is perfectly normal,’ replied the wizard, whom I clearly hadn't fooled with my wording. ‘I understand that this must sound incredible to you and your parents, but you can't deny what you are. Hogwarts would provide you with the best magical education and with the best environment a young wizard could possibly wish for. But the choice, of course, is up to you.’</p><p align="justify">None of us said anything for some moments.</p><p align="justify">‘Would you show me some magic again, Mr. Landstone?’ I asked.</p><p align="justify">He smiled and waved his stick: tiny yellow birds came out of it, flying merrily around the room and then landing on my mum's shoulders.</p><p align="justify">We were amazed.</p><p align="justify">‘And you'll teach me how to do that?’</p><p align="justify">‘Actually yes, since I teach Transfiguration - but you'll learn much more than just making some birds appear. ’</p><p align="justify">‘Oh.’</p><p align="justify">A short silence, once again.</p><p align="justify">‘I'll think about that, Mr. Landstone.’</p>
