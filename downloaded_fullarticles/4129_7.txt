          <div class="userstuff"><p>It wasn't like there was anything Harry Potter could've done differently. Hey, he was himself. It was like he was slated to deal with all of this shit. And that was actually true, ever since his parents were murdered... Thinking about it still hurt of course but he had vowed to make their murderer pay for taking their lives. </p><p>Which was why he was here now, honestly. </p><p>Lord Voldemort stood before him. Harry couldn't look away. He was a bit incapacitated at the moment. Bleeding from a deep gash in his arm, and with the body of his friend just a mere few feet away... His heart broke all over again. </p><p>He didn't want anyone else to have to die for him.</p><p>His blood had already been mixed with Voldemort's. That protection was gone from him now. He took a deep breath, and wondered if he would get out of this. </p><p>"...here, now you have a piece of my soul," Voldemort said in his odd, high voice. </p><p>"Thanks." Harry muttered. "I hate it." </p><p>So what if his last words were just gonna be sass?</p></div>
