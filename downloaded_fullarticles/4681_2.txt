    <p>“Alright now class. One person from each team needs to try the potion and if you brewed it correctly then you will only get a foot shorter.” Professor Snape announced as he stalked around the class. “Let's hope you didn’t make it wrong.” <br/>Harry turns toward his partner, only half listening, “Do you want to try it Malfoy?” <br/>Malfoy opens one eye lazily, “No, you try it Potter. You’re short already anyway.” <br/>Shrugging, Harry pours some of the potion into a vial and then drinks it. It starts with the feeling of being plunged into ice cold water then turns to a sensation of being pricked by a thousand needles all over his body. Suddenly, Harry’s insides feel like they’re about to become his outsides.<br/>“I feel weird-” Harry says, wrapping his arms around himself. Malfoy is still just standing there beside him with his eyes closed like he has been all hour. Suddenly, Harry falls to the ground, shaking violently. His eyes roll back as his body starts to shrink much more than a foot.<br/>“Mr. Malfoy, what is going on here?” Professor Snape asks, stopping in front of their station. “Where is your partner?” he continues.<br/>Draco opens his eyes and looks over at Harry, but finds the space empty. “I don’t-” the blonde pauses as he hears a strange noise from the floor. Looking down he sees a pile of black fabric, Harry’s clothes. Something moves underneath. <br/>Reaching down, he pulls back the cloth to reveal an unconscious child of about four years old with dark hair and cat ears. <br/>Professor Snape comes around to see what Draco is staring at. After seeing the child he inspects their workspace and potion. After stirring the potion, Professor Snape turns to Draco, “You two made a deaging potion rather than a shrinking potion as I instructed. What do you have to say for yourself Mr. Malfoy?” <br/>Draco looked from the potion to the boy on the ground, “I didn’t - “ <br/>“You weren’t paying enough attention to realize that your partner was making the wrong potion, were you? Perhaps if you had been helping Potter rather than letting him do all the work this might have been prevented.” Professor Snape says. <br/>Draco stared in shock. This was probably the first time his Godfather had ever told him off in class. <br/>The rest of the class was shocked as well. <br/>“I’m sorry Professor- but why does he have cat ears?” Draco asks. <br/>Snape looks down at the deaged Harry Potter and realizes that he does indeed have cat ears. He turns, “Miss Granger, would you like to explain?” <br/>Hermione moves across the room and looks down at her friend, “He recently went through a creature inheritance, Sir.” she says.<br/>Snape frowns, “What creature?” he asks<br/>“Neko. He’s been glamouring his ears and tail to keep people from seeing them.” <br/>Snape looks down at Harry. With a wave of his wand and some whispered words Harry’s oversized clothes shrink to fit his small body.  Once clothed properly they are able to see the black tail coming out of the back of Harry’s trousers. <br/>“Neko’s have mates, do they not Miss Granger?” Snape asks, even though he probably already knows the answer. <br/>“Yes sir.” Hermione says, looking awkward. <br/>“Do you know who Potter’s mate is?” he asks. <br/>It is obvious by the look on Hermione’s face that she had not wanted him to ask that question, “I do not. Harry - wouldn’t tell me.” <br/>Understanding lights the Professor's eyes, “Ah, so he knows who his mate is - it must be someone he thinks won’t accept him or he wouldn’t be hiding it.” <br/>Draco, who had crouched down to inspect the deaged cat boy, looked up at them, “What does who his mate is have to do with him being deaged?” he asks.<br/>Snape blinks at him, “That is none of your concern, Mr. Malfoy. By the way, as soon as Potter is himself again you will both be serving detentions for this.” <br/>Draco was outraged, “Wha- me too?” <br/>“Yes.” Snape says. <br/>Draco looks like he might argue, despite the fearsome expression on his Godfather’s face, but then Harry moans. They all watch silently as he stretches and blinks open his big green eyes. <br/>	The little boy sits up and looks around. Immediately, his gaze fixes on Malfoy, who is crouched in front of him. “Hello,” he says shyly.<br/>“Hello -” Draco replies.<br/>Behind Harry, Snape mouths ‘Ask his name’.<br/>“Uh- can you tell me what your name is?” he asks.<br/>The little boy seems to think for a moment, “My name is Hawwy!” he says, his expression triumphant.<br/>Draco smiles, “Good, Harry, do you know who I am?” he asks. <br/>Harry scrunches up his face and scoots closer to Draco. Hesitantly, as though afraid of him, he sniffs at Draco’s knee. His expression clears and little Harry smiles, “You is my Mate!” he declares. <br/>Draco stiffens. Harry, sensing his distress and thinking he’s in trouble, starts backtracking in hopes of distracting the older boy from punishing him, “Me is vewy sowwy - maybe you just smells like my mate-” tears spring up in the little boy’s eyes. <br/>Fearing a meltdown, Snape crouches down next to the child, “It’s okay- Harry - he’s just a little surprised I think-”<br/>“He not mad?” Harry sniffles.<br/>“No, of course not. Harry, what did you mean when you said he smells like your mate?” Snape asks, his curiosity getting the better of him. <br/>“He - he smells like my mate-” Harry says, his face scrunched in confusion. <br/>Snape deflates, disappointed, “Yes, but how do you know what your mate smells like?” <br/>Harry thinks for a moment, “Me no know-” he says, looking upset again.<br/>“Oh, well, that’s okay- Draco?” Snape looks over at Draco, who blinks slowly. <br/>“He not sick is he?” Harry asks, staring at Draco’s unresponsive face. <br/>“No, no he isn’t sick.” Snape says. He reaches forward and shakes Draco’s shoulder. <br/>Draco’s head flops back and forward, but he still doesn’t respond.<br/>“Stop-you gonna hurt him!” Harry shrieks. He gets to his feet quickly, well, as quickly as a small child can, and toddles over to Draco. Hugging Draco around the middle. It’s obvious that this is an effort on Harry’s part to shield Draco with his body. He turns and glares at Snape, who is taken aback by the amount of venom a child so small can put in one look. <br/>By now the rest of the class has come over to observe the deaged Harry. Some of them have obviously taken the potion because they are shorter than before. Neville stands at his desk, staring down at something on the table. <br/>	It is at this moment that Draco finally gets his senses back. He looks down to see little Harry clutching tiny fistfulls of his shirt while glaring at Professor Snape, who was crouching a few feet away.<br/>“Did I miss something?” he asks. <br/>Harry gasps, his attention shifting from Professor Snape to Draco in a millisecond. <br/>“You is okay! You was all frozed and I hadz to ‘rotect you from the evil mister!” Harry crows, hugging Draco tighter. <br/>Evil Mister? Draco stares at the small cat boy, speechless as laughter erupts around the room. Harry turns toward the noise and, when he sees all the people, turns back to Draco and hides in his robes.  <br/>“What’s wrong, Harry?” Draco asks. He isn’t sure he believes that he’s Potter’s ‘mate’, but since he’s the only person the deaged boy seems to like right now it’s obvious that he must be responsible for him until Professor Snape manages to change him back. <br/>“Lotsa people-” Harry says, his voice muffled by Draco’s robes. <br/>Draco is about to answer when Harry suddenly snuggles closer to him.<br/>Draco looks awkwardly down at the small boy, “Um- Harry, what are you doing?” he asks.<br/>“Mate smells good,” Harry replies, sounding much less anxious than before. <br/>Fighting a blush, Draco looks to his Godfather for help.<br/>Snape, however, has his back turned and is filling a vial with Harry’s potion. <br/>“I will test this and make an antidote. In the meantime, Mr. Malfoy, you will keep Harry occupied. Class is dismissed.” <br/>While the rest of the class gathers their things and files out of the door, Draco lifts little Harry into his arms and stares and both of their things while wondering how he will carry Harry and their things. <br/>“Professor Snape? We have a problem-” Neville squeaks. <br/>“What is it now?” Snape gripes, turning toward the boy. <br/>Neville holds out his hand, on which stands a three inch tall Ron Weasley, “I think I messed up-” he whispers.<br/>Snape pinches the bridge of his nose, “ Really, how did you come to that conclusion, Mr. Longbottom?” <br/>Neville looks sheepish. <br/>~ ~ ~<br/>	Draco somehow manages to pack his and Harry’s bags and sling them both over his shoulder with one hand while Harry clutches his shoulder, remaining silent. Draco is grateful for this as he exits the dungeon classroom and heads toward the Slytherin Common Room. <br/>Unfortunately, he only gets a few feet away from the door when Harry starts talking again. <br/>“Does you not want to be my mate?” Harry asks, his bottom lip pokes out.<br/>Draco looks at him and tries to smile reassuringly, “It’s not that I don’t want to be your mate, it’s just that I didn’t expect to be your mate.” he says.  <br/>Harry’s wide eyes fill with tears, “You doesn’t want to be my mate,” he whispers.<br/>Draco doesn’t know what to say to this. <br/>Harry turns away so Draco can’t see his face and remains silent for the rest of the trip. Draco repeatedly looks over at the little boy’s flattened ears, guilt clawing at his insides. He wishes he knew what to say to make it better, but can think of nothing. Harry’s body trembles against his and although the cat boy is making no noise Draco is certain that he is crying. <br/>	Once they enter the common room, which is mercifully empty, Draco sits the bags down on a coffee table. Then he sits on the couch across from the table. He removes Harry from his shoulder and sits him on the couch next to him. Harry let's go easily and curls up on the cushion with his tail wrapped around his body.<br/>Draco feels worse than ever now, “Harry-” he reaches out his hand, but stops short of placing it on the small boy’s back. <br/>Harry’s ears perk up and twitch in his direction, betraying the cat boy’s appearance of pretending Draco isn’t there. <br/>This small action gives Draco the courage to touch the small boy, “I’m sorry, Harry. I didn’t mean to upset you. I honestly don’t know whether or not I want to be your mate.”<br/>“Reawwy?” Harry whispers, his voice breaking.<br/>“Yeah, and - you can call me Draco if you want-”<br/>Harry sits up and rubs his eyes with his hands, “Dway-co? That you name?” he asks.<br/>The blonde nods, “Yup.”<br/>Harry hiccups a sob and shifts closer to Draco, “Can I sit in you lap Dwayco?” The little boy turns a puffy eyed, pleading look up at the older boy. <br/>Draco sighs, his heart warming slightly toward the little cat boy when he says his name like that, “Sure.” he says, grabbing the little boy around the middle and lifting him onto his lap. <br/>Harry snuggles against Draco’s chest with a shy smile. Draco, not knowing what else to do, starts petting the cat boy’s ears. <br/>Harry hums happily and leans into Draco’s hand, “Hmm, that feels good Dway-” The blonde smiles and continues, inside he’s shocked that he’s actually enjoying this. <br/>Unexpectedly, but not at all surprisingly, Harry starts making a vibrating noise which seems to be coming from his chest area. “Are you purring?” Draco asks, laughing.<br/>Harry only hums again in response. <br/>Draco then realizes that Harry’s body has gone slack. He stops rubbing his ears and inspects the boy, “Don’ stop-” Harry protests feebly. His eyes drift closed.<br/>“Harry, you’re falling asleep!” Draco says, amused.<br/>Harry forced his eyes open again, “no’m not,” he yawns hugely, “ I’m awake.” <br/>“Harry-” Draco starts.<br/>“Pwease- Pwease Dwayco.” Harry pleaded, looking sleepily up at Draco. The blonde sighs in defeat, “Fine.” He says, returning to petting the cat boy’s ears. Harry smiles beatifically and lays his head back on Draco’s chest. A moment later he is snoring softly. <br/>Draco moves to lay the sleeping child down on the couch beside him, but the moment the child leaves his arms he groans and begins to stir. Not wanting him to wake up, Draco winds up lying on the couch with deaged Harry lying on top of him.</p>
