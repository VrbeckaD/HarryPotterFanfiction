    <p>"Dorm check!"</p><p>The words were so sudden, so quick, and Hermione was caught with her clothes off. All of her clothes. Caught naked and yelling in utter panic in the face of the sudden bursting open of the door, as Cormac McLaggen stood in the doorway looking around quickly, at least until his eyes settled onto the naked brunette standing in front of him. He was shirtless, his muscular body glistening with sweat as he stood panting in the doorway, like he had been running a lot, but all of his attention now fell onto Hermione.</p><p>Standing in the middle of the room completely naked and not immediately near anything to touch, Hermione yelped and screamed in utter panic, hands trying to cover her groin and her arm going over her breasts as she yelled, "You could have knocked, Cormac! This is the girls' dorm, how are you even up here?" </p><p>"Prefect business," Cormac explained, stepping into the room and shutting the door behind him. "We were told to check all the dorm rooms for stink bombs, I was coming to get you." While closing the door at least kept other people from peeking in to gawk at the naked Hermione, the fact he was on the other side left her furious.</p><p>"And why are you shirtless?" There was no coming down from this surge of panic-driven yelling for Hermione. She had been caught completely off by Cormac.</p><p>"Just got back from Quidditch practice when they told us. I was changing." His eyes continued to stare at Hermione, doing little to ease up or bring her any comfort at all, the pressure of his intentions really getting to her as she continued to try and cover herself up, and she did not do a very good job at all. "Hey Granger, nice tits."</p><p>"Go away," she said, cheeks burning up as she felt the pressure hit her, not even remotely ready to deal with this shit today. "Why anyone thought a vain, aggressive, impolite, crude boy like you should be a prefect is beyond me. This might be the first time I've even seen you do any work as a prefect; I thought you only accepted the job so you could bring girls to the prefect's bathroom for a snog."</p><p>"Why, did you want to go?" Cormac asked, drawing a surprised, sharp noise from Hermione. He drew closer, eyeing her up and down. "I like a cute girl with some brains, and you have a great body. Maybe we can blow off the stink bomb thing and settle into a warm bath together, you and I. You must regret not taking a ride during the Christmas party and being a huge bitch to me instead, but I'll tell you what. Put that hot little mouth of yours to work 'apologizing' to me, and I'll forgive you for it all and give you the best fuck you've ever had."</p><p>The utterly ego-drunk crudeness with which Cormac spoke should have disgusted and infuriated Hermione. He was absolutely out of line with everything he said, and she wanted to slap him, if not for the fact it would have given her a better look at her most intimate places. But frustratingly, as she tried to make sense of this insane situation upon her. She had no idea how to respond to any of this, but for some reason she found herself dealing with even more and worse than that in the form of a spiraling ache inside of her. Something about his words turned her on. She didn't want it at all, but her eyes began to pay closer, hotter attention to his strong, muscular chest, body aching with the pulse of a guilty rush of desire that she wished so strongly that she could push against and fight off, but she found herself sinking impossibly into lust.</p><p>"You should leave now," she said, voice trembling with frustrated and conflicted feelings.</p><p>Cormac picked up on it too. He had absolutely no sense for what someone was thinking and what they thought, an inconsiderate and self-absorbed egomaniac who only cared about himself. But when a girl was ogling him, he took notice. It was the only time he ever did. And Hermione was definitely interested. He closed the gap between them, shoving the hand over her groin away and replacing it with his own, cupping her mound and locking eyes with her as he made his move. "Tell me again," he said, and sank a finger into her, making Hermione gasp as he began to rock the single digit in and out of her. "Fuck, you're wet."</p><p>Every bit of resistance and sternness Hermione had been desperately trying to muster up into a cohesive front melted away with the penetration of even just one finger inside of her, a nervous gasp following as her body shivered and she sank into his touch, chewing her lower lip, eyes drifting all over his shirtless, glistening body more and more, confused and dizzy under this mess. She felt a need pulsing within her, something powerful and primal, begging her to give in to it. "I want to..." She drifted off, head rolling back, eyes struggling to pull away from his sweaty pecs, but she couldn't. "I want to worship your body with my mouth."</p><p>Hands so quickly forced Hermione down that she didn't realize what was happening for a second, coming face to face with Cormac's abs as she was shoved down to her knees, but she didn't hesitate for a moment, shoving forward and letting the delirium rule her as she pushed her face in and began to drag her tongue along his body, hands grabbing his hips and fingers digging into the loops of his jeans. Hermione felt herself overcome by the pulse of something weird and hazy, something that she didn't know how to deal with, but which ignited within her a kind of want that she couldn't ignore.</p><p>Hermione started at his abs, tongue slithering its way in between each individually defined muscle. She could taste the sweat on him, the exertion heavy upon him from Quidditch practice and probably from running to grab her, too. she wasn't even sure why she was doing this when they apparently had prefect duties to take care of, but Hermione was so completely lost to these desires now that she couldn't bring herself to care or to stop this, letting the desires do to her things she felt almost embarrassed about. Her tongue continued to lick and adore and embrace the swell of something so twisted and needy inside of her that she really had no idea how to deal with it. She had never before been this turned on and this available to someone at the same time.</p><p>Further up his torso she went, moaning her way along the caress up toward his pecs. Her tongue grew more comfortable and eager with each pass of her loving attention. The swell of desire bubbling inside of her was something so hazy and intense that Hermione wondered if there was something wrong with her as she licked the sweat up off of Cormac's body, if he'd taken some kind of pheromone-based love potion or if she'd been hit by a curse and didn't even know it. This was all so ridiculous and so insane for her, and the more she gave up to it the less she felt like she really understood how to handle it all.</p><p>"Now isn't this all much better?" Cormac asked, allowing Hermione to adore him. "I knew brainy girls like you all wanted hunky guys to pin them down and fuck them. Weasley and Potter don't have bodies like me. You know it, I know it. You want a real man, and I'm going to give you that." His hand reached around back to smack at Hermione's ass, drawing a surprised noise from her lips as she got up to his neck and his shoulders, licking him all over, desperation guiding her down deep into the throes of something so hazy and so powerful that she was left desperate, aching, craving him. </p><p>Hermione wished she didn't, wished she was stronger than this. More capable of composing herself. But the taste of his sweat was intoxicating, and her hands grabbing at his muscular torso and his jeans gave her even more helpless feelings of desire and interest. She needed him, and she couldn't help herself now. "On the bed," she whined, not even wasting a second in shoving him back, walking him up to the edge of a bed. Not even her bed; she was pretty sure she'd shoved a sweaty and hot Cormac onto Lavender's bed. Fitting. If she was going to get fucked by the guy she wanted to make Ron jealous with, where better to do it than on Lavender's bed.</p><p>"You can get my pants off for me," Cormac said, letting Hermione do all the work in tugging them off. Tugging them off was a struggle with his shoes in the way, so she pulled them off too, throwing them to the ground in impassioned, fervid need, the desperation getting to her as she got toward his boxers and pulled them right off, gasping in raw arousal at the sight of his cock, which even at half-mast was so impressive that Hermione wanted to worship it. Her head swam with a lust for the male form that she had never felt before, every part of Cormac deserving of her undivided attention, and with his legs still in the air so she could undress him, her attention settled very quickly onto the nearest part of him she could get: his feet.</p><p>With no idea what was coming over her, Hermione pushed forward and began to lick Cormac's left foot. She'd never paid any mind to feet before, but as she threw herself into this mess she felt herself so overwhelmed and needy that it didn't matter to her now. She craved it, begging for the chance to indulge now as she licked his foot all over, holding onto his ankle and keeping it in the air. "Lick my foot, Granger. Be my little bookworm slut and clean it all off. You can't give me a tongue bath without getting at my feet. Make sure to suck on the toes, too."</p><p>To be spoken to like this should have infuriated Hermione, should have driven her mad. But she couldn't help herself now, as she licked her way up his sole toward his toes, tongue slithering in between each individual digit before sucking on his big toe. Her eyes closed as all this delirious heat and excitement got to her, and a clueless Hermione felt more and more invested with each passing second in the chance to throw herself at the opportunity. She wished she could tell him not to talk to her that way. Instead, she moaned around his toes as she sucked on them, her tongue happily surrendering everything to the guilty thrill of servitude and submission that she found herself taken by.</p><p>Cormac's other foot received the same treatment. Of course it did. She was lost now to this desperation, to the aches within her that had her legs trembling and her body seeking utter surrender. His sweat had her hooked now, and her head swirled with all manner of dizzying delights and ideas, sinking into the hunger and chaos of the moment readily. Down she went, deeper, hotter, embracing her passions and letting something different come over her. Worshiping Cormac's feet was not her proudest moment, but it was what Hermione felt herself ready to give in to as she adored him thoroughly before even thinking about moving on.</p><p>But once she did, Hermione didn't actually pull her tongue back to do it. She licked her way down Cormac's leg, adoring her way slowly down, licking up more sweat along the way as her eyes drifted back toward his. Unable to tear her gaze away from him, there was nothing but heat and passion to adore Hermione as she let the pleasure hold so tight onto her, as she embraced this chaos and this desire. She traced in closer and closer, watching Cormac's cock now standing rigid and ready, aching with need. The desperation ruling Hermione now felt untenable, but she was in far too deep now to pull herself from this descent downward into madness.</p><p>The crease between thigh and pelvis brought Hermione right up by his cock, cheek brushing along it, and if there was a point of no return it was probably this, but even still she pressed on. "Your cock is so big," she moaned, voice rumbling with drunken glee as she brought her tongue along his flesh, tracing around his cock first as best she could, up to his waist to tease him a little bit. Her hands settled onto his thighs, eyes beady and aching. She trembled, tongue tracing back the way it came and took its sweet time in drifting its way toward his cock. Once she actually did this, it was going to be  madness, and Hermione didn't want to hold anything back. She needed this, no matter how insane it was.</p><p>So she licked along his cock, whimpering in submissive glee at the way it twitched and ached against her touch. "Only a real slut would be able to cover this cock with spit," he groaned. "But you're a real slut aren't you, Granger? A dirty bookworm whore finally getting her taste of a real man. A real, sweaty, hard working man fresh off the Quidditch field. How does a real man taste?"</p><p>"So good!" The whine came so hot and so intense that Hermione really didn't really know how to handle it all. She was lost to this pressure, this haze, leaning into the madness and accepting that she was too far gone to stop herself now. She worshiped his cock the same way she had worshiped every other part of him, dragging her tongue along with desperate motions that painted his cock with her spit. She got heavier with her licking, lost to the spiraling haze of something upon her that felt so intense and so hot that she didn't really know how to deal with it all, but she knew she needed it, craved it. Back and forth she licked with desperate motions driven by an intense hunger, by desire, by something too hot and too insane to be able to control.</p><p>Being spoken to so crudely and insulted by Cormac should not have done to Hermione the things it did, but she felt so wet as she adored his cock, driving her licks on harsher, needier, wanting to show him that she was a 'real slut', to meet his expectations. Why? She hadn't the foggiest idea what was happening to her, but there was no way she could hold back this need, throwing herself into the chance to service his cock and praise it thoroughly. Whatever this was, she felt ready for it, accepting the deepening lusts dragging her down into the thrall of chaos and acceptance, left aching for something primal, something hot.</p><p>Once his cock was completely slathered with her spit, she drew back drunkenly, moaning, "I did it. I'm a real whore, aren't I?" She wasn't sure why she wanted to be, but Cormac's dominant approval had become all she wanted, staring hungrily at him, chewing her bottom lip and seeking more. "I need to know." She didn't wait for him to say one way or another before she began to paint his balls with a layer of spit too, desperately seeking more indulgence, more pressure. This was ecstasy to Hermione and she didn't want to let up for a minute on any of it.</p><p>"A real whore would eat her man's ass and show him that she knows her place." Cormac didn't think about if he was pushing things too far or testing Hermione's limits; he wasn't about that sort of understanding or considerate. He thought only of what he wanted, and right now the idea of getting the lustful bookworm to tongue his ass. To succumb to his even more thoroughly and intensely. The sweet thrill of making Hermione sink deeper with him into these lusts proved too intoxicating to help. His hand reached down between his legs and already started to nudge her down, impatiently craving the chance to deprave her.</p><p>Hermione didn't fight against the idea. She couldn't. Her head sank slowly down, tongue tracing along his balls and down his taint. She couldn't believe this was happening. Cormac was the very ideal of everything that repulsed her in a man, but she was so overtaken by a curious hunger and a need to serve that she went with his words. She brought herself down, hands grabbing his legs and lifting them up, shifting Cormac and his strong, muscular body so that she could get at his ass more readily. The wanton heat that gripped her felt so bizarre, so hot, so unlike anything she really knew what to do with, but she craved it too hard to help as she shoved forward and let her tongue get to work.</p><p>Licking a man's ass was a new sort of insanity for Hermione, something she had never felt herself plunge into the depths of before, but the potent, lustful swell was something so incredible that she just had to give in to it. Her tongue reached his hole and didn't hesitate to begin licking and dragging along the tight pucker, her moans reaching their peak as she let herself get deeper into the lust-drunk haze of something so out there and different that her mind didn't really have a way to process this all. Back and forth she licked with a loving caress and steady acceptance of these sensations and the weird pulses of raw heat that ruled her so tightly now. The steady licks and hungry attention she paid to this cock were driven by something absolutely unchecked and unchained, a level of ferocity spiraling off into surrender and hunger.</p><p>"Lick my ass, Granger!" Cormac yelled, fingers tightening in her hair as he tugged her in deeper, his legs up in the air, cock throbbing under the excitement of this treatment. "Lick it all over and show me what a dirty little rimjob whore you really are. I knew underneath that bookworm exterior there was a nasty slut waiting for am an to come along and fuck her like she needed, and you're not even pretending now that you don't want me." The words fueled Hermione's licks, drove her to give herself up completely to this mess. She had no idea how to make sense of this, how to deal with this hazy surrender and the molten thrill of giving up everything to the moment, but she couldn't help herself now, unable to contain the swell of raw heat and desire overwhelming her so thoroughly.</p><p>Under all the attention Hermione gave him, Cormac wasn't going to last too long. He was having the time of his life giving in to it all, but she had been licking his body, his cock, and now gave him a rimjob, and the accumulation of all that pleasure had him overwhelmed. His cock throbbed and ached with excitement, winding toward a powerful orgasm, and as he took hold of his shaft it wasn't to stroke himself to completion, just to tilt his cock toward his stomach as he let himself go, groaning, "You're a real whore, Granger. A real whore who finally knows her fucking place!" as he came. His cock erupted with hot gushes of molten seed splattering all over his core, leaving his abs with sticky, rich spunk waiting to be cleaned up.</p><p>Hermione drew back from Cormac's ass hole, panting and twitching under the weird and hazy pressure of what she had just done. She barely understood it all herself, so dizzy and needy, left aching with the pulse of something so strange and hungry, but she still hadn't the slightest idea what washed over her. It didn't matter, though; as she stared at Cormac's aching cock and the cum all over his abs, she couldn't keep her thoughts straight, still aching for more, craving whatever insanity she felt herself ready now to sink into. Pushing slowly forward, Hermione didn't actually wait for Cormac to say anything before she grabbed hold of her breasts, advancing upon him steadily.</p><p>"Your cock is still hard," she moaned, wrapping her breasts around his shaft, still slick from the thick layer of spit she'd slathered it with. "A real man isn't done after one load, and a real whore doesn't stop until her man is satisfied." To call herself that, to call him that... Hermione knew she was even further gone than she realized, but she couldn't hold herself back from this mess, starting to titfuck Cormac's cock, eyes staring lustfully across his body. The cum all over his abs called to her, and Hermione couldn't control herself as she ached with desire to give him whatever he wanted, desperate and confused, hungrily craving the chance to succumb to something mad, something untamed.</p><p>So she leaned forward, pushing his cock down as she continued to work her breasts up and down needily along his length, but she added in more of that sloppy, wanton worship she was having so much fun with. Her tongue danced along his abs, seeking to lick up all of the cum from his muscular core. The salty, pungent flavour should have been worse to her taste buds than it really was, but then, so should all of this. Instead, she found herself enthralled by the way his cum lingered on her tongue, the strong flavour of it leaving her even more lustful, her pussy dripping all over her thighs and down onto the floor as she let the idea of succumbing completely overwhelm her. Nothing could hold her back now from this push into madness, from this reckless shove onward and a desire to lose all control.</p><p>"That's a good slut," Cormac groaned, watching Hermione so hungrily lick his abs clean. "Clean up your mess while you get me off. Shit, I knew you had this in you the whole time. You should have been underneath me every night since that party, but we've got time to change that now. I'm going to treat you like a nasty whore and you're going to like it."</p><p>Hermione would. She wished she could hate that fact, wished she had the strength to be reasonable and composed, but she couldn't. She craved every bit of this crude domination she could get, lost to the idea of so completely giving in to the depravity of one pigheaded, self-absorbed man like this. It was so unlike her, but there wasn't anything she felt capable of doing to stop this, lost to something so tense and hazy that she found herself craving his words coming to fruition. The idea of submission should not have been so appealing to Hermione, should not have done to her as much as this did, but as she gave up to it all she found herself craving it, throwing all caution to the wind and embracing her most desperate and wanton of desires.</p><p>Grinding her breasts harder up and down his cock, Hermione let herself go, embracing her most wicked of desires and letting the idea of coming undone completely consume her. Back and forth she moved, treating the cock to all of her needy, lustful attention, allowing herself to burn under the consuming heat and haze of her own needy desires and desperations. Cormac should have repulsed her on every level, should have driven her away. He already had once before. But she'd been thinking about him emotionally and as a person. Now, she thought of him as a body. As a glorious, muscular body she needed to worship, as a man with a huge cock, and once she allowed herself to sink into that frame of mind even his crude and foul mouthed ideas began to appeal to her. It was wrong, and she knew it, but she also knew she was so full of lust and desire that nothing could hold her back from this mess.</p><p>Once she had painstakingly licked up every drop of cum and all that was left upon his glistening abs was a thin veneer of spit, Hermione craned her head up toward Cormac. "It's finished now, so we can worry about your cum. Where do you want to plant this load?'</p><p>"In my dorm room."</p><p>The words threw Hermione out of her daze a little bit, frustrated and dizzy under the pressure of what he said. Cormac threw Hermione completely out of focus with the intention, left her aching and twisting in weird, hazy confusion as she looked at him, trying to make sense of what he meant. "In what?" she asked.</p><p>But Cormac held firm, pushing Hermione back and away from his cock. "Throw something on. I'm going to fuck that ripe little pussy of yours in front of my mates so they can see that I'm telling the truth when I say that I own Hermione Granger's cunt."<br/>
*************************<br/>
Down on her hands and knees in the Gryffindor seventh year boys' dorm, Hermione was naked and eager, her ass up high and her face low as a gaggle of horny, cheering boys all watched Cormac get into position. The insanity of being dominated in front of people made this all the more insane and hazy for poor Hermione to try and deal with, as she struggled to make sense of this whole insane mess. What was she supposed to do about any of this? Aside from putting a stop it, of course, because the last thing she wanted was to hold back anything she was doing, craving the chance to give in to this furor, this panic.</p><p>"Fuck me, Cormac," she moaned, biting her lip as she accepted this all, the boys cheering louder and noisier as Cormac thrust forward, his massive cock shunting into her waiting pussy, and as he filled her, Hermione's body shuddered and surged with delirious need, craving this in a way more brazen and panicked than she really understood. Hermione was past the point of no return now, and she craved the chance to be ravaged, his big dick stuffing her, stretching her, letting her feel something more intense and more intoxicating than she could have ever handled.</p><p>"Dirty little slut licked my ass hole. You think she's doing that for that runt Weasley? No boys, this ripe bitch is all mine now." Cormac didn't hold back any of his bragging as he hammered into Hermione from behind, one hand gripping her hip tightly while the other crashed down across her round backside again and again, repeated strikes flaunting his dominance over the situation and over her, so careless and shameless in how he thoroughly use and enjoyed Hermione. There was nothing but want left in him now as he pounded away, merciless and tense in how he fucked her, how he laid claim to her in front of his friends.</p><p>"You're a real man, Cormac!" Hermione whined, biting her lip. Her head rolled back as she faced all the leering boys staring at her, cheering and celebrating the sight of Hermione getting taken. She felt like she had entered a different world now. A world of unchecked, wild masculinity, a world where she was a prize instead of just some nerdy bookworm nobody paid any mind to. A world where a huge cock laying waste to her was all she really wanted and any sense of control melted away from her with such utter vigor that she could nothing but give in to all of it, throwing herself down into the madness of getting fucked and letting Cormac do whatever he damn well pleased to her body. It was a kind of open, hopeless surrender that should not have felt as good as it did, but Hermione was well past the point of no return now.</p><p>Hard, steady thrusts shook Hermione's body, left her dizzy and aching with need as Cormac continued to pound away at her with merciless glee, showing her something intoxicating, something primal, something that she hadn't even the slightest idea how to handle or control. His cock was just too good for her to resist, as her hips pressed back to meet his thrusts and she gave herself up to the utterly uncontrolled hunger that ruled her mind and her body alike. No hesitating, no holding back, no moment of sense or control or understanding. She was too far gone for any of that now, wanting only to be fucked and claimed, to be taken.</p><p>Even if it was in front of people. Even if Cormac treated her like a trophy and smacked her ass. It was wrong to be this far gone and Hermione knew it, but she was so thoroughly lost to this mess of hunger and need that she didn't care, abandoning all sense and all composure to give herself to this relentless pulse of hunger thoroughly, accepting that she was too far gone for anything now to bother her or hold her back. This was all she needed, all she wanted, and Hermione was well past the point now of being able to control herself.</p><p>After all the licking and worship and the build up, Hermione was such a mess of lust and tension that she didn't have any hope of lasting all that long under the pressure of Cormac's steady and dominant thrusts. He laid claim to her and left her such a dizzy and hopeless wreck that she never stood a chance of controlling herself here, lost to the unraveling, dizzy pulse of pure need that hit her so hard, left struggling and shuddering under this rush of desire until finally she should take no more. Hermione came, and she came hard, howling and screaming in molten bliss under this attention and this need, thrashing through the delirium and the want too powerfully to control herself.</p><p>"Cum in me," she screamed, one final mark of acceptance as she slammed back against Cormac, feeling the eyes and the pressure, the heat of being claimed and used. There was no turning back from this now as she pleaded with him, "Make me yours!" but in the heat of the moment she didn't think about anything but the lust she wanted right then and there. With an eager rush of excitement, Cormac slammed forward, burying himself balls deep into Hermione's spasming twat and filling her full of cum, igniting sensations within Hermione so primal and so dizzying that she was left wondering why she would have ever wanted anything else. She had lost herself completely, but she had never been happier to be lost.</p><p>Maybe she was going to regret it in the morning. Maybe she'd be sick with herself and rumours would spread like wildfire. But it wasn't morning yet, and as Cormac rolled her onto her back and slammed his dick into her again she could do nothing but howl in ecstasy as he told her she was going to put on a show for his friends and tell them how much she loved his cock.</p>
