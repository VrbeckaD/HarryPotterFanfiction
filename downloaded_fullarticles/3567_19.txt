<p>Confession</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>“…were right, Al. Turns out I’m addicted to…oh, hey, Dad!”</p>
<p>“Jamie. Al. Did you just say addicted, Jamie? You…you know you can talk to me about anything, right? I promise not to be upset, even if it’s something of which you think I won’t approve.” </p>
<p>“Yeah… Dad, are you okay? You look upset.” </p>
<p>“I’m not, I just want you to be straight with me.” </p>
<p>
  <small>“Heh. <i>Straight</i> may not be the best choice of word here, Dad.”</small>
</p>
<p>“Shut it, Al! And I’m always…straight with you, Dad. Why?” </p>
<p>“Because I want to know if my son’s on illegal potions!”</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>“On potions? What…Oh! Addicted. Right. Er, no, sorry. Well, I don’t mean sorry I’m not on potions, but sorry, that’s not what we were talking about…Stop laughing, Al, this isn’t funny!”</p>
<p>“Except it totally is. And just so you know, you idiot, Dad guessed about you ages ago.” </p>
<p>“He did?” </p>
<p>“I have?” </p>
<p>“Salazar help me. Okay. Dad, Jamie’s got something to tell you. <i>Not</i> about illegal potions. Dad, you know this already but try to act surprised, yeah?” </p>
<p>“Stop talking, Al. Jamie, what is he talking about?” </p>
<p>“Ugh, fine. I’m gay, Dad!”</p>
<p>“Oh, that? Al’s right. I knew.”</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>“What? But…how, Dad?” </p>
<p>“You’ve never been good at hiding it. I knew when you told me you planned to marry Kingsley when you grew up.” </p>
<p>“I was five!” </p>
<p>“Yes.” </p>
<p>“Damn!” </p>
<p>“What?” </p>
<p>“I hate when Al’s right.” </p>
<p>“You’re having a rough life then, bro, since I’m <i>always</i> right.” </p>
<p>“Shut it! Wanker.”  </p>
<p>“James! Language.” </p>
<p>“Sorry, Dad.” </p>
<p>“Anyway, so when you were talking about being addicted you meant—”</p>
<p>“To my new boyfriend.” </p>
<p>“Are you blushing? Salazar, you’re hooked.” </p>
<p>“Shush, Al. So, who’s this paragon?” </p>
<p>“You’ll love him, Dad. It’s Scorpius Malfoy. Dad? Dad!?” </p>
<p>“I think you killed him, Jamie.” </p>
<p>“Shut it, Al!”</p>
