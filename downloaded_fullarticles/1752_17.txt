    <p>“Just take a minute and <em>breathe</em>, Y/L/N..”<b><br/></b></p>
<p>Vixen Crabapple encouraged you from across the table, a weary expression settling gently over her sharp features as you locked your heated gaze towards the other end of the Great Hall, on the lady of the hour, <em>Pansy Parkinson</em>. She sat among Draco’s friends with a smug grin on her face as she leaned forward, casually gossiping across the table to another sixth year, her eyes occasionally flitting in your direction before a string of giggles escaped the two. Breathing was the <em>last</em> of your worries, and your roommate’s inability to understand that was beginning to shave away at your already wavering nerves. You shot her an irritated look from the corner of your eye, trying to ignore the pit in your stomach. Your anger was coming in waves, like scalding steam that built up within you, burning you as it valiantly tried to claw its way out and onto anyone in your path. Pansy had listened in on a conversation after the last quidditch match, and learned of your feelings for Slytherin’s golden-boy, <em>Draco Malfoy</em>. Much to your dismay, you’d been head over heels for the blonde since third year, and he’d never once acknowledged your existence― which you had begrudgingly made peace with a long time ago. You’d managed to keep this little secret to the knowledge of very few people, until Parkinson decided to weasel her obnoxiously upturned snout where it didn’t belong, just as she always did. Now everyone knew, and you had decidedly tolerated her torture long enough.</p>
<p>You shoved yourself out of your seat as a peal of obnoxious laughter emitted from Pansy, ignoring Vixen’s pleading protests from behind you as you shoved her from behind. “Oi!” you snapped, your nails digging into the palms of your hands as they held fists at your sides. “Got something to say, <em>Parkinson</em>?” You barely recognized your own voice as it dripping fire and ice, watching as she shot out of her seat with a glare, only for a smug grin to tug the edges of her lips once she realized who you were. “Finally gone mad, have you, Y/L/N?” she had her arms crossed over her chest, mock amusement swimming in her irises as she gave you a once over. You were seething at the arrogance that oozed from her every pore, the pride that she had in exposing something you had held private. You were too caught in your own head to find a quick reaction, so she leaned toward you with her chin raised confidently. “I haven’t got anything to say to you, <em>half-blood</em>.”</p>
<p>That was the breaking point of your patience, your hand coming in contact with her face in an audible smack that sent her back a few steps. You were blinded by a five-course serving of rage, its bitter flavor mingling with the metallic twang of adrenaline on your tongue in a manner that was surprisingly satisfying. You pointed at her with a livid sneer, stepping up into her face as you spoke. “You keep your pretentious, intermeddling ass out of my bloody business, <em>Pugface</em>, or on Salazar I’ll―” you were interrupted as she swiftly stepped into your space, stood nose-to-nose with you, dark eyes blazing. “You’ll <em>what</em>, Y/L/N?”</p>
<p>You opened your mouth to speak, but fell silent when you felt a hand on your shoulder, separating the both of you from your primal stance. Draco stood glancing between the both of you in confusion, brows knit together. You felt your blood run cold at the sight of him, pulling away from his touch as if he’d burned you, much to Pansy’s delight. Her face had twisted into a look of pure satisfaction, her smirk returning to its usual resting on her face. “Anyone want to tell me what’s going on?” he exclaimed. </p>
<p>Had it been any other moment, you would’ve taken the opportunity to appreciate how gorgeous Draco was, even as his features contorted in worry. What you did instead, however, was push past the both of them in a panic as you ran out of the Great Hall, tears stinging your eyes.  </p>
<p>You weren’t sure how you’d managed to navigate the halls with such efficiency, but once you were properly winded, you pressed your back against one of the cold walls of the common room. A couple gasping sobs leaving you before you managed to get hold of yourself. You felt like your life was spiraling. As if allowing yourself to lose your temper in front of the <em>entire </em>school, and having everyone know you were in love with Malfoy wasn’t enough, now you’d made a fool of yourself in front of him. “Y/N? S’that you, lovely?” Vixen called softly, rounding the corner to find you just inside the entry, her expression softening.</p>
<p>She didn’t push you to say anything, just slid down the wall next to you and patting the spot beside her on the rug. “That was quite impressive, you know..” Vixen commented, grinning as she caught the light smile you gave, joining her on the floor. “<em>Nasty</em> one, that Parkinson. I’ve never seen anyone stand up to her like that! You’re a hero, really..” she trailed off, causing you to glance up at her, met with the playful look in her sideways glance. You rolled your eyes in return. Dread had begun creeping over you like an icy chill, numbing your brain as you processed what you’d just done; you’d just painted a target on your back in the presence of someone who held detrimental arrows. Though words had never bothered you, there was no avoiding her revenge for that slap. You felt like a cow being herded into the truck for the slaughter, only a cow didn’t know where it was headed. You weren’t allowed that luxury. Having fallen silent for longer than  intended, you were staring out the window to the floor of the lake, and Vixen could practically hear the gears turning in your head.</p>
<p>“Everything will be alright, you know.” she sighed, nudging your shoulder with her own. “You’ll figure a way to get yourself out of this mess, you always do.”</p>
<p>You hoped she was right, because you weren’t sure what was in store if you didn’t.</p>
