    <p>
  <span>Hermione loved her job as an Unspeakable. Every day brought a new challenge and kept her mind busy. After leaving Hogwarts with seven NEWTs, she received job offers from most departments within the Ministry. She had spent a long time deciding between Department of Magical Creatures and the Department of Mysteries, but in the end decided being stuck behind a desk fighting for creature rights would not be engaging enough for her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>After working for the Ministry for the last five years, she knew she had made the right choice. While she still loved to read and spent days researching, growing up with Harry Potter had left her with a need for adventure; something fighting the Wizengamot just couldn’t give her. At least as an Unspeakable she was able to go out into the field occasionally. The hardest part of her job was not being able to tell her friends what she worked on all day, especially when it was something really exciting like today. Luckily, she could talk to a few of them who had security clearance to enter the Department of Mysteries. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Like Minister for Magic, Kingsley Shacklebolt, who was currently down in her office looking at a new item that had been given to her two days ago. Bill Weasley had brought it in on Wednesday. After the final battle, he had started working for the Ministry as an Unspeakable. Kingsley had to pay him handsomely to get him to leave Gringotts, but the Ministry was in desperate need of curse breakers and Kingsley trusted Bill. He had dealing with a cave in Scotland when he found the amulet and a tome that, from what Hermione had discovered in the last two days, covered the powers of the amulet. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>According to the book, the amulet was created by Morgana Le Fey when she was practising Necromancy. The power of the amulet was palpable, even when you weren’t touching it. Magic seemed to pulse from it. The amulet was about half the size of Hermione’s palm, and was made from goblin-wrought silver. From everything Hermione had read, it was safe to touch, but you had to be careful what you said while touching it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well, Hermione, what is it you wanted to show me that was so urgent?” Kingsley asked as he looked over the items on her desk. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“This appears to be the amulet of Morgana le Fey so she could resurrect people.” Hermione explained. “From what I read, it is not like the Resurrection Stone. As you know, that only brings back a shadow of the person. According to this book, this brings the person back in perfect health. It clears them of all magical ailments or any curses they might have been under.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Fascinating. And scary if it falls into the wrong hands.” Reaching down, Kingsley went to touch the amulet before pausing to look at Hermione. With her nod of approval, he picked it up. “It can bring anyone back from the dead?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Correct.” Hermione replied. “I have not been able to find anything that states the person has to have died recently. She wrote about bringing back her sister who had died thirty years before.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Thirty years? And her sister was healthy?” Kingsley asked, looking amazed. He turned the amulet over in his hands.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“According to this tome she was. Morgana’s sister is who wrote it. She said she was free from the blood curse that was placed upon her by her father’s neighbour.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So it could bring back anyone? I could say ‘I want to resurrect Severus’? Or even Vol-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Fuck!” Hermione screeched, cutting him off before he could finish saying the Dark Lord’s name. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You have to Apparate us to the Shrieking Shack. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Now</span>
  </em>
  <span>,” she yelled. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her heart was pounding. They needed to get to Hogsmeade right away.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hermione, what is going on?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’ll tell you in a second. We have to go. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Now</span>
  </em>
  <span>. Kings, you’re the only one that can Apparate from here.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Damn Ministry and their rules.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She knew Kingsley had no idea what was going on, and hoped he trusted her enough to do what she said and not ask questions. Wrapping her in his arms, he dropped the amulet on her desk before turning on the spot.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Landing a few hundred meters from the shack, Hermione took off towards the dilapidated building at a run. Kings pulled on Hermione’s arm, urging her to slow down. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hermione, tell me what is happening,” he demanded.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hermione didn’t break stride. They had no time to spare. “I told you that amulet is old. Older than the standard spells we use now. The tome explained how the amulet works. All you have to do it think of the person you want to bring back, picture them in your mind, and speak their name.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Are you telling me I just brought Severus back from the dead?” Kingsley blanched.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes.” </span>
  <em>
    <span>Finally he gets it.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Fuck.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“My sentiments exactly.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“But he died six years ago.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I know he did. I was bloody there wasn’t I? I told you it can bring back people who were long dead,” Hermione explained.                                 </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They were getting closer, and while she still ran towards the shack, Hermione wanted to turn and run the other way. What if something had gone wrong? Would she see his broken body, blood pouring from his mangled neck? She still had nightmares about his death.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lifting her wand, Hermione blast the door to the shack open. Sitting on the floor, exactly where he had died, and not looking any happier than he had last time she had seen him, was Severus Snape. </span>
