    <p>Hogsmeade.</p><p>Plenty of changes have occurred after the defeat of Voldemort over the years.</p><p>The main hero, Harry Potter was now in his early 20s, training as an Auror.<br/> <br/> Away from this town, at the opposite direction of Hogwarts, there was a cave where a few years ago, it was full of items and monsters researched and used for magical items such as potions and wands.<br/> <br/> These resources had been completely depleted, so at this point, it was nothing but an ordinary cave. No one have any reason to go near it. It was stagnant and gloomy, sunlight not capable of reaching its interior. All left were items left by wizards who have searched the place thoroughly, leaving nothing valuable behind.<br/> <br/> However, it was not silent. Drops of water sometimes dropped from the cave’s roof, the screeches of bats echoing about as they roosted. Bats making noises, water dripping against stone, and enough insects to cause ordinary people with no magical capabilities to shriek and run from the sight. It was that sort of repulsive, filthy, gross, polluted, and stagnated place. In a sense it was rather a peaceful place to rest. Bats flew around, disgusting insects crawled across the ground, and vengeful ghosts sang their despair.<br/> <br/> However...<br/> <br/>At this time of this day, that peace ended.</p><p>A thud.<br/> <br/> With a lower pitched thud than what they would generally make, a bat fell to the ground. On the base of the neck of the bat that had fell, there was a single insect that could not have been any larger than the size of a human thumb.<br/> <br/> A needle with paralytic poison on it appeared from its mouth, and thereupon, the insect ate its paralysed prey. Taking several days to ascend the wall, it had used its body to climb little by little so that the bats would not notice, killing one with paralytic poison.<br/> <br/> It’s effort was worth it.</p><p>This insect extended a thin tentacle from its mouth, preying on the fallen bat.</p><p>The insect’s meal was not that large. Dissolving the skin at the bat’s nape, it ate nothing but a small amount of the soft meat from there. Slowly, it pushes the bat’s body within itself, intending to eat whole.<br/> <br/> There was a sound, as though something was just barely dragging along the cave. It was a tiny sound, at the level of not being audible to humans. However, that sound and vibration caused small insects to scatter. A sound that until that point had not been heard in the cave for so long. It was the sound of this insect digesting on the bat it dissolved.</p><p>This was no ordinary insect.<br/> <br/> Taking a closer look, it was like a mass of mucus that was clad in deep dark red ooze, as though seeing a distortion in the cave’s darkness, a dark blood red slime. The redness was due to the blood it absorbed of its food, regardless of the original blood colour of the prey. It indicates its richness of nutrients of what was previously eaten.<br/> <br/> Decades ago, a slime was not an unusual monster. A monster of the this type could become strong if it had lived for a long time. However, due to wars and the hunting of such monsters aggressively, it was considered almost extinct and now mostly read in textbooks of students learning magic.<br/> <br/> The newly born red slime was inferior to even ordinary domestic animals. It was currently only the size of a child’s fist. It would have just rotted away, unable to catch any prey. It was likely destined to be eaten by the crowd of insects.<br/> <br/> However, this slime was a bit unique. It was quite smart for monsters of its type. Following its instincts, the slime took the bat’s corpse into its own body. Slimes would take their prey into themselves to digest little by little, slowly nourishing itself.<br/> <br/> It was lucky and fortunate. Its efforts were not wasted. With this, the red slime obtained food.<br/> <br/> And so, a major change occurred within itself. The slime that was the size of a child’s fist instantly grew after taking in the bat. This was the characteristic of the red slime. It could turn its digested nourishment into a mass that increased instantly. Now that it had obtained the bat’s nourishment, the tiny slime was unable to be killed by other small insects.<br/> <br/> Since the slime ate the bat, it acquired an interesting ability. A paralytic poison strong enough to catch even bigger animals than itself was added to the slime’s liquid. This was one of its abilities it has. It could mutate, and adapt to the food it takes, retaining knowledge and abilities as it pleases. It understood that its liquid had a paralytic effect.</p><p>Of course, there were bats on the ceiling of the cave that could kill the slime if they work together, or possibly the lizards and wild dogs around the cave. But as previously mentioned, it was quite smart.</p><p>It would not set its sights on big prey, it would first ferret out the tiny insects from the rocks first. It would hunt and ate insects which are off larger numbers. Following its instincts, it voraciously and exhaustively ate and ate. Then, it increased its size each moment.<br/> <br/> Due to this, hunting became easier for the red slime. The bats inside the cave, the lizards, and the insects had all been thoroughly eaten away by the slime. So it decided to venture out to the outside world. Time for a bigger prey like the wild dogs outside this cave.<br/> <br/> Nevertheless, the slime was slightly concerned. This cave was its home and natural habitat. It was a perfect place to live and grow. Where an ordinary cave might be still and calm, this one had become a cave of death filled with the songs of vengeful ghosts. But now, it has turned into a dead cave, devoid of almost any living animals.<br/> <br/> At that moment, the slime had become the size of a goat.<br/> <br/> At this moment, after the defeat of the Dark Lord, everyone believed in their peace and that it would last eternally. They had finally passed the dark times and could enjoy their one and only life.</p><p>That’s how it was supposed to be. All of this was going to change.</p><p>No wizards or witches have yet realised that a monster had been born.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>“Miss Lovegood, you taking that commission?”</p><p>A middle age man, who was distributing those flyers was in charge of anyone who was interested in doing jobs that not ordinary people could do. However, this was quite rather urgent as it affected the whole of Hogsmeade so anybody who have the means could take it. He was talking to a certain girl who was rather overtly interested in this particular job.</p><p>Luna Lovegood came alone on the outskirts of Hogsmeade, hearing various stories of the mysterious disappearance of the people here.</p><p>After graduating from Hogwarts, Luna became a magical naturalist, looking for any strange monsters that was seen in any place in Britain. She enjoyed discovering and classifying these new creatures as she travelled across the country. Thus, she was quite well known for her discoveries. On top of this, she was rather famous too in her involvement with the battle for Hogwarts.</p><p>Over the years that had gone by, residents still remembered her as how she was as the student of Hogwarts. This was true for her behaviour and mannerisms.</p><p>However, the same cannot be said for her appearance.</p><p>One could say she had placed a lot of effort in it.</p><p>Luna was currently wearing a loose nun-like black robe. Her hair was now a long beautiful and seemingly brightly coloured soft golden blonde hair was now straightened to the left of her head, hanging down in a ponytail.</p><p>She was reading a strange article that was being passed around in that area.</p><p>Luna’s protuberant silvery eyes gilded gently left to right, reading the paper she was holding.</p><p>The woman was a head and a half shorter than the old man. Now appearing to have a doll-like child figure and fairly short, thus anything big that she carries seems rather disproportionate to everyone else such as her large suitcase that she was holding. It gave others, especially men, the impression of a fragile female that must carefully handled. Having a childlike figure too made them to see a beautiful yet adorable woman to admire upon.</p><p>The young lady looked up to the old man with a dreamy look.</p><p>“Yes, I will.”</p><p>“But you know, many animals have disappeared. Some people have gone missing too. You fine with going alone?”</p><p>“Oh really? All the more I want to go.”</p><p>The witch did not even appear at the slightest concern of the fact how dangerous this job was. It’s reward was quite good, and the dangers that possibly comes with it was more than enough to make it exciting.</p><p>The job consisted of going to a cave, where there was a report of some strange animal killing humans and not leaving any evidence. The animals in Hogsmeade have some ended up disappearing, and so the people suspected that the 2 were linked. It caused a financial disaster for the people living in this town as they also quite dependent on outsiders to come here to spend money.</p><p>Luna looked over the commission thoroughly, silently getting elated the more she read. She had come across many types of creatures and monsters, and this was just another usual encounter to her. No same discovery was ever the same.</p><p>“Can I take the paper?”</p><p>“Sure, feel free.”</p><p>The  witch took the paper from the man, leaving to find a house where she could stay for the moment. The man looked, as her blonde hair shook as she searched on with her drowsy and dreamy eyes.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Luna was able to find a house to stay after asking the residents. It was solidly constructed house with 2 floors, whose owner had mysteriously gone missing a few weeks ago. Now anyone could use it, so she walked inside, ensuring there were no hidden tracking spells. She still have those dreamy eyes as she search thoroughly the whole house for any occupants.</p><p>“Sounds good. Too bad though, there is no bath,” Luna spoke to herself.</p><p>Luna placed her items on the 2nd floor of the house in a room by the side of the walls. She took out her evening meal from her suitcase and ate at the dining room on the 1st floor.</p><p>As the young lady ate peacefully, her thoughts was thinking of her past adventures. Her battle in Hogwarts when Voldemort was still alive. Her teamwork with her friends. Most importantly, the famous hero that everyone know, Harry Potter.</p><p>A feeling of warmth spread across Luna’s chest as she recalled this particular man. Although she never said it to anyone, he was her first love. He was the one who had acknowledged her as who she is despite her weird obsession with strange things and eccentric behaviour. Ironically, after the Dark Lord died, some male students mysteriously find this trait of hers rather cute. Yet, she had rejected countless men who have confessed to her. Even though she knew it was impossible to get him back, she doubted she could love anyone besides Harry.</p><p>Luna sighed. It was an impossible dream. Why was she still clinging to him?</p><p>After finished eating, she went upstairs without changing her clothes.</p><p>Despite the owner missing for some time, the residents of the town still maintain and clean the house in hopes of his return. So it was not dirty.</p><p>There was a bed and cabinet to store the clothes, as well as two windows on one side. It was quite a small space. This made Luna conclude that the former owner was an elderly, who minimise the things that he needed.</p><p>Luna sat down on her bed, her thoughts from her dinner still lingering quite strongly.</p><p>“Haa…”</p><p>The young lady felt giddy.</p><p>“Harry… Harry…”</p><p>She muttered his name. Just that alone was enough to turn her already warmth chest into a heat.</p><p>Peering through the windows from her bed, there was no one walking nearby. Luna sat for a while without making any sounds. Then she slid her beautifully pale fingers down the top of her robe.</p><p>The robe she wore was not anything expensive. It was of thick cloth and block most light touches. You would not be able to notice someone placing a finger over the robe without pressing them hard.</p><p>The stimulation from her fingers was not transmitted to her undeveloped breast, clothed in the robe and unnecessary garment.</p><p>If there was one thing she was never proud off was this part of hers. As flat as an ironing board, how could Harry ever think of Luna when there were other girls like Ginny and Hermione who were heavily gifted in the breast department? It made her feel like a little young girl.</p><p>Even so, Luna rubbed her fingers over her breast through over and over. Rather than messaging, it was more like she was caressing herself.</p><p>Luna sighed, looking slightly disappointed.</p><p>As for why Luna felt unsatisfied, it was due to her comforting this way many times. She lost track how many times this happened, that she questioned if she would even resort to doing it in a transport with many people on a journey to anywhere when she cannot hold back.</p><p>Since when she start thinking of Harry sexually this way? Is it after their first date at Hogwarts at the party with Horace Slughorn? Or maybe after that? She have no answer to this.</p><p><em> I need to do more, </em>the girl thought lustfully.</p><p>In her early days as a magical naturalist, Luna was not able to understand just what was so good about masturbation. Everyone knew about masturbation as general knowledge. But for Luna, who only had a single father taking care of her most of her life, she got the impression that people were simply defiling themselves. When she first attempted this, she felt more disgust and pain than pleasure.</p><p>Luna was disgusted and rejected it. She rejected the foul act of masturbation, recognising it as a shameful deed. She rarely did it back then, but it got more often as she saw Harry less often. It was difficult to hold back.</p><p>Thus, it was different now.</p><p>Luna moved on and rolled up her black robe, holding in on her mouth. Her pale and rather immature legs were laid bare.</p><p>The door to the room was closed. As Luna was holding the robe, her voice would probably be muffled so no one outside should really hear. She unclipped her bra, which was never needed, and tossed it to the side on the floor, bearing her assets for all to see.</p><p>Luna’s minuscule chest, now without its unneeded undergarment, was exposed to the cold night’s air. Her cheeks and ears dyed red from embarrassment, but all the same the girl could not hold out any longer and, on her side, crooked her body forward.</p><p>Luna forcibly closed her lovable dreamy eyes. What she pictured in the darkness was her love that she held dear. Despite her original intentions of only going so far as to warm her cheeks, the girl’s thin and beautiful pale fingers moved over her important place with practiced movements.</p><p>The right hand went towards the girl’s chest, her left hand on top of her unadorned white panties. It was a crude method of masturbation, just pressing down on both with her fingers. But even so, it was not as though she knew nothing about it.</p><p>Luna’s body was quite thin, so her frantic masturbation was accompanied with pain at first.</p><p>“Nooo....”</p><p>Unlike her own delicate fragile hands, her love’s hands were rough and larger.</p><p>Luna’s right hand stroked her meagre chest up and down. Matching her breast size, her small nipples were excited from the mere thought of the young man, asserting themselves when she began rubbing them. Even though she thought it was shameful, the girl by no means stopped stimulating her erogenous zones.</p><p>The stimulation was light at first. After a while, her small nipples gradually grew large enough that they could just barely be pinched with her fingers. She caressed her nipple, pinching it as well as stroking her private area from above her white underwear.</p><p>“Mmm…mmm...”</p><p>A muffled voice leaked out through the robe held in her mouth.</p><p>The fingers the girl had been using to caress her nipple now began to grip and work it, as it was now stiff. The nipple was flexible and would change into the shape she kneaded and pulled it into, but would immediately return to its original shape, a delicate protruding hill of flesh.</p><p>As for the fingers working her genitals from above her panties, Luna changed her focus towards an area slightly above the rest, towards her zealous clitoris.Though still covered by her panties, her clitoris provided her with an intense stimulation, Luna knew this was her weakest part.</p><p>Moving her fingers while thinking of Harry, a warmth entered Luna’s voice and her waist started to move back and forth slightly. Her fingers were moving faster and faster. Before she realised it, tears of joy began to flow from her tightly closed eyes.</p><p>
  <em> Harry… Harry… More rough please...</em>
</p><p>Afraid to speak it out loud, Luna called for her beloved over and over in her heart. Her black robe caught the drool overflowing from her mouth, darkening the cloth.</p><p>But the young woman simply ignore it, stroking her nipple and softly stimulating her clitoris. To her, it was just simply erotic to see the wetness of her robe.</p><p>Luna’s meagre waist went into a small fit, disarranging her bed sheets. The stimulation was more than enough even through her white panties, the love fluids began to erupt from her vagina.</p><p>One could hear the sounds of ragged breathing and the rustle of clothes. Even the thought of wondering whether any man could be near erupt the girl’s lust further.</p><p>Luna’s blonde hair clung to her brow covered in sweat. Her hair, usually collected side up style, lay spread out across the sheet.</p><p>“Mmm… mmm...”</p><p>
  <em> More, more… </em>
</p><p>Pushing against her erect nipple, Luna kneaded it with her thumb. Only her right nipple was being groped, so the swelling in her left nipple was obviously different. She would not stop even if someone saw her obscene appearance, the girl continued to single-mindlessly torment her right nipple.</p><p>The hand that was working on her clitoris slipped into her panties and despite Luna’s original determination, began to directly caress her clitoris. However, it was still wrapped in its prepuce. Her feet and toes alternated from being curled and being stretched to the max as her waist began to move more intensely.</p><p>More forceful, more intense, Luna violated her nipple, imagining the fingers to be Harry’s.</p><p>Luna was being violated by Harry’s rough, warm hands. It was just in her heated delusions, but the zealous passion blazed ever fiercer in her body.</p><p>
  <em> Good… this is good Harry! </em>
</p><p>Luna’s lips had parted from her robe, unable to endure to pleasure.</p><p>“Haa… rry… Po… ter...”</p><p>That voice was no longer a girl. That was long gone.</p><p>Luna called the name repeatedly with the voice of a mature woman.</p><p>Both long and intense, Luna’s body climaxed. Her waist trembled many, many times. As though it would not last long enough, her fingers did not stop despite tasting the climax.</p><p>Forcibly strumming her clitoris, Luna synced up with her waist’s convulsions. She stuck her hips out towards the ceiling, as though aiming towards the waist of a man who was not there.</p><p>“Haaah!”</p><p>Luna flipped over face-down against the bed in panic, trying to subdue her voice. After not being stimulated, her left nipple rubbing up against the bed sent an electric shock of stimulation into her mind. She almost regret doing that.</p><p>The feeling she must forever treasure… it felt so amazing that she continued using both her right hand and the sheet to stimulate both nipples. Her sensitive nipples rubbing against the sweat-dampened sheet was not painful or itchy. It produced a slightly unsatisfying pleasure. However, Luna felt the stimulation against her burning body to be just right. Her mind muddied from desire, she shook her body back and forth while panting quickly.</p><p>Meanwhile, Luna’s bottom that had been thrust into the air like a dog trembled many times over. She seemed like a ravaging beast, unable to control her body desires and simply following its instincts.</p><p>When Luna stimulate her clitoris and the entrance to her genitals that were now dripping licentious fluids, her wet panties bit into her slim bottom. The elastic from her underwear digging into her hips was obscene, appearing as though she was falling from virtue.</p><p>Not noticing that her panties was there, Luna wholeheartedly applied herself to provoking her nipples and genitals in want of obtaining even greater pleasure.</p><p>“Harry... Harry!”</p><p>Pushing her face against the bed, Luna attempted to muffle her moans so that no one would hear. Her muffled voice was stopped by the door and wall, so it should not carry to anyone else’s ears. Still, if anyone outside was listening, that dreaded thought would never stop her from her current actions. It was just too good to stop now.</p><p>This woman called for the young man she loved dearly countless times. With her voice, with her thoughts, although the person herself would probably never notice it, she hoped that he would see her.</p><p>Luna’s fingers accelerated yet again. Imagining her fingers to be her love, she stuck her waist ever higher into the air. She moved from her clitoris, into her vagina itself, ravaging herself with two fingers.</p><p>Feeling the immature and obscenity of it all, Luna thrust her doll-like fingers into herself over and over. Constantly stimulating the shallow area as though to rub it raw, Luna forced out her sexual pleasure.</p><p>Luna wanted to reach her climax while thinking about the love of her life. Imagining his fingers, she thought about Harry’s voice, imagining he was there, doing this to her…</p><p>“Nnn?! N… hii…  aaah!”</p><p>Together with a particularly loud muffled voice, Luna went into a spasm strong enough to cause her to lose control of her limbs.</p><p>Over and over she release her love fluids, Luna’s waist quivering as though to show off how her wet panties stuck to the lips of her vagina. The sheet was wet by her tears, her robe rolled up as it was did not serve its function as clothing. Her delicate back exposed to the air, her convulsing body glimmered through the obscenity of its sweat.</p><p>After enduring the spasms for some time, Luna’s body was drained of all its strength, her waist dropping feebly down to the bed. She weakly turned over, staring dimly up at the ceiling.</p><p>The robe was rolled up and her panties were dripping with fluids due to her secretions. The two small swollen bulges on her chest rose up and down with her intense breathing. She herself could hear the trailing notes of her previous act in her breaths.</p><p>The woman’s fiercely erect nipples indicated how intense her masturbation was.</p><p>
  <em> I should change my clothes… especially my underwear. Ahh... the sheet is going to leave wet spots... </em>
</p><p>Vaguely thinking about things like that, Luna tried to move her obscene body, still suffering the aftermath of her climax.</p><p>Her sweat felt dirty. Although she herself did not notice it, the smell was sure to be lewd. However, her limbs were numb from her climax and would not listen to the owner.</p><p>Luna had already completely given herself to the warmth for a while now.</p><p>Luna Lovegood, the new woman, her breasts, her darker robes and wet panties still exposed...</p><p>...closed her eyes to sleep.</p>
