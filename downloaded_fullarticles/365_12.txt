          <div class="userstuff"><p>The following story is completely fiction.</p><p>~*X0X0*~</p><p>The night was cold and dark. Many bats flying in the cloudless dark sky up ahead. Lucy shivers and she pulls her red cloak around her shoulders as she walks through the dark woods carrying a basket full of lemon gingerbread cookies.</p><p>Lucy is happy because she is on her way to visit her grandmother. Her grandmother lives in Cillette.</p><p>Cillette is a land not many people know about or have been before. It is completely hidden by surrounding trees. The total population in Cillette is five hundred. Deep in the far reaches of the woods by a creek is where Lucy's grandmother lives.</p><p>She hears a branch snap behind her, and immediately turns around to see what the noise was. Or to see who caused the noise.</p><p>Upon seeing with her own eyes, she is now terrified at what she sees. She steps backwards and loses her footing in the dirt and the dead leaves on the earths surface. She falls backwards on her arse. A black shadow rises before and above her with gleaming red eyes and strong white canine teeth.</p><p>Lucy screams as loud as she can in the dead of the night.</p><p>Suddenly, the shadow that Lucy seen turns into...</p><p>"Greyback! I'm so sick of your stupid pranks!" Lucy rolls her eyes at her ex boyfriend and dusts off of her black long sleeve victorian dress as she pulls the long red cloak tighter around her body to stop from shaking. She is annoyed with him.</p><p>Fenrir steps in front of Lucy, and he pushes a black curl of her hair behind her ear.</p><p>He looks her in her blue eyes. "At least I got to see your pretty face terrified." He smirks, his canine teeth ever prominent. "You not even knowing it was me who scared you."</p><p>"I should have known it was you." Said Lucy as she shakes her head, and with her two small fists on Fenrir's chest, she pushes herself away from him then steps several steps back away from Fenrir. Lucy looks down to the earths surface where she dropped her basket of lemon gingerbread cookies.</p><p>Fenrir was too fast for her. He grabs the box of lemon gingerbread cookies off of the ground, and he rips them open.</p><p>He places two, then eleven in his mouth and he eats them up.</p><p>"These are delicious." Said he, chewing with a mouthful. "Where did you buy these at?"</p><p>Lucy rolls her eyes and picks up her now empty basket.</p><p>"I made them for my grandmother."</p><p>"You can cook?" Said he, crumbs falling out of his mouth.</p><p>"Shut up. I'm done with you." Lucy says angrily and she means it. Her blue eyes brimming with tears.</p><p>She hates Fenrir. In this moment, she hates him even more than before.</p><p>Fenrir ate all of the lemon gingerbread cookies that Lucy made for her grandmother.</p><p>Lucy turns around, away from Fenrir with her empty basket dangling off of her elbow. Her red cloak trailing and dragging on the earth behind her. Fenrir is beside her in an instant and grabs her upper arm. Lucy has to close her eyes and flinch away from the pain his long nails being her. She can feel them tearing through her clothing.</p><p>"Well I ain't done with you, Lucille. Not by a long shot."</p><p>Â </p></div>
