    <p>
  <span>Hermione Granger was not your normal eleven year old.<br/>
</span>
  <span>To others, she seemed older than her years, both her knowledge and her heart went deep. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She was labelled a child genius. She absorbed knowledge like it kept her alive. The genius label was a bane to her however; it made people think she would be cold. It made people think that her preference for books, wit and debates would cause her to find people boring - that she would find a social life boring.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Oh how wrong those people were. For Hermione had a deep heart, she felt for people and issues passionately. She was one of the most caring and loving people you could meet. But no one cared to notice. People could never seem to get past the know-it-all persona that stuck to her like glue.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Well, two people did seem to get past it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione’s parents, Helen and Richard Granger were Hermione’s lifeline. On days where Hermione’s teasing was worse than usual, Richard Granger would be there to make her hot chocolate, with a ridiculous amount of cream on top, and to rewatch one of her favourite movies.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>On other days where Hermione was completely ignored by her peers and even on occasion her teachers, Helen Granger was there to play and teach Hermione new songs on piano, where they would end the nights in laughter.</span>
</p><p><span>So when the day came that Hermione found out that she was more abnormal than originally thought, her parents were there.</span><br/>
They were there to console her and cheer her up when she cried that she really was a freak, that she really did cause those accidents and that all the hate was deserved.<br/>
<span>They were there to listen to her excitement about finally finding a place she would fit in, that maybe</span> <span>she</span><em><span> ‘would be able to make friends’</span></em><span> and </span><em><span>‘how many new subjects to learn about!’</span></em></p><p>Hermione Granger was not your normal eleven year old, but two people made her believe that was okay.</p><p>
  <span>~</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When it was finally the day the Grangers would depart for Diagon Alley - Hermione was all excitement, the previous negative emotions of last week were long gone.</span>
</p><p>Her parents were woken up by her excited squeals as she brought them breakfast in bed, telling them, “No complaining! I made your favourites. Now hurry up!”<br/>
<span>Helen just smiled fondly at Hermione and then at Richard as he chuckled at their daughter.</span></p><p>Richard shared a grin with Hermione and said, “I suppose we must do as our Princess commands.” he turned to Helen, “Eat up, buttercup.”</p><p>Hermione giggled as she lay at the foot of their bed, “I’ve already got all my things ready. I’m going to bring my little address book in case I meet anyone new, Professor McGonagall said they correspond via Owl, so I suppose I won’t need any telephone numbers… Why wouldn’t they just use telephones? I wonder how Owl correspondence works, we definitely need to go to the Owl emporium and find out! That is where McGonagall said we can buy an Owl.”<br/>
<span>Hermione turned on her side and watched her parents eat, “I think I want a cat for my pet though, what do you guys think?”</span></p><p>Her parents shared a small smile, clearly having talked about this earlier, her mum spoke, “I think we should get both, but we will keep the Owl so we can send you letters, darling. McGonagall said you can use the school Owls if you don’t get one didn’t she?”</p><p>Hermione, excitement renewed, jumped up with a massive grin. All but telling them to get ready soon, as she sprinted from the room.</p><p>
  <span>~</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Diagon alley was fantastic, people walked about in all sorts of dress, from bad Halloween costumes and Victorian nobles to just normal jeans and a t-shirt. People were using magic all around her and Hermione just couldn’t wait to learn how to do it all. Diagon Alley filled her heart with hope and wonder...</span>
</p><p>First off they visited Gringotts. Hermione’s mother looked a little put out by the Goblins while her father was intrigued, what other creatures or beings existed that Muggles knew nought? Changing currencies was fairly simple and fast, setting up an account with yearly and monthly payments however, was not.<br/>
<span>Hermione’s father, knowing the look in Helen’s eye, volunteered to stay behind to sort it out. His two girls agreed, leaving Gringotts almost skipping.</span></p><p>First thing on the list was her robes, they won’t be ready for some hours so it seemed logical to get those done first.<br/>
<span>When in Madam Malkin’s, she met a white haired girl who was a year younger than her.<br/>
</span><span>The girl had a faraway look about her when she spoke, “I think deep blue is a wonderful colour, don’t you?”</span></p><p>Hermione was surprised to be addressed by her, “Oh,” she swallowed her nerves, “Yes... Yes! Do you want to be in Ravenclaw then? I’m Hermione by the way, Hermione Granger.”</p><p>The girl smiled at Hermione, looking as if she just saw her for the first time, “That would be nice. My mother was in Ravenclaw. But yellow is nice too.” The girl looked faraway again, Hermione didn’t really know what to make of it.<br/>
<span>Just when Hermione was prepared to just forget her first embarrassing attempt at socialisation, the girl spoke, “I’m Luna Lovegood.” </span></p><p>
  <span>Hermione smiled, </span>
  <em>
    <span>what an odd surname. </span>
  </em>
  <span>Shrugging away the feeling of awkwardness she had let take over her, she began a barrage of questions. It turns out Luna was from a wizarding family, and that her father was the editor and publisher for a wizarding magazine called the Quibbler. Hermione made a mental note to look for it in the book shop later.</span>
</p><p>While Hermione was being fitted, Luna told her all about magical creatures called Nargles who had taken her new turnip bracelet when she was getting fitted for new yellow dress robes. Hermione felt for the girl but sadly she couldn’t stay and help her look for it, but she promised to look in other stores she went into. Luna gave her a dreamy smile and thanked her genuinely.<br/>
<span>Hermione wrote her address and name into her little book and left the shop feeling like she had made her first friend here. It was a pity she wouldn’t be going to Hogwarts for another year, but at least she had a new penpal!</span></p><p> </p><p>Her next stop was to get trunk. When entering the shop, she overheard a regal woman talking to the proprietor about what enchantments to get on a trunk. Amazing! Even their luggage was magical!</p><p>
  <span>Hermione followed the regal woman’s lead when it was her turn to make an order. She got multiple extension charms (while making a mental note to research such things asap), one for a library, a potions storage, a removable pet carrier and then after much debate with herself, she got a second library for fiction books.</span><br/>
<span>In addition to the extensions, she got a featherlight charm (which would need to be renewed every two years), a shrinking charm, and a privacy ward that was password protected. She thought about getting it wand keyed, but what if she needed a friend to get something from it?<br/>
</span>
  <span>She instead decided on a privacy safebox that was wand keyed.</span>
</p><p>Luckily the charms would take a little while to be applied, as she had yet to get her wand. She bid goodbye to the proprietor and moved on to the Magical Menagerie.</p><p>
  <span>-</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Helen was quite excited to see what kind of cat Hermione would get before they left for the Owl emporium. She had quite a good laugh when upon entering the Menagerie, Hermione immediately picked an ugly, fat, ginger cat that looked a little more like a squashed lion than a cat. He had seemed to have been there for a while, just waiting for Hermione to come.</span>
</p><p>It did make Helen question how long these ‘familiars’ would live though and before she could ask, Hermione beat her to it.<br/>
<span>Hermione walked over to the supplies, while looking at the greying witch behind the counter. Feeling brave, her questions tumbled out, “Madam, how long do familiars live? - Oh! And! How old is this beautiful cat? You see - I’m muggleborn and -” The older witch cut her off.</span></p><p>“Familiars live a very long life as they bond with their witch or wizard, and thus they die with their witch or wizard. That fat cat there is already 8 years old, nobody has ever taken an interest in him until you, you know,” the older witch croaked.</p><p>
  <span>Hermione soured a little as </span>
  <em>
    <span>Crookshanks - </span>
  </em>
  <span>his name - was </span>
  <em>
    <span>not</span>
  </em>
  <span> fat, he was just strong and a little big boned! Still, Hermione had manners, so she smiled demurely, “Thank you, Madam.” She turned to Helen, having decided her conversation with the older woman was finished, “Mum what kind of bed should I get him?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The older witch had a different idea and cut in before Helen could respond, “Oh right, </span>
  <em>
    <span>dearie.</span>
  </em>
  <span> He is half Kneazle, which means he is a very intelligent magical creature. If you ask him to choose, he will understand you.”</span>
</p><p>Hermione ignored her slight displeasure and instead beamed at Crookshanks, deciding to try it right away. Crooks obliged.<br/>
<span>It turned out that he liked a medium-sized, plain-brown, fluffy bed and much to Hermione’s amusement, he also seemed very interested in all the treat types. </span></p><p>Helen bought him the bed, a couple of small toys that were on sale and a big box of treats to last Hermione the year. A box which she quickly told Crooks he wasn’t allowed in, causing him to huff. Scratching him in apology, she decided that she couldn’t wait to see Richard’s face when he met the orange ball of fluff.</p><p>
  <span>They quickly visited the Owl Emporium, Hermione opted to buy a tawny brown </span>
  <em>
    <span>Little Owl</span>
  </em>
  <span>, scientific name </span>
  <em>
    <span>Athene noctua</span>
  </em>
  <span>. She favoured the breed of small owls so it wouldn’t be obvious to the neighbours when it was off delivering post.</span><br/>
<span>Hermione chose to name her Tempest, liking the irony.<br/>
</span>
  <span>Upon remembering she knew little about the actual mechanics of Owl post, a very kind wizard who worked there, explained it to her. Hermione thought it was a little slow compared to muggle modern communication but she did find the notion of letter writing an attractive prospect.</span>
</p><p>Hermione now felt that it was time to get her wand, but she wanted her father there for that, feeling like it was a significant family moment. Knowing what her daughter was thinking, Helen reluctantly decided that it was time they made their way back to Gringotts.<br/>
<span>Hermione, impatient for her father went on ahead with Helen staying outside </span><em><span>away from the goblins.</span></em><span> Lucky for Hermione, Richard was almost done, needing just twenty more minutes.</span></p><p>
  <span>With nothing else left to do until they got Hermione’s trunk (Helen decided she </span>
  <em>
    <span>was not</span>
  </em>
  <span> up for carrying a bloody cauldron without that featherlight charm). A stop to Sugarplum’s Magical Sweet Shop was made and Helen decided to treat both Hermione and Richard to some wizarding sweets. She kept a close eye, however, on how much Hermione was buying, goodness knows how much sugar was in this stuff…</span>
</p><p>Hermione instantly took a liking to sugar quills, and unknown to her mother, she also took the sweets shop Owl order details. What her parents don’t know, don’t hurt them after all.</p><p>When Richard finally joined them, he immediately took a liking to liquorice wands, making Hermione grimace.</p><p>
  <span>After eating enough sweets to make Helen nag, they made their way to Ollivanders. Hermione passed Richard her feline friend to hold as she expected she would need her hands free.<br/>
</span>
  <span>Richard, clearly not seeing Crookshanks before, was more than a little shocked. As he surveyed the beast, he let out a shocked but proud laugh, and then firmly told Crookshanks that he was to protect Hermione at Hogwarts. Crooks mewled loudly in response causing Richard to raise an eyebrow.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Dad! He </span>
  <em>
    <span>can</span>
  </em>
  <span> understand you, you know.” Richard immediately stopped surveying the cat and decided just to quietly hold him instead, causing Hermione to giggle.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>-</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Walking into Ollivanders had Hermione filled to the brim with sudden nerves, there was no one at the counter and there were so many boxes. Her parents were a little confused, so Hermione decided to be brave once again and call out for help, “Uh, He-Hello?” She cleared her throat, “Is anybody here?”</span>
</p><p>She heard a few tumbles that made her cringe, some rushed footsteps and in a moment, there was an old wizard in front of her, “Ah ah ah, who do we have here?” He looked at her closely while approaching, “A Nott?” Gesturing to lift her arms, he started to measure, “Which one is your wand arm?” Hermione nodded to her right.</p><p>Not one to miss a detail, Hermione tilted her head, confused, “A knot? What is that for, sir?” He continued to measure different parts of her in deep concentration causing Hermione to furrow her brows. He then straightened with a flourish and walked behind the counter murmuring to himself.<br/>
<span>He looked between the shelves and her a few times and then the old wizard finally seemed to notice her parents behind her, “Ah nothing, child. Now what is your name? I am Mr Ollivander.”</span></p><p>“I’m Hermione Granger, sir, pleased to make your acquaintance,” she was never one to forget her manners.</p><p>“Ah… Any relation to the Dagworth-Grangers? Although I thought they retired to the Americas,” he mused.</p><p>Hermione considered it for a moment, looking at her parents for any recognition, she found none, “I don’t think so, sir. I’m muggleborn.”</p><p>“Ah well, whoever knows, with squibs and such, yes? Now on to your wand,” he brought out 4 boxes that he had been gathering during their conversation, “Try this one first. Nine and a half inches, Holly, Dragon Heartstring.”</p><p>Hermione, a little frustrated he gave her no time at all to question him on whatever a ‘Squib’ was, gripped the wand a little too tightly. This caused all the papers on and behind the counter to fly around harshly, hitting Mr Ollivander in the face. Crookshanks hissed at the commotion, making Hermione drop the wand in shock.</p><p>“No, no, no! Not at all, I say,” he dug another box out from under the disarray of papers, “Try this one! 11 inches, Beech, Phoenix feather.”</p><p>As soon as Hermione had a firm hold on it, her hair became about ten times frizzier, standing up on end. Hermione frowned and put the wand down.</p><p>But it didn’t stop there, the more wands she tried, the more her worry grew. Six wands so far! Six! And absolutely none had fit her. Her eyes started to sting, was this all a mistake?</p><p>Just as she nearly gave in to the tears, Ollivander pulled out the last wand in his pile and gently handed it to her, his voice softening, “10 and 3 quarter inches, Vine wood, Dragon heartstring.”</p><p>She decided this was it. If this wand didn’t fit it must have all been some terrible mistake. Another cruel prank.<br/>
<span>She picked up the wand quickly, ready to get this over and done with. But when she held it, everything fell into place. It felt right. She felt a gust of power surge through and around her,. When it reached a foot above the little witch, it the power fizzled and dissipated into sparks.</span></p><p>A stray tear fell. Oh how good that felt, this was her wand!</p><p>
  <span>“How very curious. Well, I have to say that suits you perfectly. The wand chooses the witch you know!”</span>
</p><p>Hermione beamed, so very happy that she really was a witch. She took his hand and shook it heartily, “Thank you so much, Mr Ollivander!”</p><p>
  <span>“Not at all, not at all. I am glad you are pleased! The wand will be 7 Galleons. Would you like to see a range of wand holsters too?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione left Ollivanders with a genuine smile on her face, she felt along her forearm for </span>
  <em>
    <span>her </span>
  </em>
  <span>wand in her new wand holster, feeling more comfortable with it already.</span>
</p><p>She smiled up at her parents and in an excited rush of breath she said, “Lets go get my trunk now! Oh gosh I can’t wait to wand key my safebox!”</p><p>
  <span>Helen stopped her daughter and pulled her for a hug, whispering softly into her ear, “You will be a wonderful witch, Hermione. Don’t let anything or anyone ever make you doubt that you </span>
  <em>
    <span>are</span>
  </em>
  <span> a witch. We all just saw the proof.”</span>
</p><p>Hermione felt the sting in her eyes again, but this time it was because she was so very thankful she had someone who understood her so well. She squeezed her mum tightly, letting a small ‘thank you’ grace her lips before she sprung up, ready to put her upsetting emotions behind her.</p><p>To do this, she told her dad all about her new trunk that they were going to pick up. Understanding what his daughter needed, Richard played along and questioned this ‘featherlight charm’. Thinking that it actually sounded like something extremely helpful, he tried to bribe Hermione to do it for him on things once she learned how to.<br/>
<span>Hermione giggled at the offer of a bribe, and accepted an advance payment of 20 galleons which she planned to spend on quite a few books outside of her reading list.</span></p><p>
  <span>-</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione walked up to Flourish and Blotts, shrunken trunk in hand for which the password was now </span>
  <em>
    <span>‘Pemberley.’</span>
  </em>
  <span> Her parents followed behind her, content on letting her experience this shop without their assistance.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Crookshanks was in her trunk now, happily snoozing away along with all of his supplies. She also had all of her other school supplies in there. The only things left to get were her textbooks.</span>
</p><p>She looked around Flourish and Blotts in amazement, there were so many sections filled with so many books… So much unknown knowledge lying in wait for her to discover. Books were flying between shelves, quills writing by themselves on parchment, shelves that restocked themselves and a large bronze telescope changing direction every few seconds.<br/>
<span>It would be so easy for Hermione to just get lost in here for a couple of hours, but first things first, she needed to get her school supplies.</span></p><p>
  <span>She pulled out her list and wandered over to the textbook section, everything was relatively easy to find, each Hogwarts year having its own shelf. The only book she was missing was </span>
  <em>
    <span>Hogwarts, A History</span>
  </em>
  <span>, which was added to her list by Professor McGonagall after she had gotten a taste of the little witch’s enthusiasm for learning.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>After dropping off a relatively large pile of textbooks with her parents, she wandered off on her own to find </span>
  <em>
    <span>Hogwarts, A History</span>
  </em>
  <span>. Getting a little side tracked along the way as she made a mental note of any book that caught her interest.</span><br/>
<span>Finally spying the elusive tome, she eagerly ran to it. Immediately, she saw a problem. There was absolutely </span>
  <em>
    <span>no way</span>
  </em>
  <span> she would be be able to carry it all the way through the crowd gathered at the till... Knowing how to do one of those featherlight charms would be immensely useful right now.<br/>
</span>
  <span>Still, not one to refuse a challenge, even if it seemed impossible, she tried lifting it as much as she was able… which really wasn’t much at all.</span>
</p><p>“You don’t have to carry it you know,” came a drawl from behind her, she turned around and her heart stilled.<br/>
<span>She came face to face with another white haired person, this time, a boy. She wondered for a fleeting second if he was related to Luna, but on closer inspection his features were different, as well as his manner.<br/>
</span><span>The boy had sharp features for a young teen, but it fit him - and where Luna looked like she was floating, this boy held himself like he was nobility. </span></p><p>
  <span>For a small moment, she felt inferior to him. He looked like he was a bloody Prince. But she quickly dismissed that notion, even if he </span>
  <em>
    <span>was</span>
  </em>
  <span> a Prince, he was no different from her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Feeling confident, Hermione lifted her head and looked him in the eye. And oh gods did she instantly regret it. He had the most beautiful grey - no, </span>
  <em>
    <span>silver</span>
  </em>
  <span> eyes she had ever seen. They had specks of an ice-like blue and, Christ, they shone with utter confidence and pride. Pride for what? She didn’t know. But she wanted to.</span>
</p><p>She felt such a pull towards him. It was illogical, he had barely spoken a sentence to her! But it didn’t matter, she wanted him to like her.<br/>
<span>Calming herself down and trying to play it cool, she raised an eyebrow and said, “Oh? And do tell how else I will be able to lift and thus purchase it with my inability to do spells yet.”</span></p><p>He smirked, she felt a spark seeing it, “You’re a first year too” His eyes flashed at her nod, “Wicked! Anyway, just tell the boy working at the front what books you want. He’ll levitate them to you. Easy.”</p><p>
  <span>Hermione felt a little stupid, they were wizards, </span>
  <em>
    <span>of course they can do that.</span>
  </em>
  <span> But then her thoughts led her to elation at the consideration of all the books she wouldn’t have to lug around the shop, “Well then, I thank you for that information, Mr…”<br/>
</span>
  <span>Right, they had yet to be introduced.</span>
</p><p>“Malfoy. I’m Draco Malfoy.” Draco. What a fitting name for him.</p><p>
  <span>He spoke again, “Is it your first time going shopping?” Hermione’s eyes widened a fraction, why on earth would it be her first time shopping? “I </span>
  <em>
    <span>had</span>
  </em>
  <span> heard that some families were extra cautious after the war and all. But that was a decade ago… Oh, where are my manners? As you know now, I’m Draco Malfoy, and you are?”</span>
</p><p>Deciding to ignore his ramble for now, Hermione found her voice, “Well - Thank you very much, for the help, Malfoy. I’m -”</p><p>“Draco darling, it’s time to leave. We have to meet Theodore and Miss Parkinson. Come along,” Hermione was interrupted by that regal women from the trunk shop. Looking at her now, she resembled Draco quite a bit, she surmised that it was his mother.<br/>
<span>Draco smirked and bowed his head slightly, Hermione did a mini curtsy and smiled at his now retreating form. Even if she didn’t get a full introduction, she felt good about him and thus wrote his name in her little book. </span></p><p>
  <span>-</span>
</p><p>
  <span>By the time Hermione got home, she was utterly and completely exhausted. She couldn’t wait to start reading all of her books tomorrow. She was disappointed though that her parents only let her get twenty wizarding books, plus an extra five she bought with her own Galleons. They were going to let her buy ten new muggle fiction books to take away with her though, so she acquiesced... Afterall, there was going to be a library in Hogwarts filled with wizarding knowledge, but there wouldn’t be any of her Muggle fiction that she so adored except from what she brought with her.<br/>
</span>
  <span>Plus she wasn’t really looking to get into wizarding fiction, not yet, at least.</span>
</p><p>Crooks made himself home on her bed instead of in his and she was fine with that, more than fine actually, as he kept her feet very warm.</p><p>As she snuggled into her pillow, hugging her stuffed Lion plushie that she had had since she was a baby, she reflected on her day.</p><p>There was so much that she seen and did but...</p><p>Her last thoughts before sleep took her were of a boy with the most beautiful eyes she had ever seen.</p>
