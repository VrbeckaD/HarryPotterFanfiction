    <p>This is going to be almost entirely about my original characters, but several canon characters will make an appearance. (Mostly Harry and Draco, but no Drarry. Sorry, but Draco is happily married and Harry is happily single.)</p><p>Some notes to help you find your bearings in my version of Hogwarts:</p><ul>
<li>The Slytherin common room only appears damp and gross to those not welcome.</li>
<li>The Slytherins have all learned a version of sign language to communicate with the merfolk in the lake.</li>
<li>The Hufflepuffs have a communal blanket and welcome those their housemates invite in</li>
<li>Non-magical people (Muggles and Squibs) can make potions and learn theory and do everything in Hogwarts that doesn’t actually require magic; That doesn’t mean that they’re allowed into Hogwarts.</li>
<li>Ron and Hermione are a political powerhouse couple: Hermione's Minister of Magic &amp; Ron is Head of the DMLE</li>
<li>Ginny and Luna ended up together</li>
<li>Harry adopted three kids and became a Hogwarts professor (DADA): James Sirius Potter, Lily Luna Potter, &amp; Remus Hagrid Potter</li>
<li>Draco and Astoria got married and are IN LOVE with each other, and Scorpius exists, but Astoria's body can't handle having another baby
<ul>
<li>Draco became the Potions professor and head of Slytherin</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Neville became the Herbology professor, and the head of Gryffindor house
<ul>
<li>I know it seems like Harry should be Gryffindor HoH, but I want Neville to be HoH, and besides, It's my fic and if you don't like it, you can leave</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>McGonagall is the Headmistress and likely immortal</li>
<li>other minor, inconsequential headcanons include:
<ul>
<li>Percy Weasley and Oliver Wood got married after some time</li>
<li>Charlie stayed a dragon-wrangler in Romania, but he drops by Hogwarts every once and a while for the CoMC class
<ul>
<li>Charlie is also Aro-Ace</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fred, Sirius, Remus, and Tonks are all still dead. Sorry.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Harry turned Grimmauld place into a home for at risk children, and he lives there during the summer: During the school year, he lives in a cottage at Hogsmeade</li>
<li>Also, Hogwarts needs permission slips for students to play Quidditch now, as well as go to Hogsmeade,
<ul>
<li>because Literal Deathball on Broomsticks is more dangerous than Quaint Wizarding Town With A Candyshop</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul><p>And some more notes on my Original Characters</p><ul>
<li>Jameela Arain--Slytherin muggleborn; Muslim and incredibly ambitious</li>
<li>Marco Arain--Muggle; Jameela's older brother who becomes her legal guardian after their parents are killed in a hate crime</li>
<li>Chance Carter--Slytherpuff Hatstall; Slytherin; Lyric's twin brother; has a pretty heavy backstory. TW for rape, kidnapping, pedophilia, and mind control in his chapters</li>
<li>Lyric Carter--Slytherin; Chance's twin sister; she has a much lighter backstory; she's going to be a wizarding lawyer</li>
<li>Nick Friegman--Slytherdor hatstall; Slytherin; TW for severe (mostly past) child abuse, (past) rape, misgendering, and bullying in his chapters: he's trans and pan, and his family is old money purebloods who are arse-backwards in their ways and treated him like a house-elf</li>
<li>Lily Hooper--8 years old; TW for rape of a child, pedophilia, and child abuse; it's not graphic at all, and you only hear about it second-hand</li>
<li>Pierce Hooper--Slytherpuff hatstall; Hufflepuff; TW for child abuse, suicide attempt (non-explicit and past) &amp; self-harm; he's Lily's older sister, and their dad is really really crappy; on another note, he's really good at piano and art</li>
<li>Angel Hughes--Ravenclaw; TW for mentioned rape; he's hardly there at all, it's just something mentioned in passing in Chance's chapter(s); adopted by lesbian wizards</li>
<li>Dominique Hughes--Slytherin; she's Head girl; she's muggleborn, and she's going to be the best ballet dancer in the wizarding and muggle worlds; she's black, and was adopted by lesbian wizards, but that's not relevant</li>
<li>Sam Hughes--Ravenclaw; they are also muggleborn; and also adopted by the same lesbian couple as Dom (hence the last name)</li>
<li>Jeremy Owens--Hufflepuff; TW for eating disorder not otherwise specified (he's recovering, don't worry); he's super good at art and he's Chance's resident Hufflepuff</li>
<li>Elliot Rhodes--Gryffindor; one of Jeremy's exes; he was a pureblood elitist, but then he dated Jeremy and got to be friends with his friends and is better now</li>
<li>Vera Ward--Hufflepuff; she's Lyric's girlfriend and she likes to bake</li>
</ul>
