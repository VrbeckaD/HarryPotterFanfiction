    <p dir="ltr">Harry is fuming when he first sees Malfoy for the first time in three years. Or more specifically, he is in the middle of a one-sided shouting match with Robards in the Ministry lobby when Malfoy appears in a burst of green flames.</p><p dir="ltr">He really shouldn’t be surprised. Somewhere in the back of his mind, Harry counts back the years and months from the trials and knows this is around the time Malfoy would be let off probation. He’s probably here for paperwork or something, his rational side supplies. And yet...</p><p dir="ltr">His eyes follow Malfoy as he walks quickly and quietly, cloak wrapped tightly around him as he practically hugs the wall. His windblown hair rustles with the movement and his gaze is steady and sure, if not a bit tense. The pause in Harry’s shouting is just enough for Robards to put a steady hand on his shoulder and draw his attention back to their argument.</p><p dir="ltr">“Look,” Robards sighs, “I know you’re a workaholic and your need to distract yourself or whatever, but I stand by what I told you yesterday. Take a break. Go home. I don’t want to see you for a week alright?” Patting him on the same shoulder with his hand, he turns and walks away before Harry can retort.</p><p dir="ltr">Fuming, Harry stands there for a moment. It isn’t like he doesn’t want a break—by the gods, he wants one so badly. But how can he? How can he when memories from the war try to haunt him every day? How can he when the world refuses to reach that peace everyone had promised when Voldemort fell? How can he be at peace if the world isn’t at peace?</p><p dir="ltr">A new wave of irritation hits him all over again, and Harry storms back towards where the floo are located. The surrounding wizards—all on their way to work, Harry seethes—part around him, giving him a wide berth. They can no doubt sense the magic that pulses palpably in the air around him. Trying just the barest amount to reign it all in and smooth his face, he spins away with a sickening whirl.</p><p align="center">* * *</p><p>Robards always gives the aurors a few days off after particularly long cases. To heal and recover their minds, he would state. That never stops Harry from trying to show up to work almost immediately after. Yet having just run into Robards, Harry knows he would be keeping an extra eye out for him that day and would kick him out the moment he sees his face. Might as well just go back and try again tomorrow.</p><p>But now that leaves Harry with the problem of having too much time on his hands. Time to overthink, to relive, to dig himself into the bottomless pit of despair and anger. He needs to be busy, to do something to distract himself.</p><p>Desperate, he wanders the halls of Grimmauld place, searching for books to sort, for furniture to be righted. But of course, Kreacher always fixes everything after Harry’s outbursts. Slowly, he can feel the agitation start to build underneath his skin.</p><p>No. No no no nonono. He will keep it under control. But there are people out there that need help. The world still needs help. And here he is, doing nothing but pacing. But he can’t stop pacing. If only the world would stop spinning for just one goddamn second. Then the neverending stream of problems would stop. There would be peace. And Harry would live within that one second forever. If only all these fucking criminals would—</p><p>Nono what would his therapist say? Breathe? Alright, he can do that. Closing his eyes, Harry takes a few deep breaths, willing his mind to empty. Now, think reasonably. What can he do right now? There’s nothing to do in Grimmauld and he hasn’t blown up a room in anger thankfully. So he has to get outside. But where? Does he need groceries? No, Kreacher had already gotten them yesterday. His friends? Everyone’s at work—oh, that’s right, Luna.</p><p align="center">* * *</p><p>Luna greets him with a dazzling smile when he shows up at her cottage twenty minutes later with a bag of pastries.</p><p>“Oh, hello Harry! Are the nargles bothering you again? Come in and I’ll get you something to help with that.”</p><p>Harry grins and follows her into the kitchen. “No, I’m fine. I just came to see if you had some time to kill.”</p><p>“Well, certainly not. I was in the middle of writing an article about blibbering humdingers. But seeing as you’re my friend, I think I can squeeze in some time.” She sits down at the small table and gazes serenely up at him.</p><p>Shaking his head in amused exasperation, Harry sets the pastries down and looks around the kitchen. He always loves Luna’s place. Her cottage takes residence on the edges of Grasmere, and warded off from muggles, she has taken to growing all sorts of magical plants—inside and outside her house—which in turn attracts a number of magical creatures. Warm sunlight filters through the windows, and feeling more relaxed than he has in awhile, Harry allows himself to lower his guard.</p><p>“I tried to design this place like the Hufflepuff common room you know?”</p><p>Eyebrows lifting, he turns to regard her with questions evident on his face.</p><p>“A friend described it to me once,” she states simply. “Seemed nice with all the plants. We could never have all these plants in the Ravenclaw common room. It was bad for the books.”</p><p>Harry relaxes back into his chair and contents himself to listening to Luna talk and eating his treacle tarts. That was the thing with Luna. She always seems to know how Harry is feeling. And instead of questioning him, she rambles about whatever she wishes, allowing Harry to drift between her words and his thoughts, not settling on any particular thing.</p><p>More and more often, he starts finding himself in Luna’s kitchen when he needs a break from the world. The world that always needs him. Him as an auror and hero. Not him as Harry, just a broken and angry man who desperately wants it all the stop. Who wants to walk into the ministry and give Robards a piece of his—oh wait.</p><p>“Luna.”</p><p>Luna pauses mid-bite into a fruit tart to look at him. “Hm?”</p><p>“I saw Malfoy at the Ministry this morning.”</p><p>“Draco?” Her eyes light up. “Oh! His probation period ended.”</p><p>It’s Harry’s turn to pause. Is she friends with Malfoy? “Are… you friends with him?” he asks tentatively.</p><p>“Yup. He’s quite tame now. Would you like to see him? He lives across town.”</p><p>“...What?”</p><p align="center">* * *</p><p>Harry isn't really too surprised to find out Malfoy is friends with Luna; they are two of a kind he supposes, he could see it. But finding out that Malfoy had told Luna where he lives, and even moved into the same small town… well that was a bit more shocking.</p><p>For a month after the trials, the media had kept vicious tabs on the Malfoys, from reporting the sale of the manor as war reparations to every, mundane activity. Criticisms and speculation of what they must be secretly plotting rang through the magical world. Harry remembers that month as one of the most irritating periods of his life. The moment he went anywhere, talks of the savior and whispers of the Malfoys rang in his ears. The din had only continued to grow, and Harry had been furious and agitated. He wanted to crawl out of his skin and tell the world to just shut up, shut up, <em>shut up</em>.</p><p>And while Harry had spent that time hiding within the confines of Grimmauld place, away from all the noise and chaos, the two remaining Malfoys had simply disappeared. For another while, the roar of public outrage rose to unprecedented heights. Then when weeks turned into months and still nothing new had emerged regarding the Malfoys, the world finally seemed to accept that this was just another thing that just is.</p><p>Harry himself had wondered a great deal about Malfoy’s whereabouts. While some part of Harry still thought of Malfoy as the Hogwarts git, the rest of him had been too tired to care. So why did he care? Harry supposed it was jealousy. He was jealous that Malfoy got to escape the world. That <em>he</em> got to escape from all the responsibilities while Harry was still out here, still required to maintain the appearance of peace. All at the expense of his own.</p><p>Now to find out that all along, Malfoy has been hiding away in some small rural town—probably having fun frolicking among the plants and trees with Luna—Harry can not and will not get over it. And indeed, he is still fuming two days later when a file lands on his desk regarding a sudden attack in the otherwise peaceful Grasmere.</p><p align="center">* * *</p><p>When Harry finally feels his feet hit solid ground, he turns around only to see his auror partner already set on obliviating and warding off muggles from the scene of crime. He had had his doubts at first about the man, but Victor Walker turned out to be a solid-good auror, even if he is younger and inexperienced. He does his work wordlessly and efficiently, and makes up for shortcomings with sharp observation and intuition. He rather gives off Luna-vibes, Harry muses, albeit not as dreamy or… crazy.</p><p>Thanking whatever gods again for giving him such a chill partner—who never riles him up, he might add—Harry snaps himself back to attention and surveys the scene. He senses no lingering magic in the air, meaning no lasting curses or perpetrators; they would have to capture them later. As for the actual damage…</p><p>Harry gives out a low whistle as he stares at what was once a quaint cottage, not unlike Luna’s. Except now, all the windows and doors are shattered and half the roof is gone from presumably an explosion of some sort. He casts a few charms, just to make sure the building wouldn’t be in any danger of collapsing should he enter. Satisfied, he turns back.</p><p>“Walker!” he shouts in the man’s general direction. He then jerks his head towards the building.</p><p>Victor simply gives a thumbs up before going back to obliviating witnesses. Sighing, Harry walks through the gaping doorway, only to be greeted by the sight of what was probably every single object in the house, destroyed. Furniture overturned, scorch marks on the walls and the floors. Noting that this is the only house damaged, Harry is pretty sure there are probably personal grudges involved. How much must one be hated to bring such destruction upon themselves?</p><p>Moving carefully through the wreckage, Harry searches the house for anything out of the ordinary. The objects littering the rooms give hints as to what was there before—a library, the kitchen, a sitting room, bathroom, and, huh, a potions brewery.</p><p>Nonetheless, everything is what one might expect from an attack such as this one, so when Harry walks through the last doorway upstairs where the house now opens to the empty sky, he isn’t expecting the crumpled form of a body on the floor. And suddenly, fuck, because how had he not noticed the victim’s magical signature? There is a person, a human, possibly dying, and he—</p><p>No, focus. Step one, survey the damage. He rushes forward, dropping heavily to his knees besides the person. Now, look for injuries and check for a pulse and—</p><p>He has awfully bright blonde hair, though singed at the edges. His heart pounds. No, it can’t be Malfoy. Though in the back of his head, a voice whispers of things he knew the moment Robards handed him the file. Pushing the hair back, Harry stares at the person’s face, so unmistakably <em>his</em>.</p><p>And he can’t control it anymore. Because the <em>nerve</em>. The <em>nerve</em> of the world to assault Malfoy and leave him burned and bleeding on the floor of his home. His peaceful home in Grasmere with no one but Luna and the land and the sky for company. And how much had Harry wished for such a life? Because if the world couldn’t let Malfoy have his refuge, then how would Harry ever get his?</p><p>And, and this <em>boy</em>—the boy that taunted and teased Harry and stalked Hogwarts like a prince. What did the world know about him? What right did they have to torment this specific person like so? And now he is bleeding all over again, and the lights are reflecting harshly off the bathroom tiles and the blood, oh god, the <em>blood</em>. It is <em>Harry’s</em> fault. It is <em>Harry’s</em> fault he tried that spell, not knowing what it does. It is <em>Harry’s</em> fault Malfoy’s all <em>wrong</em>, lying there, without his stupid, smug grin or that calm gaze and he has to fix it. He <em>has</em> to—</p><p>“ Harry!” A strong shake brings him out of his thoughts. His eyes focus on Victor, who, Harry notices, actually has a real expression on his face. “Have you calmed down? You’re shaking the whole house man.”</p><p>Harry blinks. Shit. He obviously doesn’t want to cause the destruction of the rest of Malfoy’s house, so he breathes and does his best to reign his anger and magic in. If not for himself, he will at least try to control himself for Victor, for Malfoy. For the boy curled up on the ground, hurt and unconscious.</p><p>“Did you—” Harry takes a breath, his voice shaky. “Did you contact St. Mungo’s?” His eyes beg, pleading that Victor did the right thing when he was so out of it. Because it all wouldn’t matter if Malfoy were to die.</p><p>“Yeah. They should be here in a sec.”</p><p>Harry nods. Slumping down next to Malfoy to wait it out, he lets his emotions simmer, feeling the pent up anger turn into a sad, sad resignation.</p><p>When the healers arrive, Harry decidedly sits still, not trusting himself to do anything rash. He lets Victor take the lead, telling the healers what they’ve found and watching as they bundle Malfoy up and apparate away. And Harry can’t help but think that if they make it through this, perhaps he’ll take up Luna’s offer—“Start over, Harry. You can start over. And this time, you’ll find the ground solid beneath you.”</p>
