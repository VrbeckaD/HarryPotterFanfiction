-I Am Sound, by The Dandy Warhols</p><p> </p><p>It was late on a Friday evening in the Gryffindor common room. The fireplaces crackled merrily, and an early snow blew in dreamy drifts against the windows. It was also late in the evening on the birthday of one Sirius Black, which meant every Gryffindor old enough to appreciate the Marauder definition of a party was present, with a few Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws for variety’s sake. Suspiciously strong bottles of Butterbeer were present in many hands, despite Lily’s efforts to restrict their distribution to the of-age students. Right now, everyone was arranged in a lopsided circle on the floor, focused on one bottle in particular: an empty one that lay in the center.</p><p>“You spin it,” Sirius explained. “Then you have to kiss the person it’s pointing to when it stops.” He was draped casually over the seat of the couch behind him, which had been pushed out of the way along with the rest of the common room furniture.</p><p>Lily rolled her eyes. “You know, Muggles play this game too. Ten-year-old Muggles.”</p><p>“This’ll be better,” James said, with the conviction of a Marauder faced with the prospect of a game likely to cause people to laugh hard enough to snort spiked Butterbeer up their noses.</p><p>“Right, but we're playing clean rules,” Lily said.</p><p>“What's clean rules?” Sirius asked suspiciously.</p><p>“Both the kisser and the kissee have to agree to do it, or they only get a kiss on the cheek.”</p><p>A chorus of protests went up from around the circle. Sirius abandoned his pose of calculated relaxation and hollered over the others, “That's not on! You'll suck all the fun out—”</p><p>“<em>Think</em> about it, Black. You don't really want <em>anybody</em> to be able to kiss <em>anybody</em>.” Lily's hands were on her hips, and her wand was already out, a habit—one might say survival skill—acquired around the same time she had started to tolerate close contact with the Marauders. This contact had become a bit too close for comfort in Sirius' opinion, as evidenced by James' next words.</p><p>“She's right.” James drew himself upright into his best Head Boy position of authority, assuming that authority was one that had just recognized the possibility of certain recently acquired girlfriends kissing people that weren't himself. “Consent and all that. Can't have people getting traumatized.”</p><p>“It's <em>my</em> birthday—” Sirius started to say, as watching James freak out while other people kissed Lily was actually the <em>entire point</em> of this game, but Remus—logical, reasonable Remus—interrupted him.</p><p>“Raise your hand if you're in favor of clean rules.”</p><p>The students looked at each other warily, evaluating. Lily's hand went up immediately, as did James' and Remus'—those <em>traitors</em>—and slowly other people joined them until there was a clear majority. Notable exceptions were Peter and a few of the other less attractive students. Peter probably thought no one would agree to kiss him otherwise. Privately, Sirius wondered about that, seeing as he had caught at least a few girls staring after Peter with wistful expressions, him being the most attainable member of their illustrious group, but the boy seemed oddly determined to live his entire life with self-esteem the size of the rat he often turned into.</p><p>Sirius groaned at the show of hands and dropped his head onto the seat of the couch behind him in defeat. Clearly, he should have invested more energy into getting Remus drunk.</p><p>“There you have it, Pads,” Remus said with his usual mild manner. “You can either play clean rules with everyone or play the other way with just the people who kept their hands down.”</p><p>“Clean rules it is then,” Sirius sighed, as the second option would leave him making out with the three ugliest girls in the room and also Peter. People who wanted to kiss Peter might exist, but Sirius was definitely not one of them. “You can do anything from a kiss on the cheek to a full-on, twenty-minute, clothes-gone-astray mack on each other, but you only get thirty seconds to negotiate, and absolutely no interference from third parties.”</p><p>He punctuated this with a significant look at James, who scowled back at him. Sirius just grinned. All hope was not lost. Lily was a good sport, and she was probably just as interested in watching James wibble uncomfortably with jealousy as Sirius was.</p><p>Clean rules turned out to be more fun than he had imagined. Watching people try to convince each other to make out with them in thirty seconds was frankly hilarious. Plus, there was a lot of public kissing going on and there was no getting around the fact that it was enjoyable to watch, especially when Sasha Patil happened to spin the bottle at his girlfriend and snogged her in an extremely showy fashion for a good five minutes until the people next to them laughed and pulled them apart.</p><p>“Be gentle with me,” Sirius whispered with lusty innocence when someone finally spun him. It was just little Maggie Alexander from Ravenclaw. In the face of his bedroom eyes—which he and James made a habit of practicing competitively in the bathroom mirror every morning—she stammered so hard that he had no idea what she was saying. In the end, he took pity on her and gave her a simple kiss on the lips. She was only a fifth year and obviously not ready for the gloriousness of a true patented Sirius Black smooch.</p><p>Preema Batra clearly was, however, and it took a lot less than thirty seconds to convince her to let him kiss her properly. She was unexpectedly assertive, and he found himself stumbling a little on the way back to his seat, making a mental note to take her aside after all this for a follow-up.</p><p>Preema spun Remus, who accepted a kiss but pulled back after just a few seconds, laughing and straightening his glasses. Sirius shook his head fondly at this. Always the proper Prefect, that one, even when he wasn't actually a Prefect anymore.</p><p>Remus spun the bottle, and everyone <em>oohed</em> when it came to rest pointing directly back at Sirius. This would be the first same-gender kiss, and seeing as it would take place between two Marauders, the students seemed to have high expectations.</p><p>Remus crawled around James until he and Sirius were nose to nose. Sirius smiled, reminded of Padfoot and Moony smelling each other in greeting. Remus always smelled good, and today was no exception.</p><p>Remus didn't make any use of his allotted thirty seconds unless you counted the time he spent looking Sirius over with a sneaky half-smile. Sirius didn't say anything either. Obviously, he was game for anything, seeing as the game itself had been his idea to begin with. Still, he was fully expecting a quick peck on the cheek, due to the whole proper Prefect thing, so he was surprised when he felt the press of Remus' lips against his own.</p><p>It wasn't a terribly exciting kiss as far as kisses went, or at least it shouldn't have been. There was no movement, no wetness, no press of bodies, none of the things that made kissing fun. But it went on just a bit longer than a chaste kiss should have, and Sirius' lips were still tingling from—who had it been? Suddenly he couldn't remember her name, or even her face—and as Remus finally pulled away, their lips dragged roughly together, just for a split second. That brief friction was enough to strike a tiny match right in the dark, hollow cave of Sirius' chest, bringing a flare of light where none had ever been before.</p><p>Remus went back to his seat, and Sirius fanned himself like a blushing maiden for the appreciative crowd. But underneath, he was cupping his hands around the tiny light near his heart, already protective of it—which made sense considering it had come from Remus, and protecting Remus had become a core part of his identity years ago—but, still, <em>what the fuck was that?</em></p><p>Well, he wasn't a Marauder and a Gryffindor and an outcast Black—in that order—for nothing. It was his turn again, so once he had the bottle spinning, he snuck his hand into his pocket and nudged it with his wand, just a little, (which was a good idea regardless, because it had been about to stop on James, and that was <em>so</em> not on) until the neck of the bottle was pointing right back at Remus. The students broke into incredulous laughter at this turnabout, and there was much nudging of elbows into sides.</p><p>“Outta my way, James,” Sirius drawled. He climbed across James' lap, making sure to poke him with his knees on the way as much as possible, just on principle. James hollered and shoved him, so he ended up tumbling down in front of Remus, flushed and excited. He pulled himself upright on the floor, tossing his head to regain some dignity. Remus was leaning back on his hands, eyebrows raised and drawn together in amusement and enough confusion to make Sirius suspect his trick with his wand had not gone unnoticed. Sirius ignored this and leaned forward to whisper in his ear. “So, more of the same, or shall we give them a proper show?”</p><p>Remus rolled his eyes and smiled. “Oh, go on then.”</p><p>Sirius beamed, and then they were kissing, <em>really</em> kissing this time. Everything that had been missing from the first kiss was suddenly there, right against him, and then underneath him as he pushed Remus backwards onto the floor. Or perhaps Remus had pulled him down. It was hard to be sure when they were working together like this. Remus' lips were silky and determined, and his tongue was in Sirius' mouth. Sirius gave as good as he got, but it wasn't easy. Remus obviously knew what he was doing, which meant Sirius would have to thump him later, because Remus had let all the Marauders believe he was as innocent as can be, but there was no way the boy underneath him right now was a virgin. No way. There was nothing virginal or proper or Prefect-y in the teeth currently scraping over his lips or the hands twisting deep into his hair, or the knee that was—oh gods, was it really sliding up the inside of his thigh? It <em>was. </em>There was something secret and hungry here that Sirius had never known to look for. It was turning him on more than anything, so much so that he completely forgot that he was (very thoroughly) into <em>girls</em> and didn't have a bent bone in his body.</p><p>All the while, the tiny match in his chest was flaring up huge and bright, casting light into that dark, fucked-up place inside him that never really went away. Sirius had always known, on some level, that all the pranking and showing off and overconfidence was just a desperate cover for this pit full of dread that lived inside him, but now there was a torch burning there, lighting up the walls, showing him cave formations and ancient paintings and <em>beautiful</em> things that he had never known existed, almost as if, when he was kissing Remus, he wasn't such a miserable excuse for a human being after all.</p><p>He was just thinking that now was exactly the right time to slip a hand under Remus' shirt when some hidden and very unwelcome switch flipped in his brain. Suddenly he could hear the catcalls and laughter of the other students, who had apparently been enjoying the show. He wrenched himself away from Remus' mouth and hands and—and everything else and sprang all the way up to standing. His eyes were the last to leave, because Remus was rumpled and pink and dark-eyed and wet around the mouth and his tie was undone—how had that even <em>happened?</em> Sirius remembered loosening it, but he didn't understand why Remus had <em>let</em> him. Since when did Remus let anyone loosen his clothes?</p><p>He had less than a second to take this in, because people were clapping and hollering and laughing. He shook his head, trying to clear it, then whirled around to face his audience. Ah, applause, the song of his people. He bowed dramatically, surreptitiously wiping his moist chin with the back of his hand on the way down.</p><p>“Don't worry ladies, there's plenty more where that came from.” He generously gestured to Remus as well as himself, since he now knew that if Remus wasn't getting any—although he <em>had</em> to be—that was a crime against humanity. Something had to be done about it.</p><p>He sauntered around James and sat down, adjusting his robes over his groin ostentatiously. If it had to be done (and it did, it really did) then it might as well be done with style. A couple of the younger girls in the circle giggled so hard they fell over, and he felt very satisfied with himself.</p><p>Remus sat up and ran his hand through his hair, but he didn't look nearly as flustered as Sirius would have expected. Sirius narrowed his eyes. That boy had a lot of explaining to do. Starting with, <em>what the fuck was that</em>, because Sirius was no clearer on that point than he had been before the second spin of the bottle, and the light inside his chest was showing no signs of fizzling out.</p><p>To Sirius' delight, Remus spun Lily. She lowered her gaze in challenge, ignoring the strangled noises of protest from James.</p><p>“Do your worst,” she said, but Remus just laughed and kissed her on the cheek. That was wise, Sirius supposed. Remus did have a strong predilection for staying alive.</p><p>Davey Gudgeon, however, was not so cautious, and Lily snogged him with more showy tongue than Sirius could have wished for in his wildest dreams. He laughed himself blue in the face while working with Remus to hold down a wildly thrashing James, and Sirius congratulated himself on the best self-given birthday present ever.</p><p align="center">+++</p><p>After the party had wound down, Remus stepped in and saved Gudgeon's life by pointing out to James that there were worse things than Lily getting all hot and bothered, considering <em>James</em> was the one about to take her up to the dorms for some real fun. James brightened considerably at this, especially when Lily was the one to pull him upstairs. Remus followed them, pointedly monologuing tips about how to cast proper privacy charms. Sirius eventually made his way up as well, after leaving out a few bribes for the house elves to keep them from telling McGonagall about the mess (they wouldn't accept money, of course, but he had found a lot of success with hastily scrawled knock-knock jokes). He lay in bed for almost an hour before giving up and creeping over to Remus' closed bed curtains.</p><p>“Hey, Moony, you awake?” he whispered.</p><p>There was a long pause before Remus answered in the affirmative, and when Sirius pulled open the curtains, Remus had a suspicious, flushed look about him. That, along with certain other very interesting olfactory clues made Sirius suspect Remus had not only been awake, but wanking under the cover of his own privacy charm. Also, the book Remus was supposedly reading was upside down.</p><p>Normally, Sirius would have made a point of teasing him about this, as ribbing Remus was one of his many responsibilities as a Marauder, but inflicting embarrassment was contrary to his current goal. So he pretended not to notice and flopped down on the bed, purposely taking up more space than necessary. “So, fun party, huh?”</p><p>“Sure, Padfoot. Happy birthday.”</p><p>“Thanks.” Sirius grinned and blew his over-long bangs out of his eyes. Remus glanced at his book, seemed to notice it was upside down, and nonchalantly slid it down onto the bed between them.</p><p>“What's going on?” Remus asked. “Can't sleep?”</p><p>“Yeah. I was just thinking, you know.”</p><p>Remus raised his eyebrows. “I hope you didn't strain yourself.”</p><p>“Aww, Moony, you're so sweet to me. Speaking of which...some kiss.”</p><p>“Which one? There was a lot of kissing going on.”</p><p>Sirius poked his side. “<em>You</em> know which one. But maybe you don't know...I've never kissed a bloke before.”</p><p>Remus rolled his eyes. “Actually, I do know that. If you had, you would have told me about it in sordid detail, like you and James tell me about all of your liaisons.”</p><p>Sirius grinned. “We've got to educate you and Peter somehow. Anyways, so I was thinking.” He sat up a bit so they were eye to eye—or, more relevantly, mouth to mouth. “Wanna do it again?”</p><p>Remus' expression—always difficult to read—didn't change, and Sirius wondered if he had imagined the brief flicker of…<em>something</em> in his eyes. “What, one kiss and now you're a total poofter?”</p><p>Sirius shrugged. He leaned back a bit, stretching casually. “Doesn't have to be a poofter thing. It's just a snog. It doesn't mean anything, really. And we're friends, right?”</p><p>“I would think that's an argument against, rather than for, continued snogging.”</p><p>“Well, if you don't want to, no big deal.” He paused as a sudden slash of life-sucking fear told him it would <em>absolutely</em> be a big deal if Remus said no. Shit. “I just thought it might be interesting.”</p><p>Remus sighed and sat up, edging away as far as he could on the small bed. Sirius' insides twisted with dread. “If you think it's interesting, then you probably should try it. But not with me. I don't want to be the test subject in your shirtlifting experiments, thanks.”</p><p>“Oh come on, Moony,” he protested. “You can't pretend you aren't even the least bit curious about guys after—after <em>that!</em>”</p><p>Remus laughed, but in a way that wasn't very nice, not to Sirius or to himself. “I <em>was</em> curious, about four years ago. I've had plenty of time to gather data about who I am and am not attracted to. There are no questions remaining in my mind which could be answered by snogging you, trust me.” Suddenly he folded in on himself, curling up with his arms around his legs. “Look, just...go away, all right?”</p><p>There was a long moment of silence while Sirius struggled to interpret Remus' downcast eyes and the way his hands clutched the legs of his pajama bottoms, white-knuckled. Slowly, pieces were fitting into place.</p><p>“Holy fuck, Remus, are you <em>gay?</em>” Remus didn't say anything, but he turned his face down into his knees. The answer was very clear. Sirius groaned. “Oh, this is so fucked up.”</p><p>“Thanks so much.” Remus sounded calm, but his impassive mask was crumbling as he made to leave the bed.</p><p>“That's not what I meant!” Sirius scrambled forward and pulled him back down. Remus landed in his lap, and Sirius wrapped his arms around him tightly. “Don't go away! You're fine. I mean me—I am drastically fucking this up, okay?” Remus stopped struggling, and Sirius took a deep breath, inhaling the scent of Butterbeer and Remus' shampoo. “Look, I never would have said all of that stupid shit about just kissing and it not being a poof thing if I’d known. I would much rather actually date you. Like, going out together, holding hands, cuddling or whatever...” He swallowed nervously. “Fucking too—if, if you're into that. The whole deal. In secret, if you want. Or, you know...not in secret.”</p><p>Remus sighed. He drooped for a moment, then said, very quietly. “No, Sirius.”</p><p>“But...why not?” Remus looked away and shifted his shoulders in a way Sirius guessed meant he wasn’t going to answer. Sirius felt a sudden rush of anger. Remus had liked guys for <em>years</em>, and he hadn't said anything. They were the Marauders. They were supposed to tell each other things. They were supposed to be a team. “Remus,” he growled. “You can't expect me to believe you're not interested after practically chewing my lips off in front of a crowd of people!”</p><p>Suddenly, Remus lashed out, flinging Sirius' arms off of him and shoving hard enough to push himself out of Sirius' lap. Sirius nearly shoved back, but he managed to stop himself. Wrestling with James was one thing. That was fun, healthy, and a great way to solve minor interpersonal dilemmas. But it had never been like that with Remus, for reasons Sirius was only now beginning to understand.</p><p>“Being <em>interested</em> is not the problem,” Remus hissed, and from the way his face was twisted up in a rare display of intense emotion, it was clear that he would have preferred to yell, except he didn't want to disturb the others sleeping in the room. Trust Remus to think about that.</p><p>“Then what is!” Sirius said, with far less regard for his own volume.</p><p>“I don't trust you!” Remus shouted.</p><p>And just like that, the little match burning in Sirius' chest went dark, blown out by his own stupid, selfish self, and once it was gone, there was nothing left but the foul vacuum of self-hatred.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>It had been nearly a year since Sirius had told Snape how to get past the Whomping Willow. Since he had sneeringly used Remus' worst nightmares just to pull a vindictive prank. Since he had almost gotten Remus killed. Since he had lost the right to count any of them as his friends.</p><p>Somehow, one by one, they had forgiven him. It should have been proof of how much they truly cared about him, but the dark pit inside him whispered that it was all a lie. He was just too good at fooling them into thinking it had been anything other than a show of his true colors—Black, like the Black hole in his chest, that would keep sucking at everything they were willing to give until there was nothing left and he had destroyed them all.</p><p>“Right,” he whispered. “That's—reasonable. I'll just...” He swallowed, trying to force down the toxic sludge threatening to strangle him. He had to say something else, or this would be it, and their friendship would be over forever. Again. “I'm sorry. Just, pretend I never brought it up? I promise I won't be weird about it.” He closed his eyes, not liking the impassive mask that had returned to Remus' face once the anger had drained away. “Please. I don't want things to be weird.”</p><p>Remus was quiet for a long time, and Sirius died inside over and over again while he waited for him to respond.</p><p>“All right, Pads. I'm sorry too. I do—” His breath huffed out suddenly. “I do want us to be friends still.”</p><p>The rush of relief Sirius felt was far too thin and fragile to truly silence the monstrous shame eating away at his heart like acidic tar, but he nodded. “All right. Thanks.”</p><p>He eased himself off Remus' bed, although every muscle in his body wanted nothing more than to cramp up and leave him frozen until insects started to crawl through his decomposing flesh. If Remus said he would act normal about this, then he would. Remus always did what he said he would. Unlike Sirius. He was not so trustworthy.</p><p>He was also not so resilient. He knew from experience that this creeping, poisonous feeling inside him wouldn't go away unless he did something about it. He couldn't leave himself alone with it. It would make him stupid. It would make him mean.</p><p>He paused right before shutting the curtains. “Remus?”</p><p>“Yeah?”</p><p>“Was all that—what level secret would you say that was? Just...I was thinking maybe I would talk to James.”</p><p>Remus sighed. “Level One, Padfoot. Sorry.”</p><p>“That's all right,” he said, although it really wasn't. Level One meant it would be just between the two of them. The only Level One secret he had anymore was with James, about how he had cried like a baby for hours after his parents had disowned him. Most secrets, like Remus' lycanthropy and the Animagus transformations, were Level Two and shared between the four of them. Level One left him alone with this, and if there was one thing Sirius was terrible at, it was being alone.</p><p align="center">+++</p><p>The roof of Gryffindor tower was steeply slanted and risky to climb to, even after he had melted the ice with his wand and set up a warming bubble, but if it had been a safe, cozy refuge, then he wouldn't have had a habit of going up there.</p><p>“Hi, Padfoot.” Remus stuck his head over the edge of the roof.</p><p>“Oh. Hi, Moony.” Sirius sighed and threw the crumbling remains of his joint over the edge. Remus hated the smell of pot and how it would cling to him for hours after he smoked, but he had run out of other ideas. At least it had calmed him down. “What's up.”</p><p>“You are, at four-thirty in the morning.” Remus clambered up onto the roof and joined Sirius on the small ledge they had transfigured level enough to sit on in third year. Their shoulders were touching, but it wasn't weird. It was just nice, just like usual.</p><p>“Sorry. Tried to be quiet, but you know how this roof is.”</p><p>“I do. I heard you and thought I'd come up. If you want someone to talk to, you can talk to me.”</p><p>“Oh.” Sirius sighed. Remus was so nice. Too nice. “Yeah, sure.” They sat there for a while, watching the snowflakes drift down and melt on the edge of the invisible bubble Sirius had cast. “I guess I'm wondering how come you never said anything. Did you think we'd freak out or something?”</p><p>Remus scrunched up his nose. “That did occur to me, yes. But mostly I just didn't want the whole school to know. I didn't trust James not to make jokes about it until it got obvious. You know how he is with the deer jokes. The only reason people haven't figured out he's an Animagus is that's it's such complicated magic that it wouldn't occur to them. And you're not much better with the dog jokes, but at least that's less weird than deer.”</p><p>Sirius snorted. “Yeah, yesterday I heard a couple Slytherins whispering that he's got a freaky deer fetish. Sneaks out into the forest to frolic with them or fuck them or something. I turned their hands into fish, of course.”</p><p>Remus rubbed his fingers over his forehead. “Of course you did.”</p><p>“Still, even James would never say if you didn't want him to. We don't make wolf jokes.” He pulled out another rolling paper just to have something to fiddle with. “I wouldn't have either. And I won't. Even though I think it's dumb and you should just tell the others.”</p><p>“Thanks, Padfoot.”</p><p>“I'm not going to let you down again.” He folded the paper up over and over into progressively tinier triangles. “Not ever.”</p><p>He wouldn't either. The Black pit was still there. It would always be there, sucking at anything good that might come near, but he wouldn't let it have Remus. He wouldn't let it have any of them, not even Peter. Not even Lily. He would kill himself first.</p><p>“Thanks, Pads.”</p><p>“'Course.” He unfolded the paper and began tearing it along the fold lines. “So...how did you know? Cause I like girls, really, I do. But I also liked...that.”</p><p>“It's not mutually exclusive, you know.”</p><p>“Really? Huh. But you're not into girls, are you?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“So how did you know?”</p><p>“That <em>is</em> how I knew.” Remus frowned and pushed his glasses up his nose. “Look, it's not that complicated. When did you start feeling attracted to girls? Really, I mean, not just talking about it to show off to James.”</p><p>Upon hearing that last part, Sirius internally added a good six months to his initial answer. Damn, Remus knew him so well. “I was thirteen, I think. Nearly fourteen.”</p><p>“And when did you first start feeling attracted to guys?”</p><p>“Uh. Four hours ago?”</p><p>Remus sighed oddly and poked at the bubble above them, which was starting to form icicles. “Then it was probably just a fluke. You're straight, so you can stop freaking out.”</p><p>“Huh.” Sirius was a bit doubtful about that, but it was the easy answer. It was the one that would make everything go back to the way it had been. Maybe it was the one Remus needed to hear.</p><p>“All right, have we headed off your gay panic for the time being?” Remus shivered. “Because your charm is starting to wear off.”</p><p>“I guess so.” He sighed and dusted the tiny paper triangles off his lap to join the snow on the lower part of the roof.</p><p>“Great. Let's go inside.”</p><p>As they climbed back through the window, Remus glanced behind him at the sky. It was cloudy, but Sirius knew what he was looking at. “Three days until the full moon.”</p><p>“Yeah. Monday.” Remus shivered again, but probably not from cold this time, and shut the window.</p><p>“I've got detention with Flitwick, 'cause of the whole fish-hands thing. But I'll be there.” Sirius paused. The high was ebbing a bit, and he could hear the voice of the pit again. “Unless...you don't want me to be there.”</p><p>“Don't be stupid.” Remus climbed into bed and added, very quietly, just before he shut the curtain, “I'll always want you.”</p><p>Sirius sighed at the closed curtain and wandered off to the kitchens to wheedle some food out of the house elves. On the surface of his brain, he was pondering the difference between a midnight snack and an obscenely early breakfast, but somewhere underneath he was picking up the tiny pieces of the extinguished match and blowing on them, oh-so-gently, until they became a palmful of embers, dim and struggling, but still warm.</p><p align="center">+++</p><p>“Oh, finally, would you hurry up!” James called as Sirius stumbled blearily into the dining hall way too early the next morning. “Remus wants to tell us something, but he won't until you get your lazy arse over here.”</p><p>Sirius sat down with a thump on the end of the bench next to Lily, trying to figure out why James' words made him nervous and where the serving platter for the bacon was.</p><p>“Thank you all for gathering here so early this morning,” Remus began, with great formality.</p><p>“It's lunchtime,” Lily said. “The end of lunch.”</p><p>Sirius pulled a face. That explained the lack of bacon. “Spoken like a woman who didn't have nearly enough special-recipe Butterbeer last night.”</p><p>“Yes!” She spoke right into his ear with purposeful loudness. “It's lovely to wake up without a hangover. You should try it sometime!”</p><p>Sirius glowered at her and edged away on the bench. Shoving girls should be allowed, it really should.</p><p>“Here.” James pushed his glass of pumpkin juice across the table. “Spiked it with Pepper-Up.”</p><p>“My hero!” Sirius grabbed the glass and gulped from it greedily.</p><p>Remus cleared his throat. “As I was saying...” He waited until Sirius had finished guzzling James' juice and all eyes were on him. “I'm gay. And I'm fucking Kingsley.”</p><p>He ducked just in time to dodge the spray of juice that came shooting out of Sirius' mouth. Peter was not so lucky, but he never was.</p><p>“You're—<em>what</em>? Kingsley?” Sirius burbled, horrified.</p><p>“You're <em>gay</em>? Since when?” James said.</p><p>“Honestly, James, if you haven't figured that out by now, especially after last night, then you really aren't paying attention,” Lily said, fastidiously wiping a few drops of pumpkin juice off the sleeve of her robes.</p><p>“Kingsley? Kingsley Shacklebolt? <em>That</em> Kingsley?” Sirius spluttered.</p><p>“Yes, that Kingsley,” Sirius said</p><p>“Kingsley Shacklebolt with the face like a manticore having a bad day?”</p><p>“What? What are you talking about?”</p><p>“Vicious!” Sirius squeaked.</p><p>“Oh, wait a second, he was <em>there</em> last night!” James said, catching on. “He was right there while you snogged Remus into the carpet. Oh, you're fucked. You're a goner.”</p><p>“He's going to kill you,” Peter whispered, clearly impressed.</p><p>“Fucked. Dead, murdered, gone. I'm killed. I'm going to die.” Sirius slithered bonelessly down under the table. Unfortunately, this hiding place was inadequate. The Pepper-Up smoke trailing from his ears was giving him away. He needed to find a better spot immediately—perhaps the center of the earth. He snaked his arm up and snatched a spoon from the table. It was time to start digging.</p><p>“He's not vicious or a manticore! He's my boyfriend!” Remus said, ducking his head under the table to glare at him. “And I’m pretty sure he doesn’t care.”</p><p>“He's going to murderkill me until I'm all the way flat and dead,” Sirius moaned. “Is he here?” He peeked his head up just enough to look down the long table, using an upraised napkin as cover.</p><p>“Nah, he's not here yet. You have a few more minutes to enjoy being alive,” James said, patting his head reassuringly. Sirius ducked back under the table, determined to make those minutes last as long as possible.</p><p>“Do you think he'll be satisfied with killing just Sirius?” Peter asked. “Or will he come after the rest of us?”</p><p>“So much for loyalty!” Sirius said, jabbing Peter's knee with the spoon.</p><p>“Honestly! Is this because he's black?” Remus scowled down at Sirius. “That's racist, you know!”</p><p>“That has nothing to do with it! Besides, doesn't knowing Prongs disprove that theory?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Don’t use James as your token brown friend!” Remus chided.</p><p>“I'm not tokenizing!” Sirius protested. “James, do you feel tokenized?”</p><p>“By you, the whitest arse to ever sit on a Hogwarts bench? Regularly.”</p><p>Somewhere above, someone laughed and knocked their silverware against a plate. Sirius jumped, hitting his head on the table. “Back to the problem at hand, at throat, my throat! He's over six feet tall! His arms are thicker around than—than—” He looked around for inspiration. “Lily's thighs!”</p><p>“Black! You piss-sodden toadstool!” Lily shouted.</p><p>“He's not even our age! He started school late because he was too violent to—ow!—be let out of the house!” Sirius shrieked, skillfully dodging at least half of the kicks now coming from James and Lily's side of the table.</p><p>“That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard!” Remus said. “Kingsley is perfectly nice—”</p><p>“No, Padfoot’s right,” James said, once Sirius had immobilized his legs with a curse. “Dude's mean. Have you <em>seen</em> him as a Beater? Oh, wait...I guess you probably have.” James broke into snickers, and Peter joined him.</p><p>“...and here come the jokes.” Remus' face disappeared as he sat up with a long-suffering sigh.</p><p>“So, Remus, is he that big all over? And I'm not talkin' 'bout his feet!”</p><p>“Amazing. It's been less than five minutes, and I already regret telling you. I regret so much.”</p><p>“Oh shit, here he comes,” James said.</p><p>“Oh no. Oh no ohno—it's too soon!” Sirius moaned. “I have many more minutes of life-enjoying to do!”</p><p>“Best be running then,” James said cheerfully.</p><p>“This is so stupid,” Remus muttered.</p><p>“Oh, Shacklebolt!” Lily called. “Yes, come over here! Come sit with us!”</p><p>Sirius gasped at this betrayal. She was obviously still upset about the thighs comment. That girl could hold a grudge for <em>ages.</em> Maybe she was bluffing.</p><p>“Morning Evans, Potter, Pettigrew. Hello Remus. Why is your part of the table smoking?”</p><p>She wasn't bluffing. Fuck.</p><p>“Fuck!” Sirius whispered.</p><p>“Good morning, Kingsley,” Remus said. He aimed a kick at Sirius, as if telling him to behave. Sirius ignored this. He had already Not Behaved last night without knowing it, so it was too late. This wasn't about Behaving anymore. It was about Surviving.</p><p>“I just want you to know, I'm very sorry for what's about to happen,” Remus continued.</p><p>“What's about to happen?” Shacklebolt asked. Sirius watched his lower half move from the end of the table and sit down on the bench he himself had vacated earlier. That was his cue.</p><p><em>“Fumos Foetidus!”</em> Sirius shouted, pointing his wand at the main entrance to the dining hall. A huge cloud of smoke exploded into existence in the doorway with an indecent fapping sound—a special addition he and James had designed—and then he was up and headed in the opposite direction.</p><p>“MARAUDERS! HANDS IN THE AIR!” McGonagall was already on her feet and yelling, but she had obligingly turned towards the explosion, so she didn't see Sirius running the other way as fast as he could while bent double behind the house tables. Out of the corner of his eye, Sirius saw the others throw their hands up. James' hands went up with such force that his silverware went flying across the room.</p><p>“This is unjust prosecution!” James shouted. “I have done nothing illicit this morning or any other morning—”</p><p>“Innocent!” Peter squeaked.</p><p>“—I have always been a model student except when my potential has been corrupted by unfair stereotypes—”</p><p>“I don't know what innocent even means anymore,” Remus groaned.</p><p>“—based solely on a few pranks, I mean, <em>harmless jokes</em> from the distant past—”</p><p>“I'm not with them. I just eat here,” Lily said conversationally, although her hands were up too.</p><p>“—and this ongoing prejudice distracts me from valuable learning!” James finished at last.</p><p>“WHERE IS BLACK?” McGonagall bellowed, with the borderline sanity of a woman that had been successfully driven to the brink on a semiweekly basis for seven years. Her head whipped around towards the Slytherin table when several of the students there started swelling up into large, radish-shaped masses. “BLACK!”</p><p>Damn, he'd blown his cover. He just hadn't been able to resist. The Slytherins had all been turned away from him, and their backs had been so beautifully unsuspecting and irresistible—</p><p>McGonagall shouted a stunning spell. Sirius leapt into the air to dodge it, using Bertram Aubrey's shoulder for leverage, and continued right towards her and the only remaining exit. He picked up speed on the stairs up to the dais, pulling two charmed glass globes out of his robes as he went. He threw them into the air and flung himself down, sliding right under the staff table where Flitwick's tiny legs left some room. He emerged on the other side with his wand already raised to detonate the bombs at the apex of their flight. They exploded into glorious clouds of glitter and streamers, filling the air with the sound of an angelic choir. It had been Peter's idea to add that sound effect to the devices, which they had dubbed Drama Bombs. The man <em>did</em> have his brilliant moments.</p><p>The Gryffindors were all cheering now, and most of the Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws had joined in.</p><p>
  <em>“Black, Black, Black!”</em>
</p><p>Sirius grinned wildly as he sprinted the last few meters to the staff exit. He was nearly in the clear when he caught a whiff of meat pie and saw the flaw in his escape plan. He skidded to a stop with his hands and feet against the doorframe and spun around, dodging another spell to grab the untouched pot pie from McGonagall's plate and an apple from Dumbledore's.</p><p>“Sorry, Professor! Places to be, deaths to avoid!” he gasped as he eluded her flailing arms. Apparently, she was so livid she had given up on curses and was now trying to catch him like a wayward bird.</p><p>“FIFTY POINTS—” she was saying, but he was already sailing through the door, made invincible by the rabid cheering coming from behind him, and he was in the staff corridors, home free.</p><p align="center">+++</p><p>Sirius finished licking the gravy off his fingers just in time as people started to file out of the dining hall. He peeked out from the nook underneath the main staircase, evaluated the situation in a split second, and ducked back under before anyone saw him. A wall of teachers strode right past without a second glance. Sometimes the best hiding places were in plain sight.</p><p>He closed his eyes, counting silently, then darted his hand out at exactly the right moment and reeled Remus in by the wrist. To his credit, Remus didn't shout, not even when the momentum made him thump into the corner of the nook.</p><p>“Oof, Padfoot, there you are!” He rubbed the back of his head, wincing. “I can't believe you were worried about Kingsley. It's McGonagall that's going to murder you.”</p><p>“The strength of McGonagall's passion for me is not news,” Sirius hissed. “But you fucking Shacklebolt is! Why didn't you tell me that last night?”</p><p>“I had to clear it with him first, obviously!”</p><p>“Obviously.” Sirius rolled his eyes.</p><p>“Don't be like that. I did it for you, you know.”</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>“I told everyone, so it's Level Two now. You can talk to James if you want.”</p><p>“Oh, so are you saying you—you came out for <em>me?</em>” He began the question sarcastically, but then his brain actually heard what Remus said and trailed off into sincerity.</p><p>“Technically, we both did.” Remus straightened his glasses and robes self-consciously.</p><p>“That's actually...very sweet.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Remus finished fussing with his robes and met his eyes. He was only a hands’ breadth away. A long moment passed where they just looked at each other.</p><p>“Fancy a snog?” Sirius asked.</p><p>Remus looked up at the underside of the staircase and groaned. Unfortunately, it wasn't a take-me-now kind of groan. It was more of a why-do-I-put-up-with-you kind of groan.</p><p>“Speaking of which, how exactly does all that work, cause you <em>said</em> you're—and I quote—‘fucking Kingsley,’ so does that mean you're <em>literally</em>—”</p><p>“Oh no. Sirius. We are so not going there.”</p><p>“'Cause I know how people <em>say</em> it works, but I was just checking, because, you know, he <em>is</em> awfully gigantic, and you—”</p><p>“Stop talking!” Remus slapped a hand over Sirius’ mouth. “As I <em>already</em> explained to James after your dramatic, glittery, unnecessary exit, I will not be answering any questions on topping, bottoming, prostates, or fellatio. You will have to satisfy your curiosity in a way that doesn't involve terminally embarrassing me.”</p><p>Sirius was quiet for a moment, as processing Remus saying words like ‘bottoming’ and ‘fellatio’ was not a task that could be done without conscious effort. “Hmph. That's hardly fair. We told you all about tits and the clitoris.”</p><p>“Information which I never asked for and, incidentally, will never use.”</p><p>“Ugh, fine. Then I'll ask you another type of question. Does he know about your furry little problem?”</p><p>“Of course not!” Remus shook his head vigorously, dislodging a streamer from his hair.</p><p>“That's what I thought. How long have you been going out?”</p><p>“A couple months. Does it matter?”</p><p>“Yes!” Sirius wailed quietly. He turned to the side to knock his forehead against the stone wall. The Pepper-Up potion was starting to wear off. “I don't get it! Why would you put up with a beast like him when I'm <em>totally willing,</em> and you wouldn't have to keep secrets from me at all? I know I fucked up big time last year, but I swear it won't happen again—”</p><p>“You think this is about last year?” Remus laughed. “I've nearly forgotten about that.”</p><p>“You—you have?” Sirius raised his head off the wall, incredulous with hope.</p><p>“Yes.” Remus smiled briefly but then rolled his eyes. “It's just that you would make a terrible boyfriend.”</p><p>Sirius whirled back to face him, deeply offended. “No, I wouldn't!”</p><p>“Sirius, you are the worst serial monogamist I have ever known. I don't think you have ever been in a relationship that lasted more than two weeks. You dump a girl as soon as a prettier one walks by.”</p><p>“That was a long time ago!”</p><p>“It was last Wednesday!” Remus threw his hands in the air.</p><p>Sirius sulked back into the opposite corner. It sure felt like a long time ago. Besides, he would never throw <em>Remus</em> over like that.</p><p>“You treat your partners like they're disposable,” Remus continued. “Kingsley on the other hand, is perfectly sweet, no matter what hallucinations you and James entertain, and he's actually <em>loyal</em> to his—”</p><p>Something inside Sirius snapped. Fury spiraled up inside him, dark and unforgiving. He sprang across the nook and pinned Remus to the curving underside of the staircase, hands gripping his shoulders far too tight.</p><p>“You are <em>not</em> disposable,” he growled. Then, without even meaning to, he covered Remus' stunned mouth with his own.</p><p>Remus shoved him away hard enough that his skull cracked against the wall opposite. Sirius saw stars and not the good kind. He felt something sharp—a nail or a sliver of stone—poke into his scalp.</p><p>“What is <em>wrong</em> with you?” Remus shouted, but Sirius was way ahead of him. He was already folding in on himself with shame. There were so many things wrong with him. He shouldn't have done that, especially not right after Remus had just been telling him no a dozen different ways. But the pit inside him was so <em>hungry</em>. He didn't know how to stop it from pushing and pushing until it shoved him down and started to go after Remus instead.</p><p>“I-I'm sorry,” he whispered, but it came out inaudible.</p><p>“Is everything all right under here?”</p><p>Sirius shrank even lower at the sound of Shacklebolt's voice, although at this point he would almost welcome death. Remus shook himself off, glaring.</p><p>“Yes. Sirius is just being a daft, instinct-driven niffler.” Remus ran his hands through his hair, shaking out a cloud of glitter. “<em>This</em> is all because he thinks you're going to murder him for making out with me last night.”</p><p>Shacklebolt raised his eyebrows. “Is that something I should be doing?”</p><p>Remus didn't answer. Sirius looked between them and offered, hesitantly, “Um. No?”</p><p>“I haven't decided yet. You <em>are</em> being really annoying.” Remus sighed and pulled Sirius out of his corner with a hand on his wrist. He was looking at the smear of blood that had rubbed off from the back of Sirius' head. “Are you bleeding? Don't. I hate that smell.” He still sounded irritated, but his hands as he pulled Sirius' head down to look were gentle. “You knocked against one of those metal things. <em>Episkey.</em>”</p><p>“I'm sorry,” Sirius repeated. Remus was already being nice again. He was too quick to forgive. Sirius felt sick.</p><p>“I know you are.” Remus' hands left his head, and he stepped back next to Shacklebolt. “I'm going to go ahead and assume you're done interrogating me, because I said I'd meet Peter in the library about that Muggle Studies essay of his. I'll see you later, all right?”</p><p>Once he left, it was just Sirius and Shacklebolt, staring at each other. Shacklebolt didn't have glitter in his hair. He didn't <em>have</em> hair. He looked down at Sirius from his far superior height and far superior position in life and narrowed his eyes into a pointed glare.</p><p>This time there was no glitter, no spell-dodging gymnastics, and no applause. Sirius just ran.</p><p align="center">+++</p><p>“You should take them all.” Flitwick's squeaky voice easily penetrated the tapestry Sirius was hiding behind in the staff lounge. He froze in place where he was sitting with the last bite of Dumbledore's apple still in his mouth, unchewed. This alcove was one of his favorite in-plain-sight hiding spots, and it wasn't like it was hard to guess the password on the door. It had been a rotating combination of expletives and the names of the Marauders for five years now. Plus, it meant he often got the chance to eavesdrop, which helped him evaluate the bell curve of McGonagall's anger.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Evans' charm work is without match, and Potter isn't far behind her,” Flitwick was saying. “I'm willing to bet that modification to the smokescreen charm was his invention.”</p><p>“And you know he would do it,” McGonagall said. “He's a devil to manage in a school like this, but that boy has a heart of gold. He won't turn his back on suffering, no matter how dangerous it is. He's a true Gryffindor.”</p><p>Sirius rolled the chunk of apple around in his mouth, grinning at the tone of pride in her voice. If Prongs could hear that...! But his ears perked up even more at the word ‘dangerous.’</p><p>“Pettigrew will go wherever Potter goes, as usual. He's a mediocre student, but Merlin knows we can use every willing person, with the way this war is going.” McGonagall's voice sounded weary, resigned.</p><p>Sirius swallowed the piece of apple abruptly. It was too big and seemed to stick in his throat on the way down. He had heard about the war, of course. The Daily Prophet was always running articles about the latest Death Eater atrocity. He tried not to look at them. He was terrified he would see a face or name he knew.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Regulus hadn't come back to school this year. Apparently, he had bigger and better things to do...things like killing Muggle schoolchildren.</p><p>“Yes,” a third voice said. It was Dumbledore. “And of course we must have Lupin.”</p><p>“He won't say no,” Flitwick piped.</p><p>“No, I don't imagine he will,” McGonagall said. “My point is, Albus, those four—five if you include Evans, which I gather they do now—are too close. You won't be able to be so choosy. Besides, Black is exactly what we need. He detonated those godawful glitter things without even looking, <em>while</em> dodging my spells and stealing my lunch.”</p><p>“And I don't even recognize what he did to those poor Slytherins,” Flitwick said. “I think it may be his own creation. Poppy is still trying to work it out.”</p><p>Sirius tried to smirk with satisfaction, but only half his face obeyed. It was gratifying to know he was admired even in the secret conversations of the professors, but he was starting to understand the deeper significance of this conversation, which was making him very uneasy. They were talking about recruiting the Marauders for their supposedly secret Order of the Phoenix. From what Sirius had heard, it was a group of civilian wizards and Squibs who went all vigilante on the Death Eaters whenever they got the chance. It sounded cool, but only if you didn't know what the other side was like. Sirius did. He had grown up in that cesspool, and he wasn't afraid to admit that it terrified him. He didn't want anything to do with it.</p><p>They were probably right about Prongs. James would step up to any plate that had ‘honor’ written on it without hesitation, and of course Peter would follow, because he was too stupid to run away if James told him not to. And Remus...Remus would go even though he was smart enough to be afraid, because he believed he owed Dumbledore. Sirius' fists clenched, and the piece of apple still lodged in his esophagus poked painfully. Remus <em>would</em> go. He would let himself be indebted for the rest of his life, just because Dumbledore had decided to treat him like a person instead of a monster, as if he hadn't already been a person with a right to go to school in the first place.</p><p>“I'm afraid that is rather my point,” Dumbledore said. “Black is not like the rest of them. There is a darkness in him that we should be wary of. And we must consider his family ties. His loyalty may be uncertain in moments of crisis.”</p><p>Sirius growled inaudibly, deep in his throat. His breath oozed out between his teeth, and he imagined, with his eyes closed, that it had form as curling black smoke, rage made visible. So that's how it was then. It didn't matter that he had run out on his family, that he had turned down an entire fucking fortune, that he had dedicated countless nights and most of his still-developing magic to keeping Remus alive when <em>Dumbledore</em> had decided locking him up in a rotting shack every full moon was adequate protection. It didn't matter to them that he had treated every Muggle-born and mixed-blood student in the school with respect, or even that he had gotten sorted into Gryffindor in the first place. On some level, he was still just another Black to them. Untrustworthy. Don't turn your back on a Black, that's what people said, right?</p><p>He wouldn't join their insane crusade even if they begged him. He <em>had</em> seen the articles. It was pointless to resist. The other side already had the upper hand, and that wasn't going to change. Sirius knew very well what people like his mother did when they had the upper hand. They squeezed. That's why he had run away from home. He was sick of trying to fight something that couldn't be stopped. It would take a bigger miracle than the Marauders to turn the tide at this point.</p><p>But the others <em>would</em> join if asked. They would join, even though there was no victory waiting with the Order, only trauma and torture and death, because none of them understood trauma and torture and death like Sirius did—none of them except Remus. And Remus would never say no.</p><p>Sirius curled over on himself, pressing his fists against his temples, trying to drown out that certainty with a simple application of pressure. Halfway down his chest, the apple was still trying to pierce through him. He focused in on that pain until it became something much harder and sharper, until it became something he could use.</p><p>Slowly, he uncurled his fists. His fingernails had cut into his palms, raising four little crescent-moons of blood on each side. Moons for Moony. For Moony and Prongs and Wormtail and Lily too.</p><p>The professors were still talking, but he had long ago stopped listening. He picked up the apple core from his lap with blood-smeared hands, stood up, and flung the tapestry aside with one broad sweep of his arm.</p><p>All three of them froze, staring, as he walked forward with deliberate, echoing steps. He tossed the apple core into the air and vanished it with his wand. <em>Without</em> looking, because style really did matter, even now—maybe especially now.</p><p>He slowed down even more, practically sauntering, daring McGonagall with his eyes to say the words 'detention' or 'house points' after she had just been talking about him and his friends like they were options to pick between at a buffet to feed their hopeless war machine, like she didn't want to take away his ‘godawful glitter bombs’ and replace them with <em>actual fucking bombs.</em></p><p>She didn't say anything. None of them did. They just looked at him like he had appeared out of thin air instead of from behind a tapestry. Sirius wondered how he had ever found them intimidating at all. They weren't even taller than him anymore.</p><p>“You're not wrong about me,” he said at last, once he was directly opposite them and staring McGonagall down. “So take it. Take that darkness you're so afraid of,” he paused to look at Dumbledore, “and <em>use</em> it. Just point me in the right direction. Point me at the monsters that turned my little brother into a fucking fascist or at the bastards that made Remus into something that even <em>you</em> don't feel guilty about using, and I promise you…I will take them down so thoroughly you'll never find the pieces. No matter how close our family ties might be.”</p><p>So much for becoming a Healer and finding the cure to lycanthropy. He would be too busy trying to keep Remus and the others from getting killed by things they were too pure to understand, but maybe it was better this way. He was probably too fucked up to be a Healer anyways. Maybe if he gave the Black hole inside him an outlet, it would stop trying to do him in.</p><p>“What are you waiting for!” he bellowed suddenly when they all just kept staring at him. Flitwick flinched. Sirius didn't care. He yanked up the sleeve of his robes. “Go ahead, brand a phoenix onto my arm! I came of age last night, so whatever it is you do, do it! Because I'm not letting you take them without me!”</p><p>Dumbledore stepped forward, eyes unreadable behind the reflections in his half-moon glasses. He reached out and touched Sirius' bare arm with cool, dry fingers.</p><p>“We don't brand people, Sirius. But, if you will, you may kneel.”</p><p>And that was how, less than twenty-four hours after turning seventeen, Sirius Black became the first of the Marauders to be inducted into the Order of the Phoenix.</p>
