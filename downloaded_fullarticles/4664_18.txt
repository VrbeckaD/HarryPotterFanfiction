  <strong>Year 1- Part 1</strong>
</p><p>The art classroom at Shetland Stone Elementary was thick with the warm scent of crayons and acrylic paint. It bubbled with the squealing chatter of antsy fifth graders. Mrs. Kennedy was a mousy, librarian-ish woman who was unfortunate enough to be responsible for controlling this particularly rambunctious group of children while still trying to cram some sort of knowledge and practice of the fine arts into their heads.</p><p>“Today, I want us to practice what we’ve learned about subject, foreground, and background,” she had squeaked as confidently as she could when her students had taken their seats, “I want each of you to draw a scene of a picnic on a hillside, and make sure you show me those three elements. You can draw anybody you want at your picnic. They can be eating whatever you can imagine, too. This assignment is supposed to be fun, so I don’t want to hear any complaining. I want to see you working hard, not hardly working! Crayons and poster paper are already at your tables, so chop chop!”</p><p>So of course, ten minutes later, Mrs. Kennedy was sprinting back and forth across the room, trying to keep the amount of crayons sailing through the air to a minimum, shouting desperate requests for everybody to use their inside voices, and had completely given up the notion that her lesson might have actually been educational that day.</p><p>At one of the round wooden tables in the back of the room, two boys named Aiden Turner and Mitchell Brooks were not doing anything to assuage Mrs. Kennedy’s stress levels. Aiden took a red crayon in his left hand and a black crayon in his right, then scribbled loop after loop on his paper, making revving and crashing noises as if the crayons were racecars. After his red crayon took a particularly devastating hit and slid across the table, he glanced over at Mitchell’s paper.</p><p>“What are you drawing? A yellow pig?”</p><p>“No, come on, it’s Pikachu! He’s going to be eating a radioactive hamburger and drinking a cup of Chemical X!”</p><p>“Dude, what is that, from Powerpuff Girls? That’s so lame, man.”</p><p>“What? Well you were the one who knew it was from Powerpuff Girls. You’re lame.”</p><p>“I’m telling you, Power Rangers is a sick show, the blue ranger blasted Squatt, and the red ranger punched Baboo in the same episode,” Aiden argued.</p><p>“Nah that show is for little kids. That’s what my dad says,” jeered Mitchell.</p><p>Loretta Baker, a wiry girl with wide green eyes, let the boy’s conversation entertain her while she worked on her project. 'Etta had drawn a blanket for the foreground and was working on a cooked lobster as the subject. She thought the lobster would look more interesting than the sandwiches that everyone else was doing.</p><p>“Hey Etta,” Mitchell prompted, “Do you think Aiden is a baby for watching Power Rangers?”</p><p>“I don’t think watching a TV show makes you a baby or an adult,” Etta said.</p><p>This was not the response Mitchell was fishing for at all.</p><p>“Whatever,” he said, then promptly engaged Aiden in a crayon-throwing fight.</p><p>Etta went back to her lobster. She wasn’t really interested in the boys’ or anyone’s conversation, but was glad to have the background noise. It wasn’t that she disliked the other children, or she felt misunderstood and left out- no, nothing like that. She was simply more interested in drawing her lobster than socializing.</p><p>She was just finishing up the eyes on her lobster as Mr. Ryan, her homeroom teacher, arrived in the classroom and started chatting to Miss Kennedy. He was there to walk the students back to his own classroom. Shetland Elementary had this rule that the children needed supervision even in the hallways.</p><p>Miss Kennedy called for everyone to bring their pictures up to the front of the class, but she continued her conversation with him, sparing minimal attention the artwork piling up in her hands. Etta had lost track of class time, and was disappointed she hadn’t been able to draw a background and finish the assignment properly. She got in line with her classmates and thought, <em> Oh well, my art class grade isn’t too important. </em></p><p>When it was her turn to hand in her assignment, Miss Kennedy glanced at her picture and exclaimed, “Oh Sweetie, how interesting!” in a coddling tone.</p><p><em> Huh? </em> Etta thought. She didn’t do the assignment properly. Why was Miss Kennedy praising her?</p><p>As she joined the rest of the class in the hallway, she heard Mr Ryan tell Miss Kennedy in a voice not meant to reach Etta’s ears, “That girl is great. She is so quiet. It’s refreshing. I swear, I might strangle some of the others before summer break.”</p><p>Etta furrowed her brows on the way back to homeroom. She felt a flash of annoyance, but took her a few steps to figure out why. <em>I do more things than just ‘be quiet,’ </em>she thought, quite insulted. A strong wave of frustration coursed through her mind, and her ears turned red. At that exact moment, a high pitched whine filled the school. All the students in the hallway clutched their ears and looked at the speaker near the ceiling.</p><p>The voice of the principal crackled over the speakers a few seconds later. “I’m sorry about the technical difficulties, everyone. Our PA system must be out of date. Carry on with classes as usual.”</p><p>Etta couldn’t remember there ever being technical difficulties in her school before. She shrugged, and took a seat in her homeroom. By the end of the day, she had forgotten the whole thing.</p><p> </p><p>---</p><p> </p><p>Etta smiled as she saw the silver SUV come around the turn and inch toward her in the line of cars waiting to pick up respective students in the parking lot outside the school. The passenger door opened and a middle aged woman in a crisp suit greeted her as she climbed into the car.</p><p>“How was school, Honey?” Mrs. Baker asked.</p><p>“Good, we started reading this book,” she pulled it out of her backpack, “ <em>A Midsummers Night’s Dream Abridged for Kids- </em>by William Shakespeare and abridged by Samantha Pennyworth. It’s great it has faeries and adventure and it’s kind of funny. Maybe I can be an author when I grow up.”</p><p>“I’m so glad you are interested in school, Honey. You will be a great addition to Mommy’s and Daddy’s consulting company when you grow up!” She patted her daughter on the back. “Can you imagine having to re-write stories from old dead guys like poor Miss Pennyworth!?” She gave a short laugh.</p><p>Etta gave a little giggle and looked at her feet as they stopped at a stop sign. Actually, Etta thought writing stories with faeries would be fun, but it didn’t cross her mind say so to her mother.</p><p>The familiar jiggle of the car indicated the car had crossed over the lip of the Baker’s driveway. Mrs. Baker put the car in park and Etta jogged up to through the front door, backpack bouncing. Etta kicked off her shoes under the “Welcome” plaque decorated with angels and floral located in the front hallway.</p><p>“Mark, we’re home” Mrs. Baker called. Mr. Baker came into the hallway, a frown replacing his usually confident grin. Mrs. Baker’s polished, chipper expression faltered at the look on her husband’s expression. A second later, a severe looking woman with hair tied back into a slick bun followed Mr. Baker into the hallway. The woman’s dark, imposing robes looked very out of place in front of a pastel, beach themed wallpaper.</p><p>“Well who is this?” Mrs. Baker asked, perplexed.</p><p>Although she internally judged the woman for dressing so eccentric, she still wanted the stranger to think her confident and put together.   </p><p>“I am Minerva McGonagall, Deputy Headmistress at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry,” said the woman. Mrs. Baker’s eyebrow travelled up her forehead. “Why don’t you all take a seat. I’m afraid I don’t have as much time as I would like to explain everything.” The four people took a seat at the kitchen table. Minerva took a deep breath and looked Etta in the eyes. “My dear, you are a witch.”</p><p>Etta’s face broke into a huge smile. The smile didn’t leave her face, even as her parents called the woman crazy. Even when her mother told the woman that she was “too well mannered and sensible to be a witch.”</p><p>Mr. and Mrs. Baker continued to dismiss the story in short condescending tones. After what seemed to be the fortieth time Minerva attempted to give the couple a calm explanation, she pinched the bridge of her nose in strained patience. Then, she abruptly changed into a tabby cat and back to human. Clinging to each other in shock, Etta’s parents did not interrupt her for the rest of her explanation of the wizarding world, muggles, and the statute of secrecy.</p><p>Professor McGonagall, as she requested to be addressed, knelt down to talk to Etta directly. She gave Etta a wax sealed envelope which contained her welcome letter and directions to the Hogwarts Express. She apologized for not being able to stay to answer more questions before she left the kitchen.</p><p>Etta ran to window and pressed her face up to the glass to see which way the professor would go. However, she looked in every direction and could only see her neighbor mowing the lawn.</p><p>The elder Bakers looked a little shaken as they went to sit on the couch in the living room. Etta, still grinning, bounded onto the room to sit with them.</p><p>“Well, you seem to be happy about this,” Mrs. Baker smiled weakly at her daughter. Etta nodded. “I guess this beats the bicycle I was going to surprise you with for your birthday on Saturday.” The family laughed.</p><p>Etta couldn’t sleep that night. She lay in her bed holding the welcome letter and reading it over and over again. She didn’t know how she was going to bear waiting through the last month of school and the whole summer until she could go to Hogwarts.</p>
