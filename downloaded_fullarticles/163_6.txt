    <p>Percival was minding his own business in the way to his office when he saw you walking, almost running to him, he was instantly on alert, “Y/N, are you well?”</p><p>You were a little out of breath, “Quick, I need you to kiss me right now!”</p><p>To say he was surprised was an understatement, he was shocked, but seeing your panicked eyes and ignoring his heart racing, he looked around, only one man was coming and you were practically throwing yourself at him, so, throwing caution to the wind, he kissed you.</p><p>“I owe you a big one,” you whispered against his lips, “that wizard has been following me trying to get me to agree to a date.”</p><p>He raised his eyebrow and looked behind you without letting you go, sure enough, the man looked disappointed and turned and left, “You’re safe now, he’s leaving… but you owe me one.”</p><p>You chuckled to hide your nervousness, “Yes I do, sorry, but asking for a kiss was the only thing I thought would get rid of him, how about I make you dinner as a thank you?”</p><p>He pretended to think about it, but smirked at you, “Dinner would do well madam, your cooking is delightful.”</p>
