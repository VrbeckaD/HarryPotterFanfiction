    <p>Persephone Jackson was not having a good day. First, she had to go on a stupid mission to a stupid school with a stupid name halfway across the world for some stupid reason. Granted that the mission was to protect an innocent boy from a psychopathic, murdering bastard who wanted said boy dead and that said mission was to a wizarding school and thus required her to learn some awesome magic skills, but that was beside the point. The point being that the school and the mission was in England and that she was to do this alone.</p><p>Thus bringing her to the second reason for her shitty day being that because of said mission, she got into a fight with one of her closest friends (and once girlfriend), Annabeth Chase. While they broke up on a mutual agreement that they were better as just friends, they were still extremely dependent on each other in the aftermath of the Giant War, more specifically The Pit. The simple idea of it still gave her goosebumps and neither of them could even think of the word without unwanted memories being dug up. So imagine Annabeth's shock and rage to hear that she had accepted a mission so soon after the war without even asking her. The resulting argument had been explosive and ended up with her stowing away on a cruise liner to London in the middle of the night (not one of her smartest plans) just to get away from it all.</p><p><br/>
She had originally accepted the mission from Trivia to solely help the kid get through the school year alive, remembering how hard it was to get through school while fighting for your life day in and day out (she would have loved to have someone do this for her back then). But after her fight with Annabeth, it became clear to her that she needed a fresh perspective on life and that this was her chance for it. A new life and a clean slate. No more pitying looks from her friends and people who would treat her like cracked glass. She had saved the world twice and gods-be-damned if she was going to sit around waiting for someone to fix her. But as good as she was at fixing other people's problems she was delusional when it came to solving her own. The distance moving away to London put between her and the Greeks did nothing to console her. Instead, she had never felt more lonely in her entire life. The reason for that was because it seemed that no matter how much distance she put between her and her past, it would never be enough to stop the memories and sorrow and guilt she felt every night when the nightmares came to tear at the fraying seams of her sanity. Of course, this had happened several weeks ago and she had resolved her conflicts with Annabeth long ago. But it did nothing to console her raging mind that was plagued with questions that were raised in that argument. Questions that, to her utter frustration, she had yet to solve.</p><p><br/>
All of this culminated in a fight with the allegedly biggest git in the school Draco Malfoy (and yeah, alleged because she was never one to judge from rumors and first appearances, being subjected to it far too often to subject another to the same treatment). She hadn't exactly been planning for a confrontation with him or anyone. Really she had been hoping to keep her head down out of as much trouble as possible, but to be frank, since when was her luck ever that good. Here's a hint, never.</p><p><br/>
So as luck, or fate (those female dogs), would have it while walking down the vast halls of Hogwarts to her next class, she was body slammed by Harry Potter, the boy who lived, aka the kid she here to keep alive for the next year or so. As first impressions go, this was not one of her best. She glared at him with such intensity that it said 'watch it or you'll be waking up in the lake outside' all on its own. Sure it would be wise for her to be nice and friendly to him if only to make her job here easier but she was so not in the mood for acting. She could see him cower a bit before steeling himself against her glare and pointing to the albino kid behind him with two burly kids for bodyguards, mumbling about how he was the one to shove him into her. She raised an eyebrow at the boy who lived, mentally congratulating him for resisting her wolf glare albeit not in full power but still, impressive. She then turned to the albino asking if this was true, giving him the benefit of the doubt. Instead of an answer, all she got for her troubles was a sneer and an insult for being a Hufflepuff that should mind her own business.</p><p><br/>
At this, she finally snapped. Pinning him with her best glare she stalked up to him. The hero of Olympus stopped only a foot in front of him, making good use of the inch she had on him in height, and stated in a deathly quiet voice, "I'm making it my business so give me one good reason not bring this up to Professor Snape?" The kid looked terrified. She felt almost bad for him and would have felt more sympathy for him if she was not in rampage mode. To his credit though, the albino stood his ground and even through his terror, she could see the same analytical spark in his grey eyes she saw in Annabeth's.</p><p><br/>
Then he finally spoke. "Because I'll make your life hell". And the irony of the unexpected statement was not lost on her either. Her lips twitched into a brittle smirk that most probably looked as unhinged as she felt by the statement and a bitter laugh pushed its way through her parted lips before she whispered, "Show me your worst."</p><p><br/>
This seemed to hit some nerve because in a blink of an eye the terrified kid was gone and the albino's eyes held a hint of challenge as well as a whole lot of superiority and arrogance, like enough to rival Zeus. He stepped back, pulling out his wand and she did the same. Her stance we defensive, allowing him the first shot. "Imperio" was echoed in the by now vaguely empty hallway. She rolled under the spell and throw out her own "Impedimenta" which hit its mark.</p><p><br/>
While she could have just as easily have disarmed or stunned him, now that she had a fight, she wanted it to last. She was also pissed by his attempt at mind control. She had lost many things over the years including much of her sanity but the one thing she had never lost was her free will and she'll be damned if she allowed that to be taken from her too.</p><p><br/>
She stood from her kneeling position and dared him to hit her. Unfortunately, it seemed that he was also pissed and gladly complied with her request with a clear shout of "Reducto". The red flash of light hit her square in the chest and sent her flying over the railing. She was quick to catch herself on the edge of the floor but not without being rewarded with the pain of the backlash and her body slam into the wall. She was able to swing herself up, flipping in the process and landing on the railing with a grace that she didn't know she possessed. The albino looked like he was slowly trying to make his way to the railing which chilled her boiling anger some to a more manageable bite-sized serving. The two-time savior of the world had had enough of the fight though and wanted to wrap this up with a little bow on top. She flashed him a cheeky smile before disarming him with a quick "Expelliarmus" spell. She hopped off the banister and was about to walk off like the boss she was before she felt a hand grab her wrist.</p><p><br/>
What happened next was completely out of her control. She panicked and her body acted of its own accord. She twisted around and kneed the person in the gut before forcing her whole body weight to shift forward, pulling both her and the mystery person to the ground. Her body quickly pinned the person down, one knee digging into the gut, the other leg spread across both of the attacker's legs, trapping them. She had the hand that had grabbed her in a vice-like grip but before she could trap the other a fist slammed into her face, busting her lip. She used this to locate the attacker's arm and used her forearm to force down their arm soon enough had the arm pinned down as well. She then got a good look at her attacker and was so surprised by who she saw accidentally voiced her thoughts.</p><p><br/>
"Albino? What the shit are you doing?"</p><p><br/>
"I could bloody well ask you the same question."</p><p><br/>
Before she could introduce him to some classic Perci Jackson sass, she heard footsteps running their way. She looked up to see some professors she had yet to learn to names of followed by the boy who lived, her only friends here Fred and George Weasley, and a shit ton of other students that most definitely did not need to be here. George had to pull her off of the albino and had her leaning on him while Fred fretted over her injuries. She knew that they were making her out to be the victim and she could not be more grateful to have them as friends as she was in that moment. While she been walked to the infirmary wing, she passed by the albino being grilled and fussed over by Snape and they shared a look of cold indifference.</p><p><br/>
While the fight was a long time coming, it was not as enjoyable as she had hoped. She had ended up with detention for a week for fighting on school grounds and being late to class. The only good thing about the day was that she got to skip a few classes but even those hours were filled with being fussed over by the nurse which made her chest hurt with heartache for all those she left for this quest.</p><p><br/>
She thought of all this on her way to the Black Lake to wash away the pains of the day (was it too much to ask for it wash away her sins? Probably) with a reviving swim in the dead of night.</p>
