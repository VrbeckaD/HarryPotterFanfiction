    <p>“You still read that drivel?” Percy asked when he saw George reading the Daily Prophet.</p><p>“It’s a good laugh,” George shrugged, “Oliver’s in the paper again.”</p><p>“Is he?”</p><p>“Yeah. Everyone wants to know about his love life.”</p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p>“Speaking of which, when do I get to meet your new boyfriend?”</p><p>“What boyfriend?”</p><p>“’What boyfriend?’” George mocked lightly, “The one you’ve clearly told Charlie and Bill about.”</p><p>“I don’t know what you’re…”</p><p>“Don’t play dumb with me. When are you going to bring him over and introduce him to us?”</p><p>“So you can interrogate him like the other men I bring home?” Percy challenged.</p><p>“If this ‘non-existent’ boyfriend can’t handle a little…screening…then, he isn’t worth your time.”</p><p>“You don’t need to screen everyone I date like some sort of job interview.”</p><p>George sighed.</p><p>“You deserve someone who treats you right, Perce,” he said, “Not like that muggle git who cheated on you in your own flat, or the one who treated you like a punching bag or…”</p><p>“George,” Percy interrupted, “Please.”</p><p>“Sorry.”</p><p>“I have to go.”</p><p>“Going to see your boyfriend?” George smirked.</p><p>Percy glared at him jokingly.</p><p>…</p><p>Percy was greeted with a hug and a kiss on the cheek when he apparated into the kitchen of his flat.</p><p>“You can’t just snog on me without so much as a hello,” Percy said.</p><p>“Hello, Percy.”</p><p>Percy laughed and turned to his boyfriend.</p><p>“Hello, Oliver.”</p><p>“Is George giving you a hard time again?”</p><p>“He means well,” Percy defended, “But, I wish he’d lay off a bit.”</p><p>Oliver nodded.</p><p>“I noticed you were in the paper again.”</p><p>“Seems they can’t take no for an answer,” Oliver stated, “They’ve moved on to guessing random Quidditch players.”</p><p>“Ought to keep them busy for a while.”</p><p>Percy sat at the table, Oliver across from him.</p><p>“Something wrong?” Oliver asked.</p><p>The Weasley shook his head.</p><p>“I’ve known you long enough to know that look. Did you have a fight with George?”</p><p>“No,” Percy answered, “It isn’t…It’s…”</p><p>“Is it…me?”</p><p>“Yes. NO. No, it’s not.”</p><p>“Now, you’re confusing me.”</p><p>“How long have we been together, Ollie?”</p><p>“About a month. Why?”</p><p>“A month,” Percy pondered, “That’s how long I was with Alex.”</p><p>Oliver remembered Alex, the muggle Percy started dating barely a year after Fred died, after Percy came out to his family. He knew how heartbroken Percy had been, that his first serious boyfriend had been a cheater.</p><p>“And, Devon,” Oliver snarled, “The one who beat you.”</p><p>Percy had jumped right into a relationship with Devon, a wizard, just a few months after Alex. It went sour fast, and Oliver noticed Percy start to flinch every time Devon moved or raised his voice. Unfortunately, Percy wouldn’t listen to anyone who told him to leave Devon, and they only broke up after George caught Devon hitting Percy in his store.</p><p>“He didn’t beat me,” Percy corrected.</p><p>“You still flinch when I touch you,” Oliver said, “And, last year, what was his name…Theo?”</p><p>Percy closed his eyes. Theo was miles worse than Devon from what Oliver heard. He never layed a hand on Percy but made sure to publicly and privately berate and humiliate him at every turn. Oliver saw it wear on Percy over the three months they were together, heard him deny that he was being abused constantly. It was Oliver who overheard Theo telling Percy at Ron’s birthday party that Ron resented him and wished Percy had been the one to die. He didn’t finish that sentence before Oliver busted his nose open and kicked him out of the Burrow.</p><p>“I’m rubbish at choosing dates,” Percy admitted.</p><p>“Not always,” Oliver said, “There was Sam, and Matt, and Kyler.”</p><p>“All of which, I dumped after a couple weeks.”</p><p>“Who could fault you for that? You’d just escaped an abusive relationship.”</p><p>“Escaped?” Percy questioned, “George threw Devon out of the shop and he never came back.”</p><p>“Not how George tells it,” Oliver said, “He said you were covered in bruises, that Devon kept coming around the shop and the Burrow, harassing your family, begging you to come back.”</p><p>“How many times have we discussed this?”</p><p>“Not enough.”</p><p>“Why should we?”</p><p>“It still affects you, even though you refuse to acknowledge it,” Oliver answered, “Like the other day, when you had a panic attack after spilling tea all over the floor.”</p><p>“You’re right,” Percy said, “I’m just broken…Worthless and broken…I don’t deserve you…”</p><p>“That isn’t what I…I didn’t mean to…I wasn’t bringing this up to humiliate you. I would never do that.”</p><p>Percy stayed silent, looking at the table as Oliver continued.</p><p>“You don’t communicate enough,” Oliver said, “When something’s bothering you, you just hold it in.”</p><p>“Devon took my wand from me when he felt I got too…’abrasive’…as he put it.”</p><p>“He TOOK your wand?”</p><p>“I never told anyone what he did,” Percy continued, “Not even my family. They still don’t know the real reason I missed Christmas that year.”</p><p>“You weren’t really sick, were you?”</p><p>“Devon wanted me to stay with him at my flat for Christmas. I asked why we couldn’t go to my parents together, said that he had no right to tell me not to see my family.”</p><p>“Which he doesn’t.”</p><p>“Evidently, this assertion was enough to deserve being stripped and bent over this very table…”</p><p>Percy shuddered. Oliver looked horrified.</p><p>“That was the first time…”</p><p>“The. FIRST. Time?” Oliver gritted his teeth.</p><p>“Of many,” Percy said, almost inaudibly, “He was worse than I let on.”</p><p>“Clearly.”</p><p>“This whole relationship has me on edge,” Percy admitted, “Just waiting for the inevitable crash and burn, so to speak.”</p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p>“It would be so easy for you to…”</p><p>“To hurt you?”</p><p>“It’s inevitable, isn’t it?” Percy explained, “You’re quite popular, lots of fans following you around, ones that would shag you at a moment’s notice. And, I’ll something, do something, that that makes you angry and you’ll…snap…”</p><p>“What Devon did to you is not ‘snapping.’”</p><p>“Who would believe me over star-player Oliver Wood?”</p><p>“Your family, for one. They’d kill me.”</p><p>“They love you.”</p><p>“Percy, you’ve known me for years.”</p><p>“People can change.”</p><p>“Do you really think I could hurt you, or cheat on you?”</p><p>“How am I supposed to know?” Percy demanded, “It’s only been a month!”</p><p>Oliver pulled his chair over and sat next to his boyfriend.</p><p>“It’s okay,” he rubbed Percy’s back, “Breathe.”</p><p>Percy didn’t seem to realize that his breathing had quickened until he took a few deep breaths.</p><p>“There you go,” Oliver encouraged, “It’s gonna be okay. I’m here for you.”</p><p>Percy leaned against Oliver as he began to breathe normally.</p><p>“Better?”</p><p>Percy nodded.</p><p>“You know the difference between you and my Quidditch fans?”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“They don’t give a shit about who I really am,” he answered, “It’s the fame they care about, the status, the opportunity to say you bedded a pro-Quidditch player. You, on the other hand, couldn’t care less about being ‘Oliver Wood’s new sweetheart.’”</p><p>“Those papers are rubbish,” Percy said, “You know that.”</p><p>Oliver smirked.</p><p>“I’m lucky to have you.”</p><p>“Lucky?” Percy seemed genuinely confused.</p><p>“I was too much of a coward to ask you out at Hogwarts,” Oliver said, “I never thought you’d like me back, that you’d actually say yes, especially with how badly I stumbled over myself asking you out.”</p><p>Percy laughed.</p><p>“I never thought you liked me.”</p><p>Oliver kissed him on the cheek again.</p><p>…</p><p>“What?” Percy asked when Ginny glared at him.</p><p>He was visiting Harry and Ginny’s flat for dinner, as he did every other Thursday. He’d made an effort since the war, after Fred died, to see his family more often, so they planned something every other week. Molly and Arthur got him on Sundays, Ron and Hermione on Mondays, Charlie on Tuesdays when he was home, George had Wednesdays at his shop, Harry and Ginny had Thursdays, and Bill and Fleur had Friday.</p><p>“Why don’t you introduce us to your boyfriend?” she asked.</p><p>“Not YOU, too,” Percy sighed, “I do not have a ‘new boyfriend.’”</p><p>“An old one, then?” Ginny asked, “You’re not dating one of those…prats again, are you?”</p><p>“No,” Percy answered, “He is someone you know from Hogwarts, however.”</p><p>“That’s a terrible hint,” Harry said lightly.</p><p>Percy shrugged.</p><p>“It’ll keep you guessing,” he smirked.</p><p>…</p><p>Bill was in the stands with Percy, Fleur, and the two-year-old Victoire, watching Oliver’s Friday night game. All the Weasleys, and their spouses by extension, were given VIP seats to all of Oliver’s games. Percy attended nearly every match.</p><p>“So,” Bill leaned close to Percy, so he could hear over the crowd, “How’s Ollie treating you?”</p><p>“Good,” Percy answered, “You don’t have to ask that every time you see me.”</p><p>“Yes, I do,” Bill said, “Because, if you think I’d let ‘star player Oliver Wood’ get away with so much as a mean look toward you without throwing him off his broom from a very high place…”</p><p>“Bill!” Fleur scolded.</p><p>“Did Oliver tell you…”</p><p>“Don’t think he meant to,” Bill answered, “He just wanted advice, and who better to ask than your older brother?”</p><p>“When?”</p><p>“Yesterday.”</p><p>“He didn’t tell you about…”</p><p>“What Devon did to you?” Bill sneered, “Again, he didn’t mean to, and I may have squeezed it out of him. And, if I see that monster again, I’ll kill him.”</p><p>Fleur didn’t scold Bill that time.</p><p>…</p><p>Oliver brightened when he saw Percy sitting in the Puddlemere lounge area after the game.</p><p>“Bill and Fleur left,” Percy said, “Victoire was getting tired and grumpy.”</p><p>Oliver sat next to him.</p><p>“You told them about Devon,” Percy said quietly.</p><p>“It slipped, but I’m sorry.”</p><p>“It’s okay.”</p><p>“No, it isn’t,” Oliver said, “That was something you told me in confidence and I went and blabbed it.”</p><p>“I’m sure Bill drilled it out of you,” Percy shrugged.</p><p>“You have every reason to be angry with me right now.”</p><p>“I’m not.”</p><p>He was. He was, but something always screamed at him not to cause conflict with Oliver. That’s how he’s been with all his boyfriends: agreeable, complacent.</p><p>“I can see it on your face,” Oliver said, “Whenever you get upset with me, you refuse to say anything.”</p><p>“Do you think I can’t see what you’re doing?” Percy glared at him.</p><p>“What…”</p><p>“You’re trying to bait me into a fight,” Percy said, “And, it’s not the first time you’ve done it, either.”</p><p>“Percy…”</p><p>Percy stood up and turned toward Oliver.</p><p>“I’ll be at the flat,” he said before disapparating.</p><p>…</p><p>Percy apparated into his kitchen.</p><p>
  <strong>
    <em>‘You shouldn’t speak to me like that,’ Devon spoke.</em>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <em>‘I am GOING to see my family tomorrow,’ Percy insisted.</em>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <em>Devon shoved him against the table faster than he could process what was happening.</em>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <em>‘Stop!’ Percy begged, ‘Please!’</em>
  </strong>
</p><p>He shook the memory from his head and continued past the bathroom.</p><p>
  <strong>
    <em>‘Look at yourself,’ Theo dragged Percy into bathroom while he was having a panic attack, “Look!”</em>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <em>Percy viewed his quivering face in the mirror.</em>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <em>‘Do you think your brother wants you in his shop with you acting like this?’ Theo spat, ‘Crying, like a fucking child? You’re an embarrassment, every fucking time you do this shit!’</em>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <em>Percy stayed silent.</em>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <em>‘Did you forget how to talk?’ Theo mocked, ‘What if Fred saw you like this, huh?’</em>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <em>‘Don’t. Please…’</em>
  </strong>
</p><p>Percy continued to his bedroom.</p><p>
  <strong>
    <em>‘Alex,’ Percy walked in Alex, sitting on the bed, some blonde bloke sucking him off.</em>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <em>‘Percy!’ Alex shouted as the other guy stood up and ran out of the room, ‘This isn’t what it looks like.’</em>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <em>‘Get the hell out of my flat,’ Percy demanded, tears filling his eyes.</em>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <em>‘Percy…’</em>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <em>‘OUT!’</em>
  </strong>
</p><p>He lied down on his bed and buried his face in his pillow. He wasn’t sure how long he stayed that way, reliving the memories of this place, when he heard someone start walking around the place.</p><p>“Percy?” Oliver called, “Are you in here?”</p><p>Percy didn’t answer. As if Oliver would go away if he didn’t get a response. He’d been sobbing, tears falling from his face as he tried to catch his breath. He heard Oliver enter the room.</p><p>“Percy,” Oliver repeated, “Percy, are you all right?”</p><p>He was faced away from Oliver.</p><p>“Do you think Fred would be ashamed of me?” Percy asked, “If he saw me like this?”</p><p>“No,” Oliver crawled onto the bed, “Will you look at me, Percy?”</p><p>Percy shook his head.</p><p>“Please?”</p><p>He rolled over to face Oliver, refusing to meet Oliver’s eyes.</p><p>“Fred would be proud of you,” Oliver said.</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>“Of course. He’d be right by your side, just like the rest of the Weasleys.”</p><p>“I shouldn’t have yelled at you,” Percy said.</p><p>“You were right,” Oliver said, “I shouldn’t try to force you express your feelings when you aren’t comfortable.”</p><p>“I’m sure you didn’t mean to tell Bill.”</p><p>“I really didn’t,” Oliver paused, “I suppose this is our first fight, huh?”</p><p>Percy nodded.</p><p>“I’d say you did well,” Oliver continued.</p><p>“By running off and crying like a fucking child?” Percy said, “Yeah, I did great.”</p><p>“You left instead of escalating the situation. That’s not childish.”</p><p>“It’s my fault,” Percy expressed, “These stupid attacks, they…It’s all my fault!”</p><p>“No. You still have PTSD from Fred’s death, and I’m sure Devon and Theo only served to add to your trauma. None of what they did to you was your fault.”</p><p>“You’re the only boyfriend who’s helped me through them. Everyone else just ignored me, or worse.”</p><p>“You don’t deserve to be beaten or berated for having a panic attack, regardless of what you may have been told.”</p><p>“This damn place makes it worse,” Percy explained, “When I apparate here, sometimes, the memories just…”</p><p>“Do you want to stay at my place?”</p><p>Percy hesitated.</p><p>“Just for the night,” Oliver assured him, “A change of scenery.”</p><p>“Don’t tell Bill and Charlie,” Percy requested, “They’ll think I’m moving in.”</p><p>“Okay,” Oliver agreed.</p><p>…</p><p>Ron and Hermione were at the Burrow for Sunday dinner the following week, as they had prior engagements on Monday.</p><p>‘Mysterious Man Seen Exiting Oliver Wood’s Flat Saturday Morning,’ the headline read.</p><p>“If I didn’t know any better, I’d say that bloke looks like…”</p><p>“Ron, put that down and help Mum with lunch,” Percy interrupted Ron.</p><p>The older Weasley went red when he saw the headline as Ron tossed the paper onto the kitchen counter.</p><p>“Something wrong?” Ron asked.</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Ron looked at the picture in the paper again, then back to Percy, his eyes widening with realization.</p><p>“That IS you, isn’t it?”</p><p>“What would I be doing at Oliver’s flat?” Percy dismissed.</p><p>“I’m not stupid, Percy,” Ron said, “I know you have a boyfriend you’ve been keeping from us, and I know you’ve fancied Oliver for a while.”</p><p>“Don’t tell anyone.”</p><p>“You’re dating Oliver Wood?” Ron exclaimed.</p><p>“Let the whole neighborhood hear, why don’t you?” Percy snapped, “And, yes. It’s been…a little over a month now.”</p><p>Percy noticed that his parents had entered the kitchen, along with Hermione.</p><p>“I’m sorry I haven’t told you yet, Mum,” he said, “I just wanted to make sure he and I were…serious.”</p><p>“You’re already moving in with him?” Ron asked.</p><p>“No,” Percy answered, “I…I can’t stay in my flat anymore. I just can’t take the memories.”</p><p>He went silent when Molly stepped forward and hugged him.</p><p>“I’ve always liked Oliver,” she said.</p><p>“We only want you to be safe and happy, Percy,” Arthur added.</p><p>“Ollie’s a good guy,” Ron said, “At least, I hope he is.”</p><p>“He is,” Percy said, “He really is. Incredible, actually. Extremely patient.”</p><p>“Good,” Ron said.</p><p>“You deserve someone like him, Percy,” Hermione added.</p><p>He wasn’t quite sure he did deserve Oliver.</p><p>…</p><p>“Do you think they saw the paper?” George heard Oliver ask from down one of the store’s aisles.</p><p>He didn’t think anything of Percy and Oliver visiting his shop at the same time that Wednesday.</p><p>“Stop it, Ollie,” Percy giggled. Since when does Percy giggle?</p><p>“Can’t help it,” Oliver teased, “You’re irresistible.”</p><p>George peaked down the aisle to find Oliver with his arms around Percy, kissing him on the neck. He loudly cleared his throat, causing the two to separate.</p><p>“George,” Percy began, “I…um…we…”</p><p>“I think this is one for the headlines,” George joked.</p><p>Percy looked embarrassed, while Oliver stared blankly at George. They all stayed silent until the younger brother spoke again.</p><p>“Finally asked each other out, huh?”</p><p>“We were going to tell you,” Percy said.</p><p>“After your little snogging session?” George joked, “I don’t think I’ve ever heard you giggle, Perce.”</p><p>“Stop embarrassing your brother,” Oliver said.</p><p>“It’s payback for him pretending he hasn’t had a boyfriend for the past couple weeks.”</p><p>“Month,” Percy said.</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>“We’ve been together a little over a month.”</p><p>“Month and a half,” Oliver corrected, “I asked you out on April second, remember?”</p><p>“Yeah,” Percy said fondly.</p><p>“You’d have a field day if you’d seen how badly I stumbled over myself,” Oliver told George.</p><p>“Come on, you weren’t that bad,” Percy defended.</p><p>“I very much was.”</p><p>George couldn’t remember when he’d seen Percy so happy with someone, even Penelope, who Percy later admitted helped him realize he was into men. George wasn’t too nice to Percy before the war, and only after Fred’s death did they become close. Still, he wanted Percy to be safe, to have someone who cared for him, not someone who would hit him in the middle of his brother’s shop or degrade him in front of his family.</p><p>“George, what’s the matter?” Percy asked.</p><p>George didn’t realize his eyes were swimming with tears.</p><p>“Nothing,” he answered, “I don’t think I’ve seen you this happy in a long time, Perce.”</p><p>“You’re a sap, you know that?” Percy sighed.</p><p>“So what?” George challenged, “My big brother’s happy, my friend is happy, so I’m happy.”</p><p>“Cheesy as hell, too,” Oliver joked.</p><p>Percy snickered.</p><p>…</p><p>Harry sprayed water out of his mouth when Percy told him and Ginny about Oliver.</p><p>“You bloody git!” Ginny exclaimed.</p><p>Despite her outburst, she was smiling. Meanwhile, Harry looked as if he was still processing the news.</p><p>“I’m having him over for Charlie’s welcome back party.”</p><p>Ginny stood and hugged Percy tightly.</p><p>“I’ve got some news to share, too,” she confessed.</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>“I’m pregnant.”</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>“Yep. Two months along. Mum’s gonna be so happy.”</p><p>“You haven’t told Mum and Dad yet?”</p><p>“I will when Charlie visits,” she said sheepishly.</p><p>…</p><p>
  <em>Two weeks later…</em>
</p><p>The Burrow was filled to the brim when Percy and Oliver arrived to welcome Charlie home. Molly and Arthur, Bill, Fleur and Victoire, George, Ron and Hermione, Harry and Ginny, and of course, Charlie, were already there.</p><p>“So, you’ve moved in together,” Charlie said.</p><p>“We haven’t moved in…” Percy began.</p><p>“No, of course not,” Charlie rolled his eyes, “You’ve only been staying at his flat for nearly a month.”</p><p>“Charlie…”</p><p>“I know. I got the letter you sent. I understand, Percy.”</p><p>The three joined everyone else in the crowded dining room, where Ginny was preparing to make an announcement.</p><p>“Harry and I are having a baby,” the red-faced Ginny spoke.</p><p>“You, too?” Ron blurted, causing Hermione to nudge him.</p><p>Everyone looked at him.</p><p>“I swear we didn’t plan this,” Ron exclaimed, “Hermione?”</p><p>“Ron and I are also having a baby.”</p><p>Molly looked ecstatic, as did Arthur, though less vocal.</p><p>“When are you due?” Molly asked Ginny.</p><p>“January,” Ginny answered.</p><p>“And you, Hermione?”</p><p>“November.”</p><p>Percy noticed George duck silently out of the kitchen and followed him.</p><p>“George,” he called.</p><p>The younger brother ignored him and continued toward the stairs until Percy grabbed his arm.</p><p>“What?” George demanded.</p><p>“Where’s Angie?”</p><p>“Why would she be…”</p><p>“There’s something going on between you two,” Percy said, “Whenever she comes over to the shop.”</p><p>“She was Fred’s girlfriend,” George said, “You’re not supposed to date your brother’s ex, especially not your DEAD brother’s ex.”</p><p>“Are you telling that to me or to yourself?”</p><p>“Fred loved her. They were going to get married.”</p><p>“That’s what everyone thinks about their first girlfriend,” Percy dismissed, “Boyfriend, in my case.”</p><p>“I never meant to…”</p><p>“Fall in love?” Percy finished, “Me either.”</p><p>“You…”</p><p>“Where is she?”</p><p>“Her flat.”</p><p>“Bring her by,” Percy said, “If she’s not busy.”</p><p>“Are you sure?”</p><p>“Absolutely. Mum would love to meet her.”</p><p>…</p><p>George returned with Angelina by his side a couple hours later. By then, most everyone had dispersed into the living room, while Percy and Oliver sat on the steps.</p><p>“Angie?” Oliver asked.</p><p>“Hello, Oliver,” Angelina said, “Percy.”</p><p>“Hi, Angie,” Percy said.</p><p>“You two mind if I talk to Percy for a moment?” George asked.</p><p>Oliver stood up, letting George sit next to Percy. Angelina and Oliver walked over to where the other Weasleys were crowded.</p><p>“So,” George began, “Didn’t mean to fall in love, huh?”</p><p>Percy sighed, yet didn’t answer.</p><p>“Oliver or Alex?”</p><p>“Alex, Devon, Theo,” Percy answered, “I fall in love with people who hurt me.”</p><p>“And, Oliver?”</p><p>“I’ve been in love with him since I was fifteen,” Percy admitted, “Not that it matters if he doesn’t love me back.”</p><p>“You don’t think he loves you?”</p><p>“He’s never said it. You know how many times Devon said he loved me?”</p><p>“That’s not the same.”</p><p>“I know. But, that’s all that word means to me now. An apology, a lie. I don’t know how I’d feel if it came from him.”</p><p>“Have you told him you love him?”</p><p>“I can’t.”</p><p>“Why not?”</p><p>“Good question,” Percy said, “I don’t know.”</p>
