    <p>I’m Raven, and yes, I’m an omega. If you haven’t already noticed. It’s rough, because my kind’s rare. Very. Rare. and everyone knows that, which is why, often, I’m hidden or alone. Because there’s people who will abuse my resources for bragging rights. You know what I mean. </p><p>Right now, I’m sitting on the train on the way to Hogwarts. And ‘terrified’ isn’t even beginning to describe my emotions on arriving to this new school. I was homeschooled for my first years, because my parents were scared of letting me have an education around others students. </p><p>Arriving to the castle, my breath was taken away. It’s- beautiful, to say the least. Absolutely gorgeous. I can’t even begin to express. Anyway, my parents got an owl with an assessment that would allow me to be placed in a house before I arrived to Hogwarts, and when we got the results back, my entire family was shocked. </p><p>Slytherin. </p><p>I was the last to leave the train, and as soon as I left the safety of the train car, a large, bearded man greeted me with a warm smile. His voice boomed as he spoke. “Well hello there! You the last one on?”</p><p>“I-I think so,” I stuttered. “I wanted to be the last one off.”</p><p>“Very polite of you,” The man grinned. “I’m Hagrid, I live in that hut just there by the wood’s edge. You ever need anythin’ or someone’s buggin’ ya just come tell me and I’ll sort ‘em out for ya, okay?”</p><p>“Mhm,” I returned his smile. Feeling safe for once in an unfamiliar place. “Thank you.”</p><p>“You’re welcome, now, best get in there, feast’s fixin’ to start.”</p><p>I walked inside the school, trying to look as confident as possible, but I wasn’t fooling anyone. I was terrified, you could see it in my eyes. As soon as I entered the Great Hall, I found the Slytherin table and sat at the very end of it, away from people, and remained quiet. </p><p>I let my eyes explore the large room, however, just so I could get aquainted with my surroundings. There was a table for every house, so, four. Gryffindor looked so happy, welcoming, and friendly. So did Hufflepuff, which held a lot of first years actually. Ravenclaw, at the opposite end of the room, looked equally as welcoming as Hufflepuff. </p><p>Then there was Slytherin. A lot of rich-looking students. Mostly older in age. They all looked like they knew each other and were tight knit, like some kind of rich family. Then there’s me. The new girl sitting at the edge of the table, as far as I could get away from people. A soft sigh left my lips but was sucked right back in suddenly when a pair of shockingly blue eyes seized mine from across the table, down near the front. </p><p>I studied the boy. Tall, thin, but didn’t look awkward in the slightest. There was just something about his aura that told me he was the boss. He was the man in charge. His snow-white hair complimented the green and black robes he wore. He’s Slytherin. Every part of him. </p><p>His gaze is- intimidating. I almost felt myself shrink in my seat, wanting to disappear from his view, but he looked away as Dumbledore approached the stand in the front of the room and spoke. </p><p>“Welcome to another magical year at Hogwarts everyone,” As soon as he said that, everyone cheered and he couldn’t help but smile. “Alright, quiet down. Quiet. Now, let me start explaining the rules for the first years and new students we’ve aqquired over the break.”</p><p>Dumbledore began explaining rules, but I wasn’t paying much attention. There was too much going on. I caught the eyes of a Gryffindor girl across the table and Gryffindor table. She was seated next to a red-haired boy, who was seated next to- Harry Potter. Everyone knows Harry. But I’m not gonna get into that story right now. Everyone knows it already. </p><p>Her beautiful brown eyes held the gaze of my green ones. She smiled warmly and waved a little. I smiled back, nervously, but she nodded a little and wrote something down on a piece of paper, and slipped it under her table, then mumbled a charm and it slid across the floor to under my table by my foot. </p><p>I picked up the paper and unfolded it under the table. It read: </p><p>“It’s nice to see another omega here finally. Hogwarts is scary right now, I know, but meet me after and we can go to Hagrid’s and talk.</p><p>-Hermione”</p><p>I looked up and smiled at her, genuinely, and nodded. She returned it and looked up at Dumbledore as he finished with the rules and announced the beginning of the feast as the food just magically appeared on the platters in front of everyone. I only had about two platters closest to me, and I wasn’t looking to move closer to anyone else. </p><p>So, I settled with the platters of chicken and rice in front of me. And was happy. </p><p>-0-</p><p>After the feast, and everyone had left the Great Hall to their houses, Hermione waited patiently for me at the entrance and I met her there. </p><p>“Hey, didn’t quite catch your name,” Hermione smiled.</p><p>“Raven,” I told her. “It- it’s a muggle name…”</p><p>“It’s beautiful,” She said and turned to the back exit of the school. “Alright, you wanna head to Hagrid’s? He’s really cool and sweet to the new omegas. If you haven’t already met him yet.”</p><p>“Yes, at the train, I was the last to get off and he was very warm to me.”</p><p>“That’s Hagrid for you,” Hermione smiled again. As did I. her smile is contagious. “This school is so big. Sometimes even I forget where I’m going.”</p><p>She escorted me to the hut by the woods, and knocked on the door. “Hagrid, it’s Hermione, and Raven.”</p><p>“Ah! Hermione!” Hagrid opened the door. “Nice to see you again! And the girl from the train! Hello!”</p><p>“Hi Hagrid,” I giggled. </p><p>“Come in!” He moved aside and weclomed us inside. We sat on a rather large couch and Hagrid sat on a rocking chair. </p><p>Despite Hagrid’s large size, his hut was small, but cozy. It had a beautiful fireplace with a boiling pot of something hanging over it. There was a small table, a chair, a sink and small counterspace, then the small living room and front door. That was pretty much it. And a large dog bed by Hagrid’s rocking chair that was currently being used by a large, snoring grey-blue mastiff. </p><p>“So, Hagrid, this is Raven. She’s a new student here and the second omega at Hogwarts.”</p><p>“Second?” I questioned, feeling more intimidated than before. “That- that’s not a lot.”</p><p>“Ah, nothin’ to be ‘fraid of,” Hagrid waved his large hand. “Hermione here’s an omega and she’s gotten her education just fine. Brightest witch at Hogwarts.”</p><p>“Thanks, Hagrid,” Hermione smiled. “But there’s more pressing matters at hand. She needs to know the basics of the hierarchy at Hogwarts. Well, more than the basics.”</p><p>“I know what you mean, Hermione,” Hagrid nodded. “We’ll start with the alphas, shall we?”</p><p>“A-alphas?” I choked out. </p><p>“Yes, there’s a lot of them here, which isn’t the best thing considering the fights due to their hormones, but we manage,” Hagrid explained. “Anywho, the one thing you omegas need’a watch out for is them alphas. Especially since you two are the only omegas here. Hermione ain’t got much to worry ‘bout. She’s already got one.”</p><p>“Yeah,” Hermione blushed. “Ron, the red-head boy I was sitting next to at the feast, Raven, if you didn’t see him.”</p><p>“I saw him,” I nodded. “What- what do I do about them? Am- am I supposed to have one?”</p><p>“Well,” Hagrid went pink a little. “It’s probably best to be close to one when that time comes ‘round.”</p><p>“Heat,” Hermione nodded, putting Hagrid’s words into english. “And he’s right. If you’ve ever had a heat on your own.”</p><p>“Yes,” I nodded sheepishly. “B-but how do I know who’s alpha and who’s not?”</p><p>“Merlin’s beard, you’re a green one,” Hagrid chuckled, as did Hermione and I. </p><p>“I was homeschooled,” I giggled. “Sorry.”</p><p>“Nothin’ to it,” Hagrid waved again. “It’s easy to spot an alpha. They walk ‘round here with their noses to the sky, robes without a crease, and they’ve almost always got a little posse with ‘em.”</p><p>Hermione chuckled at Hagrid’s biased description of an alpha, and patted my hand, grabbing my attention. “Alpha’s usually have a strong scent, stronger than the other guys. They see an omega and tend to stare a while to intimidate you, to study you, then they’ll look away like they’re not interested. And yes, like Hagrid said, they do tend to walk around the school on a high horse.”</p><p>“There’s two- levels- almost- of alphas,” Hermione continued. “There’s the basic ones, who have those qualities I explained before, and there’s the higher level ones.”</p><p>“The real cocky ones,” Hagrid commented with a laugh. “Never understood ‘em.”</p><p>“How do I know the difference?”</p><p>“Well,” Hermione started. “They’re real- protective and possessive over their mates. Like Ron, he’s a higher level. Rarely lets me alone with Harry. Who’s a basic alpha.”</p><p>“Do- do you know of any alphas who would like- t-take me in?” I asked quietly.</p><p>“Nothin’ to be ashamed of, girl, you can speak up a little. Everythin’ that’s spoken in my house stays,” Hagrid smiled. </p><p>“Well, there’s only one high level alpha in your house,” Hermione said. “And that’s Draco.”</p><p>“Ugh, ya don’t want Malfoy,” Hagrid grumbled.</p><p>“She can choose who she wants, Hagrid,” Hermione reminded him. “And Draco’s easy to spot, if you haven’t already. A tall, blonde character. He’s got a bit of an intense stare. He knows of all the females, so if you don’t know him yet he probably knows about you.”</p><p>“That’s not scary,” I mumbled and earned a laugh from Hermione and Hagrid. </p><p>“Exactly,” Hermione giggled. “But- he’s probably not your best option. Because- well- he has a reputation.”</p><p>“He’s got all the girls crawling all over him,” Hagrid grumbled again. “He’s got a new one every week. If he even keeps ‘em that long.”</p><p>“Yes,” Hermione agreed. “And I’d hate for you to get your heart broken by an unloyal alpha.”</p><p>“It’s happened before,” I frowned. “But I’m hoping to get a new start here.”</p><p>“Good, good, now, I have heard of other alphas here, but I don’t know too much about them because Ron rarely lets me near them.”</p><p>“So, what’s your opinion?” Hagrid asked. He and Hermione waiting to hear my words. </p><p>“I-I kinda want Malfoy…” I mumbled.</p><p>“What?” Hagrid coughed. “Y-You’re jokin’.”</p><p>“Raven,” Hermione looked into my eyes. “A-are you sure?”</p><p>“Yes, I caught his stare earlier at the table.”</p><p>“It’s too late,” Hagrid told Hermione. “She’s already been hooked.”</p><p>“I see that,” Hermione slightly scowled back at Hagrid, then looked to me warmly. “If that’s who you want, maybe an omega in Draco’s life will end his reputation.”</p><p>“How do I get to him?”</p><p>“Easy,” Hagrid snickered. “Show some interest.”</p>
