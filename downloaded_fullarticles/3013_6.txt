    <p>"And if you think I'm nasty, wait until you get to the Kitchens and meet Pitts..."</p><p>Those were the words Filch said before Elena started walking down the stairs. She looked behind one last tine to see the faces of Penny, Bill, Merula and Madam Rakepick before turning back and walking down to the kitchens. Filch followed her to make sure she didn't escape.</p><p>As Elena finally got to the entrance to the kitchens, she noticed the entire place seemed to be gone. Not locked. The entire place was just replaced with a green void, getting bigger all the time. Before she knew it, she was entirely surrounded by it. Filch was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>"Welcome to House Pride!" a strange voice said. "Do you have what it takes to earn more house points than the opponent? For the next five days, you shall attend as many classes as you can, with the intend of earning as many points as possible. May the best team win!"</p><p>Elena looked around. She saw nine other Slytherins. None of them looked familiar to her. Maybe they were new first-years or other students of different years she had rarely seen. It was hard to tell how old they were. They all had the same expression, and were staring in the same direction.</p><p>Elena turned around to look at what the others were looking at, and it was a wall with information on the event.</p><p>"Slytherin - 0, Hufflepuff - 0"</p><p>These were the total standings at the moment, which was not surprising, as the event had just started. Below the house point standings, a reward was shown. The members of the winning team would receive 30 Galleons each, while the losing team would receive 10 Knuts each. There were also individual rewards, based on individual success. The highest prize required earning 200 house points. Elena was a good house point earner, but even to her, earning 200 house points in just five days was impossible.</p><p>"I expect you to do your best," the strange voice said. "Go to your classes and do everything you can to make sure you are number one."</p><p>A door opened in the void, and suddenly, Elena found herself in a Care of Magical Creatures class.</p><p>"Wait, isn't it Saturday?" Elena wondered to herself.</p><p>"Alright class, time to learn more about Fire Crabs!" Professor Kettleburn said. Elena was getting a feeling of déjà vu. Didn't this happen in her fourth year? She wasn't entitely sure.</p>
