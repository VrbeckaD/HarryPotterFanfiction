    <p>Prologue:</p><p> </p><p>“Agreeing?” Loki chuckled lowly, a wicked, evil grin stretching his thin lips. “When you are not even ready to give me the Casket of Ancient Winters? What you propose is no peace treaty! It is drudgery!”</p><p>“Loki, my son,” Odin said, his voice deep and calm, but there was a hint of strain when one listened closely enough.</p><p>Loki just sneered. “Do not call me your son! You have no right!”</p><p>“I have no right?” bellowed Odin. “I took you in. I raised and loved you as my own!”</p><p>“You took me in for nothing but your political gain! Like those peace hostages, you so like to claim!” Loki shouted back, making Odin sigh.<br/>“If that were the case, Loki, I would have sent you to the quarters of the peace hostages and not raised you within my family. Do you truly believe I took you only in for my political gain? I was still young! Still new as king! Still new as a father! But I took you in, raising two toddlers simultaneously!”</p><p> </p><p>Loki just sneered, refusing to listen to his so-called father. He was too angry, too desperate and he knew if he listened, the old, childish love he still held for his adoptive family would rise again and betray him when he had more important things to concentrate on. </p><p> </p><p>“And despite all your words, you refuse to give me the Casket of Ancient Winters! Instead, you pushed me into this attack! This betrayal!” He spat.</p><p>“I pushed you into nothing!” Oding stated, making him laugh. It was a cold, bitter sound, filled with no happiness.</p><p>“Did you not? For centuries, even millennia I tried to talk to you about the issue, but you refused to listen to reason!”</p><p>Odin shook his head. “You do not listen, son. I did listen to you, but I cannot give the casket to you!”</p><p> </p><p>Snorting, Loki questioned: “And what, dear father, is the oh so important difference between those two things?”<br/>“That it is destroyed!” Odin roared suddenly. “I destroyed the casket in the midst of the battle before your birth father gave you to me!” The word echoed through the Throne Room like his brother’s mighty roll of thunder, leaving nothing but an oppressing silence. </p><p> </p><p>The marble floor beneath Loki’s feet seemed to crumble and let him fall into the baseless dark void of the universe. </p><p>“Then you did not only betray me but also my birth father!” Loki whispered as the anger and desperation coiled like an angry snake in his stomach, making him shout: “He trusted you!”</p><p> </p><p>Odin closed his eyes for a second that seemed to last an eternity and if Loki had not known better, he would have said that the great Allfather was wavering.</p><p> </p><p>“I will not deny that my actions back then were not without mistakes. But Laufey was a desperate mother. He was desperate for your life. For your survival. It was wrong to not tell him the truth, but there is no doubt in my mind that he still would have entrusted you to me if he had known.”</p><p> </p><p>“So you took me in so that I could watch the extinction of my people? Not even giving me the respect of telling me about their fate?” Loki asked coldly, still falling.</p><p> </p><p>“I…” Odin began anew, but then there was it again and this time, there was no mistaking it for what it was. Odin, his powerful father wavered and stumbled. Next to him Frigga gasped, grasping him for support and his brother Thor, who had been ordered to stay guard at the entrance portal, rushed forwards. </p><p> </p><p>But he wasn’t fast enough and neither was Loki as the ground suddenly returned beneath his feet and he sprinted forwards as Odin stumbled again, falling to the floor. </p><p> </p><p>“Guards!” Loki shouted loudly, not for the first time glad that his mind always stayed sharp and quick, regardless of the situation. “Sent for Eir! Quick!” he ordered as soon as the heavy portal was pushed open and the guards entered. </p><p> </p><p>For a split second their eyes rested on the crumpled form of the Allfather, but then they ran, years of following orders in the extremest of situations helping them to follow orders in the direst of situations. Their heavy boots echoed loudly on the marble floor as they vanished.</p><p> </p><p>As he turned his attention back to his father, he saw that his mother had carefully cradled his head in her lap.</p><p> </p><p>“He mentioned that he feared his second sleep was approaching. But we never thought… that it would befall him so soon,” she said weakly, stoking her dainty fingers through his dark golden hair. </p><p> </p><p>Loki did not know what to retort, his silver tongue leaving him for the first time in his life. He wasn’t even sure if he was allowed closer by their side. His brother seemed as lost as he himself was, for the first time confronted with a situation he was not familiar with; a situation in which his strength and battle prowess were of no use. </p><p> </p><p>Fortunately soon the moment came to an end as a group of healers arrived.</p><p> </p><p>“My Queen.” <br/>It was a respectful greeting as well as a question.</p><p> </p><p>“It is the Odinsleep,” Frigga responded, her voice low but steady. “Bring him to his golden Chamber,” she ordered and waited for her husband to be lifted onto a stretcher, before rising as well. </p><p> </p><p>Loki watched from the distance how the man he considered a father was carried out of the throne room. He felt detached from the situation as well as his family. It was a feeling he was not unfamiliar with. With his long, straight horns, crimson eyes, dislike for the suns and love for shades and cool caves he had always felt as if he did not quite belong, despite the care and love he had received, even from Odin himself. </p><p> </p><p>But the last couple of centuries had cast a shadow over their familial bliss. Odin had always been a king first and a husband and father second. He was calculating and ruthless but in his youth, he had not been aware of the fact as much as he was today.</p><p> </p><p>“Loki,” he heard his mother’s voice and looked up. Thor had already hurried after the healers, properly sitting by their father’s side and holding his hand as a proper and favoured son should. <br/>“Yes, mother?” He acknowledged her, his voice sounding hollow to his own ears. </p><p> </p><p>“Despite what you may think right now, you are our son. Do not stay away from him. You father can still hear and see in his sleep.”</p><p> </p><p>He inclined his head. “I thank thee, mother,” he retorted politely, despite knowing that he would not do so.</p><p> </p><p>Chapter 1:</p><p>Harry groaned as his mind came back to awareness. His whole body hurt. So much so, that for a moment it made him unable to remember what had happened. But then images of meaty fists, of heavy booted feet, blood, and pain flooded his mind and he wished he had forgotten after all. </p><p> </p><p>His uncle's kicks had been more violent and relentlessly than ever before. He could remember a ripping pain in his chest and for a moment he had been convinced that he was about to die. What a joke that would have been; killed by his uncle. Killed by a mere muggle</p><p> </p><p>Not that he would have been overly sad with how horrible his life had become. </p><p>It all really had started after the horrible end of his fourth year. He could understand the necessity of him learning Occlumancy, but Snape had been a horrible choice. Sometimes after the sessions, especially when a painful vision had followed, he had felt himself slip into madness. To this day he found it rather miraculous that he had not gone completely insane yet.</p><p>On top of that, the Ministry had sent him Umbridge who had blessed him with yet another scar that would never vanish. </p><p>And last but not least, there had been the incident during his xxx class, Animagus training. It had been during his very first lesson with his Head of House when they had noticed that he had quite the special gift.</p><p> </p><p>A shapeshifter, a wizard who was even rarer than a metamorphmagus. Someone, who could not only turn into any human, animal, creature and being alike, change their appearance and gender but also his final form.</p><p> </p><p>Upon birth, every shapeshifter was born as son or daughter to their parents, looking like a normal child would. Many of them stayed in this form, choosing it as their final one, but others chose to turn into something entirely different for a friend, a lover or sometimes even a career purpose. </p><p> </p><p>All in all, Harry had thought he could have had a much more freakish inheritance, seeing what kind of creatures roamed the wizarding world. That was until Dumbledore thought to use him to bind the alliance of the vampires to the light side, by giving Harry to their Lord as a mate.</p><p> </p><p>Harry had not wanted to become a blood craving, undead person and neither had he liked the idea to be married off to someone he did not know and was likely to not like as well, considering the nature of vampires.</p><p> </p><p>Fortunately, this discovery had only happened rather late in the school year and with Umbridge and Dumbledore’s flight from Hogwarts, nothing had happened yet. </p><p> </p><p>However, Harry was sure that the manipulative, old headmaster would not leave it be. So much he had realized after the end of his fifth year; Dumbledore was not the wise and kind grandfather he liked to present himself as. </p><p> </p><p>No, the man was cunning and manipulative like a Slytherin and did not shy away from using the people in his surroundings to achieve his goals. </p><p> </p><p>Though right now things were still very chaotic in the wizarding world, so Harry was sure he would yet have some time until he needed to come up with a plan to avoid the cruel addition to his fate Dumbledore had forged. </p><p> </p><p>And that Dumbledore would try everything in his power to marry him off to the Vampire Lord, he did not doubt.</p><p> </p><p>Only the question was, what could he do while locked in at the Dursleys’ house with no way to contact his friends? Or his… A pang of sorrow went through his heart as he remembered that his godfather was no more. And that as well was Dumbledore’s fault. </p><p> </p><p>But dwelling in the past would not help him right now. He could mourn Sirius later, he knew his godfather, wherever he was right now, would understand. He would even support him in his decision to first make a plan to get himself out of this mess and then greive. But what to do? He had set Hedwig free at Kings Cross so that his family could not starve her as well and even if she was there, his windows were barred again. </p><p> </p><p>But maybe she was close and watching him. Maybe he should try to write a letter and place it somewhere outside, in hopes that she would find it? Hedwig was an unusual bird after all. </p><p>However, to do so he would have to get up and on with his day. The thought alone made gag as his head still pulsed violently. Still, he braced himself and finally opened his eyes. Only to immediately shut them again as bright light assaulted them as if the sun was directly shining down on him. </p><p> </p><p>Groaning, he let his right arm fall over his face to shield his sensitive eyes. He must have suffered a concussion, otherwise, he couldn’t explain this oversensitivity while lying in his dingy room. </p><p> </p><p>He blinked carefully so that his eyes could slowly accustomed to the brightness. Once they finally had done so, he tiredly let his arm drop to the side again, only to gasp in shock. Wherever he was, it was not his bedroom. </p><p> </p><p>A bright blue sky stretched above him and (he rubbed at his eyes, not quite trusting them) multiple suns. A surge of panic went through him and he sat up quickly. The motion made him feel dizzy, however, as quick as both sensations had come, they had disappeared again. </p><p> </p><p>For a moment he wondered why he suddenly felt calm again, but as his head stopped spinning and he could take his surroundings further in, it came to him. </p><p> </p><p>Whoever had brought him to this place, could not possibly one of the Death Eaters. He was unbound and unrestrained. The grass he was lying on was slick and soft and of the brightest green, he had ever seen.</p><p> </p><p>He seemed to be in some sort of courtyard as the high marble pillars of a gigantic building rose around him. Looking around further, he could see a small pond nearby, a bench and a beautiful, mosaic pathway.</p><p> </p><p>Low chatting reached his ears from somewhere and all in all the atmosphere was calm. Peaceful, even. </p><p> </p><p>For a moment he just sat there, wondering what he was supposed to do and how he had even gotten to this strange place. Had he maybe died after all and was in heaven? Was this how the world behind the veil looked like?</p><p> </p><p>Looking down on himself, he noticed that, while his body still ached, that there were no visible injuries. No bruises, no slashes from his uncle’s belt. </p><p> </p><p>Suddenly the sound of heavy footsteps echoed through the courtyard and as he turned his head, he saw two men walk by beneath the roofed pathway beneath the pillars.</p><p> </p><p>Harry’s eyes widened as they came closer and he could truly see them. They were tall, muscled men to the point of being bulky. They wore a strange, silvery armor and the sides of their helmets were formed like feathers. In their hand they held spears and heavy swords hung on their belts. </p><p> </p><p>Fortunately, they hadn’t noticed him yet, absorbed in their conversation as they were and also, this proved it, he had not been captured by Voldemort. He watched as they slowly went out of sight and chewed nervously on his bottom lip. </p><p> </p><p>He knew it probably was a foolish idea to run after them, but he had to find out where exactly he was, if he was truly dead or if he could return to his friends. The thought of his friends sent another jolt of pain through his chest. What if he truly had died? While not really sorry for the fate that would befall Dumbledore, he wasn’t quite sure how he felt about his friends. </p><p> </p><p>Ron and Hermione had been by his side for so long, but especially Ron had also shown him a dark, oblivious side and treated him unfairly. And even if he could forget about that, was it truly right that they expected him to save their hides? He had tried often in the past year to make them see that the wizarding world was wrong to place all their hopes on his shoulders. He was only a teenage boy after all. </p><p> </p><p>Even if it turned out to be true that only he could defeat Voldemort in the end, that didn’t mean that they couldn’t at least try to weaken the wizard and his allies.</p><p> </p><p>Shaking his head, he pushed the question out of his mind for now. These questions were unimportant for as long as he didn’t know what had happened to him. Therefore he made up his mind, pushed to his feet, waited a moment until the spinning and pounding of his head had retreated once more and then began to search for the two guards he had seen earlier.</p><p> </p><p>Once he stepped into the shade beneath the marble building, he saw their brown capes vanish behind the next corner. </p><p>Gathering all his Gryffindor courage he cleared his head and called out to them: “Excuse me!”<br/>Their steps halted, only to start anew and a second later they came back into view.<br/>“Yes, what…” one of them started politely, but then his hard, brown eyes landed on him and Harry realized that this had been a stupid idea. </p><p> </p><p>“Who are you?” The other guard asked harshly and both of them quickened their steps, moving their speers to point straight at him. </p><p> </p><p>“I…” Harry began, lifting his hands in the universal sign of peace and took a step back. However, either those two didn’t know the gesture or didn’t care for it, because they grabbed his arm harshly and scrutinized him. He winced as his arm was squeezed and most likely bruised beneath their strong grasp.</p><p> </p><p>“You are no Aesir!” The first one accused him. <br/>“No, I am not. I am…” Harry began, not knowing what or who Aesirs were, but the second guard cut him off. <br/>“Intruders are not welcomed here.”<br/>“I am not…” he tried again, but the first guard gave him a harsh shuff. “Move. Odin Allfather will decide upon your fate,” he declared and Harry paled. </p><p> </p><p>Odin Allfather? Like the Nordic ruler over all the gods of the universe? He dearly hoped that he had misunderstood. However, he wasn’t given the chance to ask any question as the two guards marched him further into the great building, past beautifully sculptured pillars and archways, over long stretching bridges and through high, lacquered doors. </p><p>He saw more guards than he could possibly count and they certainly were not all human. However, before he could take a closer look at them, they stopped in front of a gigantic portal that was flanked by six guards, three at each side. </p><p> </p><p>“We need to speak to the Allfather!” the guard on his left announced to his comrades. One of them gave a stiff nod and the one closest to the door brought something like a thick, golden and heavily ornamented staff loudly down to the floor. The sound echoed through the hallway and a moment later the portal began to swing open.</p><p> </p><p>Harry gulped as he saw the first glances of the hall that was revealed. The ceiling seemed to be so high, that he couldn’t see its roof from where he stood. Golden swirls were embedded into the white marble on the floor, reminding him of Celtic knots.</p><p>Then one of his guards pushed him forwards, forcing him further into the room. </p><p>It was impossible to not immediately notice the two tall figures, sitting regally on two thrones, one smaller, the other bigger. Their golden blond hair, warmer and more shining than that of the Malfoys, reflected the bright sunlight that streamed through the high, arched windows. </p><p> </p><p>The woman, although smaller and much more delicate than the man, seemed just as imposing with her elegant, golden dress and the long hair that spilled down the side of the throne. </p><p> </p><p>“Odin Allfather, we found this spy in one of the inner courtyards,” one of the guards spoke, both of them bowing respectfully, their weapon never wavering away from him. </p><p> </p><p>“A spy, you say?” the man on the throne repeated, and Harry flinched as he turned his head to face him, revealing a harsh locking, metal patch over one eye, while the other one gazed at him with a hardness Harry had never felt before.</p><p> </p><p>“Tell me boy, which realm was foolish enough to send a child into the midst of my palace? Did your king think that I would spare his servant if he had not grown into his armor yet?”</p><p> </p><p>For a moment Harry was unable to do anything but to stare at the Allfather, hoping that he would just wake up from this crazy dream and find himself in his little room in Privat Drive. The aura of the king in front of him was so intense, that it seemed to crush him.</p><p> </p><p>“Answer, boy!” the Allfather bellowed, making him jerk from his paralyzed state. <br/>Finding something the Gryffindor inside of him he had thought lost only a moment ago, he straightened. “I am no spy!” He had dealt with enough madmen, he would not cower in front of one who was certainly strong, but at least sane enough to speak to. </p><p> </p><p>“Where you are from, I asked you!” the Allfather repeated, his voice gaining a threatening undertone. </p><p>Deciding that it could only help his case to answer that question for the king first, he said loudly: “I am from Surrey in Britain.”</p><p> </p><p>The Allfather frowned. “I have never heard of the realm you proclaim to be from.”</p><p>Frowning as well, Harry shook his head, at least the Allfather sounded slightly calmer now. “Britain… or England... is the country. The planet,” he hesitated, hoping that he was guessing correctly what the Allfather wanted to hear “is the Earth.”</p><p> </p><p>“Ah, Midgard,” Odin hummed, seeming deep in thoughts for a moment. <br/>Harry didn’t dare to move or speak, having the feeling that his fate was decided upon, however, when the Allfather looked calculatingly up again, he was asked another question.</p><p>“I was not aware that Midgard’s technology had advanced enough to find us. However, if they were aiming for a civil peace or trade agreement, an official request by letter or messenger would have been the right approach. So tell me, what is your mission here? Are you to find out how strong we are? How many men we possess? Steal our weapons? Or something even more sinister?”</p><p>Harry paled at the Allfather’s words. Where in Merlin’s name did those people even get the idea from that he was a spy? Or here to do such horrible things? Did criminals in this realm usually look like scrawny, underfed schoolboys? </p><p>However, Odin spoke again. “I will tell you now that my sons and heirs are all strong warriors. An attempt to abduct them will bear no fruit.”</p><p> </p><p>Shaking his head again, he repeated: “I am really no spy. I am not interested in weapons or fighting!” <br/>It was the truth. The war in the wizarding world had just barely begun and he already had enough of it. What would he want with starting a war in another universe? With a god nonetheless. </p><p> </p><p>“Is that so?” Odin questioned, his voice cold and rose from his throne. <br/>Harry stiffened as he saw how tall the man exactly was. He had always thought that Ron was tall, with his 6.0, but the Allfather had to be at least 6.6 feet tall.</p><p>To his horror, the god began to walk down the steps, his heavy booted feet and the golden sceptre echoing on the floor. </p><p> </p><p>“Then tell me why, Midgardian, have my guards found you in the heart of my palace? If not on behalf of your ruler, how did you get to Asgard then? You did not arrive with the Bifrost, for he is not open currently.”</p><p> </p><p>“I… I don’t know!” he exclaimed, craning his neck to look into the god’s eye, but his stare was so intense that Harry had to lower his gaze a second later, unable to stand it. </p><p>“Impudence!” Odin shouted, bringing his sceptre heavily down in front of him. It sent a shockwave of energy through Harry’s body, that made the pain in his head flare up harshly.</p><p> </p><p>“Do you think me a fool? No one enters my palace without a reason, especially not secretly! I have ruled the nine realms for more millennia than you can possibly imagine! I know every lie and every trick! Do not try to fool me or you and your Midgard shall pay dearly for your insolence!” </p><p> </p><p>“I am… not… lying!” Harry forced out between gasps of pain and dizziness. </p><p>“Allfather!” he suddenly heard a soft, but equally commanding voice. <br/>“Frigga,” he heard the Allfather’s voice, but it seemed to come from far away. It sounded softer, gentle even.</p><p> </p><p>“Please restrain yourself, my husband,” the woman spoke again. “He is but a child.”</p><p> </p><p>Soft steps sounded and a moment later a warm hand fell onto his shoulder. <br/>“He is ill and bleeding. Whatever fate has brought him to us, I believe it is no wickedness.” <br/>Suddenly a gentle energy seemed to flood through him and the pain in his head and limbs subsided. A white, delicately embroidered handkerchief was pressed into his hand and he realized his nose had been bleeding. </p><p> </p><p>Wiping the mess away, he looked up and directly into the gentle, brown eyes of the regal queen. She smiled at him softly, understandingly and directed him over to the steps of the platform where the thrones stood. To his surprise, she set him down and then took the seat next to him. </p><p> </p><p>“Now, child, I am Queen Frigga. Would you tell me your name?” she asked softly, her warm voice calming something deep inside of Harry.<br/>“My name is Harry.”</p><p> </p><p>The queen gave him another smile and nodded. “Welcome to Asgard, Harry. Can you remember the last thing that has happened before you arrived here?”</p><p> </p><p>Harry pondered the question for a moment. He didn’t know how he had gotten to Asgard and didn’t wish to go into too much detail about the beating he could remember. But thinking about all what had happened today and how he felt, he could say at least one thing: “I think I died.”</p><p> </p><p>A sad expression entered Queen Frigga’s eyes. However, she did not pity him and that made Harry like her all the more.  “And then you awoke in our garden?”<br/>“Yes.”</p><p>Frigga was silent for a moment and just as with Odin, Harry didn’t dare to speak up. Finally, she rose and turned to her husband who stood silently watching to the side,</p><p> </p><p>“Allfather,” she began respectfully. “I would propose to consult the Norns.”</p><p> </p><p>Odin’s single eye wandered over to him, examining him for a minute, before he gave a single nod, before turning to the guards that had brought him here. <br/>“The Midgardian shall be placed into a room and given food and drink. He is not to leave this room until you have word from me and he is to be guarded day and night!” The Allfather brought his sceptre down. </p><p> </p><p>The guards straightened even further if that was possible and then motioned for Harry to follow them.</p><p> </p><p>The walk that followed was long and silent once more, but at least this time, his guards didn’t emit an aura of anger. They let him deep into the bowels of the castle. Still, regardless of how far away they went away from the throne room, the splendor around him did not lessen. </p><p> </p><p>Finally, his guards turned into a dead-end corridor that was lined with comparatively simple doors. The only remarkable thing about them was the golden door handles. </p><p> </p><p>The guard on his right pushed the nearest door open and gestured for him to enter. Apparently, talking was not his strong suit.<br/>As soon as he had done so, he heard the door fall shut behind him, however, he didn’t care about it at the moment, relieved that he had made it out of the throne room in one piece. </p><p> </p><p>Meeting Odin and Frigga had been wondrous and frightening at the same time and left him slightly shaken. He had always told people that there were more frightening things than a mad dark lord and had always believed it, but the meeting had taught him the true meaning behind his own words.<br/>Trying to distract himself from the uncomfortable feelings, he finally took in the room. It wasn’t big, but nicely furnished, and certainly more than he could have expected from the death eaters, or even the Ministry at the moment.</p><p> </p><p>The furniture was made from light wood. There was a bed in one corner, a small sofa, an armchair, and a low coffee table. A window looked down into another garden and a bookshelf stood next to it. It was mostly empty, holding only one single tome.</p><p> </p><p>Right now it didn’t matter to him, however, as he had much to think about and was dead tired. Hesitating only a moment, he walked over to the comfortable looking bed, kicked his trainers off and lay down. </p><p> </p><p>He could think about what his new situation meant once he was rested. Right now he couldn’t do anything anyway and he was too exhausted to think about it reasonably as well.</p><p> </p><p>Sleep claimed him almost immediately with how tired he was and the softness of the pillow beneath his head.</p><p> </p><p>XXX</p><p> </p><p>When Harry woke next, he couldn’t say how long he had slept or how late it was. The suns in the sky seemed to have sunk quite a bit, but he still felt exhausted. Awake enough, however, to finally address some things. </p><p> </p><p>Turning onto his back, he sighed and stared at the ceiling. His thoughts immediately wandered back home, to Ron and Hermione and his unwanted duty. He knew right now he had no possibility to do anything at all, but he also knew that he should try to return to the Earth and Britain as soon as possible. If it was possible. If he wasn’t truly dead. </p><p> </p><p>However, if he was honest with himself, he also knew that he didn’t truly wish to return, for there was no one anymore he wanted to save. It wasn’t even really about his friends. They had disappointed him, sure, but they also were all still young and allowed to make mistakes. All in all, in the end, they had always stood by his side. No, blaming them would not be right. </p><p> </p><p>No, it was about the situation in general. He had been unhappy for so long. Had hurt and suffered for so long. And this was his chance to get away from all of it. To live his own life for the first time since his parents had died, to find out what he truly wanted to do and who he truly was. </p><p> </p><p>Of course, in the end, it all would depend on the Allfather and his good will. If the god could not be convinced that he was no enemy, his fate would be sealed for sure. But right now, at this moment, he felt calm about the matter. </p><p> </p><p>And even if he wanted to, he doubted very much that Odin would let him return to the Earth after what he had all seen today, even though it had not been something truly important.</p><p> </p><p>But could he truly do that? Just stay in Asgard and say nothing? Tell nobody about his past life and past destiny and start anew? </p><p> </p><p>Sadly, coming to a decision wasn’t hard at all. Not with what Dumbledore had planned for him and with his godfather dead. Sure, he probably would have to give up magic, the one thing he had always liked about his life, but then again, it had also been the reason why his life had been as bad as it had been. Maybe it would even be a relief to leave his powers behind. And for the rest, he would just have to wait and see how things would develop. However, it felt better to face these things with a clear and made up mind. At least he knew what he wanted to get out of this newest adventure. </p><p> </p><p>By now the light in his room had dimmed quite a bit and he turned onto his side and closed his eyes again. </p><p> </p><p>For the first time in about two years, his mind felt finally completely calm again and he easily drifted off again. </p><p> </p><p>TBC</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>TBC</p>
