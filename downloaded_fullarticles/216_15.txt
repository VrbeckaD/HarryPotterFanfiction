    <p>Sound came first; the first sense he noticed returned that had returned. Rustling like grass in the wind all around him. A stream burbling nearby. The wind itself howling through some trees, barely loud enough to be heard. A small animal moving around in the branches. Something hitting some rocks somewhere. An owl hooting. A snake hissing.</p>
<p>An owl hooting? A snake hissing?</p>
<p>
  <em>§Wake up! Wake up! Wake! Up!§</em>
</p>
<p>The words finally registered, the hissing transforming into true speech. He groaned quietly, twisting up onto his side and coughing harshly. He felt something bubble out of his mouth and groaned again.</p>
<p>
  <em>§Good, you’re awake. Now open your eyes~.§</em>
</p>
<p><em>§No.§</em> He groaned, bringing his legs up against his chest.</p>
<p>
  <em>§Yes~! Your feather dus~ter is frantic. You’re worrying her.§</em>
</p>
<p><em>§Feather—?§ </em>He moaned softly as he opened his eyes, blearily staring into the green in front of him.</p>
<p><em>&lt;&lt;Thank Arianrhod. Harry Potter, you turn over this instant!&gt;&gt;</em> The voice seemed to coincide with an increased hooting from behind him.</p>
<p>“Hedwig?” Harry Potter, or at least, the being called Harry Potter, murmured as he rolled his head to look at where the voices were coming from.</p>
<p>And there she was, snowy white and black stippled feathers gleaming in the early morning light. Sitting on his trunk, Hedwig and a long black snake curled up next to her watched him. Gold and blue eyes stared at him as their beings moved closer to the edge of the trunk, peering down over the edge at him.</p>
<p><em>&lt;&lt;How are you feeling, Harry-chick?&gt;&gt;</em> Hedwig hopped in place as she asked her question, the snake shifting away at the gust of air from her wings.</p>
<p>“I feel like I’ve been hit by a lorry,” Harry replied with a groan as he rolled over onto his other side, so he could see them without pulling at his aches and pains. “What happened?”</p>
<p><em>&lt;&lt;I suspected so.&gt;&gt;</em> Hedwig bobbed for a moment before asking her own question, <em>&lt;&lt;What do you remember?&gt;&gt;</em></p>
<p>“Remember?” Harry blinked at the question before searching his memory. “I was at the top of the stairs with the laundry… It smelled horrible. The basket was full of Dudley and Uncle Vernon’s socks for the most part. Aunt Petunia’s blue and white polka dot dress was on top. She’d screamed something about not ruining it when she sent me upstairs… I’d just stepped down… I don’t… There was a noise behind me. I don’t remember… Something hit me! Something hit me across the back of the head, and then I fell and then… nothing. I don’t remember what happened after that.”</p>
<p><em>&lt;&lt;I will be blunt, Harry-chick.&gt;&gt; </em>Hedwig puffed her feathers as she rested down on her feet, leaning close.</p>
<p>"Okay?"</p>
<p><em>&lt;&lt;The Dursleys killed you.&gt;&gt;</em> She said it quickly, like ripping off a bandage or as if she didn’t want him to hear.</p>
<p>"Killed me?!" Harry practically shrieked before he began to hyperventilate. "Killed me? How am I here then? What happened?"</p>
<p>
  <em>&lt;&lt;I suspect that your magic kept you in an almost stasis that kept you alive but dead appearing, but only the short ones would know for sure...&gt;&gt;</em>
</p>
<p>Harry had to take several breaths before he could speak, and quietly he did after a moment, almost too quiet for the two animals to hear. "So I should go to the Goblins then? And find out for sure?"</p>
<p><em>§The Gold-keepers~ would know bes~t.§</em> The snake gave its input in a soft tone, most likely inferring the conversation topic from the half of the conversation it could hear as Harry didn't expect that the snake could understand Hedwig.</p>
<p>"How would I get there though? I can't fly, and I don't want anyone to know I'm here... They'd take me back to the Dursleys." Harry sat up with another groan, fighting to push himself up onto his knees. As he pushed himself up onto his knees he changed forms.</p>
<p>Hedwig hadn't wanted to alarm him, so had left it out but before he'd sat up and propped himself up on the trunk, he'd been a featureless being, much like the mannequins she'd seen on her fly-abouts through London. It wasn't something she'd ever heard of from any of the older owls or at the school, so she'd rather have the little ones tell her human what had happened to him.</p>
<p>When he propped himself up on the trunk, he'd gone from that featureless being to what he usually looked like, with a few exceptions. From the collar of his too big shirt, a splash of ink had appeared across his skin, and as the two animals watched, more spread out along his limbs but slowly enough that Harry didn’t seem to notice. His skin had darkened, but at the moment it would be easy to write it off as simply getting enough sun.</p>
<p><em>&lt;&lt;Get dressed in something appropriate, and then we’ll figure out how you can get there.&gt;&gt;</em> Hedwig bobbed again, tapping the snake with her wing. She hopped before picking up the snake and dropping it off the trunk, landing down next to it.</p>
<p>Harry nodded sharply, shuffling closer to the trunk before opening it. Inside the trunk, a mess but not much more than had been there at the end of the school year before he’d taken the time to sort it, so obviously the Dursleys had simply thrown everything they’d taken away inside. He sighed quietly, carefully making sure that nothing had broken before digging for a clean uniform to wear.</p>
<p>It took a bit for him to get changed, his entire body still sore, like he’d been doing one of Oliver Wood’s all-day practices. Thankful for button ups, Harry pulled the last of his clothes on, buttoning up the front.</p>
<p>Changed, Harry threw the old clothes into the trunk, figuring he could throw them away later. In no world, if he had the ability to do otherwise, did he want to keep anything of Dudley’s—especially the blood covered items—unless it had another purpose other than being anywhere near his body. Surely, he thought as he pulled his wand—which oddly left the tingly feeling of that popping candy along the palm of his hand as he moved it from inside his trunk to the small pocket sewn along the length of his thigh especially for the purpose of holding his wand—that there had to be something he could use the old items for.</p>
<p>He sighed quietly, resting against the reclosed trunk. He turned to face the two animals, leaning back against the solid oak as he studied them.</p>
<p><em>§What s~hould I call you?§ </em>He questioned suddenly, looking at his scaled companion in the realization that he had no idea what to call it.</p>
<p><em>§My bearer<b> </b></em><em>named me Aura.§</em> The snake replied, and he noticed the softer almost feminine tone to the snake’s voice. As she spoke, dozens of her scales slowly changed from black to all the colors of the rainbow, making her look like the rainbow of gasoline on new pavement in the sunlight. That and the blue of her eyes made her a very striking animal.</p>
<p><em>§Pleas~ed to meet you, Aura.§</em> Harry murmured, reaching out to pet her head. He then changed to English to ask both his companions, “Now how are we—I assume you both are coming?” When they nodded, or at least made noises of agreement, he continued, “How are we getting to Diagon Alley?”</p>
<p>
  <em>&lt;&lt;How much money do you have left?&gt;&gt;</em>
</p>
<p>Harry got up to his knees again to dig his money bag from inside his trunk. He pulled the bag open before looking inside. “I have three galleons, ten sickles, and six knuts.”</p>
<p>
  <em>§That’s~ enough to take the Bus~.§</em>
</p>
<p>“What bus?” Harry asked, looking at Aura.</p>
<p>
  <em>&lt;&lt;OO! I forgot about that.&gt;&gt;</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>§There is~ a magical bus~, called the Daye Bus~ or the Knight Bus~, if you’re taking it at night, that comes~ when you call.§</em>
</p>
<p>“How do you call it?”</p>
<p>
  <em>&lt;&lt;You have to hold your hand out with your wand, like you’re calling a taxi, and it will appear.&gt;&gt;</em>
</p>
<p>“I can’t go as myself… Someone would make me go back to the Dursleys as soon as we entered Diagon Alley.” He frowned as he tugged lightly at the cuffs of his shirt.</p>
<p>
  <em>&lt;&lt;What about your invisibility cloak?&gt;&gt;</em>
</p>
<p>“I’d be invisible though,” Harry pointed out, not understanding what she meant.</p>
<p>
  <em>&lt;&lt;What about wearing it the other way?&gt;&gt;</em>
</p>
<p>“I’ve never tried it that way,” Harry admitted before turning and digging back through the trunk for his most valuable possession. He carefully pulled it out, silver cloth dripping out like liquid onto the grass as he set it down, so he could close the trunk again. He petted it lightly before flipping it over, the dove gray of the inside turned outwards. He shakily removed the hood he’d found from the pouch in the collar before wrapping it around himself.</p>
<p>
  <em>&lt;&lt;So?&gt;&gt;</em>
</p>
<p>“I can see out! It’s like I have nothing on at all,” He answered, drawing the hood down to grin at them.</p>
<p><em>§Are you feeling s~trong enough to get up and call the bus~?§</em> Aura questioned, shifting slightly.</p>
<p>“I think so. I’ll have to try. And I really hope that no one notices…” Harry murmured as he pulled his legs under him. He pushed himself up onto his feet, taking it slow and leaning on his trunk to keep his balance. He looked like a newborn colt attempting to get to his feet, all too long for their body limbs and weak muscles, but he did get to his feet eventually.</p>
<p><em>&lt;&lt;I won’t be coming on the bus. I’m much too noticeable and I don’t think I’d enjoy the ride, but I’ll meet you at Gringotts.&gt;&gt;</em> Hedwig flapped her wings before tucking them back against her body.</p>
<p>“That’s fine, Heddy. Aura and I can make it on our own. We’ll be okay.” He gave the Snowy Owl a grin before resting against his trunk. He made sure that he had his money bag and his wand, before shrinking his trunk via the tiny runes Percy had carved on the corner of the lid. “Shall we?” He held out his hand to Aura, watching as she curled herself up around his arm before slipping under the collar of his cloak to settle around his neck.</p>
<p>Hedwig clicked her beak at him before taking off. <em>&lt;&lt;I’ll see you soon, Harry-chick.&gt;&gt;</em></p>
<p>“Bye, Heddy,” Harry told her, waving to her as she circled them. She flew in close and bopped their heads together before circling away and taking off into the sky. He watched her leave, the sun glinting off her white and black stippled feathers as she flew off into the horizon. He took a deep breath, pulling the hood of the cloak up over his head.</p>
<p><em>§Are you alright, Aura?§ </em>He questioned quietly.</p>
<p>
  <em>§I’m fine. I’ve s~ettled so we can go. Remember, jus~t like you were s~ummoning a taxi.§</em>
</p>
<p>Harry nodded his head. He took a deep breath before grabbing his things in one hand and with the other he thrust out his wand to the sky.</p>
