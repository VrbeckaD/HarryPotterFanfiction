    <p>
  <span>Felix took the last of his boxes up to his apartment. His car (a used 2004 Honda that he’d bought) finally empty of all of his possessions, which, considering what his old room looked like, were painfully meager. His assigned roommate was nowhere to be found, and that was honestly fine by him. Maybe they would have dropped out, and he would have an entire flat to himself for the year. He needed the privacy, anyways. Unlocking his door, he was greeted with the smell of dust, and decided to keep his door open to air it out a little more while he dragged his boxes across the wood flooring. His guard, would have scolded him for leaving himself so exposed, but that was then, and this was his new life.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The apartment was small, the front door opened to the kitchen on the right hand side. Past that was the living room, which was equipped with a small TV, a couch, and two chairs, and led onto a small balcony that gave him a nice view of the campus. On one side of the living room were doors that led to the bedrooms of him and his supposed roommate. He had already chosen the left-hand room to be his own. It came with a mattress, so Felix only needed to bring sheets to fit, blankets, and pillows.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The first thing he did in his bedroom was pin his maps up onto the cork bulletin board he’d bought. His special maps, the one that showed a tiny island by Iceland, and a map of the island itself. The sun shone through the windowpane while he allowed himself to think of his father’s private gardens, of balls and estates and horseback riding lessons.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Home, </span>
  </em>
  <span>he thought. Then he looked back at his boxes, remembered that he was not at home, and closed the front door. He slid the lock closed too, for good measure.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Within the next hour, he was unpacked and the cardboard was tidied up, ready to be recycled when the truck came the next morning. Whether this was a testament to his cleanliness, or proof that he was alone without much to begin with was an entirely different story. No pictures of his family could be set out, of course, in case he wasn’t safe. But it still hurt, having to sit here and attend college and pretend to be a regular twenty-three year old while there were disputes back at home. Ever since he’d left, he’d found it near impossible to sleep.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>His stomach grumbled, shaking him out of his stupor.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ah, right. He had to eat. That was something that normal people did. He had to learn to feed himself. To cook, and whatever. That was something that normal people did, too.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He’d seen a Starbucks on campus while he drove toward the university’s apartment complexes, perhaps it was time to find it again. He’d get lunch there, and then drive to the nearest supermarket that Google Maps could locate.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He needed to fill the fridge and pantry, anyways.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>At Starbucks, he made a fake Facebook account, and put in a few old pictures of books and coffee that might help him blend in. Then, he got in the car and went to the store.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Cereal, bread, tea, vegetable sticks, deli meat and instant coffee. Looks like what a college kid would purchase. Am I being too obvious? Oh! I almost forgot! Instant noodle packets and processed cheese. And energy drinks. Of course. Just like what any other college kid might buy, because I’m a normal college kid.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Felix had to refrain from snorting when the cashier offered a sympathetic smile and asked “student loans haven’t come in yet?” when she rang him up. He shrugged instead.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Just doing what I can.” He replied, and that was the truth.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He set his groceries in the trunk and just sat for a moment in the driver’s seat, letting the reality of the situation wash over him, as he was wont to do lately. He was Prince Felix Rosier, third in line to the throne of Églaït. It wasn’t like money was an issue. He was just sent here for his own safety, to keep him safe from the extremists who were instigating terror attacks in his home country. He just had to pose as a university student who actually cared about getting a combined History and French Literature degree, for as long as it took for the trouble to be sorted out.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He was sitting, in his car, with the doors unlocked. An easy target for any kidnapping or assassination attempt. Rubbing his palms over his eyes a few times, he took shaky breaths and started the car.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The first thing he noticed upon stepping into his apartment was that it smelled like food. The next thing he noticed was that he wasn’t alone.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Two girls were sharing the couch, sharing a bag of potato chips and drinking beers. One of them, a short blonde, called out.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oi, Chester, looks like your roommate’s here!” She stood up, heading in Felix’s direction.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The other, a brunette with her hair pulled into pigtails, gave Felix a once-over.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He’s just standing in the doorway, not sure of what he’s supposed to do!” She called, before addressing Felix directly. “You can come in, you know. We don’t bite.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I wasn’t aware I had more than one roommate.” Felix said, as he carried his plastic bags in. The blonde snorted.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, you wish, don’tcha? My name’s Jane. Let me help you with those.” Felix handed her one of the bags, and she peeked in before laughing a full, loud laugh.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey Chester! You’re not the hopeless roomie after all!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The other door in the living room opened, and someone around Felix’s age stepped out. He figured this was Chester. Brown hair, brown eyes, a blue t-shirt and jeans.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, hey! I saw that you’d moved in already, so I called my friends over to help me unpack. Hope you don’t mind?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Felix shook his head. “No, not at all. I- Maybe I could be introduced to all of you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Chester fixed him with a funny squint. “Introduced? I mean, I’m Chester Davies, the one with a laugh like a dying hyena is Jane Court, and the one who’s currently making her way through my beer stash is Angelica Cole. That good for you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Felix nodded, stiffly. Chester looked at Jane.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why’d you say I’m not the hopeless roommate, again?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jane shoved the shopping bag into Chester’s arms. As he pulled out Felix’s instant noodles, his eyes widened in understanding. He smiled at Felix. “Ah. You broke the bank before the first day, huh?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Felix was about to counter with a denial, but he just grinned sheepishly. “I- I don’t do the shopping in my house. I honestly didn’t even know what to get.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No worries!” Chester said, smiling. “Come over, sit on the couch with Angelica! We’re just waiting for the lasagna to finish, and you will for sure join us for supper! No excuses!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Felix looked uncertainly at the oven, which was lit and seemed to have a tray in it. “You mean to tell me that that oven cooks food?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jane laughed again. “Yeah, surprised that it works, right? It was that or the microwave, and Costco’s gotta push their line of frozen dinners one way or another, don’t they?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Felix nodded, moving to the couch. Angelica stood up and extended her hand.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey, handsome.” she said with a wink. Felix felt his face flush.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You don't need to feel special.” Jane interjected. “She says that to everybody she meets. That is, except for any cute girls that she might actually want to talk to.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Angelica shot Jane a glare. “ Janey, why do you always spoil my fun?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Because I think that's fun, Angie.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Felix felt something ice cold press into his shoulder. Turning his head, he saw Chester holding a beer can to his green polo shirt. “Here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No thanks.” Felix said, politely.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Chester sighed, dramatically. “C’mon, relax! I’ve been assigned to first years as roommates for the past three years! You're not a firstie, so I finally don't have to worry about being a bad influence.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don't usually drink-” Felix started, mind flashing to champagne and wine, to how buckwild he had gotten at Will and Kate’s wedding reception.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, you'll make an exception for us, won't you Felix?” Angelica insisted, taking a drink from her own can. “It’s our first time meeting you, we've gotta celebrate it, right?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Felix took the can from Chester with a quiet thanks and opened it, Angelica whooping and Jane welcoming him to the party. He wasn't big on cheap college beer, it tasted absolutely disgusting compared to what he was raised on. But he had to pose as a student, so a few sips while he waited with Chester and his friends for supper wouldn't hurt.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They ate, salad and lasagna, and Felix learned a lot about the three of them. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Angelica was majoring in pre-med, although she got in on a sports scholarship.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I've seen She’s The Man enough times to quote the whole movie by memory. Viola was my inspiration to join the sports teams at school, and I fell in love with tennis.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jane was a sociology major, although she wanted to get into law school in the future.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Look. The prison system is the worst. I can't believe it took us this long to abolish the death penalty!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And Chester?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I'm an ecology major, but I'm doing a history minor.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh?” Felix asked. “I'm a history major.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nice.” Said Chester, grinning. “If we’re in the same class, would you want to sit together?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Felix nodded in agreement.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Later, Felix wiped the coffee table they had eaten dinner on while Chester loaded the dishwasher. Once done, Angelica put some pop music on her phone and dragged Chester to the living room.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Dance with me!” She demanded, grabbing Chester by both hands and starting to swing her body to some silent beat. Chester adjusted quickly, the two of them falling into practiced steps as soon as Angelica’s rhythm had been set.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She always gets like this after drinks and dinner.” Jane said to Felix, moving him to the couch to watch the fun. “No worries though. It's usually pretty harmless.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She does it often?” Felix asked, raising an eyebrow at Angelica’s antics.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah. They grew up together. Neighbours, you know? I only met them when I started here. They're the closest friends I know. They'd quite literally die for each other.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Huh. You don’t say?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jane nodded. “By the way, don't mean to pry, but why do you have a closet full of button downs and polo shirts?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Felix froze. “My mai-maman shopped for me before I left home. Said I had to dress to impress. Guess I should have just told her that everyone here wears hoodies and sweatpants, huh?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jane chuckled. “Sure. Why do you have two full suits in your closet, though? And why are your pyjamas all so soft? You’d think you sleep in silk, for God’s sake.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why were you snooping about?” Felix asked, putting his hand to his chin. “Trying to find any skeletons in my closet, Jane? How can I trust you if you’re so nosy?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jane shoves at his shoulder, stronger than Felix had anticipated. “Please. I did it when we were helping Chester move in, when we didn't know if you had moved in already. You weren't in your room, and your stuff was already there, but by then Angelica had already opened your closet.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Felix nodded. “And of course, you interrogate me on my mother’s idea of good taste.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Naturally.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Anything else you’ve got to say?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re real minimalist. You’ve barely got anything up in your room.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s the way I like it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“A place for everything and everything in its place? How exciting.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Chester lets go of Angelica and grabs Angelica’s phone off the couch. He changes the song to music with a grating, scratching sound, and fast paced piano and violin in the background. With hands making grabbing motions, he reaches for Jane, who whoops, runs into his arms, and starts a fast-paced step sequence with him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s Country Line Dancing.” Angelica tells him. “Jane’s from the middle of the country, where there’s farms, trucks, and poor wifi. She grew up going to church every Sunday, riding horses and driving tractors after school.” She pauses, as Chester and Jane enter a complicated pattern with spins and steps, still holding hands. “That move is called the octopus. It’s her favourite move, the one that reminds her most of home. When Chester and I first met Jane, she was shy and lonely. It was really hard to reach out to her, even though we had some first year options together. Chester asked her what she missed most about home, and when she told him she missed the dancing, he learned how to line dance, just to make her feel a little more welcome. In just one night, Jane was friendly to all of us, and she was less lonely. He taught me how to dance too, of course, but it still blows me away that he’d do something that kind, to a stranger who we otherwise would have left alone.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Felix nods.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Looks fun, doesn’t it?” She asks, eyes gleaming.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t dance, if that’s what you’re implying.” He replies, flatly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s what everyone says, but I still manage to convince them to!” Angelica replies, grabbing onto his arm, tugging at it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Angelica...” Felix says, as a warning.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t be ridiculous! Just one dance! I’ll just teach you how to do the octopus, and then you can go to bed, if you want to.” She gives his arm another tug, and Felix can feel his resolve crumble.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Felix nods, and allows himself to be led through the basic steps by Angelica. It’s challenging, but he enjoys it quite a bit.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>One dance later, Felix doesn’t want to leave.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Two dances later, he wants to teach Angelica how to waltz properly while Chester shotguns beers over the sink with Jane.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How is it that you’ve never learned how to waltz?” He asks, as Angelica steps on his sock again. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How is it that you only know partner social dances that are based in Europe?” She replies, eyebrow raised.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Was my French accent not obvious?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, I thought ‘bout it, but I also doubt that they teach the Waltz, especially not the difference between the Waltz and the Viennese Waltz. You go to some fancy dance school for fancy folk?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Felix shook his head. “Not a dance school. My father just wanted to make sure I was well prepared for any situation.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So he taught you how to Tango, Foxtrot, Cha-Cha, and Waltz, without ever introducing you to North American Line Dancing?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Felix wrinkled his nose. “I’ll tell you again, the Cadillac Ranch is not a dance that I even knew existed until you mentioned it to me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Jane will teach you that one, once she’s had her fun.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I will!” Jane calls, from the kitchen. “I’ll teach you the Cadillac Ranch once you’re done teaching Angie how to waltz!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And she does. Felix drinks another can of beer, before Jane drags him to the open space between the kitchen and the living room, and she teaches him how to step, when to swat his foot, and when to clap.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They sit down and watch Queer Eye on Angelica’s Netflix account, and after that, they step out onto the balcony. Felix knows that this is an issue of personal safety, but he doesn’t really care. He’s having a great time.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Today was a great day.” Chester says, leaning against the doorframe. “Tomorrow will be even better.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you always say that?” Felix asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course I do! I tell it to myself every night before I go to sleep, and it always comes true.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course it does.” Felix says.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Today was pre-perfect.” Jane announces, with a hiccup.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Did you almost say prefect instead of perfect?” Felix asks.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jane responds with a light shove.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’re prefect!” Angelica giggles, mocking Jane’s verbal slip.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hell yeah we are,” Chester says, pulling his phone out. “C’mon. Selfie!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Felix hesitates, but gets in the picture, grinning ear to ear.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>W</span>
  <span>hen he checks his Facebook that night, after Angelica and Jane have left for their own dorm, he’s in a groupchat.</span>
