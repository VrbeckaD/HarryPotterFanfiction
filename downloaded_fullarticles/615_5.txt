    <p>
Sitting on the edge of the shore, my feet splashing in the lake. Fish jumped up and down and I laughed as one sprayed me with water. The cold was refreshing since it was late summer, the end of September. The Great Lake frightened people, the unknown beneath the surface, the creatures hiding that no person would ever see. But, if you had grown up next to it for seven years, waking up to seeing mermaids and small sharks next to your window, then the lake was just another place wizards had yet to explore. 
</p><p>
The mermaids enchanted me and learning sign language to communicate with them was one of the quickest things I have learned. I longed to know their secrets and because of some bored kid who had patience and smarts, we now could. My brother along with our friends learnt the language to keep the tradition alive. It’s been an ongoing rumour if the mermaids can be communicated with, so far everyone thinks its false and we’re not going to tell them if it is or not. 
</p><p>
Rays of light blind me and I sigh. Once the sun begins to set is when I know it’s time to go. I don’t want to be caught out at night. I wave goodbye to the fish and trudge up the hill to Hogwarts, hoping to find my brother on the way. Students immediately make a path for me, not wanting to talk to a Slytherin like me. We made an impression on them and I sometimes feel like it was the wrong one. 
</p><p>
Because of this, we are probably the closest house but we had no allies except for a few Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws and now after the war, we have no one. The Gryffindors haven’t tried to become friends with us and I don’t blame them. It annoys me because I’m not evil or mean and neither is my brother or our friends. We just had to wear a mask to satisfy our parents and act like the children they wanted us to be, cruel with no emotions and with no imperfections. 
</p><p>
As I walk past, scattered Slytherins, younger students, latch to my side. Slytherins now have to walk in groups of no less than three people unless you actually want to get beaten up by someone. Me and my brother, though, are usually the ones picked on most but being the eldest we have more safety because no one hits someone in front of a younger student. This makes us magnets to other Slytherins who need protection. My brother lets only a few others join him on his strolls but I don’t mind if there is a crowd around me, as long as everyone is safe. 
</p><p>
In reality, my brother would be the same if he wasn’t scared someone would report him to our parents. He’s fine in the Slytherin common room because everyone else is going through something similar but outside, he has some enemies that wouldn’t mind going through the extra effort to send a letter to our parents. Even after the war, my parents still think they are right, especially father but I think our mother will change soon. And now with the whole new 8th-year common room, my brother doesn’t really have anywhere where he can be himself.
</p><p>
I have never been the main concern of our parents before. Of course, they wanted me to behave and get good grades but if I chatted with a Hufflepuff, I would get a warning. But if my brother did, he would get letters and letters and maybe a howler and once we got home, he might even get a beating, depends on how serious my brother acted out. I know that my brother sometimes took whippings for me and it frightens me. They did this because he was the heir to both the Black and the Malfoy and I was female while he was male, the Malfoy line will continue on his end while mine it would not. 
</p><p>
I stop thinking about that and as I gaze up, a head of platinum blonde hair, almost identical to mine except mine is darker, catches my eye so I jog to catch up with him, “Hey Dray, where are you heading to?” 
</p><p>
He turns his head to me and a large black eye stares back at me and I wince, “Oh. Weasley again?”
</p><p>
Draco rolls his eyes, “Do you really think I would start a fight with them after the war? No, it was some Ravenclaw who blames me for their uncle dying. Couldn’t even put up a fight because if I did, I would be expelled.”
</p><p>
I give him a side hug, “Because they knew you would win if they didn’t threaten you with expulsion.”
</p><p>
“And that.” A smug look on his face as he probably recalls fights in the past he won. 
</p><p>
We stroll up to the 8th year common room together, the other Slytherins leave us to make their way to the dungeons. We make a few jokes here and there until we reach the painting. I’m about to say the password ‘lemon tarts’ when it swings open and Potter, Weasley and Granger exit. I’m not exactly sure why I use their last names because I never really spoke to them. I once asked Granger for help with a Transfiguration essay because no one else was around and she glared at me away so maybe that's why. 
</p><p>
“Malfoy.” Weasley sneers, already angry with us though we haven’t even looked at them.
</p><p>
Draco nods, “Good afternoon Weasley, Granger,” He glances at Potter, “Potter.”
</p><p>
Potter peers up at Draco and his eyes widen as he looks at the nasty black eye, “What happened, Malfoy?”
</p><p>
Draco looks down his nose at him, “That’s none of your business, Potter.”
</p><p>
Weasley glares and is about to challenge Draco when Granger sees me holding the painting open and says, “Only 8th years are allowed in there.”
</p><p>
I roll my eyes, “Thanks for that random information.”
</p><p>
Weasley scoffs, “She means you can’t go in, Slytherin.”
</p><p>
My eyes widen, not sure how he knew my house when I remember that our new robes have all the Hogwarts houses on them but the inside is your house colour. Slytherin green is already bright so you can easily tell who’s Slytherin. No hiding here. Draco catches my pause so he speaks up for me, his voice clear.
</p><p>
“She’s an 8th year Weasley, can’t you see that she has all the houses on her robe, unlike the younger years,” Draco points at the little picture on my robes.
</p><p>
Potter raises his eyebrows, “Oh, did you transfer here? I’ve never seen you around.”
</p><p>
I snicker, “Of course you wouldn’t notice me. I just so happened to be in your Potions class and Charms class for seven years.” 
</p><p>
The trio blush but Granger recovers quickly, “So, what’s your name?”
</p><p>
I peek a bit at Draco and he shrugs, which means I can tell them my full name, “I’m Cassiopeia Malfoy.” 
</p><p>
“Malfoy? You’re related?” Weasley makes a disgusted face when I nod. 
</p><p>
“Are you like cousins?” Potter questions but I grasp Draco’s arm, “Well, look at the time. Let's go Draco.” 
</p><p>
Granger goes to say something but Draco steps in behind me and I slam the portrait. I sigh and Draco gives me a pat on the shoulder. Not the first time we were questioned about our relation or the first time I was questioned about what year I am in. I still haven’t lost my baby fat on my cheeks so I look younger than I should. Most people would dye to look younger but I only look immature. 
</p><p>
I see Blaise, Pansy, Theo and Daphne sitting in a corner at a table, hiding away from everyone else but not like they had a choice. Everyone else has filled the couches and sofas since it’s Saturday. I turn to glance at Draco but hiss as the bright light from the windows that enters my eyes. I will never get used to having so much light in the common room. The Slytherin dormitories are underneath the lake so we didn’t get much natural light.  
</p><p>
We wave at them and the two of us sat down next to the other four. Pansy looks up from her book and gasps as she sees Draco, “Oh my goodness, what happened to you?! I swear I’m going to find them and hunt them down and-”
</p><p>
Blaise rests a hand on her shoulder, “Slow down there Pans, we should probably treat Draco’s eye first. Plus, it’s not like this is the first time this has happened.”
</p><p>
Pansy sighs and gives Draco a kiss on his forehead like I remember mother used to do when we were kids. Daphne smiles kindly and waves us off, pointing at Theo who is deep into his book and then at her own book which she has almost finished. We understand that she and Theo are going to stay there until they’re done so we trudge up the stairs to Draco’s shared room with Blaise and Theo. 
</p><p>
I hadn’t told Draco this but I had heard a rumour that someone heard the teachers discussing putting Potter and Draco in the same room but Severus’s portrait had swung by and pointed out that the two had been through a lot and didn’t need the other annoying them. Headmistress McGonagall and Dumbledore had argued against that but in the end, they sided with Severus. I couldn’t imagine what Draco would have done if that happened.
</p><p>
The door opens and I step in and immediately laugh at Draco’s side of the room compared to the others. Theo has his all neat except he has books and quills everywhere, Blaise’s is all tidy and Draco has his bed made nicely but his clothes are thrown everywhere and it's all a mess. Draco glared at me while the Pansy also judges his side and Blaise gets out the emergency kit from out of the bathroom. 
</p><p>
I take out some cloth and Pansy hands me a cooling pack. I wrap the cloth around it and Blaise sets a cooling charm on it and I pass it over to Draco. He presses it against his eye and he cringes at the cold and the pressure against his bruise. I give my brother a side hug which he leans into. Underneath all his emotionless masks, my brother just wants love and is a big sap. The other two join us and we sit on the bed like this for a while until Daphne and Theo turn up along with Millicent, Greg and Vincent. We welcome them in and we sit in a large circle. 
</p><p>
Vincent sees Draco and his face is red with fury, “Who did that to you?!”
</p><p>
Draco rolls his eyes, grimacing, “Some student maybe in 6th year.”
</p><p>
Greg holds up his fist, “I will definitely beat that kid up.” 
</p><p>
Millicent lifts her own hand, “Someone is about to get slapped.”
</p><p>
“Don't,” I say, “we can’t attract attention to ourselves.”
</p><p>
The rest nod, Draco adding, “Plus, this happens all the time, I don’t care anymore.”
</p><p>
Vincent raises his hands above his head in outrage, “That makes it even worse!”
</p><p>
Greg shakes his head and stops Vincent from going any further. He turns and smiles at Draco, “Well, we’re here for you mate.”
</p><p>
“And my offer still stands.” Millicent grins at him, holding her hand up. 
</p><p>
Draco grins and then Pansy beams up, “I’ve got an idea!” 
</p><p>
Blaise and Theo groan but Daphne brightens up, “Alright then, share it.”
</p><p>
She leans in real close and whispers, “Truth or dare.”
</p><p>
Boos echo across the room and Pansy crosses her arms over her chest and huffs, “Well, if you’re going to rudely veto my idea, then what other ideas do you have?”
</p><p>
“We can play spin the bottle?” Millie asks innocently. 
</p><p>
I almost barfed on the floor, “Not if we want a repeat of last year.”
</p><p>
Everyone shivers at that and we try and think of more ideas. Daphne speaks up, “What about Never Have I Ever?” 
</p><p>
Draco laughs, “Well that’s stupid because we already know everything about each other.”
</p><p>
I nodded, “It would be better with more people.”
</p><p>
“What, more Slytherins?” Pansy asks.
</p><p>
“No,” I shake my head, “like other houses.”
</p><p>
Theo ponders, “Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws are out because I don’t think they would want to play with us. Ravenclaws don’t seem like the party type and neither do the Hufflepuffs. Which leaves… the Gryffindors.”
</p><p>
“Yeah, no,” Blaise says. 
</p><p>
I shrug, “They would be more fun than the other houses.”
</p><p>
“One flaw though, they hate us.” Draco points out. 
</p><p>
We all sigh, only in a perfect world would Gryffindors and Slytherins like each other. Pansy won out of all the others for game ideas so Truth or Dare it is. Pansy is the first to go because she thought of the game. She grins and rubs her hands together, grinning evilly, “Ok, Cass, truth or dare?”
</p><p>
I gulp. This could go two ways: if I said Truth, she would make me spill about my not so secret crush on this girl in Gryffindor which I don’t want to talk about to her and if I said Dare, it would probably have to do with her or some stupid dare that results in me going out. I decide the second one is better because Draco would always help me if it was something I didn’t want to do. “Dare.”
</p><p>
She smirks and I know I’ve chosen the wrong one, “I dare you to sneak up to the Astronomy tower and kidnap an owl.”
</p><p>
“What!” I yell in outrage, “The owls will notice me and start making noise and I’ll get caught.”
</p><p>
Theo rolls his eyes, “Not if you stun the owl and then carry it back.”
</p><p>
Draco shrugs, “That is like the stupidest solution to that problem but whatever.”
</p><p>
Greg pats my shoulder, “Just do it, if you leave a bunch of treats after the kidnap, it won’t mind, hopefully,” He looks over at Vincent, “Do owls have anything against us Slytherins?” Vincent shrugs and we all roll our eyes, most owls don’t care but there are some that are picky. I’ll just have to pick the right one.
</p><p>
I sigh in defeat and pick my wand off the nightstand, tucking it into my robes. I push myself off the floor and I am about to leave when Draco grasps my wrist, “Wait, I’m coming with you.”
</p><p>
I was puzzled but Draco continued, “You will need a lookout. We’re Slytherins, if you get in trouble, that’s detention for you for the rest of the year. I’ll come so you’re not by yourself.”
</p><p>
I glance at Pansy to make sure that’s allowed and she nods, huffing, knowing Draco’s logic is correct. Draco and I smile at each other, our hands intertwined together as we exit. I can spot some treats stuck in one of Draco’s pockets but I don’t ask when he got them. We make sure to tread lightly but it’s not something new to us, we did live in a house with Death Eaters for two years. 
</p><p>
There are a few 8th years in the common room but we go unnoticed, no one cares about us or what we do anyway. I push the painting open and the two of us step out. The stairway is lit up with a few lanterns but not bright enough for people to see us. We stride down the stairs in silence, skipping any of the purposely squeaky stair steps that alert teacher or students of you going down. The hallways are deserted at this time, only one or two students out who are either prefects or have detention. Our blonde hair stood out but one quick glance at the green on our ropes made people immediately look the other way. It was a curse and a blessing.
</p><p>
We reached the area where the owls were and I survey the owls. Draco stands guard at the entrance as I ponder, which one? I could be boring and pick one of our friend’s owls like the sandy yellow owl named Sierra was Susan Bones’ owl but I feel like Pansy would be disappointed if I went all this way to not have some fun. So, I slowly creep up to a white snowy owl and hold my arm out. Surprisingly, it flies up and lands on it but I quickly stun it and catch it in my arms.
</p><p>
“Got one,” I tell Draco and his eyes widen.
</p><p>
His voice shakes as he points at the owl, “Put the owl back.”
</p><p>
My head tilts, “Why?”
</p><p>
“That’s Potter’s owl,” He says and I gasp. I fumble for my wand but before I can cast the reversal spell, I hear footsteps going up the steps and a loud meow echoes throughout the tower. 
</p><p>
Bright red eyes appear at the top of the stairs and a hiss escapes the cat’s mouth. I immediately recognize the cat, Mrs Norris, as makes her way towards us. She hissed at me, obviously not over the incident in her first year. I tried to feed her cat treat but they were bird pellets and she got sick for weeks. Now she hated me which is why I never went on any of Draco’s adventures because she was out for my blood. Luckily no one ever retraced the bird pellets back to me so Flinch didn’t seem to think the hatred his cat felt for me was more than a coincidence.
</p><p>
I could hear Flinch’s voice down on the stairs, all mumbled, but both Draco and I could tell it was him. We shared a look before Draco was beckoning me towards the back stairs. I shimmied over to him, trying not to make any noise and as I reached the stairs, I didn’t care anymore and just ran at full speed down the stairs, Draco following behind me. It wasn’t until I reached the bottom that I realised the owl was still tucked underneath my arm. 
</p><p>
“Shoot!” I yelled, almost dropping the owl in my arm. 
</p><p>
My brother tries to shush me but it’s too late, Flinch must have heard our footsteps going down the back stairs because Mrs Norris was at our feet, Flinch coming down the stairs. My face flushes and I hide the owl behind my back as Flinch stalks over to us.
</p><p>
He glances at us, “Well, well, well, who do we have here. The Malfoy twins. Thought you would know not to get into trouble after the war happened. Let’s see what Dumbledore has to say, hm?” 
</p><p>
The walk to the headmaster’s office is longer than I remembered probably because of embarrassment and feeling like she is back in first year, getting dragged by Flinch to Dumbledore. They pass a few students who all had hall passes and prefects, all of them smirking at us as we passed with Flinch, obviously happy that the Slytherin’s got caught. 
</p><p>
We finally reach the golden phoenix and Flinch mutters, “Sugar pops.”
</p><p>
The bird turns and allows us to enter. I drag my feet inside as Flinch grabs my brother’s arm and opens the headmaster's door, shoving us both into the doorway. I’m staring at my feet now, not wanting to meet Dumbledore’s eyes but a different voice reaches my ears.
</p><p>
“Malfoy?” 
</p><p>
It’s Potter, of course, and I just had to be holding a stunned owl that happened to be Potter’s owl. He doesn’t see it because it’s still behind my back but I can feel my hands get all sweaty. 
</p><p>
Flinch speaks, “I caught these two in the Astronomy Tower, doing what I don’t know.” 
</p><p>
Dumbledore dismisses him and he leaves after that while Dumbledore smiles at us, making my hair stand up, “Mr and Ms Malfoy, please sit down,” I sneak a look at Draco who just motions for me to sit down, telling me it’s safe to. Dumbledore passes a bowl to me and Draco, “Lemon drop?” 
</p><p>
I shake my head along with Draco. I nervously shuffle in my seat, Potter sitting on the other end with Draco on the armchair. It seems now that Draco notices the owl next to me that I’m trying to hide behind my body. 
</p><p>
“Well, I was just talking to Mr Potter about how the 8th year common room is going. Now-” Dumbledore is interrupted by Potter, staring at the owl that is half covered by my back. 
</p><p>
“Is that my owl?” At Potter’s voice, the owl shifts and Draco mutters a reverse spell underneath his breath, a wandless one which I never was good at. The owl flies over to Potter, hooting, “Hedwig! Why do you have my owl?”
</p><p>
Draco goes to answer but I beat him to it, the words spilling out of my mouth before I could stop, “We got dared to go to the Astronomy Tower and steal an owl and your owl just liked me so I stunned it but then Flinch came and I forgot about your owl and yeah.”
</p><p>
Potter glared but Dumbledore just clapped his hands together, “Well, since you are all here, I have an announcement.” 
</p><p>
He stands up and goes over to his desk and rummages through a drawer before pulling a folder out. He drops it on the table in front of us and sits down. Dumbledore nods towards me for me to open it up so I do. Inside is a letter with seven CDs. Curiously I picked up the letter and unfold it, clearing my throat so I could read it out loud:
</p><p>
“<i>Dear Mr Dumbledore,</i>
</p><p>
<i>I hope this letter finds you in good company. My name is Samantha but you do not know me since I am not a person, I am a seer of all and my job is to fix things I see by showing people the past and future. This is one of those timelines and so I have sent this letter to you with seven CDs. I am not sure how to say this but on those CD’s are the seven years of Hogwarts in the perspective of a boy named Harry Potter.</i>
</p><p>
<i>I was not impressed with the footage, however, since it was very biased so I also added footage from other houses as well. Your part in this to show this letter to three people, Harry Potter, Draco Malfoy and Cassiopeia Malfoy. They will bring all the students listed below to the Great Hall where a projection screen is there. You can show the CDs on there. </i>
</p><p>
I must warn that this may bring up old memories and feelings but hopefully, the end result will be worth it. If anything goes wrong, do not hesitate to call out my name and I will appear as a ghost-like figure. 
</p><p>
<i>Yours,
</i></p><p><i>
Samantha.</i>”
</p><p>
I flip to the second page, “And then there’s a list of students who are to go to the great hall.”
</p><p>
Draco frowns, “Why us though?”
</p><p>
“And why are the CD’s about me?” Potter asked, the most clueless person in the world.
</p><p>
My brother rolled his eyes, “Um, maybe, because you’re the chosen one and literally the seven years at Hogwarts were only about you.” 
</p><p>
Potter huffed but didn’t say anything more. Dumbledore sighed, “Well, now that you know, tomorrow your job is to gather up all the students on this list and get them in the great hall at eleven. Classes for the week are cancelled for the students on the list.”
</p><p>
“Wait,” I say, “All of us?” 
</p><p>
He nods, “Yes, all three of you can.”
</p><p>
My brother groans and so does Potter. I shake my hand at them, “We got through a war, I think we can do this.”
</p><p>
Draco gets out of the chair and hurries me out of the room as Dumbledore grins behind us. I can already tell I’ll regret this. Potter follows out as well, Hedwig on his arm, and neither of the boys does anything, just glaring at each other so I speak up.
</p><p>
“Well, see you tomorrow at nine Potter. Don’t be late.” I then walk off, smirking as I hear Draco mumble a “Bye, Potter.” before trailing behind me, leaving Potter in the dust.
</p><p>
Tomorrow’s going to be one crazy day.</p>
