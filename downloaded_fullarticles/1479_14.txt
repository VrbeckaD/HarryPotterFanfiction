    <p>Remus Lupin knew what had happened the minute he woke up in a hospital bed surrounded by Madam Pomfrey and the Headmaster, both staring down at him with a combination of concern, disappointment and ill-concealed fear that the young werewolf knew all too intimately.</p><p> </p><p>From his first day at Hogwarts, a part of him had known it would happen eventually. During those first few weeks, it had seemed inevitable. Even with every accommodation made for him by the Headmaster, Remus had spent every day trembling under the weight of an awful conviction that the next transformation would be when it happened, when some unfortunate student would somehow wander too close to the Shrieking Shack, probably on some stupid dare…and then it would happen, and he would be carted off to live the rest of his life in Azkaban, if he was allowed to live at all.</p><p> </p><p>The fear had receded somewhat since James, Sirius and Peter had befriended him, but it had never dissipated entirely. So, waking up in the hospital after that fateful full moon, Remus couldn’t honestly say he was surprised. Terrified and self-loathing, certainly, his heart clenching ice-cold in his chest as Dumbledore confirmed his worst fears, pulling every adrenaline-soaked night terror into the daylight and making it real – but hardly shocked. He was a werewolf, after all, and werewolves bite. He had been a fool to hope for anything else, he thought bitterly.</p><p> </p><p>No, the real gut-punch came when he heard the name of his victim. Severus Snape. <em>Snivellus</em>. The unfortunate Slytherin just so happened to be passing by the Shrieking Shack, what a terrible coincidence, no idea why he should be wandering around there, how awful…</p><p> </p><p>One glance at Dumbledore’s expression told Remus that the Headmaster didn’t believe this version of events any more that Remus himself did. Remus wished he could make himself believe it. Merlin, how he wished he could.</p><p> </p><p>Remus left the hospital wing with his head weighed down with too many thoughts, all of them uncomfortable and yet all of them demanding his attention. Hadn’t Sirius seemed so...excited, almost manic, for the past week, animated yet evasive whenever pressed about his good mood? Hadn’t he waited with even less patience than usual for the advent of the full moon?</p><p> </p><p>Hadn’t he said it out loud, in front of all of them one night in the Gryffindor common room, after a particularly drawn out battle with that irritatingly persistent Slytherin punching bag? “I swear if Snivelly doesn’t learn how to lie down and keep his mouth shut, Prongs, I might have to take drastic action.”</p><p> </p><p>Remus remembered wondering just how drastic those actions could possibly be, considering their usual interactions tended to end with Snape on the receiving end of multiple hexes. The Snape boy was a quick hand when it came to curses – but so were James and Sirius, and there were two of them.</p><p> </p><p>Remus had stopped his thoughts there, forcibly. James and Sirius might not be saints, sure, but they were his friends, and Remus need friends, desperately. And besides, James and Sirius had done so much for him. They had spent so much time studying to become Animagi along with Peter for him, just to keep him company. Remus couldn’t overlook that.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>But you can overlook them using you like a weapon, can you? You can laugh with them, smile at them, and know they planned to make you a murderer?</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Remus squeezed his eyes shut as he stormed down the corridors, as if that would quiet the awful gnawing suspicious voice, calm the trembling in his hands, assuage the guilt that roared through him. Worse than all that, though, was what he could sense beneath everything else – a seed of genuine rage.</p><p> </p><p>Rage. He couldn’t afford to get angry, especially not with his friends. What had his mother told him, after sitting him down the day before he was to be sent to Hogwarts? <em>Just remember, Remus, you can never raise your hand in anger to another person. Do you hear me? Never. It doesn’t matter what you’ve gotten involved in. You never strike another person. You stay calm. You speak kindly. Remember that and friends will follow. You understand?</em></p><p> </p><p>…and now Remus was gulping back the lump that had gathered in his throat as he came to the stairway to the common room. His mother’s face burned clearly in his mind, her face tired but still gentle, expressive. Still loving. Even before he had met the Marauders, Remus had known he could be more than a monster, all because of her. Whenever a painful or restless night left him miserable and hopeless, the thought of his parents, and particularly his mother, always calmed him. <em>I’m Remus Lupin, son of Lyall and Hope Lupin. I’m their son, not just a monster,</em> he would say to himself, repeating it like it was holy writ.</p><p> </p><p>Now the words tasted like bile and ash in his mouth. How could he say he wasn’t a monster after what he had done? He had mauled a fellow student – and that’s all he ever was, Remus thought mournfully, not a Death Eater or a Dark wizard or a bat or a snake or a boggart – whose only crime was being hated, hated by a popular Gryffindor who just so happened to be best friends with a dangerous Dark creature. And now there was one more werewolf in the world, another boy condemned to a life of pain and isolation. Remus realized he was now only a single step above Fenrir Greyback, and the sole reason for that small mercy was that he hadn’t sought out his victim – instead, one of his best friends had brought one to him. Hardly a comforting thought.</p><p> </p><p>Remus Lupin lost his battle against the waiting tears halfway up the stairs. Luckily, most of the students were in bed by now, so no one else was likely to come by and find the Gryffindor prefect standing stock still on the stone steps, his shoulders heaving and trembling uncontrollably.</p><p> </p><p>Dumbledore had not punished him. He hadn’t even insisted on keeping Remus in the hospital wing to apologize to Snape, and Remus had fled without so much as a backwards glance at the boy’s bed, where a thin lump under the blankets and a streak of dark oily hair strewn across the pillow were all that could be seen of Slytherin’s fresh werewolf. Remus didn’t even know exactly where he had bitten him. Now, leaning alone against the wall and trying to conceal his watery sniffles, Remus felt the full weight of the held-back guilt settle on him, turning his legs to stone. He didn’t even have the courage to face his victim and apologize. Of course, Snape wouldn’t have accepted it –he would have thrown it right back in Remus’s face coated in spleen and spit, bristling like an angry Nundu - but it would have helped Remus feel like less of a monster – like less of a Greyback. Because he hadn’t stayed around after attacking a child in order to apologize either, had he?</p><p> </p><p>The image was enough to send Remus into a jag of laughter, so loud and wild that he had to slap a hand over his mouth to prevent the rest of the dorm from waking up and finding him. Besides, the laugh had been more hysteria than real amusement. It seemed like Sirius was right in one respect – sometimes you had to laugh, or else you’d cry.</p><p> </p><p>Remus let out a shuddering sigh. The once-comforting thought of his friend had turned cold and unpleasant, like curdled food, and now made him even more nauseous than he already was.</p><p> </p><p>Turning to the portrait-entrance to the common room, Remus already knew that he wouldn’t be sleeping any tonight. Just as he was about to clamber through the passage, however, a distant sound caught his ear, killing whatever slim hopes of a good night’s sleep he still had.</p><p> </p><p>It was low and faint, certainly, but distinctive enough to raise the hairs on his arms. A thin, plaintive wail, barely on the edge of human, wound its way through the echoing corridors, eerie and pathetic and hopeless.</p>
