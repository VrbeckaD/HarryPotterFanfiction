    <p>
  <span>Sirius glanced up as the front door opened and Remus walked in, carrying groceries and looking generally exhausted. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>“Hey mate.” He said, standing to help with the bags and glancing at Remus, trying to gauge why he was so tired. The full moon had just passed so he didn't think it was that. Work had been hard on him lately, the bookshop he worked at always seemed one employee short and often kept Remus there past his shift. But Sirius doubted that it was either of those, at least not as the primary reason. His money was on the Order and their business with it. Both were active members, trying to recruit and quietly move against Voldemort and the Death Eaters. Of course, that was easier said than done, especially when the Ministry seemed to work against them more often than not. Sirius knew that Remus was involved in more than him. He had been slipping away at night, when he thought that Sirius was asleep. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>“Stop that.” Remus told him, picking up on Sirius’ careful scanning. “I’m fine.” He moved to put the kettle on, starting tea for himself as he put away the groceries.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>He wasn’t fine though. Sirius could easily see that. The pair had been friends for over a decade and flatmates since graduation. He knew Remus better than anyone. He knew when Remus was happy, stressed, even horny - that the last one proved more problematic than the others. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>The pair may live together but they weren’t together. Not in the way Sirius wanted. And not in the way that he sometimes suspected Remus wanted either. He couldn’t be sure, they’d never talked about it, about them, but something in the way that Remus’ eyes slid over him after he’d had a few drinks, or how they always seemed to end up pressed together at clubs, told Sirius that there was something there. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>Not that he’d ever act on it. How could he? What they had now worked and he wasn’t going to upset that delicate balance, no matter how much he wanted to. He felt too protective over Remus and what they had. He wasn’t going to let anyone ruin it, even himself. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>“You’re not fine.” He replied, leaning against the counter. “When’s the last time you slept through the night?” He knew that his friend had trouble sleeping, on the worst nights Remus would wordlessly crawl next to Sirius, pressing against his back. Sirius knew it was the wolf in him, he slept better with someone near him. They never talked about it.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>“I get enough sleep. Maybe if you weren’t so preoccupied with my sleeping habits you’d get more.” Sirius watched Remus pour his tea, his movements measured and careful. Remus’ shoulders relaxed the second he gripped the mug, like the world was suddenly a little better. The action made Sirius smile. That was Remus, hand him a cup of tea and he could manage almost anything. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>“Just making sure my Moons gets his beauty sleep.” He replied, chuckling as Remus flipped him off. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>They ate dinner, Remus was still distant even while they talked about their days. Sirius knew it wasn’t personal but it hurt to be cut off by his closest friend. He wanted to fix it. Actually, he wanted to pull Remus close and promise that it would be okay. He wanted to stroke Remus’ cheek and rub his thumb over Remus’ knuckles but that was impossible. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>After washing up Sirius turned to him. “How about a game of chess?” He hoped it would distract his friend, help get his mind off whatever was stewing up there. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>Remus agreed, grabbing the board and setting it up. He took two pawns and put one in each hand before letting Sirius pick one. They played without speaking and once or twice Sirius caught himself staring at Remus as he chewed on his bottom lip or sucked his cheeks in. It was like he was trying to make Sirius focus on his mouth, distracting him. It wasn’t fair.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>It did the trick though, Sirius lost the game, badly. But he didn’t care, by then Remus was relaxed and laughing, teasing Sirius for letting his queen escape.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>“That was awful, you lost all your pawns in the first twenty movies.” Remus told him, smirking. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>“Ah, just because you get attached to all of your pieces doesn’t mean the rest of us do.” He retorted, grinning at the other man. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You need to be attached to some of them Sirius, otherwise you lose.” Remus played chess the same way he lived- cautious, protective of the things he cared about. Sirius was reckless, sacrificing pieces and lacking any real plan. Remus loved to comment on their differences in playstyles, pointing out that he normally won. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>Sirius shrugged and walked to the window that lead to their fire escape, where he then leaned against the frame and lit a cigarette. Remus didn’t exactly approve of his smoking, saying that he hated how it made the other man smell, but allowed it as long as he was near the window. Like he often did, Remus walked over, leaning against the other side of the frame and slotting his legs between Sirius’.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>This comfortable touching was the crux of their relationship. Sirius wasn’t like this with anyone else, it was never as easy with others. He liked being close to Remus whenever he could and this view let him look at the other man. Usually he was looking at slope of Remus’ nose or the way his lips quirked up but tonight he was focused on the bags under his eyes, the slope of his shoulders. Remus was staring out the window, his leg warm against Sirius’. Even if he was in better spirits now he was still obviously exhausted and distracted. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>“I’m going to tuck in.” Remus said as Sirius put out his cigarette. He stood, stretching as he left the frame. Sirius followed. As Remus took a step back inside he tripped on the edge of their rug and Sirius reacting without thinking, catching him in his arms.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>“You absolute clutz Moons,” Sirius said, brushing some hair from his eyes and smiling at him. Remus didn’t reply but Sirius saw him swallow a lump in his throat, letting Sirius hold him for a beat too long before drawing back and muttering a ‘thanks’. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>The next few weeks were like that night. Remus was distant and distracted. He stayed late after Order meetings, closing the door as he talked to Dumbledore. Whenever Sirius asked what they talked about Remus would shrug and say that he had a question. Sirius didn’t push but he could see that something was wearing on the other man. He was eating less and it seemed like he wasn’t sleeping. One day Sirius found him asleep on the table, his arm serving as a pillow.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>Sirius had picked him up, carrying Remus bridal style to his room. As Sirius laid him down Remus woke up, sitting up and looking at Sirius, confused. “Where am I?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>“You fell asleep at the table.” Sirius replied, standing. “You need to take better care of yourself.” He said it carefully, not wanting to upset Remus. They’d argued about this enough, Sirius being worried about Remus and Remus telling him that it was fine. He was tired of fighting about it, neither ever won. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>Remus grumbled a reply, laying back down. Sirius sighed. “You can’t sleep like this. You haven’t even taken your shoes off yet.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>“It’s fine.” He replied, eyes already closed. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>Sighing, Sirius sat on the edge of his bed and began untying Remus’ shoes. The other man moved so Sirius could pull them off and it wasn’t until he was done that Sirius saw Remus watching him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>“You didn’t need to do that.” Remus said, propping himself up on his elbows. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>“I know.” He replied, placing the shoes at the edge of the bed. He turned to Remus, wanting to say something but Remus beat him to the punch. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>“I know I've been distant but I’ll explain everything soon. I swear.” Remus was looking at him with such naked honesty that he couldn’t do anything but nod. Remus looked relieved. He sat up fully, moving closer to Sirius and drawing his knees to his chest. “I haven’t liked keeping secrets from you.” Remus was close enough that he could see that his hair badly needed a wash and trim. It tugged on his heart strings. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Unthinking, Sirius reached out and fingered a lock of hair. It caught them both off guard, Remus’ eyes widened and Sirius nearly pulled back but then Remus leaned into the touch, his eyes falling shut. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I worry about you.” Sirius said softly, trying not to move so he didn’t break the spell. “I don’t like seeing you like this.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Remus’ hand covered his. “Soon. I swear.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius wanted to push, to demand answers, but he knew better. He simply nodded, drawing his hand back but not leaving the bed. “Change into your pajamas before you fall asleep. You need a good night’s sleep and you’ll never get it in that jumper.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Remus chuckled and nodded. “Yes sir.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He stood, watching Remus for another minute before slipping out of the room. He fell asleep that night still worrying about his friend.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>The next day was their weekly Order meeting. Sirius took some pride in the fact that Remus at least looked better rested, though he secretly thought the man could probably do with several more hours. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>As usual, Dumbledore was standing in front for the small crowd, sharing whatever information he could. It was never much, there were too many things that he couldn’t tell them for fear of the information falling into the wrong hands. He frequently told them how dangerous it was to tell anyone too much, in case they were captured and tortured. He’d updated them only once the mission was completed and even he rarely shared all the details. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>Sirius was in the back, lounging on the couch with his arm around Remus, playing with the bottom of his curls. He knew how it looked but he also didn’t care. James would have told him that he was playing with fire and he was bound to get burned. And maybe he was right but it didn’t stop him from reaching out and touching Remus whenever he could. Remus was focused on Dumbledore, hanging on his every word. That was fine by Sirius, it meant he could watch Remus, enjoying how his brows furrowed or how he muttered to himself when he disagreed. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>He was leaning in to make a joke about how Remus was going to get thrown in St. Mungos if he kept talking to himself but abruptly Dumbledore’s attention turned to them. “And finally we have one last announcement. We have a difficult mission coming up that will require the utmost stealth and skill. Mr. Lupin has agreed to take on this mission. We can’t reveal any details but he will be leaving tomorrow. Thank you for your service and meeting dismissed.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>For a minute Sirius thought that someone had cast a slowing spell. Everything around him moved at snail speed. People were standing and clapping Remus on the shoulder, bugging him for details. Remus laughed nervously, saying he can’t tell them anything. Remus accepting hugs and handshakes. Everyone talking then leaving then it was just them and Sirius still hadn’t moved. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>“Pads?” Remus turned to him, eyes full of concern. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>“You didn’t tell me.” Sirius knew he sounded like a jealous git but, well, he was a jealous git. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>Remus frowned. “I couldn’t- Dumbledore swore me to secrecy. I wanted to but-”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>Sirius suddenly stood. He didn’t know which emotion to act on first- fear, anger, rage. “You’re leaving tomorrow and you didn’t tell me.” He repeated, still in disbelief. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>“I couldn’t!” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>Sirius turned on his heels, striding to the door. “Pads!” Remus called but he didn’t stop until he was outside, taking in deep gulps of air. Then there was a hand on his shoulder, grabbing him and spinning him around. “Talk to me!” Remus demanded</span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>Sirius looked at Remus. He was distraught, upset about how Sirius was taking this. Later Sirius would tell people that he considered his actions, that he thought it through and knew what would happen but that wasn’t true. He just acted. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>He leaned in, pressing his mouth to Remus’. He tried to pour his emotions into the kiss, knowing it was probably his only chance. It wasn’t the best kiss, Remus’ mouth was still open and he was too surprised to respond. It lasted only a second and then Sirius pulled back, about to say something, to apologize .</span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>But Remus’ lips were chasing his own. He wrapped an arm around Sirius and pulled him close, licking at Sirius’ lips to tell him to open his mouth. Sirius compiled, parting his lips so Remus could twine their tongues together. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>His hands wrapped in Remus’ hair, kissing him firmly. There was no space between them, the two snogging and moving against each other in a not very discreet alley. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>“Home.” Remus said, breaking the kiss long enough to speak. He started moving his lips down Sirius’ neck. Sirius pulled out his wand, apparating them to their living room. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Remus didn’t even look around, pushing his hands under Sirius’ shirt. They were cold but felt good against his own hot skin. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Rem,” He asked as they parted so Remus could pull off his shirt, raking his fingers over Sirius’ body. He shuddered as Remus’ blunt nails raked over him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What?” Remus asked, leaning in and beginning to kiss along Sirius’ collarbone. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>Sirius wanted to kick himself for asking this but he knew he had to. “Are you sure? Is this just a shag before you leave?” He struggled to get the words out because he didn’t want this to stop but he had to know. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>Remus stepped back, bringing a hand to Sirius’ cheek and shaking his head. “It’s so much more than that. I’ve wanted this for years. You?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>He nodded. “Same.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>Remus seemed to decide that was enough. He pulled off his own shirt and stepped back in, kissing Sirius with renewed vigor. It wasn’t long before they stumbled into Sirius’ bedroom, Remus falling onto it the bed as Sirius stood, looking down at the man in his bed. Sirius had thought about this more times than he could count but all of it paled in comparison to the real thing. To see his best friend in his bed, staring at him with dark eyes. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>“Bloody gorgeous.” he said, running a hand down Remus’ chest and stopping at his trousers. “Can I take these off?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>“Can’t do much more until you do.” Remus replied cheekily. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>Slowly, slower than he really wanted, he popped the button and unzipped Remus’ pants, pulling them and his boxers off. Remus’ erection sprang free and Sirius stared at it, admiring it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>“Moons, how dare you keep something that perfect a secret.” He said, palming the head and watching how Remus bit his lip. “Can I?” He asks, getting on his knees between Remus’ legs. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>“Yes, </span>
  <em>
    <span>fuck</span>
  </em>
  <span>, yes.” Remus said as Sirius started kissing his thighs, slowly moving to his erection. Part of him wanted to tease Remus for hours, just to hear how his breath hitched and his small moans but mostly he wanted to touch the other man. Remus’ hips jerked up as Sirius wrapped his lips around the head. He sank down as Remus sat up, feeling Remus watching him. He started to bob his head, enjoying the range of noises that were escaping from Remus’ mouth.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>“Sirius, oh god, yes.” Remus’ hands were in Sirius’ hair, gripping it as he bobbed his head. He was getting into it, trying to see what elicited the loudest moans, when Remus abruptly pulled him off.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>“What’s wrong?” Sirius asked, looking at him but Remus just pulled him up and onto him, kissing him soundly. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>“Didn’t want it to be over yet.” He said, pulling him onto the bed with him. “We’ve got a lot more ground to cover.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>Sirius nodded, grinding against the other man. He moved down, kissing a pulse point on Remus’ neck as Remus asked, “Sirius, top or bottom?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>He felt his dick harden at the question. “Either but-” He looked up at Remus. “I’ve always wanted you in me.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>Remus growled, flipping them so he was on top of Sirius. He ground against Sirius’ hips, making their erections rub together, before moving off. He came back with his wand and muttered a spell, making lube appear on his fingers. Removing Sirius’ pants and underwear he crawled back on him, leaning back and pushing a finger inside Sirius. He moaned loudly, trying not to think about how long it had been. Remus opened him up, teasing him and moving infuriatingly slowly. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>“Rem, please, fuck me already.” He begged nearly thirty minutes later. He was grinding down on Remus’ fingers, practically fucking himself on them. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>Remus nodded and kissed him again, crawling off him again and getting a condom from Sirius’ bedside table. “Good thing you have some.” He said, rolling it on before positioning himself between Sirius’ legs. He could feel the head of Remus’ cock butting against his hole and he whined. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>“Please Remus. Ple-” His words were cut off as Remus pushed in, going slow until he bottomed out. Once he did he waited, running his hands over Sirius’ chest and abs as he adjusted. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>“Move, it’s okay, move.” He begged once he was ready. Remus waited another second and then started to thrust, shallow at first but getting deeper as they adjusted to each other. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>Sirius found himself wanting to say so much, wanting to tell Remus how amazing he was and how good he felt. He wanted to say that he loved Remus, that he had loved him since fourth year. But what came out was closer to gasps and grunts, cries of ecstasy from both of them. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>“I’m close.” Remus said, grabbing Sirius’ leaking cock and pumping him. He leaned down, kissing Sirius again, groaning into his mouth as his hips stuttered and he came. Sirius was only a minute later, coating them both in his cum. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>They both collapsed, neither moving for a minute as they caught their breaths. “Fuck.” Sirius finally said, nudging Remus’ face up so he could kiss him again. They lazily made out for a minute before Remus pulled out, discarding the condom and standing at the edge of the bed. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>“Guess I should-”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>Sirius shook his head, sitting up and pulling him back. “Stay.” Remus tumbled on the bed, offering no resistance.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>“I have to leave early.” He said, laying on his side and looking at Sirius. Sirius could see a swirl of emotions passing over his face. “Before you wake up.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>He frowned, wishing that they had more time together, that it hadn’t taken this to finally push them together, but he nodded. “More reason to stay now.” The sides of Remus’ mouth quirked up and he kissed both ends, a gesture he’d wanted to do for a long time but hadn’t ever been able to indulge in. “How long will you be gone?” He desperately wanted to ask about the mission, and if Remus would be safe, but knew Remus wouldn’t tell him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>“Sooner now that I have you to come back to.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>Sirius laughed, rolling his eyes. “One roll in the hay and you’re a bloody sap.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>Remus shrugged. “Maybe.” Sirius waited for him to answer his question then said, “A week, maybe two.” He kissed Sirius again, cupping his cheek with a hand. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>Sirius’ stomach dropped. That sounded like forever, especially given this new development. But the Order came first so he forced himself to nod. “I’ll be waiting for you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>“You better.” Remus said, leaning over to kiss him again. “We can’t owl while I’m gone.” He added, sounding sad. “No communication, it’s too dangerous.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know.” Sirius may hate it but he understood. “Just don’t go falling in love with someone else while you’re gone.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Remus laughed. “Fat chance, I’ve been in love with you for years. If that terrible haircut you got 7th year didn’t turn me away I don’t think a few weeks will.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius hit him lovingly. “I thought it would look cool.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You had a mullet.” He replied, teasingly. “No one looks cool in a mullet.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Now Sirius grinned, “But you still fancied me, bad hair and all.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Remus nodded, moving closer to him, his head on Sirius’ chest. “Like a fool.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My fool.” Sirius whispered, running his hands though Remus’ hair. They fell asleep like that, sleeping as close to the other as they could. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>The next morning Sirius rolled over, hopeful that he woke early enough to see Remus but no such luck. There was a note, his name scrawled on the top in Remus’ writing. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>‘I’ll be back before you know it -Moony’ </span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>Sirius doubted it. After only a few hours he already wanted the man back. He forced himself to get up and make breakfast, cursing at how sore he was. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>Over the next few weeks he forced himself to keep living, trying not to focus only on Remus. It was strange not to have Remus around, he was used to cooking with him, used to talking to him and playing him in chess. They were friends, roommates, and now more and he hated not having Remus there. He had to close Remus’ door, the desire to go in there, to sleep in his bed, surrounded by his scent, was too great. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>Some days he was sure he had overestimated it, thinking that he was just a final hurrah for Remus before he left. But then he reminded himself that Remus had wanted it too, he said as much. He had kissed Sirius slowly and carefully and Sirius didn’t think that he would fake that. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He found himself growling at his friends over minor things, irritated at them. He always ended up apologizing but he felt constantly tense and one edge. Even though he knew that Remus couldn’t contact him he found himself wishing he could owl him, just to hear that he was okay, that he was alive. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>He had tried to find out more from Dumbledore, anything about the mission, but Dumbledore refused to budge. He hated it but he forced himself to deal with it. He didn’t exactly have other options. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>He got into a pattern, coming home from work, ordering food from a nearby pub, spending a few evenings with Lily and James. At first, he hadn’t been planning to tell them about him and Remus, wanting to talk to Remus first, but it came out when James yelled at him for wallowing. He had been telling Sirius to get over it, that Remus would be fine and he had blurted out what happened. After that they treated him better. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>Two weeks passed and he started to let himself think about Remus’ return. Then another week and he began to feel apprehensive. Then a month. Now he was a wreck, forcing himself not to pace or demand news from Dumbledore. Something was wrong, he was sure of it, he felt it in his gut.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>They were at an order meeting, going over bland business. He had a plan to confront Dumbledore after, to force him to give Sirius some details, but Dumbledore beat him to the punch. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>“Finally, before we part, I have some news about young Remus.” Sirius perked up and saw that James, Lily and Peter did the same. They had all been telling him not to overreact but he knew they were worried too. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>Dumbledore paused, looking at him, then continued slowly. “He’s been lost behind enemy lines. We don’t know his whereabouts or his status. He has been carefully cloaked and hasn’t set out a distress beacon so we believe he is still alive. We will be evaluating our options and deciding on next steps.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>That was clearly their dismissal but Sirius wasn’t having it. He leapt up, barreling towards the bearded man. “Options? What the bloody hell does that mean? You have to send a team! Immediately!” He could feel his friends surrounding him but he didn’t look at him, focused completely on Dumbledore and his infuriating calmness. He didn’t seem surprised by his outburst.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>“Mr. Black,” He started, steepling his fingers, “It’s not as easy as that. He’s far behind enemy lines and hidden. We can’t send anyone else in without assessing the danger.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>“Send me!” He said immediately. “I don't care, I’ll go.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>Dumbledore shook his head. “You haven’t trained, you haven’t been briefed.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>“Brief me then! Train me! I don’t care. He can’t think we abandoned him! We have to help him!” Sirius was screaming now, he heard himself but he didn’t care. He felt a hand on his shoulder, silently telling him to relax but he was too worked up.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>“That’s simply not an option.” Dumbledore said, still annoyingly calm. It only angered him more. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>“Why not? You need someone to get him and I’ll willing. Tell me where he is!” He was growling, spittle flying out of his mouth. Part of him didn’t believe this, Remus was too smart, there was no way he had failed. He couldn’t have. It didn’t make sense. Something terrible must have happened, it was the only option. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>“Mr. Black there are many factors you don’t-”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>“I don't bloody care!” He screamed. “What if he’s hurt? You can’t abandon him out there! You can’t just discard him because he failed!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>Dumbledore’s eyes flashed for just a moment. When he spoke again the warmth had bled from his voice. “Mr Black I understand that you’re upset but I urge you to think through your words. I promise I have not abandoned Mr. Lupin and that I will do everything in my power to see him home safely. You need to trust me.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>More words spun on his tongue but James was pulling him back, muttering something to Dumbledore before dragging him away. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>    </span>
  <span>It wasn’t until they were outside that his friends rounded on him. “You can’t do this mate.” James said, clapping a hand on his shoulder. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius stepped out of the touch, growling at him. “What if it was Lily?” He turned to Lily. “Or James. What would either of you have done?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Both had the sense not to say that it was different. They exchanged a glance and quietly, cautiously, Lily said, “We’d feel the same Pads. But there’s nothing to do. You don’t know where he is. You have to trust Dumbledore. We all do.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius wanted to be angry, he wanted to spit out all the sharp replies on his lips, but he couldn’t, not with them looking at him so sadly, like he was a petulant child. His shoulders slumped and suddenly he was holding back tears. “What if he’s hurt? What if he thinks we’ve abandoned him?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lily stepped forward, carefully hugging him. “He doesn’t. Dumbledore will get him back.” Sirius fell into her arms, letting her comfort him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lily and James insisted that Sirius come home with them, saying that he shouldn’t be alone right now. He followed them, unable to shake the feeling that he was making the wrong decision.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Another week passed, with more meetings and no updates. It had been over month now. Remus’ bed didn’t even smell like him anymore. Sirius had thrown out the milk he bought for his tea. It was starting to feel like he’d never come back.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>After each meeting he tried to confront Dumbledore, to learn more about what was happening, but the man evaded him. It was like he couldn’t bring himself to tell Sirius the truth so he told him nothing. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I can’t do this.” He told Peter when they got a drink at a pub. “I need to do something or I’ll explode.” He gripped his pint harder than necessary, using it to ground him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Peter glanced around then leaned in, speaking softly. “I've seen the mission logs.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius’ eyes flew up, looking at his friend. “What?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ve seen them, the logs about where Dumbledore sends everyone. I was in his office and he keeps them on his desk.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Did you see Remus’?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The smaller man nodded. “He’s in Scotland.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Scotland?” Sirius had thought for a long time about where Remus could be, what he could be doing. He never imagined that he was so close. “Doing what?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Tracking down a werewolf pack, I think he’s supposed to get them on our side.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Fear struck Sirius. He knew that Remus wasn’t like other werewolves, he didn’t like how they lived off terror or how they treated humans like playthings. But it made sense, that Dumbledore would send him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ve got to help him.” Sirius said, already thinking about what to bring and where to start.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Peter shook his head. “Sirius, you can’t. You still don’t know where he is, it’s a big country. And we don’t know what happened. He could be-”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A snarl from Sirius stopped Peter from finishing that sentence. “I can smell him. I can track him.” He grabbed Peter’s shirt, pulling him close. “You’ll need to cover for me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What?” The other man squeaked. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Cover for me. Don’t tell anyone. I’m leaving tonight.” He would ring work, tell them that he was ill. It should buy him a few days. Hopefully enough time to find Remus and bring him home. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Peter looked ready to argue more but Sirius was already standing. He threw some money down on the table. “Thanks mate.” He said, giving his friend a salute before apparating home. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Once home he quickly packed. He’d be traveling in dog form for most of the trip so it didn’t make sense to bring more than the necessities. He stuffed some food and the medical potions they had in a small bag, also grabbing one of Remus’ shirts to use for scent. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Glancing around the apartment he debated bringing more but decided against it. Better to keep it to the necessities. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m coming for you Rem.” He told a photo of them from 6th year, with him rubbing Remus’ hair. “Just hold on.” With that, he apparated away. </span>
