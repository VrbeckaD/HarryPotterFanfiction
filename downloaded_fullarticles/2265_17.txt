    <p>
  <span class="">Theodore Nott always took breakfast early.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span class=""> He enjoyed the stillness of the great hall when no one else was there. Well, he shouldn't say that. Hermione Granger always took breakfast early, too. It gave him the opportunity to openly stare at her, which he took full advantage of. The only other early riser was McGonagall, and she always seemed to have her face covered by the <em>Daily Prophet</em> at exactly the right moments. Theo was a smart man, and he had no doubt that the transfiguration professor did this on purpose. Theo penned a quick note and levitated it over to Hermione, watching with a smile as she looked up at him with those beautiful eyes of hers. She quickly jotted down her response then sent it back to him. He unfolded it and his heart leapt.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <em> <span class=""> I'll be there.</span> </em>
</p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span class="">Theo waited impatiently by the lake for Hermione to show up. It was nearly midnight, but he didn't care. He <em>had</em> to see her. It had been weeks since they last had more than a few minutes together, and he couldn't wait. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span class="">"I'm sorry I'm late."</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span class=""> He turned abruptly at the sound of her voice, barely staying upright as she collided into his open arms. "God, how I've missed you." He breathed in the wonderful scent of her shampoo, trying to burn it into his memory.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span class=""> "It's getting harder to sneak out."</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span class=""> "I know. I just had to see you. Summer will be here before we know it."</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span class=""> Hermione shook her head. "I don't want to think about it."</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span class=""> "Shh. It will be easier now. I haven't gotten a chance to tell you... I passed my apparition test last week." </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span class="">Hermione pulled back to see the huge grin on his face, only to throw herself at him again. "Oh, Theo I'm so proud of you! I knew you could do it!" </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span class="">"Come here." He led her by the hand over to the blanket he'd laid out earlier.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span class=""> The moon was bright and illuminated the lake perfectly. They could see the giant squid's tentacles gently lapping at the surface of the water. Now that it was warm again Theo liked to come out here at night and watch her.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span class=""> "I brought your favorite." Theo said as he pulled out a few apples and a small jar of caramel dip. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span class="">Hermione hummed in satisfaction. "I'll never know how you do this."</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span class=""> "Its simple." He took out his wand and sliced two of the apples. "I'm not the one who pissed off the elves."</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span class=""> "Oh shut up." Hermione laughed out as she smacked his arm.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span class=""> "Here." He handed her a few slices of apple and the jar of caramel.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span class=""> He watched as she tucked her hair behind her ears, only for the soft warm breeze to carry it back into her face.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span class=""> "You're so beautiful." He said without thinking. "When will we be out in the open?" He hadn't meant to say it, he truly didn't want to argue about this tonight, but it was always on his mind. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span class="">"I don't know, Theo." She sighed.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span class=""> He frowned at her, wishing he never said anything. He knew how dangerous it would be for them to come out now and say that they've been dating for this entire year. Hell, just last year she dueled with his own father, who would have killed her given the chance. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span class="">"I know." He took her hand in his, then fed her half a slice of apple with his free one. He was immediately turned on when her lips came around his finger, feeling her tongue swirl around it, tasting the caramel. "Be careful, witch." He growled.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span class=""> "What if I don't want to be?" She said mischievously. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span class="">One side of his lips curled into a smirk. He leaned over and kissed her, pouring in every emotion he's felt over the last few weeks. Her fingertips grazed the back of his neck before she tangled them in his hair. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span class="">"Hermione." He rushed out.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span class=""> "What's wrong?" She asked instantly. Theo never stopped like this once they got started.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span class=""> "Nothing, I just-" He shook his head. He did this all wrong, they were sitting and not standing and his hands were now sticky and he couldn't-</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span class=""> "Theo?" </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span class="">He looked into her concerned chocolate eyes. "Hermione, things are about to get bad. Really bad. I don't know what Draco has been doing but I've heard things. The Dark Lord is coming, he's going to make a move, and soon. So..." He pulled a small black box from his pocket and opened it up, presenting to her a gold band with a large amethyst surrounded by diamonds. "Will you marry me?" </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span class="">He waited as Hermione stared at him in complete surprise, forcing himself not to move a single muscle until she answered him. The seconds seemed to drag on into hours, before she spoke.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span class=""> "Theodore Nott... yes. I will marry you." </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span class="">"You... you will? Really?!"</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span class=""> "Yes, Theo!"</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span class=""> "Oh my God! This is the best day of my life!" He screamed as she giggled. He slid the ring onto her slender finger with excitement, before he took her into his arms. </span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span class="">The very next day Dumbledore was dead, Draco was gone, and Harry was convinced the real war had just begun. Hermione only had minutes before someone was sure to notice her absence, but she had to see him. She waited in a dark corridor that lead to the Slytherin dungeons, hoping Theo hadn't already left. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span class="">"Theo!" She hissed in a panic the second she saw him. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span class="">He looked around quickly before darting over, pulling her into an empty classroom. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span class="">"Hermione!" He whimpered as he pulled her close. "I had no idea, you have to believe me!"</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span class=""> "I do believe you, Theo. I just wanted to see you." </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span class="">"I thought we'd have more time." He said sadly as he cupped her cheeks.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span class=""> "Me too. Harry learned some things tonight, he was with Dumbledore when..." She couldn't contain her sob. "When it happened. Theo, I don't know what's going to happen now, or when I'll see you again." </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span class="">Theo just nodded. He was going through something very similar. He knew he'd be recruited to fight. "I love you. I'll do whatever I can to come back to you."</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span class=""> "I love you, too. And you better. You promised to marry me." Her voice was full of emotions that she couldn't control. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span class="">"I <em>will</em> marry you." </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span class="">With one last kiss they parted, each one hoping the other could just stay alive.</span>
