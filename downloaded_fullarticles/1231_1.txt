  <span>Agony wracked Hermione’s body, her very blood feeling like liquid fire in her veins.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Bellatrix Lestrange stood above her, cackling, and released the curse. “I wonder how long you’ll last, mudblood. A while, I hope. It’s always disappointing when my toys break before I’m done with them.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione trembled, tears slipping down her cheeks. Desperately, she looked to the woman watching them, passive and cold.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Please,” she croaked. “Please...help me...”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Narcissa’s expression didn’t change. There was no hint of sympathy in her ice blue eyes.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Bellatrix laughed. “Good luck, mudblood. You’re asking the wrong sister for mercy. Narcissa isn’t soft on mudbloods like Andromeda.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione sobbed. “Please...Narcissa...”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Narcissa’s expression did not change.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Bellatrix wasn’t laughing anymore. Her face twisted in fury.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“How dare you address her, put her name in your filthy mouth. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Crucio!</span>
  </em>
  <span>”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione screamed again, but the sound was strangely muffled. She screamed louder, panicking, but still her cries for help were muffled - </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Darling, wake up!”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione’s eyes snapped open. Narcissa’s concerned blue eyes stared down at her, and her heartbeat slowed, reality coming back to her. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Are you alright?” Narcissa asked.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione nodded. “I’m fine. Thank you.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“You were screaming in your sleep.” Narcissa watched her closely.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione’s brow furrowed. “Was I?” Perhaps that explained her strange muffled screams at the end of her dream.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Would you like to discuss it?”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Narcissa’s expression was tentative as if she already knew what Hermione’s nightmare had entailed.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione shook her head. “Maybe in the morning.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Is there anything I can do for you?”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Just...hold me?” It comes out more vulnerable than Hermione had intended.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Narcissa’s expression softens. “Of course, darling.”</span>
