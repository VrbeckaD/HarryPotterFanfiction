    <p align="justify">                From childhood, they teach you not to approach young animals because the mother is inevitably around and you will get hurt. Her whole life she knew it would apply to humans too. And, from the moment her sister's curse almost killed Ginny Weasley, Narcissa knew. Time slowed down. Everyone around her was fighting in slow motion. She watched as Molly Weasley ran toward Bellatrix, watched as the two battled and watched as her oldest sister lost her life mid-laugh.</p><p align="justify">                Her family had lost so much in the past year. Their high status was gone. Lucius had disgraced them in the eyes of Voldemort and they were nothing anymore. It looked like their side was about to lose the war and then, what? Lucius would be sent to Azkaban and she'd lose him too. She'd lost one of her sisters years ago when Andromeda married a muggle-born, against everything their family believed in. Her other sister just died and she had no idea where her son was. Her and Lucius had been looking for him, but there was no sign of him in all this chaos. All these choices she'd made, they'd made, that's what it had led to. She had lost so much and who knew what was going to happen to Draco. His entire future was in jeopardy. And for what?</p><p align="justify">                When Voldemort died, most people gathered around the dead or sat at tables. Narcissa saw many Death Eaters try to flee and get caught. All she cared about was finding her son. And she did. And the three of them sat, unsure whether they should stay there or try to leave, simply relieved to be together again, and still alive.</p><p align="justify">                Kingsley Shacklebolt took over as Minister for Magic and he was merciful. Because Lucius hadn't made any effort to try to escape after the Battle, and because the Malfoys had lost their status among Voldemort's followers and the respect of the remaining Death Eaters, and thanks to Narcissa lying to Voldemort and letting him believe Harry was dead, Kingsley agreed not to send Lucius to Azkaban. Instead, Narcissa's husband would be put on house arrest at Malfoy Manor.</p><p align="justify">                Among the deceased of the Battle was Vincent Crabbe, a friend of Draco and son of close family friends. His funeral was held on a Sunday, one week after the Battle. As Lucius was confined to their home, Narcissa and Draco went without him. They were stopped at the door by Gregory Goyle, who seemed very upset. She presented her condolences to him, told her son they'd see each other later and joined Mrs Crabbe and Mrs Goyle at the opposite side of the room. Both of their husbands had been sent to Azkaban and Narcissa offered her help and support in this difficult time.</p><p align="justify">                After the funeral, Narcissa accepted to go have a cup of tea with Mrs Crabbe. When she got back home, Narcissa was surprised to find an injured and bloody Theodore Nott. Her son's boyfriend was sitting on the front steps, bruises all over his face, scrapes on his hands and arms, his shirt soaked in blood spilled from his broken nose. He was shaking, looking around nervously, and he struggled up as soon as he saw her.</p><p align="justify">                "Mrs Malfoy, have you seen Draco? Your husband says he's not here."             </p><p align="justify">                "We went to Vincent's funeral together, but I didn't see him when I left. What happened to you?"</p><p align="justify">                "Goyle wouldn't let Draco in, he left almost as soon as you got there. I thought he'd be here by now. I've been waiting a long time."</p><p align="justify">                Panic was clear in Theodore's voice, whatever happened was bad.</p><p align="justify">                "You should come inside, I'll clean you up while you wait for him. Maybe it'll help you calm down a little."</p><p align="justify">                Theodore was reluctant, but seemed to realize there was no better option. He let Narcissa guide him to the kitchen and sat on a stool at the counter. Narcissa took out her wand and started by cleaning out the blood. They didn't speak until she had moved on to fixing his broken nose.</p><p align="justify">                "Now, tell me, Theodore, what happened? Who did this to you?"</p><p align="justify">                "Do you really not know when Draco'll be back?"</p><p align="justify">                "I don't, I'm sorry."</p><p align="justify">                "He hasn't even been in touch since the Battle. What's going on?"</p><p align="justify">                "I'm not sure. He hasn't been talking much to me either."</p><p align="justify">                Theodore could hear the sadness in Narcissa's voice. It hadn't been any easier for her recently. For some reason, it made him trust her.</p><p align="justify">                "My father is nowhere to be found, my boyfriend won't talk to me, and now I get followed out of funerals by angry people who want to make me pay for being related to a Death Eater."</p><p align="justify">                "You were attacked." Narcissa had figured it must have been something of the sort, but it was hard to hear it confirmed. "But you weren't even at the Battle, were you?"</p><p align="justify">                "I wasn't. I left with the younger students before it started."</p><p align="justify">                "Then why would anyone want to hurt you? You didn't do anything."</p><p align="justify">                "I am Nott's son. It seems I am deserving of receiving their revenge for what he's done."</p><p align="justify">                "They want to hurt him by hurting you."</p><p align="justify">                "Exactly. But I doubt that'll work."</p><p align="justify">                "Don't say that, despite all that he's done, your father loves you."</p><p align="justify">                Narcissa had finished healing all of Theodore's scrapes and bruises. If it hadn't been for his bloody shirt, and the shaking, there would've been no sign left of the attack.</p><p align="justify">                "I know he does. But I haven't heard from him since I went home during Easter Break. Anyway, I should go. Thank you for the help cleaning this up, and the talk."</p><p align="justify">                "It was no problem at all, you're always welcome here. Don't be afraid to ask if you need anything."</p><p align="justify">                "Actually, Mrs Malfoy, could I ask you not to say anything to Draco about our conversation? I'd rather tell him about the attack myself."</p><p align="justify">                "Of course, I promise. I will tell him you were looking for him, nothing else."</p><p align="justify">                "Thank you again."</p><p align="justify">                Theodore smiled and stood.</p><p align="justify">                "I'll walk you out."</p><p align="justify">                "It's not necessary, please don't get up on my account. This past week has been emotionally draining, I'm sure you need some time to relax as much as I do."</p><p align="justify">                "Yes, and it's not like you haven't been here plenty of times before. I guess you can find the door on your own."</p><p align="justify">                "Have a nice day, Mrs Malfoy."</p><p align="justify">                "You as well, Theodore."</p><p align="justify">                Narcissa watched him go. She felt sad for him. The boy's mother had died when he was very young and now it looked like his father was gone too. She couldn't stop thinking how hard it must be for him to be all alone like this. She would gladly welcome him into the Manor, but he was her son's boyfriend and Draco was the one who should invite him to stay. Talking of which, her son didn't come home until late that night and she only saw him the next morning while she was having breakfast. He seemed to be headed out again and didn't even come by to say hi to his parents.</p><p align="justify">                "Draco, come here for a minute." Narcissa called.</p><p align="justify">                "What?" Draco stopped, but he didn't make a move in her direction.</p><p align="justify">                "Come, I need to talk to you."</p><p align="justify">                Draco reluctantly approached. Lucius didn't even raise his eyes off his Daily Prophet.</p><p align="justify">                "I'm busy, mother, what do you need?"</p><p align="justify">                "Theodore came by yesterday, he was looking for you. He says he hasn't heard from you since the Battle. Why haven't you talked to him?"</p><p align="justify">                "I've had a lot on my mind recently, I just haven't had time to see him."</p><p align="justify">                "But he's your boyfriend, and he looked worried. You should go see him."</p><p align="justify">                "I can't today, maybe tomorrow."</p><p align="justify">                Draco started turning around to leave.</p><p align="justify">                "His father disappeared during the Battle, I think he really needs you. Don't waste time. No matter what you have going on, you should be able to make time for him. Otherwise, why stay with him?"</p><p align="justify">                "Nott disappeared?" Lucius asked. "Why didn't I know about that?"</p><p align="justify">                "I don't know, honey. Theodore told me he hasn't seen him, that's all I know."</p><p align="justify">                "I should see what I can find out." Lucius ran upstairs.</p><p align="justify">                "You're not supposed to contact anyone with connections to the Death Eaters, don't make things worse." Narcissa called after him.</p><p align="justify">                "Don't bother, mother. He never listens."</p><p align="justify">                Draco left and Narcissa once again ended up on her own. You'd think having a husband confined to the house would mean he'd be around more and he'd spend more time with his wife, but Narcissa and Lucius had never been apart as much as they'd been since the Battle. For one, like Draco, Lucius had become more distant. His situation frustrated him and he had no outlet for it. He didn't want to talk to Narcissa about it, and he didn't have a lot of other people to spend time with and talk.</p><p align="justify">                Several of Lucius' friends had died in the Battle. Most of the ones who hadn't been Death Eaters didn't want anything to do with him anymore, while most Death Eaters who survived were in Azkaban. The others either had disappeared or were in hiding. Only a handful was still around and they didn't like coming to the Manor too often, afraid it would arise suspicion. Along with a few acquaintances who had supported Voldemort from afar, they were the only people Lucius socialised with since he wasn't allowed to go anywhere. Lucius tried spending time with his son, but it seemed the more effort he made, the less time Draco spent at the Manor.</p><p align="justify">                Lucius was angry constantly. Voldemort was gone, they had lost and he was locked in his home. He didn't know what to do with his time and felt lost. He had spent his years since Hogwarts building his relationships and working towards the Dark Lord's goals, now all of that was gone. He was mean to everyone, including his wife. Every once in a while, he wondered out loud about trying to restart the movement. Maybe he could replace Voldemort and they could renew their efforts against the muggles.</p><p align="justify">                "Narcissa," Lucius called one day, "do you still have tea with the wives of my Death Eater  friends?"</p><p align="justify">                "Do I still have tea with my friends, you mean? Of course, I do. Why do you ask?"</p><p align="justify">                "I was thinking maybe you could bring up this idea with them. We could restart the movement. Maybe our sons and daughters could take over the fight. Start anew."</p><p align="justify">                "I'm not sure it's such a good idea."</p><p align="justify">                "We can't simply let ourselves be beaten. We have to do something."</p><p align="justify">                "It's over, Lucius. Harry Potter killed Voldemort. They won. We should try moving on."</p><p align="justify">                "So you want to let mudbloods tarnish our lineage? Let muggles rule the world and force us to keep hiding? We are the superior kind, why shouldn't we live like it?"</p><p align="justify">                "There's nothing we can do. We tried, we followed Voldemort and it only led us to fall in disgrace."</p><p align="justify">                "You're my wife," Lucius raised his voice. "You're meant to support me."</p><p align="justify">                "You barely avoided Azkaban, if you keep going like this, that's where you'll end up."</p><p align="justify">                "This is about our son's future, about what kind of world he'll have to live in."</p><p align="justify">                "Yes, but our son and his friends are adults now. Many his age fought in the Battle. It is up to them now to decide how they'll live. Not you, them. And you can't control what they do. You'll lose your son trying to force him to join you."</p><p align="justify">                "Your sister would be horrified to hear you. I wish she were still here, I know at least Bella would be on my side. She wouldn't let herself be defeated like you are."</p><p align="justify">                Lucius stormed out. What he'd said stung Narcissa. And she was sure he had known it would. She barely recognized the man she married, the man she loved and respected. Things had taken a bad turn for him in recent years and he'd been taking his frustrations out on those closest to him. Since the end of the war, he'd become meaner towards Narcissa, almost cruel at times. Bringing up her recently deceased sister to win an argument was a low she would never have thought he'd go to. But then, she always believed better of him than what he was.</p><p align="justify">                Over the following weeks, Narcissa tried to get Draco to talk to his boyfriend. She hadn't heard from Theodore again, but her son seemed preoccupied and she thought he might need Theodore as much as Theodore needed him. She was convinced the simple fact of being near each other would be beneficial for both of them, even if they didn't have a serious conversation about what was going on with them. However, no matter what she said or did, Draco kept saying he was too busy, or he couldn't face Theodore, or didn't know what he would tell him, or simply avoided her altogether. It was hard to see him so distant, so eager to keep Lucius, and her by association, away.</p><p align="justify">                "Draco, could I have a word?" Narcissa asked as she knocked on her son's door. It was Friday night, three weeks after the Battle, and she was on her way to get ready for bed.</p><p align="justify">                "Of course, mother, you're welcome to come in."</p><p align="justify">                Draco was sitting on his bed, still fully dressed, reading a book he put away before she could see what it was. Narcissa sat by his side, briefly reminded of all the times before she had done so. All the times she had come in here to sing him to sleep or to comfort him from a bad dream. How she missed her little boy. It was so hard to see him grow up and stop needing her, but she knew it was how it went.</p><p align="justify">                "Draco, I know you weren't close to aunt Bella, but would you accompany me to her funeral tomorrow? Normally I'd go with your father, but he can't leave the house."</p><p align="justify">                "If you need my support to get through it, I'll be there."</p><p align="justify">                "I do need you. It'll be a hard day for me. It's hard losing a sister."</p><p align="justify">                "I can imagine. Losing Crabbe was really hard for me, and we weren't brothers."</p><p align="justify">                "But you did practically grow up together. I don't know what happened between you and your friends, but I can't imagine it can't be fixed. You've all known each other longer than you could walk."</p><p align="justify">                "We'll see. Goyle is very upset, but maybe things'll get back to normal with time."</p><p align="justify">                "Let's hope so. Goodnight, my boy."</p><p align="justify">                "Goodnight, mother."</p><p align="justify">                The next day, Narcissa and Draco headed out to Bellatrix's funeral. After they stood for an hour receiving condolences, Narcissa needed some air. She asked Draco to keep her seat and went outside for a few minutes. To her surprise, Theodore was sitting on the front steps. He stood up and went to her as soon as he noticed her presence.</p><p align="justify">                "Mrs Malfoy, I didn't think you'd be out so soon."</p><p align="justify">                "I needed to get out of there for a minute before the service starts. Were you waiting for Draco?"</p><p align="justify">                "No, I actually came hoping to talk to you. I can wait, if you have to get back."</p><p align="justify">                "I have a few minutes. I don't think they would start without me. With Rodolphus back in Azkaban, I am Bella's closest family member here."</p><p align="justify">                Narcissa noticed Theodore seemed nervous. He was trying to hide it and look his usual calm self, but you could see he was a little on edge and every once in a while he looked all around him, like he was afraid of something. It was subtle, but Narcissa had known him long enough to see through any façade he'd put up.</p><p align="justify">                "Are you alright, Theodore? Have you been attacked again?"</p><p align="justify">                "I can handle myself. I wanted to ask you about my father. Did you see him at all at the Battle?"</p><p align="justify">                "Yes, I did."</p><p align="justify">                "When? Where?"</p><p align="justify">                "The last I saw him was in the forest, I think. Then we walked back to the castle, the fighting started again and there was too much chaos to see where anyone went. And I was only preoccupied with finding my son."</p><p align="justify">                "Well, at least it confirms he was there."</p><p align="justify">                "I'm sorry I couldn't be more helpful. Please come inside, maybe after the funeral, we can ask a few friends if they know anything."</p><p align="justify">                "It's nice of you to offer, but I can't stay. I'm going to Ireland. My father knows people over there, maybe they know something, maybe he hid there."</p><p align="justify">                "Be safe, and remember you're always welcome at Malfoy Manor, no matter what you need."</p><p align="justify">                "Thank you, I will. Please don't tell Draco I was here, I'll see him when I get back."</p><p align="justify">                "You know, I tried to get him to send you an owl at least, but he's been very distant."</p><p align="justify">                "I'm sure he'll explain what's going on soon enough."</p><p align="justify">                Theodore disapparated and Narcissa went back inside for the service. It was hard saying goodbye to Bellatrix, the two of them had been so close. Everyone kept telling her how sorry they were that she lost her only sister, that she was alone now, and, for some reason, it bothered her. Narcissa grew up with two sisters, not one. While it was true that Andromeda had been disowned many years ago and they hadn't had contact with her since, she was still alive. Narcissa still had a sister by blood, not having a relationship with her was a choice.</p><p align="justify">                The following week was difficult. Draco was away at Hogwarts to take his N.E.W.T.s, meaning Narcissa and Lucius were always alone together. Lucius was insistent that he wanted Draco to start over the blood purity movement. He was making plans for the both of them. And Narcissa couldn't agree with him. She didn't want her son forced into a life of oppression and of constant battle against the world. She wanted her son to be happy and lead a good life. She wanted peace. Narcissa and Lucius barely talked all week and, when they did, they argued.</p><p align="justify">                A few days after Draco returned from Hogwarts, Theodore reappeared. Lucius saw him sitting on the front steps all morning until Draco came back from wherever he needed to be first thing in the morning. They spent all afternoon in Draco's room. Lucius hovered near the door, trying to hear their conversation. It looked as though they were cleaning, which seemed strange to him. They mostly laughed and teased each other. Lucius heard the name Harry Potter once or twice, and something about a Grimmauld Place in London, but he couldn't make sense of it. He wouldn't learn much of anything about his son's plans through small bits and pieces like that.</p><p align="justify">                "I'm moving out." Draco announced in the middle of dinner that night.</p><p align="justify">                "But where will you go?" Narcissa asked.</p><p align="justify">                "Harry offered me to stay with him."</p><p align="justify">                "Harry? As in Harry Potter? Not a chance." Lucius said.</p><p align="justify">                "The war is over, father, we all have to move on. And I think that, as annoying as he is, Harry is in the best place to help me navigate and understand this new world better."</p><p align="justify">                "But we're your family. You and Potter have been at each other's throat for seven years. You've been going on and on about how much you hate him and how terrible he is." Narcissa pleaded. She didn't want to lose her son. She wished Draco would stay home with her, at least until things settled down. "You can't abandon us for him."</p><p align="justify">                "He won the war. He beat Voldemort. We lost. I think it's time to let go of childhood grudges and old beliefs and try something new. Even if it seems radical at first."</p><p align="justify">                "Don't worry, Mrs Malfoy, I'll be around. I'll make sure they don't kill each other."</p><p align="justify">                Theodore still seemed a little shaky to Narcissa. He looked a lot better than when she last saw him, a lot more calm and composed. Draco hadn't seemed to notice anything different with his boyfriend, or maybe he just thought it was simply how the war changed him. No one had remained the same person they used to be. There was who they were before the war, who they were during it and who they'd become when the Battle of Hogwarts ended.</p><p align="justify">                "You will not move in Harry Potter's house. I will not allow it." Lucius interjected.</p><p align="justify">                "I am a grown man now, father, you can't control me anymore. I am doing what I think is best for me and my future."</p><p align="justify">                Lucius stood up. He was angry. Draco took Theodore's hand, said goodbye and left before his father could say anything else. There was no point trying to argue with Lucius, better to wait for him to calm down. Narcissa was sad to see her only son go like this. She didn't like where he was going, and she'd hope when it came time for him to leave, it would be in better terms than this.</p>
