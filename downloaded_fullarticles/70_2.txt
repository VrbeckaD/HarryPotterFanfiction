<em>Colin Farrell looks like if you went to a friends barbeque and someones uncle was there, and he's really hot and flirty, even though its totally inappropriate due to age differences, but you still kinda wanna take his clothes off and he will let you, ya feel?</em>
</li>
<li>Queenie overhearing Graves' decidedly non-PG thoughts about Newt<br/>
<em>I’m just imagining that Newt is so adorable and so cute that Graves prays to every deity that exists to have strength to not pin Newt to the wall and ravage the fuck out of him and Queenie just goes so red and basically like well shit, never thought Graves could be like that…</em>
</li>
<li>The spate of arson cases in New York<br/>
<em>I have such an odd soft spot for this pairing, the straight-laced auror and the zig-zagging conservationist. I’ve been overcome with emotions revolving around the idea of Graves doing a rescue without even planning it, lately. Right place right time, and suddenly newt, I think this is a Phoenix, nEWT.</em>
</li>
<li>Rudolph the red nosed reindeer is an absolute travesty<br/>

</li>
<li>Grindelwald stabs Newt in the gut (why??)<br/>
<em>I keep seeing Newt either silently stepping between Graves and a spell or like in Mummy Returns, everyone is relieved after a battle and suddenly there is Grindelwald casually stabbing Newt in the gut and Graves catches him as falls. Newt doesn't die though. Would you consider this?</em>
</li>
<li>The one with Credence and a canoe<br/>

That in Nurmengard, there was a single, hidden tower accessible only to Gellert that sat awaiting its destined resident. Somewhere where Gellert could bring Albus back to his side where he was meant to be (where he could keep him all to himself as he always wished to)</em>
</li>

<em>You know thing are going to get to new levels of kinky when is Newt the one backing Graves against any flat surface</em>
</li>
<li>Newt at war is a scary mofo with dragons<br/>
<em>Okay, so Newt canonically worked with dragons, Ukrainian Ironbellies to be precise, in WWI on the Eastern Front. What that basically means was that Newt was there, when the battles scorched the earth of Russia and Romania, working with dragons.</em>

</li>
<li>Graves and the fork from the fourteenth century<br/>
<em>What if Percival Graves was a nerd for something completely obscure like what if he’s just really passionate about collecting forks from the fourteenth century and everyone just indulges him when he gushes about look how shiny and well-kept this one is Phina this is a thing of beauty, absolutely amazing</em>
</li>
<li>My dear director<br/>
<em>Graves + pride, as told by Grindelwald</em>
</li>
<li>Fashionista!Graves<br/>

</li>
<li>The tourist!AU ice cream debate (follows ch.47)<br/>
<em>I read your drabble on six’s fanart and I thought to myself, “Newt, apparently your sense of adventure doesn’t not extend to ice cream flavours. Chocolate chip as opposed to Mango. Really? How about Peach, Newt? PEACH GELATO? Is that too fancy for your sensible English taste??”</em>
</li>
<li>Graves vs Paperwork (goes about as well as you'd expect)</li>
<li>A boy who fell in love with the sea<br/>

</li>
<li>Newt is kidnapped. Again.<br/>
<em>Graves' love for Newt is so clear that even a blind man can see that. So the bad guys take advantage of this weakness!! But you know what? Newt is NOT A DAMSEL IN DISTRESS he can kick ass and he " can handle myself just fine. No no Frank do not!And you too mister Graves!"</em>

<li>Newt keeps Graves because no one else deserves him<br/>
<em>dark!Newt keeps Graves by his side forever and ever because no one else deserves him but then like maybe Graves also stays of his own volition because its so easy to just give in, he's tired of fighting and tired of people who forgot him and is it so wrong to just let the world pass him by? They’ve already moved on anyway.</em>

</li>
<li>Graves the Unwilling God<br/>

</li>
<li>Newt and the sleazeball at the office Christmas party<br/>
