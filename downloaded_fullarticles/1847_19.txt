  <strong>Potter Cottage; Summer of 2012 </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>Sunday Morning </strong>
</p><p>Faint yelling could be heard outside Lily Luna’s room. With her deep red hair sticking up everywhere she sat up rubbing her eyes yawning. Grabbing the doorknob, she wondered if she should wake her brothers. Shaking her head, James would throw a pillow at her and Albus would roll over ignoring her. Stepping around the creaky spots, Lily made her way towards the stairs. Sitting on the third to last step, she didn't want whoever was arguing to stop if they saw her.</p><p>“We didn't lie to you.”</p><p><em>Dad</em>, she thought frowning, <em>Why is he arguing? </em></p><p>“You still didn't correct me!”</p><p>That was Teddy; who if upset would be sprouting brown hair. It was a tell tale sign.</p><p>“Since the day Remus told us,” Harry started before clearing his throat, “Hermione, Ron and I that Tonks was expecting. I knew in that moment you'd be treated as my son.”</p><p>Lily could see a shadow moving on the wall.</p><p>“Then I should have heard it from you. Not...not from school or the pity in my teacher's eyes.”</p><p>“Honestly you’d think your father would throw up a silencing charm,” someone said causing Lily to jump.</p><p>Looking up Lily found her mum; Ginny Potter standing next to her. Before Lily could say anything, the mother/daughter pair heard “I hate you!!!” as a chair scrape against the floor.</p><p>“Lily, be a dear and wake your brothers,” Ginny asked her youngest.</p><p>Despite the fact that Lily wanted to go after Teddy, she listened to her mum and went to wake her brothers. Ginny knew Teddy’s words hurt her husband the most, they hurt her to a degree as well. Harry wouldn’t show it, though, not till later when none was around.</p><p>“Were we wrong?” she heard Harry asked. Ginny could hear the cracks in his voice and her heart broke.</p><p>“No,” she said placing her hands on Harry’s shoulders, “We both agreed he could call us Mum and Dad.”</p><p>“Then why. . .” Ginny leaned against Harry’s back wrapping her arms around his neck, “He’s hurting and upset. Knowing Teddy, he probably regrets saying he hated you.”</p><p>Harry brought his hands up, laying them on Ginny’s arms, “You’re right.”</p><p>“Of course,” Ginny said kissing Harry’s cheek, “Now go check on your children.”</p><p>As Harry went to check on his children, over at Weasley Wizard Wheezes George came through the invention room when he felt the wards being tapped. George had taught his oldest niece and nephew how to tap their names on the shop’s wards. Pulling out his wand, George walked silent but quickly towards the doors. Looking out the window he saw Teddy standing outside with a red nose and in tears. The Uncle and father in him had George pushing the door open and ushering his nephew in. As his uncle threw the wards back up, Teddy’s tears calmed down and he was just sniffling now.</p><p>Pointing towards the stool, George said, “Sit” while conjuring his Hyena patronus. It came as a shock to everyone when George was able to conjure a Patronus after losing Fred.</p><p>“Ted's” George started when Teddy rushed forward shouting, “No, Uncle George don’t.”</p><p>Startled and confused George canceled the Patronus Charm, placing his hands on Teddy’s shoulders, “What’s going on Tedster.”</p><p>Teddy moved closer to George’s stomach and wrapped his arms around crying again. Figuring he needed to let it out George simply wrapped his own arms around the crying boy. To those outside his family, they wouldn’t understand why Teddy was calling Molly and Arthur; granny and grandpa.</p><p>“Did James do anything?” George asked confused.</p><p>Teddy shook his head.</p><p>“Okay, Albus?”</p><p>Another head shake.</p><p>“Lily?”</p><p>Another head shake?</p><p>“Ginny?”</p><p>Teddy hesitated before shaking his head. George felt his brow furrow even more confused.</p><p>His sister loved and adored Teddy like her own children, he couldn’t see her purposely upsetting Teddy. “Tedster, did Harry do anything?”</p><p>Teddy stiffened at his uncle’s name. He was regretting the things he said but wasn’t ready to face them. Nobody lied to him about his parents, he knew of them and everything they’ve done.</p><p>Feeling his nephew stiffen in his arms, George found himself angry at his brother-in-law; however, George knew getting angry at the current moment wouldn’t do any good. Instead, he asked, breathing through his nose, “Teddy, what did Harry do?”</p><p>Teddy shook his head against George’s chest. He didn’t mean to get mad or yell at his godfather; who had always treated him as his own flesh and blood.</p><p>George nudged Teddy’s shoulder, “Tedster, you can tell me. I won’t get mad.”</p><p>“I. . .I said I h. . .hat. . . ed,” Teddy started but had to stop in order to breath, “Uncle Harry.”</p><p>To say George was shocked was an understatement. Everyone could see how much Harry loved Teddy and how Teddy adored his godfather. George couldn’t think any of time the pair had said they hated the other. Years of being an older brother to two stubborn siblings brought patience something George didn’t think he had till Teddy and Victorie came into his life.</p><p>“Ted,” George said while grabbing some tissues, “What brought you to say you hated your Uncle?”</p><p>Rubbing his nose on his sleeve while George pushed it away handing him the tissues; Teddy sniffled, “Some Slytherins were talking about dad and how he was a perfect. The Professors don’t say it, but there is that stupid look in their eyes. . . that pity look.” “A few housemates had the guts to tell me I didn’t care about my parents. They overheard me calling Harry and Ginny; Mum and Dad.”</p><p>Letting his nephew rant, George could see where the anger came from. George liked to think he knew his nephew well and he figured the fire behind Teddy’s anger wasn’t that his sister nor Harry corrected him, but that people questioned his love for his biological parents.</p><p>“Tedster, are you mad that Ginny and Harry let you believe they were your parents?” George asked</p><p>“A little,” Teddy mumbled, “They never lied about my Mum and Dad. Whenever anyone would talk about them; it was always Remus and Tonks.”</p><p>While Teddy was blowing his nose, George flick his wrist letting the time appear in front of him. The joke shop was due to open soon, but looking at the brown haired boy; George quickly wrote a note displaying that the shop wouldn’t be opening today due to personal reasons.</p><p>“Come on,” George said startling Teddy.</p><p>“W. . .what?”</p><p>“Come on,” George repeated, “I believe your Aunt has some hot cocoa waiting.”</p><p>During the time Teddy was with George; the rest of the Potter family was awake and eating breakfast. James and Albus didn’t comment on Teddy not being seated next to Lily, but the youngest Potter couldn’t help but fidget in her seat. She didn’t like the empty feeling she got looking at Teddy’s seat.</p><p>“I’m done,” James announced pushing his plate back.</p><p>Looking at his brother Albus also pushed his half-eaten breakfast, “Me too.”</p><p>“Take your plate to the sink, James,” Ginny said approving of her son’s empty plate, “Albus eat a little more sweetie.”</p><p>“But Muuuummmm,” Albus started to whine but couldn’t get far as James said, “Just a little more Alb and we can see if Teddy will take us flying.”</p><p>Harry stiffened at the mention of his godson who still hadn’t come home. He wanted to give Teddy his space to cool down, but Harry was starting to worry. They hardly screamed at each other and Harry didn’t like the feeling it left in his stomach. With Albus distracted and James washing his plate, Harry noticed that Lily was playing with her food.</p><p>“Lils,” Harry said getting his daughter’s attention, “You haven’t touched your food.”</p><p>Glancing at her plate, Lily noticed that she actually hadn’t touched any of her food; which was unusually for her. She couldn’t stop worrying about Teddy; there was a question that had been burning in her mind related to Teddy.</p><p>“Dad,” she muttered, “Is Teddy leaving?” Everyone had stopped whatever they had been doing. Albus’ food fell off his fork, James’ plate fell back into the sink and Harry coughed on his coffee.</p><p>“No sweetie,” Ginny answered noticing that her husband wasn’t able too, “Teddy isn’t leaving. Why do you ask?”</p><p>“Because dad and Teddy were yelling and Teddy said a bad word,” Lily explained.</p><p>Ginny placed her hand on top of Lily’s saying, “Yes, your dad and Teddy were arguing, but that doesn’t mean Teddy is going to leave.”</p><p>Satisfied Lily nodded and started to eat her food. Harry and Ginny shared a look and secretly sighed with relief. All three Potter children had the same thought unknown to each other.</p>
