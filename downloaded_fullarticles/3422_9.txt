    <p>Draco had done significant growing in the last 15 years. At first, because he was forced to, made by the ministry to try to help right the wrongs he had helped create. His father had been executed, along with most of the Death Eaters they were able to catch. He had stood before the same Ministry that had made the decision to put to death many people he knew. Convinced he would be next, he was sure he was dreaming when they decided to release him instead. This was the condition for his release, mandated to work with an Auror. To tell them what he knew and to help track down the last of the Darkness Voldemort had left behind after his demise, at the hands of Potter. They knew he had inside information that would prove very useful to them, but they made it clear that one mistake, one lie, and he would face the same fate as the rest.</p>
<p>He was partnered with an older Auror, a man named John Martin, who was more than happy to accept Draco. Draco knew that John was hoping he would give him the big bust, a bust he could hang his hat on and retire. Draco had done just that a year or so later, helping track down the last of the Death Eaters in Croatia. Potter, The Weasel, John and Draco had been sent to take them in, but of course it wouldn’t happen without a fight. John had been stunned the minute they opened the door and as Ron ran to help, the Death Eater advanced. It was Draco's stunning spell that saved Ron from a worse fate. The sectumsempra hit him in the arm, instead of across the chest, where it would have been fatal. Draco and Potter had immediately jumped into action, thankful for all the training they had received to deal with wounds and for all the extra charms and potions Hermione demanded they carry,</p>
<p>Once they had returned, a meeting was called, both John and Weasel wanted out. John had become to old for the job, his heart not strong enough to take the abuse any longer and he decided he wanted to spend the rest of the time he had left with his kids and grandkids, going out “On Top.” as he put it. He had seen wonderful growth in Draco over the last few years and made sure to tell him before he left. “You’ve come from a kid with a lifetime of hatred behind you, to a top-notch Auror. Keep this up and you’ll be known as an Auror and not the kid who worked for the worst wizard in history. This is your chance to clear your name and make an entire new future for yourself. Don’t waste it.”</p>
<p>Weasel, wanted to join his brother George running the family business. George and Angelina were set to have their second born any day now. George was doing okay, but running the shop without Fred got him down, even in the best of times. Since Percy had decided to come back to the Ministry, George was the only Weasley running Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes and it just didn’t feel right. Since the split with Hermione, Ron had more than enough time on his hands to run the shop and spend some quality time with his brother.</p>
<p>“First Nev, now you, I’ll have no one left at this point” Harry complained to Ron. “Look, if I get stuck with Savage and he gets me hexed, you know Ginny will have your arse in a sling before you can explain. You know how much of a mess he is, it’s why no one wants to work with him!”</p>
<p>“Take the Ferret... Why are you two staring at me like I’ve grown three heads?” Ron demanded when he noticed the way the two were looking at him. “He knows what he’s doing. He saved my ass out there today. If the Ferret had wanted us dead, he’d had plenty of chances before now. I may not like him, but I do trust him”</p>
<p>Draco had to take a minute to process what he had just heard and how he should respond.</p>
<p>“Potter, I can understand if you’d rather not work with me. I was an insufferable prat in school and have done things to you that I…” Draco began before Harry cut him off</p>
<p>“We were kids, we both had difficult choices to make. You were born on the wrong side, made the wrong choices. But, since you’ve started here, I’ve seen a confidence in you that I’ve never seen before. Not that fake confidence you strolled around Hogwarts with. You’ve changed as a person, you’ve grown. I would be happy to put our past behind us and start fresh. Partners?” Harry asked, extending his hand. “Partners.” Draco shook his hand with a grin, and with that, was the day Draco's life truly began.</p>

  <span>Draco found himself enjoying working with Potter. Where Potter was brave and reckless, Draco was cunning and careful. They complimented each other perfectly; their work was flawless. Both were confident in their abilities, but together they became an unstoppable team, sent on the hardest raids and always the ones turned to for advice from both the younger and older Aurors. The knowledge they collectively had was invaluable to the Aurors working in the Dark Arts department since many shops on Knockturn Alley had been raided and closed. They needed all the help they could get. They spent many long nights at the office, with Draco getting to know Ginny also, whom often stopped by with food for the pair when it was obvious Potter wouldn’t make it home for dinner. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <br/>
</p>
<p>
  <span>What had started as a partnership, turned into drinks after a particularly hard day, then into drinks on the weekends, gatherings and getting invited to holidays at Potters’ home. Soon the boy who was Gryffindor enemy number one had become one of the gang. Christmas’ were spent either at Potters’ home or most years, over at the Burrow. He had come to love Molly as a mother. Never was his past held over his head, never was he treated differently from the rest. The year that Draco got his own Weasley sweater was one of the happiest days he could remember; Slytherin Green with his initial in Silver. His past was acknowledged, yet not considered an issue. He spent his days working with Potter, and his nights were full of either conversations with Hermione about the latest bill she was trying to pass or trying to find different ways to help either remove completely or fade his mark of shame. His days off were full of group visits with Headmistress McGonagall in Diagon Alley, impromptu backyard Quidditch matches; as good as he was he could </span>

  <span> beat Ginny. But the day he caught the Snitch out from under Potters nose was talked about for years. Wizards Chess with Weasel or Exploding Snap with the kids filled the time between. He went from an orphan, after the death of his mother about a year after his father, to a member of an ever growing family.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <br/>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The boy who had once been Dracos’ most hated person, soon became the man whom Draco would call his closest friend. Even as close as he was with Blaise and Theo growing up, this was different. There was no anxiety about saying the wrong thing, giving the wrong information. Even Weasel, God help him, had grown on Draco. Since settling in with George, Rons lightheartedness came back ten folds. He was still the Weasel and Draco was still the Ferret, but now it was said with laughter instead of malice. Which is why he wasn’t surprised one day after a thrilling day of setting up for Christmas and charming the little toys the children loved, to sing carols, plus chess and lighthearted teasing, that Ron wanted to speak to him alone, but little did he know the topic of conversation would change his life forever. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <br/>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Hey Ferret, how ya been? You know, I really don’t care.” Ron laughed. “I know how ya been. You’ve been happy, but you could be happier. How come you haven't had any girls around? I didn’t take you as the type that would have a hard time finding a woman!” Ron teased.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <br/>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I can easily find a woman, Weasel. I just, unlike you, would prefer quality over quantity” Draco quipped. Remembering the near revolving door of relationships Ron had over the years. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <br/>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Ouch, Ferret.” Said Ron, putting his hand to his chest, faking pain. “But, fair enough. Listen, I have the perfect woman for you. Friday night, 8pm, dates on me. I’ll owl you the address” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <br/>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Listen” Draco sighed “As much as I appreciate the gesture, your second cousins, best friends, neighbours… isn’t my type.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <br/>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Trust me Ferret. This is a once in a lifetime chance, don’t mess it up” Ron insisted as he turned to leave. “If you do, you’ll regret it forever. Oh, and this is the only Christmas present you’ll ever get from me”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <br/>
</p>
<p>
  <span>That Friday, Draco was a nervous wreck. He had checked out the restaurant that Ron had booked them into and at this point was convinced Ron was trying to put one over on him. How he had managed to get a table in one of the nicest establishments in London, the night before Christmas Eve, had to be a joke. But, ever the true gentleman he was, he made himself presentable, purchased flowers and made sure to be there on time, with a smile on his face. As soon as he walked in, his heart skipped a beat. I knew it, he thought, Weasel strikes again.</span>
