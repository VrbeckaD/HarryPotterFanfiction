          <div class="userstuff"><p>I love you I really do but sometimes that isn't enough. You aren't conventionally beautiful but honestly your  blue eyes sparkle with wonder and love. Your face used to mean happiness and hope but now every time I look at you my heart breaks even more.</p>
<p>You were my friend the only person I didn't have to put a mask on around. You always saw through my masks even when no one else did.i guess that changed. </p>
<p>We were always explosive. We weren't perfect. We were far from perfect. We were so young and dumb and we are both older now. When we fought we fought hard. I never knew whether to hit you or kiss you. </p>
<p>I should have known it could have never lasted.</p>
<p>We grew up and grew apart. We went to the same school and we nodded to each other in the corridors but never talked. It all changed when we were 12 you came back into my life and suddenly I felt better you filled a hole In my heart I never knew was there and I am so grateful for that time. </p>
<p>We repeated our early childhood being happy, fighting, and being happy again it worked. It really worked. We argued too much but that was just us. But we grew up again. You started to wear makeup like a mask . And I wore masks daily to please people who didn't care. </p>
<p>You saw through the masks saw how much I was hurting and helped. God she helped. Everytime I hated myself she was there to bring me back up again. </p>
<p>You hung out with people that hated me and everything I stood for but even then I could never say no to you. I would have done anything for you then and I think I still would do now. </p>
<p>I was stupid. I was so stupid. I caught feelings. I took something that worked and made it redundant. I love you  with all my heart but it never should have happened. </p>
<p>It would have been fine if I kept quiet it would have hurt but it would have been better than this agony. The pain I feel every day just wanting to apologise for how I feel. We are different now I guess I should be grateful that we still talk. </p>
<p>I confessed to a friend what I felt and well you found out. It was inevitable really. You asked me if it was true I lied and said of course not. You believed my lie and we went about our lives as normal. </p>
<p>I started wearing masks again. Just occasionally to start with to see if anyone would notice. They didn't. So I wore more and more now I don't know where I stop and the masks begin. I'm not the same person I was 3 months ago. It's got to the point where I wonder if there is any need to carry on. You used to hold me up but now I'm crashing and you never noticed. I don't blame you really I don't it's not your fault for not noticing. I should have just stayed together I always break at the worst moments and now without you there it's just a downward spiral. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I wish I never caught feelings. A little part of me dies inside every time I see you. I am so sorry for everything and I wish I was better. I started hurting myself again even though I said I wouldn't I always promise myself one won't hurt but it goes on and on. I even carved the word freak into my skin. Shows how much of a freak I am. I'm covered in scars now my razor has replaced you as my best friend. I just want you to realise how broken I am and to put me back together. </p>
<p>I miss you but more than anything I miss myself.</p></div>
