  <strong> <u>Meeting The Guardians</u> </strong>

Sirius </strong><em>Remus<u> </u></em><u>Harry</u><u> </u>Draco</p>
<hr/><p align="center"><strong>(Sirius &amp; </strong> <em>Remus) </em></p>
<hr/><p align="left"><strong>(1:45 pm) I need you to not freak out.<br/>
</strong> <strong>(1:47 pm) And remember I love you.</strong></p><p align="left">
  <em>(1:49 pm) If you burnt the kitchen again I swear to all that is leather, I will smite you. </em>
</p><p align="left">
  <strong>(1:54 pm) Well. If you did that, you'd be without my loveable smile and charismatic attitude for life. And that doesn't seem a life worth living at all. </strong>
</p><p align="left">
  <em>(1:56 pm) Ugh. </em>
</p><p align="left">
  <strong>(2:02 pm) Anyways. I invited Harry over for tea and the blond. </strong>
</p><p align="left">
  <em>(2:04 pm) Draco? </em>
</p><p align="left">
  <strong>(2:07 pm) Yes. The blond. Now I was going to turn the chicken into something that resembled a head, you know, for the banter? </strong>
</p><p align="left">
  <em>(2:11 pm) I don't think anyone would find that funny, but do continue. </em>
</p><p align="left">
  <strong>(2:12 pm) Well you know, he's a Malfoy. The Black family collected dog heads?</strong>
</p><p align="left"><em>(2:14 pm) Which is disturbing.<br/>
</em> <em>(2:16 pm) I don't think Malfoy's collect human heads. Because you know. It's weird.</em></p><p align="left">
  <strong>(2:17 pm) You're talking semantics and it hurts my already fried brain.<br/>
(2:19 pm) And I know you know they murdered people, right? So. Shh.</strong>
</p><p align="left">
  <em>(2:22 pm) How long have you been turning the chicken into a human head? </em>
</p><p align="left">
  <strong>(2:25 pm) Well. I had to cook it. And the smell and the hunger kind of overpowered me. So I wondered if you'd buy another one on your way home. </strong>
</p><p align="left"><em>(2:26 pm) No.<br/>
</em> <em>(2:27 pm) I'll order.</em></p><p align="left"><strong>(2:29 pm) Order?</strong><br/>
<strong>(2:30 pm) What?</strong><br/>
<strong>(2:31 pm) How. Dare. You?</strong><br/>
<strong>(2:32 pm) Order!<br/>
</strong> <strong>(2:33 pm) I'm a culinary mastermind.</strong></p><p align="left">
  <em>(2:35 pm) You watched one programme by Jamie Oliver. That is it. </em>
</p><p align="left">
  <strong>(2:37 pm) Moony. Why don't you love me? </strong>
</p><p align="left">
  <em>(2:39 pm) I love you endlessly. </em>
</p><p align="left">
  <strong>(2:41 pm) You can't do. Because clearly, you hate me. </strong>
</p><p align="left">
  <em>(2:42 pm) I don't and you're dramatic again. Did you have another cappuccino? </em>
</p><p align="left"><strong>(2:43 pm) My emotions are not centred around how much caffeine I have.</strong><br/>
<strong>(2:44 pm) God!<br/>
</strong> <strong>(2:46 pm) You're unbelievable!</strong></p><p align="left"><em>(2:48 pm) Why thanks.<br/>
</em> <em>(2:49 pm) ;)</em></p><p align="left">
  <strong>(2:51 pm) That's my line. </strong>
</p><p align="left">
  <em>(2:54 pm) And yet, it sounds so much better coming from me. </em>
</p><p align="left"><strong>(2:55 pm) I dislike you today.<br/>
</strong> <strong>(2:56 pm) They're coming at 7 btw.</strong></p><p align="left">
  <em>(2:57 pm) I get home at 7. </em>
</p><p align="left">
  <strong>(2:59 pm) Perfect. Just in time then,</strong>
  <strong> we do have guests coming, Remus. A bit of organisation wouldn't hurt you.</strong>
</p><p align="left">
  <em>(3:03 pm) You're breaking me. </em>
</p><p align="left">
  <strong>(3:04 pm) I hope to be later.<br/>
(3:05 pm) In half. And I love you too.</strong>
</p><p align="left">
  <em>(3:06 pm) Stop smut-talking with me when I'm out. </em>
</p><p align="left">
  <strong>(3:08 pm) Haha. Boner again?</strong>
</p><p align="left">
  <em>(3:09 pm) I hate you.</em>
</p><p align="left"><strong>(3:10 pm) hahahahahahah ha.</strong><br/>
(3:10 pm) LOL<br/>
(3:11 pm) ha</p>
<hr/><p align="center"><u>(Harry </u>&amp; Draco)</p>
<hr/><p align="left">
  <u>(2:45 pm) We are going at seven. Can you refrain from being a Pureblood arsehole for one evening? Also. Don't wear a three-piece suit, you'll be heavily overdressed.</u>
</p><p align="left">(2:48 pm) How anyone in a suit is overdressed I'm not sure? But fine.<br/>
(2:49 pm) I have a bottle of Merlot.</p><p align="left">
  <u>(2:51 pm) My dad's drink beer. Please don't bring the merlot.</u>
</p><p align="left">(2:51 pm) It's like you don't want me to be me. I'm a snob. Let me at least show that with fine wine instead of my clothes.</p><p align="left"><u>(2:55 pm) You know, people actually hate wealth being shoved in their faces?</u><br/>
<u> (2:55 pm) Also. My dad is rich.</u></p><p align="left">(3:01 pm) Your dad is a disgrace to his family and gained a lot of money by being the only one smart enough to survive.</p><p align="left">
  <u>(3:02 pm) Rich.</u>
</p><p align="left">(3:02 pm) You're annoyingly sharp today.</p><p align="left"><u>(3:04 pm) I had a good night sleep for once.</u><br/>
<u> (3:05 pm) I didn't have someone punching me in the face or shouting get off me, Blaise. It was pleasant.</u></p><p align="left">(3:06 pm) Finding humour in a traumatic event is not funny, Potter.</p><p align="left">
  <u>(3:11 pm) You're so hot when you call me that. It makes me just want you all that bit more when you remind me you were once a prick who couldn't call me by my first name.</u>
</p><p align="left">(3:12 pm) I didn't like it.</p><p align="left">
  <u>(3:13 pm) My name? Your name is fucking Draco. It is Latin.</u>
</p><p align="left">(3:14 pm) Oui.</p><p align="left">
  <u>(3:15 pm) Ugh.</u>
</p><p align="left">(3:16 pm) So you don't mind me whispering French into your ear when I'm fisting your hair, but in conversation, as you 'pretend' to work, is a no.</p><p align="left">
  <u>(3:16 pm) You're an arse.</u>
</p><p align="left">(3:17 pm) I have an exceptional arse, oui. But I'm not an arse, non.</p><p align="left">
  <u>(3:18 pm) No.</u>
</p><p align="left">(3:19 pm) No, the French for no, is non.</p><p align="left"><u>(3:22 pm) I know. I'm just stating no.</u><br/>
<u> (3:22 pm) My dad asked if you like chicken.</u></p><p align="left">(3:23 pm) This the vegetarian one that is testing me? Or the leather wielding biker who paints for a living?</p><p align="left"><u>(3:24 pm) The latter. </u><br/>
<u>(3:26 pm) And he isn't vegetarian. He just eats red meat when he's feeling anaemic.</u></p><p align="left">(3:38 pm) He eats vegetables, salads and chips until he 'needs' a fix of beef. He's a fake vegetarian.<br/>
(3:38 pm) I don't dislike chicken. Why?<br/>
(3:39 pm) Also, I need to wrap my head around the family dynamic. The biker is your Godfather?</p><p align="left">
  <u>(3:41 pm) Yes.</u>
</p><p align="left">(3:42 pm) And the other one is your dad's best friend.</p><p align="left">
  <u>(3:44 pm) They were all best friends.</u>
</p><p align="left">(3:47 pm) And they were banging?</p><p align="left"><u>(3:48 pm) Yes.</u><br/>
<u> (3:48 pm) No. Sirius and Remus, my adopted Dads were.</u><br/>
<u> (3:49 pm) Well, technically my mum and dad... Can we stop?</u></p><p align="left">(3:51 pm) Are you uncomfortable?</p><p align="left"><u>(3:52 pm) A little. They're my dad's.</u><br/>
<u> (3:52 pm) All three of them.</u></p><p align="left">(3:54 pm) Good.<br/>
(3:55 pm) I'll continue.<br/>
(3:56 pm) Are they married?</p><p align="left">
  <u>(3:56 pm) No.</u>
</p><p align="left">(3:56 pm) And your parents were?</p><p align="left">
  <u>(3:57 pm) Yes.</u>
</p><p align="left">(3:58 pm) Right.</p><p align="left">
  <u>(4:01 pm) Don't bring up the car accident. Please!</u>
</p><p align="left">(4:02 pm) Oh. My interest has peaked.</p><p align="left">
  <u>(4:04 pm) Draco. People died.</u>
</p><p align="left">(4:05 pm) Harry.<br/>
(4:05 pm) I know. Again. Been dating you a while, I'm not Longbottom who needs to write things down to remember. I remember - parents dead. Car crash.</p><p align="left">
  <u>(4:07 pm) It's a sensitive subject. My dad's lost their best friends that night and it still upsets them.</u>
</p><p align="left">(4:09 pm) I'll be good.<br/>
(4:09 pm) I assure you.<br/>
(4:10 pm) I'll save all car-crash related jokes for another evening<br/>
(4:11 pm) ;) </p><p align="left">
  <u>(4:12 pm) I don't believe you. I feel I shouldn't believe you.</u>
</p><p align="left">(4:14 pm) You know my dad hates your biker-dad?</p><p align="left">
  <u>(4:15 pm) Yes. I've heard about it from both tables, multiple times.</u>
</p><p align="left">(4:15 pm) Imagine them sitting around a table at our wedding. Oh, the fun we can have.</p><p align="left">
  <u>(4:16 pm) Wedding?</u>
</p><p align="left">(4:17 pm) Well. That's awkward. You don't wish to marry me, Harry James Potter?</p><p align="left">
  <u>(4:17 pm) Not that I hadn't thought of it. It just didn't seem you'd want too.</u>
</p><p align="left">(4:17 pm) An entire blood-line of marriages and firstborn sons and you didn't think I'd want too.</p><p align="left">
  <u>(4:18 pm) Well you aren't with a woman, are you? You're the first in your 'lineage'</u>
</p><p align="left">(4:18 pm) Ugh. Until your dad ruined it I would have been.</p><p align="left">
  <u>(4:19 pm) Please don't bring that up either. It makes you sound spoilt.</u>
</p><p align="left">(4:20 pm) I am.</p><p align="left">
  <u>(4:22 pm) I know that. You know that. They probably already know that. But could you attempt to be less nose up in the air and 'My father will hear about this' for one dinner?</u>
</p><p align="left">(4:22 pm) You're asking a lot.</p><p align="left"><u>(4:25 pm) I have to go. Last conference call. I'll meet you there, and I'll send the address.</u><br/>
<u> (4:25 pm) Draco.</u></p><p align="left">(4:26 pm) Fine.</p><p align="left">
  <u>(4:27 pm) Are you promising me?</u>
</p><p align="left">(4:27 pm) I am.<br/>
(4:27 pm) Sorta.<br/>
(4:27 pm) ;)</p><p align="left"><u>(4:28 pm) Love you.</u><br/>
<u> (4:28 pm) Draco!</u><br/>
<u>(4:30 pm) Malfoy!</u></p><p align="left">(4:30 pm) Ugh!</p><p align="left">
  <u>(4:31 pm) I hate you.</u>
</p><p align="left">(4:32 pm) Fine.<br/>
(4:32 pm) I love you too. Don't piss any more colleagues off. Remember phone voice still shows hatred.</p>

</p><p align="left">
  <em>(5:03 pm) He is. I'm at the supermarket, so we need bread?</em>

  <strong>(5:05 pm) You need to get your prescription or you'll die. </strong>

  <strong>(5:07 pm) No problem. Can't live without my Moony. </strong>

  <em>(5:09 pm) You know, just for future reference, I won't die right away? You'd have time to help me. </em>
</p><p align="left">
  <strong>(5:11 pm) I feel like you know I wouldn't, and for that reason, you should always prepare for the likelihood that I'll watch you, sobbing. </strong>
</p><p align="left">
  <em>(5:12 pm) Helpful. </em>
</p><p align="left">
  <strong>(5:14 pm) We don't have bread. </strong>
</p><p align="left">
  <em>(5:16 pm) Okay. Why did you ask about Draco? </em>
</p><p align="left">
  <strong>(5:18 pm) I'm thinking he can help me with something. </strong>
</p><p align="left">
  <em>(5:22 pm) Sirius. Nothing illegal! </em>
</p><p align="left">
  <strong>(5:23 pm) But what better way to bond than a bit of devious villian-ry. </strong>

  <em>(5:24 pm) Your son is a respected trainee police officer, do not make things difficult for him. </em>
</p><p align="left">

</p><p align="left">
  <em>(6:03 pm) What why?!</em>
</p><p align="left">
  <strong>(6:05 pm) Well, I think he cried because he was sad about not being invited, which is fuckin jokes. </strong>

  <em>(6:11 pm) If it's for the chicken-human-head, no. If it's for your sandwich, yes. </em>

  <strong>(6:14 pm) Peter is adopting your vegetarian-ness and said he isn't coming as it's too short notice. </strong>

  <em>(10:17 pm) Your Dad's affections are not controlled by me. Although I wish I could.</em>

  <u>(10:17 pm) He kissed me in Aldi the other day. On the forehead. Told me he was proud that I bought my own toilet paper.</u>

  <u>(10:19 pm) Did you like it?</u>
</p><p align="left">
  <em>(10:22 pm) A little. Until he made out I had something wrong with me, and then it was ruined.</em>
