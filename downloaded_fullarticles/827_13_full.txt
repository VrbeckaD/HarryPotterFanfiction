    <p>
  <span>Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Why had the school sent him an owl so close to the new semester?</span>
  </em>
  <span> He asked himself. A pale fingle ran across the parchment, and he read the green ink over and over in his mind. He’d heard of students being called in early… however what could they possibly need from him? Didn’t they know his family was a busy one?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I heard the owl, dear. What is it?” His mother said softly as she entered the foyer, heels clicking against the polished marble floors. He looked up to her with confusion in his eyes. “What is it, Draco?” She repeated, this time with more haste. She was quick to assume it was something very terrible.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He held up the folded letter and presented her with the wax seal. “They’ve requested my presence at the school before the term.” He explained. “I can’t imagine why, I’ve done nothing wrong.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He set the letter down firmly on the glossy black table, his mother’s piercing eyes watched every movement.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She finally let out a sigh and cleared her throat. “I’m sure it’s simply formalities or something of the sort. You know how the world’s been since… Last year.” She stopped herself after that- but Draco knew what she meant. She was talking about the accident at Hogwarts last year. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“When will father be returning today?” Draco then asked, following her into the living room. “He’s never been so busy with work. He hardly comes back before dusk.” He added. The accident caused it as well- he presumed- the insanely long hours where Draco knew his father was toiling away because of whatever the hell happened in that maze last year during the Triwizard Tournament. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know, Draco. He told me he has a long business trip planned soon. You know he’s working hard.” She sits down on the expensive armchair, gazing out the window.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Draco nods, blonde hair falling into his face and stands silent. He watches his mother as she sits down- face pale. She worried about him- about everything. He didn’t know what to think, what to say. The entire wizarding world was alight with the death of Cedric Diggory, and because of what that damned fool Harry Potter said. He’d tried to ignore it- but that was a difficult thing to do when your father worked for the ministry.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>‘To Hell with the Dark Lord coming back.’</span>
  </em>
  <span> He thought.</span>
  <em>
    <span> ‘To Hell with whatever Dumbledore said in defense of that half-blooded prick.’ </span>
  </em>
  <span>He dipped his head to his mother briefly before bounding up the winding stairwell.</span>
  <em>
    <span> ‘It’s all just a stupid plot.’</span>
  </em>
  <span> He reached the door to his own room, which he flung open with extra indignation, and scanned the letter one last time.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A summons to the castle a week before September 1st. He was to arrive by the Floo network to Hogsmeade at 2pm tomorrow. No later than 3. He was expected to bring his trunk, and he’d be staying at the castle for the whole week. </span>
  <em>
    <span>‘Oh joy.’</span>
  </em>
  <span> He rolled his eyes and kicked the side of his trunk, which popped the top of it open, and reviewed the contents. </span>
  <em>
    <span>‘Looks to be in place.’ </span>
  </em>
  <span>He noted with extra exasperation, eyes falling over glass phials and green neckties.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He took the trunk down to the fireplace and left the note on the table for his father to read, then returned to his room. The idea of going back to school was tiring enough, but gluing on another week in such short notice made him feel exhausted to even consider. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The night and subsequent morning arrived faster than Draco had wanted, and before he knew it, he was standing in the large fireplace. “Make sure to write to me. I’ll send Minuit at least twice a month.” His mother said, grasping his arm firmly. “I love you, Draco. Don’t do anything reckless this year.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Draco nodded, and gave her one last hug of reassurance. She was always like this at Kings Cross, right before he’d get on the train. “I’ll write to you once I’ve settled at Hogwarts, okay?” He heaved the large trunk into the fireplace with him and took grasp of a handful of floo powder. With the toss of his wrist and the word “Hogsmeade!” uttered from his mouth, he disappeared in a cloud of green fire.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>--</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Draco Malfoy arrived at the gates of the castle at 2pm sharp, where a very disgruntled Flitch took his trunk and directed him to Dumbledore’s office. He boarded the thestral cart that had been brought specifically for him, and slowly made his way towards the towering destination.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The empty courtyard and echoing hallways were unsettling to Draco, his pale hand tracing the bricks of the walls as he made his way through the castle. Every now and again he’d run into a professor, who simply acknowledged his existence and continued on their way, and he’d catch glimpses of students. He assumed these were summer students, or special cases, but he wasn’t entirely sure.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Eventually, he’d ascended all the way to the headmaster’s tower, met with the face of a gargoyle. He couldn’t possibly know the password, so he looked around- hoping to find a teacher or someone to explain just what exactly was going on. He still didn’t know why he was here. Within a few moments of standing lost at the door of the headmaster’s office, the sound of clicking heels approached from the west hall. He turned his head to examine, and was met with the face of Minerva McGonagall.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Professor McGonagall.” He stated flatly. “Do you know why I was summoned here?” She slowed her pace as she reached the door, eyes staring down at Draco.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I do.” She started. “I wrote and sent the letter for Dumbledore.” She faced the gargoyle and the uttered the password in a hushed voice.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Do you mind telling me then?” He crossed his arms. “My family is an extremely busy one, I’m sure you know.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“If you would just follow me, all will be explained very shortly, Malfoy.” She began walking up the stairs with no further explanation, so Draco held himself from any further remarks.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As he climbed the stairs, he made way to the circular office, books and oddities piled high amongst other things drew his attention up and down the large room. The candles shook as he entered, a phoenix perched atop one of the masses of clutter eyed him, turning his head slowly to size him up. The paintings all seemed to grow slightly agitated as he followed behind McGonagall.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He stopped once he reached the centermost point of the office, and took note of the stool which sat in front of him. McGonagall settled next to two other professors, Flitwick and Sprout, and their concentration of the headmaster. Dumbledore was scanning the shelves behind his desk with seemingly no rush.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Why on earth was I summoned here?" Draco finally demanded, arms crossed and voice brash. “I received a letter from the school only to be met with a bunch of teachers and a stool? I demand some sort of explanation."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Your actions these preceding 4 years have come to our attention, Mr Malfoy.” Dumbledore dictated quite loudly in the almost silent room. “It was suggested by one of our own Heads of Houses for a vote, of sorts.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“A Vote?” Draco cautioned. “A vote to what? Expel me?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, Malfoy. You aren’t being expelled.” He let out a small, short lived laugh before pulling a leathery tome out from the shelf he had been pondering over, setting it on his desk. “You see, there are rules in place which allow us to take action over a student. The suggestion that came upon you was pitched as both a punishment… and a rehabilitation.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>‘Rehabilitation? What the hell is he talking about?’</span>
  </em>
  <span> Draco’s face twisted up into a confused expression, body automatically backing up in reaction.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I can see you’re confused, Malfoy. Please remain calm.” He sat down in his large chair and opened the book, hand running across the pages until he found a bookmarked section. “It states here that a student may undergo extreme types of displacement and rehabilitation if three of four of current heads of houses vote for the proposition, and is approved by a headmaster. This type of punishment may only be enacted if it has been determined and deemed appropriate and fair by all authorities involved. The inclusion of outside forces such as Governors or parents may be overridden by this rule.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I don’t quite understand.” Draco said. “You keep mentioning rehabilitation… punishment… displacement.” He continued to back up into his body bumped into the wall. “What exactly are you insinuating?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The entire room fell silent again. "Yes, that brings us to </span>
  <em>
    <span>that</span>
  </em>
  <span>.” He says, clearing his throat. Draco felt his concern rising. ‘</span>
  <em>
    <span>What the hell could they possibly be planning?’</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"If you could sit down here, on the stool." McGonagall nudged him over. "The proposed rehabilitation that we voted on requires an extreme change of physical location and social geography. Changing such factors, we believe, will help you in the long run."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"What on earth do you mean?" His voice raised again slightly. He felt like a cornered child. He sat down nervously and his eyes continued to dart around the room, trying to discern what they were about to do to him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Dumbledore began to speak again, motioning with his hands as Professor Sprout appeared, holding a familiar hat which grumbled to itself with a loud disdain. "We all believe that your actions from these past few years can be remedied with the permanent rehousing, which is a punishment we seldom rely on." He gestured to the hat as it neared the center of the room.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Are you mad?!" He exclaimed quickly. "You can't rehouse students! Tha-That can't be done!" He backed away from the stool with furious speed, his mind already beginning to think of every possible way that he could refute them.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Actually, on the contrary." Professor Sprout, the Hufflepuff Head, piped up. "What Dumbledore read to you was the rule that the founders put in place specifically for situations like this. This is completely within our jurisdiction as teachers."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>After a long, and terribly winded argument in which Draco yelled a lot and the teachers patiently tried to reason with him, he was sat down on the stool with a red face and a headache. "Just wait until my father hears about this. You know very well that my family would </span>
  <em>
    <span>never</span>
  </em>
  <span> allow something like this to happen!" Even though he seethed these words, he knew his father wouldn't hear about this for months, knowing how busy he was. He had the business trip coming up… So it would be quite a while before anything could truly be done. “Couldn’t you have just given me a proper punishment? I’d rather go into the forbidden forest every day for the entire semester than… that!” He pointed towards the hat accusingly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They all frowned, watching Dumbledore approach him slowly. "We, as teachers, decided this based on what we thought would be the most beneficial to your future. Sending you to the forbidden forest wouldn’t do you much good, would it?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco refused to answer the headmaster, and simply crossed his arms for what felt like the millionth time. </span>
  <em>
    <span>‘Just get this over with so I can fix it.’</span>
  </em>
  <span> The old leathery hat was placed on his head, and the immediate feeling of invasion made him sick.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"A true Slytherin, his family only further supports it." The hat grumbled aloud. "It's difficult to see anything past that, he’s the perfect example of a pure Slytherin student."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Draco closed his mind up as much as he could as the hat talked. If the hat couldn't place his second house he wouldn't move, right? The hat only scowled, and he could hear it complaining.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"If you close your mind 4 off like this you're just wasting everyone's time. I'll still break through, no matter how stubborn you are, Malfoy." The room fell silent again, and Draco felt his mind being prodded and poked at, he felt uncomfortable. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>‘Just leave me in Slytherin, where I belong. I’d rather die than be sorted in with those other… houses.’</span>
  </em>
  <span> He pleaded.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The hat mumbled again, so quiet that only Draco could hear it. "Ah, finally something to work with." it paused again. "A short-temper I should most definitely note. Not a surprise given how hard it was to get you seated. Ah, and let's not forget to mention your devotion to your family. To your house. Truly the epitome of loyalty towards what you believe in." After shifting for a moment, it whispered to Draco. "I have a feeling, but I can't be too sure. You're almost 100% Slytherin, it seems."  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>‘Almost? Damned hat.’</span>
  </em>
  <span> Draco felt he was being ridiculed every moment he sat in this office, the heads of houses watching patiently as the silence hung over them all.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"What house do you desire?" It then asked, "Perhaps your judgement will help me in my decision. Your opinion is just as important, after all."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>‘</span>
  <em>
    <span>Slytherin.’</span>
  </em>
  <span> He immediately responded.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The hat gave a gruff sigh. "Try again, Malfoy. Your fate has already been decided. There’s no going back as it stands."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>‘Ravenclaws are ignorant and self-righteous, I find their methods of success far too reliant on simply knowing the facts and not understanding the concepts. Hufflepuffs are just plain stupid, I’m pretty sure. I’ve never met a Hufflepuff I actually liked. -Don’t even get me started on Gryffindor.’</span>
  </em>
  <span> He felt like he was complaining to Pansy now.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Well, what would you have me do about all of that?" The hat simply retorted. “I can’t change your… inaccurate… descriptions of the houses.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>‘You can’t possibly ask me to choose between them. They’re all equally terrible compared to Slytherin. This entire situation is terrible.’</span>
  </em>
  <span> He crossed his arms in anger as the hat shifted, sighing.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You're a stubborn blight you know?" It quickly remarked. Draco for a second reached up to toss the hat but Dumbledore tapped his desk as if to remind him they were present. He restrained himself.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>‘You said you already had an idea right? Just skip the shit and rehouse me so I can fix it sooner rather than later.’</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He knew, for sure, that if the sorting hat was given the option, it would definitely be Ravenclaw. He didn't have any other traits that could possibly put him anywhere else when disregarding Slytherin. He didn’t like Ravenclaw, but he knew that’s what was about to be uttered from the hat’s damn mouth.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I see. In that case." Its voice fell much more serious, calling out into the room, readying itself to finally choose and release the tension that flowed through the room. "I suppose…" It paused again, thinking, prodding at his mind one last second.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Draco Malfoy, formerly sorted into the house of Slytherin, will now and henceforth be placed in Gryffindor." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The moment the words left the hat's enchanted folds, Draco ripped the hat off and threw it to the ground. The two other head of houses that were present were quietly dismissed by the Headmaster and McGonagall faced Draco, holding her hands up.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Absolutely not!" He hissed. "I refused to be placed in that godforsaken hell-hole!" His voice was shaky purely from shock. "There is no way- absolutely NO WAY that my second house was Gryffindor!” His previous statement over Ravenclaw was completely, utterly, and wholeheartedly incorrect.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>McGonagall peered over to Dumbledore, her face twisting into a scowl as Draco’s anger rose. Dumbledore only moved his head, as if to encourage her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"No matter, Draco. You're apart of my house now, and you will hold yourself with some dignity." She turned to face him fully. “You must carry on these 3 years as a Gryffindor. While it may be, as it stands, degrading to you or your family, we all firmly believe that this will have a positive effect on your future." Draco, who fell silent, refused to face her. "The sorting hat has chosen, and you must face these punishments if you wish to continue your education and subsequently, your wizarding career."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He bit his lip and turned, his body facing towards her but his face did not raise. "As soon as my father is reached, this will all be over." He spat.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She sighed, before turning on her heel to a table where 3 boxes had been set, inside the box that she held with tentative care were a set of Gryffindor Robes fit for Draco,  specially made for the occasion. She handed him the box and then gently pushed him towards the door.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"I expect this change to help you, Draco," Dumbledore said before they reached the arch. "Rather than fretting over this- try perhaps- to take this time to your advantage to get help. That's why we're here, of course. All you have to do is ask." Draco didn’t even bother reacting, simply staring blankly at the box.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They left Dumbledore's office after that. Draco remained silent the entire way.</span>
  <em>
    <span> ‘My father will sort this out. Everything will be okay. He’ll come and fix this just like he has in the past. These damn teachers can’t keep it like this forever.’ </span>
  </em>
  <span>He kept trying to reassure himself, telling himself that This wasn't happening to him. This was a huge, complicated dream and he would wake up in his bed at his summer home. That everything would be alright.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Of course, he wasn’t too sure of anything in that very moment, simply following behind Mcgonagall with a blank expression plastered across his face as they walked through the corridors of the castle. Ascending and descending the staircases, turning corners, they reached the main tower. The painfully tall maze of moving stones made him feel even more sick.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He’d never imagine having to climb as many stairs as he did, seeing as the Gryffindor common room just </span>
  <em>
    <span>had</span>
  </em>
  <span> to be in the godforsaken heavens of the castle, and when they finally reached the large painting which hung against the stone wall.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"You'll have to excuse any mess in the common room. My summer students tend to be rowdy at times. I'll show you through the dormitories and the common spaces, and help you to get your stuff situated in your dorm." McGonagall said. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He grasped the box tightly as they approached the painting that was decorated finely with golden trim and reds. Upon closer arrival, the painting looked down at Draco with something he couldn’t exactly place. He felt very out of place already.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"This year's password is Ulesiss Invard. Be sure to remember it." The painting creaked open at the mention of the passcode, but before he could take a step into the hall, he could hear students. He shrunk up and stopped. He already looked- and felt- outlandish. Compared to the Gryffindors he had seen, he was about as opposite as one could possibly achieve. He would usually consider that a positive reflection, but right now it would just make him stick out sorely. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He didn’t want to be seen, McGonagall concluded. "They aren't out here, they're in the back common room. The sound travels, however. Don't worry." She tried reassuring him. At her words, he was able to bite back his pride and take a step into the hall which led to the common room, but the grip on the box in his hands only got tighter. He couldn’t deal with the sheer embarrassment so early on.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>McGonagall only continued walking into the Common room, and Draco paused for a moment, taking in what sights no other Slytherin would get to see. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The tall walls and vaulted ceilings were marbled stone and beige colours. The ceiling was draped in beautiful and lavish reds and golds, and large golden lanterns and candles floated effortlessly across the ceiling space. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The dark oak floor was covered in a collection of deep red rugs that felt soft with each step, creaking as he continued to slowly make his way in. The towering room was large, almost larger than the main commons of the Slytherin House.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The dark oak tables and chairs were placed almost half hazardly, while still maintaining an organised chaos, and the stuffy red sofas and the chairs that were lined with pillows and blankets were many in number. The grand fireplace was lit, paintings of warm hues lined the walls that were covered in various peeling red wallpapers and tapestries.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Draco noted the opening in between the wall and the other side of the fireplace. Another tower room- smaller than the main one he noted. It looked to have more tables, bookcases and the like. He could only see what was visible in between the flame and the marble, and he could tell that's where the summer students were. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He turned his back to the fireplace, where he saw two more towers, both had dark oak staircases spiralling up, connecting at the top by a balcony which was decorated with more shelves and seats. More banners, tapestries, and drapes hung along the linings of the rails.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>‘It was an absolute mess when compared to the Slytherin commons, however, it didn't necessarily feel dirty or chaotic. It felt… Lived in?’</span>
  </em>
  <span> Draco stood in awe of the large room, and couldn’t exactly place what he was feeling. He couldn't exactly pinpoint it, and it was confusing to him how students could live in the red and gold mess that was this… common area. However, he fell silent again. He couldn't muster a single word.</span>
</p><p><span><br/>
</span> <span>McGonagall waited until Draco was seemingly done with his awestruck gaze, and began to walk towards the sets of spiral staircases opposite of the fireplace.</span></p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"The girl's dorms are on the left, Boys on the right. As you ascend the stairs you meet multiple floors of Dorms. You'll be in room number 5. The respective bathrooms are downstairs." She then said, gesturing to the different areas she mentioned. "Unlike Slytherin, where there are usually 2-3 beds per room, you'll be rooming with 4 other Students."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Draco, in his thoughts, was trying to process the experience of being roommates with four Gryffindors. He shuddered. Not only at the thought of his.. Living conditions.. But also of the sheer embarrassment of being placed in the dorm with time. He hoped the people he was going to be forced to live with until his father sorted everything out were tolerable, relatively speaking, and that it could easily be sorted out.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>McGonagall led him up the right set stairs and stopped as they reached the fifth floor. She held up a small golden key, which opened the door. "Each member of this room will have a key. Do not lose it under any circumstance." She warned.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> They entered the room, which was a decently sized circular space with 5 beds placed evenly along the walls. Wardrobes and desks lined the empty room between the beds, a set for each bed, and there was empty space for trunks and personal belongings. In the middle, there was a large heater. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"This bed right here is yours. The rooming situation has been a little odd this year..." She pointed to one that rested up against an enclave of the wall and had a window next to it. "Your stuff will be here shortly, I’d imagine within a couple of hours… and you will be rooming with.." She pulled a parchment from her robes. "Neville Longbottom, Dean Thomas, Ronald Weasley, and…" She paused.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>‘Ronald Weasley. Of course, something had to go wrong. Of course, I was going to get stuck with a damn Weasley.’</span>
  </em>
  <span> He scoffed for a moment, but didn’t say anything. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Your fourth roommate, coincidentally, is..." She seemed surprised by her own list. "Harry Potter."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco clenched his fists again but stayed silent. He bit the inside of his mouth in order to silence himself and looked away. "There's nothing I can do to stop this, is there?” He asked simply.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>McGonagall shook her head. "Don’t you think it’s time to put your differences aside with them and bury whatever grievances you have with them?" She folded up her list, watching Draco.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Draco, through clenched teeth, took a deep breath. "I don’t think that something like that is possible, Professor." He approached his bed and sat down. "For the sake of the education I know my parents want me to get, I’ll play along with this stupidity. All in due time, my father will fix this." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She handed Draco a small stack of papers, his key, and moved towards the door.  "Play nice until then," she said, with a slightly sarcastic tone. "...as I'm not sure when… or if your father will be able to assert himself."  She looked at him with a stern expression and sighed, then closed the door and left Draco to his devices, sitting in the circular dorm room where he'd be spending some time-</span>
  <em>
    <span> until everything was fixed</span>
  </em>
  <span>- he thought.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Just the idea of sharing the same breathing space as Potter or Weasley, or both, was sickening to him. The idea of the whole situation was absolutely terrible- and he'd have to wait for his family to fix it all. He knew he couldn't just drop out of school- he'd be ridiculed in his family and possibly disowned. He couldn't fix the situation himself either. He could only painfully wait for the outcome of a punishment he didn't deserve. That just made it all the more frustrating for him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Potter deserved to be put in his place, an arrogant half-blood who somehow had everything. He had the damn Champion title, the damn love of every teacher in a 10-mile radius, save for Professor Snape, and he walked around flaunting his mediocre pedigree like he meant something. Like anything he did meant anything.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The week where he was forced to stay in an almost empty Hogwarts was uneventful at best. He was able to evade all interaction with any Gryffindors, and very often found himself in the Great Hall or riding a set of stairs to ignore the elephant in the room, and in his mind. McGonagall, for the most part, left him to his own devices. She didn't make him do anything, nor did she make any effort to push the idea of rehabilitation on him. She would occasionally spot him in the halls wandering, or in one of the dozens of studies, or in the library. She would sometimes ask if he was getting acquainted with the other Gryffindor members that were already there.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> He would, of course, in a variety of responses, ignore her and attempt to insult her politely. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The dreaded day that Draco was stressing over was almost here, however. The first day of the official semester.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>While there were a few kids already at the school, taking extra classes or simply there because of personal reasons, once the first day arrived, there would be hundreds of kids roaming the halls and bearing witness to him in red. He hated every second of the notion. He couldn’t possibly live with the shame, now that he had time to think about it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Only a day before the semester began, he sat holed up in his bed. He didn’t want to move, or do anything. He just wanted to sit there in dismay.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>McGonagall had to ruin that, however, when she knocked on the door gently.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Good afternoon.” She said flatly, examining him as he pulled another blanket over himself. “Tomorrow is the first day of school. I’ll remind you to attend all classes and be back in the dorms by 8. Remember to meet your Prefect officer as well.” She approached the bed and pat the wooden post.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Is that all?” Draco spat under the muffled covers.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I should also remind you that all students are required to ride the train, as it is both a longstanding tradition, and required by the Ministry of Magic. All summer students and Early arrivals are required to do this as well. I’d recommend you take the Floo Network down to Kings Cross tomorrow morning for the ride from Hogsmeade.” She gave the post one last affirming pat and left, Draco’s attitude making it clear he wanted to be left alone. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He rolled his eyes and thought of the stupid train ride he was going to be forced to take. Every year they made them raide that dumb thing. It would be for more efficient to take the network or get there by literally any other means, but they’d rather him ride some muggle-made train across the countryside for almost 6 hours. </span>
  <b>Six hours.</b>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He realised that it would be difficult to hide himself in the train. He couldn’t just do what he’s done every year. He couldn’t possibly face his Slytherin friends while under the situation. He’d also have the robes to worry about- and the Thestral carts… and the feast, if he decided to attend the feast at all, that is.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>If he could snag a compartment alone- he could lock away and stay on the down low. He could probably put off wearing on his uniform until last minute, hide away from the crowd when everyone left for the castle. He could probably hide away from the housing of first years and the celebratory feast that followed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>But hiding could only get him so far- he'd have to check in with his prefects once a week- which required him to be in the commons. He'd have to return to the Gryffindor tower at 8 when curfew struck if he didn't want even more bullshit to deal with. He'd probably have to face his dreaded fucking roommates at one point or another, and he couldn't skip out on every meal to stay away from the long table where the rest of the damned Gryffindors sat. He was going to be under ‘rehabilitation,’ which meant he’d be accounted for in many situations where he’d usually be able to slip out.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>No matter how he looked at it- he would have to face it all at some point- and it would be before his father came to sort the situation out.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He’d have to think of something, </span>
  <em>
    <span>anything</span>
  </em>
  <span>, to keep him on the down-low for the next few weeks.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>When he finally sat up from the large, frumpy bed he’d been hiding in all day, he noticed- to his dismay- that the trunks were in place for tomorrow. His dark black case with leather straps and green flourishes stood out from the traditional brown trunks. He could place out Weasley's from the lot, as it was yellowed with time and was tearing at the seams- it was just a bed over from his- and in between his own bed and Weasley's was Potters, if the large HP plastered on the top was any indicator.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The sight made Draco angry- he felt his head straining at the thought of it, so he closed his eyes. He took a deep breath.</span>
  <em>
    <span> ‘A few weeks, at worst. A couple days at best.’ </span>
  </em>
  <span>He thought.</span>
  <em>
    <span> ‘My father will have received my Owl by tomorrow, and this will all work out in my favour</span>
  </em>
  <span>.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Before he could really think much of it, he set himself an alarm and laid down. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He had to admit- if there was a single thing that Gryffindor did right- objectively speaking- it was the bedding. The mattresses were far more comfortable than he expected, and the red and gold sheets that adorned the beds were soft and warm. The pillows were just right- everything felt good when he was asleep. Of course, that was just simply an observation.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He didn’t want to think about anything in that moment, and decided just sleeping would do him better than staying up with his thoughts would. The comfortable sheets made him drift quickly, and the cool draft that flowed in from the large windows made him feel surprisingly at ease.</span>
