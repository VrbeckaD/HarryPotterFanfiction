    <p>Every young wizard grew up hearing the tales of The Boy Who Lived, his legend was memorized by mothers and fathers everywhere. He was made of glory and heart despite being only a young babe. Cedric had only been a few years old when the boy was made legend, the story of young Harry had become his nightly bedtime tale. Of course, he got older and his interest had grown deeper as he would find books on the Potter family and their history. A series of surprises had struck him in his formative years, learning that the Boy was a half-blood was the first. Cedric, in his child-like state, had believed that the boy would be a pureblood. It only seemed logical at first, blood purity was held in high regard and of course, Cedric was but a child and couldn’t fully process it. He seemed to understand that a pureblood would be the only type of wizard to survive Voldemort’s attempt on their life.</p>
<p>That was not the case.</p>
<p>Harry Potter, The Boy Who Lived, was <em>not</em> a pureblood by any means. He was a half-blood, a term that young Cedric barely understood at the time, but it was enough for him to regard that status as something to be prideful in. Afterall, if one was a half-blood then they were one step closer to the savior in legends. In ways, he was even envious of Harry’s half-blood status despite his own pureblood lineage.</p>
<p>The next surprise was learning that Lily Evans-Potter, the mother of the legend, was a muggle-born woman. A newfound respect settled in him. Perhaps the nonsense that some purebloods, including his father, spouted was really nonsense as his own mother stated. The idea of blood purity was a common topic in the conversations he witnessed between his father and other pureblood wizards they met. But Lily Potter was truly a most powerful witch despite her muggle parents, a truth in the argument that blood purity was <em>not</em> a determining factor in magic and its power.</p>
<p>The last surprise was perhaps the most anti-climactic of them all. After learning the boy of legend was a half-blood, his mother a muggle-born witch and a most powerful one at that. Learning that James Potter, his father, was the heir to the Potter estate was as exciting as tasting a slightly sweeter than normal mug of hot cocoa. The Potter estate was a pureblood family of great power and influence despite their desire to not broadcast it around. But one would have been a fool to try and challenge that notion, and so the estate and its contents were locked due to the death of last heir. It was believed that they would be reopened to his son once Harry began his attendance at Hogwarts.</p>
<p>But none of that was interesting to young Cedric, after all most of his fantasies up until his own acceptance were simply of just how amazing the legendary boy could appear. Would he stand tall, shoulders squared in the face of adversity? Or perhaps did he fall in line with the Malfoy’s, cold and stoic with a heart that barely seemed to beat? Maybe he was kind, a gentle soul who was the picture of peace? He had many visions of how the mysterious Harry Potter would appear to him in his first year and his parents often humored him. Sometimes they shared glances that Cedric never understood, never bothered to because his mind was so taken by the mysterious Potter boy.</p>
<p>It was a bit obsessive at first, some of his own housemates would agree with this statement as they jokingly referred to him as the PotterPedia but that would eventually die down as his schooling became important. Of course, in his off time, his mind would drift to the mysterious boy and sometimes he would remember that it was simply a matter of time before the boy wonder would attend Hogwarts. But those thoughts would leave as soon as they came, pleasing his father was soon becoming a much more important goal than the what if’s and how’s of a young Potter boy.</p>
<p>In fact, it was all forgotten until the entrance ceremony of the new first years during his third year at Hogwarts. He was joking around with his friends until Mathieu, a young Frenchman and one of his closest friends, slid in besides him with a look that was up to no good.</p>
<p>“Oh- I know that bloody look anywhere, what is it LeBeau?” Another one of his housemates, Nick, spoke up giving the other a look.</p>
<p>“Language.” Cedric chided, all in good fun as his friends laughed and gave him playful nudges.</p>
<p>“You won’t believe it! According to some of the second years, Ced’s lil idol is in this batch of first years!” It’s just a rumor and the intensity of it is almost comedic with how thick Mathieu’s accent is.</p>
<p>His surrounding friends and housemates are laughing, it’s friendly camaraderie at its finest and Cedric is inclined to laugh along with them until what he’s said finally settles in.</p>
<p><em>‘Idol? Who could that be?’ </em>Apparently, the confusion was clear on his face, brows furrowed in mild confusion and a girl, Lizzie, gives him a shove on his shoulders.</p>
<p>“Don’t play fool, Diggory. Dear Merlin, you literally counted down days until Mr. Boy Wonder got here during your first year!” It’s all in playful fun but Cedric can’t help the bright flushing of his cheeks at the notion. Could anyone blame him? Harry Potter was the boy of legends!</p>
<p>“Oh, bug off Liz. I cannot be the only person who was eager to meet him, and I did NOT count down the days.” He retorts, the words dying off his tongue the longer he spoke. The look she gave him didn’t do much to help him either.</p>
<p>Before more could be said to save his own pride or before more jokes could be said, the doors opened to the Great Hall with the newest first years. They were all so young, eyes wide with curiosity as they all marched down to the stage of the hall. The third year can’t help but look over all the faces, looking for the one he’s been dreaming of for so long. He has no real image of Harry in his mind but he’s sure that the boy would have something, <em>anything</em> about him that would show the world who he was.</p>
<p>Grey eyes search frantically but find nothing, there’s too many faces to look through and they’re all so far away as well. So, with a huff, he sits back down on his bench and waits in hopes that his name will be spoken when the students are called to take a seat with the Sorting Hat.</p>
<p>Names are called, some are of known families like the Malfoys and Weasleys, others are new like Granger. Each house celebrates their victory in securing a new member with cheers and laughter.</p>
<p>And then <em>his</em> name is called.</p>
<p>“Harry Potter!”</p>
<p>The school goes silent and Cedric feels his heart stop, his breath is caught as he looks over to see the vision of his obsession. Harry looks nothing like what he imagined but he’s also everything Cedric could have pictured. He’s small, confused with a scrawny frame as round glasses frame his face. Cedric can barely spot the important details like his eye color, the flush of his cheeks as he scrunches his face, but it doesn’t matter. Not when the hat has declared his house</p>
<p>“<em>Gryffindor!</em>”</p>
<p>It’s fitting and he can’t find it upsetting to not have Harry in his house. Harry Potter was the poster boy of Gryffindor before he was of age to attend. Harry Potter is brave, courageous and determined. He is all that and so much more. Cedric doesn’t have to have known his story to say that, he can see it in the way the young wizard carries himself in the halls after the ceremony.</p>
<p>The weeks that pass are a blink in time, Cedric is left in awe every time he finds himself witnessing Harry Potter and all he is.  Because where Harry lacks in height and in physical form, he makes up for it in personality and his expressions. Such as right now, Cedric had turned a corner to make his way to his potions class and he was sure that Snape would have his head for arriving late, but he couldn’t help it.</p>
<p>Malfoy had been trying to corner Harry, his two goons backing up the prat’s empty threats while Harry stood there looking scared. At least, that’s what Cedric had assumed but as he took a step closer, he realized he was wrong and a fool.</p>
<p>“Really, Malfoy. Pick new material with your bullying, I get that’s hard being original, but you should try it sometime.” The insult flowed so easily from Harry’s lips, almost like a spell and it had Malfoy sputtering like an idiot.</p>
<p>“Potter- You-“Malfoy could hardly get a word out, face turning red in anger and embarrassment and so Cedric decided that perhaps he should step in now.</p>
<p>“Picking on your peers now, Malfoy?” Cedric asked, voice clear and composed despite the nerves he felt at slowly becoming closer to Harry. The Slytherin seems shocked by his appearance but Cedric isn’t a prefect or Head Boy, he poses no threat and so he must appear like a threat of some sort. He stands tall which seems to be enough, seems like young Draco hasn’t gotten to learn who is a prefect and who isn’t. Which wouldn’t matter regardless, Cedric is a third year and he has a few years to go before he can even think of becoming one.</p>
<p>“This isn’t over, Potter.” Malfoy spits out and Harry is just as unimpressed as he was before.</p>
<p>“What a tragedy.” The boy says, rolling his eyes as Draco walks on by but he pauses in his joy to look back at Cedric.</p>
<p>For the first time, Cedric is breathless looking at Harry Potter.</p>
<p>However, he isn’t met with the look of indifference that was given to the Slytherin boy moments earlier. No, instead there’s eyes that are so green that Cedric could almost fall deep in the forest of them that stare at him with gentle caution before they disappear. Harry’s lips part in a thankful smile as he looks up at the third year, Cedric’s heart is racing against his chest and his cheeks begin to flush pink as he parts his lips to say something, anything to the boy wonder.</p>
<p>“Thanks for that, though I’d watch out for when Malfoy figures out you aren’t a prefect.” Is what Harry tells him, the kid is teasing him if that grin is anything to say as it morphs from grateful to sly within seconds.</p>
<p>Cedric is left gaping like a fish as he watches the way Harry gives his goodbye, walking off toward his next glass. He can’t even find it in himself to be mad when Professor McGonagall strikes him with a detention for standing there like a fool in the hallways. After all, what’s one mark on his record if it meant having to meet Harry Potter himself.</p>
