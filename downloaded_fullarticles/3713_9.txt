    <p>He wasn’t sure how he’d gotten himself in this situation - <em>again</em>. </p>
<p>He’d been minding his own business, having a quick smoke and enjoying the night’s cool air when out of nowhere, he was sprawled out onto the concrete. A heavy weight on his back and rubble biting into his cheek. </p>
<p>By the same dark, vile, creature, that just last night had cost him hours of progress that he now had to make up for by riding through the night. He had been caught unaware and ended up in some kind of trap that was a bitch to break through. </p>
<p>And the disgusting creature hadn’t <em>shut the fuck up</em>. Talking Harry’s ear off until he entertained the idea of just ending it all to get away from the annoying thing. If only for a few peaceful minutes. </p>
<p>But back to the issue at hand, Harry, running only on an hour of sleep and more pepper up potions than was probably safe, he found himself once again dealing with an irritating demon. He really needed to have a little chat with Death. </p>
<p>He mourned the loss of his half smoked cigarette, and scowled as the thing leered into his ear, “Harry Potter, I’ve heard so much about you.”</p>
<p>Merlin, they couldn’t ever keep their traps shut, could they? Perhaps they were lonely? Harry understood that. Especially now that he was on his own, despite the fact it was of his own volition. </p>
<p>Narrowly avoiding a blade in his back, Harry bucked the demon off of him, and refocused on the task at hand.</p>
<p>A fight ensued, and Harry was out of breath and slightly bruised by the time he decided he was done playing defense. </p>
<p>A swift kick to the demon’s knee had it stumbling and sneering at him. It lunged at him, and Harry channeled the magic that thrummed within him. His emerald eyes seemed to take on an unearthly glow, and the demon stumbled, reassessing. </p>
<p>Before it had the chance to make a run for it, Harry hissed the spell that would finish the creature off and finally leave him in peace. Tendrils of black smoke wrapped around the demon, and it cursed and spit, fighting to get away. The smoke caressed it’s way up the creature, paying no heed to the useless struggling and pierced through the demon’s black eyes and mouth, preventing it’s escape. Tendrils squeezed, not unlike a cobra slowly draining the life from its victim. </p>
<p>The demon screams echoed through the motel parking lot, and the wizard felt a sort of cruel satisfaction as it burst into nothingness, banished from the mortal plain. </p>
<p>The sound of something clattering to the ground had him whipping around, face to face with two men who were gaping at him in disbelief. </p>
<p>Harry recognized them almost immediately, as the weapons they carried were a dead giveaway. </p>
<p>Hunters.</p>
<p>“Well, fuck,” Harry said, voice breaking them out of their shock and they pointed their weapons towards him. </p>
<p>Harry was on his motorcycle and disapparating before the bullet could ever pierce him, and all that was left were the two hunters and the smell of sulfur from the demon he had banished.</p>
<p>He seriously didn’t know how he ended up in these situations.</p>
<p>Death was surely laughing at his expense.</p>
