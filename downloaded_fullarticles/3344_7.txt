  <span>Lily groaned as she opened her eyes, thoughts of the night before flooding back.  Marly insisting she take advantage of her rare night off. Going to the club, drinking, dancing, flirting with the man with uncontrollable hair, dancing with him, kissing him, the way his hands felt on her body, the way his lips felt on her hot skin, brazenly suggesting they get a taxi, his fingers running up her thighs, creeping higher and higher in the back seat of the taxi, her gasp as his fingers brushed over her knickers.  The pair of them stumbling through her front door as they kissed with a frantic fervour. Discarded clothes trailing down the hallway and into her bedroom. The feeling of him pressed against her body as he pushed her against the wall as he kissed down her neck, across her collarbone, down her chest. Pushing him backwards to the bed and straddling his body as he lay sprawled underneath her, kissing him, his hands palming her breasts, squeezing and caressing them.  Growing bold and kissing her way down his body, taking him in her mouth, him calling out her name as he exploded in her mouth before pulling her back up, kissing her deeply, flipping her over. His tounge dancing over her clit, fingers joining the party, building her up and up and up before she crashed over the cliff once, twice. More kissing, him pressing into her, their joint desperation driving them to a joint climax way to quickly. The way he felt pressed against her back as he spooned her as they drifted off.  The way she now missed the heat of his skin on hers. </span>
