          <div class="userstuff"><p>Bellatrix raises her wand. She spews the worst of the <em>Unforgivable Curses</em> on you.</p>
<p>Your body shudders as pain spreads through your veins.</p>
<p>You collapse, defeated by that unbearable torment.</p>
<p>Your hair, once brown and wavy, scatters on the cold stone floor like the fragments of a shattered vase.</p>
<p>Your hazel irises wear a watery glaze as you drift into madness.</p>
<p>Somewhere else, in another time, I would have rebelled against this shame. I would have stood as the paladin of your cause.</p>
<p>But I’m just Draco Malfoy.</p>
<p>I turn my eyes the other way.</p>
<p>I pretend I can’t feel your fragile frame getting torn apart by insanity. I pretend I can’t perceive the cries of agony that are smashing your chest.</p>
<p>I’m a coward, a craven.</p>
<p>I hear your tense lips calling for another man.</p>
<p>My soul shatters as well.</p></div>
