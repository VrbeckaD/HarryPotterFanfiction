    <p>“But, I just don’t get why we have to go out to watch it when we could just watch it on our television.” Draco complained.</p><p>“Because it’ll be fun,” Harry tried to persuade his boyfriend. “It’ll be on a huge screen and they’ll have speakers everywhere, so it’ll be amazing, and have I told you about all of the visual effects and 3D effects that they have? I mean I’ve never even heard of anything like this before.”</p><p>Draco continued staring at Harry, unimpressed. “Do you have any idea how unhygienic and crowded that place is going to be? We’re going for the first day first show of this movie.”</p><p>“Come on, Draco, I’ve always wanted to watch a movie in the movie theatre. I never got to watch in while I was at Hogwarts and certainly not before that and you know how hard it was for me after the war, I wouldn’t even get out of my bed.” Harry explained.</p><p>“Alright then, just for you,” Draco said softly, biting on his lip. Then as an afterthought, he added with a scowl, “but it better be worth it, Potter.”</p><p>Harry practically lit up as soon as Draco agreed and nodded his head repeatedly. “I promise you’ll love it. You won’t regret this.” Looking at the pure joy on Harry’s face and the enthusiasm with which he started preparing to go out, Draco didn’t think he could ever feel any hint of regret for agreeing to go to a movie with him.</p><p>Harry decided to wear casual muggle clothing and wasn’t the slightest bit surprised at Draco’s insistence of donning a more formal outfit. They apparated a safe distance away from the movie theatre and then walked the rest of the distance to it. Even though they were holding hands, fingers entwined into each other’s, Draco had to walk fast to keep up with Harry, who had almost broken into a jog from the moment that they had landed in that isolated alleyway a couple of blocks away.</p><p>“Harry, I think you should slow down, love,” Draco said finally, when he felt Harry pulling him along with him. “The movie isn’t going to start for another twenty minutes. We’ll have plenty of time after buying the tickets-”</p><p>“And popcorn!” Harry exclaimed</p><p>“-And popcorn-” Draco reluctantly added, “-to roam around inside the place and find our seats, alright?”</p><p>“Alright,” Harry eased up on his walking speed and walked alongside Draco.</p><p>When they finally reached the theatre, Harry was in awe of the place and even Draco had to admit that he was actually extremely excited to watch this movie. In fact it had been him who had first shown Harry the trailer and insisted that they watch the movie. Harry had simply suggested that they go watch it in a movie theatre and then the idea had stayed stuck in his brain, making him ask Draco to actually go there with him.</p><p>Both the boys ((YES I WILL ALWAYS CALL THEM BOYS EVEN THOUGH THEY’RE PROBABLY GROWN ASS MEN!!!)) took their seats a few minutes before the movie was supposed to start, a large bucket of popcorn propped up in between their legs.</p><p>“Whoa!” Draco said, letting out a gasp as movie trailers started showing on the screen. He fiddled with his 3D glasses absent-mindedly as he realised that Harry had been right. This experience was definitely a lot more different than when they were at home watching movies on their television.</p><p>His attention was caught by the raven-haired boy sitting next to him as he felt Harry’s hand sliding into his own. He looked at Draco, wide eyed and with an expression full of amazement. Draco’s own expressions were full of wonder.</p><p>“It’s really big isn’t it?” Harry whispered, leaning in and speaking in Draco’s ear.</p><p>“It is,” Draco agreed and unable to help it, caught Harry’s lips in a soft kiss.</p><p>Harry felt his cheeks heating up, his lips tugging upward in a smile, but before he had a chance to deepen the kiss, Draco pulled away and his focus shifted back to the big screen. Harry’s smile widened slightly and his gaze lingered on Draco for a few seconds before shifting to the screen in front of them.</p><p>They both watched the movie with a fascination only those who’ve never watched it before can muster, tightening and loosening their grips on each other during certain scenes, some scenes even eliciting noises from them like tiny gasps and shocked inhales of breath, exhales of relief and even a few unexpected laughs.</p><p>The movie was an action-packed thriller, a genre which both the boys loved, and there were times when Harry found himself closing his eyes to look away from the screen in slight fear, hiding in Draco’s shoulder or sliding down in his seat until he could no longer see the screen. He even hid behind the bucket of popcorn that he was holding once.</p><p>Draco, on the other hand, made it through the movie, relatively unscathed, and remained unaffected if you ignored the couple of flinches that he gave throughout the movie, and the amused looks he passed when his boyfriend got scared or a bit emotional. He knew that he would remind Harry about it later but at that moment, he was content to hold his boyfriend close to him and let him feel and express his emotions. After the movie ended, both Harry and Draco ranted happily, playing out and analyzing certain scenes from the movie, wondering and discussing about how different the scenes would have been if they had just used magic, and arguing about their favourite characters and how they had both loved the movie for a variety of reasons as they walked out of the theatre.</p><p>“So, was it worth it?” Harry asked when they finally apparated back to their home. He got a questioning glance from Draco in return and decided to elaborate on what he meant. “The movie,” he said, “Did you enjoy it?”</p><p>“Of course,” Draco said, without a hint of hesitation. “I loved it.” What he had loved even more though, was Harry’s reaction to, not just the movie but everything; the whole evening had been a success.</p><p>“I love <em>you</em>,” Harry replied simply, and before Draco could register his response, pulled him in for a deep, passionate kiss, the one he had wanted to give him and continue with back at the theatre. “You stupid prat,” he spoke pulling away, “don’t think you’ll get away without an ‘I told you so.’”</p><p>“I hate you Potter,” Draco groaned as Harry went up the whiteboard they’d attached to the side of the wall and added a point to his side of the board. It was where they kept score of all of their ‘I told you so’s. They hadn’t decided on what they would do with the points yet as they’d just started with the system, but Draco was sure that his creative Slytherin mind could come up with quite a few things that the winner and loser could do. “But I love you too, you sappy, sentimental git,” Draco said with an exasperated sigh.</p><p>Harry couldn’t help kissing him yet again.</p>
