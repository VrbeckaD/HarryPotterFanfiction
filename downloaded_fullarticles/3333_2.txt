    <p>A sigh escaped Albus Dumbledore as he sat back in the uncomfortable chair.  A heaviness pressed down onto his heart as he studied the young woman next to him gravely, knowing there was very little he could say to convince her to change her plans.  Plans, he admitted, were quite well put together, even with the complexity.  Though he did not know why he was surprised; when push comes to shove, Slytherins always did seem to find a way to work things in their favor.</p>
<p>“There are other ways…” he started, knowing it was a futile attempt.  She shook her head immediately, even as he spoke.</p>
<p>“No, Professor,” she argued calmly.  “There isn’t.  I cannot follow the orders of a mad man who will bring only devastation to our society, but I would never be able to fight against my brother and our friends.  Not after the many protections they afforded me growing up, what with the not so desired traits I seem to have.  No, this is the only way.”</p>
<p>Albus nodded sadly, knowing her mind was made.  “Once the spell is cast, Josephine, it may be impossible for it to be revoked.  The complications you require…”</p>
<p>“Are needed,” Josephine interrupted once again.  “I’ve already spent the last few months setting up an entire life outside of the Wizarding World, outside of England.  There is a man waiting for me in London, who I’ve charmed to believe this was the first business trip he took with his new wife.  By tomorrow evening, we will both we on a flight to America.  His family and coworkers are expecting both of us.  Their memory modifying charms were some of the last I intended to cast with my wand, which will be left with my beast of a husband.”</p>
<p>“And,” she added, her voice growing quieter as she placed a hand over her stomach, “I need to protect my child from the terrible beliefs my family and my husband follow.  I will never be safe here, if they knew.  Not even Lucius, for all my brother loves me, will shelter us.”</p>
<p>Wishing he could convince her to allow the Order to protect her, but knowing his efforts would be in vain, Albus nodded as he pulled out his wand.  “I assume you set up credentials in the Muggle world.”</p>
<p>Josephine nodded.  “I did.  Please, Professor.”</p>
<p>There was no more putting it off.  Raising his wand, Albus said, “Goodbye, Josephine.”</p>
<p>Casting the memory modifying charm took longer than usual, as he rebuilt her entire life piece by piece.  When he was finished, he reached over and touched her lightly on her hand.  “Joyce?  Are you quite alright?”</p>
<p>The young woman shook her head, as it to clear a sudden fog.  “Sorry for slipping away like that.  I’m afraid it’s gotten late, and I should be getting back to Hank.  But thank you very much for the lovely chat.  It’s always wonderful to get different perspectives on my favorite art pieces.”</p>
<p>“It was my pleasure,” Albus said as they stood up.  He led her out of the small room in the library and to the exit where she gave him one last wave before stepping out into the misty weather.  He watched as she disappeared into the night, closing his eyes, and hoped that one day, she would be able to return to the Wizarding World.</p>
