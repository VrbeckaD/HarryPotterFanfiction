    <p>Draco inhaled shakily, his eyes closed heavily. <em>Breathe in, breathe out. You can do this</em>. He slowly blinked his eyes open, fighting the gentle lull. He stood alone in his office, collapsed against his desk, deep grooves beneath his eyes a testament to his twelve hour shift. He smirked into his tea, how fitting that he fought to stay awake as he helped his patients to sleep peacefully, chased away the demons keeping them awake as he himself strove to stay occupied.</p><p>He knocked back the last of the scorching tea, wincing as the heat hit his chest, and tossed the polystyrene cup into the bin across the room. Two more hours and he could traipse home and curl beneath the duvet. But right now he had to meet Mrs Bradding in her latest patient’s room; the shambling Wizard had demanded her attention, barking behind a beard that she was to see him first. So the tired woman had relented, and silently begged Draco with imploring eyes to help.<br/>
The man had arrived around three in the morning, bouncing off the walls with wild eyes and bloodied knuckles. Staff on the lower floors was thin at the best of the times, greedily kept away by patients, and as it often was, it fell to the attending staff of the upper floors to mop up the dregs of the Wizarding society in the early hours.</p><p>Breathing out, Draco strode from his office, biting down on a yawn he couldn’t afford. He stowed his wand into his waistband and made his way into the airy waiting room. Melissa slunk towards him, smiling out of a very tired face. She had also been drafted in for overtime, helping those her department would not touch during the days, but they all had enough of the basic training to clean wounds and bind disfigured limbs.</p><p>‘They’re in Room 46, private room,’ she huffed, patting Draco’s arm as she bled round a corner and vanished. Draco went in the opposite direction and strode through two winding corridors until he had the even numbers he needed.</p><p>’46, here we go,’ Draco said, the bright yellow walls of the hallway too bright for his tired eyes. Four doors down, he promised he’d be in and out and opened the door with the ghost of a greeting on his lips.</p><p>Draco stood still in the doorway, his stomach turned to ice, his mind blank. Mrs Bradding’s glossy eyes stared wide eyed up at him from the floor, the whites of the eyes webbed with blown veins. The old Wizard from before had her chest clamped between his thighs. His spotted hands curled around a silver tray, bringing it down against her skull, pulling it back with a wet slurp and slamming it down repeatedly. Mrs Bradding’s lips parted in a muted sigh, her tongue peeking against the swollen flesh.<br/>
Draco stepped into the room on legs he couldn’t feel. The Wizard’s face turned upwards, his grooved cheeks flecked with the woman’s blood, and his face split into a grin. He bounced backwards onto his heels, dragging Mrs Bradding to his chest as he rose, as though the pair were hugging before he tossed her body away from him. Mrs Bradding fell backwards, the crack of her skull suffocating Draco. He watched her body slide into the corner, her legs kicking out and striking a small cabinet that burst open with the impact. Vials, beakers, glassware, the whole damn contents of the cabinet lurched outwards littering the tiles.</p><p>‘I. Hate. Woman,’ the man announced, standing hunched, smiling into Draco’s naked fear. ‘Dead nurse. Downstairs. Ha, brains!’</p><p>Draco stepped forwards, his mind befuddled. He breathed in the rancid stench of copper, of his friend’s imminent death and followed the scent.</p><p>A small part of his mind wickedly told him that this wasn’t uncommon. Staff were often attacked, physically and verbally. Angry, bitter people. Entitled and animalistic. But Mrs Bradding could deal with the dregs, couldn’t she? She would talk them down, open them up. They weren’t supposed to pull open her head, spill her out upon the floor she walked every day.</p><p>The door swung shut behind Draco, clicking ominously, locked. The Wizard limped towards him and Draco didn’t even see his pale fist crunch into the man’s nose before hands with too much strength pulled him into an ugly embrace. The Wizard sneered through the gushing blood, spitting it as he laughed in Draco’s face.</p><p>‘Expelliarmus!’ and with a hot breath, the wand Draco hadn’t even realised he had taken into his hand left his palm. The wood clattered somewhere in the room.</p><p>‘No,’ Draco finally gasped as his ankle was yanked from beneath him with a quick Levicorpus. The childish spell snagged him, he smacked his back into the floor as he was hoisted upside down in the air. Blood rushed to his head and he awoke from the nightmare. ‘Stop!’ he shouted, his lanyard bouncing off his forehead.</p><p>‘Okay!’</p><p>Draco sucked in a breath when he collided with the floor. He groaned against the humiliation, dazed as old bones climbed up his torso.</p><p>‘They’ll say you overdosed,’ the Wizard snarled, his twisted mouth panting heavily against Draco’s cheek, he watched the cracked lips shut and close around yellowed teeth. ‘Interrupted me. Me!’<br/>
He sobbed behind his clamped jaw. Gnarled fingers ripped the cork from a bright orange bottle and upended the bottle. The liquid slapped against Draco’s face, filling his nostrils and running off his face. He bucked, squashed beneath the wild patient, refusing to open his mouth as he spluttered the orange liquid from his nostrils.<br/>
‘Open. Your. Mouth,’ the Wizard demanded, ramming his fingers beneath Draco’s jawline, pushing the pointed digits until Draco’s mouth fell open with a cry.<br/>
More hot liquid filled Draco’s mouth and he gagged as it hit the back of his throat, thrashing wildly. He slammed his head backwards and spat with all his might. His potion hit the attacker square in the face and the man fell backwards in shock. Draco slithered out of the hold, panting and trembling. The familiar taste of a specially brewed concoction of his like bile in his mouth. He skittered to the corner of the room, his hands pawing at the unconscious Mrs Bradding. A small bead of blood ran from an exposed ear and Draco screamed.</p><p>The overhead lights blew in a shower of glass and plastic. Mrs Bradding remained a crumpled mess, her hair congealed and sticking in a clump Draco dared not touch. He crouched over her body, grey eyes focused on the patient turned attacker, he trembled and coughed heavily.</p><p>‘I killed the bitch!’ The Wizard laughed gleefully, clapping his hands loudly in the sudden silence.</p><p>Draco stood slowly, uncurling his body and breathing deeply. The man continued to clap, limping towards the door. ‘I’ll kill them all. Dead. Yes. Dead’</p><p>‘Take-another step-and I will bring this hospital down on your head!’ Draco spoke, his body tensing as the old Wizard’s fingers curled around the door handle. They locked eyes as the door opened. The Wizard smirked maliciously and Draco moved like lightning, he sprang forwards, his robes flowing behind him, he pivoted on his heel and slammed his palm into the old man’s back. The Wizard crumpled through the open doorway, falling face first into the arms of Harry Potter.</p><p>Green eyes widened as Harry went tumbling backwards, the old man’s teeth sinking into his right arm, tearing into the flesh.</p><p>‘Potter,’ Draco breathed, sliding backwards against a wave of sudden magic. It pulsed and ebbed against him, nudging him backwards and into the safety of the upturned room. He pushed against the barrier, slamming his fist into the ripples. ‘Potter!’</p><p>‘D-Draco-‘</p><p>Draco spun around as Mrs Bradding croaked his name. He dropped to his knees, cradling the woman’s bruised hands. They clamped around his own, pulled him in. Mrs Bradding pulled herself into her colleague, her head resting upon Draco’s trousers, a sickening warmth saturating the fabric.</p><p>‘Don’t talk,’ Draco hissed, his throat raw with rising panic. With an arm curled around his mentor, his free hand fished into her robe pockets. He plucked her small twisted wand, swallowing his fear he pressed the tip to the worst of the matted hair. <em>‘T-Tergeo</em>’ he whispered and Mrs Bradding sighed contently, ‘<em>Vulnera Saentur’</em> he sung into the mess of her head, tears pricking his eyes as the retched sound of skin reknitting burned into his brain. She sunk further into his legs, her breathing steady, heavy. Draco dropped the wand quickly, closing his eyes to the memories the words conjured. He resisted the urge to scratch at his chest.<br/>
Draco began to shudder again then. A stranger had just tried to kill him. Mrs Bradding lay in his lap waiting for Death to knock at her door, the magic weaving skin and bone. Draco was sick to his back teeth. How dare a delusional patient shamble into Mrs Bradding’s arms for aid and strike her down with those very fists she brought healing to?</p><p>Draco shrugged his stained medical robes from his shoulders and fashioned a pillow beneath his friends cracked skull, climbing to his feet when she settled into the fabric. He rolled his neck once, twice. Popped his shoulders. Shrugged off the fear and strode through the magical barrier. It popped and crackled around him, rushing past his seeking arms.</p><p>‘Get that <em>thing </em>out of my fucking face, Potter’ Draco spat as soon as he had cleared the threshold and stood in the hallway alive with noise. He ground his teeth and ignored the squad of healers and security dog-piling on the Wizard before him. Harry jumped at the misdirected anger, his fingers squeezed around a bicep. ‘I’m going home before another lunatic tries to kill me, or my friends. My shift is over’.</p><p>‘Wait!’ Harry begged, snatching Draco’s wrist in a clammy hand. ‘Are you hurt? Malfoy, talk to me’</p><p>Draco flinched away, pulling his arm towards his chest. ‘How did you know?’</p><p>‘Melissa found an injured nurse downstairs-described the patient Mrs Bradding was seeing to-,’ Harry threw a disgusted look at the dishevelled man growling beneath the bodies atop him, his jaw clacking. ‘Lucky she’s so damn quick huh’.</p><p>Draco nodded slowly, the adrenaline he had barely felt now evaporating. ‘Everything happened so quickly,’ he mused, stepping away, ‘her head-‘ he shook his head, his eyes following colleagues from floors below now rushing into the room, shouting instructions.</p><p>‘Potter, I need to go home’.</p><p>Harry extended a crooked arm, ‘Let me take you home, Malfoy. You look like shit’. Draco arched an eyebrow, biting down on a sarcastic remark.</p><p>‘Accio wand,’ Draco sighed, catching the wand with a twirl of his slender fingers. He pointedly ignored the offered arm and bumped his shoulder against Harry’s, sagging slightly. ‘This should be enough contact’.</p><p>‘You’re going to let me?’</p><p>‘Just fucking take me home,’ Draco sniped, ‘we both know you know where I live,’ he carried on, blushing in the face of Harry’s full blown flush. The Gryffindor stuttered, nodded and pulled them into the vortex of sudden travel.</p><p>‘Ooh,’ Draco hiccupped, sliding his knees into the sheepskin rug, ‘I never can stay on my feet after <em> that’. </em>He shamelessly sunk further into the rug, kneading his hands into the soft pelt.<br/>
Harry stood beside Draco, his eyes roaming around the open planned lounge he suddenly found himself in; his eyes drinking in the foliage dividing the room from the kitchen, the framed sketches upon the walls, a slipper kicked under the grey love seat filled with cushions. The flat felt stylishly homely, muted colours with splashes of colour here and there. Pots and pans stacked high in the sink.</p><p>‘Not quite The Manor, is it?’ Draco murmured from the carpet, now laying on his back with his eyes closed. ‘I can practically hear your brain going, ‘but where are the skulls?’’</p><p>Harry snorted loudly, his cheeks flushing for a second time. ‘It’s so-‘</p><p>‘If you say <em>Muggle</em> I will shove my wand up your nose,’ groaned Draco, crossing his ankles. ‘You grew up with Muggles, surely you must realise that not everything is divided between us and them. Just because I live in a flat, doesn’t make it a <em>Muggle </em>flat. Oh, I’m so tired I’m actually rambling...’</p><p>Harry yawned into his hand, the bite on his arm disinfected and forgotten for the moment. Since the men had called a truce, he had begun to see Draco in a more human light, realised that he too had little quirks he had come to know. As he glanced down at the man napping at his feet, Harry swallowed the word friend and gently kicked a loafer.</p><p>‘Oi, lazy. Go to bed at least’. Draco grumbled in response, throwing a hand over his face. ‘Come on, Draco. You’ll feel stupid waking up on the carpet’.</p><p>‘Not the first time,’ Draco slurred, ‘it’s the potion-‘</p><p>‘Potion? Malfoy, what did you drink?’</p><p>Draco huffed, peeling the hand from his face to crack open a single grey eye. ‘M’attacker made mm drink sleeping draught mhm,’ he yawned wide, inhaling heavily and wiggling himself into the pelt. ‘Had to get ommm can’t stay awake’.</p><p>Harry drew lines in the air, flicking the wordless spell dramatically. Draco jostled upwards, pillows and blankets rolling beneath him. He nestled into the abundance of sudden bedding and began to snore softly, a leg splayed around a long pillow, his arms bare and thrown wide.<br/>
The men had still not quite seen eye to eye over the last few months, but they’d laughed occasionally and Harry decided that he couldn’t allow his colleague to accidentally die in his sleep at least. If the attacker had truly spiked Draco with a concoction he had brewed, then it wasn’t safe to leave him unmonitored Harry mused crawling in beside the man.<br/>
He pulled a thin duvet over Draco and swaddled himself in a blanket, sending his robes away as an afterthought. Harry tucked himself into a foetal position, grateful he had worn a pair of tracksuit bottoms to his nightshift and not his usual jeans.</p><p>‘Sleep well, Draco,’ Harry whispered, staring hard at the faint outline of a plant pot until his eyes drifted shut. A cold hand snaked across his chest and Harry’s breath caught in his chest at the contact. Draco’s fingers curled into Harry’s shirt and tugged. He rolled with the motion, bumping his nose into the Draco's chest, his glasses crooked. His heart crashed in his chest, a second arm wrapped around Harry until he was cocooned between two toned arms. Harry breathed into the slow rising chest and screwed his eyes shut, begging his heart to calm down, he couldn’t just get up and leave now he told himself as he calmed his breathing.</p><p>‘Thanks,’ Draco exhaled, his breathe tickling Harry’s scar, and his washed out face now calm and content.</p><p>‘You’re welcome,’ Harry replied, failing to fight the small smile tugging at his lips. He closed his eyes to the comfort and curled his arms around Draco’s back, pulling the man closer and into his warmth. He exhaled slowly and matched his breathing to the slow sigh of Draco's, thankful he would sleep soundly tonight.</p>
