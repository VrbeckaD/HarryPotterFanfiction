  <u>
    <span>CHAPTER 1 - I’ll Face It With A Grin</span>
  </u>
</p><p><span>All of summer had come and gone since she and Severus had ended their friendship. To put it lightly. ‘</span><em><span>Had a major fucking row and the whole friendship thing between them had truly gone tits up</span></em><span>’ was a little more accurate, but Lily Evans was nothing if not positive. Severus Snape had been a good friend to her in their youth it had seemed. All things considered though, using underage magic to hit her sister with a massive tree branch should have been a warning signal that maybe this boy wasn’t going to turn out to be the nicest of friends, but he knew about magic and why Lily could do what she could. So, </span><em><span>of</span></em> <em><span>course</span></em><span> she had latched onto the boy who revealed all she ever wanted to know about the Wizarding World. </span><em><span>What a shame. </span></em><span>No amount of smiles and brave faces could hide that fact that Lily still hurt when she walked past Severus as she climbed aboard the Hogwarts Express on September 1st. She had felt his piercing stare but held her head high and ignored him, instead pushing herself to stand between Marlene McKinnon and Mary Macdonald (a.k.a her two best friends). Marlene glanced behind them when she spotted how Lily had stiffened and immediately slung her arm around the redhead's shoulders. </span></p><p>
  <span>“What an arse.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hmm?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Snape. He’s an arse.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh. Yes. He is.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Mary snorted at the brief discussion between her two friends and Lily couldn’t help but finally crack a smile. Sure, Sev had broken her to pieces with his derogatory language and weak attempt to apologise for what he had done, but that did not mean that Lily shouldn’t be happy. In fact, she had cut a toxic person out of her life, she definitely </span>
  <em>
    <span>should </span>
  </em>
  <span>be happy. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Here, this compartment is free.” Lily said, unlatching the door so that the three girls could enter. Lily cursed internally as she started the painstaking job of hoisting her trunk up onto the rack, she had to wait until </span>
  <em>
    <span>January</span>
  </em>
  <span> to use magic outside of Hogwarts. Then it hit her and she stopped what she was doing. “Hey, Mary? I know it’s your birthday and all but do you maybe want to help  me out here?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What?” The brunette replied, clearly forgetting she was now seventeen, allowing her to do goddamned magic. “Oh shit, right! </span>
  <em>
    <span>Wingardium Leviosa!</span>
  </em>
  <span>” She muttered, and the three trunks slid up onto the racks neatly. Marlene chuckled at her friend as she flung herself onto one of the seats.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Honestly, Macdonald. Every year you brag about your birthday bringing in the start of a new year at Hogwarts and the one year your age is helpful, you forget.” Lily rolled her eyes as Mary bit back at the blonde, settling herself by the window opposite the two of them and watching as Platform 9 and ¾ emptied of students and the train slowly started to roll out of Kings Cross. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oi. Lily.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hmm?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Stop thinking about that good for nothing piece of shit Snape and pay attention.” Marlene grinned, still seated in a ridiculously uncomfortable-looking position on the train seat. “How long do we have you for before you’re required to join the rest of the goody-two-shoes in the Prefects’ compartment?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh... “ Lily glanced down to check her watch, her mind still fixated on the word </span>
  <em>
    <span>mudblood </span>
  </em>
  <span>being repeated in Severus’ voice. “The meeting is at 11:30, so about twenty-five minutes? I will need to get into my uniform before then.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nothing we haven’t seen before.” Mary grinned at Lily, who smiled softly back. She really should have cheered up, it being Mary’s birthday and all. But summer had been so different this year, usually she had Severus to distract her from the wickedness of her sister and the dull existence that was her muggle life when away from school. But the summer of ‘76 had been so boring, painful and she’d had to endure Petunia and her boyfriend, Vernon (or Vermin, as she had so aptly nicknamed him the year before), almost every day. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>To Lily’s surprise, the twenty-five minutes passed fairly quickly. It was filled mainly with Mary and Marlene bickering but that had always been entertaining to watch. The two were closer friends with each other than Lily was with either of them, and they were constantly at each other’s throats. But their debates were always fun. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>At 11:20, Lily tugged her Gryffindor robes over her head and affixed her prefect badge above her left breast (as regulation stated). She tightened her tie and fluffed out her hair. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Lovely as always, Lil.” Marlene said, winking at the red-head.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lily chuckled and slid her bag over her shoulder. “I should be back well before we get to Hogwarts, but just in case for some reason the meeting over runs-”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Can we please take your trunk to the carriages? We know the drill, sweetcheeks.” Marlene responded with a grin. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes… Thanks.” Lily smiled back and at 11:23 she left the compartment, preparing herself for the inevitable onslaught of kids still trying to find a free compartment. She drew a deep breath, then pushed forwards, slowly but surely making her way through the crowds. She got knocked, bumped and at one point, almost launched through the narrow corridors of the steam train. She had nearly made it to the Prefects’ compartment when she slammed into something tall, lean and definitely human. Slowly, she looked up to see… James Potter? Clearly Potter had had a growth spurt over summer as last year he hadn’t been all that much taller than her. It had been only a few inches between them but now it seemed like a whole foot. Her eyes widened; he had definitely won the jackpot between fifth and sixth year. Any hint of boyhood, except perhaps the ever-present messiness of his hair, was gone and replaced with a </span>
  <em>
    <span>man</span>
  </em>
  <span>. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh… Potter… Sorry for, well-”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Almost sweeping me off my feet, Evans?” He grinned back at her, his hand sinking into the thick mess of hair on his head. “Don’t worry, I’ll find it within me to forgive you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lily’s eyes narrowed. An interaction with Potter where the first words out of his mouth weren’t ‘</span>
  <em>
    <span>go out with me</span>
  </em>
  <span>’? Something really </span>
  <em>
    <span>must</span>
  </em>
  <span> have happened over summer.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, well, sorry for knocking into you like that but I really should be getting to my meeting.” She said, pushing a loose strand of hair out of her face as she checked her watch. “So if you wouldn’t mind letting me past, Potter. I don’t want to be late.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Right you are.” He smiled genuinely, stepping aside. “Want me to yell at all these hooligans to make you a path?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Probably to Potter’s surprise, Lily let out a small chuckle. “Thanks for the offer, Potter, but I’ll gratefully decline. I shouldn’t act like I’m superior or anything.” And to </span>
  <em>
    <span>Lily’s</span>
  </em>
  <span> surprise, she lifted a hand to pat his arm. “I’ll see you at the feast later!” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She caught the gobsmacked look on Potter’s face as she brushed past him and expected that she wore a similar expression. Had she really just had a decent conversation with James fucking Potter, the boy who had been the bane of her life for the past five years? Shaking her head, Lily tugged on her ponytail before sliding open the compartment door to join the prefect meeting. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Bloody James Potter....</span>
  </em>
</p>
<hr/><p>
  <span>A flash of red hair and then she was gone, swallowed up by the swarming masses of students still filling the corridor of the Hogwarts Express. James Potter couldn’t help but grin as his hand tugged on the messy tangle of his hair. Lily Evans never failed to amaze him. Never once had she been so friendly with him before, not even on their first train ride to Hogwarts. Of course, that was when Snivellus was still corrupting her opinions. James scoffed quietly as he remembered that day all those years ago on this very train, sharing a compartment with Snape and Evans, hearing the greasy-haired slimeball try to convince the lovely redhead that </span>
  <em>
    <span>Slytherin </span>
  </em>
  <span>was the best house.</span>
  <em>
    <span> As if…</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Some asshole kid jolted into him then, breaking out of his reverie. Coughing slightly, James shook the nostalgic thoughts away and shoved his hands into his pockets, nudging the compartment door next to him open. He hardly noticed Sirius and Peter sitting on the floor of the compartment, engrossed in a game of Exploding Snap, as he stepped over them and the game to slump in the seat next to the window. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>His head full of Lily Evans, a large grin still gracing his lips, his eyes fixed on the rolling countryside as the train continued its journey towards the castle. Her voice at a normal decibel was music to his ears, he wasn’t entirely sure if he had ever heard her speak directly to him when she wasn’t yelling at him or telling him off before. And she had… She’d </span>
  <em>
    <span>patted his arm… </span>
  </em>
  <span>Merlin’s beard, he needed to think about something else or the train journey could have turned </span>
  <em>
    <span>very</span>
  </em>
  <span> embarrassing very quickly, especially with Sirius not even a foot away. Holding back a groan, James lifted his feet onto the seat opposite him so he could stretch his legs out. While there had been some benefits to his sudden growth spurt over the summer, confined leg spaces was not one of them. </span>
</p><p><span>James had apparently not noticed that he was fiddling with the sleeve of his jumper, as Sirius let out a snort of laughter. Fiddling was ‘James code’ for thinking about Lily. Every single damn time. Even when he was looking</span> <span>at her or talking</span> <span>to her, he was always fiddling with some form of clothing. Sirius had spotted it in first year, and had taken it upon himself to ridicule James ever since. </span></p><p>
  <span>“Evans?” Sirius’ voice rang out, cutting through the sound of gentle pops from the game of Exploding Snap.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Evans.” Peter replied, making a fruitless attempt to conceal a snigger.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hmm?” James hummed, his eyes moving from the greenery of the Scottish highlands to look at his two friends. He hadn’t </span>
  <em>
    <span>really </span>
  </em>
  <span>been listening, but hearing them both utter ‘Evans’ had pulled him from his daydream. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Bloody hell, Prongs.” Sirius laughed, seeing the slightly glazed look in James’ eyes. “Did the girl agree to marry you or something? You look positively fuckstruck.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, she just didn’t yell at me for once.” James shrugged, not noticing his thumb scratching at the loose threads of a rip in his jeans. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And </span>
  <em>
    <span>that </span>
  </em>
  <span>has you grinning like you’ve just won the Quidditch World Cup by playing every position yourself against a team of seven professional players?” Sirius rolled his eyes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nice choice of idiom there, Padfoot.” James sighed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Like the cat got the cream!” Peter piped in, picking up the cards to reset the game. Clearly he had clocked that it was time to tease James for his affections. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t encourage him, Wormy.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t look so pathetic then, Prongs.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius let out a bark of laughter at Peter’s comment, clapping the mousy-haired boy on the back with unbridled glee. James, however, slouched in his chair, crossing his arms and working on a scathing scowl. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Bastards.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, don’t be such a drama queen, Prongs. That’s </span>
  <em>
    <span>my</span>
  </em>
  <span> job.” Sirius smirked, still laughing slightly. “At least Evans seems to have finally warmed up to you now that you’ve hit puberty properly.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah!” Peter chimed in, sucking a small burn on his finger he had gotten from shuffling the pack of cards. “Maybe you’ll manage to get her to go out with you this year.” Both James and Sirius gave Peter an unconvinced glance. Sure, James fancied the hell out of Evans, but he didn’t believe for one second that she might change her mind anytime soon and agree to go out with him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Bit of stretch on that one, Wormtail.” Sirius shrugged, and James sighed once more. Of course his best friend knew that he had zero chance with Lily Evans. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Bloody fantastic. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sod off, the pair of you.” James muttered, his eyes still narrowed in a scowl as his friends mocked him for liking a girl. Sirius and Peter responded with nothing more than a snigger before returning to their game and changed the subject of conversation to how Lucinda Talkalot had been made captain of the Slytherin Quidditch team that year. Or something along those lines. James had returned to staring out the window, his mind full of longful snapshots of an unlikely future where Evans fell for him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yes, Evans finding him boyfriend material was unlikely, but maybe, just maybe, they could become friends. After the fiasco at the end of last term with Snape where James and Sirius had toed way over the line, James had realised he needed to tone down the way he spoke to Evans. His tormenting of Snivellus that day had resulted in Evans being the one to get hurt and Remus had insisted over the holidays that James needed to apologise and treat Evans like a human being (which is precisely what she was, not a game). So James decided to stop acting like such a prat the coming year, grow more mature and not pull any more pranks. Or… Well, not pull as </span>
  <em>
    <span>many </span>
  </em>
  <span>pranks. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>All that accompanied James’ thoughts on the train were the occasional pops and crackles of the game of Exploding Snap and, more often than not, groans coming from Peter as Sirius beat him round after round. Sometimes James’ eyes would drift from the rolling countryside to his friends’ game, but never once did his mind drift from Evans. He racked his brain for ideas of how he might be able to win her over into being his friend. Clearly they could be friendly, was it really such a stretch to hope that a glimmer of civility between the two of them could become constant? All James knew was that he didn’t want to exist in a world where he could not see Evans at least a few times a week. He had grown accustomed to her over their years together at Hogwarts. Accustomed to her fiery hair brushing past him in corridors, to the light tones of her voice reaching him from across the common room - or usually screaming at him for some stupid prank or attempt to ask her out yet again. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>James knew that Lily Evans falling for his charms was one in a million, so he recognised that he had to resign himself to keeping her close as nothing more than a friend. Unless of course she decided she wanted more than friendship from him. In which case, well… He’d be hard-pressed to deny her of that. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The door to the compartment slid open after Merlin knew how long. James’ eyes flicked up to see the fourth and final Marauder in the doorway. Well, his back anyway. Remus Lupin appeared to be talking to someone and James’ heart leapt when he caught a glimpse of dark red hair disappearing after Remus had said his goodbyes. The door slid closed behind him when Remus entered the compartment. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Was that Evans?” James asked as soon as the sandy-haired boy took a seat, his scarlet prefect badge gleaming against the black of his school robes. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh for the love of Merlin’s bollocks, Moony.” Sirius groaned. “He only just shut up about your lovely prefect companion.” He tossed down his hand of cards, evidently irate that the conversation was back to Lily. Peter snickered and began packing up the deck of cards, one of his eyebrows now significantly more blackened than the other and appeared to be smoking slightly. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Remus rolled his eyes, seeming to have expected this to happen as soon as he sat down. “We were only discussing which of us is going to lead the first years to the Common Room after the feast tonight, Prongs. You know, since we’re both prefects. That’s all.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah. Right. Of course.” James muttered, not even trying to hide his disappointment. Any shred of hope he had that Remus being friends with Lily would help his recent move to find a place in her life drained out of him pretty quickly. He sighed, his hand once again finding its way to his head and returning to his usual habit of messing up his hair. </span>
  <em>
    <span>“See you at the feast tonight.” </span>
  </em>
  <span>What did that mean? Why did girls have to be so goddamn complicated? </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius let out an audible tut and finally pulled himself up from the floor to slouch on the seat next to James, pushing his best friend’s arm. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Stop moping, Prongs. What’s so different about this year to the past five?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She- She got hurt last year.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What? With Snape?” Sirius scoffed, rolling his eyes while Remus cringed from the other side of the carriage. “Good riddance, surely you’re happy Evans and Snivellus aren’t chummy anymore.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Remus attempted to interrupt Sirius, before James had a chance to respond. But James was too quick. Rising to his feet in anger, his brows furrowed and eyes blazing, he turned to look at Sirius. His friend was still smirking, evidently underestimating just how much he had managed to piss James off this time.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re so fucking oblivious aren’t you?” James snapped, glaring at Sirius with unbridled fury. Sirius simply raised an eyebrow in return. “Evans got hurt. That is one thing I don’t </span>
  <em>
    <span>ever </span>
  </em>
  <span>want to happen. I’d gladly take Snape being her maid of honour at her wedding than see Evans with unhappy tears in her eyes. She shouldn’t </span>
  <em>
    <span>ever</span>
  </em>
  <span> have to feel like that, especially not because of someone she trusted enough to be her friend.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>His breathing was heavy as a tension-filled silence spread between the four boys. James saw Peter give Remus a nervous look through the corner of his eye as the air between James and Sirius sparked. But James didn’t care. He was sick of it. Yes, Sirius was his best friend, but this was </span>
  <em>
    <span>Lily. </span>
  </em>
  <span>A sensitive topic to say the least. James may have been a teenage boy with a few bad morals and a tendency to act like a right fucking idiot. But he still had a brain beneath his messy hair and he still had a heart. If Lily Evans was hurt, and if he had a part in it, he would never forgive himself.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius continued to smirk at James and just as he opened his mouth to respond, James swiped up his wand that had fallen from his pocket onto the seat and stepped over Peter. He didn’t care to look back as he slid open the compartment door, stepping out into the now student-free corridor. He sighed deeply. He and Sirius would forget their little spat, probably by the time the train pulled into Hogsmeade station. It wasn’t the first time their two big personalities had clashed, and it certainly wouldn’t be the last. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>James moved over to one of the train windows, sliding it open slightly. His hands braced against the window pane as his eyes closed, his forehead falling to rest against the cold glass. He hated arguing with Sirius, he viewed the boy as a brother, especially since Sirius had ran away from home over the summer, welcomed in by James’ family with open arms. But he had to stand up for what he believed was right. </span>
</p>
<hr/><p>
  <span>The compartment was bustling when she returned from the meeting. It appeared that Mary and Marlene had welcomed many a friend whilst Lily had been away. Every seat was filled with bodies, a loud chatter filling the enclosed space. She hadn’t even walked in the door and she could hear the noise spilling from the compartment. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Absolutely not. </span>
  </em>
  <span>Lily shook her head and turned away, her friends oblivious to the fact she had even made it back from the prefect meeting. She drew in a breath and turned on her heel. She’d rather sit alone, in an abandoned compartment than have to put up with that level of noise. It was times like these that she almost missed the quiet comfort of her friendship with Sev. Until he became a muggle-born hating prick, that is.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>So Lily made her way down the quiet train alone. She hummed lightly under her breath as she walked, twirling her wand between her fingers. She hadn’t noticed that iridescent sparks flew from the tip, resulting in a shimmer of magical glitter settling on her black robes. She was so lost in thought that she nearly walked into him again, but managed to pull herself back to reality when he came into view. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He was tense, she could tell that much. His eyes were squeezed shut, his forehead pressed against the window pane. His fingers were clutching the ledge, his breath fogging up the glass. Lily’s head tilted in fascination. She had never seen him look this way, so troubled. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Merlin… </span>
  </em>
  <span>Against her better judgement, Lily stepped closer. Her hand reached out to lightly rest on his arm, her teeth worrying her lip as she looked at him. Sure, James Potter was an arrogant arse, but Lily hated to see anyone in turmoil.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“James? You alright?”</span>
</p>
<hr/><p>
  <span>James’ head whipped up, so quickly he was almost surprised he didn’t get whiplash. His hazel eyes were wide, but they softened as soon as he realised who she was. A small smile graced his lips, one Lily replicated much to his delight.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Evans… I- Yeah, I’m good.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He could tell she knew he was lying. She wasn’t blind or stupid, she must have noticed the irritation on his face, the rigidity of his shoulders. He was clearly irked about something, and Evans being Evans just had to know what about.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Alright, Potter. We might not be friends, but you don’t need to lie to me. You don’t need to tell me the whole truth either, but don’t say you’re fine when you clearly aren’t.” Lily smiled at him, her thumb absentmindedly rubbing a soothing pattern against his arm. James chuckled and closed his eyes, his head falling as he shook it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I- Sirius and I had a little spat, a stupid thing but I just wanted to get some air.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lily hummed, a small noise that still managed to send a warm shiver down James’ back. </span>
  <em>
    <span>I’m so wrecked for this girl, </span>
  </em>
  <span>James thought as he opened his eyes to look at her once more. It was odd, having the chance to see her this closely without her yelling at him. He could see the small smattering of light freckles across her nose, a slight golden tinge to her skin thanks to the summer sun. Her eyes were so green, flecked with tiny pinpricks of gold that gave them the light he adored so much. Lily Evans was flawed, she wasn’t perfect. But she was beautiful. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Beautiful in such a way that it almost hurts to look. It wasn’t just her features that made her beautiful, but her heart, her soul, the very essence of her being. Lily Evans was a lighthouse and James was a boat that needed her glow to guide him. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Totally wrecked. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“You and Black having an altercation seems unusual and expected all at the same time.” Lily chuckled, her eyes sparkling as the small laugh escaped her. “What was it about? Which of you has the most ridiculous hair? Because </span>
  <em>
    <span>I’d</span>
  </em>
  <span> say you’re at level-pegging.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>James rolled his eyes at this, but couldn’t quite hold back a hum of amusement and the grin that pulled at his lips. But when she raised her eyebrows, clearly expecting him to </span>
  <em>
    <span>actually</span>
  </em>
  <span> answer her, his smile faltered. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I- Uh… I don’t want to say…” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, come on.” Lily laughed, her whole hand wrapping around his bicep and squeezing, resulting in James nearly having a bloody aneurysm. “It’s you and Black, Potter. It can’t have been anything serious, you two couldn’t be mature around each other if you tried.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A snort escaped James before he couldn’t even attempt to stop it. Her comment may have been accurate last year, but the summer holidays had been a rough time for both of the boys. They had been forced to be mature, thanks to Orion Black and his violence. James tried not to wince as he recalled the night Sirius had turned up at Potter Manor, a bruise forming beneath his eye. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“W-Well… I- Uh…”James stammered, chewing on his bottom lip. Lily gave him an encouraging look, a soft smile still gracing her features. He couldn’t hold it back any longer. “It was about you.” He blurted out, his fingers tugging on his tie nervously. He could feel his face burning, especially since Lily then had a look of complete shock on hers, the smile having vanished. Her hand left his arm, leaving an invisible handprint that felt like it was burnt into his flesh.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“M-Me?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah…” James sighed, his hand flying into his hair. “He… Well, he said that I should be glad after what happened last term with Sniv- Uh, Snape.” He managed to correct himself. It was not the time for childish (if not bloody genius and hilarious) nicknames. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Glad?” Lily asked, her eyes narrowing at the mention of the event the previous school year. James held back a wince at her expression, knowing how belittled she must have felt after her attempts to help her friend had led to her being yelled at. And had resulted in her being called </span>
  <em>
    <span>that. </span>
  </em>
  <span>“Why would you be glad?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, er- Sirius seemed to think that I would be happy you and Snape aren’t friends at the moment or at all... I told him to sod off.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lily looked dumbfounded. Her mouth was hanging open slightly, looking as though she was at a loss for words - which she more than likely was. A pregnant pause stifled the air between them, James shuffling uncomfortably as she absorbed the information. A few awkwardly quiet moments passed before she managed to find her voice once again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“S-So why are you out here? Surely that can’t be the </span>
  <em>
    <span>only </span>
  </em>
  <span>reason why you got </span>
  <em>
    <span>so</span>
  </em>
  <span> angry at Black that you left the compartment…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“W-Well, I may have snapped at his comment… A little…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why?” She asked, her head cocking to one side.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You got hurt.” James shrugged. </span>
  <em>
    <span>No holding back now. </span>
  </em>
  <span>“I wouldn’t want you getting hurt for anything. Even if meant that you and Snape were still as close as Merlin’s bollocks, and no matter how much I hate that slimy piece of-”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Potter…” Lily interrupted, a warning look in her eyes. She was clearly </span>
  <em>
    <span>not </span>
  </em>
  <span>amused. “Look, I appreciate that you feel that way, that you apparently </span>
  <em>
    <span>care </span>
  </em>
  <span>enough to want to protect me. But I don’t need you to stand up for me, or shelter me from the crap in life that might come my way. Yes, Sev and I may not be on speaking terms because of what he said, but I can fight my own battles.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James had started to feel very embarrassed, his mouth opening as if to jut in a defensive comment. But the dam had burst, and words just kept spilling out of Lily’s mouth.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Being hurt is a part of life, Potter, no matter how much it may suck. You are </span>
  <em>
    <span>not</span>
  </em>
  <span> my boyfriend, hardly even my </span>
  <em>
    <span>friend. </span>
  </em>
  <span>I have spent all summer trying to forget about that fucking awful day and the way that you, Black and Sev all treated me. I am not </span>
  <em>
    <span>yours </span>
  </em>
  <span>to worry about, Potter, do you understand? Especially not since you and Black were the ones who decided to start the whole shitting thing in the first place.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I-”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Save it.” Lily spat. Eyes blazing, she turned on her heel and stormed down the corridor of the train. She didn’t look back. With a final flash of red hair, she was gone, leaving James well and truly alone. Abashed and completely battered by her words, James sighed. She wasn’t wrong, he had fucked up that day, and he should have apologised for it - rather than attempting to defend his actions by shouting at Sirius. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Resigning himself to an evening of misery, James pulled his eyes from the small cloud of mist that still fogged up the cold window of the train, the last physical trace of Lily in the form of her breath. Her words rung in his ears as he stepped away from the window pane at last, and finally she had gotten through to him. James let out one last sigh, before turning and heading back to his compartment. If he couldn’t make things right with Evans that night, he knew he should at least try to rectify one of his current quarrels. Sirius would definitely understand and accept his apology. But when the time came, would Evans? </span>
  <em>
    <span>Merlin, he hoped so.</span>
