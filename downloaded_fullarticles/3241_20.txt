    <p align="center">The Book</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco didn’t know what to do with himself anymore. His father was in Azkaban for the rest of his life, yet he somehow still had the ability to pressure Draco and make him feel like shit through letters.</p>
<p>Letters like the one he had laying on his bed, safe behind warded curtains, unopened.</p>
<p>Draco already knew what was in the letter; his father had sent him many letters just like it, berating his son for not figuring out a way for him to escape prison already, asking Draco how and what measurements he had taken to further their cause, who were their allies, and what allies they could gain now that the ‘insane halfblood Riddle’ was gone.</p>
<p>The letter still lay unread because, forgive him if he’s wrong, Draco had thought that the fighting would be over. Potter had won. He had defeated the ‘insane halfblood Riddle’ and now all Draco would have to do would be to survive and prosper.</p>
<p>Draco had thought that <em> he </em> would have become the new Lord Malfoy, how could his father run a household from prison, unfortunately the  Ministry thought that the Malfoys would be easier to control without a proper head. They were wrong, and Draco was still the puppet he always was with ‘Daddy’ pulling the strings.</p>
<p>Draco thought that he would be free. Free to do and become whatever he wanted.</p>
<p>It was humbling and humiliating to know that he was so wrong. The war wasn't over, not even close, and Draco was once again trapped in a situation that he never wanted to be in. Only this time he wouldn’t fool himself into believing that what his father was doing was noble and right. This time he wouldn’t delude himself into believing that his father wanted what was best for him. He wouldn’t trick himself into thinking that he would be honored and protected.</p>
<p>Draco’s mother wasn’t in much of a better situation than he was. She was at the manor on house arrest for the rest over her life, never allowed to leave, unless on the Ministry’s say so.</p>
<p>The fact that she was pregnant didn't mean anything to them. She wasn't even allowed to leave for her healer visits. They just brought the healer to her.</p>
<p>He didn't even want to think about the fact that she was alone. She was all alone in that home turned twice a prison. She had no one to talk to. She didn't have any friends, or  family. Only him.</p>
<p>His mother sent him letters every week, multiple times, and the time in between letters kept getting shorter and shorter. Letters that said nothing but how much she missed him and loved him, and checkins on how her pregnancy was progressing. The poorly disguised, absolute loneliness that poured off each page broke his heart with every word.</p>
<p>And as guilty and confused as it made him, he only answered her barely half of the time.</p>
<p>She didn't even have house elves to talk to. The Ministry took them all away. They took it upon themselves to put the Malfoy vaults on hold until Draco graduated from Hogwarts. They do give her an allowance, only just enough to live on.</p>
<p>His mother, who’s never worked a day in her life, now had to cook, clean, and prepare for a newborn all by herself. Not that Draco hadn’t tried to help her. He petitioned for the Ministry to allow him to hire servants. They had rejected him saying that it was an ‘unnecessary use of funds’. He couldn’t do anything to help her.</p>
<p>Just another thing that he had to worry about is the fact that he would no longer be an only child. Not to mention, that in his opinion, his mother was too old to safely carry any children to term. It’s not like she ever had much luck with bearing children in the first place. He knows how many and who lies beneath the rose garden his mother takes care of so vigilantly. But she was so happy about her pregnancy that he would never tell her his thoughts on the matter.</p>
<p>Plus, the fact that he now had a competitor for the family name, if it’s a boy, his father could finally grow tired of him and disown him with another child waiting as a replacement. Then he’d really have and be nothing.</p>
<p>He couldn’t think of anything else, but the fact that his life was shit and nothing worked out for him the way his father had planned for it to.</p>
<p>Even  his grades were falling so far and fast that Mudblood Granger was ahead of him in three classes and gaining on him in Potions.</p>
<p>Draco may not be able to control his life, but he can control his grades. The very thought that Uppity Mudblood Granger was close to beating him in his best class would not be tolerated or accepted.</p>
<p>Hence, the reason he was in the library. She could have Astrology, Arithmancy, and Charms. But he’d be damned if she would have Potions.</p>
<p>With all of the things on his mind distracting him, he didn’t notice that he wasn’t in the Potions sections of the library anymore, but the muggle.</p>
<p>Running his fingers along the dusty book spines, not even reading the titles, he decided to think about something slightly less depressing, like the fact that he hasn’t had his favorite meal, Coq Au Vin, in what felt like years.</p>
<p>The memory of summer evenings spent with his mother at their villa in France. The smell, and the taste. The laughter and smiles shared between the two of them, mother and son.</p>
<p>And the reason he hasn’t tasted it in so long is the fact that the insipid house elf Dobby couldn’t cook to save his life.</p>
<p><em> What kind of house elf couldn’t cook? </em> He shook his head. <em> It couldn’t possibly be that difficult. Throw some things in a pot, sprinkle some stuff on top and you’re done. </em>He reasoned that the house elf must either be defective or stupid.</p>
<p>His thoughts were interrupted by a loud slamming that could only be books that have been tossed onto a table without care. “Ronald!” <em> Great. Mudblood Granger is here, but then again, when is she not? And when she and Weasel are near, Potter is never far behind. </em></p>
<p>No, thinking about Potter would only push him further down his spiral of depression. Because thinking about Potter would lead to thinking about the war, which would lead to thinking about his failures, which would lead to thinking about how Potter was there to save him most of the times that he needed to be saved, which would lead to him wishing that Potter would save-</p>
<p>Draco immediately killed that train of thought, instead he focused on the book that he was fingering, and snatched his hand back gasping like the book had suddenly caught fire. It was a plain black book, nothing special. Certainly nothing that was the cause him of him wiping his hands on his trousers. No, the reason for that were the shiny golden letters trailing down the spine: <b> <em>How To Play Muggle Chess</em> </b> <em> . </em></p>
<p><em> Disgusting! </em>He recoiled further away from the book. Even the thought that he touched something that was about them made him want to gag. He might not think that they should all die, but that doesn’t mean that he wants anything to do with them. Ever.</p>
<p>Draco turned around so quickly that he almost tripped, almost mind you that Malfoys don't trip, into the bookcase on the other side of the aisle. Catching himself on a shelf, his eyes zeroed in on the book right in his eyeline: <b> <em>French Provincial Cooking, by Elizabeth David</em> </b> <em> . </em></p>
<p>Draco swiftly straightened himself and snorted.<em> As if a muggle can do anything as sophisticated as to prepare food from France properly. Especially with a name as laughable as Elizabeth David. </em></p>
<p>Chuckling he pulled the book out from between two other titles that he had no care to read, and stuffs it in his bag to take out and make fun of later. He pulls down a couple of other books that look educational enough to carry out of the library so that no one thinks that he was in the Muggle Studies section by choice, and believe that he was there for an assignment.</p>
<p>But of course, once he rounded the corner he came face to face with the Golden Trio.</p>
<p>“What are you doing here, Ferrett?” Weasel, attempting to be intimidating, all but hissed at Draco.</p>
<p>Draco rolled his eyes upwards, asking whatever deity above to give him strength. “What the bloody hell do you think I’m doing here, Weasel? In the library? Surrounded by books?”</p>
<p>Draco sees Potter narrow his eyes and Granger place her hands on her hips in battle stance. <em> Great. </em></p>
<p>Weasel’s chest puffed up and he took a couple steps closer to Draco, so that he could loom over him. “You better shut your mouth, Malfoy, before I shut it for you.” Weasel growled.</p>
<p>Draco put on the most deadpan, uninterested face that he could wear, and used his most bland and emotionless voice and said, “Wow. Weasley, you’re so big, so strong, and so scary. No one can ever deny that you’re important and that you matter. No one could possibly doubt your manliness and superiority above all others. But one can’t help but wonder if you’re,” Draco slowly dragged his eyes down and up Weasley’s body, with a little pause at the groin. “Compensating for something.” Draco finished to really drive in the fact that Weasley meant nothing to him.</p>
<p>With great pleasure Draco watched Weasley try his best to make his face match his hair.</p>
<p>“You little shit!” Weasley yelled reaching for his wand.</p>
<p>Draco’s eyes widened and he took a step back, raising his books to use a barrier.</p>
<p>“Ron, don't!” Granger pulled on Weasley’s arm and looked disgustedly back at Draco. “Unfortunately, he hasn’t actually done anything wrong this time.” <em> This time? Bitch. </em></p>
<p>Weasley’s next step stuttered a bit and he looked down at Granger with wide, embarrassed eyes. “But ‘Mione, he…” Weasley broke eye contact with her and blushed an even deeper red, which Draco hadn’t thought possible and was pleasantly surprised.</p>
<p>Granger chased Weasley’s eyes and gazed into them wondrously. “Now Ron, you mustn't always be so quick to anger.” She placed a hand on his face and smiled a little. “We both know that he’s wrong.” The two of them giggled and wrapped their arms around each other.</p>
<p><em> Ugh! </em>Each time Draco saw their eyes sparkle brought him closer and closer to vomiting. With a quick glance at Potter, Draco confirmed that he wasn't to far off either or he was just jealous. Though of Granger or Weasley, Draco didn’t know.</p>
<p>“As rivetingly repulsive as this is, and trust me it is quite a show, I must be going before I sick up right where I stand.” Draco made to walk around the Golden Love Triangle when he was stopped by Potter stepping in his way. Taking a breath to steady himself, Draco looked up into Potter’s cold green eyes. <em> Up? When the bloody hell did he get taller than me? Must be some type of witchcraft. Stupid bloody Mudblood Granger’s witchcraft no doubt. </em></p>
<p>“What are you doing with Muggle books, Malfoy?” Potter questioned with narrowed eyes in a low voice. Because of course, he noticed.</p>
<p>“Yeah.” Weasley added completely unnecessarily at Potter’s side with Granger on the other. Draco ponders how they got there so quickly when he only blinked once and there they were. <em> Seriously it’s a wonder Potter can do anything with those two always up his arse. </em></p>
<p>Draco rolled his eyes once again at Weasley then refocused his gaze on Potter.</p>
<p>“If you must know Potter, the Ministry is punishing me by making Muggle Studies mandatory.” Draco thought quickly and spoke with a flippant air about himself.</p>
<p>Potter looked doubtful and was opening his mouth to say something when Draco cut him off by swiftly spinning away and walking, more like strutting, in the opposite direction with his robes billowing behind him in a fashion that would make Severus proud.</p>
<p>Even though knowing that looking back at them would defeat the point of his dramatic exit, Draco couldn’t help himself. As he was about to turn the corner around a shelf, he looked back.</p>
<p>He looked back right into the face Potter was making.</p>
<p>That familiar suspicious, narrowed eyed, distrusting, obsessive, concentrated, creepy look.</p>
<p>That same look Potter gave him all of sixth year, when Potter was stalking him.</p>
<p>Once again, Draco found himself thinking, <em> Great. </em></p>
