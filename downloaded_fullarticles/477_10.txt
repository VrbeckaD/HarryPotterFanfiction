    <p>It hadn't felt like six years.</p>
<p>In the beginning, after the war, Harry had felt both a steadying feeling of peace as well as a calm drive to help the people who'd been affected by all that had happened. Weeks went by with Harry at hospital bedsides, letting people he'd never met but who had fought know they were going to be okay. That it was over. That there was hope again. He cried when they cried, but when he left at the end of the day he was at peace, because he'd helped someone find their own. </p>
<p>He went to the ministry and testified for and against both death eaters and ministry officials. The international wizarding community had stepped in to help with ascertaining who was aiding Voldemort's regime and who was hindering it from the inside. Eventually Kingsley Shacklebot was declared minister and order was finally established, with regular ministry employees getting back to work.</p>
<p>There were funerals, memorials, tributes, awards, charities, and all sorts of functions post-war. Every day Harry would wake up and already have a million things to accomplish. He had to be there for the Weasleys when they finally buried Fred, not letting himself think about the affair beyond what he needed to do to get Ron back on his feet. He had to be there when Hermione took the obliviate off of her parents, which had not gone over very well. He'd had to be there at Lupin and Tonks' funeral, buried together just like his parents had been, Teddy wailing out in Andromeda's arms even though there was no way he could understand the impact of the ceremony.</p>
<p>Harry had been there for all of it. All the harsh grief coming off the Weasleys in waves, the guilt that had Hermione living with the Weasley's before the end of the summer, the pain of those brave strangers bundled away in St. Mungo's with curses so dark there was no one who could help them. He'd been there through all of it, ready for it. The relief of finally having a future outside of Voldemort had been so blinding that it carried him through every kind of pain.</p>
<p>Then a year after the war the world started to turn again. People went to work. Hogwarts was reopening. The prophet reported on the economy or the local government elections in a remote wizarding community. It wasn't as if the war had just disappeared, of course not, but it was no longer the biggest issue in people's lives. They had grieved. People who needed to be in Azkaban were all there. The ministry was up and running and had been for a while. People were ready to move on.</p>
<p>So, Harry took a day off. Locked himself in Grimmauld place and wasted a day taking a bath and ordering takeout. It was wonderful: exactly what he needed. It was a new kind of relief, a different kind from what he'd been feeling. He took another day off. And another. Until it was a week. Until it was two. Until it was too late to realize something wasn't right.</p>
<p>It was like Harry had been holding up the sky his entire life, straining under it but never letting go because it would hurt the one's he loves. Then someone had gently informed him it was alright, they would be fine, he can let go now. So he had, and that had been the relief, but then the sky had fallen down and clung to him like a film. Heavy and hot, it restricted him but also made him want to curl up with it, like a heavy blanket in midwinter.</p>
<p>Harry had never felt that before. Had never felt the exhaustion in his limbs that he couldn't shake out. Never felt the fog in his head begging him to go back to bed. He hadn't felt bad, he'd just felt tired.</p>
<p>It took about a month of this lethargy for the rest of his symptoms to follow, though he hadn't known that was what it was at the time.</p>
<p>A month off, after all he'd been through, wasn't a long amount of time. His friends had thought so, giving him his space and only popping in once or twice. But after the first month, well, Harry started to run out of justifications. He had to move. Finish school. Start his auror career. He had a life all his own now. He had to start living it.</p>
<p>Those thoughts persisted through his head for another three months. And then when he tried, genuinely tried to pick himself off, he couldn't. He couldn't make the limbs move. He was trapped.</p>
<p>He'd been trapped for a while.</p>
<p>Days bled into each other. Months. Years. Harry cried, but couldn't quite feel what about. He just felt hallow. And so tired.</p>
<p>Ron and Hermione had tried to pull him out of it - of course they had - but he'd turned to stone, just letting the years wear him away because there was nothing else he could do. He was stone, he couldn't move, he couldn't feel. He just was.</p>
<p>Eventually, oh Merlin, <em>eventually</em> he got professional help. Ginny had kept her distance after their relationship fell apart, but the day she finally chose to see him was the same day she'd marched right back out and found him a mind healer.</p>
<p>Thank fuck.</p>
<p>So. It had been six years since the war, three and half of which he'd spent locked in depression and another year and half after that fighting back. He'd done it, though <em>done</em> was the wrong term. Harry took a potion every day, he exercised, he made time with friends, and he slept properly. It was manageable. He'd joined the aurors, after disclosing his mental health issues. Turned out they didn't care at all, as it wasn't like it was a new thing to them.</p>
<p>He had a purpose. He had a life. And he had yards upon yards of messes to clean up from when he'd let all his responsibilities go.</p>
<p>That was why he was here, standing on Andromeda's stoop for the first time in six years, flushed pink and hoping to see his godson for the first time since his parents' funeral.</p>
<p>Just a glance at the woman who opened the door made dread pool in his stomach. She was greasy and disheveled, in her nightgown even though it was the afternoon, and her eyes were clouded over with a familiar and terrifying fog.</p>
<p>"I, um-" Harry stuttered, "I'm very sorry for dropping in so suddenly, but I felt I had to explain myself in person."</p>
<p>Apprehension grew in Andromeda's eyes, and she clutched the door a bit tighter.</p>
<p>"Right," Harry breathed, "I'm here to see Teddy. And I'm sorry for how long overdue this visit is."</p>
<p>Anger flared brightly in Andromeda's eyes, the most emotion he'd seen of her yet, until it stuttered and died with a quiet sadness.</p>
<p>"You haven't been reading your letters have you, Harry." Andromeda croaked.</p>
<p>Harry laughed uncomfortably, running a hand through his hair. His mail was also one of those many messes he hadn’t quite gotten to yet, creating a pile so vast it had taken over the dining room in Grimmauld Place. "I haven't been all the way of sorts after the war. I'm very sorry if you've written and I missed it."</p>
<p>Andromeda sighed, pinching the bridge of her nose beneath her glasses. Her eyes were red. "I'm sorry Harry, but I don't have Teddy." </p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Harry had felt shame before, or at least he thought he had. He'd made mistakes. He'd gotten people hurt. But therapy had made him realize how... normal his mistakes were, and had also made him realize he'd felt shame for things that were never his fault to begin with.</p>
<p>This was shame on another level. This was shame in it's true form, and it was all Harry could do not to bury his head in the dirt and scream.</p>
<p>"He was adopted out." Andromeda whispered, clutching her cup of tea to her chest. "But I trust Melinda. I know he's with a family that cares for him."</p>
<p>Harry was panting, tearing at the fabric of his trousers in an attempt to spare the upholstery he'd been seated at in Andromeda's tea room. It was cluttered (and dirty), but the chaise was still fine quality. He couldn't damage it.</p>
<p>He wanted to damage it.</p>
<p>"Why didn't you tell me?" His voice strained.</p>
<p>Andromeda narrowed her eyes. "I did. I sent you all the information. Years ago."</p>
<p>There was nothing Harry could say to that, so he said nothing. His trousers were ruined.</p>
<p>Andromeda sighed. "He's with family, if that's any comfort. Some distant cousin took him in, at least that's what Melinda said."</p>
<p>Melinda, as Harry had learned, was Andromeda's longtime friend who worked in the Children's Interest division at the ministry. The majority of the division was just tracking underage magic, something Harry bitterly found out himself after certain revelations about his own childhood, but there was a branch that helped relocate children and worked with private orphanages.</p>
<p>Thoughts of orphanages evoked wispy images of angry little boys who steal things that don't belong to them, and Harry quickly skittered away from the thought. At least Teddy wasn't in one of those places. </p>
<p>Harry shook himself. "Can you give me their name?"</p>
<p>A strange look came over Andromeda, and she cast her eyes around the clutter. </p>
<p>"You don't know their names, do you?"</p>
<p>“It has to be on Lupin’s side.” Andromeda exhaled slowly, her breath shaking. "I gave you the information, Harry."</p>
<p>Quiet fell between them, their mutual failure taking up all the air. Six years. For almost six years Lupin's son had been raised by absolute strangers while the people who were trusted to care for him wallowed in grief and pain and illness and who knew what else. Regardless of all that, regardless of what his healer would say, the responsibility towards children always came first.</p>
<p>Harry should have checked up on him. Merlin. Merlin. No matter how hard it was just to keep on living, he should have visited him. Or just even given him a fucking thought beyond how Teddy was just another person he was letting down.</p>
<p>The sound of scribbling broke the silence and Harry watched as Andromeda scrawled something on the back of an unopened letter.</p>
<p>"This is Melinda's office address," she said, shakily getting to her feet. "She can get you a name."</p>
<p>Harry rose to meet her and accepted the envelope, only to be startled at the wetness on Andromeda's cheeks. She'd cried throughout the entire visit without Harry hearing a sound. Harry remembered what that felt like.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>"Oh bloody fu-! Hello! Mr. Potter!" The older woman exclaimed, hastily re-arranging her desk at his entrance. "Do come in. My name is Melinda Marge and I am at your disposal."</p>
<p>Harry smiled painfully at the woman, taking her hand in a shake and sitting himself opposite the tiny, cluttered desk she sat behind. It seemed like too much work for such a small desk, let alone one woman.</p>
<p>"I talked to you over floo, Mrs. Marge? About Teddy Lupin?"</p>
<p>Marge laughed, fluttering her hands about nervously. "Oh yes, Mr. Potter. I've, uh, pulled his file for you." She straightened out some parchment, running her hand down the creases and refusing to meet his gaze.</p>
<p>"And?" Harry pressed, a stress headache forming.</p>
<p>Marge swallowed, and seemed to press her hands together in prayer. "So, what you need to understand is that there were many orphans after the war. A true tragedy, but the ministry was swamped with weeding out death eaters and the like from their ranks. We didn't have the resources to care for all those children, and the orphanages were equally as strained. So, uh, any family that were eligible to claim the children were contacted." Marge's voice suddenly lowered. "I hope to impress upon you how difficult that period of time was."</p>
<p>"You don't need to tell me, I was there." Harry said mildly.</p>
<p>Marge giggled embarrassedly. "Ah, yes, well, um, so you see-"</p>
<p>"Just-" Harry sighed, the tension in his stomach refusing to settle,"Where is he?"</p>
<p>Marge bit her lip, gently unfolding a scroll and staring down at the pages. "Edward Remus Lupin, aged five months, was surrendered to ministry services by Andromeda Black due to inability to provide care on September third. One week later Edward Lupin was claimed by distant family member-" she paused, raising her head to meet Harry's eyes, "Draco Malfoy."</p>
<p>She stared at him, gauging his reaction. He had none to give.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry? I believe I misheard." Because he had. Regardless of the ministry’s incompetence and Malfoy’s acquittal there was no way that would have gone through. His reputation alone is enough to get himself bullied out of Diagon Alley, let alone adopt a child.</p>
<p>Marge grimaced. "You didn't."</p>
<p>"Draco Malfoy?" He asked Marge. Again, absurdly, she nodded. "The Draco Malfoy who was a death eater? Who lived with Voldemort for months?” Harry said wryly, “That Malfoy?”</p>
<p>Marge bit her lip. "He's really not so bad."</p>
<p>"You're not serious."</p>
<p>"He really isn't." Marge tried to insist, despite the apologetic expression.</p>
<p>Harry was suddenly on his feet, horror clogging his throat and pushing him into an aggressive pacing in the tiny office. It was easier to picture Teddy being cared for by a stranger than Malfoy. A stranger could be anyone. A stranger could be a big family with lots of brothers and stable income. A stranger could mean love and bedtime stories and vegetables and play. Draco Malfoy meant bullying and shame and prejudice.</p>
<p>"How," Harry choked, "I'm his godfather. You know this."</p>
<p>Marge squirmed. "We hadn't known it at the time. There was no paperwork-"</p>
<p>"Of fucking course there wasn't any paperwork! His parents died in the damn war that took over the ministry."</p>
<p>Marge had nothing to say to that.</p>
<p>"His parents died war heroes…and their son just spent six years in the care of a <em>death eater</em>.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The address was a piece of suburbia in the quieter part of London, an area with less pubs and more parks. A fairly modern building, it had an an iron gate protecting the stoop, and a narrow slice of lawn where a child's bike lay on it's side next to a decent sized tree, all it's leaves already shed. It looked fairly new, but incredibly muggle as the whole building felt standardized. Plastic light fixtures and stickers of flowers in the windows and barbie dolls left dirty and broken in the soil nearest the stoop.</p>
<p>A two-story home in muggle London.</p>
<p>Harry's steps stuttered and he reached out to steady himself on the fence in front of the building, pressing a hand to his heart and wishing, for the millionth time in his life, that the world was different.</p>
<p>The door of the building was shoved open and Harry froze, only to remember he'd thrown on his invisibility cloak over his robes, in respect for the muggle locale. A figure popped out and narrowed his eyes at the grey sky, fiddling with knit gloves before shuffling back inside.</p>
<p>Harry recognized him. Even after years of trying to forget, he recognized him.</p>
<p>Before he could even contemplate what to do the door was thrown open once more with the man helping someone significantly smaller through.</p>
<p>"I don't think you should put peas in it, is all." The smaller figure- a boy- <em>Teddy</em> said, holding a bundle of fabric in his arms.</p>
<p>"But I always put peas in the stew." Malfoy said reasonably, glaring at the sky before snaking his arm back inside and coming back with an umbrella.</p>
<p>"I know ." Teddy sighed, much too long-suffering for his age. He reached out a hand.</p>
<p>Malfoy rolled his eyes but grabbed the offered hand, holding onto the railing and helping the little boy down the stairs of the stoop.</p>
<p>The boy…the boy was a normal child, energetic and round-faced, with a garishly orange raincoat and matching boots. His grin was grand and blinding, and directed firmly on the pale-blond pointy man completely covered in muggle garb and living in a muggle home. The umbrella was made of plastic for merlin’s sake, and though his coat was stylish with it’s grey pattern and upturned collar it was stylish in a…well <em>muggle</em> way. That wasn’t what a Malfoy did.</p>
<p>It didn't make sense. Nothing about this made sense. The boy who'd been sat in the ministry's disgusting excuse for a courtroom with wrists bound in chains and dark circles under his eyes couldn't be the same person as the grown man casually dressed for rain, leading a child by the hand. The boy who'd tried to crucio Harry couldn't be the man indulging a child's idea of wit. The boy whose aunt had permanently scarred her hatred of muggles onto Hermione's skin could not be living in a nice muggle neighborhood wearing nice muggle clothes and dodging muggle children's toys on this way through the iron gate.</p>
<p>"I won't put peas in the stew if I can put broccoli in." Malfoy said as he closed the gate behind them.</p>
<p>Teddy squealed. "Daddy, that's perfect!"</p>
<p>Malfoy muttered under his breath about strange little boys who enjoyed broccoli but Harry didn't catch it, as his entire world had turned on it's axis and plunged into fiery rage. How dare he? Who the fuck does Malfoy think he is, letting Teddy call him that? His real father is buried under the earth after giving his life to fight the man that the Malfoy's had fucking hosted in their home. The man Malfoy had served. The man who'd killed his parents. And he taught Teddy to call him "daddy"? Does Teddy actually think Malfoy was his father? Did Malfoy feed Teddy some lark about getting a girl pregnant and then abandoning them? Did Teddy even know about Lupin? About Tonks? About the war that killed them and the medals they got after their deaths? Did he know that the man he thinks is his father helped the people that robbed him of an actual family?</p>
<p>Harry clawed at his neck trying to draw in breath but the rage was too much, his face was twisted and the smell of blood was so close he could taste it.</p>
<p>Malfoy stopped walking and flared his nostrils, whipping around to stare in the vague direction Harry was still invisible.</p>
<p>"Daddy...?"</p>
<p>Worse than rage, magic leapt from underneath Harry's skin, straining at his core and desperate to destroy the landscape around him. While Harry was desperate to undo what had clearly already been done.</p>
<p>He apparated. He couldn't stay there and even attempt to regain his control, not while Malfoy had his godson's hand in his. Not while they joked about supper. Not while Teddy called him "daddy" like Lupin had never existed.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>His magic hadn't been the same after Voldemort. It had felt like a rubber band that was stretched for too long, and now that the pressure was off, it was too big. There was too much to hold onto and it slipped out if he forgot about it for just one second. It was like his magic was angry, but it wasn't. It was just too big.</p>
<p>And the whole Teddy situation felt the same. Too big. Hard to control. There wasn't enough calming draught in the world.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean Harry didn't immediately go home to down a galleon of the stuff. He had to deal with this, he had to go back and witness for himself the reality with which he’d already been confronted. Seeing is not believing, as it turned out, because the denial refused to leave him even as Harry replayed the domestic scene he’d spied on over and over in his head. Malfoy hadn’t looked like himself, not at all. He was indistinguishable from a muggle and he’d appeared…calm. The Draco Malfoy at school was always tense, always twisting in on himself to be the center of attention. This Malfoy, this grown foreign version of him had appeared nothing less than content. It unnerved him.</p>
<p>By late afternoon Harry was steady, relatively, and physically walked to Malfoy's place in his muggle clothes this time, eliminating the option of disapparating. He needed to see Teddy, properly. He needed to know him.</p>
<p>As he approached he could hear noises from inside, the clanking of dishes and muffled voices. That was good. They were home. No reason to dally. </p>
<p>Breathing twice, he knocked gently then stood back. Stood tall. Good fucking Merlin what was happening-?</p>
<p>"Can I help you?" And there was Malfoy, wearing more casual muggle clothes from what he’d been wearing that morning and with a dishrag over his shoulder, but still bearing a startling resemblance to the pointy git who'd been the school bully.</p>
<p>Even the fear that slowly grew on his face was familiar. He'd always been the cowardly sort.</p>
<p>Quick as a snitch Malfoy tried to wrench the door shut in his face, only managing to catch Harry's fingers as he tried to hold the door open. Pain blended with agitation and before he knew it Harry was literally kicking the door open and barging in, vaguely remarking on the beige muggle walls and haphazard pile of shoes on a mat. </p>
<p>"Get out!" Malfoy shrieked, "I didn't give you permission to enter!"</p>
<p>Harry almost rolled his eyes at the offense in Malfoy's tone, but was quickly distracted as Malfoy started trying to physically <em>muscle</em> him out of the house. "Get out!"</p>
<p>Fuck that. </p>
<p>With a scowl and a grunt Harry went on the offensive, almost relaxing at how familiar fighting with Malfoy was. Instinct coursing through him had Harry kicking the door closed and pinning Malfoy to it like he would an assailant, an arm behind his back. The comparison wasn't far off, considering Malfoy was halfway to a kidnapper. </p>
<p>"Are you going to calm down or an I going to have to stun you." Harry grit out.</p>
<p>Malfoy was panting, growling in his grip and making jerking movements to try and break free. He kicked behind which Harry dodged.</p>
<p>"You know, stunning you wasn't an idle threat. You're not exactly my favourite fucking person at the moment, Malfoy."</p>
<p>A patter of small steps. "...Daddy?"</p>
<p>The new rage at hearing that term of address made Harry tighten his grip for just a second, just enough to make Malfoy whimper, and just enough to have the boy who'd appeared at the top of the carpeted muggle stairs just beyond the doorway crying out in alarm.</p>
<p>Immediately Harry backed off, picturing the scene Teddy must be witnessing and letting Malfoy off the door. Malfoy sneered at him, but the tension was back in his shoulders.</p>
<p>Malfoy rubbed his wrist, steeling himself with a shaky breath. "Go to you room, Teddy," he said, much more calmly than he'd been speaking to Harry, and quite a bit more calmly than Harry expected of him. </p>
<p>Teddy whimpered. "But-!"</p>
<p>"You're not in trouble," Malfoy said quickly, "but you need to go to your room while I deal with our guest."</p>
<p>Teddy's eyes slid over to Harry's and it took all of his willpower not to gasp. Teddy truly had Tonks' features, brown hair worn short and the dark eyes Harry knew would twinkle with mischief. He was clutching at the banister, shoulders to his ears and tiny fists clenched to his chest, staring at Harry with wide eyes.</p>
<p>"It's <em>okaypotential danger</em> to <em>bad friend</em>. His nervousness disappeared, replaced with a jutting chin and a glare so pronounced it completely warped Tonks’ features into something distinctly Malfoy. </p>
<p>Harry didn’t have it in him to be angry about it, feeling off-kilter. “Er, sorry.” </p>
<p>Teddy’s eyes narrowed further and he scoffed, reaching up to grab Malfoy around the neck and whisper something in his ear. Malfoy smiled at him, but it was subdued. </p>
<p>“Can you go to your room now?” He asked, hushed.</p>
<p>Teddy pursed his lips and flicked his eyes back to Harry, pulling his heart when he saw that no, not all the fear had been removed from Teddy’s gaze. Teddy shook his head at Malfoy’s question and tucked his face into Malfoy’s neck.</p>
<p>Malfoy sighed, whispering even lower to him, then hiking him up in his arms and marching back to Harry.</p>
<p>“What do you want.” Malfoy demanded. It was a stark contrast to the shrill tone he’d had before there was a child in his arms.</p>
<p>All at once Harry’s words leave him, clogging in his throat with emotions he didn’t expect him to find in this encounter.</p>
<p>Malfoy clenched his jaw, running a soothing hand over Teddy’s back. “I don’t know what you think I’m connected with <em>auror</em> Potter but I’ve done nothing illegal by both muggle or magical laws, beyond what I’ve already been tried and acquitted for.”</p>
<p>Before Malfoy had said such a thing the idea that he could have still been involved with criminal activity had never entered Harry’s mind, but the thought made a new sickness burn his stomach. He’d have to look up Malfoy’s file when he got back to work. </p>
<p>“Well?” Malfoy drawled, despite the caution in his voice. “Are you going to speak or has some tragic act of heroism robbed you of that ability?”</p>
<p>Teddy fussed at the words, which Malfoy quickly shushed. Harry licked his lips. “I’m not here on auror business.”</p>
<p>“Oh?” Malfoy inquired, his voice gaining a bit more edge. “Well if you’re here for a pleasure visit I’m afraid you’ve already mucked it up.”</p>
<p>“I’m not-” Harry exhaled, counting to ten in his head.</p>
<p>“Ah.” Malfoy nodded, suddenly calm. “So you’ve just come to terrorize me and my family then.”</p>
<p><em>He’s not your family,</em> Harry desperately wanted to say, but the words tied themselves into knots in his throat. He was. Technically. Maybe literally.</p>
<p>“I don’t know where you get off,” Malfoy fumed, working himself up, “but I shouldn’t have to explain to you why showing up out of the blue to someone’s home is rude, let alone <em>accosting</em> them after being denied entry-”</p>
<p>“I’m Teddy’s godfather.” Harry spat out quickly, with an almost guilty desire to explain himself. </p>
<p>Teddy whimpered and looked up from Malfoy’s shoulder, eyeing Harry with both curiosity and trepidation, his thumb finding it’s way to his mouth. Malfoy’s hand found Teddy’s neck and guided him back to his shoulder.</p>
<p>“What are you talking about?” Malfoy whispered, angling Teddy as far away from Harry as possible. </p>
<p>“I-” Harry choked, collecting himself. “I’m his godfather.”</p>
<p>Malfoy watched him, intense grey eyes boring into Harry’s. “No, you’re not.”</p>
<p>Harry sighed, suddenly exhausted. The image of the fear in Teddy’s eyes as he saw Harry for the first time was cycling through his brain.  “Ask Melinda from the Child’s Interest division. She seemed to know you.”</p>
<p>“Melinda?” Teddy squeaked. Malfoy pursed his lips, but Teddy continued. “Draco, he knows Melinda.”</p>
<p>“So it appears.” Malfoy said peacefully, brushing a hand though Teddy’s hair. Malfoy bit his lip, </p>
<p>“I will ask Melinda about your claim. If you’re right then-” Malfoy cut off, a desperate gleam in his eye. “If you’re right then I will be in touch.”</p>
<p>Harry recognized the dismissal, but the new monster is Harry’s chest reeled. “I can’t leave without-” he didn’t know how to end the sentence.</p>
<p>“You need to leave, Potter.” Malfoy said, in a tone that brook no argument. He sounded like Mrs. Weasley.</p>
<p>Teddy made a sound at his voice, which Malfoy compulsively soothed. With that, with too much conflicting information and emotions running high, Harry let himself be shuffled out the door with no further issue, barely catching a small voice ask, “What’s a godfather?”</p>
