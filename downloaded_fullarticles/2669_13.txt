  <em>"Death is not the opposite of life</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>But the opposite of choice. ''</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>- Robin Hood, Farseer Trilogy</em>
</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="left">For the third time of his short life, he puts the Sorting Hat on his head, and for the second time of his life, he waits to be sorted. Today, however, he doesn't have any expectations - there's no place he really wants to be, no place he doesn't want to discover. He died, after all, and when you went in the other place and came back alive, stronger than ever, there's no Hogwarts house that can hurt you.</p><p align="left"><em>Ah, </em>the Hat says, <em>I see you're more confident than you were before.</em></p><p align="left">Harry is seven, and he is back with the Dursleys, once again. He's trying his best to repaint Dudley's bedroom, but even perched on the highest desk of the room, he can't quite reach the ceiling. He's crying in silence, knowing that he'll get punished for that - and knowing that he still has a list of chores to finish before he can even thinks about eating.</p><p align="left"><em>So young, </em>the Hat says, <em>and yet so full of responsibility.</em></p><p align="left">He's eleven now, and for the first time of his life, he has friends, actual friends that love him, and that he loves back. Here, he's happy, he feels home - he doesn't have to cook, doesn't have to paint, doesn't have to survive anymore. But still, he never learned how to trust adults, so when the Stone is in danger, he does the only thing he can thinks of - he goes and save the day.</p><p align="left"><em>All alone, </em>the Hat says, <em>in a room full of people.</em></p><p align="left">He's fourteen and he's entered in a tournament against his will. Fighting, of course, isn't a problem - he's used to it, now. He faces a dragon, with rage in his eyes, not wanting to be the weaker of the lot. He swims into the dark to retrieves what he loves the most - even though the coldness of the lake makes him feel like his life is ending. And he goes into that labyrinth, that damned labyrinth. What isn't normal, though, is seeing other getting hurt - Hermione was petrified in second year, and Ron's leg was broken in third, but those were little things, nothing permanent. When Cedric dies in front of him, he curses that contract, and Barty Crouch, and everybody that made him enter the tournament - there are flames in his eyes this time, and murder on his tongue.</p><p align="left"><em>Vengeance, </em>the Hat says, <em>is sweeter in the dark.</em></p><p align="left">He's seventeen, finally, and he is going to pay the ultimate price. Walking in that dark forest, he thinks about his friends, of course, the first family he ever found, and how someone decided he would never grow with them even before he was born. He thinks about Ginny, and her scent, and the taste of her lips. He doesn't look back. He's sad, of course, but he's more angry that he never had the choice. So he walks to his death, not because he wants to, but because he needs to.</p><p align="left"><em>What do you need, Harry Potter ?</em> the Hat asks, and this time the answer is simple ; <em>I need to be free, </em>he offers.</p><p align="left">The Hall is silent for a moment, but then everybody claps and congratulates him. He's their saviour, that won't change, but they recognize him as more than that,t hose kids who fought with him when more experimented wizards didn't. They know him, and they want him to be happy, and they know that he'll find that in his knew home.</p><p align="left">
