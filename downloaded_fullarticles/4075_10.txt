    <span>Chapter One</span>
  </b>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>Luna had been friends with Ginny for as long as she could remember – they didn’t live all that far away from one another, after all, and Luna’s Mum and Molly Weasley had been friends, once. Not the closest of friends, no; but they’d been in the same year at Hogwarts, so they knew each other reasonably well, and when they both had daughters the same age, it only made logical sense to have play-dates for the two of them.</span>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>Luna knew that many wizarding children grew up without real friends until they went to Hogwarts. Instead they relied on the closeness of family (particularly siblings, if they had them) for their human contact. Luna was lucky to have an actual friend, even if she and Ginny only started out as friends because they had no one else – Ginny had too many brothers who didn’t have time to play with the ‘baby’ of the family, while Luna had no siblings at all. Ginny was her only real connection besides her parents.</span>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>The year after Luna’s Mum had died had been terribly difficult – Luna had become withdrawn, and – not sullen, exactly, never that, but… </span>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
  <i>
    <span>Uncommunicative</span>
  </i>
  <span> was the best word, really. Luna hadn’t wanted to have anything to do with anyone, too torn up inside by the terrible pain and grief that constantly filled the imaginary hole in her chest where Luna felt that her heart had been ripped out – and for all that it was a metaphorical tearing-out, the ache in Luna’s chest was real, and constant. Some days it felt like she would die from the emptiness alone.</span>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>Luna wasn’t the best company in that time, but Ginny still came to visit her most days, telling stories of her brothers antics, her father’s gentle indulgence when they got into trouble (but never her mother’s exasperated fury, because even at that age, Ginny knew what things to say, and what things to keep to herself). In spite of herself, Luna listened; and although she felt like she would never be okay again, Ginny’s lively presence was a spark of life in her chest. As long as Ginny stopped by, Luna had something to hold onto besides the pain.</span>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>Looking back later, Luna knew that Ginny was the only reason Luna hadn’t let go of life altogether. Luna always wanted to hear the next story, to know what activity Ginny would spur her into through tenacity alone. It was Ginny who had kindly bullied her into having imaginary tea parties and swimming in the nearby creek and sneaking out to the shed at Ginny’s house to steal her brothers’ broomsticks. It was Ginny who had slowly taught Luna how to live again, and that was a kindness that Luna would never, could never forget.</span>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>During their first year at Hogwarts Luna did her best to return the favour when Ginny was lonely and homesick; but they were in different Houses, and it was hard to find Ginny outside of classes. Eventually it became clear that Ginny was avoiding Luna, for whatever reason; Luna did not understand it. But Ginny had never given up on Luna, so Luna never gave up on her – not even when Ginny’s housemates told her, “Give up, Loony, can’t you tell she doesn’t want to see you?”</span>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>But then, on the train home at the end of term, Ginny had knocked on the door of Luna’s compartment, her face pale and troubled, as though she had gone through something terrible.</span>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>“Can I sit with you?” Ginny asked, her voice tremulous, obviously unsure of her welcome.</span>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>“Of course you can,” said Luna, and the sheer relief she felt threatened to engulf her. She waited until Ginny had dragged her trunk into the compartment and shut the door before she said, “Are you okay?”</span>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>Ginny’s face crumpled, any façade of okayness collapsing like a house of cards that had been touched the wrong way. She flung herself at Luna, wailing about how she was <i>so sorry, Tom made me!</i></span>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>Luna had held Ginny close and stoked her hair as Ginny sobbed, the way that Luna’s Mum always used to do with her when she was upset, and the story slowly came out, in tangled, jumbled-up fragments.</span>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>Ginny had been possessed for most of the school year, by <i>Voldemort</i> himself, and if it wasn’t for the bravery of a twelve-year-old boy who’d faced down Voldemort and a basilisk all on his own, Ginny would be dead.</span>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>Luna let Ginny cry herself out before she said, “It’s not your fault.”</span>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>“But I let him in! I told him all my secrets and let him into my heart, and – and he <i>used</i> me!” Ginny looked tragic and tormented. “I thought he was my friend, and all this time, he was – he was–”</span>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>“You’re going to be okay,” Luna told her. When Ginny made a scoffing noise, she said, “I know it doesn’t feel like it right now, but you will. You’re not the same person you were before this happened, and you never will be again. But becoming a new person is something everyone goes through, eventually. For most people it happens gradually, but for some of us it happens all at once, because of what we’ve been through.” </span>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>Ginny stared at her.</span>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>“It doesn’t feel like I’ll be okay ever again,” said Ginny, her voice breaking. </span>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>“I know,” said Luna. “This is going to be a very difficult time, I’m afraid. But Ginny – I’m here for you.”</span>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>Ginny cried again, and Luna held her hand tightly the entire time. </span>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>That summer, it was Luna who helped Ginny put herself back together, while Ginny’s family tip-toed around what had happened.</span>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>“They don’t want to talk about it,” Ginny said, as she and Luna sat in the shade of the trees that stretched over the creek. They were sitting on the banks of the creeks, watching the water lazily make its way downstream. “But I need to talk about it. It eats away at me inside until I feel like I’m going mad.”</span>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>“Tell me,” said Luna. So Ginny did. She described what it had felt like, to feel control of herself wrested away bit by bit, frightening blank spots appearing in her memory, blood appearing on her hands with no understanding of how it had gotten there…<span>  </span></span>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>Ginny had questioned her own sanity, before she realised that something far more terrible was happening to her. But by then, it had been too late to ask for help – <i>Tom</i> controlled too much of her.</span>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>“I’m never going to be able to hear the name ‘Tom’ again without shuddering,” said Ginny, into the quiet. </span>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>Luna listened in silence, trying to hide the fury that filled her at what her friend had been through, her heart breaking at Ginny’s plight. Luna didn’t get angry very often, but when she did, it was a dark, violent thing, coursing through her like the currents beneath the still surface of a river. Luna’s Mum had always told her that it was natural to be angry, but it was what you did with your anger that mattered.</span>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>Luna reached out to squeeze Ginny’s hand.</span>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>“I’m sorry I couldn’t help you when it all happened,” she said.</span>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>Ginny gave a laugh that wasn’t amused at all.</span>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>“At least you tried,” she said. “My brothers – they didn’t even notice. <i>Harry Potter</i> asked once if I was okay, someone who barely even knew me, and when I tried to tell him, Percy chased me away.” Another laugh. “I think Percy was afraid I was going to tell Harry about his <i>girlfriend</i>.” </span>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>Ginny’s voice was bitter. Luna stayed silent, let her talk.</span>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>“But you – you kept trying,” Ginny added. “Even though you knew I was avoiding you – despite the nasty things my housemates said to you, and yes, I heard them – you still kept trying to help me. In the end, the only two people who tried to help me weren’t my family, Luna.”</span>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>“Ron tried at the end,” Luna said, because she didn’t want Ginny to feel that her family abandoned her when she needed them the most. “When he heard you’d been taken into the Chamber of Secrets. He went with Harry to rescue you.”</span>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>Ginny’s hard expression softened a little, into sadness.</span>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>“I know. But I feel like that was a little too late – he didn’t notice anything was wrong until someone else told him. And I can’t quite forgive any of them for that. Not even Ron.” </span>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
  <span> </span>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
  <span>Luna didn’t know what to say to that.</span>
