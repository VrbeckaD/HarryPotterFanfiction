          <div class="userstuff"><p>She was like the sun, and it was impossible not to get caught up in her orbit.</p>
<p>Rowan was drawn to her from the start, even before the story about the vaults came along.</p>
<p>Even though, at the time, no one else seemed to notice how amazing she was.</p>
<p>So it wasn't fair how, after everything they had been through together, she seemed to leave Rowan behind.</p>
<p>Rowan didn't mean to get angry at her, but the problem with loving the sun is, you're just one of many planets.</p>
<p>All Rowan ever wanted was to matter to her as much as she mattered to Rowan, but it seemed that they were not meant to be.</p></div>
