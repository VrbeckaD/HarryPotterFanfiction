  <p>“Here we are, no turn away now”</p>
</center><center>
  <p>Chapter One</p>
</center><center>
  <p>Hecate’s Plan</p>
</center><center>
  <p>⸙</p>
</center><p>“Come on Percy, just give up already!” shouted Nico di Angelo, smirking and swinging his stygian iron sword into the air, bringing it down onto Percy’s sword.</p>
<p>The son of Poseidon laughed, clashing his celestial bronze sword onto Nico’s in return, waiting for the perfect moment to try to disarm the Italian.</p>
<p>“Just don’t kill each other, dumbheads!”.</p>
<p>They had been fighting for over half an hour under August’s burning heat at Camp Half-Blood. The sun was shining above their heads, painting the sky an unbelievably bright shade of blue. A light breeze blowing through the trees’ branches made the heat bearable, and carried through the air the sweet smell of freshly cut strawberries and the sound of careless laughter.</p>
<p>Summer at Camp had never felt so calm. It felt like they were just normal teenagers at a normal summer camp, without the threat of quests and wars lingering above them, leaving just the fun that spending all summer with your best friends can give.</p>
<p>Sure, they had sparring duels and lava walls and their own peculiar version of Capture the Flag, but closing his eyes, Percy could almost pretend to be a normal eighteen year old boy just enjoying his last year of summer camp before leaving for university.</p>
<p>That feeling lasted very little time, though. Opening his eyes again, it was indeed clear that Camp Half-Blood wasn’t a normal summer camp, and that everyone in it wasn’t normal at all. The previous year with the war against Gaea raging on he had barely set foot at Camp all year, save for when they had to fight the final battle, and was starting to forget what it looked like. Leo’s idea of showing pictures of Camp on the Argo II was certainly meant to be a positive reminder of what they were fighting for, but at the same time seeing photos of Camp when they were so far away from it actually gave him a great sense of nostalgia and melancholy. Percy did the best he could do to avoid looking at the pictures of the strawberry fields and the sword fighting arena scattered around the Argo II’s walls and as a result, he couldn’t help but feel as if he was forgetting all the little things that had made Camp look so magical to him in the first place, the first time he visited it.</p>
<p>After the Final Battle, Camp had been a mess. It had taken nearly three weeks of work to rebuild all the damaged cabins and to build other ones for the children of other minor divinities. But in the end, after a lot of hard work, Camp had begun to look like it was before the Battle.</p>
<p>“Percy. Di immortales, at least pretend to be invested in what we’re doing!” spat an annoyed Nico, dodging his last attempt at disarming him and swiftly steering his weapon towards Riptide’s blade, successfully disarming the son of Poseidon and ending the duel.</p>
<p>“That was awfully simple to do. Please don’t make me waste anymore of my time, if you want to fight, fight” said Nico, who was now wiping away the sweat on his forehead with the hem of his t-shirt and walking towards his boyfriend, Will Solace, who had been watching them duel.</p>
<p>“I have to admit it, Nico is right” said the son of Apollo, smirking in Percy’s direction, and passing Nico his water bottle.</p>
<p>“Seriously, you’ve kept me for half a hour under this terrible sun, risking sunstroke, just to give me that shitty ending? I’ll give y’all a 7 for trying, but really, y’all need to astonish me next time you duel, or I’m not your waterboy anymore”.</p>
<p>At that, Nico and Percy burst out laughing, ignoring the son of Apollo’s fuming face, demanding to be taken seriously.</p>
<p>All was, finally, well.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>⸙⸙</p>
</center><p>There was a place on the other hand, where things were definitely not well.</p>
<p>And that place was Hecate’s quarters on Mount Olympus.</p>
<p>The Goddess of Magic was absently walking back and forth in her lavishly decorated chamber, muttering to herself in an annoyed fashion, once again mad with the Olympians.</p>
<p>“The nerve they have! They insist Greeks and Romans are too different to mingle, that their cultures would clash were they to meet, that they’d kill each other!<br/>
And yet here they are, organising stupid exchange-programmes between their two Camps! They’ve been telling me for forever that just as Greeks and Romans could never get along, there was no point in even trying to get our demigod children to meet my other, more powerful children! Bullshit, I say! I’m done listening to their crappy opinions, done!”.</p>
<p>The Goddess stopped her pacing through the room, standing in front of her finely decorated mirror, looking at her reflection right in the eye. She smirked, her eyes full of mischief, an aura of power surrounding her figure.</p>
<p>“It’s time my children get the attention they deserve.”</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>⸙⸙⸙</p>
</center><p>Harry was finally enjoying the first death-threat-free summer of his life, and just repeating the phrase to himself sounded like a dream.</p>
<p>It felt strange, thinking that there was no evil Dark Lord wanting to kill him, no evil minions of his wanting to kill his friends and family.</p>
<p>Thanks to the Order, his warning about Lord Voldemort’s return had been heard, and Aurors from all over the Wizarding World came to help the members of the Order in the search for the Horcruxes. In the end, all the Horcruxes were destroyed in record-time and Voldemort defeated.</p>
<p>It really felt like a dream.</p>
<p>Harry sighed, learning from the alarm clock on his bedside table that it was 8:36 on a lazy Saturday in the middle of August. He sat up on his bed and reached for his glasses, stretching a little, still blanketed in the warm, numb feeling a good night sleep gives.</p>
<p>He lazily made his way downstairs to the kitchen, where he was sure to find Remus cooking breakfast like he did every Saturday morning.</p>
<p>Entering the kitchen door in fact, there was his co-godfather (as Sirius and himself always loved to call him), quietly humming a tune he didn’t recognise. As soon as Remus heard Harry walk through the door he turned his head to greet the boy.</p>
<p>“Harry, good morning!” said Moony, blowing a kiss in his direction. He was dressed in light blue pajamas decorated with tiny silvery stars, which were protected from getting stained by a creme-coloured apron.</p>
<p>“Morning Moony,” answered Harry, now seated on one of the kitchen chairs, not so patiently waiting for Remus to finish preparing breakfast.</p>
<p>As he absently glanced at the kitchen counter his stomach began to rumble painfully. Sunny side up eggs, sausages, toast with strawberry jam, chocolate chip biscuits and his personal favourite, treacle tart, were all sitting on the counter, waiting to be eaten.</p>
<p>Just when he felt his mouth actually water, Remus cast an exasperated look at him, slowly shaking his head with a dramatic flare.</p>
<p>“Okay then, since you clearly have no intention of helping me, go and wake Padfoot or we’re never going to eat before 10 a.m.”.</p>
<p>“Man of little faith, do you really think I’d make Harry wait ‘till 10 a.m. for breakfast, knowing how much of a feral beast he is if he doesn’t eat?”.</p>
<p>Remus laughed, turning his head again in the direction of the kitchen door, this time finding Sirius leaned on the jamb, smirking and checking him out from afar.</p>
<p>“Wow Moony, this <em>mise</em> really brings out your unbelievably sweet eyes”.</p>
<p>“Shut up and sit down next to Harry, <em>Don Giovanni</em>, breakfast is ready anyway”.</p>
<p>As he was savouring his eggs, Harry couldn’t help but feeling hopeful.</p>
<p>Being hopeful in the past didn’t really get him far, but he was sure that his 5th year would be the year his bad luck finally vanished.</p>
<p>He had a family, friends, a school he was looking forward to returning to and no one trying to get him killed. He finally had the chance to live his life like a perfectly normal fifteen year old, and he had no intention of letting that slip away from him.</p>
<p>All would be well.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>⸙⸙⸙⸙</p>
</center><p>“Did you want to see me, Headmaster?”.</p>
<p>Minerva McGonagall entered Albus Dumbledore’s office on that August afternoon having absolutely no idea what it was that required her attention.</p>
<p>After Lord Voldemort’s effective demise, Minerva had found a new peace of mind, working all summer on improving Hogwarts’ educational programmes in coordination with the Ministry of Magic.</p>
<p>She was working on establishing new courses and modernizing the traditional ones Hogwarts already held.</p>
<p>Magic was a notoriously everchanging force, a power that is not set in stone. Spells could be modified, divination techniques could be updated, and potions perfected.</p>
<p>And generally speaking, Hogwarts’ school program had been the same for something like fifty years. It had been a shamefully long time since someone had taken care of updating the courses.</p>
<p>So her big goal for the upcoming school year was to offer her students the best of the best, in terms of education. Unfortunately, undertaking such a demanding task also meant organizing meetings with the other professors and the Ministry and making sure everyone was putting (at least) some kind of effort into the project, even the ones who couldn’t stand the idea of changing.</p>
<p>“Professor, take a seat please.” Minerva did as she was told, starting to feel a little uneasy.</p>
<p>How could this thing Albus wanted to tell her be of such importance so as to convince him to call her to his office? Usually, they discussed anything related to school plans over a cup of tea at breakfast. What could have happened? Was there another awful menace coming for them? For Harry?</p>
<p>“Albus, you’re starting to make me think something bad happened. Why did you make me come up here?”.</p>
<p>The old headmaster combed a hand through his long white beard with a thoughtful expression painted on his face.</p>
<p>“Tell me, Minerva,” said he staring directly into the Trasfiguration teacher’s eyes, “What do you know about mythology?”.</p>
<p>At that, Minerva really thought she was going to have a nervous breakdown.</p>
<p>Was this what Albus wanted to talk about?</p>
<p>“You know reading about Greek mythology is a passion of mine. I like to think I know plenty about myths and Gods. But why did you ask me, exactly?”</p>
<p>Dumbledore lit up like a Christmas tree, and clapping his hands with a pleased flare, said: “Oh my dear Minerva, then you’ll be delighted with the news I’m going to give you. You see, this year Hogwarts is going to have some exchange students from overseas, ten in total. They’re going to study our subjects, and will be sorted into our four houses, just like our wizards and witches here do. The only difference is... they are not magical beings.”</p>
<p>And at that, Minerva was sure she was going to have a nervous breakdown.</p>
<p>“Did you just say Muggles will be attending Hogwarts this year? Not only that, but American Muggles? How is that not against the Statute of Secrecy?!” Minerva started to stutter, getting paler and paler every second that passed.</p>
<p>“How are they going to learn what we teach here? Most subjects would be impossible for them to master, just like Charms, or Trasfiguration, and there’s Defence too--”<br/>
Minerva went on and on listing all the difficulties the new students would surely meet studying at Hogwarts, and came to the conclusion that among Dumbledore’s idiotic ideas, this was surely the dumbest and most utterly idiotic one, topped only by his idea of making Harry live with Lily’s sister’s family after the death of his parents. Thank God for Sirius and Remus, were able to take him with them instead.</p>
<p>“They are demigods, Minerva”.</p>
<p>Minerva gave up trying to find a sense in what Dumbledore was saying.</p>
<p>“Demigods?”</p>
<p>“Yes, demigods.” said Dumbledore, running a hand through his beard, the other still on his desk.</p>
<p>“Since you know lots about Greek mythology, you must know that in the Greek pantheon there is a Goddess of Magic, Hecate, who’s also the Goddess of Choices and Crossroads. There are plenty of myths in which her powers were able to defeat evil and bring glory to the heroes that were blessed by her protection. But I thought, as I’m sure you do too, that they were just stories, created to teach important lessons. Fascinating stories, yes, but just stories. So you can imagine my surprise when this morning the very Goddess of Magic came bursting through my office door, demanding that I take ten of her most powerful demigods to teach them magic, here.”</p>
<p>Albus looked poised even after what he had just revealed, and kept looking at Minerva with a calm expression.</p>
<p>“She told me it was time that the children of the Gods met her own children. That we have been apart for too long, and that this period of peace both of our sides have finally reached should be used to reconnect and to learn about each other again, as both parts have forgotten one another.</p>
<p>“I, for a change, have found that even at my age, life never stops surprising you. I look forward to this exchange, Minerva, and I’m sure you do too. That’s why I’m asking you to help me set up a welcoming committee, in order to prepare for our guests’ stay in the best way possible and make them feel welcome not only in the Wizarding World, but also in the United Kingdom. I’m aware you have countless things to take care of, with the reformation of our entire school program, but I trust you’ll be able to find some spare time to dedicate to this new, exciting task. It’s not like you’ll be doing all the work on your own anyway. I’ll be the one who’ll organise the majority of our guests’ stay, don’t worry. I’d just like to be able to consult you from time to time to make sure I’ve found the best way to accommodate our guests. Wouldn’t want to upset the children of so many powerful deities, am I right? So, what do you say, Minerva? Any questions?”.</p>
<p>The only thought inside the professor’s head since the word “Hecate” had left the old Headmaster’s mouth was very simple. <em>“I’m dreaming”</em>.</p>
<p>“So, Ancient Greek Gods exist, all the myths we’ve always thought were legends are actually real, demigods are going to attend Hogwarts, and if we do something wrong, we could have the Gods’ fury set upon us?”</p>
<p>“Exactly.”</p>
<p>Minerva sat down heavily on the chair.</p>
<p>
  <em>I guess there’s no way we can have a normal year here at Hogwarts. School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, now open to demigods too.</em>
</p>
<p>“Merlin help us”.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>⸙⸙⸙⸙⸙</p>
</center><p>In the meantime, the atmosphere at Camp Half-Blood had definitely changed.</p>
<p>“Like hell Annabeth and I are ditching University just to go to a fucking wizardry school across the ocean!!”</p>
<p>Percy Jackson was yelling in the face of an Olympian once again.</p>
<p>Red faced, hands curled into punches, Percy was shamelessly yelling obscenities at Hecate, Goddess of Magic.</p>
<p>His girlfriend Annabeth Chase was by his side, silent for once, letting her boyfriend lash out at her Royal Olympic Ass as he pleased.</p>
<p>Annabeth remembered fearing the Gods, once. She used to fear what would happen to her if she were to disrespect them, if she didn’t follow their orders and grant their wishes.<br/>
Now after all the things she had been through, two wars, Tartarus and the countless monsters she’d fought alongside Percy and her friends since age 12, it was safe to say she didn’t care at all, not anymore.</p>
<p>None of them cared anymore, especially Percy, who since the beginning had always been very vocal about all the wrongs the Olympians had done to their children.</p>
<p>After a life like theirs, it was difficult to care, and the Gods knew that too.</p>
<p>That was why Her Royal Assholeness, the Queen of the Witches, was standing still, her arms crossed over her chest, clearly trying not to incinerate the son of Poseidon on the spot and quietly listening to what he had to say.</p>
<p>There were eight other people silently listening to the demigod, all seated around the ping-pong table in Chiron’s office where the Cabin Councils were usually held.</p>
<p>Jason, Piper, Nico, Will, Frank, Hazel, Leo and Calypso made up the rest of Hecate’s “DD-Team”, as she had called it, the Goddess of Magic’s “Dream Demigod Team, the best of the best, <em>la crème de la crème</em>, the ones who will surely astonish the wizards and witches of Hogwarts like no one else ever could!” she had sung happily only a few minutes prior, all giddy and joyful.</p>
<p>She had interrupted their lunch time by appearing right in the centre of the dining hall, demanding they instantly stopped what they were doing and came with her to talk in Chiron’s office. Once there, more irritated than ever, the ten demigods had sat down and listened to Hecate tell them about the existence of a Magic School across the ocean, in Scotland, and about her desire to expand knowledge about the magical world to more people, starting with Greek demigods. She had begun talking about the school and the Wizarding World, presenting the task she was about to offer them as an opportunity to learn about arts denied to the minds of most people in the world. Oh, the knowledge that they’d find there, waiting for them to be discovered again and shared to all the other demigods!</p>
<p>This sounds too good to be true. Thought Annabeth, in part intrigued by what Hecate was promising them, in part knowing she was, as every God they had had the misfortune to meet, certainly failing to mention the downsides of the task to them.</p>
<p>Just as this thought crossed her mind Percy spoke up, demanding clear and practical information about the task. Would they really have to just study magic? There will be no one to fight, no risking their lives? Because he sure as hell wasn’t going to risk his life now that he had a possible future with Annabeth in New Rome.</p>
<p>At that, Hecate stopped her monologue and looked down at the ten demigods, in the eye, one by one, as if she couldn’t believe what she had heard.</p>
<p>“I’m offering you a year at the most important Wizarding School in the world! I can’t believe-”</p>
<p>“A year?! Are you crazy?” shouted Percy standing up from his chair, looking red in the face and positively livid.</p>
<p>“I know you Gods don’t care about time, but have you, for even just one second, stopped to reflect about what would possibly mean to us to spend a whole year of our lives overseas?! What are we, your dolls?! We have lives here, people we care about!”.</p>
<p>Hecate simply laughed at that, her dark blue dress swinging and shining like a night sky full of stars, as if it was laughing along with her.</p>
<p>“Oh come on son of Poseidon, would you really give up that kind of knowledge for a single year of your life? That’s insane and you know it too. Daughter of Athena, you certainly are wiser than your boyfriend. I know you understand the power I’m putting in your hands. I hope you’ll make him realise that a year is just the little price to pay to become the most powerful demigods that ever walked on this earth. Hazel, my dear, you too!”.</p>
<p>Hazel looked away, determined not to get involved with any of Hecate’s plans.</p>
<p>Annabeth after the Goddess’ words slowly rose from her seat, looking more tired than she usually let herself show, and reached her boyfriend’s side, not speaking a word, ignoring the Olympian’s gaze.</p>
<p>“I know perfectly well that what you are offering us is of inestimable value, Hecate” she said, watching as the Goddess smiled triumphantly at her.<br/>
“But” she said, stopping the Olympian from interrupting her.</p>
<p>“I also know that I’m speaking for all of us when I say this: we are tired. Tired of tasks, tired of everything that doesn’t revolve around our personal world. We are tired of never living as if we were simple teenagers, of leaving our friends and families behind because you Gods need our help. You can’t ask us to leave everything we know a year after a war. When we have just found something that actually resembles normality.”</p>
<p>Annabeth sighed, looking exhausted.</p>
<p>“Some of us have plans for the future, and you can’t ask us to do something like that without keeping that in account” said the daughter of Athena with an air of finality that left the atmosphere chilly and full of suspense.</p>
<p>The room stayed silent for the longest time.</p>
<p>Then Percy started yelling at Hecate again, as Annabeth and the others silently watched.</p>
<p>After what felt like an eternity, Percy stopped his raging and sat back on his seat, his hands on his head, trying to control his breath.</p>
<p>Hecate, impassive, studied the looks on the demigods’ faces, looking for a tiny trace of sympathy, a clue that not everyone of them agreed with Perseus and Annabeth’s views. As she found nothing, she sighed deeply, ready to pull out her last card, her last possibility of convincing at least some of them to take the chance she was giving them.</p>
<p>“I can’t understand how you feel, demigods. But I won’t force you to take the extremely generous opportunity I’m offering you, if you really don’t want to.</p>
<p>I must say though, that I don’t think you can make this decision yet.” Her eyes fled around the room, registering the reactions of the demigods at her words. They looked wary, but willing to listen to her reasons, so she decided to continue.</p>
<p>“Afterall, you don’t even know how much that type of power can help you defeat monsters in a fight.”</p>
<p>The demigods’ faces suddenly looked a little bit more interested in what the Goddess had to say.</p>
<p>“You will learn how to read the stars to predict the future! You’d be able to predict which place is safer for camping, which zones are best to avoid!”</p>
<p>No particular reaction at that.</p>
<p> “And how to care for magical plants! How to prepare healing potions as effective as, if not more than, ambrosia!”</p>
<p>At that, Will started to look very interested in that kind of knowledge, thinking as always about his patients and how to improve his abilities and the treatments available at the Camp’s infirmary.</p>
<p>Hecate noticed the progress, but still, one demigod was not enough. She needed to convince at least four more.</p>
<p>“You will learn how to cast spells! You’ll be able to summon objects, and levitate them, and lots of other things!”</p>
<p>Absolutely nothing.</p>
<p>“And curses! And protecting shields!”</p>
<p>That seemed to do the magic, as the demigods – even Hazel, who at first had seemed the most reticent of all, were now staring at her with a pointed look.</p>
<p>The daughter of Pluto especially was looking at her as if she were trying to read her mind, her arms crossed over her chest, her spatha always secured to her hip.</p>
<p><em>Oh Dear Me, she’d be so good at Legilimency</em>, the Goddess couldn’t help but think.</p>
<p>“Shields?” asked Jason, looking skeptical but rather intrigued by the thought.</p>
<p>“Exactly, son of Zeus, shields. And weapons. And, potentially, anything that could help you gain the victory in battle.”</p>
<p>And as the demigods started to look around, trying to read their friends’ thoughts through their expressions, Hecate knew she had won.</p>
<p>“You don’t have to communicate your decision to me yet,” said the Goddess, a sly smile dancing on her face, partially obscured by her long, curly raven hair.</p>
<p>“Take your time to think about it. Obviously I don’t mean to fret, but is there anyone, by any chance, who is already sure about their plans?”.</p>
<p>Will shrugged, casting a side glance to Nico, as to question him silently.</p>
<p>It was clear as day that the son of Apollo really wanted to grab the opportunity and leap into this new adventure, Nico on the other hand sported an unreadable blank expression, that made it nearly impossible to understand which thoughts were crossing his mind.</p>
<p>Their eyes met halfway. They stood there staring at each other for the longest time, until finally both of them smiled widely and turned their heads back to their original position, facing the Goddess of Magic and looking at her in the eye.</p>
<p>“Okay, we’re in.” said Nico, simply taking Will’s hand into his. “We both always wanted to visit the UK, and there seem to be lots of interesting ways we can get better at fighting attending this school. So yeah, we’re in.”</p>
<p>“Well, then I think I’d like to go too.” said Calypso, a tiny excited smile gracing her lips. She wasn’t a demigod, but Hecate had chosen her too regardless, mostly thinking about how the Wizards of Hogwarts would be amazed by her presence and story. Afterall, it’s not everyday that you meet a girl who’s been alive for millenia and has met at least half of the most important Greek heroes!</p>
<p>“I want to learn everything I can while I’m given the chance.” Turning to Leo, who was sitting right beside her, she whispered sweetly “You coming?”.</p>
<p>Leo looked kind of guilty after hearing how eager his girlfriend was to go overseas. He shrugged, struggling to find a way to tell her that he didn’t know whether he wanted to go or not.</p>
<p>“I-I…”</p>
<p>He felt exhausted, just as Annabeth had said, and in his heart he felt like he couldn’t stand to be a part of yet another adventure.</p>
<p>But, on the other hand, what would he do here at Camp, if he decided not to go?</p>
<p>He had been enjoying what life felt like at Camp Half-Blood: he loved having enough spare time to both work on all of Bunker 9’s projects, and spend his afternoons with his friends and his girlfriend, just joking and playing Camp games. Having fun.</p>
<p>He had been loving the slow rhythm that scanned his days at Camp, but Leo knew how he worked, just like he knew any other machine at Bunker 9: he would get bored, in the end, terribly bored, and with his girlfriend and friends gone, what was he supposed to do, all alone?</p>
<p>Sure, he could pass his time developing new devices, working on new projects, but did he really want to spend all of his free time like that?</p>
<p>“I think I have to think about it.. I don’t know.”</p>
<p>Calypso’s smile seemed to fade a bit at first, but it was quickly replaced by a wider, sweeter, warmer one, as she took Leo’s hand into hers.</p>
<p>Hazel and Frank were arguing quietly about New Rome and their praetor duties, wondering if it was even possible for them to participate in this “exchange program”.</p>
<p>Since Hecate had first told them of her “offer”, the daughter of Pluto couldn’t help but feel suspicious. It all sounded too good, and not risky at all. That was usually the first warning signal, when it came to Gods’ offers: is there no risk to take? Absolutely nothing to lose? Then it’s a scam, gurl, 100%.</p>
<p>Also, she wasn’t sure she felt completely comfortable with the thought of becoming a real “witch”, like her mother was.</p>
<p>But after Hecate’s talk, she admitted she now felt kind of curious about the Goddess’ proposal.</p>
<p>Okay well, being completely honest, Hazel was more than just “kind of curious” about the whole thing.</p>
<p>If what Hecate had told them was true, then the magic they taught at Hogwarts was very different from demigods’ idea of magic, which basically consisted of manipulating the Mist. And if it could really help them, then declining her offer would be an idiotic move to say the least.</p>
<p>But her particular relationship with anything related to magic wasn’t the only problem that was holding her (and Frank) back.</p>
<p>“Honestly, I’d like to go, but what about Camp? We are Preators, we have duties, and responsibilities, we can’t just leave!” said Frank, in part sad, in part resigned. There was no way they could attend that school without giving up their Praetor status, and did they really want to? They were amazing Praetors, afterall.</p>
<p>“Maybe we can coordinate the Camp from abroad. We’re not in war times, we’re not living particularly difficult situations. And it’s not like they’d be helpless without us, anyway. We could nominate two substitutes at Camp, as representative figures, and we could still participate at Senate meetings via IM. We’ll have to put this at vote, obviously… But we could try to make it work, if you’re sure you want to go.”</p>
<p>Frank looked down at her, a mildly nervous look in his eyes, and smiled, nodding fiercely, making Hazel grin.</p>
<p>“Annabeth and I are not going!” said Percy suddenly, just as Hazel was opening her mouth to tell Hecate about her and Frank’s decision.</p>
<p>Silence fell among the other demigods, who were now all looking at Percy and Annabeth, who sat right next to the other with hard expressions on their faces.</p>
<p>“That’s okay, son of Poseidon. That’s your choice.” said Hecate with a soothing voice, refraining from showing just how disappointed she was that the two most important and powerful demigods in the last millenia had decided to let her down. Wizards would have loved the stories about their adventures so much!</p>
<p>“We’re sorry guys, but you know we’ve been planning to go to University in New Rome for the longest time. We hope you’ll have fun anyway.” said Annabeth with a big smile on her face, not looking apologetic at all despite what she had just said. Percy rested his left hand or her right thigh, looking just as sorry as his girlfriend, enjoying the soft feeling of her skin on his palm with a tender look on his face.</p>
<p>However, the Goddess’ disappointment at the loss of Percy and Annabeth faded away as soon as Jason Grace and Piper McLean accepted her offer.</p>
<p>They had decided to break up last spring, not because they didn’t love each other, but because it was clear to them that their relationship had skipped several important landmarks, and neither of them were happy with that. After almost a year of feeling like they knew nothing about each other that was true and arguing about it, they knew they had to do something.</p>
<p>There was no point in making that unhealthy relationship prosper any longer, so they decided to just give it another go, this time starting at friends, getting to know each other for real and sharing real adventures, and engaging in this type of venture certainly seemed a perfect way to do that.</p>
<p>Hecate smiled, once again, a triumphant expression visible all over her face.</p>
<p>“That’s all settled then! Son of Haephestus, I’m going to give you three more days to think about my offer. Who knows, perhaps you won’t be the only one who will reflect on it.” Hecate smirked, directing a knowing glance at Percy and Annabeth, who still sat together, holding hands, and were now glaring at her.</p>
<p>“I’ll see you in three days, demigods.”</p>
<p>And with that, the Goddess of Magic twirled her gown and disappeared in a cloud of pitch black smoke, savouring the sweet taste of power and triumph.</p>
