    <p>Mary Lou's mother was the first to notice that something was wrong. She observed the eldest of the two children, his lips slightly parted, snuffling and sniffling like he was suffering from a cold, and immediately began to wonder if her daughter had noticed his discomfort.</p><p>As she watched, the eight-year old climbed onto a step stool, carrying a stack of dirty dishes to the sink. And although he tried to lower them slowly and carefully into the sink, his hands were shaking so badly that the dishes slid from his grasp, showering the kitchen counter in a wave of soapy water.</p><p>"Credence!" Mary Lou's response was quick, the child cowering in fear at the sound of his mother's voice. Her head turned, eyeing the dirty dishwater that had spilled onto the floor. "Look at this mess! Honestly, Credence. I give you the simplest of tasks and you can't even do that right."</p><p>"Leave the boy alone," her mother snapped, intervening just as Mary Lou had risen from her seat. She nodded in Credence's direction, her tone gentle as she spoke. "Look at him, Mary Lou. Isn't it obvious that something is troubling him?"</p><p>Her daughter's hand, already curled around Credence's wrist, tightened, ready to yank the poor child off the step stool.</p><p>"Troubling him?" echoed Mary Lou, glaring at her mother from across the room. "This child has been having problems since the day he came home!"</p><p>"And you never wondered why or thought to remedy the situation?"</p><p>By now Credence had curled in on himself, blackened tendrils rising up and curling around his chest. He could feel them weaving through his ribcage, coiling around his lungs and making it difficult to breathe.</p><p>His baby sister began to cry, and he slumped against the counter, twitching and staring at the floor. The next thing he knew Mary Lou had him by the shoulders, shaking him and calling his name. His grandmother was yelling too, demanding that she unhand the child, and all the while Chastity continued to hiccup and sob.</p><p>Mary Lou's mother pushed her chair out, looking from Credence to Chastity and back again. She then leaned over and lifted the baby from her highchair. "It's no wonder the boy never received proper care if this is the way you run your household," she said, cradling the infant against her chest.</p><p>Credence groaned and shook his head, the blackness retreating, allowing him to breathe once more. He placed a tiny hand against his chest, gasping and looking up at his grandmother as she came around the table.</p><p>Mary Lou took a step back, her fists clenched at her sides. There was nothing she hated more than her mother interfering with the way she raised her children. "And what do you suppose is wrong with him?" she asked, forcing herself to remain calm. "I've thought for a number of years that the child is possessed, perhaps something demonic or maybe even a - "</p><p>"Nonsense!" her mother said sharply, cutting her off in midsentence. "Look at him, Mary Lou. He's breathing through his mouth and can hardly catch his breath. And it doesn't appear as though he's capable of paying attention for long periods of time."</p><p>Mary Lou visibly relaxed, tilting her head and giving her mother a curious expression.</p><p>"You read the papers, don't you, my dear?" asked Mary Lou's mother, pausing to adjust her hold on the squirming infant. "You read about the riots that took place three years ago, correct?"</p><p>Indeed, Mary Lou had read the papers and listened to the stories on the radio. She recalled how dozens of children had been taken in for surgery, the operations performed on site at the schools in New York's Lower East Side. But Credence, having been given a private education at home in his mother's church, was never exposed to such things.</p><p>She remembered how such practices had been encouraged, offering a solution for children who were considered disobedient, restless and who often had difficulty paying attention in class. It was also recommended for children who suffered from headaches and sleeping problems. Credence experienced all of this on a regular basis, and was often seen dozing off in church.</p><p>"Ma?" Credence's voice broke her train of thought. He was leaning with one hand against the counter, his breathing steady though not without a bit of effort. "Am I in trouble?"</p><p>"No," Mary Lou replied. "But we're going to the doctor this afternoon. He needs to have a look at your nose and throat."</p><p>"Why?" squeaked Credence, now trembling from head to toe. "What's wrong with my nose and throat?"</p><p>"Nothing much." Mary Lou brushed aside his question as though it meant nothing. "But I think you've got adenoids. Best to have the doctor take a look before it becomes a problem."</p><p align="center">.oOo.</p><p>Mary Lou left Chastity in the care of her mother, bidding them farewell as she took Credence by the hand and led him out the door. Together they began the long walk to the doctor's office, the boy tentatively following, wondering why his mother insisted on taking him to the doctor.</p><p>He'd been thinking that something was wrong for quite some time now, all those nights he'd spent lying awake in bed, his fingers digging into his chest, wishing he could tear this creature from his flesh. The experience was truly terrifying for someone as young as Credence, and yet he'd never been able to discuss it with his mother. Not unless he wanted another senseless beating for having the nerve to talk about his problems.</p><p>It was a sorry state of affairs when a child feared his mother more than the monster he'd become. Even now, though she said she would take him somewhere he could receive proper care and attention, he doubted that she was telling the truth.</p><p>"We're here, Credence." These words were followed by a faint jingling, the bells dangling from the wall over the doorway announcing their arrival.</p><p>Credence lifted his head, glancing nervously around the room. There was a chair in the doctor's office, its padded cushions covered in rich black leather. It looked similar to the type of chair one would normally see at the dentist, and before he knew what was happening, his mother had slid her hands under his arms, lifting him into the chair.</p><p>The small child cowered in his seat, wearing the wide-eyed expression of a deer caught in the headlights. The doctor appeared at his side, wearing a round mirror strapped to his forehead, his white coat pressed and clean.</p><p>"Ah, miss Barebone," the doctor said, smiling pleasantly as he addressed Credence's mother. "What seems to be the trouble?"</p><p>"Everything," Mary Lou began, her tone thoroughly exasperated. "My son breathes through his mouth like some uncultured swine. He's constantly falling asleep in church, though he has difficulty sleeping at night. And he has trouble focusing on and completing simple tasks."</p><p>"I see." The doctor rubbed his chin thoughtfully. "Anything else? Any earaches, sinus infections, that sort of thing?"</p><p>"No, nothing like that. But he often runs a fever and has trouble putting on weight, though I can't imagine why. I feed him plenty of healthy meals, lots of pea soup so it's not as though he's malnourished."</p><p>"Alright then." The doctor turned and looked at the boy, noting his gaunt appearance and scrawny build. "Let's have a look, shall we?"</p><p>He reached for a tongue depressor on the tray beside the chair, picking it up and instructing the child to open his mouth. Credence hesitated, squirming uncomfortably in his seat.</p><p>"Come on now. I'm not going to hurt you."</p><p>As if Credence trusted him enough to believe that was true. Practically everyone he'd ever known had hurt him in some way. Why would this man be any different?</p><p>A shiver traced its way along Credence's spine, his mouth opening as blackened wisps of smoke slid past his lips. He knew what was happening, knew but was unable to stop himself, the ghostly tendrils spiraling before his eyes then quickly vanishing into thin air.</p><p>The doctor must have seen this fragment of smoke, his jaw dropping momentarily, blinking and staring at the peculiar child. Mary Lou, who was standing off to the side with her arms folded across her chest, only saw the doctor's reaction to this bizarre anomaly.</p><p>"What is it?" she asked. "What do you see?"</p><p>"I'm not sure," the doctor said slowly. He reached up and switched on the overhead light, then removed one of the tools from the tray. This gleaming metal instrument disappeared into Credence's mouth, the mirror on the end giving him a better look at the patient's throat.</p><p>The doctor leaned in for a closer look, a minute passing before he laid the instruments on the tray and took Mary Lou by the wrist, leading her away from the chair.</p><p>Credence heard nothing of their whispered conversation, his mother's expression grim, nodding and glancing in her son's direction. When the doctor returned, he summoned his nurse and moved towards the sink, filling an aluminum cup with water and placing it over a gas flame.</p><p>There was a soft plink of metal against metal, the doctor taking one of his surgical tools and dropping it in the aluminum cup as the water began to boil. The tool he'd selected was roughly the length of a pencil, similar in size and thickness with a curved blade on one end.</p><p>Credence was still, watching the steam coming off the bubbling liquid. He started slightly when the nurse entered his field of vision, seeing her move towards him with an apron in her hands.</p><p>"It's alright, dear," said the nurse, bending over and draping the red rubber apron over his chest. "Lean forward, please." Credence complied with her request, allowing her to tie the apron straps behind his neck.</p><p>The boy shrank back in his chair, his gaze lingering on the white enamel bowl the nurse thrust under his chin. "What are you going to do?" he croaked hoarsely, barely able to find his voice.</p><p>"Now don't you worry," the doctor soothed, removing his chosen instrument from the boiling water. "This won't take two seconds. Just open your mouth and it'll be over before you know it."</p><p>The boy refused, inhaling sharply and pressing his lips together.</p><p>"Credence," said Mary Lou, her tone harsh, demanding his attention. She approached the chair, her body radiating a deadly aura. "You do as he says, young man. Or mark my words there will be consequences."</p><p>A low whimper cut through the silence. Credence was terrified, his heart beating a fierce tempo against his ribs. He could feel the Obscurus closing around his lungs, suffocating him with its vicelike grip.</p><p>Against his better judgement, Credence opened his mouth, the little boy gasping for breath. The doctor leaned over him, taking advantage of the boy's need for oxygen. The blade glinted in the florescent lights before being inserted into Credence's throat, and the hand that held the blade give four or five quick twists, slicing out a section of tissue above the roof of his mouth.</p><p>Credence uttered a low, gurgling groan, blood pouring from his mouth and spilling into the bowl under his chin. He tried to scream, but was nearly choking on the scarlet fluid that was cascading down the back of his throat.</p><p>He pitched forward suddenly, the entire roof of his mouth on fire with tremendous pain. The nurse gave him several thumps on the back, and Credence retched, filling the bowl with blood and shredded lumps of flesh.</p><p>"Spit everything out," the nurse was saying, but her voice barely registered in his mind. "That's a good boy. You'll be alright in a minute."</p><p>"Wh-what?" Credence managed between harsh, wheezing gasps. Without thinking, he seized his mother's hand and held on tight, only to have it torn from his grasp as Mary Lou stepped away from her son.</p><p>"Those were your adenoids," the doctor stated calmly, as though he were discussing plans for afternoon tea. "You'll be able to breathe much better through your nose after this."</p><p>Credence's harsh groans gave way to wretched sobbing, his sight swimming as the nurse wiped his mouth with a wet washcloth. He slumped sideways in his seat, groggy from the sudden loss of blood, only to be lifted out of the chair moments later.</p><p>His mother was talking, the noise a distant murmur, droning like an insect in his mind. She didn't notice when he coughed and placed a hand over his mouth, a warm trickle of blood oozing from his nostrils as she led him out the door.</p><p>"We'll get you home," said Mary Lou, taking his hand. "Come now, boy. Don't be difficult."</p><p>Credence took three steps before sinking to the ground, his mouth opening in wordless torment. It hurt to breathe, his every breath burning against the raw edges where they'd removed his adenoids. He soon found that it was impossible to breathe through his nose, the blood clots and swelling completely blocking his nasal passages.</p><p>"Ma," he whimpered, only to receive a swat on the bum.</p><p>"Get up!" Mary Lou shouted, giving him another swat and yanking him onto his feet. The poor boy then continued to walk the rest of the way home, keeping his mouth shut for fear of retaliation from his mother.</p><p align="center">.oOo.</p><p>Mary Lou's mother was waiting for them when they returned home, wearing an expression of greatest sympathy as she greeted them at the door.</p><p>She knelt beside him, and Credence practically fell into her arms, weeping and burying his face in the crook of her neck. "Let's get him into bed so he can rest," she said, rubbing Credence's back in an effort to calm the crying child. "After all, he's just had an operation."</p><p>Mary Lou rolled her eyes, taking a step back and allowing her mother to comfort her son. She was tired of listening to Credence whimper and moan, her ears ringing from the sound of her son's broken, hiccuping sobs.</p><p>The child was lifted off the floor and carried upstairs, his eyes closing the moment he was placed atop the mattress and covered with a blanket.</p><p>His grandmother placed a chair beside his bed, sitting beside him and covering his hand with hers. "That won't be the last time you'll visit the doctor in your life," she said gently. "With a bit of luck, they won't do you much harm." She then lifted her hand and stroked his hair, her fingers drifting downward, brushing against his cheek.</p><p>Credence blinked sleepily at her, his eyelids beginning to droop. Within minutes he had fallen asleep, wrapped in warmth and comfort now that he was finally home.</p>
