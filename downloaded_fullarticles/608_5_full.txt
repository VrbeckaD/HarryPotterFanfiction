    <p align="left">It was a dark night, with stars so dim they were hardly there at all. As if the stars themselves were ashamed to witness the horrendous acts that had been achieved that night. It was on this sad and chilly Hallows eve that Hagrid brought a 1 year old Harrison James Potter to the Dursley's cold off-white door.</p><p>Sirius had looked beside himself with hysteria when he handed Hagrid the wee Potter all wrapped up in his thickest baby blanket and his flying motor bike before apparating away; so when Dumbledor said to take him to number 4 Privet Dr, Hagrid did so with only a passing thought about the boys Godfather.</p><p>The Dursley’s were less....awed...at the newly orphaned boy's story, than Hagrid had expected. In fact they had appeared quite upset from the moment the door had swung open. No matter, they would take the baby Potter and raise him like their own. Hagrid gave the Dursley’s some advice as he dropped Harry into Petunias frail arms.</p><p>“Try to keep some weight on the boy; keeps ‘em strong ‘eh.” Hagrid grinned as he gave a chocolate frog to Harry. The smiling baby clenched the flailing frog in his tiny fist, as he tried to suck its head from its body. “Smart one, ‘e is. Takes most a few tries to stop it from jumping ‘way.” Grinning at the small toddler staring at him with wide brown eyes, hiding behind his father's meaty calf; Hagrid handed a chocolate frog to Dudley, laughing as he ran from the hopping chocolate.</p><p>Clapping his meaty paw on Vernon’s shoulder, Hagrid grinned at the strange look in Vernon’s eyes. “Do be careful to take good care of ‘arrison. Lots ‘o folks owe dis kid their life, and would do just about anything for ‘im;” he softly chuckled; “You be lucky the Ministry hastily agreed to block all owls sent to wee Harry until his Hogwarts letter."</p><p>Tickling Harry's cheek and handing a white faced Petunia a stack of pounds and pair of glasses, Hagrid clapped Vernon on the shoulder one last time and then left. The Dursley’s stayed unnaturally still, until the escaped chocolate frog jumped on Dudley’s head. As if someone had pressed play on a metal song with their volume on max; the scream of outrage Vernon released as he snatched the frog off Dudley, rang all around the cul de sac.</p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>A week later, saw the Dursley’s home alight with random lights and noises that went off when someone entered a room Harry was in. Petunia would often have to push a floating Harry back down into Dudley’s old high chair whenever she served peas, it was apparently the magical boys favorite food. If the intense giggling was anything to go by, Harry was impressed with her method of cooking sweet peas.</p><p>Petunia quickly learned that however pleased Harry was with her cooking, his approval did not extend to her family for much longer. Dudley and Harry fought often, usually resulting in a crying Harry stood alone facing a corner of the wall in punishment and an upset Dudley. Vernon swore the only reason he put up with it at all, was because "<em>the ruckus had finally stopped happening whenever someone was so unfortunate as to walk into a room that </em>he <em>was in</em>."</p><p>Vernon and Harry's mutual dislike grew much faster and fiercer than Harry's dislike of Dudley. By the second week, if Vernon even approached Harry, the boy would disappear and reappear next to Petunia. Petunia attempted to soothe Vernon with tales of how her sister seemed to disappear after 11, but that caused Vernon to rant and rave about how horrible 9 more years of this would be. Petunia soon found herself agreeing with him.</p><p>After one hellish fight between the boys, that resulted in Dudley taking on this horrendous pink hue, Vernon locked the freak into the cupboard and chose to ignore the boy's existence. That Thanksgiving, Vernon took charge, and forbid the magical menace from ever leaving the cupboard unless told to. The surprisingly perceptive child began to wail when his pamper was soaked, or when he was hungry, but never once did he exit the cupboard without permission. Vernon would close the door to the cupboard if Harry cried unnecessarily and instructed Petunia to feed him only once a day.</p><p>The harsh treatment of someone so young should have rattled her humanity but it was hard to feel pity for a creature that terrified you. Wizards and Witches were dangerous beasts in the shape of humans and they had just enough kindness to stay away from normal people. Except Lily. Lily hadn't stayed away from normal people. She'd barged into every stage of Petunia's adolescence and not only made it all about her but also attacked and bullied Petunia until she submit to her. Whats worse their parents would always proclaim Lily innocent and that every attack was an accident.</p><p>Petunia still remembered the day she stood up to Saint Lily and had been in the river in the blink of an eye. Her own 14th birthday and she had been chastised for how she bossed around a slovenly troll of a girl; Petunia hadn't even wanted her there but Lily had demanded she apologize and shoved her when she refused. Petunia had remembered standing to her full height and looming over Lily before slapping her across the face.</p><p>Petunia had drowned that day. Just like that. Adult wizards had arrived to retrieve and revive her; leaving her mother to weep over her waterlogged form as they didn't even try to warm her chilled body. Something Petunia knew they could do, as she had the burnt sweater from the time she'd told Lily's beggar friend to bugger off back to his swamp. With her mother blubbering over her, Petunia could just barely hear her father ask why they didn't stop her from falling in the river in the first place. Only for the awful men to reply that it <em>"wasn't their job to prevent accidental magic only to fix muggles affected by it".</em></p><p>It was that incident, coincidentally, that had killed her relationship with her sister and retroactively looking back, Petunia could tell that was when her parents had stopped overtly praising Lily and that that was also the year Lily stopped showing up for winter holiday. It had taken her near death for her parents to begin to fear magic, but Petunia was not her parents. She had told her husband every story she could remember and together they had sworn that this magical menace would bring no harm to their family.</p><p> </p><p>But at 5 years old Harry had his first outbreak of accidental magic since he'd turned 2. 2 was the age when his eyes had suddenly stopped working and the Potter glasses wrapped in his baby blanket had flown onto his face. Vernon had laughed and had promised to never replace them if the were lost or broken.</p><p>Sitting on the floor of the cupboard Harry had called out to Petunia in the kitchen, "Go potty?" and ran when she called out an affirmative. On his way back to the cupboard, Dudley sprang out at him. Dudley had been watching television all day and wanted to wrestle with the only other person his size. Dudley, who was 8 days older and 7 kg heavier, completely squished Harry with all the grace of the average toddler and banged Harry's head into the floor.</p><p>Only Harry's head bounced off the floor as if it were made of rubber and with enough force to throw them both into the legs of a table in the hallway. A table that held a single lit candle on it. And wouldn't you know it, that candle teetered over and almost fell on Harry but he was saved by a frustrated Dudley pushing him off of him. This unfortunately left only Dudley in the path of the heated wax and heavy glass container. </p><p>Petunia would hear Dudley's screams in her nightmares for weeks after because she'd been in the kitchen and hadn't seen it happen. But Vernon had seen it; he'd even encouraged his son to play with Harry, thinking no harm because of the size difference in the boys. He'd recounted to Petunia how unnaturally the freakish boy's head had swollen and resembled a ball.</p><p>"That fall wouldn't have injured him Pet! It might have hurt, but <em>he </em> wouldn't have needed a hospital. His <em>magic</em> overreacted and he <em>hurt</em> our boy!" Vernon cried as they cuddled their son, tuckered out from his hospital visit. Petunia sighed somberly and nodded. "It always will, darling. That's how this magic stuff works when their little. It gives them things they want and attacks those around them. My father used to say it was because magic children were usually raised by magical families who could protect themselves, and he used that as an excuse to let her do whatever she wanted."</p><p>Vernon gave pause and looked at his wife. Like <em>really</em> looked at his wife. Her face was pinched and mournful as her weary eyes stared listlessly at the bandages on their son. Just then Vernon saw his wife, a woman who had been beaten down by magic all her life, and felt pitiful. "You said you drowned. I heard it when you said it but it hadn't clicked until now. Your freakish sister nearly killed you and you accepted her freak son anyway."</p><p>"I feared what would happen if I said no." Vernon shifted Dudley into Petunias frail arms and gathered her into his arms to whisper in her hair. "I won't let that freak and his <em>magic </em>hurt Dudley and I'll show you that you don't have to be afraid anymore." The Dursley family went to sleep that night cursing magic and with not a kind thought towards the mere 5 year old they had left whipped and locked in a cupboard with no meal for the day.</p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>For 4 years Vernon aggressively belittled, spanked, and punished Harry for anything remotely magical. His severe persecution grew to near paranoia, and Harry learned to keep to himself but not to stray to far from everyone else. Vernon reacted badly if Harry tried to make a friend, and not many kids were willing to talk to the skinny kid in too big clothes, whose own guardian called him freak instead of his name. The only bullying he suffered though, was Dudley who had claimed he was the only one allowed to touch Harry at the start of Year 2.</p><p>Harry often felt invisible at school and an unwanted burden at home.</p><p>He was only given Dudleys old clothes, only fed once, only allowed in the living room to show Petunia his homework, and never allowed ask for things. If he need a new chewed on pencil or wanted a dusty blanket, he was expected to sit on a stool to the left of the cupboard door and not say a word until spoken to. He'd had to clean Dudley's room for a dusty pillow, and sweep the driveway for a broken toy  Dudley didn't play with anymore. When h wasn't trading his service for goods he was in the cupboard, drawing, or reading, and making absolutely no noise. Pretending he didn't exist, as per uncle Vernon's request.</p><p>4 years had passed like this and Harry and Dudley had both turned 10 during the summer. Dudley had grown to be a great big mass of  boy, content to boss around those smaller than him and being just less than average in his studies. Harry however was tiny for his age, like he'd stopped growing at 7 and had learned to hover around just above average in his studies lest Petunia wack his knuckles in a home review. </p><p>The day the Dursley's had to finalize Harry and Dudley's Year 6 school registration would come to be a relief for two struggling families. Just this year, in March, Ms.Higgs had moved out of her home and almost immediately a younger woman had bought it. She had been renovating and expanding the home for only 6 months and just yesterday her two kids and husband had moved in all of their things. Petunia had kept close eyes on her new neighbors but hadn't thought that they'd be doing the same.</p><p>In fact, just as Petunia set out her door she was instantly greeted by a shorter, full-figured black woman.</p><p>"Hello neighbor. I've just come to greet you, and ask that you not register Harrison for muggle school this year of course." The stout woman smiled pleasantly at Petunia and didn't drop that smile when Petunia went from startled to hysterically running back into her home.</p><p>Petunia was already on the phone calling Vernon when the woman happily walked through her front door, the door Petunia knew she had locked behind her. The intruder simply nodded at her and gazed around the living room with a little chuckle. A slight frown appeared as she took in the endless pictures of Dudley that decorated the living room.</p><p>"Vernon one of those freaks is here and shes broken into our home!" Petunia winced at the sheer volume with which her husband cursed and then nodded one the volume was back at a respectable level. "I shall but I dont know if she'll be reasonable. Come home soon." With that last whimper, Petunia hung up the phone and forced her attention to the woman still pleasantly smiling at her.</p><p>"So what did he say?"</p><p>"You may return at 7pm so that we may discuss whatever <em>ridiculous</em> demands you have; but you must leave our house right this minute or I call the police."</p><p>A chuckle and a nod was all the shorter woman gave as a response before turning to leave, but she stopped in the threshold of the door and turned one outlined brown eye to Petunia. "Dont forget to only enroll Dudley this year. We have plans for Harrison, and this is the last year we can do it before Hogwarts." With that she turned and disappeared in broad daylight; right on the Dursley's front steps.</p><p>Shaken Petunia ran to the door and peeked to see if anyone saw, and when she saw no faces she slammed and locked the door. She grabbed an peach, two slices of bread, and poured a glass of water and put them in the cupboard with Harry. Harry, accustomed to his only meal being dinner, saw her tense face and the food and shrunk in on himself and accepted the food with wide watery eyes.</p><p>Those tears held on until the cupboard door closed, which it only did when Harry was in trouble, and he heard the sound of the lock clicking, Then they came rushing down in waves. He never got locked in unless his weird freakishness hurt Dudley and that almost never happened. Crawling to the tiny window, Harry could just barely see Petunia run out of the cul de sac in the direction of the school. She looked twitchy and he saw her almost trip over her own feet trying to avoid the newly fixed up Higgs house.</p><p>She did not return for hours. Dudley had gone to a friends house, and Harry guessed that's where he stayed until Petunia and Vernon picked him up that night. Harry had spent the day peeping out is tiny window, rationing his food, and playing with a cracked blue toy race car, so he noticed immediately when Vernon pulled into the driveway. And out popped the Dursleys at the same time that two of the darkest people he'd ever seen. Now Petunia's peeping made sense, the cul de sac they lived in had been all white for as long as Harry could remember, and the next one over had been claimed by Black and Portuguese families.</p><p>There was some gesturing from Vernon and a bit of indecipherable noise but a gesture from the tall bloke and Vernon stomped into the house, closely followed by everyone else. Harry ran to the door and listened as hard as he could. Once it seemed like everyone had settled down, Vernon growled out at the new neighbors.</p><p>"What do you want from us, we've got nothing for you..... unlessss you're looking to add a basement to that lovely new home of yours?" Hearing Vernon shift from aggressive to an almost pleasant drawl was unpleasant but Harry was suddenly glad that there was no basement on the Dursley home, he liked being able to see the sun.</p><p>"Hello Vernon and Petunia Dursley. It is very nice to see you both in person, for once. My name is Raem Iffirit and this is my wife Clarissa."</p><p>"Its nice to see you again Petunia. As our previous meeting was brief I was unable to fully explain to you what it’s to happen with young Harrison from henceforth.”</p><p>”You presume you much <em>Mrs.Iffirit</em>; to be able to tell me what is to happen to my sisters boy. And you waste your time; he isn’t here and never has been.”</p><p>Harry heard a feminine chuckle, that he assumed must have come from Mrs. Iffirit.</p><p>”Petunia dear-“</p><p>“Mrs.Dursley to you, thank you very much!”</p><p>”Petunia. Harrison is not your <em>“sister’s boy”</em>, he is your nephew. Not only that, I know he is here because this watch that I am wearing was charmed by Lily herself and it is a compass that points in whatever direction the Potter glasses are.”</p><p>”Preposterous-“</p><p>”Excuse me for cutting in ladies; but may I ask why you don’t want us to see Harry. We are merely trying to further his education in preparation for his future.”</p><p>Harry heard the smooth male voice cut in inquisitively and wondered a great many things all at once.</p><p>
  <em>What did these strangers want to teach him?</em>
</p><p>
  <em>How did they know his mother?</em>
</p><p>
  <em>What was so important about his future?</em>
</p><p>
  <em>How could a watch point at glasses on purpose?</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Why didn’t the Dursley’s want the Iffirits to know he was there?</em>
</p><p>Harry got the answer to all of his questions, whether he knew it or not, in Vernons next outburst.</p><p>”Now see here! You will not be teaching that freak how to be a better freak who can do freakish things on purpose! There will be no magic for the boy! It ends here!”</p><p>Harry froze and waited with bated breath. The strange male voice spoke again.</p><p>”I had hoped you all would be more reasonable than this. There is no way to avoid him going to school."</p><p>"I will not allow him to become like her!"</p><p>"Petunia darling, you cant suppress magic. Its as much a part of him as your green thumb or the strength in your husband. Its who he is."</p><p>"Its unnatural; and as long as its demanded that I raise him, he will be normal!"</p><p>"Pftt. As normal as he can be." Harry heard Vernon scoff. "Lost cause he is."</p><p>"We can make it so that you don't have to raise him. The spell your sister cast in her dying breath was blood magic, and its why you have Harry now."</p><p>"This <em>spell</em>, I remember a little. That big man said if me and Vernon divorced that I alone must keep Harry to extend his protection. From what he did not know."</p><p>"Regardless, we want to extend that protection. While still relieving you of your guardianship of Harrison. I can make you and Clarissa blood sisters by magic."</p><p>"Petunia dear; we are offering you a solution to your fears. Make me your sister so that my claim to Harry doesn't interrupt Lily's last action."</p><p>"Claim? What claim can you possibly have on that boy?"</p><p>"Lily didn't tell you? Well she never did get around to making up with you, after all. Godparents have superior claim to guardianship in Wizarding society. I can take him off you."</p><p>"You would take the boy? To what end? Where does that leave us?"</p><p>"Free to live your life, free of magical influence. We can even wipe your memory of all magic; you'd never again remember the trouble its caused you."</p><p>"Would you like that Petunia? Do we have an agreement?"</p><p>A pause, a shift of fabric against the cloth couch, and then a cough.</p><p>"Its up to you Pet. You are the one who's got the most at stake. Magics tormented you most of your life."</p><p>"Then you may take the boy... but our memories stay. When the next witch or wizard begins trying to kill us, I want to comprehend the danger my family will face."</p><p>"A wise choice Petunia dear. Lily did always say your ideas are what inspired her more impressive charms. Speaking of which the watch is pointing in a peculiar direction."</p><p>The sound of footsteps became more and more distinct until a shadow passed by the door before quickly returning and pausing outside the cupboard. A disbelieving noise and then Harry watched as the door knob jiggled. Running back to his makeshift bed, Harry tried to straighten his hair, adjusted his glasses, and sat up as straight as he could before the door suddenly swung open.</p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>There in his doorway had stood Clarissa Iffirit, a stout but toned woman. Practically made of curves and muscle, Clarissa stood with confidence and a heavy gaze as she took in Harry's cupboard. Her almond shaped, dark brown eyes were surrounded by skin slightly darker than the rest of her, much like a raccoon, and they narrowed as they took in Harry's makeshift bed, school books, and his baby blanket thrown over his pile of clothes. Her dark brown hair spun in tightly coiled springs that flowed, from the tight braids on her head, to graze her shoulders. </p><p>Without a word Clarissa raised a hand to Harry, frowning a little when he flinched, and scooped his small frame into her arms. Harry curled into himself, and thus her shoulder, watched her warily before relaxing further into her shoulder. Walking him into the living room, Harry could finally see the meeting he'd been listening in on for himself. Vernon and Petunia were seated close together on the couch, Vernon protectively holding her waist while Dudley was caged in her lap. Her frail arms surprisingly had no problem restraining the burly boy, who was wiggling in an attempt to watch the dark skinned man who had seemed to be cooking on the Dursely's coffee table.</p><p>Raem Ifirit was a tall and thin dark skinned man. His narrowed, golden flecked, brown eyes were focused on the strange pot in front of him, although he looked up to glance at Harry for a moment. His onyx hair had one braid on the left side of his oval shaped face with the rest shoved into a high ponytail, leaving his scrunched up forehead to reveal his concentration. Raem waved a stick in lazy circles over the pot with one hand and waggled his other, covered in rings that lit up in a seemingly random order.</p><p>Clarissa calmly watched and waited until the rings stopped glowing and then tilted her head at her husband, who nodded while still waving the stick in lazy circles above the pot. With no hesitation at all, Claire pulled a small dagger out of seemingly nowhere and poked her index finger. A single bead of blood appeared and she allowed it to drop into the pot.  Turning toward Petunia, she plastered on a false smile.</p><p>"Petunia dear, I'll be needing 2 drops of blood from you. It will heal remarkedly fast once we drink our portions." With the look of absolute terror in her eyes, Petunia slowly crept to the strange pot somehow cooking on her living room coffee table. Petunia took one long look at Harry and offered her hand to Clarissa. With the same methodical poke, Petunia hovered her finger over the pot and let just 2 drops of blood fall into the liquid. Harry watched in awe as the brown liquid, spinning as if it were being stirred, turned deep red. </p><p>Suddenly Raem snapped the stick away and flicked his wrist; "Perfect! Claire 2/3 for you, 1/3 for her"; two vials appeared floating in mid air. With two hands and a dropper, Raem began to carefully fill the two vials, one halfway to the top and the other all the way to the top. Holding them out to Clarissa and Petunia with a pleased flourish, Raem smirked proudly at the two vials of red liquid. Harry watched with disgust as Clarissa took the full vial and swallowed the entire thing in 3 gulps; Petunia on the other hand sipped it and grimaced before drinking it all without stopping until it was gone.</p><p>Once both vials were empty, Clarissa twitched violently and her dark brown eyes flashed green before settling back to her natural color. Clarissa smiled at Petunia, who had immediately retreated to her husband and son, and whipped out a stick of her own.</p><p>"Now I'll be taking Harrison off your hands but before I do, here's a little thank you for taking such <em>good</em> care of my godson."</p><p>Harry jaw dropped in shock as Petunia paled and cowered on the floor, curled protectively over Dudley. Vernon jumped up with a shout, "Don't you go doing anything reckless! We had an agreement.."</p><p>His shouting was interrupted by Clarissa swishing her stick in the air like a grand magician and the 3 Dursleys being squashed into a pile of limbs and sliding like they were on a trolley. "This ought to make you think about your actions. I'll release you tomorrow. Farewell!" Chirped Clarissa pleasantly, as the Dursley slammed into Harry's cupboard with an audible click of the lock.</p><p>Shell-shocked, Harry barely noted when they left the Dursley house and headed to the Iffirits newly renovated home.</p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>Harry came back into his own body to the sound of soft giggles. Now seated in Clarissa's lap, in an unfamiliar but very cosy living room, Harry jolted forward and whipped around to look the strange woman in the face. She was smiling sadly at him in a way that most of his teachers had when they realized that he was the poor <em>Harrison</em>. Invisible, unwanted Harrison. And suddenly it was all too much.</p><p>The tears flew down Harrison's face. Suddenly the strong arms he vaguely recognized as Clarissa's lifted him up into her neck and another, bigger, hand pet his head and cupped his gaunt cheeks. Tiny hands pat him on the back as Clarissa whispered low encouragements in his ear.</p><p>"That's right Harry. My dear Harrison. Let it all out. Those awful muggles will never bother you again. You're home now. Its okay to cry, they were awful to you. We will be right here for you when you finish, so go on and let it all out."</p><p>Who knows how long it was before Harry finally stopped blubbering. He sat up slowly, eyes still watery, and tried his best to as the questions he needed answers to since the meeting in the Dursleys living room. He didn't manage much in the way of words but Raem managed to answer him anyway.</p><p>"I can only guess at the questions you may have my boy. Let us introduce ourselves first, and see if that doesn't put a dent in your list." Raem crooned while still petting Harry's messy head of hair. Clarissa smiled lovingly at her husband before turning that same smile towards the miserable boy in her lap.</p><p>”I’m Clarissa Iffirit née Zambini. Best friend of Lily Potter née Evans, your mother, and your Godmother. you can call me Miss Claire.”</p><p>Turning to the man next to them, Raem placed his giant hand back on Harry’s head and retangles his fingers in the boys hair.</p><p>”My name is Raem but you can call me Mister Ray. Claire is my beautiful wife and those two ingrates behind you are my children.“</p><p>Harry turned around and finally was face to face with a dark-skinned girl about Harry's age. She had short black unruly hair, that curled in every direction on top of her head, and racooned eyes that perfectly mirrored the golden-flecked brown eyes of her father stared at him with nothing but joy.</p><p>And behind her was a slightly older girl with sleek black hair carefully pulled into a ponytail that curled over her shoulder. Her narrow dark brown eyes were alight with confused compassion.</p><p>The smaller girl jumped forward and clasped his hands in her, a wide smile on her face. “Hullo Harrison. I’ve heard so much about you. Welcome home. I’ve always wanted a brother to play with. Can I call you Harry?”</p><p>Harrison felt light and overwhelmed simultaneously but before he could decide how to react the older girl shoved her energetic little sister away from him.</p><p>”Calm down Chlora! Hello Harrison, I’m Nina.”</p><p>”H-hello...”</p><p>“We’ve been traveling all around the country to find you for as long as I can remember.”</p><p>“O-oh?”</p><p>“You’re safe here and we’re glad to have you.” Nina’s smile, while not as wide as Chlora’s, was just as warm and blinding. “Right mother, father?”</p><p>”That’s right kitten, good job.” Raem smiled at his oldest. Clarissa shifted Harry onto the seat in between her and her husband before pulling out her wand.</p><p>”Harrison it’s time we started answering your questions but first you’ve got to be told your story. I’d bet my left tit Petunia didn’t tell you anything about your family and your legacy.”</p><p>”Claire!” “Mother!” Raem and Nina scolded at the same time, in a tone that spoke of the frequency in which they had to scold her.</p><p>Chlora nodding along in agreement with her mother, climbed up and over Harry to sit behind him. She grabbed his hand and smiled at him before nodding back towards her mother, who had gotten up and began to push around smoke that flowed freely from her wand.</p><p>”You, Harrison James Potter, are a wizard. You are the son of James Potter and Lily Evans, of course she took the name Potter before you were born of course.”</p><p>Two human figures appeared, entirely made of smoke, and they held hands and pulled out wands of their own.</p><p>”Two of the best combatants we had in the last war. A war that you are famous for ending might I mention.”</p><p>Another man appeared out of the smoke. His wand swung wildly through the air and the two figures meant to be his parents ducked, rolled, and dodged the smoke coming from him.</p><p>”A war lead against a powerful man and his loyal followers. His power was so great and his ambitions so dark most refuse to say his name even to this day. Voldemort called for the death of all muggleborns and the eradication of the policies that protect muggles from us wizards”</p><p>The lone man caught both of his parents and they vanished back into the smoke, revealing a baby carriage.</p><p>”He eventually bested the combatant duo in a surprise attack on their home. There your mother laid the foundations of the blood protection Raem seen on you, and what we can only assume was your magic strengthens it enough that you survived a horrible curse. A curse so strong that it kills everyone it touches.”</p><p>The awful man pointed his wand at the baby carriage and was struck by his own attack and vanished back into the smoke.</p><p>”You, Harrison, are known as the Boy Who Lived. A hero who killed the darkest wizard the wizard in world had seen in a century, and as an infant.”</p><p>Harry, full of shock and still processing this tale, pulled away from Chlora.</p><p>”No that’s not me. You’ve got the wrong orphan. There’s no way I killed a man as a baby.” Chlora snatched back his hand as Nina lifted his head and locked eyes with him as she spoke, calm and confident.</p><p>”You are Harrison James Potter. The scar on your forehead proves as much.”</p><p>Raem pet his head again and Clarissa waved her wand and a photograph appeared. A slash through the air and the photo drifted over to Harry.</p><p>In the black and white photograph was a man with unruly black hair and round glasses, holding a woman with long hair to his chest while she laughed and poked him. The man looked identical to Harry and suddenly there were more tears clouding his vision.</p><p>”Yes I know you are scared to learn such a heavy past and legacy belong to you, but denying your parents won’t do. That picture is for you.”</p><p>Clarissa put away her wand and watched as Chlora and Nina climbed all over Harry and hugged him tight while he cried his eyes out.</p><p>Raem got up and walked toward the kitchen, collecting his wife on the way, stopping at the door to speak to the children dog piled on his couch.</p><p>”Please trust us Harry. We have spent a long time searching for you and now there’s only a year before you head off to school. Let us educate you on the world that you’ve been hidden from. In exchange we’ll love you more than you’ve ever been loved and we’ll never lie to you.”</p><p>And with that Iffirits left to get dinner together, leaving Harry to be coddled by their daughters.</p>
