    <p>
  <span>Regulus did not anticipate his brother coming into his room in the middle of the night and shaking him awake, so he thought he could hardly be blamed for punching him. The Scamanders, after all, didn’t allow underage magic in the house, and Regulus was two months shy of seventeen.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ow! What the </span>
  <em>
    <span>fuck,</span>
  </em>
  <span> Reg?” Sirius hissed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How did you even get in here?” Regulus hissed, turning on the light and glancing at the clock.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I needed to tell you something!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sirius: how did you get </span>
  <em>
    <span>in here?”</span>
  </em>
  <span> Regulus repeated.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius shrugged, looking vaguely guilty. “Apparently the Scamanders never reset the alarms for when I Floo in.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Regulus dragged a hand down his face. He made a note to mention as much to Tina. Newt would probably just forget. “And what could you </span>
  <em>
    <span>possibly</span>
  </em>
  <span> want at this hour?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Uncle Alphard is dead.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Regulus didn’t respond at first. The thought occurred to him that this might be a dream, but then… why would he dream about his brother breaking into his room in the middle of the night? “How did you find out?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius reached into his pockets and shoved a letter at him. Regulus scanned the letter from Dorian Rosier, who had been there when their uncle died. Of course it had been from Dorian Rosier. It wasn’t a very long letter, but it made its point: Alphard Black was dead (cause unknown, and he was </span>
  <em>
    <span>young, </span>
  </em>
  <span>Regulus realised with a pang), and, given Alphard’s lack of children, his gold was to go to Sirius and Regulus, as well as several properties.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Regulus wondered what he’d left Dorian Rosier.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The Rosier family seal was on the letter. Regulus recognized it even if he had never read Dorian’s signature before, and he handed the letter back to Sirius. “Fuck.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That was my reaction, too,” Sirius said, sitting down on the edge of Regulus’s bed. “Mum’s gonna blast him off the family tree for that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Regulus snorted. “What good does it do now? He never had any kids.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I wonder how Rosier’s holding up,” Sirius said. “Bet his wife’s insufferable about it. Merlin, Reg, could you imagine having to have a </span>
  <em>
    <span>wife?</span>
  </em>
  <span> I’m so glad we both got out of there.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Regulus could very easily imagine having to have a wife. It had only been in the past year that that had changed… and he was incredibly glad for it. “I always liked Uncle Alphard,” Regulus said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Me, too, Reg.”</span>
</p>
<hr/><p>
  <span>He wasn’t surprised to find a letter from the family solicitor waiting for him on the kitchen table when he came down for breakfast in the morning. Tina was sitting nearby, sipping at a mug of coffee, and Regulus knew that she could recognise the letter for what it was. Max hadn’t come down yet, and Regulus guessed he’d probably sleep for a few more hours.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My uncle died,” Regulus said. “Alphard. The one I liked. Sirius came over last night in the middle of the night to tell me he’d gotten a letter from Uncle Alphard’s –” he stopped himself, unsure of </span>
  <em>
    <span>how</span>
  </em>
  <span> to describe Dorian Rosier’s relationship to his uncle. “Partner, I suppose? I dunno, he’d married a witch, this other wizard, but — we all knew they were still together.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sorry to hear that, Regulus,” Tina said. “I know your uncle was special to you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well,” Regulus said, “he </span>
  <em>
    <span>was</span>
  </em>
  <span> gay, and he was better than Mum and Dad by miles, but he was also still definitely — he told me more than once that he thought Grindelwald had had the right idea of things and just held — You-Know-Who as a cheap imitator. And his partner’s </span>
  <em>
    <span>definitely</span>
  </em>
  <span> a Death Eater. His son even told me that outright.” He </span>
  <em>
    <span>didn’t</span>
  </em>
  <span> say that he’d fooled around with Dorian Rosier’s son, because there was no need for Tina to know that — and, really, Max had probably told her already.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh,” Tina said. “That doesn’t mean that you’re not allowed to grieve for him.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sure I will once it hits me,” he said. “And you and Newt might want to reset the Floo, because Sirius did get in unhindered.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It must have slipped Newt’s mind,” Tina said. “I’ll see to it later today.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You don’t have to — say anything, if it’s too personal, but — your parents died when you were young, didn’t they?” He couldn’t remember for the life of him if Max had told him that, or if he’d read it in a book, but he was aware of the fact, regardless.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“They did,” Tina said. “I was — much younger than you are now, and it wasn’t — quite so sudden. They were ill. Dragon pox. Honestly — I thought that was the hardest thing I’d have to go through in my life, but… life had other plans.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t think I’ve ever — known someone who died before.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s one of the most difficult things to have to cope with,” Tina said. “Even now, sometimes I see something, or hear something, and the first person I want to tell is my sister.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s only going to get worse, isn’t it?” Regulus asked. “With the war?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Probably,” Tina agreed. “The Ministry is doing all it can, and so is Dumbledore, but…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But things are getting worse, not better,” Regulus said. “Sirius and Potter will try their hand to become Aurors, I imagine. Lily and Isaac have both already told me they want to become Healers. Although, to be fair, I think Isaac’d have decided that </span>
  <em>
    <span>without</span>
  </em>
  <span> the war.” He reached for the letter. “Might as well open this.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He broke the seal with a satisfying crack and skimmed the letter. His uncle had had an official will, and his parents were, naturally, contesting it. Lovely. He and Sirius were to meet with the family solicitor to determine a solution, and receive their bequeathments. He wondered, vaguely, if Alphard had ever finished the latest Warbeck novel. He’d written Regulus in April, two months earlier — but had he decided to make that change then, or before?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He’d have to tell Max now.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m to go to the family solicitor’s office in London this afternoon.”</span>
</p>
<hr/><p>
  <span>Sirius insisted on going side-along. If Regulus didn’t know better, he’d say that his brother was just showing off, but he knew how much Uncle Alphard had mattered to Sirius. He knew that their parents had always been worse to Sirius than to him. He knew that Sirius also couldn’t stand to be alone. So he agreed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He’d dressed in an appropriate set of dress robes that were a little old, but mercifully still fit. Sirius hadn’t even bothered to put on </span>
  <em>
    <span>robes;</span>
  </em>
  <span> he wore Muggle jeans and a violently purple skin-tight button-down. It actually wouldn’t be a terrible outfit in Muggle society, at least by Regulus’s approximation, but it would infuriate their parents. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They made it to the solicitor’s office before their parents. Sirius pressed a vial of the draught of peace into Regulus’s palm. “Here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Regulus drank it without a second thought. His anxiety was already going wild, and he knew Sirius wouldn’t try anything funny in a situation like the one they were in. Sirius vanished the empty vial before Regulus could stick it back in his pocket.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Their parents arrived and didn’t seem to pay any mind to them. A few minutes later, the family solicitor, whom Regulus knew only by the surname Nott (Regulus wasn’t sure he’d ever known the woman’s first name) brought them into her office.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sorry for your loss,” she said. “Alphard was a remarkable man, and it was so sudden.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do they know what’s caused it?” Sirius asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nott shook her head. “I understand there is an investigation, but no one suspects foul play.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Regulus might suspect his parents if he thought they cared enough about Alphard to kill him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“In the meantime, Alphard’s will was very straightforward: all of his properties and his vault at Gringotts are to be distributed equally between Sirius and Regulus.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not the family vault,” Walburga said. “They are </span>
  <em>
    <span>blood traitors,</span>
  </em>
  <span> and have </span>
  <em>
    <span>no</span>
  </em>
  <span> right to the family vault.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You </span>
  <em>
    <span>have</span>
  </em>
  <span> submitted the proper paperwork, Walburga — neither Sirius nor Regulus have any claim to anything in the family vault unless you and Orion pass without a proper heir. This pertains only to Alphard’s personal vault.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And what’s he left Dorian Rosier?” Walburga asked. “More than he’s left his own sister, that’s for sure.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Rosier might be a Death Eater,” Sirius said, “but something tells me he </span>
  <em>
    <span>still</span>
  </em>
  <span> wasn’t quite as nasty as </span>
  <em>
    <span>you.”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“I will not tolerate speculation about upstanding members of pureblood society in this office,” Nott said. “Nor will I get involved in personal disputes with no legal basis. Walburga, Orion, you have no right to contest the will — it’s all very by the book.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Regulus is underage,” Orion said. “He can’t inherit anything.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Under normal circumstances, that would be true,” Nott said. “However, you and your wife did both file the appropriate paperwork to make </span>
  <em>
    <span>both</span>
  </em>
  <span> of them — and Regulus, still — an emancipated minor — which means that he </span>
  <em>
    <span>can</span>
  </em>
  <span> inherit and own property.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Regulus hadn’t known that. Why hadn’t he known that? Why had he thought that his parents had still technically had some claim on him? He should have asked Newt and Tina — surely they knew, at this point. Newt’s brother had been head of the DMLE before Crouch’s father’s predecessor had replaced him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Walburga, I do have to say that Alphard has not left any indication of his claim to his portion of the family vault, so legally, that does fall to you — and to Cygnus, of course — as his closest surviving relatives. But everything else — save a few particular items — belongs to Sirius and Regulus. There is a specific list of items which Alphard wanted passed on to other people, and I will see to it that it is taken care of, but — you and Orion are free to leave.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was clear to Regulus that this wasn’t a request. His parents left the room in a huff, and he was certain that they’d look into finding another solicitor, but he didn’t care.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So,” Nott said once their parents had gone. “There is the matter of the division of assets.” She handed them each a piece of parchment with a list of assets. “This is everything that Alphard’s left to the two of you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Regulus skimmed the list — this was more than Dorian Rosier had said in his letter. “He had a townhouse in Chelsea?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And a flat in Diagon Alley?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Both are yours. We can split ownership, or divide it evenly.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Regulus exchanged a look with his brother. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I think we can share ownership,” Sirius said. “Determine between us who’s going to live where or do what with what.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Though I think the gold should be evenly distributed between us.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oi, don’t trust me with Alphard’s fortune?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Regulus raised an eyebrow. “Is that an actual question?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Sirius said. “I wouldn’t, either. I’ve been eyeing a motorbike.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course you have,” Regulus said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We can divide his gold between the two of you — have you both got vaults at Gringotts?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah,” Regulus said. “Personal safes.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Any other valuables, then, will stay in Alphard’s vault to divide amongst yourselves?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah,” Sirius said. “That works.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nott made some notes. “Good, good. And there is one small matter — for Regulus.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“For me?” Regulus asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If you’d like, Sirius can stay in the room, but this doesn’t concern him.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He was glad for the draught of peace, because he knew without it, right now, he’d feel extremely anxious. “Sirius can stay,” Regulus said. “I trust him.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Very well,” Nott said. She shuffled some papers around. “As you may or may not be aware, your uncle published a series of novels under a pseudonym. He stated in his will that he would like all future decisions regarding these novels to come from you — and that you would determine whether or not to reveal his identity.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Oh, that was — a lot. “Oh,” Regulus said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He had just submitted a manuscript to his publisher a few weeks ago.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know anything about publishing,” Regulus said. “Has he got an agent?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nott nodded. “I can put you in touch with her.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you,” Regulus said.</span>
