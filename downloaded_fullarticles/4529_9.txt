    <p>When His Lordship Captain Sirius Black, and his father, His Lordship Colonel Orion Black, returned home from what was being called “the war to end all wars,” neither felt inclined to talk. Never close to begin with, the war seemed to distance even more this father and son. Perhaps it was their actions in the trenches that distanced them. While Orion was stoic, hard, unreadable, Sirius was loud, joking, and merry. This was much to Orion’s dismay. He would give Sirius a blow to the head with the heel of his hand when his frivolity went too far, but this blow was never so hard as to make Sirius unable to fight. Orion knew Sirius was a good soldier, as did everyone. Precise shots, fast legs, and simple resilience were all trademarks of Sirius Black. Resilience, being perhaps, the most important. <br/>	Sirius’ twentieth birthday, November third, was just days before he left for France. He was young, still a boy in many ways. Arriving in the trenches was unsettling to say the least, but he adjusted quickly. Mocked by some for his high class mannerisms and speech, revered by others for the same reasons, Sirius had to grasp his role as captain quickly and with great strength. And yet, he was still a boy. He had dreamt before he left of being with the other men in the mud and filth, telling stories of their lives back home, looking at the stars from below the ground. When he arrived that was what jarred him the most- the silence. The men barely talked unless required. And this quietness was most often not out of hostility, but exhaustion. Watches were limited to two hours so men would not fall asleep, and yet some still did. They savored every moment of rest like it was gold.<br/>	There were two men however, who were willing to talk- a Captain James Potter, also a Lord’s Son, and a Lieutenant Peter Pettigrew, the son of a banker. The three became quite close. They would huddle under the stars and talk about what they had left behind. They would tease James about his sweetheart Lily, mock the quieter, less handsome Sergeant Severus Snape, and talk of their plans for when the war was over. Peter intended to take on his father’s business. James planned to propose to Lily, and live with her and his parents- His Lordship Colonel Fleamont Potter and Her Ladyship Euphemia Potter, at their home. Sirius however didn't have many plans for when the war reached its conclusion. He thought of traveling to America. He thought of traveling to Rome. He thought of taking up a trade. He thought of riding horses through the forests and fields surrounds his home of Grimmauld Place. He thought of everything but what he knew was inevitable- marriage. <br/>	Sirius Black, being the son of a Lord, was seen as the ideal bachelor by nearly all ladies surrounding London. But beyond this, his confidence and stunning good looks made him perfect in the eyes of these ladies’ daughters as well. Sirius was sought after up until the moment he left for the trenches, and he knew, he would return to the same when he got back. His parents had been pushing him upon his cousin, Bellatrix, for some time, but her own pushback had been the end of that, not his.<br/>	Sirius, to be completely honest, did not care. All the women seemed the same to him- rich, pretty, and poised. Everything a women should be to his parents. They could not understand why he wasn't falling for one after the other. Sirius didn’t understand himself, really. As said before, he knew they were all very pretty, and some were even quite nice. But none of them struck him the way he thought they should. None of them made his heart beat faster or his face flush. None of them were memorable and made him stay up at night imagining a future together. Sirius Black was simple completely indifferent to all of them. He often wondered if one would ever come along that would strike his fancy. He often wondered if maybe all those feelings and all that excitement was just a fairytale.</p>
<p>******</p>
<p>	Remus Lupin, son of former lawyer Lyall Lupin and seamstress Hope Lupin, did not fight in the Great War. Not because he was a coward, far from it. He did not go simply because of bad luck. Remus had always been small, or rather, just skinny. He was quite tall in height. At age fourteen, his growing increased quite quickly until he stood at about 195 centimeters by age sixteen. As said before, Remus was thin and willowy, but also pale, and of a sickly constitution. His face was also marred by thin scars resulting from a carriage collision when he was just five years old. But he was handsome in his own way. He was intelligent, learning to read early, and never stopping since. He could do maths quickly in his head, and also had an odd talent for maps, both in reading and drawing them. But these skills did not help when he tried to enlist. The officer turned him away after inspecting him, citing arrhythmia, a small flutter in Remus’ heart that left him breathless and faint at times, and “weak lungs” (whatever that meant). Remus was disappointed, but not altogether surprised. So, while the boys he had gone to the country school with grew into men and left to fight, Remus remained and attempted to help his family’s position as much as he good. He learned to sew from his mother, and became quite skilled at it, assisting her in her seamstress work. He also manned a small bookshop- Ariana’s Books, on weekends and Mondays, allowing the owner, a Mister Albus Dumbledore, to visit old colleagues and friends during that time. <br/>	Remus kept himself busy. He did not think much of the future. He only hoped that whatever came to him was kind, and would help him support his parents. He imagined marrying at some points, but did not think it likely to meet a girl so inclined to his quiet disputation. <br/>	All in all, Remus was happy with his father and mother, his books, and his maps.</p>
<p>******</p>
<p>	Sirius, Orion, Walburga, and Sirius’ younger brother, Regulus, ate dinner together every night, except when Orion was out on business (as he was more often than not truthfully). One night, nearly a year after Sirius and Orion’s return to Grimmauld Place from the war, the four of them entertained the other half of Black family- Walburga’s brother, Cygnus, his wife, Druella, and their three children, Bellatrix (the same as aforementioned), Narcissa, and Andromeda. Sirius was no longer being pushed upon Bellatrix, but now it seemed, his parents were set on his marrying Narcissa, who was considered a trifle more mature and poised than Andromeda.</p>
<p>	“Sirius, dear,” said Walburga, as they sat down to eat. “Perhaps you should show Narcissa around the new gardens after dinner. They are just lovely under the stars.”</p>
<p>	“Yes, Cissy,” giggled Bellatrix. “Go bathe in the moonlight with Sirius. Then you can-”</p>
<p>	“Thats a wonderful idea, Walburga!” interrupted Cygnus. “Isn't it Narcissa?”</p>
<p>	Narcissa looked from her father, to Sirius, to Bellatrix, and back to her father again.</p>
<p>	“Yes,” she said indifferently. </p>
<p>	There was silence for moment until Sirius decided to speak.</p>
<p>	“Why yes mother, it is a lovely idea. Regulus, why don't you join us?”</p>
<p>	Walburga scowled at Sirius as he offered this suggestion. Regulus, however, was oblivious, and wanting only to please his older brother exclaimed, “Of course Sirius! I’d love to.” <br/>	Walburga and her husband shared a look. Sirius smiled to himself as he took a sip of wine.<br/>	After dinner Sirius, Regulus, and Narcissa put on their coats and gloves, and walked out the French doors to the gardens. <br/>	Walburga had just had a several rows of white rose bushes planted, stating that they would add some color to the otherwise all green gardens. This made as much sense to Sirius as most of the things his parents said, so he just accepted it.</p>
<p>	“Well, what do you think?” he asked Narcissa after several minutes of silence.</p>
<p>	Regulus had gone ahead of them, and was trying to spot his constellation and star despite the light from the house.</p>
<p>	“Its lovely,” said Narcissa monotonously. </p>
<p>	Sirius looked up, past her, to the sky.</p>
<p>	“There I am,” he said, head tilted towards his own star.</p>
<p>	Narcissa looked up as well.</p>
<p>	“There you are.”</p>
<p>	More silence followed. They turned a corner, and were welcomed by more rose bushes. Suddenly Narcissa spoke. </p>
<p>	“Think of this- your youngest daughter is born beautiful, privileged and wealthy and you name her Narcissa, after Narcissus, the Greek hunter from the myths who was born vain and selfish. Isn't that setting her up?”</p>
<p>	Sirius was startled by this sudden outburst.</p>
<p>	“Setting her up for what?” he asked slowly.</p>
<p>	“It means that every man I meet expects me to be vain and selfish.”</p>
<p>	She waited for a reply. None came.</p>
<p>	“Of which I am neither,” she continued. “I am confident. I am persistent. That is all.”</p>
<p>	“Narcissa, I assure you that I have the upmost respect for you.”</p>
<p>	“Really? Would I expect the upmost respect from a dog?”</p>
<p>	“Thats funny.”</p>
<p>	“No, its clever.”</p>
<p>	“Well, then. Not vain at all.”</p>
<p>	“Oh, shut up.”</p>
<p>	Silence again, followed.</p>
<p>	“Narcissa?” asked Sirius.</p>
<p>	“What?” she replied. </p>
<p>	“I am just as unhappy with the prospect of a match as you are.”</p>
<p>	Narcissa looked angry, offended, then suddenly intrigued. Sirius continued.</p>
<p>	“I only ask that you answer me one question.”</p>
<p>	“What would that be?” asked Narcissa. </p>
<p>	“Why?”</p>
<p>	“What?” said Narcissa, surprised.</p>
<p>	“Why not me? I’m perfect.”</p>
<p>	“You are far from-”</p>
<p>	“I am wealthy, handsome-”</p>
<p>	“Not vain at all.”</p>
<p>	“-polite, kind hearted. Why not?”</p>
<p>	Narcissa looked up.</p>
<p>	“There is another. His name is Lucius.”</p>
<p>	“Lucius Malfoy?”</p>
<p>	“Yes. How did you know?”</p>
<p>	“Are there any other high class men named Lucius?”</p>
<p>	Narcissa signed.</p>
<p>	“Well, no,” she said. She paused, and finally said, “We plan to marry.”</p>
<p>	Sirius raised his eyebrows.</p>
<p>	“Congratulations… Do your parents know?”</p>
<p>	“Of course not,” said Narcissa sharply.</p>
<p>	“Why not tell them?”</p>
<p>	“They want me to marry you.”</p>
<p>	“Well, I can’t blame them for that.”</p>
<p>	Narcissa signed again.</p>
<p>	“If Lucius and I ever have a child, we will not give them a cursed name. We’ll name them something strong.”</p>
<p>	Sirius stared at her. He could not imagine already thinking of children. At that moment, Regulus jogged over to them from around a corner.</p>
<p>	“Would you both like to go back in? Its rather cold.” he said.</p>
<p>	“Yes,” said Narcissa, turning to Sirius. “But its been lovely.”</p>
<p>******</p>
<p>	“I’m here Mister Dumbledore!” called Remus Lupin, stepping out of the rain and into Ariana’s Books.<br/>	“Come in! Come in!” cried Mister Dumbledore appearing from behind some shelves labeled, “Witchcraft and Wizardry.” Remus smiled. Mister Dumbledore believed in all that, spiritualism and such. Remus did not, but found it endearing all the same. </p>
<p>	“Why my boy, you're soaked through!”</p>
<p>	“Its all right, Mister Dumbledore. I-”</p>
<p>	“No! Come into the back. I have a fire there already.”</p>
<p>	Remus followed Mister Dumbledore into his office at the back of the shop. There, as he had said, was a fire in the fire place, and a kettle above it full of boiling water, presumably for tea. Remus sat down in his usual spot, in an old armchair across from Mister Dumbledore’s desk, which was piled high with papers, pencils, books, quills, and ink pots.<br/>	Mister Dumbledore picked up a rag, and using it to shield his hand from the heat, picked up the kettle. He poured two cups of tea and handed one to Remus.</p>
<p>	“Here, drink this my boy.”</p>
<p>	“Thank you, sir.”</p>
<p>	Mister Dumbledore sat across from Remus in his own battered armchair at the desk. </p>
<p>	“Now, how is your father getting on? I saw him in town the other day.”</p>
<p>	“He does well enough. Still takes on some tasks from that firm in Bromley.”</p>
<p>	“Good. Good to hear.”</p>
<p>	Mister Dumbledore knew Lyall Lupin from when he had been a pupil at the school where Mister Dumbledore was headmaster- Hogwarts School. It was a prestigious academy that helped Lyall to his station as a well-known lawyer in London. But a debacle with another lawyer named Fenrir Greyback caused Lyall to have to move to the country with Hope and Remus, and stay there quietly, doing work inconspicuously for other firms.</p>
<p>	“And your mother?” Mister Dumbledore asked Remus.</p>
<p>	“Still working. She been very successful, lately. She's been assigned to alter a lady’s bridal gown before the wedding. Its soon, too. Near Christmas.”</p>
<p>	“Good. Very good. And you, Remus? How are you doing?”</p>
<p>	“I’m fine.”</p>
<p>	Mister Dumbledore regarded him carefully. Remus shifted, slightly uncomfortable under his gaze. </p>
<p>	“Well,” Mister Dumbledore finally said. “I’m off.” </p>
<p>	He stood up and put on his coat. Picking up his hat and umbrella, he finally said, “Well, take care of yourself, Remus, my boy. Stay out of trouble.”</p>
<p>	Remus smiled. </p>
<p>	“Of course,” he said. </p>
<p>	Mister Dumbledore then stepped out of the back door of the shop, and walked away.</p>
