    <p>Their first meeting is inconsequential in the grand scheme of things, to be frank – at least to him it is. It's Harry's job to please his clients and give them the attention that he's been paid for. Sure his newest client is classically handsome and has a presence that demands everyone to pay attention but before now, they have never mingled at all. Tom Riddle, mob boss and owner of the prestigious underground club and casino, The Chamber of Secrets, is a man that everyone knew not to trifle with. The man owns many clubs and with them came territory, money, drugs, favors and like Harry, prostitutes.  </p><p>In the three years Harry’s worked at The Chamber of Secrets, he’s seen the man many times but only quick glimpses before he’s called away, usually by a client. So he is quite surprised when Riddle pays for his services that evening.</p><p>Lucius Malfoy – Riddle’s right hand man and club manager - had given him the coldest and deadliest stare anyone could give and told him that Riddle was waiting for him.</p><p>Harry knew that no one said <em>'No'</em> to Riddle, unless they had a death wish. To be called as Riddle's bed partner for the evening was a great honor with bragging rights among the prostitutes here at the club.</p><p>So with confidence that Harry rarely has, he saunters into the private VIP room where Riddle and his associates are conversing. Talks immediately cease once he enters but resume as he sits next to Riddle. He smiles charmingly and waits patiently for Riddle to finish with his business. Seeing the new wine bottle brought in by one of the waiters, Harry takes the initiative to pour a glass for his client and the rest of Riddle’s associates.</p><p>It wasn’t part of his job, but it never hurts to show everyone here that he has manners and is not just a fuck toy. And if it gets new people interested in him to be possible new clients, then all the better for Harry.</p><p>An arm snakes its way around his waist, long thin fingers lightly rubbing against his exposed abdomen from his crop top. Harry pays it no mind. It was quite common for his clients to get handsy at some point, especially if they hadn’t started having sex yet.</p><p>For a few hours, all Harry did was smile and pour wine and speak when spoken too.</p><p>Occasionally, Harry tunes out the conversation happening around him, mostly because it was about who owed money and had yet to pay, territory disputes and expansion and business talk. Sure some would be interested to learn everything they could, but Harry is just trying to stay out of trouble. Plus, it wasn't a topic he would've been interested anyway.</p><p>Then Riddle dismisses his associates and locks the door.</p><p>“It's just us now.” The older man says.</p><p>Harry smiles coyly. “What would you like me to do first, sir?”</p><p>Better to get it over with now.</p><p>He’s heard from some other prostitutes; who hadn’t been able to please Riddle like he wanted; tell how vicious the man could be if something wasn’t right and had been thrown out of his presence and nearly been forbidden to work in the club. Although, a few did have that fate bestowed on them, Harry did not want to be one of them.</p><p>Riddle smirks, sitting upon the couch and opening his legs. “I want to see that pretty mouth at work.”</p><p>“Of course, sir.”</p><p>Getting down on his knees, Harry demurely gazes upon Riddle’s face to find his blue eyes watching him. Never breaking eye contact, Harry nuzzles the clothed bulge that grows every second, before using his teeth to unzip and hands to unbutton the older man’s pants.</p><p>Harry can tell that Riddle is the sort of man who loves and craves power, no doubt in his sexual endeavors as well.</p><p>Like a lot of the clientele exclusively invited here to The Chamber of Secrets.</p><p>Harry knows these types, knows what gets them off and what makes them tick. Most want their bed partners weak and submissive, some may even love a bit a rebellion every now and then, so when their partner finally submits, they can savor the victory all the more. Riddle is no different from his other clients. He'll just have to make sure he doesn’t disappoint.</p><p>He doesn't keep Riddle waiting too long otherwise it'll affect his reputation in the club. For a few minutes, soft lips kiss along Riddle’s erection, with licks in between, before Harry takes Riddle’s cock into his mouth, breathing through his nose and relaxing his throat until he can no longer take anymore.</p><p>Riddle sits back against the couch, a picture of having no care in the world, though the tenseness of his shoulders give him away to Harry.</p><p>“Go on.” Riddle purrs, placing a hand into Harry's hair.</p><p>Harry moves his head up and down upon his client's cock, using every technique he’s learned to see what Riddle responds too. The room is mostly silent except for the heavy breathing and slurping from Harry and the near silent groans from Riddle.</p><p>The man's grip tightens upon his hair but Harry ignores it, keeping focus on his task. This continues until Riddle grabs Harry's head with both hands and erratically shoves himself as deep as he can go in Harry's mouth. The thrusts are harsh and fast, abusing Harry's mouth until Riddle comes, keeping his cock deep inside until Harry has swallowed every last drop, though some of it manages to leak out.</p><p>Then Harry is abruptly pulled off Riddle’s softening cock.</p><p>“You were quite good. I think this calls for a reward.” Riddle says. “Don't you think so?”</p><p>Harry wraps his arms around Riddle's neck and straddles his legs. “Anything you wish, sir.”</p><p>Riddle smirks as wandering hands cup his ass and squeeze. Harry smiles.</p><p>“Such a good whore you are. I do believe we're going to have a wonderful night together.”</p><p>Honestly, this isn’t the first time Harry's heard similar words spoken to him. Most of his clients – who are usually old married men – think they are some kind of sex god, when in reality they weren't overly great. Of course, there were others who had exceeded his expectations, but still, this night will be just like all his others, Harry’s sure.</p><p>No different from any other night.</p><p>“Strip for me.” Riddle orders.</p><p>Harry smiles flirtatiously and sensually slides off Riddle's lap, standing a few feet away, and makes eye contact with Riddle.</p><p>An invisible song that only Harry can hear plays in his head. Soon, the night will be over, then he can finish this as soon as possible. It's just another client, Harry repeats to himself in a mantra.</p><p>He can see Riddle’s eyes follow his hands as they slowly lift up his crop top. He lets the shirt fall to the floor and moves his hands over his bare chest to play with his nipples before they head down to his tight black pants. Easily slipping out of his shoes, Harry unbuttons and unzips his pants. He grabs the waist of his pants and boxers and slowly pushes them down until he is standing naked in front of his client.</p><p>Riddle’s cock - that had been left out of its confines - has hardened throughout the show until it was almost fully erect. Harry's cock is half hard and seems to grow every minute Riddle's eyes roam all over his body.</p><p>Riddle uses his right hand to make a 'come hither’ motion and Harry obeys.</p><p>Harry once again straddles Riddle’s lap and leans in for a kiss. Their lips meet in a slow sensual kiss, tongues massaging each other's. Riddle's tongue maps out Harry's mouth and Harry eagerly sucks on it as well. In no time at all, the kiss turns more heated before they break it for air, a string of saliva connecting to their lips.</p><p>Harry is secretly surprised that Riddle even allowed him to kiss him. From what he’s heard, the man has a firm ‘No kiss or Mark’s’ policy with the prostitutes. He was sure he would've been punished for assuming. It looked like Riddle was in the mood for indulgences.</p><p>He mentally shrugs. It’s really not important for further analyses.</p><p>Long thin fingers start exploring his body as Riddle kisses along his jawline and neck, leaving hickeys along the way. Harry moans loudly when Riddle finds a very sensitive spot just under the left side of his jaw. Harry can practically feel the man's smirk on his neck.</p><p>He feels the man's hands lightly roam his body, despite the feather like touch, Riddle’s hands leave a burning trail all over.</p><p>Harry is not idle as well, he unbuttons Riddle’s shirt, laying his own kisses upon the man's neck. Harry starts to suck on the man's neck when his hair is roughly pulled so he can see Riddle’s face.</p><p>“So eager. However, no marks on me. That's the rule.” Riddle tsks.</p><p>Harry nods in understanding. He forgot but he won’t make that mistake again. It's not worth making Riddle angry.</p><p>Riddle’s the boss and never has a lover, just flings or paid services. Harry has no right to act like a lover, he's just getting paid to get Riddle off. That's all.</p><p>Harry lets the man take most of the control, just as he wants, but Harry is not completely submissive either.</p><p>From Riddle’s chuckle and smirk, the man doesn’t mind it and relishes it.</p><p>They continue to kiss as Riddle brings out a bottle of lube and a condom from a nearby stand that is always stocked for these kinds of activities.</p><p>Riddle lathers his fingers generously and sticks one inside Harry, moving around roughly for a couple of minutes with another entering soon after. Harry moans in some pain as he’s being stretched, the burning sensation more prominent until Harry shouts in pain mixed with ecstasy as Riddle has found his prostate.</p><p>The bundle of nerves is pressed roughly and consistently, making Harry a moaning mess.</p><p>He barely notices Riddle’s chuckle, the man’s fingers leaving him feeling empty.</p><p>Harry whimpers, though before he knows it Riddle expertly puts on the condom and brings Harry down roughly upon his shaft.  The pain is a little unbearable but Harry’s glad for the small reprieve to get used to Riddle’s cock.</p><p>Harry takes a few deep breaths until he feels that the pain won’t be too much.</p><p>He shifts his hips a bit and Riddle takes that as his cue to move. He's a little surprised Riddle had let him get used to his cock. But, the though quickly disappears as Riddle moves.</p><p>The pain recedes and all that is left is the pleasure.</p><p>They move wildly, fast and hard. Just two people getting pleasure from each other. </p><p>That’s all it is.</p><p>Then he’ll move on to the next client.   </p><p>They move in sync, each reaching the height of pleasure until it explodes, hot and scorching, yet relieving at the same time. Both still locked intimately like two lovers, until Harry removes himself from Riddle's lap. </p><p>After cleaning himself with some tissue, Harry quickly yet carefully puts his clothes back on. Riddle watches him, but Harry pays it no mind until he's finished dressing.</p><p>Smiling, "Thank you for your patronage. I hope you will call on me again soon."</p><p>Riddle just smirks and Harry takes that as his cue to leave.</p><p>The burning of Riddle's gaze follows him even after he is long gone from the room.</p>
