    <p>The heels of her palms dug into her eyes, attempting to burrow energy into her skull. </p><p>Bleary-eyed, she dredged through the halls. Dreaming of the end of the Triwizard Tournament. It had only been two weeks since the hallowed halls of Hogwarts received their foreign invaders.</p><p>She had always been an inquisitive child. A trait that had been nourished by her grandmother and condemned by her peers - muggle and magical alike. She snorted. Finding a rare commonality between the magical and muggle communities. Yes, she was positively itching to interrogate the foreign delegates on their magical knowledge. She'd suspected that like Hogwarts, their schools had secrets that could not be found in ordinary books.</p><p>How did they access their kitchens? Did they tickle a banana, instead? Did portraits guard their doors, too? Maybe, they even had their own monsters lurking in their drains. Her excitement had dampened by the looks of revolt, she'd received from the blood purist Durmstrang brutes. Their roman noses, sensing the impurity laying in her blood. The cold petite shoulders of the stunning Beauxbatons creatures had not encouraged her either.</p><p>In absence of her excitement, her idle hands began to fill. Harry decided it was necessary to continue his annual tradition of falling into life-threatening scenarios. Tugging Hermione along with him. She spent most of her days' lodging in the narrow library aisles, not unusual.  It was less thrilling when you were grasping at ways to keep the Boy Who Lived - living. Her nights were split apart, between her friends. Trying to juggle her time between both Harry and Ron was exhausting.</p><p>Hogwarts had never felt so small, something that had once felt impossible to the humble witch. Every corner she turned unleashed a new horror in her mind. She would spy a gaggle of giggling Beauxbaton girls. Silk periwinkle dresses swishing around them, and suddenly she’d remember why they were here. Her Harry was going to be challenging a dragon. <em>A bloody dragon</em>. </p><p>If there was one witch who deserved a break it was Hermione Granger. Judging by the burly Durmstrang boys flooding the halls, she would have no such luck. Heaving a sigh, she headed in the direction of the hooting and hollering. Heading towards the area the frilly skirted boys were escaping from, with purple faces. Hearing the unmistakable cackle of the regular torn in her side, she was tempted to turn a blind eye, to accept the cross-dressing students as a mere cultural difference. Alas, she had an obligation to her school. That obligation required her to prevent a possible international incident.</p><p>It was not fear of confrontation that had caused the hesitation. No, she’d stared in the face of a convicted mass murderer at fourteen years old. Well, they’d thought he was guilty at the time. His proven innocence afterwards didn’t negate her bravery. No, she was too physically drained to deal with the Weasley Twins - especially Fred. Arguably the most infuriating git to grace these halls, in centuries. After Voldemort, of course. <em>Nasty fellow.</em></p><p>She'd spent the first two years of Hogwarts completely indifferent to twins. She had interacted with them occasionally. Standing in the background as they affectionately teased their brother and her best friend, Ron. Hermione never thought much of them, or their pranks. She’d even giggled once or twice, at their wildly inappropriate flirtations with their head of house. Even now with her near hatred of the boy, she still smiles remembering the boys interrupting her second hear transfiguration class. She could've sworn she'd seen the stern witches lip twitch, as they’d delivered their Honeyduke’s chocolates. Inviting her to be their (yes, shared) Valentine. </p><p>She had seen little issue with their jokes as nobody had ever been harmed, really. Something her bleeding heart could never abide by. More importantly, she'd never been a target of their mischief, therefore she had no reason to interfere. Well, until later, that is.</p><p>       </p><hr/><p> </p><p>It began in the beginnings of her third year, as she nestled in a bed of cushions in a near-empty common room. She was relaxing with some light-reading. A third edition of ‘<em>Morag’s Mystifying Mental Maladies </em>'. Most of her house had taken to the stands in support of their team. Thus, she’d been treated with a vacant common room, an interesting tome and a resounding quiet. The perfect ingredients for a day of relaxation.</p><p>She'd always be there for the house games. She held little desire to watch the mundane strategy planning by Oliver and company. She could barely endure the long-lasting matches. Unfortunately, practice did not end when the snitch was caught. She was glad Harry was a brilliant seeker, it ended the games faster. She always cheered for Harry, of course.</p><p>Normally, she'd be so caught in her reading that she could rarely be pulled away. A suffering whimper sounded, breaking the dead silence and wrenching her heart towards it. Hunched in a chair was a mousy first year she recognized as Melly Morgan. Her crestfallen sigh had her kneeling in front of the girl. Her chin tipped over the edge of an over-sized bucket.</p><p>She had made a point of getting to know all muggleborn students within her house, new and old. She didn't have a saviour complex or anything. There was no harm in watching out for the more vulnerable students. Precisely how she'd come to know the little blue-eyed witch with wetted cheeks. The tiny girl with an almost mouse-like nose, sobbing. Her wild unkempt hair sticking to her forehead and flaying outwards in all directions, felt all too familiar to her.</p><p>The blonde frizzy-haired girl opened her glistening eyes as she sobbed her tale. To this day, Hermione had never felt such rage for another student. In the privacy of her own mind, she would say her actions that followed, though justified, were over the top. The young muggleborn had fallen victim to the Weasley twins, and their experimental vomit-inducing candies. She'd feared the effects of the humiliation on her ability to make friends, after spewing in front of her entire house. As she looked into her eyes, she was transported back to her first year. Crying in a bathroom alone with an angry troll leering at her.</p><p>Few understand how it felt to go through primary school, tormented for a freakish nature and isolated for it. Then one day, everything changes. A cat transforms before her feline-eyes, delivering promises of a fresh start with people just like her. She was more astounded that there were people like her, than she was learning she was a witch. To be fair, you can't blow up Ollie Parker's winning science project with sheer jealousy, and not question your existence. As if ant-farms were <em>revolutionary</em>, she scoffed. So, when she was told of a magical school, with Europe's largest library, she was ecstatic. She'd quickly learn something that would stay with her for the rest of her life. Fresh starts, were not always refreshing.</p><p>Yes, it was all frighteningly familiar for her.</p><p>Hermione did not have a saviour complex. She'd be damned if she'd sit back and let another witch be bullied by another cocky red-headed boy. She quickly ran to herassorted potions she'd kept in her dorm, giving the witch a small vial to settle her stomach. Melly tipped the vial into her mouth without question. Once the hiccupping ended, she grabbed the small girl by her wrist and dragged her through the Portrait door. Rushing down the gliding staircases to the packed Quidditch Pitch, despite Melly’s vehement protests. The Fat Lady was calling after her, the abrupt exit unsettling her nap.</p><p>"Wh-what are you doing?" the small girl cowed behind her. If Hermione was in her right mind, she'd have knelt like her grandmother would, with soothing sounds and comforting pats. She wasn’t in her right mind. Today, she was in a blind fury.</p><p>"Do you want to be remembered as the witch who spewed in front of her entire house?" She snapped, pulling the girl harshly by the arm from behind her. The girl stood on shaky legs and faced forward. She might have given her a proud smile too, if she weren't busy scouting for a patch of brazen red hair.</p><p>Hermione had these inexplicable bouts of magic on occasion. They were more complex than accidental magic and far harder to explain. Her hair, which had mellowed to tumbling waves over the summer, began swirling ominously around her on the still October day. She could rarely command a broom towards her hand from three inches away. Yet, her magic had silently commanded a school broom from a great distance with ease. A broomstick detached itself from the shed across from her, darting forward without a single glance from her. Her eyes were busy elsewhere. Her jaw trembled when she'd spotted the wispy red strands of the lone Weasley twin. Her fear of heights forgotten, as she climbed the broom mindlessly. Ignorant of the startled gasps, the grunting Gryffindor ascended to the sky in her regulation school skirt.</p><p>The magnetically drawn bludgers, began orbiting around her. She zoomed by the protesting players to the red-haired menace who had his back to her. A terrible mistake on his part. The players began to dodge her as the bludgers began gaining speed. Few were brave enough to try to bat them away. Those few were unceremoniously pushed away in warning by her magic, a flare of wind driving them back. <em> Do not come closer,</em> it screamed.</p><p>Her magic craved havoc - she would grant its wish.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Fred's eyes were trying to locate the source of the mass hysteria in the stands. Searching for any hints of green and silver within the panicked crowds. Oblivious to the danger advancing behind him. He felt it, more than anything else. An indescribable feeling climbing his skin. Every wizard could feel their magic within. Flowing in rivets and merging through the tip of their wands. It was strange to feel magic outside of his own body, something he heard was common with dark objects. This didn't feel dark as such, it was by no means friendly but not dark. He turned towards the aura, eyes focusing on the familiar face. Well, that made no sense at all.</p><p>"Granger?" his red brows furrowing at the sight at the bookworm. Her name on his twisted lips seemed to anger her more.</p><p>"Arrogant-" she roared. A bludger dislodged from the circling danger aiming true. Fred swerved right, narrowly avoiding a collision. A loud rumbling sound was heard from behind him. "-Overgrown-" the next bludger zoomed faster, disappointed by the failure of its predecessor. Fred reacted faster, aware of the coming danger and bending low. The bludger crashed viscously behind him.</p><p>"- Dim-witted -" he inhaled deeply. Two bludgers sprung free, interweaving with one another towards him. He inverted his broom to hang from it, hoping to confuse the enchanted bludgers. It worked as he hoped it would. "- Thick-skulled bullying... greasy git! -" she snarled, as the remaining bludgers paused mid-air. He righted his broom, redirecting the blood flow throughout his body.</p><p>Fred Weasley was sure of one thing. His mother's enchanted clock had one half of the dynamic duo in the centre of Mortal Peril. It was entirely possible that the Weasley Matron was currently trying to break wards constructed by the founders themselves. There were several popping noises as the remaining bludgers doubled - No - <em>tripled?</em> He shook his head, clearing his mind. He was sure of something else, too. Fred Weasley was in terrible trouble.</p><p>It was time to take his troubles to the sky. He kicked his broom, leaving the disgruntled witch in his dust. He frantically searched for an exit as the angry buzzing behind him grew closer. He edged around the enclosed field, flying near the fleeing stands of Gryffindors. Ignoring the shrieking, he dipped below the stands as a bludger barrelled through the wooden support.</p><p>He tried to gain momentum but Fred was no seeker. His large frame was an irksome hinderance slowing him down. The dark underbelly of the ageing Quidditch Stands, and soaring speed was obscuring his vision. The world was moving too fast to think. He paused to regain his senses, he needed something, and he needed it post-haste.</p><p>He needed a Fred Weasley sized exit.</p><p>A gush of air wind brushed his chin, the wall before him crumbled with the force of the heat-seeking demon balls bursting through. He swung behind a wooden beam for protection, as they barrelled through the opposing wall. Well, that hole could fit every Weasley through it. That was a big task. He smiled, thanking the fates for allowing him the grace of seeing another day.</p><p>He emerged from the jagged hole created by the bludgers, surrounded by a comforting silence. He ventured towards the centre of the field, ready to boast his survival to his adoring fans. Maybe he thanked them too soon.</p><p>A stray bludger clipped the front of his regulation broom. Splintering the wooden handle with a clean snap, sending the broom onto a fierce tailspin. He was ejected from the broom, landing harshly on the sanded ground of the Quidditch Field. He groaned as his body sung with pain. Flickering eyes opened to the clear blue skies of the still October day.</p><p>A small black dot besmirched the empty sky, the glaring sun obscuring his vision. The dot began to grow as it came closer. Eventually, the shape of a woman with swirling brown locks formed. The sun highlighting the streaks of golden tones in her tumbling curls.</p><p>"Next time, pass your dreadful experiments to someone who deserves it. No! better yet- someone who can defend themselves with more than bloody levitation spell!" she hissed, jumping from her broom, puffing her chin up. What just happened?</p>
