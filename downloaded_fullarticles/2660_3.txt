    <p>"Hmm" I hear myself immediately sink into boredom as I wake up on a breezy Thursday morning in June.</p>
<p>Nothing has been exciting since I started school a few years ago. I'm thirteen now and I can't remember a single day I actually enjoyed being in school, luckily it's summertime and I can spend my days however I choose to. Most of my time is dedicated to wandering around my neighborhood parks enjoying the sounds of nature, and people biking and talking with each other along the trails. Strange, I always enjoy being around people, but I don't enjoy talking to them, like I wanted to live in a translucent bubble. It was probably due to how I was raised. After my parents divorced, my Mom and I spent a lot of time trying to find a new place to live and eventually our journeys, and her job, took us to Bristol, England. Where people were polite enough to talk, but not polite enough to listen, especially to a thirteen year old girl like me. So I stayed quite, which was fine with me. Looks good enough, I thought to myself, sitting down on a bench and beginning to enjoy my book. I must've been there for hours because before I knew it, I looked up and the sun had began to set. So I stood up and made my way home.</p>
<p>As soon as I opened the door, I heard the rush of water and the sizzling of a hot pan, a clear sign that my Mom was home.</p>
<p>        "Hey there!" she shouted excitedly from the kitchen. "How was your day?"</p>
<p>        "Oh it was fine, how about yours?" I replied as I took my shoes off and closed the door.</p>
<p>        "Great actually, I met this girl at work who's just lovely, we made plans to go see a movie and get drinks later this week"</p>
<p>I could almost hear the smile on her face, and that made me smile too. I was proud of her, my Mom and I were both somewhat shy and moving to a new country didn't make it easy for us to find friends. I thought it was funny that my mom made a friend before I did, maybe it's easier for adults.</p>
<p>        "That's nice, I'm happy for you!" I said as I made my way into the kitchen.</p>
<p>I put my book on the counter, and hopped up next to it, bending over the pan to see what she was making. It looked like some sort of pan-fried vegetable mix.</p>
<p>        "Could you, first of all, get your butt off of my nice new counter-top? And second, go grab the mail? I forgot to grab it on the way in." she asked shooing me away.</p>
<p>        "Aw, and just as I was getting all comfy." I said softly as I hopped down and walked away.</p>
<p>As I grabbed the mail, I flipped through it, noticing a few bills, a newspaper, and some old shopping catalogs. I stopped in my tracks when I came across the last piece of mail, what looked like an vintage envelope with a red stamp on the back of it. I flipped it over and read my name and address, so I opened it and saw that I was accepted at 'Hogwarts School Of Witchcraft And Wizardry'. I almost couldn't believe it, I mean was this even a real place? 'Witchcraft and Wizardry'? Maybe this was a joke? I made my way back inside the house and closed the door once more.</p>
<p>        "Uh, Mom? What's this letter about?" I asked as I hastily put it in front of her.</p>
<p>        "What are you talking about-" she began to ask, but then immediately stopped.</p>
<p>        "'Hogwarts School Of Witchcraft And Wizardry'?...'Enclosed list of all necessary books and equipment'?...'TERM BEGINS ON SEPTEMBER FIRST'?!?!?! 'WE AWAIT YOUR OWL BY NO LATER THAN JULY THIRTY FIRST'?!?!?!?!?!" she began reading the letter calmly, but she was shouting by the end of it.</p>
<p>        "So, Mom, what is this all about?"</p>
<p>I was more confused than ever.</p>
<p>        "I don't know, maybe this is your new school? I've never heard of one this before, but I mean if they've already accepted you, it must mean something. We have to get all of these things right away!" she said as she pulled out another part of the letter.</p>
<p>Enjoying a home cooked meal, we busied the night away with thoughts of this unknown place.</p>
