    <p>Draco Malfoy was irritated. He had expected his afternoon at the company to be productive. He initially had planned his afternoon reading his company's latest operational report. Then, he wanted to spend the rest of the afternoon writing a strategic plan for Malfoy Holding's next business venture.</p><p>He did not plan for this.</p><p>He frowned as he watched the commotion that greeted him as he stepped into the foyer of Malfoy Holdings. The scene that greeted him was not pretty.</p><p>Cormac McLaggen, the boyfriend of his lead researcher was having a scuffle with Mr Barnaby, the Head of Security in front of the lift bay. Cormac had managed to claw poor Mr Barnaby right forearm, leaving four long welts there.</p><p><em>I am not expecting this. </em>He groaned inwardly, wincing for the poor Mr Barnaby.</p><p>Cormac got pass Mr Barnaby and almost step into the lift, intending to go the lower ground laboratories searching for his girfriend before he was being shoved to the ground by a burly security. The drunk wizard kept calling Hermione out to 'please forgive him' and 'it is not like what it seems'.</p><p><em>Ah, no longer her boyfriend then, </em>Draco snickered.</p><p>Everybody working in this building knew that the lower ground laboratories were off limits to non personnel. Cormac was not even an employee of Malfoy Holdings. He made matters worse by forcefully demanding entry from the Head of Security of Malfoy Holdings.</p><p>With a severe glare thrown towards the haggard looking Mr Barnaby, Draco watched with a satisfied glee as Cormac was banished from the building with a strong banishing spell, hurtling his tall body to the sidewalk outside. Then two hulking security wizards were dispatched to man the front door in case the inebriated wizard decided to try barging into the building again to reach his ex-girlfriend.</p><p>
  <em> Infuriating.  </em>
</p><p>With a scowl on his face, Draco Malfoy went to the lower ground of Malfoy Holdings. He stalked the corridor of Malfoy Holdings Research Division, heading towards the company specialised charms laboratory which was located at the end of the corridor. He was very irritated with the commotion. </p><p>"Dumb choice of a boyfriend," he muttered under his breath.</p><p>He cast a severe frown towards any employee who was trying to greet him. Understanding his dark mood, they scurried away quickly, eager to escape his wrath. Then he stopped right in front of the laboratory.</p><p>He drew in an irritated breath and opened the door forcefully. He forwent common courtesy by barging in without knocking.</p><p>
  <em> Common courtesy be damn. </em>
</p><p>"Granger, we need to talk," Draco said in a no nonsense tone. He then proceeded to close the door of her office with a silent click.</p><p>Hermione stopped her arithmancy calculation and cast the self-dictating quill to stop annotating her notes. She heard the slight buzz of silencing spell then saw a strong locking wards shimmered on her door.</p><p>She shot him a quizzed gaze. Working alongside Draco in his company had given her the opportunity of knowing the <em> real </em> Draco-the perfect gentleman, the funny friend, the handsome wizard, the brilliant businessman, and the snarky owner of Malfoy Holdings. She had also seen how Draco draped himself with Malfoy aloofness in front of the public, shielding the <em> real </em>him from them.</p><p>Never in a million years did Hermione dream she would work alongside Draco but fate had a weird sense of humour. It all started after St. Mungo's refused to listen to her suggestion on imbuing charms spells on healing potions formula to improve its potency. Instead of studying her proposal, she was regarded as 'an eccentric lowly researcher' and 'the know-it-all Hermione Granger' by her seniors. The altercation between her and her seniors had made her lost her research position in St. Mungo's Research Division.</p><p>Frustrated with the bureaucracy, arrogance, and ignorance that she had experienced at St. Mungo's, she decided she had to take matters into her own hands. She had barged into Draco's office at Malfoy Holdings, demanding the company to start improving all their existing healing potion formulas, enhancing their healing potions' potency leaps and bounds than what the St Mungo's Research Division could produce.</p><p>Draco was courteous enough to listen to her ranting for a solid 30 minutes, then with a quirked eyebrow he asked her calmly, "when can you start your research work here?"</p><p>Fueled by her frustration towards St. Mungo's, she had snuffed her prejudice towards Draco and the Malfoy name. She had proven to Draco that she was an asset to the company by successfully improving all their existing healing potions formulas. The improvement had forced St. Mungo's Research Division to adhere to a new standard in potion making, set by her through Malfoy Holdings as an industry player.</p><p>Her clever innovation had made the company's healing potions known internationally, hence opening up international ventures. She had also invented new spells for the company's household products, which had increased product sales as well as the company's profit.</p><p>Yes, Hermione had made a difference to the wizarding world. She had done it not through the bureaucracy of the Ministry but through her hard work in the Malfoy's conglomerate.</p><p>She was proud of her position as lead researcher for Malfoy Holdings. Despite the prejudices thrown to the company by the ministry, she persevered. In turn, she thumbed her nose at the ministry by flaunting her research success whilst forcing policy change through the company's role as industry game changer.</p><p>Realising her importance to the company, Draco had set up a specialised charms laboratory for her own personal use. She even had full access to the entire building. Sometimes, Draco even imagined he had inadvertently gave her half of his company the day he agreed hiring her.</p><p>And here he was, searching for her in her laboratory space. She watched him warily from her seat. Apparently, she did not appreciate him barging into her laboratory, unannounced and demanding a talk.</p><p>
  <em> Infuriating. Her ex-boyfriend was drunk and had caused a scene upstairs while she cooped up in here, obviously oblivious of what had happened. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Look at her! How dare she cast me a wary look. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Of course she is wary. You are the owner of the company where she works. You barge into her lab demanding you want to talk. </em>
</p><p>"Yes, Malfoy. Start talking." She said curtly. Pushing her notes to the side, she leaned back on her chair, watching Draco narrowing his eyes on her.</p><p>"Your ex-boyfriend, Cormac the slimey, pretty-boy prick has made a commotion upstairs." Draco stalked towards her table and looked down his nose towards her and continued, "I suggest you improve your taste on wizards, Granger. Having strings of ex-boyfriends barging into the company to reach you is highly unprofessional."</p><p>Hermione was seething in anger hearing him calling her unprofessional. She had been very professional in her career here in Malfoy Holdings. Expunging her prejudice towards the Slytherin in front of her was a proof of her being professional. It was not her fault that the wizards she dated were assholes. It was unfair to call her unprofessional when her ex-boyfriends were the one whom had decided to come searching for her when she had clearly ended their relationship the day before.</p><p>"And you decided that by haranguing me about my poor taste of wizards is the epitome of professionalism?" She countered scathingly.</p><p>Draco watched as she stood slowly from her chair. All five feet five inches of her stood proud and stubborn in front of him. Being taller, he enjoyed watching her effort to exert her authority to him through physical intimidation.</p><p>"I have had only two ex-boyfriends, Malfoy. You identified the first as a weasel git while the second as slimey pretty-boy prick. I concede I have horrible choice of wizards, but we can't hardly call them in term of a collective noun, can we?"</p><p>Oh, he still remember her first ex-boyfriend alright. Ron Weasley had come to Malfoy Holdings searching for Hermione just like what Cormac did. He was drunk off his ass that he could barely stand. He demanded her to 'listen to him' and that 'Lavender Brown is only a friend'.</p><p>The wrath on Hermione's face was horrifying that Draco pitied the weasel git for being at the receiving end of it. Then, Hermione did something that Draco did not expect, she transfigured Ron into a weasel. As if on cue, the savior of the wizarding world, Harry fucking Potter swooped in, saving the day by comforting the weeping Hermione. Then he took the confused weasel to St. Mungo's for treatment. That was an unforgettable day. The day that Draco would cherish forever.</p><p>That was the day that Hermione bursted into sobs and hugged him for the first time. That was the day where he realised she had considered him as one of her friends. That was also the day where he realised he had fallen irrevocably in love with her.</p><p>Watching her being angry made the memory of that fateful day came to the forefront of his mind. His smile tried to burst through his frown but he tamped down the urge by distracting himself watching her chest heaving in anger instead.</p><p><em> Poor choice of distraction, </em>he admonished himself.</p><p>From his vantage point he could see a glimpse of her cleavage.</p><p><em> A cleavage from a nice pair of breasts, </em>he added.</p><p>Closing his eyes, he took in a cleansing breath. Opening his eyes, he schooled his face blank and sat down wearily. The commotion upstairs was bad enough that he did not need another drama to grace his afternoon.</p><p>Hermione was clearly confused by his sudden change of mood. She simply stood with her mouth agape.</p><p>"Sit down, Granger," he said dejectedly, suddenly feeling too tired to argue.</p><p>Hermione watched him with narrowed eyes, evaluating his sudden mood change. Noting that he had subdued his initial irritation, she sat down heavily onto her chair.</p><p>"That bad, huh?" She asked him timidly.</p><p>"Merlin, you can't imagine how ugly the scene was. He was drunk. He even physically forced Mr Barnaby to give him access to your lab," Draco rubbed his stiff neck. "Mr Barnaby has to banish him to the sidewalk. He even stationed two securities to man the front entrance."</p><p>"Oh, poor Mr Barnaby," Hermione frowned apologetically.  </p><p>"No matter. That is part of his job as Head of Security. He knew what he has gotten himself into when he sign his employment contract." Draco crossed his arms over his chest.</p><p>Hermione smiled timidly at Draco. Their gazes met for a few seconds. Hermione felt her heart stutter then she distracted herself tidying her notes in a neat stack.</p><p>"Why the break-up?" He asked her after a few moments of awkward silence.</p><p>Hermione pursed her lips angrily. She flashed him an angry stare.  </p><p>"He cheated. I saw him banging another witch on his living room sofa," she said seethingly.</p><p>"And this happened yesterday?"</p><p>"Yes, I went to his home to surprise him." Then she continued darkly, "I surprised him, alright."</p><p>He chuckled, clearly tickled by her explanation.</p><p>"Funny, Malfoy?" She asked, clearly still seething with anger.</p><p>"Funny because his romance moves on to another partner less than two months into the relationship. He clearly had a short attention span when it comes to women."</p><p>Dejectedly, Hermione rubbed her tired eyes warily.</p><p>Realising her lack of puffy eyes, Draco proded, "but you are not crying. Why? I thought women cry when they have a breakup. It is an instinctive emotional reaction."</p><p>Hermione scoffed. "You must be kidding me. Less than two months into the relationship and you expect me to cry for losing a slimey git like him. You must be underestimating my emotional intelligence." Then she muttered in a low voice, "the only thing that I regret is I don't even get to the phase of having sex with him."</p><p>"Why him on the first place? I know that you have explained that you need to end you dry spell, hence you choose him. But seriously Granger, you could have a horde of quality suitors available, waiting for your hands."</p><p>"I don't have time searching for quality suitors from a crappy group of wizards, Malfoy. If you know any successful eligible wizard, please shove him my way. I will gladly court him." Hermione huffed, frustrated with her luck on men. She cancelled her hair charms, making her soft curly hair cascading down her shoulder in waves.</p><p>Transfixed, Draco watched as she redo her hair charms, tucking the her hair back into a neat bun at the base of her nape. A few strands of her curls escaped, framing her face in soft waves.</p><p><em> I could watch her do that whole day, </em> his heart whispered wistfully.</p><p>"You could court me if you want," he suddenly blurted out.</p><p><em> Stupid. Shut up! </em>His heart chastised him.</p><p>Hermione stopped mid casting a refreshing charm on her face. She narrowed her eyes on him suspiciously.</p><p>"I am available. You can stand me all these years. You have seen the worst of me but you stayed nevertheless," he continued.</p><p>
  <em> Shut up, get up and go back to your office now! </em>
</p><p>His stupid body refused to budge. He sat there and smiled at her instead.  </p><p>Hermione laughed. "You must be kidding me," she said at last.</p><p>Draco felt a trickle of discomfort by her blatant disregard towards his proposition. He was starting to feel the telltale signs of heat progressing up his chest towards his neck. Any minute now, his blush would move from his chest to his ears.</p><p>
  <em> Fuck. </em>
</p><p>Regaining his composure, he straighten his tie, while simultaneously rubbing the base of his neck using his fingertips to tamp down the spreading blush.</p><p>Hermione's eyes followed his fingers, watching them as he rubbed his smooth skin at the base of his neck. Her gaze moved up the slope of his perfect neck to his perfect jawline, up to his perfect lips. She swallowed dryly.</p><p><em> Too perfect, </em> she moan in her heart. Then her heart did a somersault. Pining for her boss had made her delirious with longing. <em> Did he really ask me to be his girlfriend? </em></p><p><em> He is serious, look at him! </em>Her heart tried waking her up from her denial.</p><p>Then her gaze moved to his eyes, his perfect grey eyes. Their gazes met. Both of them looked at each other awkwardly.</p><p>"I am not kidding, Granger," Draco said simply. He sounded confident that Hermione cast a narrowed look at him.</p><p><em> Oh, how it will surprise her when she knows how jittery I am feeling right now. </em>Draco moaned inwardly. He felt faint with anticipation of being rejected. Pining for her had slowly drove him crazy. Being rejected now would end his yearning once and for all. It would convince him to move on.</p><p>Hermione tried remembering him having any relationship these past three years. There was none. He had never associated himself with women. He had never had any relationship. Hermione had even convinced herself that he was gay. And pining for him was useless and that Cormac was the best option for ending her dry spell.</p><p><em> Oh, Gods. Please say yes. </em>Her heart pleaded in earnest.</p><p>"Yes, Malfoy," she answered simply.</p><p>
  <em> YES! </em>
</p><p>"Alright then," he stood awkwardly. Now that he had officially courting her, he was at lost at how to react.</p><p>"Alright," she chimed in awkwardly. She stood up but made no move to go towards him.</p><p>"I will see you tonight. I am bringing you to your favourite restaurant. I will floo in at 7." Draco started to move towards the door.</p><p>"Okay," Hermione replied simply. She watched as Draco tried opening the door but failed. Realising that he had casted a strong locking charm and a silencing charm to the room, he finite both spells with a swish of his wand.</p><p>Without glancing towards her, he stalked outside with a serious look on his face. For other people, it was the face of the snarky owner of the company, but for Hermione, all that she could see was his red ears.</p><p>Life would not get even weirder than this.</p><p>Would it?</p><p> </p>
