    <p>Dean, Sam and Castiel walked into the small-town diner in Minnesota. Dean didn’t know why they were in this town, just that Bobby needed their help with a case, what he did know was that if he didn’t get a decent slice of apple pie he was going to seriously kill someone. <br/>	“What can I get you boys?” The waitress asked them. Looking her over, ok really checking her out, Dean saw that she had brilliant green eyes, Dark voluminous hair that was cut in a pixie cut, and soft looking pink lips. Her accent, British or something, sounded super hot. <br/>	“Pie, apple if you have it, and coffee.” Dean replied. He continued his assessment of the waitress as his brother and friend ordered. She was dressed in the same uniform as the other two waitresses, light green and white dress that buttoned down the front, fell to about mid-thigh and tied around the waist. Apparently done taking their order, She turned around to get their drinks and put their food in with the cook. The backside was just as attractive as the front. <br/>	“Really Dean? Checking out the waitress? I thought you were over that type of thing?” Sam questioned his brother with a tilt to his lips. He was secretly pleased that Dean was showing an interest in the woman, it had been much too long since Dean had even looked at a woman, not since Lisa.  <br/>	“Whatever Sammy. I’m just looking, can you blame me?” Keeping his eyes on the woman he saw her making her way back over with their drinks. He saw that her name tag said ‘Lily’ on it.<br/>	“Here we are boys, three coffees and a slice of apple pie.” She set everything down on the table, bending over slightly. <br/>	“Yeah, Baby. That’s it, lean over a bit more.” Some asshole from the table across from them called out reaching a hand out to touch the woman’s backside. <br/>	She stood up straight instantly, her shoulders going stiff and her hands tightening on the tray she was holding. Dean could see the anger in her emerald eyes and something else that he couldn’t describe. Dean got up from where he was sitting, walked over to the asshole who dared put his filthy hand on the green-eyed beauty, grabbed his arm and twisted it away from the woman’s backside. <br/>	“look here asshole, get your hand off her.” Twisting until the man got up out of his chair, Dean closed the distance with menace in his eyes “Get out of here and don’t come back.”<br/>	The man scrambled to leave the diner and all was quiet for several minutes while the few other patrons that were there, including Sam and Cas, looked on stunned. Turning back to the beauty, Dean put on that charming smile that had come so easily before losing Lisa and Ben. He was winded by the sudden shove of a tray to his chest as the woman rushed by him with a glare. He watched as she went to the back. <br/>	“What has gotten into you Dean?” Sit down! Everyone is staring.” Sam hissed at him. As he sat down he knew that his brother wasn’t angry with him, just confused at his seemingly chivalrous actions. To be honest, Dean didn’t know what had made him do it either. Yeah, he couldn’t stand to see a man put his hands on a woman against her will, but he typically didn’t step in, and seeing the dark-haired beauty being touched by another had angered him beyond reason. <br/>	“I’ll be back, don’t eat my pie.” With that Dean followed the woman’s path to the back of the diner.  <br/>Harrys POV<br/>	When Harry had come in to work at the diner that day he never thought that his actual Mate, the one he was destined to be with for the rest of his life, would walk in and sit down at one of his tables. After saving the Wizarding world, Harry just wanted to settle down and enjoy life. That wasn’t in the cards if he was ‘Harry Potter- The Boy Who Lived’. So, he moved to the US, to a little town in some fly-over state, and changed everything about himself. He had known for some time that he was gay and that he felt more comfortable in woman’s clothing. When his inheritance had come and he learned that he was part veela, and a submissive one at that, Harry didn’t fight it, just used it to his advantage. The androgynous features that had developed helped him become ‘Lily Potter’, pair that with his love of clothes and makeup, made becoming a woman more than easy. The only short-coming of being a Veela was the allure he couldn’t always turn off, especially if he was ‘hungry’. It drew both men and women to him and they tended to make unwanted advances. <br/>	When he got to the new patrons to ask what they wanted this morning he saw the three guys and knew that one of them was his Mate, but it wasn’t until the blond one with the hazel eyes looked at him that he knew it was that one. After barely holding it together long enough to take their orders, he went to the counter to fix the drinks and get a slice of pie for his mate. Luckily it was one he had made. After finding out that Lily was especially good at baking, the owner had asked if she could make them for the diner to sell. <br/>	Putting in the other twos orders with the kitchen, Harry made his way back over to the table. Weaving through the tables with ease that came from years of dodging Dudley’s attempts to trip him while he was carrying Aunt Petunias fine china, Harry made it to the table and placed the pie and three coffees down while telling the patrons what it was he was doing. That was when he felt the creep at the table behind him grab his ass, tensing up and straightening lightning fast, Harry had to suppress the urge to hex the man with something nasty. Tightening his grip on the tray and tamping down on the raw magic that was swirling inside of him begging to be unleashed on the arsehole who touched him so freely in front of his Mate, Harry was caught off guard when his Mate twisted the arm of his groper. <br/>	Harrys Veela purred at the chivalrous actions of his Mate, but Harry himself was angered that he would assume that Harry couldn’t defend himself. Shoving his serving tray into his Mates chest he stormed past him through the diner and out the back to where the dumpsters and the employee entrance were. Harry knew that he had to get a grip before he lost control of his magic, taking a couple of deep breaths and carding his hand through his hair, Harry paced and brought himself back under control</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>	Dean watched as Lily paced and took some calming breaths, he didn’t know why the woman was angry that he defended her.  Feeling that he should at least check on her, and introduce himself, Dean opened the back door and cleared his throat to get the raven haired beauty’s attention. <br/>	“I’m sorry if I made a scene in there…” <br/>	“ I didn’t need saving, so if you’re expecting a thank you don’t hold your breath.” The raven turned towards him scowling. The look was breath taking in Deans opinion, and he wondered if she had any other expressions that weren’t angry. <br/>	“I wasn’t, just wanted to check on you and introduce myself. I’m Dean by the way.”<br/>	“Well, Dean, I’m just fine. Now, if you will excuse me, I need to get back to work, if I even still have a job.” Lily turned towards the door. It was as if Dean couldn’t control himself, she went to brush past him and the next thing he knew he was taking her by the shoulders and pressing his lips to hers in a demanding kiss. <br/>	Harry was walking past Dean to get back into the diner when he felt the man’s arms encircle his shoulders and press their lips together in a kiss that had him curling <br/>his toes and his Veela purring in ecstasy. His body moving of its own accord, he pressed himself close to the larger man. Reaching his arms up to entwine his fingers in the short blonde hair, it was like he was finally coming home. But the strong hands that had at some point migrated to his hips pulling them in flush with his partners was like a bucket of cold ice. Harry could feel that the taller man was aroused by the kiss and knew that his own body was having a similar reaction, one that would blow his current cover. Harry ripped himself away from his mate, and had to stop the whine of disappointment from his Veela. <br/>“I have to go…” Harry said breathlessly as he practically ran inside.</p>
