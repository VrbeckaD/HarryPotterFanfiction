</p><p align="center"> </p><p>Tom was walking in the snow. He was alone, but this wasn't too unusual. For him. Most eight-year olds walking alone at near midnight may have had another opinion, but Tom was different than most.</p><p>He approached the graveyard and with a turn of his hand he opened the gate. The snow was lightly falling, but he barely noticed the flakes as he progressed past the graves. After good several minutes of walking in absolute silence, the only noise the crunch of snow against booted feet, he found who he was looking for.</p><p>His guardian was perched on a grave. His eyes were closed, a pensive expression on his face. Snow drifted into his ruffled black hair, but did not stay long, fading as it alighted on his scalp. He was dressed in a thin black waistcoat, with no added layers of clothing.</p><p>This would be baffling to all except Tom, who was convinced his guardian could not feel cold. His large black wings were extended out, providing balance from on top of the gravestone. Tom was reminded of a bird sunning itself, if it was not nearly midnight and snowing.</p><p>Tom dug his hands into his pockets, fighting the urge to shiver in the cold. He let his eyes wander to the epitaph on the gravestone, where it read:</p><p> </p><p align="center">James Potter- Born 27 March 1960, Died 31 October 1981</p><p>and,</p><p align="center">Lily Potter- Born 30 January 1960, Died 31 October 1981</p><p align="center">
  <em>"The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death."</em>
</p><p> </p><p>He wondered who they were. After a few moments of standing in silence, Tom settled on a cough. In response his guardian's eyes slowly opened. Electric green pupils surrounded by black sclera focused on him.</p><p>"Tom." spoke his guardian. Tom nodded, shivering again. The black wings flapped out, then folded behind him. Noiselessly he dropped from the grave, black leather shoes pressing into the snow the only indication he had moved. He towered over Tom, leaning over, almost like he was smelling him.</p><p>"You are hungry and cold." came the toneless response.</p><p>Tom's stomach growled in response, and the eight-year old fought the urge to fidget in embarrassment. Instead he settled on kicking a drift of snow. His guardian waited patiently, until-</p><p>"Can we go to Tescos?" blurted Tom.</p><p>Inhuman eyes narrowed, but then closed in weary acceptance. Tom let out a small cheer, as his guardian inclined his head for him to lead. Tom raced ahead, nearly tripping over a grave in excitement until the two reached the main gate of the cemetery. His guardian closed the gate behind them, while Tom looked out into the night. The hour was quite late, and aside from the lights of the nearby church, there were no other souls out in the snowy evening air.</p><p>The two began to walk, and Tom managed to keep a step ahead, enjoying the small footprints he left in the deepening snow. Soon they approached the impressive frame of the neighbourhood church. Lights glowed from the large upper windows, and they could hear singing from within. The sound of the hymnals brought some comfort to Tom but seemed to little affect his solemn guardian.</p><p>As they passed by the church, Tom's eyes focused on a stained-glass window depicting a scene of the angel Gabriel visiting the Virgin Mary. He then flickered his gaze over to-</p><p>"I am not." replied his guardian to the unspoken question. Tom scowled.</p><p>"I wish you wouldn't do that."</p><p>His guardian didn't respond.</p><p>Finally, they walked to the outskirts of Godric's Hollow, where the bright lights of a garish Tescos store beckoned. Tom's face lit up in glee, as he pelted up into the store. He hesitated only a moment to ensure his guardian's presence was with him.</p><p>His guardian paused at the door, reaching into a pocket of his waistcoat. Shaking off the snow that had accumulated around his pocket, he drew forth a pair of circular eyeglasses. Placing them on the bridge of his nose, the black sclera suddenly shifted to a human white. He eyed his reflection in the glass of the sliding door, neon green eyes subdued to jade.</p><p>"Come on!" Tom grabbed his hand, his guardian hissing as he was hastily dragged into the warmth of artificial light. A fast flap of his wings, and they were as if they had never been there, vanishing in the light's touch.</p><p>A despondent teenager manned the counter, the only living thing in the store that evening. His brown eyes only briefly looked at them, attracted to the noise, but then went back to reading a magazine on the counter.</p><p>Tom released his guardian's hand, approaching a stacked display of soda and crisps. He mindlessly grabbed at the bags of crisps as his guardian simply watched.</p><p>After snatching as many of the crisps he could handle, he brought them forward to the counter, dumping the bags in front of the clerk. Tom's head twisted back to give his guardian a pleading look. Wordlessly the man approached the boy's side, his hand digging into his pants' pocket.</p><p>But no sooner had he done so, then did a thunderous <strong><em>BANG </em></strong>roar within the store. The teen behind the counter let out a startled scream, as debris came hurtling towards them. But with a swift swipe of his guardian's hand, the rubble harmlessly pelted away, only blanketing them in a thin layer of dust.</p><p>Half the shop's perimeter was missing. The ceiling, now open to the sky, began to drop fat snowflakes on the ground. Crisps were everywhere. But this hardly held Tom's interest. For suddenly into the store appeared several dark robed figures, with shining silver masks. The leader, Tom noticed, held a wand.</p><p>His guardian sucked in an unnecessary breath, and Tom felt his fingers dig into his small shoulder. Tom yelped, which was his mistake. The leader's mask snapped to the sound, and, without a moment's hesitation, he sent a green spell spiraling at them.</p><p>Tom's guardian didn't hesitate either. He tackled Tom to the ground as the green energy lashed over their heads. It unfortunately found a target in the store clerk, whose brown eyes widened and glazed with the instant stopping of his heart.</p><p>As the body fell, Tom squirmed under his guardian's larger bulk. Torn between fear and flight, he writhed, as his guardian snapped at him. "Don't move!"</p><p>His guardian needn't worried, because within moments a yellow burst of light drew forth. An opposing group had appeared in front of the duo, led by a short-haired woman.</p><p>Unlike their nemeses, this group was unmasked.</p><p>"<em>Protego</em>!" barked a male newcomer, and one of the masked men dropped. A silver masked man sent a green spell towards an opposing brown-haired man, who quickly deflected. Tom watched in amazement as the two factions began to earnestly duel each other, magic snapping back and forth.</p><p>But Tom's guardian was having none of that. Dragging himself to his feet, he spread reappeared black wings out to full-length, grabbing Tom by the arm. Tom knew what was coming next. His guardian had the ability to simply shift himself wherever he wanted to be. Tom prepared himself for the instantaneous transportation.</p><p>But neither were prepared as the short-haired woman turned to face them, her eyes going from Tom, then up to her guardian's, focusing on his forehead. Her eyes widened in recognition.</p><p>"Harry...?" she gasped out.</p><p>With that, the boy and his guardian winked out.</p><p>They reappeared again in Godric's Hollow, outside the large house they had called home for the past year.  His guardian stood immobile in the snow, as if someone had dumped ice water on his head.</p><p>"Uh...Harry?" Tom asked, shaking his guardian's hand. This seemed to rise the man from his stupor.</p><p>"We cannot stay here." his guardian stated, stalking forward to the door. Tom blinked, following him into the home. The winged man slammed the door open, not even hesitating as a drift of snow slumped in after it. Tom quickly shut the door behind them, kicking away the snow.</p><p>His guardian flicked the light switches on in the house and paced forward, his wings flapping out behind him. As the two ascended the staircase to the second floor of the house, Tom tugged on his guardian's waistcoat, not letting go until they were at the top of the stairs.</p><p>"Where will we go?" Tom asked.</p><p>"Away." His guardian frowned, and then dug into his pocket, removing his own wand. Tom noticed the glasses hadn't left his face.</p><p>With a flick of his wrist, his guardian had managed to summon the paltry belongings the two shared. This consisted of mostly Tom's things cramming into a brown suitcase which had appeared along with the rest of their things. Another loud noise came from outside, and Tom flinched.</p><p>His guardian waved the wand a final time, and with that, the suitcase shut itself. He re-pocketed his wand and brought his hands to his face, gently removing the glasses. The whites of his eyes flicked to pitch black.</p><p>A shudder went through the house. His guardian pocketed the glasses, now neon green eyes focusing on Tom.</p><p>"Come here."</p><p>Tom approached hesitantly, dipping down ever so slightly so that his small hand could clasp the handle of the brown suitcase.</p><p>"Take my hand."</p><p>Tom did. A loud crashing noise was heard, which Tom understood to be the front door breaking open. A cold blast of air rushed in, but it did not matter.</p><p>A group stalked in the home. Tom couldn't tell whether they were the masked figures or their opponents. All he could see as their image began to blur was their wands extended.</p><p>And so, the boy named Tom and the man once named Harry vanished.</p><p> </p><p>Tom decided he didn't like their new home.</p><p>For starters, it was hardly new. In fact, it was the very same home they had left. However, there were a series of changes that Tom found he disliked in the place.</p><p>For starters, the television was gone. In its place was an over-sized radio which only played classical music (he suspected this was his guardian's doing). The rooms had a musty smell to them, with still black and white pictures of people neither he nor his guardian knew framed on the walls. The kitchen was smaller too. The electric stove was gone, as well as the microwave. Now there was a small oven, a fireplace, and a tea kettle.</p><p>As a matter of fact, Tom frowned as he spent the next day walking through their home, those weren't the only things. There were smaller changes that he picked up- for instance, all the electric outlets were missing.</p><p>This wasn't much of an inconvenience to one of them, considering his guardian probably didn't own anything that required a charge, (In fact, he didn't seem to own much of anything) but Tom, who had invested his birthday money on rechargeable batteries for his pocket radio and torch, was displeased.</p><p>"Tom." rang his guardian's voice from the kitchen. Tom abandoned his exploration of the second floor. He found his guardian sitting on a small stool, a mug of tea cradled between his pale hands.</p><p>His entirely black outfit was in stark contrast to the homely yellowness of the kitchen, and Tom felt the need to fight a smirk off his face of how out of sorts the picture looked. His guardian simply waved his hand for an indication for Tom to sit. He did so.</p><p>"You have questions." came the monotone voice.</p><p>Tom nodded, before blurting out, "Who were those men?"</p><p>"Men?" his guardian quirked an eyebrow, gently placing the steaming mug on the yellow table.</p><p>Tom scowled. "And women, fine. There was a woman too." His guardian shifted to allow the wingtips of his great black wings to drag on the floor.</p><p>"It is irrelevant now." His guardian began, and he held up a hand as Tom rose to his feet in protest of the unanswered question, "Because where we are, they do not exist yet."</p><p>"Where..we...are?" Tom repeated, still standing.</p><p>"Yes. We are in Godric's Hollow-"</p><p>"I figured that out-" Tom interrupted, but his guardian continued as if he hadn't heard-</p><p>"-1935." finished his guardian. Tom's eyes widened at that.</p><p>"We're...what?" Tom gaped. "But....we were in..." he suddenly realized wasn't quite sure of the date they had left. Tom scrunched his nose, "2003...2004?"</p><p>"Correct." His guardian picked the mug up again and sipped. It was still steaming- and knowing him as he did, he wouldn't have been surprised if it had been scalding.</p><p>"But...why did we leave?" asked Tom</p><p>"That attack." His guardian stared at the cup now, "Is a symptom of a greater evil in our world. The fighting is spilling into the streets as the war draws to a bitter close. We have been fortunate enough to mostly avoid such violent encounters. But they would have only increased the longer we stayed in that time. And if we had remained and re-encountered those men, we would have run the risk of facing... "</p><p>His guardian trailed off. Tom shifted in his seat, unsure of what to say. His guardian closed his neon-black eyes, pausing for a moment. He then opened them, neon green flicking to the boy's face.</p><p>"But that leads to why we are here. To prevent that future from happening." </p><p>"Why now?" Tom asked.</p><p>"Remember when I told you you were adopted?"</p><p>"Yes...?" Tom hadn't pressed the circumstances of his birth, as it generally fell into the 'don't ask' category his guardian normally adhered to.</p><p>"I adopted you in 1929." His guardian's electric eyes met his own in a level stare. Tom swallowed.</p><p>"1929...?"</p><p>"Yes." his guardian calmly replied, "I do not expect you to remember."</p><p>Tom rubbed his head, trying to process all this information. "So, you came and brought me from the past...to the future?"</p><p>"Yes." His guardian looked up at an ornate clock fixed on the wall, then looked back to Tom.</p><p>"Why?" said Tom.</p><p>"Because I wanted you to understand what it will become. " He leaned forward, a pale finger tracing the rim of the steaming mug in a gentle, circular pattern. "We have always lived in hiding," his guardian said, "because of..."</p><p>"The Dark Lord." Tom automatically replied. "He who must not be named."</p><p>"....Yes."</p><p>"Is that who those masked men were?"</p><p>"His followers, yes."</p><p>"And the one who called you Harry?"</p><p>"My name is unimportant as is her name. What matters is what we do from here." His guardian then rose, making his way over to the fireplace.</p><p>Tom shifted in his seat, as the older man observed the fire. Wordlessly he waved his hand, and the fire began to grow warmer, licking up the length of the burning logs. He began to speak once more, eyes focused on the flames.</p><p>"It is imperative that no one knows we came from the future, Tom. Too many things could go wrong."</p><p>"Like what?"</p><p>"We could end up creating the future we are trying to avoid."</p><p>"Why don't we just stop it in the first place? That's why we came back, right? To get He-who must-not-be-named? " Tom kicked his legs out from the stool, as if to emphasize his point, "Let's go and kill him before he can even become the Dark Lord!"</p><p>This was apparently the wrong thing to say. His guardian's black wings suddenly snapped out to full length as he simultaneously slammed his fists down with a <em>CRACK </em>on the top of the fireplace.  Large fissures appeared in the wall, and the room gave a small shudder.</p><p>Tom shrunk into his seat. His guardian kept his back to him.</p><p> Minutes passed in awkward silence, as the man held his position half-bent over the impacted fireplace, balled hands dug into the brick. Finally, he dragged his hands away from the indentations in the hearth and stood up straight. His wingspan receded slowly.</p><p>"No." his guardian said softly. He didn't look at Tom.</p><p>Tom fidgeted, wishing in that moment he could disappear at will too. "Well...what do we do then?" </p><p>His guardian turned around but didn't meet his gaze. Instead, he quietly walked over to the nearby sink, pausing over the silver basin. He reached out a pale hand to the faucet, twisting the handle and releasing the flow of water. He then moved his hands into the stream, brick dust sloughing off into the shimmering liquid. </p><p>Tom had the impression he hadn't said the right thing. He tried again.</p><p>"How can we change the future?" Tom's eyebrows did the talking for him, and he willed his guardian to look at him. He watched as his guardian twisted the faucet off and reached out for a nearby hand towel. Drying himself methodically, the man turned to finally face Tom. He had a pensive look on his face.</p><p>"Well, that depends on you."</p><p>"Me?" asked Tom.</p><p>"Yes." His guardian's neon green eyes seemed to glow brighter as the afternoon sun faded into evening. With the black sclera, it was akin to staring at live electricity.</p><p>"Why me?"</p><p>"Because you know where we come from."</p><p>"But so do you."</p><p>His guardian sighed, depositing the hand towel to its holder. "I had my chance, Tom. The future will be determined by you." He slowly approached Tom from the sink, until he was towering over him.  Wordlessly, he extended a pale hand out towards Tom's head.</p><p>Tom froze at this display, unsure of what to do. His guardian's pale fingers reached and paused above Tom's hair, as if to ruffle it. But then the moment died, and his guardian pulled back.</p><p>Tom's heart squeezed painfully in his chest. He quickly turned his head away to stare at the nearby wall. He didn't want the other man to see his face.</p><p>"But why come now?" his guardian offered in response. Tom nodded glumly, still not looking at him.</p><p>"You need to adjust to this time. In three years you will go to school, and from there your choices may determine the future for the better. In the meantime, I will teach you."</p><p>Tom quickly turned to face his guardian again, his melancholy chased away by sudden interest. "Magic?" he asked shrewdly.</p><p>"Among other things, " his guardian studied his face. Tom dipped his gaze to his trainers to avoid further scrutiny. The allure of finally learning magic had solidified his dedication to his guardian's cause.</p><p>But still.</p><p>"I just don't get why we don't we stop the Dark Lord in first place."</p><p>"Who says we will not?" His guardian replied mysteriously.</p><p>Tom had no answer for that.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>1938</em>
</p><p>Tom was sitting on the stairs of their home when the letter came. In fact, he was in the midst of attempting to non-verbally light a small pile of sticks aflame when, from the sky, dove a rather large tawny owl straight for his head.</p><p>Tom let out an undignified squawk as the bird swooped, and in doing so tumbled down the steps, ungracefully collapsing in a heap. A small tap resounded from his head, and he observed a yellow envelope spiral to the ground next to him. He scowled.</p><p>"Stupid bird." he groused. He watched the bird do a round -a-bout of the house and return to the sky. He wished he was proficient enough to throw a fireball after it, but in regards to his current failed attempts of setting sticks on fire, he was more likely to douse himself.</p><p>But whatever misgivings he had were erased when he saw the crest emblazoned on the envelope.</p><p>
  <em>Hogwarts.</em>
</p><p>He feverishly ripped open the letter, scanning the topmost parchment.</p><p>It read:</p><p>HOGWARTS SCHOOL of WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY</p><p>Headmaster: Armando Dippet</p><p>(Order of Merlin, First Class, Grand Sorc., Chf. Warlock, International Confed. of Wizards)</p><p>Dear Mr. Potter,</p><p>We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment.</p><p>Term begins on 1 September. We await your owl by no later than 31 July.</p><p>Yours sincerely,</p><p> </p><p>Albus Dumbledore</p><p>Deputy Headmaster</p><p> </p><p>Another piece of parchment fell out behind the first one, and Tom caught a glimpse of its titled as it cascaded to the ground.</p><p align="center">HOGWARTS SCHOOL of WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY</p><p align="center">UNIFORM</p><p align="center">First-year students will require-</p><p>But he wasn't interested it in the slightest. No, his guardian had already briefed him of the sorts of things he would need for his upcoming term. What really grabbed his attention was how the letter had been addressed.</p><p>He grabbed the envelope itself, reversing it from the impressed seal to inspect the address.</p><p align="center">Mr. T. Potter</p><p align="center">13 Lavenham Place</p><p align="center">Godric's Hollow, Suffolk.</p><p>"Tom?" inquired a voice from behind him.</p><p>Tom leaped to his feet, brandishing the letter like a prize. "It came, it came!"</p><p>His guardian rarely smiled, but the beginnings of one looked like it was twitching around his mouth. At least, those eyes creased slightly, indicating his pleasure.</p><p>"I suppose we'll have to make a few trips to get your school things, books, a wand, school robes-"</p><p>"Potter." interrupted Tom, holding out the letter, shaking it in emphasis. "It says Potter."</p><p>A pause.</p><p>"You've never told me my last name." Tom pressed. "It's Potter?"</p><p>His guardian stared at the address for a moment, then looked back to Tom's expectant face.</p><p>"Yes." he said.</p><p>"It's really my last name?"</p><p>His guardian nodded.</p><p>"Was it my father's?"</p><p>Now there was a frown.</p><p>"My mother's...?" Tom drifted the sentence, watching his face for any affirmation. While his guardian's past was always a sore point, asking about Tom's own was hit or miss. He knew he had been adopted from the past, but when he had eventually asked about his parents, his guardian had only mentioned of his mother's death.</p><p>His father was never mentioned.</p><p>"It was....my name." his guardian finalized.</p><p>"Your name?" Tom was floored. This was the equivalent of when his guardian had confirmed the existence of magic. Granted it was impossible not believe in when your caretaker had a 6-meter wingspan, but the admission at the time had still been momentous.</p><p>Much like the epiphany that suddenly struck Tom.</p><p>"Your name is Harry Potter." Tom stated triumphantly.</p><p>His guardian vanished.</p><p><em>Whatever</em>, thought Tom, returning his attention back to the second page, well used to his guardian's mercurial mood swings. He spent the rest of the afternoon re-reading the letter on the stairs.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>September 1st, King's Cross.</em>
</p><p>Tom quickly scanned the train station, his agitation at the approaching deadline and the fear of not making the train in time worried his steps. "Come on!" he hissed, looking around frantically for the entrance to the platform.</p><p>Despite his insistence, Tom's guardian wasn't with him. When the monumental day had finally come, he had simply whisked them into what was (thankfully) an unused washroom at the station.</p><p>Tom had expected a grandiose speech, something on the likes of "The future depends on you." But all he had gotten was a "Do your best." and his guardian winked out.</p><p>He sighed for the umpteenth time, suitcase banging into his knees.</p><p>Tom luckily passed the right wall on the third go, as he observed a pair of blonde girls vanish into a wall. He nearly tripped himself trying to catch them, but soon found himself successfully through the enchanted brick.</p><p>Immediately the scenery changed, and he was observing what was the Hogwarts Express, exhausting plumes of red smoke into the air. His heartbeat began to increase in excitement. Finally, after years of waiting, he was finally going to Hogwarts to learn magic.</p><p>"Didn't I just see you?" someone said on his right.</p><p>Tom turned to the speaker, which was one of the blonde girls he observed walking into the wall.  "Uh..yes?" he replied.</p><p>"Did you get off the train for some air? It's about to leave."</p><p>The train whistled ominously at that, and he hurried onto the first carriage, unwilling to let destiny start without him.</p><p> </p><p>Tom was hurried into the castle with the anxious group of first years to avoid the now rainy exterior of castle. He had met several more people since the train, but it had been difficult for him to hold conversation with anyone. Having spent eight years in the presence of a singular man, Tom's lack of social skills was coming back to bite him.</p><p>He mentally vowed to improve this, but his self-deprecation was interrupted by the arrival of the Sorting hat.</p><p>Tom squirmed nervously in his seat. His guardian had told him most everything of what to expect, so he hadn't been too afraid of this moment to come. But seeing the hat now, his stomach began to flip-flop, wondering:</p><p>
  <em>Tom and his guardian were sitting in the garden. The flourishing of the garden was Tom's doing, least, Tom had believed it so- he had only observed his guardian coming out and staring at the flowers from time to time. They were Chrysanthemums- Tom had spent one afternoon at a nearby florist, having initially picked out roses. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Upon realizing their cost, he had spent a good twenty minutes confusing the shopkeeper when he had inquired about credit cards. Thankfully the issue was resolved when he had settled for the more affordable alternative.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>They were nice, Tom reflected, reds, whites, and a spattering of yellows. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>"There are four houses at Hogwarts." began today's lesson. Tom had turned away from observing the flowers to give his undivided attention, "Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, Slytherin, and Gryffindor."</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Each house values different qualities. Hufflepuffs for their loyalty, Ravenclaws their knowledge, Slytherin values cunning, and Gryffindor esteems bravery. Ultimately, the decision of which house you will be placed in rests with you."</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"What house were you placed in?" asked Tom.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>His guardian tapped the table thoughtfully, as if considering answering this. "What house do you think I was placed in?" he replied.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Hufflepuff?" guessed Tom.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>A wry smile.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Gryffindor."</em>
</p><p> </p><p>"....<em>Oh I'm not much to look at, </em></p><p>
  <em>in being a simple hat.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>So put me on, give me a try!</em>
</p><p><em>I'm so much more than meets the eye</em>."</p><p>Tom abruptly cut off from his thoughts when he realized he had ignored most of the sorting hat's song. He cursed himself. His guardian had mentioned the hat often relayed clues to upcoming events in the school, and in the knowledge he was here to prevent something from happening made it that much more irritating he missed it.</p><p>A tall bearded man approached the podium. He had reddish-hair with the faintest traces of grey intermingled in the mane. He also observed him placing small spectacles on his nose.</p><p><em>This must be Professor Dumbledore. </em>mused Tom.</p><p>"This year's students will be announced in reverse order. " he announced, which had the first years looking anxiously amongst themselves. "And in so doing thus, we will start from the back and work our way forward. Let's start with-" he looked to his parchment.</p><p>"Yardley, Nathaniel!"</p><p>Tom watched as the first nervous student sat, and the hat was placed surreptitiously over his head. The hat made a humming noise. "Yes, I see..." it said..... "better be....GRYFFINDOR!"</p><p>A loud cheer came from the Gryffindor table as the brown haired student pumped his first in victory. Professor Dumbledore gave a small smile, turning back to the parchment.</p><p>A few more names and houses were called, "Yaes, Micheal.... RAVENCLAW! Worthington, Matthew....HUFFLEPUFF! Wideman, Alice......RAVENCLAW! Watson, Janet...SLYTHERIN!"</p><p>A series of claps came over from the Slytherin table, as the blonde girl from the train earlier crossed over. Tom briefly eyed their assembly, recalling they valued cunning.</p><p><em>There were a lot of S names, </em>Tom mused, as the seventh one approached the hat, "Saddle, Luke....GRYFFINDOR!" He found himself observing the ceiling, eyeing the nightscape. His guardian had mentioned the ceiling was enchanted- did the rain merely evaporate prior to contact, or was illusioned to disappear?</p><p>"Rosier, Mark....SLYTHERIN!"</p><p>Speaking of enchantment, what house would he go in? He glanced over at the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff tables. He hardly knew what traits he held in himself- he did read quite a bit, would that qualify him to the Ravenclaws? But he was loyal to this 'change the future cause.' Would the hat see that in him as well?</p><p>"..iddle, Tom...SLYTHERIN!"</p><p>Tom half-sprung in his chair at hearing his first name called. But then he realized his mistake and sat down, embarrassed. Some of the other first years sent him curious glances, but he shrugged deprecatingly, as if he didn't know why he had moved in the first place.</p><p>"Quentin, Adam.....RAVENCLAW!"</p><p>"Potter, Tom!"</p><p>He stood up, and the murmuring within the student body seemed to increase. Tom suddenly felt nervous, if all the eyes of the great hall were on him. The hat was waiting, and as he approached, he felt his palms begin to sweat.</p><p>Professor Dumbledore was watching him intently. Tom couldn't read the expression on his face, but it almost looked.... surprised?</p><p>He sat down, and the hat was placed on his head. A voice appeared.</p><p>"Didn't I just see you?"</p><p>"What?" Tom asked incredulously.</p><p>"You heard me." the hat replied obstinately.</p><p>Tom felt his face colour. Of all the things he had expected, a malcontent hat was not one of them. "Aren't you supposed to sort me?" He grit out.</p><p>"I already did. I put you in Slytherin."</p><p>Tom growled. "No you didn't, I just got up here!"</p><p>"Are you sure?"</p><p>Tom wondered if anybody else was hearing this, because this was too bizarre. Was this some kind of test? Would he be sent back home if he didn't answer correctly? How was he supposed to change anything if he was unfit for sorting?</p><p>"Can you please....sort...me..." he ground out.</p><p>"I suppose you won't leave if I don't." the hat said. "Don't see why I have to do it twice... Well, as I said before, it'll be Slyther-"</p><p>"No!" barked Tom. He flushed again, as he realized that was probably very audible to the audience. He dropped his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "I mean....if you already put me there, put me somewhere else this time."</p><p>The hat paused, as if it hadn't considered this.</p><p>Tom took in a deep breath and counted to ten.</p><p>"Well, better be....GRYFFINDOR!"</p><p>Tom opened his eyes, letting out a whoosh of breath.</p><p>A spattering of claps came from the Gryffindor table as Tom made his way over. His guardian's own house- a strange sort of pride came over him in that moment. He wasn't an easy person to live with, but this was surely some sign of the kinship the two shared. He sat down at the table, basking in the moment.</p><p>"So, disappointed you weren't sorted with your brother?" nudged an older student, interrupting his thoughts.</p><p>Tom blinked, looking up at the speaker sitting next to him. The Gryffindor had red hair and a spattering of freckles on his nose, and a shiny P pinned onto his dress robes. There was a certain look of mischief about him, so Tom decided he must be pulling his leg.</p><p>"I don't have a brother."</p><p>The older student grinned. "Excuse me, your twin then." Tom's brows furrowed. The student looked at him, expecting a response.</p><p>"No...?" Tom replied, unsure.</p><p> The red-headed's grin didn't fade. "Well, he sure looks wound up."</p><p>Tom followed the student's gaze over to the Slytherin table. And he ended up locking eyes with...</p><p>
  <em>himself.</em>
</p><p align="center"> </p><p>Tom's heart hadn't stopped pounding since the end of evening.</p><p>There was no way he could run over to the Slytherin table and demand answers, because it would appear strange in a setting where he was pretending to be a normal student.</p><p>What did it mean??</p><p>As the older students began to usher them up the stairs, Tom remained at the back of the group, trying to find a professor. He had to contact his guardian as soon as possible. But how? He didn't have an owl....would he need to post a letter? How long would that even take? But his questioning thoughts didn't have long to fester in his mind, as he was approached by-</p><p>"Professor Dumbledore!"</p><p>"Ah, yes, just the boy I was looking for!"</p><p>Tom rubbed his left arm in barely contained agitation- "Professor," he blurted "there's a-"</p><p>"Tom Riddle?" he replied understandingly.</p><p>"...Y-yes." <em>His name was Riddle.</em></p><p>"I have to say, when I saw you approach the sorting hat, I myself had to do double-take that you were not Mr. Riddle yourself."</p><p>"Right..." Tom said weakly.</p><p>"But judging by your reactions, I would say you were just as surprised as I was. " He glanced over him again, blue eyes flickering to his clenched fists. "Though it is a tad late, perhaps... we should reconvene on the morrow to discuss this further?</p><p>"I don't think I could sleep if I wanted to, Professor." Tom said, anxiously. Dumbledore looked sympathetic.</p><p>"Unfortunately Mr. Riddle has retired with his housemates to Slytherin already, so we will not get much information out of him. But perhaps we can contact your parents to them know of the situation?"</p><p>Tom bowed his head, feeling secondhand embarrassment for what he had to say, "Sorry, Professor, I don't have parents."</p><p>"My mistake." Dumbledore said kindly. "Your...?"</p><p>"I have a guardian." he fidgeted.</p><p>"Your guardian." Dumbledore repeated.</p><p>Tom nodded glumly, "I was adopted."</p><p>Dumbledore didn't comment. Instead, he gestured with a hand, and Tom swallowed his trepidation, following the professor into the gloom of the nearby passageway. They walked in relative silence, passing curious enchanted portraits.</p><p><em>Great. </em>thought Tom. <em>It's my first day at Hogwarts, and already something's gone wrong</em></p><p>After what seemed like an hour (but was more in the range of ten minutes) they arrived at a painting of a rather squat knight, who was visibly sleeping on an even squatter pony. The two were practically making the same snoring noise together, and despite all Tom smirked.</p><p>Dumbledore gave Tom a long-suffering look, stated "Erumpent horn”, and rapped the painting. Both knight and horse let out a similar squawk of protest at being caught unawares- ("I never! " harrumphed the knight) but they were then granted access to an entrance-way behind the painting.</p><p>Tom scanned the room before he stepped in behind Dumbledore, a habit of years of hiding out. There wasn't anything in the room that looked dangerous- save a magnificently beaked scarlet bird that roosted above the professor's chair. It appeared to be sleeping. </p><p>"Fawkes, my faithful friend." said Dumbledore fondly. He took a seat in the chair, and waved a hand, a matching chair appearing in front of an oak desk that divided the room. Tom sat.</p><p>"Now,"  asked Dumbledore, as if he had rehearsed this very speech earlier, "you are quite positive you have never known of a sibling?"</p><p>"No sir, " Tom said truthfully, "I was told I was an only child."</p><p>"I see." The professor folded his hands and leaned forward, giving Tom a once-over. " Aside from the... blatantly.. obvious similarities you share, the fact you were both orphans leads me to suspect some tie between you, given your magical heritage. I had the liberty of taking Mr. Riddle's case, and likewise, his file listed him as the sole child of a Merope Riddle. Does that name seem familiar to you?"</p><p>Tom shook his head, fixating on his hands. His guardian had never mentioned his mother's name.</p><p>"I see." said Dumbledore finally. "In that case...." He craned his head up to look at the perched bird.</p><p>"Fawkes, if you would be so kind." The bird, which had been for all intents and purposes asleep, came awake with a high-trill. It flapped scarlet wings in answer, and to Tom's astonishment, it swooped down from its high perch into the dormant fireplace. The fireplace immediately ignited at the birds approach, crackling into a respectable sized flume as the bird returned back to its perch.</p><p>Tom gaped, and Dumbledore winked at him. "Quite clever, phoenixes."</p><p>The professor reached for a small emerald box on the table and had pried it open to reveal a green powder within. He took a handful and gave a searching look to Tom. "You live in Godric's hollow?" asked Dumbledore.</p><p> "Yes." He wondered how he knew that, (Tom certainly hadn't told him) but it was late enough nor was Tom willing to interrogate a professor. "13 Lavenham place." Dumbledore tossed the ashes into the fireplace. Immediately the flames winked green.     </p><p>"Now, we are operating on the assumption your guardian is at home and awake." Dumbledore gestured for Tom to rise as he did, and the two stood parallel to each other in front of the flames. Dumbledore knelt, as did Tom. He wondered what would happen.</p><p>But his thoughts were interrupted as the flames morphed into what was clearly the kitchen of their home. Tom suddenly felt nervous. Suppose his guardian became upset this was all taking place. <em>Well it’s his fault we're in this situation anyway.</em></p><p>"Am I speaking to a Mr. Potter?" asked Dumbledore.</p><p>The room appeared empty and dark, save a small candle that was lit on the table. Tom's stomach fell, as the candle appeared in danger of burning out. It had the look of having been burning for several hours unaccompanied.</p><p>
  <em>So much for all this.</em>
</p><p>"My eyes are not as good as when I was younger, but I am quite confident I see you." Dumbledore said. Tom stared at the professor, and then re-looked. At the corner of the room was a dark shadow. It rustled, then drew forth into the light like a wraith.</p><p>"Professor Dumbledore." the shadow replied.</p><p>Tom realized it was his guardian. He was wrapped in a huge black blanket, which made him look like a large specter. His glasses were on as well, Tom noted.</p><p>"I am glad to make your acquaintance." said Dumbledore, "I do apologize for the lateness of the hour."</p><p>"It is not a problem. “his guardian replied. Tom noticed he wasn't looking directly at Dumbledore, rather, he was fixating on the space near his feet.</p><p>"We have encountered an unusual situation at Hogwarts that I wanted you to be aware of," said Dumbledore. "Your son, Tom, assured me he was an only child, but circumstances have led us to believe that this is not so."</p><p><em>I'm not his son, </em>Tom thought, annoyed.</p><p>"What circumstances?" his guardian replied.</p><p>"To be frank, there is a near identical boy here at Hogwarts named Tom Riddle. Is that name familiar to you?"</p><p>"...It is." confirmed his guardian. Tom's mouth dropped.</p><p>"Can you tell me what he might have in common with Tom Potter?"</p><p>His guardian looked at Tom now, and Tom's face did the talking for him. But his guardian didn't even hesitate, green eyes boring into his own:</p><p>"His father's name was Tom Riddle."</p><p>"Ah!" said Dumbledore. "The very same name as our young Tom."</p><p>Tom blanched. Did that mean he shared his father with Tom Riddle...? That would make him....his brother???</p><p>
  <em>All this time he had a brother and his guardian conveniently forgot to mention it?</em>
</p><p>Professor Dumbledore then leaned back, looking to Tom. "Young Tom Riddle was born as an only child to Merope Riddle, who unfortunately perished at Wool's Orphanage shortly after giving birth to him.  There are no records of a second child, which would be impossible, given that she had died immediately after delivering her son."</p><p>Dumbledore then rose from his kneeling position, idly brushing at his knees from the dust on the ground, "I'm afraid I do not know much about the senior Tom Riddle, but I will certainly have either myself or the headmaster look into it. "</p><p>His guardian then nodded.</p><p>"Was there anything you wanted to say, Mr. Potter?"</p><p>Tom waited for his guardian to respond, but then realized that Professor Dumbledore was referring to him.</p><p>"Er...." Tom hesitated. There was much he wanted to say, but a memory appeared in his mind. <em>We could end up creating the future we are trying to avoid.</em> Tom froze, and he saw his guardian give him the smallest nod.</p><p>"How can I talk to you again?" he blurted.</p><p>Dumbledore chuckled. "I don't suppose you have an owl, Mr. Potter? The school has several that are well-trained for the needs of students. You are more than welcome to use one at any time."</p><p>"Thank you, sir." said Tom, feeling foolish.</p><p>"If that will be all...?" his guardian finalized.</p><p>"I believe so, Mr. Potter. Thank you for your time."</p><p>"Wait!" Tom interrupted.</p><p>Both Dumbledore and his guardian simultaneously looked at him. He blushed, suddenly feeling shy. "Uh..." he looked at his feet, then giving a hesitant look over to his guardian's curious face. "I just wanted to tell you....I'm in Gryffindor."</p><p>His guardian shifted on his feet, shrugging the blanket closer around himself. He looked as if he wanted to say something. But his green eyes only shut for the briefest moment as he replied, "Congratulations."</p><p>"You must be the first to know." said Dumbledore. "I do not believe any owls have reached the homes of students yet. And with that knowledge, I bid you a good evening, Mr. Potter."</p><p>His guardian nodded, and Dumbledore waved his hand, the green fire shifting into red-gold. He sighed, then looking to Tom Potter. "This answers some questions, but creates new ones, I am afraid."</p><p>"...You're telling me." said Tom, who then had to stifle a yawn.</p><p>Dumbledore smiled, patting his shoulder genially. "The hour is quite late, Tom, and I am sure you do not wish to miss your first day of lessons?"</p><p>"No sir!" Tom shook his head vigorously. Dumbledore paused at that.</p><p>"I will pass along a note to your Transfiguration professor that you will be late in the morning." He then motioned for Tom to follow him, and he pushed open the door, letting in a cool breeze from the hallway. "You will need a full night's rest after what has been a rather eventful day."</p><p>"I wouldn't want to be a bother," said Tom hurriedly.</p><p>Dumbledore chuckled. "It is not a bother at all, my dear boy.... because the Transfiguration professor is <em>me</em>."</p><p>Tom stared, and Dumbledore gave him a wink.</p><p><br/> <strong><u>Sources:</u></strong></p><p>
