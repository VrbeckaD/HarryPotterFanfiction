    <p>Everyone by now knows ‘the Boy Who Lived’ the greater mostly unspoken tale of ‘the Girl Who Died Saving Him’ is right out in plain sight for all to see. The tale of two cousins raised strangers shipped out from the same orphanage into two very different lives. One proposition, ‘Join or Die’ left another set of cousins adrift in the world. A daughter without a mother to help guide her and a son cast off into a cynical and cold family more willing to cast out all that cost the aunt’s family to explode in hopes of saving the child left in their care from the darkness haunting him.</p><p>For three years now little Fred and George had been quite a handful, but when near the girl they had claimed as their triplet, sharing their birthday as well, they calmed into a tolerable drizzle from the tornado they triggered when left too long without her. Truly a remarkable child she was, heir to all four founders of the famed Hogwarts and chosen Mistress of the great Black Family Home when all other relatives were cast out or imprisoned. Inside the home were truly a great number of rare thing, mainly for her a long since fabled book on Draconic. It is told Witches and Wizards stemmed from a Man who befriended a Dragon, upon his aging the Dragon gifted him magic in hopes of keeping them bound, always. All four founders stemmed from that man and that book was foretold to be passed down to the heir to reunite all four clans again by blood.</p><p>A mere child with a long since dead language scrawled book packed with magic far beyond any Witch or Wizard alive could muster, magic she shared with her twin brothers. In the body of a Metamorphmagus the child formerly hidden in a cabinet, by a man believed to be a traitor who made a terrible decision on who to save, now remained hidden from sight. A single snapshot taken from an enchanted camera left the only hint of what had become of the child, a giant swirling scar stretching across the left side of her face circulated around the globe with her crying cousin above her bearing a jagged lightning bolt scar. <em>Was she taken, did her body burn up from the spell?</em> No one knows, well, almost no one.</p><p>..</p><p>October 31<sup>st</sup>, the day Fred and George fell silent. Motionless and glum they sat unable to weep anymore as the news exploded into the room over the enchanted radio their brothers  Bill and Charlie were listening to their weekly episode of Chimera vs Sphinx.</p><p>November 1<sup>st</sup>, the anniversary of their parent’s wedding the family all filed down for breakfast slowly. Readying for the day Molly set her tear stained twin sons down on the couch beside her groggy husband with their sleep deprived boys still on his lap unable to sleep from their first nightmares from what they had heard of the events the night before. A knock on the door earned a huff from Molly in her waddle around Percy in his nap on a cushion curled around his pet pig. Through the stained glass she caught a glimpse of the two men outside her door, upon opening, revealed to be Regulus and Remus. With parted lips Molly stood silent eyeing both the sleep deprived men she ushered inside quickly.</p><p>In a turn Remus stated, “I know it is rather early, however,” he shifted his jacket and Molly gasped drawing the room’s attention to the sleeping girl revealed under the outer flap of his jacket tucked against his chest, “We just barely got her to sleep. Had to give her some tonic, but she needs the rest.”</p><p>Regulus held up a vial of a memory of the night before, “They took Sirius, we have to get to the Ministy, show them this, get him back.”</p><p>Remus, “Would you, that is-,”</p><p>Molly’s arms extended and she cradled you to her chest, “You leave her to us. Take all the time you need.” She nodded tearfully after timidly grazing her fingers across the large scar on your face.</p><p>Regulus, “Be careful, it hurts when you touch it.”</p><p>She nodded and Remus gave her a weak smile, “We’ll try to be quick.” And with that they turned and stepped out of the house to the waiting car outside. Leaving Molly to bring you in and tuck you between the twin boys snuggling around you carefully with Bill and Charlie huddled around them settling in for a nap of their own as Molly tearfully curled up against Arthur’s chest in a saddened but joyful embrace for what was left after a night of pain.</p><p>As it goes they did return, without Sirius but with another infant, Neville, another cousin added to the painful mix left to Regulus’ care to keep him from an abusive grandmother. For all the evidence the Ministry would not budge without proof of Peter’s life and off to Azkaban Sirius went. Tuesday rolled around and when Minerva McGonagall had once again set up the usual tea tray in a slew of painful yet hopeful tears of her goddaughter lost to the unknown she froze at the familiar double ring of her doorbell sending her frantically to her front door.</p><p>Tearing it back she drew in a trembling breath shifting aside for Regulus in his step past her inside the home. But it wasn’t until she turned when the door was locked again she let out a giddy shriek clasping her hands over her mouth to hold back her sobs at your popping out from under the enchanted coat to hide your presence underneath with a tin of cookies you had made. Clasped in her arms in a tight hug the tearful Professor joined the small number of trusted allies knowing just where the missing child was.</p><p>.</p><p>What they did not expect was an enchantment that they did not produce. Charlieazse "Chuck" Lupin, the daughter Remus had fathered from a mystery muggleborn who had sent her to him in her hope for their safety in the current attacks on their kin by the fleeing Death Eaters. A story easily bought with his frequent travels and loss of interest in exploring it further the tattered nerves of the Aurors he worked with all broken hearted over the losses racking up by the day. So the red headed girl with shockingly pale blue eyes slipped in easily with the clearly broken hearted twins filling the void others had felt in Sirius Black’s missing daughter.</p><p>…</p><p>Months had passed and as usual Regulus was off on another of his ‘scouting missions’ though this time when your eyes shot open and you jolted upright in bed the panicked house elf you had dubbed K, for your distaste of using his given name, appeared on your bed as you whispered “Regulus.” In what he had hoped to be a secret mission he had unknowingly fallen into a death trap, but with a snap of your fingers your uncle frantically rolled towards the cup of water on the bedside table.</p><p>Before he could touch it the water vanished, in your shocked frenzy you gripped his hair and held your palm over his open mouth speaking the draconic word for water easing his frenzy as he drank from the stream of water shooting out of your palm. Until his body relaxed fully you held the charm, dropping it and granting him a moments peace before you filled the glass of water again by sliding your finger around the rim of the glass and gave it to him. Refilling it until he curled up with you in bed after passing something off to K for him to hide in his room.</p><p>.</p><p>For years you were kept in hiding, thanks to a rarely used talent for morphing from your mother, none suspected who you were. Though in the bickering between Regulus and Remus over your care another rumor was born and the men had to play house feigning a tumultuous, yet far from physically threatening relationship, easing any possible harm for the children, just a butting of wills often silenced by Minerva in her claiming the little ones for her own time with them. Under her care none challenged her claim on who they were, and none especially dared ask your small family as to the whereabouts of Sirius.</p><p>Though if they had it wouldn’t be hard to learn a single enchanted note written in chalk gave him the clue he needed when you were four. A single paw print inside a palm parted his lips as he shivered shifting into his unknown dog form under the cover of darkness then trotted his way out of the prison, finding a shimmering mushroom statue outside. A hidden portkey, transferring him to the undiscoverable Black Family Home. And it especially wouldn’t be hard to discover the ever so friendly Artemis Lupin, the shaggy haired damn near identical cousin of Remus, now working in Sirius’ old position, was actually the assumed murderer under a draconic mirroring spell enforced by a marking having to be burned into the skin over two of his toes available to him whenever needed.</p><p>So in hiding your family grew and in the library of your protected home, enchanted to make a copy of all books ever created, you learned the secrets of the world your darkening dreams somehow knew you would need use of one day. Though in that library you learned something about your faithful house elf K, the enslavement of his race, in his tattered pillow case of a uniform you sat up tearfully wondering what you should do until an idea popped into your head. Through the hall you raced on Christmas Eve for the trunk of old clothes from your hundreds of deceased relatives. You dug until you found what you needed. A full dress suit for a child, complete with shorts and the Black Family Crest on the jacket, buttons and vest. Back to your room you raced, shrinking the suit when you got there using a spell from your book then you huddled back under the covers between the twins who snuggled around you again.</p><p>Pure fear spread across Kreacher’s face when he opened the box until your hands claimed his and you smiled at him assuring him that he was a part of this family and should wear the crest proudly. That alone seemed to deage the elf nearly a decade when he smiled and turned to eagerly try on the clothes his Mistress had gifted him he wore proudly each day since, in varying colors for the seasons and various occasions. A gesture signaling the first in a long line of stunningly kind gestures from you to those most would turn from.</p><p>…</p><p>At ten, on the cusp of eleven, you struggled with the physical changes your body was experiencing bringing up an ache for the mother you had lost you were now resembling more by the day. Wetting your lips you searched your library finding a record log of the muggle adoption agency your mother had been adopted from, though furrowing your brows you mumbled to the twins, “The Gaunts.” They leaned in around you reading Morfin Gaunt as the father.</p><p>Fred pointed to the older log from the same agency he had just read through, recognizing the name, “Here, another Gaunt!”</p><p>George, “They could be siblings.”</p><p>Softly you mumbled, “I could have an uncle..”</p><p>Both, “Another one.” Making you giggle and copy down the dates and address they both were handed over from by their parents before you called K.</p><p>“K.” He arrived with a smile and offered you his hand upon request zapping you three and your pocket journals into the outskirts of the muggle town in front of a worn down cottage with a trio of headstones around a statue of a snake around Slytherin’s crest. “Marvolo, Morfin and Merope.”</p><p>The twins joined you in searching around the cottage, until K said, “Master Regulus is calling for you Mistress.”</p><p>Wetting your lips you stated, “Just, bring him here please. We can’t leave now.”</p><p>K nodded and did just that, leaving you confused Uncle to duck out of sight from a passing muggle policeman to your side whispering, “What are you doing?”</p><p>Glancing back you said, “I found Mom’s orphanage, their records say she has a cousin.” Your grins dropped as his curious grin dropped and he nodded wetting his lips to say, “I know who her cousin is.” He reached in his jacket pocket pulling out a journal he opened and passed to you, “Your mum wanted me to give you this when you were curious about her family. I’ve been trying to find the right time to give it to you.” His hand enveloped yours and he added, “We all have family who have done terrible things. Just know we have relatives who have done so much good as well. Your Mum being one of them.”</p><p>You nodded and eyed the family tree written in your mother’s handwriting, “The Gaunt line traces all the way back to Salazaar Slytherin. When your Mum was in school she wanted to know where she came from, so we’d sneak out to help her. Merope Gaunt’s son was conceived by using a love potion on a muggle, Tom Riddle. She named their son after him and when she imagined him to truly love her she stopped giving him the potions. He obviously fled from her and she died shortly after, her father wanted nothing to do with the half muggle.” He wet his lips, “We traced him back to Hogwarts,” slowly he finished with, “Where he formed a new name for himself as the Dark Lord.”</p><p>Your lips parted then you mumbled, “That’s why he kept asking her to join him. He kept saying family.”</p><p>Regulus avoided his questions knowing you had enough nightmares about that encounter then wet his lips to say, “We should go, if you’re done exploring.”</p><p>You shook your head, “No. I have to be here. I can feel something.” Regulus’ eyes narrowed, “Something pulsing inside.”</p><p>Fred and George nodded then asked K, “Could you get us in?”</p><p>He nodded and aparated you inside with a grin then followed after you, scowling at the dust threatening to spoil his clothes. Starting in the dining room you searched all the drawers until a hexed cupboard opened slamming into Regulus knocking him to the ground only to have the floorboards bend up to whack at him. With a giggle you led the boys inside waving your hand stating a draconic spell to stop.</p><p>George, “Looks like you found us something.”</p><p>Regulus groaned climbing to his feet nodding his head sarcastically, “Oh really, what gave it away?”</p><p>You rolled your eyes then peered inside the cupboard finding the pulsing box, “This, this is it.” You carried it to the table and opened it revealing the ring inside. “What type of curse is this. Shielding obviously.”</p><p>Fred, “Mood altering whiff to it too.”</p><p>George, “Serious beserker defenses too.”</p><p>Regulus chuckled, “Oh Hogwarts is going to love you.” You grinned up at him and he claimed the journal from you then flipped to the back, “When I was a member of his followers I learned of a secret of Riddle’s. He hid items laced with pieces of his soul that made it so he couldn’t die. Now, I found a locket, on the day you brought me to your bed, when I was thirsty, remember?”</p><p>You nodded, “I remember.”</p><p>“Well, I can’t figure out how to destroy it, I’ve tried so many spells, but we have to find them and hide them until we can destroy them.”</p><p>You nodded and flashed him a grin, “Well, clearly we’re good at sleuthing.” Against his better judgment clearly you’d gotten this far on your own and he sighed then nodded.</p><p>Regulus, “There is one thing. That fearful memory trick you have from touching people, where you see their biggest secrets-. No matter what your Mum couldn’t get any sort of memories from one of his favorite Professors. He lives a county over. If you’ve got time for some tea…”</p><p>You nodded and grinned sending K home with the ring as Regulus aparated you all outside an apparently pillaged home you curiously followed Regulus inside after confirming your hair was still bright green with pale blue eyes to appear as Chuck. Publicly attributed to the mood charm on the ring on your finger changing your hair color with it to blame the natural color changes on something more believable to protect your identity, identical to the rings the twins bore with the true enchantment on them to maintain your triplet title holding their hair in a bright blue. Matching the one given to Harry to disguise him after convincing the Dursleys to send him to a distant boarding school, living as your baby brother Charlus Lupin.</p><p>.</p><p>A knock on the cracked front door came from Regulus before he closed it behind you three then guided you inside calling out, “Professor. It’s Regulus, Black. I was in town..”</p><p>In the corner of the room your eyes turned to the armchair with pink and white stripes making you poke Regulus then nod your head its way making him smirk then say, “I see you’ve perfected your shielding spell. Though the muggles don’t add q’s to the end of their company names as we do.” Talking about the brand on the golden plaque on the wooden front foot that shifted as the chair rippled after Regulus said, “Look, I’ve brought kids with me. I’m not going to hurt you. Thought you might enjoy some tea.”</p><p>In a full body shiver Horace Slughorn appeared shifting back sheepishly grinning at you all before Regulus waved his wand repairing the room while K popped up with a full tea tray he set up on the table. Moving closer Regulus shook the Professor’s hand, “Good to see you again. This is Fred and George.” He paused giving him time to shake each of their hands before saying, “And Chuck Lupin.”</p><p>Horace grinned shaking your hand missing the flash of silver in your eyes as your mind linked with his out of habit showing you his biggest fear. A hidden memory of him speaking with Riddle, before your eyes flashed back to the stunningly blue shade as you smiled up at him making him pause with a saddened expression flashing on his face, “Oh.”</p><p>Your smile dimmed and you glanced up at Regulus, “Something on my face?”</p><p>Horace shook his head, “No, my dear. That is. You remind me of someone.” Even in your altering your facial structure to be more squared with a pronounced brow and bulbous nose he could still see the small features linking you to your mother and his prized pupil Lily, who your mother shifted to be identical to since her adoption to fit in the family better. </p><p>He smiled again patting your hand kindly, “It is a pleasure to meet you. Remus, well he wasn’t my best student, no, but he did above adequate on his Newts. Had quite a passion for healing tonics, imagined him to take a job at St Mungo’s possibly, but, to each his own, followed the gang into the Aurors.” He peered up at Regulus, “Not that there’s anything wrong with that my boy. I hear you’ve done wondrous things with snake venoms.”</p><p>You all sat around the table when he finally released your hand as Regulus said, “That, partly is to do with these three here. Chuck is quite skilled with snakes, and we’ve found a great number of tricks on forming anti-venoms and studying the possible effects of the venoms.”</p><p>Horace’s face lit up and he smiled at you three, “Ah. I see not so far form the old tree I see. Why, if I were still teaching you would have seats in my club. Only the best got invites to my dinner parties.” He said with a wink at you then delved into more tales of your Uncle and the Maurauders.</p><p>…</p><p>Back in the Black Family home you led the trio into your room where you whispered to Regulus, “He asked the Professor about Horcruxes.” Regulus nodded, “And he mentioned seven. Not what they were, just had an interest in having seven.”</p><p>Regulus sighed, “Seven.” Sitting on your bed, “We have two…What else could they be…”</p><p>You wet your lips then sat around him with hopeful smiles, “We’ll find them. Maybe in Hogwarts I could tap into more hidden memories, find some of his plans.”</p><p>He nodded, “I know something.” He led you into your dad’s room from school he no longer slept in, knowing he was at work still, then brought out a trunk from the closet he opened a secret pocket on the outside to pass you a trio of maps. “These, the guys made them, you tap them with your wands say ‘I solemnly swear I am up to no good’ and it shows you all the secret pathways and where everyone is. You can easily find a way into the Slytherin dorms or any other hide outs he might have had.”</p><p>Grins spread on your faces and you each took one for yourselves then went to hide the maps along with your copy of the first year book list, second hand from the collection from your relatives years prior. Books you and the twins had mostly memorized through the years in your blossoming plans to set up your own joke shop in the future. The call of your names from Molly for lunch drew you all downstairs as Regulus warned you that Sirius and Remus assumed he’d given up the search when your mother died.</p><p>…</p><p>Subtly as the year had began your impatience grew with the recent string of attacks on muggle towns your father’s name had been mentioned for blame once again. In a fit of rage you hand slammed down on a stack of blank pages mentally murmuring a Draconic spell lacing the memory of your mother being tortured in thousands upon thousands of howlers vanishing then flooding through the Ministry. Straight to each desk before they all tore apart showing the memory of what happened to your mother, aunt, uncle and Pettigrew after before in what the older auror’s took as your mother’s voice, echoed out, <em>“This is your final warning! Exonerate Sirius Black or the Wizarding World will see just what a Coward Cornelious Fudge truly is!”</em> At once they all burst into flames leaving the building in sheer shuddering silence before eyes turned to the stunned Minister in question on his way to lunch.</p><p>Sure enough by the time he reached his table the flash release of the Daily Prophet were already flooding out through the world. Recounting the memories clearly proving his innocence and by the time Sirius got home it was all over the press that Fudge had followed the warning and cleared his name by typing up a single paged apology stating he would be welcomed back to his old position whenever he was ready to come out of hiding. Though at the suspicion of a trap he remained Remus’ cousin hearing whispers of said trap each day less and less as Fudge settled into a false comfort that he did not have to encounter the man he had falsely imprisoned. But with it came rumors that you and your mother might have lived and were in hiding as well stirring a much needed hope.</p><p>…</p><p>April 1<sup>st</sup> brought out the usual celebration at the Weasley home being prepped for that night, however that morning you joined Artemis and Arthur in escorting you and the twins to Gringotts to sign for your first vaults after the shrieking filled bouts of hugs you claimed and received after receiving your Hogwarts letters. Through the streets you had heard word rippling through the streets of your letter being confirmed as sent by Dumbledore the week before. Nods were sent your way in the early morning stop at Gringotts. The doors were still locked to the public yet as you reached the top steps the small door inside the larger one opened revealing a stern Goblin who croaked out, “We are locked till 9am.”</p><p>Your father nodded then patted your shoulder, grinning that you were shifting your appearance under the bolero hat you were wearing, “Alright. The Weasley boys and Miss Black will wait then.”</p><p>His brow ticked up, “Black?”</p><p>Your father nodded, “Aye.”</p><p>The goblin’s lips parted and he stepped through the smaller door he sealed again then cracked the larger one for you to slip inside, “Hurry.” Behind you he sealed it and then guided you to the seemingly endless row of counters while the head goblin stared him down until he looked up at you when you eased off your hat freeing sight of your pitch black curls and a portion of your scarred jaw under your tightly curled bangs hanging over your face. With the green to purple shifting eyes that gave you away upon first glance. Eagerly he set out your papers on the counter before him and knocked the lever on his side freeing a set of steps to help you reach the counter, “Jaqiearae Suzsieanne Anistasiea Pluto Black, welcome to Gringotts. We are pleased to see you. Do you have your key?”</p><p>Sirius handed you the key you held up for the goblin as the twins were guided signing for their vault as Arthur grinned behind them. With papers signed agreeing to the fees you were led down out of the room into a set of halls leading to the carts that would carry you out to your vaults. Squeezing in together you all stopped at their vault first seeing the amounts Arthur had been depositing for them from payments for small potions and trinkets bartered to Ministry workers.</p><p>Another jolting ride later down a winding rollercoaster path of tracks you clung to your shielded father’s arm until the cart jolted shut again. Shakily you stepped out of the cart, thankful to have chosen to wear your shorts over the skirt Molly had bought you at the height between the cart and the ledge. Smoothing your layered sheer floral tank top over your middle you wet your lips joining the boys timidly through the dim hall wondering what the clacker the goblin had picked up was for.</p><p>Though a sharp gasp from you came as you saw the scarred, blinded and terrified Antipodean Opaleye. Beside you the goblin stated smugly, “No need to fear. We’ve mastered the beast.”</p><p>At your lip quivering up at the coiling dragon your father placed his hand on your back guiding you along as the boys softly mumbled to each other and you in latin. Softly as the boys caused a diversion you managed to slip back into the corridor getting just barely ten feet from her to say in draconic, <strong><em>“I swear to you I will get you out of here. Grant me a day or so to plan. I swear you will be free.”</em></strong> Silently her head turned blindly in your direction memorizing your scent lingering behind as you went back to the group flashing your key, “Found it.”</p><p>The goblin grinned then led you straight to the vault marked ‘Gaunt’ they opened for you revealing a sea of gold making you let out a stunned squeak in your walk into it. Peering around you eyed the crystal casings holding sorted galleons, knuts and sickles near the front. After drawing out an enchanted coin purse you grabbed three of each kind of coin you slipped inside subtly then slipped out again to pass the dragon again. The act almost making you cry as her head followed your scent hearing your muttered repeated promise as one of the chain charms from your pocket was subtly dropped and it rolled silently over to her wrapping around her foot blending in with her scales marking her location for you for later.</p><p>.</p><p>Wands and shops later, though thankfully less expensive at your trio being so willing to use the supplies already at home to save money for your parents you made your way through the fleu system to the Weasley home, through which you called the enchanted door to your home to head to the library to begin researching. Way back in the depths of the library while Fred and George went to look over your supply of ingredients for the spell you had found your head turned when a flash of blonde hair came into view turning your head.</p><p>Since the previous summer when you and the twins had set up a prank meant for Percy Charlie had proudly borne the blonde locks the prank had unleashed upon him after bumping into it, as to calm his mother on punishment, feigning a desire to try out the style for a time. The year he held it simply added to the lack of necessity in having to switch back, though at Arthur’s wish you would have to switch it back for Christmas photos this year as the whole clan was sending out family photos and eager to see the full brood in their signature matching red locks.</p><p>Those bright blue eyes of his hit you and you flashed him a timid smile as he leaned over your shoulder then purred what he read, “Just what are you planning on transporting?”</p><p>“Just-,”</p><p>He shook his head, “On second thought, I’d rather not know, easier for the explanations after.” His eyes lowered to your lips and he inched closer trailing a finger along the underside of your jaw, “You planning on spending your whole birthday back here surrounded by books?”</p><p>Chastely his lips pressed to yours signaling your enchanted camera snapping a picture of the occasion a hand quickly snatched out of his reach bringing Bill into view with a wide grin, “Ooh, cozy spot.” He shook the photo making you blush and walk around the pair to sneak away as Charlie started bickering with him a the duplicating photo soaring off to hide in random places in the house.</p><p>At the table in the Weasley home you sat crossing your ankles leaving the book on your lap ignoring the brothers when they entered, hoping that they wouldn’t say anything as the twins shared the supplies you had between glances at Charlie, who was openly staring at you with a puzzling look on his face. Cake was had after the dinner, another of Molly’s gravity defying marvels, when at the finishing of them, you were freed to head back to your rooms for the night leaving Charlie groaning at the fact he would have to wait to talk to you until later.</p><p>.</p><p>Once again you were torn from your dreams with a gasp before, in your oversized button down shirt stolen from your dad’s old room over shorts and your socks you raced through the hall straight to Regulus’ room, sliding through the door to hop onto the bed. On your knees beside him you grinned as he blinked your purple eyes into focus as they flashed to green in your eyes following is hand to light his lamp by the bed, “I found another one.”</p><p>He sat up instantly asking, “Where?”</p><p>“A muggle zoo. It’s a snake.”</p><p>He parted his lips then closed them and groaned climbing out of bed, rubbing his face in his move to find and tug on a pair of jeans and a shirt mumbling, “At least muggle zoos aren’t as protected as enchanted lakes.” Making you raise your brow then catch his eye when he said, “Go grab some shoes at least. I’m not man handling that snake alone.”</p><p>You giggled and went to find your boots you hopped into. Then found his side again as your long braid fell over your chest again making him chuckle and wrap his arm around your back to aparate to the zoo you had shared the location with him mentally once you had both added the enchanted masks he summoned form his wardrobe to deal with the muggle cameras.</p><p>.</p><p>Along a snake filled hall of habitats you giggled nipping at your lip whispering in Parseltongue, <em>“Aren’t you a beauty</em>.” Making the snake in question raise her head. Carefully Regulus summoned a bubble charm drawing the snake inside of the shimmering bubble you aparated back home with to add her to the snake habitats you had back home. Though as you set the mouse in the case your eyes turned silver matching your hair making you turn to Regulus and his already spreading grin.</p><p>“You found another?”</p><p>You nodded, “Though, it’ll be tricky. It’s in Gringotts.”</p><p>K was called for and with a change of clothes and a powerful draconic masking spell from you, you and Regulus appeared to be Bellatrix and her husband Rudolphus as you zapped yourselves back into the lowest levels of the bank. Swirling your fingers summoning a copy of their key for the bank vault forming in your hand in solid diamonds.</p><p>Through the pillars you crept whispering, <strong><em>“It’s just me.” </em></strong>Instantly her head inched higher and eagerly she crept out of her shadowed corner glancing around until she caught your scent and your location. <strong><em>“I have to peek into my vault real quick, then we can go. Can you warn me if anyone shows up, please?”</em></strong></p><p>Softly she replied, <strong><em>“Of course.”</em></strong></p><p>With a grin you nodded to Regulus then nudged him along back towards your vault, for the hiding bat shaped recorders along the ceiling doing all you could to imitate your aunt and remain calm and sure in your motions until you reached the Lestrange vault. Wetting your lips you opened it and stepped inside and wet your lips peering around, “Now, it’s a goblet.”</p><p>Struggling against the painful pinching heeled boots and tight dress hugging you down to your knees tightly with just a bit of budge room on your lower legs you quickened your pace then grinned. Pointing into the distance at a rather unassuming goblet you tucked into a bubble charm and set home in your giddy trot out again making Regulus chuckle softly and set this hand on your back.</p><p>The vault was closed behind you and you peeked around the corner again out to peer up at her in her curious head tilt, <strong><em>“This is a bit of an uncomfortable request, but I need to shrink you to get you out. I can return you to your full size after we are at my home.”</em></strong></p><p>For a moment she paused then nodded and inhaled sharply. As you waved your glowing hand in the air sending a orange mist around her that dissipated revealing the puppy sized dragon you walked closer to making her flinch with your each heeled step until you leaned forward gently scooping her up out of the mess of giant chains whispering, <strong><em>“I won’t hurt you.”</em></strong> Unsteadily in your arms she laid flat swallowing dryly coiling her tail around your arm to steady herself as her clawed hands clung to your skin, pressing a bit firmer than she would have normally as if to remind you even blind she could do some damage to you. Back by Regulus you settled under his arm to zap back home again and dropped your disguises.</p><p>There in the comfort of the grand sitting room with a view of the mountains and plains your home was hidden in with a brief glimpse of the small quidditch hoops in the distance past the gardens and fountain maze. A soft utterance from you faded your left eye to white and hers to your usual purple to green flashing eye making her inch up to look around the vast lands your home claimed and the night sky making her scales shimmer dully.</p><p>At your voice she flinched then peered up at you to see the face of the woman she owed her freedom to. <strong><em>“As soon as I can I’ll find a potion or something to heal your eyes and scars. First I think we might be able to scrub your scales up a bit. Bring back some more of your shimmer.”</em></strong></p><p>She nodded and you gave her a brief tour of your home on the way to your tub with Regulus, as you walked you could feel her stealing glances up at the scars on your face. The porcelain tub had a warm layer of water you carefully lowered her into making her smile and chuckle walking in a circle enjoying the feel of the water. As you knelt on the cushioned stool Regulus slid out of the towel closet for you as he sat on the edge of the tub chuckling himself as he passed you the soap and a soft cloth. Carefully you helped her clean her scales leaving her a pale white when you held her on a deep emerald towel patting her dry. Freshly scrubbed she let out a deep yawn and you chuckled, <strong><em>“You can stay in my room tonight.”</em></strong></p><p>With a peck on the forehead from Regulus she watched you grin through the half hug offered while you traded goodnights with your uncle on your path to your separate rooms. The deep purple and grey room with mahogany paneling along the lower half of the walls matching the mantle around your fireplace across from the large four poster canopied bed. Gently you left her on one of your pillows then went to your closet to change into father’s shirt and shorts again. A flick of your fingers relit the fire in the fireplace as you made your way back to settle onto the plushy bed under the covers smiling as you said, <strong><em>“Goodnight.”</em></strong></p><p>Softly she asked making you open your sighted eye, <strong><em>“What are you called?”</em></strong></p><p>You smiled and propped up on your elbow, <strong><em>“Forgive me, how rude. I’m Jaqiearae but most call me Jaqi. What are you called?”</em></strong></p><p>She shifted uncomfortably curling her talons around the hem on the edge of her pillow, <strong><em>“I was taken from my nest as an egg. Those small creatures in the bank called me Beast.”</em></strong></p><p>You shook your head and you reached over shifting the corner of the blanket higher on her back, <strong><em>“You are not a beast.” </em></strong>Wetting your lips you paused, <strong><em>“What about Opal?”</em></strong></p><p>A hint of a grin spread on her face and she nodded, <strong><em>“Opal. I like it.”</em></strong></p><p>You chuckled then settled down again as she did contently, <strong><em>“Goodnight Opal.”</em></strong></p><p>
  <strong>
    <em>“Goodnight Jaqi.”</em>
  </strong>
</p><p>..</p><p>Breakfast rolled around and as you sat at the table eating the pancakes Regulus had fixed up you grinned at your father with packed cheeks earning a chuckle from him, “Morning Pumpkin.”</p><p>His hand patted on your shoulder in his path to his chair, though in his move to thank Regulus his eyes moved to the flash of white past the open window making Remus lean in behind you taking in the sight of the Opaleye giddily collapsing between small burst of flight before scrambling up to try again. Inhaling slowly Sirius moved his hand to collect his cup of coffee then glanced at Regulus who grinned at him.</p><p>Sirius, “Thank you Regulus.” He wet his lips picking up his fork while Remus sat in his chair still watching the dragon curiously, “Um, Pumpkin?” Your eyes met his and he caught sight of your white eye revealing your link to the dragon outside, “I hate to limit the explorations of our new tenant, however, Remus and I have a dinner with my supervisor tonight. So, could you convince,”</p><p>“Opal.”</p><p>He nodded, “Opal, to, nap, or something through the dinner?”</p><p>You nodded, “Sure thing.”</p><p>He glanced up at her again and to you again then chuckled starting on his breakfast unable to say anything about your thievery as he’d done his own mischief in school and your mother wasn’t much better, always plotting and planning, a stunning trait for a Ravenclaw. But it was what they bonded over, always plotting together for the next big scheme, his partner in crime and the one helping to reign in his fiery temper. And as painful as it was by the day you grew more like him while bearing her face. He would have preferred you to be more like her but he was endlessly amused that his precious little girl had such a wild streak in her fueling her path to make the world shudder.</p>
