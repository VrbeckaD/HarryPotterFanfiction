    <p align="left">“Oh, Sevvy! Don’t tell me you’re in love with me, or something!” Lily playfully punched his arm, an action she expected him to return in kind—and stilled when he did not. Severus simply looked down at the floor and scowled instead, his pale face soon turning about as red as her hair.</p><p align="left">“And so what if I was?!” Severus wailed, trying his best to sound tough, and managing to sound half his actual age in the process. Lily gasped, curiously looking only half as shocked as he thought she’d be.</p><p align="left">“Oh, Severus…!” He flinched at that. It was never a good sign when she bothered to use the rest of his name. “I don’t know…I mean, we’re still so young—”</p><p align="left">“That doesn’t matter!” Snape protested, cheeks growing hotter. “I have it all planned out, already! All <em>you</em> have to do is say yes.”</p><p align="left">“Say yes to what?” Lily cocked her head to the side, a rare frown making its way onto her soft features. Snape sighed. What little patience he had left was wearing thin.</p><p align="left">“To being m-my g-girlfriend, of course.” Severus cursed under his breath—all those weeks of practicing in front of the mirror, and still, he managed to flub the most important line! Now she’d never say yes! Tears threatened to prick at his eyes before he willed them back, not wanting to embarrass himself in front of the love of his life any further.</p><p align="left">After a short, thoughtful moment, Snape jumped at the foreign warmth of Lily’s hand on his shoulder, gently squeezing.</p><p align="left">“I’m sorry, Severus. I can’t say yes now.” She didn’t have to say anymore - the young, heartbroken boy had already heard enough. Before he could turn on his heel to leave, Lily grabbed his arm to stop him. Snape tried not to look too happy about it. He tried to hide the awkward, crooked smile forming on his face. He truly, honestly did.</p><p align="left">“But maybe -” She started up again, innocent and clueless to the amount of suffering her following words would cause in the years to come.</p><p align="left">“Maybe one day, when we’re older.”</p>
