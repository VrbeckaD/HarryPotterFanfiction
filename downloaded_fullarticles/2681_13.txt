    <p>One. The wand breaks.</p>
<p>Two. The wind howls.</p>
<p>Three. The blood pours.</p>
<p>Four. The manic laughs.</p>
<p>Five. The girl screams.</p>
<p>Six. A spell hits her.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Everything is black.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>….………..</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The girl wakes. The nightmare isn’t just in her head. It surrounds her fully. Tearing into her. Ripping into her skin. The black is everywhere. The darkness is all she has.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>….………</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It hurts like hell. It’s too much for her soul alone. She can’t escape the darkness.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>….……</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>And if you’re still breathing, you’re the lucky ones</em>. But she doesn’t feel lucky. Shadows settle in her mind. Her mind is quieted by the emptiness. The darkness. She heaves through corrupted lungs. <em>And if you're still bleeding, you're the lucky ones. </em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>….…….</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Well, I've lost it all,</p>
<p>I'm just a silhouette</p>
<p>I'm a lifeless face that you'll soon forget</p>
<p>Setting fire to our insides for fun</p>
<p>To distract our hearts from ever missing them</p>
<p>But I'm forever missing him”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The girl sings out to the darkness.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>….……….</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Father tell me, we get what we deserve</p>
<p>Oh we get what we deserve</p>
<p>And way down we go</p>
<p>Way down we go</p>
<p>Say way down we go</p>
<p>Way down we go</p>
<p>You let your feet run wild</p>
<p>Time has come as we all oh, go down</p>
<p>Yeah but for the fall oh, my</p>
<p>Do you dare to look him right in the eyes?</p>
<p>'Cause they will run you down, down til the dark</p>
<p>Yes and they will run you down, down til you fall</p>
<p>And they will run you down, down til you go</p>
<p>Yeah so you can't crawl no more</p>
<p>And way down we go</p>
<p>Way down we go</p>
<p>Say way down we go</p>
<p>'Cause they will run you down, down til you fall</p>
<p>Way down we go”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The girl sings and sings. Anything to chase away the darkness. Her voice is raw. Her throat contracts as she sheds tears. Anything to chase away the darkness.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>….………….</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A door opens. Someone drags her up off the cold floor.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Time to meet The Dark Lord mudblood”, a voice whispers in her ear.</p>
