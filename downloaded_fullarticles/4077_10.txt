    <p>"... Potter?" </p><p>Harry looked up from the issue of the <em>Daily Prophet</em> he was reading at the sound of his name. He smiled, thinking it was his healer calling him back, but it wasn't. </p><p>His green eyes looked up to meet the stormy blue eyes of none other than Draco Malfoy, standing a few feet away in shock. </p><p>When was the last time he saw the blond? <em>'Oh',</em> Harry thought,<em> 'It was that ministry ball last spring.' </em></p><p>Harry gave him a smile, "What's with that reaction?" Harry asked, "I know it hasn't been <em>that</em> long since we last saw each other." </p><p>Draco slowly made his way over to where Harry was sitting in the waiting room, almost as if he was approaching a small animal. He couldn't believe what he was seeing. Harry, he looked otherworldly, absolutely beautiful, and the emotion that came with that realization startled Draco. </p><p>"I-I didn't expect to see you here," He cleared his throat, "Seeing as you look like you're about to give birth right there in that chair." </p><p>Harry blushed and laughed lightly, "I look like that, don't I? But I'm actually due in only two weeks, so you don't have to worry about that... Hopefully. She has been rather rowdy the past few days." </p><p>"I didn't know..." It was a sight to see right now, Slytherin's Ice Prince at a loss for words. It was quite refreshing. </p><p>"Didn't know what?" Harry asked in confusion, but suddenly understood what he was referring to, "Oh! Well, it is informal to tell just anyone what your secondary gender is, but since this is a professional environment, as well as the fact you are the colleague of my healer, I suppose we can let societal rules slide for once. I'm an omega, obviously." </p><p><em>'Obviously not!' </em>Draco thought. </p><p>"I didn't know, I thought Ginny carried the kids." Draco blurted, and this time he was the one to flush. </p><p>Harry shook his head as a rather fond gesture, "She was the alpha in our relationship, and that means her fertility rate in carrying kids is very low. Plus, since I was the one who wanted kids, she refused to carry them anyways and made me, not that I minded. Being pregnant would have gotten in the way of her quidditch practices and games." </p><p>Draco nodded knowingly, "Oh, well I hope all is well, with your pregnancy and everything." He commented to stay somewhat professional with his former enemy. </p><p>"Thank you, I appreciate that," Harry said with another smile. </p><p>Just then, Harry's healer walked up to the two, "Harry, it's good to see you! Goodness, you're absolutely glowing!" He praised, helping Harry as he made a move to stand. </p><p>"Thank you, it's good to see you too," Harry replied, both thanking him for the compliment and helping him stand. </p><p>"I wasn't aware you were on familiar terms with Draco here," He commented, shifting his eyes between Harry and the blond. </p><p>"We went to school together," Harry filled in, "But it's been a while since I've last seen Draco. I was telling him about Ginny and I." </p><p>The healer hummed in acknowledgment, "I see, how has that been going? Has everything been finalized yet?" </p><p>Harry didn't take his eyes away from Eden as he spoke, "Yes they have, but uh, I'm not quite comfortable letting that detail being known to everyone yet." Harry said quietly even though he knew Draco could hear him. </p><p>"Ah understandable, let's get you back to a room to start the ultrasound." He turned his attention to Draco, "I hope you're doing well Draco, I'll see you later." </p><p>Harry repeated the departing greeting as he let Healer Eden escort him by his arm, and disappeared from Draco's sight. </p><p>Though his curiosity was peaked from the way Harry phrased his statement, he let it go for the time being. He was still working himself. </p><p>-- </p><p>"So, now that we are in the privacy of my office," Eden started, "How have you really been Harry? I hope you're not stressing yourself too much over everything that has happened the past few months." </p><p>Harry still had a smile on his face, but it was noticeably tired now, "Everything has been going well. The divorce was finalized a few weeks ago, and me and the boys are already moved in to that cottage I was telling you about in southern Wiltshire." </p><p>"That's all good to hear, how are the boys by the way?" He asked as he motioned for Harry to remove his shirt and get on the examination bed. </p><p>"Wonderful, actually. They took the news that they wouldn't be seeing mommy as often better that I thought. They were more worried if they could still see Uncle George than anyone else." Harry giggled softly to himself at the memory. </p><p>Eden hummed at the comment, smiling to himself as he helped Harry lay back on the bed, "Also, may I ask why Draco seemed off when you were speaking to him?" </p><p>Harry laughed again, "Of course, I think we've known each other long enough for you to ask about anything really. You did help me give birth to all my kids so far." </p><p>Eden chuckled and nodded, "I suppose you're right." </p><p>"Draco was shocked because he never knew I was an omega, and he never knew I was the one who carried the kids." He said simply. </p><p>"Even though the two of you went to school together?" </p><p>"Yeah. As soon as I presented, I wore scent blockers and told everyone I was a beta. Only my best and closest friends, my godfather, and the headmaster knew my true gender. I was told too because the Dark Lord was out to kill me at every turn that it would be safer if no one knew." </p><p>"That is understandable. Anyways, you ready for the scan? Like always, you will feel the warmth of my magic, but it will not affect you nor the little lady growing inside you right now." Eden said as he readied his wand to cast the scan. </p><p>"Yep, I'm always excited to see her," Harry said, starting to get giddy as he waited to see the familiar blue wave of the spell. </p><p>Eden cast the scanning spell, letting a screen pop up to show Harry how well his baby was developing, as well as a list of diagnostics appeared in his hand. </p><p>Harry watched the screen in amazement, always loving these appointments. He saw her clear as day and hopefully healthy. He reached out towards the screen, but just like every other time, his hand slipping through the image and fuzzed around his hand. </p><p>"Well Harry, everything seems to be coming along nicely. Both you and your baby girl are in top shape and healthy through and through. But, this may come as good and bad news," Harry's heart sunk and the healer's vague tone, "Your baby seems to be finished growing, and you could see an early birth for her." </p><p>Harry let out a breath he didn't know he was holding in, "Oh thank Merlin, I thought you were going to say something really really bad," Harry laughed, "But that is good news! You know where the wizard hospital is in Wiltshire, correct? Just in-case I can't make it here in time," Harry said now with a blindingly bright smile. </p><p>"Yes I do, and no worries! Everything will be fine, no matter she is born tomorrow or in two weeks time." Eden said with a smile of his own, "How are your glands doing? Have you started lactating yet?" </p><p>"I haven't had any leakage, but they've swelled and are kind of tender right now," Harry said as he poked his chest to see if they were still tender or not. They were this morning. </p><p>"That's normal, I'm sure you'll start lactating soon because of her development." He said with a smile, "Have you thought of a name by now? You said you were unsure last time." </p><p>"I only said that because Ginny didn't look pleased when I mentioned what I wished to name her. But now, since she gave up all custody of our kids, I will name her what I want. I like Lily Luna Jane Potter. It's a bit long, but it honors the three most brilliant women I have ever known. Her first name is obviously a tribute to my mother, but her middle names are for my best female friends, both equally amazing." </p><p>"I thought your best friend's name was Hermione," He asked in confusion. </p><p>"It is, but Lily Luna Hermione doesn't flow as well as Lily Luna Jane does, Jane is Hermione's middle name," Harry stated. </p><p>"Well, it is a beautiful name." He said, "I believe that is all for this appointment because of how well things are coming along. Did you have any questions?" </p><p>Harry looked back at the screen that showed his daughter and shook his head, "I don't believe so, but if I come up with any, may I owl you?" He asked as he sat up, with some difficulty and Eden's help, and put his shirt back on. </p><p>"You know I have no problem with that," Eden said with a grin as he made a few marks on the parchment from the scan before officially shutting the scan down and now helping Harry off of the bed. </p><p>"Thank you, I'll see myself out. I'm excited to share the news." Harry beamed. </p><p>"Of course, just don't forget to see my nurse before you leave, and have a safe trip home." </p><p>"Right," Harry nodded and bid a goodbye to the healer and slipped from the office and made his way back to the front where the nurse station was. </p><p>Harry was surprised to see Draco at the nurse's station, talking to one of the witches there. But, Harry assumed he would have to get used to the sight for the next few months with the follow-up check-ups he'll have here with Healer Eden. </p><p>"Harry," Eden's nurse Amelia called, "How was your appointment?" She asked as she wrote down the date for his next appointment, and the last before he gives birth. </p><p>"It was great!" He said, putting his elbows up on the high counter to watch her write, "Eden said that I could- potentially that is- give birth any day." </p><p>"That's wonderful news! Just make sure if she wants to be welcomed to the world that you're near a hospital at the time, don't want a close call like with James, right?" </p><p>Harry blushed as the memory of his first birth came to light. He was minutes away from having a baby in the lobby as he was at the burrow when he first went into labor. </p><p>"Yes, but wouldn't it be a lovely front page of the paper?" He joked. </p><p>She giggled and handed him the paper with his appointment information, "That would be a spectacular sight actually." </p><p>Harry laughed as well and noticed out of the corner of his eye that Draco was watching the two of them converse, so he turned to the blond and smiled, "Did you hear that? You were right Draco, I am about to burst." He put his hands on his hips to show off his swollen stomach. </p><p>Harry was confused when the blond blushed but thought none of it, "Well, if I couldn't tell with just one look, I would be a horrible healer, wouldn't I?" </p><p>"I suppose so," Harry mused, "Well, I'm sure Teddy, James, and Artie are getting restless with Ron, so I'll be off. I'll see you in a week Amelia," Harry stated, bidding the witch goodbye, and giving Draco a nod as he left. </p><p>Again, Draco watched the dark-haired wizard leave from his sight. </p><p>"You know," Amelia started after a moment of silence washed over them, "With all that staring, I would think you fancied the Chosen One." She teased, giggling as he jumped at the accusation. </p><p>"As if, he used to be my rival at school, I just never knew he was the bearer in his relationship, and it's a little difficult to wrap my head around," Draco said in defense. </p><p>The girl shrugged, "I suppose since his pregnancies have been out the papers, but still. You're recently single, and maybe after Harry has his baby, he might be on the market too." She added in a sing-song voice. </p><p>"He has Ginny, why would he be looking? Plus he will have two toddlers and a newborn, that doesn't really give one much free time to date and mingle." Draco said, going back to the paperwork he was going over for a patient. </p><p>"Have you <em>really</em> not read the papers?" She asked in a shocked voice. </p><p>"You know I don't read that rubbish since most of the time those pitiful writers are still trying to ruin my family name." He hissed, narrowing his eyes at the witch. </p><p>The witch rolled her eyes, "Sometimes it's not all rubbish, and sometimes it's true," Amelia ignored Draco's comment of 'not likely' and continued talking, "Ginny and Harry are splitting up. She was caught with one of her teammates making out at a bar after they won in Bulgaria. It devastated Harry, and even though he was alright with moving past it, she was the one who filed for divorce." </p><p>Draco now knew what Harry's earlier statement was about. It was about his divorce, and he wasn't ready to be open about it yet, even if the papers didn't care about his privacy. </p><p>"What about his kids?" He asked, trying not to let his worry sink into his voice. </p><p>"I'm not sure, but there are rumors that Ginny gave full parental rights to Harry." </p><p>Draco nodded and stopped the conversation there, not wanting to butt into Harry's personal business too much. After the war, they both agreed to move past their differences, and since Harry spoke out for not only his Godfather but his own parents as well, he was more than willing to do as he asked.</p>
