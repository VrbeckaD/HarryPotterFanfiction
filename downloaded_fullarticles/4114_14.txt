      <p>He was getting used to these calls in the middle of the night. Draco Malfoy rolled himself out of his bed as another round of bellowing from the depths of Malfoy Manor arose.</p>
      <p>"MALFOY! GET DOWN HERE!" Gellert Grindelwald shouted again. Draco grabbed his wand from his bedside table and hustled down to the library where Grindelwald had set up camp.</p>
      <p>"I'm here, sir," Draco said as he pushed open the library doors. Grindelwald was at the desk that had always been Draco's father's desk, surrounded by a huge pile of parchment, scrolls, and books. Draco's father wouldn't be using that desk anytime soon. Grindelwald had grown especially unstable as World War II raged on the continent, and began beheading his followers. Draco almost couldn't believe it when he'd witnessed the first beheading. By the time it had happened to his own father, he'd become used to it.</p>
      <p>"What in the bleeding hell do the Nazi's think they are doing?" he asked Draco, not looking up from the parchment he was studying.</p>
      <p>"I'm not sure I know what you mean?" Draco asked. He had been tasked with keeping up with the Axis and Ally troop movements, which was easier said than done. The Muggle newspapers didn't know enough, and so Draco had taken to listening in on as many cabinet meetings of both camps that he could reasonably get himself to. It was exhausting, Apparating from London to Berlin every day. Sometimes more than once in a day, and sometimes he needed information from either the Russians or the States, in which case he had to find a long-distance unregistered portkey. Draco almost longed for a time when Grindelwald himself was defeated.</p>
      <p>"Why are they sending troops to Russia? What sense does that make? It failed for Napoleon, the Polish, and it's going to fail now," Grindelwald grumbled.</p>
      <p>"I'm not sure, sir. As you know, I monitor the meetings, I do not interfere. Would you like me to begin interfering?" Draco asked, hoping that his boss would say no. The last thing he needed was to add Imperiusing Muggles to his list of terrible deeds.</p>
      <p>"No, no. I do not want you to interfere," Grindelwald looked up suddenly, glaring at Draco. "But I do want to know why Hitler thinks this is a good idea."</p>
      <p>"Hitler is not a military strategist. He's rather bad at it, actually." Draco shrugged and continued, "He ignores the advice of his generals time and time again. Thus far, he's been lucky. But I fear that a land war in Russia is a terrible idea, just as you do, sir."</p>
      <p>"Idiot," Grindelwald hissed. "And there he was making things so much easier for me. If he devotes too many resources to Russia, he'll lose steam in the rest of Europe. If he loses steam in the rest of Europe, then half of my followers will find a way to back out."</p>
      <p>"What would you have me do, sir?" Draco asked.</p>
      <p>"Off with his head," Grindelwald muttered. "Yes, that's it, let's behead him," he said more decisively.</p>
      <p>"Who sir?" Draco asked. He thought Grindelwald was talking about Hitler, but that couldn't be right, could it?"</p>
      <p>"Hitler, of course. If he cannot be relied upon, he must go. Off with his head!"</p>
      <p>Draco nodded and didn't say anything. He was trying to figure out how he could get rid of Hitler in a public enough way that the Nazi's couldn't cover it up and yet, still be able to behead him. Draco knew that Grindelwald would accept nothing less than a full beheading. That's what had gotten his father killed. Lucius had shot the Killing Curse at a target that Grindelwald wanted to be beheaded, and so Lucius was beheaded for his failure to follow orders.</p>
      <p>"I think I have a plan that will work," Draco said finally.</p>
      <p>"Good, good. Just make sure it's public," Grindelwald muttered and waved his hand, indicating Draco should leave.</p>
      <p>Draco gave a short bow and walked out of the library. He'd lied. He had no idea how he was going to behead Hitler. Hopefully, he would figure it out, before Grindelwald decided to behead him instead.</p>
