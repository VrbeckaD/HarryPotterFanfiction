    <p>Huh.....where was he? This place was so damn comfortable.....wait..where the bloody hell was he sleeping in?</p><p>Harry opened his eyes and allowed them to adjust the light. When was the last time he had slept so well? 

He remembered that he hadn't had a meeting with his men for a long time--two weeks or something. As blue and white began filling his vision, he found himself a bit confused. This wasn't his bedroom, which was decorated entirely in dark green and silver. He was fairly sure that he hadn't drunk in a long time, either, so a hangover in someone's bedroom was simply not possible.

</p><p>He stretched himself and yawned as he pushed himself up against the bed. He was utterly confused. The last thing he remembered was touching the clock....

Oh yes, the clock! Right, right. Weird clock, travelling back 14 years only to see Granger and Weasley yelling above his head. He was in his fifth year and went to the Ministry with his so-called friends! And then....a bunch of things happened in which he wasted time with the Death Eaters (read: imbeciles), put ickle Bellatrix under a sweet crucio and stunned them. Following by that, a mid-night tea party was held in the manor with Voldemort and Lucius. And they saw the...

The Prophecy! Now that made sense. They watched it and came up with a plan. Malfoy's Manor had a lot of bedrooms, and everything makes sense now.

</p><p>Harry waved his hand to show the time. It was only seven in the morning--not that he liked to sleep late. Voldemort and he did researches in the Malfoy's damn nice library and stayed until Midnight  Despite staying up very late and literally collapsing into the bed (very immature, he must say), he was still extremely well relaxed and he added a note in his head: Malfoy Manor's bedrooms were really nice.

</p><p>Anyway, Voldemort was probably already awake. It didn't seem that he really need much sleep. They didn't find something really useful last night and he would probably stay in the library with him for another couple of days until his scheduled "escape". 

Speaking of that, he thought he should get rid of the bloody magic blocks today. Damn Dumbledore and his filthy Order of Chickens. Damn Weasleys. Damn Granger, Moody and others. </p><p>Well, actually maybe he could convince a few of them. Harry began thinking about the twins, Remus and Sirius as he put on one of Draco's shirts and robes. He could at least tell Draco part of his time-travel thing and befriend him. He was, after all, a good and responsible person, if not spoiled by Lucius. Well he could do that. The twins would be easy, and not much effort would be needed on Remus, as his most worried about thing is Harry's safety and happiness, which is mainly why Harry liked him. However, although Sirius's opinions was the same as Remus', he might be a bit tough. Maybe there were possibilities that he hated Voldemort only because of his so-called "wipe out muggleborns" strategy and the whole killing-James-and-Lily thing. Harry hadn't had much chance to really get to know Sirius in his "last life", bur from his conversation with the man, Harry thought that he might still have a chance of being swayed.  And he could also tell Neville and Luna the truth. They were his real friends and were trustworthy. Having Luna on his side would definitely be helpful for she was really insightful.</p><p>It was really a head trip sleeping in Malfoy Manor. The first time he had been here was a nightmare--being caught by Death Eaters, let alone seeing it in horrible horcrux-caused dreams. But actually let Granger be tortured was nice. Then he had been here to collect dark magic items which he found out later were amazing--a pity that he had given them to that damn Matthew Connors. Well, he now had a chance to save them.</p>
