    <p>Now that NEWTs
were over, including Hermione Granger revising after the tests to the
figure out if she answered anything wrong, she and Harry Potter were
alone in the Gryffindor Common Room. The library had long ago closed
and everyone else had gone to bed. They sat by the fire to reconnect,
but Hermione was distracted by her romantic problems.</p><p>“Why do I
keep falling for emotionally-unavailable women?” Hermione
asked, frustration showing in both her frizzy hair and her anxious
eyes.</p><p>“Because
you realised you were too gay to continue dating
emotionally-unavailable men?” Harry quipped back with an ironic
smirk.</p><p>“Harry
James Potter!” Hermione shouted, then looked abashed. “Uhm,
you do have a point. Victor and Ronald, for all their enthusiasm,
really weren’t emotionally available either. Ugh, do I just
have a type? A type that drives me to despair?”</p><p>Harry stopped
smirking as his face turned thoughtful. “No, I think you’re
still figuring yourself out. You only came out a few months ago.”</p><p>“When did
you become so emotionally clever?” Hermione asked, looking
thoughtful herself.</p><p>“Oh,
probably about the time I realised that I really wanted to snog Draco
because he’s fit and I fancy him so much,” Harry answered
with a big smile. “I should warn you that Slytherins get
weirdly competitive when they’re dating you and you’re a
Gryffindor. It’s not bad. In fact, it can be hot, really. But
it’s really weird, especially since we Gryffindors get
competitive right back.”</p><p>“Are you
sure this isn’t some sort of Draco and you thing and that you
are just projecting it on the rest of us?” Hermione looked
septically at Harry. “Like how you both decided to snog in all
the wardrobes and cupboards in Hogwarts?”</p><p>“I’m
sure. Ask Pansy, Lavender, and Parvati, if you don’t believe
me. Or, Ron and Blaise.” Harry replied confidently, a smirk
returning to his face.</p><p>“I would
rather not, thank you. I still think that I am scarred for life for
having running across both sets of them having forgotten the rest of
us existed. Here in the Common Room, no less.” Hermione
shuddered. “It was bad enough coming across a tangle of
Parvati, Pansy, and Lavender when I was coming back late from the
library without then seeing Ron trying to get into Blaise’s
pants the very next night.”</p><p>“That is
totally fair. Anyway, you are now warned. Weirdly competitive, I tell
you.”</p><p>“Warning
received and noted, thank you. That doesn’t solve my problem of
falling for my not-so-tall, dark, and emotionally unavailable
professor.”</p><p>“Firstly, I
think she’s less emotionally unavailable than you think.
Secondly, in about 3 days she will no longer be your professor, as
you are graduating.”</p><p>“Why do you
think she’s not emotionally unavailable? Are we talking about
the same Professor Black? What makes you think the same woman who has
cackled gleefully every time she has defeated me in class is in any
way emotionally available at all, let alone to me specifically?”</p><p>For the first
time in the conversation, Harry looked uncomfortable. “Uhm.
Draco may have told me some things about his aunt. Your name came up.
I am really uncomfortable saying more than that without talking to
Draco first.”</p><p>Hermione stared
at him blankly. “And, you are telling me this now, why, if you
can’t tell me anything else?”</p><p>Harry rubbed the
back of his neck while looking somewhat like the uncertain boy he
used to be. “Because you will talk yourself out of this
otherwise. I love you, but you are entirely in your head too much,
Hermione. You need to stop thinking and worrying and just tell her
how you feel. Instead of talking yourself out of it and regretting it
and sulking around Draco and me forever.”</p><p>“I do not
sulk!” Hermione responded hotly. Harry merely mouthed the word
‘troll’ at her. “I was eleven, thank you! I was
overwhelmed and the friends I <b>thought</b> I had made on the train
had instead been bullying me.”</p><p>Harry had the
good grace to look abashed at that. “Sorry, Hermione, but I
stand by my point that you need to tell her how you feel. Remember
how miserable I was until I finally talked to Draco? Time for you to
woman up and do the same thing. You’re a Gryffindor for a
reason, so show it.”</p><p>“That was
the worst pep talk that I have ever heard, but you are right,
regardless. Go to your boyfriend. I have to go speak to a certain
raven-haired professor with a bad attitude. Don’t wait up for
me.”</p><p>Before she lost
her nerve, she quickly left Harry with a final wave, sure he would be
heading to Slytherin almost immediately. She checked the Marauders
Map to see if Professor Black was still in her quarters. She was. Not
for the first time, Hermione wondered how the Marauders had managed
to find all the professors’ personal rooms but decided now was
really not the time. She needed to steel herself for what she was
going to say to Professor Black. Her stomach was full of butterflies,
and her palms were sweating. She was terrified that she was making a
terrible mistake, but maybe that was a good thing. Make the terrible
mistake, get rejected by the professor she had been falling for for
years, eventually pick up the little pieces of her shattered heart,
and try to continue to live on despite the pain.</p><p>“Oh,
Merlin. Harry is right. I am a Gryffindor. I can do this.”</p><p>She finally
arrived at Professor Black’s quarters, the door not in any way
suggesting that the most feared professor in Hogwarts lived behind
it. This was undoubtedly as the professor desired. She had not been
at all shy in making it clear that she at best tolerated her students
during class and didn’t want to see them otherwise. It had been
a struggle with Dumbledore when she had been initially hired to get
her to agree to even minimal office hours in her classroom. The idea
that any students would be welcome at her door was utterly laughable.
Which was, of course, why Hermione found herself at it and knocking
before she could stop herself. The door was flung open almost
immediately. 
</p><p>“What!”
Bellatrix Black roared at Hermione, dressed in one of her trademark
corset dresses, her dark curls almost moving by themselves as she
looked around to see any other students. “What do you want,
Granger? I already told you that I can’t help you revise after
your exam.”</p><p>“That’s
not why I am here… Bellatrix.” Hermione looked nervous
but somehow also self-assured. “I am done with my all classes
and my last exams. I am no longer your student.”</p><p>“Congratulations
are in order then, I suppose. However, I am not in the mood for
games, having successfully survived another year with mewling babies.
I am quite looking forward to other adult company and not seeing any
of my students until September, so if you don’t mind…”
Bellatrix moved to close her door. 
</p><p>Hermione steeled
herself and put a hand on the door, drawing herself up and adopting
what she hoped was an appropriately assertive look. “I am no
longer your student. And, I am another adult. Bellatrix.”</p><p>Bellatrix stopped
closing the door and looked dumbfounded at Hermione, like she’d
never seen her before. “What are you playing at, Granger? This
isn’t funny. Go back to your House, and I will forget you were
ever here.”</p><p>Hermione noticed
that while Bellatrix’s words were typical of her as a
professor, she looked both uncertain and unsteady, her eyes trying to
look anywhere but directly at Hermione. Maybe Harry was onto
something, after all. “Oh, well, in for a penny, in for a
pound,” she thought before closing the distance between them.</p><p>Bellatrix Black,
perhaps the greatest Defence Against the Dark Arts professor ever to
teach at Hogwarts was utterly taken by surprise as Hermione Granger,
the greatest witch of her age, kissed her. Which, to be fair, was not
something that ever happens when confronting practitioners of the
dark arts. Both of them were further surprised when Bellatrix reacted
by moaning and kissing back, eliciting an answering moan in Hermione.
</p><p>The kissing
continued a few moments more with more mutual moaning until both
women finally gathered enough thoughts to remember they were in a
Hogwarts hallway with students still in the castle. Surprising at
least Hermione, they somehow kept kissing as they stumbled into
Bellatrix’s door. Bellatrix immediately pushed Hermione around
and against the back of the door and used her to close the door while
pinning her still for what was developing into quite the snog.</p><p>Finally, both
broke the kiss, panting for air, staring wildly at each other, both
of them utterly shocked at each other, at themselves, at how utterly
bizarre it was that kissing the other felt so right when it was so
wrong. 
</p><p>“Fourth
year,” Hermione panted out to Bellatrix’s utter
bafflement. “That’s when I think I started wanting to
kiss you. But I went through a lot of denial.”</p><p>“I admit
that I noticed you eyeing me this year. But I didn’t imagine
you were eyeing me up for a snog, Hermione,” Bellatrix cackled,
though it seemed to lack its usual bite.</p><p>Hermione blushed
before suddenly looking put out. “Like you haven’t been
looking at me all year, either. When Harry is asking me why you’re
always watching me, you’ve been doing it a lot. This is not
just about a, what did you say in my fifth year, ‘a silly
schoolgirl crush that leaves nothing but the fading thunder of a
summer storm.’ Nicely poetic, by the way, if exceedingly cruel.
Anyway, the thunder hasn’t faded, I can hear it as loud as
ever. I think you know that and hear it, too.”</p><p>“That’s
pretty poetic yourself, Her… Granger,” Bellatrix
replied, verbally stumbling as she realised she definitely should not
be using her first name right now. Boundaries must be respected and
kept. After they’d already kissed.  Bellatrix sighed.  Her
professorial career had been so fulfilling, too.</p><p>“I think
after kissing like that, we should be on a first-name basis now,”
Hermione responded bravely.  “Plus, you called me Hermione once
already, Bellatrix.” Hermione emphasised the name while boldly
looking her in the eyes.</p><p>“Regardless,
you are still my student,” Bellatrix stared down Hermione as
she seemed about to interrupt her on that point, “at least in
the eyes of everyone else. Yes, I can have no effect on your grades
or NEWTS and in three days you’ll not be a student at all, but
all anyone else is going to see is my taking advantage of my position
as a professor. I won’t last another year.  I may not enjoy
children much, but I do enjoy my independence and the fact that the
pittance I get here is mine alone.”</p><p>“I, I
understand.  I’m sorry to have bothered you and almost ruined
your life.  I’ll go now,” Hermione turned to open the
door, her mind already running as fast as her body suddenly needed
to, tears already forming in her eyes.  Why wouldn’t the door
open?  She needed to get out right now!  Suddenly, she was spun
around.</p><p>“No,”
Bellatrix said calmly, looking her in the eyes, pinning her back
against the door with her intense gaze.</p><p>“No?”
Hermione responded uncertainly, still needing to get away, still
needing to run, tears streaming down her cheeks, utterly humiliated.</p><p>“No, you
won’t go now. No, you haven’t ruined my life. No, you
haven’t bothered me. Well, you haven’t bothered me in a
bad way. No, you don’t understand. No.” Bellatrix calmly
explained with, was that kindness in her eyes?</p><p>Hermione didn’t
respond. She felt utterly bewildered, overwhelmed, and utterly
humiliated.  Tears kept falling.</p><p>Bellatrix finally
took uncharacteristic pity on her.  “Here, let’s go sit
on the settee, have some tea, and we can talk all about this.”</p><p>Hermione followed
Bellatrix without question.</p>
