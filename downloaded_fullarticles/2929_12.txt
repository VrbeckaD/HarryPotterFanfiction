    <p>September 1st, 1971</p><p>The air was cool and brisk, on the face of an 11-year-old Sirius Black as he appeared with a *CRACK* when him, his father, Orion, and his mother, Walburga, apparated onto platform 9 ¾. It was a September morning and a cold one at that, and the beginning to Sirius’s first taste of freedom form the grips of his tortures family. Sirius came from one of the most noble and prestigious families in the wizarding world. The Blacks. Just like all other Blacks before him Sirius too had long, straight, jet black hair trailing just below his well-formed, broad shoulders. He was tall for his age but not yet met his pubescent growth spurt. Sirius’s face was poised with strong check bones and immaculate light-coloured skin. His eyes bared an emotionless grey. However, his personality resembled that like no other Black, especially not an heir. Unlike his eyes Sirius wore his heart on his sleeve, always over animated, always defying the rules and expectations his parents had of him. He preferred to call it bending instead if breaking the rules, this was often followed by a hex sent straight towards him from his mother’s wand. Even with Sirius’s tendency to overshare, the one thing he had made very clear to himself that was off limits to talk about was his abusive parents. He knew they were a factor of his life, and even thought it was normal to be cursed as a punishment, but he still never mentioned it to anyone. Ever.</p><p>It was 10:45 on the dot and the Blacks were one of the first to arrive to the station, a common thing for Sirius and his family. One of his father’s favourite sayings was “being on time is a great show of discipline and even grander evidence of self-control”. Clearly this was something he wanted Sirius to pick up before being let loose into Hogwarts – School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Walburga promptly grabbed Sirius by the lapels of his favourite black trench coat, which he thought looked incredible with his worn dark leather boots and his cotton white shirt, and placed a finger in his face,</p><p>“Now you listen boy, I will not have a son of mine bring greater shame to this family then that ghastly cousin of yours, do you understand me Sirius Orion Black”</p><p>Sirius simply and calmly rolled his eye and crossed his arms pretending not to notice her. Walburga raised her wand, and a look of terror consumed Sirius’s cool demeanour, but before she had the chance to mutter a hex Orion grabbed her hand.</p><p>“Not in public Walburga, we will teach him some discipline in private, when he gets back”</p><p>Walburga’s locked onto her husband with an unrelenting fire glistening in her eye, which unlike Sirius where a walnut brown which got greener as they merged with her pupils.</p><p>Sirius, who had turned paler then usual made a gulping sound before making his great escape towards the Hogwarts Express, only made possible by the tension between his hot headed and stubborn parents. In this silence he grabbed his brown leather trunk and dragged it towards one of the trains doors.</p><p>The Hogwarts express left Sirius astounded and full of excitement, the shimmering brass chimney, the golden whistle that fired a shrieking shout every couple of minutes, its large windows which he was sure would sport some incredible views on his way to Hogwarts and the hearty red that coated the train which was a pleasant change to the dark and colourless house he lived in, 12 Grimmauld Place, which was a property that had been in his family for generations, it was dark, bare and covered in cobwebs. But possibly the thing that stood out the most about the Hogwarts express was its smell. To Sirius this smell was new, and with each breath he inhaled, he craved more, like a drug it consumed him and once Sirius got a whiff he was hooked. A screaming word was overtaking him, it was so new and exhilarating as it flooded his whole being: freedom.</p><p>Due to that of him family’s punctuality Sirius had the pick of the cabins and took the one immediately on his left as he entered the carriage. As he sat down more and more families arrived some the same way he did, through apparition, others through flu powder and some, mostly muggle born’s and half-bloods, through a magic wall in Kings’ Cross station. Sirius hated the whole blood purity thing. What did it matter if you had two magical parents or none. His family didn’t share this trait, the Blacks where all purebloods and married only other purebloods. All except one however, Andromeda, all though she was Sirius’s favourite person in his life he was trained not to think or talk about her, she was an outcast. A disgrace to the black name, and that was all he was allowed to say on the matter.</p><p>As Sirius awoke from his trance like state he saw a boy smiling at him, standing on the platform. This boy, who must be a new to Hogwarts as well, stood at a slouch and his neck slightly leaned forward. He had a big, strong smile and warm, embracing eyes that had an emerald tint to them. Sirius could clearly tell he wasn’t from the same social class as him just from the cloths he wore. His faded yellow and blue striped cardigan and ripped tracksuit bottoms complimented his scruffy Nike trainers, and to finish the ensemble was his caramel brown hair that seemed to perfectly curve round his forehead and to the side. As to keep his long fringe from interfering with his eye slight.</p><p>Before he even had the chance to smile back two boys dragged their large trunks through the sliding door to the cabin Sirius was sitting in. One was a thin and unhurried boy with hair almost as dark as his, but with glimmers of brown streaks thought it. His hair stuck up in all directions and even with the boy’s obvious attempt to tame it, he wasn’t victorious. These brown streaks matched his hazel eyes that were defined by his budding strong facial features. His nose was home to a pair of circular glasses that enhanced his intelligent presence and gave him a confident look. Which quickly prompted the question why on earth would someone with such a disposition be with someone such as the other boy. The other boy was red faced and bulky with a constant sweat and his front teeth stuck out like a rodent. He had mousey brown hair that slicked back with a large helping of gel that had an industrial smell that you could scent from across the room.</p><p>“Hello there, I’m James, James Potter, nice to meet you,” He said in a confident tone, “and this is Peter Pettigrew, mind if we sit with you”.</p><p>“Of course,” Sirius replied, he said standing up and offering a hand to shake proudly, “The names Sirius Black.”<br/>
James returned the handshake and sat down opposite to Sirius, Peter sat down quickly next to James seemingly determined to stay as close as possibly to the boy. James seem like someone Sirius could see himself being friends with, but he didn’t think much of Peter.</p><p>“My father will be frilled to know I have talked to a Black before even reaching Hogwarts,” Sniggered James to Peter’s enjoyment.</p><p>“And mine a Potter” Sirius said, returning the banter. This made James eyes light up, finally someone to match his wit, he thought to himself.</p><p>Sirius had obviously heard of the Potter Household, which just like his was one of the sacred twenty-eight, and almost as well-known due to his father’s high position in the Ministry. So were once the Pettigrew before being disowned by the order after many squibs were traced with the last name Pettigrew. Just as Sirius had was about to say how they were all pure-bloods, not that it mattered to him. The boy from the platform with faded yellow and blue striped cardigan entered.</p><p>“Hello, is it okay if I join you, everywhere else is so full?” He said, his voice quiet and uncertain</p><p>James face lit up with the excitement of making a new friend, something Sirius feared would become a common theme if he stayed friends with James, but he decided the new boy can’t be worse than Pettigrew so why not allow just one more friend for the day.</p><p>Sirius patted at the seat next to him which the new boy took as if a command.</p><p>“I'm Remus,” he spoke with a rougher accent then the other boys, “Remus Lupin, and I’m guessing we are all first years.”</p><p>The other three boys all nodded and James, the confident and articulate one, introduced them, “I’m James Potter, that’s Peter Pettigrew and this is-”<br/>
Before James had a chance to finish Sirius interrupted him, “The one and only Sirius Black.” He said with décor and spirit, taking a bow to the amusement of everyone but Peter who was rubbing his wrist nervously.</p><p>Peter finally worked up the courage to speak, stuttering and stammering at every possible syllable, “So, do you know what house you all want to be in, I want to be in Gryffindor?”<br/>
James looked at him with a comforting gaze and with the softest voice he could said, “Peter we’re not going to bite, you don’t have to be scared-”</p><p>He was interrupted once again by Sirius, who made a sharp *BARK* with a loud nosh of his teach imitating a dog growling, causing Peter to jump and whimper. This was followed by a giggle from Remus and James with Sirius stating, “There’s no way you will get into Gryffindor at this rate Peter.”</p><p>James tried to give him a stern look to Sirius whilst holding back laughter and a smile, “Guessing you will be placed in Slytherin then.”</p><p>Sirius, acting hurt, replied, “As if I’d be in any another house” giving a sarcastic hand on his heart and shake of his head, “What about you Remus, what house do you want to be in”</p><p>“Well, my dad was in Ravenclaw, so I guess I could go there, but being in Gryffindor with Peter and, I’m guessing, it’s your first pick too James,” Remus said, directing his eye at James, who gave a proud smile, “Wouldn’t be so bad either.”</p><p>James stood up placing one foot on the seat in front of him, pretending to hold a sword upwards in his hand said in his deepest voice possible, “Are yes, Gryffindor, where courage and strength reign above all.” They all giggled, especially Peter who seemed to laugh at everything and anything James did.</p><p>They had talked so much about families and their hometowns, and even how James and Peter had known each other since they were babies because they were the only magical families in their small hamlet, that it had started to turn dark outside, suggesting they were nearly there. They had all gone and changed into their robes after being border-line commanded by a red-haired girl with emerald green eyes and an abundance of freckles resting on her nose. Sirius looked over at Remus who was transfixed on the window looking out of the train, curious to see what he was looking at he too looked only to be speechless at the sight, an extremely rare thing to happen to Sirius. It was the silhouette of Hogwarts, each individual window glowed with an intense light, covering the dark sky like stars in a clear night. It was Hogwarts, it was beautiful, and it was now Sirius’s new and beloved home. It was everything he had ever dreamed of and it was finally real.</p>
