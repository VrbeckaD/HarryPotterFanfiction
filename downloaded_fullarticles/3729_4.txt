<p></p><div>
  <p>Calidara Nefzen tried, desperately, not to be bored over her Summer holidays. Her adoptive parents both worked at a local hospital, so they weren't able to leave to take her on holiday like her friends and schoolmates. She was left to wander her townhouse, alone, most days. She finished her Summer homework within the first three weeks, after that she turned to the telly for distraction, but that got boring, too. She wrote letters to her friends, Fred and George Weasley, who informed her that they were going on holiday to Egypt to see their brother, Bill. She didn't write them again, to save her owl, Athena, a flight to Africa.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Callie only wrote her cousin, Draco, once. She was still upset at him for supporting the idea of eradication all Muggle-born witches and wizards from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Draco felt that, as a Malfoy, his pure-blood status made him better than those who were half-blood or 'worse'. Callie's parents were Muggles, she'd grown up in the Muggle world, so she hadn't known anything about magic until the Deputy Headmistress of Hogwarts showed up at the townhouse. So, Calidara Malfoy didn't act like a Malfoy, and Draco hated that about her.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>She hated that he was an elitist snob, made nasty by his upbringing. She also hated that the only other <em>good</em> Malfoy was rotting in the wizard prison, Azkaban, for using one of the Unforgivable Curses on Draco's father, Lucius. She hated Lucius. But more than anything, she hated that her father was Lord Voldemort, a Dark wizard bent on what amounted to world domination. Even now, 13 years after his defeat, Voldemort was still finding ways to try and regain his power. Two years ago, it was unicorn blood and the Philosopher's Stone. Last year had been a diary that allowed him to possess an eleven year old girl and use her to set a giant serpent loose on the Muggle-born students.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Callie spent her Summer holidays wondering what scheme to come back to power her father would use next, and how much assistance her Uncle Lucius would provide him. She'd considered, several times, not going back to school, but that's where her friends were, and her crappy blood family, and she really couldn't imagine not finishing her schooling.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Her Summer boredom came to a head when she decided to dye her white-blond hair a light purple at the first of August. She took a picture of herself, developed it in wizarding method, and sent it to the Weasley home, knowing her friends wouldn't receive it until they got back from Egypt.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>By the last week of August, Callie had gotten all of her books and supplies for Third year, but the Weasley twins wrote her to tell her that they were going to be in London to get <em>their</em> supplies on the last day of August and they were wanting to see her.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Callie, who had a bit of a crush on the older twin, Fred, wouldn't dare miss a chance to hang out together outside of school where separate school Houses and separate school years made it difficult to maintain contact. So, she was there, on Diagon Alley, when they showed up with her friend Harry Potter in tow.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Harry! Hermione!" She exclaimed as she entered the Leaky Cauldron. They smiled at her, as did Ron Weasley, which was a new experience. Until the last two weeks of their Second year at Hogwarts, Ron had been convinced Callie was evil, like her father. It took her saving his life from an acromantula and helping save his sister, Ginny, from Voldemort for him to realize she was a good person.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Callie, my pally." Fred appeared from the stairs and jumped at her to hug her.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Redhead Fred!"</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Why the rhyming?" Ron asked. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Callie and Fred both shrugged. "It's just a thing we do sometimes." Callie answered.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Though more often, lately. She wrote an entire paragraph of rhyming couplets in her last letter." Fred said, smiling.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"The one with the picture?" George asked, knowingly.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Callie blushed as Fred ran his hand over her purple fishtail braid. "Looks better in person." said Fred.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Thanks. I thought it'd look good. Something to set me apart from the other Slytherins."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Oh, you don't need purple hair for that." said Ron.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Yeah, you've got a soul, that's more than enough to set you apart." said Harry, smiling.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Oh, come on. The other Slytherins aren't soulless, they're just... nasty." She defended.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"No, I'm pretty sure that some of them are soulless." George said. "Like, Draco for instance."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Callie opened her mouth to argue, but shook her head. "If anyone were, it'd be him."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>~~</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Callie found Harry, Hermione and Ron in a compartment with a sleeping gentleman who looked exhausted and generally worse for the wear than any other adult she'd ever seen. Harry waved her into the compartment, then closed the door.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Who d'you reckon he is?" Ron asked.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Professor R.J. Lupin." whispered Hermione immediately.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"How d'you know that?"</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"It's on his case." Callie answered pointing at the luggage rack. Ron looked up to see the case with flaking gold letters that said '<em>Professor R.J. Lupin</em>'.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Wonder what he teaches?" Ron asked.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"That's obvious. There's only one vacancy, isn't there? Defense Against the Dark Arts." Hermione whispered.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Praying he's a better teacher than Lockhart." Callie whispered.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"One of those bloody pixies would've been a better teacher than Lockhart." Ron responded, before looking at Professor Lupin's pallid frame. "I hope he's up to it. He looks like one good hex would finish him off, doesn't he? Anyway... what were you going to tell us?" He turned to Harry.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Harry gave a look to R.J. Lupin's sleeping body, then started an explanation of Sirius Black, follower of Voldemort and insane killer of Muggles and wizards alike had escaped Azkaban to kill him. When he finished his explanation, Ron looked completely shocked and Hermione had her hands over her mouth. Callie shook her head at him. "How can you be so nonchalant about this?"</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Harry, you'll have to be really, really careful. Don't go looking for trouble, Harry-" Hermione started.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"I don't go looking for trouble. Trouble usually finds <em>me</em>."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"How thick would Harry have to be, to go looking for a nutter who wants to kill him?" said Ron, shakily. "No one knows how he got out of Azkaban, no one's ever done it before, and he was a top-security prisoner, too."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Maybe he can help my mum escape." said Callie, trying to find a bit of silver lining in Sirius Black's escape. The other three just looked at her like they were trying to determine if she was serious or not. She shrugged it off and they went on to talking about Hogsmeade. Fred and George had told her all about Hogsmeade and they'd even offered to sneak her out of the castle to see it, but she waited. She waited for her parents to sign the permission slip so she could go legally. Harry revealed that his Uncle hadn't signed his permission form, so they'd be going without him. The compartment erupted in groans of pity and upset.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>They tried to come up with solutions but there weren't any good ones and Harry resigned himself to staying at the castle. With Sirius Black looking for him, he'd be safer there, anyway. It was a couple hours later that Ron started complaining of hunger and then the train began to slow. "We can't be there, yet." Hermione said, checking her watch.</p>
</div><div>
  <p></p>
  <div>
    <p>"So, why're we stopping?" Callie asked as Harry stood, opening the door to look out into the corridor. Suddenly, the lamps all over the train went out and they were plunged into complete darkness.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>"What's going on?" Ron asked.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>"Ouch! Ron, that was my foot!" Hermione gasped.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>They sat and waited in the dark for a few minutes before other students started to seek them out to find if they knew what was happening. It wasn't long before Ginny Weasley and Neville Longbottom had been crammed into the compartment with them, everyone fumbling over each other and whining and apologizing and then, a hoarse voice said, "Quiet!" Professor R.J. Lupin had finally awoken, and there was a soft crackling and the man's face was illuminated by a handful of flames. "Stay where you are." He said as he stood and moved for the door, but it slid open before he reached it and the flames in his hand shone on a figure as tall as the ceiling, wearing a long black cloak. Its face was hidden in its hood, but something told her it wouldn't be too pretty.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>And then the thing beneath the hood, whatever it was, drew a long, slow, rattling breath, as though it were trying to suck something more than air from its surroundings. An intense cold swept over them all, so cold that Callie felt like her lungs had frozen. She couldn't breathe, and then her eyes rolled up in her head and she couldn't see. Darkness enveloped her and her body went stock still. She felt like she was drowning in a frozen lake with water roaring and wooshing in her ears and she was being dragged deeper into the darkness and somewhere down in the dark she heard <em>her </em>voice saying 'If the Nefzens hadn't found me, I shudder to think where I might've ended up'. There was so much pain in the words, but they were definitely being spoken by her. </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>As she was falling into the darkness, a white fog around her... and then she was being shaken. "Calidara!" Neville's voice struck her and her eyes were finally able to open. She and Harry were on the floor of the compartment, everyone else standing over them. Callie felt sick and weak, and as she pushed her hair out of her face she could feel that she had a sheen of cold sweat covering her face. Neville helped her into her seat as Hermione and Ron helped Harry into his. </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>"Are you guys okay?" Ron asked, his eyes flicking back and forth between them.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>"Yeah. What happened? Where's that-that thing? Who screamed?" Harry asked.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>"No one screamed." said Ron.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>Harry was certain he'd heard screaming, but Callie was still stuck in the words she'd heard spoken. A loud snap made everyone jump and turn to Professor Lupin, who was breaking an enormous slab of chocolate into pieces. He gave the two largest pieces to Harry and Calidara. "Here. Eat it. It'll help."</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>Harry didn't eat it, but Callie bit a chunk off and let it melt in her mouth. She immediately started to feel better, warmth returning to her extremities and radiating toward her core. "What was that thing?" Harry asked.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>"A dementor. One of the dementors of Azkaban. Eat." Lupin repeated. "It'll help. I need to speak to the driver, excuse me." </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>Hermione asked if they were okay and they both expressed confusion at what had happened. "I thought you guys were havin' a fit or somethin'. You both went sort of rigid and fell out of your seats and started twitching-"</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>Callie sort of drowned out their talking as she tried to think of what could cause a seizure like that. <em>'Grand mal seizure has two phases, Callie.' </em>Dr. Nefzen coached in her head. <em>'Tonic phase and clonic phase. Tonic phase is the shortest phase, where loss of consciousness occurs, and then all the muscles suddenly contract and make you fall to the floor. Clonic phase is where the muscles start rhythmic contractions, flexing and relaxing. What causes it, Callie?'</em> "Hypoglycemia." Callie whispered, making everyone look at her as she interrupted them. "Sorry. Uh, Harry, eat the chocolate. It really does help." She said, taking another bite of her chocolate.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>Harry looked down at the chocolate in his hand and took a bite as Professor Lupin reentered the compartment. "We'll be at Hogwarts in ten minutes. Are you all right, Harry?" </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>Harry nodded, embarrassed. "Fine." He muttered.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>"And you, Calidara?" Lupin turned his focus.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>"Yes, sir. Much better, thanks to you." They moved on in silence and when the train came to a stop in Hogsmeade Station, everyone rushed to get off. The First years were rounded up by Hagrid and sent into the boats and they were put into hundreds of carriages pulled by ugly-looking skeleton-like horse creatures. Callie took the carriage with Professor Lupin and sat back. "So, Professor Lupin, how did you know who I am, sir?"</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>"Ah, I had Headmaster Dumbledore fill me in on all students of note. The three students who found and permanently closed the Chamber of Secrets. The four students who stopped Lord Voldemort getting his hands on a Philosopher's Stone." </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>Callie looked over at him, surprised. He'd said 'Voldemort'. Only Harry, Dumbledore and her called him by his name. Also... "Four? What do mean? They were only three students went down there." </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>"It takes a very special sort of person to perform an extraordinary act, or a set of extraordinary acts, and allow no credit to be given them." Lupin smiled. "Albus told me all about you. Just like your mother, he says. A thorn in the side of the Sacred Twenty-Eight."</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>"The what?"</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>"The fanatical pure-bloods."</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>Callie nodded. "Right. The Directory. Draco's mentioned it. It's absolutely ridiculous."</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>"You're just like your mother. She hated being on that list."</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>Callie smiled. "Did you know her?"</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>"I knew her better than I've known any other Slytherin."</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>"Really? I... I've been learning about her third-hand from my Draco who's been telling me things my Uncle Lucius told him about her."</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>He nodded. "I wouldn't trust anything Lucius Malfoy has to say about Miranda. They were estranged long before she attacked him in front of the Wizengamot." He leaned forward. "Your mother was a wonderful woman. She stood up to your father, spoke out against him. We knew she had to be cursed when she started to travel with him and do his bidding." </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>"Can I... if you don't mind, sometime, can you tell me about her?"</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>Lupin smiled and nodded. "I'd be delighted." He said as the carriage came to a stop. As they climbed out of the carriage, Draco was standing in Harry's way on the stone steps into the castle. "Is there a problem?"</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>"Oh, er, no, <em>Professor</em>." Draco responded. As Harry, Hermione, Ron and Professor Lupin walked into the castle, Draco turned to Callie. "Your hair looks ridiculous. I told you it would. Were you there when Potter fainted?" He moved seamlessly from insulting her to teasing Harry.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>"I was there, but I didn't see, because I fainted, too. Except it was a seizure, Draco, not a fainting spell. Though I wouldn't expect you to know anything about a dementor-induced hypoglycemic grand mal seizure." She responded, quickly.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>Draco, Crabbe, and Goyle stared at her blankly for a minute before blinking. "I didn't understand anything you just said. Was it terrible?"</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>Callie rolled her eyes and headed inside the castle. She couldn't wait to get something to eat. As soon as she made it into the entrance of the Great Hall, Callie heard her name called. Deputy Headmistress, Transfiguration teacher and Head of Gryffindor House Minerva McGonagall was standing with Harry and Hermione. "Miss Malfoy, come with me."</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>Callie sighed and followed her. "Professor, will this take long? I'm starving."</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>"I won't keep you from your feast for very long, Miss Malfoy. I just need to speak to the three of you in my office." They made it to her office and sat down on either side of her desk. "Professor Lupin sent an owl ahead to say that you were taken ill on the train."</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>Harry turned red and opened his mouth to explain, but the door opened and Madam Pomfrey rushed in. She went between Harry and Callie grumbling about the dementors and calling them both 'delicate' which both children took issue with. McGonagall suggested they spend the night in the hospital wing, but they both piped up immediately to deny that idea. Madam Pomfrey ended on a note of 'They should have some chocolate, at the very least.' "We've already had some." said Harry. "Professor Lupin gave us some. He actually gave some to all of us."</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>"Feel a million times better, now." Callie said, nodding.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>"Are you sure you feel all right?" McGonagall asked, sharply.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>"Hungry, for real food, but beyond that..." Callie shrugged.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>McGonagall looked at Harry, who nodded vigorously. She sighed and sent them out. They made it back to the Great Hall, sad to see they'd missed the First year students being sorted into their Houses. Callie waved at the Weasley twins as she sat at the end of the Slytherin table and leaned forward to watch as Dumbledore stood up to speak. "Welcome! Welcome! to another year at Hogwarts! I have a few things to say to you all, and as one of them is very serious, I think it best to get it out of the way before you become befuddled by our excellent feast..."</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>He cleared his throat and continued, "As you will all be aware after their search of the Hogwarts Express, our school is presently playing host to some of the dementors of Azkaban, who are here on Ministry of Magic business. They are stationed at every entrance to the grounds and while they are with us, I must make it plan that nobody is to leave school without permission. Dementors are not to be fooled by tricks or disguises or even Invisibility Cloaks." Callie knew that was directed at Harry, even if he'd said it blandly to sound like it was a hypothetical. "It is not in the nature of a dementor to understand pleading or excuses. I therefore warn each and every one of you to give them no reason to harm you. I look to the prefects, and our new Head Boy and Girl, to make sure that no student runs afoul of the dementors." </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>"On a happier note, I am pleased to welcome two new teachers to our ranks this year. First, Professor Lupin, who has kindly consented to fill the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher." Everyone that was in the train compartment with R.J. Lupin whooped and hollered, but no one else really did, and Callie noticed Professor Snape, her head of House and Potions master and former follower of Voldemort who had been teaching her Occlumency for the past two years, looking at Lupin the way he looked at Harry; with absolute loathing. Callie did the math in her head and realized that if Lupin was at Hogwarts at the same time as her mother, he was also a schoolmate of Severus Snape. She cheered for the man, anyway.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>"As to our second new appointment, well, I am sorry to tell you that Professor Kettleburn, our Care of Magical Creatures teacher, retired at the end of last year in order to enjoy more time with his remaining limbs. However, I am delighted to say that his place will be filled by none other than Rubeus Hagrid, who has agreed to take on this teaching job in addition to his gamekeeping duties." Callie stood and applauded for him. It was exactly what he deserved. Draco and his friends glared at her. "Well, I think that's everything of importance. Let the feast begin!"</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>Callie immediately reached out and grabbed a roll in each hand, tearing into one with her teeth. She'd never felt so hungry. It wasn't too long before she was stuffed full of so much food it was painful, but her blood sugar was up and her weakness was gone. She waved at the Weasleys as she left the Great Hall and headed for the Slytherin Common Room, the students around her talking about Harry Potter fainting on the train. Callie rolled her eyes. Of course a bunch of pure-blood wizards wouldn't know anything about a one-off medical condition. Idiots.</p>
  </div>
</div>
  </div>
