  <b>Am I a sinner with my skirt on the ground? </b>
</p><p>Hermione doesn't do this.</p><p>Hermione doesn't go to a pub just for a drink by herself on a cool summer night. She definitely doesn't go to pubs like this, full of anonymous women dancing and laughing, flirting and smiling (grinding and kissing in dark corners, in shadows, in plain view in the middle of the dance floor). Her breath doesn't catch when she sees a familiar bob of black hair swish at the bar, and she isn't drawn to that woman, doesn't follow in her footsteps, doesn't gaze at her lips, at her neck (at her trouser-clad thighs, the narrow shape of her hip) and wonder what she tastes like. </p><p>She doesn't take this woman's hand, not this woman, not ever, and let herself be led outside to a dark alley, the only light from the almost-full moon and a flickering street lamp across the street. She doesn't let her skirt fall to the ground, let her knickers follow after, let her thighs be spread, let fingers stroke her until she's so wet that they slip right in. She doesn't grasp on tightly and thrust her hips, and ride those fingers through sloppy kisses and desperate moans, begging and pleading and chasing that high. </p><p>Hermione doesn't come with Pansy's name on her lips, loud and clear in the crisp night air. </p><p>No, she doesn't do this at all. </p><p> </p><p>
  <b>She'll have you falling harder than a Sunday in September</b>
</p><p>It's supposed to be just the once. And maybe not just the once at all, but how is she supposed to resist the simmering look in Granger's eyes? Her innocence just begging to be corrupted? Pansy Parkinson isn't a saint. </p><p>But touching her unlocks something unexpected, something Pansy doesn't dare to name. Some kind of ache that barely dulls when Granger comes, Pansy's name on her lips, Pansy's name echoing in the night, a scream and a sigh. Satisfaction spreads through her, that deep contentment that only happens in times such as these, but for once, it isn't enough. Not nearly so. </p><p>Again, they meet in that dark alley. Pansy slides her fingers between Granger's legs and watches her fall apart.  </p><p>And again, with Granger's tentative touch, the want in her eyes, two simple words breathed, "Teach Me."</p><p>Pansy breaks her rule that night and follows Granger home. She comes, writhing and breathless in the middle of the bed, Granger's mouth between her thighs, the smell of her everywhere. Books and woodsy pine and something sweet and undefined. Something addicting. </p><p>It's supposed to be just the once, a revisited memory, maybe. </p><p>Pansy should've known better. </p><p> </p><p>
  <b>Come, let me kiss you right there wake you up like sunrise</b>
</p><p>The first morning Pansy stays over, Hermione isn't certain it's on purpose or not. They come back to her home as they have done for weeks. Come back to her bed and pleasure each other to exhaustion, until they lie there, panting, naked, sweaty, strewn sheets tangled around their ankles, legs tangled with one another in their sprawl. Hermione magicks the ceiling fan on, sighing with the cool breeze against her skin and waits for Pansy to roll out of bed and dress. Hermione never asks her to stay, but she does think about how nice it would be, one of these days, to wake up next to her, to turn into her, to nuzzle her neck. To argue over which of them would get out of bed and make breakfast. She keeps these fantasies to herself, though. Too domestic for Pansy. Try to enjoy it for what it is, Hermione tells herself. She's told herself the same since the start of this thing, whatever kind of thing it is. Enjoy it, because it can't last. Not really.</p><p>But Pansy doesn't roll out of bed. Instead she turns into Hermione. Nuzzles her neck. And promptly falls asleep until sunrise.</p><p>When she wakes, she stretches skinny arms above her head, and Hermione stares at the delicate arch of her neck as she yawns her good morning. Hermione blinks. Blinks again. Disbelief must be written all over her face when Pansy looks at her and blinks right back. Hermione waits of the surprise, the disorientation, the questions. Where am I? Why am I still here? But they don't come. Instead Pansy dips down and kisses her lightly, just a glance, just a brush, nothing more, and says, "Tell me you have food in the house. I'm starved."</p><p>They don't argue over who cooks. Pansy makes herself home in Hermione's kitchen to Hermione's secret relief. She's been known to burn eggs more often than not. </p><p> </p><p>
  <b>You better know what you're fighting for </b>
</p><p>When they talk about it, they lie awake on the bed side by side, in the dark space between night and day. Hermione stares at the ceiling and trances the pattern of a spiderwebbed crack on the back of Pansy's hand. Hermione doesn't need to hear Pansy's confessions, but she listens, patient and certain that time will stretch, slower and slower, until Pansy has said all she needs to. </p><p>Hermione remembers the trials all too well. She remembers the guilty bloom of satisfaction when Pansy had been charged with aiding the enemy and then the spreading horror that took residence when she finally realized Pansy was just a child, a scared, broken child, whose only crime was crying out in a desperation to be safe. Hermione understood that years before she followed Pansy out into that alleyway. She understood that all children couldn't be expected to be brave. </p><p>Pansy had been sentenced; five years of limited magic and a leash worn around her wrist that kept her tethered to London where the Wizengamot could keep their beady little eyes on her. Hermione remembers Ron saying she got off easy. Hermione remembers not saying a word otherwise. So she listens to Pansy's quiet words in the dark space between night and day. She listens to the fear, the regret, and squeezes Pansy's hand when the words won't come. Pansy doesn't ever say she's sorry, but when she finishes with a raspy deep breath expelled into the quiet room, Hermione tells her, "I forgive you." </p><p> </p><p>
  <b>These eyes long to make you a perfect work of art</b>
</p><p>Pansy's moved in. They're living together. At least Hermione thinks so. There's been no discussion of this fact, just one night Pansy stayed over and never left again. </p><p>Though she's obviously <i>left</i> at some point or another because more of her things show up every few days. A stray throw pillow here. Facial creams and lotions, magical and Muggle, slowly taking over the vanity. Extra clothes in the wardrobe, so much that Hermione secretly expanded it with wizard's space rather than say anything. She doesn't know why she doesn't say anything. Hermione isn't the type of person who doesn't say anything. She makes lists and charts pros and cons and chews on every angle of a thing, coming at a decision from all sides until she's confident of the right way forward. </p><p>There are perks, and it's not just the sex at all hours of the day, on top the dining table, over the cluttered vanity, against the (thankfully reinforced) wardrobe. Pansy also cooks. And not just eggs, but loads of things, meat pies and roasted veg, pastas and curries, buttery pastries and sweet puddings. Hermione's kitchen has never been more well used, well loved. </p><p>And yet still, it's this unsaid thing lying in the dark of Hermione's stomach like a Confusing Concoction slowly absorbed.</p><p>But when she catches Pansy hanging a piece of art, an abstract feminine form, all long curved lines of shoulders and thighs, soft blues and with a hint of red, something Hermione never would have bought herself, but somehow fits perfectly in the space next to said dining table, it's the ideal opening. Pansy looks at her, face open and pleased, but Hermione knows her well enough now to see the faint nervousness in the pull of her lips. Hermione opens her mouth and the only words that will come are, "I love it." </p><p>Pansy dashes over and grabs her face with smooth palms and kisses her so sweetly it leaves Hermione breathless for days.</p><p> </p><p>
  <b>So dress me up I'll like it better if we both pretend</b>
</p><p>Sometimes Pansy likes to wear a dress. She paints her lips a deep red, slips on a shimmering black strapless number with a slit all the way up her thigh, and steps into six-inch spiky heels that she can only walk comfortably in with a stabilizing spell. She enjoys the way Granger's eyes go wide, the way her gaze clings to that bare hint of thigh, how Granger tends to hang back, walk behind her, and watch the swish of Pansy's hips as they head out the door to a restaurant, a pub…or just straight to the bedroom. Granger makes her keep the dress on as they fall into bed and her hand slides all the way up, tracing the slit, and over to Pansy's cunt. Her breath always hitches in a note of surprise when she finds Pansy pantiless and wet with want. She strokes Pansy to completion before she disappears beneath the clingy black fabric and her tongue takes over. Pansy wraps her legs around Granger's back, her heels clicking together as she rocks into Granger's mouth and comes to bliss again.</p><p>But most of the time, Pansy reaches for trousers, a well-tailored suit or sometimes, when she's feeling particularly playful, loose jeans that fall to her hips. She likes to wear her cock with them, likes to look down at the stretched denim at her crotch, likes to palm it, squeeze it. Sometimes Granger will find her like that, staring into a mirror, cupping her cock. Sometimes she finds Pansy with her hand down her pants, stroking it, watching the way her knuckles move under her jeans, her hips rocking almost imperceptibly with the stroke of her fist. Granger steps up behind her, her chin resting on Pansy's shoulder. Her eyes smolder, meeting Pansy's in the mirror. Sometimes she takes over, sliding her hand around and beneath the loosened waistband. Pansy's hips go faster. Her eyelids grow heavy, but she doesn't stop staring in the mirror, at the stroke of Granger's hand, at the flick of her tongue over her lips. They stay like this until Pansy can't stand it any longer and she turns around and pushes Granger to the bed and fucks her all the way, deep as her cock will go. She can almost feel the unbearable heat, the way Granger clamps down when she shudders so beautifully beneath her. </p><p>Sometimes in the middle of the night with only the shine of the moonlight in the window lighting the room with its muted glow, Pansy wants to ask. Sometimes she does, with her face pressed between Granger's shoulder blades, voice muffled, lips against skin. </p><p>"Dress or trousers?" </p><p>And Granger simply answers, "Yes."</p>
