    <p>“Well, here we are,” said Fleamont Potter, guiding James to a spot between platforms 9 and 10 at King’s Cross Station. “Are you ready?”<br/>James just stared at the solid brick pillar his father was showing him. “So, how’s this work?” asked James. “Is it like the wall at Diagon Alley, where we just tap a few bricks and it opens up? How do we keep this secret from muggles?”<br/>“James, don’t worry about that,” said Euphemia, standing next to her husband behind their son. “There are Ministry officials here to wipe the minds of any muggles that get suspicious, don’t stress about it.”<br/>“That’s right,” said Fleamont. “All you have to do is go straight through that brick wall.”<br/>“And you’re sure I won’t crash?” asked James.<br/>“Well, your mother and I never did when we went to Hogwarts, so I’m willing to bet you’ll be fine too,” said Fleamont. “Now, be sure to run at it if you’re scared.”<br/>“I’ll just crash worse if I do that,” said James, lining up his trolley anyway. James sighed deeply and ran as fast as he could at the wall, trying to keep the trolley straight. James closed his eyes as the front of his trolley hit the wall, then opened them in surprise when he didn’t hit anything. Instead, what he saw was a huge red steam train, with hundreds of people (mostly children) milling around.<br/>James kept walking for a little bit, then looked back to see if his parents had come through after him to see him off. However, when he looked back, all he saw was an auburn haired girl about his age running through. James watched her go past, and noted that she looked a bit lost and confused as the crowd engulfed her. Maybe he should go talk to her...<br/>“Hey James,” said Fleamont, grabbing James’s shoulder from behind, making him jump in surprise. “Sorry we weren’t right behind you.”<br/>“We just saw a young muggle-born girl looking for the platform, and we felt the need to make sure she got on here safely first,” said Euphemia. “Now where did she...” Euphemia looked around for a moment, before suddenly spotting her. “Ah, there she is, already getting on the train.”<br/>James looked over and saw the girl getting on the train, an older boy helping her with her trunk. ‘Oh well,’ thought James. ‘So much for talking to her today. I’ll never find her in this mess of people.’<br/>“Well James, do you need a hand getting your things onto the train?” asked Fleamont.<br/>“No, no, I should be fine,” said James, trying to lug his trunk to the train himself. However, James wasn’t a big kid, and could only shift the heavy box a few inches at a time.<br/>Fleamont laughed, and picked up James’s trunk with ease. “Come on kid, this way,” he said, boarding the train and quickly finding an empty compartment. “Here you go James.” Fleamont put the trunk down and gave his son a hug. “Have fun at school, son.”<br/>“Thanks dad,” said James, hugging him back. “Say bye to mum for me.”<br/>“Of course,” said Fleamont, getting up and leaving the train.</p>
<p>James took a seat near the window, watching the kids continue to board and parents saying goodbye. Before long, the train started to move. James looked out onto the platform, and saw his parents waving to him. James waved back until the train was out of the station, then sat back down. Suddenly, the door to his compartment burst open, and another kid about his age ran in, and slammed the door shut. “What the...” started James.<br/>“SHH!” hushed the kid, ducking down below the level of the window.<br/>“What did...” started James, but the other kid hushed him again. About two seconds later, a couple of larger boys stormed past the door, looking into compartments briefly trying to find something. One of them seemed to have rabbit ears instead of his normal ears, which James couldn’t help but laugh at.<br/>Soon, the boys had passed, but the other kid still planted himself in the corner. “Are they gone yet?” he asked.<br/>“Yeah, they’re gone,” said James. “I assume that had something to do with you?”<br/>“You saw it then,” said the other boy. “Guess it was kind of hard to miss. Yeah, it was me.”<br/>“That was pretty funny,” said James. “How’d you know how to do that already?”<br/>“Oh, my family try to make sure we know how to do stuff like that as soon as we have a wand,” said the boy. “I’m Sirius, by the way.”<br/>“Yeah, I believe you,” said James. “So, what’s your name?”<br/>“I just told you, my name is Sirius,” said Sirius. “Sirius Black.”<br/>“Oh, I thought...” started James, before shaking his head. “Never mind. I’m James Potter.”<br/>“Nice to meet you James,” said Sirius, shaking his new friend’s hand.<br/>“So, you do know how to undo that spell, right?” asked James. “Because I don’t like the idea of two first years trying to fight those guys.”<br/>“They’ll probably go away on their own,” said Sirius. “Or the school nurse can take care of it. Either way, they’ll never figure it out.”<br/>“Let’s hope not,” said James, as the door to their compartment opened again. The two of them jumped in surprise, expecting it to be the kids from before, but it was another kid of around their age.</p>
<p>“Hey, do you guy mind if I join you?” asked the boy. “I’m trying to read, and there’s these three guys running around yelling about some kid who gave one of them bunny ears.”<br/>“Wow, who could have done something like that?” asked Sirius. “Whoever it was must be a really talented, not to mention handsome wizard.”<br/>The newcomer narrowed his eyes at Sirius. “Right...” he said. “Anyway, can I join you?”<br/>“Sure thing, nerd,” said James. “What’s your name?”<br/>“Remus,” said the kid. “Remus Lupin.”<br/>“Well hello Remus,” said Sirius. “He’s James, I’m Sirius.”<br/>“From your joking manner, I definitely doubt that,” said Remus. “And anyway, why would you even joke about that? It’s a common enough name.”<br/>“Why do people keep making that assumption about my name?” asked Sirius.<br/>“Because more people know the word ‘serious’ than the brightest star in Canis Major?” suggested Remus.<br/>“Really reinforcing the nerd thing, aren’t you?” asked James. “Do you want the cool kids to beat you up?”<br/>“Bring ‘em on,” said Remus. “I’ve read up on the basics of spell casting, which I’m guessing most of the other first years haven’t done.”<br/>“And if that doesn’t work?” asked Sirius.<br/>“I have...other means,” said Remus. “Though I hope I never have to use them.”<br/>“Oh yeah? Like what?” asked James.<br/>“...I’d rather not say,” said Remus, as though he’d said too much.<br/>“Yeah, right, he’s got nothing,” said Sirius.<br/>“No, I’ve got something,” said Remus.<br/>“Okay then, what?” asked Sirius.<br/>“I...I...” stammered Remus, as the door burst open again, revealing yet another first year, this one looking terrified.</p>
<p>“Hide me!” he yelped, diving under James and Sirius’s legs and covering his head.<br/>“Whoa, what happened?” asked Sirius. “And is it anything to do with the bunny ears guy?”<br/>“Y...yeah,” said the new kid. “What do you know about it?”<br/>“I may have had something to do with it,” said Sirius.<br/>“Of course you did,” muttered Remus.<br/>“What happened now?” asked James.<br/>“He’s hexing anyone who laughs at him,” said the new kid. “Now he’s trying to hex me.”<br/>“Wow Sirius, you really ticked this guy off,” said James.<br/>“Yeah, my family has a knack for that,” said Sirius, before turning to the new kid. “So, you have a name?”<br/>“P-P-P-P-Peter Pettigrew,” said the newcomer.<br/>“Well, P-P-P-P-Peter,” said James. “I don’t know that hiding under our legs is a particularly effective strategy.”<br/>“What makes you say that?” asked Peter.<br/>“Because bunny ears is standing outside the compartment,” said James.<br/>“God damn it, you led him right to me,” said Sirius, as the door burst open.<br/>“YOU!” yelled the boy, pointing at Sirius. “I’m going to...” Before he could finish his threat, he was blasted down the corridor, and an elderly witch pushing a trolley of food came into view, putting away her wand.<br/>“Honestly Evan, scaring a bunch of first years like that?” scowled the trolley witch. “I thought you’d know better by now.”<br/>“Look at what he did to my ears,” snapped Evan, pointing to his ears.<br/>“Oh, boohoo,” said the trolley witch. “If I had a sickle for every simple hex you kids put on each other, I’d be living on one of the Caribbean islands by now. Just go see Madame Pomfrey when we get to school.” Almost immediately, the trolley witch dropped the sour expression on her face for one far more pleasant. “Anything from the trolley dears?”<br/>“I think we’ll get a few things,” said James, pulling out a few galleons.<br/>“Holy moly,” said Peter. “Where’d you get that kind of cash?”<br/>“I’m kind of rich,” said James, grabbing a bunch of snacks. “What do you guys want?”<br/>“Well, if you’re offering...” started Sirius, getting up to see what was on the trolley.<br/>As Sirius was rummaging through the food, James noticed something out of the corner of his eye. Looking over, he saw the auburn haired girl from the station that his parents had helped. She was happily chatting away with a boy with dark hair and pale skin. From the way they were talking, it was clear they’d known each other for a while. <i>Don’t worry</i>, James thought to himself. <i>You’ll get to talk to her eventually. Just wait until we get to Hogwarts.</i> James paid for his snacks, and sat back in the compartment with his new friends.</p>
