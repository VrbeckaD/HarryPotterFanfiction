  <strong>Acacia | Alphard Black</strong>
</p><p>Somehow, this isn’t what Alphard had imagined it would be like when he had suggested they become roommates. He’d been prepared for an invasion of snakes and books everywhere, not—<em>this</em>. Hands shaking, Alphard straightens his ascot. He has a date, and it isn’t with the ivory legs draped carelessly over the bathtub’s edge.</p><p>“If you keep fussing, you’re going to be late.” A rustle of pages turning. The soft roll of water. “Is this the same heiress as last week?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Quick turnaround. Almost indecent, really.”</p><p><em>My family think we’re having sex,</em> he doesn’t say. He lets his focus shift to the rest of the mirror’s reflection. Swallows. <em>Maybe we should be.</em></p><p>Tom leans back, and smiles over the edge of his wineglass.</p><p> </p><p>

</p><p> </p><p><strong>Acanthus</strong> <strong>| Draco Malfoy</strong></p><p>There’s a painting, in the secret alcove of his grandfather’s old study, of a dark-haired boy a few years older than him.</p><p>Draco has never seen the boy awake. He’s always sleeping, hair covering half his face as he leans against the meridienne’s headrest. There’s a heavy, boneless quality to the boy’s posture, a stillness that makes the careful arrangement of his limbs discomforting.</p><p>If it wasn’t for the slow rise and fall of the boy’s chest, Draco would think the painting was of a corpse.</p><p>Worse still is the deliberate, slovenly state of his robes, half undone and slipping off a slim, pale shoulder. The edge of a long, naked leg framed by a long slit. A shadow wrapping around a delicate ankle, suspiciously similar to a handprint.</p><p>Draco doesn’t think he wants to know the story behind this painting or why he grandfather has it.</p><p> </p><p>

  <strong>Aconite | Severus Snape</strong>
</p><p>Potter’s guardian blinks slowly, lashes inky over violet eyes. His smile is sweetly bitter, reminiscent of Severus’s last conversation with Lily. Severus forces down the swell of muddy emotions—regret, jealousy, anger, longing. Potter sits quietly beside the man, eerily calm and completely at odds with his memory of James Potter.</p><p>Albus keeps talking, trying in vain to convince ‘Artemis Peverell’ to fall in line—to return Potter to his relatives or accept them into his home.</p><p>For a half-second, Severus locks eyes with Peverell. A flicker of yew digging into flesh. Pain. Severus forces down the urge to freeze. That’s impossible—Peverell is too young to be a Death Eater.</p><p>Peverell keeps smiling. A spider hunting another, plucking the strands of his prey’s web.</p><p> </p><p>

  <strong>Agapanthus | Albus Dumbledore</strong>
</p><p>“Mr. Riddle, stay behind.”</p><p>Albus waits impatiently for the boy’s tagalongs to leave. Tom takes his time, lets Dolohov place a heavy hand on his shoulder and Black lean into his personal space. Finally, Tom waves them off and saunters up the aisle.</p><p>“Sir,” he says, with the beginnings of what can only be a pout, though Tom would never admit to it.</p><p>The classroom’s door shuts heavily.</p><p>“About your summer arrangements—there is an alternative to the orphanage.”</p><p>“What do you want?” Suspicious as always, and rightly so.</p><p>Albus curls a hand around the back of Tom’s neck, dips his fingers under his robes.</p><p>“I’m sure you have a fair idea.”</p><p> </p><p>

  <strong>Agrimony | Thorfinn Rowle</strong>
</p><p>Thorfinn isn’t blind to the game Riddle’s playing. He still takes part, still vies for scraps of his attention even though he can’t compete with the priceless heirlooms and fists full of gold the others bet with. So he finds other ways to make his case, ways the others hesitate to turn to.</p><p>Feeds Riddle’s want for attention with fingers buried between his legs and open mouthed kisses along his neck, gasps praises into a sweet mouth. He can’t leave bruises or bites, not yet, but he scrapes his teeth over skin and gropes harder than he should.</p><p>And Riddle lets him—let him take and taste. So, Thorfinn is pretty sure he’s winning.</p>
