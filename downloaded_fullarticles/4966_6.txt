  <strong>Summary:</strong>
</p><p align="center">
  <strong>Harry is asked to become the new defense teacher at Hogwarts after the past professor becomes too afraid of the curse, but what happens when the potions teacher turns out to be his ex-arch-nemesis, Draco Malfoy? Can they get over past prejudices? Will they be able to stop staring at each other long enough to talk? who knows!</strong>
</p><p align="center"><strong>aka the one where they are trying to be civil but end of falling in love. This is just a short (very short) passage that I'd never be able to add to the actual story. If you want to read what I've written in the original story here is the link </strong>http://archiveofourown.org/works/7396852</p>
<hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>The sun was setting and the orange-pink light gleamed on the ruins that used to be considered the safe place in the Wizarding World. The once solid Hogwarts looked for like a beautifully painted tragedy than a school when basked in the warm and darkening glow.</p><p>“Sometimes the war just feels like a terrible nightmare. Like it didn’t actually happen. Then I look around and see all the damage it has done and it hurts. It’s painful to know I caused this.” Harry spoke so softly that Draco wondered if he was meant to hear the words at all. It didn’t matter if he was meant to hear them or not though, he needed to set Harry straight. In one quick motion Draco picked up Harry’s hand and securely grasped it.</p><p>“Harry,” Draco spoke his name in gentle frustration, “none of this was your fault.” Draco heard Harry scoff next to him and could almost feel the eye roll.</p><p>“Draco, that scar across your chest is permanent proof of the damage I have caused.” Harry’s emerald eyes were glued to Draco’s covered chest. His guilty thoughts turned to mush though, when nimble fingers held his chin. They barely had to use any force to lift his eyes to meet the grey ones across from him, the ones that were getting closer. The eyes dropped close and so did Harry’s.</p><p>Everything went dark for a split second, but then lips were hesitantly touching his and the blackness behind his eyelids exploded into dancing lights. Lights that were moving in sync with his and Draco’s lips.</p><p>It was magical.</p>
