          <div class="userstuff"><p>There were three sisters<br/>Walking the path<br/>In the warm gold twilight<br/>Long ago<br/>When they were happy still</p>
<p>Then in the autumn light they saw<br/>The wide rushing stretch of water<br/>It was with grace that they each<br/>Crossed the water  								though without magic</p>
<p>Little did they know<br/>That this was Death’s river<br/>And Death was not happy to be <br/>Cheated of her due</p>
<p>But it was with a smile <br/>That she told them<br/>If they ever had need								or want<br/>To call her, and she would grant</p>
<p>A <br/>Single<br/>Wish.</p>
<p>The eldest sister <br/>Was the first to bend.<br/>Her mother<br/>Had never truly loved her <br/>And so she wished<br/>For her mother to love her daughters</p>
<p>And yet<br/>Death was tricky</p>
<p>So<br/>She granted the eldest’ wish<br/>But </p>
<p>The youngest sister was <br/>The daughter of another woman<br/>And the mother of the other sisters<br/>Would now hate her,<br/>Loving only the others.</p>
<p>The eldest<br/>Grew drunk on happiness<br/>At being loved<br/>And forgot at whose expense<br/>She had bought it</p>
<p>The middle sister<br/>Always overlooked<br/>Grew drunk on being known<br/>Without even spending a wish</p>
<p>The youngest sister<br/>Had nothing to get drunk on <br/>And never forgot-<br/>The misery of having nothing,<br/>Whose happiness she was paying for</p>
<p>The middle sister<br/>Was the second to bend. <br/>She wanted to be noticed<br/>She wished to never be<br/>forgotten</p>
<p>And yet<br/>Death was tricky</p>
<p>So <br/>She granted the middle sister’s wish<br/>But</p>
<p>They never forgot her<br/>They knew all<br/>They always watched her<br/>With eyes full of fear<br/>With fear, and hatred</p>
<p>The eldest sister<br/>Was still in love<br/>With being loved<br/>Too lost to realize</p>
<p>The middle sister<br/>Grew mad with their gazes on her back<br/>And gave them <br/>Something to truly fear<br/>They called her The Lady<br/>And they would never<br/>Ever forget </p>
<p>The youngest sister<br/>Would never forget, either. <br/>And she watched them<br/>And in her eyes something burned</p>
<p>The youngest sister<br/>Was the last to break<br/>Hated where all were loved<br/>The dread Lady her sister<br/>So she wished<br/>To become free</p>
<p>And yet<br/>Death was tricky</p>
<p>So<br/>She granted the last sister’s wish<br/>But</p>
<p>Oh, the last sister, she burned<br/>Her hands and her hair<br/>Her heart and her lungs<br/>Everything she was<br/>Burned</p>
<p>The eldest sister<br/>Realized too late<br/>As she went to ashes and smoke<br/>Her sister had never been loved<br/>Either</p>
<p>The middle sister<br/>The Lady<br/>Realized too late<br/>As she went to ashes and smoke<br/>It was her sister who should not be forgotten<br/>It was her sister who should really be feared</p>
<p>The last sister<br/>Decided as she burned<br/>She would go with them<br/>And she greeted Death<br/>Finally free</p></div>
