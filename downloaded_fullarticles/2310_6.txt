    <p>Tony was dying. Well, sort of.</p>
<p>Actually he was in a constant state of almost dying due to Harry, a super awesome magic person who had some kind of odd deal with Death that had extended to his boyfriend.</p>
<p>It sounded even weirder when he said it out loud.</p>
<p>Basically, the arc reactor was going wrong in a big way and Tony was being poisoned by the very thing that kept him alive. And yes, he did see the irony of the situation.</p>
<p>Somewhat embarrassingly, it had actually been Harry that was the first one to notice something was going wrong with the reactor. This was embarrassing because Harry freely admitted he had no idea how the reactor worked, but had still picked on the change in energy signature before Tony or even JARVIS. Really, if there was anything Tony should be better at than Harry, it should be the technologically complicated arc reactor.</p>
<p>So to recap the last few months, Tony had invented a whole bunch of very helpful things that were helping humanity and making the SI Board very happy, Harry has started volunteering at a little local dojo teaching small boys and girl how to kick some serious ass, and the reactor was screwed.</p>
<p>There was always <em>something</em>.</p>
<p>“So you’re gonna jump out of a helicopter in your suit, even though it would be easier to just fly there, in your suit.” Harry was asking from Tony’s favourite work chair, feet up on a miraculously clear area of workbench, left hand twirling the Death Stick of Destiny (a trademarked name as far as Tony was concerned), and right hand carefully patting DUM-E who was actually making some kind of noise that weirdly resembled a dying cat.</p>
<p>Tony paused in his adjustment of the right boot of his suit, glancing over at Harry to double check that the wizard was, in fact, sassing him. “Really? That’s where you’ve taken issue? Not the dancing women or the stupid speech, but the method of transport to the event itself? And it’s an aeroplane, not a helicopter.”</p>
<p>Harry was grinning before he’d even reached the description of the speech. “Aeroplane. Of course, that’s so much better. The missing piece of the puzzle.” DUM-E gave a strange little chirrup as Harry scratched a joint in his arm like you would a dog.</p>
<p>Tony huffed, trying in vain to stop his mouth from tipping up in a smile. “Exactly. I am brilliant. And stop twirling that thing like a baton. You’ll take someone’s eye out. Or turn DUM-E into a real dog.”</p>
<p>Tony glanced up to see Harry looking at his precious first robotic child with a shrewd gaze. “A Labrador?”</p>
<p>“No! No, dogs! But, if it did happen, he would definitely be a Chow Chow.”</p>
<p>Harry grinned once more before leaning the chair back in a display of unlikely physics, closing his eyes. “What does Pepper think of your aeroplane?”</p>
<p>“You know Pepper thinks the whole Expo is pointlessly extravagant. I told her I was walking.” Tony dropped his screwdriver so You could feel useful. Butterfingers was still sulking in the corner after knocking over <em>another</em> box of screws.</p>
<p>“Maybe you <em>should</em> walk. That way you won’t have to use the suit at all.”</p>
<p>And once again, Harry had hit the proverbial nail on the head.</p>
<p>“Alright you got me. The reactor’s getting worse and the suit accelerates the process. There, I said it!” Tony had his hands in the air in exasperation, which gave Harry the perfect opportunity to silently appear from nowhere and wrap his arms around Tony’s ribs from behind, just under said reactor.</p>
<p>“You know that’s creepy, right?” Tony grouched. “Appearing in utter silence?”</p>
<p>“Yep. I had a Professor who did the same thing.” Harry sounded utterly unrepentant, his head tucked in between Tony’s shoulder blades.</p>
<p>Tony couldn’t help the gusty sigh he loosed, hand coming down to cover Harry’s. “It can’t be this damn difficult to find a replacement compound.” Harry hummed encouragingly. “I must be missing something.”</p>
<p>“You’ll figure it out. After the Expo with your terrible speech.”</p>
<p>Tony hadn’t know it was possible to roll your eyes fondly until right then.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry was currently feeling a bit useless.</p>
<p>In general, he was actually quite fulfilled. He’d forgotten how nice it was to teach people, especially kids. It was great to see kids under ten who would have a better chance of defending themselves than most adults.</p>
<p>He did feel useless when it came to Tony and the reactor however. All he could do was feel the reactor changing with no way to stop it, which was particularly frustrating. It was also a little disconcerting that Harry could detect the smallest changes in the advanced tech, though that at least had a plausible explanation.</p>
<p>It started with Stane – Harry had become a <em>touch</em> fonder of the Elder Wand afterwards. He still hadn’t gone near the Resurrection Stone, which lived in its own little pocket dimension that Harry hoped to never open, and he didn’t really have much need for the Invisibility Cloak these days, so the Elder Wand was the only Hallow he had regular contact with. It was really hard to hate something that liked you so much. It was also really strange that a <em>wand</em> could like someone, but that was a side issue.</p>
<p>Harry now tolerated the Death Stick even though he didn’t really need it all that much. It was his growing connection to it however, that lead Harry to his main discovery.</p>
<p>Harry’s magic was growing, and that was why he was now so sensitive to Tony and the reactor.</p>
<p>It was small, just enough to be noticed. His magic was just a little <em>more</em>.</p>
<p>Magicals were beings of magic, as in it saturated their very being. It was the reason Squibs were so pitied – to have a core but be unable to access it was unthinkable for your normal witch or wizard. Because magicals were so connected with their power, it effected their bodies. Wizards and Witches were hardier than your average human, able to withstand more. They were sometimes a little faster, sometimes a little stronger, all depending on their magical ability and affinity. Harry’s affinity, for example, lent towards Battle Magic – a handover from his upbringing.</p>
<p>Once you reached your magical maturity however, you stopped advancing. Harry’s magic should have been stable. His <em>body</em> should have been stable.</p>
<p>Instead, his magic was a little more, his reflexes a little faster, his senses a little sharper. His ability to pinpoint the reactor within the house was scary accurate because it was just so easy to spread his magic out to find it.</p>
<p>It was concerning, and it was rubbing off a little on Tony too.</p>
<p>It was mostly noticeable when Tony was in the suit – Tony was just a little better at it than he really had any right to be. A bit stronger, a bit quicker.</p>
<p>Tony had noticed it, but they didn’t really talk about it. Maybe once Tony <em>stopped dying</em>.</p>
<p>Which despite the changes to his magic, Harry couldn’t do much about. Hence, useless.  </p>
<p>He was currently watching the opening of the Expo, listening as Tony sprouted cliché after cliché in a brightly gaudy show with the promised women and grandiose speech. Ron would have loved it.</p>
<p>When it ended, Harry expected Tony to show up within half an hour. Instead he got a call.</p>
<p>“I got Served. I’ve got to be in DC by tomorrow, so me and Happy are just gonna go straight there.”</p>
<p>Harry just agreed, telling Tony to watch his mouth and to try and not be an ass.</p>
<p>After he hung up, Harry tried to confide in JARVIS. “It’s all going to go terribly.”</p>
<p>“<em>It’s as though you are psychic, Hadrian</em>.”</p>
<p>Sassy JARVIS was still the best.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>When Tony had gotten home Harry had punched him in the arm and called him an arrogant dick. Which was deserved in all honestly – the Senate Committee had been a doozy but he had definitely made it worse which his unreserved bullshit.</p>
<p>Tony had experience with these things though – you had to get the story out there or things could happen without the population knowing. The government was <em>very</em> good at that kind of thing.</p>
<p>So he acted as a complete ass and made it into a big media story, offering some semblance of protection.</p>
<p>Something interesting <em>had</em> occurred though, while he was in DC.</p>
<p>They were lying on the floor in the ‘shop, on top of some strange futon thing that Harry had magicked up. Tony liked discussing private things in the ‘shop because it was one of the only places that he could guarantee wasn’t bugged, mostly because JARVIS was constantly watching, but also because Harry had beefed up the security so much that it was very likely impossible for ants to get in without permission.</p>
<p>“Some SHIELD guy was sniffing around in DC.” Tony began, hand moving through Harry’s hair where his head lay on his stomach. They had this perpendicular thing going that definitely would not have been possible on a normal sized futon. “He kept his distance, but he was definitely SHIELD because I recognise him from those active operative files.”</p>
<p>Yes, Tony had hacked SHIELD. Yes, Tony had memorised the faces of almost all their active operators in the US and also shared the images with Harry. No, he was not even slightly concerned. If they didn’t want him in there they would have a better firewall.</p>
<p>Though that wasn’t entirely fair, seeing as Tony hadn’t yet me a firewall that he and JARVIS couldn’t crack in under a week. Tony was a genius, as he kept reiterating. Also, SHIELD was easier because Howard was still recognised as a founding member and Tony had figured out his father’s passwords for most things by the age of 8.</p>
<p>“He kept looking at the reactor and he seemed pretty unsurprised by my terrible behaviour.”</p>
<p>Harry had his thinking face on. It was interesting to watch actually. His bright green eyes focused on the roof with laser intensity, his forehead crinkled ever so slightly into a little frown. “They must know something about the technology. Maybe they predicted the Palladium problem? Would Howard have kept plans in their database that they still had access to?”</p>
<p>Tony grinned. “Great mind thinks alike. JARVIS is sifting through now.”</p>
<p>Harry didn’t smile in return. “But that means they think you are dying and haven’t said anything or even tried to help. Knowing manipulative men, they’re probably going to wait until the last minute and swoop in with an answer so they look like the good guys.” Harry sounded just slightly bitter, likely from being poked and prodded in various directions by people of power since he was a child.</p>
<p>It was a good point though. A <em>very </em>good point, in fact. “What assholes. We should definitely out asshole them in retaliation.”</p>
<p>Harry turned his head to face him. “That sounds like you already have a plan.”</p>
<p>Tony, who had in fact been struck by inspiration just in that second, slowly smiled. “Yeah. You know what? I do have a plan.”</p>
<p>“Great.” Harry agreed, turning back to the roof with a grin. “When it all goes wrong I can blame you then.”</p>
<p>Tony was surprised into loud laughter.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Stage one of the plan was pretty much the whole plan. Tony would simply pretend he was actually, properly dying. In the meantime he would keep trying to figure out a replacement core for the reactor.</p>
<p>Harry had gotten Tony to make a brief list of things he might do if he were dying. Half the things involved doing things with and to Harry that they could do later and so were immediately removed from the list. In the end, there was only three real things.</p>
<p>One, make Pepper CEO of Stark Industries. This would be their first layer of the scheme and they had agreed that Pepper should be in the know. It was actually quite difficult to simply hire a new CEO without input from the Board, so to make it all official like but still possible, Tony would simply make it so Pepper could represent him in all aspects of the business as required. Board meetings were a different story, but they didn’t happen too often.</p>
<p>The second thing on the list was to give Rhodey a suit. Tony had actually set aside the Mark II for Rhodes, knowing that appearing to gift one to the army would get them to back off a little, at least for a while. What they wouldn’t know, Tony explained, was that he had very carefully written code and implanted it into the suits basic AI system that would ensure the suit would only function with the correct pilot, being Rhodey. The army wouldn’t even be able to power the suit up without Rhodey in it.</p>
<p>That point would be a little more challenging to deal with without arousing suspicion.</p>
<p>The last thing was less of a particular thing and more of an ‘I would definitely do something crazy and unnecessary’. They were going to have to wing that one, but Harry had faith that the moment would present itself.</p>
<p>Harry had convinced Tony that they should get started right away. “The sooner we act, the more control we’ll have.”</p>
<p>So operation ‘make Pepper the boss’ started right up.</p>
<p>It didn’t really start well.</p>
<p>“What the hell was that, Tony?” Tony had asked Pepper to come by and it seemed she’d taken that as an invitation to vent her frustrations.</p>
<p>Harry watched in interest as Tony tried to cut in, flustered in the face of the red-headed woman’s wrath. “I don’t actually know what you’re talking about?” This was absolutely the wrong thing to say.</p>
<p>“You don’t know? What was all of that in DC? Were you trying to come across as a giant jerk? Because that’s what it looked like!”</p>
<p>Tony looked a bit panicked, an expression he’d seen (and worn) many times during his Hogwarts years when Hermione became annoyed with someone. His favourite was still the terror on Malfoy’s face after Hermione had threatened to curse him in fourth year – The blonde had tread carefully around Hermione since the slapping incident the year before.</p>
<p>“Pepper, I can definitely explain! I totally can!” Tony looked towards Harry, which of course brought Pepper’s attention to him. Luckily, Harry hadn’t been there and couldn’t be blamed which was a relief. Pepper was a little terrifying. “Hi Pepper. It’s not that bad, is it?”</p>
<p>Pepper released a gust of breath, blowing her fringe up away from her forehead. “While it pains me to admit it, it has been much worse before.” She looked back towards Tony, eyes narrowed now in suspicion. “Which is strange in itself actually. Why did you ask me to come by? This doesn’t even rate in the top 10 of your PR disasters.”</p>
<p>“You’re right, that’s not why I called you here at all.” Tony foundered for a moment before, “Would you like a seat?” It was slightly adorable that Tony fell back onto his manners when he didn’t quite know where to start.</p>
<p>Pepper was still frowning in an ‘I do not like where this is going’ kind of way. “It sounds like I’ll actually need a martini, but we can get to that later.”</p>
<p>Pepper sat primly, focused entirely on Tony. It seemed to put the genius off even further, as his hands started fluttering by his sides as though he wanted by pick something up to pull apart and put back together. After a few seconds of Pepper sitting patiently Tony finally managed to get out something. “Pepper, I want you to be the CEO of Stark Industries.”</p>
<p>Harry had forgotten that Tony lost all tact when he was a little nervous.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>After his false start, Tony managed to explain the situation to Pepper to her and Harry’s satisfaction.</p>
<p>“SHIELD, as in that Coulson guy, right?” Pepper asked, and Tony once more did a mental happy dance as he was reminded that he had totally picked super badass spy as his first answer in relation to the agent.</p>
<p>“Exactly.” Harry answered, now sitting next to Pepper with his teacher face on. Tony could see why the kids all loved him, with the way he looked at whoever was speaking as they were of the utmost importance no matter the topic. His eyes were bright and focused and the little crinkle on his forehead gave away his concentration and—well, maybe Tony was a little biased.</p>
<p>“And they think Tony is dying, but aren’t helping him until they feel the time is right.”</p>
<p>Tony refocused with difficulty and nodded along. “Yep.”</p>
<p>They had told a small white lie at that point of the story – SHIELD thought Tony was dying but he wasn’t because he had already fixed the problem with the arc reactor that they thought he had. It was a little easier to take then ‘maybe immortal’.</p>
<p>“And you want me to take over your responsibilities as head of SI so it looks like you <em>are</em> dying, although the board will think I’m just acting on your behalf.” Neither Harry nor Tony had missed the little glow of pride and happiness that Pepper had emitted when Tony had said she was the only person in the world he trusted besides Harry to run SI, and she had a lot more business sense than Harry did.</p>
<p>“You got it. Do you accept?” The nerves came back for a brief second as Tony watched Pepper sit a little straighter.</p>
<p>“I would be honoured to run SI for you.”</p>
<p>Step one complete.</p>
<p>Of course, everything got harder after that.</p>
<p> </p>
