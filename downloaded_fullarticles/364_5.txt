    <p>For years far too immeasurable to calculate, a war between those good and those bad raged throughout the world, spreading death and ruin throughout the land. Both forces fought continuously to defeat the other and claim rule over the restless kingdom.</p><p>The light elves, respectable wizards, and beautiful veelas were often forced to battle the murderous vampires, dark warlocks and vicious werewolves. And though the war was often fought between these immortals, mortals often found themselves within the struggle and forced to choose a side to fight for. Although the mortals fought along with the ever- living, the details of the start of this battle are still mostly unknown to them. The secrets of which the mortals fight for have always been a mystery, until now…</p><p>It was said that when the world was first created, by a being Nameless to most, wizards and witches were the first creatures to inhabit the earth. The Nameless Being gave the wizards immortality and the ability to perform magic, so that they could fill the earth with positive magical energy.</p><p>And for an incalculable amount of time, the magic folk lived on the earth peacefully, performing their magic to create rainbows and many other lovely things. It wasn't long, however, until the Time of Peace ended and the battle between good and evil began; it is believed that the unpleasantness started with the hate and the dissimilarity between two brothers.</p><p>Of all the wizards and witches that have occupied the world since the beginning of time, two prominent wizard brothers, Godric and Salazar, stood out to be the most powerful and intelligent. The magnitude of power that the two possessed was overwhelmingly unimaginable. Thus, they had a great deal of influence on the other immortals and many mortals.</p><p>Though the two wizards were both conceived as brothers in the eyes of the Nameless Being, they detested one another because both were so different.</p><p>The eldest brother was the manifestation of all the good and beauty in the world; because of his infinite goodness, he was the most beautiful wizard of them all because his body was filled with the glow of radiant magic. His skin illuminated in the darkest of places, and his long flaxen hair was interwoven with strands of golden magic. His eyes are the color of the most vibrant indigo and his robes shown with a brightest metallic blue hue. Along with his stately height and powerful build, he garnered respect and awe from his magical peers. Many followed him and practiced the good magic that he kindly and patiently taught. It is said that no mortal could look directly into his face.</p><p>The other brother, the youngest, preferred things darker and more disharmonious; he surrounded himself in the darkest shadows, with vile creatures that lived in dank and murky places. But don't think him putrid and grotesque for the younger male had a darker more seductive beauty that wizards and witches alike were not familiar with and thus were not a keen to him as older brother. His dark hair blacker than black contested the dark sky along. His skin did not glow nor was it radiant. He was a male pale as the snow that fell in the winter nights. It frighten many around that he held such a strange and striking contrast in body. His eyes matched his hair and were feared for their intensity burning into your very soul.</p><p>It was due to those eyes that could see no lies that none of the wizards would look into his face, and it is said that those who lived a wicked life would see his face upon their death, causing a sense of despair and fear before entering the Land of the Dead.</p><p>Though he scared the other wizards and witches, he was cunning and very subtle, with sharp wit and a serpent's tongue. No one could talk more swiftly and convincingly. He could persuade many under his command, promising power over enemies and extravagant wealth. It was like he could see your hearts greatest desires. Because of this, many followed him into his darkness.</p><p>It wasn't long before the differences between the brothers became loathing. The two began to duel openly and they shared many harsh words. The strife between them had immense effect on the other wizards and witches.</p><p>The struggle between the two soon caused enmity within the other wizards and witches as well. Wizards and witches choose sides to fight against and fight for. Thus, the armies of the light and dark were created.</p><p>For the side of the right, the magnificent and magnanimous Godric, also called Gryffindor, stands as the champion of the light. The name Gryffindor was given to him by his followers in honor of his royal crest of the griffin, a majestic and noble animal typically having the head, forepart, and wings of an eagle and the body, hind legs, and tail of a lion. For those who practice light magic and who are considered peaceful creatures, he became the ruler and Wizard King of Radiance. Only the brave and daring can call themselves his true followers.</p><p>The chief commander of Godric's army is his only son and heir Albus Dumbledore. Though Dumbledore looked like a frail old man, his looks are quite deceiving; his gift, from his father Godric, is the ability of shape-shifting which is the skill of changing one's appearance and shape without a magical wand. Due to Dumbledore's harmless appearance, many light creatures, especially the woodland elves, fought for Godric. Because of Dumbledore's magnitude of magical power, the side of the light often had many victories.</p><p>But, there were also many defeats…</p><p>The sly, villainous and cunning younger brother of Godric is Salazar, who is called Slytherin because he is often compared to the slithering of a sneaky snake. His royal crest was that of a fierce basilisk, a large snake with fatal breath and glance. Those who follow the Wizard King of Shadows are always those who are cunning and gifted in the art of dark magic.</p><p>Like Gryffindor, Slytherin's son and heir, who is called the Dark Lord Voldemort, commanded his evil armies. As his father, Voldemort placed fear in the hearts of their allies and enemies alike because of his horrific deformity and obvious cruelty.</p><p>Because Salazar consumed snake venom on a regular basis, his son took the appearance of a snake-man. Voldemort's nose was slit as a snake's and his tongue was forked. His skin was as white as bone and it was stretched across his hairless, emaciated body. The most terrifying aspect of his physical features was his eyes; unlike his father's black eyes, Voldemort's eyes burned with an angry red that pierced the hearts of those who looked upon them.</p><p>The brutal wars between the light and dark raged on with no clear sign of who would prove victorious. It was only when the side of the light lost its most powerful supporter and the dark got its most ferocious ally that the dark seemed to have the upper hand…</p><p>At one point it seemed that the light would win the final battle, especially with the help of the woodland elves of Greenwood forest (or sometimes called the Forbidden forest by the dark supporters), under the command of Elven King James. Though the elves were mostly peaceful people, Dumbledore convinced James to ally himself with Godric and the side of the light. The elven king, who had befriended Dumbledore, offered his aid and the finest elven warriors of Greenwood.</p><p>Voldemort was not happy with the allegiance of James and vowed revenge on the elven king. With the help of many spies, Voldemort found James' weak spot….his beautiful wife Lillian.</p><p>When James' was off fighting in the war, Voldemort found a way to sneak into the Great Hall of Greenwood and kidnap the wife of his foe. Poor Queen Lily was taken from her home and was locked away in the Chamber of Secrets, the dark's stronghold. When James found out that his love was taken from Greenwood, he immediately pulled out of the war, and used his soldiers to find his beloved wife.</p><p>Voldemort had planned on torturing Lily, and killing her, but he found that he could not. Lily was the most beautiful elven maiden that he had ever seen, and he soon lusted after her fiercely. Lily, being a very cunning lady, used flattery and flirting and managed to convince Voldemort to set her free. Finding that Lily was unable to resist, Voldemort let her go, but his mind was ever plagued with perverse and lustful thoughts of her.</p><p>Though the Dark Lord agreed to let her go, he could not bear the thought of her going back to James, so he did one of the most immoral and despicable things he had ever done. He cursed her with infertility so that she would not bear a child for James.</p><p>When James and his wife finally reunited, he was saddened to find that she would not barren.</p><p>Feeling betrayed by Dumbledore for not helping in the search for his wife, James vowed to never fight the dark again unless they breached his woodlands.</p><p>This was a large blow to the side of the light especially when the dark obtained the Death Eaters or the Vampires.</p><p>Voldemort, knowing James' refusal to fight, spent most of his time recruiting creatures to the aid of Salazar. With much effort and many empty promises, the Dark Lord convinced the cold king of the immortal vampires, Lucius Malfoy, to join the Slytherins. The real reason why Malfoy joined battle is unknown, however it was rumored the Dark Lord promised the vampires the blood of those they killed from the side of the light, Voldemort called them his Death Eaters. Salazar and Voldemort found that having vampires at their side was very profitable, especially with Lucius as the Vampiric King. Lucius was ruthless and cunning, and his vampire armies were the same.</p><p>It seemed that everything was going well for the Slytherins when what seemed as the Final Battle (now called The Great Battle) took place. The fighting spread through the entire land. Because of the vicious fighting of the Slytherins, the Gryffindor forces were being pushed back until the fighters breached the edge of Greenwood. King James, seeing that the fighters were violating his borders, begrudgingly called forth his elven army and marched into battle, leaving a very worried Queen Lily behind.</p><p>The Great Battle was soon fought vigorously in the land of the Greenwood Elves. All seemed hopeless for the Gryffindors, especially when Salazar himself joined the fray.</p><p>With his slender black wand in one hand and a mighty emerald encrusted battle-axe in the other, the Wizard King of Shadows, covered in his thick coat of darkness, slaughtered many elves, men, and wizards. It was only when all hope was lost that the Savior of the Light, Godric Gryffindor, made his way into the battle.</p><p>Before that moment, no one had looked onto the face of Godric. His beautiful form shown bright was a radiant light of determination, as he glided gracefully to his evil brother. In Godric's hand was his elven made sword with a large ruby encrusted at the hilt as well as his long, amber wand. As the two siblings faced each other, the battleground of Greenwood fell silent.</p><p>No one moved or said a word as the two brothers dueled each other with their hand weapons. Bright magical colors blasted from the tips of their weaponry, illuminating the dark forest of the woodland elves. The magical energy seeping through the two made the air heavy and stifling. For what seemed like hours, the two shot spells at each other tirelessly.</p><p>What happened next no one could anticipate…</p><p>It is said that magical siblings share the same core of magic that usually cancel each other out by combining the sibling's magical energy together when their spells meet. Sometimes, during rare occasions, when the spells of siblings meet, if the force and power is great, the combined magical energy will amplify causing a great surge of force. In even more rare situations, depending on the strength of the spell, a combined spell can react together to form a different spell that is totally unintended….</p><p>The armed forces of Greenwood watched in trepidation as the jade light that flashed from Salazar's Axe met the pure white light from the Sword of Gryffindor.</p><p>As the magic combined, a rush of energy swept through the battlefield, causing a bright light to glow blindingly through the forest. All the armies were blown to the ground by the power of the spells that ricocheted from its casters. Many of the trees in the forest were blown from their roots and some caught on fire. The palace of King James, though it stood several miles away from the battle, quaked due to the rebounded spell.</p><p>Because both forces were knocked to the ground and blinded by the spells' light, they did not see what had happened to their beloved leaders. All they found left was their wands, the Axe of Slytherin, and the Sword of Gryffindor.</p><p>Finding their leader had disappeared, the dark army retreated back to safety quickly, far away from the Gryffindors. While everyone ran in total chaos, Voldemort had time to acquire the axe and wand of his father and the Sword of Gryffindor. Though Godric's sword burned the Dark Lord's flesh painfully at the touch, he took up the sword and apparated away from the battlefield before Dumbledore realized the sword was gone….</p><p>Hundreds of years passed after the Great Battle, and no one had seen or heard from either Salazar or Godric. Thus, the dark and the light had reached a stalemate, waiting for the right time to strike.</p><p>During the years of relative peace, the Kingdom of Greenwood became a gloomy and quiet place. No more could the songs and laughter of the elves be heard. There were no more parties and balls held for the gracious king and his beautiful queen. The sadness of King James and Queen Lily was infinite and it affected all around them; the two wanted so much to have a child.</p><p>Throughout the years, Dumbledore watched sadly as the once proud kingdom of Greenwood fell under the sadness of the king and queen. Albus felt partly responsible for the grief because he had not helped James find Lillian when Voldemort abducted her. But he continued to watch Slytherin's side quietly.</p><p>After much thought about how to help the elven rulers, Albus did the only thing that he could think of to make Lily fertile again; he used the wand of his father Godric to undo the curse of Voldemort. Knowing that his own wand could not negate the damage that the Dark Lord caused, Dumbledore surmised that the only wand powerful enough to reverse the sterility curse was that of Gryffindor.</p><p>Though Dumbledore was unsure how using Gryffindor's wand would affect Lily or the baby, he performed the reversal curse so that James and Lily could conceive, and thus, he gained the friendship of James again….</p><p>Nine months later, the kingdom of Greenwood rejoiced in the birth of Prince Harry, who was born from the love of Lily and James.</p><p>Of all the elves ever born throughout every elven kingdom of the world, Harry was the most beautiful and graceful of them all….</p>
