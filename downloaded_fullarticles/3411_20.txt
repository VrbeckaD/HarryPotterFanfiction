    <p align="center">~MAY 1976~</p><p>James nudged him with his shoulder. “How’d you like it?”</p><p>Sirius grinned. Getting detention was worth it, even if it was for the rest of the school year. He relayed this to James, who laughed.</p><p>“At the very least, you got some new wank material.”</p><p>“Yup,” Sirius agreed.</p><p>Severus, those silver boxers…he repressed a delighted shiver. Half of him wanted to just crawl on top of him and grind down. Especially given how he could sort of make the outline of his cock through them. Not to mention those long legs…</p><p>“Mate, you’re drooling,” James said, nudging him again.</p><p>Sirius blushed and wiped his mouth. “Sorry, Prongs.”</p><p>“Don’t worry about it,” James said, wrapping his arm around Sirius’ shoulders. “Severus knows it’s just teasing.” Remus sighed, shaking his head.</p><p>“I wouldn’t be so sure,” he said. James and Sirius turned to him. Sirius was confused.</p><p>“What’choo mean, Moony?” he asked.</p><p>“Just that, after a while, the teasing just builds up and gets more intense and what we’re doing to him now is just bullying, isn’t it? This was the worst of what you’ve done to him so far. What if you just, either today or before, pushed him to the breaking point and he chooses Regulus?”</p><p>James laughed. “You’re kidding right? Reggie and Sev? C’mon, they might be in the same house, but Severus and Sirius are just meant to be. Don’t pay attention to him, Sirius. He already chose you ages ago, I’m sure of it.”</p><p>Sirius managed a smile. “Right,” he said. <em>But if he did chose me…he hasn’t said anything to me yet.</em> He glanced at Remus, who arched a brow.</p><p><em>You know he has the right to change his mind</em>, he seemed to say.</p><p>“I’m going to make sure he’s not still mad at us,” he said, heading in the other direction. “I’ll see you in a bit.” With that, he ran, barely noticing the retort James sent to Remus about Sirius’ anxiety.</p><p>
  <em>He knows I love him. He must know. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Does he though?</em>
</p><p>Such thoughts plagued him on the way to the dungeons where the Slytherin corridor was. He knew it was a wall…somewhere…he’d been around here before to visit both Severus and Regulus, so his presence wasn’t entirely…</p><p>A third year girl was about to enter, so Sirius called to her, asking her to get Severus for him. She frowned at him, then went inside. A few minutes later—enough to make Sirius fear that he wouldn’t emerge—Severus stepped out of the common room.</p><p>“What?” he said. Harsh enough to make Sirius almost wince.</p><p>“Just…you know it was just a joke, right? What we did?”</p><p>Severus’ inhaled deeply.</p><p>“Sev?”</p><p>He turned around, as if to go back inside, then faced Sirius again. “I guess you deserve to know, and since you’re here I might as well tell you now. I chose Regulus.”</p><p>Sirius blinked. “What?”</p><p>“I’m going to ask Regulus to marry me when he graduates, Sirius. Okay?”</p><p>“But…I love you.”</p><p>“Then why do keep hurting me? You’ve not been even a friend to me in the last five years and I really wish I understood why. I can’t take you hurting me anymore, Sirius. This is it. I’m done trying to understand why you hurt me so much.”</p><p>Sirius took his hands, breathing shakily. “Sev, I’ll stop. I’ll tell James to stop. Just…choose me. I loved you since we were kids. Don’t…don’t marry my brother. There’s still time. Right? You’re not seventeen yet, so there’s time. I…I’m sorry, Babe.”</p><p>“Don’t call me that.”</p><p>“Severus, please,” Sirius said, unable to fight his tears any longer. “I love you, and I’m sorry. I’m a tosser, I get that, but I never meant to hurt you.”</p><p>“But you did, Sirius. So many times. You’ll find someone else, okay? You’re free, think of it that way. You can marry whomever you want.”</p><p>“I want <em>you</em>,” Sirius said.</p><p>Severus pulled out of his grasp. “Regulus doesn’t hurt me like you do. You know, I thought I would choose you, too, one day. I’m done hoping that you’d grow up and realize that what you take as just a joke hurts me. There’s only so much abuse a person can take. That’s why my mother did what she did.”</p><p>“I know, but don’t break my heart. Please.”</p><p>“You broke mine long before today. Stopped being a friend ages ago and became someone I hardly recognize. Yeah, sure, you were the eight-year-old who was terrified of his father, but loved <em>The Hardy Boys</em> and <em>The Boxcar Children</em> so much he didn’t care of the consequences as long as he could get his hands on them. You were the same kid that was always so curious about Disney that he snuck out to see <em>The Jungle Book</em> with me, knowing what could have happened if his parents found out. You were my first kiss and maybe you thought you might be in love with me then, Sirius, but you’ve not really been that kid in a long time. I’m not sure what happened to him, but once we started school here, you changed into someone I don’t recognize. That child was someone I might’ve seen myself having a future with. But I’ve not seen that side of you in a long time.”</p><p>Sirius bowed his head, still crying. He looked up again, hands lax at his sides. “Let me show you I’ve not really changed. Please, Severus. Give me another chance. I don’t know how many you’ve given me, but please give me one more chance to show you I can be the man you want.”</p><p>Severus exhaled. “No,” he said. “I’m not going to do that. I made my choice, and I have to say thanks for making it so easy after today. I’m done. I can’t love you, Sirius. Maybe one day, we can be friends again, but till then, I can’t say even like you. I don’t hate you. I did at first for a long time when you started being a complete wanker. Now it’s just…numbness when it’s you. Numbness and anger. I don’t even feel afraid with Regulus as I do now with you when you and your friends corner me.”</p><p>Sirius leaned against the wall, defeated. He couldn’t even speak for the thickness in his throat made it difficult to even <em>breathe</em>. Perhaps if Severus kissed him once more…He didn’t, though, reentering Slytherin common room. The door shut with a thud and then it was just a wall again. Sirius closed his eyes, focused on breathing and forced himself to move his legs so to get back to his dorm.</p><p>Once finally back in the common room, James and Remus approached. “Are you all right?” Remus asked. Sirius shook his head, fresh tears spilling down his cheeks. They went up stairs to their room and sat on Sirius’ bed. Sirius hugged his pillow to muffle his sobs.</p><p>“What happened?” James asked.</p><p> “Remus was right,” he said. “You were right.”</p><p>“I didn’t want to be,” Remus said softly. “I’m sorry Sirius.”</p><p>“Was it because of today?”</p><p>“Not just that. He told me it was before…I don’t know when I lost him. I just…don’t…James, Remus…I can’t watch him marry Regulus. I can’t…”</p><p>“Maybe if we leave him alone, he’ll calm down enough to rethink it,” James said. “He knows how you feel, doesn’t he? Maybe he’s just angry and wanted to hurt you like we hurt him today.”</p><p>Sirius shook his head. “I don’t think so. I hope so, but I don’t think so.”</p><p>Remus and James exchanged a glance. “Any ideas?” he asked.</p><p>“We’ll need to talk to Lily. She’s Severus’ friend, so maybe she can help?”</p><p>“Well that depends on whether or not she’ll want to. He did cross a line himself as far as she’s concerned,” Remus said. “So maybe I’ll talk to her,” he said. “She might not want anything to do with you two right now.”</p><p>“Good idea.” James patted Sirius’ knee. “We’re going to fix this mess, Padfoot. He’ll reconsider it. He loved you before. He’ll love you again before term ends.”</p><p>“That’s in two weeks, Prongs,” Remus said. “That’ might not be possible.”</p><p>“We’ll see,” James said. He got off the bed. “I’m going to go ask Lily for help.”</p><p>“I don’t think Lily wants anything to do with you right now.”</p><p>“This isn’t about her and me. This is about Severus and Sirius, and getting them together.” With that, he left, feet pounding on the stairs. Remus shook his head.</p><p>“He’s insane,” he muttered. “But I think James sort of also feels responsible for Severus breaking up with you.” Sirius shut his eyes.</p><p>“He couldn’t break up with me if we never really dated,” Sirius reminded him. Remus squeezed his shoulder. “We were just childhood friends…the day we met…he was kind, patient, even kind of cute, back then. Sure, he isn’t much to look at now, but he was always so…Remus what if we can’t get him to change his mind about marrying my brother?”</p><p>“Give it a little more than a few hours,” Remus said. “You’ve been in love with him as long as we’ve known you. He used to give you the same look you have whenever we talk about him. I mean, dude, you’re crazy about him. I’m sure he knows that.”</p><p>The doors slammed open and Lily strode inside. James followed.</p><p>“So all this time you’ve been cruel to him is because you like him?”</p><p>“Love,” James corrected.</p><p>Lily sat on the bed. “Tell me everything, Black. All I’ve got right now is that you’re just an immature child pulling Sev’s proverbial pigtails. If you want to fix this, I need to really understand what exactly is going on between your family and his.”</p><p>Sirius nodded, lowering the pillow. Lily’s sternness softened a bit and she summoned tissues.</p><p align="center">~MARCH 1968~</p><p>The last straw was when Eileen found her son bloody and bruised after she’d gone out for groceries. Toby and a friend were drinking and laughing in the living room while Severus shivered in the corner of the kitchen. Eileen knelt down by him.</p><p>“Severus?”</p><p>He whimpered, shying away from her touch.</p><p>Eileen never considered herself a strong woman.</p><p>The way Toby treated her was…well, she had done what she could to fight, especially earlier in their relationship as he “tamed” her. He made her believe she deserved to be beaten, deserved to be raped, shared…</p><p>But this?</p><p>He never hurt Severus physically before. Never let his friends hurt him before.</p><p>She did all she could to ensure that the worst of the abuse was reserved for her.</p><p>But now?</p><p>She needed to get her son away. She clenched her hands into fists and the cupboards shuddered as her pent-up rage was released through her magic. Eileen stood and approached where her wand had been locked away. It slid open and she grabbed her wand.</p><p>With a wave, a meal was made fairly quickly, but she waited to serve it, quickly mixing one of the deadliest poisons she could create.</p><p>Severus remained in the corner, watching her with curiosity and fear. Once the poison was finished, Eileen dripped the clear liquid onto the food she’d made for the men in the room. She pressed her finger to her lips, warning Severus to remain silent and took the meal to the living room, wand left on the counter.</p><p>She ignored the men telling them she’d be back with more rum. She heard them tear into the food and moved through the motions of getting them more alcohol as they choked.</p><p>The doors burst open and Toby glared at her, pointing at his throat as vomit dripped out of his mouth. He fell, gasping and wheezing.</p><p>Eileen grabbed her wand and waved it.</p><p>“<em>Pack</em>,” she said.</p><p>Her belongings and Severus’ came down stairs, stuffed into one trunk before she approached her son and lifted him up. Toby collapsed, life stolen out of his body. Eileen pocketed her wand, and lifted the trunk with more ease than she expected.</p><p>Severus was long past the age of needing to be carried, but Eileen didn’t care. Given his state, neither did he. Out on the street, she let go of her trunk long enough to stick her wand out, summoning the Knight Bus.</p><p>“I’ve an emergency,” she said before the conductor could speak—if he could, given how stunned he was to see her carrying a battered eight-year-old. “I need to get to St. Mungos immediately.”</p><p>Once settled, the conductor gave the driver instructions and they sped off to London.</p><p>“What happened to your boy?” an old witch asked, horror in her voice.</p><p>Eileen squeezed Severus a little tighter as if any chance of loosening her hold on him would allow him to slip through the cracks. “Monsters,” she said.</p><p>The bus screeched to a stop and the Conductor grabbed the trunk for Eileen as she strode inside, shouting for a healer.</p><p align="center">#</p><p>“He has multiple lacerations, a broken nose, the left femur is broken, four broken ribs, and his larynx is bruised. There is no other severe internal damage at this moment from what we can tell, though the damage from the injuries to his stomach could worsen, but we’ll keep an eye on that…We’ll give him a small dose of skelegro for the teeth that were knocked out. All of his injuries will be healed in a few more hours, but emotional and psychological damage could take longer,” the healer said.</p><p>“Is there any damage that may relate to a…a sexual attack?”</p><p>“No,” the healer said.</p><p>Eileen exhaled, relieved.</p><p>“Nothing of that matter happened from what we could tell. The worst from what I can tell thus far is what happened to his neck, but given a couple days, he’ll be able to talk again.” The healer shook her hand and walked away, allowing her a moment with Severus.</p><p>She took his hand in hers. “You’re going to be okay, sweetie,” she said. “Toby can’t hurt you anymore and we’re going to figure out what to do.”</p><p>Two knocks were her only warning before the door opened again. Eileen kissed his fingers and she turned to face the healer—</p><p>“Walburga?”</p><p>“I saw the name ‘Prince’ on this door and was curious,” she said. “It’s been a while, Eileen. I heard you ran away and married some <em>Muggle</em>.”</p><p>“If not for my son, it would be the biggest mistake of my life,” she said. “As it is, I love my child and am not ashamed to say that I would do anything for him.”</p><p>She didn’t want to tell Walburga that she committed murder just a few hours ago in the name of protecting her son.</p><p>Walburga hummed and approached the bed.</p><p>Eileen swallowed. “What of my parents? My brother?”</p><p>“Unfortunately, all dead. No heirs. Till now,” Walburga said. “Being half-Muggle, he isn’t capable of bearing, is he?”</p><p>“Of course not. Can we not talk about that in front of my child?”</p><p>Walburga brushed a strand of hair behind his ear and Severus flinched a bit. She clicked her tongue.</p><p>“Poor boy,” she said. “But you’re strong, I see. You’re Mummy and I will be out in the hall for a moment.” With that, the regal witch strode to the door and Eileen followed, shutting the door.</p><p>“What are you planning, Walburga?”</p><p>“Planning? Always so suspicious, Ravenclaws. You and your son are the last of the Prince line, so for that line to live on, your boy will one day must marry,” Walburga said. “Better yet to marry someone suited to his family’s legacy. Both of my sons can bear children and he’s the same age as my eldest, Sirius. And Sirius has begun showing interest in the male sex. A crush here, a longing there. It’s quite adorable. I think your son would be a perfect match. My youngest, Regulus, is seven now. What his preference is yet hasn’t been determined, but he is capable bearing children as well. Both of my boys are handsome and hale and strong in magic. I could tell that your son is the same. He’s not a squib, that’s for sure. Of course, we’ll let your boy choose which of my sons he’d like to marry, we’ve some years before we need really plan a wedding.”</p><p>Eileen crossed her arms, staring at the ground.</p><p>“Think of it,” Walburga continued. “The Princes and the Blacks: family at long last. As it always should have been. I will help you regain your wealth, your house, and your dignity, Eileen, if you agree. In fact, I’ll even pay for your son’s medical needs.”</p><p>“You would have me indebted to you.”</p><p>“Eileen, I’m indebted to <em>you</em>,” Walburga said. “If you had not run away and disgraced yourself, I wouldn’t be with Orion now. I used to hate you because you were his betrothed. But now, we have the chance what his mother desired: the union of our families. Your son will be able to carry on the Prince line and whichever of my sons he does not choose will continue the Black line. Eileen, think about it at least. I will still pay for your son’s medical bills as an act of good faith.”</p><p>“I will need to think about it,” Eileen said. “Three days? Severus is a child, but he is smart and given what just happened, I don’t want him to think I’m making a decision for him.”</p><p>“Of course. Meet me at Rosa Lee’s for tea in three days.” Walburga took Eileen’s shoulders and kissed her cheeks. “If you’ll excuse me, Eileen, I am needed at Regulus’ bedside. Mumblemumps, poor boy. Ta.”</p><p>Walburga strode past Eileen and once alone again, she sighed.</p><p>
  <em>What do I do?</em>
</p><p align="center">#</p><p>Severus remained silent even after his throat had healed, going into a state of muteness. The healer poked at his previous injuries, trying to gauge if further healing was needed. Assured there was not, he left and Eileen sat at the end of the bed.</p><p>“Sweetie, the woman who came in yesterday was an old school mate from Hogwarts,” she said. “And she made us an offer that I want you to be aware of.”</p><p>Severus nodded and crossed his legs, watching her carefully. Eileen sighed and told him her past, why she ran away, why she married his father at first, why she let him treat them so cruelly till the previous day, and what might happen next.</p><p>After that, she explained that some pure bloods, especially those so pure of blood that they have inbred with each other, can have sons that are capable of getting pregnant. She told him about Walburga’s sons and how they had this ability.</p><p>Only then, once certain he really understood, did she explain Walburga’s offer.</p><p>Severus blinked, staring at his feet.</p><p>“You have time to decide which of her sons you’d like to marry if we do this, but I don’t want you agreeing without knowing what you’re agreeing to. Walburga is still going to help us with your medical bills, and after that, we’ll go from there…”</p><p>“I don’t have to choose which of them I want to marry now?” he asked, voice croaky.</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“But I’d have to marry them if we’re going to survive?”</p><p>“You don’t have to anything you don’t want to do,” Eileen assured him. “If you don’t want to marry one of her sons, you don’t have to.”</p><p>“No, it’s not that,” he said, clearing his throat. “I…asked Toby about what being gay is like and I guess he assumed I was asking because I was one. But I don’t know if I am or not. I should’ve guessed he and John would beat me.”</p><p>“What they did was out of line.”</p><p>“So is what you did, Mom,” he reminded her. “You killed them.” Eileen took his hand in hers. “I get why you did it, Mom, but I don’t think most others are going to understand.”</p><p>“No, they’ll understand,” she said. “But I will likely be punished for it anyway because you’re right. I killed them and I might get sent to prison for that regardless of the reason.”</p><p>“If you think about it logically—”</p><p>“No. Honey, this isn’t about being logical or rational. It’s okay to act on your emotions.”</p><p>Severus swallowed. “I don’t know what I feel about it. I can’t even <em>think</em> about getting married to even a girl, let alone another boy, even one who can get pregnant or imagine having children myself. I think…I think if I’m feeling anything, it’s nervous or anxious. But even then isn’t it better to marry someone you know? And when we’re old enough, maybe I’ll know which one of them I want to marry, right?”</p><p>“Right.”</p><p>He sniffed. “I’ll do it, Mom.”</p><p>“You understand that you can’t allow yourself to be tempted by another if we do agree, right?” Severus nodded. Eileen embraced him. “Honey, I’m sorry,” she said. “I wish I was stronger.” She kissed the top of his head and excused herself. Walburga walked toward her and smiled.</p><p>“Eileen.”</p><p>“We’ll do it,” she said. Walburga blinked. “He agreed to marry one of your sons once they’re of age.”</p><p>“Wonderful!” Walburga said. She embraced her. “You said his name was Severus, was it?”</p><p>“Severus Snape, though he might want to change it to Prince.”</p><p>“Severus Prince, Severus Snape, either way he is the sole, living patriarch of your line. Or will be when he’s seventeen.” Eileen hated the way this felt. She hated it when she was the one going through it and had vowed not to do it to her children if she could.</p><p>But here, her options severely limited, she was the one making the decision for her son, even if he told her he was okay with it.</p><p>“May I see him?” Walburga asked. Eileen nodded and followed her into the room. She stood to the side as Walburga embraced Severus and kissed his forehead.</p><p>“You’re a brave boy, Severus,” she said, “And a strong wizard.” She tapped her nose knowingly. “I can tell. You’ll make a fine husband for one of my children someday.” She kissed his cheek and then Eileen’s before leaving.</p><p>Mother and son glanced at each other. Severus bit his lip.</p><p>“Did I make the right decision?”</p><p>“I don’t know,” Eileen said. “But I do hope so, sweetheart.”</p><p align="center">#</p><p>It was nearly a week since the Eileen killed her husband.</p><p>So far, there was no indication that she would be arrested, but perhaps it would be a matter of time before anyone did notice. Or perhaps only Muggles were looking for her and Severus. She couldn’t be sure, but she couldn’t let Severus be the only other one who knew.</p><p>For now, she remained free, drinking tea with Orion and Walburga as the boys became acquainted in the living room playing a game of Exploding Snaps.</p><p>Their house elf, Kreacher, laid parchment, two quills and two inkwells on the table. Orion snapped his fingers and one of the quills stood, tip to the paper. An inkwell opened and it dipped the tip inside before returning to the paper and writing in loopy script:</p><p align="center">
  <em>~UNIFICATION AGREEMENT OF THE PRINCE AND BLACK FAMILIES~</em>
</p><p>The quill set itself back in the inkwell and laid there. Eileen snapped her own fingers and the second quill and inkwell came to life. Now they could begin.</p><p>“Walburga explained her offer, Eileen,” Orion said. “And while I’m not entirely keen, I can see what she does in respect of your boy, so as agreed, we will aid you and your son in whatever you need, beginning with your house and wealth.”</p><p>The Black’s quill jumped back to the parchment and wrote:</p><p align="center">
  <em>In exchange of the Noble House of Black aiding the House of Prince reclaim glory and dignity, the first born son of the Prince family will wed a direct descendant of the Black family.</em>
</p><p>Eileen nodded. “I agree to that term and would like to add that if there are unforeseen events, such as death or if some way, somehow I am unable to take care of my son, I know he’ll be cared for by you two.” Orion nodded and Eileen’s quill added the clause.</p><p>“Severus will have to choose which of our sons he will marry by his seventeenth birthday,” Walburga added. Orion and Eileen agreed.</p><p>“They marry before twenty-one,” Eileen said. “And an heir doesn’t need to be conceived before twenty-five.”</p><p>And on it went: expectations of Severus, expectations for whichever son he chooses—to be applied to both until he chooses one of them, consequences of unfaithfulness and disloyalty…</p><p>Eileen hated it when her parents did this to her, and now she couldn’t help hating herself as she did this to her son, even if he had consented. She didn’t think Severus really understood what he agreed to.</p><p>In the end, Orion gave Eileen her family’s ring and they pressed the seals to the paper, binding the agreement. “I do hope you keep to our arrangement this time around, Eileen,” Orion said.</p><p>Eileen closed her eyes and sighed, placing the ring on her left forefinger. “I don’t really have many options anymore,” she admitted.</p><p>She glanced at the boys in the living room. It was too early to tell what would happen, but at least they were getting along…</p><p>For now.</p>
