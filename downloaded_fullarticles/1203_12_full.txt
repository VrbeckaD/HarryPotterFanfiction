Harry wasn't allowed to live with him (since he wasn't all that sane) but he was allowed to visit. Sirius died in Harry's fifth year. Snape and Sirius never met and Harry never mentioned him outside of the usual 'that teacher hates my guts' to which Sirius gives (bad) advice until Harry changes the subject.

    <p>Harry was going to celebrate his one year anniversary with Severus Snape. Well, almost a year. Ok, close enough to a year. Fine. They had they been together for close to six months and Harry was in love. He thinks. He has (sort of) strong feelings for Severus in any case.</p>
<p>A case that he currently wouldn't like to be examined too closely as he's sat in Severus' quarters under his invisibility cloak waiting for the man himself. He's also spelled a barrage of things on/over himself just to make sure no one would be able to sense his presence (magical or otherwise) because he's only a lot cautious and technically a little underage. Which of course means a lot. As in he's sixteen turning seventeen this coming summer and Severus is his teacher and wow, he should stop thinking about it because the more he does, the worse it gets.</p>
<p>So what that they started to get closer when he was fifteen and still horribly messed up because Sirius had died and he needed support? Not that he's better now, mind, but he's gotten a better handle on his grief and he now understands that grieving for someone you love doesn’t have a set time frame or that the loss of that person will never really leave you. Severus was...just there for him. He had never expected it because they've never exactly had the best of relationships, but he seemed to get over that in order to support Harry in his time of need and now here they were.</p>
<p>Well, here he was, waiting for Severus to show up so he could spend some time with his boyfriend. Not that Severus actually <em>was</em> his boyfriend but that was kind of the point of him showing up here unexpectedly. To have that conversation because Harry figures he's ready for something more. At the moment they've only had a few kisses because Harry was still a little unnerved about the whole 'teacher' aspect. He's cautious ok? But not today! Today he's ready and he's in this thing, both feet jumping in the deep end.</p>
<p>He wants this with Severus. He wants the intimacy, the connection, the love, the family, the future, all with Severus. He's ready and he can't wait to share that with the man he loves very much. Probably loves. Possibly loves. Very much likes.</p>
<p>His thoughts are interrupted when he heard the door opening and two voices drift his way. His happiness quickly changed into a mild panic because Severus clearly had someone with him but he couldn't say anything because they were keeping their relationship a secret. And, you know, he's actually hiding and how do you jump out of thin air and then try the old 'so sorry, I only had a question' routine. He wondered if he should try to leave and come back later but this plan was quickly foiled when Severus entered his living room following closely by Malfoy's father, making the situation about a hundred times more awkward. This might just become one of his worst plans ever, and that includes the dragon incident in his first year.</p>
<p>“And he's doing well?” Malfoy asked Severus, his tone light but Harry caught a sharp look that indicated he cared about the answer.</p>
<p>“As adequate as always. If he wishes to pursue potions as a profession he'll need to put in more effort and stop starring at Potter, but I believe that's not his intention.”</p>
<p>“Starring at Potter?” Malfoy asked, although by his look he knew that that wasn't what Severus had meant.</p>
<p>“Becoming a potions master.” Severus stated, not noticing Malfoy's little twitch and leaving Harry wondering why Malfoy had twitched at all.</p>
<p>He suddenly thinks that this might turn out to be fun because neither man knows he's there and he gets to have some inside information on things to throw in little Malfoy's face. Not to mention that he can surprise Severus after Malfoy leaves and he can still carry on with his plans. Which of course means wait a little while because he’s not keen on letting Severus know he’s been here the whole time. He’s not an idiot, thanks.</p>
<p>Malfoy grunted, something that Harry thought was a little shocking from the way he presented himself. “He hasn't voiced any desire to me either, so I doubt it's on the list.”</p>
<p>“And Potter? Is he on the list?” Severus asked with a knowing smirk.</p>
<p>Harry frowned at that. Was there something going on here? List? What list? The list to murder through annoyance and bullying before they left Hogwarts? Knowing Malfoy junior that could actually be a thing.</p>
<p>Malfoy scowled at Severus. “Hardly. From what I can tell the boy won't look twice at Draco, or rather, what I frequently hear from Draco. He won't stop his incessant moaning of how he's never noticed.”</p>
<p>They were both silent for a heartbeat as they grimaced knowingly at how often Draco spoke of Harry. Or, that's what Harry figured since they both wore the exact same expression. Which led Harry to the obvious conclusion that they were both very much insane because he notices Malfoy every day. It’s a little hard to ignore someone throwing a hex your way after all.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, Narcissa seems to think it's precious and allows Draco to 'vent'.”</p>
<p>“I wouldn't worry about it for too long.” Severus said, smirking once more as he walked to a corner in the room that held some bottles of firewhiskey.</p>
<p>“Ah, yes. Your yearly 'project'. Have you bedded the boy yet?”</p>
<p>Harry's eyes widened in shock as his mouth dropped open. Wasn't their almost relationship supposed to be a secret? And was that a look of disgust on Malfoy's face? Hang on, yearly project? Bedded?! What the bloody hell was going on here? Why were they speaking of him like that? <em>Were</em> they speaking of him? Was Severus <em>cheating</em> on him?</p>
<p>“Sadly, no. It seems he's more of a prude than I had anticipated. I'm only thankful that Blakely and Potter overlapped enough that I was able to...take my enjoyment before this forced celibacy.” Severus said as he poured them both a generous amount of firewhiskey.</p>
<p>Overlapped? Blakely?? Harry was having a hard time understanding what was going on because whatever Malfoy and Severus were talking about was clearly something they spoke about often enough that neither of them needed more context, something that Harry desperately wished he had more of. At least he knew that Severus wasn't cheating on him and it was definitely about him. It wasn't as comforting as he had imagined it to be.</p>
<p>“Now, now, Severus, don't be shy. I'm sure the whores in Knockturn are more than satisfactory for your needs.”</p>
<p>Severus snorted and turned back to Malfoy with drinks in hand. “If I wanted a barrage of diseases perhaps.”</p>
<p>“There are potions for that.” Malfoy pointed out as he accepted a glass that Severus handed him.</p>
<p>“There are. They work perfectly as well.”</p>
<p>Malfoy laughed. “I knew you wouldn't stay celibate. What are you planning with the little Lord?”</p>
<p>Harry felt faint. What was going on? Little Lord? Sure, logically they hadn't said they were exclusive since that was what he wanted to talk to Severus about tonight, but hearing that he had gone to other people made him sick. Did he not care about Harry at all? When you want to be with someone you don't exactly fuck off to have sex with other people! Right? He should ask Hermione, she would know.</p>
<p>Severus' smile turned sharp. “After all these years, I will finally be able to crush Potter the way I've always wanted.”</p>
<p>Harry's world stopped and started so quickly that he felt physically ill. This was the confirmation he hadn't wanted to have. Severus was using him. Severus was using him and he didn't care at all about Harry. Was it all a lie? Why would he lie? Why would he do any of this? Why couldn't he breathe properly? Maybe it was a joke? Maybe he was just saying all of this to Malfoy to keep the man from saying anything? Severus wouldn't lie to Harry, would he? This was all a joke between them, it had to be, it <em>had</em> to be.</p>
<p>Malfoy's eyebrow rose at that statement and Harry wistfully, if detachedly, hoped he would one day have the same single eyebrow raising power. “I hope you realize they are not one and the same?”</p>
<p>Severus rolled his eyes. “Of course but the spawn does come from the father and looks practically like his double that it will satisfy me endlessly.”</p>
<p>“So you do have a plan.” Malfoy stated thoughtfully.</p>
<p>“I intend to ruin him.”</p>
<p>“He is a Lord.” Malfoy pointed out.</p>
<p>That was the second time they had said that. Harry wished he knew what that meant because he was sure he wasn't a Lord and they were making it out to be something important. Wouldn’t he have known something important like that?</p>
<p>He hated how it was said as if it was significant, hated how after almost six years in this new world he still didn't know anything about it. Spells and magic were great. The history (when not taught by Binns) was fascinating. The culture? The jobs? How he was going to survive outside of these walls in the 'real world'? He knew none of that. Why wasn't there someone who would help him with that? Wasn't that what a school was supposed to be for? Your future? And not that stupid ten minute career conversation he had had with professor McGonagall in fifth year, because who’s supposed to choose the rest of your life through bloody pamphlets of all things? Was there even a wizarding university? What about apprentices? He had so many questions!</p>
<p>Severus laughed and interrupted Harry's downward spiral and forced him back to the conversation.</p>
<p>“Only if he claims his Lordship and Black was so far gone he never mentioned it to the boy. Never mentioned anything important and never trained him in the ways of our world.”</p>
<p>Malfoy frowned at that. “How do you know that? I didn't realize you knew Black was the boy's godfather.”</p>
<p>“I've questioned the boy myself. He has no idea of his heritage or his power. Once he turns seventeen and he doesn't claim his Lordship...” Severus left off with a shrug and a sharper smile. “I knew because it was all over the papers at the time, it was rather hard to miss. Besides, the knowledge that the mutt is twisting in his grave at what I'm doing to his godson is quite the reward.”</p>
<p>Harry was only viciously glad that he hadn't actually done anything with Severus because the levels of betrayal he was currently feeling would only have made him feel more devastated than he already was. He just couldn't handle or understand what he was hearing. Was this real? This didn’t seem like an inside joke anymore and the more he heard, the worse it got. Why did he still have hope that it was all a joke and that they knew he was in the room? He didn't want to know more, didn't want to know the magnitude of betrayal, ignorance, and pure stupidity that had led him here.</p>
<p>How was he supposed to just walk away from all of this? From <em>Severus</em>? From the man who had shown him kindness when no one had cared, the man who had shown him what a kiss really was, what it felt like to want to spend time with someone you were falling for, the man who had accepted him at his best and worst and had helped him even when he denied needing help.</p>
<p>Was he even allowed to ask questions? Demand answers? Why had Severus done this to him? Was it all just a game? Had he deliberately chosen Harry so he could ‘ruin’ him?</p>
<p>Harry held back a sob through sheer power of will. How was he supposed to survive this?</p>
<p>“It is illegal to withhold knowledge of this magnitude.” Malfoy pointed out with a small frown, ignoring what Severus had said about Sirius.</p>
<p>Why did Severus even know about Sirius? Sure he had helped Harry work through his passing, but both of them made it seem like it had been more than that, as if Severus would have known Sirius outside of Harry. That wasn’t right, though, Severus would have said something. Unless…unless that’s how Severus had started. Unless that’s how- Harry gagged at the thought. He couldn’t go down that road right now, not while he was still in the open and vulnerable. Not when they were still providing damning evidence.</p>
<p>Severus hummed. “Perhaps. However, it is neither my duty nor my place to inform him.”</p>
<p>“You are his teacher, never mind his...significant other.” Malfoy stated in a delicate sort of way.</p>
<p>“I will admit to being his teacher, but I'm not in a relationship with him.”</p>
<p>“Would he say that?” Malfoy challenged, and Harry wondered how it could possibly be challenged. He hadn't read the signals wrong had he? Severus may have planned this, but you couldn’t fake emotions like that. Could you?</p>
<p>“He's an obsessed student, wallowing in his grief for the only magical family member he has ever had and misconstrued our relationship”. Severus stated as he spread his palms in a 'what can you do' way.</p>
<p>Harry stared blankly at the man he thought he had known so well. Who was standing in front of him now and twisting everything they had had so well. Who was making their relationship into something dark and sick and disgusting. How had it gotten so far? How had Harry allowed this to happen? Had he missed the signs? How could he have possibly been so…so <em>blind</em> of Severus’ true intentions?</p>
<p>“And if they demand memories?” Malfoy asked.</p>
<p>“Mine are just as real as his.”</p>
<p>The frown was back. “What, exactly, do you intend to do?”</p>
<p>“Ruin him.” Severus stated with a grin so large it hurt Harry to see. The man he had come to see today, to confess his feelings to, wasn’t the man in front of him right now. The man in front of him now was a vile, disgusting, evil man who cared nothing for Harry.</p>
<p>“So you've said. That's not easily done. The boy is the darling of the wizarding world.”</p>
<p>“He's the darling who has become obsessed with his potions professor and sent him several racy pictures. Who has sent his professor love notes.”</p>
<p>Ok now, that was a gross exaggeration, Harry thought appalled. Racy pictures? He sent the man <em>one</em> picture of him laughing (a picture that Colin had taken of him some time ago that he'd really liked) because the man had asked for it and he had put it in a box with other things and even said he’d treasure it. Although, now that he thought about it without looking at it through his relationship eyes, a student sending his teacher a picture was...odd. It was in no way racy and it wouldn't hurt his reputation in any way (just his pride) but he suddenly understood how easy it was to change the narrative. How it would be so easy to make Harry believe one thing while Severus' own actions would show another. How easy it had been to maneuver Harry into this position. He felt stupid and used and naive. He should have known better! Why didn't he know better? How could he have missed the signs? The man <em>must</em> have slipped once or twice. Had Harry really been so self-absorbed that he hadn’t noticed a thing?</p>
<p>“Who is <em>underage</em>.” Malfoy stressed, seemingly a little concerned. Though what he was concerned about was beyond Harry at that moment.</p>
<p>Severus shrugged in disregard and didn't see the flash of disgust come over Malfoy's face again. “Once it comes out how deep his obsession has gone, no one will want the boy.”</p>
<p>“You may damage him socially, but he will eventually recover.” Malfoy pointed out.</p>
<p>“Perhaps on the surface. I intend to have the boy fall in love with me.”</p>
<p>Harry felt tears silently fall down his face as the implications hit him hard. It had been a game, all of it, every single second, every touch, every gesture, a game. He wanted to ruin Harry, make him pay for some unknown reason and to do it all, he needed Harry to fall in love with him. He was glad, suddenly fiercely glad, that he had come tonight and had heard it straight from Severus himself. He doubted he would have believed it if it had been anyone else. Glad that he never even had the chance to tell the man intent on ruining him that his plans were working. He had been so stupid, so so unbelievably stupid!</p>
<p>Malfoy suddenly became still. “Ah. You intend to damage him emotionally.”</p>
<p>“I intend to humiliate him as his father humiliated me. If the brat thinks I could ever love him,” Severus smiled, “well, who's to say otherwise?”</p>
<p>“Severus.” Malfoy started, uneasily. “He's a boy, not much older than Draco. Younger, if I remember correctly.”</p>
<p>Severus became angry. “You never had a problem with my earlier trysts.”</p>
<p>“You've never intended to damage them in such a way.”</p>
<p>“The boy deserves it!”</p>
<p>“His father deserves it.” Malfoy stressed, and boy did Harry not see that coming.</p>
<p>Was the man actually trying to help? Well, help was a rather broad term, but it seemed to him like he didn't exactly agree with what was going on. From the conversation earlier, that was quite the upheaval.</p>
<p>Severus sneered. “He may as well be his father. He's as arrogant, as stupid, as bullying, as that git.”</p>
<p>“And what of Lily?” Malfoy asked, changing the subject slightly.</p>
<p>“What of Lily?” He snapped.</p>
<p>“If I do recall how one makes a child, the mother is responsible for a great deal.”</p>
<p>“The only good thing she gave him are his eyes.” Severus said dismissively.</p>
<p>The man didn't care about him. Harry closed his eyes as his heart thudded in his chest and his world collapsed around him. His <em>eyes</em>? That's the only thing Severus liked about him? Something that happened to be his mother's too? This didn't make any sense! They had been secretly almost-dating for six months and Severus had nothing good to say about him in all that time? Arrogant? Stupid? A bully? Did Severus even know him at all? It became clearer with every word spoken that he had never known who the real Severus was.</p>
<p>And his father. His father!</p>
<p>Knowing the reason that Severus hated him so much he was willing to ruin Harry’s life didn’t help Harry in the least. Harry had never known his father, had no memories of the man. Only pictures and stories others would occasionally tell him in an off-hand sort of way. So the knowledge that it was his father at the heart of all of it? Why did Severus even care? The man was dead. Had been for over a decade and had absolutely no relevance to their relationship. Why did he have relevance in Severus’ life? What was so…important, so vital that Severus was willing to break one person’s entire existence over a dead man? Why was it necessary to punish Harry for something his <em>very dead</em> father had done? Something Harry couldn’t even ask about!</p>
<p>He should probably stop saying 'Severus' he realized. This was far too much information for him to process tonight, far too much emotion for him to shift through. He looked up at Sev-Snape, looked up and watched him, his movements, his dismissive gestures whenever Harry’s name came up, the refusal to use his name.</p>
<p>Well, Harry thought as he tried to pull himself together, Snape was right about one thing: Harry had fallen for the man and he was distraught. He couldn't for the life of him imagine what this would feel like on top of Snape revealing his lies to the world.</p>
<p>If there was one thing he was infinitely grateful for right at this very moment, it was that he was intensely private person. Nobody knew of his 'relationship' with Snape, no one knew he was even <em>in</em> a bloodly relationship. Well, Hermione might have an idea but he was sure no one else did.</p>
<p>Harry knew he couldn't sit here and break down but he couldn't make himself move. He couldn't feel anything except devastation and loss and so much hurt. Why didn't Snape like him? Didn't those hours together mean anything? Didn't their kisses mean anything to him? Didn't Harry's heart mean anything to him? Why was he doing this? Why wasn't Harry enough for him? Oh god, he felt sick. Snape had lied to him and the man wasn't even finished playing his twisted game with Harry. Merlin, what was he going to do?</p>
<p>First thing first: compartmentalize. He could break down later, but the most essential issue now was to leave. He looked around the room he had spent hours in, had memories of moments he thought he would cherish forever and realized that he couldn't actually leave. There was only one very shut door in and out of the room and neither Malfoy nor Snape seemed in any hurry to part ways. In fact, as Harry tuned back into the conversation, it seemed that they intended to stay for a while yet.</p>
<p>Which didn't suit him at all. Merlin but did he not want to be in this room right now.</p>
<p>He spent the next few minutes going over all of his possible escape scenarios (all of which ended with him getting caught or the good old 'ghost' routine that would never work), when there was a loud knocking on the door. Snape stood up with an exasperated grunt and an off-hand comment about annoying children. Sensing a way out (of this room at least and that was one step further than he had been and thus a win) he quickly followed Snape as he strode through his teacher's study and into his classroom where he opened the classroom door.</p>
<p>Harry inched his way around a looming and glaring potions professor as he barked at a terrified second year. The second year squeaked through an explanation as Harry judged Snape's distance from the door and the possibility that he could simply slip by the man. He grimaced in uncertainty because it would work, but he would have to twist into uncomfortable positions and he would need to do it quickly because Snape was rapidly losing patience with the poor terrified second year.</p>
<p>As Harry put his back to the wall next to the door and inched his way quickly around the door post so he could avoid hitting Snape in any way, he took a moment to ponder the fact that a second year Slytherin was practically too out-of-his-mind terrified to speak to his head of house. He knew without a doubt that Snape hated teaching and hated children in almost equal measure, but he had thought that he was at least...less horrible to his own house. It had always seemed that way to him at least, but that was probably mostly because he gave his students the most points. He had never actually observed the man interact with his students in a one-on-one situation.</p>
<p>Glancing at the second year, he realized neither of them were doing well when it came to Snape. Which really wasn't the best thought to be having when he was supposed to be focusing on his escape. Something that became instantly harder when the poor second year jumped a little as Snape barked out a sentence in a tone that scared even Harry and now he had to either jump out of the way and bump into the second year or have a door slam on half his body.</p>
<p>It wasn't even a choice.</p>
<p>He quickly jumped out of the doorway and did a dance he was extremely happy nobody could see to avoid the second year as the door slammed behind him. Of course it was just his luck that he couldn't actually completely miss the Slytherin and awkwardly bumped into him at the same time the door slammed shut. The resulting scream the poor Slytherin gave as Harry lurched into him was therefore mildly hidden by the slamming of the door and could be misconstrued as a scream of shock because of the aforementioned slamming door.</p>
<p>Harry collapsed on the stone floor in a sigh of great relief as he heard small feet run away from him before he realized he couldn't stay there. He gathered himself and made his way back to his common room, passing by the Slytherin he had frightened (guilt for frightening him had set in as the need for self-preservation wore off) he saw that a group of them had gathered together to comfort one of their own.</p>
<p>“I told you he wouldn't care!”</p>
<p>“Not now Lyra! Can't you see he needs a hug?”</p>
<p>“I thought he was supposed to care about us?”</p>
<p>“Didn't you hear the upper years? He hates us! It was stupid to even try.”</p>
<p>Harry turned a corner and the soft chattering became a low hum of noise as he walked up the stairs. It wasn't often that Harry was as calculating as he was vicious, but today he had the right temperament. Today he was angry. Today he felt heartbroken and betrayed and beyond furious. That bastard wanted to ruin him? Wanted him to suffer for something his father had done? Wanted to emotionally damage him?</p>
<p>Ok then.</p>
<p>He was willing to play.</p>
<p>He grinned fiercely as he climbed the stairs while he wiped away a few stubborn tears that had refused to stay put.</p>
<p>Let the games begin.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>~~~***~~~</p>
<p> So planning on getting someone back for something they've done to you that you know of but shouldn't when they don't know you know yet is actually a lot harder than it looked, Harry concluded as he stared at Snape while he lectured them about something or other. And if he had made that any more complicated he wasn't sure he would ever have a plan because he would be too busy trying to figure out what he had just said. Either way, here he was, a month later and still no closer to figuring out what he should do.</p>
<p>Sure, he had a list. One that had taken a large amount of research and many a concerned looks from Ron (who thought he'd finally gone crazy), and Hermione's proud yet worried looks (since he'd never voluntarily opened a book in his life).</p><ol>
<li><strike> Figure out what a Lord is.</strike></li>
<li><strike> Figure out how to become a Lord (because it turned out it was actually important).</strike></li>
<li>Claim his Lordship.</li>
</ol>
<p>So, the first and most problematic point on his list was his Lordship. He had learned a lot of information in a short amount of time and still wasn't completely sure what it all meant. He knew one thing for sure, though, and that was that he wasn't allowed to ask anyone. Or, actually, he was allowed to but once it got around that he knew of his Lordship then it would get back to Snape and he didn't want that.</p>
<p>The other reason was that once he asked someone, say Neville, then Magic would recognize that he knew of his Lordships and...something would happen. He wasn't completely sure what because long words and boring words and complicated words, but it wasn't good. So the only option he had was to look it up himself (which clearly had mixed results). The one obvious thing that he was sure of was that he had to first claim his Lordship in front of the goblins and then go to the Ministry and have them acknowledge that he had taken up the mantle of his House.</p>
<p>Because Rules.</p>
<p>Boy, was there a lot of information about taking up the mantle of a House. Harry had thought it was more of a symbolic thing, something that people would look at and understand he decided to become a part of their world, but it turned out it was actually work. The Noble House of Potter wasn't just a title, it was votes in the Wizengamont, it was investments and upkeep, it was taking care of his ancestral home and every life form that lived there. It was responsibilities and power. Merlin <em>fuck</em>.</p>
<p>What it also meant was that he would be protected, like he should have been as a child but hadn't been. Sirius, as Snape alluded, hadn't told him any of this, but he had told Harry several things that made Harry wonder if Sirius hadn't thought Harry already knew these things. In hindsight it made a certain amount of sense. Who would believe he hadn't known these things? He was sure several of his schoolmates knew he didn't know but, as he figured out himself, couldn't actually tell him because of the 'very bad thing' that might happen.</p>
<p>So. He would read everything he could and prepare himself as best he could before Christmas, Yule (ha! See, he <em>was</em> learning!), came around and he went to the bank. It wasn't much, but knowing where he started from, it was better than nothing.</p><ol start="2">
<li>Destroy Snape.</li>
</ol>
<p>Simple statement, difficult to execute. Where did he start? How would he go about it? How far would he take it? These weren't easy questions and nothing that could be answered quickly. The one thing he knew for certain was that he wanted to get Snape sacked. The git deserved that at the very least. Besides, if what he had heard was correct, he had been doing this sort of thing for years, and if that didn't make him feel that much more unnerved, well, he didn't know what would.</p>
<p>So, first thing first: find Blakely. He wasn't sure how to go about doing that, but if there was one thing he did know was that Snape liked underage students. Merlin, Harry had been <em>fifteen</em> when Snape had started in on him and now that he thought about it, it was beyond horrifying. Even if the students he had chosen had been of age, he would have had to have started in on them while they were underage. He built up their trust so slowly that he made it seem natural.</p>
<p>It meant, if nothing else, that he would be 'retired' from his position because while not quite illegal (since they would have been of age when anything intimate happened) it was highly unethical. If anything came of his allegations that is, because as of right now it was his word against Snape's and Harry knew that despite his position in the Wizarding world that it simply wasn't going to be enough. Snape had plans in place after all. Who was to say he couldn’t turn it all around on Harry?</p>
<p>This brought him to his back-up plan: the way he treated his students. Everyone knew he was a surly bastard who hated children but the teachers seemed to think it was...normal? Perhaps they didn't quite see how he was with the students but one thing was clear: he had to go. Harry was certain of that. Well, if you took away the personal part of his revenge plot and focused on how terrible a teacher Snape actually was.</p>
<p>Oh sure, he was brilliant with potions and there could be an argument or two on how his strict demeanor prevented children from accidentally blowing up other students or themselves but in all honesty? He didn't have to go about it the way he did. He didn't have to demean children; he didn't have to make them their boggarts; he didn't have to make whole years of students not take N.E.W.T. potions because they didn't want to deal with him. That was just bad teaching. He wanted Snape gone for each and every one of the little first and second year student in all the houses who where too terrified to go to him when they had a problem. McGonagall may be somewhat stern and a little aloof at times, but he was always certain he could go to her if he had a problem.</p>
<p>So if part one of his plan was to protect himself from Snape's eventual 'tell all' (and subsequent ruining of his life, of course), and part two of the plan was to get him fired, was there a third part? Or rather, was it enough to just get him fired? Because if Harry was being honest, it was the very least he could do to Snape. Essentially, Snape could still open a shop somewhere and sell potions or do a myriad of things that would allow him to breathe the same air as Harry. Did Harry really want to completely destroy Snape? Did he want to destroy Snape's reputation like Snape had wanted to do to him?</p>
<p>Harry frowned a little as he came back to the real world and watched Snape smirk nastily at Neville as he asked the boy something which Neville was clearly unable to answer.</p>
<p>“And you, Potter?” Snape asked him. Well, asked was a nice word for the tone and look Snape had sent his way.</p>
<p>Harry blinked as he stared at Snape, still unable to rectify to himself that he had been so blind as to fall in possible love with this hateful man. “Eh?”</p>
<p>“The answer, Potter.” Snape sneered at him and in that moment Harry finally saw what he hadn't let himself see in the month since he knew the truth.</p>
<p>Snape actually, completely, and totally hated him. It wasn't an act he put on as he claimed before, it wasn't a ruse so others wouldn't find out about their relationship, it was a way in which Snape could both be himself in his hatred for Harry and use the excuse so he could play the part of a love interest later. Harry also understood that during all of his thinking the past month, all of the tears and the hurt and heartbreak, that right now in this moment, he hadn't fallen for Snape as much as he thought he had.</p>
<p>He had been on the cusp of something, that was definite. He had wanted to make that leap with Snape because he felt as if they could have been more, that maybe he could start feeling more, but he had never actually fallen as far as he had thought. It was, now at least, a relief. That didn't mean that he hadn't felt like love would have been a possibility. He had had feelings. He had really liked Snape, had let Snape be intimate with him in a way he had never been with another person.</p>
<p>The hurt had been real, the pain had been real, and the betrayal had been real.</p>
<p>And boy, was the <em>anger</em> real.</p>
<p>“The Pythagorean Theorem.” Harry stated on a whim. “Sir.” He added because he really wanted to piss Snape the fuck off. It was only a little petty revenge, but it already felt fantastic!</p>
<p>The silence that followed was something that Harry had never felt before and would cherish forever. There was a lot of confused silence (Purebloods), a little shocked I-can't-believe-you-did-that silence (he blamed that one mostly on Hermione since she turned in her chair to stare at him mouth hanging open and everything), and stunned I-think-you're-crazy-but-you've-got-some-balls silence (Ron didn't even blink through his stare). Harry felt himself become a little lucky to be distracted by Snape's outraged I-might-kill-you face by a choked noise coming from behind him. He broke eye contact with Snape to peer behind him just in time to see Dean become the reddest he'd ever seen while trying to stop himself from laughing. If it was any other class, Harry would have bet money on the fact that he would have laughed out loud, but seeing as it was Snape's class...well, no one wanted to be on his radar.</p>
<p>“Detention Potter!” Snape hissed angrily at him.</p>
<p>“That seems fair.” Harry nodded in agreement. Really, he expected much worse for his cheek and knowing Snape it was bound to end up this way. Plus, he had totally won.</p>
<p>“And fifty points!” Snape almost screamed at him.</p>
<p>Harry unexpectedly realized something funny: Snape never really yelled at anyone. He sneered, he snarled, he glared, he breathed like a terrible Balrog, but he never actually yelled. The fact that Harry had gotten him this close was something of a personal win in his opinion. Two wins in one day, he was doing great!</p>
<p>Now he had a new added goal to his number two plan: make Snape crazy. Just because he couldn't actually do anything just yet didn't mean he had to sit back and do nothing at all.</p>
<p>His buoyant mood lasted about as long as it took for class to end, which in Harry's opinion wasn't very long at all because he wanted to bask in his minor victory just a little longer.</p>
<p>“Merlin Harry!” Ron said as they left the room, a touch of awe in his voice that Harry discovered he quite liked.</p>
<p>“What was that?” Hermione hissed, coming up behind them and clearly distraught over what had just happened. In all fairness, Harry usually never lost it like that on Snape, not since Sirius.</p>
<p>“Mate, that was amazing!” Dean crowed in glee, clapping him on the back. “I've never seen him almost lose it like that!”</p>
<p>“Harry, that was the stupidest thing you've ever done and I've seen you do some stupid things.” Seamus stated shaking his head and he walked up next to Dean.</p>
<p>“We've seen him do stupider things.” Hermione said with a sad sigh of lost hope.</p>
<p>“Oi!” Harry yelped at her, very much insulted. “It's hardly my fault he got that angry! The man hates me!”</p>
<p>And he may or may not have intentionally prodded the git because of a secret relationship no one knew about that was actually fake because Snape was intentionally trying to seduce him so he could enact a larger ruin-Harry-for-life plan. It was all in the fine print really.</p>
<p>“Course it's your fault mate”. Ron said, dropping his arm around Harry's shoulders and beaming at him. “You’re Harry Potter!”</p>
<p>Harry just sighed. It wasn't exactly like he could tell them the truth, now could he?</p>
<p>“It was nice to see though”. Neville piped up. Harry turned to look at him and gave him a lopsided smile when their eyes met.</p>
<p>As both of them had been on Snape's bad side since the very beginning, they had formed their own bond when it came to passing Snape's classes. Frankly, if Harry hadn't needed the N.E.W.T. and Neville's grandmother hadn't pushed him to improve his grade, neither one of them would have started their little study group of survival. Neville helped Harry understand the importance of each plant and how they could work together while Harry helped Neville calm down and breathe enough to make a proper potion without the fear of abject failure. It was, honestly, the only reason either of them had gotten as far as they had. If it had been Snape looming over them during the exams, neither one would have passed. So after watching Snape terrorize Neville again, he figured it was just nice to be able to watch someone get under Snape's skin for a change.</p>
<p>Out of the corner of his eye he caught Malfoy glaring at Ron and then glaring at him. If what Malfoy Sr. had said was true, then Malfoy jr. was...in love with him? It was both an interesting thought and a terrifying one because it made a whole lot of sense but was also impossible because the blond git had bullied him since their first year. Not to mention the whole 'mudblood' thing and the hatred he harbored for anything Weasley related. All that aside though, did he even feel the same way about Malfoy? At the moment, no, but could he? It was something else he needed to figure out.</p>
<p>All the insanity aside, the first part of his mission would definitely have to be getting those damn letters and his picture back from Snape. Then hope to any deity out there that the bastard wasn't clever enough to make duplicates.</p>
<p>Who was he kidding? He was Harry Potter, of course there were duplicates!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>~~~***~~~</p>
<p> In the weeks since his unfortunate outburst in class and him trying to find more information on his possible Lordship (nothing, there was literally nothing there because wizards apparently didn’t need to do silly things like write information down), Harry had also taken the time to stop fighting with Malfoy in order watch him more often. And yes, he was fully aware of how creepy that sounded, but it wasn't like this was something that was easily talked about. It was Malfoy after all. As a matter of fact, he had had to seriously re-evaluate every single encounter he had with Malfoy and had spent many a night awake trying to figure out how the bloody hell he was supposed to have ever known that Malfoy was even interested, because it sure did look like the other man hated his guts.</p>
<p>Having had the time to deal with all of his possible-love feelings for Snape, Harry was left with a large amount of time to observe Malfoy and any potential feelings he could have for the other boy.</p>
<p>Not examining him in the way of them fighting (or Malfoy laughing at him, taunting him, generally making his life miserable) but watching him when the other boy didn't know or realize Harry was paying attention to him. Did that mean he wasn't still working through his feelings concerning Snape? No, but it wasn't like he was going to fall for Malfoy either, no matter how good he looked when he genuinely laughed, or when he smiled that smile where he thought something was funny but he was trying not to let it show.</p>
<p>Ok fine, it was even creepier than it sounded.</p>
<p>Needless to say, they had just finished Charms and were headed to their common room before dinner when Ron accidentally bumped into a Slytherin and before he knew what had happened, it had turned into pure chaos. Malfoy was yelling at Ron and Ron was yelling back at Malfoy and Harry just wanted to see if Snape and Malfoy's father had been right. If he had really been that oblivious for all these years and that Malfoy really was...what? In love with him? Holding a serious crush? Wanted to be his friend? This, he figured, was the perfect opportunity to find out.</p>
<p>In all the mess that was going on with the two groups, Harry just stared at Malfoy as he thought of the best way to accomplish this enormous feat. It wasn't like he could actually ask the other boy could he? Besides all the yelling and, well let's be honest, animosity between the two of them, Harry seriously doubted Malfoy would be truthful if Harry simply asked him.</p>
<p>So. That meant trying to be sneaky. He could do sneaky. He was the sneakiest person to ever sneak and oh boy, he was still staring at Malfoy and now the bloke was staring at him as if he had spontaneously grown a second head. Harry mentally shrugged because, hey, not impossible when magic was involved. He had half an urge to check (just in case) but let that go for the moment.</p>
<p>“What Potter?” Malfoy spat at him, his temper obviously getting the better of him. “Think you're so special-“</p>
<p>“Hi.” Harry interrupted, still staring at Malfoy because he figured if that was what made Malfoy pay attention, then that's what he was going to continue to do. And wow, did Malfoy know he had little flecks of green in his eyes? Because that was just pretty.</p>
<p>Harry also realized the noise around them gradually got softer as more people noticed something odd going on. Mainly that Harry was still staring at Malfoy and not in an I'm-going-to-curse-you-so-hard type of way either. Well, sometimes a plan comes together without you even trying, so Harry was just going to go with the flow.</p>
<p>“-just because you have that stupid scar- I- what?” Malfoy stopped in confused anger. He blinked a couple of times before he turned to his friend who just shrugged in bemusement.</p>
<p>“Hi.” Harry repeated, giving the other boy a small smile when he turned back to Harry. There was a slight murmur coming from the two groups that Harry chose to ignore since this was the best plan he had ever not-planned. He couldn't wait to tell Hermione!</p>
<p>“I-um, I'm- what's going on?” Malfoy asked, floundering a little as his cheeks turned pink as Harry continued to stare at him with an intensity that Harry was sure made several people very uncomfortable. Not to mention how Ron was gaping at him in horror.</p>
<p>Harry smiled a little wider as Malfoy started to fluster under the attention and his eyes started to dart down to the floor and back up at Harry with a speed that was a little impressive.</p>
<p>“Ok. Bye.” Harry said, his voice a little deeper as he tried to keep in his laughter when Malfoy's blush turned a deeper shade of red he thought actually looked very flattering on the other boy.</p>
<p>“Huuuuu.” Malfoy breathed out when the boy next to him jabbed him in the ribs with his elbow.</p>
<p>Harry kept his laughter in until he turned the corner, turning his head around and meeting Malfoy's eyes and giving him a blinding smile just as he turned the corner. He quickly cast a silencing charm and ran as quickly as he could to Gryffindor tower where he burst into uncontrollable laughter and startled Hermione enough to wonder what the hell was wrong with one of her best friends.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>~~~~~~</p>
<p> Trying to not tell Hermione Granger something she wanted you to tell her was like giving a toddler candy, having him eat half of it and then taking it back and not expect a tantrum. Some things were just inevitable. So when he spent the better part of ten minutes (a record to be sure) holding out and denying anything was wrong while she kept poking (impressive since she was gently brushing Crookshanks) because she knew something was actually wrong, he caved. At least now he knew he could never be a criminal because if he couldn't hold out against Hermione, he'd fold to anyone who asked. Although, come to think of it, maybe that meant he'd be a good criminal? Something to think on later.</p>
<p>Needless to say, he spilled his guts. All of them. About Snape, about Malfoy (senior) about what Snape had been doing, about Sirius, and about Malfoy (junior). When he finished, and after making sure they were spelled in the utmost secret bubble of silence that had ever been created (because he wasn’t stupid and there were far too many ears around for his liking) he waited for her to snap out of her shocked horror and help him figure out what to do. Clearly he need the help since he’d been at this close to two months and hadn’t gotten very far at all.</p>
<p>“Merlin Harry, that's...I don't even know if I have words for that.” Hermione told him, looking all sorts of bewildered, terrified, and angry. The longer she thought about it, the angrier she seemed to get and frankly, Harry just appreciated someone being angry on his behalf. “That's...if he had actually had sex with you, that would have been rape, you realize that right?”</p>
<p>Harry sighed deeply. “I don't think he would have, not until I was of age. And,” he interrupted her before she could say anything, “I would have consented whole heartedly. You know I would have.”</p>
<p>She sighed and deflated before nodding her head. “Yes, I know. Though it still would have been rape, regardless of whether or not you consented. Not to mention the moral side of it all, let alone the legality of it.”</p>
<p>“Is it? What exactly had he done that's illegal?” He wasn't even going to bother arguing with her about morals or rape because he knew how terrible this was, what with it happening to him and all.</p>
<p>“He's grooming you!” Hermione whispered at him harshly. If she had had a book with her, she would have hit him over the head with it. Thankfully she had finished brushing Crookshanks and she wasn't about to hit him with a cat. He bet she had thought of it though, evil queen that she was. He was only glad she had forgotten about the brush.</p>
<p>Harry winced. “Yes, ok, that, but legally speaking, he hasn't done anything that, in the muggle world, he would have been imprisoned for. Or the wizarding one for that matter. I checked.”</p>
<p>“He's been-“ Hermione practically screamed.</p>
<p>“Nice to me.” Harry interrupted. “Ever since Sirius died, he has been there for me. He helped me through a difficult time in my life. Maybe I misconstrued his intentions while he was only being kind. Maybe it was all in my head and I latched on to the only adult who was there for me in a difficult situation.”</p>
<p>Hermione turned pale. “Oh Merlin.”</p>
<p>Harry gave her a pained smile. “Yep.”</p>
<p>“How are you not freaking out?” She asked a little dumbfounded.</p>
<p>“I've had some time to process all of this.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry you had to go through this by yourself.” Hermione said sadly, as she reached out to grab his hand and giving it a squeeze before dropping it again.</p>
<p>Harry gave her a half-hearted smile. “Thank you for being here with me now.”</p>
<p>“Did he...”she hesitated, “did he kiss you?” She asked as though she didn't really want to know the answer and Harry quite understood.</p>
<p>“Several times.” He answered with a short nod.</p>
<p>“But that just proves that he was leading you on! That could get him thrown in prison!” Hermione whispered as her eyes darted around the empty room even though they had both spelled their little corner to the high heavens.</p>
<p>Harry snorted. “Sure, but could you prove that it wasn't a kiss on the head? A kiss on the cheek? Could you prove it wasn't consensual? And I'm pretty sure the only thing that could get him thrown into prison would be him actually having sex with me while I was underage.”</p>
<p>“So he was going to wait?” Hermione asked, perplexed.</p>
<p>“Yep. Pretty sure I wasn't the first he did this too either.”</p>
<p>“Merlin Harry. Even when you don't find yourself in the middle of a mystery, you somehow find yourself in the middle of a mystery! Not even the good kind.” She lamented quietly as if what she had really wanted was a nice murder mystery.</p>
<p>Harry chuckled. “I'm just glad I found out before we went any further.”</p>
<p>Hermione's eyes widened in realization. “<em>That's</em> why you set him off in potions!”</p>
<p>This time Harry did laugh. “Yeah, I think I was still angry.”</p>
<p>“Who wouldn't be?” She asked ruefully. “So what do you want to do now?”</p>
<p>“Revenge.” Harry stated promptly. “I want that bastard to pay for even thinking he could do this to me. I mean, yes, technically he didn't get that far, but given the chance he would have. I'm not about to stand around and let it happen, not to me and not to anyone else. I also can't let him know I know because then I have no idea what he would do and frankly, that's just terrifying. He's very set on seeing me ruined and I’d very much like to be one step ahead of him at all times.”</p>
<p>“Right. Revenge then. You mentioned another person?”</p>
<p>Harry nodded. “Blakely. No idea if it's a man or woman but I do know that they graduated just last year. Snape said we overlapped a little. Made it seem like he did have sex with them while he, um, groomed me.”</p>
<p>Hermione looked pained. “He's a terrible person but he knows his subject, practically the best there is. I never thought he'd be this-this...”</p>
<p>“Awful? No offense Hermione, but if he can hold on to a grudge for more than eleven years and then throw that grudge onto a child that never even knew his parents, the man is a prick.”</p>
<p>“Harry!” Hermione gasped in shock before she giggled.</p>
<p>“He is though!” Harry defended himself, smiling at her as he watched her laugh.</p>
<p>“So.” Hermione started once she had gathered herself again. “We find someone called Blakely, first or last name, male or female, and then what?”</p>
<p>“Um. Talk to them? I'm not really sure where I want this revenge to go other than the fact that I want him kicked out of the school. If we have more evidence, then we can get him kicked out on moral grounds. The school’s governors are all made up of the parents of children who go to this school. There is no way any one of them would vote to keep him in if there's a chance that he might do it to their child.”</p>
<p>Hermione sighed. “Idiots. Instead of doing it to keep the children safe like any normal person would. So we need Blakely for evidence, and then?”</p>
<p>“To begin with, we talk to them. From there, well, maybe they say something that gives us a direction to look for the others? Maybe give us more evidence and shape this thing as we go along.” Harry replied with a shrug.</p>
<p>She nodded thoughtfully. “You said he had a box of trinkets?”</p>
<p>Harry cringed at the memory of giving Snape a photograph of himself. “Yeah, don't know where he keeps it though and finding Blakely will probably be easier than getting into Snape's private quarters again.”</p>
<p>“How did you manage to get in there in the first place?” Hermione asked with interest.</p>
<p>Harry shrugged. “Found a loophole in his warding.” He watched his best friend warily as her jaw dropped and she simply stared at him. “What?” He asked incredibly uncomfortable.</p>
<p>“You...you found a loophole in his warding?” She asked, her voice getting higher with every word.</p>
<p>“Yes?” He asked unsurely.</p>
<p>“Harry, do you even know-you know what? No, not important, I'll just tell you later. Do you think you could get back in through that loophole?”</p>
<p>Harry chewed his bottom lip in thought. “I think so. If he doesn't mention anything about it later during detention, then I think I got away with it. Mostly because I didn't need the loophole to get back out again which probably helped. I doubt it's going to work more than once though, so when I do try again I don't think I'll get another shot.”</p>
<p>Hermione sucked in a deep breath before letting it out again. “Right. Let's not get this wrong then. We keep an eye out for Snape's habits and find the most optimal moment where you can spend a few hours searching and then getting the evidence. In the meantime, we find out who Blakely is and then track them down somehow. An owl would be the most helpful but without a full name it wouldn’t work so we'll cross that bridge when we get to it. Hopefully Blakely will know something to help us, even if it's the name of the person before them. <em>If</em> there is a person before them.” She amended after a thoughtful pause.</p>
<p>Harry stared at Hermione with such affection that he couldn't help but to smile at her. It warmed him a little that she just jumped into situations like this with him with little thought. That she stood behind him and with him without taking a breath. He couldn't describe how much it meant to him that even one person on this earth gave their trust to him in that manner. It was something he deeply cherished and he vowed to himself that he would try his best to live up to the trust she had given him.</p>
<p>“What's that look for?” Hermione asked, bringing him back to the conversation.</p>
<p>“Hm? Oh, just thinking how much I love you for helping me with this.”</p>
<p>She smiled at him with what he thought was the same amount of affection he that he had. “Of course I would Harry. You're my best friend. I'll always stand with you.”</p>
<p>“Always?” He asked before he could stop himself.</p>
<p>She reached out and grabbed one of his hands in hers. “And forever”. She stated giving it a tight squeeze before letting go. “Now, about detention tonight.”</p>
<p>Harry groaned theatrically. “Nooo! Do we have to talk about that?”</p>
<p>“We do, because we need a plan of action. If we give him too much time he'll simply try and move up his timeline and we don't want that. So, how do we stall him?”</p>
<p>Harry hummed in thought. “I don't know.”</p>
<p>They were interrupted by a very disgruntled Ron who plopped down next to Hermione before looking from one friend to the other. So much for their silence bubble of greatness, Harry thought with just a touch of resentment.</p>
<p>“What are you two doing?” Ron asked, suspicion in his voice as he sat slightly closer to Hermione than strictly necessary.</p>
<p>“Thinking of things Snape really hates.” Harry said without thinking as he wondered how Ron had popped their magic bubble and if he had, could anyone have done it?</p>
<p>“Oh that's easy.” Ron scoffed, relaxing slightly and distracting Harry enough to wonder what on earth he thought they had been doing.</p>
<p>“How is that easy?” Hermione asked, a little miffed at Ron for thinking...well, whatever Ron was thinking that Hermione clearly had caught onto.</p>
<p>“Well, besides Neville, Harry, children in general, Harry, teaching, and Harry, there's only one thing he bangs on about and that's how much he hated Harry's dad.”</p>
<p>Both Hermione and Harry stared at Ron in disbelief before turning to each other.</p>
<p>“You don't think it would be that easy do you?” Harry asked, incredulity evident in his voice.</p>
<p>“Well, now that Ron's mentioned it, he does say it an awful lot.” Hermione said slowly.</p>
<p>“Not all that much lately, but yeah.” Ron inserted, his eyes darting from one friend to the other. “What, exactly, is going on here?”</p>
<p>“Alright then, you know what you have to do then.” Hermione said as she shook herself out of her thoughts.</p>
<p>“I do?” Harry asked, wondering what he had missed.</p>
<p>“You do. You need to ask Snape if he knew your father.” She said with an air of determination that Harry envied her for.</p>
<p>"I can’t do that!" Harry cried out in horror. "I already told you that he did! Fuck! Hermione, he’s been doing all of this <em>because</em> of my father, and now you want me to…” Harry trailed off in disbelief.</p>
<p>“Oi! Are you two even listening to me?” Ron asked, aggravated and turning slightly red.</p>
<p>“Yes, yes, Ron, we know you're here! We need to save Harry from the worst detention in history first!” Hermione groused, angry that he had distracted her from the real issue.</p>
<p>“Oh.” Ron said, deflating a little. “Right, no, of course, that makes sense. Impending doom and all. Carry on.”</p>
<p>“I’m not saying this out of the blue. The best way to keep him away from you is to bring up the one thing he would be sure you know nothing about. <em>He doesn’t know you know</em>, Harry. And why would you? It’s not like either of you have had conversations about the..him.” Hermione stated with a pointed look.</p>
<p>“So I just blurt out 'hey, Snape, fun story, did you know my dad' like that wouldn't make him kill me?” Harry asked sarcastically.</p>
<p>“Of course not you idiot!” Hermione griped, thoroughly fed up with people who didn't listen. “You casually bring up in conversation that Ron brought something up that made you think. Then you blurt out, in that way you do-”</p>
<p>“What way?!” Harry interrupted outraged. Ron merely gave him a half hearted shrug while Hermione glared at him for his interruption.</p>
<p>“-that maybe you think Snape knew your father and if he did, did that mean that he had pictures or stories about him. Now, if that doesn't work, throw your mother in there.”</p>
<p>“My mother?” Harry asked more confused than ever. “What does she have to do with this?”</p>
<p>“His mother?” Ron asked at the same time, a similar confusion on his features.</p>
<p>“Of course his mother! They were in the same year and in the same house. It only makes sense that if Snape hung about Harry's father that he would have, at the very least, come into contact with his mother. So the objective is to bombard him with uncomfortable questions, enough that he'll want to avoid you for some time and give you the space you need for part one of the operation.”</p>
<p>“Two.” Harry said absently as he thought over the insane plan that would probably get him killed.</p>
<p>“Part one of the operation? What the bloodly hell are you two up to?” Ron asked, suspicion back in his voice as his eyes jumped from Hermione to Harry.</p>
<p>Hermione looked at Harry for permission so he shrugged his acceptance. “Only Ron though.” He clarified before turning to Ron. “And you have to swear right here and now that you won't mention this to another soul. I can't have you messing this up for me, Ron. This could affect my whole future and I'll take you down with me if I have to.” He threatened darkly.</p>
<p>Ron gulped and leaned back at the threat. “Um. Can I think about it?”</p>
<p>Harry squinted his eyes in thought. “Fine.” He nodded. “I have to go to detention anyway, but you better think about this long and hard Ron. Once you're in, you're in all the way. Understand?”</p>
<p>Ron nodded quickly as Harry stood. “Right then. I'll see you later Hermione?”</p>
<p>“I'll get started on finding that person you mentioned Harry.” Hermione said with a sharp nod.</p>
<p>He smiled at her softly before giving them both a bob goodbye and making his way towards the dungeons.</p>
<p>He would make a good criminal, he thought as he walked down far too many stairs. He could threaten like the best of them and make plans that had a good chance of succeeding. If all else failed, he at least had one career option. Surprisingly enough, considering he didn't actually know how to go about being a criminal, it eased his mind a little that there was life after Hogwarts.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>~~~~~~</p>
<p>Even though it had been a little over two weeks since 'the potions incident' it didn't mean Snape had forgotten about it or had let Harry forget about it. What he had done was push the detention back enough times so that, as Harry suspected, he could vent his anger on Harry as much as he liked without any repercussions. It was also helpful because any time he tried to approach Snape, Snape very quickly turned down Harry's attempts at spending some time with him. Harry knew he still had to play his part if he didn't want Snape to catch on, but Merlin fuck was he grateful for the grudge holding arsehole that refused to spend even a moment longer than necessary with him.</p>
<p>It wasn't much of a surprise then that detention with Snape was the definition of hell. Not literally of course, because that would be all kinds of terrible and very illegal because children, but more in the sense that it was Snape and Harry was supposed to pretend to be mooning over him while hating his guts and not knowing if he was hiding his emotions enough for that hatred not to shine through. It had worked before because Snape hadn't given Harry even a second of his time, but now? One on one alone time with a man who very much hated his guts? Harry wasn’t that good of an actor.</p>
<p>Of course he still had Hermione's plan to work with, but how does one purposefully start an awkward conversation with the intent of flustering another person enough to have them avoid you without making it obvious that that's what your doing?</p>
<p>Harry was retracting his earlier statement; criminal life was definitely not for him. This was a terrible way to live! It hadn't even been five minutes and he was sure Snape was already planning his death! Ok, no, not his death, yet, but he can't imagine it being too far off in his mind.</p>
<p>Case in point: the clear loathing on Snape's face as he glared at Harry. Harry kept in a sigh as he figured that at least they had one real thing in common. As luck would have it, Snape happily ignored him for a full ten minutes of detention. Harry had been ordered to clean all the cauldrons (the ones Snape used because students were responsible for keeping their own equipment clean and Snape liked to have students clean his cauldrons without magic) before promptly ignoring him. Of course, that ignoring of him wasn't going so great for Snape because the man kept looking over and glaring at Harry.</p>
<p>“And what exactly, Potter, was that stunt you pulled in class?” Snape finally asked, breaking the intense silence that had been building since he had walked into the room.</p>
<p>“Well...” Harry stretched out as he turned to Snape while trying to keep his filthy hands over the sink. If there was one thing he knew about the man that he had been well on his way to almost falling in love with, it was how much he hated waiting for an answer.</p>
<p>“Yes?” He sniped out. Harry refrained from grinning and made a show of washing his hands and drying them.</p>
<p>“It was something Ron said.” He said slowly, looking at Snape under his lashes and quickly looking away as if the subject was a touchy one and he didn't know how Snape was going to react. Which wasn't really an act, if he was being honest.</p>
<p>“And this prompted your despicable behavior?” Snape snapped out, irritation written across his features.</p>
<p>“It's just...I wanted to have a chance to speak with you without anyone becoming suspicious.” Which would also happily explain the many attempts Harry had made to speak to Snape and would also ease any suspicions Snape had of Harry. If there had been any at all, that is. He still wasn't sure if Snape had even noticed anything amiss with his wards.</p>
<p>“Because of something Mr. Weasley alluded to.” Snape stated with a barely restrained sigh. Harry nodded meekly and waited for Snape to lose his patience. “Well?”</p>
<p>“Huh? Oh. Um. He just said-and it wasn't like I hadn't wondered myself-but I thought-really, it doesn't matter-” Harry started to blabber as his nerves got the best of him.</p>
<p>“Potter!” Snape interrupted harshly.</p>
<p>“Sorry.” Harry muttered as he looked away. He took a big, deep breath and then figured, why the hell not. All he needed to do was just say it and not get murdered. Easy. “Did you know my father?”</p>
<p>Snape stilled before his eyes. If Harry was a betting man, which he wasn't because he had terrible luck, he would have been sure Snape had stopped breathing altogether.</p>
<p>“What did you say?” Snape asked finally, the question so quiet Harry wasn't sure he heard it correctly.</p>
<p>“Well you see, Ron was going on and on about how you seemed to become a little less hostile and how the world must be ending soon and I laughed, because if he noticed then others must have too, so I asked him what he meant and then he said that you used to compare me to my father a whole lot, you remember, and how you weren't doing that so much anymore.” Harry took a deep breath. “So then I asked why that was odd and he said he just figured you got over it and so I asked 'over what' and he said the fact that I remind you of my father so I asked him if it was possible if you knew my dad and he said he always figured you did because why would you otherwise compare me to him and then I thought about it and remembered that I used to wonder that too and if I wondered it, then others would have too and so now I'm asking you.” All of that came out rather quickly in Harry's opinion, and there was a lot of information in there which made him rather proud of the constipated look Snape was currently wearing. He waited a beat or two to simply enjoy the emotional turmoil he'd been causing before he prodded the silence. “So...did you? Know my dad?”</p>
<p>“Your father.” Snape parroted, a little whiter than when they had started this conversation.</p>
<p>“Yes. Did you know him? You were probably around the same age.” Harry said, as if trying to puzzle it out. “And you did mention him a fair bit so you must have known what he was like. You've already said that I look like him, so that's nice to hear. Was he funny?” Harry asked, coming closer and closer to Snape with every sentence.</p>
<p>He hadn't really thought the conversation would go this way, but having Snape back up every time Harry took a step forward was altogether a very pleasant feeling.</p>
<p>“Funny?” Snape asked, a streak of pure rage flashing over his features before he looked at the hopeful look Harry was aiming at him.</p>
<p>Snape jerked back from Harry and made sure his desk was very firmly situated between the two of them.</p>
<p>“Are you ok Severus?” Harry asked in fake concern, reaching out to him before seemingly realizing that he was too far away to touch the other man.</p>
<p>“I'm not quite sure where this conversation came from,” Snape started, “but I do not think it's appropriate.”</p>
<p>“Well I told you that.” Harry said with some confusion. “From Ron.”</p>
<p>“Of course. Mr. Weasley.”</p>
<p>“So did you?” Harry prodded again. He really had no intention of putting any effort into his relationship with Snape (even though he had to in order to prevent Snape from suspecting something was amiss) so he hoped with everything in him that this worked enough that Snape would be wary of spending any sort of extra time with Harry for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>“I knew your father.” Snape finally grit out, looking like he was in a great amount of pain having just admitted to it.</p>
<p>Harry lit up like a Christmas tree. “That's amazing! Will you tell me stories? What was he like? What did he like to do? Was he a good student? How did he and my mum meet? Did you know her too?” Harry bombarded him. Really, he thought in surprise as Snape suddenly sprung into action, he was only throwing random questions out there to fluster Snape as much as he could. He had no idea Snape would ever react like a...like a, fuck, Harry didn't even know what.</p>
<p>“No time for that tonight.” Snape announced gruffly as he quickly gathered all of his papers without a single glance in Harry's direction. “Detention's over, Pot-Harry, get ou-go to your dorm.” Snape stumbled out, clearly out of sorts as Harry's eyes grew in both concern (would Snape actually hex him?) and delight (that he could even evoke this type of reaction from Snape was something for the history books).</p>
<p>“But what about-“</p>
<p>“Next time!” Snape snarled at him with so much anger that Harry actually took several steps away from the man.</p>
<p>Huh. Harry thought to himself as he watched Snape quickly retreat to his quarters. Would you look at that. Hermione was right. Sometimes plans do work. Number two of plan ‘Destroy Snape’ was working just fine!</p>
<p>All he had to do now was wonder how long this would put Snape off for. If all else failed, he could simply keep bringing it up until he got Snape fired. No worries.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>~~~***~~~</p>
<p> “Er, Hermione? What's going on?” Harry asked in bemusement as several first years handed her a piece of parchment and giving her a conspiratorial look before they scampered off.</p>
<p>“Hmm?” Hermione asked, tearing her eyes away from whatever was written on the parchment to look at Harry. “Oh!” She said, catching up. “Well, I had the whole of Gryffindor do a little amateur sleuthing.” She told him as she put the parchment into her notebook.</p>
<p>“You did what?!” Harry whisper yelled, grabbing her arm and pulling her into a corner.</p>
<p>“Would you calm down!” She shrieked, whacking at his hands until he let go. “Get a hold of yourself! Honestly!”</p>
<p>“Why did you do that?” Glaring at his best friend while pouting and rubbing a particularly painful spot on his hand.</p>
<p>“I don't like being manhandled, why else?” Hermione stated angrily while tugging her shirt down and patting it down to its previously smooth state.</p>
<p>“I meant the sleuthing!” Harry huffed out.</p>
<p>“Oh that.” She said off-handedly. “Well it's not like we could follow Snape around without him catching on to what we were doing, now could we?”</p>
<p>“No?” Harry asked, because he hadn't even realized this part of the plan was already in motion. Without his knowledge even.</p>
<p>“No. So why would he notice an entire house documenting his every move when they act as they normally do every day?”</p>
<p>“They are?”</p>
<p>“Of course they are. They write down when they see him and what he's doing and I set up a timeline and track his habits.”</p>
<p>“Merlin, Hermione. That's bloodly brilliant!” Harry said, staring at her in awe.</p>
<p>“Yes, I know.” Hermione stated blandly. “Who would have thought. Me. Smart. Impossible. The odds. Wow.”</p>
<p>“Alright, alright.” Harry chuckled holding up his hands in surrender. “I'm a terrible person for doubting you.”</p>
<p>“You would be wise to remember that.” She threatened as her lips twitched in amusement.</p>
<p>“So, what did you find? And how did you get them to do this for you?”</p>
<p>“Oh, that part was surprisingly easy. As a Prefect I called a house meeting and then told them that we were tired of Snape being such a dick-”</p>
<p>“Hermione! Language!” Harry reprimanded her, acting shocked before smiling impishly at her glare.</p>
<p>“-and that we were planning an epic prank but we needed to know his schedule. It won't surprise you that everyone hates Snape enough that they all agreed. Didn't even need any convincing. I'm pretty sure several letters went out to Fred and George, but we'll see if they have the nerve to write me. Actually, maybe I should write them.” She said thoughtfully.</p>
<p>“You...you do know they're not scared of you right?” Harry hedged carefully. Hermione scoffed and raised an eyebrow. Harry sighed. “They never listened to you, they frequently went behind your back, they kind of made fun of you for trying to get them in trouble when they still went here, they used to bribe students to play pranks on you...do I need to go on?”</p>
<p>“Means nothing. They fear me. I know it.” Hermione replied, waving her hand in the air in a dismissive gesture. “Not the point though. She forged on. “If we want the house to remain blessedly clueless to our true motives, we're actually going to have to do this major prank we've promised them.”</p>
<p>“’We’? Who is this ‘we’? I don't remember promising anyone anything.” Harry said, slightly alarmed that he was being pulled into this. Even though, yes, technically this was all about him.</p>
<p>“Don't be silly. I shamelessly used your name because I'm a really good Prefect and they didn't believe that I'd do it. You on the other hand...”</p>
<p>Harry squinted at her in suspicion. “You used that incident in potions didn't you?” Hermione almost blinded him with her smile. He sighed deeply.” Of course you did. Look, I'll help with the execution of the whole thing, but I refuse to help you plan it.”</p>
<p>She scoffed. “Don't be ridiculous, your plans never work and we'd be in trouble before we even set the thing in motion. No, I'll have Ron help me.”</p>
<p>“He'll do better than me, will he?” Harry asked, a touch of snide in there because he was a resentful little fuck sometimes and he owned it.</p>
<p>“When he cares to, and I'll make sure he that does, he can actually come up with some pretty good plans. Also, I'll need his help in convincing his brothers that I'm not trying to pull one over on them.”</p>
<p>Harry snorted. “That makes more sense. So, have you found anything on Blakely yet? Because I've got nothing. We don't even have yearbooks. No pictures, no records, no nothing.”</p>
<p>“No, I've got no- records?” Hermione asked, switching tracks abruptly as she got a vacant look on her face.</p>
<p>“Yep, no records.” Harry repeated.</p>
<p>“That's actually not possible. Well,” she amended seeing the look Harry gave her, “ok, it is possible. The pictures make sense because practically all British witches and wizards go to Hogwarts unless they have parents that have gone to other schools. Why keep pictures if everyone you know goes to the same school? Besides, it's tradition. The records, however, they should have. And if they don't have them in the library, because I checked-”</p>
<p>“Of course you did. Not that I didn't tell you I looked for them and did actual work in trying to track it down.” Harry muttered in a surely tone.</p>
<p>“- that means that they store them somewhere else. Where to look, where to look.” She pondered, ignoring Harry's dark muttering.</p>
<p>“The only two logical places are with the Headmaster and the Deputy Headmaster.” Harry stated.</p>
<p>“That <em>is</em> logical.” Hermione praised him, bravely ignoring the death glare he was sending her. “So Professor Dumbledore or Professor McGonagall. That won't be easy to explain.” Hermione said, worrying her bottom lip with her teeth.</p>
<p>“Who says we have to?” Harry asked, an idea suddenly popping up into his head.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“Well, we've already blatantly abused my parent's memories once before to get me out of trouble with Snape, why not do it again?” Harry asked, excitement building as a plan started to form.</p>
<p>“I'm not following. You want to go to Professor Dumbledore or McGonagall and ask to see the records to look up your parents? But you already know they went here.” She pointed out in confusion.</p>
<p>“No.” Harry replied in exasperation. “I want to jot down some names of the people in their year and ask them if they have any pictures or stories of my parents!”</p>
<p>“Oh. Oh wow, that is kind of brilliant. Not only would that get them all smushy because of the emotional aspect, but it basically guarantees we get to look.”</p>
<p>“You know, I'm starting to really resent your opinion of my intelligence.” Harry stated with a bland voice and dangerously slanted eyes. “And smushy is not a word.”</p>
<p>“You insulted my intelligence not five minutes ago. Tell someone who cares.” Hermione scoffed as she ignored the rest of what he had said.</p>
<p>“Hermione!”</p>
<p>“Harry!”</p>
<p>“Guys?”</p>
<p>“ARGH!” Harry and Hermione screamed as they jumped around to the owner of the voice.</p>
<p>“What the bloodly hell mate?!” Harry yelled, clutching his heart. “I have a heart condition, don't you know! You could have murdered me!”</p>
<p>“Hermione-what-stop-woman! Stop hitting me!” Ron yelled as he tried to protect whatever area Hermione was hitting him without hurting her.</p>
<p>“That's what you get for scaring me!” Hermione huffed out angrily.</p>
<p>“Maybe pay better attention next time! Merlin, you two are like a pair of bowtruckles.”</p>
<p>“Murder I tell you!” Harry cried out dramatically, his heart still racing.</p>
<p>“Oh relax, you're not dead yet.” Hermione said, rolling her eyes as she picked up the notebook she'd just dropped. “I'll just drop this off and we can go to dinner.”</p>
<p>“You see that!” Harry asked Ron, pointing dramatically at Hermione's retreating back. “She's got it out for me!”</p>
<p>“Good. Then I won't have to hex you for spending too much time alone with her.”</p>
<p>“What?” Harry asked as Ron suddenly turned red.</p>
<p>“Pardon?” Ron asked, pretending to be confused.</p>
<p>“Huh?” Harry asked, actually confused.</p>
<p>“No.” Ron said in return.</p>
<p>“You just said-” Harry started, peering suspiciously at Ron.</p>
<p>“No I didn't.” Ron interrupted, eyes darting to where Hermione had just disappeared.</p>
<p>“I was there, I think I heard you.” Harry stated, crossing his arms.</p>
<p>“Don't be stupid, you were having a heart attack. You're a delicate creature. All that stress just got to you. Definitely hearing things. You should go to Madam Pomfrey to get that checked out.”</p>
<p>“My heart is fine, thank you very much!” Harry stated as he uncrossed his arms and stood up a straighter, a little offended at the delicate creature comment.</p>
<p>“You have a heart condition, don't you know?” Ron said, still looking at the stairs leading to the girl's dormitories. “Now hush up.” He said before Harry could comment. “Hermione's coming.”</p>
<p>“What are you two doing?” Hermione asked lightly, looking from one boy to the other.</p>
<p>“Wouldn't know.” Harry groused. “I'm a delicate creature with a heart condition and terrible hearing.”</p>
<p>“What?” Hermione asked, looking thoroughly bemused.</p>
<p>“Nothing, nothing.” Ron hastily interrupted. “He's just getting over his heart attack, aren't you mate? Let's go eat!” Ron said as he ushered both of them out the portrait hole.</p>
<p>Hermione gave Ron a suspicious look before something crossed her face. She gathered herself and then cleared her voice. “Hey Harry?”</p>
<p>“What?” Harry replied shortly, still sulking.</p>
<p>“How are you doing with the whole Draco thing?” She asked off-handedly.</p>
<p>Harry narrowed his eyes at her in distrust. “Just fine, thank you.”</p>
<p>“Malfoy? What about Malfoy? He's not hexing you, is he mate? Because Ginny taught me a new one that's bound to hurt.” Ron jumped in eagerly.</p>
<p>Hermione laughed. “Heard about that one. No, Harry fancies Draco.”</p>
<p>“Hermione!” Harry spluttered out, terrified and indignant. It wasn't as if they hadn't had conversations about Harry's bisexual nature, but it wasn't something he had had the chance to discuss with Ron yet and having her just blurt it out? Well, it felt a whole lot like disloyalty really.</p>
<p>“You are?” Ron asked, surprised and hopeful. Then he frowned in thought. “Why?”</p>
<p>“What do you mean why?” Harry asked, a little defensive and a lot on edge. Though, to be fair to Ron, he didn't really seem like he had a problem with Harry dating other men which was very much a relief on its own.</p>
<p>“He's a bullying git, mate. Been on you since first year. Not exactly the nicest of blokes either, is he?” Ron asked, eyeing Harry and giving him a soft smile and a nod.</p>
<p>That was all Harry really needed from Ron and relief poured through his veins. Acceptance was a heady feeling.</p>
<p>“Sure, but he's got great eyes. Got these little flecks of green in his eyes. Have you noticed?” Harry said honestly, thinking on what had attracted him to Malfoy in the first place.</p>
<p>“Don't want to get that close, thanks.” Hermione stated flatly. Harry glared at her and she at least had the decency to wince. They'd be having words about this.</p>
<p>Ron got a constipated look on his face. “Mate. That's a terrible reason to fancy someone.”</p>
<p>Harry shrugged. “He's just been trying to get my attention in the worst way possible. I'm trying to figure out if he's any nicer as a normal person.”</p>
<p>“That-That actually sounds reasonable.” Ron said slowly.</p>
<p>Harry glared at Hermione and Ron. “If you two don't stop saying fucking things like that, I'll hex you both into next week!” He yelled at them before storming off to sit with Ginny and her friends.</p>
<p>“What happened? What did I do?” Ron asked, bewildered.</p>
<p>Hermione shrugged carelessly. “Never mind that, he'll get over it. Now Ron, when was the last time you wrote to Fred and George?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>~~~~~~</p>
<p> “Harry? Can we talk?” Hermione asked a few days later. He was still incredibly angry at her and let her know at every available opportunity, which was a lot of the time since they usually spent their days together.</p>
<p>“What about? Or do you want to wait for someone else to pop by and tell them all my secrets too? I'm sure Neville would love to hear all about the newest ‘Harry gossip’.” Harry snarked.</p>
<p>“I know you're mad at me.” She said softly.</p>
<p>“Don't know why you'd think that.” He said sarcastically. He would have applauded her composure and obvious attempts at not getting irritated if he wasn't livid to begin with.</p>
<p>“It was wrong of me.” She stated, sounding a little rehearsed. “It wasn't my place to bring up the conversation especially since you never told me I could. Or that you were ready. It was something you should have shared in your own time.”</p>
<p>Harry crossed his arms and glared at her in silent judgment. “And who told you to say those things to me?”</p>
<p>Hermione winced. “Ginny.” She mumbled, a little embarrassed.</p>
<p>Harry sighed. If she had gone to Ginny then she knew she was in the wrong but didn't understand why. It wasn't that she was emotionally unaware, she wasn't, it was just that sometimes she didn't understand why he would wait to say something to Ron when he had already shared it with her. In her mind it was already out there, it just never occurred to her that he would wait or want to keep it between the two of them. And maybe that was also his fault; he should have told her that he wanted to tell Ron in his own time. It was possible that she hadn't been aware that he hadn't yet, but knowing Hermione that was probably unlikely.</p>
<p>“Hermione, I wasn't ready to tell Ron because I wasn't sure how he would have reacted. You took away the opportunity for us to have a proper conversation about it and have me ask him questions, and vice versa, that would make us both feel more comfortable around each other.”</p>
<p>She hesitated but shook her head. “You were going to tell him anyway and he was just being jealous of us and I didn't want him thinking there was something going on between us.”</p>
<p>“So instead of just telling him that, or telling him how you actually feel about him, you decided to tell him I liked Malfoy. A Slytherin who has insulted and bullied him since we were eleven. Tell me, if I walked up to him right now and told him you liked him, what would you do?”</p>
<p>“I'd be angry.” She said immediately. “That was something between you and me and you...ohh.” She looked up at him with tears in her eyes. “I'm such an idiot.”</p>
<p>Harry sighed again and dropped his arms. “Yes you are.”</p>
<p>“Can you forgive me?” She asked in a small voice as she wiped away a stray tear.</p>
<p>“Depends on whether or not you intend to do anything like that to me again.” Harry retorted.</p>
<p>“Never again.” She hiccupped. “I'll try to never do it again.” She amended after a slight pause.</p>
<p>Harry nodded. “Alright then. You can be my idiot again.”</p>
<p>Hermione whacked him on his upper arm but gave him a watery laugh before hugging him tightly. After she took a few minutes to compose herself she gave Harry a thoughtful look he didn't appreciate in the least.</p>
<p>“What is it now?” He asked, almost fearing the answer.</p>
<p>“It's about Draco.” She hedged carefully.</p>
<p>“What about him?”</p>
<p>“Do you like him because you like him, or do you like him because you can get back at Snape like this?”</p>
<p>Harry blinked. That was actually a fair question. “I don't think I know enough about him to answer that question.” He replied slowly.</p>
<p>Hermione frowned at that. “Do you want to find out?”</p>
<p>Harry snorted. “Of course I do. I'll just have to do it the old fashioned way.”</p>
<p>Hermione's frown didn't disappear but she did add a hint of disbelief. “The old fashioned way?”</p>
<p>“I'm going to ask him on a date.” He stated proudly, puffing up his chest. He appreciated the silence after his proclamation even if he wasn't a fan of the doubt on her face.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>~~~~~~</p>
<p> “You think we should what?” Malfoy - Draco - asked with so much bewilderment that Harry was a little surprised he had even managed to ask the question.</p>
<p>“Date.” Harry repeated with a strong nod.</p>
<p>“You think we should date?” Malfoy - Draco! - repeated.</p>
<p>That wasn't a good sign. Considering the fact that Draco was already partially in love with him and Harry was essentially using this information for his own gain, well, having the odds if your favor and still losing, that's not good. It also wasn't a good sign that he was thinking like this because Draco was a person that liked him and Harry wasn't in the business to be purposefully cruel.</p>
<p>Which was actually what the date was for. He needed to know if he could grow to like Draco. Grow to love him. He needed to figure out if he was doing this to get back at Snape or because he was genuinely looking for the real thing. Maybe that's why Draco scared him so much, since he was not only a real option but also an option to potentially last their entire lives. He was only sixteen for Merlin’s sake!</p>
<p>“I think we should go out and decide if we can even like each other like that.” Harry stated, echoing his own thoughts.</p>
<p>“Why would we need to do that?” Draco asked, a little offended.</p>
<p>“Because you're a bullying git that goes out of his way to make my life miserable every day?” Harry asked in a mixture of honesty and sarcasm.</p>
<p>“It's not as if you don't give as good as you get.” Draco hissed back defensively.</p>
<p>If Harry wasn't a hundred percent sure that Draco was possibly in love with him, he'd believe people when they said Draco hated him.</p>
<p>“You took one rejected gesture, <em>at eleven</em>, and milked it for all it was worth.” Harry deadpanned with a pointed look.</p>
<p>“Then why are you even standing here asking, no, telling me we should date?” Draco asked, waving his arms about in exaggerated aggravation.</p>
<p>“Because I think I might actually like you, you stupid git! You're smart, you can be funny, you're very sarcastic, and you have these really pretty flecks of green in your eyes.”</p>
<p>Draco blinked at him in the silence that followed. “Oh. Yes. No, that seems like a perfectly good reason to date. We should do that. We should date. You...you have, um, great hair.” Draco choked out awkwardly before clearing his throat, nodding formally at Harry and then walking away as quickly as he could without running.</p>
<p>“I have great hair?” Harry asked the empty space in bewilderment. “What the bloody hell is that supposed to mean?” Maybe dating boys wasn't going to be any easier than dating girls. If that was the case then Harry was officially screwed.</p>
<p>“It's not that nice.” A ghost commented, scaring Harry out of his skin.</p>
<p>“What?” Harry asked, trying to get his racing heart to calm.</p>
<p>“Your hair. It's far too scruffy to be nice. A little wild really. Looks a bit of a disaster if I'm honest.” The ghost said with a casual shrug of his shoulders before floating away.</p>
<p>Harry sighed deeply and turned back to stare at the hallway Draco had disappeared in. “Yeah. That's what I thought too.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>~~~***~~~</p>
<p> “What brings you both to my office?” Professor McGonagall asked, narrowing her eyes at the pair of them.</p>
<p>Harry wasn't sure if he should be offended or not but since he was with Hermione, he chose not to be. He couldn't be in trouble if Hermione was with him, could he? Plus, if he was being honest with himself, it wasn't as if he hadn't been in her office enough times when he was actually in trouble for her not to be suspicious of him when he came in willingly.</p>
<p>Hermione nudged his side and he grunted before clearing his throat.</p>
<p>“Er, right, yeah. I was wondering, and it's alright if it's not, I mean this is kind of odd and I'm sure as students we're not allowed to do this, but I kind of want to know so I'm here to ask you if we can?” Harry finished with a hopeful look.</p>
<p>Now, here was the thing: the information they wanted was either with Dumbledore or McGonagall but the easiest person for them to get to was McGonagall so here they were. It was also a happy happenstance that if they did need to go to the Headmaster, then the most logical way to get to the information they needed was going through the Deputy Headmaster who would have already given them the go-ahead. If all else failed, they always had the horrible option of the invisibility cloak and a bit of illegal searching. Harry fully realized that it was terrible logic, but it was the best they had at the moment.</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall stared at him for far longer than he was comfortable with until she turned to Hermione and raised her eyebrows.</p>
<p>“Harry would like to know if we could look up the names of the people in his parents year so he could owl them for pictures and stories about his parents.” Hermione dutifully translated.</p>
<p>Harry nodded in agreement and gave the professor his best hopeful smile. She looked at both of them carefully before answering.</p>
<p>“I had thought that Hagrid had gifted you something similar in your first year, had he not?” She asked sternly, looking at Harry.</p>
<p>Harry tried his very best not to gulp in guilt because, fuck, he had forgotten that minor detail. “Erm, yes, he did. It's just...I love the pictures and all, but I'd like to hear what they were like, you know? I don't really know a whole lot about them. Who were my mother's friends? What foods did she like to eat? What was her favorite colour? Did my dad swear a lot? I...it's...I don't have very much of them. I would be grateful for whatever they give me, professor.” Harry said as earnestly as he could.</p>
<p>He wasn't lying either, which probably helped his case. The only stories he had heard about his parents came from Sirius and most of those were about the Marauders and the pranks they pulled. He liked those just fine, loved hearing about them in fact, but he had never really heard anything about his mother and it had left him wanting. So while this was technically a ruse from start to finish, it was also something that he would actually like to have. Something real from the people that had known them best when they had been alive.</p>
<p>“This is very unusual, not to mention unethical.” Professor McGonagall stated firmly. “However, I do understand the desire to know more about ones parents.” She pursed her lips and tapped her wand against her desk in thought as Harry held his breath. “I'll allow it.” She stated.</p>
<p>Harry let out a whoosh of air. “You will?” He asked hopefully.</p>
<p>“Under two conditions.” Professor McGonagall stated sternly, Harry already nodding his head in agreement. “The first being you may never speak of this with other students, and the second that you do not hound anyone you do not get an answer from. Understood?”</p>
<p>“Yes professor!” Hermione and Harry said simultaneously.</p>
<p>“You will also not have unlimited access to this information so you will set up a day with me now. There will be no further dates as this will not become some sort of endless list of names you can simply badger at your own whim. Understood?”</p>
<p>“Yes professor.” Harry nodded quickly.</p>
<p>“We understand, thank you professor.” Hermione added on.</p>
<p>“Yes, thanks professor.” Harry echoed quickly.</p>
<p>It didn't take much more time for them to set up a time for them to come back tomorrow afternoon once classes were over. Professor McGonagall raised an eyebrow at the eagerness but thankfully didn't comment. Harry really didn't want to know what would happen if she ever learned the truth and prayed to all the gods that he could think of that she never would. They left quickly after that and went back to their common room to finish their homework for the day, meeting up with Ron so Hermione could make sure he finished his work as well.</p>
<p>“Do you think we'll be looking for a while?” Hermione asked as soon as Ron left to put his homework away.</p>
<p>Harry huffed in thought. “I don't think I'll be the one looking.” He said finally.</p>
<p>“What? That's the whole point of this, Harry!” Hermione reprimanded him, looking a little angry.</p>
<p>Harry rolled his eyes. “Calm down. I meant that we still have to put up a front with Professor McGonagall. It's not like we can leave without a list of names. So I'll have to write down names and you're going to have to look. If she comes in at any point and we have nothing...” He trailed off. “Besides, you’re better at research and you’d be faster in getting the name then I would be.”</p>
<p>“She'll know we're up to something if we don’t have at least something written down.” Hermione nodded thoughtfully. “It will probably take longer for me to find their name if I’m on my own. I just hope they're listed by year or we'll be in there for hours!” She lamented.</p>
<p>Harry snorted because he knew full well that she was already upset at the lost studying time and not the potential amount of names they would have to go through. He didn't even want to think of a scenario where McGonagall didn't leave the office at all. They should probably have started some kind of plan that included a scenario like that because it was the most likely outcome as they were handling private information that she was already very reluctant to let them have.</p>
<p>She was also the type of professor that liked to watch her students to make sure they didn't end up doing anything mischievous. That, and Harry had gotten into loads of trouble in the previous years and the odds that she would leave him on his own where very slim. Hermione or no Hermione.</p>
<p>Despite all of this, however, they were still banking on the fact that she would leave them alone for some unspecified period of time so they could enact their plan. Well, Harry did say his plans were never any good.</p>
<p>“What are you two talking about?” Ron asked as he sat down across from Harry and pulled out his chess board. Harry gave a pained groan but dutifully set up his half of the board.</p>
<p>“Harry wants some stories and pictures from people who knew his parents so we asked Professor McGonagall about getting those names. We're looking tomorrow.”</p>
<p>Ron scrunched up his nose at the thought of doing more work. “I don't have to help with that, do I?” He asked, looking a little hopefully at Harry.</p>
<p>Harry snorted in laughter and shook his head. “No mate, just me and Hermione this time.”</p>
<p>“Thank Merlin!” Ron sighed in relief before catching Hermione's distinctly unimpressed and disapproving look. “Erm, not to say that I wouldn't help, of course. Because it's important for you to find out things about your parents and all.” Ron quickly added on.</p>
<p>Harry laughed at him as he prodded one of the pieces to move. “Don't worry about it, its fine.” He knew what Ron meant after all.</p>
<p>Ron nodded but looked at Hermione for confirmation and gave her a weak smile when she just sniffed and buried her head in a book. “Close call.” Ron muttered under his breath. “Is this part of the thing you're doing that could change your future that you guys are doing?” Ron asked thoughtfully, looking up at Harry with narrowed eyes.</p>
<p>Harry met his look with one of his own. “Are you ready to give me a wizarding vow not to go divulging anything I tell you?” He asked instead.</p>
<p>Harry watched as Ron grunted but shook his head. “It's a wizarding vow, not something you just jump into.” He said as he moved a piece of his own that was far happier to listen to his commands than Harry's side. “It's not an Unbreakable vow, but magic can be funny about intentions sometimes and-”</p>
<p>“It's fine, Ron.” Harry interrupted.</p>
<p>Ron shook his head. “It's not. It's not something you should take lightly either.” Ron stated with a pointed look. “I need time to make sure the choice I make is something I can live with, whichever way I do choose.”</p>
<p>Harry nodded. “That's fair, but you'll need to stop getting your nose stuck in our business until you do decide.” Harry said before pleading with one of his pieces to at least try his strategy.</p>
<p>When it refused to listen, Harry resorted to the good old method of picking it up and plunking it down where he wanted it to go. He yelped in pain when the piece stabbed his finger in retaliation.</p>
<p>“Fucking things.” He muttered darkly as he glared at his rebelling pawns.</p>
<p>Ron chuckled at his antics but nodded. “Alright, I can try to do that. All you need to do is get better at chess.”</p>
<p>Harry decided to take his frustrations out on Ron and hexed him for the comment. Ron squawked and ducked out of the way before firing a jinx back at Harry. It would have devolved into an honestly epic battle if Hermione hadn't taken that moment to pop out of her book and read them the riot act before Ginny walked by and hexed her just because she could. Neither boy stuck around long enough to see how that fight turned out because they weren't brainless. They simply enjoyed the chaos from second hand accounts and listening to the noise from the top of the stairs (and very much out of sight).</p>
<p>It was a good night.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>~~~~~~</p>
<p> When they came in the next day after classes had ended, Professor McGonagall ushered them into her office before leaving to a side room and returning with a set of three fairly slim books.</p>
<p>“These are a list of names of the people a year above, the same year, and the year below your parents. You may have only these names. If you are referred to names outside of these years from the people that write back to you then you should. However I have my doubts that you would find many that would have been close to your parents.”</p>
<p>Harry nodded his head in thanks as he took the three books from his professor. “Thank you for this, professor. Really.” He said earnestly as he took the books from her outstretched hands.</p>
<p>Her expression softened the tiniest of bits as she smiled at him. “Don't take too long Mr. Potter; you still have homework to get to.”</p>
<p>He laughed and nodded before she told them she had a staff meeting and would be gone an hour. Honestly, Harry thought a bit dazed by the good news, sometimes plans just fall into place without you having to lift a finger.</p>
<p>“It shouldn't take you too long to write down the names of the people in your parent’s years, considering you have help.” Professor McGonagall stated as she gathered her things. “I therefore expect it shouldn't take up too much of your time to wait for me when you are finished. I am trusting you both.” She added as she was leaving.</p>
<p>“Merlin.” Harry muttered when she was gone. “She's got a way to make you feel guilty even when you're not doing something wrong, doesn't she?”</p>
<p>Hermione snorted as she opened one of the books. “We are doing something wrong.” She pointed out.</p>
<p>Harry waved the comment away as he grabbed the second book. “That's not the point, she doesn't know we're doing anything wrong.”</p>
<p>“But we are.” Hermione repeated as she turned the page.</p>
<p>Harry rolled his eyes and was just thankful to have the help so he stopped trying to argue with Hermione. “So, how do we go about this?”</p>
<p>Hermione looked up from her book to look around the room. “Right. Well, we were right about the records being by year, only every name is in there from the entire year. Thankfully they're written down with the houses they were in but they are in alphabetical order so it'll take you some time to write down the names.” She stated. “The rest of the books aren't here, so I'll have to go digging in the room Professor McGonagall came from and hope it’s the right one and not some place she just put the books to give to us later.”</p>
<p>“We have an hour.” Harry pointed out. “If we look together we'll get their name faster and then we can focus back on this.”</p>
<p>She snorted. “That's not as long as you think. Besides, didn’t you say before that I would be doing all the looking-up? Start with the year your parents were in and I'll come help once I'm done. If she comes in sooner I can read out the names and you write them down to make it look like we did it together since I won't have a list.” She advised. “It could be faster if we did it together, yes, but it could also take us the hour she's gone to find the name and if we don't have anything written down?” Hermione finished with a pointed look.</p>
<p>Harry wasn't completely sure he liked this but nodded in agreement anyway. It had been his plan after all, no matter his unease now. Knowing that this was out of his hands and he was relying solely on Hermione made his insides twitch. Not that he didn’t trust Hermione, just that if something went wrong, he would rather have it that he’d been a part of it.</p>
<p>Honestly, it was already more than a break that McGonagall was leaving them alone for a whole hour so they could get their sleuthing done. He didn't know which gods to thank for that, but it was one of the few times in his life that something he hoped for was actually coming true. ‘If you think too hard about it,’ Harry wondered privately, ‘do you jinx yourself even if you don't say the words aloud?’</p>
<p>“We won't have any warning that she'll be coming.” He cautioned her, coming back to their present predicament.</p>
<p>“No, but that's what the map is for.” She said with a sly smile as she took it out of her pocket.</p>
<p>“Hermione! Did you steal that from me?” Harry asked, both impressed and aghast that she would just take it from him.</p>
<p>“Temporarily borrowed it for a good cause.” She said proudly. “Now hurry up!”</p>
<p>“Right, right.” He replied, pulling a book towards him and opening it. “We are going to be having a long conversation about taking things that aren't yours.” He called out as she moved to the door McGonagall had come through.</p>
<p>The names were listed in alphabetical order like Hermione had said. Last name, first name, and the initial of the house they had been in followed by the years they had attended. He noticed quickly that not all the names attended to the end of the year they were supposed to. It was a stark reminder that his parents had grown up in a war and that by all accounts they had been lucky to live as long as they had. It wasn't a comforting thought at all.</p>
<p>He sighed deeply and started to write down all the Gryffindor names while also trying to keeping track of Hermione's movements by listening to the sounds coming from the room.</p>
<p>~~</p>
<p>“Found something yet?” He called out half an hour later as he stretched out and noticed she hadn't made any noise in some time.</p>
<p>He heard some shuffling before her head popped out of the doorway with her hair looking far wilder than it had when they came in and, boy, was that saying something considering the epic fluff of hair she usually had.</p>
<p>“Yes, I found the rest of the books but there's a bloody million of them and they don't exactly advertise the year on the spines or have any kind of logical order so it's taking a lot longer than I thought to find the book we're looking for. Not to mention the fact that I can’t do this by magic in case Professor McGonagall gets suspicious.” Hermione groused moodily.</p>
<p>“You might want to speed it up.” He warned her, understanding now why her hair was behaving the way it was. “She said she'd be gone only an hour and it's been half that already. We're running out of time.”</p>
<p>“I know that.” She whisper yelled angrily at him before popping away again. Yeah, he wasn't going to even bother with that.</p>
<p>He sighed deeply and wrote as quickly as he could to try and make it seem like he had been doing the work of two people instead of one. He frowned in thought as he remembered that Ron had told him that sometimes magic worked more with your intentions rather than with the spell you say. Well, he amended silently, that's not quite what he said, but that was what it came down to. So, if that was the case (and it wasn't something that was taught by any teacher so this was purely hypothetical and probably useless) maybe he could use his magic to intentionally do something. Maybe this was a bit like creating your own spell. He rubbed his nose as he thought hard about what he wanted his magic to do before he swished and flicked his wand.</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>He growled in annoyance and frowned heavily at the book in front of him. If spells were intention based (no matter what kind of spell it turned out to be since it was at its base simply magic) then it would make sense that accidental magic didn't need words at all. Now the question was whether or not this was because children didn't have the vocabulary needed for the spells or they simply didn't need the spell at all. When he apparated to the school roof he had just wanted to get away. When he shrunk Dudley's old sweater, it was because he really really <em>really</em> didn't want to be wearing something so horrendous. He hadn't had any spells for those. Magic had become easier with a wand as a focus, so if he now had more knowledge of magic itself and had a focus in which to do that magic, did he really need the spell?</p>
<p>Yes, ok, it was close to nonverbal casting, and maybe the principle of it was the same, but you essentially still said the spell in your head. So maybe what he needed was a little less thinking and a bit more...wishing. What he wanted was all the names of the Gryffindor’s on the parchment he had brought with him. Therefore, the most logical thing for his magic to do was find all those names and copy them onto his paper. That, specifically, was what he really needed right now. He also really needed to not get into trouble which unintentionally fueled his need just that bit more as he closed his eyes and let his hand follow his instincts. He violently flicked his wand to the side and upwards in a curving motion as he very strongly willed his magic to <em>please help him make this go faster</em>.</p>
<p>He felt a tingle of magic in the air and peeked one eye open to glance about the room. When he saw that nothing had changed, he sighed in resignation and grabbed his quill to continue to write the names down manually. He flicked a glance at his parchment to look at the last name he had written down and then looked back at the book when he stopped and quickly looked back at the parchment.</p>
<p>He exhaled a breath of stunned happiness because it <em>bloody worked</em>. It worked! He had done it! A whole year of names, neatly (ish, it was still his handwriting after all) written down one after the other. He then promptly felt intensely foolish because why on earth had he looked around the room if what he wanted was supposed to be on the parchment?</p>
<p>“Holy Merlin riding a dragon.” He whispered in awe, quickly pushing away any feelings other than happiness.</p>
<p>He quickly grabbed another book and opened it to the first page of names as he grabbed some fresh parchment and wrote the year at the top of it and repeated his wand movements and intent wishing. He didn't know how it worked, but knowing it had worked made it easier for him to accomplish it the second time. He didn't dare change any of his previous actions so he squeezed his eyes shut again and when he opened them, the parchment was once again filled with names. He let out a disbelieving laugh and sat back in his chair as he was filled with a pleased feeling of accomplishment.</p>
<p>Was this accidental magic based? Because he had clearly wanted it and he hadn't said a single spell. It wasn't as if this concept of magic was a new one either, so maybe this was some obscure branch of teaching that the professors just didn't have the time to go into.</p>
<p>“Harry!” Hermione called frantically from the other room, interrupting his moment of pride. “She's coming back early and I haven't found the name yet!”</p>
<p>“Fuck!” Harry yelled out and jumping up in surprise. “Hermione, what do you want me to do? I can't stall her! If she sees that you're not here, she'll get suspicious! I can't even pretend you're in the bathroom because the door is next to her desk!” He pointed out frantically as he ran towards her. “What do we do?” He asked as he found her quickly scanning each page before turning it as fast as she could.</p>
<p>“I don't know! I don't know! Come here and tell me when she gets a corridor away. We know where the books are now; we can use your cloak to come back if we have to!” Hermione said as she carried on scanning as quickly as she could.</p>
<p>Harry grabbed the map and it took a precious few seconds to find Professor McGonagall's name while his heart hammered away in his chest. “Fuck, she's right below us Hermione. You have to hurry!”</p>
<p>“Not helping.” Hermione ground out, irritated and stressed. “Go into the other room and pretend you're writing. If I'm standing and reading to you it'll be less suspicious!”</p>
<p>Harry practically ran from the room while he watched Professor McGonagall's steady march back to her office. He almost sighed in relief as Professor Sprout caught up with her and they seemed to stop. He also tripped over the chair he had been sitting in as he watched McGonagall's little dot on the map in case she moved again. He swore silently at his bruised shins but only gave them a cursory glance before plopping down on the chair and watching the map again.</p>
<p>“Hermione?” He called out. “You're running out of time.” He warned her, anxiety in his voice. “Two minutes!” He called out in warning, something that probably wasn't true but would give Hermione something tangible to hold onto time wise.</p>
<p>He watched in dejection as both teachers parted ways and McGonagall make her way back to them.</p>
<p>“Fuck.” He swore silently. She was on their floor. “Hermione!” He called out, more hysterical than last time. “Get out of there! She's coming! <em>She’s coming!</em>”</p>
<p>He heard some faint noises coming from the room Hermione was in before looking up and seeing his best friend rushing into the room again, shutting the door firmly behind her and running to the desk he was seated at. She picked up the book he hadn't gotten to yet by pure luck and quickly flipped the book open as she leaned on his desk. She took a deep breath and looked at him before he eyes widened in fright.</p>
<p>“Harry!” She moaned quietly in distress, eyes darting down to the table top. “The map! The map! Get rid of the map!”</p>
<p>Harry jumped and swore as he quickly muttered a mischief managed before folding the map as quickly as he could and shoving it into his pocket just as McGonagall opened the door. His eyes widened in fear before leaning down over his bag, stuffing the edges of the map into his pocket neatly while frantically grabbing some fresh parchment for the last book.</p>
<p>Sitting back up, he fumbled a little with the quill before grabbing it properly and turning to Hermione with a look her hoped was something on the innocent side instead of the fear and adrenaline he felt running through his veins.</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall strode in and looked over at them in suspicion. “Have you made good use of your time?” She questioned as she dropped her papers on her desk before walking over to them. Harry noticed Hermione's grip on the book in her hands turn a little tight as he smiled at his Professor.</p>
<p>“On the last one actually.” Harry said as brightly as he could. “It's a lot of names though.” He added, looking to the other two parchments off to the side that were full of names.</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall hummed as she walked around the desk and peered over his shoulder. She moved the top parchment over to look at the one beneath it and nodded at them both.</p>
<p>“You've gotten far. Just think of it this way Mr. Potter.” She said as she straightened up again. “If even half of these people send you any anecdotes at all, it would be quite a lot of new information for you to discover.”</p>
<p>He blinked at that, having never thought of the actuality of having to send the letters and receive replies. A slow smiled grew on his face as he thought of actually getting anything at all.</p>
<p>“Even one letter would be more than enough.” He said softly, looking up at McGonagall with a smile.</p>
<p>“Yes.” She replied with a warm smile. “Yes, I do suppose it would.”</p>
