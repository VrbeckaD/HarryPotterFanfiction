    <p>At this very moment, in a bedroom above a small, desolate church, young Credence was thirteen years, eighteen weeks, five days, twelve hours, and twenty minutes old. The pigeon that flew into his window was two years, twenty-seven weeks, three days, one hour, and eight minutes old… and not a minute older.</p><p>Credence flinched at the sound of the bird hitting glass, dropping the bible that had been clutched between his stinging palms. Tentatively, he crossed the room to the window where the pigeon lay motionless on the sill below, its head bent at an unnatural angle. He pushed up the window, filled with sadness for the bird’s plight and—for reasons he would never be able to recall later—touched a cautious fingertip to one grey wing.</p><p>In an instant, the formerly-dead pigeon was upright on its feet and then flying off into the night as if it had never crashed into his window in the first place. Credence had stared after the bird until it became only a speck in the distance and then looked down at his own hand in a mixture of wonder and fear.</p><p>This was the moment Credence realised he was not like the other children. Nor was he like anyone else for that matter. He soon learned that he could touch dead things (a cat that had been run over at the side of the road, a fly swatted angrily by his adoptive mother) and bring them back to life.</p><p>It was a gift from God, he presumed, or from the Devil perhaps, if Ma was right about his inherently wicked nature. He did not tell her about the ability, terrified that it would only make her more certain than ever that he was an aberration in the eyes of the Lord. The miraculous ability to restore life was not one anyone should possess, but possess it Credence did. He prayed each night to be able to understand the gift, the reason it was given to him, the terms of its use. No answer ever came.</p><p>Then, when Credence was seventeen years, two weeks, one day, six hours, and thirty-five minutes old, a blood vessel burst in his mother’s brain, killing her instantly one morning while she berated him in the back of their church.</p><p>He learned then that his was a gift that not only <em> gave</em>, but one that also <em> took</em>.</p><p>Credence crouched down beside the body, reached out to check for a pulse and, at the touch of his hand to her wrist, Mary Lou Barebone had jolted back into the land of the living. She picked up where she had left off with her punishing words but, sixty seconds that no one in particular was counting later, a sudden loud thud from the next room stopped her tirade where briefly dying had not.</p><p>On going to investigate, they found their pastor (a thoroughly vile man with a penchant for looking down the dresses of the female members of their congregation) dead on the floor in the middle of the aisle between the church pews.</p><p>This was the first of two discoveries about his ‘gift’ that Credence would stumble upon that day. The death of the pastor and subsequent distasteful experiments with a few spiders told him that reviving a person or animal for more than a minute carried the hefty price that another lifeform in the vicinity had to die.</p><p>The second discovery was that another touch from anyone he brought back to life would result in the permanent death he had previously spared them. That very night, Ma had struck him across the face and promptly dropped dead.</p><p>Credence’s life changed drastically after that, and all for the better. He was taken in by two kindly sisters by the names of Tina and Queenie Goldstein, a rookie police officer and an aspiring actress, respectively. Tina had already tried to help Credence while his mother was alive and jumped at the opportunity to do so after her death.</p><p>The sisters shared an apartment above their family’s restaurant, <em> The Pie Hole, </em> which Queenie ran half-heartedly while she waited for her big acting break. Tina and Queenie enjoyed the comfort of living together after their parents’ deaths some years ago and they were more than happy for Credence to stay in the recently-vacated apartment next to theirs. Queenie loved having him for a neighbour and particularly loved having someone she could teach to bake that wasn’t liable to set the building on fire like her sister was.</p><p>Credence found he had quite the talent for baking pies and he came to co-run <em> The Pie Hole </em> with Queenie. They settled into a happy routine where Tina went out to the police station each day and tried to climb the ranks, Credence made his pies quietly out of sight in the kitchen, and Queenie got to serve customers and be front of house like she wanted in order to people-watch. It strengthened her repertoire of human emotion and motivation, she said, already too perceptive for her own good.</p><p>Afraid of the dire consequences of his gift, Credence stopped using it except to occasionally ripen dead fruit for everlasting flavour. He never told Tina or Queenie about his macabre ability, nor any other living soul.</p><p>Of course, someone was bound to discover his secret sooner or later.</p><p>We pick up in the middle of our story—the love story, that is—six years, forty-five weeks, two days, four hours, and fifty-nine minutes after the irreversible death of Credence’s cruel adoptive mother.</p><p>(Heretofore known as <em> now</em>.)</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>“Sugar, I think you should take this order to table two.”</p><p>Credence turns his head to give Queenie a surprised look over his shoulder, hands still kneading dough on the table in front of him. “Why me?” he asks. “You know you’re better with the customers.”</p><p>“Well,” Queenie says, taking Credence by the arm and leading him over to the sink where she encourages him to wash the flour off of his hands with flapping gestures of her own. “I think this particular customer would prefer service with a smile from <em> you </em> rather than me.”</p><p>Credence stops rinsing his hands to gape at her. “He’s back again? This is the second time in two days.”</p><p>“And without Teenie this time too. I wonder where she is today...”</p><p>Feeling excitement bubbling up in his chest, Credence dries off his hands and then runs them anxiously through his hair. He just hopes it isn’t <em> too </em> dusted with flour.</p><p>“You look great, honey,” Queenie says, holding out the order in question—a slice of key lime pie. “Don’t keep him waiting now.”</p><p>Credence takes the plate from her with a nervous smile. He presses a kiss to her cheek in thanks before walking quickly out of the kitchen into the main restaurant.</p><p>There, in amongst all the colour of <em> The Pie Hole </em> with its rich brown wooden counter in the centre, the red cherry-shaped light fittings dropping from stalks, and the green and white checked tablecloths and floor tiles, sits Credence’s monochrome dream.</p><p>Detective “call me Percival” Graves is dressed in his typical work outfit of a dark suit and white shirt as he reclines a bit in his seat at his preferred table in the middle of the restaurant. It’s the one that has the best view into the kitchen where Credence can normally be found. Credence likes to think that’s why he chooses it every time.</p><p>Percival sits up straight on seeing Credence coming towards him with his pie, eyes sparkling and lips curving. He always smiles with his mouth closed. Credence always longs to see his teeth, even if they blind him like Queenie’s sometimes do.</p><p>“Hi,” Credence says when he gets to the table, hating the way it comes out more breathless and higher-pitched than he intended.</p><p>“Hi,” Percival replies, his voice low and <em> perfect </em> and the one Credence has heard in many, many nice dreams that he should not be remembering at all right now. Percival points at the plate in Credence’s hand. “Is that for me?”</p><p>Credence nods, feeling his cheeks start to burn already.</p><p>The slice of pie is a bigger helping than he or Queenie would normally cut for anyone else and it’s the one Credence already knows to be Percival’s favourite. He likes key lime pie best, followed by lemon meringue, followed by cherry. He isn’t over-keen on chocolate and he has a mild allergy to strawberries, which Credence had very nearly struck off the menu after learning that.</p><p>(Both Queenie <em> and </em> Tina had to talk him down, insisting he couldn’t abolish one of the most popular pie flavours they offered just because strawberries gave his crush a tingly feeling in the mouth. Credence, wishing to give Percival a tingly feeling in the mouth himself, had reluctantly acquiesced.)</p><p>Willing his hands to remain steady, Credence sets the plate down in front of Percival. “I hope you like it,” he says.</p><p>“I’m sure I will.” Percival picks up his fork but doesn’t dig in straight away, looking up at Credence with a frown. “Although… how did you know what I was going to order today?”</p><p>Credence’s face must be as red as the lampshade above them. He can just <em> hear </em> Queenie snickering from where she’s watching behind the counter. Meddlesome witch, he thinks uncharitably.</p><p>“Lucky guess.”</p><p>“Or you just know me too well,” Percival says, smiling warmly, his brown eyes fixed on Credence’s. It’s far too easy to get caught up in them.</p><p>With his palms growing clammy at his sides, Credence squeaks out, “it’s on the house!” and all but runs back into the kitchen. He can’t watch the man eat his pie—he found that out the <em> hard </em> way when he made the mistake of hanging around once to see Percival’s reaction the first time he served him lemon meringue pie.</p><p>No man should suck a fork like that or make <em> noises </em> like that in public. <em> Especially </em> if he’s then going to be outrageously oblivious to the effect that it has on the poor pie-maker watching.</p><p>As Credence passes Queenie on his determined way back to his safe haven, her giggles follow him through the double doors. The sound doesn’t make him smile in return like it usually would.</p><p>The facts are these: Percival Graves is the most handsome man to ever grace this establishment with his presence, he’s a wonderfully gentle, intelligent, thoughtful person, and Credence has no clue at all where he stands with him.</p><p>He’s been coming to <em> The Pie Hole </em> for months now since he transferred to Tina’s precinct and she dragged him through the door at lunchtime on his first day while he grimaced and said “I don’t even really like pie”.</p><p>That certainly changed after he tried Tina’s favourite banana cream pie (now his fourth favourite) at her insistence. He had then ordered his own slice and asked to see the pie-maker to compliment him on his work. Or rather, he had probably <em> meant </em> to compliment Credence solely on his work, but instead ended up complimenting him on something else when Queenie forced him to come out and speak with the happy customer.</p><p>Credence can still hear the proclamation even now. Percival’s first words to him were: “Jesus, you’re as edible as this damn pie.”</p><p>He’s never said anything at all like it since, never once been so forward with Credence again.</p><p>Credence wonders if his own <em> (stupid) </em> rabbit-in-the-headlights reaction had put him off or whether Percival really had just blurted that out without thinking and resolved not to do it again in future. He’s unfailingly polite whenever he visits the restaurant, always full of enthusiastic praise when it comes to Credence’s baking, and he’s a bit on the intense side when it comes to eye contact perhaps, but he doesn’t flirt or tease or even just <em> suggest </em> like Credence desperately wants him to.</p><p>He can’t do it himself. He hasn’t got the first idea how he would get the message across to Percival that he <em> like-likes </em> him and wants to hold his hand and kiss his mouth and stroke his hair and touch every inch of his body (even his feet, and Credence <em> hates </em> feet).</p><p>The best he can do is give him pie on the house—which only doesn’t bankrupt him because Percival leaves tips larger than the price of a whole pie—and channel all his love and devotion into the making of said pies.</p><p>One day, he thinks as he sprinkles flour and rolls out more dough and chops fruits, eyeing Percival through the porthole windows in the doors that separate the kitchen from the main restaurant. <em> One day.</em></p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>Percival Graves becomes the sole keeper of Credence’s secret on a remarkably ordinary Friday.</p><p>The sun is shining, the birds are singing, and Credence is just taking the trash out into the alleyway beside <em> The Pie Hole </em> when a man falls from the sky.</p><p>Unfortunately, the man hits one of the dumpsters with a sickening crunch, clearly dead on impact… and then bounces off the dumpster and back into Credence, hand brushing his face. The touch revives him immediately and, without missing a beat, the man makes to run off out of the alleyway.</p><p>It’s the stuff of Credence’s nightmares.</p><p>In a blind panic, Credence chases after him and gets close enough to touch the back of the man’s neck. The second he does, the man falls to the floor. Dead forever this time.</p><p>Credence shudders uncontrollably at what he’s just had to do, taking shallow, shaky breaths when nausea rises from the pit of his stomach up to his throat. That’s when he hears the one voice he most wants to hear in any other situation and <em> least </em> wants to hear in this one:</p><p>“Credence?”</p><p>Suddenly, Credence’s spine refuses to bend. He forces his neck to angle the right way and looks up towards the sound to see Percival staring at him from high up on the roof of the building to his left. He looks as stunned as Credence feels.</p><p>Percival’s Detective shield glints on his belt in the sunlight and it only takes Credence a few seconds to deduce that the dead man must have been a suspect he was chasing. It only takes a few seconds more to realise that the body at his feet could easily have been <em> Percival’s </em> and then he’s staggering away from that body to be violently sick into one of the bins.</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>“Thank you,” Credence murmurs, extricating his hands from within the folds of Percival’s jacket where it’s been generously draped around his shoulders to accept the mug of steaming tea that Percival is holding out to him.</p><p>He feels foolish—sat here in a café in the best possible version of a shock blanket with Percival buying him sweet tea and watching him avidly like he might faint at any moment. He’s got his ‘concerned’ face on, the angle of his mouth and eyebrows plainly expressing his consternation. It all seems unnecessary, but then Credence remembers his chattering teeth and his trembling fingers and his weak legs and he has to admit that maybe it’s the opposite.</p><p>It’s nice that he <em> is </em> concerned, really, and getting to wear Percival’s jacket is definitely nice too. He spent the whole time Percival was queuing to get his tea with his nose pressed into the fabric so he could inhale the comforting scent that clung to it.</p><p>The café is crowded enough that they shouldn’t be overheard while they talk, but Percival had glowered at a lingering teenage couple when they came in to garner them this particular small booth in the corner out of earshot anyway.</p><p>“I gave an anonymous tip,” Percival tells him, taking his seat again. “I- um... I hadn’t called for backup like I should have done, luckily. Someone will come to get the body and no one but me will know about your involvement now. So you don’t need to worry.”</p><p>“Good,” Credence says. He lifts his cup to his mouth. Barely feels the tea scald down his throat. Coughs. “That’s good.”</p><p>Percival smiles and takes the mug from him, setting it down on the table beside Credence’s other hand. “Maybe give that a minute,” he says, voice as gentle as his fingers that he lays over the top of Credence’s.</p><p>The touch—something that Credence is unused to even as a rule with the <em> living</em>—startles him. He would have sent his cup flying if not for Percival’s hand pressing down on his firmly. The unyielding weight of it grounds him and Credence shuts his eyes to savour the feeling.</p><p>Admittedly, this is <em> not </em> the context he wanted for the first touch he was to receive from Percival Graves, but that’s not to say it’s unwelcome. At least Percival is willing to touch him, now he’s found out the truth.</p><p>“You’re okay,” Percival says. “It’s all okay, Credence. Just tell me what you want to, and leave out what you don’t.”</p><p>And so Credence tells him everything. The pigeon and the flies, the rabbit and the spiders and the cat he knew he couldn’t keep but wanted to. He tells him about his adoptive mother and the pastor. That homeless man he checked on once. All the fruit.</p><p>He tells him about his life in the church. About coming to stay with Tina and Queenie, about finding a home at last, friends, a vocation, a place in the world.</p><p>The only thing Credence leaves out is the part about being in love with him.</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>Things get back to a relative normality after that, strangely enough. Percival doesn’t breathe a word about his ‘gift’ to anyone, nor does he speak about it with Credence. The only change is a pleasing one: he starts to visit <em> The Pie Hole </em> every day.</p><p>Sometimes he comes in with Tina, sometimes by himself when Tina is busy or wanting to spend her lunch break somewhere else (likely with that floppy-haired animal-expert English guy she met on a case and became so fond of).</p><p>Sometimes Percival sits at his usual table and has a slice of pie that Credence still gives him ‘on the house’ in their laughable running gag. Sometimes he just orders a coffee and then perches on one of the stools at the counter, chatting to Queenie while he eats things that are <em> not </em> pie that he’s brought with him, and making Credence blush when he catches Percival looking at him through the windows into the kitchen.</p><p>It gets to the point where Percival comes in to see him so often that Credence just opens the doors to his domain with a sigh and Percival gets his own chair in the corner of the kitchen where he can watch Credence baking and talk to him about whatever he fancies. Weather, the news, politics, a film he caught the second half of the other night when he got home late, anecdotes from the precinct… anything but death.</p><p>Then, one Wednesday lunchtime, he <em> does </em> want to talk death.</p><p>“Excuse the pun,” he says, shifting awkwardly on his chair while Credence whisks egg yolks, “but I’m at a dead end with this case of mine. I hate to ask, but it’s dragging on now and I was wondering if you might be able to help.”</p><p>“Help how?” Credence asks. He puts his mixing bowl down to give Percival his full attention.</p><p>Percival waggles his fingers in the air. The gesture looks almost comical, considering how serious he usually is. “With your gift, if you’d be comfortable doing it. I just need one minute to speak with this vic. It’s a hit and run case, so he might have seen his killer.”</p><p>“Oh, you want me to… oh.”</p><p>It’s the first time Credence has ever even <em> thought </em> of using his ability in that way. It fills him with dread, but he doesn’t want to admit that to Percival. It’s perhaps the most noble, <em> useful </em> application of his strange talent. He should feel glad to do it, not terrified.</p><p>“We’ll be careful,” Percival says. He pulls his left shirt cuff back to expose his watch, tapping the face. “You touch the guy, we’ll ask a couple of questions while I count the minute with this, and then you touch him again and he goes back to resting in peace.”</p><p>Credence knows the dread he feels is just a lingering hang-up from hiding his ability from everyone in his life. It’s been nice, actually, having someone know this side of him. He loves and trusts Tina and Queenie without reservation and knows they love him the same, but there’s always been a part of him that felt they would cast him out if they knew his secret. That part shrinks a little every day that Percival arrives at <em> The Pie Hole </em> and heads straight into the kitchen with a smile, talking to him like a friend, as if Credence were the normal person he so badly wants to be.</p><p>That unconditional acceptance, that burgeoning confidence… they’re things Percival has given him and helped cultivate in him. Denying him help now would be a poor way to pay him back for those priceless gifts.</p><p>“Okay,” he says. “I’ll do it.”</p><p>“I’ll be right there with you,” Percival says at once. “I won’t leave you on your own in this, Credence, not for one second.”</p><p>Credence attempts a smile for him. “I appreciate that,” he says, dismayed when it comes out as a whisper.</p><p>Percival does something then that he hasn’t since that fateful day when Credence sat in the café with him, warmed by his jacket and his presence. He gets up, comes to Credence’s side, and then he reaches out and covers Credence’s hand with his own.</p><p>Credence looks down at their hands, heart racing at the sensation of skin on skin and at Percival’s sheer proximity to him. Percival radiates warmth in the tiny space left between their bodies and it feels almost surreal to be so near to him at last.</p><p>It feels like he might just be about to get everything he wants.</p><p>Credence turns his head to look at Percival and finds an unreadable expression on his too-close face. His eyebrows are drawn together like he’s confused, but his mouth looks ready to smile.</p><p>Feeling emboldened, needing to push things one way or the other, Credence turns his hand over beneath Percival’s and laces their fingers together.</p><p>Percival sucks in a sharp breath. “Credence,” he says quietly, “I—”</p><p>The doors to the kitchen crash open then and Queenie bursts through them. Percival hurriedly withdraws his hand and steps back. Credence’s hand turns cold at once.</p><p>“That <em> Grindelwald! </em> ” she exclaims, as close to angry as she ever gets. “I swear, if he comes back again I’m going to <em> ban </em> him, and I’ve never banned anybody from this restaurant!”</p><p>She rants on for a few minutes about the bigotry of their most-hated customer and Credence forcibly reminds himself of all she’s done for him over the years while he looks at Percival from beneath his lashes and wishes she hadn’t interrupted.</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>The morgue is somehow not as unpleasant as Credence was expecting. It’s cold and clinical, sure, but it doesn’t frighten him the way he thought it would. It just makes him sad to think <em> this is it</em>, this is where bodies end up. Like the man who fell onto the dumpster all those weeks ago.</p><p>An ammonia-like scent hangs in the air of the autopsy room, lightly stinging Credence’s eyes. Percival seems used to it.</p><p>“Are you all right?” he asks, hand ready on the correct stainless steel drawer. “If you aren’t, just say. You don’t have to do this.”</p><p>Credence inhales deeply through his mouth and decides it might be an idea to perhaps take all further breaths through his mouth as well. “I’m fine. I want to help.”</p><p>He looks down at the scuffed, off-white toes of his converse sneakers and regrets not changing into something more formal after work. Their casualness seems inappropriate for the setting, more so when Percival is suited and booted like usual.</p><p>He doubts the dead man will care about his shoes though, in the end.</p><p>Percival pulls the drawer open and steps back from it to give Credence space, raising his left arm to be able to look at his watch. “Take your time,” he says. “I’m ready when you are.”</p><p>The murder victim, Eric Boyce, was forty-nine years, seven weeks, three days, eight hours, and twelve minutes old at the time of his death. According to Percival, he ran a successful funeral home (aren’t all funeral homes successful? They can never be short of clients, Credence thinks) with his business partner, one Michael Williams. Apparently, Mr. Boyce was hit by a car not long after he left work on the same day he was discovered stealing jewellery from one of the bodies in the funeral home.</p><p>The elderly widower who did the discovering had a good alibi: he was reporting Mr. Boyce to the police (across town and in person, for he was a firm believer in expressing one’s outrage face-to-face). The business partner—who had since claimed no knowledge of the plundering of their deceased clients’ possessions—had a far more tenuous alibi: he was home tending to his sick mother.</p><p>“A right cantankerous old sow,” Percival had said to Credence on the car ride over to the morgue. “She’d say anything to save her precious son though. I’m <em> sure </em> Williams was in on the corpse-robbing and he didn’t want Boyce to drag him down too after he got found out.”</p><p>Hopefully, the dead man himself will be able to prove or disprove Percival’s theory. Credence slowly pulls the sheet back from his face, careful not to touch Mr. Boyce when he folds it down to the level of his armpits. He looks at the portly man with as much detachment as he can, taking in his round face, his greying moustache and sideburns, the scar over his left eyebrow.</p><p>“Okay,” Credence says decisively. “Start timing.”</p><p>Percival does, and the sound of ticking fills the otherwise silent room.</p><p>Credence touches his fingertip to one cold, bristly cheek. He feels a zip of static electricity pass between them and the formerly-dead man sits bolt upright with a gasp. The sheet Credence had just folded down now falls further with gravity to expose a flabby chest covered in sparse silver hair. Mr. Boyce’s eyes snap open and his chalk white face suddenly blooms with colour.</p><p>“We don’t have much time,” Credence says before Boyce can begin to freak out. “I’m Credence, this is Percival, and we want to you ask a few questions, if that’s okay?”</p><p>“Is this about the jewellery?” Boyce asks, voice testy. “Because you can go bother Michael about that, okay? It was his idea. I’m sorry if I took your grandma’s favourite locket or whatever, but I’ve already been hit by a car today and there’s not a lot else you can do to me.”</p><p>Credence glances at Percival at that. He was expecting a triumphant look over being right about Michael Williams and his part in the stealing, but if Boyce had gained colour in his cheeks, Percival seems to have lost most of his. He was already looking sallow under the harsh strip lighting above.</p><p>It must be unnerving, Credence thinks, for him to see this. It’s one thing to know what Credence does and to have seen it briefly from a distance. It’s quite another to see it up close like this.</p><p>Unnerved or not, he’s still dutifully looking at his watch.</p><p>“Who was the driver?” Credence asks, deciding it’s probably sensible if he continues with the questioning and Percival continues to keep an eye on the time.</p><p>“That asshole Michael, of course! Son of a bitch didn’t want me to give away that he was as neck-deep in loot as I was!”</p><p>There it is. When Credence looks at Percival this time, he’s still pale, but he’s grinning a little. His expression sobers and he nods at his watch. “Thirty seconds left, Credence.”</p><p>That’s more time than he thought they would have. They’ve got their confirmation about the business partner being the murderer, at least. It’s all gone quite smoothly, much to Credence’s surprise.</p><p>“Do you… have any last words, Mister Boyce?” he asks. “Do you regret the stealing and maybe want to repent?”</p><p>Boyce makes a rude ‘pfft’ noise and rolls his eyes. “My only regret is that I got caught. And that I never <em> did </em> shift enough weight to be able to move fast enough to avoid speeding cars.”</p><p>Frowning, Credence leans forward and taps him in the centre of the forehead. Boyce falls back down onto the drawer with a thud.</p><p>“Well,” Percival says. He stops his watch and lowers his arm.</p><p>“Yes,” Credence agrees.</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>Credence is scrolling endlessly through Netflix when his intercom buzzer goes off. It’s been about an hour since Percival dropped him home after their furtive morgue visit and the clock in the corner of Credence’s laptop screen tells him it’s 21:32, which is an odd time for a visitor.</p><p>When he goes to the hallway and presses the button for his mysterious visitor to talk, he’s taken aback to hear Percival’s voice crackling through the speaker.</p><p>“It’s Percival again. I’m sorry it’s late, I just really wanted to give you something to say thanks for tonight.”</p><p>Credence’s heart falters in his ensuing panic. He’s in pyjamas right now—a joke gift from Queenie for his last birthday—and they have half-eaten pies printed all over them in a repeating pattern. Worse than that is the joke printed on both sides of the button-up top:</p><p>“What’s the best thing to put into a pie?” asks the front.</p><p>“Your teeth!” answers the back.</p><p>It is, perhaps, the worst, least sexy outfit he could be wearing for this unexpected visit. Not that any of his outfits <em> are </em> particularly sexy.</p><p>“Um, just a second!”</p><p>He presses the button to allow Percival entry into the building and then runs back into his bedroom to change. Unfortunately, he trips over his <em> own damn feet </em> in his haste and before he can get back up, there’s a brisk knocking at the front door.</p><p>Percival moves fast.</p><p>“Just a second!”</p><p>“I won’t stay long!” Percival calls back. “Don’t tidy anything up on my account.”</p><p>Credence freezes. He was so preoccupied with fixing his appearance that he plain forgot about the state of his apartment. If Percival comes in, he’ll see Credence’s growing piles of neglected problems like the bowls and plates and cutlery needing to be washed up in the kitchen and the unironed clothes that he’s poorly folded and left on the sofa in the living area.</p><p>When he first came to live here, Credence kept the place pristine. Tina and Queenie were always shocked to see the apartment so immaculate and impersonal while theirs was chaotic but cosy. Over time though, his Ma’s voice in the back of his head (usually saying “cleanliness is next to Godliness”) faded and he stopped fearing punishment for sloth. He then started to derive a bizarre sort of pleasure from deferring his chores in favour of reading or listening to music or binging on movies and television shows he’d never been allowed to watch before. He had a <em> lot </em> to catch up on.</p><p>“Credence?”</p><p>In the end, Credence doesn’t have time to fix himself <em> or </em> his place and he winds up answering the door in his ridiculous pie-print pyjamas and trying to conceal the inside of his apartment by keeping the door half-closed and standing in the gap.</p><p>“Hey,” he says, heart pounding, already out of breath. This just shows how unfit he is, probably.</p><p>Percival stands in the doorway with a bouquet of flowers in one hand, still dressed in his suit and looking as devastatingly handsome and put-together as ever. He gives Credence a once over that has him blushing to the roots of his hair. “Cute pyjamas,” he says with a smirk.</p><p>Credence wants to <em> die</em>, and permanently at that. No coming back, he thinks, he doesn’t ever want to have to relive this moment. “Thank you,” he mumbles.</p><p>“What’s the answer?”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Percival points at his chest. “The best thing to put into a pie.”</p><p>Maybe Credence <em> will </em> die. Maybe he’ll end up in one of those drawers in the morgue and the cause of death on his certificate will just read ‘embarrassment’. “Oh, um,” he says, “I’ll just…”</p><p>He turns around and Percival laughs like the joke is the best one he’s ever been told. When he turns back to face him, Percival stops laughing, but a smile remains and Credence can’t help returning it, despite how silly he feels.</p><p>Percival thrusts the bouquet out towards him. The flowers in it are a colourful selection: orange gerbera daisies, red germini, yellow sunflowers, and purple agapanthus.</p><p>“I don’t know why I bought flowers,” Percival says, lifting his free hand to rub the back of his neck. “Do you like flowers? Actually, I do know why: it’s because the florist was the only place open at this hour. What I really don’t know is why I live two blocks from a twenty-four hour florist, but it comes in handy sometimes.”</p><p>He’s talking faster than Credence has ever heard him talk before. Like he’s <em> nervous</em>. The thought makes Credence’s mouth go dry. “Do you… often need flowers at half past nine at night?”</p><p>Percival grimaces. “No. No, I’ve never even been in there before tonight, in fact.”</p><p>“Right.”</p><p>They look at each other awkwardly for a few seconds. Percival shakes the bouquet in his hand slightly and stretches it out further towards Credence.</p><p>“Oh!” Credence says, taking the gift. The cellophane wrapping crinkles during the exchange. “Thank you. I do like flowers, by the way. I really like them.”</p><p><em> I really like them? </em> Credence despairs over himself internally. He tries again: “I mean… these are beautiful. A great choice.”</p><p>It’s not a lot better, but Percival smiles at the compliment, eyes cast shyly down towards his shoes. He’s so lovely in that moment that Credence asks without thinking, “Do you want to come in?”</p><p>Percival can see the mess in his apartment, he tells himself, if it means he’ll stay for longer.</p><p>Percival’s smile turns rueful and he meets Credence’s gaze again. “I’d better get home,” he says. “I shouldn’t have disturbed you at this time. I just… I wanted to thank you, but I also wanted to check you were okay. I feel bad for pressuring you into helping with my case.”</p><p>Credence clutches the flowers to his chest, right over where a delicious warmth is spreading, immeasurably pleased to know that Percival was <em> worried </em> about him.</p><p>“I’m okay, honestly. Don’t feel bad; I <em> wanted </em> to help, like I said. I’d do it again. It’s the best use for what I can do and I want to be useful to you.”</p><p>Percival frowns a little at that, which Credence finds confusing. He thought Percival would welcome the offer of future assistance.</p><p>Perhaps he’s overstepped and Percival thinks Credence is casting aspersions on his skills as a Detective. The idea makes his stomach drop and he’s just about to start back-pedalling when Percival says, “You don’t have to be <em> useful</em>, Credence, not to me. You’re my friend and the last thing I want is to end up using you. I hate that I’ve dragged you into my world tonight. Someone as good and pure as you doesn’t belong in a morgue.”</p><p>Credence doesn’t know how to respond to that.</p><p>He’s never felt especially <em> good </em> or <em> pure </em> in his life. Mary Lou Barebone made sure of that. He was wicked, she told him. Sinful, hellbound, and rotten to the core. It’s somewhat overwhelming now to have the best man he knows saying the exact opposite.</p><p>Credence suddenly wants nothing more than to thank him in some way. He wants to ask Percival to come in again and he wants the underlying meaning to be <em> obvious </em> as he does. The only thing he has to offer is himself and he would, if he thought for one second that Percival might accept him.</p><p>He won’t. Whether from lack of desire or innate morals, Credence just knows he would never do it.</p><p>“I want to be in your world though,” he says eventually, putting the weight of his sincerity behind it. “If I can help you get justice for someone, I want to do it.”</p><p>Percival takes a step forward and his fingers reach out to gently sweep a lock of Credence’s hair around his ear, tucking it out of the way. Credence unfortunately flinches at the intimate touch and Percival pulls his hand back at once.</p><p>“You’re incredible,” Percival says, the words soft and awed.</p><p><em> Come in, </em> Credence thinks desperately, as if the force of his thoughts could make them audible to Percival somehow. <em> Stay with me tonight. </em></p><p>Percival isn’t a mind-reader though. He smiles again and says, “Goodnight, Credence.”</p><p>Careful not to crush his flowers between them, Credence leans forward, shuts his eyes, and presses a quick kiss to Percival’s cheek. The stubble there is just slightly rough against his lips. Credence can hear his blood surging in his ears when he rocks back on his heels, anxiously watching Percival’s face for his reaction.</p><p>His mouth is parted in surprise. He doesn’t look upset or angry, thankfully. His mouth closes and spreads into a smile and he lifts his hand to touch the spot Credence had just kissed.</p><p>“Goodnight, Percival.”</p><p>Percival leaves then with a nod and Credence shuts his door after he goes into the stairwell and out of sight. When he’s got the door closed, he ends up having to lean against the solid wood of it, breathing heavily and cursing missed opportunities.</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>Credence does everything he can to prolong the life of the flowers Percival brought him.</p><p>He recuts the stems at an angle religiously every day. He changes the water daily too, adds plant food, and gets rid of any leaves at the bottom of the vase to stop bacteria growing. He keeps the flowers out of direct sunlight on the counter in his kitchen where it tends to be cooler.</p><p>Despite his best efforts, they still wilt within a fortnight.</p><p>When the last sunflower dies, Credence goes downstairs to the restaurant and stocks up his fruit bowl when he returns to his apartment.</p><p>With his sacrifice ready, he touches the head of every decaying, drooping flower in the vase. He beams when the stems turn rigid and stand up straight again. Before his eyes, the faded blooms regain their vibrant colours. Beneath his fingertip, the curling petals stretch out and lose their dryness, becoming velvet soft once more.</p><p>They will stay beautiful like this for an eternity now, provided Credence never touches them again.</p><p>He sits on a stool at the kitchen counter after that, looking between the rejuvenated flowers and the digital clock on his oven.</p><p>He waits.</p><p>When 10:34 becomes 10:35, the strawberries in his fruit bowl all shrivel and turn brown.</p>
