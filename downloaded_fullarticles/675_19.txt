    <p>Harry stumbled through the forbidden forest, tired from defeating Voldemort, and stopped to rest against a tree. He noticed a small, dark-haired form several feet away, laying at the base of another tree. He approached the form, panting with the effort of keeping himself upright and in motion, and noticed that the little boy looked very familiar—and Harry could feel his emotional state.</p><p> </p><p>He was just as exhausted as Harry, and was unharmed but for that fact, and Harry realized the little boy was what was left of the horcrux that had been in him. This young Tom Riddle could be given a second chance at life, if only he was raised right this time around.</p><p> </p><p>Harry knelt, curled himself protectively around the young boy, and let blackness claim him at last, hoping that when he was found, he would not be separated from the boy he had plans to take under his wing and place in a healthy, loving home.</p><p> </p><p>Perhaps history would right itself if given a chance.</p><p> </p><p>*****</p><p> </p><p>Harry woke to a feeling of panic that was not his own. He sat bolt upright in bed, looking for Tom before he realized he was in some kind of Manor House… Or perhaps a castle? It was stone, like much of Hogwarts was, so castle seemed more likely.</p><p> </p><p>But Tom was nowhere to be seen, and as Harry searched the room with his eyes, a house-elf popped into the room.</p><p> </p><p>“You are awake. Good.” The elf said, moving to Harry’s side and snapping its fingers. A long sheet of parchment appeared in front of it, which it grabbed and began to read.</p><p> </p><p>“Um, hello. Is there a young boy here? I should have been found near one…” Harry began as the panic only increased.</p><p> </p><p>The elf frowned and looked at him. “Yes. Wilky is with him.” He answered in perfect English.</p><p> </p><p>Harry was shocked, but was more focused on Tom. “He’s never seen a house-elf before, that must be why he is panicking!” He explained.</p><p> </p><p>The elf looked offended. “I am <em>no</em> house-elf! I am an <em>ancient</em> elf, and have been entrusted with keeping Ansiar Estate running smoothly in preparation for future Ansiars!”</p><p> </p><p>“Um… Could you just have the boy be brought here so I can calm him down?” Harry asked.</p><p> </p><p>The elf sighed and snapped, and Tom was dropped into Harry's lap with a high-pitched scream of terror. He noticed Harry and clung to him, nearly strangling him as he wrapped both arms and legs around him.</p><p> </p><p>“Thanks.” Harry managed to choke out. “Now, who are you, and what is an Ansi-whatever?”</p><p> </p><p>The elf sniffed. “<em>I</em> am Rinkle, the head elf here. I deal directly with any True Subs in residence, and that means <em>you</em>.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry blinked as Tom whimpered. “It’s alright.” He said to the boy. “They won’t hurt us. I know this is all very strange, but just stick close to me, and I will figure things out.” He assured Tom. “You’re safe with me.” He turned back to the elf. “Well, Rinkle, what exactly am I doing here? And where is here, for that matter.”</p><p> </p><p>“I told you already, this is Ansiar Estate.” He said less than patiently, his eyes adding an unspoken ‘duh’ to his statement.</p><p> </p><p>Harry nodded. “Yes, sorry. What is an Ansiar, then? I’ve never heard of them.”</p><p> </p><p>“You wouldn’t have.” Rinkle stated simply. “They were before written records, and secretive besides. There are some tablets with vague information, but I doubt you can read hieroglyphs any better than the last boy that was brought here could, can you?”</p><p> </p><p>Harry frowned. “’Fraid not.” He said.</p><p> </p><p>Rinkle shook his head. “Then they will avail you little. You’ll have to learn as you go, like he has been. Take this.” He held out a ring.</p><p> </p><p>Harry took it and looked at it. “What is it?”</p><p> </p><p>“The Master ring to the Estate. It will wake the grounds and can only be worn by a True Submissive, as the Ansiars have always been governed by the Subs. You are the effective leader of your race right now.” Rinkle smiled. “All two of you.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry rolled his eyes and put the ring on. “Goody.” He said flatly.</p><p> </p><p>Rinkle chuckled. “You will need to be careful with your new powers, and you should check a mirror and weave a glamour—an unbreakable one—before you leave.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry frowned. “Unbreakable?” He echoed.</p><p> </p><p>Rinkle nodded. “Yes. You must be very careful, but you will find creating new spells come <em>extremely </em>easily to you now. And you can do most anything. The world is <em>literally</em> at your fingertips now.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry gave him a blank stare. “How do I use these supposed ‘great’ powers, then?”</p><p> </p><p>“You simply think of what you want to do, assign an appropriate word unless it is a private spell you don’t intend to teach to Wizards, and do it. The magic will bend to your will.”</p><p> </p><p>“Right.” Harry said doubtfully. “We’ll see.”</p><p> </p><p>Tom looked up at Harry as the teen set him on his feet. “Magic?” He asked curiously.</p><p> </p><p>Harry smiled. “Yes. I am a Wizard, and so are you.” He answered.</p><p> </p><p>“<em>You</em> are an <em>Ansiar</em>.” Rinkle corrected.</p><p> </p><p>Tom looked at him. “Am <em>I</em>?”</p><p> </p><p>Rinkle gave him a flat look. “Not yet. You are under the protection of one, apparently, though, so you have nothing to fear from any other magical folk.” He answered the boy. “When it is time, you will be.”</p><p> </p><p>Tom smiled brightly and looked up at Harry. “Mister, what’s your name?” He asked, holding his hand as Harry began to head out of the room he was in.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m Harry Potter. I’m… Kind of famous, you’ll have to be ready for that.” He mumbled, finding a bathroom and looking in the mirror.</p><p> </p><p>He recoiled in shock at his reflection. He was surprised Tom hadn’t become even more scared at seeing him.</p><p> </p><p>The most prominent difference was his new…</p><p> </p><p>“Wings!” Harry whispered in awe. The wings behind him fluttered.</p><p> </p><p>Tom nodded. “You look like an angel, Mister Harry!” He said.</p><p> </p><p>“They're <em>blue</em>.” Harry murmured.</p><p> </p><p>“To match your hair!” Tom chirped happily, and Harry noticed a lock of hair hanging into his eyes on the left that glowed an ice-blue colour. That did, indeed, exactly match his wings.</p><p> </p><p>He noticed as he spoke that he had fangs, too. They weren’t <em>razor</em>-sharp, but they were definitely dangerous-looking. And try as he might, they wouldn’t disappear. His ears were also pointed rather prominently, and he groaned. “I’m an <em>elf</em>.” He said dejectedly. That was hardly intimidating.</p><p> </p><p>His eyes, on the other hand, had undergone some radical changes. They were more almond-shaped than before, and the left had lightened to an emerald green hue, while the right had become a striking, dark violet. Harry admired them for a few minutes. He'd stand out even more now. Unless he came up with a way to cover them.</p><p> </p><p>His features were more rugged now, but he still had some softness to his features, probably owing to his Submissive nature, and said features had somehow become more aristocratic-looking. He looked a bit more like the Blacks he’d seen pictures of.</p><p> </p><p>Aside from his ice-blue streak, the rest of his hair had turned jet black, and Harry found he quite liked it that way.</p><p> </p><p>He spread his wings and gasped. It was a good job the bathroom was so big, because his wingspan had to be around ten feet!</p><p> </p><p>He was also more toned than he remembered being. He'd had a bit of muscle already (fighting dark Wizards yearly tended to cause muscle growth), but now he was actually quite impressed with his body. He was going to make sure it stayed as good as it looked right now!</p><p> </p><p>“So, Mister Harry?” Tom asked.</p><p> </p><p>Harry looked down and smiled. “Yes, Tom?” He asked.</p><p> </p><p>Tom beamed at the knowledge that Harry already knew his name. “You said I’m a <em>Wizard</em>?”</p><p> </p><p>Harry nodded. “That’s right.” He agreed.</p><p> </p><p>Tom smiled. “So the weird things I can do are <em>magic</em>, right? And not the devil in me?” He asked hopefully.</p><p> </p><p>Harry snorted and knelt down to Tom’s level. “It’s not the devil. If it was the devil, he’d be in <em>me</em>, too. Do I look like I have the devil in me?” He asked.</p><p> </p><p>Tom shook his head wildly. “No, you’re an <em>angel</em>!” He said.</p><p> </p><p>Harry smiled. “And if you can grow up kind and good, you'll become one, too.” He promised.</p><p> </p><p>Tom looked thrilled. Then, his face fell. “What if I'm <em>bad</em>?” He asked.</p><p> </p><p>Harry shook his head. “You won’t be. Just do your best, but I trust you.” He told the boy, then stood and focused on his reflection.</p><p> </p><p>Tom shuffled his feet as he stared at the ground for a while, while Harry tried to decide what his glamour should look like. When Harry almost had it figured out, a soft whisper distracted him.</p><p> </p><p>“Sometimes I do bad things. When I’m angry.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry stopped short and knelt down again, taking Tom's shoulders in his hands and giving them a reassuring squeeze. “You will learn to control it; I swear to you. And it will be your choices that shape who you are. You are your own master, no one else can live your life. But if you try, and learn to control your temper, you will become a fine young man someday.”</p><p> </p><p>Tom smiled. “A fine young <em>Ansiar</em>?” He asked.</p><p> </p><p>Harry chuckled. “Just so.” He agreed.</p><p> </p><p>Tom watched Harry silently as he covered his new features with a glamour, and then managed to get his wings to retract.</p><p> </p><p>Tom sighed. “I liked your wings.” He said sadly.</p><p> </p><p>Harry snorted. “I like them, too, but they'll only get in the way right now. I’m sure they'll come back when I want them to. I’m going to call Rinkle again and find out where we can get some food. I’m starving, aren't you?” He asked.</p><p> </p><p>Tom nodded. “Yes, but I’m always hungry.” He said.</p><p> </p><p>Harry smiled sadly. He knew that feeling. “Well, from now on, you eat whenever you’re hungry and eat until you’re full. We need to get your weight up to normal for a boy your age. You're a little small.”</p><p> </p><p>Tom frowned. “I’m small because I’m six, Mister Harry.” He pointed out.</p><p> </p><p>Harry shook his head. “You're small because you don’t get fed enough; I was the same way. Let’s find out where we can eat. Rinkle?”</p><p> </p><p>The elf popped in, and, having heard their conversation, led the way to the dining room.</p><p> </p><p>It was a long walk.</p>
