    <p>Toxic: A Dramione Fic</p>
<p>He wished that she would hurry up.</p>
<p>	After all, hiding out in the restricted section late at night had been her idea.</p>
<p>	Draco never would’ve guessed that the little Gryffindor had such a wild side. Part of him dreaded anyone finding out about the two of them; it would mean ruin on all sides.</p>
<p>	But the risk was all part of the enjoyment of it all.</p>
<p>	He was standing at the back of the room, concealed by a spell, reaching into his pocket and rubbing his wand out of habit. Impatience flared in his chest when he heard the library door creak open.</p>
<p>	Heat coiled in his stomach, and he forced himself to stay still. Even after all of this time, his pride demanded that she come to him. </p>
<p>	Hermione slipped into the room, her footsteps silent, dressed in a cloak that blended in with the night’s shadows. She raised her head and lowered her hood, her eyes searching for his in the dark.</p>
<p>	Draco flicked his wand, and the spell dissipated.</p>
<p>	“I feel like you love making me wait,” He murmured, reaching for her.</p>
<p>	“I can’t hear you around the silver spoon you love to suck on,” She quipped in reply, and he laughed, throaty and husky.</p>
<p>	“I’d like you to suck something,” Draco purred, pulling her against him.</p>
<p>	She laughed, and the sound lit him up. He wasn’t sure when these illicit, low-key trysts had begun, but he was addicted to her. It was a violation of everything he’d ever been taught.</p>
<p>	But the sex was so fucking good, he’d stopped caring long ago.</p>
<p>	“I’m the one who called you here,” Hermione reminded him, her voice so soft he had to lean in to hear her. “I’m stressed. Exams.”</p>
<p>	“You’re telling me that you pulled yourself away from studying to fuck me stupid?”</p>
<p>	Without letting her answer, he pulled her close and kissed her, slow and gentle at first, then hungry and deep.</p>
<p>	Hermione cried out under the pressure of his lips, and he moaned, running his fingers against her scalp, smiling when she clawed at his clothes, running her fingers over his stomach.</p>
<p>	He wanted to say that he missed her, but he didn’t want to break the spell.</p>
<p>	Her fingers on his skin made his mind go blank; he loved the way that the world disappeared when she was in his arms. Draco found himself thankful that Quidditch kept him lean and strong. Fuck it all, he wanted to impress her.</p>
<p>	Hermione tugged at his pants, growling, and he chuckled under his breath, unzipping his pants and stripping them off quickly.</p>
<p>He was gratified to discover that she had missed him too; they had a deeper connection that went beyond conversation.</p>
<p>Hermione cupped his ass and squeezed, and he shuddered, moving her shirt up so he could touch her breasts. He took one in his hand and ran a thumb over her nipple, smirking when he felt her twist against him.</p>
<p>“Do you like that, Granger?”  He whispered in her ear, and she nodded, cheeks flushing. Her lips were parted, and she was panting hard.</p>
<p>Draco wrapped a hand around her neck, with just enough pressure to make her gasp; he wouldn’t hurt her; he didn’t even know if he could do that, even if she’d ask.<br/>
“Draco,” She sighed, and the noise made his dick stand straight up.<br/>
“What is it?” He whispered in reply, knowing what she wanted but wanting to hear the words.<br/>
“I want you inside of me, Malfoy.”<br/>
**<br/>
After their fuck session, Draco lay on the floor, with her flush against him, holding him tightly. Her waves spilled across his chest, and he pulled her cloak over them both.<br/>
Neither of them would dare stay the night here, but it had become habit to snuggle after everything.</p>
<p>Try as they might to pretend that this was just physical, that wasn’t the truth.</p>
<p>Despite their differences, they cared about each other: they’d both talked about how different their lives would been, if the Sorting Hat had put her in Slytherin. Hermione had ambition seeping out of her very pores.<br/>
At times, Draco had been obsessively, insanely jealous of the Weasley boy. He had Harry Potter as his best friend, and who rounded out their group was one of the most beautiful women he’d ever seen.<br/>
Even now, he wondered if it had been the first time, he saw her, that he’d fallen for her. He was good at fronting at school, but at home, he was a pale imitation of what he projected at Hogwarts.</p>
<p>He found solace with her.</p>
<p>“I have to go soon,” Hermione murmured, and he shivered as her breath ghosted over his skin.<br/>
“I know,” He replied, stroking her hair, sighing.<br/>
“I really needed that, Draco. Thank you.”<br/>
“Thank you, darling,” He said, kissing her ear, smiling to himself.<br/>
As much as he wanted to be out in the open, he couldn’t help but treasure his time with her.<br/>
**</p>
<p>The week of exams was a blur of mad studying and sleepless nights, and it passed without them seeing each other.<br/>
Hermione was growing tired of such a long period between their rendezvous. Her grades were important to her, but Malfoy was one of the best forms of stress relief.<br/>
On the way out of Potions, she’d slipped a note into his cauldron. Now that exams were over, she’d have a little free time.<br/>
A rush of warmth swooped through her at the thought, and she tried not to let it show on her face.<br/>
How had things ended up this way? Of all people to sleep with, her most hated Slytherin. But apparently, hate and lust made strange bedfellows.<br/>
In the beginning, they both pretended that it was nothing more than boredom and hormones.<br/>
But they’d both caught feelings a few months in. It had taken them more than a year to admit it to one another.<br/>
It was a strange form of love, lust, and function. She’d often wondered what her like would have been like. If the Sorting Had had placed her in Slytherin, would she be the Head Girl? His better counterpart?<br/>
Of course, it hadn’t excused his disgusting views about people such as herself. She had well and truly hated him through the years. But he had began to change. She knew that it wasn’t her influence, but she was in so deep now that she just took him. All of his parts, the things she loved and the things she hated.<br/>
The promise of the late hours to themselves bolstered her through the day. She took a shower after she finished her homework, wishing that she could’ve taken a bath with Draco in the prefect’s bathroom.<br/>
Some days were so stressful that it was the only bright spot on her horizon.<br/>
Being the brightest witch of her age was far from easy. It was also exhausting.<br/>
**<br/>
That night, they met at midnight, tucked in a dark alcove close to the library. It made Hermione paranoid if it were closer to either one of their common rooms.<br/>
“Exams go okay?” Draco murmured as he pulled her close, nuzzling into her neck.<br/>
She shivered at his touch, at the ghost of his breath on her neck.<br/>
“Skip the small talk until after,” Hermione ordered, and he smirked.<br/>
He loved that they both had dominant personalities, always pushing against one another. Things were never boring; compared to every other sexual partner he’d ever had, male or female, she was perfect. Unforgettable.<br/>
“Very well, my queen,” Draco whispered, reaching inside the waistband of her skirt. Much to his surprise, she was wearing nothing underneath. He gasped, and was rewarded with a breathless, husky laugh.<br/>
“I’ve been thinking about this all week,” She whispered, and he smiled against her skin. It made him so happy, to know that he was constantly in her thoughts.<br/>
In that case, he had to do his best to make her come. She’d been waiting.<br/>
**</p>
<p>When Malfoy had her totally naked under her cloak, all rational thought disappeared. She didn’t feel the cold stone of the castle when he was touching her like this. He knelt before her, and before she could give him an order, he leaned in and took her breast in his mouth. He suckled her breasts, playing his tongue over the studs she’d pierced through her nipples.<br/>
She was such a surprise, so unapologetically herself. It was intoxicating.<br/>
Hermione Granger was fast becoming his favorite playmate, even if he couldn’t take her home to his traditionalist parents.<br/>
“Oh, Draco,” She purred, laying her hands over his, on her generous hips. “You don’t play fair.”<br/>
At these words, he pulled away, gray eyes burning silver in his lust.<br/>
He lowered his head, and her hands twisted in his clothing, holding him fast, as if she were afraid, he’d leave her. It was tempting to let her smolder, to make her beg.<br/>
But they’d both waited so long for this. It would be unkind.<br/>
His mind made up, he dipped his head lower and kissed the inside of her thighs.<br/>
She tasted delicious, like oranges and something sweet he couldn’t identify.<br/>
She groaned softly, and he wanted to reach up and cover her mouth, muffle the sound.<br/>
Tired of torture, he buried his face in her vagina and began to lick, an arm wrapped around her waist and the other hand lightly pinching her nipple. Oral was Hermione’s favorite, and he wanted to reward her for exams. She’d aced everything, he was sure of it. She grabbed his hand and sucked on his fingertips. He moaned; every single thing she did oozed sex appeal, and she didn’t even know it.<br/>
He ate her out happily, her sounds giving him a huge hard-on. He longed to bury himself in her, preferably in her sweet little ass. But he could wait. Her pleasure was always first.<br/>
“You’re fucking amazing, Malfoy, oh God,” She whimpered in a whisper, and he shuddered, feeling her clench, drinking her in. She tasted so good.<br/>
“I can’t wait to fuck you,” Draco moaned, and she ground against him, soaking wet against his face.<br/>
His tongue danced, and she gasped, her telltale sign that she was about to come.<br/>
“Yes, darling, come for me,” He whispered, licking her frantically.<br/>
At last, she gasped, throwing a hand over her mouth to quiet the sound.<br/>
She moaned his name and he drank her down, to every last drop.<br/>
**</p>
<p>They cuddled, lying down huddled in her cloak across the flagstones.<br/>
She laid her head against his chest, and he held her tight, smiling as he stroked her hair.<br/>
He could wait. He was just happy he’d relieved her stress.<br/>
“Exams just make me nervous, that’s all.”<br/>
**</p>
<p>Draco sneaked to the kitchens through the painting in the Hufflepuff corridor. (Curious about Ron’s brothers, the twins, he’d followed them once.) Hermione deserved some food, though she didn’t approve of the house elves.<br/>
Even at this time of night, the house elves were hard at work, and Draco was soon sent away with a tray of food. Madam Pomfrey would murder him, but it was late, and his lady needed nourishment before she gave him what he waited weeks for. He might have been an asshole.<br/>
But for her, he was a consummate gentleman.<br/>
When he came back, wishing not for the first time that he could Apparate within the castle, he found Hermione curled under her cloak, still naked, in the fetal position, brows furrowed even in sleep.<br/>
Draco found he didn’t have the heart to wake her; she looked so peaceful. And he could always finish himself later. His needs were not important. In the beginning, they had been.<br/>
She had been such a thrill for him. A pureblood with him, sleeping with a Mud—A Muggleborn.<br/>
Even in his head, that word felt wrong. Dirty.<br/>
He’d been wrong. The way his family and their ilk lived—removed, prejudiced, longing for ‘the good old days’—was but a pipe dream.<br/>
But then he’d found himself feeling for her. Truly loving her. He’d never felt like that about anyone else. She’d changed him, for the better.<br/>
But the pressures placed on him by his family and society prevented them from truly being together.<br/>
It just wasn’t fair.</p>
