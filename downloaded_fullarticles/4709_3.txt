    <p>Percy had dreamed of this for his whole life and now it was finally time for his chance. His chance to pass The Process. His chance for a better life for him and his children. His chance to get to The Offshore.</p><p>He had worked towards this goal for as long as he could remember. It was the only thing that kept him going here, in the slums of the inland. The proverbial light in the darkness.</p><p>Percy wanted nothing more in life than to get out of the slums, to prove himself worthy, to be a part of the 3%.</p><p>Neither of his parents had made it. His older brothers, Bill and Charlie, hadn’t either, but that would simply make his success more impressive.</p><p>Bill had been eliminated fairly early in the process. Based on what he said he only passed the first two tests, but no matter how long Percy begged, the oldest Weasley would never tell what those two tests had been. He refused to budge and Percy couldn’t figure out what he would need to do the same way and what he should do differently. He couldn't figure out why his usually so helpful brother refused to give him as much as a single tip for the thing Percy desired more than anything else.</p><p>Charlie had lasted longer than Bill had. He had almost made it to the end of the Process, but he had given up when he had been offered money to head home instead of continuing. While the money had helped their family a lot, this was not something Percy would do. He was prepared for it and he knew he wouldn’t budge.</p><p>Percy had informed his family of that as well, the very second he had seen a grinning Charlie arrive at home with his parents, carrying a whole bunch of money.</p><p>Not with him. Percy was determined to pass. The Offshore was a world without injustice, after all, and who wouldn’t want to be a part of something as fascinating and honorable as that?</p><p>He would not be eliminated. He knew that he had the merit he needed to do that. He knew he was worthy of The Offshore. He was one of the 3%.</p><p>Consequently, Percy was full of confidence when he woke up on the day when his Process would finally take place.</p><p>His mother hugged him as soon as she spotted him. “I believe in you, Percy. You’re so smart. I know that you can do this.”</p><p>“Don’t worry if you are eliminated,” his father said, knocking him on the shoulder. “Don’t get me wrong, Percy, I do <em> not </em>think that will be the case at all. I just need you to know that if there is one test that you cannot handle, no one will think any less of you.”</p><p>His father was wrong.</p><p>He would most certainly think less of himself. That was something he point blank refused to let happen.</p><p>The twins cheered on him when he came to say goodbye—<em> forever</em>, as did Ron.</p><p>Ginny gave him a stone she had found.</p><p>“It’s amber,” she stated with total conviction. “It gives luck, clears the mind, and eliminates fears. I thought you could need something like this.”</p><p>Percy was not one to believe in such hogwash, but he appreciated the gesture nevertheless. The stone looked authentic, it must’ve taken his little sister a lot of time, effort, and quite possibly money to get a hold of this.</p><p>His older brothers didn’t seem like they wanted to let go of him. Charlie in particular.</p><p>“Listen, Percy,” he paused, clearly trying to think of a good way to phrase whatever it was that he wanted to say. “The Process is nothing to be taken lightly. You’re going to see...things there. You’re not weak if you’re eliminated.”</p><p>Percy looked down into his older brother’s eyes. “I won’t be eliminated. I am going to live Offshore in a few days. And now, let me leave. I don't want to be late.”</p>
