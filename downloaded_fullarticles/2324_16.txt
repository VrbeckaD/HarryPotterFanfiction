          <div class="userstuff"><p>Remus took in a shaky breath and let it out again, his body folding in on itself. He stood against the wall of an old brick building in Diagon Alley, hunched over now, trying to keep himself together among the bustle of the witches and wizards that were doing their shopping. His shoulders quaked with the force of his silent sobs. The alleyway he was hiding in was filthy and small but that was the best he could find in the sudden moment that his mind got the better of him. </p><p><i>They're all gone.</i> His mind hissed at him, his own voice but cold and emotionless. </p><p>He knew that, though. They had been gone for two weeks now. He should be understanding, he should be forcing himself to move on.</p><p><i>They're all gone and it's all your fault.</i> The voice in his head was angry, still cold. Still… emotionless? But Remus could hear the anger. </p><p>No. No, it wasn't his fault. It was Sirius. It was Sirius that had been the traitor; Sirius who he loved with all his heart, Sirius who had accepted him for what he was, Sirius with his bold personality and big heart. No, it couldn't have been. But it had been.</p><p><i>They're all gone and you are alone.</i> The voice hissed, it was so accusing, so angry. </p><p>He broke down. He fell to his knees, and a broken sob burst from him as if he were going to vomit. His whole body shook, he felt helpless.</p><p>
  <i>Alone.</i>
</p><p>------</p><p>Another week had passed. Three weeks since they all… left. Since what happened happened. </p><p>Remus hadn't risked another outing since the week before. Not anywhere relating to wizards, at least. He had visited the store to pick up food once when he ran so low the only thing in his cupboard was a half used bag of flour. But he was running low again, on food and funds to buy it with. </p><p>When the war was raging, he had a purpose, yes. But most importantly, he had a job. That job gave him a small income that Dumbledore could spare. That small income gave him a way to buy some food. </p><p>Remus' stomach growled, low and demanding, and he had been ignoring it for so long that it hurt. He forced himself up out of his ancient armchair and wandered the trash strewn floor carefully. He hadn't bothered to clean up anything, didn't see the point really. It wasn't as if any friends were to come and visit. </p><p><i>They're all gone and it's all your fault.</i> The voice in his mind hissed.</p><p>No. No, not his fault. </p><p>He stopped walking, reached a hand out to lean against the kitchen table, and closed his eyes tightly. </p><p>No, not his fault.</p><p>Inhale. Exhale. </p><p>Inhale… Exhale…</p><p>He opened his eyes, glancing around the kitchen. What was the point of this? </p><p>Remus swallowed hard, his breathing slowly returning to normal, slowly calming. He couldn't live this way anymore. He was nearly out of money and he knew he would never be able to get another job. He could be a soldier. He was useful as a body in a war. But anything else? That's where being a Dark Creature usually got him into trouble. </p><p>He bit his lip, his mind wandered suddenly. And in a flash of realization, he knew where he could go. He knew what he could do.</p><p><i>What?</i> The voice in his mind screeched suddenly.That angry, vicious doubt that flooded his blood like ice. <i>You don't belong there! You don't!</i></p><p>No. But he did, though. But that was the one place that he knew could help. Right?</p><p>Inhale. Exhale. </p><p>Remus turned abruptly and took his tattered coat off the back of the single kitchen table chair. He left his flat, slamming the door behind him so hard in his haste, that he heard a picture frame fall and shatter. But he didn't look back, didn't go back to pick it up. He just left. </p><p>He made it a fair ways out of the tiny town he had been living in, far enough away from muggle eyes, that he could apparate. </p><p>The dingy cobblestone street vanished from under his feet when he opened his eyes. It was replaced by a leaf strewn forest floor. He wasn't exactly sure where the right spot was, but he knew that if he wandered enough, he would be found.</p><p>He always had been in the past. </p><p>------</p><p>Remus had been walking for what seemed like hours. He only had to stop once to fight the voice in his head that whispered blame and anger. He was reaching a point where he wanted to quit, wanted to turn back and go back to his shabby little flat in that silent little town. </p><p>"Pup." The voice cracked the silence of the forest like a whip. </p><p>Remus felt a shudder run up his spine at the sound, he instantly felt himself begin to shut down but he shook the feeling. He glanced around the area, noting the trees, the rocks, the fallen branches. There were no animals around that he could see or hear, not even the tweet of a bird or the scrambling of a squirrel against crisp leaves. That should have clued him in but he had been lost in his thoughts. </p><p>"What are <i>you</i> doing in <i>my</i> territory?" </p><p>He looked around until he noticed.</p><p>Fenrir Greyback. </p><p>Just thinking the name. Just seeing that face, that cold blind eye, caused another shudder of disgust to run though him. </p><p>"I…" Remus' voice cracked, he could barely recognize it as his own voice. He had gone all those weeks, barely speaking a word to anyone. Since no one cared to speak to him in the first place after they all… left. </p><p>"Speak." Fenrir barked. He moved from behind a thick oak tree and moved to stand before the younger man. He stood a head taller than Remus, and definitely out weighed him too. Fenrir was built so powerfully, all muscle. All angles. There was no softness to him. There never could be any with this man. That blind eye that was cut by old ragged scars, the neatly trimmed facial hair that always seemed to be perfect, the long dark hair that was lightly streaked in greys that was pulled back in a low ponytail. The dirt and grime and muck and <i>blood</i> that seemed to stain tanned flesh. </p><p>"I… I need to join you." Remus said in a rush, in a breathless gasp. "I can't live anymore. Can't live with wizards anymore. I can't do it anymore. They're all gone and I'm-"</p><p><i>Alone.</i> </p><p>Fenrir studied him, the working eye moving up and down his body as though evaluating his every pore. Finally, the eye stopped and met Remus' own. </p><p>"Join us? Oh, Little One, you have already cast aside your gifts. Why join now?"</p><p>"I… I don't have anything else, Fenrir." Remus took a step closer to the other man.</p><p>Fenrir stood taller, arms moving to cross over his chest. Remus was bold, though it was likely out of fear of the unknown. Fenrir knew, better than any, how the wolf within would call for a pack. </p><p>And Remus' little make believe pack has been disbanded. </p><p>The elder man cocked his head to the side. He smiled, the action hauntingly caused blood-stained fangs to glisten in the light of the rising moon. "You need a home."</p><p>"Yes." Remus gasped.</p><p>"You've come crawling back to me because you need safety."</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"You felt the call and now… you need a pack."</p><p>"Yes…" </p><p>"And why should I? Why should I bother bring you to my pack after you prove," He snarled, moving closer, baring his fangs threateningly, "time and time again that you would sell out your own kind for those wizards?"</p><p>"They're gone." Remus said, his tone was lifeless, empty. </p><p>"Gone?"</p><p>"Gone. They… dead. Or… left." </p><p>"And so, that's why you need a home. Because yours died." </p><p>"Yes."</p><p>
  <i>Alone.</i>
</p><p>Fenrir released a deep rumbling purr from within his chest. A pleased noise. A content noise. </p><p>"Very well. Come, Remus. Let's go home."</p></div>
