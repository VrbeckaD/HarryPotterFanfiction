    <p>“Mate, I think we did it. This is as good as it gets!”<br/><br/>“I don't know James, I feel like something's missing... Frank, play that last arrangement for me again?”<br/><br/>“Sirius, you know I love you and I love producing your music, but I've hit the mixer's buttons so many times I think my fingers are getting swollen,” replied Frank Longbottom while pressing his right index and thumb together to make a point. “I also feel like my ears are about to fall off, no offense against your sound of course.”<br/><br/>"Alright, call it a day and go home if that's what you wanna do, I'll do it myself," said Sirius, his usual posh accent coming out very rushed.<br/><br/>James groaned. “Sirius, stop. You're going to pull an all-nighter again just to make changes we won't even notice! Or even worse, mess the whole thing! Enough!” He threw his hands in the air. “Let's get back home, relax, eat something and finally sleep. God knows you—no, <em>we—</em>need it.”<br/><br/>Sirius hovered frantically over the mixing board, pushing Frank aside, who let his rolling chair get him out of the way. “What we need is an ace album, a perfect one. And we are so close, I can feel it, like—like a dizzy feeling, you know what I mean?”<br/><br/>“Yes, it's the dizziness caused by lack of food and sleep in your body,” replied James knowingly while readjusting his glasses. “You're getting all worked up and you know that's bad mate, it just is. Tomorrow is a new day though. We'll come back, and then you'll make all the tiniest changes you want, or should I say, make Frank make them.” He sent a sorry look in the general direction of their overworked producer.<br/><br/>“In any case, we're out of here,” said Fabian, one of the red head twins and bassist of their band, who had both been uncharacteristically quiet since the last hour or so. “I think my dearest brother has been sleeping on his feet like a horse for the past thirty minutes. You know, like when they do that knee-locking thing.”<br/><br/>They all turned to look at Gideon in unison, except for Sirius, who seemed like he hadn't even heard Fabian's voice.<br/><br/>Undoubtedly, the band's drummer seemed to be fast asleep while leaning against the back wall of their recording studio, arms and legs crossed.<br/><br/>“That is an impressive skill,” said Frank, a tired smile tugging at his lips.<br/><br/>Sirius felt like he was about to ooze adrenaline through his skin, like the last few steps before a touch down back when he and James played rugby in boarding school, or like the precious and nerve shattering seconds before going on stage for a performance. He felt like just when he was about to have a breakthrough, something—or better yet, someones—were pulling him back, holding him, keeping him from running forward, their voices as frustrating as the rumbling sound of bees around his head.<br/><br/>No, this wouldn't do.<br/><br/>“I can't go home now, James. I can't. We're on the verge of something here—“<br/><br/>“We're not making the fucking Mona Lisa!” James cut in, “Do I really have to bring you back by carrying you like when we were twelve and you didn't want to leave boarding school for the holidays?”<br/><br/>Sirius whipped his head around, gasping. “Now that's a low blow!” His eyes were wide. “And in any case, that would be dangerous, since you're even more blind now than you were back then, though I still wonder how that's even possible.”<br/><br/>He faced James straight on. <em>Well, at least that got his attention</em>, he thought. As weird as it sounded, his best friend's ire was always a better option than his manic and obsessive-like state of mind.<br/><br/>“And I still wonder how I've yet to punch you in the face for being a fucking crazy perfectionist who cannot take no for an answer!” James replied, hoping Sirius would take the bait.<br/><br/>The darkening look on his face was a good indicator that he would.<br/><br/>“You... I know what you're trying to do,” Sirius slowly stepped towards his best friend, finally leaving the mixing board behind him. “I've known you for sixteen bloody years, Potter... you think I wouldn't see right through your schemes?”<br/><br/>“Do you even hear yourself? I'm saying we need food and sleep to function, and you're calling that schemes.” James scoffed, while Fabian shook his head and went to wake up his brother, leaving his two crazy bandmates at their antics. Frank slowly stood up from the chair he was sitting on, hoping his slow movements wouldn't attract any attention to him so that he could plan his escape from the recording studio.<br/><br/>“Yes, you're trying to control me, I see it in your squinty eyes, you bastard. It's not going to work, I'm telling you,” Sirius pointed his forefinger threateningly, his face almost nose to nose with his messy haired brother by everything but blood. From this short distance, he could see James's brown eyes moving rapidly from left to right on their own accord, a medical condition he's had since he was born.<br/><br/>He also just noticed the very dark and very deep circles under his eyes, which he hadn't realised were there before. Sirius, against his own will, felt himself falter.<br/><br/>He caught movement over James's right shoulder, and saw that Fabian was about to open the door to leave the studio, and if the creaking sound he heard behind him was of any indication, Frank was trying to leave too. Gideon was yawning and stretching his arms over his head as he followed Fabian's lead to the door.<br/><br/><em>Traitors</em>, thought Sirius without malice. He suddenly and inexplicably felt calmer, like the ocean's huge tidal waves he had in his head had turned into a gently rippling lake. He realized James had his hand on his shoulder, gently squeezing, though he couldn't remember when he had gripped him in the first place. He let out a deep breath. He could feel the tiredness prickling behind his eyes.<br/><br/>“Now, that's better. Let's get home, yeah?” said James, leading Sirius towards the door.<br/><br/>“Oh, look who we have here!” Fabian opened the studio's door wider, revealing a hidden figure. “Care to finally join the madness?”<br/><br/>Peter Pettigrew, their band's manager, looked at everyone in the room one after the other, twitching slightly.<br/><br/>“Is that Peter?” asked James to no one in particular, the door too far away for him to see clearly. He didn't wait for an answer. “How long have you been hiding behind that door?!”<br/><br/>In a small voice Peter replied, “I just... I-I came here to see if you guys would take a break, we've got a show coming in three days in Brighton.”<br/><br/>“Yes, we know, although our grandiose music prodigy Mr Sirius Orion Black the III here doesn't seem to care about that tonight. Which reminds me, why didn't you help by doing your job and putting a stop to his sleep strike?” asked James, not unkindly.<br/><br/>“James, you know very well you'll always be better than me at making Sirius do things that he doesn't want to do,” replied Peter with a smile.<br/><br/>“You two stop talking like I'm not here, it's unbearable,” said Sirius, his voice finally in synch with how suddenly tired he felt.<br/><br/>“Alright alright, give me your arm so we can finally get out of here, I can't see a damn thing at this hour,” James told Sirius.<br/><br/>“Why don't you bring your bloody cane with you, huh? I'm no human stick.” Sirius nonetheless offered his right arm to his best friend.<br/><br/>“But you're a cuddler, I bet you love it. And you know I hate that thing, more than I hate you at least,” smirked James.<br/><br/>“Sod off, Potter. I know I'm your favorite.”<br/><br/>“Yeah yeah, keep telling yourself that...”<br/><br/>“I swear you two are like an old married couple, linked arms and all. No wonder so many of our fans think you're together.” Fabian lead the group outside to the exit of the building. “You saw any crazies out there when you came in earlier?” he asked Peter.<br/><br/>“Didn't notice anything unusual, no. But I'm no bodyguard.” Peter sounded a little breathless, his shorter legs trying to keep up with the group. “Speaking of which, with our popularity rising, and the recent horrible lawsuit against Sirius, I think it's time we get that. Bodyguards, I mean. Or just general security... I might know someone who knows someone, and we could–“<br/><br/>“Can we talk about this tomorrow? If you don't mind,” James walked steadily beside Sirius. “It's just, I'm knackered and all I hear is babbling, no offense.”<br/><br/>“Are you saying your ears are getting as bad as your eyes now, Potter?” teased his best friend.<br/><br/>“Not as bad as your sense of humour, Black!”<br/><br/>The banter continued until they parted ways under the full moon outside, the air crisp in this late February weather. Fabian and Gideon headed one way, Peter another, and Frank took his car to join his wife at home, who was probably wondering when he would be back, as usual.<br/><br/>Sirius walked to his motorcycle with James after saying their goodbyes. They took off to their apartment, Sirius's long black hair flowing in the wind under his helmet and occasionally hitting James's face, which usually irritated the messy haired man. This time though, he was too tired to bother, feeling his mind drift under the rumbling sound of the engine he was sitting on, leaning on Sirius's back for support.<br/><br/>“And they say I'm the cuddling one,” said Sirius under his breath, smiling. Sounds from their album in progress were still whirling in his head, but he felt more like a casual observer than a participant trying to keep up with his thoughts. Yes, tomorrow would be a new day, bringing changes. Sirius just didn't know how right this statement was.</p><p>Yet.</p>
