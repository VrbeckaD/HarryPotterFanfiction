    <p>Hermione Granger was <em>bored</em>.</p><p> </p><p>She had a boring life, a boring job, and a boring cat. Don't get her wrong, she loved the orange furball she called Crookshanks. She absolutely adored him, but he was so <em>boring</em>. He slept constantly, only waking to eat and do his kitty business. The only time he acknowledged her was when she got home from work and when she had food in her hands.</p><p> </p><p>She worked in an office. Her best friend owned the small business, and she luckily was able to work there. She did the same things everyday. From 9-5 she sat behind a bland desk, signing papers and typing religiously.</p><p> </p><p>She came home everyday to an empty flat. Her cat seated in the window seal next to her succulents, soaking in the London sun. It was always the same routine.</p><p> </p><p>Go to work. Have lunch with Harry. Come home. Shower. Go out for dinner. Read and get ready for bed. Sleep, then repeat.</p><p> </p><p>The most fun she ever had was the weekends when she went to the cinema with her mom, or the odd days when she'd hang out with her friends.</p><p> </p><p>It was the sad realization that her life was shit that led her to this moment; Social Media.</p><p> </p><p>She was never a fan of these things. Nothing about her life was interesting enough to post for others to see.</p><p> </p><p>But somehow, her friend Ginny had convinced her this was a great idea. She promised to assist her, too afraid that Hermione would only embarrass herself. This led to a mini argument because Hermione was not that dumb!</p><p> </p><p>“Okay, Instagram it is!” The redheaded girl excitedly plopped down beside her. The force causing her bed to squeak.</p><p> </p><p>“Not the one where I have to post pictures, Ginny, please!”</p><p> </p><p>Her plea went ignored.</p><p> </p><p>Seconds later Hermione was being tugged around as her friend forced her to pose. She even insisted that she put on her most revealing dress. It was a black strapless dress that hugged her body tight. It ended right below her ass; if she bent over her enter bottom would be on display.</p><p> </p><p>The dress was a gift and had never been worn. It was stuck in the very back of her closet and had almost been forgotten.</p><p> </p><p>“Ginny! I look like a hooker!” She tried desperately to pull the dress down enough to feel a little appropriate. It worked slightly.</p><p> </p><p>“Come on! You look hot.”</p><p> </p><p>Deciding it was pointless to protest, she gave up and agreed. An hour and a half later, Ginny had been satisfied enough to leave. Thankfully, she agreed to allow Hermione the choice of which photos to post and which to save 'for later’.</p><p> </p><p>After debating for 20 minutes, she decided to post a simple picture of her laying in bed, completely covered by the way, with Crookshanks on her chest. The picture was silly, but one of her favorites.</p><p> </p><p>Her hair looked a mess, a few stray curls lay beautifully around her face and pillow. Her lips were swollen from where she had been pressed against her pillow most of the night. Her smile was simple, just a little grin that showed no teeth. She looked like she had just woken up, which she had, but it was natural.</p><p> </p><p>Satisfied with her first post, she showered and headed to bed.</p><p> </p><p>—</p><p> </p><p>The next morning, Hermione awoke to notifications from the new app. Curious, she opened and saw that she had gotten a few likes and comments during the night. All from her friends, of course.</p><p> </p><p>Ginny had taken it upon herself to follow who she wanted. Most she knew and some she didn't.</p><p> </p><p>Ginny, Harry, Ron, and Luna had all commented similar things. She looked beautiful, pretty, etc. Luna was the only one who commented on how cozy Crookshanks looked laying on his mummy.</p><p> </p><p>The time on her phone caused her to forget about her newly discovered hobby. If she didn't hurry she'd be late.</p><p> </p><p>Work went as usual. Lunch with Harry had been different, he was only able to stay a few moment before he was called away to review an important file. This left Hermione alone for the remaining hour.</p><p> </p><p>Five minutes after Harry had gone, she found herself full and bored. She could go back to her office, but in a last minute decision she pulled her phone from her purse and opened Instagram.</p><p> </p><p>She scrolled through her friends post for a bit to see what kind of content was suitable to post. She picked another photo of herself, one that showed her playing the piano at her parents home on Christmas. She smiled at the memory that flooded her mind as she stared at the photo.</p><p> </p><p>Within seconds, she had gotten likes. She was surprised at how fast people had reacted.</p><p> </p><p>She remembered something Ginny had told her, "If you want to follow more people, just go through some of mine and follow who you like.”</p><p> </p><p>Deciding to take the girls advice, Hermione navigated her way to Ginny's account. She rolled her eyes at her friends username: <b>ginny_bestweasley</b>.</p><p> </p><p>Hermione was thankful she had decided on a normal one: <b>hermionejgranger</b>.</p><p> </p><p>She followed a few people she recognized from school. A few followed back immediately, and Hermione found herself smiling at the gaining followers and likes.</p><p> </p><p>In no time, she was forced to head back to work. Time had flown by exceedingly quick when her focus was on her phone. She liked it.</p><p> </p><p>—</p><p> </p><p>That night when she arrived home she went straight to her phone. She opened the app excitedly and was not disappointed at her notifications.</p><p> </p><p><b>15 new followers. 20+ likes and comments</b>.</p><p> </p><p>She decided it was appropriate to post another picture, but hesitated when she stumbled upon a video of her smiling and laughing as Ron stood next to her. She was stumbling lightly. The video was from her 21st birthday party, and she was already a tiny bit tipsy.</p><p> </p><p>Her hair was put up into a small braided crown that wrapped beautifully around her head. A few curls were left down around her ears, and she had to admit she looked good.</p><p> </p><p>Ron had his arm wrapped protectively around her as she swayed gently to the music. It was a good memory.</p><p> </p><p>She decided to be brave and post it.</p><p> </p><p>Throwing her phone aside, she headed into the bathroom to shower. Friday's were normally the nights where she lit candles, added way too many bubbles, and soaked in her garden tub for an hour. This always involved her favorite bottle of wine.</p><p> </p><p>The only difference between this time and all the other times was her phone she had abandoned on her couch. She decided to take it with her.</p><p> </p><p>A few drinks later, and she was feeling great. The candles against the tub glowed angelically, and Hermione just had to get a picture. She took a very appropriate picture of her wine, bubbles and candles and posted it to her Instagram. The caption was simple:<b> I love Friday's. Bubble baths, wine and candles = perfect night ;)</b></p><p> </p><p>She found herself scrolling through multiple friends followings and followed a few more people. Ginny, Luna, and Hanna were all following a certain boy. His profile looked professional, and Hermione guessed by his following to follow ratio that he was somehow famous.</p><p> </p><p>She looked through a few of his photos, which looks mostly professional, and her fingers hovered over the follow button.</p><p> </p><p>Blame it on the wine, or the fact she found the fellow man undeniable attractive, she pressed down and turned the little blue button white.</p><p> </p><p>It was definitely the wine that made her go through and like all of the mans photos. And by all, she meant it. All 136 photos.</p><p> </p><p>It didn't take her long to become tired. The wine mixed with her long day at work resulted in her flopping down onto her bed face first. By the time she counted to three she was out.</p><p> </p><p>—</p><p> </p><p>The next morning came way too early. She was woken by the sound of her cat meowing in her ears.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh Crooks,” she mumbled. Her head was pounding and her throat was beyond dry.</p><p> </p><p>She rolled over and barely made it out of bed before she noted the blinking of her phone. She glanced at it half-heartedly and dragged her way to the kitchen. She lazily poured the right amount of food, and pressed the 'brew coffee' button.</p><p> </p><p>She flopped down in her seat and waited for the alarm.</p><p> </p><p>Munching on a biscuit as she waited, she felt her eyelids drooping. She should really go back to bed.  </p><p> </p><p>She fixed her coffee and began to sip when she unlocked her phone. Coffee flew from her mouth as she read the notifications.</p><p> </p><p><b>thedracomalfoy </b>followed her back!</p><p> </p><p>It took her a second to recall who exactly this was, but she immediately remembered and felt her face heat up. She slammed her phone onto the table, the screen facing down.</p><p> </p><p>She was so embarrassed.</p><p> </p><p>Breathing deeply, she convinced herself to calm down. It wasn't like this boy knew her, or that she'd ever see him in real life. He was just a face on a screen.</p><p> </p><p>Swallowing a few sips of too hot coffee, she looked again.</p><p> </p><p>Not only had he followed her back, but he had liked her few photos and even dm'd her. She felt herself getting dizzy.</p><p> </p><p>This beautiful man had acknowledged her!? A man who had millions of followers, who probably got millions of likes, comments, and dms daily had noticed her. She barely had 100 followers.</p><p> </p><p>
  <b>thedracomalfoy: thanks for liking all my photos xx</b>
</p><p> </p><p>She wanted to scream. There was no way this was happening to her. Was she supposed to reply? She knew he could see that she had opened his message, but what would she say.</p><p> </p><p>You're welcome? No that was stupid.</p><p> </p><p>
  <b>hermionejgranger: honestly, that's what happens when you stumble upon an attractive guy after too many glasses of wine xx</b>
</p><p> </p><p>His reply was almost instant.</p><p> </p><p>
  <b>thedracomalfoy: so you're saying I'm attractive?</b>
</p><p> </p><p>Her face heated up again as she let out a nervous laugh. Was he flirting with her?</p><p> </p><p>She shook her head at the thought. Of course not.</p><p> </p><p>
  <b>hermionejgranger: yes. my mother taught me it wasn't nice to lie. I'm sure you've been told by many people just how attractive you are. </b>
</p><p> </p><p>Was her reply.</p><p> </p><p>It took a little longer this time, and she found herself glancing at her phone as she finished her breakfast.</p><p> </p><p>As soon as her phone dinged she grabbed it.</p><p> </p><p>
  <b>thedracomalfoy: sure</b>
</p><p> </p><p>Was the first reply.</p><p> </p><p>
  <b>thedracomalfoy: but normally they're not as beautiful as you xx</b>
