  <span>“Depulso..” Harry hollered as cast at a stump that threw up out into the air and landed cast out on its side.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Aren’t you on a stakeout? Doesn’t that require you to be Surreptitious?” Draco asked squatting on the grass expertly. So, his robes or arse didn’t touch the ground.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry stared at the blonde. “I’ve been here for four hours....” he replied glumly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I take it you won’t be home for dinner?” Draco questioned. “I love fieldwork. I’m Harry Potter. I’m good at everything!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry smirked. “Is that your impression of me?” He said suppressing his grin. “And I do like field work...”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know your well known for your impulsiveness. I have been on the receiving end of some it...” Draco pointed out and pulling out a thermos from his coat.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I forgave you” Harry said stealing a kiss as he let Draco pour him a cup of tea.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Robards will kill me if he finds out the here you know...” Harry said sipping. His eyes glancing down at the horizon.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Boyfriend privileges” Draco replied. “I am also an expert in the dark arts.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry rolled his eyes. “So am I, I’ve been on the receiving end of more curses than you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You might receive them. At least I can understand them.” Draco replied rolling his eyes. “So?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So?” Harry said unsure.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Who are you staking out?” Draco said simply.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Carson Tartanellius” Harry explained. “He’s working out a muggle health clinic. People are disappearing and there are reports he’s draining them of blood.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco burst out laughing. “A vampire? Potter be serious...”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I didn’t say he was a vampire. I just said he a draining them of blood. Maybe he’s just into using leeches.” Harry suggested.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco rolled his eyes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry grinned and playfully bared his teeth, “I vant to suck your blood....” Harry said putting on a rather rubbish Transylvanian accent as he sucked in Draco’s neck. Planning to leave a nice hickey.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is that muggle thing?” Draco said wearily.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Count Dracula? You know....” Harry said surprised.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco looked at him blankly. “Is that one of your fairy tales?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry grinned. “No, it isn’t...” he said patting his lap. “Stop squatting and sit here...”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll get dirt on my robes...” Draco soured.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You can wash them later...” Harry insisted. As Draco sat down in his lap, Harry pressed his arms around Draco. “I’m waiting to see if he leaves before sunset.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are going to end up in St-Mungos again? Or worse I’ll have to mount a rescue” Draco replied.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No. I’ll be fine” Harry reassured. “I promise.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You say that like I should believe you” Draco said honestly. “What happens when we start having children?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll have to do less night shifts” Harry replied without hesitating.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Harry. What if you go and don’t come back...” Draco said sounding guilty that he had to admit it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll always come back...” Harry said kissing Draco’s cheek. “I’m practically invincible.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco jabbed him in the ribs. “No, you’re not. That’s not true in the least. You are just very very lucky...”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry smiled and hugged Draco, watching the converted house at the bottom of the hill, that had been converted into a doctor’s clinic. “I am. Very lucky” Harry agreed. “I think this is the first time I’ve heard you talk about kids...”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Potter you mentioned wanting to have children about a month in. Along with your ideas for a wedding, I hardly wanted to encourage you” Draco said sternly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But you’re still here...” Harry pointed out.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I am. I am for my sins madly in love with you...” Draco sighed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ve thought about getting your named tattooed on me?” Harry admitted.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You will not!” Draco said sternly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not your name. Your constellation...” Harry explained.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh...” Draco said touched. “That sounds lovely.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You are the Stars in my sky” Harry continued.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t get sappy...” Draco said amused. “But I love you. I’d like a family with you...”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You pregnant. Sounds like trouble” Harry considered.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You can handle it” Draco said smirking. “However. I insist that we’re at least married first.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sounds reasonable...” Harry grinned. Then saw an older woman leave the doctors clinic. “Fuck. It’s time. Sorry Draco I’ll see you at home...” Harry said heaving Draco off him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco stood up and pulled out his wand. Cleaning up the cups of tea. “Lead the way.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No!” Harry warned.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Deal with it!” Draco replied walking to the stump and breaking off a root, and with a wave of his wand turning it into a stake.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I thought you said that the possibility that it was a vampire was ludicrous” Harry said frowning.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s you. It’s probably a vampire” Draco replied smirking.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fine! Don’t get bitten or hexed” Harry warned as his robes billowing as he tracked down the hill.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco smirked pulled his wand out with a flourish and followed him.</span>
</p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>Draco waited for exactly one minute before following Harry. He pushed open the door the waiting room was plain, boring muggle art work, uncomfortable muggle chairs and boring muggle magazines.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hnnnngh...” Harry groaned from further in the clinic. Draco held his wand out and followed the grunting. He followed the darkened corridor, Draco noticed the lack of windows. There was a door blasted off its hinges.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>On the other side Harry was on his back pushing a man in a lab coat, long brown hair fangs hanging over his lips. “Gerr off” Harry groaned struggling.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco smirked. “Told you so!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry shot him a helpless look. “Stake him!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Right!” Draco grinned and used his wand to impale the stake through the Vampire's back.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry groaned and shoved the Vampire's body off him. “Thanks.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You need backup” Draco smirked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Shut up” Harry sighed laying still.</span>
