    <p>Often, I look back and think of how so much could have changed if I hadn’t looked at the forest that day. What would have happened if I saw a bird swoop over the Black Lake to my left and glanced at that instead of the stray dog in the woods? What would have happened if I walked by a minute earlier, or even later? What would have happened if I had seen him and shrugged it off without a second thought? What would have happened if…</p><p>Well, it didn’t matter now.</p><p>I saw him and I chose my path. Life happened as it always did; I helped him and that really made all the difference, didn’t it?</p><p>***</p><p>I was not fond of rules, yet I was terribly afraid of getting in trouble. It was an ironic paradox that found me sneaking out for no good reason whilst also using the caution of a retired auror – and we’ve <em>all</em> heard the stories about retired aurors and caution. </p><p>I prided myself on the fact that I never got caught – not once and not by anyone– and that I remained of a solid moral standing in my own eyes. I often found myself sneaking out just to visit the house elves and bring them pebbles or other trinkets as gifts or to leave appreciation notes in random places to cheer people up; though I won’t lie and say it was from the goodness of my heart, but rather that my heart swelled with pride when I saw that someone benefited from something I did. It was actually a rather selfish pleasure to help others only for the sake of helping oneself.</p><p>But, I found it rather ironic that it was only the legendary troublemakers and tricksters who found themselves getting detentions for late night escapades. I don’t know if it was the ridiculous amount of paranoia I had whilst lurking around or that my motives for lurking didn’t offend the justice of the universe and said universe didn’t believe I needed punishing. Either way, my track record stayed clean and I remained the only Hufflepuff in all of Hogwarts history to be skilled in the art of stealth and thievery… I think.</p><p>Okay so <em> maybe</em> my trips were less than moral at times –just maybe, mind you –  but who can blame me for stealing already illegally obtained Butterbeer from the Slytherins. It was a pain in the arse to do it too so I was quite proud of myself afterwards.</p><p>So, when I saw a dog lurking by the forest in between classes and looking about as starved and pathetic as a dog could be, I thought to myself ‘now there’s a good reason to sneak out’. It looked bloody awful and I wagered it could keel over any moment if it didn’t eat immediately. Luckily for them/he/she/it (the <strong> dog</strong>) I was heading to lunch and had a free period afterwards. Not that I would stay the whole lunch, no! That dog needed food and it needed it now and damn any dementors or staff members that got in my way. If they didn’t like me wandering the grounds then I’d just have to bring the dog into the castle to appease them. </p><p>(Bloody wizards and their lack of regard for creatures that aren’t them. If I wasn’t one myself I’d think they were the ones in the Dark Ages they so like to paint the muggles in. So backwards and with superiority complexes larger than a mountain troll; of course there’s so many goblin rebellions and wars! Peace is a concept only made for those with humility and understa-</p><p>Right, rambling about the flaws of society isn’t going to feed the dog – or fix society. Quite disappointing, that.)</p><p>Anyways, my small group was already sat down by the time I arrived for lunch and Ernie Macmillan and Justin Finch-Fletchley were in an earnest debate on whether Zaccharias Smith’s actions of ignorance towards a certain muggle-born Gryffindor in Muggle Studies was warranting of a reprimand. As always, both were too forgiving in the matter. Based on what I heard, he didn’t deserve a talking to, he deserved a smack over the head. </p><p>(Or a detention. A detention’s probably better than violence. Yep, detention for Smith. Wonder if I could snitch on him to Pomona…) </p><p>Hannah and Susan were in the middle of an obviously – yet unintentionally – closed off conversation and I was stuck with the endearing company of one Wayne Hopkins.</p><p>I turned to my side and eyed him slyly (or what I thought was slyly) to see if he had noticed their obliviousness to our late arrivals. He caught my eye and I pointedly looked at the two pairs and smiled like a madman at them. I tried to mentally communicate something along the lines of ‘They didn’t even glance up when I sat down, the audacity! Oh, my wounded heart!’ but he just looked confused and slightly scared. </p><p>I laughed and turned to my food, eating quickly, whilst also sharing the standard pleasantries with Wayne and eventually the rest of the group as they <em> finally</em> noticed us. </p><p>As I pilfered multiple dog friendly foods during lunch, Wayne began to suspect something. It wasn’t subtle – me nor him. His suspicion oozed off him in waves and he was obviously burning with curiosity and I was burning with the fact that I couldn’t keep secrets for shite. (I also loved to tell stories of my glorious heart and my crusades of peace and kindness but that’s beside the point.) So I cracked fast, like an egg on concrete (do Wizards have concrete…?) All it took was one “Oi, Evie, what in Merlin’s beard are you doing?” from Wayne and I was spilling everything.</p><p>“I’m stealing food for a stray dog I saw by the Forest. Please, please, please, please don’t tell Professor Sprout,” I blurted out quickly. He looked surprised and also slightly confused; he had obviously not been prepared for that answer.</p><p>“Wanna come with me? It’ll be fun and plus, it’s a <em> dog</em>! We ‘puffs have got a reputation of loving all things cute and cuddly to maintain! It would be a dishonor to our house to abandon this sad creature in its most dire time of need, would it not?” I continued, pleadingly.</p><p>“Yeah but it’s a <em> stray</em> dog. How do we know of its cute and cuddliness when it lives by the bloody forest? It’s probably a blood thirsty beast by now.”</p><p>“You have a point,” I agreed, but I was stubborn, and it was a <em> dog</em> so I pushed on, “<em>but</em> you didn’t see the poor thing. It was barely alive and seemed like it could hardly hold its own weight. If it doesn’t want us to touch it we can just leave the food for it to eat. Either way it needs food.”</p><p>I finished wrapping up my third cloth napkin-full of roast chicken, roast beef and an assortment of carrots and potatoes. No use giving anything like bread or sweets to a dog and these foods were the most common stuff I found on muggle dog food packages anyways – excluding the potatoes, but the thing deserved a treat for god’s sake. </p><p>Wayne looked contemplative for a second before nodding and moving to stand as I shoved the knapsacks under my robes.</p><p>“God knows you’ll need someone to keep you safe from the dementors and who better than me. It would be my pleasure to escort you safely to your inevitable death by mauling.”</p><p>“<em>Of course</em> you can’t come unless you pretend it was your idea. It’s a wonder you’re not in Slytherin you arrogant bastard.”</p><p>He shoved me playfully but pulled a very offended looking face that made me instinctively mutter a “Sorry.” He grinned smugly and I groaned.</p><p>“Ughh, I forgot you can’t be offended. Why do I even try to be sarcastic with anyone? It’s either the person I’m joking with actually gets offended or they pretend to be offended and both make me feel just awful with myself. I can’t help it I’m bad at jokes. If you looked inside my head you’d know I am quite funny until my mouth gets involved,” I spurted out.</p><p>(Yep. <em>Spurted.</em> Not that weird at all.)</p><p>He looked amused at my struggles and sighed in exasperation. </p><p>“I’d say your humor doesn’t come from the words you say but how badly you fumble them.”</p><p>I glared. </p><p>(But seriously ouch. The truth of that aside, I was quite sensitive about my lack of social grace.)</p><p>“No seriously,” he continued at my look, “You’re funny because of your personality and how hard you try to be funny. You might not be good with words like me and my fellow Slytherins,” I laughed at that, “but you’re funny in your own right. You’re a silly faces kind of funny and bad attempts at wit kind of funny and it’s just as funny as the Weasley twins if you ask me”</p><p>I glared harder, though slightly mollified.</p><p>“Flattery will not save you now, serpent. You’ll die from the weight of your lies alone.”</p><p>“Wow. That was actually pretty good,” he looked disproportionately astonished at my words and my brief pride at the joke was replaced with a playful anger.</p><p>All mollification was gone and I chucked a carrot at his head. </p><p>(It didn’t hit.)</p><p>***</p><p>By the time we had coaxed the black mutt out of the forest the bell struck noon and Wayne had to leave to rush to his 12:15 Arithmancy class which I wisely excluded from my schedule this year. I waved him goodbye and turned back to the dog, setting down one sack of food, pushing it forward and undoing its knot. I had until 2:30 before my next class and I planned to befriend the dog if it was the last thing I would do. </p><p>(It wasn’t that dire but I have a flare for the dramatics.)</p><p>He looked at me and the food with more suspicion on his face than I’d ever thought a dog could have and I raised my hands in surrender. I turned sideways and set my arms to the side as well as placing my palms upwards and looked away. </p><p>From the many, <em>many</em> attempts at training our very skittish dog, the professionals told my family that this was apparently the most nonthreatening position to a dog. I found it rather creepy but it worked for my dog so maybe…</p><p>After a minute of feeling the dog’s eyes on me and a silent standoff of wills, he – as I could now see it was a he – walked over to the food. It was probably taking all his willpower not to throw his caution to the wind and scarf the food down right now. The fact that he hadn’t was honestly astonishing. </p><p>I didn’t dare move, lest he be frightened, but I did try to assure him of my trustworthiness, even though I knew he wouldn’t understand. There’s something about animals that makes me blabber like a fool. I guess it’s something I picked up from my mum.</p><p>“It’s okay. The food’s safe, I’m not going to hurt you. You just seem hungry, aren’t you? You need to eat. It’s okay. Nothing’s going to hurt you.” </p><p>I tried to keep as much affection and cooing out of my voice so as not to scare him, and instead used as even and assuring a voice I could manage. </p><p>As I continued my meaningless reassurances, he sniffed at the food before tentatively licking at the chicken first. The amount of restraint was actually tugging at my heart now. There was no way a dog wouldn’t be pouncing on food like that if it wasn’t severely abused and probably through his food as well. No wonder he was a stray; I wouldn’t want to stay in a place like that either.</p><p>After what seemed like a lifetime of waiting, he nibbled at the chicken and finally ate something, no matter how small. Then, like he suddenly realized how much he needed it, he scarfed down the chicken and carrots in the napkin as quick as a blink. I started to smile before I realized he needed water too. Frowning, I considered trying to master my halfway completed aguamenti in the next hour before deciding against it and promising to bring water later.</p><p>He looked at me and for a second it felt like he could understand what I was saying, before it was gone and he was sniffing and nudging at my hand.</p><p>	I was surprised at his sudden forwardness but kept still until it was clear that he would accept me petting him. I scratched at the side of his face and behind his ears until, soon, he was on his back with me rubbing his belly. The dips of his ribs were distressingly deep but I made sure to pet every inch of him (after cleaning him with a few <em>scourgifys</em> of course). </p><p>After about a half hour of relentless affection to an obviously touch starved dog, he started to nudge me in the direction of the forest. I was wary and didn’t move as he trotted towards the edge and laid down in ball of bones and fur. He was seated at the trunk of the outermost tree of the forest and I could run away easily if there was any danger approaching. In fact, I would probably be just as safe there as I was here, fifteen meters away, if only for the reason that I’d probably hear something coming if I was that close. </p><p>Nodding, I moved towards the dog and sat beside him with my back towards the tree, facing the castle. I set my hand on his head and began carding my fingers through the long tangles that laid on his neck. He closed his eyes and seemed peaceful for the first time since I’d seen him. </p><p>“You ought to have a name. I can’t keep calling you dog and I’d like to say we’ll meet again as much as we can to get food for you but it’s hard to be sure you’ll stay, isn’t it? You seem like a nice dog. I couldn’t understand why anyone would want to hurt a dog like you. Or any dog for that matter.”</p><p>He looked up at me with his strange grey eyes and he almost seemed mournful. I leaned forward and put my face into his scraggly fur and breathed in the comforting scent of dog and forest and home. Dog-smell was an oddly nostalgic thing to me that made my heart clench sentimentally. </p><p>I gave him a kiss on his soft cheek and said lightly, comfortingly, “I rather like the name Patrick – no that doesn’t quite fit, though it is funny for a dog. You seem like you need some good Irish cheer, so I’d say Paddy works better. Plus, it’s better for a dog and less proper. Yes, I’d say I like Paddy, if it’s alright with you.”</p><p>As if he understood exactly what just happened, he pulled back to lick me in the face and gave a yip of pleasure. And yet, at that moment, I could have sworn there were tears swimming in the eerie sorrow of his eyes.</p>
