    <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit">Harry groaned as he slowly woke up, his head felt like someone had taken a beaters bat, and then proceeded to beat at his head, with a bludger attached to the end of it. As he slowly shifted on the bed, he groaned happily into the soft pillows....that is he did, until he heard a responding moan after he stopped moving. Frowning, Harry moved his arms...or at least, he TRIED to. Apparently one was pinned between two other pillows, and the other was currently underneath something soft and fabric like that seemed to be quite heavy, implying there was quite a bit of weight resting on his arm.</span>
  </p>
</div><div class="ace-line">
  <p>
    <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit"> </span>
  </p>
</div><div class="ace-line">
  <p>
    <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit">Opening his eyes slowly Harry wondered for a moment if the killing curse would be a mercy right now as the light of the room quickly blinded him. After a moment of adjusting Harry pulled his one arm out from under the fabric and found his glasses, slipping them into place and looking at the room around him. It appeared to be a very high end room with a big gambling theme going for it. Turning slightly to try to go back to sleep and hopefully lose the horrible migraine he had, Harry froze when he noticed where his other hand was. What he originally thought was two pillows were in fact two breast just barely covered by a bra, and Harry had curled his hand around one of them as he had been turning. Lifting his eyes from the breast, Harry found himself looking at the face of a woman he didn't know. </span>
  </p>
</div><div class="ace-line">
  <p>
    <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit"> </span>
  </p>
</div><div class="ace-line">
  <p>
    <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit">The young woman was a teenage looking girl with a tanned skin complexion and an athletic and well-fit build. She had long dark brown hair that was currently loose and splayed out everywhere. As he tried to move his arm, she murmured in her sleep and hugged his arm tighter. This action caused Harry to blush a deep crimson, after all, first, he didn't know the woman, and secondly, they were in a very intimate position. As Harry tried to wiggle free, his head pushed against the pillows again, and this time, he heard a moan, before a voice he knew well groaned and then said the following words, "Stop that Harry, we can play more later..." Harry gulped in fear, that had sounded a lot like Nym.</span>
  </p>
</div><div class="ace-line">
  <p>
    <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit"> </span>
  </p>
</div><div class="ace-line">
  <p>
    <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit">Turning his head slightly, and lifting it when he noticed his hand wasn't the only thing touching breasts Harry found that he had been resting on Nym's and that made his blush darken considerably further. Harry quickly tried to recall just what the hell had happened but all he could come up with was a huge blur. That was about the time he heard the shower turning off and his eyes whipped to the door the sound had come from, dreading what was about to leave the bathroom. Part of him almost hoped it would be Remus, and that he'd be able to explain everything to Harry and also make sure the mystery woman in bed with Harry and Tonks wouldn't get the wrong idea.</span>
  </p>
</div><div class="ace-line">
  <p>
    <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit"> </span>
  </p>
</div><div class="ace-line">
  <p>
    <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit">From the bathroom came a red headed woman in a towel. At first she didn't seem to notice Harry was awake and could see her clearly as she began to remove the towel. However Harry's sudden gasp as he covered his eyes quickly put a stop to that.</span>
  </p>
</div><div class="ace-line">
  <p>
    <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit"> </span>
  </p>
</div><div class="ace-line">
  <p>
    <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit">"Ah, your awake finally," the woman said, a hint of amusement in her voice, "Though, given the hangover I had, I imagine yours must be quite worse, given that, when I had met up with you, you had been drinking for quite a while already," she sounded kind of disapproving as she finished. "Though, I must say, I was quite surprized when I woke up and saw just how much you had won," now she sounded quite amused, and looked it too.</span>
  </p>
</div><div class="ace-line">
  <p>
    <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit"> </span>
  </p>
</div><div class="ace-line">
  <p>
    <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit">"Won?" Harry questioned softly and questioningly. Seeing his confused look, the red head smiled sadly, "You really don't remember much do you?" she asked, getting a shake of the head in response, "To be honest, my memory is...kinda fuzzy too," she said, sounding like she was disturbed by the notion of her memory being 'fuzzy', "I can say you cleaned out no less then thirteen casinos, and when you cleaned out the fourteenth, they comped you a room, in the obvious hopes of eventually winning back some of their ill gotten money," she said with an amused smirk when she saw the dumbfounded look on Harry's face. Then she suddenly had a look of realisation on her face, "Oh, there was also those two animals you won, one was a giant egg, with scale like patterns on it, and the other was some kitten of a breed I have never seen before..."</span>
  </p>
</div><div class="ace-line">
  <p>
    <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit"> </span>
  </p>
</div><div class="ace-line">
  <p>
    <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit">"Fourteen casinos?" Harry repeated in shock. He'd cleaned out fourteen casinos? Had someone slipped him Felix Felicis without him knowing it? Shaking off the shock Harry turned to what she had just finished saying. An egg with scales? That sounded almost like a dragon egg. And what was this about a kitten? "Um, sorry to have to ask this miss, but who are you?" Harry asked her, trying not to think about how he was in bed with one of his chaperones as well as a young woman he'd never met before, and Remus was still unaccounted for.</span>
  </p>
</div><div class="ace-line">
  <p>
    <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit"> </span>
  </p>
</div><div class="ace-line">
  <p>
    <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit">The red head sighed, and shook her head, "Sorry to break this to you, but, we got married, all four of us," she said, and not seeing his look of horror, added, "Already checked the marriage certificates, they said something about being bound by Vows of Magic or something," she sounded a bit irritated by that, almost angry, "That pink haired woman whose breasts your resting on is one of the witnesses as is Laura who currently has your arm wedged between her own," she paused for a moment, "I remember you taking us to a district I never heard of before in the city, and getting me a drink of something called Ogden's Old Firewhisky, after that, everything is a blur, and even I can't recall what happened, I only know that when I woke up on top of you, I scoured the room, had to stay clear of the kitten though as its claws need to be trimmed," she finished. Inwardly, she was cursing herself for getting drunk and somehow married to the target she had been sent to investigate.</span>
  </p>
</div><div class="ace-line">
  <p>
    <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit"> </span>
  </p>
</div><div class="ace-line">
  <p>
    <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit">Thinking back Harry vaguely recalled a bottle or two of fire whisky appearing at some point, however anything after that was still blurry to him. "You still haven't told me who you are?" He was doing his best not to think about the news that he's married to both of the mystery women and Nym. After all if he actually tried to think about it, Harry was sure that he would have a heart attack. He was dreading what Remus would say or think when he learned of this, after all Remus had always looked at Harry almost as a son. For Harry to get married to three women at the age of fifteen might just kill him.</span>
  </p>
</div><div class="ace-line">
  <p>
    <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit"> </span>
  </p>
</div><div class="ace-line">
  <p>
    <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit">The woman smiled, "Well, my name is Natasha, Laura is the one with brown hair, and the other woman is someone you know," suddenly there was a knock at the door, and Natasha, in a blur, grabbed an outfit off the pile next to Harry and then went to answer the door. Harry in the meantime, looked around the room as best he could, and saw dozens of duffle bags bearing various Casino logos on them, some of them were mundane, but some of them were ones that were owned by magicals, something he gulped at as he had been told to stay clear of those ones by Remus, apparently in his drunken state, he had ignored that advice.</span>
  </p>
</div><div class="ace-line">
  <p>
    <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit"> </span>
  </p>
</div><div class="ace-line">
  <p>
    <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit">The door opened and Natasha almost sighed in relief when she saw it was Coulson, thankfully without Clint, though she had a feeling he wasn't too far behind.</span>
  </p>
</div><div class="ace-line">
  <p>
    <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit"> </span>
  </p>
</div><div class="ace-line">
  <p>
    <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit">"Given how long you've been off the grid for and where I found you, I trust this will be an interesting story?" Coulson questioned before looking past her to the bed. Upon seeing Harry and the two sleeping women though, Coulson frowned and turned back to Natasha. "Start talking," He ordered like he was talking to a child who'd done something they shouldn't have.</span>
  </p>
</div><div class="ace-line">
  <p>
    <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit"> </span>
  </p>
</div><div class="ace-line">
  <p>
    <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit">Natasha sighed, knowing how bad this looked as well as being against the rules. "I'll get dressed and then tell you everything I know in the hall. Don't want to wake the other two," She then turned and returned to the bathroom. Though she didn't have any problems getting dressed in front of Coulson and she had clearly been naked in front of her new husband before, Natasha wanted the privacy to get her thoughts in order as well as try to recall more.</span>
  </p>
</div><div class="ace-line">

  </p>
</div><div class="ace-line">
  <p>
    <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit">Coulson mean while stepped into the room and shut the door before giving Harry a small nod. "Rough night?" He asked, trying to put the young man at ease, if only just a little.</span>
  </p>
</div><div class="ace-line">
  <p>
    <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit"> </span>
  </p>
</div><div class="ace-line">
  <p>
    <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit">Harry shook his head sadly, "Can't even tell, last thing I remember is arriving in Vegas and hitting up one of the casinos with my chaperones," he said, not seeing the frown that marred Coulson's face at the mention of chaperones.</span>
  </p>
</div><div class="ace-line">
  <p>
    <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit"> </span>
  </p>
</div><div class="ace-line">
  <p>
    <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit">"How old are you son?" Coulson was almost dreading the answer, for if it was lower then what he was hoping for then it would mean a great deal of trouble for Natasha and the two women in bed with the young man.</span>
  </p>
</div><div class="ace-line">
  <p>
    <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit"> </span>
  </p>
</div><div class="ace-line">
  <p>
    <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit">"Fifteen sir," Harry answered, rubbing at the side of his head with his free hand, trying to nurse the headache that was developing.</span>
  </p>
</div><div class="ace-line">
  <p>
    <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit"> </span>
  </p>
</div><div class="ace-line">
  <p>
    <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit">Coulson let out a sigh of relief at that. While still young it wasn't as bad as it could be, though he was slightly worried about what Natasha was going to do once she learned of this.</span>
  </p>
</div><div class="ace-line">

</div><div class="ace-line">
  <p>
    <span class="author-g-ohcn42kdeuktpjit">Natasha stepped out of the bathroom at that point, clearly having not heard a word of what was said and walked towards the door. "I'll just be outside if the other two wake up," She told Harry before opening the door and stepping out with Coulson. Once in the hall and a few feet from the door Natasha turned to Coulson and sighed, "I really don't recall much after being offered Ogden's Old Firewhisky. Just how long was I off the grid for?" She knew it had to be more than 24 hours at least, otherwise Coulson wouldn't be here in person.</span>

She'd gotten herself married to a teenager alongside two other women. When word of this gets around Shield, she knew that there would be no shortage of comments and rumors about her. Hell, just Clint alone was going to be bad enough.</span>

When he did notice it, he realised instantly what it was, he had studied them back in third year when Remus had taught them about dark creatures, and in his fourth year when he started Care of Magical Creatures and had studied the book once Hagrid had shown how to disarm it. The 'kitten' that Harry had won, was a fucking Nundu kit. Needless to say, he screamed, loudly, causing the 'kitten' to glare at him in irritation.</span>

Luara, meanwhile shot up and seemed to go on the defense, her claws at the ready, realizing his hand was now free Harry jumped off the bed and scrambled for his wand. He wasn't sure just what the Nundu kit would do and he didn't want to be unarmed if it tried to hurt one of them. However to his surprise the kit simply curled up and went to sleep on the bed.</span>

I do recall Remus being there too with some woman with jet black hair and that made him seem small by comparison, after that, well, it’s kind of a blur, I vaguely recall casinos, chases by groups of men and women with guns, and lots and lots of drinks..." she finished, then blushed when she saw the shocked looks of everyone.

It seemed that after they left the hotel, the mysterious tall woman that Nym had seen with Remus had arrived ahead of them, and was currently holding a police officer three feet off the ground while the others surrounded her; meanwhile, she looked highly annoyed, though also slightly amused. "You will bring me the one know as Remus Lupin now, or I shall drag this one down to Helheim when I return there!" she ordered.</span>

What Harry wasn't saying was that he was looking forward to seeing how bad Remus got while drunk, he was sure it was going to be good for a laugh later.

Though she did kind of wonder just what kind of person this Remus guy is. After all both Harry and Nym seemed to be of the mind that he would never do anything like what Bogo had claimed he'd done.

Truth be told Coulson had already seen a little of the footage Bogo had spoken of, having looked over the arresting footage as well as the security footage from when Harry arrived in Vegas to be sure that he had gotten the location of Remus. Needless to say Coulson was very amused at what the seemingly quiet man had gotten into from the short video Coulson had been able to see.</span>

It wasn't like she knew this Remus person, not as far as she knew that is, so it was best she stay out of it for now and in any case she had something else on her mind. Like the person coming to see her about her sudden marriage. Laura was certain that whatever Remus had done would quickly be forgotten once HE found them.

"'The Bumbling Genius', was the title that you were given I believe?" Bogo countered, to which Coulson sighed.</span>

Laura could understand maybe having two at the most, but five families? How does one person end up the last living member of five houses?</span>

She had long since had that ability removed when she graduated from the Red Room. She dreaded having to tell her new husband about that and could only wonder just what the British magical community would say about this. Not that it would hurt her much, she was just worried about the effect it would have on Harry.</span>

He didn't recall much of what happened while he was drunk, but from what he'd heard, it had been really bad. And to top off his 'misadventures,' he had gotten married. He was supposed to be the responsible adult on this trip, and yet here he was, being released from jail, with a wife. At least, unlike Harry he had only married once. Though Remus couldn't help but worry about what his new wife will think when she learns he's a werewolf. That would have to be something he tells her once they are safely back in the hotel room.</span>

As Harry looked around for the person who had fired, a man in red and silver armor flew from out of the trees and into view, "Greetings Mister Radcliff," he began, "Well, greetings isn't really the word I should be using I guess, I was hired to take you out and recover the money you won," he then readied the weapons attached to his wrist, preparing to fire, "Hold still and this will be painless!" he said.</span>
