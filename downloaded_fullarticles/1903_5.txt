  <strong>1860</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>She’s only a child when her mother steals her away in the middle of a lesson to adventure deep into the woods. It’s well past midnight, but on a clear night during the full moon it’s the closest Bellatrix gets to experiencing what it would be like to walk in daylight. She was born in darkness and is cursed to live in darkness for all eternity, but nights like these make it feel less like she’s missing out. She’ll never feel the warmth of the sun on her skin, no, but what does that matter in the cold and glorious light of the moon?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>The woods are bristling with mysterious life at this time of night. So much more than just the owls and the crickets. There’s always the feeling of something more out here, in the deep, dark unexplored.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Never stray from me, Bella,” Druella says, crushing her daughter’s hand in her protective grip, “We are not the only monsters lurking out here,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“I thought we were the apex predators, mum,” Bellatrix says, baring her fanged teeth as if to ward off anything that may be watching.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“That we are,” Druella responds,“But there are stupid, brazen creatures that would seek to test us. And you are small, sweet one, and my love for you makes me vulnerable,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Bellatrix growls, sounding more like a baby lioness than anything fearsome, “I’ll kill anything that dares challenge you,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Druella chuckles and releases Bellatrix’s hand to wrap her arm around her shoulders, “That’s my girl,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>They continue their journey, moving gracefully and quickly into the endless depths. Druella is sure to move at a slower pace for her daughter, but the girl is faster than others her age. They reach their destination in less than an hour, though they are miles away from any human dwellings.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>A small, dilapidated cabin rests between two towering oak trees, so overgrown with moss and weeds that it would be easy to miss if one didn’t know of its presence. A warm, flickering glow emanates from an open window. Bellatrix follows her mother forward, her heavy skirts even heavier with the mud of the forest weighing her steps. She feels as if she’s moving towards something life altering.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Druella knocks three times, the sound disrupting a nearby cloud of bats and shattering the quiet of the small clearing. The door opens, revealing a slender woman with unruly, curly brown hair and round spectacles that make her eyes appear twice the normal size. Bellatrix wants to laugh at her drabness but her mother is in a very serious mood, so she fights the instinct.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Cassandra,” Druella greets.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Oh, is this her?” Cassandra says, leaning around Druella to get a better look at the girl standing behind her skirts.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Druella clears her throat, looking down her nose at the woman. Cassandra straightens and moves to the side, waving her visitors forward, “Oh, my apologies, I forgot. Please come in, come in,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Druella brushes past her and Bellatrix follows. A thousand powerful smells hit her nose instantly, nearly causing her to gag. The walls are lined with dried herbs, the shelves are overflowing with ancient books and jars of different animal parts and strange liquids. There’s a crackling fireplace on the far wall and a cauldron hovering over it, with some bubbling potion emitting an abhorrent odor. Bellatrix slaps a hand over her nose and stomps a foot, refusing to move another step into this foul place.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Please excuse the smell. Wouldn’t you know frog brains and dead man’s foot are quite smelly when boiled? You’ll get used to it, dear,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Bella’s senses are especially sensitive right now. She’s in her formative years, after all. Couldn’t you cover it up?” Druella says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>While Cassandra searches for the cauldron’s lid Bellatrix shuffles forward, closer to her mother. The statuesque woman looks odd in this decrepit setting. Pristine blonde hair swept neatly atop her head and an expensive gown, she looks starkly out of place. She’s never seen her somewhere so beneath her. She wonders what is so important to draw her mother to such a place.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>The smell becomes much more bearable when the unruly woman covers it up with the cast-iron lid, allowing Bellatrix to drop the hand covering her face. Cassandra then brushes off the couch cushions and motions for them to take a seat.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“The tea should be ready any moment now. Please, have a seat,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Druella breathes through her nose and does as she’s asked. Bellatrix wrinkles her nose but follows suit when she receives a stern look.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>It’s not long before they are joined by the odd woman once again. A steaming cup of tea is handed to the child sitting stiffly on the couch and Cassandra rests comfortably in the armchair across from them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Why only me?” Bellatrix complains, giving the tea an experimental sniff.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“That’s why we’re here, my dear. Cassandra Trelawney here is a seer, and she has something very important to discuss with us about your future. Isn’t that right, Cassandra?”</p><p>“<em>You’re </em>a seer?” Bellatrix asks, sneering at the woman across from her.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Well, yes,” Cassandra says, sitting up straighter in her chair as if trying to gain the approval of the ten year old.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Bella, be polite,” Druella absconds.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“She’s just…not what I would expect,” Bellatrix says, sipping her tea.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Now, Cassandra, this vision you had, could you tell when it will take place?” Druella asks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“I could not. I saw only flashes. She is fully grown, I can tell you that much. I felt her pain, her hunger, her desire as if it was my own,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Bellatrix furrows her brow and tilts her head back, the hot tea scalding her throat as she gulps it down. Cassandra leans forward to observe Bellatrix with gigantic eyes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Quite the range of emotion you’ll have, child. Not many feel things the way you do. Or will,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Druella laughs, “The temper tantrums this one has would terrify you,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Bellatrix finishes her tea and places it on the cluttered wooden table between them. “Now what?” She asks, “Am I going to have a vision?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“No, dear,” Trelawney says, picking up her empty cup, “The vision's been had. This is merely to gain some clarity,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>The seer peers into the cup, her spectacles slipping down her narrow nose. Bellatrix shuffles impatiently, kicking her feet against the legs of the coffee table.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Hmm, yes, very curious indeed,” Cassandra looks at the child in front of her and tilts her head before returning her gaze to her cup, “Yes, this will be your undoing, child,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Is she in danger?” Druella says, growing impatient with the vague comments.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“No, no, not now. Not from this, anyway,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Well what is it, then?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Cassandra passes the cup to Druella, a slight tremor in her hand. Bellatrix can hear her blood rushing.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“What am I looking at?” Druella says, twirling the mug in her hands and tilting her head, “Blood splatter?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“No,” Cassandra says, “It is the sun,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“The <em>sun?” </em>Druella shrieks, giving the seer a wild look, “You mean to tell me my daughter will burn-”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“No, no, nothing like that!” Cassandra exclaims. Druella settles but her shoulders still tremble with fury at the thought of her daughter befalling such a fate, “It’s merely symbolic. The catalyst I saw in the vision was a girl. A little younger than Bellatrix will be but older than she is now. A girl with brown hair and brown eyes. Be wary of her, little one,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“That describes a million people” Bellatrix says, frowning.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“What else can you tell us about her?” Druella asks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“She will awaken things in you that will lie dormant for your entire life. You will feel things you never thought possible. She will light you aflame yes, but from the inside,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Bellatrix wrinkles her nose, “What kind of witch is she? I’ll burn her alive before I allow her to harm me!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Cassandra chuckles, giving her that look adults sometimes give her that she <em>hates. </em>The look that says <em>I know better than you.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em></p><p>“She will not harm you. You will harm yourself because of her,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“I will do no such thing!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“The future is not set in stone, though prophesies are not often false. In fact, I have never known of one to not come to pass,” The seer says darkly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“I have to say, this doesn’t sound very dire,” Druella comments, “It sounds like you’re describing some infatuation,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“I assure you, it’s much more than that. This could certainly mean the end of your daughter if she’s not careful,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Druella nods, lowering her eyes to her lap.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Sunlight is a good omen for most,” Cassandra continues, “For your kind, however, it is one to be feared. It means death, violence, pain…This girl is the sun, the dawn, the harbinger of change. It feels as though your daughter must let the sunlight touch her skin, let her warmth seep into her bones if she is to survive,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Is the girl a threat or a savior, then? Which is it?” Druella snaps.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“I believe that depends on Bellatrix,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>She rises, holding out a hand to her daughter. Cassandra walks them to the door and places a hand on Druella’s arm before she can exit.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Young Bellatrix will grow to be fearsome. She will be ruthless, a monument to her name. Warrior. But she must be wary of losing her humanity,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Druella pulls her arm away and jerks her chin up so she’s looking down on Cassandra, “We are Blacks. We are pure of blood. She has no <em>humanity</em>,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>With that, the pair leaves the seer’s cabin. Mother and daughter are swallowed back up by the darkness. Bellatrix feels settled surrounded by it. It’s where she belongs, after all.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>For now, anyway.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>
  <b>Scotland, 2019</b>
</p><p> </p><p>Narcissa Malfoy hasn’t seen her sister in 14 years. It’s not the first time Bellatrix has disappeared for an extended period of time. The woman is consumed by whatever desire comes to her on a whim; sometimes she leaves to hunt the Order and avenge the death of their parents, sometimes she leaves to immerse herself in some corner of the world she hasn’t yet explored. She’s addicted to whatever makes her feel alive; be it revenge, sex, love or death.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>She tends to reappear unceremoniously, as if she hasn’t been gone for over a decade. Neither she nor her sister have ever been the affectionate sort, the love between them known but unspoken. Despite the amount of time that may have passed, they find it easy to pick up their dynamic where it left off. Eternity has an odd affect on people. Years feel like weeks in the span of a century.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>It’s why Narcissa isn’t surprised when the door to her house slams open in the dead of night. She doesn’t miss a note in the song she’s playing on the piano</p><p>Bellatrix doesn’t come to greet her. She goes straight to the kitchen, probably the liquor cabinet by the sounds of the clinking drifting in from the other room.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Narcissa stops playing when she hears a glass break.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Those are crystal,” She calls.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Bellatrix zips into the room with inhuman speed, whisky sloshing in her glass. She grins in leu of an apology.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“The place looks good, Cissy. You’ve always been so talented at keeping up with the times. Never one to fall out of style,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Narcissa sighs and stands to face her sister. She hasn’t changed a bit. Unlike Narcissa, Bellatrix refuses to change at the pace of the world around her. Her style evolves at her own leisure and she’s barely dragged herself out of the 19th century, still favoring floor length black dresses and corsets.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Where have you been?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Bellatrix takes a sip and gestures vaguely, “Here and there,”</p><p>“Looking for your little soulmate?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Bellatrix rolls her eyes and walks away from her, fussing with the trinkets and photographs adorning the mantle of the fireplace. “Not this time. I was hunting,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Kill anyone good?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Some lower level Order members. I can’t even recall their names. The little fuckers just keep breeding and converting, but I like to be optimistic. It’s just more blood sacks for me to rip open in mother and father’s names,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Narcissa chuckles, “I’m sure they’d be very proud,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Bellatrix downs her drink and raises her chin proudly. Narcissa marvels at how little she’s changed since she was a child. Father always used to call her his little demon, and mother called her the little spitfire of the family. Ever since she was little Bellatrix has been fiercely protective of her family. It’s why she took the death of their parents the hardest. Narcissa and Andromeda were satisfied when they tracked down the men who’s set the house ablaze.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>It’s why Bella joined Tom Riddle, or Voldemort as he liked to go by now. The ancient vampire is even older than them, turned back in the 1400s. His vendetta against the Order stretched back long before Bella was born, so it was only a matter of time before she found him and swore herself to him in exchange for their destruction.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Voldemort keeps her on a loose leash, trading information with her and letting her punish her findings as she sees fit. He calls on her sparingly, though whenever he does it takes so much out of her. Narcissa has met the man only once, and the single experience has made her terrified for her sister. To be in his presence is to be in the midst of true, ancient evil. She fears Bellatrix becoming like him, twisted beyond recognition by a fruitless quest for vengeance.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Bellatrix’s voice interrupts her musings, “What is there to do for fun around here? You have any favorite places to eat?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“There’s lost of dark alleyways in Diagon Alley. The students from a local private school venture there often. I know you like them young,”</p><p>Bellatrix rolls her eyes, tossing her head back dramatically, “You make it sound gross. Young blood is healthier, stronger. It’s not polluted with the ailments of old age <em>and </em>their minds recover easier when I erase their memories. Besides, physically you and I aren’t much older than them,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“I’m just teasing you, Bella. I know. This town is mostly made up of the very young and the very religious,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Right, remind me why you settled here, again? The Order operates under the assumption that they’re doing God’s work, so why live somewhere where they likely have influence?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Hogwarts School for Gifted Boys and Girls is one of the best schools on the continent, and Draco only deserves the best. If I can snuff out any Order members along the way, then you’ll be the first to know. I don’t fear them,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“You should,” Bellatrix says darkly, “They killed mother and father. They were twice the vampires you or I will ever be,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Narcissa disagrees, but she knows better than to voice her opinion with Bellatrix on that front. The three sisters are older now than their parents ever grew to be, and Bellatrix is far fiercer. She knows that once her sister loves and idolizes someone, there’s nothing you can say or do to diminish her devotion. It’s one of the things she loves about her.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“I’m being extremely cautious. Besides, the Order doesn’t know about pure blood vampires. Having a son and a husband absolves me of suspicion. You’re alone, so you’ll have to be more careful than I. Stick to the shadows, alright?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“As if I have a choice,” Bellatrix says, “I’m going to get something to eat. Would you like me to bring something back for you?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“If you’d be so kind,” she says, resuming her song. Bellatrix turns to leave. “Be discreet!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Bellatrix leaves, her laugh lingering in the air. Lucius descends the stair almost as soon as she’s alone and her fingers cease their movements once again.</p><p>“Is she gone?” He asks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Narcissa rises to greet her husband, pecking him on the cheek, “Yes, dear, your big bad sister-in-law is gone. She won’t be for long, though. She’s always quick to catch her prey,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Lucius sighs and wraps her in his arms, “She better behave. And she better not break any of my things this time,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“I’m sure she’ll find ways to entertain herself. She’s never been one to stay in one place for too long. She always spends most of her time out and about, and she’ll grow tired of our humble little town quickly,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>The pair of them curl up on the loveseat and await Bellatrix’s return. Narcissa rests her head on Lucius’s shoulder and reads the open book on his lap along with him, enjoying the quiet. Nights like these she likes to pretend Draco is just upstairs, nose buried in his homework. He stays at the dormitories provided by the school, though, to preserve the facade of normalcy. She became pregnant with him before she turned Lucius, so he’s only a half-blood. This allows him certain benefits, like being able to walk in the sun. It makes it easier to blend in. All vampires are cursed to burn in the daylight except half-bloods, which can only be produced by pure-bloods mating with humans. She's happy Draco is able to have what's quite nearly a completely normal life. </p><p>Narcissa dozes on her husband’s shoulder.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Bellatrix is back before the fire dies out, a tall redheaded boy in tow. One look at his glossed over eyes and beguiled expression lets her sister know he’s under Bellatrix’s thrall completely. She tugs him along by the arm, plopping down in the armchair and pulling his arm so his wrist lay exposed to her.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Not on the carpet, Bella, please. I’ve just had it cleaned,” Narcissa says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Bellatrix stops a breath away from the man’s wrist to glare at her sister. “You’re no fun,” Bellatrix pouts.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Bellatrix yanks him out of the living room and through the archway leading to the dining room. The ebony hardwood floor would clean just fine. She shoves the man into a chair at the table and kneels in front of him. She tears into his exposed wrist with no thought of cleanliness. Blood spurts in every which direction and she digs in hungrily, hot spurts filling her mouth anew each time she swallows.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Fix me a glass before you completely drain him, will you?” Narcissa calls, following her to the other room. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Bellatrix pulls her mouth away and covers her puncture wounds with her fingers, “Come get it yourself. I’ve done the work in getting him here,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>She returns to her meal and it’s not long before she hears Narcissa approach from behind. She lets out a small noise of disgust.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“This is ridiculous. Do you have to make such a mess every time?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Bellatrix gives a wet growl in response. She shakes her head, making the blood come out faster. Narcissa taps her shoulder until she looks at her, and she presents a wine glass.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>She withdrawals again reluctantly and presses her fingers against his wound so it spurts accurately into her sister’s glass.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Say when,” Bellatrix grumbles.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>The glass is nearly overflowing when Narcissa says, “When,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Bellatrix sinks her teeth in again, and the man groans weakly. He shoves at her shoulders, making her latch on harder instinctually. Without removing her mouth, she pins him with a look and forces her will on him.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p><em>Relax, </em>she thinks, <em>Your pain will end soon.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em></p><p>The front of her dress is soaked through now, rivets of blood pouring from her mouth. The last bits always taste the best. She can taste the life leaving his body. It feels like she’s drinking his soul.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Stop, Bella. We can’t kill them all,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Bellatrix knows she’s right, but she can’t bring herself to give a damn. The animal inside her wants to kill, and why shouldn’t she?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Think of what a pain it is to dispose of a body,” Narcissa says, “You can glamour him to clean up his own mess,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Bellatrix yanks his wrist away from her mouth, gasping. She punctures the tip of her finger with a fang and runs her blood across his wound, the bleeding ceasing instantly. She rises to her feet and takes slow, deep breaths, quelling the bloodlust. She’ll spare him today, but she’s never been very good at keeping playthings around for long without slipping up.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Narcissa rubs her back in a rare display of affection, “Go clean yourself up. I’ll handle him,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Bellatrix wipes her mouth, only serving to smear the mess of blood covering the lower part of her face. She abandons the half-dead man and begins stripping on her way to the bathroom. Downstairs, of course, so she doesn’t get blood on her sister’s precious carpet.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>The guest bathroom is as extravagant as the rest of the house. <em>Malfoy Manor, </em>her sister calls it. She hates that her sister took that man’s last name, no matter how much respect the Malfoy name commands in the human world. No name is as noble or ancient as Black.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>She licks her fingers before turning the faucet on the clawfoot tub. The scalding water fills it as she finishes removing her dress, leaving it on a pile away from the plush white mat. The bathroom is covered in cold, black tile, contrasting against the flawless porcelain of the tub and sink.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Once the tub is full, Bellatrix sinks into it with a grateful sigh. The remaining blood seeps into the water, tinting it pink. She grabs the hanging lavender above the tub and breaks off the petals to scatter them in the water. She slips down, up to her chin, and lets the hot water sooth her aching muscles. The man had put up a fight before her influence took over. She’s not used to being fought, not anymore.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>The door creaks open and Narcissa slips in, still nursing a half-full glass of fresh blood. She perches precariously on the edge of the tub.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Where did you find him? He’s delicious,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“An odd little place called Flourish and Blotts. That pathetic little bookshop slash bar is brimming with filthy little humans who think they’re so very important,” Bellatrix scoffs, “So pretentious. I could slaughter them all without breaking a sweat. That would show them,”</p><p>Flourish and Blotts is the perfect place to find victims. The late night bookstore doubles as a bar that has open mic nights for writers and musicians. It helps that the clientele seems to be poets and moody teenagers who are easily enamored by the air of darkness Bellatrix carries with her.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Well, then we’d have to leave town again. I don’t want to do that. I quite like being home,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“This isn’t home,” Bellatrix flicks her wrist, getting a few drops of water on Narcissa, “London is home,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Narcissa sighs, “London stopped being home when Mother and Father were murdered. We have to make the most of where we are now. Oh, damn it, you got bathwater in my glass,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Bellatrix snickers and slides further into the tub, so only her eyes remain above water. They glint mischievously.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Narcissa recognizes the look and rises from her perch before she can cause any more trouble.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Bella’s voice catches her before she can leave, “Would you like to keep this one? Since he’s <em>so yummy,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em></p><p><em>“</em>A ginger boy, hmm? I thought you only liked us to hold onto the little brunette girls,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Bellatrix twirls her wet curls between her fingers, “Perhaps I’m tired of searching. I’ve moved on,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Hmm, careful, Bella. That’s exactly the kind of thing one says before they find exactly what they’ve been searching for,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Bellatrix doubts it. She’s been searching since before she stopped aging. She’s beginning to think the ominous prophesy is nothing more than a cruel joke meant to toy with her mother’s emotions. The likelihood of finding someone at this point who’s capable of awakening anything in her is slim to none. She’s been cold and desolate inside for far too long to have any hope of ever seeing a sunrise.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>

</p><p>Hermione Granger’s eyes brighten when she’s sees the flyer in the window of her favorite bookstore. Flourish and Blotts hasn’t hired anyone since she started visiting back in her second year at Hogwarts. It’s one of the hottest spots for students and young adults alike to hang out, after all. There aren’t many places for underaged students to hang out where alcohol is served, and the bar/bookstore combination makes it the perfect spot. Apart from that, it’s within walking distance from Hogwarts. Hermione’s always loved it for its late hours, allowing her a comfortable spot to study late into the night.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>The smell of old books hits her as soon as she opens the door. The little bell jingles and Cedric Diggory, the manager, brightens when he sees her.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Hermione, I’m so happy to see you. Did you see the sign?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Hermione smooths out her cardigan as she winds around the piles of books to the front counter. She’s concerned at looking professional despite the fact that Cedric’s seen her several times a week for the past two years.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“I did, and I would love a chance to interview-”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“You’re hired,” Cedric interrupts, grinning.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Hermione stumbles on a stray textbook, “Wait-seriously?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Of course! Are you kidding, Hermione? I’ve known you for years. You’re easily the smartest, most responsible person I know. Besides, you’ve been bugging me for an opening here for months. I know how much you need this,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>He’s right. Between paying for her private school and saving for college, her parents were struggling to pay their mortgage. She needs a part time job if she wants to have a shot at going to a college worthy of her. This would be perfect. She sees Cedric studying at the bar during slow moments all the time.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“We need someone to work the register. You’ll only be selling books since you’re not old enough to serve alcohol yet,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Did someone leave? Why is there an opening?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Well, Bill didn’t show up to his shifts all last week. When I finally got ahold of him, he said he left town,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Hermione frowns, “That doesn’t sound like him,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“No,” Cedric agrees, “It’s all very strange. Maybe ask Ginny about it? Anyway, all we can do is move on I suppose. So, do you want it?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Hermione brushes off the anxiety she feels over Bill picking up and leaving like that and smiles.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Yes, yes I do,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>School finishes at 3 each day. There’s debate club afterwards, and then Hermione returns to the dorm room she shares with Ginny Weasley to change out of her uniform into something more comfortable for the second part of her day. She then walks the few blocks to Diagon Alley and starts her shift at 6:30. Three days a week she works from 4:30 to midnight, leaving her weekends free for schoolwork. Her life is full and busy but she’s happy. She knows she’s working towards a bright future. She’ll earn her degree and work her way out of debt, then she’ll pay off her parent’s mortgage, their car bill, everything.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Her parents protest when she tells them she’s picked up a part time job, but once they hear where it’s at and that she can do homework while she works, they feel better about it. The hardest part is getting trained on the register, but once she gets that down the job is hardly a job at all. She gets maybe a couple customers an hour, and once the sun sets and the late night patrons roll in, she just gets to sit back and enjoy the show.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>There’s a stage in Flourish and Blotts, and in her little corner surround by books she gets to sit back and enjoy her view. When it’s packed she can’t see the stage, but the sounds flood the building. Monday through Thursday the mic is open to poets, writers, or even the occasional student reading an essay aloud. Weekends are for live music, though most of the time the band is the same. Neville and Luna have their own little group, with Neville playing the guitar and Luna singing and playing odd tunes on her keyboard. They make quite the pair, their strange music suiting the establishment nicely.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>It’s a bit lonely. Once Cedric has her trained on the register she spends most of the shift alone, though the quiet makes studying easier. It’s almost startling when a customer slides a book across the counter and she remembers she’s at work.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>By the time her third Friday night rolls around she’s settled into a comfortable routine. The sun sets and she’s cozy on her stool, in her pink hoody and jeans with her history book open in front of her. Luna’s silvery voice fills the room, accompanied by Neville’s soft strumming. Hermione almost feels like she’s in a trance, until she feels a strange prickling at the back of her neck. Her stomach flips with uncertainty.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>It feels like she’s being watched.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>She looks up slowly from her book to survey the room. There isn’t anyone on her side of the shop. Everyone is either staring into their drinks at the bar or swaying along to Luna’s voice. There are few spots she can’t see. She tries to brush it off, to return to reading, but the unsettled feeling remains. It grows stronger the longer she ignores it until she snaps her eyes up once again.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>She spots a dark figure standing motionless on the second floor of the shop. The stairs to get to that floor are behind her, and it doesn’t make any sense that anyone could have gotten past her without her noticing. She slams her book shut and places a “be back soon” sign on the counter. She makes her way up the spiral staircase, keeping her eyes on the still black silhouette the whole way up.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>The only light is the silvery stage light accompanying her friend’s performance. It makes it impossible to make out any distinct features, apart from the slimness that makes her certain it’s a woman.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>She reaches the second story and the figure turns to face her.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Who are you?” Hermione asks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Hermione freezes in her tracks when the mystery woman advances on her. She feels an onslaught of dread as she draws closer, like some instinctual desire to run from a predator. The silver light moves and glances across the woman’s face, revealing skin the color of moonlight and a shock of dark hair.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Do not be afraid,” a low, silky voice says. She stops her approach, holding up her hands in an attempt to look unthreatening.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Step into the light,” Hermione says, her voice shaking.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“The light, hmm? You shouldn’t fear things under the cloak of darkness. Light…changes nothing,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>The voice is beautiful, melodic, but Hermione can’t fight the climbing panic inside of her. The woman steps forward again, one hand reaching for her, into the light. She sees long, slender fingers and red nails…she runs.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>She takes the stairs two at a time, flying down them and crashing straight into Cedric.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Hermione screams until she realizes who’s gripping her arms.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Jesus, Hermione, whats the matter?” Cedric says, clutching her tighter to keep her from running.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“S-someone upstairs…” she can’t articulate why she’s so terrified.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Cedric looks past her, peering up the stairs. “I don’t see anyone,” he says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Hermione is too terrified to check for herself. She stares past Cedric, at the exit. Luna’s voice sounds distant now, distorted, like she’s hearing it underwater.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“You’re shaking. Look, just take the rest of the night off. I can cover it for the next few hours,” Cedric gives her a little shake and Hermione snaps out of it enough to look at him.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>She nods slowly, trying to collect herself.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Do you need someone to walk you home?” He asks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Hermione shakes her head, finding her voice, “No, no, I’m being silly. It’s alright. I’ll be okay,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>She’s trying to convince herself. Even as the seconds tick by it seems ridiculous to be terrified of a woman shrouded in darkness. She didn’t say or do anything threatening, after all. She grabs Cedric’s forearm.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Just-just come with me to check okay?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Cedric nods, and he heads up the stairs in front of her. They check out the entire second floor and don’t find anyone. She’s not sure if the woman’s mysterious disappearance is comforting or if it makes the whole experience all the more terrifying. It shouldn’t be possible. Maybe she imagined the whole thing.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>The odd encounter sticks with her. She decides to stay and finish her shift. She even walks herself home, keys clutched between her fingers the entire way. The walk home is desolate at the late hour but well lit, and she makes it back in one piece. Ginny is asleep already, sprawled out and still wearing her field hockey jersey. The light is still on, thankfully, and it’s enough to quell some of Hermione’s nerves. She draws the curtains before changing, still feeling as if something sinister is nearby. The steady sound of Ginny’s soft snores comforts her, but she still leaves the light on after she crawls into bed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>It takes her an hour to relax, matching her breathing with Ginny’s. Her eyes slip shut at last, plunging her into the land of dreams. She’s walking through the wildflower fields behind her parents house, towards the thicket of pine trees that lie ahead. The sun is setting, but it’s warm and everything is bathed in gold light.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>She’s home.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>She reaches the trees, winding between the trunks and off the beaten path towards the sound of running water. She reaches the gentle stream she loves so much. Theres a towering willow tree by it, her favorite spot to read at as a child. She settles down in that familiar place, the smell of blooming flowers and damp earth drifting over her. She sighs happily, leaning back agains the trunk and hugging her knees to her chest. She sits there for a bit, enjoying the sound of the water and the chirping birds.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Then a twig behind her snaps.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>She jumps to her feet and whirls around. She’s had this dream before, and she’s always alone. Always.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Her defenses drop the moment her eyes find those of the intruder. She’s beautiful. She looks like she’s made of moonlight, with her shining pale skin and mess of dark hair cascading down her back. There’s a soft smile on her full red lips, and she looks very nonthreatening in her loose, lacy white dress. Still, there’s something off about her. She’s very still, standing there smiling, not even the rise and fall of breath gracing her chest.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Who are you?” Hermione asks, finally finding her voice.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>The woman steps forward, the low hanging leaves of the willow tree brushing against her shoulders. Hermione takes a step backwards, her back bumping against the trunk.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Don’t be afraid,” The woman says, her voice light and sweet, “My name is Bella. What’s yours?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“You’re in my dream,” Hermione says, “Shouldn’t you know?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Bella furrows her brow adorably and tilts her head, “Oh, is this your dream? I thought it was my own,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Hermione narrows her eyes but her shoulders relax. Bella is strange, yes, but this is <em>her </em>dream and she’s in control. She seems nonthreatening enough.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Okay, then. My name is Hermione,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Bella’s mouth twitches as that, soft brown eyes unblinking and mesmerizing, “Hermione. That’s a nice name. You don’t hear it often today,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“Thank you. I was picked on for it when I was younger,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>The woman’s beautiful face twitches and her eyes flash, “And what were their names? Something commonplace and boring, I’m sure,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Hermione smiles a little, “Pansy, Vincent and Draco were the worst of them. Ron wasn’t great at first either, but we’re good friends now,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Bella wrinkles her nose at the names. “Terrible, I knew it. They’re just jealous,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Hermione laughs and Bella smiles at the sound, taking it as an invitation to come closer. She walks right into Hermione’s space and looks her up and down, drinking her in. Hermione shifts under the intense gaze.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“What are you reading?” Bella asks, her breath tickling Hermione’s face.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Hmm?” Hermione looks down, only just noticing she has a book in her hands. She turns it over so they can see the cover. <em>Wuthering Heights.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em></p><p>“Oh, I like that one,” Bella says. She reaches for the book, her hand brushing against Hermione’s.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>She gasps, jerking away, “You’re freezing, Bella,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Oh,” Bella looks surprised, “Sorry about that. Here, is this better?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>She reaches for her again, this time for her free hand. She’s much warmer this time, and her hand is so soft as she laces their fingers together. Hermione’s stomach flutters and this close she could count each one of Bella’s eyelashes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>The sun has set now, the cool air of the evening sending a shiver down her spine. It’s strange. The sun has never set in this dream before.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“You’re the cold one, now,” Bella says, taking another step forward and pulling Hermione into a hug.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>She’s enveloped by her warmth, the smell of pine and roses settling over her. The bare skin of Bella’s arm slides around Hermione’s neck, trapping her in a warm but soft embrace. It’s gentle enough for her to know she can pull away if she wants to.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“What are you doing?” Hermione asks, going still against her. She hears Bella breathe in, smelling her hair.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Keeping you warm,” Bella shifts, brushing her lips against her neck. Hermione gasps, a shock running through her at the contact. If this were real, she would pull away, But it isn’t, so what’s the harm in indulging it for a moment? She tilts her head to the side, submitting to her.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Bella smiles against her skin before parting her lips and sucking on the exposed skin. Hermione shudders and drags a hand through Bella’s silky curls, encouraging her. Bella nips lightly at her, sending little shocks from her neck down through the entirety of her. Every nerve stands on end.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“I can feel your heart,” Bella whispers, one hand cupping the other side of Hermione’s neck, right against her thrumming pulse point. She nips her again, harder this time.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Ow,” Hermione complains, “Too hard,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Bella chuckles, a dark, sultry sound that does things to Hermione’s head. She kisses the spot apologetically, then drags her tongue from her neck up to the edge of her jaw, just below her ear.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Meet me here again, tomorrow night, all right?” She asks, kissing her earlobe.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“What?” Hermione murmurs, too distracted by Bella’s touches to understand what she means. The world feels like its shimmering around her, and the woman sounds farther away now.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Will you do that for me, Hermione?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Hermione? Hermione?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“What?” Hermione’s eyes fly open to find Ginny’s freckled face staring down at her.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“You’re going to be late for class, get up!” Ginny rips the blankets off of her and Hermione groans.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Five more minutes,” Hermione shuts her eyes, willing the dream to come back to her. She can still smell the roses. If she could just have a moment longer-<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>A pillow hits her in the face, shattering the illusion and driving the smell away.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“What the hell is wrong with you? You’re usually up an hour before me,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Hermione gets up and shuffles to the bathroom, “I was having a good dream,” she grumbles.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“I heard,” Ginny follows her, leaning against the doorframe while Hermione washes her face, “<em>Bella, Bella, you’re so beautiful, Bella!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em></p><p>Hermione flicks water at her, blushing. She’s never been one to talk in her sleep before, but with one that vivid she supposes it makes sense. She starts brushing her teeth, ignoring her roommate.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“I didn’t know you swung that way, Hermione. Ron will be disappointed,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Ginny leaves her before she can respond. She has to rush to get ready, throwing her things unceremoniously into her bag and forgoing a tie for the day. She jogs across campus, walking through the door to History as the bell rings.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Just in the nick of time, Miss Granger,” Professor Binns says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Hermione mumbles an apology, rubbing her eyes on her way to her desk. She’s right in the middle, between Ron and Harry. Ron’s resting his cheek on his fist, his eyes slipping shut before the lecture’s even started. Hermione pulls out her notebook as quietly as she can and steels herself to pay attention to Binns’s droning voice. Half the class depends on her for the notes she takes this period.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Routine can’t shake the eerily beautiful dream from her mind. Bella asked her to meet her again, was that even possible? She can’t control her dreams, she’s never been able to summon the willow tree dream before.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>She sighs and finds her gaze wandering to the cracked window. There’s a raven sitting on the windowsill, peering in at the class with a tilted head. It reminds her of the way Bella tilted her head in the dream last night. The raven looks at her and fluffs up a bit, trilling softly. It hops excitedly from foot to foot. Hermione has to stifle a laugh, looking away. Professor Binns is glaring.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Hermione hunches over her notebook, forcing herself to ignore the bird and pay attention to her studies.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>She doesn’t see the bird again that day. It gets easier to brush off the dream and the odd bird as the day goes by. The dream slips farther away the more she tries to think about it, like sand in her fists. The normalcy makes the day pass in a blur and before she know it she’s back from work and it’s past midnight. The second Hermione enters her room she knows something is wrong, the boring routine of her day shattered. Ron is sitting on Ginny's bed with his arm around her, both of their faces pale and devastated. Ginny has tears running down her face and Ron just looks like he's in shock. Hermione stops, keys still in hand, eyes darting between the two of them. </p><p>"What's happened?" She asks. </p><p>Ron blinks at her like he hadn't noticed her come in despite her standing right in front of him. Ginny tries to respond but a sob claws its way out of her throat. </p><p>Ron clears his throat, "Um, it's Bill. They...they found him," </p><p>Hermione hangs her keys and approaches the siblings, kneeling in front of them, "What do you mean...found him?" </p><p>"His..his body," </p><p>Ginny sobs again and Ron brings a hand to his face, trying to hide the tears falling down his cheeks. Hermione grasps each of their hands in her own, squeezing painfully as she feels the world spin around her. She didn't know Bill very well, but she can't imagine the pain that two of her closest friends must be feeling. They all were so unconcerned with his whereabouts and now who knows how long he’s been dead for?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Hermione can't find the words to comfort them. She surges forward, wrapping her arms around the pair of them. Ron sniffles loudly and Ginny cries into her neck, tears seeping down onto Hermione's shirt. </p><p>"They-they said it was an animal attack. That his-his throat was ripped open," Ron blubbers. </p><p>"Oh my God," Hermione breathes, tears filling her own eyes. </p><p>The door slams open and Hermione twists her head without letting go to see Harry's eyes frantically taking them in. When he sees the state they're all in he hurries over and sits next to Ginny, pulling her out of Hermione's arms and into his own. He grasps Ron's shoulder wordlessly, giving him a look that says <em>you don't have to explain. </em>Mrs. Weasley must have called him. Harry is as much a son to her as any of her biological children.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Ron and Harry end up sleeping in their dorm and Hermione, usually a stickler for rules, can't care less for them at the moment. Tonight nothing matters outside of this room. Ginny sleeps in her bed and Ron and Harry pass out with their shoulders pressed together in Ginny's bed. Ginny wraps herself around Hermione, face buried in her hair. She can't fall asleep until Ginny's cried herself dry, shuddering breaths finally evening and transitioning to snores.</p><p>The familiar sound of Ginny's snores lulls her to sleep. She's forgotten about the dream she had the night before until she opens her eyes and finds herself by the willow tree once again. </p><p>Bella is waiting for her, sitting in Hermione's usual spot and reading her book. She's wearing the same lace dress, her legs stretched out in front of her and crossed at the ankles. She looks up when Hermione draws near and pouts at her.</p><p>"You're late,”</p><p>Hermione looks around her in awe, “How am I back here?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“How would I know? This is your dream. I suppose you just wanted to see me again,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Hermione can’t come up with anything clever to say in response. She’s exhausted, even in her sleep. She stumbles forward a step, reaching towards the trunk to steady herself. Bella is before her in an instant, grasping at her forearms. She brushes a lock out of Hermione’s face with a concerned expression.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“What’s the matter, darling?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>She’s too exhausted to pull away. She doesn’t want to, even if it’s strange. Bella has this magnetic pull to her; the smell of her and the warmth of her skin draws her in and she doesn’t see a reason to fight off her desires when she’s dreaming them up.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“My friend’s brother was killed. Horrifically. I’ve spent the night comforting Ron and Ginny, two of his siblings. I’m just so tired. Why am I tired if I’m dreaming?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Bella pulls her so her cheek is lying flat against her bosom. Hermione’s cheeks grow hot but she doesn’t fight it, she only melts into her. Bella shushes her and runs her nails across her scalp soothingly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Come lay with me, sweetling, and tell me your troubles,” Bella tugs her down and she curls against her. In her dreams the ground is more forgiving than is should’ve been and the grass is soft, tickling her skin in the cool breeze.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Hermione tells her about her day, beginning with the raven and ending with the details of Bill’s death. Bella continues to stroke her hair while she talks, until all her troubles melt away.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Do you think the raven was a bad omen?” Hermione asks. She tugs at a loose thread on Bella’s dress, a flaw in her perfect image. The thread pulls loose, marring the repeating design.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“No. Ravens represent prophesy. Perhaps your lifelong destiny is about to come to pass,”</p><p>“‘I don’t believe in destiny,” Hermione says, rolling away from her companion and onto her back. The sun has set again, and the stars shimmer above them. Bella leans over her, blocking Hermione’s view of the heavens. She doesn’t mind, Bella’s glimmering eyes are far brighter than any star.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Don’t you believe in a higher power? God?” Bella brings a hand to her chest, poking at the golden cross that hangs there.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“I only believe in free will. The cross was my grandmother’s, and it’s a requirement of the school uniform to wear one. As for God, I have a hard time believing in anything I can’t see with my own eyes,”</p><p>Bella smiles, a long strand of curly hair falling over her shoulder and tickling Hermione’s face, “So you believe in me?”</p><p>Hermione can’t find the smile creeping onto her face. Bella’s good mood is contagious. “I believe I must have a very vivid imagination to dream someone like you up,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Bella hums, “And what if I tell you I’m real?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Well, then you’d have to prove it. Why haven’t you found me in real life?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Bella leans down, ghosting her lips across Hermione’s cheek, “You wouldn’t like me in real life,” she whispers.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Hermione sighs, “I like you here, how different can it be? I don’t know why I’m arguing with you when you’re not even real,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Bella pulls back and gives her another pout, “That’s rude,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Hermione laughs and lopes her arms around Bella’s neck, pulling her into a hug. Bella’s fingers dance up her ribs and Hermione yelps and wriggles against her. She ceases abruptly, pressing against her hips and holding her still,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Our time is almost up,” Bella says sadly, “I’ll see you tomorrow,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Hermione opens her mouth to protest, but the blaring of her alarm yanks her from Bella’s arms.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>A week passes and no news comes of Bill’s death. They don’t know what animal did it or why, but now Cedric walks her home from her shifts every night and hardly anyone is out alone past sundown. Words like <em>vampire </em>and <em>werewolf </em>are being tossed around, but there’s no stock in it. For now it’s just a mystery, and thankfully an isolated incident.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Without Ginny to study with, Hermione’s been spending a lot of time in the library. She hasn’t been getting a lot of sleep after her late shifts, but with all the unrest in her life she finds it hard to relax. The time she does spend sleeping always includes Bella. The etherial woman is always content to listen to Hermione’s every thought as long as she lets her cuddle up with her. Hermione doesn’t mind. The woman is a better listener than anyone she’s ever met. And it doesn’t hurt that she’s devastatingly beautiful.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>It makes it easier to open up. She tells her about her parents, how she’s working so hard so she can help them afford her school along with their mortgage. She talks about her feet hurting after walking to and from work following a long day of tedious walks from dorm to class to more class. Every trivial thing about her life Bella listens to with rapt interest. There’s nothing she’s said that she felt bored her. She stares at her with this wide, unblinking gaze like there is no detail about Hermione that’s not worth knowing.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Bella, however, shuts down completely if Hermione asks her anything about herself. She hasn’t learned anything about her, though she supposes since these are her dreams maybe she doesn’t have the depth of imagination to conjure a backstory.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Her uneventful week comes to end on Thursday morning. She’s at the library early, like she’s been doing often lately and it’s deserted, which is exactly how she prefers it. The librarian gives her a tired smile, she herself having only arrived minutes before. Hermione finds a spot towards the back, secluded by rows of shelves. </p><p>She's immersed in her first draft of an English essay when she hears a rustling across from her. She looks up to see Professor Lockhart unpacking his briefcase directly in front of her. She fights off the irritation at being disturbed while in an empty library and forces a polite smile. </p><p>"Hello, Professor. I'm working on your essay now," </p><p> "The midterm essay, really? You're quite early on that, Miss Granger," </p><p>"Yes, I like to get a head start on these things so I have extra time to edit a final draft," </p><p>"Very wise of you. Which of my novels did you choose to write your paper on?" </p><p>"<em>Magical Me, </em>sir," She says shortly, her patience running thin at the prolonged interruption. </p><p>"Is that so?" He exclaims, his volume harsh in the quiet of the library. </p><p>Hermione nods, returning to writing and hoping he'll take the hint. He doesn't. </p><p>"That's one of my favorites. How's it coming along?" He rounds the table to look over her shoulder, the sent of his cologne making her stomach roll. </p><p>She clears her throat, "Fine," </p><p>A heavy, warm hand clasps her shoulder and Lockhart leans down, his coffee-breath washing over her face, "You know, since you're going to be finished early you can always stop by my classroom after hours and we can go over it together. I know how...committed you are to having the perfect marks," </p><p>His hand slides down her shoulder to caress her arm. A tapping at the window snaps Hermione out of her shock and she jerks away from him like she's been burned. She nearly falls out of her seat in her attempt to get away from him as fast as she can. His hand drops to his side and he gives her a confused look as if he has no idea what he did wrong. She stumbles over a chair as she's backing away from him, snatching her things away from him and shoving them back in her bag. She shoots a glance at the window and sees a raven-<em>the </em>raven, tapping its beak against the class and fluffing up it's feathers like it's angry. It opens its mouth and she can hear its upset squawks even through the thick glass. </p><p>"Have I done something to offend you?" </p><p>Hermione's face is hot and she's so angry as she scrambles for something to say. He hasn't done anything-not <em>really, </em>but she feels violated and viscerally uncomfortable all the same. It was the <em>way </em>he said it, the suggestive lowering of his voice that sent all her defenses flying up.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>"I don't need any help, is all," she forces out. </p><p>She can't stand the mystified look on his face any longer. She flees from the library, ignoring the concerned look on the librarians face. She doesn't have enough time to go back to her dorm before class so she heads to History instead, arriving 20 minutes early and curling up outside the room. </p><p>Her skin crawls where he touched her for the rest of the day. The man has always made her uncomfortable but she's managed to never be completely alone with him before. The previous year there was a rumor going around that he became involved with a student but so many of the girls have crushes on him that everyone thought it was one of them spreading wishful thinking like it was fact. </p><p>She hates him. She hates that she can't report him without sounding like one of his fan girls. He did just enough to be able to plausibly deny it if she repeats it to anyone, but he certainly made his desires clear enough to her. It makes her sick to imagine that man looking at her or anyone at the school like that. </p><p>She puts it out of her mind when the first bell rings, electing to sort out her feelings later. Last night proved to be especially cathartic, confiding in someone so willing to listen. Bella promised she would be back the next night again if Hermione wanted, and she does, she really does. </p><p>Ginny and Ron are back in class that day after their week at home. It doesn’t feel like enough time, but Ginny insists she needs things to go back to normal.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It's comforting to know they'll all be together again. The four of them are like a family of their own, and Hermione is ready to be there for them in any way she can. She’s never known what it’s like to have a sibling until she found friends at Hogwarts, and now she feels like she’s gained a second, bigger family.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>She falls asleep fast, and when she starts dreaming she's surprised to find herself in a hallway instead of a forest. </p><p>It's a hallway at Hogwarts. The school is empty and silent, all the lights off except one classroom up ahead. She follows the light and she sees it's her English classroom. This dream is different than the ones she’s been having. She feels less in control, like she's moving against her will. She wants control, she wants her willow tree. </p><p>She wants Bella. </p><p>She walks through the door and Gidory Lockhart is sitting at his desk, proofreading papers. She wants to get out of there but she finds herself rooted to the spot. He looks up, his face twisting into a malicious grin. He jumps out of his chair and darts towards her. </p><p>"Granger, I'm so glad you decided to take me up on my offer! I knew my instincts were right about you," </p><p>He shuts the door behind her and puts his hands on her shoulders, "I knew you were the kind of student willing to do whatever it takes to get a good grade," </p><p>He leans down, shutting his eyes. Finally, the invisible weight trapping her in place is lifted and she struggles against him. His hands are like iron on her and she can't escape, feeling too weak to put up a good enough fight. She feels his stubble on her cheek and she twists and screams. </p><p>"Whats the matter? You wouldn't have come here if you didn't want this," He husks, his breath hot on her face. His grip on her is painful now and she twists uselessly in his arms. </p><p>He twirls her around and crushes her against him, pressed completely against her back. She shuts her eyes, reminding herself this isn't real and that she can wake up if she wants to. </p><p>"You can't get away from me that easy," </p><p>She screams again and he puts a clammy hand over her mouth, muffling the sound. Why isn't she waking up? </p><p>Lockhart grunts and his weight disappears from her. She collapses forward, tripping on her feet and hitting the ground, her elbow slamming against the floor to break her fall. Lockhart screams and she whirls around to see Bella, her Bella, kneeling over the professor and stabbing something repeatedly into his neck. <em>A pencil, </em>she realizes. </p><p>When he stops moving, Bella turns and crawls towards her, the professors blood marring the white of her dress. Hermione scrambles away, fear and confusion making her stomach churn. Bella looks…different. Not like her Bella. She looks threatening, menacing.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Her back hits the closed door and Bella reaches her, pulling her into her arms and holding her agains her, Professor Lockhart’s blood soaking into her skin. Bella shushes her and pets her head with a bloody hand.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“I’ve got you now. Everything is okay,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>The world falls away, melts and spins around her and when she finds solid ground she’s back under the willow tree. She’s dry and Bella’s dress is clean. The woman is glowing again, vibrant and beautiful in the sun. Hermione’s racing heart slows and Bella nuzzles against her.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“You’re safe,” Bella murmurs.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Hermione pulls away from her and Bella lets her scoot away.</p><p>“What was that? How…how are we back here?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Bella sits back on her heels and looks at her beneath heavy eyelids. The sun casts the shadow of her lashes across her cheeks as she watches her, chest heaving with adrenaline. “You were having a nightmare. You were <em>early,”</em></p><p>“How did you stop it? <em>How </em>are you able to pull me from a nightmare and bring me here?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Bella shakes her head theatrically, her curls tossing from side to side, “You’re doing this, not me. You said it yourself, didn’t you? <em>I’m not real,”</em></p><p>Now that Bella’s saying it, Hermione doesn’t believe her. It doesn’t make sense, she’s never done this before, she’s never been able to control her dreams or force a reoccurring location. She’s never imagined and met up with someone on multiple occasions. It has to be Bella. Everything must be connected to her. It all started with <em>her; </em>the strange bird, Bill’s death.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Bella moves towards her and cups her face, “It doesn’t matter. What matters is that man will never lay a finger on you again. I will take care of him for you,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>She wraps Hermione in her arms again and they melt against one another. Hermione’s heart pounds, and something in the back of her mind bristles, warning her.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Professor Lockhart is not in class the following day. </p><p>She and the rest of the class sit and wait for him, only for the minutes to tick by more and more without him showing up. Bella’s words echo in her mind. She’s a dream, she’s only a dream. She can’t have done anything.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>The intercom beeps, and Headmaster Dumbledore’s voice fills the room.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“There will be an assembly in the theater in 15 minutes, if you will all be so kind as to join me.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Do not be alarmed as this is not an emergency, though it is urgent. Teachers, please lead your classes to the theater immediately,” There’s a pause, and then, “Miss Granger, you will be leading Professor Lockhart’s class, please,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Hermione pushes her worries to the side and snaps into action. Her peers roll their eyes when she orders them into a single-file line and does a headcount before allowing them to leave the room. The theater is on the far side of the school, so by the time they get there it’s nearly full.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Meet back at the classroom once it’s over, all of you!” She calls to the class as they disperse to find any empty spots.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Harry waves Hermione over from his spot towards the front, and she takes the unoccupied seat next to him. Before she can ask him if he knows what’s going on, the lights flicker, signaling for everyone to quiet down. A hush falls over the auditorium when the headmaster walks onto the stage and situates himself in front of the ornate golden owl podium. He clears his throat and taps the microphone.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Thank you all for getting here in a timely manor. I’m afraid I’ve received terrible news about one of our faculty that I felt ought to be shared with you all immediately,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Hermione feels a heat crawling up her chest and sweat begins to form at her forehead. <em>It’s not possible. It can’t be possible.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em></p><p>“Now, not all the details have been released yet but our own Professor Lockhart has been taken to St. Mungos after suffering a sudden psychotic break from reality,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Everyone starts talking at once except Hermione, who’s frozen with shock. She feels Harry looking at her, distantly hears him saying something but it feels like she’s trapped underwater. Dumbledore’s voice booms, silencing them all.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Quiet! All that I know is he woke from sleep different than the day before. There were no warning signs leading to this, but for now he must be committed for his safety and the safety of others. We at Hogwarts are wishing him a speedy recovery but for now it is unknown when or if he will recover. Professor McGonagall will be taking over his duties as English Professor,”</p><p><em>In his sleep, </em>Hermione thinks, the world spinning.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“I thought it best you all hear it from me. I know he is a greatly admired instructor here, and he will be missed for however long he is gone. You are dismissed,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Hermione stands with everyone else, but she feels unsteady on her feet. She feels lethargic, and everything swirls around her when she takes a step. Harry is at her side, grasping her forearm and saying something that sounds very far away. She tries to take another step but darkness shrouds her vision and she collapses.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Hermione,” A silky voice says, “Hermione, it’s okay. You’re safe now,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p><em>Bella</em>?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Hermione struggles, pulling away from the arms that hold her. Bella is <em>bad, </em>she thinks. Bella can drive her insane if she wants.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“No one will ever hurt you. I will always be here to protect you,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>She feels Bella’s warm hands sliding up her bare arms, then caressing her face. Hermione jerks her head away.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Do not be afraid, darling. I’ll never hurt you,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>
  <em>Do not be afraid.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em>
</p><p>Bella has said the words before, but this time it elicits a memory. The stranger on the second floor of Flourish and Blotts that night. The woman held up her hands and said in that same melodious voice <em>do not be afraid</em>.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>The realization washes over her like icy water and she shivers. The presence of that person was so utterly different than the way Bella comes off in her dreams, though now it seems Bella has been the one manipulating her dreams all along. The <em>real </em>Bella was terrifying, something inside of her had wanted to get away as fast as possible, some survival instinct that told her to run.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p><em>You wouldn’t like me in real life, </em>Bella said before. Now it all makes sense. Whatever Bella is, she isn’t all human if she’s able to walk in people’s dreams like this. She has to get away, <em>now.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em></p><p>“No,” Bella hisses, her demeanor twisting into something darker, “You’re mine,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Hermione jerks awake. She sits up, her head spinning still and sees she’s in the infirmary. Nurse Pomfrey is bustling around her and she presses the back of her hand to her forehead.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“You gave us all quite a fright, Miss Granger,” she says, sticking a thermometer in her ear.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Hermione takes a deep breath and waits for her heart rate to return to normal. Harry pokes his head around the corner, a glass of ice water in his hand. He sighs in relief when he sees her sitting up.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Blimey, Hermione, you scared the hell out of me,” He passes her the water and she gulps it down.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Pomfrey touches her head with an icepack and she jumps in surprise at the pain. “You hit your head on a chair on your way down so you’ll have quite a bump. Stay up for the next 24 hours in case you have a concussion. Now follow my finger with your eyes please,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Harry rubs her shoulders while Pomfrey shines a light into her eyes. Her head is <em>throbbing,</em> so she takes the ice pack from the nurse so she can press it firmly against the forming bruise.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“You seem alright, but I’ll send you back with some extra strength Tylenol since you’ve got quite the bump forming there. No more than two every four hours, alright dear?” Hermione nods, “Good. No class for the rest of the day and take tomorrow off too to catch up on sleep after your 24 hours,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Do you need to rest here more or are you ready to go back to your dorm?” Harry asks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“I’m ready,” she responds, standing up. The world isn’t spinning anymore, but she feels sick to her stomach.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Harry helps her back to her room and Ginny is there waiting for her. She crushes Hermione in a hug the second she walks through the door, telling her how worried she was. She assures Harry she’ll take good care of her, and the two of them spend the rest of the day in bed watching movies. Cedric texts her that he heard what happened and not to worry about her shift that night.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Ginny vows to stay up with her but falls asleep by midnight. Hermione gets up and spends the rest of the night lost on the internet, researching creatures that can enter people’s dreams. After she gets passed the results about Freddy Kruger she gets into the really old myths. She finds a bit from shamanic legends to Native American healing rituals but she can’t find anything about people using it with malicious intentions.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>After a frustrating, fruitless three hours of internet searching, she elects to spend the rest of the night wandering around campus. It’s eerie at night, like a completely different world from what it is during the day.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>She leaves the castle-like walls of the school to make her way to the edge of the forest that sprawls on the outskirts of the campus. There’s rumors that students who have wandered too far in that forest disappeared without a trace, and that’s why the school banned anyone else from going in there. She wonders if beings like Bella are snatching people up. Maybe that’s where she is, right now.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>She shivers at the thought. As soon as the thought enters her head her hair stands on end. It feels like something out there is watching her stare into the darkness. She can imagine Bella stepping out of the sinister woods, barefoot and grinning, reaching for her. She would scream and flee but Bella would catch her.</p><p>Hermione shakes herself out of it and decides it might be a better idea to spend the next few hours binge watching documentaries instead.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Ron visits her the next morning before classes start. She's had 3 cups of coffee to get through the night and her hair is still wet from the cold shower she took when he knocks. He's still in the fog he's been in since Bill died, but he looks well rested if not a little disheveled in his wrinkled uniform. </p><p>She makes them both coffee, his first of the day and her fourth, and he sits uncharacteristically stiff in her desk chair when she perches on the edge of her bed to face him. </p><p>"Is everything alright?" She asks. </p><p>he takes a short sip of coffee and winces at the heat. "Um, yeah, I've just been thinking a lot since Bill...you know..." </p><p>Hermione nods, trying to focus her tired mind on the importance of what he's trying to say. </p><p>She rarely sees him this serious. </p><p>He clears his throat, "Well, it made me realize that life is short, and anything can happen to make it even shorter. I felt like I needed to tell you how I feel. Bill always teased me about it and I know he'd want...he'd want me to tell you," </p><p>His face is turning red and Hermione's is too once she realizes what he's telling her. </p><p>"I've had the biggest crush on you since we met," He continues, talking fast now, "I was an ass at first because of it, but I realized how great you are and how much I love being around you. And I am so lucky to have you as a friend, and if that's the way you want it then...that's great but..."</p><p>He moves from the couch to the bed so he's sitting next to her, and he takes one of her hands in his own. Hermione blinks at him, trying to process. Before she can, he's talking again. </p><p>"Would you want to go out tonight, once you've had a chance to rest?" </p><p>"Oh, Ron, um..." Hermione cannot process this when she's this tired. She squeezes his hand, then runs her free hand through her wet hair. Ron is one of her favorite people in the world, and they've been there for each other through so much. It almost feels like this is the obvious next step for them. </p><p>"Okay," she says at last. </p><p>Rons eyes bulge, "Wait, really?" </p><p>Hermione nods, a small smile on her face. He surges forward and kisses her clumsily on the cheek and pulls back, beaming. She walks him out, hugging him before he goes and then collapsing on her bed, exhausted. She's not sure how to feel until after she sleeps. In two hours it will have been 24 hours since she collapsed and she's fairly certain she doesn't have a concussion anyway. Regardless, after her realization about Bella she's too afraid to fall asleep. She's scared Bella will know she knows the second she sees her, and then what? If Bella knows she's afraid of her, that she knows she's real, what will she do? If her suspicions are true, then Bella can drive someone insane in their sleep. If she's capable of that, can she kill people in their sleep? </p><p>She needs more time to sort out what she's going to do. She needs to do something to occupy herself until she has Ron to distract her tonight. And then...she doesn’t know. She can't stay awake forever. Eventually there will be some confrontation, though she hopes there's some logical explanation behind it all. For now, she just needs time. </p><p>As if on cue, there's another knock at her door. The Headmaster is standing on the other side with a kind smile. </p><p>"How are you feeling, Miss Granger?" He asks. </p><p>Hermione glances nervously at the cramped messy room behind her, "Um, much better. Just a little tired. Sorry, would you like to come in, sir? It's very messy. I wasn't expecting-” </p><p>"No, no, we can walk to the courtyard if you'd like? What I have to tell you won't take long," </p><p>Hermione agrees and pulls on a her Hogwarts Debate Team sweatshirt, following him out of the building. She squints at the brightness of the sun once they're outside as they walk over to a stone bench where they can see the lake through the trees. </p><p>They sit in silence for a moment, Dumbledore seeming content to just look out at the trees swaying in the breeze. </p><p>"What was it you wanted to speak with me about, sir?" Hermione asks. </p><p>"I have some wonderful, if not a bit odd, news for you," he says, turning to look at her, "An anonymous donor has paid off your loans to this school, as well as any future tuition for this year,"  </p><p>The breath leaves her at once, and she stares at him like she's waiting for the punchline. A dozen questions rush to her mind at once, and it takes her a moment to pick one. </p><p>"Wait, someone did it <em>just </em>for me? No one else?" </p><p>"That is correct," </p><p>"Why...I mean was it random? Why just me?" </p><p>"That I don't know. Someone called and asked to pay for you specifically, and for us to consider it a donation," he explains. </p><p>Hermione absorbs this, then has a terrible thought, "Was it a man or a woman?" </p><p>Dumbledore seems to debate with himself on if he should divulge the information, but when he sees the worried look on her face he caves, "A woman," </p><p>All she can do is nod slowly. She returns her eyes to the lake and if she shuts her eyes she can just barely hear the water lapping at the shore in the wind. For a second it's like she's at their spot by the stream, only she doesn't feel safe anymore. </p><p>"Is there anything I should be aware of, Miss Granger?" </p><p>She opens her eyes, the illusion shattered, and says, "No, sir," </p><p>A vibrating in her pocket makes her jump. <em>Home </em>appears on her screen. </p><p>"I'm sorry sir, is it alright if I take this? It's my parents," </p><p>"That's quite all right. Do tell them hello for me and tell them the good news," </p><p>He leaves her on the bench and she answers. </p><p>"Sweetheart, I'm calling with some good news!" </p><p>Her stomach sinks and the bump on her head is throbbing with the pounding of her heart. She swallows, "What is it, dad?" </p><p>"You can quit that job of yours. We don't have to worry about our mortgage anymore, so it's going to be much easier to afford your school from here on out," he says, and she can hear her mom saying something in the background, "Your mother says hello and that she loves you," </p><p>Tears prick at the corners of her eyes. She's shaking her head, a dreadful feeling clawing from her stomach into her chest, "Tell mom I love her too. Let me guess, an anonymous donation paid for the house?" </p><p>Her father laughs joyously, "How'd you know?" </p><p>"Just a guess," she hesitates before saying, "Dad, I've just got the news that I qualify for a scholarship and it's going to cover the rest of my loans and the rest of this years tuition," </p><p>She says it mechanically, unable to force an ounce of saccharine happiness into the words. She doesn't want to freak them out by telling them the whole truth. A good Samaritan paying off one debt is a miracle, someone paying off two major debts is too good to be true. </p><p>Her father is stunned silent. After a moment, she hears him repeat it to her mother with an awestruck tone. </p><p>"That's amazing news, hon. Someone must be watching over you," </p><p>Hermione lets out a strangled laugh, "Yes, dad, it's beginning to feel that way," </p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Hermione is pretty sure the raven is following her and Ron. She feels guilty for how quiet she's been despite how hard Ron is obviously trying to get her out of her funk. They went for drinks at the Drunken Huntsman and he's walking her back to the school when the raven swoops over them, too close for comfort. It misses Ron's head by an inch, making him duck and stumble before righting himself and glaring. </p><p>"Bloody birds," he mumbles. </p><p>Hermione frowns at the raven too, and it squawks and fluffs it's feathers like it's trying to intimidate them.  </p><p>"Come on," she says, tugging him along faster. The raven bounces from tree to tree as they walk and Hermione starts avoiding eye contact. </p><p>"Maybe we should throw something at it. Y'know, scare it off," </p><p>"No!" Hermione gasps. </p><p>Ron rolls his eyes, "C'mon, I don't want to <em>hit </em>it, just scare it," </p><p>"You'll only make it mad," she whispers, like she's afraid it will hear her. And who knows, maybe it can understand her. Suddenly there's nothing that seems very out of the realm of reality anymore.  </p><p>They make it back safely. The raven watches them go inside from the tree closest to the building, and she could swear it's glaring. </p><p>They both visibly relax once they're safe inside his dorm. He shares it with Harry, who's conveniently absent. The second Ron realizes they're alone in his room, he gets nervous again for a very different reason. </p><p>Hermione takes off her coat and holds it, trying to find a convenient place to put it. Ron notices and flushes. </p><p>"Oh, sorry, I'll take that for you,"  </p><p>He tosses both their coats on the desk chair. and plops onto the bed, patting the spot next to him with a little smile. She takes the spot next to him, putting her head on his shoulder. Her eyes drift shut and the gravity of how tired she is hits her. Her head spins and she nearly falls asleep on the spot until Ron clears his throat. </p><p>"Is it alright if I...um..." </p><p>She lifts her head to look at him and it's obvious what he's asking. Maybe she's deliriously tired or maybe she just wants to forget about Bella for a while, but she finds herself leaning forward. She has a moment to appreciate the surprised look on Ron's face before she brushes her lips against his. </p><p>It starts out chaste, but then Ron cups the back of her head and tilts his own, deepening the kiss with a smoothness she didn't think him capable of. She runs a hand across his jaw, his stubble scraping across the palm of her hand, and threads a hand through his hair. His hand squeezes her thigh and she swings it around his waist, straddling him. He sucks in a sharp, surprised breath and she smiles at the reaction.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Ron moves his attention to her neck, giving her hot, open mouthed kisses. It’s sloppy but it feels good and she grinds gently down into him. She feels pent up, like she’s only just noticing something inside her that’s been dying to come out. And she feels safe and comfortable with Ron. She knows he won’t reject her, she knows she can work out her frustrations and desires with him without consequence.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>The door bangs open and she jumps up so fast that she thinks she’s going to faint again for a second. Ron scoots back on the bed and grabs a pillow, hurriedly covering his lap.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Bloody hell, Harry, I thought I told you to stay out late,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>The embarrassment mixed with disbelief on Harry’s face would’ve been hilarious any other time. Hermione tugs her coat back on and tosses a goodbye to Ron over her shoulder, shoving Harry’s shoulder on her way out.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Awe, wait, ‘Mione, I can go!” Harry calls after her.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“You’ve ruined the mood!” She says, already halfway down the hallway.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>The cool night air feels perfect on her hot face as she makes her way back to the girls dormitories. The raven is nowhere to be found, to her immense relief, but the feeling of being watched doesn’t subside.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>She can’t stay awake any longer. Ginny’s already asleep so the place is dark and quiet and the second her head hits the pillow she’s out like a light. Too tired to be afraid, all she can feel is relief as her eyes fall shut and she slips into unconsciousness.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>She’s by the willow tree again, and the relief quickly gives way to dread. There is no golden sunshine, only a dark twilight and moonlight shrouded by heavy clouds. She spins around, but Bella is nowhere to be seen. Yet she <em>knows </em>she’s here, because they are always here together.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Where are you?” Hermione calls, her voice trembling.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>It’s so quiet. There’s no sound outside of her own breathing; no birds, no insects, no breeze. Not even the water from the stream dares make a sound. It’s as if the whole world is holding its breath.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Boo,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Hermione whirls around and shrieks when she sees Bella standing directly behind her. She looks as beautiful and innocent as ever, all in white with her loose curls and charming smile. Only now she knows it’s a lie.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Oh no,” Bella pouts, “You’re afraid of me now,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“How could I not be?” She feels like her feet are sinking in the earth beneath her, as if the soil is wet and it wants to draw her in.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>With a single little skip, Bella jumps into motion and begins circling her with the grace of a predator. Hermione tries to lift her feet, but finds them rooted to the ground. Bella is moving around her with a smirk, like she’s taunting Hermione for being stuck.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“I haven’t done anything bad,” she stops, and places a finger on the center of Hermione’s chest, “Not to you,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“No, you’ve only been stalking me, manipulating me, <em>buying </em>me,” Hermione spits, glaring at the woman with every ounce of venom she can muster.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>A muscle in Bella’s jaw twitches and her eyes grow darker, a glimpse at her true nature. Then it’s gone, replaced with a serene smile, “I’m only helping you,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“<em>Why?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em></p><p>
  <em>What have I done to deserve this? To deserve you?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em>
</p><p>Bella’s brow twitches as if to say, <em>well, isn’t it obvious?</em> “Because you’re mine,” she says simply.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“I don’t belong to anyone, Bella, least of all you,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Bella doesn’t like that. The dark expression is back, her mouth twisting into a sneer. She grabs Hermione by the hair and moves forward so she envelops her vision. All she can see is pristine moonlight and cascading darkness. She can smell her again; pine and roses.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“You’ve been promised to me since before you were born. I’m tired of waiting,”</p><p>She moves closer, until her mouth is sliding across her neck. The action sends shocks straight to her core, and her hips twitch into the woman. Bella clutches them and holds them against her own.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Bella, no,” Hermione whispers, “I don’t want you,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Bella nips at her and she gasps. Her hips jerk again and Bella hums into her ear, “I can hear your heart. You can’t lie to me, darling. I know you want me,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Hermione lifts her heavy arms and pushes weakly at her. Bella steps away to glare at her like a petulant child.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Why are you fighting me?” She snaps.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“You’re <em>evil. </em>I can feel it,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Bella lifts her chin and purses her full red lips, “That’s the only way to survive in this world. Nothing can harm you if you’re the thing that goes bump in the night,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>The statement is the closest Bella has come to revealing anything personal about herself. She’s protecting herself from something, it seems.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“What are you afraid of?” Hermione asks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“I’m not afraid of anything,” She circles Hermione again, stopping behind her to slide a hand around her waist. Her other hand threads through her hair and pulls her head back so she’s looking at the stars above them. She can’t make out any constellations in this strange world, but Bella’s mouth is at her throat again and nothing else matters.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“What is your obsession with my neck?” Hermione wonders aloud.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Bella chuckles and sucks a bruise into the spot where her neck curves into her shoulder, “You’re afraid of me but you haven’t figured out what I am yet? Oh, dear,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>More questions fly to her mind but they abandon her when Bella licks a path up to her earlobe which she nibbles, her warm breath panting into her ear. The hand on her stomach slides lower, her fingers dipping below the waistband of her pants.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>A tremor wracks her body but still she tries to jerk away, “Please don’t,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Bella groans, annoyed, and ceases her descent, “Fine. But I will have you. And you will beg for it,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>When Hermione wakes, it’s still dark outside. She’s panting for air, her body aching for Bella’s hands. She shuts her eyes and her own hands find Bella’s destination. She tugs the blanket over her face to stifle the moans and she works herself over the edge in minutes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Ron doesn’t look at her all day, in any of the classes they spend together. She hopes he’s just embarrassed at being caught together, but she suspects there’s something more to it. She manages to corner him after Snape’s exhausting chemistry lecture, yanking him by the arm and shoving him against the lockers. His eyes are wide and darting around like he’s afraid someone will see them talking.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“What the hell, Ron?” She hisses.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>He gulps, Adam’s apple bobbing, and looks at his feet, “What?” He mumbles.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“What do you mean, what? What can’t you look at me?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>He shifts his weight from one foot to the other, moving his eyes to stare past her head, “Look, Hermione, maybe that was…a mistake. I don’t want to ruin our friendship,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>She drops her hand back to her side and steps away from him. “What are you talking about? <em>You </em>asked me out. You were so happy…”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Her brow furrows and Ron rubs the scruff at his jaw with his hand. He meets her eyes for a moment and his gaze is filled with guilt and…fear?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Ron, what’s the matter? What happened?” She steps into his space and touches his cheek.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>He jerks away from her so fast his head smacks agains the locker behind him. He looks around again, and he’s definitely terrified. “Nothing’s happened, ‘Mione. I just can’t be with you like that, okay?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>He shoves past her and speed-walks down the hallway without sparing her a glance. She narrows her eyes suspiciously at his back. If Bella was behind Lockhart, she has to be behind this as well. <em>You’re mine, </em>she said.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>She doesn’t have time to dwell on this. She has a debate against another school this evening and she promised the team she’d meet up with them in the theater an hour before it begins to go over everything.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>She’s the last to arrive, Draco, Luna and Neville are there waiting for her. The tables have already been set up on stage, and her team has their notes strewn about. Draco stands when he sees her enter, and before she reaches them he meets her halfway across the room. He grasps her elbow and lowers his head so only she can hear his words.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“I have to tell you something,” he whispers, “I know you’ve met her. Bella. You have to stay away from her,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Hermione’s eyes widen and she searches Draco’s for more information, “How? She shows up in my dreams,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>His eyes flick behind her, similarly to how Ron’s had, “I…I don’t know, but just…be careful. Don’t believe anything she says,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“How do you know about her, Draco?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>He’s pulling away, shaking his head, but she needs answers. She grabs his hand, “Draco, please. You’re the only other person who knows she’s real. I feel like I’m going crazy,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Look,” he hisses, “I can’t tell you too much or she’ll know. I just had to warn you..you’re innocent, you don’t deserve what she’ll do to you. That’s all I can say, okay?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>He spins on his heel, walking back up the isle and onto the stage. She follows him and tries to put the conversation out of her mind. Real or not, she won’t let Bella interfere with her life like this. Her team has won every debate since she joined the team two years ago, and she’s not going to let that reign end tonight.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>It’s an easy enough topic. Hogwarts is arguing against the death penalty and Durmstrang is arguing in favor of it. Hermione has been working on the closing argument for the last week and a half during her down time at work. Draco always comes through on the opening, and Neville and Luna are surprisingly well spoken on stage after enough rehearsal. The win is obvious even before it’s announced.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>She goes straight to work after the victory after Draco leaves in a hurry, making it obvious he has no intention of giving her any more information. She refuses to let Bella’s money change her life. She’ll keep her job until she can find her way out of this mess.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>She’s working a closing shift since she’s coming in later than usual after the debate. Cedric has the night off for once, so it’s just one of the older guys she hardly knows working the bar. It’s one of the nights she wishes was busier so she could distract herself, but it seems to drag on endlessly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>A couple hours before her shift ends, the boys from the Durmstrang team come in. She keeps an eye on them but they don’t seem to notice her. The make a beeline for the bar and order a round of shots.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>She doubts all of them are 18, but they’re all sporting facial hair to varying degrees and they’re quite large so it’s not surprising the bartender doesn’t bother checking their ID’s. The four of them are loud, disruptive to the typically laid back vibe of the place. She has to bite her tongue to keep from saying anything, figuring confronting four guys twice her size that she just beat in a debate wouldn’t be the wisest decision.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>She checks her phone to see if Ron responded to any of her earlier texts. He hasn’t and her phone battery is at 2% after her long day. She sighs, and when she glances up she sees one of the boys looking right at her. When she meets his eyes, he nudges his buddy and then the four of them are glancing in her direction.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>She lowers her gaze back to her book and ignores them. To her relief, they don’t bother her for the last hour. Though they certainly consume their weight in alcohol, growing more obnoxious in the span of the hour. She closes the register and gives her coworker a little wave so he knows she’s leaving for the night.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Then, she’s out in the cool air and breathing it in deeply. The day is finally over. She walks home on aching feet, sticking close to the streetlights like she usually does. Maybe if she wasn’t so exhausted she would’ve heard them behind her. Maybe she would’ve had a chance.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Hey, Hermione right?” A voice says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>She whirls around to see two of the boys standing right behind her. Her heart starts racing, and she’s afraid and she’s <em>sick </em>of being afraid. Isn’t it enough that some mysterious supernatural entity is after her?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Yeah…Edward, right? And…hello, John,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>She straightens her posture and raises her chin. She won’t let them know they’re scaring her. She feels for the pocketknife she carries with her to and from work, and grasps it hard enough in her pocket to hurt.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“We just wanted to congratulate you on your win today,” Edward says, “Why didn’t you join us for a drink back there?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“I was working,” she says. John takes a step closer, and she instinctively steps back only to bump into something. She whirls around, and the other two guys are behind her. Shit. She looks around but it’s two in the morning and the streets are deserted.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Why don’t you come back to our hotel with us and we’ll have that celebratory drink? It’s kind of a tradition of ours to have a drink with our competitors once it’s all over,” The boy says. This one’s name she can’t quite remember. It’s something generic, something with an R.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Her stomach is churning, her brain is racing trying to figure out what to do. The second one of them grabs her, she’s going to fight like hell. Right now, she can’t bring herself to make that first move.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Oh!” He says loudly, making her jump, “How rude of me. My name’s Richard, and this is Bo,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Richard holds out her hand. She knows nothing good will come of taking it. She just holds eye contact with him instead, praying they’ll get the hint and back down.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“C’mon, don’t be rude, Hermione,” Bo says. Was he getting closer? “Come back with us,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>She’s had enough. She pulls out her knife and pops it open, pointing it at Richard, the one closest to her, “None of you come any closer,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Edward laughs, his voice much closer behind her now. She spins back around to face him and he holds his hands up.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Woah, woah, woah, lets calm down, alright?” Edward says, and she can smell the bourbon on his breath.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>She screams when arms encircle her from behind. Richard is laughing in her ear, until she twists her arm and stabs him in the forearm. He yells, releasing her, and she yanks her knife free and runs as fast as she can.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>She only makes it about five steps before Bo tackles her.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Her head smacks against the stone ground and her ankle twists painfully as Bo forces himself on top of her, pinning her down. She screams as loud as she can until he covers her mouth with his hand. She tries to stab him, too, but he grabs her wrist and slams it against the ground, again and again until she can’t hold onto it anymore.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>She bites his hand, and the second he lets her go she screams again, only this time she screams <em>for someone.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em></p><p>
  <em>“Bella! Bella! Help me!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em>
</p><p>“Who the fuck is Bella?” John asks, looming over her. They’re all around her now, there’s no way she’ll get away.</p><p>“You bitch,” Richard says, “She fucking stabbed me,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“She bit me,” Bo growls, pressing his forearm into her throat. She can’t speak, can’t breathe, and she can’t die with this man’s flushed, angry face staring down at her as the last thing she sees.</p><p>Then, before she can understand what’s happening, two pale hands cup Bo’s face and <em>twist. </em>His neck breaks with a sickening crack, and he collapses on Hermione.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Everything happens very fast after that. The boys take off in different directions, but a dark shape moves so fast that none of them stand a chance at escaping. First, the silhouette rushes at John. Hermione hears a scream as the man is twisted at the waist, almost all the way around until his spine cracks. Hermione shoves Bo’s body off of her and crawls to the brick building closest to her. She wraps her arms around her legs and watches the figure zip to Richard. His head is craned back and the dark shape goes for his throat, biting down and yanking back, blood and muscle flying out. He makes a terrible gurgling sound as he drops to the ground, blood spurting out in pulses.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Edward is last. The largest of them all is also the slowest. He’s made it halfway down the street, and he doesn’t stand a chance. The shadow jumps on him, wraps itself around him and squeezes. He screams and crumples and it tears into him like an animal.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Hermione can’t watch anymore. She shuts her eyes and focuses only on the sound of her own shuddering breaths. <em>In and out. In and out.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em></p><p>“Hermione? Darling, it’s alright. You’re safe now,”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Bella. It’s Bella’s voice. She’s hearing her voice in real life and if she opens her eyes she’ll see her, finally up close and genuinely tangible. It’s equally exhilarating as it is petrifying,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Hermione, it’s me. I won’t hurt you. Open your eyes,”</p><p>Her voice is so sweet, so enticing. She can smell the pine and roses, but she can smell something else too. Something coppery, metallic. Blood.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Slowly, she opens her eyes. And there she is, before her at last, staring at her with those lovely hypnotic eyes and that little smile. There’s blood smeared across her face, covering her neck and her dress and her hands up to her elbows. She’s crouching and tilting her head, looking absurdly innocent for someone that’s soaked in the blood of the dead men littering the ground around them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Oh my god,” Hermione whispers.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Not quite,” Bella says. She grins, revealing a pair of elongated, blood soaked fangs, “My name is Bellatrix Cassiopeia Black. I’ve been looking for you for 150 years, Hermione Granger. I really can’t tell you how nice it is to finally meet you.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
