  <em>Wild animals never kill for sport. Man is the only one to whom the torture and death of his fellow-creatures is amusing in itself</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>-James Anthony Froude</em>
</p><p>
  <em>She can see the sun through slits in the wood. It caresses her skin, warms her. She puts her fingers up, intercepts the light, and keeps them there as long as she can before she's too exhausted and the hand falls down to her side of it's own accord. She tries to move herself closer to the wooden walls, so she can feel the sun on her face, but the chain stops her. She closes her eyes and tries to remember what it felt like, to have the sun on her face. It's hard to recall, it's been so long. She remembers the blasting light when she looked directly at the sun, but she can't remember the warmth. She's so cold, all the time, that it's hard to remember what it's like not to be.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The cold helps, sometimes. It makes it much less horrible when they come for her. She's so cold her whole body has become numb, and she can barely feel it when they slip the IV into her arms. She grows weaker when the blood is drained from her body, but she's already so weak, weak and numb and cold, that it barely makes a difference. She barely feels it. </em>
</p><p><em>It's worst when they leave, when they take it out and wheel the bags of blood away, and she's left feeling used, drained, taken over. Her whole existence is depended on her blood, and whenever they leave, she watches the bags, and thinks, </em>was that enough? Did I give enough?<em> She knows what happens to those who don't make enough, who grow too weak to produce the required quantity. She's seen them being taken out, limp and motionless. They don’t come back. Someone else gets placed in their stall. Those are the worst days, the days where the new ones come. They scream and cry and beg, confused and scared and angry. After being so used to the silence, the sounds grate on her ears. She wants to yell back at them, to tell them to stop, that they're wasting valuable energy, that it's pointless, that no one is listening. But she doesn’t, because she never speaks anymore. Sometimes she still cries, but her tears are silent things dropping on her cheeks. And if she screams it's only in the confines of her own mind.</em></p><p align="center">****</p><p>There's someone following them. They've felt his presence for the past few days, trailing them, watching them from the darkness. They can smell him in the air around them, but whenever they turn, whenever they attack the shadows where he must be, they find nothing. He's always a few steps ahead of them.</p><p>They take to only ever leaving their apartment together, striding side by side in preparation for an attack. When they feed, one stands guard to make sure no one sneaks up on them while they're in the middle of the feast, senses muddled by the sweet, sweet scent and taste of blood. It's incredibly annoying, when no one attacks. Someone watches, someone follows, but whoever it is doesn't make a move, seemingly content to remain in the shadows. They get the distinct sense that they are being played with.</p><p>"I can’t take this anymore," Harry growls as they return to the apartment, another night spent watching and waiting. He closes the shutters in preparation for the upcoming sun. "What does he want?"</p><p>"How do you know it's a 'he'?" Hermione asks, a half smile on her face as she falls down on the battered sofa. "Could be a 'she'."</p><p>"Could be a 'it' for all I care, I just want he-she-it to stop following us," Harry replies, settling down next to her. Hermione wiggles her feet on his lap. "And just attack already."</p><p>"Maybe he-she-it doesn't want to attack us," Hermione suggests. "Maybe he-she-it is running surveillance. You know what, just say he. Easier."</p><p>"If you're surveilling someone, shouldn't you try to<em> hide</em> your presence?" Harry points out. "We've been aware of him for days now."</p><p>Hermione frowns, "I think maybe he's trying to scare us. He wants something."</p><p>"Such as?"</p><p>Hermione gives him a look. Whenever people want something from them, it's almost always connected to their creator.</p><p>"We should-"</p><p>"We're not calling Dumbledore."</p><p>"Harry-"</p><p>"No," Harry grinds his teeth. "We’re not kids, we can handle this ourselves. We can't go running to him every time something goes wrong. That's the whole point of living alone, 'mione."</p><p>Hermione rolls her eyes, "There's nothing childish about asking for help when you need it. In fact, there <em>is </em>something incredibly childish about pretending you don’t need help when you do."</p><p>"I-" Harry begins, but his voice dies in his mouth and less than a second later both he and Hermione have jumped off the sofa and moved to the door, faster than any human could ever hope for.</p><p>They can smell him. He's coming closer.</p><p>Harry pinches his lips together. If he had any need for breathing, he would hold his breath now. A quick look at Hermione shows she's just as nervous. He's never come this close to them before.</p><p>And he's coming closer, he's walking towards them, slowly but steadily, and now he's close enough Harry assumes he would be able to hear them if they spoke. Harry's never been able to smell him as clearly as he does now, and it makes him slightly shaky. There is power in the vampire, a great power imbedded into his very blood. Harry has only ever smelled such a powerful vampire once, and that was his creator.</p><p>He puts his finger on Hermione's shoulder, and she nods, taking her position on the right side of the door while Harry takes the left. He closes his eyes, allowing his ears and nose to work without interruption from his eyes, to pick up the subtle clues the vampire is leaving for them.</p><p>A male, that's clear from this distance. He's moving lightly on his feet, like an acrobat would. Harry hears scratching on metal, he's running claws on the walls outside, scratching them up, leaving his mark on them. He's walking closer, he should be at their door in seconds. Any second now-</p><p>The door flies into the air, thrown with so much force a gust of wind pushes Harry to the ground. It lands on the sofa, crashing it onto the floor, as Harry raises, claws out, to attack. He tries to slash at the figure in front of him, but a hand comes up, quicker then his own, grabs him and heaves him into the air. Harry flies through the air like the door before him, twisting and turning so, like a cat, he lands on his hands and feet. He growls and looks up, just in time to see Hermione being pinned to the wall by a man who's turned away from him. Hermione's claws are out as well, and she's slashing at the man, pieces of clothing falling to the ground with fat beads of crimson blood. The smell of spilled vampire blood, always so much more powerful than any other scent, takes over the room, forcing Harry to shake his head to clear it.</p><p>He doesn't waste any more time, launching at the man from behind. He reaches out with a claw to slash his throat, but in the last second the man turns, taking Hermione with him, and Harry realizes in horror, just a moment too late, that he's about to claw his friend.</p><p>The flesh on the back of Hermione's neck parts, forcing her blood out of her body. It sprays Harry as the momentum of his jump takes him on the opposite direction she's flying in, and he lands on the ground, claws covered in Hermione's blood as she is thrown against the wall with enough force to make it crack.</p><p>Hermione lands on the ground and begins gasping, hands reaching out to stem the flow of blood. Horrified, Harry scrambles towards her, ignoring their attacker. He cradles Hermione's head in his lap, placing his hands firmly on the wound. Vampires may heal quickly, but pain is still pain and right now Hermione's must be horrific. The entire back of her neck has been cut right open, down to the bone. Her wind pipes are destroyed, so she can't even voice her anguish. Harry pushes through the blood to force her skin together. His hands are slick from the sticky liquid, but he forces his fingers to remain in place as Hermione's flesh reconnects and she lets out a shudder.</p><p>It's only when he's convinced that she's healing that Harry looks up at the intruder. He's standing above them, back against the wall, lazily watching them. So Harry watches him back.</p><p>Physically he appears to be around his early twenties, but of course that means absolutely nothing. Harry learned a long ago that the older a vampire gets, the more powerful he becomes. And judging by the power evident in this vampire's smell, he is quite old indeed. His form is a deception, as so many vampires' are. The vampire is quite attractive, with honey blond hair and strange eyes, one green and one a blue so light it almost looks white. He's tall, not particularly muscular but not weak looking either. His expression is…bored. He looks bored.</p><p>Harry's anger flares back up. Bored? He's <em>bored</em>? After causing Hermione such pain, after breaking into their home, after stalking them for days, he's bored by them?</p><p>He gets up, gently placing Hermione on the ground. She's still weak, after losing so much blood. They'll have to go out and feed again as soon as possible. <em>Fuck</em>.</p><p>The man tilts his head slightly as Harry gets up, and his body remains lax and calm, expecting no danger to him. He watches as Harry takes a step forward and then says, "Calm down, young man. I'm not here for you or the<em> fräulein</em>."</p><p>Harry grits his teeth and takes another step forward, but he's suddenly stopped by a tug on his pants. Looking down he sees Hermione has pushed herself into a seated position and has taken hold of his pants. She shakes his head at him, and he immediately takes a step back. He knows better than to ignore Hermione's advice.</p><p>"Smart girl," The man speaks in the strange mix-and-match of accents that identifies so many of the European vampires who travelled from country to country so often that their non-native tongues became a combination of all the places they've been. Harry can hear some British, some Eastern European influences, some French. The strongest accent within an accent he can make out is German. Maybe Austrian, but he doesn’t know the differences between the German speaking countries enough to be sure.</p><p>"What do you want?" Hermione asks, voice cracked from loss of blood and weakness.</p><p>The man takes a step forward, causing Harry to take an automatic step backwards, so he's in front of Hermione. The man's eyes flicker between Harry and Hermione and a slight spark of amusement enters his expression, "What a gentleman. I told you, I have no interest in harming your beautiful lady."</p><p>Harry grits his teeth as Hermione repeats, calmly, "What do you want, sir?"</p><p>"I'm looking for someone, and I was hoping you'd be able to help me in my endeavor," The vampire turns his eyes to Hermione and away from Harry as he answers. Harry doesn’t like him looking at Hermione. There's an interest in his eyes that Harry finds unnerving. He's looking at her a bit like Harry once saw a human look at a particularly beautiful racing horse.</p><p>"You're looking for our creator," Hermione grabs Harry's hand and uses him to pull herself up. He lets her lean on him as she finds her balance again. He's surprised how quickly she's healed- she lost a massive amount of blood. But if there's one thing Hermione is, it's resilient. "For Dumbledore."</p><p>"Yes,<em> fräulein</em>," The man flicks his gaze to Harry. "Any idea where he may be, young man?"</p><p>"Why would we tell you?" Harry asks with a growl. "You just attacked us."</p><p>"Technically, you attacked me and I defended myself," The vampire raises his hands in mock defense.</p><p>"Technically you stalked us and broke down our door," Harry growls.</p><p>The vampire raises an eyebrow and turns back to Hermione, "Do you know where Albus is?"</p><p>"Albus?" Harry frowns.</p><p>"Yes," The vampire doesn't look away from Hermione as he answers Harry's question. "That's his name. Albus. Albus Dumbledore."</p><p>Harry swallows.</p><p>"He didn’t tell you his first name, did he?" The man shakes his head. "He's very secretive, but I thought he'd have told his students. You did study under him in Hogwarts, didn’t you? Never mind, it's unimportant at the moment. Now, will you please tell me where he is?"</p><p>"No," Hermione says calmly.</p><p>"No?" The vampire raises an eyebrow. "Little girl, you're quite brave, I'm sure, but in case you have not realized this by now, I am far superior to you in terms of…well, everything, but brute strength seems the most relevant right now. If you don’t give me what I want-"</p><p>"You'll attack us, and force us to give it to you?" Hermione snorts. "We'll fight you, we'll fight you so fiercely you'll be forced to kill us. So, you'll prove the superior but you will not get what you want."</p><p>Harry tightens his grasp on Hermione as the man observes her with narrowed eyes, but he just smiles and says, "Smart girl, aren't you? Tell me what you want."</p><p>Hermione lets go of Harry and takes a step towards the vampire. Harry is forced to stifle the urge to step in front of her. Dumbledore once told him his protective instinct was beyond the roof. But Hermione doesn’t actually need his protection. It's just an instinctive reaction to seeing anyone in danger. Harry is one of those people who must run into flaming buildings even if he knows he may not come out.</p><p>"Let's start with your name," Hermione says. "Tell us what your name is."</p><p>"Grindelwald."</p><p>Harry and Hermione frown at each other. He can tell that she's also surprised he so easily answered her question.</p><p>"Anything else?"</p><p>Hermione clears her throat and says, "What do you want from Dumbeldore?"</p><p>"I need his help."</p><p>Harry frowns, "You need his help."</p><p>"Yes," Grindelwald's eyes flicker to him. "I need his help."</p><p>"What for?" Hermione asks.</p><p>"That's not really your business, young lady, is it?"</p><p>"It very much is if you're asking for our help," Hermione points out. "We're not going to contact Dumbledore for you unless we know what you want from him."</p><p>Grindelwald raises an eyebrow and then his face cracks into a grin, "I require his assistance with finding something. Something's that's proving quite difficult for me to find. Something that needs to be found or a lot of people will die. And don’t ask me who this person is, please, I will not answer. Well? Shall we go back to our fight or will you tell me where I can find your creator?"</p><p>Hermione hesitates, then nods, "We'll call him, then."</p><p align="center">****</p><p>The ring of his phone forces Albus out of a rather pleasant day dream. He had been remembering his childhood, a particular day when he and his siblings had helped a nanny goat give birth. Their father had been away, forcing the three children to birth the kid themselves. It had been terrifying, at least for Albus. He had been so frightened that something would go wrong, that he animals would die because of some miscalculation of his. His brother had taken charge, forcefully shoving Albus out of the way and issuing orders in quick succession and sending their sister running as she got water and cloths from the house.</p><p>The animal had slipped out healthy and female, and Ariana had shrieked in excitement. That is the moment that Albus keeps returning to, over the years, the glee, the spontaneous hug he got from Aberforth, the pleased smile on his sister's face, the pride that they had, the three of them together, brought a living creature into the world. Albus doesn’t  think he had ever felt as close to his siblings as he had that day.</p><p>So he's displeased when the phone rings, snapping him out of the memory of Ariana's shrieks and Aberforth's crushing hug. But he sighs, resigned to a return to the present, and answers.</p><p>"Dumbledore here."</p><p>"Sir? It's Hermione."</p><p>Albus immediately sits up. He hasn’t heard from the two of them for about three months. That was the whole point of sending them off on their own, for them to learn to survive without his presence and guidance. They had decided on running the experiment for a full year, and Albus has no doubt that if Hermione is violating the terms, that something must have happened.</p><p>"What's wrong? Are you all right? Where's Harry?"</p><p>"I'm here, Professor Dumbledore," Dumbledore closes his eyes in relief at hearing Harry's voice.</p><p>"What’s wrong?" Because something is clearly wrong. He can hear it in their voices.</p><p>"It's…You know what, just talk to him," Harry snaps, and he doesn't sound like he's talking to Albus.</p><p>There's a soft laughter in the background that makes Albus tense up, because oh fuck<em> fuck </em>he knows that laughter, and then a very familiar voice says, "Al."</p><p>"Grindelwald," Albus grits his teeth together. "What are you doing terrorizing my students?"</p><p>He speaks in German. It's an automatic reaction to hearing that voice. Had he ever spoken to the vampire in another language? Not that he can recall.</p><p>"And hello to you too, love," Gellert sounds mildly amused. "Why yes, I have been well, and I thank you for asking-"</p><p>"<em>Gellert</em>. What do you want?"</p><p>Gellert clicks his tongue and sighs, "I need your help."</p><p>Albus tenses further, "And why in the name of all the gods would I help you with anything?"</p><p>"Because my problem happens to be one that may involve you as well."</p><p>"Oh, gods," Albus closes his eyes. "What have you done now?"</p><p>"Your faith in me is touching, my lovely. I have done nothing. I had a vision."</p><p>That was never good. "What did you see?"</p><p>"A bloodfarm, and a green skull with a snake curling out of its mouth."</p><p>Fuck. Fuck.<em> Fuck</em>.</p><p>"And…you're sure it was a vision of the present, not the past?"</p><p>"Yes, Albus. I know the difference."</p><p>Albus groans.  "Leave the children, I'll come see you. Stay in New York."</p><p>"I'll await you with baited breath, my lov-"</p><p>Albus clicks the phone off.</p><p align="center">****</p><p>He stands by the window, where he can see the alley leading to the apartment building. He's been standing there without moving for around twelve hours. Conveniently, the current inhabitants of the apartment are on vacation, so he didn’t need to kill them. Albus doesn’t like it when he kills humans. It's the cause of their current... disengagement from each other's lives. Gellert killed a girl he was feeding on, and Albus picked up and left.</p><p>There. Gellert grins as Al appears behind the corner. He's dressed in a grey suit and yellow tie (god, his sense of fashion is reprehensible), his hands are buried deep into his pockets and he's looking down at the ground as he walks. Gellert sniffs the air and sighs. He's missed that smell. Albus smells of airplanes and the New York subway and the streets he walked through, but under that is the scent of Albus's blood. Every living creature has a different smell that doesn't change throughout their lives, a smell that's deep down within them, beyond the scents of the world they accumulate over time. As far as Gellert is concerned, Albus's scent is the sweetest.</p><p>He knows that Al can smell him, of course. His body language doesn’t change, he doesn’t acknowledge he notices Gellert's presence at all. But he does, oh he certainly does. Gellert can tell just by the fact that Al slows down to a crawl, pushing off the moment where he finally enters the building.</p><p>Gellert considers leaving the window, but there's hardly a point. Albus will know he's been watching for him, so he stays in his place, waiting.</p><p>A few minutes later, the door nob turns slowly, and the door opens. Albus appears, walking into the apartment where they had lived together twenty years earlier.</p><p>"Have you looked for a while?" Gellert asks softly.</p><p>Albus raises an eyebrow and says, "I came straight here. But you already knew that."</p><p>Gellert smiles at his lover, "I like it when you know how to find me."</p><p>"It makes you feel special?" Albus sighs and sits down on the sofa. Hmm, Gellert tilts his head to follow the curve of Albus's legs. He's pleased today, as he often is, that Al only stopped aging at thirty-five. It's impossible to know when a pure-blood vampire will cease aging, and Gellert himself had done so at twenty-one, and he likes his own body- being young suits him, he thinks. But Albus looks much better as a mature, older man then he had as a teen and young adult.</p><p>"You always make me feel special, Al," Gellert purrs and takes a step forward, but Albus raises a hand to stop him.</p><p>"We have some things to discuss."</p><p>"What, no time for-"</p><p>"Grindelwald."</p><p>"Oof, <em>Grindelwald</em>. You must be really upset with me."</p><p>"Of course I'm upset with you," Albus growls. Oh, he's <em>growling</em>. Gellert's mood is quickly turning from pleased to ecstatic. How the hell had he let <em>five years</em> go by without seeing him? "You threatened my students."</p><p>Gellert rolls his eyes, "Come one, she's just a mudblood, she's not a <em>student</em>. The boy, though, a halfblood. I understand."</p><p>"That makes no difference," Albus sighs, looking incredibly exasperated. "But I don’t want to get into a philosophical discussion with you right now."</p><p>Gellert has to agree. Philosophical discussions between the them always end in a fight, and fights usually end in violent hate sex, which Gellert admittedly enjoys quite a bit, but Albus always leaves after that type of interaction (one of the more annoying things about his lover is his tendency to remember his precious <em>moral compass</em> whenever things get interesting) and Gellert really needs him to stay right now.</p><p>"I missed this place," Gellert looks around. "Though I'm not a fan of the changes the current residents made to the décor. They're on vacation, before you accuse me of ending their existence."</p><p>"Have you gone to the Ministry?" Albus asks. No small talk, then.</p><p>"The Ministry?" Gellert scoffs. "Fudge wouldn't listen. You know him, he'd rather stick his head in the sand."</p><p>Albus looks at him for a moment, beautiful blue eyes trained on Gellert, making his insides warm up. Albus's undivided attention always does that to him, makes him feel firmly rooted in place, like he's exactly where he's meant to be, which of course he is. He's always where he's supposed to be when he's with Al.</p><p>"Yes, that does sound like him."</p><p>"I've looked for them, but…" Gellert shrugs.</p><p>"You can't find them," Albus observes.</p><p>"I was hoping you could help me with that, love."</p><p>Albus sighs.</p><p>"Come on, Albus, you know Bellatrix and Lucius better than I do. I'm sure you've got some idea where they would be," Gellert leans forward and this time doesn’t stop. Albus sighs, but it's more in resignation than anything else, and his hands stay limp on his sides as Gellert climbs on his lap, straddling his hips. "Don’t you, love?"</p><p>He leans in to kiss Albus, slowly and deeply, reveling in the familiar taste and feel of him. Gellert wraps his hands around Albus's neck, pushing them closer to each other. He grins into Albus's mouth in victory as warm hands come up to his waist, curling around him. Gellert bites down on Albus's lip, drawing blood, which he quickly laps up. Vampire blood is not usually as tasty as human blood. Albus's is the exception as far as Gellert is concerned.</p><p>They're vampires, they don’t need to breath, they could go on for hours like this, locked into one another, aware of nothing but each other's bodies. Gellert wouldn’t mind that, but Albus pushes him away, and Gellert groans as the kiss is broken off.</p><p>"We should go to Godric's Hollow," Albus mumbles, and Gellert knows him well enough to know he's trying to clear his head. Gellert runs his hands through Al's hair, trying to make that as hard as possible.</p><p>"You think they'd go back there?" Gellert frowns. It seems a bit too obvious. Bellatrix may be out of her mind but she was not unintelligent. "After last time?"</p><p>"Last time was nearly seventy years ago," Albus points out, and catches the hand that had started descending to his crotch. "<em>Don’t</em>."</p><p>Gellert rolls his eyes, "Come on, Al. It's been five years since I fucked anyone."</p><p>"Then go fuck someone else," Albus says dryly. Gellert loves the way his lips shape around the profanity. "And get off my lap."</p><p>"I really don’t want to do that."</p><p>"Which one?"</p><p>"Both, love."</p><p>"Right," And that's all the warning Gellert gets before Albus abruptly stands up, and he's thrown to the floor, his enhanced reflexes the only thing stopping him from landing unceremoniously on his face. He manages to twirl in the air and land on his hands and feet, very much like Albus's boy did the night before.</p><p>"Alllll," Gellert purrs, moving on all fours towards Albus, who's gotten up and is walking towards the door. "Playing hard to get, are we? My favourite game."</p><p>"The Death Eaters haven't opened a bloodfarm in years. If they're starting again, their loyalty has been reinvigorated, they're back in full on believer mode. Whenever this happens, they always go back to the source. Every time. They'll be in Godric's Hollow," Albus says. Gellert nods.</p><p>"Very well, back to England it is."</p><p align="center">****</p><p>Dumbledore call the apartment four nights later. Hermione, who's been expecting him, jumps up from the sofa (they've taken the door off it and put it back in place, though it's still wobbly- neither Harry nor Hermione had ever fixed a door before) and rushes to answer the phone.</p><p>"Hello, children," Dumbledore says calmly.  </p><p>"Did you meet him?" Harry asks, standing up from his chair, where he had been reading a book. Or, in Hermione's humble opinion, pretending to read. "That Grindelwald guy?"</p><p>Enhanced hearing is usual for many things. Dumbledore can hear Harry and responds, "Yes. I'm sorry I haven't called, I've been traveling. And I'm sorry he…bothered you. He won’t be doing that again."</p><p>"<em>Bothered</em> us?" Harry shakes his head in clear bewilderment. "That's one way to put it. Who <em>is </em>he, Dumbledore?"</p><p>"A very powerful, and very dangerous vampire," Dumbledore replies. "And not anything you need to concern yourselves with, I promise."</p><p>"But-" Hermione starts, but she's interrupted by Dumbledore.</p><p>"I need you to trust me. Do you?"</p><p>The answer comes naturally. She trusts her creator, "I do."</p><p>"Then trust me when I say that there is nothing you need to concern yourself with," Dumbledore says, and Hermione can feel Harry tense behind her. "You seem to have done quite well these past few months, I say we return to our little experiment. I'll see you in nine months, yes?"</p><p>"Wait-" Harry moves forward, but Dumbledore has already hung of the phone.</p><p>"Well," Harry snaps. "That was productive."</p><p>"Hmm."</p><p>"I can't believe he just…just…I don’t even know what to call it. But I hate it when does it."</p><p>"Brushed us off," Hermione suggests.</p><p>"Yeah, that sounds about right," Harry growls as he comes to stand besides her. "What the hell is he up to?"</p><p>"I don’t know," Hermione places her forehead against the glass, closing her eyes. The glass is hard against her over sensitive skin. It must be freezing cold so late at night, exposed to the October chill. It there's one thing she truly misses about being human (other than food and drink) it’s the ability to feel the cold and the heat. Vampires' inner body warmth remains in a perpetual slightly chilled condition, no matter what, and their flesh remains an icy chill even in the Sahara. She misses the feeling of warmth that a fire used to give her, the feeling of cool from being thrown in a pool. She never realized before how pleasurable it was to wrap your hands around a warm drink in the middle of the winter.</p><p>But this is her own private sorrow, not to be shared. Harry, who is in most things her one true confidant, has been a vampire from the moment of his conception and does not understand her yearning for things forever lost.</p><p>Sometimes Hermione wonders if her somewhat blind trust in her creator comes from that, from the fact that he has been the one to yank her from one life into another. The change had been so drastic, and he has been the one consistent, the one thing that remains from her old life, that she can not find it in herself to doubt him. Because, as illogical as it sounds, her reasoning appears to work somewhere along these lines: if Dumbledore is good, and he did this to her, then the transformation must have been good. But if Dumbledore isn’t good…</p><p>This was something Hermione knows Harry just cannot understand. For him, the change had barely been noticeable. As a halfblood vampire (one who had a vampire parent and a human one), Harry has always been a vampire, but did not stop aging naturally, as purebloods (purebloods being those born of two vampire parents) did, and had to be turned by a pureblood to stop his aging process. Dumbledore had been the pureblood to turn Harry three years earlier, a year after Hermione had been turned.</p><p>As though able to read her mind, and realizing she is in need of a distraction, Harry places a finger on Hermione's shoulder, drawing her out of her thoughts, and says, "I don't like it when he does that."</p><p>"Does what? Brushes us off? You've already said that."</p><p>"That too," Harry growls. "But I was thinking more of his tendency to treat us like children. Though I suppose it goes together, doesn’t it?"</p><p>Hermione sighs, "Have you ever heard of that name? Grindelwald?"</p><p>"No, I don’t think so," Harry replies. "But if you're curious, I know who we could ask."</p><p>Hermione groans, knowing exactly who Harry is referring to, "You want to go see Luna?"</p><p>"I<em> always</em> want to go see Luna," Harry grins, looking ridiculously pleased by the idea. "There's very little that I find more enjoyable then going to see Luna. Come on, 'mione, it's not like we have anything better to do."</p><p>Hermione rolls her eyes, but sighs in resignation, "Fine, fine! We'll go see Loony Lovegood. But tomorrow night, I'm too tired for anything more tonight."</p>
