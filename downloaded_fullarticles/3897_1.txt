</p><p> </p><p>Spencer was sitting by the window, staring outside. He was doing that an awful lot lately, but he couldn’t seem to help it. He was still staring down the path where his life had changed. Trying to absorb and adjust. He didn’t like change.</p><p>Warm, loving hands settled on his shoulders.</p><p>“He’s not coming back, Spencer. And even if he did, after the way he treated us, you especially, I wouldn’t allow him back. I never thought him this weak, but we’re better off without him.”</p><p>Spencer nodded. He understood his mom’s point. What was the point in a father you couldn’t rely on? One who just walked out on you when things didn’t go as he wanted them to.</p><p>He just wished he had a dad who was there, who cared, who loved them enough.</p><p>He wished he could be enough to earn his father’s love.</p><p>“It’s not your fault, Spencer. It isn’t mine either. Things are difficult, yes. Neither you nor I are ordinary people. But there were many solutions to make things easier and not simply leave us to our fate.”</p><p>“But maybe if I had -“</p><p>“No.” Fingers under his chin turned him to look into his mother’s sincere eyes. “You are perfect just the way you are. I’m sorry that your father couldn’t see that, but that’s his loss. If only he hadn’t hurt you with his blindness.”</p><p>He could see the truth in her eyes, unclouded by the schizophrenia that claimed her mind so often. There was the trace of dullness that came with her medication and that he knew she hated. But since his father had left, she tried very hard to take her meds anyway, so Spencer wasn’t left to his own devices. He wanted to believe her and maybe wanting could be enough to make it true. He nodded even though he knew his mother could see the lack of certainty in his eyes.</p><p>“With your father gone, things are a bit more difficult, and I don’t want you to suffer any more than necessary. I want you properly taken care off, and I know I can’t always give you that.”</p><p>Spencer wanted to protest, but his mom raised her hand to cut him off. “You are five, Spencer. No matter your intelligence, between your age and my illness it would be utterly irresponsible to stay on our own” She settled in beside him.</p><p>“Let me tell you a secret; one, I’ve never even shared with your dad. I’m not really a muggle. Technically, I come from a wizarding family, but our branch fell to squibs generations ago, so long, that we’re living and being looked on as muggles. But the main branch of the family never forgot about us and kept in contact. We were always welcome, and I spent many a lovely visit on the family estate during my childhood back in England. I always got along well with my cousin Clive who is now the head of the family, so I wrote to him and asked for help. He’s going to visit us tomorrow, and we’ll talk about what our options are. That might include moving to England, so I want you to think about that possibility. I know change is difficult for you, but I need to know that there’s someone there to look after you when I can’t.”</p><p>Spencer nodded dazedly.</p><p>He was still trying to comprehend that both of his parents were actually magical. That his father had been wrong to blame his mom’s supposed status as a muggle for all his disappointments.</p><p>He wasn’t sure where that left him.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>Spencer was relieved when the next day their visitor arrived in a taxi. It wasn’t that he hadn’t been exposed to all sorts of magical transport through his dad, but he counted it as a good sign that the head of a magical house was comfortable with muggle transportation.</p><p>He still hid in his room and eavesdropped on the adults.</p><p>“Diana, it’s so good to see you again. It’s been too long.” The man who hugged his mom looked a few years older than her. He wore nice, very British looking clothes and his wavy hair was the same shade of chestnut as Spencer’s own.</p><p>“Well, magic or no magic, we do have the Atlantic Ocean between us. Thank you for making the trip, Clive. I wouldn’t have known who else to ask for help.”</p><p>“It’s nothing, Diana. You’re family, and we Paddingtons always take care of our own, all of our own. I’m just sorry that it took something like this to bring me here at all. Now, I believe you promised to introduce me to your exceptional son. Where is the lad? I’ve been looking forward to this a long time.”</p><p>Spencer took a deep breath and made his way down the hallway. He figured the newcomer seemed nice enough.</p><p>“Hi.” He just gave a shy wave and hoped the man wouldn’t hold out his hand or anything worse. It probably wouldn’t do to appear rude at their first-ever meeting.</p><p>“Hello, Spencer. It’s nice to finally meet you. I’ve heard a lot about you.” They all settled onto the couches in the living room. “Do you know who I am, Spencer?”</p><p>“You are Clive Robert Gaius Paddington, the 16th Marquess of Newcastle-upon-Tyne and head of the Ancient and Noble House of Paddington. You are also my fifth cousin twice removed on my mother’s side. Mom gave me books about our family to read last night.”</p><p>“That sounds all very impressive - and also incredibly dull and impersonal, wouldn’t you agree? I was thinking, given that I’m only a little older than your mum, maybe you calling me Uncle Clive would suit us all best. Does that sound good to you?”</p><p>Spencer shrugged and nodded. He wasn’t even sure yet if he’d see enough of the man to warrant a personal form of address, but uncle sounded neutral enough.</p><p>“So, how soon can you two be packed up so I can move you back to England?”</p><p>“What?!” Spencer felt like he’d missed at least two conversations.</p><p>“Subtlety and patience were never your fortes, Clive,” his mom chided.</p><p>“You wrote me to take care of the both of you, and that is exactly what I want to do. But I can’t if we have the Atlantic between us. Let me take you home, Diana. You know the family seat has plenty of space and young Spencer here deserves to grow up surrounded by family.”</p><p>“I…,” Spencer didn’t want to say it, but he needed to know. Needed to know if he would be a disappointment yet again. “I don’t have magic. Will that be alright? Can I even live in a magical family home?”</p><p>“Spencer, I know you heard me earlier, and I meant every word. Everyone in this family is equally important and welcome, and we’ll support you any way we can and be proud of all that you’ll accomplish. And our estate is actually a muggle house. We haven’t lived in that house long enough to saturate it with magic so the electricity wouldn’t work. I’m not saying the house doesn’t have magical quirks, but I know you’ll be just fine with those. So, what do you say? Does a new start in England sound like a good plan?”</p><p>Spencer glanced at his mom and could see that she liked the idea. He wasn’t sure, but it also didn’t feel as if he had much to lose right now.</p><p>“Yeah. That sounds good.”</p>
