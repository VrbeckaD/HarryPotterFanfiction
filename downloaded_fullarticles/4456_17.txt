Immediately garnered the ubiquitous cat upon my lap. Ah, well, I thought, I'll nurse what I've got, then get up to get a new cup.

Then, with warm, amused eye contact and a quirky little smile, went back to get the cream, and precisely filled my cup where he'd left just enough room for the proper amount. Because the ratio of cream and coffee has to be just so. Because cats and coffee are equally subtle and profound. Because he knows. </p><p>That's how I know.</p></div>
