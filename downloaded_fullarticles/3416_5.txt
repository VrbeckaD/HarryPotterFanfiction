    <p>It was with a strong act of will that Hermione kept her hand away from her Prefect badge.  She’d had it for a month now, and she still couldn’t believe it.  Ever since she’d read <em>Hogwarts: A History</em> at age eleven, Hermione Granger had been determined to become a prefect.  It was her way of proving to everyone that the rules were there for a reason, if you followed the rules, then you were rewarded.</p><p>With a flick of her fingers, she pulled her robes straight and entered the next train compartment.  She’d been assigned the last three train cars for her patrols, switching off with Dean Thomas, her counterpart.  It was an easy job, just a few uneasy first years, and one pair of second years arguing over a Charms assignment.</p><p>Movement through the window on the door between train cars caught Hermione’s eye and she froze.  Ronald Weasley was outside the door, back to her.  She could see Seamus Finnigan behind him, that was who Weasley was looking at, but he clearly hadn’t seen her.</p><p>For a moment, the memory of Weasley’s profane commentary the year before warred with her heartbeat, and as the door handle began to move, Hermione bolted.  She opened the door to a compartment and slammed it shut behind her.  When she turned around, she found herself facing three boys she didn’t know, but who looked to be in her year.</p><p>“Sorry,” Hermione began.</p><p>“Are you all right?”  One of the boys asked.  He had black hair with blond streaks, cut in uneven clumps that ranged from just below his ears to his neck.  He was also American.</p><p>“Just, avoiding someone,” Hermione said, realizing that she’d probably been silent longer than she should have.</p><p>“Have a seat then,” said one of the other two boys.  He was Asian, with short hair that spiked up.  His grey eyes were startling, but friendly and his smile matched his clothing for brightness.</p><p>The final boy, who was also darker skinned, with black hair, watched her with green eyes that seemed all the more intense with the dark clothing he wore.</p><p>Hermione perched on the seat across from the Asian boy and his friend, fingers twitching in her robe for a moment, then she spoke, quickly, “I’m Hermione Granger, fifth year Gryffindor prefect.”</p><p>“I’m Chase,” the Asian boy said as he leaned against his companion, “this is Harry, and he’s Shadow.”</p><p>Hermione glanced at the boy beside her.  “It’s a nickname,” he said, smiling at her.  “I’m very good at being unnoticed.”</p><p>“Oh,” Hermione said.  She frowned, “What year are you in, I don’t…” she hesitated.  It was normal not to remember everybody, she thought.</p><p>“We just transferred in,” Chase said, “We’ll be tenth graders.”</p><p>“Fifth years,” Harry said, his English accent jarring after hearing Chase and Shadow’s American ones.  “Americans say tenth grade, but we’ll be fifth years.”</p><p>“Right,” Chase said, “like that’s not confusing.”</p><p>“It’s really not,” Hermione began.</p><p>“Don’t bother,” Harry said, “he’s just trying to get a rise out of you.”  He reached over and flicked Chase’s ear.</p><p>“I’ve never heard of anyone transferring to Hogwarts,” Hermione said, “Dunbrow’s <em>Magical Education</em> says.”</p><p>“That book was printed in 1745,” Harry said, “it still refers to America as ‘the Colonies’.”  He paused, tilting his head, “I mean, if that’s your source, you do know that other schools exist right?  They didn’t just cram some kids into uniforms for the media in the tournament, right?”</p><p>“I knew that,” Hermione said, <em>great, another one.</em></p><p>“We studied at Ilvermorny,” Shadow said.</p><p>“Is it really a castle, like Hogwarts?”  Hermione asked.</p><p>“Ilvermorny on the Mountain is,” Chase replied, “but we went to Coral Cliffs, in California.”</p><p>The door to the compartment slammed open, and Hermione jumped.  Ronald Weasley stepped in, staring at her chest.</p><p>“I heard they made you a Prefect,” Weasley said, “I don’t know why I’m surprised.  The way you bounce around, it probably wasn’t that-“</p><p>Whatever Weasley had been about to say was cut off by the appearance of a boot on his throat.  Harry had, all unnoticed, got up and was now standing on one foot, the other was nudging Weasley’s chin higher.</p><p>“Finish that sentence, or try to start another one like it, and I’ll shut you up, permanently,” Harry said, voice as hard and cold as his eyes.</p><p>“We don’t do that here,” Shadow added.  He hadn’t gotten up, but he was holding his wand now, the tip pointed in Weasley’s direction almost casually.  Chase also had his wand out, but he was also grinning.</p><p>“Who the hell are you?”  Weasley demanded.</p><p>Harry let his foot drop and crossed his arms, “I’m Harry Potter.”</p><p>Weasley went white, his freckles standing out like ink splattered on parchment.  Hermione stared at Harry, unaware her mouth was hanging open until someone, Shadow, pushed her chin up.</p><p>“Excuse me?”  Weasley said or squeaked rather.</p><p>Harry smirked, “I’m Harry Potter.  And I do not excuse you.  You’d better go before I really get angry.”  He flicked his hand forward and Weasley stumbled back, although Hermione was pretty sure Harry hadn’t actually done anything. “You won’t like me when I’m angry.”</p><p>Weasley left the compartment and the door slid shut.  Hermione glanced around and found Chase tucking his wand in the front of his plaid over shirt with a smirk.  “Come sit down, Hero.  I was just getting comfortable.”</p><p>“Fine,” Harry said, settling back into the corner of the seat.  Chase promptly flopped backwards, wriggling until Harry’s arm was across his stomach and Chase’s head was resting against Harry’s chest and shoulder.</p><p>“Questions?”  Shadow asked.</p><p>“You, you’re Harry Potter,” Hermione said.</p><p>“Yup,” Harry replied.</p><p>“But, the goblins, they,” Hermione stopped.</p><p>Harry shrugged his free shoulder and Chase grumbled a little, “They didn’t really do much, although they’ll never explain it.  When I went to Gringotts, they did an identity test because I’d never handled my Gringotts key, they can tell things like that, if you’re using a key you’ve handled often.  Part of their security or something.  When they did the test on me, well, they didn’t like what they found, so they dug up my parents’ will, found an acceptable guardian and sent me to America.”</p><p>“But, what about,” Hermione trailed off.</p><p>“The Dursleys?”  Harry snorted, “They got to ‘never come back’ on the guardianship offer and signed it.  Not even a second thought.  Parker’s a better guardian by a landslide.”</p><p>“He’s pretty cool,” Chase said.</p><p>Hermione wanted to ask if Chase and Harry were a couple, but good manners, and the knowledge that they would tell her, probably in unnecessary detail, kept her silent for a long moment.  Then her eye caught on Harry’s watch, prompting her to check her own.</p><p>“You might want to consider getting dressed,” Hermione said as she stood up.</p><p>“Damn, I didn’t realize I was naked,” Harry replied.</p><p>“Your school uniform,” Hermione said patiently, “we’re required to wear them to the Welcoming Feast and Sorting Ceremony.”</p><p>“Right,” Chase said, and waved his hand, “we’ll do that.”</p><p>“I need to patrol the cars,” Hermione said, “Thank you for your company.”</p><p>“Hey, no problem,” Harry said, “you’re free to join us whenever you like.”</p><p>“Yeah,” Chase said, “Promise, we might be sarcastic little shits, but we’re all well aware that you have beautiful brown eyes.”</p><p>“And a lovely smile,” Shadow added.</p><p>“Thank you,” Hermione said, she left the car and stopped for a moment to lean against the wall in the corridor.  For a brief moment, she remembered how she’d felt, getting on the train for the first time as a first year.  The idea that she might have some potential friends was amazing.</p>
