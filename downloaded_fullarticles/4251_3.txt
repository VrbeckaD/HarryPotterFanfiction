  <em> 4 September </em>
</p><p>She was late.</p><p>Well she wasn't quite late yet, but, by her standards, she was late.</p><p>Hermione bustled into the Arithmancy classroom in a frenzy. She’d never been late her first day to a class, and as the newest Gryffindor prefect she wasn’t about to start the trend now.  </p><p>Glancing around the full room, her heart quickly fell discovering only two remaining seats, and neither in good company.</p><p>Marcus Flint sat near the back an open chair beside him, which were it anyone else she would have suffered the poor spot. But with Marcus Hermione recognized the danger of a place so out of sight. He could almost do anything and Professor Vector, so far from the back, would be none the wiser.</p><p>Still, it wasn’t much better than the second choice.</p><p>Blaise Zabini sat closer to the middle of the room. He on his own had never actually done anything to her. In fact, they'd never even so much as shared a sentence. It was his close company that made her falter.</p><p>It appeared the quiet boy had merely drawn the shorter stick as in front of him sat Draco Malfoy and Theodore Nott. They, unlike Blaise, had always made their distaste of her known.</p><p>Hermione took a big breath, doing one last rove over the classroom in feeble attempt for any other option, before making the choice she hoped was the safer one.</p><p>If looks could kill Hermione would have died a hundred times. All three boys stared, along with nearly the rest of the class, with mixed expressions of appall and fury.</p><p>“What the hell do you think you're doing?” came Draco’s harsh sneer as Hermione pulled out the seat to Blaise's left. Hermione returned his disgust with the best glare she had.</p><p>“Oh I don't know, just thought I'd try my hand at inter house unity,” she said sarcastically, taking the needed materials from her bag. Honestly, did he think she wanted to sit near him?</p><p>“The hell you’re sitting here,” Theo growled.</p><p>Hermione sighed looking up at the lean and angry boy. “There aren’t any other spots,” she muttered, trying to attend his reasonability. She doubted it was possible amongst this group, but still, it wasn’t as if she had any better options.</p><p>Besides, Hermione silently reasoned, she was more visible in this spot if the many eyes now on that corner were something to go by.</p><p>“Not our problem, mudblood,” Draco spat, “get lost.”</p><p>As if this was somehow the only encouragement Hermione had needed, she turned to the blond Slytherin with eyes suddenly fiery in her resolve. “Too bad, Malfoy.” And with that she dumped her books on the desk and defiantly plonked into the chair.</p><p>Blaise shot to his feet.</p><p>“Did you need something Mr. Zabini,” came the disciplinarian voice of Professor Vector from the doorway quieting the room for the start of the lesson.</p><p>The Slytherin took in a slow breath, his fists tightening to whitened knuckles at his sides. “Nothing professor,” he hissed.</p><p>“Then please sit, class has begun.”</p><p>Nearly no one paid attention to the lesson, the whole class more attuned to the high tension coming from the Slytherin corner.</p><p>Murmurs of mudblood and filth drifted from the table behind Hermione where Adrian Pucey and another Slytherin Hermione did not know sat. Seamus and Katie kept shooting back worried glances from a table at the front while Draco had turned completely in his chair, eyes boring into her angrily. Nott scowled from the side. Blaise at least had the decency to glare at the board in a horrible farce to appear invested in the class.</p><p>Only Hermione was actually paying attention, her quill scribbling furiously over her notes as she dutifully wrote down Vector’s lesson word for word.</p><p>“Know it all,” Draco muttered shooting Hermione a dirty look.</p><p>Her quill paused only momentarily before picking up speed again.</p><p>“Mudblood,” he hissed instead, as though hoping to get a rise.</p><p>Her eyes found his briefly. “And yet my marks are better than yours.”</p><p>Anger flashed across his sharp face, but Hermione didn't see as she once again returned to taking notes.</p><p>Finally, after what felt to some like an eternity, class ended.</p><p>“We will continue this discussion next lesson,” Professor Vector said from the front. “And I certainly hope everyone made a good choice in their spots,” she shot a stern look to the Slytherin corner, “because it will be your seat for the rest of first term.”</p><p>“Fuck,” came Blaise’s voice just before he swept from the table.</p><p>Hermione scowled at her books. This was not her year.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> 6 September </em>
</p><p>Hermione walked into the Arithmancy room the following Friday to find her table partner helplessly petitioning Professor Vector for a seat change.</p><p>“Professor,” Blaise implored softly, almost desperately. “It's a very distracting spot.”</p><p>“Then you shouldn't have sat there.”</p><p>“She sat next to me,” he argued angrily.</p><p>“Mr. Zabini. This sounds like nothing more than all that silly house rivalry nonsense, and quite frankly, there's no time for that in my classroom.”</p><p>“I understand how it may seem, professor, but I promise it is not that. If you would--”</p><p>“Now this is quite enough Mr. Zabini,” Professor Vector snapped as the class was almost full. “It is one semester, and I'm sure you can handle yourself. Come spring term, if you still so wish it, you're more than welcome to change your seat.”</p><p>“But professor--”</p><p>“I said enough.”</p><p>Blaise, realizing his loss, turned and moved back to the table where the lone Gryffindor now sat. Hermione kept her head down as the Italian boy slumped in the seat beside her, knocking her slightly on the way. She knew how to pick her battles, and this one was not worth it.</p><p>She settled her things instead.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> 11 September </em>
</p><p>“How's Arithmancy going?” Ginny asked as Hermione met her friends in the Great Hall for lunch.</p><p>Hermione scowled tossing her bag to the ground carelessly. Ginny frowned.</p><p>“That bad?”</p><p>“You've no idea,” Hermione confided. “They’re either calling me names or messing with my things. It's an exercise just to focus.”</p><p>“Yoo cudf hex ‘em,” Ron offered around a spoonful of mash.</p><p>Hermione rolled her eyes. He was always quick to the attack. “And earn a detention with the <em> High Inquisitor </em> for illegal use of magic?”</p><p>Ron frowned, spooning another bite.</p><p>“There's always Divination,” Harry offered offhandedly. He grinned at Hermione's look of appall.</p><p>In Hermione’s book, even Draco Malfoy, in all his snobby rudeness, was still better than dealing with Trelawney.</p><p>“No,” she affirmed. “I can handle those snakes. I just wish they'd find better material. I mean honestly, you'd think after four years of the same lines they'd be tired of it all by now.”</p><p>Hermione stalled in her tirade catching sight of her unfortunate table partner walking by. The quiet Slytherin glanced sideways, his eyes grazing over her with bored indifference.</p><p>Hermione bit her lip scowling down at her plate.</p><p>Oh just brilliant, she silently berated. All she needed was one of them hearing her complain. Now they really would never leave her alone.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> 13 September </em>
</p><p>Blaise didn't look up as the chair beside him pulled out. He'd decided to come to class early today, having nothing better to do with his morning, but hadn't thought to account for the fact that the Know-It-All was probably an early attendee as well.</p><p>Glaring down at the table, Blaise silently continued to trace mindless lines with his quill as Hermione settled in.</p><p> She sucked a sharp breath, swearing quietly.</p><p>Blaise looked up.</p><p>Well there was a word he'd never expected such a stuck up girl to use. It surprised him.</p><p>Hermione glanced sideways sucking at her finder. She frowned when she noticed him staring. “What?”</p><p>Blaise shook his head. “Who knew you had such a mouth.”</p><p>A flush crept up her neck, Hermione quickly turning away. Blaise smirked, returning to tracing the wood. Color on her cheeks, he idly thought, didn't make her look worse.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> 16 September </em>
</p><p>Blaise nodded to Adrian casually as he made his way back to the common room before lunch.</p><p>“Zabini,” the boy called walking up with a great leer about his face. “You have to hear this, mate. I just handed that mudblood a real good one.”</p><p>Blaise lifted a brow curiously, though truthfully he never had cared much for the bullying some in his house seemed to live for. He found the behavior rather crude and unintelligent. Still, he reclined his head encouraging the other boy to continue.</p><p>“You know those potions Snape has us working on?”</p><p>Trepidation nestled Blaise's gut. “Yes?”</p><p>“Well let's just say that Granger might have mixed up a few ingredients.” Adrian grinned horridly.</p><p>Blaise frowned. “Didn't Snape warn us about that?”</p><p>“Exactly,” Adrian drawled, giving his housemate a funny look. “Oh you should have seen it, the look on her face.” He made a mockingly exaggerated expression, laughing as he did so. “Shame she only burnt her robes.” Adrian sighed. “Really, I can't wait for the day when we finally wash out those stains. Father thinks it won't be long now. Anyway,” and he walked off laughing to himself.</p><p>Blaise watched the other boy go before turning back towards the dungeons. As he passed the potions room, he caught sound of Granger’s soft voice.</p><p>“Yes, Professor, I apologize.”</p><p>“Apologies don't fix this,” Snape hissed.</p><p>Hermione stood before the potions master, her outer robe discarded carelessly on the floor, head hung and fists at her sides.</p><p>“This is the kind of dim witted behavior I expect from Longbottom or one of those idiots you keep for friends,” Snape went on, the two idiots in question growling from their post outside the classroom, “but from you Miss Granger, twenty points from Gryffindor. And clean up this mess.”</p><p>“Yes professor.”</p><p>Snape turned, his dark robes flying as he stormed into his private office. Hermione scowled after him before slumping onto the floor. A sudden sound accosted the air, soft and strange. Crying. An uncomfortable feeling wrung Blaise's gut at hearing such a sound from the usually spirited girl.</p><p>“Come on Mione,” Ron's voice soothed as he and Harry entered the room.</p><p>The two boys made quick work of cleaning and calming their friend. Before Blaise realized, they were upon him. Hermione gasped at catching the quiet Slytherin loitering outside the door, her small hands quickly coming up to swipe at stray tears.</p><p>“What do you want,” Ron scathed. “Come to check out the show?”</p><p>“Are you alright?”</p><p>It wasn't what Blaise had meant to say. He'd meant to make an offhanded remark, things in their place and so on. He didn't know why the words changed.</p><p>Hermione frowned pulling in a shuddered breath. “I'm fine.”</p><p>“No thanks to your lot,” Ron added hotly.</p><p>Blaise regarded the redhead with a scowl. “If you don't want my lot to have such an easy go then maybe keep better watch on your pet.”</p><p>He hadn't meant to say that either, especially at the new look of hurt in Hermione's eye.</p><p>“Is that a threat?” Harry growled, his wand tight in his hand.</p><p>Blaise shrugged halfheartedly, pushing roughly between Hermione and Ron as he continued to the dungeons. He told himself it was a show of power, but really it was to escape before he said anything else he didn't mean.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> 18 September </em>
</p><p>Hermione found her table missing it's other occupant until the very last moment before the start of class.</p><p>“Thank you for gracing us today, Mr. Zabini,” Professor Vector antagonized as the quiet boy grudgingly dropped into his seat. She flicked her wand producing a flurry of equations on the chalkboard. “You all will be applying the theories discussed last lesson today. Anything not finished in class will be homework. Begin.”</p><p>The prospect of less homework had today's students less distracted overall, the room quietly working hard through the equations on the board.</p><p>Blaise huffed at his paper, scratching away at it angrily. Hermione glanced sideways, but didn't linger long as she continued her own equation. A few minutes later a sound came again along with another angry scratch. It was quiet for a few minutes more before he made another frustrated sound.</p><p>“Check your symbols,” Hermione muttered impatiently.</p><p>His scowl turned on her. “Did I ask your help, mudblood?”</p><p>Hermione paused in her work, her eyes drawing to the boy beside her. She looked disappointed, which for whatever reason bothered Blaise more than her interference.</p><p>“If you don't want help then don't make so much noise every time you get the problem wrong. Honestly, it's distracting.”</p><p>“You're distracting,” Blaise snapped back angrily.</p><p>Draco turned from the table in front to shoot his friend a confused, and somewhat concerned, look. As though only realizing his words, and their childishness--and frustrated at the fact that he's called her a name he'd never intended to use--Blaise scowled further muttering, “fuck off, Malfoy,” harshly.</p><p>Professor Vector cleared her throat, and the room sat quiet once more.</p><p>Blaise changed his symbols.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> 20 September </em>
</p><p>The Arithmancy room had been working quietly on Vector’s newest set of problems when the loud crashing of a book aggravated the air.  All eyes watched as Hermione quietly picked up her text, all except one who had seen how it had fallen.</p><p>Blaise frowned glancing back at Adrian.</p><p>“Stay on the ground, mudblood,” the prankster hissed, his wand still pointing under the desk. “That's where filth like you belongs.”</p><p>Blaise looked at Hermione noting the tightness in her jaw as she continued furiously on her work.</p><p>“What?” she bit glaring at him through the corner of her eye.</p><p>He shook his head catching Theo's disapproving sneer before the other boy returned to his work as well.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> 25 September </em>
</p><p>She kept mumbling to herself.</p><p>She did that a lot he'd come to notice, especially when she was deep in thought.</p><p>Blaise watched her curiously, his brain trying hard to work out her soft indecipherable words. Her quill scratched frantically over her sheet, the answer seeming unable to come fast enough for her liking. The strokes ended, the tip of her quill coming up to her mouth as she double checked her work. She did that a lot too.</p><p>Blaise watched as a small dark spot spread slowly on her bottom lip before realizing he was staring at her again.</p><p>He shook his head turning quickly back to his neglected sheet.</p><p>What was he doing, he silently chastised. Staring? He shook his head again. It wasn't good for his health, he decided, being so close to a muggle-born.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> 27 September </em>
</p><p>“Ahmm.”</p><p>Hermione cringed recognizing at once the sickly sound of the frog woman announcing her arrival. Really, was this year trying to turn her most favorite subject into her most hated class?</p><p>Professor Vector turned around from the front board where she’d only just started demonstrating the problem. She frowned at the ministry representative.</p><p>“Professor Umbridge,” Vector addressed.</p><p>Umbridge tutted negatively. “High Inquisitor.”</p><p>Hermione scowled. “High on something, I’m sure,” she glowered to the table top.</p><p>Blaise glanced at her looking somewhat taken aback; the Gryffindor had a reputation after all of favoring well amongst the staff.</p><p>Professor Vector strained a smile. “High Inquisitor. What do we owe the pleasure?”</p><p>Umbridge grinned, waddling her way to the front of the room. “Follow up inspection. Must ensure proper education is being imparted on all our young minds.”</p><p>A noise came from Hermione's throat catching the attention of the Slytherins in front of her.</p><p>“Carry on,” Umbridge cooed as she perched upon the stool at the front of the room.</p><p>Hermione glared at the overly mauve woman. “Well there's certainly a new meaning to toadstool.”</p><p>Blaise snorted, Draco and Theo shot her incredulous looks, and Hermione realized she’d said the thought aloud.</p><p>It was as much a mental exercise as a physical one to keep her mouth shut the rest of class.</p>
