    <p>
  <span>Staring down the cooling corpses that were sprawled haphazardly across the marble floors filled him with a sort of apathy he had no clue he had the capacity of feeling. 7 years of hardships, tears of joy- friendships and adventures had suddenly gone down the drain as though it was little more than a foggy dream which, with the barest of mentions would have his lips twitching involuntarily with something akin to fondness and yet here he stood, watching their blood seep out on the centuries old floor. Watching as it dried and crusted against their damp clothes, turning to a musty burgundy the longer it stayed exposed to the air around them. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>6 years of stumbling through the ancient halls of Hogwarts and an additional year of running from the utter hell that was the war (which had been pending for far too long) and yet, as Harry gazed upon their faces, frozen as they were in eternal horror, he could not find it within him to care.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Perhaps he should have seen this all coming, after all, these past few days were something of an eye opener to him and their constant fidgeting within his presence made it all the more difficult for him to trust them, though for the sake of their friendship, he restrained himself from saying anything that he might have come to regret later. Had he confronted them earlier, maybe it would have never gotten to this point but if the two people who he had come to trust the very most would attempt something that they had once sworn vehemently against, it really did make him wonder what sort of life he had been living up until this very point. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>That nearly everyone he’d ever made the mistake of getting close to would always betray him in the end, one way or another. The emblem that had appeared on the apple of his cheek now burned with vigour as his verdant eyes washed over the mass of fiery orange hair tangled with once voluptuous curls of brown - things that he’d once remember of his friends with such adoration now only filled him with contempt. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It was disgusting to think that despite his gut feeling, something that had saved his life countless times, he had chosen to trust his </span>
  <em>
    <span>friends </span>
  </em>
  <span>but here they now lay cold on the usually meticulously cleaned marble floors of Grimmauld Place. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“The filthy mudblood and blood traitor deserved it!” A high, yet cold laughter reverberated through the hall, snapping Harry out of his daze. He tore his eyes from the lifeless bodies to locate the voice, nearly faltering when he noticed that it came from a portrait that he was very familiar with. It was Walburga Black that had spoken, Sirius’ mother, but he wasn’t given much time to ponder this fact as another voice soon chimed in, though this was a voice he had not heard in all of his years living in that very same manor. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“To think they believed they could harm a Black in his own home!” His voice crooned with barbarous glee, his laugh cold and ruthless just as it was with all other Blacks, should someone dare to challenge them. The lone Potter snapped his head in the other direction, only for his eyes to meet the steel slate of an old Head of the Black family. It was not Arcturus Black, like he had expected but rather his father, Phineas Nigellus Black, one of headmasters that had graced his former school. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry’s brows knitted together in mild confusion at his words, because while he was technically a Black through his paternal grandmother, he was still a half-blood and as far as he knew, that was more than enough to have the entire family jumping with joy should he have died. Though, now actually thinking back on it, it was most likely the fact that he was the last of the Black line, other than Draco who was pathetically unworthy of the Lordship (the ring had hexed him so harshly, he was in St. Mungos for little over a week) and so his death would mean the end of the Black legacy. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Toujours Pur would mean nothing if the entire family was wiped off the face of the Earth’s surface, he thought with amusement lighting up his complexion, allowing his once darkened eyes to glow dimly with something other than despair for once. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I have to admit-” He began, now speaking to both portraits with a certain confidence in his voice, “That I’ve suspected them for quite a while, though I did hope that our friendship would help ease such thoughts from their mind. But I should have known that they were too weak to understand the sheer importance of my abilities...” He paced, polished dressing shoes clicking against the floor with each step he took, “I should have known that they were too easily controlled by fear that they’d think to raise their wands against me, despite knowing who I am. </span>
  <em>
    <span>What </span>
  </em>
  <span>I have become-!” His voice slowly grew, though it remained firm and collected with not even the slightest of emotions to colour the dull air which surrounded him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“And what, pray tell, have you become..?” Phineas questioned with a cool nonchalance, though the curiosity in his painted eyes gave away his reluctant interest. Although this was their very first interaction with each other, it was not the first time he had seen Harry. He’d seen him first when he was a meek little second year student, accused of such heinous crimes even at the tender age of 12 and yet he refused to bend his neck to the authorities and adamantly defended his innocence - so then again, maybe he wasn’t really all that meek, rather that he was humble. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Because even in his wizened age, and semi-consciousness due to being a portrait and shadow of his former self, he could tell that despite his young age, Harry had already become a worthy adversary, if his triumph over Slytherin’s Beast wasn’t proof enough. Suffice to say, he believed there was not a single thing that this boy could pull out that would surprise him, as he was sure he had seen it all at this point, yet as the boy turned his head to meet his eyes with a leveled stare, he found himself gasping- the noise drowning out with waves of whispers sounding from the dozens of portraits that lined the walls.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span> He watched with stupefied fascination as the glamour fell away from Harry’s cheek, revealing a symbol which had been deemed as little more than folklore among the pureblooded children. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Death’s Mark…” His voice was filled with wonder. Hushed, though it easily silenced all other voices that surrounded them. “You’ve been marked by Death, boy.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>An almost bittersweet smile spread across his healthily flushed cheeks, contrasting against the pitch blackness of the brand on his skin which seemed to swallow every inch of light that it was met with. Harry allowed a soft sigh to slip past his lips, looking back to his former friends with despondency clear in his expression. “..I know-“</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>~~~~~</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <b>
    <em>6 Days After The War, 1 Month Before Present</em>
  </b>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The second the war had been confirmed over, Harry was quick to apparate back to Grimmauld Place in order to maintain some semblance of peace for himself before he had to face the music. He had spent the first day reaffirming the wards and adding some new ones here and there with his own creations before he had finally allowed himself to relax and take a breather from the monstrosity that he had to face in that year while on the run from Voldemort and his Death Eaters.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span> Just one or two days off should do it, he thought to himself with a satisfied hum as he allowed himself to further ease up in the steaming bath he had one of the house elves ready for him. He had a few others purchase some better clothes for himself as well so he’d have something other than his torn rags to wear after he cleaned himself up.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span> After all these years of skulking around as though he were a pauper despite the mountains of gold in his coffers, it was time to splurge a little -  he deserved it, didn’t he? For once, he found himself in the position where he could step back and say that enough was enough, and could take control of his actions without having to worry about the backlash it could have on countless people. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry found that he was becoming stuck with a sort of mindset since he was a little boy which prevented him from ever thinking of himself first, but instead trying his best to fulfil the needs of the people surrounding him, which had probably made him the perfect person to manipulate. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>So, he decided that everyone could wait a little longer for him to get his priorities sorted out, and then, if he felt like it, he’d make a public appearance to strengthen their win. Hell, he’d even testified for Draco's innocence before he barricaded himself from everyone’s sight. But make no mistake, he did not do it out of the kindness of his heart. Well, Harry paused as he rinsed his body of all the suds and grime, maybe he did do it mainly out of the kindness of his heart but their was also the fact that Draco owned him one, and as far as he knew, that was a huge thing among wizards, especially wizards out of Slytherin. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Maybe if he had let the Sorting Hat place him in Slytherin, he would have turned out the same as the rest but here he was, a Snake dressed in garbs that were only meant for the bravest of the Lions - with both bowing to him and only him, even if some of them were once his foes. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The Saviour threw back his head, filling the steamy bathroom with a tinkling laugh which would have many swooning at the sound, regardless of the cruel tone which seeped into the laugh. A half-blood indeed. Who was it that said that having ‘filth’ in your blood wasn’t a good thing? Because the last person to preach such was Voldemort, and he himself was of muggle heritage. You had the bourgeoisie of the Wizarding World, the Pure of the Pure, like the Malfoys- like the Blacks and the Flints. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>You also had the utter Filth of society, like his mother- like Hermione and Ted Tonks, and you had </span>
  <em>
    <span>them</span>
  </em>
  <span>, a category which he and Voldemort shared. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span> “Us..” Harry echoed breathily, pupils dilated with wonder and awe, goosebumps rising on his skin as the lingering natural magic caressed him, crackling against the soft of his cheeks and neck. And you had </span>
  <em>
    <span>them</span>
  </em>
  <span>, the Tainted.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>After that brief mental debacle, he didn’t spend much longer in the water and so slowly dragged himself out of the tub which was twice the size of the prefect baths back at school. He didn’t mind that he was leaving trails of water with each step, knowing that it would be cleaned up soon, and so he picked up his heated down as he began to dab his body free of any water. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry would dry his hair magically but knowing the texture of his hair, it would cause nothing but a disaster so he’d have to towel dry it instead to avoid any struggles with brushing his hair in the morning. As expected, his new clothes had already been washed and heated for him to wear- laid across his four poster bed in a set. Usually, he would have requested his clothes in the bathroom to get changed but when it was the comforts of his own home with no one to bother him, he couldn’t really care. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>From what he could see of the material, it was extremely expensive- probably worth more money than Harry had ever spent in his life- nevermind on one set of robes. It was mainly green, with silver and gold accents that decorated the material tastefully. There was just enough detail to make it worthy of a Lord, though not nearly enough to be considered gaudy. Just the way he liked it. Just as he moved to grab his clothes, a sudden wave of vertigo ran through his body, followed by nausea which he often likened to the feeling of eating far too much at once after years of abstinence. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The next thing he knew was that his knees had hit the floor, arms bracing his head against the side of his bed. “K-Kreacher..?” He found himself slurring his words as blotches of black began to stain his vision. It was a good thing that he had thought to protect his head too, because soon after he had heard the familiar crack of apparition fill his room, his body slumped off the edge and hit the floor, his consciousness ebbing away along with it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>When Harry had eventually come to, it wasn’t in his bedroom that he expected to find himself lying down on but rather a dark abyss which seemed to go on and on no matter which direction he steered himself in. The darkness seemed to engulf him but he didn’t find him succumbing to whatever mind numbing torture this was meant to be. Maybe he had eaten something that had been injected with a potion? He was quick to rid himself of the thought, as practically everyone knew that there was no possible way that someone could have slipped him anything as he had been preparing his own meals these past few days.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Harry~..</span>
  </em>
  <span>”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The former soldier snapped his head around, impossibly green eyes glowing with delirium that hadn’t been present just a moment before. “Who said that?” While his voice remained just barely above a whisper, it echoed through, never quite seeming to reach an end to the darkness he found himself swimming in. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Thousands of thoughts sifted through his mind yet none seemed logical enough fit well enough to describe what was going on. “Answer me!” He demanded, his tone that was once pleasant and demure had changed into firm and commanding - a side that people often saw of Harry during the war. It was either be harsh and firm or be gentle and understanding and get many killed for being so lax in his orders and rules. He had saved many lives as he led the Light side to victory, but that didn’t change the fact that many people still died when it could have been avoided entirely. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It was widely assumed that he had forgiven the now deceased headmaster of countless pass transgressions, his negligence during Harry’s childhood, for example but more importantly the fact that hid such an important piece of information from him since well - second year. Now that he thought back on it, it was probably a smart move on Albus’ side since by the time Harry found out, it was far too late to join the other side in hopes for protection. Albus had left him in a tight spot, though jokes on him, he ended up surviving anyways, and had somehow managed to retain the ability of speaking to snakes - not that anyone knew about that, of course. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Peace, young one. You have pleased Us, Ha-rry~...</span>
  </em>
  <span>” the voice was unlike any other, seeming to have a blend of several different people speaking at once. All separate yet curiously one as they spoke, eldritch whispers filling any empty spaces.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span> By all rights, he should have been unnerved - terrified, even. But at that very moment, he could have never felt so at ease and so comforted all at once. It was all so very bizarre, and had this been any other situation, he would’ve been quick to thrash away, and scream even if no one could hear him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And so, disregarding any logical thoughts, he reached out into the ever growing darkness, searching and seeking for the thing - the person who filled him with such unadulterated joy that everyone else he knew had failed so miserably to achieve.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span> A low keening sound rumbled from deep within him as the desperation to reach consolidation grew stronger by each passing moment, almost becoming unbearable. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Something bitter began to brew deep in the coils of his stomach as he realised just how he was behaving. It was laughable to see how easily he submitted to the first person that made him feel this way; was he so touch starved that he would surrender not for the person who’s been a constant source of terror throughout the entirety of his life, but for an unknown the very second they spoke to him with sweet words. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Had Harry been a lesser man, he would have easily believed that he was weak, but he had been presented with such soothing serenades once upon a time, and he had never - </span>
  <em>
    <span>never </span>
  </em>
  <span>begged for a single thing in his life no matter how sorely tempted he may have been.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>At first it was with the promise of his parents, to which he’d shut down just as fast as it had left his nemesis’ disfigured lips - later it would be with the proposal of becoming great should he have chosen to support 16 year old Tom Riddle in his endeavours, and we all knew how that ended. This was only the tip of the iceberg, but whoever this voice belonged to - whatever it belonged to, it sounded like coming home. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It sounded like utter completion, as though Harry had been waiting for this very moment since the day he left his mother’s womb, cursing the fates that he should be born to a life that would bring him nothing but misery. “</span>
  <em>
    <span>Wake-</span>
  </em>
  <span>” Its breath fanned over his cheek, causing a burning sensation to spread across his skin. The pain wasn’t all too bad, but it was strong enough to have him wake up in his large canopy bed, panting from exertion, though there were no signs of fatigue on his body. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The stinging was still clinging to his skin, and so he hurriedly twisted over to the vanity just across his bed, hands slamming down on the marble dresser as his eyes roved over his appearance. There it was.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>That symbol which had haunted more than half of his year was printed in a thick black, not unlike the inky tartaros his conscience had sent him to. Harry first raised his fingers delicately to touch the marked skin, testing to see whether or not it would smudge under the friction, but when it remained in its position, he had given up any hope that it would ever disappear. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>There was the possibility that it was water soluble, but since he couldn’t even magic the insignia away, the chance of it being erased with hot water and soap seemed very far fetched. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Now, if it had been his 6th year at Hogwart, the first thing he would have done was owl Hermione and the Weasely’s for help. But after fighting in a war, and against his mortal enemy alone for the upteenth time in one decade, he had developed quite a bit of independence, meaning that he wouldn’t contact them unless he was absolutely sure what he was dealing with. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>After being exposed to the Wizarding world, he was quick to learn that he was to expect the unexpected, because the new world that he was opened to hardly fit the norms that were so engraved into his brain, courtesy of the Durselys. As if it were any other people that hid his entire nature from him, he thought with a huff. Running his fingers through his curled locks, he flicked his other wrist to cast a Tempus charm.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span> </span>
  <em>
    <span>21:03, Tuesday.</span>
  </em>
  <span> </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Brilliant, he had been out for a whole day, and then some. Harry was quick to get dressed, making sure to wash his face and brush his teeth before finally leaving his chamber. He brushed his fingers over his branded cheek once more, this time concealing it with a glamour that was keyed into his magic, and his magic only, just to make sure that it wouldn’t fall away if he didn’t intend it to.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span> It was a relatively low-powered glamour, or at least compared to his magic stores, it was - so he wouldn’t have to re-do it until, perhaps, a week later. “Mipsy, send something light for me to eat up to my study.” Harry near grimaced as the words left his lips, feeling something inside of him anguish at the thought of him sounding anything like the pureblooded Lords that he had learnt to hate. He didn’t have anything personal against them, other than the fact that a large majority of them had attempted to kill him once or twice, but Harry didn’t really hold grudges over things like that - it was more out of habit that he seemed to dislike the whole lot. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Flicking off invisible lint from his robes, he proceeded to make his way to the family library, the fine material of his clothes seemingly billow behind him with each step. He wasn’t ignorant to the stares he was getting from those in the portraits, since it was near impossible to notice after all the years that he had been in the building, but it was only till recently that those stares of anger and disgust had turned into something similar to morbid curiosity. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They’d heard whispers, of course, of how this boy had not only escaped the grasp of a dark wizard that an entire generation of Blacks had pledged themselves to, but had managed to actually kill him. This little boy who appeared in their halls, nervous and skittish as he was, with jade eyes brimming with a tale so mournful, most would never meet his gaze out of sheer discomfort. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>How could this young man who walked with the confidence of the most renowned warlocks and emitted the same immense power that reminded them of the Gods they were often taught about as small children be the same boy that was dressed in rags, malnourished and pathetically uneducated in their ways? It was said that war changed everyone for the worst, turning even the most kindhearted of humans into the foulest of beasts, but it seemed that Harry defied all odds. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>‘This was a miracle child’, they’d mutter amongst each other while he was slumbering, now watching him begrudgingly with respect. Although they were adamant that blood still mattered, they had all agreed on one thing. Harry Potter - no, Potter-</span>
  <em>
    <span>Black </span>
  </em>
  <span>was an exception to this very rule, as he were with all other things. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The door slammed shut behind him, several clicks sounded to show that the wards had slotted back into their places with his entrance. A week or two ago, this entire library was covered in more than an inch thick layer of dust, and air was drier than the Sahara on a particularly hot day - trust him, he’d know. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Taking a quick look around, he hummed in approval at the sight of the carefully cleaned and restored shelves. The scent of fresh parchment lingered in the air, hinting to him that the books had probably been remade and printed  just as he had ordered Lola, his personal house elf, to do. It wouldn’t do to have him flicking through ancient tomes, only to have them fall apart in his hands due to his haste.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span> A few days prior, he had made it a priority to search through the library and catalogue all of the books for better use later on, and it was a damn good thing that he did, because looking at the rows and rows of shelves - he just wouldn’t have known where to begin. Harry remembered that the much more obscure books were right at the back, along with layers upon layers of hexes that, had he been new to the layout, he would’ve accidentally tripped up. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The Hallows - that would be categorised as Death Magic, would it not? Harry trailed his fingers along the new spines of the books, eyes flickering over the different titles, and every so often, selecting a book and placing it on the ever growing pile in his arms. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Once he was satisfied with his selection, he turned right back around, almost excited to begin digging through the ancient texts. While his grades from school may state that he is a barely above average student, it was not really the case, for Harry was the type of student who would be guaranteed at least an Acceptable if he didn’t bother to revise for his exams - it was just that nothing the school taught him actually interested him enough for him to put any effort into. So classes History of Magic and Divination were nothing but utter rubbish to him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Potions was a whole mess in and of itself; his experience with Snape left a sour taste in his mouth, and so even when Horace Slughorn had taken over, he hadn’t bothered with any of the potions, which was a real shame considering the amount of potential it actually had. Classes like Defence Against the Dark Arts though, were classes that he was unbeatable in, and he took some pride in the knowledge that no one had come even close to beating the score that he had gotten in his NEWTs. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>While most of his peers had decided to go back to Hogwarts to finish up their last year and to take their finals, he had taken his NEWTs soon after the Battle of Hogwarts ended, wanting to be able to rest as soon as possible before things began to stir up once more. Knowing how pathetic Magical World seemed to be getting by the year, it wouldn’t take too long before someone was slandering his name on the Daily Prophet again.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Once he had finally made it back to his study, he placed the books into one neat pile before sinking into the comforts of his chair. There was food that Mispy had placed down for him, coated in heating charms so there wasn’t really any rush to eat just then. He brushed his hair out of his eyes, clipping them out of the way with a few bobby pins before he finally reached to grab a book from the top of the pile. Harry had actually ordered the books so that the most basic overview was at the top, and the much more intricate, specific branches of Death Magic were closer to the bottom. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>That way he’d be able to work himself through the pile without having to reference other books to expand on some theories that he didn’t quite meet before. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <b>What Is Death? And Why Do We Fear It? </b>
  <b>
    <em>By Klara Lobismah</em>
  </b>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Them-” He absentmindedly corrected, eyeing the dull cover with vague interest. The book would just go over most of the theories that surrounded Death, and nothing to actually do with Death Magic, but he still found himself intrigued. He wondered if Voldemort had ever come across said book, and if it was the reason behind his irrational fear of death? “Only one way to find out..” Harry mumbled to himself, opening up the book and flicking over to the page of contents.</span>
