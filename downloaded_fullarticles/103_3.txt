    <p>Harry opened his eyes slowly to the sound of voices all around him. For a moment, he stiffened, thinking of Voldemort and Death Eaters and war, but then he relaxed as he remembered. He lay motionless on the bed, listening to the voices of his friends and family from the other side of the curtains. </p><p>"Is he awake, 'Mione?" Ron, Harry thought.  </p><p>"No, I don't think so." Hermione's voice, and Harry was so grateful for her presence.</p><p>"Don't you dare wake him up, Ronald!” Ginny snapped fiercely.   </p><p>"But it's been fourteen hours! How can he still be sleeping?" Ron's voice sounded incredulous, and Harry could only imagine his face, and he smiled.</p><p>"I reckon you'd sleep for much longer than that if you'd just died, you stupid git." George's rough voice; Harry almost expected Fred to finish his sentence for him. </p><p>"That's enough, boys. If you can't be quiet you'll have to go back downstairs." Mrs Weasley's voice; tired and sad, but bright enough that Harry was reminded of all his days at the Burrow before the war started. </p><p>He lay there for a moment longer, savouring the final moment of peace, before sitting up and pulling back the curtains, anticipating, and dreading, cries of praise and admiration. Instead, to his delight, there was a second of silence, and then Mrs Weasley leant forward and dragged him into a tight hug. One by one, the others joined in, Ginny first, then Hermione, then, more reluctantly, Ron and George. They stayed that way for a long while, but finally Mrs Weasley let him go and stood back. She held him at arm's length, smoothing down his hair and rubbing mud off his face. He looked at their tired, hollow faces and felt immense guilt.</p><p>"Shacklebolt and Arthur are downstairs. They want to see you." Mrs Weasley smiled, and, behind her, Ron and George straightened with pride. Mrs Weasley opened her mouth to explain. </p><p>"Arthur's been voted Minister of Magic, Harry!" Hermione cried, blushing when Ron rolled his eyes and muttered under his breath. Elbowing him, Hermione continued.</p><p>"There was a vote a few hours ago. Lots of people voted – the Wizengamot, the Order of the Phoenix and the staff of Hogwarts. Quite a few people voted for you, actually, which is interesting because..." </p><p>"We got to vote, Harry! Hermione, Ron, me, Neville and Luna. They said we were war heroes." Ginny interrupted, pushing past Hermione and sitting on the bed next to him. "They were going to wait until you were awake to vote, but we thought you'd vote for Arthur." </p><p>"Didn't think Minister was your style, really," George added, smirking half-heartedly. "Rebel miscreant, maybe, but leader of the British magical world? Maybe not." </p><p>"We were right, weren't we, Harry dear? You would vote for Arthur?" Mrs Weasley asked, nervously wringing her hands. Harry stared at her. </p><p>"Course I would! There's nobody better." </p><p>Everybody relaxed and smiled, and they started to file out of the dorm to join Arthur and Shacklebolt, telling Harry about Bill and Fleur’s new jobs as Curse Breaker for the Ministry. </p><p>***</p><p>"Congratulations, Minister." Harry held out his hand for Arthur to shake, unsure of the correct behaviour when greeting a new Minister of Magic.</p><p> Arthur brushed aside Harry's hand and pulled him into a hug, exclaiming, "Don't be ridiculous, Harry, no need to be so formal." </p><p>After Arthur stepped back, Shacklebolt held out his hand. "Well done, Harry. The wizarding world commends you." </p><p>He studied Harry standing before him, flanked by Ron and Hermione on either side. </p><p>“Sorry, but this is going to get a little formal.” Arthur apologised, gesturing to Shacklebolt.</p><p>"The Ministry has a proposition for the three of you, as three of the most prominent fighters in this war. As I'm sure you're aware, the Ministry has lost a great many officials. And, although in ordinary situations we would hesitate before asking any unqualified wizards to join the government, these are extraordinary circumstances, and you have all proved yourselves worthy." He paused, scrutinising them each, one by one. </p><p>“Harry Potter, in light of your exceptional bravery, morality and strength, not only during the war but the past seven years, the Ministry has come to the conclusion that we would like to offer you a place in the Auror task force, as a senior member. We believe you have a great many talents that will not only allow you to flourish in this role, but will also allow you inspire and educate others. Will you accept that role?” </p><p>Harry stared at him awkwardly, then turned to Arthur, speechless. Arthur smiled encouragingly, but didn’t speak. After a moment, Harry turned back to Shacklebolt. </p><p>“I’m sorry, but I really don’t think I can right now. The three of us have been fighting this war for seven years, and I think I’d like to spend the summer trying to enjoy the peace before I make any decisions at all. But I can’t guarantee I’ll want to join in September, either – I really don’t think I’m suited for war and fighting, after all this.”</p><p>“Of course, Harry. That’s understandable, and there’s no rush.” Arthur said, looking at Shacklebolt, who nodded his agreement. </p><p>"Ron Weasley, your father, as new Minister, and I, as Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, have come to the conclusion that, given your bravery, loyalty and achievements during the war, you would also be an excellent addition to the auror task force. Would you be willing to forgo your last year at Hogwarts and join the Aurors?” </p><p>Ron started to speak, coughed, and tried to speak again. He looked at Harry, and then turned to his father and Shacklebolt. </p><p>“I’m sorry, but I agree with Harry. I just want to forget about war and fighting. Maybe I’ll have changed my mind by September.” </p><p>Shacklebolt and Arthur nodded again, and turned to Hermione. </p><p>“Hermione Granger, in light of both your exceptional contribution to the war and your academic prowess, the senior Ministry officials have unanimously decided, despite your young age and lack of credentials, to offer you the role of Deputy Head of the British Department of International Magical Law. We understand that you may wish to return to Hogwarts to finish your NEWTS, and so we offer you the opportunity to take these exams during your first year in the role, taught by some of the best professionals we have.” </p><p>Harry turned to look at Hermione, whose face had lit up in a glow consisting of furious embarrassment and pride. He knew without a doubt that she’d take the job, and he smiled to think of her as such a powerful figure in the new government. Hermione, in turn, twisted to face Harry and Ron, and, for the first time since Harry had woken up, truly smiled.</p><p>“I’d be honoured to, really, I have so many ideas already. But…can I ask, why me?” </p><p>“We thought given, your experiences with SPEW and your friendship with Remus Lupin, you may wish to change the laws regarding magical creatures.” Arthur said, and a silence fell upon the group. Harry’s chest constricted, and he scrunched his eyes closed. He felt Hermione slip an arm around his waist, and Ron patted his back a few times awkwardly. Harry heard Arthur and Shacklebolt being called elsewhere. Shaking his head, he opened his eyes and stepped back to look at his closest friends. </p><p>“Congratulations, Hermione. You deserve it. Promise me one thing, though?” Harry addressed Hermione, smiling slightly through the pain in his chest.</p><p>“Anything, Harry.” </p><p>“Make it easier for werewolves. Call it Lupin’s Law, won’t you? He needs to be remembered.” His voice shook and cracked. </p><p>“Oh, Harry!” Hermione threw herself at him and wrapped her arms around him, tears filling her wide eyes. For once, Ron didn’t mention her tears or her emotions, and instead stepped into the hug. </p><p>After a moment, they pulled apart and looked into the Great Hall. The bodies had been moved out of the room, and many of the fighters had left, returning home. Any seriously injured Death Eaters had been moved to a secure section of St Mungo’s, and the other surviving Death Eaters had been taken to the cells in the Ministry. People stood in small groups, comforting each other or casting spells to clear the last of the rubble.</p><p>It was a curious thing, Harry thought, to see so many survivors unsure of how to feel, needing to mourn their losses and wanting to finally celebrate victory. He saw Neville, still clutching the sword of Gryffindor, and beside him Luna and Ginny, holding hands tightly. Ginny’s eyes were rimmed with red, and her cheeks were tear stained. Harry thought of Fred and grief rose in his throat, punching a hole in his heart on the way. He saw Bill, Charlie, Percy and George huddled together, faces pale and stricken with grief. He saw the Patil twins mourning the loss of Lavender Brown, and Dean asleep on the floor, Seamus’ head resting on his shoulder, hands tightly clasped in Dean’s lap. He saw the Hogwarts staff stood by Arthur and Shacklebolt. He turned to his right and saw that Ron and Hermione had walked away, towards a bench by the wall, and were holding each other in a tight embrace. </p><p>Harry watched his closest friends and allies mourning those who had died fighting for him, and he started to feel nauseous. Is this my fault? He thought, and he almost retched, sick with the thought that Remus and Tonks, Fred and Colin, and everyone else had died to save him. As he stood in the entrance of the hall, someone started clapping from the other end of the hall, and he couldn’t see who they were. The clapping spread throughout the room like fiendfyre, until the hall and Harry’s ears were ringing with the sheer volume. He forced a stiff smile, unsure of what else to do. Awkwardly he glanced at Hermione and Ron, silently pleading with them to help. Before they could stand, though, the room fell quiet again as they turned away, returning to conversations and spell work. </p><p>“Harry, dear?” Mrs Weasley appeared behind him, “I thought you might want to see Remus and Tonks. I’ll show you where they are, and when you’re done you can find us again.” </p><p>“Can I see Fred, too? I know it’s my fault but…” </p><p>“Harry, it is no-one’s fault but the dreadful men that killed him, and the terrible monster who led them. You are not to blame, dear. Fred knew what he was getting himself into, and I’m sure he’d do it again, with pride, if he could.” Mrs Weasley took his arm with considerable force and led him away, continuing to tell him, in no uncertain terms, that it wasn’t his fault. </p><p>“Mrs Weasley? When I’m done, can we go home?” </p><p>“Of course we can, Harry, dear.”</p>
