    <p>Harry should have know that the moment that the twins learned about what was really happening in his “detentions” with Umbridge that they would be royally ticked off. Don’t get him wrong Ron and Hermione were just as ticked; but he knew he could keep them from doing something reckless. The twins on the other hand?  Pfft. He’d have better luck getting Voldemort to surrender. </p><p>Really it shouldn’t have surprised him. Really it shouldn’t have. Actually if he had been more awake and not so dragged down by….well… EVERYTHING, he may have actually seen it coming. This was Fred and George he was talking about! Since when did they take anyone screwing with their brothers? And as far as those two were concerned, and Harry if he was honest with himself, they all were brothers. </p><p>The older Weasley brothers had pretty much adopted Harry his second year when they broke him out of his aunt and uncles place that faithful summer. Said it on more then one occasion that he was their unofficial adopted brother. So when they found out someone was not only messing with, but also torturing their little brother, and a teacher no less?!?!?! (Snape didn’t count he hated everyone) Well lets say they were not to happy. That had been an eventful morning.</p><p>Harry wasn’t sure who told them. He would have guessed Ron if he didn’t look just as confused when the two had all but yanked Harry away from his breakfast (sleeping next to it really) and pulling his injured hand to them. Both wearing identical looks of such seriousness that any protest that Harry would have given died in his throat. He stayed completely still and quiet as they removed the bandage he’d placed around his hand. He was to shocked to move. To worn down to protest. To be honest he was just to the point of so done with it all that he was numb to it. If he had been in better shape he’d have never let them see. They never would have known.</p><p>George sat beside him shielding him from then other side of the table. From curious classmates and teachers alike. They knew to be discreet as possible. Fred had him turned away from the table so the other tables couldn’t see either. George sat almost on top of him. Pulling him close to not only hold him in place but to give him a shoulder to lean on. Harry appreciated it more then they would ever know. It helped to keep his shaking down to an invisible tremble. George kept an arm around his lower back for support as he waited for his twin to begin.</p><p>Fred held Harry’s injured hand as gently as possible as he examined the white cotton banged wrap. It was fresh so none of the blood from the night before was seen. Unlike the old wrap he took off that morning. The twin held his hand and wrist firmly to keep the trimmers he could feel from Harry at a minimum. He hesitated for only a moment before looking at Harry in the eyes searchingly. Harry wasn’t sure what he was looking for but a moment later Fred turned to his twin and nodded before letting out a tired breath Harry hadn’t realized the older boy had been holding. He then begin the silent process of unwrapping the younger boys hand. </p><p>It only took a minute or two but to Harry it felt like forever before the finally piece was unraveled. George sucked in a startled breath before holding Harry tighter to him. Harry kept his eyes on Fred. For his part Fred kept his face blank and didn’t react outwardly other then to hold Harry’s hand and wrist a bit more firmly for a moment. He stayed gentle as he examined the words cut into Harry’s flesh. His eyes stayed serious but the muscles around his mouth tightened into a harder frown as he stared at the marks. Memorizing the words etched in the once unblemished skin. </p><p>All 3 stayed silent and unmoving for a good 3 minutes. All around them their schoolmates happy chatter continued. Only Ron and Hermione seemed privy to the silent moment between the three. None spoke. Till Fred closed his eyes with  a tired sigh.</p><p>“How?” Fred said quietly. Only loud enough for Harry and George to hear. He didn’t have to clarify what he meant. Harry understood.</p><p>“Blood quill.” Harry answered in a hoarse whisper. Fred’s eyes snapped open in shocked out rage as he stared at Harry’s tired eyes. Those quills were banned. And for good reason. Only used for specialized Contracts and rituals. And even then they were altered to not leave a mark. It was illegal for a minor to even be handed one let alone used on them. And a ministry official not only possessed one but USED it on a minor! She could be jailed for even handing a child a blood quill.</p><p>“How” Fred sucked in a breath before continuing. George was still to stunned to speak.<br/>
“How many times has she made you use that quill.” His voice strained and quiet to keep from shouting out in rage. It wouldn’t do to let the frog of a woman know who was on to her.</p><p>Harry didn’t answer at first. To busy trying not to let the tears burning his eyes fall and to keep his voice steady. He would not give her the satisfaction of breaking him.  Finally he took a shaky breath before answering.</p><p>“I lost count after the 2nd night of lines.” Fred’s eyes closed as he took a calming breath. He couldn’t loose it in front of Harry. Harry didn’t need that. He needed Fred to be strong. He needed to know his pseudo big brother was going to take care of him. </p><p>He opened his eyes to see Harry looking down at his lap. Fred looked at his twin to see the same fire and rage that mirrored his own. They would not let this stand. </p><p>Gently, Fred carefully rewrapped Harry’s injured hand before placing it gently into Harry’s lap. He watched as the way to skinny boy pulled it closer to him to protect it from harm. He still hadn’t looked up and was staring at his lap intently. </p><p>Fred slowly sat like George on Harry’s other side, Ron moving over enough to give his older brother room. He mirrored his brother wrapping an arm around the smaller boy only his were on Harry’s upped back.</p><p>Fred waited for Harry to react. When he did not he learned his head down so only Harry could hear him. Har do you need a moment or a way out of the room for a bit?” Harry hesitated for a moment before Shakely nodding. Fred nodded to him as well before turning to Ron.</p><p>“Get him out of here quietly. Hermione can tell Hagrid where you’re at. He wont mind you skipping his class this once. Take him to an unused classroom if you have to just do it quickly and discreetly.” Ron nodded grimly before pulling Harry to his feet carefully. The younger boy coming with almost meekly. </p><p>“C'mon mate lets get out of here.” Harry only nodded as he and Ron slipped unnoticed from the hall. Fred watched them go before turning to Hermione. She had stayed unusually quiet during the whole exchange not saying a word. She turned to Fred expectantly. </p><p>“Tell Hagrid what ever you have to. But do not tell him about that quill. It will only make it worse for Harry if you do. Tell him Harry was feeling sick if you have to but keep that quill out of it.” Hermione nodded jerkly. She understood. She didn’t like it but understood. This wasn’t something to bring to the gentle giants attention. She wouldn’t have let slip what was going on to the twins after Ron and Harry had gone to bed if she thought a teacher could help.</p><p>“What do you have planned for this?” Hermione whispered hoarsely to the red headed twins. Fred and George looked at each other with identically growing sinister looking smirks. Hermione gave an involuntary shudder when they looked back at her. Fred grinned more at the girls response but it was George who finally spoke.</p><p>“Oh we’ve got a few ideas.”</p><p>No one messed with what they claimed as their own and got away with it for long.</p>
