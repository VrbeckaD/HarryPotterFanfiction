    <p>“I don’t feel too well, Rowan… Go ahead without me, okay?” Y/N called out, voice muffled against her comforter.</p><p>“A-are you sure, Y/N?” Rowan called back, voice unsure. She’d noticed her friend had been acting strange… Well, stranger than usual, which was really telling. Rowan knew something was wrong, but she could never broach the subject. She was a little hurt, Rowan thought she and Y/N told each other everything.</p><p>“Yeah!” Y/N rolled over in bed as Rowan exited the dorms’ bathroom, “If I start to feel really unwell, I’ll go to Madam Pomfrey, okay?” She really needed Rowan to leave, tears starting to leak from her eyes.</p><p>“Okay… Want me to tell the teachers?” Rowan just couldn’t leave her friend if she was feeling unwell, especially if she was trying to hide something by faking sick.</p><p>“No!” A silence, “I mean, I’ve already told Madam Pomfrey, and… she told the rest of the teachers, yeah…” Another pause, then “I’m tired, Rowan, I’d just like to sleep, okay?”</p><p>“Okay…” Rowan lingered at the door for a few seconds, before sighing heavily, “Feel better soon, okay?” A soft click and she was gone.</p>
<hr/><p>“She’s been acting odd lately, and… I’m worried about her” Another bite of her breakfast, Rowan chewed before continuing. “This isn’t like her to just stay in bed, she’d usually just get a Pepper-Up from Madam Pomfrey and go about her day…”</p><p>Bill nodded sympathetically, glaring at the other Gryffindors who’d sneer at Rowan over the color of her tie. Technically, she wasn’t supposed to sit here, but the circumstances called for it. Y/N was acting oddly and Rowan needed to vent to someone, and the presence of the older Gryffindor was comforting.</p><p>“Well, maybe it’s something Pepper-Up can’t fix, y’know?” Bill said through bites of his own breakfast, before his eyes caught movement at the doors to the great hall. A shocked expression overtook Bill’s face, and he dropped his fork, it clattered loudly against his plate, causing a chorus of eyes to look his way.</p><p>“Bill? Are you okay? What-” Rowan asked, before looking over to where his eyes were locked, which evoked a similar reaction from the third year.</p><p>Y/N walked into the Great Hall, shrinking under the stares of everyone there. The reason for the stares was evident, Y/N’s once long hair was haphazardly cut to the skin, thicker in other areas than others. Rowan got up quickly, grabbing her bag and almost running to Y/N.</p><p>“Wha-what happened, Y/N?” Rowan asked, at a loss for words looking from Y/N’s hair- or lack-thereof- back to her face. Y/N blushed furiously, looking away from Rowan. She caught Bill’s eye, and whipped her eyes back to Rowan’s concerned ones.</p><p>“I… Uh… Thought it was time for change, I guess?” It came out as more of a question, rather than an answer. Still blushing Y/N pushed past Rowan and sat down at her House table.</p><p>Rowan and Bill shared a glance, before following her.</p>

  <em>Rowan leaves, however hesitant she may be, she doesn’t need to be here for this. I sigh, heaving myself up, sitting in the middle of the bed, blankets pooling around my waist. Sliding out of bed, I gingerly walk over to the bathroom, god, the floors are cold in the morning…</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Creaking the door open, the sconces light up, enveloping the room in a warm glow. Seeing the familiar room makes me feel at ease, my mind a million miles away.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Shuffling over to the vanity, I take a look in the mirror, eyes flitting over my features, taking in the dark bags rimming my eyes, the sunken look to my face. It’s no wonder Rowan is so concerned for me.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Oh Gods… I can feel the tears welling in my eyes, the choking feeling in the back of my throat making me feel sick. Staring in the mirror as the tears make their way down my cheeks, I want to scream.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Quickly unsheathing my wand, I grab a piece of my hair, pulling it taut against my scalp I yell,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Diffindo!”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The hair floats down into the sink,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Diffindo!”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>A chunk clumps on top,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Diffindo!”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>More hair,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Diffindo!”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>And more…</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Soon a pile of hair surrounds me, breathing heavily, I look back in the mirror, hating the person I see staring back at me.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Shrieking, I raise my fist and before I know what I'm doing-</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Blood runs down my hand, as the glass shatters.</em>
