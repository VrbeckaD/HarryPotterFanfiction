    <p>Looking back her life has been superficial, a mere existence that barely survived. She did what was expected of her, she shut away her dreams and desires turning them into fine crystals to vanish into the invisible cracks in her mind to marry a man she couldn't stand, to carry on the Malfoy name by laying bare for the incompetent fool of a husband and producing an heir. </p>
<p>Draco, her son, her one true meaning in life, the only reason she managed to survive the nightmare that clutched at her very soul. Her boy had white blonde hair and grey eyes that mirrored his father but had his mother's soft and gentle personality and fiery passion that burned so bright once a upon a time, lost among the years of war that stripped away her spirit and soul leaving behind a numb shell.</p>
<p>Two wars that birthed a monster and created child soldiers who had no clue why they were fighting or begin to understand the real reasons behind two megalomaniacs playing chess with innocent lives, using their blind followers as pawn to discard when their uses come to a end all for their own agenda, for their own cause.</p>
<p>She had no choice but to obey and watch while her son was given the foul mark that crawled up his left arm, destroying his flawless creamy skin, forcing him to bow down to a half blooded abomination, a self proclaimed lord that showed no mercy. </p>
<p>Now she was on her knees in the filth, her wrists tightly bound behind her back, her blood dripping down her side splashing onto the cold stone beneath her all while the enemy stood above her weakened form, their wands trained on her.</p>
<p>"I once believed in you Narcissa" the stern witch spoke up finally breaking the uncomfortable silence, her wand digging harshly into the bound prisoners throat.</p>
<p>Narcissa gritted her teeth to stop the whimper escaping as she straightened her spine to look her former Transfiguration professor in the eye "only a fool would believe in a Black" she spat out, blood dribbling down her chin, the wood digging deeper into her flesh.</p>
<p>"Oh my how the mighty has fallen" someone from behind the blonde shouted out "no one to save you now witch".</p>
<p>She flinched back as a rather famaliar looking dark haired woman knelt down beside her, someone from her past, someone that betrayed her, someone that managed to get away leaving her behind "let me help you" was all the older woman said, barely able to look her in the eye. She pulled away from the intrusive hand, wincing as her wound pulled her skin open, warm liquid soaking her ruined robes.</p>
<p>"Even now you would rather suffer than accept my help".</p>
<p><em>You left me, you left me behind with her </em>Narcissa wanted to scream out but instead she bit her tongue, choking back the blood that began to bead up from the cut left behind by her tooth. A pureblood must keep their emotions in check otherwise your weaknesses can and will be used against you.</p>
<p>"<strong>Andy where are you going?" a fourteen year old Narcissa impatiently asked sitting perched on the bed, watching her older sister pack her small bag, tears streaming down her face.</strong></p>
<p>
  <strong>Andromeda scowled "I can't stay here anymore Cissy" the sixteen year old turned to face her youngest sister "please trust me but I can't stay if mother or father found out I could lose.." she trailed off, placing a hand over the slight bump under her robes.</strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>"Your leaving me behind for a mudblood just like Bella said you would" Narcissa retorted, angrily swiping her tears away. "I hope he's worth losing me over" hatred laced every word "I hate you Andromeda". Fury raced though her blood the stupidity of her sister lowering herself to filth and the unthinkable of getting pregnant with his spawn pushed Narcissa to lash out at her beloved sister.</strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>The full force of Narcissas attack left her sister crippled in pain at the bottom of the grand staircase. "Never come near me again you filthy mudblood lover".</strong>
</p>
<p>"Did you lose the child? All those years ago" Narcissa asked.</p>
