    <p>
  <span>It was early 1989 and Remus Lupin was still feeling rather lost.  Two of his best friends had been murdered, and his on-again-off-again boyfriend was in Azkaban, responsible for the whole mess.  The Order had disbanded, all of his fellow members went back to normal lives, but Remus was left all alone. He had no purpose. Heartbroken and deeply depressed, he trudged through his days just trying to make ends meet, which was a challenge to say the least.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>On the fourteenth of May Remus received an owl from his old Order friend Dumbledore.  It just said, “Top Secret, Come At Once. P.S. I like chocolate frogs” Remus grabbed his threadbare coat and headed out the door.  He could use the fireplace at the local wizarding pub to get to Honeydukes and use the secret passage to get into Hogwarts.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Upon presenting himself in the headmaster’s office, having used the password Chocolate Frogs, Remus was greeted with a smile and a warm hug from Albus Dumbledore.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m glad you made haste Remus.  I’ve got a very special mission for you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The Order has been disbanded.  I thought our mission days were over.” Remus replied.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, but this is important, and you are specifically qualified for the role.” Dumbledore continued, “As you are acutely aware, lycanthropy and poverty seem to go hand in hand.  I mean no offense of course.” Dumbledore glanced at the patched and deteriorated coat Remus was holding. “Furthermore, when people talk of werewolves the stories are almost exclusively European.  It would seem that Americans with lycanthropy have somehow managed to remain more secreted, and, though they have similar numbers per capita as we do here, there seems less of a disparity in wages and living spaces.  I’ve made contact with someone across the pond, and they’re willing to talk to you about these things. I think if you could spend some time there and learn how things are handled differently, perhaps you could bring some new information back with you.  Perhaps working with the Americans can improve the quality of life for those folks living with lycanthropy here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Remus stared at his feet.  He liked the idea of improving the way werewolves were treated, but he was hesitant to commit to infiltrating a werewolf den halfway around the world in an area he’d never been to and would have no back up if things went poorly.  “How long are we talking about?” Remus tried to sound more confident than he felt.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“At least a month, possibly more if you are getting good information.  They’ve set up a safe house for you to handle your transformations, and you’ll have an American guide available to help you with the culture shock.  It’s a wildly different place than we’re used to here.” Dumbledore smiled inwardly as if remembering some long-forgotten memory.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Remus had to admit, it’s not like he had any other plans.  He struggled to keep jobs with his moon sickness, and moved frequently to avoid suspicion when he’d miss several days of work in a row, but only ever around the full moon.  He was constantly trying to come up with new excuses to explain away his new injuries and scars. Perhaps it wouldn’t be so bad to spend time somewhere else. Sheepishly, Remus traced his fingers over the patchwork on his coat, “I can’t afford the trip right now, but I’d definitely be interested in learning more.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“They will provide you with food and shelter, and I took the liberty of ordering you new clothing.”  Dumbledore opened a cupboard door, pulling out a suitcase. He set it on his desk and opened it revealing several sets of clothes, two new pairs of shoes, and a bag of toiletries.  “Since you’re already packed, I see no sense in delaying your departure.” He closed the suitcase with a click and handed it to Remus.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I can’t possibly accept this.  Those clothes are worth at least a months wages.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Then you’ll have to go on this mission to repay the debt.” Dumbledore smiled.</span>
