    <p>“We have to stop this”</p><p>Harry rolled over to face his en suite, where he was met by a slightly damp blond who was drying his hair.</p><p>“I thought that was my line?”<br/>
Draco smirked and shook his head. “I’m serious, Potter. You’re still convinced you’re <em>straight</em>, and I want someone who isn’t afraid to be with me”.</p><p>Harry rolled onto his back. He knew Draco was right. In all fairness, he still wasn’t entirely sure how this whole thing had started. It was back at the start of the summer, the war had ended and Harry had decided to return Draco’s wand. The other boy had invited him in, one thing had lead to another and he had lost his virginity. Things just spurred on from there.</p><p>Once school had started up again for their “8th year” Harry had told himself it had to end, he and Ginny had taken up their relationship again in late August.</p><p>That had all been promptly thrown to the wind as Harry had proceeded to drag Draco into his private rooms and fucked him <em>senseless</em>.</p><p>His private rooms had probably been one of the main things that spurred them in for so long. The few of them that had returned for their 8th year had been put in a separate tower and only shared a room with one other student instead of 4.</p><p>Being named the Saviour had meant that Harry hadn’t had to share with anyone else, and had a double room to himself. Draco’s room also happened to be right above Harry’s so it never looked suspicious when they walked down to the common room, even if they did look <em>flustered</em> from time to time.</p><p>Deep down Harry had known Draco wouldn’t want to keep going. They’d been back for a month and Harry was still refusing to come out and was adamant they had to stay secret, and he knew Draco deserved better.</p><p>Harry stood up just as Draco was tying his tie. “You’re right, this has gone on long enough.” The Slytherin straightened up and looked at Harry.</p><p>“I won’t deny that it’s been fun, Potter.” Harry nodded. </p><p>“Even if you do find someone, we both know no one can top me” Harry said rather cockily, in a rubbish attempt to stop him leaving.</p><p>Draco smiled, which caused Harry to blush. “Well, I do have my eye on a rather dashing 6th year Ravenclaw, who’ll be able to top <em>me</em> just fine”.</p><p>Draco smirked at him. Harry just stared.</p><p>The Slytherin took that as his sign to leave and turned to leave to the common room.</p><p>“Goodbye then, Potter.” His word hung between them for only seconds before Harry lurched forward and connected Draco’s lips with his own as he held the Slytherins jaw, whose on hands were pressed to Harry’s chest. Finally, they broke apart, both panting. Harry rested his forehead against Draco’s and sighed.</p><p>• • </p><p>He didn’t want it to end, he didn’t, he knew he didn’t, but Draco couldn’t bear having the most amazing sex with Potter, and then watch him walk right back to the Weaslette and hate him once more. He was <em>Draco Fucking Malfoy</em> and he deserved more than that.</p><p>Draco had walked right out of the tower after Harry had kissed him and stormed into the great hall, where his fellow Slytherin 8th years greeted him for breakfast with questioning looks.</p><p>“Blaise, darling, how is your cousin Jacob?” Draco smiles at his friend sweetly who scowled in return. “He’s no better than I am, Draco. You know I’m better suited to you” Pansy giggled. “Darling, Draco doesn’t want a man who’s desperate for him, he likes a challenge”. Blaise shook his head.</p><p>Jacob, was the 6th year Ravenclaw whom Draco had set his sights on. He looked quite similar to his cousin but his skin was a darker and his hair was thicker and longer than Blaise’s. All in all, he was gorgeous. </p><p>“Draco, he’s looking over here” informed Pansy, to which Draco turned his head slightly and met the gaze of the grinning sixth year. Draco flashed him his own perfect smile before winking and turning back to his friends. “Yes, he’ll do just fine” Pansy burst into a fit of laughter at the jealousy set on Blaise’s face, who promised Draco he’d get him into bed before too long. </p><p>At that moment Harry strolled in for breakfast and was swept right into the arms of the female Weasley. Draco tried no to look up but couldn’t help it, and when he did he found the emerald eyes already boring into him. He couldn’t stand it. He was going to make Potter regret not choosing him.</p><p>He rolled his eyes at the Gryffindor and stood up, seeking the attention of his Ravenclaw who, he was pleased to see, was already heading over to him.</p><p>Draco swept around the end of the table to greet the 6th year, who had planted a wide grin over his face in an attempt to hide the nervousness in his eyes. 

“Jacob” Draco purred with a sultry smile. The 6th year was quite a bit taller than Draco, probably evenly matched with Potter who had finally caught up and now towered over Draco.</p><p>“I was wondering if you’d like to go to Hogsmeade with me this weekend? There’s a French restaurant just opened that I thought you might like to try” Draco let his smile travel up to his eyes which caused a satisfying blush to spread over the other boy’s face. Draco knew if he looked over to the Gryffindor table he’d be met with rage filled green, but he had to act as though Potter was nothing to him.</p><p>“Merveilleux! That would be perfect, how about you swing round to the 8th year common room tonight?” He fluttered his long lashes as he spoke. The other boy light up and agreed he’d be round after his quidditch practice. Oh yes, this was going to be <em>good</em>. </p><p>Draco’s mood did nothing but improve over the day as he continued to notice the glares his ex lover was shooting him.</p><p>• •<br/>
<em>Outrage</em>. Utter outrage was all that Harry could feel throughout the day. They’d only ended their little arrangement this morning and Draco had already moved on? It was unacceptable. To top it off, Draco had been ignoring the looks Harry had been giving him <em>all</em> day. It wouldn’t stand, and Harry would just have to do <em>something</em> about it.</p><p>• •</p><p>The time neared 8 o’clock when Draco had just finished getting changed. He looked irresistible, and he knew it. The shirt showed of his sharp figure, and the tight muggle jeans (Dolce and Gabbana mind) shaped his assets quite nicely. Just as he was ready to leave, Blaise entered their dorm.</p><p>“Evening Darling, where’ve you been?” Draco turned to Blaise who took a step forward to Draco and cornered him up against his wardrobe. “What about him makes him so much <em>better</em> than me?” Draco looked up into the steely eyes that bore into him and took a minute to contemplate the question.</p><p> “Nothing, Blaise. You’re gorgeous, you <em>know</em> that. But we’re not the right fit for each other.” He rested a hand against the other boys cheek. “So,” Blaise purred in his usual seductive tone, “have you ever thought about us having sex?” A smirk played on his mouth as he asked. Draco rolled his eyes. “I promise that one day I will let you ravish me to your hearts content. But <em>until</em> then, I have someone I’m meant to be entertaining.”</p><p> His friend moved away from him and towards the bathroom. “Have fun, but please, for the love of all things Slytherin don’t fuck him in here”. Draco threw his head back as he laughed. “I promise. Does this mean you’re over me now?” Blaise turned to him. “I’ll never be over you, Darling, but I have found a rather delicious 6th year Gryffindor to sedate my needs” Draco mocked insult. “Blaise Zambini! We do not do Gryffindors” He chuckled. “I know, I know, but she’s a right little sort and the sex is good”.</p><p>• •</p><p>“Jacob!” Draco exclaimed as he entered the common room. A few heads turned in his direction as he embraced the Ravenclaw. “Draco, il est injuste que vous obtenez tous les bons!”</p><p> (It’s unfair that you get all the good ones!)</p><p>Pansy joked as the two joined Draco’s fellow Slytherins. “Tout est juste dans l'amour et la guerre” </p><p>(All is fair in love and war)</p><p>He replied. Jacob looked at him questioningly. “It seems Pansy here would rather like you for herself, Jacob.” The 6th year raised an eyebrow. “Unfortunately, I am rather taken by your Slytherin prince.” He leaned back into the sofa and used his hand to indicate that Draco should fill the gap next to him. He happily complied.</p><p>• •</p><p>The library was quiet when the trio settled down at one of the big oak tables. Harry sighed as he finally finished his potions essay. There were at least 10 spelling mistakes and half of it was complete shit, but he didn’t care. Hermione and Ron both looked up at him when he started packing up. “I can’t concentrate on anymore homework, guys, so I’m just going to go to bed” Ron nodded and Hermione looked at him pitifully but nodded anyway. “Before you go Harry, if you see Pansy in the common room could you give her this?” She handed him a book that seemed to be written in a different language. “Why can’t you give it to her?” The girls were now roommates, and surprisingly, friends.</p><p>“I’m not going to be coming back to our dorm tonight”</p><p>“Oh”<br/>
…<br/>
“OH”<br/>
…</p><p>“Goodnight Harry”</p><p>“Night guys”</p><p>• •</p><p>“Right I’m off guys, see you tomorrow” The dashing Slytherin announced upon entering the common room. Blaise winked at Pansy as she started to ask where he was going, but Draco nudged her as a hint.</p><p>“Oh, ‘scuse me Potter”</p><p>Draco’s head snapped round to the door.</p><p>“No worries”</p><p>The Gryffindor strode into the room, shirt untucked and tie askew, and walked right up to the Slytherins.</p><p>“Pansy?” He spoke, completely ignoring her fellow Slytherins. The black haired girl perked up at him. “Yes Potter?” He handed the book over to her. “‘Mione said to give this to you, and to tell you she’ll be sharing Ron’s bed tonight” Pansy gasped before giggling. “Good for her! Thanks for this, Potter.” Harry nodded at her before turning to the stairs.</p><p>• •</p><p>Harry tumbled into his room and sought out the switch so he could get changed into more comfortable clothes. He pulled off his shirt and trousers when he remembered that he’d lent his defence notes to Seamus and he needed them back.</p><p> He decided to just pull on a pair of grey joggers, he didn’t feel the need to bother with a shirt.</p><p> He paced over to his mirror to<br/>
look at himself. He’d evened our quite well over the last year and grown a good 6 inches. He was no longer so scrawny, but now had broad shoulders and muscles had formed up and down his limbs. He’d put in some extra work and now had a quite good six pack. </p><p>His fingers trailed over his chest, the line of hickeys from the night before still clearly visible. He reached up to his collar bone where they started, and reached down to the waistband of his joggers where they ended. He smirked, oh yes, Draco would know <em>exactly</em> who the bite marks belonged to.</p><p>He strolled back down to the common room and initially ignored the gasps as people noticed his toned torso. He knew Draco had seen him, <em>and</em> the hickeys. He tore up the stairs to Dean and Seamus’ room.</p><p>• •</p><p>“Jesus Christ, The Saviour got hot, apparently. When did that happen?” Pansy babbled on. “Looks like his Weasley and he have a good time.” Jacob chuckled. Draco looked up at him. 
“I hear the Weasley’s quite a prude actually” Jacob gave him a surprised look. “An affair with the chosen one. Wonder who the lucky woman is”.</p><p>• •</p><p>Harry knocked on the door and heard a muffled yell from Seamus. “Come in!” Harry watched as Seamus hastened to cover himself. “Alright, Harry?” He said with a flustered face. Harry smirked at him. “Yeah, I just need my Defence notes back” </p><p>“Oh right, yeah they’re on the desk over there.” Harry chuckled and the shuffling in the Irish boy’s bed. “Thanks, mate” Harry said as he turned back to him.</p><p>“No problem. Goodnight Harry”</p><p>Goodnight Seamus, Goodnight Dean” Harry laughed at the gasps he heard as he exited the dorm. He wondered when that had happened.</p><p>Harry strolled back towards his own dorm while keeping his eyes trained on the Slytherins he was fast approaching. He could feel them openly staring at him and met Draco’s eyes, which proceeded to narrow.</p><p>“Potter, since my room is free tonight you could always stay with me, I’m sure I could give you some much <em>prettier</em> hickeys” Harry turned to face a sultry eyed Pansy and chuckled heartily.</p><p>“Thanks, Pansy, but I quite like the ones I’ve got” he glanced over at Draco and the Ravenclaw. “It’s nearly curfew by the way, Ravenclaw”</p><p>Jacob nodded. “Thanks, Gryffindor. I don’t think we’ve been formerly introduced. Jacob Zambini”  The boy made no move to properly introduce himself with a hand shake, so Harry just nodded at him. “Well, of course you already know who I am. Goodnight”.</p><p>“Potter, the offer still stands!-“</p><p>Goodnight Pansy”</p><p>• •</p><p>Draco kissed Jacob lightly on the cheek as they said goodbye, he was quite lucky really as Potter was right, it was very nearly the 6th year curfew.</p><p>He took the stairs slowly, and noticed Potter’s door was open as he reached the second floor. Draco didn’t really mean to poke his head into the dorm, but he had. Now he was pressed against the door on the closed side and knew he should’ve just gone to bed.</p><p>“I think you’re forgetting who you belong to, Malfoy” said a husky voice near his year. He moaned into his captor as he felt a strong leg push between his own.</p><p>• •</p>
