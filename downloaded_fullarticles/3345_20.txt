    <p>You slowly woke up with the worst headache of all your 16 years life experience. <br/>For a moment you lay, eyes shut painfully, just listening to the regret pumping through your brain cells. Thum, thum, thum, ... <br/>Ever so slowly you gained consciousness over the rest of your body. There was a soreness in your throat when you swallowed and with no doubt your breath must smell of sin and misery. It was accompanied by the tingling sensation of your arm being half-way cut off from your blood circulation. <br/>A sour feeling was floating in your stomach, you noticed with an internal groan which soon turned into an external one when you chilled at the suddenly persistent weirdness between your legs. It wasn't the sweet ache you'd discovered years ago when thinking of the touches you might share one day with handsome strangers but rather like someone had taken sandpaper to it only to gush jello on right after.<br/>The thought made you slightly gag and you turned onto your back. <br/>It was only then that you noticed the weight that was causing disruption to your arms blood circulation. <br/>Wide eyed you stared at the red haired head of a person peacefully sleeping on your arm.<br/>Or rather a man sleeping on your arm. The thought cursed once through your entire body. This was not one of your half-awake boy next door fantasies. This was a man and he smelled disgustingly of sweat and liqueur. <br/>Suddenly wide awake you jump out of your bed with an unbecoming yelp. Your head was screaming at you while your eyes watched the man move in his sleep. <br/>Slowly your head let you know something just as important. This was not your bed. In fact this was a room you had never seen before. Your body might have been slow but your emotions weren't and full blown panic was mixed into your confusion and pain. <br/>The red head was moving again andÂ  your eyes snapped up to be met by his. He looked at you, his eyes changing from sleepy to displeased to a sparkle and soon enough he seemed to join you in confusion. He opened his mouth right when you were distracted from his gaze by a sensation down in your private parts. Looking down at yourself you realised what had caused the sparkle in his eyes. You were completely naked and the sensation was something dripping from you. <br/>Your shocked head was unable to wrap your around the facts and your ears were momentarily deaf. Thankfully your brain was well enough to find an escape and you rushed to the fireplace with floo powder on top of it and off you were. Back to your own room where you'd be safe to think and have a much needed shower. <br/>What in all hell had happened yesterday?</p>
