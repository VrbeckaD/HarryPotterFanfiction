  <u>McKenna POV:</u>
</p>
<p>I studied my face in the mirror. My straight, white blonde <a href="https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/393431717442270419/" rel="nofollow">hair</a> shone over my shoulders while my sapphire <a href="https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/351632683378006905/" rel="nofollow">eyes</a> gleamed with something akin to hatred. I have always despised my hair colour, a constant reminder of my family name. <em>Malfoy.</em></p>
<p>My father, Lucius, believes that only those of pure blood are true magical beings and those who are born from muggle families and half-bloods are nothing but scum. When I was younger, I truly believed in his views and repeated everything he told me about the family values, no matter how vulgar they were. It was only when my younger brother, Draco, began copying my actions that, I heard the truth of those words for what they were, lies. <em>Mudbloods and blood traitors and half-breeds</em>, my father would say, my mother, Narcissa, would just nod along in agreement; <em>of course she would, she was once a Black,</em> whilst my brother would simply sneer at the thought of being in proximity of, Merlin forbid, a muggle. I learned to hide my true feelings of course, my father once caught me treating our house-elf Dobby with something other than cruelty, I even made him laugh and of course, that would not do.</p>
<p>I subconsciously rubbed my cheek where I remembered the dark bruise that my father marked me with that day. I was 7 years old at the time and to this day I remember wearing that bruise like a badge of honour. The memory of the pain reminds me everyday that the only person Lucius Malfoy loves is himself. It saddens me to think that my brother is becoming more and more like him everyday. However, it doesn't matter, he is still my brother and I love him more than anything. Well, almost anything. My little sister, Lyra, is four years younger than me and I can already see that she is the opposite of Draco. She is gentle and kind and compassionate; a little too compassionate. More than once I have caught her sneaking food to the house elfs whom my father only allows to eat when they have fulfilled all their duties for that day. Unfortunately, father caught another one of our house-elves, Tilda, eating a pumpkin pasty my sister had given her earlier that day. Before the elf could reveal my sister however, I told my father it was me. I will always put my siblings first no matter the cost. This earned me another bruise and a threat. I simply gave him my signature cold look. Many find it intimidating, but not my father, <em>not after being a servant of the great Lord Voldemort</em>; which he of course, is apparently to cowardly to admit as Azkaban it not as luxurious as Malfoy Manor, <em>I'll beg to differ.</em></p>
<p>I chuckled softly. I once loved this house, believing it to be a maze of mysteries and adventure. When we were younger I would take Draco and Lyra out on the grounds to search for trolls. All we found were garden gnomes that were very rude in my opinion, until they said my father could model for sleek-easy hair lotion. Our hysterical laughter was cut short by our father ordering us to go back inside to study. That always seemed to happen, we would find joy only for our father to snuff it out. Draco would brush it off, but I saw how bothered he was by it. Lyra on the other hand would throw a tantrum, complaining about never being able to have fun. I, being always stuck in the middle, calmed her. Over the years I attempted to teach her how to keep calm and school her features to a blank mask. No good came of it.</p>
<p>It is why I am now staring anxiously at the mirror, clutching my acceptance letter to Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry. <em>What will happen to her now that I will be gone, Draco won't help. </em>As much as he loves her, he holds the same expression as our father when she disagrees with their nasty comments about muggleborns. <em>He will definitely be in Slytherin.</em> Another worry; Lyra hasn't got a mean bone in her body, it isn't possible for her to be sorted into Slytherin. I, on the other hand, do possess Slytherin traits. I wouldn't dare not lest facing my father's wrath even more than usual.</p>
<p>"Kenna, are you ready to go?" My mother asked.</p>
<p>"Yes, mother. Are Draco and Lyra coming too?" I would hate to be stuck with father alone whilst buying my school supplies.</p>
<p>"Draco is visiting his friend Gregory, but your sister is joining you and your father." <em>Friend, more like follower.</em></p>
<p>"Okay, coming."</p>
<p>My mother smiled at me and left. I went downstairs to find my father and Lyra waiting for me, a little impatiently. I winked at Lyra and silently took my father's arm. An uncomfortable feeling in my stomach emerged as we disapparated to Diagon Alley.</p>
