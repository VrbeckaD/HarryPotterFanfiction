<hr/><p>Oh to be young and feel love’s keen sting.</p><p>How could one be so blinded by love to not notice such strong signs of warning.</p><p>Infatuation and a hope for something that could never be.</p><p>Albus had known Graves since they had been children. He was arrogant and prideful, the love for himself was only matched by those in the town.</p><p>Even knowing this, Albus had fallen for his charms just as everyone else.</p><p>What charms you ask?</p><p>Graves also seemed the perfect specimen of a gentleman, strong and brave. Though still young he had already fought hard for his kingdom and  was a celebrated hero.</p><p>And to such a small town, that alone was enough.</p><p>So how lucky was it when Graves had come to Albus, of all people, on that day. He could hardly believe his great fortune when he opened the door, “Graves?” Albus questioned, for how could he not be surprised the town’s pride had come for a visit.</p><p>The familiar man stood begore him looking terribly out of breath, “Albus.” He panted.</p><p>At the sound of his name, Albus’s heart felt near ready to stop. However would he survive their conversation?</p><p>“Dear, Albus.” Graves began once more, after catching his breath, “I can but only stay a moment.” He looked over his shoulder, “But I have come to give you this.”</p><p>Albus looked down at the hand extended to him. There a pendent lay in wait for him to take, it seemed to glow with a certain kind of magic. The pendent was unlike anything he had ever seen.</p><p>“What is this?” Albus asked, taking it slowly and without a second thought before looking back into green eyes.</p><p>“A gift.”</p><p>Albus smiled, a strained smile, his emotions mixed somewhere between uncertain surprise and joy, “And why may I ask?” He did not wish to appear ungrateful, but he had always been inquisitive.</p><p>Graves seemed a bit taken aback by the question. It was most unexpected as most seemed to simply accept his words.</p><p>And so he was quick to make himself clear.</p><p>In a single and fluid motion, Graves pulled the other into a kiss.</p><p>Blue eyes went wide at the force pressed against his lips. It was not at all what he expected a first kiss should be like. And though Albus would have been lying if he were to say he had not dreamed of this… at the moment he found himself unable to feel anything.</p><p>There was no care or elation. It was merely pressure.</p><p>But he felt himself unfit to question himself further, counting himself lucky to just have been seen by him.</p><p>“Keep it safe for it is a family heirloom.” He almost begged, “Be sure it does not come to harm.” Graves pulled away before Albus could even gather his thoughts enough to respond, already turning toward the door to leave.</p><p>Albus reached out for him, every question that had run through his mind rising to his lips all at once, “I still don’t- I don’t understand.”</p><p>“I will explain all to you soon. But I really cannot stay.”</p><p>And with that Albus was left alone, the door still open in front of him, the only sign that Graves had been there at all.</p><p>Albus raised a hesitant fingered to his lips, feeling the pressure of them just as lips had once been. And finally he felt…</p><p>Albus’s heart beat far too quickly for his mind to focus on anything but that lingering feeling.</p><p>“It couldn’t be… could it?” How lucky he was that the very first love he had felt now seemed to be requited. It was like a dream. Albus looked down at the pendent, a diamond shaped vial with a single nail through it’s length. He turned it over and over in his hand, feeling it’s strange warmth. It was as though it was alive, a heat pricked at his skin like small needles.</p><p>The sensation only grew and grew until the vial seemed to scorch his hand. Albus released the pendent on instinct, clutching a now scarred hand close to his chest for comfort.</p><p>The pendent struck the floor, letting out a blinding red light. It blinded him, sending him stumbling back.</p><p>He hesitantly opened tear-filled eyes. Albus collected himself enough to look down at the pendent. It had been shattered into an uncountable amount of pieces.</p><p>Albus dropped to his knees, franticly trying to pick up the various fragments.</p><p>What had he done?</p><p>In his haste a particularly sharp piece punctured his skin. He winced as blood leaked from the wound.</p><p>It hurt so deeply. Albus could hardly stand the pain as it coursed though him. He felt as though his very heart would betray him and simply refuse to beat.</p><p>He cried out but no one came to his aid.</p><p>And who would.</p><p>Albus caught his breath, pleading with his body to not fail him.</p><p>How terrible that the gift he had received from the one he loved he had destroyed within minutes. He had to tell Graves.</p><p>Albus slowly moved, still feeling horribly disoriented from the pain. He made his way to Graves’s home not a few houses away.</p><p>
  <strong>Knock Knock</strong>
</p><p>Albus hoped he would be there.</p><p>A response came almost immediately.</p><p>Graves opened the door slowly, his usually strong voice now quivered at him, “Wh-“</p><p>“Graves, I- I” Albus tried, but he could not find the words, the realization dawning on him that he may possibly lose his friend, the one he loved so dearly and who finally loved him in return.</p><p>“Albus?” Graves seemed shocked by the sound of his voice.</p><p>The man in question only ignored him, “I-“ He took a deep breath, once more lifting a silent prayer for the other not to hate him, “I broke the pendent.”</p><p>“What.” Graves’s voice seemed to hitch as he finally opened the door in its entirety.</p><p>“I’m so sorry. It meant so much to you and I-“</p><p>That strain in Graves’s voice became a light chuckle, his lips curving ever so slightly as he shook his head in disbelief.</p><p>“Graves?” Albus question, fearing the loss of the heirloom had driven the other into insanity. He put a comforting hand on the other’s arm, “I am so sorry.”</p><p>“I’m glad I didn’t hold onto it then.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Graves did not seem the least bit angry. Instead he leaned away from the touch, resting against the door. In fact, he seemed relieved, “Better you than me. You look terrible my friend.”</p><p>He laughed once more at Albus’s confused expression.</p><p>“Come look?” He put a hand around the other’s shoulder, guiding him inside and to a grand mirror.</p><p>Albus jumped at the image he saw reflected there.</p><p>There was Graves and … a beast.</p><p>The creature looked like no beast known  to man, a mixture of animalistic features and … a human.</p><p>Albus reached to his face, finding the beast do the same.</p><p>“How did this happen?” Albus asked himself, turning to Graves for any kind of answer.</p><p>“I should have known better than to take from that witch.”</p><p>“Witch?” Albus pulled away, “It was not from your family?”</p><p>“Why would it be?” Graves returned the question, “I had worried that the witch would take my prize back so I had to leave it somewhere …safe.” He motioned to his friend, “But it seems as though that is not what I should have been worried about. Something to note for the future.”</p><p>“You will help me though.” Albus spoke hopefully despite his body feeling frozen, as though it already knew the answer, “We will go to the witch together and you will explain, I will protect you from any ill will she may have toward you.”</p><p>“You already have protected me.” Graves caressed the other’s deformed cheek, “You can rest easy with that knowledge.”</p><p>“So you will do nothing.” Albus asked, “You will leave the one you love this way?”</p><p>“Love?” Graves snorted, “Love is not something that exists as you believe. You are as naive as you are …were beautiful.”</p><p>Albus knock the hand away from his face.</p><p>To safe face he turned, walking away from the one he had once idolized.</p><p>Leaving the house and entering the street, Albus walked on, unsure of where he was headed. A woman on the street backed away from him. And Albus was reminded…</p><p>He was a monster, revolting and unloved, that which he had always feared.</p><p>His walk turned into a run and he ran as far away as he could, never wishing to return to this place that held his shame.</p><p>Finally Albus found himself hidden deep within the woods that outline the village. He had been running until he could no longer find breath or motivation to push him any further. He found rest on a fallen tree.</p><p>The young man sat there for some time, deeply inhaling the fresh air of the forest.</p><p>A magical property was held in the woods around him, similar to that which he felt within the pendent.</p><p>The crinkling of leaves brought his attention upward.</p><p>A woman stood not all that far from him, her cloths were well worn but of the highest quality, “So you are the thief.” She spoke, walking toward the man.</p><p>Her eyes were unfeeling, they looked into his own now red from tears.</p><p>“Have you nothing to say for yourself?” She asked.</p><p>And Albus knew that this was the witch Graves had spoken of. He only shook his head, hating himself for not wishing to give Graves away to the woman’s wrath, even after everything he had done.</p><p>“You were a fool to steal from me. I sense the magic still on you, running through your veins. What purpose did you have for the vial that it was worth your peace?”</p><p>There was no response.</p><p>“No matter, you have your punishment. Solitude as a monster.”</p><p>“I am best alone.” Albus finally spoke, “That is no punishment.”</p><p>“Oh?” The witch asked amused, “How brave you are to let me know that I have not yet done enough.” She lean down,  “Then, my dear, I wonder what is, what could have made you steal such a precious thing from me and what punishment might be more suited. I could have sworn I sensed vanity on you earlier.” She touched his forehead.</p><p>Albus did not pull away, he could not, he could only look toward her.</p><p>The woman’s face softened for a moment… only a moment, “I see. It stings doesn’t it, like the thorns of a rose.” She took his hand in hers, inspecting it, “You are guilty of a crime, it is true, but it is one you inflicted on yourself. You must pay none the less.”</p><p>Albus wiped his eyes with his free hand, feeling the physical pain disappear. All that was left in him to focus on was the pain in his heart. He no longer cared, “Give me your worst. I care very little what you do to me.”</p><p>The witch released him, “Very well.” She produced a rose, “For your pain, to remind you of it.” She smiled bitterly at him.</p><p>Albus was unsure but for the second time today he took what was handed to him without question.</p><p>It felt just as warm as the pendent did, it’s thorns pricked his skin mercilessly, “This magic...”</p><p>“Oh, so you sense the similarity?” The witch mused, “You are gifted indeed.”</p><p>Blue eyes wandered over the beautiful flower, it was more perfect than anything he had ever seen.</p><p>“You will be punished, yes, but also gifted a task. Should your love be returned before the rose dies everything will be forgiven, the curse I have placed upon you will be lifted. If you do not, you will be stuck forever in your current state. I will keep a watchful eye on you during this time.”</p><p>Albus thought over her words, remembering the one whom he had loved since childhood, remembering the laugh at his misfortune, “There is no love to be returned.”</p><p>The witch finally stood, a seemingly cruel smile dawning on her lips, “Then what a fitting punishment for a thief. I suppose you will stay that way.”</p><p>“Then I will end it now, you will have your punishment and you will not have to concern yourself with me further.” Albus curled his hand around the flower, ready to rip it from it’s stem. He felt the silken petals under his fingertips, they begged to be kept intact. He released his hand with a sigh.</p><p>Hope could be a terribly tragic thing indeed.</p><p>He looked up to meet the witches gaze, her knowing expression had not changed. She nodded her head to him.</p><p>Resigning himself to his fate, he stood, “Albus.” He finally greeted the other properly. They would be spending much time together.</p><p>“It’s a pleasure to meet you, thief.” The witch responded.</p>
