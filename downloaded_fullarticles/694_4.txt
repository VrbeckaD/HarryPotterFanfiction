    <p>Tom looked up from his flowers as the sound of buzzing reached his ears. “Welcome home, Harry,” he murmured as he lifted a gloved hand. Moments later a tiny bee-sized bird landed on the tip of his finger. It stretched its wings out and let out the tiniest of yawns, before settling down and staring up at him with expectant eyes.</p>
<p>Harry had moved in with Tom a year after they had started dating, into the flat above the flower shop. At this point the flowers had climbed their way up the building, creating a plant haven for Harry as well as for a myriad of butterflies and bees. Harry loved it, and the impressive sight drew many customers, which pleased Tom.</p>
<p>Most days, Harry walked home after work. But when he was particularly tired, he would fly home, too exhausted to deal with the lingering crowds of Diagon Alley.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Tom smiled indulgently at Harry, closing the shop door with a flick of his wand and carrying his love up the stairs and onto the large balcony at the back of their house. It was a veritable jungle of plants more than anything, but there was space for a table and a couple of chairs within all of the greenery, and that was enough for Tom.</p>
<p>“The Lion Roses bloomed,” he informed Harry, who let out a pleased croon. Opening the large glass doors, Tom deposited Harry on the aforementioned plant. It shuddered and let out a soft roar, but otherwise did not object to the presence of the miniature hummingbird.</p>
<p>Then Tom took a seat in one of the chairs and relaxed, content as the sun set slowly and Harry buzzed about his flowers.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
