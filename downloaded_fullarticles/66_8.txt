    <p>Pansy wasn't hiding. She most certainly was not. She was just standing there, perched between the backside of one of the greenhouses and a huge container that smelled really bad.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Okay maybe she was hiding.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>The only thing she’d wanted was a cigarette and peace. The grounds around the greenhouses were perfect for this occasion. Nearly no one ever came here after lessons. Except maybe Longbottom. But they never spoke whenever their paths crossed and he also didn’t seem to care about her smoking habit.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Today though she’d heard McGonagalls voice shortly after she lit her cigarette and if there was one thing she didn’t need right now it was getting caught smoking by the Gryffindor headmistress. Pansy had to admit that the old bat had been quite fair in the aftermath of the war, but she was still strict, not to say prude. Students smoking just wasn’t an option for her. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>And here she was, freezing her ass off, because she hand’t found it necessary to bring a jacket nor to change her heels into something more comfortable, not able to tell if it was safe to go back up to the castel yet.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>»Parkinson!«<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>The hushed but firm tone had Pansy turning abruptly. She still couldn’t quite believe how the war turned Longbottom into this, admittedly handsome, stranger who seemed to have grown balls somewhere in all this mess.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>She leveled him with one of her death glares. Because why the hell was he suddenly talking to her? Neville just rolled his eyes in response.</p><p> </p><p>»Wanna get out of here without McGonagall noticing, or not?«</p><p> </p><p>Pansy contemplated his offer for a moment, or maybe longer, because at one point Neville just shrugged and started to make his way back to where he came from. Sighing Pansy hurried to follow him. He surely wasn’t going to trick here. He was a bloody Gryffindor after all.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">***</p><p> </p><p>A few weeks later Pansy caught herself looking for him. Longbottom. He had breakfast early and went to tend to some boring plants afterwards most days. Pansy knew this because she followed him. Not that she’d ever admit it. Not even in front of herself. She just happened to crave a cigarette and it was purely a coincidence that it was right then when Neville rose from the breakfast table. He didn’t show up for lunch in the Great Hall often. It took Pansy a longer time then she considered acceptable, to figure out that he spent most of this time in the greenhouses too. Because, duh, she could have guessed that. After dinner she rarely saw him. Most days he was hauled up in their tower with friends. At least that’s what she suspected, because he always left dinner with a bunch of other Gryffindors.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>»Pansy? Hey, Pans? You in there? You’re staring again!«</p><p> </p><p>Pansys gaze snapped back to the cup of tea in front of her, she shot a look of anger to Daphne who was wiggling her eyebrows, still watching Longbottom from the corner of her eyes. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>»What are you talking about? I’m not staring at all.« She watched Neville leaving the Great Hall and quickly rose herself. »Get it together Daph, see you at lunch?« Pansy didn’t wait to hear the retort of her friend which surely wasn’t something she cared to know anyways.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p align="center">***</p><p> </p><p>»I can’t believe you talked me into this!«<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Pansy was wobbling on her heels, cursing her too short skirt and even more cursing Neville. It was solely his fault that she was covered in sole up to her elbows, cigarette dangling from the corner of her mouth and struggling to keep her stance, while he tried to cover some sensible, rare species of a plant in more leaves. This apparently was necessary protection from all the heat that haunted them lately.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>She’d just went to the greenhouses for her cigarette in peace and maybe a glimpse of Neville. Though if somebody ever asked, she never even thought that and all of a sudden the door of one of the greenhouses opened and Neville asked if she could assist him now that she was here anyways. Damn him and damn her heels and her choice of cloths. It just was way too warm to wear more than a hint of nothing. The worst part wasn’t even that she kind of felt exposed. The worst part was that Neville didn’t seem to notice, nor appreciate the view she gave him and she absolutely hated herself for these thoughts. It was Neville Longbottom after all.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>A rustling of fabric as Neville tried to rub the dirt from his hands and passed the cloth on to Pansy who eyed it skeptically before she took it. She halfheartedly whipped her palms. A drag of her cigarette followed, the mood between the two of them was suddenly really awkward and it was as if Pansy could see a hint of the clumsy boy Neville once was. Her cigarette finished, she tugged at the hem of her skirt. Painfully aware again how short it was, but all these thoughts were forgotten when her gaze met Nevilles. Nearly hidden under a thin layer of shyness there was a hunger and maybe even affection. Her brain still processing this new information Pansy couldn’t react fast enough.</p><p> </p><p>Neville cleared his throat. »Thank you for helping me.« Awkward silence again, before Neville, out of nowhere, took a step towards her and kissed her gently on the cheek.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Pansy just stood there stunned. She didn’t realize that Neville left. She was lost in that warm, comforting feeling that still lingered where he’d kissed her. She would have never imagined that a simple kiss on the cheek could spark so many consuming but exciting emotions. Damn Longbottom and his plants. She had a feeling this wasn’t going to be the last time the simple wish for a cigarette would end her up covered in dirt.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
