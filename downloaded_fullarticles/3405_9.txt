  <em>December 1966</em>
</p><p><br/> The dim light of the overhead chandelier does little to illuminate the rather large, loud and gloomy dining room of Number 12 Grimmauld Place. The clank of silverware and the low buzz of conversation from the adults doesn't faze young Narcissa Black, who has sat through these dinners many times before. Impatiently pushing away a gravy dish so she can lean forward, she tries to listen in to what the adults and her older sisters are talking about. The sisters in question are both deeply involved in discussions of their own, across the table. The middle daughter, Andromeda, is currently deep in conversation with her uncle, Alphard. Their shared feeling on the topic being discussed by the rest of the table however, is the opposite as to how the rest of the family, including the eldest sister, Bellatrix, views it.<br/> <br/> "I tell you Ignatius, it's been getting worse and worse!" comes the deep voice of the sisters' father Cygnus.<br/> <br/> "What's been getting worse father?" questions Narcissa, desperate to appear active in the conversation.</p><p>Bellatrix opens her mouth indignantly to respond, but is cut off by their mother.</p><p><br/> "Daughter," admonishes her mother, Druella. "It isn't ladylike, nor your place to interrupt your father like that!"<br/> <br/> "Ah, Druella, calm yourself," replies Cygnus. "She ought to know whats going on in the world if she's going to become a little socialite when she grows up!"<br/> <br/> Narcissa blushes. "Father-"<br/> <br/> "Though I doubt you'll have trouble with that being betrothed to the son of Abraxas Malfoy!"<br/> <br/> Chortles ring out across the table. Narcissa blushes deeper. Bellatrix gives her a patronizing smile.<br/> <br/> Almost exactly reverse to this conversation, is the exchange happening between 17 year old Andromeda and her uncle.<br/> <br/> "I swear, uncle, it's only been getting worse."<br/> <br/> "I'm aware," Alphard responds grimly, a hard set to his mouth</p><p>"At school, muggleborns, half-bloods, the so called 'blood-traitors'. What happens... And it's my own family uncle. Bella, her betrothed, many others from the sacred 28. And-and I'm so scared, for me, for T-Ted, for many of my friends really..."<br/> Andromeda has told her uncle of her plans to run away with Ted Tonks, a muggleborn Hufflepuff, as soon as they finish their final year at Hogwarts. He has set up funds for her, untraceable back to him, and plans to help what he sees as the one decent person in his family, escape the oppressive overhanging mantle of the Black name.<br/> Not privy to all the plans, schemes and drama unfolding at that very Christmas dinner, seven year old Sirius Black and his five year old brother Regulus play with the large array of forks spread out at their place setting. Even more then usual, seeing as it is Christmas dinner. Already bored out of their minds, they decide to see how many forks exactly, they can stick in the large roast turkey sitting in the middle of the table. It turns out not many before they are noticed by their family. </p><p>“Sirius and Regulus Black!” exclaims their mother, Walburga. Narcissa and Bellatrix snicker behind their hands. Andromeda subtlety gives them a thumbs up.</p><p>”Now, now Walburga, they’re just boys.” Soothes their father, Orion.</p><p>”Boys who will soon be men!” Walburga retorts sharply, drawing herself up. </p><p>“Boys, I do think it best if you return to your rooms,” Suggests their uncle Alphard, not unkindly.</p><p>”Good idea Alphard!” Booms uncle Cygnus. “We were just about to start discussing more," he pauses, "grown-up topics.” He misses the look of discomfort that passes between Andromeda and Alphard, and the look of pure excitement from Narcissa, who at thirteen, has never been allowed to stay for the ‘adult talks’ before. Sirius and Regulus reluctantly get down from the chairs that are much too high for them and walk upstairs.</p><p>The talk that commenced after they left, could very well have been the beginnings of what would later come to be known as the First Wizarding War.</p>
