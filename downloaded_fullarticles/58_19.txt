    <p>It was a brilliant, sunshiny morning. The sun was bright being seven in the morning on a Monday in London, granted, it was the middle of summer. It wasn’t too hot yet, but was sure to heat up as the day progressed. Remus knew this, but as usual threw on a long sleeved shirt and jeans. </p>
<p>Remus Lupin, 20 years old. He is tall, standing six foot two, with lanky legs- lanky everything. Striking bone structure and a skinny body. He’s got brown eyes, with speckles of green in them. Light brown fluffy hair. As well as scars on his face, but a smile that could brighten up any room.</p>
<p>“I’m heading down,” Remus called out to the flat as he was putting on his Dr Martens. He raised an eyebrow, waiting for the response.</p>
<p>“Okay!” A soft feminine voice called back. “Who’s on today?” The voice asked as the owner walked around a corner.</p>
<p>A woman appeared, the same age as Remus. She stands lower than Remus, at five foot five. She has a good build. Sse has green eyes and long red hair that goes down to her waist. Her smile was kind. Her name, Lily Evans.</p>
<p>“Myself, as usual,” Remus mumbled. “Mary’s coming in at ten, then Jake at one,”</p>
<p>“Need me to pop in?” Lily offered. “I do have classes until twelve, but then I’m free,”</p>
<p>“Nah,” Remus shook his head. “Should be good, if we do get busy though, I’ll call ya in,’</p>
<p>“Cheers,” LIly nodded her head. The two walked out their shared flat and down the stairs of the apartment block. “Have fun today,” Lily commented as they exited the building. The two friends waved goodbye as Lily went to her car, and Remus began his two block walk to work.</p>
<p>He walked down the road, holding on to his over the shoulder bag. Lily is one of his best friends, no, she is his best friend. She knew most of his secrets, kind of like a sister. He thinks, he never had a sister. </p>
<p>When Remus finally stopped, he looked up with a smile. Lupin’s Lotus’. OF course, he didn’t just sell Lotus’, but it sounded nice. Remus is a florist, with his very own business. Anyone who knew him could not have picked this career path for him. Alas, he was happy as ever in this job.</p>
<p>He unlocked the door, entering his shop and locking the door behind him. He flicked on the lights and took in a deep breath. The smell of all the flowers hit him. His nose was very sensitive, so he could almost pinpoint each flower by its smell, almost. He walked into the back office, going into his own office through that.</p>
<p>His office was plain and simple. A desk in the middle that was long and brown, then a black spinny chair behind that, and a regular chair on the other side. A bookshelf sat in one corner, heavy with books. In the other corner, was a large cabinet. Behind his desk was a large window. </p>
<p>Remus went over to the window and slid open the blinds, letting light flood into his office. He walked back out into the main office, beginning to make himself a coffee.</p>
<p>In the main office, a large wooden table sat in the middle, surrounded by chairs. On one side there was a small kitchenette, being a microwave, coffee machine, fridge, etc. On the other side a large white board sat on the wall. Pictures were drawn on it, motivational messages and plans. A calendar was next to the door, then a phone and a little table with notepads and pens, an open cupboard next to that. Opposite from the door into the shop, was the door to his office. A door next to the kitchenette led to a small bathroom of a toilet, sink, mirror. On the other side of the kitchenette, was another door that led to a large linen closet of storage.</p>
<p>Remus made his coffee, noting that they need more milk and sugar, and went over to the white board. He looked at it, checking over the messages and notes, all while sipping his coffee. He grabbed a notebook off the table, double checking the counting of inventory. Then he looked at the calendar, seeing when people were off. </p>
<p>He finished his coffee, rinsing his mug out and putting it in the sink. There were some flowers in the office so he began taking them out into the shop. He started setting up the shop. Putting some hanging plants outside, as well as a bike woven in flowers, and a wolf also woven in flowers. He put the plants inside, all where they should be. Made sure all the price tags were on and correct. Then we went through and gave them a light watering. Some didn’t need much watering, some needed lots. Once he was finished, and it was nearing nine o’clock, he flipped his beautifully floral closed sign around to open. </p>
<p>He started up the tablet and eftpos machine behind the counter. He checked the cash register, making sure there was enough money in it. Then the out the front notebook, checking to see if any orders were placed today. To receive or to give. Today they were getting a few deliveries. He also turned on the stereo, connecting the tablet to it and started playing David Bowie.</p>
<p>So far, two customers had come in. One came to buy a bouquet of roses for his wife, cliche. The other walked in, started sneezing, and promptly walked back out. It hit ten, and Mary Macdonald walked in. </p>
<p>Mary is older than Remus, twenty two. She is five foot six. She has platinum blonde hair going down just past her shoulders, and bright blue eyes. Her smile always had some kind of flirtatious flick to it.</p>
<p>“Alright, Remus?” She queried as she clocked in. “Busy morning?”</p>
<p>“So busy,” Remus rolled his eyes. He stood at the counter and listened as he heard her begin to make a tea. “I had two whole customers, sort of.”</p>
<p>“Sort of?” He could hear the humor in her voice.</p>
<p>“Well, one came in and started sneezin’ all over me flowers,” Remus huphed. </p>
<p>Mary laughed. “Potter come in yet to buy Lilies for Lily?” She walked out of the office, a mug of tea in her hands. </p>
<p>“Ah, not yet,” Remus shook his head. “She has classes this morning, so I reckon he’ll either come in after twelve, or skip today.”</p>
<p>“Sure hope he skips today, looking into those puppy dog love sick eyes makes me want to vomit,” She fake gages.</p>
<p>“Whatever,” Remus rolled his eyes. “Also, I don’t pay you to drink tea,”</p>
<p>“I drink what I say,” She smirked, taking a large sip of her drink. “And you pay me?”</p>
<p>“I shouldn’t,” He murmmered. “I’ve gotta go buy milk and sugar. Do we need anything else?” </p>
<p>Mary tapped her chin in thought. “Not that I know of, when are the deliveries?”</p>
<p>“At two, so Jake will be here,” Remus went to grab his keys and a bag. “All good on your own while I duck out?</p>
<p>She sighed dramatically. “Oh, I suppose. I’ll be so lonely.”</p>
<p>“Shame,” Remus said and left.</p>
<p>~~~~~</p>
<p>It was three in the afternoon, and Remus, Mary and Jake had only just finished dealing with the deliveries. </p>
<p>“Well,” Remus huphed. “I say this calls for a cup of tea?”</p>
<p>“Calls for?” Mary questioned. “Isn’t that usually meant in a situation of congratulations, or something is wrong.”</p>
<p>“Mary,” Jake put a hand on her shoulder. “The man is offering us a cuppa, be grateful.” They all just laughed and went into the office.</p>
<p>Jake Middleton, he is nineteen, so younger than his co-workers. He is just below six foot, with quite a muscular build. He has brown hair that’s shaved down, and hazel eyes. His smile was caring.</p>
<p>Remus went over to the kettle and turned it on, getting their cups ready. THey heard the bell for the front door jingle. Jake got up to deal with the customers, only, he called out,</p>
<p>“It’s Lily and Marlene!”</p>
<p>“I’ll get their tea going!” Remus called back.</p>
<p>Jake entered the room with two girls. Lily, and Marlene.</p>
<p>Marlene Mckinnon, same age as Mary. She stood at 5 foot seven with a toned body. She has dirty blonde hair and light green eyes. Her smile was shy. </p>
<p>The group of five sat around the table now, drinking tea and eating biscuits.</p>
<p>“Did Potter attack you again today?” Mary asked a mouthful of biscuit, crumbs falling everywhere. “He didn’t come in the shop.”</p>
<p>“No,” Lily shook her head. “He sat next to me in History, and I overhead something..”</p>
<p>“Deets!” Mary and Marlene shouted. They looked at each other than giggled.</p>
<p>Lily rolled her eyes. “He works for his friends in a tattoo parlour, his best friend is the owner of the tattoo parlour,”</p>
<p>“Sexy,” Mary practically drooled. “A tattooed man, I could get tattoo’s for free!”</p>
<p>“Didn’t you say he’s scared of needles?” Jake asked.</p>
<p>Lily hummed. “According to him, deathly afraid. I guess, only if they are near him? Maybe,” She thought. “Oh, but! It’s the parlour across the street.”</p>
<p>A loud, high pitched squeel was heard. Mary was positively bouncing in her chair, face bright red. “Sirius Black’s shop! He’s so hot!”</p>
<p>“Oh boy..” Remus muttered.</p>
