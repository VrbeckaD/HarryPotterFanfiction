  <strong>Part One: Hermione’s Late-Night Adventure</strong>
</p>
<p>           </p>
<p>            When Hermione Granger first came to Hogwarts, she only knew two people who could tolerate being around her, Harry Potter and Ron Weasley. After correcting Ron during Charms Class, she overheard him making fun of her with Harry. To calm herself, she went to the only place where she felt a true sense of serenity, the library. It was there where most of her free time was spent. After she settled her differences with Harry and Ron, they became close friends and she loved spending her time with them. Even still, the library always called her and she would often find herself there well after curfew.</p>
<p>            “Miss Granger,” Madame Irma Pince called out to Hermione, “It’s past curfew, you should be in bed. You have your seventh-year finals tomorrow.”</p>
<p>            “Y-yes, Madame Pince,” Hermione said, “sorry, I-I was just doing some last-minute studying.”</p>
<p>            “Hermione, you’re one of the most dedicated and exceptional students I’ve ever seen come through this library. I have no doubt that you will shine during your exams. Here, let me return that book for you.”</p>
<p>            “No!” Hermione’s face flushed red, “Uh- I mean, you shouldn’t have to work alone. Please, let me help you. It looks like I wasn’t the only one preparing for tomorrow’s exams, I’ll help you put these books away.”</p>
<p>            “Why, thank you, Hermione.” Madame Pince said.</p>
<p>            Together, they lifted their wands and casted silent charms which lifted the books from the tables and returned them to their respective places. Hermione made sure the book she was reading was lifted by her charm and was placed in the middle of her stack so Madame Pince couldn’t see it. She felt embarrassment flush through her cheeks as her book lifted from the stack and floated to the Limited Restriction Section. She caught a glimpse at the title one last time as it floated around the corner. <em>The Many Secrets of the Room of Requirement.</em></p>
<p>            Hermione went to bed that night confident her book wasn’t seen by Madame Pince. In the book, she read that the Room of Requirement could not only provide equipment for training as it did for Harry or toilets as it did for Dumbledore, but it could also provide material or equipment of a more organic nature. She wondered if it could be used to act out a recurring dream that she had been having ever since her sex ed professor spoke of witches and wizards using charms, spells and even some plants as instruments of pleasure. She didn’t want to act out the dream because of her desire for pleasure; it was because she could hardly focus in class. She thought that maybe, if she could experience the dream in reality, she would stop having it and would finally be able to focus again. The last few days had been difficult for her as the dream kept filling her mind. Hermione’s classmates knew something was bothering her because her hand didn’t shoot up near as much during class as it did in the beginning of the year and when she was asked a question, she would often have to ask the professor to repeat it.</p>
<p>            It was late and Hermione was very tired. She fell asleep quickly. That night, she had a different dream that was of the same nature. It was very similar to her recurring dream but had some major differences. She was inside the Room of Requirement and not a dark chamber under the castle. Also, in the place of the deadly Devil’s Snare, it was its mostly harmless cousin the Flitterbloom.</p>
<p>            Hermione woke feeling slightly dizzy, light headed and very hot. After a moment, she realized that her hand under the bedspread was not only in her pants, but it was also wet. She couldn’t take it anymore. It was one O’clock in the morning, her final exams were in eight hours and she was wide awake after only two hours of sleep. Frustrated, she rolled over and closed her eyes. After ten minutes they popped back open; she hadn’t slept at all and she was still feeling very hot and it seemed that her hand kept finding its way inside her pants. <em>Well, </em>she thought, <em>I don’t think this is going away anytime soon... The thought of the Flitterbloom won’t go away and that dream! Oh, that was amazing! I need it. I need to sleep and doing this is the only thing that will stop these thoughts so I can sleep.</em></p>
<p>            She turned her head slowly to see that Ginny and the other girls in her room were sound asleep. <em>Must be nice,</em> she thought as she slowly sat up and hung her feet off her bed feeling for her slippers. Hermione slid her feet into her slippers, stood up quietly and made her way for the door. Pulling her wand from her pocket, she quietly cast a silencing charm on the door hinges so they wouldn’t squeak. She proceeded down the stairs into the common area and out Gryffindor Tower. Staying in the shadows, she quietly made her way down the corridors toward the Room of Requirement. She narrowly avoided Mrs. Norris, Filch’s cat, and felt a rush of excitement and adrenaline.</p>
<p>            She finally found the Room of Requirement and to her astonishment, the door was already visible. Hermione pushed the door open to find a dimly lit room with a pit filled with rippling water in the middle. As soon as she shut the door, torches around the room ignited, casting a fiery glow over the entire room. Hearing what sounded like stone grinding on stone, Hermione looked back at the door and saw that it was sinking into the wall and became a seamless section of the wall. She looked back at the pit and realized it was a square pool and upon further investigation she found that it wasn’t water inside the pool at all. Inside the pool was a giant mass of Flitterbloom; it’s tendrils and tentacles pulsed and writhed giving the appearance of rippling water in low light environments.</p>
<p>            When Hermione saw what it was, she felt a rush of fear that was dampened by excitement and adrenaline. She began to feel even more hot. Looking towards the pool, she began to think of what would happen if she fell in. She nibbled on her finger while she contemplated whether she should just jump in, dangle her legs over the edge or turn around and leave the room. She approached the pool and bent over to get a closer look at the Flitterbloom. A tentacle began to rise from the mass and small tendrils started to slither up it. When the tendrils reached the end of the tentacle, they began to climb each other, trying to get as close to Hermione’s face as possible. She hovered a hand over the spire of tendrils with one finger extended towards them. The tendrils lifted themselves up to wrap around her finger and began to tug gently at her. She slowly pulled her finger away and now knew she wanted to enter the pool. Hermione backed away from the pool, feeling herself become hotter as she watched the mass of tentacles squirm. She bumped into the wall and knew she couldn’t back away any farther.</p>
<p>            Staring into the pool, she slid one hand under her shirt and up to her breasts and the other into her pajama pants. She grabbed one of her breasts and started to squeeze while she rubbed her finger around her entrance. Her finger slid over her jewel and she felt a wave of heat. The urge to enter the pool was to strong now; if she were to leave this room now, there was no way she could get a good night’s sleep. In her mind, getting into the pool was now the only option. But how would she do it? <em>If I jump in, they may just have their way with me. </em>She thought as her finger slid into her, <em>I won’t have any control. If I dangle my legs over the edge, they may do nothing or pull me in.</em></p>
<p>            Just then, she saw the tentacles pull away from the corner of the pool nearest her and saw a staircase leading to the bottom of the pool. It looked to be eight feet deep, and filled almost to the top with the Flitterbloom. <em>They must be able to sense what I’m thinking, </em>Hermione thought, <em>they just gave me a way to get in to the pool.</em> She slid her hand down from her breast and out of her pants and slowly pulled her shirt off. She nibbled on her finger again and could taste herself as her tongue brushed against her finger. She slid her hands down her chest and stomach into her pants again. This time, with one hand, she rubbed, pinched and rolled her jewel; with the other hand, she slid two fingers into her entrance. The pleasure caused her back to arch, pushing herself harder into the wall. Hermione pulled her fingers from inside of her and sucked the juice from them. She pulled her pants off and dropped them by her shirt against the wall.</p>
<p>            As Hermione approached the pool, she saw the tentacles retreat away in the center and a path open up. Small tendrils gently brushed and rubbed against Hermione’s naked body as they gently wrapped around her arms and legs only to let go as she passed. They continued to do this as she walked to the center of the pool. Looking around, she could see four walls or squirming tentacles towering above her. She looked back to the path and saw tentacles on either side slithering towards each other, closing the path as they closed off the hole that was in the wall. Hermione smiled. She approached one wall and raised her arm toward it.</p>
<p>            As she pushed her arm into the wall, small tendrils began to wrap themselves around her arm, breasts and legs. A larger tentacle emerged from the wall and slid up her leg toward her entrance. Hermione pulled her arm from the wall and was holding a tentacle. She bit her lip as she began to stroke it. The tentacle near her entrance started to press against it and rub her. She slid her free hand down her chest, over her breasts and slid it down her stomach to the tentacle where she pushed it hard against her. She wished she had a bed to sit on but heard something behind her before she could finish the thought.</p>
<p>            Looking behind her, Hermione saw tentacles from the wall behind her slither across the floor to form a thick mat the size of a bed. She smiled, “You sure do know how to treat a lady.” She said as she sat down. She licked her lips as she began to stroke the tentacle harder, feeling it throb in her hand. She looked as the walls of Flitterbloom started to slide toward her, just as she wanted. She pulled the tentacle to her mouth and began to kiss it. Pulling it away, she licked her lips again and could taste a sweet juice the tentacle left behind. Hermione pulled it to her again and began to run her tongue around the tip of the tentacle. She felt tentacles slither up her back and realized they were forming a backrest so she could feel more comfortable. She showed her appreciation by pushing the tentacle into her mouth. The one near her entrance started rubbing hard against her jewel, making her toes curl and her back arch. She threw her head back and released a muffled sigh of pleasure. Hermione grabbed the tentacle in her mouth hard and began thrusting her head back and forth while sucking as hard as she could. She felt the trickle of juice in her mouth, savored it, and swallowed as much as she could. Feeling the tentacle begin to throb in her mouth; she pulled it out, pointed it at her chest and began to stroke it hard. A thick, white substance shot out from a small hole at the tip of the tentacle and sprayed on her chest. She watched as small streams of the substance oozed down her chest and stomach. Hermione used the hand that was pushing the lower tentacle against her and slid it up her stomach, scooping up some of the white juice. She held her hand in front of her face and smelled the juice. It smelled just like the tentacle tasted. She licked it off of her hand and began to use her finger to scoop more and sucked it off. “You wouldn’t happen to have any more, would you?” She said as she looked at the tentacle that just sprayed her.</p>
<p>            The tentacle near her entrance pushed its tip into her and began circling the brim of her entrance while small tendrils wrapped around her jewel and began to rub and squeeze it. The rush of heat and pleasure pushed Hermione hard against the back rest, she threw her head back and screamed “FUCK!” It was the first time she had ever used such foul language but it felt so right. She grabbed the tentacle that was probing her and pushed it hard into her.</p>
<p>            The tentacle, now given free roam inside her, started thrusting, bending and squirming. Hermione pushed against the backrest and it reclined almost flat. Tendrils rose from the backrest to wrap around her breasts. They began to caress her entire body and squeeze her nipples. She squirmed with the tentacle inside of her and was overwhelmed with the combined pleasure of everything that was happening. She pushed her head back, sighing and moaning with pleasure. Two tentacles came from the walls on either side of her and approached her. “Oh, yes. Anything for you. Just please don’t stop.” She said as she grabbed the tentacles and started stroking them. She looked at the tentacle inside her and could see a small tentacle rising from the mat. “I think I know just where to put you, my little friend. Just be gentle.” Hermione said as she grabbed the tentacle and pushed it against her bottom. The small tentacle obeyed and gently rubbed around her bottom, releasing a small trickle of juice to help lubricate it.</p>
<p>            She stroked the two tentacles harder as she squirmed with the tentacle inside her. They began to throb harder until one sprayed her chest and neck with its juice. She looked at the other and licked her lips, “come here, you,” she said as she pulled it to her mouth. Hermione pushed it into her mouth and began sucking hard. Knowing she was ready to go further; she grabbed the tentacle that was obediently rubbing her bottom and slowly pushed it inside her. She closed her eyes, screwed up her face and bit the tentacle in her mouth as an odd mixture of pain and ecstasy flowed through her. Hermione felt like she couldn’t move. She was feeling so hot that she imagined she may catch fire. All three tentacles inside her started pulsing; she could taste the liquid coming from the one in her mouth. A rush of heat and pleasure flowed through her as she let out a muffled scream in orgasm. The tentacles all sprayed their juice inside her; she welcomed every drop as she swallowed as much as she could. She could feel her insides filling up and begin to leak the liquid. The tentacles all pulled out of her. The two that pulled from her flower and bottom sprayed the rest of their juice on her stomach and chest while the other sprayed on her face. She let out a shaky moan as she fell limp.</p>
<p>            Hermione looked at the tentacles to see that they were wrapping around each other. The mass of twisted tentacles pushed itself between her legs, slipped along her stomach and chest and stopped near her chin. She kissed the mass of tentacles softly as she wrapped her arms around it. She laid there for nearly an hour cuddling the tentacles. When Hermione was ready to go back to her dorm, walked out of the pool and now next to her clothes was a large shower. After showering, she quietly made her way back to her dorm. Feeling her legs tremble as she walked, she knew that this definitely would not be the last time she visited the Room of Requirement late at night.</p>
<p align="center">            That morning at breakfast, Hermione told Harry and Ron that she would like to have breakfast with the girls. After listening to Ron protest for a while, fearing he may fail his exams, Hermione smiled, “Well if you would stay up a little later at night, maybe you could have gotten more studying done,” she said as she moved her plate over to Ginny and Luna. Hermione asked how they felt about their upcoming exams. They talked about the exams for a while and though Hermione was able to focus on what they were saying, she felt that she wanted to tell them of her night; and wondered even more so if they would want to join her.</p>
