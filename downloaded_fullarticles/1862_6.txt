    <p>“Oh, shit,” Tonks muttered in a whisper. Her bubblegum pink hair, half of which was pulled into a loose bun on top of her head, turned to a mousey brown as she turned to see exactly what she had run into. A small table against the cool stone wall of the empty classroom wobbled and she noticed a few bottles on the floor -- now clanking around as they rolled.</p><p>She moved to pick up the bottles, household charms never were her strong suit. She stumbled slightly over the mess and, to her surprise, up against a body that hadn't been there before. Or, rather, had not been visible before, and she didn't have much time to ponder how long he’d been there in the darkness, watching her, and waiting for the right moment to reveal himself, before the figure spoke.</p><p>“Well, stupid girl,” the deep voice dripping with disdain began, “I hope you aren't laboring under the illusion that you have the right to be down here or has your fascination with turning your hair preposterous colors affected what little brain you had?”</p><p>“Oh, for fucks sake, Snape. It’s just you.”</p><p>She turned her head over her shoulder to look at him. Still close enough to him so that she could feel the heat from his body. She turned to face him, her hand resting on her chest – feeling her quickened heart begin to slow and the heaviness in her chest, and she breathed in deeply to calm her nerves down.</p><p>After a few moments of silence, she began to speak again – at a rapid pace. Severus prepared himself for an onslaught of words to smack him in the face – quickly spoken and bubbly, fascinating yet irritating, her voice one that would stick with him for days to come.</p><p>“I came down here because I figure if there’s anywhere a death eater might be lurking, well, it’d be around the dungeons. I didn’t suspect that I’d find yo--”</p><p>“I am a Death Eater, girl!” he snarled.</p><p>She huffed and rolled her eyes at him, “Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know.”</p><p>She postured her body to be stiff and straight, attempting to make herself taller than she was. She raised her chin in the air, turning up her nose as if something smelled poorly. Her hair went jet black before she spoke again in a deep and daft voice:</p><p>“I, Severus Snape, am a servant of The Dark Lord. I should be trusted by noone other than Albus Dumbledore The rest of you lowly, stupid, petulant imbeciles should fear me, as I am a Death Eater.”</p><p>She slouched back into her own posture and her hair returned to its bubble gum pink. She scrunched her face up in bored exasperation.</p><p><br/> “I know your little speech by now, so can’t you just shut your fucking mouth and spare me? It is me after all, Severus. Not your typical half-wit. If anything I'm just a quarter-wit. I must be spending all my time with you anyhow.” She smiled sarcastically at him and slapped his shoulder jovially. He suppressed a laugh and forced a grimace at her touch, but he said nothing.</p><p>He maneuvered his way around her so that he managed to get off of the wall he was posted against. He brushed her lightly with his arm but otherwise managed to avoid touching her. He began to walk swiftly through the dungeon</p><p>Tonks quickened her pace and followed, “Alright then. So, what're we up to tonight? Are you brewing anything new? Do you have any interesting articles for me to look-over?”</p><p>“I did not ask you to make notes on that article, Miss Tonks. You simply took it upon yourself to scribble all over a perfectly fine article.”</p><p>“You are a right grouch, you know that? It's just Tonks, Professor. And, I noticed that you took some of that scribble and used it in your final work.”</p><p>He paused at the portrait or his living quarters, looked down at the floor, took a deep breath, and said, admitting defeat, “I had no plans this evening except to enjoy a quiet evening by myself reading, but I assume you intend on ruining that peace and quiet?” He looked back at her over his shoulder.</p><p>She shrugged her shoulders and bobbed her head left-to-right in consideration, “That's sounds about right.”</p><p>He sighed, “Very well. Come on then.” He quietly said, so she couldn't hear, the word “bubblegum” and the portrait to his living quarters swung open.</p><p>“And..” she began loudly behind him, “don't act as if me hanging around and nagging you once a week isn't the best thing that's ever happened to you.” He turned around to scoff at her, as he once again noticed how bizarre and delightful it was to have her loud voice and bright pink hair crash their way into his home.</p>
