    <p dir="ltr">You didn't know why you were sorted into Slytherin, you weren't cunning. You were anxious. You always had anxiety problems, especially in Potions class for you feared you would make Professor Snape mad at you for messing up. And well... that's what was happening right now. Snape was frustrated with you for messing up a certain potion. </p><p dir="ltr">"Professor please... I did not mean too!" You insisted firmly. Though, as per usual with Snape, he was not listening to you. “You are so incompetent (Your First Name).” Snape said sharply. Anxiety was brewing up inside you and your cheeks flared up to red hot. “I do not know why you were even put into Slytherin in the first place.” Snape continued, agging you on. “Please professor, I’ll do better next time!” You exclaimed, hands clutching your robes. “Let’s hope so.” Snape said before adding, “Now leave.” He ordered and you quickly obeyed him, knuckles turning a pale white as you tottered out of the class. It was your free period and you did not know what to do. You just wandered around, walking off your anxiety. It was after all, an accident with the potion. But you knew oh so well that Snape expected perfection. And you were feeling anxious and it felt like you had a knot in your throat.</p><p dir="ltr">As you were walking, you had your head hanging down so you weren’t paying attention to your surroundings. So when you bumped into someone, your body froze. Reluctantly, you looked up and it was Professor Lupin. “(Your First Name), what are you doing?” He asked. You have always liked Lupin, he was your favorite professor and well... you had a crush on him but you never did speak about that. “S-Sorry, Professor, I was-“ Your words got stuck in your throat, you swallowed. “Something is the matter with you, (Your First Name).” Lupin said to you. Your face said it all. You were pale with wide eyes. </p><p dir="ltr">Your heart rate quickened and Lupin could hear it. Your (your eye color) eyes trailed down as Lupin put a hand in his pocket and you heard a crinkling sound. “Here.” Lupin pulled out a dark chocolate bar and he snapped off a piece. “Eat it. It’ll make you feel much better.” Lupin said, outstretching his arm. Hesitantly, you grabbed the piece of chocolate. Then you put it into your mouth. It was creamy and sweet. You ate the sweet treat before swallowing. You felt a little bit better, better enough to tell Lupin what happened. “Professor Snape is mad at me because I accidentally messed up a potion.” You explained. “And he told me that I was incompetent and that I shouldn’t be in Slytherin.” You explained it all to Lupin, pouring out your feelings. You were rambling on about your anxiety but Lupin cut you short.</p><p dir="ltr">He had pulled you into a warm hug. Your (your eye color) eyes widened as you never had this kind of contact with a professor. But Lupin felt so warm and you could smell chocolate wafering off of him. (Your hair color) strands of hair fell in front of your eyes you did not care. Your heart rate slowed down to a normal, steady beat. Luckily, for you, Defense Against The Dark Arts was your next class after your free period. After a few moments, Lupin pulled away from you. “Do you feel better?” He asked, you nodded in response. Lupin wrapped an arm around your shoulder, making you lean against him. “Come on, you can sit with me in class.” He said as he walked you to the Defense Against The Dark Arts class. You pulled a smile and nodded. It would be just you and him. And he would make you feel better. </p><p dir="ltr">You snacked on another piece of chocolate quietly as you sat next to Lupin. You weren’t sure what to talk about. So the room was filled with silence. “(Your first name), have you always had anxiety?” Lupin asked out of the blue. “Yes.” You replied. “I don’t know why I was put into Slytherin.” You said stiffly. Lupin chuckled. “But you make a great Slytherin.” He complimented you, making your cheeks burn. Your fingers began to fidget almost nervously. “I really mean it.” Lupin told you and you lifted your head to look at him. Your heart skipped a beat, your anxiety coming back as it looked like Lupin was leaning closer. </p><p dir="ltr">“Pro-Professor Lupin-“ You said in a hoarse whisper. “Remus.” He spoke. “Huh?” You asked. “You can call me Remus.” He told you. Your eyes looked him up and down. <em>Are we going to kiss? </em>You thought anxiously. Remus was so close and you had an anxious expression on your face. “Can I?” Remus asked, sounding a bit shy about it. Eagerly, you responded with “Yes.” Remus leaned in closer and pressed his lips against yours. You felt all of the anxiety melt away as you started to wrap your arms around his neck as you happily returned the kiss. Remus went to gently grab your (Your hair length) (Your hair color) hair as the kissing continued until the two of you had to part for a gasp of air. </p><p dir="ltr">“So, do you feel better?” Remus asked. “I feel much better thanks to you.” You said as you caught your breath. “You know you can always come talk to me if you’re feeling anxious.” Remus told you as he pulled you close into a hug. “And I’ll have a word with Snape.” He mumbled, as he hugged you tightly. “Thank you.” You whispered as you rested your chin on his shoulder. “Does this mean we’re a thing now?” You asked, blushing. Remus pulled away to look at you. “If you want.”</p><p dir="ltr">”I do want to be with you.”</p><p dir="ltr">Remus grinned before planting a kiss on your cheek. “Well, you should go and take your seat. Class is about to start.”</p><p dir="ltr"> </p>
