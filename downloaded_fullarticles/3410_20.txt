    <p>At age seventeen, Harry Potter realized that he very much did not hate his former enemy Draco Malfoy any longer. The deep-seated hatred Harry had for Draco turned into a secret lusting for the blonde wizard that seemed to intensify with each day. Each smarmy glance that was sent his way had the dark-haired wizard gasping for air; metaphorically, of course- His friends could never know about the near obsession Harry had for Draco.</p><p>It seemed to Harry as if Draco’s single goal in life was to tease him to the brink of combustion. It took Harry a while to realize that the urge to punch Draco was much outweighed by the urge to shove him up against a wall and kiss him until neither of them could breathe. </p><p>It was sad, how easily Draco could drive him crazy with a single glance. All it took for Harry to go insane was a flash of those deep grey eyes and a pink tongue sliding out along plush lips. He’d never felt anything close to this before and it terrified him, quite frankly. Harry’s need for Draco was so strong that he didn’t know how much longer he could hold it in without doing something stupid.</p><p>Every single day in Potions (their one shared class), Draco seemed to have something in his mouth, whether it be his quill or some sort of candy. Today, it was a cherry lollipop that stained his lips and tongue blood red. And when he shot Harry a sneer for answering a question correctly, the Boy-Who-Lived nearly passed out at seeing Draco’s red tongue peek out past pearly white teeth. </p><p>Throughout the entire class, Harry was fucking up his potions and spilling things. It was embarrassing, despite the fact that he’d never been very good at Potions in the first place. It was as if Draco was permanently etched into Harry’s mind and there was absolutely nothing he could do about it.</p><p>Every now and then he’d meet Draco’s eyes, and the blonde would give him an almost knowing smirk, swirling his tongue along the flat edge of the lollipop. Harry’s cock twitched in his boxers as he looked away quickly, his breath hitching in his throat. Shit, fuck, shit- How was he supposed to concentrate now? </p><p>Most of the time, Harry could handle his ever-building lust by thinking unsexy thoughts, but today he just wasn’t having it. His body got the best of him and he had to excuse himself to all but run to the boys’ bathroom. The green-eyed boy let out a shaky breath and locked himself into one of the bathroom stalls, pressing the heel of his hand to the bulge that was prominent even through his school robes. </p><p>“Oh, shit...” Harry hissed, trying to get his body to relax as he swallowed thickly and let out a shaky breath. He quickly realized that his body and mind were in no place to calm down, so he quickly stripped off his robes and pulled his boxers down, wrapping a hand around his leaking cock. </p><p>Harry groaned quietly, his thumb sliding over the slit and smearing precum over his crown. He closed his eyes and imagined Draco on his knees for Harry, licking up the trail of precum that slid down his cock, his pink tongue slithering all the way up his shaft, hot and wet. He had to squeeze the base of his cock roughly to keep himself in check, biting down hard on his lower lip to hold in his noises. </p><p>As he began to move his hand faster, up and down his shaft, he imagined that it was Draco’s mouth, his lips puffy and red. He saw sultry eyes turned up at him in his head, long eyelashes curled up prettily as Draco took Harry deep into his throat. He bet that the blonde would let Harry fuck his mouth, soft little moans slipping past his lips as the dark-haired wizard would fuck into his mouth gone slack.</p><p>As sad as it was, that imagery was all that it took for Harry to come all over his hand, muffling a desperate groan into his arm. His body shook as he tucked his softening cock back into his boxers and pulled on his robes, his head dizzy from his orgasm. Harry composed himself in the bathroom for a moment, trying to make it look as if he hadn’t just come all over himself. </p><p>When he walked back into the classroom, his hair just a bit messier than usual and cheeks a light pink, Draco’s eyes caught on his own and a smirk appeared on his pink lips, as if he knew what Harry had just done. He let out a shaky breath and took his seat once again, thinking about literally anything that didn’t involve Draco Malfoy. </p><p>By the time class ended, Harry had managed to calm himself down, mostly because of his recent orgasm; if it weren’t for his little jerk session in the bathroom, he probably would’ve done something he’d regret. </p><p>On the way back to commons, Harry was laughing with Ron and Hermione, feeling much better about the situation. He’d just start jerking off more, and that should fix his problem, right? If he woke up a half hour earlier for his shower, he’d have plenty of time, and he wouldn’t be nearly as intoxicated with Draco during the day. Perfect. </p><p>Harry hung out with his friends for a while before heading down to dinner around five-thirty, taking the same seat he always did at the Gryffindor table. He ate dinner happily, the food delicious as always.</p><p>And of course, he couldn’t refrain from glancing over towards the Slytherin table after a while, immediately regretting his decision. Draco was finished with his dessert, but he had a spoon dangling from his lips, sliding in and out of his mouth mechanically as he seemed to be lost in conversation. </p><p>Even from here, Harry could see the usual curve of Draco’s lips and the occasional peek that he’d get of his soft pink tongue. The sight made Harry’s cock twitch, something that he was very used to, but starting to get annoyed by. </p><p>Harry sighed loudly and looked away, scrubbing a hand through his hair in exasperation. He closed his eyes briefly and took a deep breath, effectively taking his mind elsewhere. </p><p>“Fuck...” He mumbled under his breath, opening up his eyes to let out another sigh. </p><p>“Are you alright, Harry?” Hermione asked from across the table, an eyebrow cocked in question. She was as intuitive as always, but he obviously wasn’t going to tell her why he was acting so off. </p><p>“Yeah, I’m good- Just a little tired I guess.” Harry mumbled and pinched the bridge of his nose, wanting to jerk off and then sleep for a substantial amount of time. </p><p>“Okay, if you’re sure...” Hermione looked suspicious, but finally cast it off as Harry being tired or just plain moody. She glanced away back to Ron, starting a rant  on how he needed to study more, at which Ron just groaned and stuffed more mashed potatoes into his mouth. </p><p>After eating, the trio headed back up to the common room, chatting for a while and doing homework together for the remainder of the night. </p><p>At around eleven, Harry retired for the night, leaving Hermione and Ron to hang out. Peaceful sleep came easy to him, but didn’t stay for long. Soon enough, visions of blonde hair and grey eyes plagued his dreams. Spit-slicked lips and a devilish tongue played over and over in his mind, until Harry woke up hard and aching. </p><p>Harry looked around quickly as it woke, seeing that it was somewhere around 3am. He couldn’t see himself going back to bed anytime soon, so he stood up and stretched out, grabbing his cloak. He really wanted a bath, so he began to head off towards the prefects’ bathroom, knowing that he’d get privacy there at such a late hour. </p><p>Harry headed inside with a sigh, closing the door behind him and not even bothering to look and see if the room was empty. He began to slip off his sleep robes, stretching out his back languidly. He paused in his tracks as a voice cut through his trance- a voice that he knew very well from every wet dream he’d had in the past few months. </p><p>“What a coincidence seeing you here at such a late hour. Come and take a soak with me... I won’t bite. Unless you want me to.” </p><p>Fuck his life. </p>
