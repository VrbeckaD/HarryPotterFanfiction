    <p>The alarm rang throughout the castle. The Dark Lord had set his sights upon Hogwarts. <br/><br/>The Houses were in a panic, students hurriedly packing as the professors organized the evacuation. Slytherins, Hufflepuffs, Ravenclaws and Gryffindors alike left their dormitories with trunks half packed, hurried by teachers desperate to get them out of the castle. Students left in groups via Floo or (illegal) portkeys to safe houses or back to the muggle world, where it was marginally safer. <br/><br/>In the midst of the chaos a fourth year Slytherin boy turned over with a groan, waving his wand to cast a silencing spell. He didn't care what his roommates were up to now, it was Friday night after Astronomy - he deserved some sleep! He pulled his pillowed over his head for good measure, as slowly Hogwarts evacuated.<br/><br/>The next morning Kevin McAllister sat alone in the Great Hall, looking around in disbelief.<br/><br/>It was just like being nine all over again!<br/><br/></p>
<p><br/><br/>"First things first," Kevin decided looking over the Great Hall from the Headmaster's seat like a King overlooking his Court. <br/><br/>His rather empty and sad looking Court, but that wasn't too important.<br/><br/>"I need some breakfast." <br/><br/><em>Snap!</em><br/><br/>Kevin jumped as a little grey looking figure popped beside him.<br/><br/>"Mr. McAllister sir should not be in Headmaster's seat, no sir!" The house elf squeaked, staring up at Kevin with watery dark eyes.<br/><br/>"But there isn't a Headmaster anyone, all the wizards have left, look!" Kevin waved an arm around the empty hall. "Where is everyone anyways?"<br/><br/>The house elf wrung its hands together. "Because of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named sir! Professor McGonagall ordered the school evacuated, and Headmaster Snape left the school! You need to leave too."<br/><br/>"So what, wizard Darth Vader is coming to the school?" Kevin asked, feeling a sense of deja vu. <br/><br/>The house elf nodded violently. "Yes! You must leave now, it is dangerous!"<br/><br/>Yup, definitely familiar. <br/><br/>"Wait a minute, how come you're still here if the castle's evacuated? What's your name anyways?" <br/><br/>The elf blinked, his eyes watering even further as he clasped his hands to his chest. "Sir is asking for lowly elf's name! I is Terry, Mr.McAllister sir. I and the rest of the house elves serve Hogwarts. We will stay to serve it and the people in it, no matter what!"<br/><br/>Even if the people pretty much abandoned you to Dark wizards? Kevin thought. <br/><br/>"But if you serve the wizards in the castle, and I'm the only wizard here, that means that I'm pretty much in charge of keep the school safe, right?" Kevin asked. <br/><br/>Terry's eyes popped. "Yous would keep the castle safe from Dark Wizards?"<br/><br/>"Well, yeah," Kevin shrugged. "Just because you're here alone doesn't mean you should be helpless. Besides, at this point I'm an expert at dealing with home invasions."<br/><br/>To Kevin's surprise Terry started bawling into the pillowcase he was wearing. "M-Mr. McAllister is t-too kind. We house elves will do all w-we can to help!" Terry sniffled.<br/><br/>"Well I could use some food," Kevin said.<br/><br/>Terry perked up, wiping his face and snapped his fingers. A plate of pancakes, fruit and bacon appeared in front of Kevin, steaming hot. <br/><br/>"Wicked." Â </p>
<p><br/><br/>House elves, Kevin decided, were the best things ever. <br/><br/>"This is alls that was left behind in the girls dormitories," Terry said, following Kevin from the dorm to the Common Room. Kevin hummed and nodded at the decent pile of magical and non-magical items piled on the deep green rug, adding his own gains to it and making it wobble precariously. He already collected a bunch of rope, some of the Weasley's Wizarding Wheezes products, and a LOT of spell books left behind. <br/><br/>"Are yous going in the other dorms too?" Terry asked, snapping his fingers. The pile of useful looking items disappeared from the Slytherin Common Room to the Great Hall where Kevin set up. The Death Eaters were coming on Monday, guess even evil liked to have their vacations off.<br/><br/>"I thought you couldn't go the other dorms?" Kevin asked. Terry twisted his pillowcase, his ears flicking down and back. <br/><br/>"Well..." Terry hedged. <br/><br/>"I've always wondered what they all looked like," Kevin mused, already climbing out of the Common room. <br/><br/>Terry made a resigned sound and followed behind.</p>
<p><br/><br/>"So I get why they got all the kids out, but where are the professors?"<br/><br/>Kevin asked while digging through the treasure trove of prank items he found in Gryffindor's tower. Nimby, and elderly house elf who was in charge paused in organizing the books from Ravenclaw Tower.<br/><br/>"Professor McGonagall ordered the castle defenses ready. She be thinking that the Dark Lord's men will come here and the professors go get the Ministry. They come back for Hogwarts when the Dark Lord is too busy celebrating his victory." Nimby sniffed, turning to shoo another elf carrying feathers to another table in the Great Hall. <br/><br/>"The good old divide and conquer," Kevin nodded, waving his wand over the loot in front of them. "Say, you wouldn't happen to have some glue, would you?"<br/><br/>Nimby shook her head. "Not here, Drawe go check the Come and Go Room." She ordered a young looking elf. <br/><br/>Kevin looked up, wand frozen where it was spelling a set of crystal wind chimes. "What's the Come and Go Room?"<br/><br/>Ten minutes later Kevin looked up at the towering stacks of sheer STUFF packed into a room that shouldn't exist, mind whirling away. "Ok, I can work with this. Someone come get a ladder."<br/><br/>Kevin hit jackpot as he combs through the room, right between a tarnished Tiara and a pile of handbags was a crate, labeled Mr.Witman's Everlasting Glue- Guaranteed to work or your sickles back! The glue was great, but what made Kevin cackle was the multiple boxes of Weasley Wizarding <br/>Wheezes, all collected from Filch's office. <br/><br/>NOW, Kevin was in business. <br/><br/></p>
<p><br/><br/>In the United States, two people wake up in the middle of the night, a familiar feeling of unease and dread creeping over them. They dismissed it as a fluke and went back to bed. <br/><br/>Kevin was all the way over in Scotland, what mischief could he get into there?</p>
<p><br/><br/>It was time. <br/><br/>Lord Voldemort stood before his troops, his loyal followers amassed behind him. Before him stood the last bastion of the Light, the last bolt hole for the Order of the Phoenix, Hogwarts. <br/><br/>He watched the castle, normally bright and welcoming now cold and dark, the lights snuffed out. If those left of the Resistance thought they could hole up in the school then they were vastly underestimating his abilities.<br/><br/>"My Lord," Bellatrix shivered beside him, her gaunt figure shivering in excitement while her wide eyes gazed hungrily upon the castle. "We only await your command."<br/><br/>Yes, as they should. Voldemort thought, turning to face his followers. His inner circle stood behind him, wands ready. Fenrir Greyback stood apart from them, surrounded by shabbily dressed wizards and witches - his werewolves. Every one of them loyal and willing to see a rise of a new era of magic.<br/><br/>"My friends," Voldemort drew his wand, pleased as the low murmuring stopped, leaving an eerie silence. "You have been loyal to me for years, and tonight your patience will be rewarded!" <br/><br/>"The Order of the Phoenix," Voldemort paused to let a few boos die away. "Have been dealt blow after blow and last week we have had our greatest victory yet - Harry Potter is dead! At my own hands, the last hope for the Light has been extinguished. Now," He turned slightly, waving a hand to encompass the silent castle. "Now we attack their final strong hold, Hogwarts herself!" <br/>Voldemort smiled at the cheers, baring teeth and turned with his wand out. "Dementors, a fine feast awaits you."<br/><br/>The Dementors did not hesitate, taking to the air and spreading out over the lake. Voldemort laughed as what little light remained disappeared under the fog of cold and misery the Dementors brought in their wake.<br/><br/>And then everything went wrong. <br/><br/>Unholy screaming erupted as the Dementors writhed, plunging into the lake to douse the flames erupting onto their bodies. Some one screamed as several Dementors flew back towards them, collapsing among the wizards. Silver cut through the air as Patroni were cast, the silver mist driving off the creatures, too late for three of his followers. Voldemort blasted the Dementors back, before pining one down a wave of magic. <br/><br/>"What is the meaning of this?" He hissed, glaring down at the huddling figure. He ignored the fearful mumblings of the crowd behind him. "Answer me!"<br/><br/>"Meow?"<br/><br/>Voldemort watched in amazement as the Dementor flinched, curling in on itself as a small portrait floated, carried by a paper dragon. On closer inspection it was a plate with a kitten playing with a ball of yarn. It looked at the Dementor and mewed again, looking absurdly cute as it shimmered with magic. <br/><br/>Voldemort hissed and blasted it with a curse. Each time the plate meowed it released a small wave of pure positive energy, driving away the Dementors. Looking up he could see more of the plates flying around, the paper dragons breathing fire onto fleeing Dementors.<br/><br/>"What are you waiting for?" Voldemort roared at his Death Eaters. "Destroy them!" <br/><br/>Wisps of black smoke took to the air as the Death Eaters scattered, spells flashing through the dark, hitting each firework with prejudice. <br/><br/>And then.<br/><br/>"Don't banish them!" Nott screamed, blasting away a dragon. He had vanished two bright red dragons only for them to multiply and surround him. <br/><br/>He tried to move forward but the fireworks blew fire at him. He moved back and had to duck a from an attack from above. Frustrated he stopped moving in the middle of the ring of fireworks, temporarily becoming solid. He really shouldn't have done that, was his last thoughts as he fell into the waiting arms of the Giant Squid. <br/><br/>"Can't stun them, they explode!" A witch called out. A firework went out with a loud bang, singeing Avery and Bolyan, who put out the flames with a curse. <br/><br/>"Get them all in a group," Someone shouted, blowing past witches and wizards alike with three purple dragons on her tail. "We can shove them in the lake."<br/><br/>A plan established the Death Eaters scrambled to obey, twisting and turning in circles. It took longer than planned as Death Eaters kept try to avoid both fellow wix and fireworks, some of collided in mid-air to create light shows or to triple the amount of dragons in play. Once the fireworks were all herded together the Death Eaters flew back as backup came with brooms, including a kelp covered Nott. Â <br/><br/>"Blasting curses on three. One, two, TH-"<br/><br/>"Meow, meow, meow-meow, meow," The cats chanted, blocking out the wizard as the fireworks started glowing bright red. So many fireworks in close proximity triggered their final spell. <br/><br/>The Death Eaters were welcomed to Hogwarts with a spectacular fireworks show. <br/><br/>Just not for the ones in the air. <br/><br/></p>
<p><br/><br/>Inside the castle, Kevin put down his newly claimed Omnioculars. He pulled out a bulky radio and spoke into the speaker. "Enemy sighted, I repeat enemy sighted. The Welcome Dragons are finishing up, over."<br/><br/>"We sees the lights! Everything is ready," Terry said over the radio. <br/><br/>"Be careful Mr. McAllister," Nimby added. "We house elves will take care of things from our end, but you will be facing the wizards alone."<br/><br/>"Gotcha," Kevin said, and clipped the radio into his belt. About 60 wix, 20 werewolves and who knows how many magical creatures were ready to take on the castle. The dragons would only slow them down, Kevin knew, but the real fun would start when they entered the castle. <br/><br/>A castle that was very old, with many hidden passages and hiding holes. A castle that had loyal elves and a very stubborn young wizard who was practically an expert in alternative home security systems.<br/><br/>And Kevin didn't have magic, or an army of elves and a magical castle back then. <br/><br/></p>
<p><br/><br/>Harry Potter opened his eyes. He looked at the grey ceiling trying to remember what happened. He remembered camping, and the locket-<br/><br/>He lurched up, grabbing at his neck for the chain that was no longer there. He looked around, taking in the unfamiliar bed and the rickety old furniture and patted down his pockets looking for his wand. <br/><br/>"You up then?" A brusque voice asked from the doorway. Harry turned to see Albus Dumbledore standing sternly. <br/><br/>"Professor?" Harry asked, confused. He finally managed to find his wand, and gripped the wood tightly. Dumbledore was dead, he thought frantically, I saw him die. Is this a trick?<br/><br/>"Harry!" Hermione pushed past Dumbledore practically tackled him. He hugged her back, still confused as Ron came into the room behind her, staring intently at him.<br/><br/>"You gave us a scare mate," Ron said. He looked tired, more than they have been lately, and there was a shiny new scar on his chin. Hermione looked just as frazzled, once she pulled away, her hair several inches shorter, fluffing around her head like a halo. <br/><br/>"What happened?" Harry tried to ask, it came out a croak that had Hermione instantly pushing a glass of water into his hand. He drank greedily as his friends explained. <br/><br/>"We're at Hog's Head, this is Aberforth Dumbledore-Professor Dumbledore's brother," Hermione said. "We didn't know where to go next, after the Ministry." <br/><br/>And then Harry remembered. Disguising themselves as Ministry workers, getting the locket from Umbridge. The surprise ambush at the Atrium and the even more unpleasant surprise of Voldemort appearing. A flash of green light. <br/><br/>"I- Vohe killed me, Volde-" <br/><br/>"Don't say that name!" Aberforth thundered, making Harry flinch. "There's a taboo on it now, don't you pay attention?"<br/><br/>"A-a what?" Harry asked. <br/><br/>"It means You-Know-Who can track anyone who says his name, even past wards," Hermione said, settling next to him on the bed. Ron came over and place a hand on her shoulder as they both looked at him worriedly. <br/><br/>"You got hit with the Killing Curse, and we barely managed to get you out,â Ron said. âAt least we figured out you were breathing before we tried to bury you-ow!â Ron rubbed over where Hermione jabbed her elbow into his gut. <br/><br/>Harry barely cracked a smile. The Killing Curse, again? The duel came back to him in bits and pieces. Voldemort caught him with the Killing Curse, Harry could remember seeing it in sickening clarity and then nothing. <br/><br/>Wait. <br/><br/>Not nothing. There was a station. A baby.<br/><br/>And Harry remembered.<br/><br/>"Harry!" Harry looked back at his friends, who apparently were calling him for a while.<br/><br/>"I know where we need to go," Harry said breathlessly. Ron and Hermione exchanged a dubious glance and Aberforth, who Harry still wasn't quite sure about, looked on with raised brows. <br/><br/>"We need to break into Gringotts."</p>
