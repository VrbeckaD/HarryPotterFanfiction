Tolis</strong> </em></p><p>As Harry stumbled into the alley he notices people, much like he always has, and the way that some moved quickly from place to place as though they were being moved by a current, some glided through as though guided by the wind itself, some, like Harry, were sturdy and grounded, moving from one place to another with deliberate intent, and some, like the grey-eyed boy who floated even higher then the wind loved beings, danced through as though they were a burning fire set on touching everything they could find.</p><p>As grey eyes looked into green, patrons good and bad, nice and mean, light and dark, human and decidedly not stopped, and watched with bated or even held breath as the two reached for one another, mother and father watched as the Malfoy heir reached for The-Boy-Who-Lived, and gasped when their magic exploded from them in an earthy shade of lavender and violet for Harry combining with the raw deep red of Draco. As their magic settled both parents and Hagrid worried as neither had given this particular talk to their young charges quite yet and when the lights faded both had symbols glowing etched around their gently tangled hands and hadn't stopped looking into one another's eyes.</p><p>"I'm Harrison," the softly curly-haired child said, "Draconis." gasped the pale colored boy.</p><p>Slowly the Malfoy Lord and Lady approached as did Hagrid, the gamekeeper. Catching the two before they collapsed into magical exhaustion, <em>a common occurrence with soulmates, usually once a couple meets they are transferred to St. Mungo's until family can be contacted.</em> As this is the Malfoy's we're talking about Narcissa takes the boys to her manor where Hagrid may stay as well until Harry and Draco can be separated. He and Lucius are <strike>ordered</strike> requested to fetch the supplies that they can, she'll bring them for the rest before the train.</p><p> </p></div>
