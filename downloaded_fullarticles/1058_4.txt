    <p>It hurt.</p><p>Yet everything felt numb at the same time, even breathing seemed to be a conscious effort.</p><p>After his, <em>Merlin help him,</em> forsaken conversation with Dumbledore and his bouts of angry magic, did he even begin to feel only the slightest bit better.</p><p>Oh who the fuck was he kidding? He still felt like shit and he could feel his anger beginning to boil over in his veins just by thinking about the meddling old goat.</p><p>His friends had tried to offer comfort but he, at one point, literally pushed them away when it got too physical for his comfort. Even Ginny tried and he could feel an animalistic snarl in the back of his throat when she got too close, but he stayed silent even as he stepped aside with his eyes narrowed and jaw clenched tight enough one could see the taut muscle. </p><p>Currently, after having escaped the confinement of the Gryffindor common room, he wondered about the quiet halls. It was getting late, he knew, close to curfew but he had his map, cloak, and wand on him like he always did. So he could make it make to his bed later when he managed to calm down.</p><p>A few students passed him by as they went to do lord knows what, offering a few quiet lingering glances that just made his fingers curl into a bitter fist. Out of the corner of his eye, he caught the gaze a group of Slytherins that seemed to be in the same year, because he noticed the Malfoy heir in the midst. Ugh.</p><p>Picking up his pace, he took a sharp turn and just barely missed the shout from down the hall,</p><p>"-ey! Potter!"</p><p>
  <em>Not now.</em>
</p><p>Of course, Malfoy wouldn't miss the chance to torment him, but not today. </p><p>Not Anymore.</p><p>Just stopping himself from breaking into a run, he took the steps up two at a time before he emerged into a quiet and abandoned hallway.</p><p>"Heh, you knew didn't you?" Harry asked in a soft voice, eyes glancing up at the ceiling as his feet brought him to a familiar painting that told him that the Room was just a thought away. Hogwarts seemed to hum in response to his question, magic rippling for just a moment as the formally blank wall now sported a tall double door that he himself wasn't even thinking of.</p><p>"Thank you.." another, more gentle hum that seemed to caress Harry's spine.</p><p>Not wishing to waste any time with the possibility for being caught by Malfoy and whoever the fuck was with him, he opened the wide door just enough for him to slip through. Missing the dark eyes from the end of the hall that watched him silently disappear.</p>
<hr/><p>The inside of the room was barren but elegant. Windows lined two adjacent walls, offering soft light that lit up the room without effort. It was vastly different than how he had it from the DA, taller ceiling with intricate details in the way the wood seemed alive and looked soft to the touch. With the door closing behind him with a soft click, Harry took the step forward as his eyes moved along the walls, filled with paintings and portraits of people he didn't recognize and some that were just empty. As he walked, each step and scuffle of his shoes seemed to echo, the faint murmurings of the portraits catching his attention every now and then. </p><p>A small glimmer of bright white draws his attention towards the back of the wide room, and his breath catches.</p><p>A sleek, black Grand piano sits under one of the windows, the black gloss of the instrument seeming to glitter in the light, a wide bench set directly in front of the pearl white keys.</p><p>Making his way over, he let his fingers run over the black and white keys, pressing down a high note just to hear it ring in the silence. Just hearing it echo brought a bittersweet smile to his lips, a mere twitch of lips as it reminded him of the piano his Godfather had in one of the rooms at Grimmauld place. </p><p>When he had shown it to Harry, the boy had begged him to play, much to the older man's chargin.</p><p>And play he did. Harry didn't think he had ever heard something so - well..beautiful. He got two shocks that day, one being that Sirius could remember to play after so long and that the man had an amazing voice when he sang. It was rough and smooth at the same time, dropping from a bass to a high tenor when appropriate.</p><p>Harry fell in love that day. </p><p>Not to Sirius, well he already loved the man, but he fell in love with music and the instruments. Surprisingly it wasn't the piano that really captured his attention, it was the guitar that sat hidden in the corner of the room, a muggle instrument that he was sure the purebloods would have a stroke about.</p><p>Ha. That made him snort.</p><p>Sirius had taken to teaching him the guitar at his insistence, something that made Sirius light up like a dog surrounded with treats and chew toys. Harry got pretty good at it, catching up with the movement of his fingers and where they needed to be and how to keep a beat, pretty quickly. He was always a fast learner.</p><p>When he had been taken back to the Dursley's that summer, before his fourth year, he tried to listen to as much music he could, having snuck out Dudley's disk player once; but the music wasn't he wanted, they said the words too fast for him to even understand what he was saying. Thankfully, Sirius had thought to owl him a few of his own old music disks that he used to listen to when he was young. They were alright, better for his ears, but it still wasn't what he needed. He needed to make it himself.</p><p>So he found some parchment and one of his quills and scribbled down what he wanted, which more often than not was what was running through his mind and how he was feeling at the moment. Every single of his 'songs' were held and hidden in a small black journal that he kept locked in a secret compartment in his trunk. Sometimes, when he would write, he would think he was writing to Tom again..telling him everything. </p><p>Shaking himself from his musings, he glanced around and stopped when a familiar shape made his breath catch.</p><p>Standing not too far from the piano, an acoustic dark brown guitar rested in a high backed chair that seemingly looked to be taken from the Gryffindor common room, it's string's glinting innocently in the light from the windows that made him remember that it was actually late into the night. Heh. Magic. Right.</p><p>Going over to pick up the guitar, he held it in careful hands as he sat down, perched on the edge as he rested the body of the instrument on his right thigh, his left hand cradling the neck in gentle fingers.</p><p>As his mind began to blank, his fingers slowly started to strum in a tune he had only heard in his head during those lonely quiet nights in his the bed that was too small for him and the house he just didn't belong.</p><p>Harry hummed under his breath, eyes closing as he just allowed himself to relax and breathe, allowing himself to let go.</p><p>Fingers moving in a soft rhythm, the quiet raven-haired boy let his strong voice be heard, even if it was just to the portraits that watched him silently. </p><p align="center">
  <em>"And I'd give up forever to touch you</em><br/>
<em>'Cause I know that you feel me somehow</em><br/>
<em>You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be</em><br/>
<em>And I don't want to go home right now</em>
</p><p align="center"><em>And all I can taste is this moment</em><br/>
And all I can breathe is your life<br/>
And sooner or later it's over<br/>
I just don't wanna miss you tonight</p><p align="center"><em>And I don't want the world to see me</em><br/>
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand<br/>
When everything's meant to be broken<br/>
I just want you to know who I am"</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="left">A shaking breath caused him to pause, even though his fingers continued to move and his eyes began to burn, Harry couldn't bring himself to stop. Not now.</p><p align="center">
  <em>"And you can't fight the tears that ain't coming-"</em>
</p><p align="left">It seemed that just those words that slipped from his trembling lips were what started to make the boy crumble, fat and hot tears staining his heated cheeks. </p><p align="center">
  <em>"When everything's meant to be broken-"</em>
</p><p>Harry sobbed, body racking with tremors as he clutched the guitar to his chest as if it would bring him comfort as if it were the same instrument that Sirius has held and played with his own hands.</p><p>And so he screamed.</p><p>He screamed until his little heart just couldn't anymore.</p><p>Until his throat was sore and his body shuddered with the violence of a snowstorm.</p><p>Harry Potter finally broke down and let himself go.</p><p>When his body ebbed off into soft shivers, eerie bright green eyes glared out into the open space before him, a scowl caressing his features as he came to a decision. </p><p>Thankfully, it was the end of the school year so he only had a few weeks left here before he had to leave for the summer, but thankfully, that gave him just enough time to make some plans.</p><p>One was already started to form in his mind, and it brought a nasty smirk to his lips, oh he liked that.</p><p>First things first. </p><p>There was a Chamber that called for him. He was sure there was something there that could assist him.</p><p>Hogwarts hummed in approval, for even she knew.</p><p>Standing now, he set the guitar back into the same chair as carefully as he could before he strode out of the room with a purpose. Tonight he would sleep, since tomorrow was a Saturday and the last Hogsmeade weekend, he had the perfect opportunity to look for what he needed.</p><p>With a new goal and a grin on his face, Harry left The Room of Requirement with a plan.</p><p>They will rue the day. </p>
