    <p>"Harry."</p><p>"Harry?"</p><p>"Harry!" Ron yells, waving a hand in front of his face. </p><p>"Somethings wrong." He replies, not taking his eyes off of the Slytherin table where Draco was sitting, half listening to Blaise and pushing his breakfast around on his plate. He looks miserable Harry thinks, nothing like his usual pompous self.</p><p>Next to him Ron groans and slams his head onto the table. "Mate, this is getting ridiculous. All you do is watch Malfoy. Talk about Malfoy. Watch Malfoy's dot move around on the Marauders Map. Next thing you know you'll be following him around under your invisibility cloak."</p><p>Harry tried to look innocent but he just couldn't meet Ron's eyes when he replied and he was sure that he was blushing. "Why on earth would I do that?" He mumbled. And he really wouldn't. Except for that one time when he did. And the second time. But it was only twice! And he was certain that he had been up to something. But all Harry had managed to see was Malfoy walking aimlessly about the castle in the middle of the night.</p><p>Ron was silent for what felt like a lifetime. </p><p>"You…omg, you are following him! Look-" Ron said, holding up his hand to stop Harry from interrupting, "I know you think that he's up to something, and, you know what? He probably is, he's a right little shit. But Harry, this is starting to get a bit creepy, even for you." Ron was silent and watching Harry speculatively for a while as he was apparently trying to find the words for what he wanted to say next.</p><p>"Harry, I'm going to ask you something, and I want you to be honest with me okay?" He said seriously.</p><p>Harry sighed, he did not like the sound of that. “Yeah, sure, what is it?"</p><p>Ron wasted no time. "Are you in love with him?"</p><p>Harry spluttered, dribbling his mouthful of tea down his front, which was conveniently the same moment that Malfoy chose to look over at the Gryffindor table, a smirk on his face at the sight of Harry dribbling tea out of his mouth. "What?! No! Just….no! Why would you even think that?……That's…..No!"</p><p>Just then Hermione sat down next to Ron and started scooping eggs onto her plate while telling them all about her Ancient Runes research project. When she was done she noticed the silence and eyed Ron and Harry suspiciously. "What were you two talking about?"</p><p>"Harry's crush on the Ferret." Ron supplied, shoving bacon into his mouth. </p><p>“Oh, Harry! I’m so happy that you’re finally able to admit it.” Hermione was beaming at him.</p><p>"Excuse me? I don’t know what you’re talking about. I do not have a crush on Malfoy!" He said a little too loudly and probably a little too defensively. It wasn't strictly true at all if he was being honest though. Which he wasn't. He looked around to make sure that no one had heard his little outburst.</p><p>He's not sure when it started, maybe at the start of the school year. When they all came back for Seventh year, he noticed that Malfoy looked a bit different. He had filled out a bit, he was less scrawny and more….muscular. His shoulders were broader, he was still pointy but in a more attractive way than before. Honestly, he was beautiful. He’d really grown into himself and he was now also an inch or so taller than Harry was. And his arse, oh Merlin, his arse, it was mesmerising. But the worst thing, oh the worst thing, was the hair. He had grown it out long enough that he could tie it back and sometimes little wisps of hair would fall out of the tie at the nape of his neck and fall over his face.</p><p>But despite all of his attractive qualities, Harry had been (discreetly) watching him since the start of the year, certain that he had been up to something, and he noticed that he, without a doubt, was still a prat. For which Harry was very grateful for because it meant that it was easier for him to try and ignore the attraction. It wasn't that he had a problem with being attracted to boys, he had long since accepted that he swung that way and it was much more acceptable in the Wizarding world than it was in the Muggle world. It was just the fact that it was Malfoy. Why did it have to be Malfoy of all people?</p><p>“Harry,” Harry turned to face Hermione who was still looking at him. "You know you can always talk to me and Ron right? About anything. We'll always be here for you. Always. Right, Ron?" She prompted, nudging Ron with her elbow.</p><p>"Oh, yeah, right. Always here mate." He replied, slapping Harry on the back and giving him what was probably meant to be an encouraging smile through a mouthful of bacon. </p><p>Hermione rolled her eyes, "Honestly Ron,” she scolded disapprovingly but Harry could see the fond smile threatening to break through on her face. Ron and Hermione had been pining over each other for years now and he was relieved when they had finally got their shit together and started dating over the Summer. In truth though, he was a bit jealous of them, he wished that he could have what they had with someone and he was also scared that he wouldn't live long enough to have the opportunity. </p><p>"Errr, yeah. I know. I just don't have anything to talk about. Honestly." He added at the knowing look that Hermione was giving him. It's not that he didn't want to tell them that he fancied blokes. He knew that they would be accepting of it and they had probably already figured it out. Well, Hermione has probably already figured it out and informed Ron. He just wasn't ready.</p><p>"Well, we'd better get going. We can't be late for Potions. I don't want to give Professor Snape another reason to take more points from Gryffindor." Harry knew exactly what she was referring to. The incident a couple of weeks ago at the beginning of March when he had sassed Snape and lost Gryffindor 100 points in one fell swoop. Snape was still on the warpath about it. </p><p>"Yay, Potions first thing on a Monday morning, I can't wait." Hermione rolled her eyes at him as he got up from the table and slung his bag over his shoulder and followed them both out of the Great Hall, sneaking a glance over at the Slytherin table on his way out. Malfoy had already left.</p><p>*****</p><p>"Today, we will be brewing Amortentia. Or attempting to at least, for I know that you are all basically useless." Snape droned, looking directly at Harry. "Who can tell me what Amortentia is?"</p><p>As per usual, Hermione's hand shot into the air and, as per usual, Snape ignored her existence. Harry glared at him. </p><p>"No one? Well, I’m hardly surprised. Amortentia is the worlds most powerful love potion….” Harry tuned out the rest of whatever Snape was saying and looked over to where Malfoy was sitting at the back of the classroom next to Pansy Parkinson. </p><p>Pansy was whispering something that was apparently funny into his ear but he seemed wholly uninterested. Just sitting there, head resting in his hand, doodling in his notebook and occasionally offering her a non-committal response. All of a sudden, as if feeling eyes upon him, Malfoy looked up and looked at Harry. He seemed startled for a brief second before his face slipped into the usual glare that he seems to save especially for Harry. </p><p>"Potter!" Hermione kicked him under the table and he looked up to see Snape glaring at him.</p><p>"Yes, Sir?"</p><p>"I said, you're partnered with Mister Malfoy for this lesson. Move your things to his desk. Now!" He snapped when Harry continued to sit there, gaping uselessly. He slowly packed up his things and made his way over to the now vacant seat next to the Slytherin, while the whole class seemed to be watching him. </p><p>"Well, well, well, Potter, what a pleasure this is to be blessed with the presence of our favourite Saviour. Is it not a pleasure, Draco?" Smirked Zabini turning a knowing eye to Draco. </p><p>"Fuck off Blaise," he said under his breath, staring resolutely at his textbook, still doodling.</p><p>"Er, well, I guess it is…..a pleasure, Zabini" Harry replied uncertainly, he had no idea what was going on here.</p><p>"Oh please, call me Blaise," he said holding out his hand for Harry to shake. "We should really get comfortable with each other.” Harry reached out and shook his hand.</p><p>"Blaise, I said Fuck. Off." Draco snarled, a pink tinge rising on his cheeks. </p><p>"Touchy, touchy. Don't worry Potter, I'm sure you'll get used to it." He added before turning around to his own desk where he was partnered with Neville. </p><p>Harry looked between Draco and Blaise, still not really sure what was going on before he dropped his bag to the floor and slumped into his seat. "Umm, was Blaise just flirting with me?"</p><p>Draco glared at him. "Don't flatter yourself, Potter." He spat out, though it was lacking his usual venom. He just sounded tired. </p><p>Okay then.</p><p>After a few minutes of uncomfortable silence, he looked up at Draco, "So, um, what do you want me to do then? For the potion.”</p><p>Draco busied himself with setting up the cauldron and without looking at Harry replied, "Go and get the ingredients from the storeroom and then you can just sit there, looking pretty and not touch anything while I make the potion. I'm not going to fail this just because you're shite at potions."</p><p>For a moment Harry wanted to be offended but then he turned to Draco with a teasing smirk, "You think I look pretty?” Maybe this lesson wouldn’t be so bad after all.</p><p>Draco seemed to be blushing even more now, if it was actually blushing. He looked beautiful. Harry wondered if he blushed like that when he….no. He turned away quickly, silently scolding himself for where his thoughts were going and trying to think of something else before the situation in his pants got any worse. Snape in lingerie. Yes, that should do it. Snape in lingerie. </p><p>Draco looked stunned for a minute before he gathered himself. "That's not what I said".</p><p>"Oh, but that's exactly what you said, isn't Draco?" Blaise had turned around again and was grinning at them both.</p><p>"Blaise, I will end you," Draco said through gritted teeth. "How about you turn around and focus on your own potion, seeing as your partnered with Longbottom here I wouldn't suggest taking your eyes off of him for very long, there's no telling what he'll do to the potion." He looked at Neville with a sneer as he said this.</p><p>"Hey!" Neville replied indignantly "I mean, I know I'm not the best at Potions but I do try."</p><p>"Obviously not hard enough, Longbottom, you're a disaster, it's a wonder they let you into this class at all" Draco said scathingly. </p><p>Still a prat, Harry thought. "You know Malfoy, I know that having a stick permanently shoved up your arse is practically a Malfoy tradition and all, but have you ever thought of having it magically removed?" Harry was pretty pleased with himself when he heard Blaise let out a snort of laughter. </p><p>"You know Harry, I have it on pretty good authority that there's something else he would rather have sho-"</p><p>Harry never did get to hear the end of that sentence because at that moment Malfoy shot Blaise with a silencing spell. Blaise broke down in silent laughter and fell off his chair causing Snape to take five points from Slytherin. Bitterly, Harry thought if that had been him, Snape would have delighted in taking fifty points from Gryffindor.</p><p>Malfoy glared at Blaise and then turned his glare on Harry, "Just go and fetch the ingredients, Potter" He ordered imperiously, spitting out the last word. But his words were a bit at odds with the blush that was still furiously spreading across his aristocratic cheekbones. </p><p>Harry thought about arguing but decided it wasn't worth it. Especially as Snape was walking past, probably looking for an opportunity to take more points from Gryffindor. He got up and walked towards the store cupboard to get the ingredients they would need for the potion. Ron was already in there.</p><p>"So, how is it being partnered with the Ferret?" He inquired while rummaging through the shelves looking for the rest of his ingredients.</p><p>"He's a prat. As per usual" he said, for lack of anything better to say while he started looking for his own ingredients.</p><p>"Are-" Ron started before Snape appeared.</p><p>"Potter, Weasley, this isn't social hour in the Gryffindor Common Room. Ten points from each of you. Back to your seats.” They both exited the storeroom after Snape and went their separate ways back to their seats.</p><p>When Harry got back to their desk Malfoy had finished setting up their cauldron. He eyed Harry coldly before grabbing the ingredients and making a start on their potion. Harry tried to make an effort to help but every time he tried to touch something or reached over to stir their potion Malfoy batted his hands away so after a while he just gave up and let him get on with it. </p><p>They had been brewing for nearly an hour when Malfoy leant over Harry to grab some more ingredients. At the same time, Harry had taken a breath in. He had never been so close to Malfoy before and he smelled, well, he smelled good. Like vanilla and…something else that he couldn't quite put his finger on. He breathed in again, savouring the smell and then mentally slapped himself when he realised what he was doing. He hoped that Malfoy hadn't noticed. If he did then he didn't say anything. </p><p>By the time their potion was done Harry was nearly asleep. A common occurrence in potions as the air was so stifling and warm. He jerked to attention when he heard Snape's voice.</p><p>"You should all be done with your potions by now. You will each place a flask of your Amortentia on my desk for grading, remember to label it with both of your names otherwise you will not be graded. Although for some of you, that may make no difference anyway." He looked pointedly at Seamus who's cauldron had exploded halfway through the lesson. "You will all take note of what it smells like to you and I want 6 inches on it’s composition by the beginning of next lesson. Class dismissed."</p><p>"No guesses as to what it smells like to you. The Weaslette I'll bet." Malfoy mumbled bitterly as he started to clean up their station. </p><p>"What? Why would it smell like Ginny? And don't call her ‘Weaslette' that's not her name." Harry wasn't in the mood for any more of Malfoy's shit today. "Besides, I can't even smell the potion, the whole bloody room smells like you so maybe you should wear a little less cologne, yeah?"</p><p>When Malfoy didn't say anything, he looked up only to see Malfoy sitting in his chair with his mouth hanging open and Blaise in front of him trying to stifle a laugh but failing miserably. </p><p>"What the bloody hell is so funny?" He snapped. He was tired and sweaty from sitting in a stifling room for so long and he was starting to get irritable.</p><p>Malfoy seemed to gather himself and hastily started throwing his stuff into his satchel, shaking his head avoiding all eye contact with Harry. It was Blaise who answered him in the end. "Potter, you do know what Amortentia is right?"</p><p>"Well yeah, it's a love potion." Harry wasn't sure where this was going. </p><p>"Yes….and…?" He was waiting eagerly for Harry to answer.</p><p>Harry thought for a moment. "Well, I wasn't really listening when Snape was talking about it, I kind of zoned out."</p><p>Blaise gave up trying to hold in his laughter at that and burst into hysterics. Draco glared at him. "Oh, this is too good. Draco, do you want to tell him or should I?" </p><p>"Leave it alone Blaise." He was resolutely not looking in Harry’s direction as he finished packing up his things.</p><p>"Aw, Drakey, don't be like that." Blaise cooed innocently "Do you want to tell us what yours smells like?" He said raising an eyebrow. "I bet I can guess."</p><p>"No, I don't think I will. And if you ever call me that again, so help me Merlin, I will hex your bollocks off," Malfoy growled before picking up his bag and disappearing from the classroom. </p><p>Before he could even open his mouth to start questioning Blaise, Ron and Hermione walked past and dragged him out of the classroom. He wasn't entirely sure what had just happened.</p>
