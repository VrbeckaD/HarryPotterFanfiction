    <p>New York was one of the dreariest places Morgan Alcorn had ever been in her life. It wasn’t just the grey weather that put a dampener on everything, it was the overwhelming industrialisation of everything, all full of smoke and noise that suffocated you and turned your lungs black.</p>
<p>The only thing that made up for it was the constant bustle of people, the thrum of life and activity no matter where you looked. Morgan couldn’t help a quick smile at all the individuals, each with their own intricate lives, hopes and dreams, all trying to push their way through the crowded streets. Maybe one was on their way to a new job, maybe that one had just got engaged, married, announced the birth of their child. Maybe one of them was carrying very rare Wyvern eggs that were at risk of hatching at any moment.</p>
<p>“Hey, watch it lady!”</p>
<p>The man’s harsh New York accent quickly wiped the smile off her face and she shot a glare over her shoulder, steely eyes boring daggers into him as he pushed past her much harder than necessary.</p>
<p>“Fuck off, you,” she muttered, drawing her messenger bag tighter to her. Her cargo wasn’t something she wanted damaged, their worth beyond any money or gold in the world. Part of the reason she was in America was the eggs themselves, she needed land and big open spaces where no one would bother her, and she could continue her work in peace. Apparently America had exactly that, for a lot cheaper than anywhere in Britain, and she could deal with Americans-</p>
<p>“Witches live among us! They are a scourge upon our Earth, they control everything from behind their magical shroud. How long before they decide to eradicate us? Our only hope is to eradicate them, make the first move like we did all those years ago in Salem town…”</p>
<p>Fucks sake, more noise. This time from a sour faced woman on the steps to the bank, the bank that Morgan realised with a stab of annoyance was her destination for today.</p>
<p>Morgan rolled her eyes, as long as she didn’t have to deal with these Americans in particular. She locked eyes with a dark haired boy handing out leaflets to the side of the shouting woman, his gaze shadowed slightly by his wide brimmed hat. As Morgan frowned at him, he flushed and quickly averted his eyes.</p>
<p><em>Great job</em>, Morgan thought, <em>you scared an innocent lad for no reason.</em></p>
<p>She forced a softer expression onto her face, clearing her throat and approaching him. A foot away from him, she realised that she had no idea what she was planning on saying and instead chose to snatch a leaflet from his outstretched hand, quickly giving it a skim over. The quick action made him jump much higher than necessary.</p>
<p> “So you believe all this stuff, about witches and shit?” she glanced back to him and he shrugged, eyes fixed on the floor.</p>
<p>Morgan hummed, clearly he wasn’t much of a talker. Good thing she spoke enough for ten people.</p>
<p>“I’d believe in them if they believed in me,” she laughed at her own joke, and was met with the boy’s blank stare. At least he was looking at her now.</p>
<p>“Why are your clothes so strange?” He blurted, cheeks going red as he did so. Clearly he hadn’t meant to ask that question but it was bothering him too much to keep to himself.</p>
<p>Morgan looked down at what she was wearing, comparing it a woman standing nearby. While the woman was dressed in the height of 1920’s New York fashion, Morgan was wearing an ill-fitting large jacket, adorned with a sprig of lavender on the lapel. Her trousers beneath were striped and finished just above her ankle, a small sliver of skin visible between them and her clunky, mud-caked boots. It wasn’t her fault her work forced her to dress practically over what actually looked good on her. She supposed she probably didn’t fit in very well to the urban setting.</p>
<p>Morgan shot the boy a smile.</p>
<p> “I have a very strange job,” she said mysteriously, inviting him to ask more.</p>
<p>“Wh- what kind of job?” he stammered back. Morgan’s eyes flicked to the ranting woman, still too caught up completely in her own words to notice them. She leaned in close to the guy, he was a lot older now that she could see him properly, only a few years younger than her, he just carried himself like a timid child.</p>
<p>“You know what wyvern is?”</p>
<p>He shook his head, eyes wide. Of course he wouldn’t.</p>
<p>“You know what a dragon is?”</p>
<p>She heard his breath hitch. He nodded.</p>
<p>“A wyvern is an animal like a dragon, but it has two legs instead of four,” she giggled and tapped her mouth, “And I breed them.”</p>
<p>The young man immediately recoiled, and Morgan’s face fell a little. He thought she was making fun of him. She tilted her head, daring him to not believe her.</p>
<p>“Credence!” The woman shouted over at him, he ducked his head and turned to her. Her eyes were fixed on Morgan, thunderous. Something told her she had been clocked as an outsider and she smirked up at the woman, saluting with the leaflet and turning away.</p>
<p>“You guys really believe this bullshit?” she asked loudly, not directed at anyone in particular. Guess her bank errand could wait another day.</p>
<p>Frustrated and dejected feeling but too proud to face the woman again, Morgan dragged her heels as she made her way back down the street. Lightning quick, something flashed past her feet, too big to be a rat and too small to be a dog or cat. Instinctively, Morgan’s hand shot out and firmly grabbed it, bundling it into her jacket and into a side alleyway, apperating swiftly away to a secondary location.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Up on a rooftop of some random building she found, Morgan wrestled with the mass as it squirmed and wiggled, trying to get out her grasp. Eventually she was able to hold it with two hands, raising it to eye level to try and get a good look at it.</p>
<p>“Ow, ow, ow!” She hissed as her right hand was pricked by about a hundred spikes at once from the creature, blood beginning to run down her wrist, “Oh, you tiny bastard.”</p>
<p>The creature blinked at her, and if she didn’t know any better she’d say it was laughing, the small noise coming from the back of its throat. The knarl snuffled in response, giving up it’s bid for freedom.</p>
<p>“Now,” she spoke half to herself, half to the creature, “What are you doing in the middle of a city? There’s no woodland nearby. Hm?”</p>
<p>She sighed, carefully transferring it to rest against her chest so she was no longer being impaled, tutting at the mess made of her hand.</p>
<p>“I know baby, I’m sorry I scared you,” her voice softened, “How the hell did you get here though?”</p>
<p>Morgan glanced around at the New York skyline, before her eyes drifted to the solution.</p>
<p>“Of course, that’s where you came from,” she laughed, “The biggest park in Manhattan. I think…”</p>
<p>She shook her head, glancing down at the large eyes of the knarl that tracked her every expression, “Right then, let’s get you home. I have shit to do.”</p>
