    <p>Draco crossed his arms and sighed, glancing at the Manor’s front entrance.</p><p>Suddenly, the sound of someone speeding down the wide stairs to the foyer caught his attention, and he spun.</p><p>Kaus grinned, jumping off from the tenth step, his boots providing excellent traction on the snowy marble stairs. “Father!”</p><p>Draco stepped forward and caught his son easily, unsurprised by the sudden manoeuvre. “Ooph.”</p><p>“Where’s your Papa, Kaus?” he asked, looking up the stairs.</p><p>“He’s coming. He says he has one more thing to pack.” Kaus said, wriggling to get down.</p><p>Draco released him, smiling and watching the boy run over to talk to the serpent curled at his Great-Grandfather’s feet in the large portrait on the wall.</p><p>The serpent straightened slightly, moving to meet the boy’s eyes with a vague sort of fondness - insofar as a snake could present fondness.</p><p>Draco turned back to the stairs just as Harry descended, a large picnic basket in one hand, Orion hanging onto the other. He smiled at them, and Harry grinned back.</p><p>“Ready to go, then?” Draco asked.</p><p>Harry nodded. “Absolutely.”</p><p>Draco kissed him lightly. “You get to pry your son away from that serpent.” he murmured. Kaus was six and very focused - sometimes.</p><p>Harry laughed. “All right.”</p><p>Orion looked up at Draco, his silvery eyes wide. “Dad, where are we going?” he asked plaintively, nudging the basket.</p><p>“If Papa won’t tell you, why do you think I will, Orion?” Draco asked, ruffling his hair, then scooping him up, leaving the basket on the floor.</p><p>Orion pouted.</p><p>“It is a surprise, Ri.” Harry supplied, tugging Kaus by the hand. “I’ve got the basket, love.” he picked it up before Draco could.</p><p>Draco nodded thanks.</p><p>“It’s a picnic, right?” Kaus asked.</p><p>“Of course - the surprise is the <i>where</i>, little one.” Draco laughed.</p>
