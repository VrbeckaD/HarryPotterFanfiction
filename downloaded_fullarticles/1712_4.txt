    <p>“I forgive you.”</p><p>The Dark Lord freezes, watching the green-eyed boy in shock. It’s been years. He killed the boy a long time ago, convinced that everything would be complete, <em>sane</em>, if he did so.</p><p>Yet here the boy still stands, translucent and flickering between life and death.</p><p>The boy looks at him now, with no hatred, only calm and… this warmth that Voldemort does not understand.</p><p>It hurts to look.</p><p>“Turn away from me, Potter—”</p><p>“No,” he says softly, and Voldemort flinches because he is not a weakling to be coddled, and yet, the boy’s <em>eyes—</em> “I forgive you, Tom.”</p><p>“Don’t say that name!” he hisses. Tom Riddle died the day he made that diary. But those green eyes are as inescapable as Avada Kedevra. “Stop <em>looking </em>at me, stop existing, stop staying that—”</p><p>The boy’s cold hand goes through the Dark Lord’s cheek. The cold feels like rot and rejuvenation settling into his skin.</p><p>“Tom… I forgive you.”</p><p>Potter takes another step forward and glides his hand towards the Dark Lord’s, like a trail of frost spreading across a window.</p><p>“I forgive the murder, the hate, the fear, because I <em>know </em>you. I’m your soul. I’m the one you can’t live without and… I forgive you.”</p><p>They stand in silence until the Dark Lord realizes that his tears are cold.</p>
