    <p>I could hardly keep my eyes open at breakfast that March morning. I looked up to the High Table to see a pair of ebony eyes peering down at the Ravenclaw table where I sat. The eyes stopped on me and stayed there a few seconds before moving on.</p><p>I recognized them as the stoic eyes of the Potions Master, who visibly inhaled and sighed. He turned his black stare back to me after scanning the crowded hall. I tried to look elsewhere but it was too late. Severus noticed me glancing up at him. His eyes bored into me intensely. Then he started a conversation with Professor Vector who was sitting next to him.</p><p>I hadn't gotten much rest the past two days, due to studying for my OWLs. I wasn't looking forward to Snape's class today either. I knew it would be unbearable as usual.</p><p>I got up after eating what I could of breakfast and walked out of the Great Hall. I turned halfway to see the dark professor's gaze lingering on me as I left.</p><p>Unfortunately, Potions was my first class. I made my way down to the dungeons and into the classroom. I sat near the back, where hopefully nobody would bother me. The students filed in slowly before Severus. He always had to make an entrance.</p><p>I laid my head down on the table. If I could only rest for a few more moments...</p><p>Suddenly, the students around me made me aware of his presence. My head shot up to see the billowing robes and the intense black eyes glaring into the group of students seated.</p><p>Severus started his lecture on the potion we would be brewing today. I tried to take notes as he spoke. I just felt more and more drowsy. Finally, my head found the table again and I drifted off.</p><p>I heard a hard book smash the table next to my head. "Am I boring you, Miss Dancer?" The satin voice of the Professor laced with venom awoke me from my nap.</p><p>"No, I just didn't get enough sleep last night." I protested groggily, lifting up my head. I dreaded meeting his eyes so I stared at the floor.</p><p>Severus did not like my ignoring his gaze. He sighed. "You will look at me when I am speaking to you, Miss Dancer. 80 points from Ravenclaw."</p><p>My housemates groaned in unison around me. That got my attention.</p><p>"80?!" I screamed, immediately glaring at him in disbelief. "But that's too much! I can't help it if I'm tired!"</p><p>"Silence!" Severus shouted back at me. "Or shall I take more?!"</p><p>I shook my head no.</p><p>"You will remain after class." He shot me a death glare, then stormed off to his desk.</p><p>Luna gave me a sympathetic glance, turning back to her cauldron.</p><p>Soon the class ended and I tried to leave with Luna and my other friends.</p><p>We all made a barrage for the door.</p><p>"Come on, before he makes you stay!" Luna said quickly.</p><p>I heard Severus cough deeply from his desk. "Miss Dancer."</p><p>Luna shot me a compassionate look before walking out with our friends.</p><p>I walked slowly back into the room apprehensively. "Leave me alone."</p><p>Severus crossed the room in a few swift strides. "Not until you tell me why you are sleeping in my class."</p><p>"I study really late at night." I answered.</p><p>"As if that is aiding you in passing my class." Severus looked at me. He took a deep breath and sighed. "Follow me."</p><p>He led me to his desk where he pulled a vial out of the drawer. "Do you know what this is?"</p><p>I shook my head. "I guess sleeping potion?"</p><p>"It is Sleeping Draught. Return it when you are finished or you shall brew me an entire batch in detention. Have I made myself clear, Miss Dancer?"</p><p>I nodded. "Yes, Professor."</p><p>He gave me the vial and slammed the drawer shut. "I never want to see you sleeping in class again. And by that I mean any class."</p><p>"Yes, sir." I nodded and turned to leave, not daring to look back at him.</p><p>Severus sighed when I had gone and returned to marking parchment.</p>
