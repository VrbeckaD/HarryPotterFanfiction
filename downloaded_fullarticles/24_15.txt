    <p>“Y/N! Watch out!” Yelled a student bystander. Immediately then you were hit with a snowball on the side of the face. The side of your face begun to feel the coldness and then traveled to the rest of your head. </p><p>“Guys, stop playing around. We got to get to class!” You laughed at them, compacting snow into a small ball and throwing it at them. After six winters being spent at Hogwarts, you should have been prepared for the snow fight the moment the first few snowflakes started coming down from the sky. Of course, your mind was wandering while walking back to the school’s large castle. You didn’t think your friends would be hiding in the white bushes; waiting for you to walk by. </p><p>“Maybe if you didn’t take so long to come here Y/N we wouldn’t have to rush to class.” Said Ruben sarcastically while picking up the pace. Looking at the time, you realized classes were about to begin in three minutes. You too started running to class with your friends. You couldn’t bear to be late to class again. You already had several tardies in other classes, and even though they didn’t land you in detention, this class was different - this was Potions. Your mind started panicking, wondering how you were even going to make it there on time. You swung through the halls, and your wet shoes from the snow left prints to mark your tracks to class. After turning one last corner, your eyes met with the chamber door belonging to the dimly lit potions classroom. This fueled you fire to run even faster to the classroom. Seconds before the bell was to ring, you made it into the classroom and took your seat quickly, breathing heavily as your body was hunched over in exhaustion. As the bell rang, you looked around the room for your friends and they were nowhere to be seen...</p><p>Oh shit, they’re still out there. </p><p>You could hear your friends’ voices shouting down the hall as they were running toward the entrance. Before they could make it to the classroom, the doors slammed shut from a distance. A loud thud came from the doors, causing a small fit of laughter from the students. Over in the corner, you saw the professor with his wand raised up at the door. The features of his face, even in the lowly lit corner, was still clear as day. His face was always void of all emotion, except for annoyance. He slowly put down his wand, looked over his students, and cleared his throat. Hearing the darkly dressed and feared Professor make a sound, the room fell into silence. The students' eyes looked straight at the Professor, while he peered into the eyes of his students to assure that everyone was giving their full attention to him. Some students, after looking into his black orbs, would avert their eyes from him in fear. </p><p>“Open your books. Today’s Lesson is about Somnum Elixir.” Professor Snape said, keeping the same monotone sound to his voice. You opened up your textbook and followed along with his lesson. Around the room, you could hear quills scratching on to paper, and students sighing while trying to keep up. Professor Snape was fast-past with his teaching. You had to pay attention to every word because even the smallest thing would show up on an exam. It was almost like he is trying to find a needle in a haystack when he makes his tests. After the verbal lesson, we had to recreate the potion based on the notes. </p><p>“Go to your cauldrons now and begin making the potion.” Said the Professor, gesturing toward the tables in the back. Each table was already prepared with everything we needed to recreate the potion - a cauldron, herbs, and tools. Before you were about to begin, more knocks were heard at the door. Once the Professor heard the knocks, he moved swiftly over to the door and opened it wide to find your three friends shivering in the cold. </p><p>“Can we come in now? You made your point, Professor.” Ruben said in irritation with the professor and his unjust actions. Dahlia glared at him and elbowed him in response to his interaction with Snape.</p><p>“What he meant to say, Professor, is that we are sorry for being late to class and that it will not happen again.” Said Dahlia with her head pointed to the ground. The Professor looked at all them for a moment. By this point, students were sneaking around the classroom to get a better view of the punishment Snape was going to give the students. </p><p>“Let’s see,” he said, “one, two, and three late students...” He used his left hand to count off the students who stood, still freezing outside his door. </p><p>“60 points total away from Ravenclaw. Now get in.” Said the Professor with a tinge of annoyance in his voice. Once he said that a large combined sigh in disappointment came from the Ravenclaws in the room. With their heads looking down, all your friends walked into the classroom and found their way to the table next over to you. The Professor closed the door afterward and turned around. All the students who were spying on the interaction ran back to their tables and pretended as if they were doing their work the whole time. You looked at your friends who quickly lit the fire under the cauldron at their table to get some more warmth. Snape walked over to their table with some supplies and placed it on the top. </p><p>“Make Somnum Elixir. Just because you all decided to play in the snow doesn’t excuse you from the lesson.” He said and walked away from the table. </p><p>“And how are we supposed to do that without directions, Professor?” Asked Dahlia, worried. The Professor stopped without turning around. </p><p>“Figure it out.” He said briefly and continued to walk away. </p><p>You looked at your friends who were as lost as a couple of kids walking around in the haunted woods. You felt bad for them, but you had to focus on your own work, too. Despite you careless behavior in classes, you were still an A plus student. You enjoyed Potions and Herbology greatly, as you had your own secret stash of ingredients to create your own brews alone. While looking at your friends cluelessly touching different tools and staring around the room at the other student’s work for assistance, you let out a deep breath.</p><p>‘They’ll never figure this out on their own...” You said to yourself in a whisper. You were going to bail you friends out of this unfortunate situation, despite it being their karma for a prank. You took your notes and jotted down the important information that was most relevant for you to make this brew on a separate paper, then crumbling the original, and tossing it on their table without the Professor noticing. Ruben opened up the paper and looked at you with a smile. He mouthed the word, “Thank you” and the group was saved from a failing grade. You continued to work on your potion, now happy that they had the means to complete theirs. </p><p>----------------------------------------</p><p>After an hour passed, Professor Snape walked around all the tables in the classroom to view the Elixirs of each person. He was about accuracy in all forms - colour, taste, smell, e.t.c... He already gave failing grades to a few students while making his way finally toward you. Your potion looked correct to you, but he stared at it for at least a minute. The longer he stared at your potion and stirred it, the more it worried you became that something was wrong with it. “Did I forget something?” You thought to yourself, trying to hide all sense of worry in your face. </p><p>“A.” He said without care and walked over to your friend’s table. </p><p>You were excited that your potion was correct. Your brew was one of the only ones to get an A in the class. He never gave you attention for your skill in Potions and often ignored you, but it was better to go unnoticed than to be a troublemaker. Troublemakers never get the “right” attention you wanted from him in the classroom. Your excitement was quickly interrupted by the Professor’s voice. </p><p>“Not bad.” He said to your friends. Their faces grew small smirks at his comment about their potion.</p><p>“However,” he said, “ you all would have earned an B if you didn’t cheat off of Miss Y/L/N. Your group and Miss Y/L/N fail.” His eyes then directed to you. Your face became red as you were embarrassed that you were called out in front of the class. All the students in the room stared at you and the Professor, wondering what his next move would be. He looked under their text books and found your notes lying beneath it. He grabbed it and slammed it on your desk. He lowered his head so that his eyes could meet with yours. </p><p>“Detention.” He said, his eyes piercing through yours. You began to shake slightly in your spot. While he still stared at you, the ending bell rang. He lifted himself up and began to walk to his desk. </p><p>“Class dismissed, except for Miss Y/L/N.” Said Professor Snape, standing at his desk while dragging his eyes across the students to you.</p><p>“Good luck.” Said Dahlia. Your friends frowned at you and walked out the classroom with the rest of the students. Once the door shut closed, you knew you were in for some hell. </p><p>This was not the kind of attention you wanted.</p>
