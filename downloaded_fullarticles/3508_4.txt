    <p>Draco was getting frustrated with the pug faced Slytherin girl beside him who clung onto his bony arm with a firm grip. His attempts at trying to decline his parents wishes to escort her to the Yule Ball failed rather quickly as soon as his father threatened to break his Nimbus 2001. Of course he couldn't refuse.</p><p>"Draco, are you even listening to me?" Draco couldn't concentrate because all of his thoughts were on Hermione Granger. Why couldn't he get her out of his head?</p><p>He shook his head as if to get her out.</p><p>"Hmm? What did you say?" He asked not really caring if he heard her or not.</p><p>"I said. 'Are we going to sit down inside?" She repeated.</p><p>Draco didn't really want to be around people right now. All he could think about was the bushy haired Gryffindor.</p><p>"No. You go ahead, I'm just going to get some air." He tells her and un-clings her arm from his. She straightened herself up and strutted over to the Great Hall where the actual ball would be taking place. Draco took a few deep breaths.</p><p>He almost asked her a week ago. He almost asked Hermione Granger. He almost didn't feel like himself. All of a sudden thousands of whispers break out from Hogwarts, Beauxbatons and Durmstrang students alike. He turned his body, facing where the whispers were coming from.</p><p>Descending the stair case was the most beautiful witch he had ever seen. When he squinted his eyes to see clearer he noticed it was Granger. The 'Know it all Mudblood'. However, the word 'mudblood' seemed to be the wrong word to describe the girl in the periwinkle blue dress descending down the stair case. Draco stood there in shock. That was until a familiar Bulgarian Quidditch player and Tri-Wizard champion took her arm. Draco's jaw clenched. Viktor Krum lead Granger towards the other champions who were already heading into the Great Hall to start off the ball. He couldn't help but feel jealous of Krum. He wanted to be the one to hold her hand to dance all night with her. To hold her.</p><p>Blaise Zabini was the first to notice that Draco was out of sorts. Blaise noticed him staring and went to see what he was staring at or 'who' in Draco's case.</p><p>"Why don't you ask her for a dance?" Blaise asked his best friend. Draco whipped his head around in surprise, reluctantly taking his eyes of Hermione.</p><p>"I don't know what you're talking about." He mumbles a reply, he could almost feel blood rushing up to his cheeks.</p><p>"I know you're supposed to be all 'Anti- Muggleborn, Pureblood Supremacist' but you're embarrassing yourself just sitting here staring. Even Pansy is starting to notice and she's not even that bright. Go Draco," Blaise encourages him.</p><p>Draco tookÂ a deep breath in and out before heading over to Krum and Hermione, but before he can even take a step Hermione starts chatting to Scarhead and Weasel. Of all people she had to be talking to Potter and Weasley, but the conversation soon turned dark. Draco could hear Granger and Weasley's yelling match from his corner.</p><p>"YOU'RE FRATERNISING WITH THE ENEMY!" Weasley yelled at Hermione, his pale freckled face turning red.</p><p>"THE ENEMY? HOW DARE YOU! THIS TOURNAMENT IS ABOUT INTERNATIONAL MAGICAL COOPERATION! MAKING FRIENDS!" Hermione yelled back. Weasley grabbed Potter's arm who looked like the pacifist he was when it came to Granger and Weasley, and stormed out of the Great Hall, but Granger didn't follow her friends like he thought she would.</p><p>"Go after her." Blaise whispers into his ear. Draco almost forgot he was there. Without being told twice he rushed after the beautiful Gryffindor heading towards the snow covered courtyard.</p><p>When Draco reach the courtyard he found Hermione sobbing violently on the floor of the covered hallway. As if sensing someones presence she snapped her head up.</p><p>"What do you want Malfoy?! I have no self-esteem left so your names won't make a difference." She said softly and starting crying again. Draco slowly walked towards her unsure of whether he was being kind or stupid but as soon as he stiffly knelt down and wrapped one arm around the crying girl. The next move surprised him. Instead of moving away Granger sobbed into his chest. Draco wrapped his other arm around her.</p><p>"I heard you and the Weasel yelling. May I ask what happened?" He inquires bravely.</p><p>Hermione's sobbing stopped and she looked up at him.</p><p>"Why are you being nice to me?"</p><p>"Oh, so I can't be nice to a pretty girl?" He throw back at her.</p><p>"Ron doesn't seem to think so." She mumbles into his chest, almost making his chest vibrate.</p><p>"So you're upset the Weasel didn't ask you?" So that's what the argument was about. She looked up, no longer looking sad but angry.</p><p>"Do you know how he asked me? As a last resort by the way. He said 'Hermione, you're a girl'. He has the emotional range of a teaspoon!" She growls out.</p><p>"Hey...? Draco interrupts her ranting, gently grabbing and caressing her cheek with his thumb, wiping away stray tears.</p><p>"You shouldn't be anyones last resort." He whispered. Draco could hear their shaky and uneven breaths.</p><p>"Dance with me." He whispers, her breath hitches before she nods her head in acknowledgment.</p><p>Draco stood up and pulled Hermione up gently where they both walked towards the middle of the courtyard where charms were cast to prevent any more falling snow and cold from seeping through. With the music still playing in the background it was like nothing else existed, it was just the two of them.</p><p>"I'm sorry." He whispered out of nowhere, but she felt the sincerity from the simple apology.</p><p>"I'm sorry for the World Cup, for last year and every year since I've met you. I am so goddamn sorry." He whispered, tucking a stray hair behind her ear. Hermione couldn't hold back her smile that reached her ears. never in her entire life did she expect Draco Malfoy, poster boy for Pureblood Supremacy would apologise to her.</p><p>"Why are you smiling? I've been a twat to you for four years and now you're smiling. Did I say something?" he asked, still swaying with Hermione to the music that was playing in the Great hall.</p><p>"It's what you said. I just never expected that you of all people to say that. Thank you." She said looking into his grey stormy eyes and cupping his face in her hands. She had no idea where that move came from and Draco was just as shocked as Hermione. As if waiting for permission Draco slowly leaned in and captured his already cold lips on Hermione's.</p><p>Her mind was spinning as he kissed her. Never in a billion years did she think Draco Malfoy would be kissing her, nor she him. Merlin was it amazing but before she knew it he pulled away.</p><p>"Draco... What... Was... That?" She asked breathlessly, as she spoke puffs of air could be seen, then he notice her golden brown eyes and her no pink cheeks.</p><p>She was so bloody beautiful.</p><p>But before he could answer he kissed her again both of them getting caught up in the kiss. Their bodies moulded together as if there was still space between them they wanted to get rid of. He bit her lip and as she let out a gentle moan he slipped his tongue in like the snake he was. Neither of them let go, holding on as if they were each other's lifelines. Hermione combed her fingers through his hair and starting gently rolling the strands of hair at the back through her fingers, this time leaving him to moan in pleasure. He deepened the kiss. Both of their hands got lost in each others hair, neither of their lips parting- not even when the music stopped and the students cleared out.</p><p>All they noticed were each other.</p>
