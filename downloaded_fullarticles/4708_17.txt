    <p>Curses slammed into the wall they had ducked behind. Hermione risked a glance of the attackers, before throwing a weak, poorly-aimed hex, which the target deflected lazily with the flick of their wand. She raised her head again, counting eight death eaters, before two hexes, amber and emerald, were fired at her. She doubted the green curse was aimed at her; it punched a hole into the pillar to her right, almost harmless. The orange hex skimmed her arm, causing an intense but brief burning sensation; it would have been deadly, if it had found it's mark. She quickly ducked down.</p><p>"There's too many, we can't hold them off." Hermione shouted over the frantic yells of people dueling close to their improvised shelter. She could hear a deafening scream turn into a bloodcurdling shriek, and flinched.</p><p>"We have to <em>try</em>." Ron replied, grimacing. Hermione nodded in serious agreement.</p><p>"The snake <em>needs</em> to be killed, otherwise Harry won't have a chance." Hermione reminded darkly, wand clutched to her chest.</p><p>They had recently discovered that Voldemort's snake, Nagini, was a Horcrux. Ron sighed, scrubbing his face with the back of his hand, obviously dreading the task ahead.</p><p>"Quickly, let's go." Ron sharply gestured towards the staircase to the left. They sprinted towards the familiar staircase, spells whipping past them. She angled her head to face towards the opposition, and readied her wand.</p><p><em>"Alarte Ascendare</em>!" Hermione shouted, sending a Death Eater flying. She paused for a few seconds in surprise in her unexpected success, wand arm extended, before Ron grabbed her by the other arm and headed to the descending steps. She raced down the stone staircase, stumbling upon the rubble.</p><p>"Over here!" Ron roared, speeding towards the corner of a corridor below. Out of the corner of her eyes, she could see the figure of a snake, heading directly towards Ron.</p><p><em>"Ron, look out!"</em> She screamed, before hurling a powerful curse at the reptile. It advanced towards Ron menacingly. He joined in with the casting, sending flashes of blue and purple. The serpent continued its path, the multitude of spells sliding off its scales.</p><p>It leapt up, sinking venomous teeth directly into Ron's outstretched arm.</p><p>"<em>Ron</em>!" Hermione sped towards him, not caring of the potential danger. The snake continued viciously attacking him, despite the fact that Ron had already lost.</p><p>She saw him struck down to the floor, bleeding out. She saw eyes glaze over, unseeing. His wand slipped out of his limp hand, rolling away on the floor with a soft clatter.</p><p>The snake slithered towards her, intent obvious. Her eyes widened as reality slowly found its way back to her. She backed away.</p><p>"<em>Bombarda!" </em>The large piece of rubble besides the serpent exploded. Hermione continued backing up, stumbling slightly.</p><p>"<em>Confringo</em>!" There was no effect. She tripped. The snake sped up, hissing at her. She cast the disarming spell, which did nothing. Panic filled her. She tried a stunning spell with the same effect. Hermione fell to the floor, wand falling out of her hand and to the left. Desperately, she lunged for it. She turned to throw another hex, only to find Neville decapitating the monster. In his hands lay the sword of Griffindor. There was a pause, filled with shocked stares and heavy breathing.</p><p>"<em>Ron</em>."</p><p> </p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">

</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left"> </p><p>Hermione was still knelt besides Harry's cold body. His eyes were firmly shut, wand loosely handling in his half-closed hand, his other hand open. His glasses had lay askew. Hermione replaced them to where it was meant to be, giving the illusion that he was merely sleeping. The wand was not his; the wood was much darker, and the slender figure was too long to be his. She recalled Dumbledore using that wand. Vaguely confused and desperate for a distraction, she continued to dwell on that thought. Hadn't Harry said, during their brief and disastrous stay at the Lovegood residence, that Voldemort was after<em> that</em> wand? He had also said that it was not just to cause the death of his powerful enemy, which meant that it must be important or very powerful. Or-</p><p>
  <em>The Elder Wand.</em>
</p><p>Dark realisation was the first emotion Hermione felt. Harry <em>did</em> mention these to her, and at the time she had given vague agreements, not truly believing what he had said. Then there was the Tale of The Beetle and The Bard, a book left in her possession after the death of Dumbledore. How could she of been so <em>stupid?</em></p><p>Her shaking hands still clutched Harry's invisibility cloak, which was found discarded besides his body. Belletrix Lestrange had become enraged after seeing her Lord hit by his own killing curse. Wild, she had cast eighteen <em>Avada Kedavra's </em>in random directions. She even hit three of her fellow Death Eaters, who were all fleeing at their sudden loss. She had hit Harry, who was the first person to go. He wasn't expecting death, yet after fighting for so long, losing so much- they had won. Victory shouldn't feel this way. McGonagall's curse<em>, Incendio, </em>had caused the evil witch to be engulfed in ravenous flames. A quick death that she did not deserve.</p><p>The invisibility cloak. The Elder Wand. Hermione closed her eyes, releasing a shaky exhale. In Harry's open palm lay a small, black stone. It was too perfectly square to be natural. She grimaced, then picked up the small stone. Slight warmth seemed to emit from it, confirming her suspicions. The Resurrection Stone.</p><p>All three Deathly Hallows.</p><p>They had caused misery, destruction and distress. Nothing good had ever come of them, no happiness nor peace. Even the stone, which was supposed to give life, had caused death. A sudden rage filled her. <em>If </em>Dumbledore didn't have the wand, if it did not exist, Voldemort wouldn't of caused as much damage trying to look for it. Snape would be alive- many would be alive, having not fallen prey to Voldemort's search for power.</p><p>If it was made in Earth, it could easily be destroyed in Earth.</p><p>Hands slightly trembling, Hermione reached out, intending on snapping it in half. There was brief moment of recognition that she held all three Hallows. Then she took it in both hands.</p><p>Before any damage could be done, the wand rapidly heated up, alongsides the stone and the cloak. It was a scorching heat, burning fiercely against her skin, yet something was holding her down, making her unable to move away. Her head began to throb painfully. All muscles in her body seemed to clench at once, putting her in agony. A wind seemed to come out of nowhere, pushing her backwards. Her back was falling, head slamming into the ground. Unconsciousness took her in a vice-like hold.</p><p>Time shattered around her.</p>
