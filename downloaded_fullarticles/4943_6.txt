    <p>Minerva walked quickly to the gate at the edge of the school grounds – she knew the girl would be arriving any minute and did not want to risk having her waiting outside the grounds in the event that the girl was early. Minerva had a feeling the girl would be there at any moment, although the girl was not expected to appear until fifteen after two. It was only one forty-five at the moment, but Minerva kept her fervent pace nonetheless. The professor’s intuition had been right, as the girl appeared merely minutes after Minerva McGonagall reached the gate. <br/>Although having met the girl only once before, Minerva knew it was her who approached. She was immediately recognizable from her walk- it was one of confidence and poise without arrogance, the same walk the girl had Minerva had first met her, several years ago. ‘I guess I should stop referring to her as a girl now’ Minerva thought in her head. Alas, the one who walked towards the gate had the air of womanhood about her. The girl – woman – smiled as she approached the gate. Her dirty blond hair was placed in a messy bun on the top of her head and she wore plain black robes over black slacks and a black and white striped blouse that swayed in the wind. Minerva noticed movement over the girl’s shoulder and saw a suitcase meandering along the path a few paces behind the woman, and smiled at the girl’s, no woman’s, stubbornness. <br/>“Hello, again, professor McGonagall”, the woman’s voice was calm and without any of the girlish foolishness that other students her age held. The woman was only seventeen, but held such a countenance as that of someone in their thirties. “Good afternoon, Ms. Lewis. Punctual as always I see.” Jane Lewis allowed the small smile to grow slightly on her face. She couldn’t help but to be early to things. No matter how hard she planned, she always ended up being early. She honestly couldn’t help it. “My apologies, Professor” Jane said. “No need for apologies, Ms. Lewis, there is no crime in being early. That, at least, is a much better habit than being late” McGonagall answered back. “Now,” McGonagall continued “I’m sure that Professor Dumbledore is waiting for us. I see you didn’t send your trunk along before you, we can drop it off with Mr. Filch on the way”. Jane again flashed her winning smirk. “You think of me as stubborn, Professor, for not sending my trunk ahead…” McGonagall’s eyes grew at the fact that this young girl could read into her so easily. Jane continued “…I see it not so much as stubbornness, but as more of a distrust for society as a whole.” And with that, the two entered the gait, and were on their way to the castle. <br/>---</p>
<p>Minerva left Jane at the entrance to Dumbledore’s office. She had some other business to attend to, and had no doubt that the woman would be able to handle her own. The walk to the castle had been uneventful after their first exchange, merely pleasantries that were more akin to be found between colleagues than professor and student. My, the girl had grown up so much. Minerva always knew that the girl would be special, everyone did, but the drastic changes that had overcome the now young woman over just two years had astounded Professor McGonagall. <br/>Two years ago, Dumbledore had privately asked Minerva to take a trip to the United States to meet a young girl that a close confidant of Dumbledore’s had taken special interest in at the Mateo school of wizardry. At the age of 15 this girl was already in the next to final year at Mateo, surpassing all of the years before her with ease and surprising wit. Dumbledore’s confidant, D’Marcus Farling, was almost frightened by the ease with which the young witch learned her craft, and knew that the young girl would be far more powerful than any witch or wizard her age. She might even grow up to rival the most powerful wizards of the era. And that’s why Dumbledore had sent Minerva – to invite the witch to attend her seventeenth year at Hogwarts while waiting to attend University, who took no witches or wizards under 18, no matter how exceptional they were. Minerva was told by Dumbledore that it would be a good way to expand this young powerful witch’s horizon while waiting for higher education to accept her, but Minerva had a slight suspicion that Dumbledore held other motives as well. <br/>Minerva reminisced of her first encounter of Jane Lewis while attending to her other duties. She remembered how the girl had held her gaze with such confidence upon meeting her. Such confidence in the young witch was already odd because of her age – almost all fifteen-year-old witches held self-esteem issues. But, this confidence was also special because it held no air of arrogance or boast of power. This was the feat of someone way beyond the girl’s time, and it has astonished Minerva. Professor McGonagall relayed Dumbledore’s message to the young girl, who readily accepted the invitation. The girl was no dummy, and knew what an honor it was to be personally asked to attend a foreign institution like Hogwarts after already graduating from a magic school, which she would undoubtedly accomplish in a short time. The girl had no one to consult on the matter of whether she could go or not, as she held full autonomy over herself. She had no parents – she had been abandoned shortly after her second year of life. She had been in foster care until her tenth birthday, when she had been whisked away into Mateo school of wizardry, under the close tutelage of D’Marcus Farling, who saw her potential from the moment the girl first stepped onto the school grounds. Farling had stood as her guardian until the age of fourteen, when the girl had shown more than enough intelligence to decide things for herself, and then on only stood as a guardian on paper. However, Jane respected the man far more than anyone else she had ever met, and saw him as a parent of sorts. She secretly had the intuition that Farling had been speaking to Dumbledore for quite some time about her, and this was one of the driving factors to her accepting Dumbledore’s invitation. She also knew that Dumbledore did not come to see her for himself, and this irked her a bit. However, she enjoyed meeting Professor McGonagall and saw why Dumbledore held her in such high esteem. When Jane Lewis held Minerva McGonagall’s gaze for the first time, she could feel that Minerva was extremely powerful as well. <br/>---</p>
<p>	Jane stood outside of Professor Dumbledore’s office. She knew she didn’t have to knock, and that the door would open when Dumbledore wished for her to enter. Even she didn’t know how she knew these sorts of things, but she knew and she listened to this knowledge. Suddenly, the door opened, and she entered the large office. Dumbledore had been sitting behind his large writing desk, but started to rise as Jane Lewis entered the chamber. “Ah! Miss Lewis! It is such a pleasure to finally make your acquaintance! I do hope your journey was enjoyable” Dumbledore greeted. <br/>“Hello, Professor Dumbledore. It is wonderful to finally meet you as well” Jane smiled her winning smile once again. “Indeed my trip was as enjoyable as trips alone can be. I visited quite a few monuments on my way in. And the weather here is gorgeous. Thank you again for the invitation to join your school while I wait to become of age for University”. <br/>“And thank you for accepting, Miss Lewis. Now, if you don’t mind, lets take care of a few things.”<br/>“Ah! Do you mean to tell me you wished to see me upon my arrival to your prestigious school for reasons other than to welcome me?!” her question was posed for fun, not malice. <br/>“But of course, Miss Lewis, I have always wished to meet you, but it seems that we have some duties to attend to related to your entrance to Hogwarts, and these should be dealt with firsthand by us both before you start to attend class”<br/>“and what might that be, Professor?” Jane was genuinely intrigued by the old wizard’s directness, and enjoyed it thoroughly. <br/>“Well, there’s the sorting, of course! To see what house you shall live in while here at Hogwarts!” The old wizard smiled so wide, that Jane cracked a bit of a grin herself. <br/>“By all means, sort away” she quipped back to Dumbledore, and chuckled a bit. <br/>They had gotten off to a good start, the young witch and the old wizard. Dumbledore had been somewhat nervous to meet the young witch, hearing all about her power from D’Marcus Farling. He was afraid she would be just like the powerful young boy he had met all those years ago, named Tom Riddle. But, as things had gone so far, some of his fear was quelled as he reached up to grab the sorting hat from the top shelf. Dumbledore motioned for Jane to sit down in an armchair across from the large desk, and she did so with her natural confidence. When Dumbledore placed the hat on top of her head, she seemed intrigued, but not frightened like the younger kids usually were. Perhaps that was due to her being seventeen. However, Dumbledore had suspicions that this was not the case. <br/>Jane could feel the strange hat searching her mind, and she welcomed it in by unlocking the doors to the depths of her mind that she usually kept securely bound. She could feel the hat’s gratitude for not having to fight its way through the locks of her mind, and she silently allowed the hat to roam in her thoughts for a bit. Then, surprisingly, the hat spoke to her in her mind. <br/>“I see that you are a very complex creature, Miss Lewis”<br/>“I appreciate that --, urgh, hat? Forgive me, I do not know your name” <br/>“My name is of no consequence, Miss Lewis. ‘Hat’ should do”<br/>“Okay then, Hat, I appreciate your acknowledgement of my complexity, and I give the same to you”<br/>“hahaha! and wit as well! I do so enjoy your mind. Thank you for not forcing me to unlock all of your secret depths and thoughts. It does get tiring after a while”<br/>“well you are quite welcome, Hat, as it might have been impossible for you to enter into some of those depths at all with the locks that were on it!”<br/>“Surprisingly, I agree with you Miss Lewis, and as such this adds to your complexity. As well as the fact that you are not arrogant about your power”<br/>“Please, Hat, call me Jane, as how can we have such formalities with you inside my innermost workings?!”<br/>The hat chuckled again, and continue his quest. Dumbledore was sitting in the chair next to Jane’s as this whole endeavor was going on, quietly watching with eager anticipation of the results. It felt like they had been sitting this way for ages, and indeed it had been a good twenty minutes. The Hat was still there, searching the workings of Jane Lewis’s mind. <br/>“Hat?”<br/>“Hmmm?”<br/>“if you don’t mind me asking, is there anything I can help you sort out? I feel that Headmaster Dumbledore is getting anxious waiting”<br/>“haha! Now the sorted is helping the sorter. How ironic. But yes, Jane, I feel that you know your own mind well enough to help me with my dilemma. As you know, there are four houses in Hogwarts. I have narrowed you down to two. You are not at all a Hufflepuff, for you are too powerful and honest to always be loyal. And you are not at all a Gryffindor, for you don’t have many reasons to be brave, as you don’t have to fear much. So that leaves me with Ravenclaw and Slytherin. You would be wonderful in Ravenclaw, because you are extremely intelligent and learn very quickly. But, you would also be amazing in Slytherin, because you are cunning, sarcastic, and a bit ruthless. So, I’m not sure how to proceed. Any suggestions?”<br/>Jane Lewis thought for a moment, and then spoke in her mind “…In which one would I learn more? Not just academically, but in life?” <br/>The hat paused for a moment. “…Slytherin it is”. <br/>---</p>
<p>Jane had received her own room in the Slytherin house, as Dumbledore feared her being irked by the less mature students. Farling had told him of her temper, and Dumbledore still had a bit of fear regarding this powerful young witch. Her trunk was in her room, delivered without a scratch by Mr. Filch. This made Jane smile, as she explored her new room. There were two dressers in the room, one empty, presumably meant for Jane’s own clothes, and one filled with all the parts of a Hogwarts uniform, emblazoned by the Slytherin green. Jane was enthralled that the Hat had allowed her to be a part of her choice of house, and couldn’t wait to meet her fellow Slytherins. After all, even at Mateo she had heard that many powerful witches and wizards came from the Slytherin house of Hogwarts. Along with the two dressers stood a large desk, a bookshelf, and a huge king sized bed. Jane unpacked her things magically with a wave of her hand, placing her clothes in the dresser, her schoolbooks and personal volumes upon the bookshelf, and her picture of D’Marcus Farling on her desk. She was satisfied with her work. Although she missed Farling already, she could definitely see herself living here for a year. It was a gorgeous room, after all. She looked at the clock and noticed that is was already half past six. She had spent a good time conversing with Dumbledore after they had finished the intricacies of allowing her to start at Hogwarts. She realized she was hungry, and decided to make her way to the common room to try to find someone to take her to get some dinner. <br/>As she entered the common room, many heads turned to stare at the new seventeen-year-old they had never seen before. Murmurs started to move throughout the room. Jane was used to this, as they used to murmur about her at Mateo as well. She met eyes with a few of the students, but each looked away as soon as they met her gaze. However, when her eyes met the gaze of a blonde boy with a smirk on his face, he held her stare. Jane walked over to the boy, and greeted him with a smile. <br/>“I’ve never seen you before. I would know if I had” stated the blonde boy.<br/>“Yes, I’m new. My name is Jane Lewis. It’s nice to meet you.” <br/>The boy’s smirk grew a bit wider. “My name is Draco Malfoy. It is a pleasure to meet you, Jane.”<br/>“And to you as well” Jane stated back, holding the boy’s gaze still. <br/>“We were just about to go to the great hall for supper” Draco motioned to two lumbering boys and a tall thin boy behind him. “would you care to join us?” <br/>Jane smiled once more “I’d love to. I’m famished” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>When they reached the great hall, they entered as a group, Draco leading the pack, with Jane by his side, and the three other boys left trailing behind them. As Draco moved to sit at the table furthest to the left, the tall lanky boy slipped past Jane and attempted to sit next to Draco. Draco gave him an icy stare and stated “now Blaze, why don’t you move over a bit and let Jane sit by me”. Blaze merely nodded and slid over so that Jane could sit between the two. She thanked Blaze with a small smile and sat on the bench. The two lumbering boys sat across from Draco on the other side of the table. Jane could feel many pairs of eyes on her at the moment. It was not often that students transferred to Hogwarts after the first year or two. However, Jane could feel one particularly extremely powerful gaze coming from her right side. She looked past Draco for a second, searching for the eyes that she felt. She quickly scanned all the students at the Slytherin table and figured that none of them were the culprit. She continued to raise her eyes, and met the powerful gaze she felt, in the form of a lanky older man dressed in all black with raven black hair sitting at the head table. She held his gaze for several moments before breaking it to reply to Draco’s questions. She would have to remember to find out who this powerful wizard was.<br/>“So, where did you transfer from, Jane?” Draco asked, seeming to be extremely interested in what she had to say. He didn’t stop looking at her the whole time he spoke to her, not even to reach for a plate. <br/>“from the United States. Washington, to be exact. I was a student at Mateo school of wizardry there” <br/>“and what made you transfer?”<br/>“I actually finished my studies there at the end of last term, and graduated. But University doesn’t take students under eighteen, so Dumbledore invited me to come to come to Hogwarts for my interim year to continue my studies” <br/>“Wow. It’s quite impressive that you already graduated before the age of eighteen. You must be very smart. Or very cunning”<br/>“or both” Jane smirked a smile similar to Draco’s, and this made Draco chuckle. <br/>“You are very beautiful” The other boys of the group grew wide eyed at his boldness, but quickly gained their composure. Draco was a very forward man, and Jane liked that in a person. <br/>“Well thank you. You aren’t horrible to look at yourself” Jane said this with a straight face, and this made Draco burst out in laughing. Draco was extremely handsome, but Jane did not want to add to the slight arrogance she sensed in the boy. <br/>	Jane was not a typical beauty. She was a little taller than average, but not Amazonian. She stood at about 173 centimeters. She had dirty blonde hair that was still in a bun from her journey this morning. When not pinned up, her hair was extremely curly and went to about the middle of her back. She was not skinny by any means. She was curvaceous, with a few extra pounds around her hips and thighs. Her eyes were a light grey that could be mistaken for blue or green in certain lights. Her skin was decently pale with some olive tones in it. Her hair and skin together make it so that one could tell that her heritage was not completely Anglo-Saxon. She wasn’t ugly by any means. In fact, she was very pretty. But it was probably her confidence that made others see her as extremely beautiful, like Draco did now. After a few more minutes of discussion, the pair turned to the table to eat their supper, but still maintained pleasant conversation throughout the rest of the meal. Jane learned that the two lumbering boys were named Crabbe and Goyle, and this made Jane laugh a bit because their names were fitting to their large imposing statures. As she heard earlier, the lanky boy with the olive skin was named Blaze. He had joined in on the two’s conversation after a few minutes, but the two lumbering boys sat quietly while scarfing down their food.</p>
