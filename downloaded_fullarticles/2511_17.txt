  <span>The first time I saw him I thought he was beautiful.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The first time I spoke to him showed me he wasn’t.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The first time I saw him after the war took my breath away.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>His hair was bold and rich, yet no longer blond. It was as dark as an opal and as brilliant as the sun. I approached him with no plan on my mind and stopped in front of him in the middle of Muggle London. I let my eyes wander and noticed he had been buying groceries.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He turned towards me and a second later had a dumbstruck expression on his face. He composed himself in a flash and said, “Potter.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>It wasn’t a question or a statement; just an observation. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Malfoy.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>A pause. And then–</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Thank you for speaking on my behalf–”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I still have your wand–”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Silence fell; there was so much we had to say, so much to clear up. But those conversations were not made for Muggle London.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He looked down as he cleared his throat and said, “Would you like to join me for a cup of tea at the Manor?”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>I didn’t even have to think about it. “Yes.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>That was the first time we properly talked about all the hardships we had both faced during our lives.</span>
