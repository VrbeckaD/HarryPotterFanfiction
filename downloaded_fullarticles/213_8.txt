    <p>/N I watched this show when I was younger. It intrigued me then and still intruiges me now. I hope you like this xover.</p><p>Harrison's POV<br/>
Dreamscape</p><p>A dark forest surrounded him. It had a similar feel to that of the forbidden forest. At the same time it was different. There wasn't any sense of danger. Instead it was more of a peaceful feeling.</p><p>The feeling didn't last however. Around him he could hear a creature closing in. When he tried to grab at his wand he found it was gone. A howl startled him and he began to run. If this was a werewolf he was in trouble.</p><p>As he ran through the forest it seemed never ending. He didn't even know where he was going. Just that he had to get away.</p><p>His breaths were coming in short pants as another howl resounded behind him. It was much closer this time. He picked up the pace for once thankful to Dudley. If the fat cousin of his hadn't chased him when they were younger he would have already been caught by now.</p><p>As he jumped down from a rock ledge something caught his leg. There wasn't any pain with it but he couldn't move. When he tried to move his leg he fell to the forested ground with a thud. Again there wasn't any pain and when he glanced back he realized that it wasn't real. He was in a dream with his leg caught in a bear trap.</p><p>A snarl came from above him causing him to look up. A pure black wolf stood above him. It green eyes stared down at him. There was faint amusement in them. Almost as if it was asking why he was down there.</p><p>Then it threw its head back and howled. The howl resounded through his heart and soul.</p><p>End of dreamscape</p><p>Harrison woke up with a gaps. The howl still rang within his mind and soul.</p><p>What was that? He never heard of wizards having such dreams. He knew some had dreams when they were about to come into a creature inheritance. The Potter's didn't have a creature blood line. On top of that the Evans were muggles. So he couldn't be a creature. Could he?</p><p>Shaking his head from the thoughts of the strange dream he got up. It was still dark out but dawn would soon be approaching. He grabbed some parchment from under his bed and a pen. He needed to work on his Care for Magical Creatures essay.</p><p>At the end of his fourth year Hagrid assigned everyone a creature. Some were easier than others. His was a supposedly extinct creature. They were known as Skinwalkers.</p><p>According to the History of Magic books Skinwalkers were what inspired animagi. They had the ability to change their form into a chosen animal.</p><p>Stories of sitings of such creatures centered around impossible places. There most common names were Wolf Lake. There was even one in England not far from Surrey.</p><p>The last reported Skinwalker was back in the early tenth century. It wasn't even in England but in France. There has not been a report of one since then.</p><p>It made him wonder. Where they hiding? If they could take the form of both animal and human it wouldn't be that difficult. They could hide amongst the muggles. Then wizards would never find them.</p><p>Unconsciously his thoughts went back to his dream. It was the first dream that wasn't a nightmare from the Third Task. It was the first restful night's sleep he had in a month. That wolf had looked too much like him for comfort. What did it mean?</p><p>Matthew's POV</p><p>An unfamiliar pull was coming from his navel. The entire clan felt when one of their was going through the change. Having watched all the kids grow up he knew each of them. This pull didn't belong to any kid of age or otherwise. Yet magic claimed whoever it was as one of theirs.</p><p>As if sensing his thoughts his phone pinged with a mesage. It was from Sherman Blackstone. Their healer and historian. If anyone knew what was going on it was him.</p><p>A full clan meeting was being called. That wasn't something that happened very often. Usually it only happened when they were choosing a new clan head.</p><p>After dropping his daughter Sophie off at school he made his way to the lodge. It was early but already half the clan had arrived. Willard Cates the current head of the clan was speaking quietly with his wife Vivian. Their eyes locked and Willard shook his head. It seemed not even the head knew what was going on.</p><p>It took over an hour for the rest of the clan to assemble. The regular humans had no idea of what was going on. The peace that had been kept by humans and Skinwalkers was a thin line. Over the years it had only gotten thinner.</p><p>The only real saving grace was that wizards thought they were extinct. They had stopped looking for them centuries ago. Most of their children were unable to do most magic. Their magic centered around the moon and their wolf form. The few that could do magic at all were taught by Sherman Blackstone.</p><p>He helped them prepare to take the Wizarding tests. Those were few and far between however. Never enough for a full class. There was only two students in the last decade. His daughter Sophie and Tyler. That boy was going to be trouble. He knew it.</p><p>The doors opened a final time allowing a greying black haired man in. His onyx eyes searched the room taking everyone in. It was their historian himself. With his presence the entire clan shifted becoming slightly calmer. Everyone knew that if anyone could tell them what was going on it was this man.</p><p>Sherman said in an uncharacteristic stern tone, "Take your seats everyone. This is going to take some time to explain."</p><p>Everyone moved to obey. Sherman might not be the head of the clan but he was well respected. They had all grown up with him in the community. No one knew how old the man truly was. Just that he was always around.</p><p>Once they were all settled Sherman said looking far older than he had in years, "Our older members will remember this. Some of you pups will not. Who remembers Riley Donner?"</p><p>His older brother? Matthew knew that he had an older brother. His parents never wanted to talk about him though. Riley was thirteen years older than himself.</p><p>Everyone in the clan knew of him. He was the only one of clan blood that didn't change. Sophie who had both human and wolf in her may or may not change. That was normal for them. However to be a full blooded and not have the change that wasn't normal.</p><p>Riley had practically been an outcast after his sixteenth birthday. Just before his seventeenth birthday he disappeared. No one saw or heard from him again. Matthew had only been four at the time.</p><p>According to the clan hunters someone helped him disappear. Whoever had done it knew what they were doing. Without the connection to the clan it was impossible to find him.</p><p>He disappeared forty years ago. What did that have to do with now? It was far too late for it to be Riley coming into his inheritance. Any child of his wouldn't make the change either.</p><p>Sherman continued, "I helped Riley when he decided to leave. It was his right since he could never be considered one of us. He was given a new life and papers that would allow him to live his life. We kept in contact over the years. Eventually he married and had a daughter. Her name was Lily and she had magic. Like her father before her she didn't show any signs of the change."</p>
