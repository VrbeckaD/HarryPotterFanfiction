<p>Into the Trees</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Harry looked around, frowning. “I’ve never seen this part of the Manor before.” </p>
<p>“I Flooed us to the family entrance,” said Draco. “Seemed appropriate.” </p>
<p>“Wait, are you saying I count as family?” </p>
<p>Draco’s fingers tightened on Harry’s hand. “You do in my eyes.” </p>
<p>Smiling, Harry leaned in. “Your eyes are the only ones that matter.” </p>
<p>“Master Draco!” </p>
<p>Harry and Draco both winced, turning to look at the door where there was an elf. “Mistress said you might be coming.” </p>
<p>“We’re just here to check on Kreacher,” said Draco, tone gruff. </p>
<p>The elf bowed. “Please to follow Binky to the trees.” </p>
<p>~</p>
<p>“The trees?” Harry hissed as they followed the elf. “What’s he talking about?”</p>
<p>“I think he means Mother’s solarium,” Draco replied. “It’s a lovely room, gets a lot of sun. When you’re there, you feel like you’re amongst trees.” He frowned. “I’m surprised she put Kreacher there, though.” </p>
<p>The elf stopped in front of double doors which swung open to reveal a large solarium with glass walls and roof. Inside was Narcissa, who rose when she saw them. “You came!” </p>
<p>“Just to check on Kreacher, Mother.” </p>
<p>Narcissa inclined her head. “Of course. Still, I do think you’ll enjoy my surprise.” </p>
