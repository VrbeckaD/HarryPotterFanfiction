</p><p>Kathryn stares and stares and stares some more, her empty rosary in her hand. She had thought that Sebastian had died. Apparently not, because Sebastian is right in front of her with Miss Seventeen magazine hanging off his arm and looking right into her eyes, his inviting lips upturned in a smirk. He looks as good as new, no sign of any accident whatsoever and suddenly Kathryn realizes that she is so very very relieved.</p><p>In fact, she is so relieved that she forgets all about the way his journal has exposed her today. He has humiliated her in front of the entire school and when he smiles at her, his familiar and sinister smile, she realizes that this is his revenge, that it was his idea to circulate the bloody journal like this. He is standing at a distance of ten feet from her with Annette who is looking piteously at Kathryn. The freak. She had asked Kathryn to find her if she needs to talk. As if Kathryn would ever succumb to such measures. She doesn't want anyone, least of all Annette Hargrove.</p><p>His blue eyes bore into hers and she can see everything clearly now. He had not died. He had orchestrated his own death to expose her, to reduce her reputation to tatters.</p><p>"Mr. Valmont. You are- um I mean, we all thought that we had lost you. It's such a pleasant surprise." Headmaster Hargrove murmurs and walks towards Sebastian. Kathryn stays frozen on spot, knowing that she would be dismissed from school now. Her life is as good as over.</p><p>Sebastian's eyes flick towards her and then back at the headmaster, "Annette saved me. She took me quickly to the nearest healer and here I am." Others might think that Sebastian is sweet and polite and paradigm of innocence but Kathryn knows otherwise. Sebastian has circulated everything about her and the bet. He has not mentioned his conquests in that journal. There is no mention of the fact that he had published his therapist's daughter nude pictures. She can see right through him. She always has and she knows when he is trying to win someone's heart.</p><p>Everyone is gathered around them and Sebastian grabs the opportunity to murmur, "Headmaster Hargrove. I have a humble request to make from you. My step sister Kathryn is just misguided and if you dismiss her from the school, I will lose her completely. I would rather give her an opportunity to regret and apologise for her sins so that she has a chance to have a bright future. I beg of you, Headmaster, please consider my request."</p><p>Headmaster turns to look at her and Kathryn schools her features. She knows what Sebastian is trying to do. He is not leaving her with any other option. She will have to apologize in front of the entire school, no less. Bloody bastard.</p><p>Slowly, the headmaster walks towards her and speaks gravely, "You should be thankful to your brother."</p><p>"I am. I am." she replies, her face regretful.</p><p>XXXX</p><p>Sebastian should be amazed by the way she is putting an act on for everyone but he isn't. She is a lying bitch and he has always known that but he had never imagined that she would sink so low, that her scheming will lead to his death.</p><p>"-ian. Sebastian." Sebastian blinks and looks at Annette's warm and knowing eyes.</p><p>"Yes." He replies softly and she murmurs, "You should reconcile with her. This sort of devotion is impossible to get over."</p><p>Sebastian rolls his eyes exasperatedly. She has been on and on about devotion and love and all that trash that he supposedly has for Kathryn. Why she thinks that he feels anything except hatred for the bitch is really beyond him.</p><p>"Look." He starts and fixes his eyes on Kathryn who is talking to the headmaster, her eyes masked. He can see the fury in their depths and it drives a thrill of satisfaction inside him.</p><p>"Sebbbaastian." Annette's drawl catches his attention and he looks at her before continuing, "If you want to call it quits, then just do that. I am fed up of this hot and cold and hot and cold attitude of yours. Don't put it on me. For the millionth time, I am not devoted to her. Au contraire, I despise her. Absolutely and utterly."</p><p>"What you did today was wrong. You must have forgiven her. You-" She starts and he rolls his eyes again.</p><p>"I can't forgive her. I wanted revenge. She manipulated me. She insulted me and she reject-" He stops and Annette sighs again before opening her mouth.</p><p>"Don't start again. Don't. I will leave you standing alone over here. See, the show is beginning. They are calling Caldwels as well. I want to witness her humiliation and compel her to look into my eyes all the while. Come on." He finishes and without waiting for her to speak, he starts to walk inside the school building.</p><p>XXXX</p><p>Kathryn fumes as she walks inside. It's downright humiliating and she doesn't want to do it. But she knows that there is nothing she can do to avoid it right now and so she walks inside like a good little girl.</p><p>Getting upon the dias, she looks at the student body sitting in front of her. Right in the front row, sits her dear brother Sebastian.</p><p>"I know that I have disappointed everyone. As the student body president, I was responsible to set an example for everyone. Unfortunately the pressure got to me and I started cocaine. Court broke up with me and -" She sobs and Court scowls at her.</p><p>"I just wanted to teach him a lesson. I am so sorry that I hurt so many people. I apologize to everyone who has been affected due to my madness. I hope you all will at least try to consider all I have done to help so many of you and forgive me. I would like to thank my dearest brother Sebastian for giving me another chance and I would like to say that I am really grateful that you are alive. "</p><p>She finishes and looks at him. The last line was not a lie. She hopes he knows that.</p><p>"That's all. Thank you everyone."</p><p>She gets down, her eyes full of fake tears and moves out of the hall.</p><p><em>Bastard</em>. She almost hisses at Sebastian on her way out and somehow manages to stop herself, rushing towards her car before she completely loses her temper and explodes at him.</p><p>XXXX</p><p>"You don't need to come, you know?" Harry whispers in Draco's neck. He is attending his final year in Manchester Prep. Snape has a strong lead that Riddle had created eight horcruxes including Harry and that the last horcrux is at Manchestor Prep and they don't even know who is it, only that it is a human horcrux like Harry himself was.</p><p>"Oh! And what am I supposed to here?" Draco snapped at him after pinching his arm.</p><p>"Always such a brute." Harry mumbles and tightens his arm around Draco. They have finally told her parents about their relationship and Lucius took it well, considering everything. He only asked Harry certain questions to ensure that he wasn't fooling around with his daughter. Narcissa had always supported him so she had never been a problem.</p><p>Draco spun around in his arms and wrapped her arms around Harry's neck, her silver eyes looking at him softly.</p><p>"You are never leaving me behind again. You are never going somewhere I can't follow you, no matter how many prophecies require you to destroy dark lords." She whispers and he places his hand on her arse before pressing their lips in a chaste kiss.</p><p>"So, did your acquaintance tell you anything about that school?" He asks, his lips upturned in a smile and she glares at him before punching his stomach lightly, "Don't tease me. I know you are not interested in other girls at all, not since we got together. But, as a matter of fact, yes she did."</p><p>He kisses her eyebrows softly and asks, "What did she tell you?"</p><p>"Well, there is this duo, Kathryn Merteuil and Sebastian Valmont. They are the one of most popular and hot students over there. According to her, they are step siblings but fuck each other though she doesn't have any proof of the same. She says that they struck some bet to take revenge from someone and they are always searching for challenges. She says that they are ruthless and completely practical and won't think twice before manipulating someone for their own benefits. Said that they manipulated her into losing her virginity. Not that it would have been much difficult, considering that she is the most naive and innocent idiot I have ever known. Kind of Like Ginny."</p><p>XXXX</p><p>"Be nice." Harry slaps her arse playfully and she mock-glares at him before pulling him into a passionate kiss.</p><p>"I love you." She whispers hesitantly and places her cheeks on his shoulders. She loves him but it's difficult for her to express it because she has always been introvert. She has never been able to express her love easily.</p><p>"I love... your arse." He says, smiling mischievously and slides a hand inside her panties.</p><p>"And." She asks impatiently. He presses his lips softly to hers and whispers, his eyes gleaming mischievously even as he kneads her arse.</p><p>"Your lips." He says and she glares at him.</p><p>"And you. I love you." He says finally and her lips upturn in a smile.</p><p>He is about to remove her panties when she pulls away from him and mutters, her lips upturned in a smirk now, "We have to leave tomorrow. Severus would have our head if we are late because you can't keep it in your pants."</p><p>He pulls her back in his arms, her back pressed to his chest and his hands on her bare belly as he whispers, "All right then, I won't fuck you but he won't stop me from cuddling with you. Good night."</p><p>"Good night." She says and burrows in his arms contently.</p><p>XXXX</p><p>Please review</p>
