    <p>Hogwarts seemed like an entirely improbable existence for Remus Lupin.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>A werewolf from five years old, homeschooled and protected so fiercely by his parents that he found the idea of being out of their cottage for more than a few hours laughable.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Hope always tried to make his life as normal as possible, but Remus wasn't stupid. Even at five years old, he wasn't stupid. He could tell his mother was so incredibly sorry that her son was now some horrible Dark Creature; not a part of her world, but barely even a part of her husband's world either. Lyall was a bastion of quiet strength, a former household name in eradicating the very things his son now turned into every month. But he didn't let his prejudices get in the way of his love for his only son. Because for the vast majority of the lunar cycle, Remus John Lupin was still a young boy.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>That didn't mean Lyall wasn't protective to a fault, though. Around the moon, Remus was barely allowed out of the house and, of course, as a child, that made making friends almost impossible. How could he keep up with the normal talk of toys and football and who started a fight with whom in the local playground last week when he disappeared for a week and came back with another mangled set of scars on his scrawny body? It was laughable to think of anything outside of the cottage.</p><p>He would've almost been lonely, if it wasn't for the endless amount of literature he consumed. As soon as Remus was able to read, he did so with voracity. He was desperate for other worlds besides the one where he was a monster, and he lived through those damn books. Remus was mildly obsessed with both <em>Le Fantôme de l'Opéra </em>by Gaston Leroux - albeit the English translation - and <em>Frankenstein </em>by Mary Shelley. He couldn't put either of them down, rereading them almost feverishly and wondering if he might ever become the title of a novel about the hideous nature of man and all of its problems. He knew there were plenty of books about Dark Creatures. He had read them in his father's study when he crept in there late at night; but there was something terrifying about the prose of both of the novels that struck him to his core.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Remus read many other books as well, where none of the characters were disfigured, and there were gangs of friends off on merry adventures and happy endings and, very occasionally, love. He would rather live in those books than the other two, but they always drew him back.</p><p>So when the Hogwarts letter arrived, piercing through his mediocre existence of scars, pain and pretend worlds, Remus naturally assumed he was dreaming, or perhaps he had slipped getting out of the bath after a painful moon and was in some kind of wonderful coma. He didn't know Dumbledore had arrived at their cottage at the beginning of summer for stern discussions with Lyall. He didn't know Hope had spent weeks convincing Lyall to let him go to Hogwarts, desperate to give her baby boy a chance to fit in <em>somewhere</em>.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Remus just assumed it had been a mistake or a tear in his reality; an alternate universe, some cosmic joke that would right itself forthwith. If Remus was even slightly self-aware, he would've ridiculed himself for being an 11-year-old with a vocabulary that included <em>forthwith</em>, but yet, his vocabulary also included words like <em>Christ alive,</em> and <em>shit</em> and <em>fuck</em>.</p><p>The reality never came, though, and Hogwarts appeared on the horizon in late August 1971 after a day of tension in Diagon Alley, scraping together Galleons to provide him with a seemingly endless list of school supplies. Money was tight after Lyall retired, and Remus knew that. He had seen a lifetime of counting money out secretly, when his parents thought he had gone to bed, discussing a new treatment and patching up robes by the dim light next to his mother's desk. But Remus kept quiet.</p><p>Remus never said much at all. Armed with a book for the train, the young werewolf had fully intended to get by at Hogwarts without anyone knowing a scrap of information about him. Hope and Lyall ushered him through the wall to Platform 9 3/4 and Remus' jaw dropped. There were so many people, louder than anything he had ever heard. He almost wanted to cover his ears from the din, but he resisted. He didn't want to miss a moment of this. Who knew how long he had before it all got ripped away from him? Remus took a deep breath through his nose and the smell of magic itched the inside of his sinuses. It wasn't a common smell, but he knew it well enough from the odd charm Lyall used around the house. He said goodbye to his parents after too many assertions from Lyall to stay out of trouble, for Merlin's sake.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>The moon was due in four days. Remus could feel it in his blood, the quiet hum of an animal pacing in its cage; he hungered for red meat, he wanted to run laps, he wanted to skip the confines of the train and run to Hogwarts with eyes flashing bright, but he couldn't. Instead, he ducked onto the train, struggling to contain his limbs, and started down the carriages to look for somewhere quiet to bury himself in books. Remus felt betrayed by his body at every turn, but today the nerves seemed too much. Along with the pent up energy of the wolf, his skin felt too small, his head felt too big and his mind was foggy with the need to run and play and <em>hunt</em>.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>That was a new one. He had never felt the urge to tear through the undergrowth after a scent until the last moon. Sure, the wolf tracked things, but it was with the idle pleasure of a puppy, following out of intrigue. But now it seemed sinister. He wanted to scent and chase and hunt and bite and tear and- Remus stopped dead, smacking into the back of a taller student he hadn't seen.</p><p>"Oh- oh, sorry," he mumbled, drawing his shoulders up around his ears and reaching for the door to his side, just to get out of the firing line. Remus didn't look the taller student in the eye; they towered above him. He didn't want to get into trouble on the first train ride, and his father had told him again and again just to keep his head down. He stumbled into the compartment, fumbling the door shut behind him, and came face to face with a small blonde boy with eyes the size of saucers. The wolf shuddered under his skin and Remus suppressed the urge to sniff the air like it wanted him to. He offered the boy a tiny smile and slid into the seat nearest the door, trying to make himself as small as possible.</p><p>"Hello," the blonde boy offered after a moment, still staring with saucer-wide eyes, his voice squeaking through the awkward air.</p><p>Remus nodded back, unsure of what to do next. No one had ever spoken to him first, and not in the genial way the other boy had. "Hi…” he trailed back, sliding his book open on his lap.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Silence reigned for a moment, both of the boys too shy to say anything. Remus tried to dive headfirst into his book to avoid the assault on his senses: the sounds, the sights, the smells, all the people. He just wanted to be in the woods at the back of his house, climbing trees and reading Tolkien for the millionth time. Or already at Hogwarts, seeking out the library and losing himself in those books instead.</p><p>"Pete, mate, there you are! I thought I'd bloody missed you!"</p><p>A voice boomed through the compartment and made Remus nearly jump out of his skin. He wondered for a moment quite how someone with a wolf brewing under his skin could be so woefully unaware of his surroundings before Remus remembered the boy in the doorway. He had a shock of black hair and dark rimmed glasses as thick as some of the books in Remus' bag and sported a wide grin at the blonde boy.</p><p>"I got here early," the other boy, Pete apparently, offered. Remus noted he looked immediately more comfortable. The air in the compartment seemed to thin dramatically. "Figured if I stayed still you'd track me down eventually, or we'd just be like ships in the night."</p><p>The other boy seemed appeased and straightened up, puffing out his chest as he turned to Remus. Remus glanced away, back to his book and wondered which of his many physical flaws the boy would comment on first. Instead, though, a hand was thrusted under his nose - an eleven-year-old facsimile of an adult handshake - and that voice boomed again.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>"James Fleamont Potter, nice to meet you mate, you're a first year, yeah? Me too, and Pete here, Peter Pettigrew." He paused, barely taking a breath to glance at Peter over his shoulder. "You got a middle name Pete? Why has that never come up in conversation before? Anyway-" he turned back to Remus- "sorry you got stuck with him, he's a riot eh? This compartment is the party compartment by the looks of it! Where's the music eh? What's that you're reading? Looks complicated, not a school book though eh? Have you read any of our textbooks yet? I'm on a second read through of the Transfiguration book myself, Dad says-"</p><p>James' rant was cut off by Pete carefully clearing his throat, a knowing smile on his lips. The bridge of James' nose turned red and his grin shone even wider. "Sorry, mate, turns out I ramble a bit." He gestured slightly with his hand still held out to Remus. "James Potter, like I said."</p><p>Remus cleared his throat and took the boy's hand, like he had seen his father do to the Healer that occasionally darkened their doorstep. "Remus… Lupin, hi."</p><p>"Remus! Nice to meet you mate, really is. What a name eh? I bloody love it! Nearly as good as Fleamont! That's my Dad, family tradition or something, his name is my middle name. Suppose I'll do the same when I have a son huh?"</p><p>Peter laughed as James slid into the seat next to him, pushing his glasses back onto his nose with a well practised move of the back of his hand. Peter smiled nicely at Remus. "He really does ramble a lot, but it's nice to meet you Remus."</p><p>Remus just nodded back, still hit by the barrage of words that is James Potter. He'd never had so much directed at him before. Remus wasn't even sure if he'd ever heard that many words all at once, but here he was, looking at James Potter's insane grin and the quiet reassurance of Peter Pettigrew at his shoulder. Remus found a smile on his lips and dog-eared the corner of his book to mark the place. "You too, Peter…”</p><p>There was but a second of silence before James took a breath and launched into his next tirade. Remus caught something about Quidditch, and Peter answered back just as animatedly. Remus had heard Quidditch on the wireless, but couldn't say the first thing about any of the tactics or teams the other two seem so invested in. Nevertheless, the book on Remus' lap stayed closed, and he was happy just to listen to a conversation between the two boys. He'd never heard so many words before, or heard two children his age talk the way these two did, with no punches to the arm or puerile insults, and it almost made him want to scream.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Remus was saved from that thought by a literal scream that came from the corridor. The three of them turned towards it, and Peter issued a noise that might be more at home on the tongue of a rodent. A moment later, a black haired boy strode in to view of the frosted glass in the door, arms folded across his chest, mouth set in a stern line. Two girls followed close behind him, one with startling blonde hair and the other with darker hair, and Remus couldn't help but notice the same stern set of the older girls' mouth. Remus felt for a moment that they shouldn't have been staring, but the glass in the doorway made it seem like a television and he couldn't quite look away.</p><p>"You take that back, Sirius!" The first girl shouted, her voice oddly muffled and distorted by the glass door between them all.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>The young boy turned, the sneer still on his lips. "Piss off, Cissy, I don't want to bloody sit with you anyway! So piss off!"</p><p>The girl named Cissy - the blonde one, apparently - made a noise similar to when one found dog muck on a favourite shoe and her arm twitched. The young boy flinched - the barest hint of drawn up shoulders, a face turned slightly away - but recovered in a second. The dark haired girl grabbed the blonde, a hand on her shoulder meant to placate. She muttered something the boys in the compartment couldn't hear before the two girls turned on their heels to start back down along the train. The boy was left standing in the hallway, arms crossed around his stomach, mouth still twisted in that haughty sneer. A moment passed in the compartment before James stood and moved to the door.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>"Hey, mate, want to come and sit with us?" His voice was jovial and cheery and he had that damn grin fixed onto his face, but it didn't seem to reach the sneering boy. The boy turned and fixed James with a look that didn't seem to faze him either.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Remus thought for a moment that James wouldn't even get wet in a thunderstorm if he shouldn't like to be damp. Instead, James stepped into the corridor and shut the door behind him, closing the gap between him and the other boy in a quick stride. Remus watched avidly, with the unrestrained fervour of someone having never seen a conversation so up close. But he couldn't hear the words between them, only watch the haughty boys face change from wary to relieved. James stuck out his hand in that facsimile handshake and the other boy finally took it, a soft smile spreading across his lips. James turned and strode into the compartment like he owned the place - which in all honesty, he may as well have done - and grinned at the two boys suddenly pretending they weren't staring avidly through the glass.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>"This is Pete, and this is Remus," James said genially, gesturing to the two boys in turn.</p><p>Remus offered what he hoped is a kind smile as Pete did something similar.</p><p>"Hello," the black haired boy uttered, his voice stiff and lilting in an accent Remus had not heard before. "I'm Sirius Black."</p><p>James sank into a seat, gesturing for Sirius to sit next to him, and immediately drew the boy into a conversation about Quidditch. Sirius talked as if he was not used to conversation either, and Remus found himself smiling softly to see some manner of his flaws reflected in others.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>After a time, James drew Remus into the conversation too, if only for the odd affirmative hum or smile at a joke he didn't quite understand. But James persisted nonetheless, as if they were already lifelong friends. He worked at Sirius more than he did Remus; constantly talking to the boy, hanging on to every common denominator between them. Remus found himself envious of the ease with which James Potter held himself.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>James kept the three of them close in the painfully long boat ride up to Hogwarts, the moon hanging over Remus like some awful spectre that made his skin crawl and a howl bubble in his throat. He stayed quiet, drawing his cloak around his ears and watching the lights from a distance. Sirius kept his chin tilted up, his shoulders thrown back, and Remus found he couldn't quite look away from the way the moonlight played across the angles of his face: those high, aristocratic cheekbones, the straight nose, those glittering grey eyes, the moonlight in stripes across his inky black hair. He had never seen someone look so otherworldly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Everyone in his hometown was decidedly plain looking. Lyall stood out because of his height, and Remus didn't leave the house enough to stand out himself. Peter looked sort of plain, if you didn't notice the brightness in his eyes, the eagerness to please and be a part of things. James stood out, but not for his looks. He stood out because of his attitude, his actions, the way he greeted every other first year waiting for the boats with a wide grin and a handshake, always talking and chattering away.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>But <em>Sirius</em>, he stood out. He looked like a tiny adult, as opposed to an eleven year old: straight back, straight nose, straight expression as if any emotion at all was a bad thing. Remus couldn't look away. He was so struck by the idea of having friends, and perhaps these three boys - James with his unwavering kindness, Peter with his endless reserves of loyalty, and Sirius with that desperately sharp wit - would be his friends. He couldn't look away from the three of them, so so scared to even let himself think, let himself feel - but maybe they would be friends. Sirius had spoken to James only during the journey, already in hushed whispers as if the two of them were joined at the hip, but perhaps he and Sirius could be friends too? Sirius had smiled at Remus several times throughout the train journey after all, and that was more than anyone but James had done for him before.</p><p> </p><p>In the Great Hall <em>Black, Sirius</em> was called only a few names into the register, and Remus found himself holding his breath. On the train ride, Sirius had told them briefly of the Black family history: every single one of them sorted into Slytherin. He had alluded to the fact he did not want to follow suit, almost too scared to admit it out loud. There had been a glimmer of hope in his grey eyes as they talked, four eleven year old boys all terrified and excited, learning the intricacies of conversation and strangers. But James, ever unfazed by everything, was adamant he would be in Gryffindor, which meant Peter was too. Remus didn't know where he would end up. To an extent he didn't care; he was trying to remain as passive as possible. He tried so hard not to get attached to the three boys he shared the train compartment with. They would lose interest anyway, he reasoned as soon as they stepped off the train.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>But he watched Sirius Black so incredibly carefully. He could see his mouth moving, murmuring to the Sorting Hat with a glint of desperation in his eyes as the minutes rang on and on. The echoing shout of <em>‘Gryffindor'</em> rung through the Great Hall and Remus instantly saw the look of terror on the raven-haired boys face.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>A moment of silence, a moment that seemed to stretch for an hour, and then James whooped and clapped. Then the moment was gone and there was the usual cheering of the crowd, with Sirius sliding off the chair, and shooting James a smile.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Next out of the four was <em>Lupin, Remus</em>. Remus swallowed, eyes fixed to the ground as he trudged up the steps and slid onto the stool. The hat fell onto his head, musty, hot and heavy. Silence. Then a soft voice.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>"Ooh, there's a lot here to unpack, Remus Lupin. I see that thirst for knowledge, that voracious appetite you shove away."<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Remus shrugged, he didn't care. He told himself he didn't care, even as his amber gaze flickered over to the Gryffindor table; to proud Sirius Black, hunching over the table, trying to disappear into the woodwork, then to messy haired James Potter waiting in the crowd with a wide unfailing grin, to eager Peter Pettigrew, looking up at his childhood friend with wonder.</p><p>"Oh, but then…” the hat continued, "there is a stubbornness in you, Lupin, you already deal with so much, no? You are terrified…” Remus wanted to interrupt. He was not scared! Not one bit! "-but here you are. I see what you want, what you need, so then it will be - <em>Gryffindor!"</em> The last word boomed across the hall and Remus let out a shaky breath. He slipped from the stool and hurried to the Gryffindor table, desperate to be out of the eye of the storm, in front of everyone else. Sirius smiled and nodded to the seat opposite him. Remus sank into the seat and studied the woodwork of the table, cheeks flaming red. The Sorting carried on around them, others joining their table, but Remus just sat and waited, occasionally glancing up to see Sirius doing the same. Sirius smiled softly and continued picking at the varnish on the table, watching with a hint of desperation as James stood in the crowd.</p><p><em>Pettigrew, Peter</em> was next. The hat sat on his straw blonde hair for such a long time Remus wondered if it was broken. He could hear the second year next to him whispering furiously to her friend - <em>Has it ever not sorted anyone before? Where do they go? Do they just get to pick? Would he have to go home? Poor lamb, he's as red as a stop sign </em>- and he tried to tune it out, knowing he shouldn't be able to hear their conversation with the ease he did. Sirius didn't seem to care one jot about anything other than picking the varnish on the table. At long last the hat boomed <em>‘Gryffindor'</em> and Peter practically ran over to the table, clambering onto the bench next to Remus.</p><p>"Oh Merlin, I thought I passed out for a minute there," he muttered, red faced. Remus could hear his heart pounding and practically tasted the blood on his tongue. He swallowed back a growl and looked back at the table. Sirius had started to make a shape in the table with his fingernail but said nothing.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p><em>Potter, James</em> was the last to be called, and he strode up to the stool as if he were strolling onto his hundredth Quidditch match as the best Chaser of the century. Sirius perked up and turned his head so fast Remus nearly heard the scrape of vertebrae, watching avidly. The hat barely touched his head before it boomed out <em>‘Gryffindor'</em> and James made his way over with the same spring in his step.</p><p>"We made it, lads, all four of us!" He settled into the seat next to Sirius and Remus watched with a pang of jealousy when Sirius smiled back. "What are the chances, eh? Nice one! Gryffindor lads, hopefully we'll have a dorm together, eh, there can't be that many other Gryffindor boys in this year? We're the cream of the crop obvio-"</p><p>Once again James Potter was cut off by a sharp shush further up the table, and he immediately sank into his seat, the redness settling over the bridge of his nose again. Peter rolled his eyes at the well-worn situation before him. Sirius grinned a ridiculous grin and elbowed James furiously in the side. Remus smiled behind his hand and felt for the first time in his life that he might actually just be okay.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
