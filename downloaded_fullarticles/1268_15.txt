    <p>Scorpius couldn’t help but smile as he looked over the lake at the setting sun. The oranges and reds of the sky reflected against the water, which magnified their brilliance. Even the stones of the castle glowed in the evening light. Sunsets had become Scorpius’ favourite time of day since he’d started Hogwarts. He’d been dragging Albus out to watch them since the weather had grown warm enough for it.</p><p>In the days leading up to September first, Scorpius had been convinced that his expectations for Hogwarts could only mean the school would let him down in the end. They were so high that nothing could have met them, but he’d met Albus Potter on the train.</p><p>He glanced at Albus from the corner of his eye. His best friend wasn’t as interested in the sunset as he was; his eyes had fallen closed as he leaned against the trunk of the tree they sat under. Scorpius couldn’t help but grin at the sight and took the opportunity to watch Albus more closely than he would have otherwise.</p><p>It had been nearly a year since they’d become friends, but Scorpius was still amazed that a son of Harry Potter had deemed a Malfoy worthy of being his best mate. Amazed and very thankful.</p><p>Part of him still expected to wake up one day to Albus insisting they could no longer be friends. As the year passed, he had kept expecting the fear to fade, and it would at times, only to re-emerge at a later date.</p><p>As the summer holidays grew closer, it had returned with a vengeance. Scorpius wanted to be excited about seeing his family for the first time since Christmas. He had a number of things he wanted to speak about with his mother—it wasn’t the same through letters—but he didn’t want to leave Hogwarts.</p><p>Two months was a long time apart. It was plenty of time for Albus to have a wakeup call, to realize why being friends with Scorpius was such a terrible idea.</p><p>He’d fallen so deep into his thoughts that he hadn’t noticed Albus opening his eyes until the other boy spoke.</p><p>“What is it?”</p><p>Scorpius raised an eyebrow in a silent question, and Albus pushed himself up from where he’d been reclining before continuing.</p><p>“You look upset. What’s wrong?”</p><p>Scorpius looked back towards the sun, tugging a few blades of grass out of the ground. Though his worries had plagued him all year, he’d successfully avoided telling Albus about them.</p><p>“Nothing,” he said. “I was just thinking about the summer.”</p><p>“Not much longer until it’s here,” Albus said with a grin. “We’ll be free from essays and Filch’s rules for a few months. Can’t wait.”</p><p>When Scorpius didn’t return his smile, Albus’ grin fell.</p><p>“What’s wrong then? You better have a good reason for not being excited for summer.”</p><p>“Two months is a long time. I’ll be at Malfoy Manor, and you’ll be home with your family. It just feels kind of strange is all. We haven’t been apart that long since we became friends.”</p><p>“That’s what you’re worried about?”</p><p>A blush coloured Scorpius’ cheeks at the way Albus laughed.</p><p>When Albus noticed the way his amusement had affected his friend, he sobered, scooting closer and nudging at Scorpius’ arm to get him to look at him.</p><p>“Hey. I still don’t get what you’re worried about. I guess I’ll miss the castle too, but we’ll be back in September. I bet it’ll be like nothing’s changed.”</p><p>“You really think so?” Scorpius asked with a furrowed brow.</p><p>“What are you expecting to happen?”</p><p>Scorpius sighed, staring down at the blades of grass he’d taken to shredding before he answered.</p><p>“I just don’t want to come back to school in September and us feel like strangers.”</p><p>Albus laughed, but he tried to grow serious when he noticed Scorpius wasn’t joining in, though he couldn’t entirely erase the smile from his face.</p><p>“Don’t think you’re getting rid of me the whole summer,” he said. “Obviously you can come over to our house anytime you want. You better come over, actually, because there’s only so much James I can take. I’d much rather be spending time with you.”</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>Albus’ smile grew fond at Scorpius’ surprise.</p><p>“Of course. I just hadn’t said anything because I figured you knew I’d want you to visit. Maybe we could convince my parents to let us explore London by ourselves. They’ve never let me before, but if I have you along…”</p><p>“You can come to Malfoy Manor too,” Scorpius said, suddenly far more animated. “If you want to at least. You probably don’t want to. Your house is definitely a lot brighter and exciting than mine. I mean, I’ve never been there, but I bet it is. But if you wanted to come to my house, you could, and we could try to find something to do. Maybe.”</p><p>Albus laughed, and this time, Scorpius joined in.</p><p>“That would be nice,” Albus said. “It’d be interesting to see the prestigious Malfoy Manor.”</p><p>Scorpius scowled at Albus’ chosen descriptor of his family home, and Albus laughed even more. Scorpius, feeling lighter than he had in days, couldn’t help but join in.</p>
