  <em>Auror Potter,</em>

  <em>Is your last letter supposed to be an official document? If so, I’m recommending improving your very abysmal writing skills.</em>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em>As for your request, you will have the results by the end of the week. I don’t know how you expect me to ‘move my arse‘ when this, as I already told you multiple times, is completely new substance and investigation cannot be rushed.</em>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em>When everything’s ready, I will owl the end results with the additional sample and antidote as agreed.</em>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em>And for the next time, I would appreciate for someone else to contact me. I have enough of your utter disregard for official language and my expertise.</em>

  <em>Be my guest and do it yourself. Do you know how hard it is to destilate star dust and how much will remain from 100 grams? No, of course you don’t. This is as much as could be done, but please, feel free to provide me with a ton of stardust and then I’ll make a vial.</em>

  <em>Dinner still on? I could use some dessert...</em>

  <strong>***</strong>
</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center"> </p><p align="justify">When I look at him, I see perfection. His perfectly styled hair, immaculate style, great cologne, wealth and security, his fit body. I want him, right now. Shame we’re in the restaurant. So at least I rub my ankle on his calf under the table. He grins, his perfect teeth on display.</p><p align="justify">‘Do you like the cake?’ he asks me.</p><p align="justify">‘I do, it’s delicious,’ I answer and smile back at him. It’s been a year we’ve been together and I feel like I know him for ages. We are perfect for each other, so similar in everything. I can’t imagine anyone better for myself. We are going to Italy in few weeks and I think it will be the best time to ask him. I didn’t tell anyone, I want it to be a surprise. I’ve got the ring already, matching his beautiful blue eyes.</p><p align="justify">‘Yes thank you. We will get the check too.’ the waiter is leaving and Timothy is smirking at me. ‘Lost in your head again?’</p><p align="justify">‘It’s your fault, looking this good.’ I whisper the next words, leaning forward. ‘I was thinking about Tuscany and how we will fuck under the sun, long and sweaty.’</p><p align="justify">‘Yeah? Anything else?’ he leans forward too and kisses me briefly. Then the waiter comes back, we pay and we are leaving, Timothy is grabbing my hand and pulling me with him. Outside we apparate to mine and he’s undressing me and pushing me on the bed, kissing me, making me moan his name and keen in pleasure.</p><p align="justify">And I know it when he’s sleeping next to me, breathing slowly.</p><p align="justify">He is perfect for me.</p>
