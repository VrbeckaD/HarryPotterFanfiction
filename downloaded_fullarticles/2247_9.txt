    <p>Much had changed in the Wizarding World since the end of the Second War. One of the earliest changes had been the introduction of muggleborns to Hogwarts. It was no longer strictly the job of the professors. Now, there were several muggleborn graduates who shared the duties. For Hermione Granger-Malfoy, now the head counsel of the Wizengamot, the days she spent introducing a few muggleborn children to the Wizarding World were some of the most enjoyable days of the year. </p>
<p>The list of muggle born students for the new school year had arrived only 10 minutes earlier, and Hermione had been staring, almost in shock, at the final name on the list for at least nine of those minutes. Celia Wilkins was the final name, and truly it should have been a nondescript name, and perhaps it would have been, if not for the memory surfacing in the back of Hermione’s mind. The memory of being approximately 8 years old, and asking her mother what she would name a baby sister, and her mother’s reply being Celia. Hermione would have thought nothing of it, but Wilkins was the name she’d given her parents when she’d modified their memories all those years ago, and as much as she’d searched, just after the end of the war, and then again after she’d married Lucius, it was as if her parents had disappeared. She’d long thought they’d just moved to another city in Australia, perhaps to Canberra or Melbourne, yet searches for them in those cities had always came up empty too. Could it have been because they’d moved back to Britain? That had been the one possibility that had never crossed her mind. At least not until today. </p>
<p> Hermione stood and began to pace around her office. She knew it could be a coincidence, but she had stopped believing in coincidences long ago. If Lucius were at home, she would have immediately flooed him to discuss the matter. But he was in Russia on business, and not expected back for a few days. The only other person she could talk with about this was Harry, after all he would receive the same list. </p>
<p>She walked back to her desk, and picked up her wand, with a whisper, she cast a Patronus, and asked Harry to come to her office. Sighing, she sat back at her desk, and picked up her tea, her mind still reeling from the possibilities. </p>
<p>“Hermione?” Harry questioned as he opened the door to her office. “What is it?” He’d know immediately something was troubling her. </p>
<p>“Have you looked at the muggleborn list for this year?” </p>
<p>“No why? Don’t tell me there’s a Dursley listed!” Harry could not help but laugh as he said what to him was the most ridiculous thought in the world. </p>
<p>Hermione laughed for a moment. “No, no Dursleys are listed. But…” She reached the list across to him, and pointed at the last name. </p>
<p>“Celia Wilkins.” Harry said, and then looked at Hermione. “Wilkins...isn’t that…” </p>
<p>“The surname I gave my parents after I obliviated them, yes it is.” </p>
<p>“Surely, you’re not thinking that this child could be...their child?” </p>
<p>“Do you really believe in coincidences anymore?” Hermione asked. </p>
<p>“Not really.” </p>
<p>“It would explain why they’ve disappeared in Australia.” </p>
<p>“Yes, it would. You’ve never thought of searching for them in England, have you?”</p>
<p>“No.” Hermione shook her head. “I’ve not, it’s never entered my mind to think they returned to England.” </p>
<p>Harry nodded. “Of course not.” He said softly. “I’ll go with you to meet with them.” </p>
<p>“Thank you!” Hermione hugged Harry tightly. </p>
<p>“It’s no problem, Mione.” He said softly. “I’ll phone them to make the arrangements.”</p>
<p>She couldn’t help but smile when Harry called her, Mione, after all he was literally one of the few people who could get away with it these days. “Thank you, I think even if I spoke to them on the phone, and recognized their voices…”</p>
<p>“You’d freeze.” Harry guessed. </p>
<p>“Yes, I think I would.” Hermione nodded, as she pulled away from him. </p>
<p>“Lucius is still in Russia, isn’t he?” </p>
<p>“Yes.” Hermione was thoughtful for a moment. “He’s supposed to floo me tonight.” She glanced at the clock. “Actually in about an hour given the time difference, I should get home.” </p>
<p>Harry nodded. “How are you, if it is…” </p>
<p>She sighed softly. “I don’t know, Harry. Honestly, I’d given up hope of finding them. I searched after the war ended, Lucius had people searching before we married, and then again when I was pregnant with Cressida.” She shook her head. “I don’t know.”</p>
<p>~~</p>
<p>“Hermione!” Lucius called through the floo connection. </p>
<p>She jumped up from the sofa in her setting room, and rushed to the fire. “How are the negotiations?” She asked. </p>
<p>“I suppose you would say they are going better. I only wanted to hex the Russians five times today.” He said ruefully. </p>
<p>“Well, that is better than the ten times you wanted to hex them the last time we talked.” Hermione laughed softly. </p>
<p>“Sometimes it’s the little steps.” He laughed for a moment. “I miss you.” </p>
<p>Hermione could not help but smile at his admission. “I miss you, Lucius.” </p>
<p>“What’s wrong?” He asked, as he caught the catch in her tone. </p>
<p>“Sometimes I forget how well you know me.” </p>
<p>“Yes, you do, and you’re stalling now. What’s wrong.” </p>
<p>“I received the Muggleborn list today. There’s a Celia Wilkins on it.” </p>
<p>“Wilkins…” Of course he immediately recognized the name. “Oh love…”</p>
<p>“Lucius I have a very distinct memory of asking my mother what name she would give a baby sister when I was around eight or so, the name was Celia.” </p>
<p>“What are the parents names?” He immediately asked. </p>
<p>“Harry is checking to see. He’s going to make the initial telephone contact with them, and then we’ll go together to visit them.” </p>
<p>He closed his for a moment. “I’ll floo Draco, and have him come to Russia, so I can be home sometime tomorrow.”</p>
<p>“No!” Hermione said immediately. “You don’t have to do that. We don’t know yet if it is them.”</p>
<p>“Do you really believe it’s not?” He asked softly. </p>
<p>“I don’t know.” She admitted. “I don’t want to get my hopes up only to be disappointed. Yet, I also don’t know what I will do if I come face to fact with them. It’s been twelve years.” </p>
<p>“Which means, if it is them, the child was born within a year of you sending them to Australia.” </p>
<p>“Yes, it does.” </p>
<p>“Of course the name…”</p>
<p>“Wilkins is not an uncommon name in the Muggle world, it could be a gigantic coincidence.” </p>
<p>“You’ll tell me when Potter finds out their names.” </p>
<p>“Yes, of course I will.” </p>
<p>“And if their names are Wendell and Monica, then I AM sending for Draco, and coming home.” Lucius said, knowing that he would probably tell Draco tonight that he should be prepared to come to Russia at a moment’s notice.</p>
<p>“I imagine as soon as we finish talking you will floo Draco to tell him to be prepared to come to Moscow at a moment’s notice.” </p>
<p>“You are correct.” </p>
<p>“Why do I feel as if I will awaken in the middle of the night to find you are home?” </p>
<p>“I love you.”</p>
<p>“You’re not going to answer that, are you?”</p>
<p>“No.” </p>
<p>“I love you.” Hermione replied. </p>
<p>~~</p>
<p>Hermione was half asleep as she felt the wards shift. She smiled to herself as she realized Lucius was home. Truthfully, she would have been surprised to awaken and find he’d not returned.</p>
<p>“I see you’ve taken to hugging my pillow close while I am gone.” Lucius said as he slipped into their bed. </p>
<p>“You truly should not be surprised by that.” Hermione said as she released the pillow. </p>
<p>“No more surprised than you are by my return.” </p>
<p>“That would mean not at all.” She murmured as she moved into his arms<br/>~~</p>
<p>Lucius picked up the envelope and studied it for a moment. “I believe this is Potter’s scrawl, so it’s for you.” he said as he passed it across to Hermione. He watched as she looked at it for a moment. He thought of asking if she wanted him to open it, and read it first, but then she started to open it. Her sharp intake of breath told him more than any words would ever tell him. </p>
<p>“Their names are Wendell and Monica.” It wasn’t even a question. </p>
<p>“Yes.” She nodded. “And they have a dental practice in York.” </p>
<p>Lucius studied his wife for a long moment, remembering when she’d first told him what she’d done to protect her parents, remembering how she’d searched for them, how he’d searched for them, knowing that she would want her mother there as she delivered her first child, and the unspoken pain that Hermione had held inside for the last eleven years. </p>
<p>Hermione took a deep breath, as she smoothed out Harry’s note in front of her. “Harry has made the arrangements to meet with them on Saturday morning.” </p>
<p>“Do you wish for me to go with you?”</p>
<p>Hermione reached across the table and touched his hand. It took only a moment for  Lucius to take her hand into his. “I love you for even thinking of that.” She knew Lucius would never be completely at ease in the muggle world. “But no, I don’t believe it would be wise.” </p>
<p>“You do not believe that I am the correct wizard to introduce a young, possibly, impressionable muggle born student to our world?” </p>
<p>Hermione laughed softly. “Not in a million years.” </p>
<p>Lucius gave her a look of faux-hurt, which caused Hermione to laugh even more. “So you will leave Saturday morning?”</p>
<p>“Actually, I was thinking of asking Harry if he minds if we drive to York on Friday night.” </p>
<p>Lucius ran his thumb over the palm of her hand. “I am not surprised this is a time when you feel the need to get in touch with your muggle roots.” He smiled softly at Hermione. </p>
<p>“It is.” She nodded</p>
<p>“The Land Rover or the Mercedes?”</p>
<p>Hermione smiled, knowing Lucius could not stand to ride in her small Mercedes coupe, and she couldn’t help but believe Harry would feel the same. “The Land Rover, I believe Harry would share your dislike of the Mercedes.” ‘’</p>
