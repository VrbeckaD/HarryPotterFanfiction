    <p align="justify">There was silence after the sorting hat finished its song.</p><p align="justify">
  <em>That was definitely a warning. </em>
</p><p align="justify">Harry sat numbly as Nearly Headless Nick murmured "The hat is honour bound to warn the school whenever it sees fit to do so " to Hermione.</p><p align="justify">As the first years began to get sorted, Harry looked up to the head table. Unlike the past few years, there was no new face to be found. However, Harry wasn't looking for the new teacher. He was trying to catch the eye of Professor Dumbledore. So far, not a twinkle had been sent in his direction. It was as if Dumbledore had never showed up to defend him against Fudge during his hearing.</p><p align="justify">What if Dumbledore didn't trust him?</p><p dir="ltr" align="justify">Harry nervously grabbed a goblet near him and gulped down its contents.</p><p dir="ltr" align="justify">
  <em>Well, even if he doesn't trust me, the least I can do is follow Hermione's lead and trust him.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr" align="justify">Harry closed his eyes, savouring the familiar atmosphere of the Great Hall and the strangely satisfying tang of pumpkin juice in his mouth. For a moment, he could almost imagine that a crazed megalomaniac with a flair for drama wasn't after him. Almost.</p><p dir="ltr" align="justify">He smiled slightly as he recalled how much he had been worrying about being expelled during the summer.</p><p dir="ltr" align="justify">A terrified looking first year got sorted into Gryffindor and Harry clapped enthusiastically along with the rest of his table. Now that he knew for sure that Dumbledore had taken action against Voldemort by gathering the Order, he could relax, momentarily. After all, he was back where he truly belonged,his one and only home — Hogwarts. With no creepy old snake nazis chasing him.</p><p dir="ltr" align="justify">"I wonder who our new defense teacher is going to be," said Hermione brightly as she bit into a custard tart.</p><p dir="ltr" align="justify">"Gee I don't know, 'Mione. Maybe it'll be another one of my dad's long lost friends. Or even better, one of Voldemort's–" (Hermione flinched, Ron choked on a chicken bone) "–henchmen that was sent for the sole purpose of making sure I die."</p><p dir="ltr" align="justify">Ron coughed and cleared his throat awkwardly. He opened his mouth to speak, but closed it when Dumbledore stood up, his blue eyes twinkling at everyone in the Great Hall.</p><p dir="ltr" align="justify">
  <em>Except me</em>
</p><p dir="ltr" align="justify">Harry bitterly turned back to his plate, swallowing the anger that was always so quick to bubble to the surface these days. </p><p dir="ltr" align="justify">"Now that we have all been fed and watered, allow me to make a few regular start of term notices. The forbidden forest, as the name suggests, is off limits. Mr.Filch has reminded me to inform all of you to check and abide by the extensive list of school rules which can be found on his office door." Fred and George had identical evil grins on their faces. Harry tried not to laugh when he noticed nearly half the school (including the Slytherins) was staring at them. He idly stirred his soup, only half listening to the headmaster's words.</p><p dir="ltr" align="justify">"We have a new professor on staff this year. He will be teaching Defense against the dark arts. I hope all of you will give Professor MortlDove a warm welcome when you meet him during lessons."</p><p dir="ltr" align="justify">Murmurs rippled through the students. Where was this professor during the most important meal of the year?</p><p dir="ltr" align="justify">There was a sudden flash of lightning, followed by the loud rumble of thunder. One of the more skittish first years screamed. The grand oak doors of the great Hall flew open and a hush fell over the students. A figure stood silhouetted at the doorway. It ominously strode forward. He was wearing a long turban reminiscent of Professor quirrel and flowing black robes that at first glance appeared to be a muggle Bedouin cosplay. Harry squinted at the elaborate embroidery on the sash that was tied around the figure's waist. It looked like protective runes that were written with many dots and loops. Harry's eyes travelled up to the man's face and he froze.</p><p dir="ltr" align="justify">Bone white skin,blood red eyes and a snake nose. His thin lips curled into a sneer when he caught sight of Harry staring at him incredulously.</p><p dir="ltr" align="justify">"Ah Professor MortlDove! Just in time!"  Dumbledore beamed genially at Lord bloody Voldemort. Harry stood up. He knew that the entire school was staring at him curiously. He didn't care. He slowly raised his hand and pointed a shaking finger at 'Professor MortlDove'.</p><p dir="ltr" align="justify">"THAT IS VOLDEMORT!"</p><p dir="ltr" align="justify">The entire Hall gasped in unison. For one glorious moment, Harry thought the universe was finally going his way. Voldemort would be caught and given the Kiss and he would finally be freE–</p><p dir="ltr" align="justify">
  <em> Are those idiots seriously more terrified by the sound of his name than the idea that he might actually be under their noses?</em>
</p><p dir="ltr" align="justify">Harry felt like burying his head into his arms. He turned to the head table where Dumbledore was looking at him with an odd expression.</p><p dir="ltr" align="justify">"Professor Dumbledore, you gotta believe me, this is the guy that came out of the caudroun at the graveyard last year! I SAW HIM!"</p><p dir="ltr" align="justify">A large,skeletal hand rested on his shoulder. Harry shuddered and whirled around in time to see an unhinged expression on Voldemort's before he said</p><p dir="ltr" align="justify">"عفوا تأخرت قليلا يا أستاذ دمبلدور"</p><p dir="ltr" align="justify">"SIR GET DOWN HE IS PROBABLY TRYING TO KILL YOU WITH AN EXOTIC CURSE!" Yelled Harry as he tried to surreptitiously steal the white wand tucked into Voldemort's fancy belt-sash-rune-thing.</p><p dir="ltr" align="justify">Dumbledore merely looked amused at the whole situation. Harry blinked.</p><p dir="ltr" align="justify">"Harry," Dumbedore began benignly, "Professor MortlDove was just apologising to me for being late to the feast. In Arabic" Harry blinked again. Dumbledore turned to the rest of the students.</p><p dir="ltr" align="justify">"I was about to explain to all of you before Professor MortlDove graced us with his presence, but our new professor has spent many years studying defensive magic in Egypt, Turkey, Yemen and Saudi Arabia. He is more than qualified for the job, and may even teach you some extra spells that are not based in Latin! In fact , I do believe he is the most qualified wizard I have ever hired for the defense position..." Dumbledore's expression became nostalgic but Harry had had just about enough.</p><p dir="ltr" align="justify">"PROFESSOR!" He bellowed "THIS GUY IS NOT PROFESSOR MORTLDOVE! HE IS LYING ABOUT NOT BEING ABLE TO SPEAK ENGLISH ! HE IS VOLDEMORT!" </p><p dir="ltr" align="justify">Voldemort laughed a high, cold laugh. "Ssilly boy, of coursse I can sspeak in Englissh! How elsse would I be able to teach at Hogwartss?"</p><p dir="ltr" align="justify">Harry glared at him "That doesn't change the fact that you're Voldemort."</p><p dir="ltr" align="justify">Dumbledore's smile somehow became even more patronising than before.</p><p dir="ltr" align="justify">"Harry my boy, I have met Tom before. I think I would know Voldemort if I saw him"</p><p dir="ltr" align="justify">"HE TOUCHED MY FACE AND SCREAMED NYEEEAH AT ME! I THINK YOU WOULD REMEMBER HIS FACE BETTER IF HE DID THAR TO YOU!"</p><p dir="ltr" align="justify">Voldemort looked pained. "I apologisse if my appearancce hass frightened you with my pale skin and red eyes, Mr.Potter. I am a what do you call it? Albanian?"</p><p dir="ltr" align="justify">"Albino." Harry corrected automatically before he caught the triumphant smirk on Voldemort's face.</p><p dir="ltr" align="justify">
  <em> Dammit. I fell right into that one.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr" align="justify">Harry straightened determinedly "Okay so you're an albino. How do you explain your lack of hair?"</p><p dir="ltr" align="justify">Voldemort didn't even flinch.</p><p dir="ltr" align="justify">"Wizarding Chemotherapy"</p><p dir="ltr" align="justify"><em> Is there even such a thing? Then again, Dumbledore is not interjecting so he must be talking about something real</em>.</p><p dir="ltr" align="justify">Harry pulled out his trump card. "You can explain the rest away but why the hell do you not have a nose, Vol—"</p><p dir="ltr" align="justify">"Merlin Harry!" Ron looked scandalised.</p><p dir="ltr" align="justify">"You can't just ask someone why they don't have a nose!"</p><p dir="ltr" align="justify">Voldemort laughed his high, cold laugh again.</p><p dir="ltr" align="justify">"I don't mind, Mr.Potter. If you must know, it was a a simple case of a wizarding 'Got your nose' game gone wrong . My <em>dear</em> father never stopped apologising for it and I find it adds to my intimidation factor. Though I must admit, it worked a little too well if I reminded you of this dark lord Volmot—who sounds like he is <em>incredibly</em> handsome by the way."</p><p dir="ltr" align="justify">Dumbledore twinkled again. "There you go, Harry. Tom wouldn't get his own name wrong. And he hates his father."</p><p dir="ltr" align="justify">
  <em>But-but you could hear the sarcasm when he said my dear father.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr" align="justify">Dumbledore beamed at a dumbfounded Harry as Hermione led him back to their seat. Harry sighed.</p><p dir="ltr" align="justify">
  <em> This year won't be any different then.</em>
