  <strong> <em>Aithérios</em> </strong>
</p><p>          Just shy of midnight, Anagnóstis notices a sudden change in the stars that were normally calm. He notices the stars starting to dance with each other, their light mixing and fading, crossing each other as if they were doing a váls itself. Their colors changing and just...happiness presenting itself within the stars of the night sky. But the moment the clock strikes twelve, the stars shrivel, as if in fear, and the sky is filled with the moon shining brightly along with the red stars gathering together. Anagnóstis gasps, his glitter gray eyes widening as he watches the stars play a story of disaster and prosperity. In his four hundred seventy-five years of age, he has never before seen such a display by the stars.</p><p>          As the kingdom's and Royal family's official star reader, Anagnóstis sees in front of his eyes, a prophecy that has only been written in history books, come alive. He calls upon the Faun guard through the <em>Krystállina Aéra </em>(meaning: Air crystal) to let the commander know of the happening, and as he talks to guard about what he must tell their protector, he realizes for the first time since the change in stars, the reality: The new royals have been chosen and the evil, the monstrous devil's evil, would be returning. Soon Aitherios would be facing danger, but this danger would not come without the kingdoms most powerful Guardians: The New Royal Line.</p><p>          Aitherios would once again have the chance to be prosperous and ethereal, regardless of the danger. The fairies and elves and all his fellow children would be free from the desolate hope they've been trapped in for five hundred-twelve years.<br/> <em>Fýsi afxánetai gia tin prostasía</em>.</p>
