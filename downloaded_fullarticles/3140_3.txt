    <p>Luna had always known she wasn't interested in boys. It had never really matterd to her though, boys weren't interested in her, until the yule ball, when they were required to find someone. Luna went a number of weeks without being asked, so it was an enormous surprise when ginny weasley, a girl she often admired, asked her.<br/>In the weeks leading up to the ball after ginny asked her, the pair became inseparable. Luna had nobody else to talk to, and many of ginny's friends had abandoned her after learning she was into girls, so they had nothing better to do. Ginny found luna's weird perspectives on the world to be fascinating and luna found ginny's equally so.<br/>When the night of the yule ball finally arrived, luna was dressed in a shimmering kaleidoscopic ball gown, she looked around for her girlfriend, and when she finally found her she was amazed. Ginny was wearing a gown made of what looked like an old green curtain which matched her eyes, it was a simple and cheap garment, but she managed to make it look like the most beautiful dress in the room. The girls kissed. "shall we dance?" luna asked.</p>
