    <p>Welcome to Ilvermorny—</p>
<p>            Credence was nervous.  More nervous than he’d been since the day ma had brought him to the church when he’d been informed that he was being adopted.  Granted the orphanage hadn’t been ideal, but he knew what to expect there, this new place he didn’t know and had spent most of the rest of his childhood worried about what was going to happen next.  Credence could even freely admit that right now he was more nervous than the nights when he’d go home and know that ma was going to be angry with him.  Credence had spent most of his childhood up until that specific point in time worried about something.  Where his next meal would come from when the next beating would occur. </p>
<p>            It never once occurred to him that those worries would all fade away with a simple note.  Oddly that note didn’t come in the mail, not the way you would expect your life to change.  Instead, his saving grace arrived attached to the leg of a pigeon.  A very persistent pigeon that refused to go away even when Mary Lou noticed the paper attached and tried shoo it away.  Mary Lou’s reaction was dark, very dark and Credence needed to endure that anger for nearly a month before leaving.  The beatings were harsh, left marks that he was sure would never fade away.  In the back of his mind though Credence just tried to remind himself that there was an end, a light.  That month flew by quicker than Credence ever believed a month was capable of flying by.</p>
<p>            Looking out the carriage window Credence couldn’t stop the butterflies from floating in his stomach.  There was a part of him that still doubted whether this life was meant for him.  The doubt had been floating around his head from the moment the letter had been delivered to ma’s house.  She hadn’t been happy, had hoped that living in a church would be an excellent way to avoid the school and yet it hadn’t.  The letter showed up, and with that, the young man was being torn from her grip.  Credence may not have understood the hate she had for the wizarding community, but in the time, she had left with him he had begun to realize, slowly, painfully how much ma disliked everything about wizards.  Each night he’d gone to bed hungry and in pain, yet when the time came for him to go to school, Mary Lou made sure that Credence made it to the proper station. </p>
<p>            Hunched down in his carriage seat Credence wrapped himself in the jacket that he managed to bring with him.  The robes that he had weren’t in the best shape, and the last thing he wanted was to bring one out too soon and have another reason for kids to make fun of him.  Closing his eyes Credence hoped the trip didn’t take too long.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>            “Percy Graves!”  Seraphina walked into the carriage and along with her brought a light that no one had yet been able to explain.  “How was your summer?”  She hadn’t spoken to him in over a month, and while that was normal, it didn’t mean that she hadn’t missed him.  To the contrary, Seraphina felt a particular affection towards Percival that was only friendly and at the same time something that made it all too clear that he was someone that she would have in her life forever.  </p>
<p>            “It’s Percival, Sera.  I don’t know how many times I have to remind you of that.”  Percival muttered the retort mostly under his breath though he did sound annoyed compared to his normal demeanor.  “I invited Tina and Jacob to sit with us.  Tina’s sister is a first year.  She’s going to be joining us too.  I figured that it would be perfect for you.”  Seraphina was going to end up being the first, fourth year to make prefect.  That’s what Percival thought anyways, and so did most of the students at Ilvermorny.</p>
<p>            Queenie, Tina, and Jacob all quickly tumbled into the carriage with Percival and Seraphina.  The five of them made themselves at home for the long trip.  Even with magic the trip still felt as though it took forever.  “Did everyone have a good summer?”  Jacob was pulling out a basket that his mother had given him.  “My mom baked a buncha things for us to eat on the trip back to school.” </p>
<p>            Jacob handed out pastries to each of his carriage mates.  To say that they were all friends was a bit of an overstatement.  All the students were on friendly terms.  Percival was always a little more standoffish than most.  He’d gotten rather close to Seraphina during their first year and had a certain amount of respect for Tina.  She didn’t take guff from very many people, and the truth was that Percival found that to be a somewhat redeemable quality to have. </p>
<p>Seraphina took a bite out of one of the cream horns that Jacob handed her.  “So, Queenie are you nervous about the sorting?”  Seraphina was the one person that most everyone assumed would be head girl when she reached her last year at Ilvermorny.  Unless of course they bent the rules and allowed her to do so sooner.  Either way, she had the demeanor to be a politician.</p>
<p>            Glancing down at the robes she was wearing Queenie smiled and shook her head.  “No, not at all.  I think that I’m more nervous about everyone else.”  Queenie had never been shy, but at the same time, people never were quite sure how to take her and her abilities. </p>
<p>            Tina reached over at that moment and placed at hand on her sister’s shoulder.  “You’ll be fine Queenie and here is the one place that you don’t have to worry about things.”  It didn’t matter how many times she tried to assure her; Queenie always seemed a little worried about the way that people would treat her.</p>
<p>            Jacob was quiet but watched the two sisters carefully.  Finally, he finished the paczki he had been eating and began to speak.  “I’m sure things will be just fine.  It’s not like anyone here is snobby or anything.”  Pausing he glanced over at Percival who had been looking out the window.  “Unless you count Percival and he’s not snotty as much as just aloof.”</p>
<p>            Percival was pulled out of his reverie.  “I’m not anything of the sort.”</p>
<p>            Seraphina rested her hand on his shoulder.  “Percival is just serious… all the time.”</p>
<p>            Everyone began to snicker except for Percival who crossed his arms over his chest.  Perhaps he was serious most of the time.  It was something that he came by naturally.  He was a Graves, and that meant by nature that he was a serious person, maybe aloof was a good word.  Snobby, snotty and even rude weren’t quite the words that he’d ever use to describe himself.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>            The trip was lonely.  The carriage wound its way through woods and mountains, twining its way through like a snake slithering around the forest floor.  Credence sat with a couple of other students that didn’t speak with him at all.</p>
<p>            Part of him wondered if it was the way he was dressed, most of the students were already wearing their robes, and instead, he was still dressed in his regular clothing.  There was this bit of him that hoped that he’d have a chance to change once the carriage stopped. The other part wondered if perhaps it was just everyone being shy.  There was a darker part still that wondered if this was always going to be the way that things were.  He’d spent much of his life without friends and Credence honestly hadn’t expected things to change just because his surroundings did.   </p>
<p>            The carriage came to a stop.  Credence stood to exit the cart along with everyone else.  Professors were standing at the entry directing traffic.  “Everyone please line up according to years.  We need to get the sorting underway.”  Hesitating Credence wanted to ask about changing; he lingered back behind the rest of the first years.  One of the professors glanced down at him, and he barely made eye contact.  “You didn’t wear your robes…”</p>
<p>            Shaking his head Credence started to open his mouth to speak, and nothing came out.  He wanted to say something, and instead, a squeak that sounded almost as though he was on the verge of tears emerged from his lungs. </p>
<p>            Waving his wand, the professor transfigured Credence’s jacket into a robe.  It wasn’t anything special, but Credence couldn’t help but notice that it was much better than the robes he had in his trunk.  Running up the path, he caught up quickly with the rest of the first years that were waiting to enter the school.</p>
<p>            Seventh years went in first and lined the entry, and each class moved down.  When the first years were the only ones left to enter the hall all the professors stood behind the students.</p>
<p>            There was a woman, tall, dark skinned, very regal standing on a platform in the middle of the room.  She raised her hands to silence the large group of people.  Credence couldn’t help but be impressed with the way that she commanded the crowd. </p>
<p>            “Good evening.  I know you’ve all had quite the long day.  I’m sure you want nothing more than to find out which house you will be joining so that you can find your bed, get settled in and then meet in the dining hall for dinner.  Before we start moving along with the sorting, I want to take a few moments to make sure that the first years know that while meals aren’t required most of the time this first dinner is required for the first years.  There are some housekeeping details that we need to go over that are best done over a meal.”  With a rather large smile on her face, the headmistress waved her hands and cleared her throat.  “So, without further ado.  Let’s begin the sorting ceremony.  Please each first year, when your name is called stand in the middle of the entry and wait for the statues to speak.”</p>
<p>            One by one students were called into the entry hall.  “Emily Abbott” A blonde student walked into the hall and stood in the middle of a room ringed with other students.</p>
<p>            Four statues remained silent for a moment before a rather sizeable horned serpent slithered forward and hissed loudly.  The students lined around the statue cheered and moved so that the new first year could join the rest.  </p>
<p>            There were four other students called before Credence’s name was called.  He was so nervous he had no recollection of what happened for them.  Didn’t know which house any of them belonged to now or anything of the sort. </p>
<p>            “Credence Barebone” Credence looked up at the sound of his own name and then walked through the door.  He was hunched over himself and clearly nervous about something.  Standing in the middle of the room he waited patiently, albeit a little nervously for one of the statues to make noise.  It seemed like it took forever.  At first, Credence thought not one of the statues were going to pick him.  Even the professors started to mutter amongst themselves.  Then without any warning whatsoever, the wampus cat roared, and the thunderbird soared high above the room. </p>
<p>            Clearing her throat, the headmistress smiled at Credence.  “Well young man.  It seems that you have a choice to make.  Wampus or Thunderbird house have both spoken and would very much like to have you amongst their ranks.  It’s a very prestigious place to be in Mr. Barebone.  So, which would you choose?”</p>
<p>            Credence had never had the opportunity to pick anything in his entire life.  Glancing around the room.  The students behind Thunderbird and Wampus he eventually spoke up after first muttering his choice so quietly that not even the headmistress could make out his words.  “I… I choose Wampus.”  The entire hall erupted in applause and Credence was directed to stand with the rest of the Wampus house. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>            Percival stood with the rest of the students in Wampus.  Most of them weren’t what he’d consider friends.  They were kind enough, ones that he’d partner with if he needed someone as a partner for a duel and Seraphina wasn’t available.  However, there was this side of most of the Wampus students that didn’t quite fit with Percival.  He was far too reserved, far too quiet for most. </p>
<p>            As the first years began to file in one by one into the entry, Percival looked across towards the Horned Serpents and found Seraphina.  She had an oddly serene look on her face as if there was nothing at all to worry about.  Perhaps there wasn’t; perhaps these things only made Percival nervous because he truly was as uptight as everyone said he was. </p>
<p>            One by one each student was chosen by different houses.  Emily Abbott was picked by Horned Serpent.  Percival could see the pleased look on Seraphina’s face.  He would have to visit that later, though he was sure that it was merely her being the typical type a person that she was.  Always looking for what she considered to be the brightest students.  Emily certainly appeared to fit that bill, sharp eyes, a knowing look that didn’t seem to miss a single thing that happened in the room.</p>
<p>            Everyone else was uneventful.  All until one Credence Barebone stepped into the middle of the entry.  For a long time, everything was silent.  You could hear the quiet shuffling of feet on stone and wood floors.  Percival could see the nervous look on Credence’s face when nothing happened.  Only about twenty more seconds passed before not one, but two of the statues attempted to claim him.  That wasn’t unheard of.  Seraphina had been ‘claimed’ by all four houses before she picked Horned Serpent. </p>
<p>            Thunderbird and Wampus weren’t that far off in all honesty.  Although just looking at Credence, standing there hunched in on himself Percival wondered just what exactly it was that those all-knowing statues could see in the boy that no one else could.  Percival lost himself in thought debating that very thought when Credence made his decision.  He hadn’t even heard which house Credence chose before someone was elbowing him in the ribs and leaning over, far too close for Percival to be comfortable.  “Well, who would have guessed that he’d want to join our house?” </p>
<p>            That was a fair question since in Percival’s mind Credence looked much more like a Horned Serpent.  Sure, he was barely taking his eyes off the floor, but when he did, they burned with an intensity that nearly took the youngest Graves heir’s breath away.  “Why does anyone pick Wampus if they have the choice?”  Shrugging off the question as his eyes followed the young man who was now standing on the very edge of the group of Wampus students Percival fought the urge to make his way over and introduce himself immediately.</p>
<p>           Queenie was sorted into Pukwudgie which surprised no one really.  She skipped over to the rest of the students in the house with a large smile on her face.  Jacob was standing towards the edge of the group of students and waved Queenie over to introduce her to some of the other students.  Credence had been standing there and watching the entire interaction take place.  Secretly he wished that someone would take him under their arm like that, introduce him to other students so that he didn’t feel quite so alone. </p>
<p>            The rest of the students were sorted into their houses and then released to the dorms.  It was a rather uneventful greeting. </p>
<p>            “You’ll all be expected to be in the Dining Hall for dinner at six sharp.  That is when we will have all our beginning of the year messages.  Until then first years, please follow the directions of the house heads and upper-class people.”  The headmistress walked through the main doors, the heavy wood creaking as they swung open allowing the influx of students to follow. </p>
<p>            Seraphina caught up to Percival.  “So, Credence Barebone huh?”  She didn’t say anything else, and Percival merely glanced over at her before he continued walking through the entrance.</p>
<p>            “I’m afraid I’m missing your point Sera.”</p>
<p>            “Oh, come on Percy.  A new student, picked by two houses, clearly an omega… You’ve got to be in love… or at least in lust.”  She was obviously teasing, to some extent. </p>
<p>            Percival stopped in his tracks and just stared at her.  “I don’t have a clue what you’re talking about.  Besides I’m not in love or LUST with anyone.”</p>
<p>            “Suit yourself.  We’ll see how long that lasts Perce.”  Seraphina turned down the corridor and headed towards the tower where Horned Serpent dorms were located. </p>
<p>            Percival kept walking in the hopes of avoiding Credence for just a little while longer.  He’d lost most of the other Wampus students, and that was the way things usually had been for him since the second year.  Turning a corner, Percival nearly walked into a smaller student who was standing in the middle of the hall looking very confused.  “Hey!"</p>
<p>            Looking down and seeing that he was on the verge of tears Percival immediately started to apologize.  “Don’t cry it’s alright.  I’m sorry.  Look if you’re lost, I can help you find your way.  I may not be the best when it comes to finding all the houses, but I’m pretty good which one are you headed too?”</p>
<p>            Credence looked up at the older student with big brown eyes.  He remained silent at first and then swallowed before speaking.  “Um… we…. w…. we’re in the same house.  My name’s Credence.  I’m in Wampus house too.”  His eyes immediately darted back to the ground. </p>
<p>            Percival was reminded of the student standing in the middle of the entry waiting for the statues.  “Right.  Credence Barebone.  I should have remembered you.  It’s not every day that someone’s picked by more than one house.  I’m Percival Graves.  Everyone calls me Percival.  Some people call me Graves, but I prefer Percival.”  Standing awkwardly Percival still hadn’t started to move towards the dorms yet.</p>
<p>            “I… I didn’t expect you to remember my name.  I’m not anyone special.”  Credence glanced up for a moment and smiled.  Graves seemed like a rather dour name.  Something that didn’t quite fit the boy standing in front of him.  “Graves doesn’t quite fit you.  You definitely seem more like a Percival before I would think of you as a Graves.”  Rocking back on his heels Credence smiled. </p>
<p>            Nodding down the corridor, Percival began to walk in the direction where Credence could have sworn nothing was.  There was no light; everything looked as though it disappeared into nothingness.  Hesitating for a moment Credence glanced back over his shoulder.  Swallowing back the fear that began to rise in his chest he started to follow Percival.  “It’ll be just fine Credence.  I promise you I know where I’m going.” </p>
<p>            Credence relaxed at the words and began to follow Percival.  “I wasn’t d… doubting you exactly it’s just that… I… I’ve had some bad experiences with dark alleys.”  Though it was a different time and Credence didn’t want to think about it anymore. </p>
<p>            Percival wanted to ask, he paused for a moment and instead of asking when it was clear that Credence didn’t want to talk about it.  “Come on you don’t have to walk behind me.  Don’t want you getting lost again.”  Waiting for a moment for Credence to catch up Percival couldn’t help but smile.  It was nice to be around someone younger.  He was the youngest in his family and therefore always coddled far more than he felt he needed to be.  It was clear that Credence was hardly coddled. </p>
<p>            Turning down a hidden corridor before reaching the extremely dark area the two walked along in silence.  Credence didn’t know what to say, and Percival didn’t have much to say.  At least until he thought about something that was said before they left the entry.  “What is so important about being in the Dining Hall for dinner?  I mean what is it that they have to talk to us about?”  Credence glanced over at Percival.</p>
<p>            Percival considered the question for a moment.  “Um… there are a few things about being a wizard that make us slightly different.  Those are the things that make you different.  Well, that among other things.”  Pausing he regarded Credence for a moment.  “Have you grown up in a wizarding house or no-maj?” </p>
<p>            “What’s a no-maj?”  Credence asked the question not realizing how silly the question made him sound. </p>
<p>            Resting a hand on his shoulder, Percival started laughing.  “Well, then I suppose that all of this is going to be new to you.  I think that maybe it would be better to wait until dinner to hear about all of this.  The headmistress is much better equipped at explaining all of that stuff.”  Besides, it wasn’t something that Percival really figured he would be good at explaining so he decided that it would be better to wait and let Credence find out from the headmistress.</p>
<p>            The two of them finally reached a doorway that Credence found rather uninviting.  Percival walked up to it and pushed directly in the middle of it.  Credence wondered if it would be above his head.  Even though he wasn’t that much shorter than Percival right now, there was enough of a height difference that he thought it would make a difference.  The reality was that the age difference, the fact that Percival was so used to the school, and the fact that he was just a little bit more mature gave Credence a skewed view of the older boy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>            The common room of Wampus was terrific.  Credence didn’t know what to think when he walked into the room and looked around.  The couches, fireplace, and carpets were lush.  The curtains were just dark enough to make the room feel warm even if it was cold outside.  The walls were dark colored; Credence couldn’t tell if they were stone, wood or painted.  He was sure that some of the people would think that the room was cold, uninviting and yet Credence couldn’t help but feel so utterly comfortable there.  It was home, more home than he’d felt ever in the church.</p>
<p>            “Credence Barebone, I presume?”  A girl was standing at the fireplace with a smile on her face.  Credence came to an abrupt stop and looked at her with wide eyes.</p>
<p>            “Y… Yes.”  Credence nodded his head and tried to smile even though he knew that the look was more pained that anything else.  That was something he was going to have to work on.</p>
<p>            “Wonderful.  I was beginning to wonder where you got off too.  I see that Percy here managed to get your attention.”  Her eyes moved to where Percival was standing to the side talking to a couple of other students that he was clearly friends with.  “Either way.  Your dorm is up these stairs to the left.  First through fourth years are on the left, and fifth through seventh are on the right.  If you have any questions, please feel free to ask.  Sam will be here later tonight.  He had a family emergency that he needed to see to before getting back to school.  He’s one of the prefects of Wampus. I’m Aiyana; most people tend to call me Yana though. I don’t mind either.”  Her smile was genuine, and Credence felt very comfortable around her.  “I should let you find your dorm though so that you can be ready for dinner.  It’s soon, and there’s much to go over.  The headmistress likes when things are prompt.”</p>
<p>            Credence turned towards the stairs and headed up them.  He wasn’t sure where his trunk had disappeared too.  When he’d left the carriage, it was clear that no one was worrying about their trunk.   He thought that it meant that it would be in his dorm.  Briefly, he glanced back over his shoulder and didn’t see Percival anymore standing by the fireplace talking to his friends.  There was a part of him that was slightly disappointed that he wouldn’t have anyone to look for his bed with. </p>
<p>            Opening the door to the dorms Credence was surprised to see that there were only three beds and stairs heading up and another set heading down.  He wasn’t sure where to go.  Looking at the trunks at the foot of each of the beds on the level he was on now Credence knew that it was not there.  Standing in the middle of the room he debated where to go.  Percival walked down the stairs and cleared his throat.  “Credence, looking for your bed?” </p>
<p>            Credence glanced over and noticed that Percival was walking with another boy.  Instead of saying anything he just nodded.  There was something about talking in front of another person that made Credence paralyzed with something akin to fear. </p>
<p>            The boy Percival was with; Credence thought his name was Martin though he wasn’t sure turned towards the door.  “Glad you had a good summer, Percival.  I’ll see you around.” </p>
<p>            Percival waved him off and then turned to Credence.  “How about we see if we can find your trunk?”  Why he found it so damn important to be helpful to this new first year was beyond him.  “Normally the first years are down a level or two, so we can start there.” </p>
<p>            Credence figured that would be the case.  He started towards the staircase that headed down.  “I figured as much.”  Making their way down the first set of stairs Credence glanced around and sighed.  He still didn’t see his trunk which just meant that he needed to go down the next set of stairs.  “You know I’m sure I’ll find it eventually.  You can head to the dining hall instead of wandering around here.”  Part of Credence wondered if Percival just felt sorry for him, the other part wondered if he felt as though he needed to protect Credence for some reason. </p>
<p>            “It’s okay.  You have to make it to the dining hall more so than I do.  So, I think that it’s important for me to help you find your things.”  Percival smiled at Credence and started down the other staircase.  “What does your trunk look like?”</p>
<p>             “M… My trunk is just this old beat up thing.”  Credence shrugged not knowing what to say.  When he reached the bottom of the stairs, Credence realized that there was just one bed with a trunk assigned to it.  Walking up to it he sighed.  It was his trunk, and while there was a part of him that was relieved that he wouldn’t be sharing space with someone there was another part that couldn’t help but be disappointed that he wouldn’t have any roommates.  “Here I am.”  Credence turned towards Percival and plastered on a fake smile.  “In the basement.” </p>
<p>            “It’s not the basement.”  Percival stated quickly and looked around more than a little disappointed that there wasn’t another first year down there with Credence.  “I actually had my bed down here during my first year.”  It was the truth, of course, once Percival’s parents heard his bed was on the lowest level they had it quickly moved to the next floor. </p>
<p>            That revelation made Credence feel only slightly better.  He opened his trunk and looked through the contents and sighed.  If anything, he was glad that he at least had all the supplies that he needed for the year.  It didn’t matter to him if everything came from the second-hand store in Diagon Alley.  Most everyone else would judge he was certain; Credence though didn’t care.  If his clothes fit, he was happy.  He had been so used to pants that didn’t quite fit, shirts that had cuffs that were always a tad too short and though his robes were a bit beat up the one thing he did know was that they fit the way they were supposed to. </p>
<p>            “Right well, I’ll see you around.  I’m going to head to the dining hall.  I’m supposed to meet Sera there.  Do you know how to get there?”  Percival was slowly edging towards the stairs to exit and paused before leaving.</p>
<p>            Looking up Credence nodded.  “I’m sure that if I don’t know where I’m going, I’ll find someone that will show me the way.  They’re not going to let some first-year miss dinner, tonight right?” </p>
<p>            He had a point that Percival knew was the truth.  “Yeah, you’re right.  I’ll see you around.”  Walking up the stairs, Percival disappeared and headed towards the dining hall.  He should wait, there was that tug in his chest that told him to wait and yet at the same time Percival knew that he didn’t want to come off as too pushy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>            “Took you long enough Percy.”  Seraphina moved over enough to make room for Percival to sit down next to her. </p>
<p>            Sighing he rolled his eyes.  “Sera I told you…”  He started talking while taking a seat.  “Percival not Percy.” </p>
<p>            Typically, people stuck to sitting at their house tables.  Percival and Seraphina had strayed from that standard from the beginning.  The first year the two met on the carriage ride to Ilvermorny and had been inseparable since.  At first other students thought that it was strange, that the two were stuck up and felt that they were better than everyone else.  Then there were the rumors that the two were a couple, possibly set up by their families and so they had to stay together to get to know each other, not grow too close to anyone else and draw shame on their families.  None of those were exactly the case, although the two were at the top of their class and didn’t quite fit in with everyone else.  They just thought that there were things about the wizarding world that was strange.  It took a long time for the two of them to realize that they had that in common and that it was something that not everyone agreed with. </p>
<p>            “Percival, Percy… Whatever it is today, I’m sure that you’ll be fine with the other tomorrow.  After all, it’s me.  I’ve always been your friend, and that’s not likely to change.”  Seraphina snorted as her gaze lingered on Percival longer.  “So, do you care to enlighten me as to what took you so long?” </p>
<p>            Shrugging Percival waved the question off.  “Just was helping one of the first years find their way to their bunk.”  That was something completely out of character for Percival, and he knew it. </p>
<p>            Instead of probing him more Seraphina just let the subject drop.  He didn’t want to talk about any of this clearly, and right now the last thing she wanted was to upset her best friend.  They would definitely be talking about this subject later. </p>
<p> </p>

<p>            Credence found his way to the dining hall without much difficulty.  Following groups of other hungry students made it so much easier on him.  Walking into the large room however was difficult.  The crowds, the food, and smells were overwhelming for Credence.  He could feel sweat prickle at the back of his neck.  There was a part of him that wanted to turn around and flee back to the dorms, and at the same time, there was another part of him that wondered if he would even be able to find the dorms again. </p>
<p>            Stepping through the door Credence looked around at each table that was scattered through the room.  It was a far different place than what he’d pictured.  While still formal to some extent, the teachers were still able to mingle with students; the headmistress was the only one who stood away from the rest of the students.  Her eyes were carefully watching every student that entered the dining hall.  Tables were filled with plates of food, so many things to choose from.  Credence was overwhelmed with options when all his life he’d only ever been given the choice of soup or nothing.  Sometimes ma would give him bread with his soup, but often he didn’t get that much. </p>
<p>            Spotting a table that was empty Credence ducked his head and walked towards it.  Credence took a seat in hopes that no one would notice him.  Eyes scanning all the food in front of him he barely noticed when two people took up two of the seats at his table.  It wasn’t until one of the girls cleared her throat that Credence almost jumped out of her skin.  “Oh, I’m sorry.  I didn’t realize anyone sat down.”</p>
<p>            Both girls smiled at Credence and waved.  “I’m Queenie, and this is my sister Tina.  I’m a first year like you.  Tina here is a second year.”  The blonde, Queenie, as Credence had figured pointed to the brunette which was her sister.  Credence could see a slight resemblance in the two though if he was being honest Tina seemed far more severe than Queenie. </p>
<p>            “I’m… I’m Credence.  It’s nice to meet you.”  He tried to smile and as usual felt as though it appeared as more than a grimace than anything else.  Eyes moved back to the food in front of him.  He still had a hard time trying to decide what he would choose to eat. </p>
<p>            Just then the three were joined by another student.  Tina looked up and smiled at the dark-haired boy.  Credence had seen him once in passing during the sorting.  Though he had no idea what his name was.  “Tina there you are.  Wondered where you two wandered off too.” </p>
<p>            Queenie looked over at Jacob and smiled.  “Jacob, this is Credence.  He’s a first year also.”  Tina sat up a little straighter.  There was something on edge about her now that Jacob had approached the table and Credence couldn’t put his finger on it.  Reading people wasn’t something that he was ever good at though. </p>
<p>            Jacob turned to Credence and smiled.  “Ah yes, Credence Barebone.  You’re the one that two houses were fighting over.”  He patted Credence on the shoulder, and the young man attempted to hide the flinch as Jacob did so. </p>
<p>            Credence nodded his head and when he looked back his plate was filled with food.  All of it looked wonderful.  Though he wasn’t sure how it all got there, Credence began to eat slowly.  There was the sensible side of him that knew that if he ate too quickly, all the food would revolt against him, even if there was the other part of him that was terrified that someone would take all of the food away if he didn’t eat fast enough.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>            Students ate and chatted.  It was nice to see people in the dining hall having fun again.  The headmistress stood when things started to settle into a dull roar.  “Excuse me everyone may I have your attention.”  She waited for students to turn their attention to the front of the hall.  “I would like to cover some beginning of the year housekeeping if I may.  Most of which you are familiar with if you aren’t a first year.”  Pausing yet again she waited for the teachers to gain the rest of the student’s attention and have it turn to her.  “Tomorrow classes will start for the second through seventh years.  First years you need to report to the nurse’s office for a physical.  This will be for all first years to make sure that every one of you are healthy.  This is also the time when the healers will determine what your classification is.  Whatever it is that you are will be listed on your file.  There are certain medical precautions that need to be taken for students that are alphas and omegas which is why we need to make sure that we know where each of you belongs.”  The talk seemed cold, almost clinical in its delivery and that was really the way that the headmistress meant for it to be carried out.     Most of the students went back to eating and talking amongst each other after that.  Credence sat there dumbfounded.  Questions began to swim in his head.</p>
