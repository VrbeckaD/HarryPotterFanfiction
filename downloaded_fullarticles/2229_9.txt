    <p>32nd of October, 1981</p>
<p>The air was chilly. A feeling that was once peaceful now held relief for most and grief for others. In a small flat in central London, a women sat at a kitchen table. She stared out at the outside world through a opened window. Strands of black hair moved with the motion of the wind. Her emerald green eyes were puffy and dark circles were visible underneath them. Her pale cheeks were streaked with tears. She wore several bandages on her forehead and neck. A scab had formed from a cut on her brow. Bruises were scattered around her body.</p>
<p>"You don't have to do this Liz, "the man sitting next to her spoke and squeezed her hand.</p>
<p>"I should have fought harder Remus. I shouldn't have let Hagrid take him...I shouldn't have let Sirius go. God, what was I thinking, "The women whispered and covered her face with her free hand. The other one gripped Remus's tighter.</p>
<p>Remus sighed and shook his head," Dumbledore believes he's safer in the Muggle World. It wouldn't be right to keep Harry here, given everything that's happened. He'll be safer away from the wizarding community. There are still supp-."</p>
<p>"They'll treat him horribly. I know they will. They won't love him Remus! Petunia always hated the idea of magic, and the things she said to Li-...I should have done more. I could have done more, "The women snapped.</p>
<p>"Elizabeth," Remus spoke soothingly. He was about to continue but a knock at the door made them both stop and look.</p>
<p>"Daddy!" a voice cheered and a little girl came running out of the hall into the living room.</p>
<p>Elizabeth felt a sharp pain rush through her chest. She quickly got up. Remus pulled out his wand and walked to the door. Elizabeth went over to pick the little girl up. She looked so much like her father- Elizabeth thought as she held the little black hair and the same smile. The same eyes. The only sign that she was Elizabeth's was the green in her eyes.</p>
<p>"Ria," Elizabeth spoke, forcing herself to smile at her daughter, her eyes flickered to the door, "I thought I told you to stay in your room and play."</p>
<p>"But someone's at the door. I could be daddy!" Ria exclaimed to her mother.</p>
<p>"Remember how mummy said Daddy was on a long trip, "Elizabeth explained as Remus looked through the small hole in the door looking to see who it was.</p>
<p>"But Daddy never said goodbye," Ria pouted.</p>
<p>Elizabeth looked to see Remus open the door to Kingsley standing outside. She found it difficult to breath. She knew what he had come here to discuss. Elizabeth looked at Remus for help.</p>
<p>Remus nodded and walked over. He took Ria gently and smiled at the little girl.</p>
<p>"I think your mum's going to need to have a word with this gentlemen Miss. Arianna. So why don't we go in your room. You can show me those new books you were telling me about,"Remus smiled talking softly to Ria.</p>
<p>The girl stared at Kingsley for a swore she must be the most astute four year old she had ever seen. Ria seemed to snap out of her suspicions as she smiled. She hugged Remus and looked to her mother, "Mommy, Uncle Remi and I are going to play now while you talk to the scary man!"</p>
<p>Elizabeth sighed in relief as Remus took Ria into the back bed room of the flat. If so many things weren't happening at once Elizabeth would stop to admire how well Remus had come to handle children.</p>
<p>"I thought Remus had left for the north by now," Kingsley spoke as Elizabeth motioned for him to come in.</p>
<p>"He was. But with everything that happened he postponed his departure till after the trial," Elizabeth spoke solemnly.</p>
<p>The trial. The thought made her sick.</p>
<p>She picked her wand up off the counter top and started waving it around. Mugs came out of the cupboard. Cream and sugar floated through the air crossing a kettle that came to sit on the stove top that had lit up. Elizabeth's hand shook from nerves and one of the mugs dropped; shattering to the group. She flinched.</p>
<p>"Let me," Kingsley said gently putting a hand on her shoulder. She looked at him and saw the worry in his eyes. It was the same look everyone had been giving her since she had regained consciousness on the street.</p>
<p>Kingsley waved his wands and in a few minutes they sat at the table sipping tea.</p>
<p>"So…,"Kingsley spoke after a while glancing at Elizabeth.</p>
<p>She starred out at nothing.</p>
<p>"They want me to interrogate him," Elizabeth muttered.</p>
<p>Kingsley took a sharp breath, "The minister's also requested you testify at the trial. Mad Eye says he'll be more likely to talk to you."</p>
<p>Elizabeth fidgeted with the gold band on her left ring finger.</p>
<p>It wasn't fair to ask her to question, let alone testify against her husband.</p>
<p>He left you and Ria.</p>
<p>Elizabeth thought this and tears welled up in her eye. She was never one to cry. But too much had happened not to. She knew logically she could comprehend that it wasn't hard to believe that in one night she lost her best friends, her godson, and her husband. She had seen enough life lost. Enough tragedies happened in her time as an auror to know it was very plausible for someone to lose everything in only twenty four hours.</p>
<p>"We found his remains...peter's that is," Kingsley spoke.</p>
<p>Elizabeth looked at him.</p>
<p>"A finger...that was all that was left," Kingsley spoke as if the thought disgusted him.</p>
<p>Elizabeth opened her mouth.</p>
<p>"I know what you said Liz. I know what you think you saw. But the facts just aren't adding up," Kingsley sighed, "more and more reports of people being death eaters are coming in. Some the ministry never even dared to think would be loyal to You-know-who."</p>
<p>"I think I would no if I was living with a death eater Kingsley," Elizabeth snapped.</p>
<p>"We need a formal interrogation Liz. And he refuses to talk until we tell him if your alright. I know it's hard but it's your job. No one ever said being an Auror was going to be easy and-"</p>
<p>"I'll do it," Elizabeth whispered.</p>
<p>"What?" Kingsley asked having not heard her.</p>
<p>She clenched her fist. He left. He left her and Arianna. She told him not to go after Peter. She begged him not to. And he went. He went anyways. A wave of anger coursed through her body. When she saw him she was going to murder him.</p>
<p>"Schedule the interrogation for five o'clock...I need to make Ria lunch first. I'll be there at five sharp so he'd better be in the interrogation room. Don't bother meeting me there. Leave the file outside the door. If the press are the Kingsley I will hex the first reporter that talks to me," Elizabeth spoke standing," consider this my last assignment. After this... tell Mad eye I quit."</p>
<p>Kingsley stood in shock," Elizabeth you can't be…"</p>
<p>He stopped as she looked at him.</p>
<p>He had grown used to work with Elizabeth. They had worked together since they both joined the ministry. He had grown used to her stubbornness, her quickness. He had even grown used to the fact that he's always be left in awe at her beauty, but would never be able to act on it.</p>
<p>But he had never grown accustomed to the murderous glances she gave every so often. It left him being thankful they were on the same side. He tipped his hat and left without another word.</p>
<p>As promised later on that afternoon, directly at five, Elizabeth apparated into the ministry. She had fixed Ria lunch as she said she would and tucked the girl in for her afternoon nap around four. She left Remus to watch her, who sat reading a book clearly trying to distract himself from his thoughts of what had happened the past few days. They were all still mourning after all.</p>
<p>She expected the rush of ministry guard, younger aurors, to storm towards her as she appeared inside the designated spot for apparition. She quickly pulled her Id out as they reluctantly performed charms to make sure she was who she claimed to be. Though as she watched them she recognized half the wizards and witches as those she had trained over the years. They looked at her nervously.</p>
<p>"Sorry Mrs. Black. Standard protocol, "A blond witch spoke nervously as the team dispersed going back to their stations.</p>
<p>"Nothing to be sorry for Violet," Elizabeth spoke. The girl perked up at Elizabeth remembering her name.</p>
<p>"Good. We were expecting you but we felt it odd to have to run a security scan on a superior. I'm so sorry though. About everything that's happened. I heard the news about the Potters. It's just terrible," Violet spoke.</p>
<p>Elizabeth shuddered at the mention of the Potters.</p>
<p>"I'm er...suppose to escort you to the interrogation room. To keep the press away," Violet spoke after a moment.</p>
<p>"Thank you," Elizabeth muttered as she moved.</p>
<p>Sure enough as they neared the interrogation section of the ministry there was a large group of press waiting outside. Violet was quick to keep them at bay allowing Elizabeth to slip through the door leading to the hall where there were a series of interrogation rooms.</p>
<p>Elizabeth stopped at the very last one where two aurors stood guarding the door.</p>
<p>They stood at attention when they saw Elizabeth.</p>
<p>"So," Elizabeth spoke as she took the file one of the handed her. She quickly turned the first page ignoring the photo. She skimmed the report as they spoke.</p>
<p>"The suspect has been unresponsive. Refuses to talk until...well until he knows if you're alright ma'am. No one's told him you regained consciousness. They detained him before they checked on you,"One of the guards spoke.</p>
<p>"Did they give you Veritaserum?"Elizabeth asked.</p>
<p>"It's there but he refuses to take it. We were going to force him to take it but they told us you would handle things," The other one spoke.</p>
<p>Elizabeth took a deep breath.</p>
<p>"Go ahead and let me in," She spoke. She took out her wand.</p>
<p>"You're dismissed," Elizabeth said as they unlocked the doors.</p>
<p>"But ma'am our orders are too," One began.</p>
<p>"I don't care. Your new orders are that you are dismissed. Go wait outside."</p>
<p>"But if he attacks you," The other of protested.</p>
<p>She laughed and she opened the door.</p>
<p>"You should be more worried about leaving him with me,"She spoke and walked inside.</p>
<p>The room was dimly lit. Elizabeth's gaze fell on the man in the center. He was looking at the ground and didn't look up when she closed the door. She took in his appearance. Elizabeth remembered when he left he had given her his dragonskin jacket. He had walked away wearing only a thin white dress shirt and black trousers. His black hair was matted down to his face from sweat. Dirt covered his face. His shirt was torn and covered with dust. Elizabeth noted the bruises and cuts on his exposed skin still bleeding. No one had treated them yet. The mental note to change that was tucked in the back of her mind. She caught herself thinking even though he looked like hell he was still as handsome as ever. She cursed inwardly. She stepped farther into the room. He still wouldn't look up even when she came to stand in front of him and pulled the chair away.</p>
<p>"I won't talk,"He suddenly spoke his voice hoarse,"not until you tell me about Elizabeth."</p>
<p>There was a loud thwack as Elizabeth hand met with Sirius's cheek. She slapped him once. Then twice. And then several other times. Until she froze as she saw blood drip down his cheek. She looked at her ring which was bloody. She had cut him. She looked away and was met with his stare. She saw the relief and the pain in his eyes. She saw that he'd been crying.</p>
<p>In that moment Elizabeth had the urge to kiss him. To drown herself in her husbands embrace. Wishing that they were home with each other, mourning the loss of their friends. Together. Rather than separated by a metal table. By his mistakes.</p>
<p>"I deserve that," He mumbled as his cheek started to welt.</p>
<p>"Open your mouth," Elizabeth spoke cooley as she opened the vile of potion that sat on the table.</p>
<p>He looked at her as if she might as well have slapped him again at that statement.</p>
<p>"You don't trust me?" He spoke.</p>
<p>Elizabeth glared at him.</p>
<p>"No," she said.</p>
<p>"Liz...please," He whispered.</p>
<p>"Shut up and take the potion!" She yelled.</p>
<p>He paused, then opened his mouth.</p>
<p>She help the potion to his lips and he drank it. She moved to pull her hand away but not before he could kiss her finger tips.</p>
<p>In a quick movement she slapped him again.</p>
<p>"You've lost the right to touch me," She spoke. Her voice quivered as she held her fingers.</p>
<p>"I love you," was all he said.</p>
<p>She wanted to call him a liar. But she knew she couldn't say that. The potion kept him from lying.</p>
<p>She looked at him. 'Then why are we here', she said with her eyes.</p>
<p>He seemed to understand as he looked away in shame.</p>
<p>Elizabeth sighed and sat down. "Sirius black. Did you or did you not inform Lord Voldemort of the location of the Potter's hiding place?"</p>
<p>He turned his head back to stare at her. She knew he wanted to argue. She shook her head.</p>
<p>"No," Sirius spat looking at her angrily.</p>
<p>"Did you pursue the boy named Peter Pettigrew with the intent to murder him?" Elizabeth asked looking straight at him.</p>
<p>Sirius let out a sigh, "Yes."</p>
<p>"Did you assault the auror Elizabeth Farewell using a stunning spell," She asked.</p>
<p>Sirius stared at her again, "No."</p>
<p>Elizabeth knew he wasn't the one who had stunned her. She knew it was Peter. Maybe now they'd believe her. But in her heart she knew. Knew they hadn't understood how Elizabeth got knocked out from such a simple spell. They couldn't believe that she hadn't deflected it. There was no way that she could have been so shocked by the mousey boy she had grown to care for over the years raising a wand to her that she couldn't react in time.</p>
<p>"Did you kill Peter Pettigrew, "Elizabeth spoke after a moment.</p>
<p>She dreaded his answer. Those who saw him said he did. Elizabeth had seen none of it. But she couldn't believe he would try to kill Peter. Sirius was many things. Arrogant, foolish, thick-headed. But not a murderer.</p>
<p>"I did try too, "Sirius spoke.</p>
<p>Elizabeth held her breath. No.</p>
<p>"I tried to. I wanted to. But I couldn't bring myself to do it. I couldn't kill him Liz...he was my friend. Then he created an explosion. I saw him hex his finger off and then transform. Liz you have to believe me i'd-"Sirius stopped but Elizabeth stopped him.</p>
<p>"Enough," She spoke.</p>
<p>Elizabeth pulled an empty vile out of her pocket. She had asked the questions she was told to ask. She pointed her wand to her ear and closing her eyes let strands of wispy white mist leave from her ear. Memories. She then placed them in a vile. She closed them and stood without a word. She turned to leave.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry."</p>
<p>It was faint but it made her spin on her heels. She slammed her hand on the table feeling the metal burn on her hands.</p>
<p>"Why the hell did you go! Why the hell did you go after him!"Elizabeth screamed. She couldn't help it. Tears started falling down her face.</p>
<p>"He told them Liz. Peter sold out Lily and James! He told Vol-"Sirius began.</p>
<p>"Don't say his name," Elizabeth winced.</p>
<p>"He's the reason they're dead," Sirius yelled.</p>
<p>She saw the sadness and anger in his eyes that reflected her own.</p>
<p>"What about Ria," Elizabeth whispered.</p>
<p>Pain filled Sirius's eye replacing his anger.</p>
<p>"You left her...you left me…"Elizabeth cried.</p>
<p>He leaned forward as much as he could so their foreheads were touching. Elizabeth shuddered but didn't move. He didn't speak. He didn't make excuses. All he did was try to make her understand how sorry he was.</p>
<p>"I'll never forgive you," She lips brushed against each other.</p>
<p>"I'm so sorry…"He mumbled against her lips. She kissed him. Hard. Trying to engrain the memory in her mind knowing that this might be the last time she'd ever kiss him.</p>
<p>There was so much history between them. So much left unsaid.</p>
<p>They pulled away.</p>
<p>"You always were better than fire whiskey," She muttered. He laughed.</p>
<p>"Well I do my best darling," He cooed. For a split second it was as if nothing had changed.</p>
<p>He was still the handsome, charming, sassy Gryffindor boy and she was the cool, elegant, headstrong Slytherin girl.</p>
<p>But when Elizabeth yanked her moon shaped necklace off her neck. A wedding gift from the Potters. When she replaced the moon pendant with her wedding band and placed it around Sirius's neck. That brief moment was over.</p>
<p>"Remember the family you left behind. Don't let them change you….and one day...you'd better come back to me," Elizabeth whispered. Kissed him one last time. And left.</p>
