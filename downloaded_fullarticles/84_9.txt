    <p>Harry Potter was sitting in his bedroom at No. 4 Privet Drive, with his owl Hedwig and all of his newly acquired school books, quills and potions vials.  He had gone to Diagon Alley with Hagrid, who acted as though there was nothing wrong with him – and Harry was fine with that. </p><p>Harry had taken hold of the man’s large heavy coat and was practically dragged around the Alley, acting the part of an all-seeing boy. However, harry had been thoroughly put out at not being able to see anything with his own eyes.  </p><p>Being blind was a nightmare to Harry and it was thanks to the Dursley's that he couldn't see anything.  They had hit him about the head so much over the years, that blindness became the result.  He didn't know what to do.  </p><p>Today was the first of September and he should've gotten on the Hogwarts Express this morning at eleven a.m.  But how could he, when he was blind and no-one would help him?  So, he was stuck at Privet Drive with no way of getting to school.  Hedwig hooted softly from her cage, in the corner by his bedroom window.   </p><p>Harry got up and, by his senses and following the cooing hoots that his owl made when he was walking in the right direction, along with stopping suddenly at Hedwig’s sharp little screeches when he was about to walk into something, he managed the few steps over to her.<br/>
He fumbled about opening the cage door, but did eventually get it open.  Then he held out his arms, moved to his right, feeling as he went for the edges of his desk.  </p><p>Once there, Harry felt for a piece of paper and a pencil.  Both the paper and pencil were scooted over to him via Hedwig.<br/>
The paper wasn’t much, just a mere scrap, but harry felt it was enough.</p><p>'Thanks, Hedwig.'<br/>
With the pencil in hand, he started to write a short distorted note: </p><p> </p><p>U N A B L E  T O  G ET   T O SC  HOOL  HEL P<br/>
H a rry  Po tt er</p><p> </p><p>Harry then picked up the note and held it in his hand.<br/>
'Could you take this, Hedwig? To Hogwarts? And give it to the first person you find?' </p><p>Hedwig hooted once, before taking the note in her beak and hopping up onto the window sill.  The window was already open, due to it being so hot.<br/>
As Hedwig flew off, Harry felt his way back to his bed stumbling once or twice, hoping that someone would get his message and come to help him.</p>
