    <p>Saneone was no Jedi, and he was grateful.  He’d worked with them for five years, especially following the two Generals who headed up the GAR’s Search and Rescue battalion and had never once wished for any of the seeming benefits of the Force.  Watching Kara throw herself onto, off of, and around ambushes, or Jaran’s habit of staring at him before reminding him that Saneone was, in fact, trained for this, just tell him where to go, and Saneone was content with keeping his batchmates under control and keeping his brothers alive.</p>
<p>No one talked about the night he’d confirmed Chip was CT-798.  The recycler droids on the <em>Retrieval</em> had beeped in dismay at the sight of him up until the day the old ship had been destroyed in battle.</p>
<p>So finding the tiny, green eyed child hidden in the wall of a Jedi hide out had been the result of planning, of grid searches and an awareness of people.  The Jedi hiding here had been protecting this area for a reason.  Saneone’s job was to find the reason.</p>
<p>A child, tiny and silent, green eyes wide with terror, wasn’t entirely what he’d expected, but entirely unsurprising.  The Jedi would defend an innocent no matter the cost, a trick that had cost so many of them in the war.</p>
<p>“Sir,” Chaos said quietly.</p>
<p>“Got a kid,” Saneone replied shortly, pulling his helmet off as he knelt down.  “Better get the General.”</p>
<p>“On it,” Chaos said.</p>
<p>Saneone carefully pulled off one of his gloves so that he could coax the little one out of his hiding space.  “Hey there,” Saneone said gently, “come on, ad’ika, come on out.”</p>
<p>The little boy drew back for a moment, sniffled, then threw himself forward and into Saneone’s chest.  Saneone caught him carefully, making sure he didn’t actually collide with his armor too hard as the little boy began to cry.</p>
<p>“It’s okay,” Saneone said, shifting so he could stand up as footsteps heralded the arrival of the General.  “It’s okay, ad’ika.  I got you.”</p>
<p>“Commander,” Kara Saje said as she approached from the side.</p>
<p>“Found a kid,” Saneone said as he rocked back and forth, cradling the head of the child.</p>
<p>“I see,” Kara Saje said, looking thoughtful.  She reached out carefully, and Saneone glanced over at the sharp intake of break.</p>
<p>For a long moment, Kara Saje’s eyes were wide, pupils blown incredibly large, before they dilated, and then she blinked, and they were normal.</p>
<p>“Sir?”  Saneone said.</p>
<p>Kara Saje blinked a few more times, then glanced up with him with a hummed inquiry.</p>
<p>“Are you all right sir?”  Saneone pressed.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Kara Saje said slowly, “he’s Force sensitive, Saneone, and alone.  There’s, I, I need to speak with Master Plo Koon.  Can you keep an eye on him for now?”</p>
<p>“Yes sir,” Saneone said.</p>
<p>“Thank you,” Kara Saje said, “if we’ve cleared this building, we should go.  Whoever was hunting them may not be as far away as we’d like.”</p>
<p>Saneone took the boy out, letting Imp grab his bucket as they went.  By the time they were back on the freighter, the boy had fallen asleep, probably having cried himself out.</p>
<p>“What do we call him?”  Chaos asked as Imp and Mischief went up to get the ship ready to go.</p>
<p>“He probably already has a name,” Saneone replied, and nodded, “hand me one of the emergency blankets.”</p>
<p>Mayhem brought it over and helped Saneone bundled the kid up warmly.</p>
<p>“Sane,” Mayhem said, sitting beside him as the two squads and the general entered the ship, “Are we keeping him?”</p>
<p>Saneone looked at the sleeping boy, noting that his skin was almost as dark as Saneone’s hand, or any of his brothers for that matter.  The hair, well, not many of his brothers wore their hair long so he couldn’t say if the unruly mess was similar, but there was something.</p>
<p>“Maybe,” Saneone said, glancing up at Mayhem, “Maybe I will.”</p>
<p>“Maybe we will, vod,” Chaos said, bumping his other shoulder gently.  “You’re not getting rid of us that easily.”</p>
<p>Five years of war, the aftermath of a Sith’s genocide, and Saneone smiled, “No I’m really not, am I?”</p>
<p align="center">/././.\.\.\</p>
<p>Letting Doctor Val and Master Healer Saje take the boy when they got back to the refuge was difficult.  Saneone had held him all through the flight, letting the boy sleep quietly while Kara Saje and her people moved around them.  Kara Saje had twice come by to look at the boy before disappearing with her data pad, but whatever it was she drew, Saneone did not know.</p>
<p>“Commander,” Kara Saje said.</p>
<p>“Sir?”  Saneone replied.</p>
<p>“Bring the boy up to the Council when he’s released from medical, please,” Kara Saje said, then hesitated, “I’m not, I’m not being too forward, am I?  I mean, it seemed like you’d take him.”</p>
<p>Saneone smiled, “I would be honored, General.  The others will help, of course.”</p>
<p>“Of course,” Kara Saje said.  “Then bring him up to the Council and we’ll discuss some things.”</p>
<p>“Yes sir,” Saneone said, and went to find his charge, he could hear him start to scream as the healers entered the medical building.</p>
<p>After leaving medical and having changed into his officer’s uniform, Saneone carried the boy up to the newly completed Council building.  Kara Saje was waiting in the hall for him, speaking quietly to Chip.</p>
<p>The Padawan Clone was seventeen now and starting to look more like his brothers, although he was still shorter than most of them, a fact which Saneone knew he was teased about frequently.  It wouldn’t be too much longer before the other survivors at the refuge really began questioning Chip’s parentage, and the truth would have to come out, as unusual as it was.</p>
<p>“Saneone,” Chip said, prompting Kara Saje to turn.  “How’s the boy?”</p>
<p>“Healthy,” Saneone replied.  “General.”</p>
<p>“Let’s go in,” Kara Saje said, “Chip, wait out here.”</p>
<p>“Yes ma’am,” Chip said with a half-bow.</p>
<p>Saneone followed Kara Saje into the Council’s receiving room, pausing long enough to take in the people waiting for him.</p>
<p>Master Plo Koon he had expected, given Kara Saje’s earlier comments, and Master Quinlan Vos was another he’d anticipated, although the man’s pinched expression proved that <em>he</em> hadn’t wanted to be there.  As they walked closer, Saneone also noted that Master Vos’s eyes were bloodshot, so that expression probably meant the man had been drinking again.  Waiting behind him was his padawan, Sophia Wight, who looked as sad as her master, if slightly less hungover.  Some memory of Aayla Secura then, an anniversary of some sort.</p>
<p>Also waiting for them was Master Sarisa, the Twi’lek healer was eyeing Master Vos with a combination of sympathy and calculation, as if she respected his grief but was definitely planning something for his hangover.</p>
<p>“Commander Saneone,” Master Plo Koon said, calling the room’s attention.</p>
<p>“Master Plo Koon,” Saneone replied, freeing a hand to salute him.</p>
<p>“This is the boy?”  Master Plo Koon asked.</p>
<p>“Yes sir,” Saneone said, shifting the boy as a distraction from the sarcastic comment that itched to be made.</p>
<p>“Kara has provided us with the outcome of her visions regarding the boy, and we’ve all meditated more on the matter,” Master Plo Koon said after a moment.  “The boy is Force Sensitive, but he is, more than that.  His destiny is unusual, but what he needs most, the reason we have seen for his presence here, is that he needs family more.  Kara indicated you were willing to take care of the boy.”</p>
<p>Saneone made himself relax when the boy started to shift a little, “I do.  I don’t care what destiny he has.  Family matters more.”</p>
<p>“Then he is yours,” Master Quinlan said quietly.</p>
<p>“Our visions showed us a name,” Master Sarisa said, her voice just loud enough that Quinlan flinched.  “Would you care to know it?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know if it will stay his name,” Saneone said, “I imagine we’ll find one that suits better, but we’ll have to call him something until then.”</p>
<p>“His name is Harry Potter.”</p>
