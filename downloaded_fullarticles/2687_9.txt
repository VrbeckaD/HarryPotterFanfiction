    <p>“Are you sure about this?” the young redheaded woman questioned, for what must have been the fiftieth time that night.</p><p>Her emerald green eyes darted between the two young men sitting on the loveseat across from her. One had pale brown hair and a scarred face, and the other had jaw length black hair, the edge of a black tattoo could be seen peeking out of the collar of his shirt.</p><p>“We know the two of you have been trying, and we just thought we’d offer,” the scarred young man stated timidly.</p><p>The red haired young woman glanced sideways at her husband.</p><p>Her husband sent her a small smile and squeezed her hand in support. “It’s my fault, I don’t think I can. You all know my parents had a hard time having me.”</p><p>“We don’t know that for sure,” the red haired young woman murmured.</p><p>“I know,” her husband muttered.</p><p>“You’ll make great parents,” the scarred young man broke in, and glanced to his companion on the loveseat. “And we were even able to get a vial of the Familia Sanguini. Right?”</p><p>“Yeah,” the black haired young man mumbled, speaking up for the first time since their arrival. He had maintained a slumped and morose position for most of the night. </p><p>“All right, if you’re sure about this then we’d love to. Thank you both so much for this gift,” tears formed in the redheaded young woman’s eyes.</p><p>“We won’t let you down,” her husband smiled.</p><p>They spoke for a little longer to figure out the details before the two young men said their goodbyes. They left the home of the young couple behind.</p><p>“I’m glad they agreed,” the scarred young man whispered to the black haired young man, appearing as if he was trying to convince himself.</p><p>“Right, yeah,” the black haired young man scuffed the ground with one of his big black boots.</p><p>“Sirius, we talked about this. You agreed. This is for the best,” there was a touch of pleading in the scarred young man’s voice.</p><p>The black haired young man, Sirius, didn’t respond. His storm gray eyes remained fixed on the ground.</p><p>“We know them. They will love the baby unconditionally, and raise them to be a great person. The baby will have a great life with them.”</p><p>“We could too,” Sirius muttered.</p><p>“Maybe, but you can’t honestly say we’re prepared for something like this. Lily and James, they have a home, steady jobs, and… they’re happily married. We’re not even together.”</p><p>Sirius flinched at the last comment. “I know, Moony, I messed up. It didn’t mean… I’m sor—”</p><p>“We were never together so there’s nothing to apologize for. We’re just friends,” the scarred young man, Moony, cut Sirius off.</p><p>Sirius swallowed looking utterly guilty and miserable.</p><p>“But that doesn’t matter. What truly matters is the chance of the baby inheriting my furry little problem.”</p><p>“I don’t care about that,” Sirius insisted.</p><p>“I do! I can’t condemn my child to being a werewolf if there’s a chance to save them from it. This is the baby’s best chance not to get it,” Moony straightened his shoulders, and took a deep breath.</p><p>Sirius’s shoulders slumped in defeat. “You’re right.”  </p><p>“I know,” but Sirius missed the look of uncertainty that flickered across Moony’s features.</p><p>“Owl or Floo me if you need anything,” Sirius insisted.</p><p>“I will,” Moony nodded.</p><p>The two young men went their separate ways.</p>
