    <p><strong> <u>Disclaimer</u> </strong> <strong>:  I don’t own it, and I am making no money off of it.  </strong></p><p><strong> <u>AN</u> </strong> <strong>:  This story takes place after the Final Battle by several years.  It’s AU and EWE.  Alastor Moody did not die.  Also, Tonks was never with Remus.  There’s a mention of another couple, Hermione/Kingsley, as well.  It’s rated mature for language and a non-explicit, first-time lemon that includes a person with an artificial leg (do I really need to warn about that?).</strong></p><p>            It was strange, but not in any way disagreeable, to be alive.</p><p>            Alastor Moody was still tempted to doubt himself and to believe that this was all some convoluted magic spell, and he was actually lying, quite dead, on the killing field of the Final Battle.</p><p>            But the Final Battle had not been nearly as much of a killing field as anyone had expected, thanks to Potter, the Longbottom boy, the defecting Malfoys, and Severus Snape.  The only losses had been the Dark Lord and his loyal Death Eaters.</p><p>            If Moody had believed in miracles, he would have been tempted to call it that. </p><p>            However, even more unfathomable was the fact that none other than Nymphadora Tonks was walking, clearly under the influence of an anti-tripping charm, down the hall of his flat.  Her smile was shy but enticing at the same time.  She had obviously yielded some control to her Black blood. </p><p>            Over the course of Tonk’s auror training, service, and the war, Alastor had resisted his feelings for her with every bit of will he had in him.  But trying to put distance between them had been useless.  Every time, she had fought her way back to his side.  For the last months of the war, they’d had precious few moments to sleep, but whenever they had, Tonks had found her way into his arms.  He had protested, of course, to no avail since she was never awake long enough to listen to his tirades.  Finally, Alastor let it be, reasoning that they were both fully clothed, and at least he could more easily protect her if she was in his bed.</p><p>            Neither of them had expected to survive the war.  But now, they were preparing to attend the Minister’s great idea.  Kingsley was calling it a ball, though seeing as how he had encouraged everyone to wear “something more casual than stuffy, formal robes” (a directive that had raised more than a few pureblood eyebrows and sent many people into muggle London for new clothes), Alastor suspected that it was intended more as a no-holds barred wild party.  Kingsley knew that wizarding England was still seething with lingering tension, and giving everyone a chance to let their hair down seemed like an excellent solution.  But wild parties had never been to Alastor’s taste, and he would have been tempted not to attend at all. </p><p>            However, he found himself with one petite, pink haired, decidedly female objection to that idea, and she was rousing interest in parts of himself that he had ruthlessly repressed into oblivion.  When she’d asked him to escort her, what could he do but agree?  He’d even gone so far as to let her pick his clothes for the party, and he had to admit that the black jeans and blue silk shirt made the most of what marginally acceptable looks he had.</p><p>            “What do you think, Alastor?” Tonks asked, twirling around in front of him as he watched her and admitted that he was far past the point where he could look at her chastely.  Tonks looked anything but chaste now, more like a siren than an angel in a sliver of silver silk that covered more than most of the other women’s outfits would but left far too much of her bared to prying eyes…except his own, of course.</p><p>            Merlin’s balls, he had no idea what it was she saw in him.  But she had given herself over to him, and he was past the point of letting her go.</p><p>            He was alive.  She was alive.  And they were going to cross so many lines tonight.</p>
