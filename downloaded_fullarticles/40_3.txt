    <p>Your head was throbbing but it wasn’t as bothersome as your ringing ears and blurry vision. Squinting your eyes, you try to blink through the blurriness but only succeed in making it worse. Waving your hands around, you try and feel your surroundings, finally feeling a wall behind you. Cautiously leaning back against it, you slide down to the floor and cradle your head. <em> If only I hadn’t drank half a bottle of wine….and maybe two more cups. </em> You bitterly thought, grimacing at your own stupidity. Blinking your eyes, your vision starts to clear and you finally take in your surroundings. You’re in a hallway with tall stone walls and elegant archways. You can barely make out a distant wall lamp but it’s obvious that it's nighttime here as well from how quiet it is. Reaching a hand out towards the wall, you shakily stand up and try to get the feeling back into your legs. <em> Welp, it’s now or never! Time to face your fate. </em>Quietly chuckling to yourself, you move from the wall and continue down the hallway towards the lamp. </p><p><em> <br/>It looks and feels like a castle. </em> You wonder, cringing at how loud your heels sound in the ancient place. Finally reaching the lamp, you see there’s a corner beyond it. Nibbling your bottom lip in decision, you quietly walk towards the corner and peek your head around. You can barely make out anything in the darker hallway. <em> Shit, just my luck. Whatever, fuck it! </em> Shaking your head, you move from around the corner when you suddenly freeze. <em> Your spidey senses are tingling. </em>Suddenly hearing the thudding footsteps from behind, that are quickly getting closer, you freeze like an idiot. Feeling your hair stand on end, you squint your eyes shut and await your inevitable death. </p><p> </p><p>A large hand suddenly grabs your arm and shoves you backwards into the wall. <em> Holy shit, this is where I die. </em> Eyes wide, you stare back into pitch black eyes, darker than you’ve ever thought possible. That are also glaring at you, quite angrily, might you add. Inwardly shaking your head, you take in the figure in front of you. Almost craning your head to look up at the tall figure, you can make out pale skin, shoulder length black hair, mouth set in a scowl and a large hook nose. <em> Don’t forget the beady looking eyes! </em>Your eyes widening even further, your breath catches in your throat when his other hand rises up and suddenly there’s even more light in your eyes than you can handle. Rapidly blinking, you squint your eyes angrily back at him. From your peripheral, you can make out that it’s a stick that is producing the light in his hand. </p><p> </p><p>“Well, well, well, what do I have here? What are you doing here? No, better yet. How did you get here? You can’t apparate into Hogwarts, so explain.”</p><p> </p><p>Then came the sudden abundance of questions from a deep soft voice, <em> a sexy deep soft voice, </em>you coyly think. Slightly shivering at the voice, you rake your brain for a response. </p><p> </p><p>“I...uhm, well, I…. actually don’t know how I got here. I don’t even know where here is.”</p><p> </p><p>You settle with, before his words start sinking in. Hogwarts….<em> Hogwarts….Hogwartsssssss!!!!!!! Holy, fuck me, yes! Can it be?! Oh shit, oh shit! Yes! Wait… Black hair, kinda greasy looking now with the light. Black eyes. Permanent scowl. </em> Glancing down quickly at his clothes, <em> bat like cape! Dungeon bat! Snape! Severus Snape! Oh fuck! He’s gonna kill me! </em>Your inner monologue ends when he grips your arm harder and shakes you. He practically growls at you,</p><p> </p><p>”Answer me, you bloody dunder….”</p><p> </p><p>“Wait! Wait! You’re Severus Snape! Professor Snape! Holy shit! Wait!.... Dumbledore! Where is he? Take me to him! Please! I need to see him!”</p><p> </p><p>You interrupt him, raising your hands towards his arms and grabbing them. Slightly shaking him, you joyfully look up at him. His scowl turns into a snarl as he suddenly grips the collar of your turtleneck and brings your face closer to his. On your tiptoes, you grimace at the rough manhandling. <em> It’s kinda hot though…. </em> Eyes widening and blush heating your cheeks, you fight the urge to rub your chest against his. <em> No! This is Snape! Get a hold of yourself!  </em></p><p> </p><p>“And what makes you think, I’ll follow a dwarfs orders? Hmm, I decide whether to bring you or not.”</p><p> </p><p>“I,..I need to talk to him. I think he can figure out why or how I got here. He’s got to know! And fuck you, I’m not that short! Let me go!” </p><p> </p><p>You angrily tell him, glaring at him. He silently stares at you, glare deepening as he thinks. You can feel a slight flutter in your mind as he stares into your eyes but it’s gone before you can begin questioning it. Suddenly letting go of your collar, you fall back onto your heels and you quickly grab onto anything to stabilize yourself. Reaching for his arms again, you manage to set your heels firmly onto the ground. Quickly glancing at where your hands landed, you yank your hands back and hastily step back further into the wall. He smirks at you in malicious joy and begins walking down the hallways. Hurriedly catching up to him, you follow him up towards a set of stairs. Furrowing your brows and clenching your jaw, you begin your journey up the stairs of hell. <em> Out of all the fucking days to wear heels!.... Well, at least they’re slightly thick. </em>Grimacing, you begin praying that God smiles down at you and doesn’t let you fall or worse, break your ankle.</p><p> </p><p>Finally reaching the landing, you exhale in relief and walk behind towards a statue of a gargoyle. You hear him mutter something at the statue and suddenly it’s moving and you can see even more infernal stairs. Disdainfully staring at them, you quickly step on and wait for the statue to stop rotating. Feeling it stop, you glance at the statue and then back down at the stairs. <em> I wonder how Harry or Hermione felt the first time. </em> Stepping onto the landing, you almost bump into Snape but catch yourself in time. Opening the door, you excitedly take in Dumbledore’s office. <em> Looks exactly like the movie. </em>Spotting Dumbledore behind his desk, munching on lemon drops, no doubt, he stands up when he sees Snape . </p><p> </p><p>“Ah, Severus. Good to see you! What are you doing here, my boy? And who is this young lady? Hello, I’m Albus Dumbledore. The Headmaster of Hogwarts. Welcome!”</p><p> </p><p>He says, walking up to you with his hand extended. Reaching your hand out, he grasps it with both hands and pats it, smiling at you. Smiling widely back at him, you begin introducing yourself.</p><p> </p><p>“Hello, Dumbledore! I’m ….”</p><p> </p><p>“I found this intruder on the ground floor by the courtyard where I was doing rounds. She just appeared in the hallway! Apparated! Which is impossible, since nobody but you can apparate in and out of Hogwarts! She’s probably here to spy! Why else would…..”</p><p> </p><p>“Severus, my boy, how about we let her explain. Come now, sit and tell me how it is that you just appeared here.”</p><p> </p><p>Albus interrupts Snape, pulling you along to a set of chairs in front of his desk. Patting Snape on the shoulder, he gestures for him to sit down also. Glaring at you, he yanks the chair away and firmly sits down. Dumbledore smiles in amusement and sits down. Rejecting his gesture at the lemon candy, you begin your introduction again. Glaring at Snape first before starting.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m Y/N Y/L/N. I honestly don’t know how I got here. It should be impossible because I know nobody can apparate into Hogwarts. Especially somebody who doesn’t have magic. Magic doesn’t even exist where I come from, hell, you guys are characters from a fantasy book. You aren’t real in my world! So I have no idea how I got here! The last thing I remember was getting home from a night out and drinking wine and then it all blacks out. I don’t remember anything else.”</p><p> </p><p>The word vomit spills from your mouth and you finally inhale and exhale in exhaustion. Hoping they believe you, you glance back and forth at them. Snape looks like he far from believes you. Shocking, not shocking. Dumbledore is looking at you with contemplation across his features but you can see the infamous twinkle forming in his eyes.</p><p> </p><p>Groaning internally, you hope that the old man doesn’t start getting ideas. Rubbing your temples, you try to ignore your pounding head. Glancing around the room, you search for a clock. <em> 3:24 am. Fuck, no wonder </em>. You blearily stare at the men, wondering if you’ll come off as rude for interrupting their thinking to ask for a shower and a bed. </p><p> </p><p>Snape still has his usual glare except he’s now rubbing his bottom lip with his fingers with an unusual expression across his face. </p><p> </p><p>“Aha! Yes, I think I may have a theory but it is only that for the meantime, I’m afraid. You seem to have come from an alternative universe, as you mentioned we are just characters in a book. But you fell into a sort of, shall we say, time paradox. Although from an alternative universe, I feel that it should be impossible but we have magic here so it might not be so impossible.” Dumbledore says, his delighted expression almost blinding you. Although the second he stops explaining, Snape sharply stands up and slams his palms down onto the desk.</p><p> </p><p>“Ri-di-cu-lous! And impossible! There’s no such thing as an alternative universe! She’s playing us for fools! This bloody inept cretin, shouldn’t even be able to see Hogwarts. Headmaster, you can’t honestly believe this liar!?” Snape hisses the last words at you, turning his head pointedly towards you with his teeth bared.</p><p> </p><p>“Severus! Calm yourself! That’s the only possible explanation we have for the time being. We could always continue searching for more theories but my opinion stands. And so, since it is very late, we shall head to bed. Miss Y/L/N, seeing as you are not a student nor a professor, I should think that you staying in the dungeons is our best guess. Severus, my boy, the girl shall retire in your chambers so that you may be there first in case an emergency occurs. You will find that you have another bedchamber, which is where Y/N will stay for however long. Are you in agreement?” Dumbledore says, amusingly waiting for Snape’s outburst at the order.</p><p> </p><p>With a hand over your mouth preventing your laughter from escaping, you stare at Snape. His face seems to have gone paler but also gain color with the slight blush across his cheekbones. Though his eyes seem to penetrate your very soul with the indignant fury in them. A chuckle sneaking through your fingers is what finally makes him snap. </p><p> </p><p>“HOW CAN YOU ASK ME TO BRING THIS BLOODY DWARF WOMAN TO MY ROOMS!? THIS CASTLE IS PLENTY BIG ENOUGH, JUST CONJURE UP A ROOM FOR HER SOMEWHERE ELSE! I DON’T HAVE TIME TO BABYSIT THE STUDENTS MUCH LESS AN INTRUDER! NOT TO MENTION ALSO INAPPROPRIATE!” </p><p> </p><p>Snape finally roars at the two of you, salvia practically spitting from his mouth at the sudden violent eruption of words. Cringing back away from the onslaught, you blearily glance at Dumbledore, waiting for his response. Dumbledore sighs and rubs his forehead before leaning back onto his chair and bluntly states,</p><p> </p><p>“I’m afraid that is the only option we have, my boy. I cannot allow her to stay in another room in fear of what may happen to her, especially if she is a muggle. That of which we are not quite sure of as of yet. And if to say, she is a witch, it is even more prudent to have you near here, in case her magic decides to show itself. She will stay in your chambers indefinitely and that is final. Goodnight, my dear. Goodnight Severus.”</p><p> </p><p>Dumbledore warily stands up, giving you a gentle smile but throwing a glare at Severus as he walks towards the stairs leading up to his chambers. Hearing the door thud shut, you inhale and exhale in preparation to speak. Turning towards Severus, you stand up and tell him,</p><p> </p><p>“Look all I want right now is to take a shower and then sleep. I don’t really want to fight with you and so if you could stop being a dick for one night, I would greatly appreciate it. You can go back to hating me tomorrow but for god's sake man, let me sleep first.” </p><p> </p><p>You wait for his response. Staring at him as he seems to compose himself and close off his facial expressions, he glares back at you. Abruptly he turns around and walks out of the office, practically running down the stairs of the gargoyle. You jog after him, trying to keep up with him and not lose sight of him. </p>
