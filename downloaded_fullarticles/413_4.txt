    <p>Sitting in the compartment on the train with Severus Snape, Regulus Black, and Evan Rosier, Aurora Malfoy stared out the window as the boys were going on about their plans for Hogwart's this year. But Aurora could not help but think of the war that was wreaking havoc on their world, and how the four of them would be considered to be on the wrong side of the war by most. </p><p>"Hey, are you okay?" Regulus asked nudging her shoulder.</p><p>"Yeah, just thinking," Aurora said giving Regulus a tight lip smile.</p><p>"That is a dangerous habit of yours Malfoy," Evan snickered across from her. While Severus just rolled his eyes and turned his attention to the book on his lap.</p><p>"At least I think before I speak. You're out here bringing shame to Slytherin with every idiotic thought that comes to your head, Rosier," Aurora fired back with a teasing smirk. </p><p>"Aw don't be like that darling, you know you love me, my dear Aurora," Evan said with an over-exaggerated wink at the end.</p><p>"In your dreams Rosier."</p><p>"Only every night when I close my eyes."</p><p>"Well, you can continue dreaming because its never gonna happen," Aurora rolled her eyes and added, "I'm going to go change before Rosier makes to big of a fool of himself before we even reach the school."</p><p>Moving to grab her bag from the overhead, Aurora chose to ignore the friendly bickering that started between Rosier and Black. Once she finally got her bag down she opened the compartment door and made her way to the girl's laboratory on the train. Passing all the other compartments on the train she glanced in seeing the familiar faces from different houses. After the school year ended they would all be on different sides of this war and they weren't all going to survive the years to come. Some of them at least had a choice on what side of the war they fought on unlike her. She had no choice if she did not want to be disowned by her father and mother. If one thing was clear it was the fact that she would marry a respectable pureblood who had the same beliefs as her family, soon after graduation and create heirs for his family. </p><p>Shaking her head from those thoughts she entered the laboratory and went into one of the stalls and quickly changed into her uniform. With her Prefect badge pinned neatly on her robe near the Slytherin crest. Hearing the laboratory door open she put her home clothes into her bag and left the stall to go look into the mirror. And there stood Lily Evans fixing her hair.</p><p>"Evans," Aurora said curtly as she moved to stand next to her to fix her robes before she left.</p><p>"Malfoy," the redhead witch responded back cautiously to the Slytherin. Aurora might have never been outright cruel to her as other Slytherins, but she was still a pure-blood that has been known to look down at muggle-borns.</p><p>"Congratulations on making Head-girl, you deserve it."</p><p>"What?" Lily looked at the witch with wide green eyes.</p><p>"I'm not going to say it again if that's what you are looking for," Aurora replied not even looking at Evans. Putting the last piece of her white-blonde hair into place and made the move to leave the laboratory. </p><p>Right before she made it to the door Lily whispered a small, "Thank you."</p><p>With her hand on the handle of the door, she looked back at Lily with her gray eyes meeting the bewildered green ones and sighed, "No need to thank me, it's true."</p><p>And with that Aurora left with her bag in hand and made her way back to Severus, Evan, and Regulus. </p><p>(Page Break)</p><p>"First years what I'm about to tell you is very important. I know all of you are new to Slytherin but you need to remember in this house we stand up for one another. The other houses see us evil conviving snakes that are on a one-way path to joining the Dark Lord. They will try to belittle you and bully you because of this. If this happens I want you to get one of the older Slytherins and tell them what's happening, and we will figure out the appropriate action to take. On another note, the name Slytherin commands a certain amount of respect and I aspect all of you to hold up that name and not to bring shame to our house. Do I make myself clear?" Aurora asked the group of first-year Slytherins that stood in front of her and Severus.</p><p>They all nodded nervously up at the two of them. </p><p>"Good now, all of you go up to your room and get settled. I expect you to be at breakfast on time in the morning to get your schedule," Severus addressed the group and they quickly made their way to there rooms. </p><p>"Tell Regulus and Evan that I'll see them at breakfast. I have patrol tonight with Lupin," Aurora told Severus as she made her way to leave the common room. But before she could leave he grabbed her arm. </p><p>Frowning Aurora turned to look at Severus but before she could say anything he said this, "Be careful."</p><p>"I'm not scared of Lupin he has his head down in a book so much I'm surprised he wasn't placed in Ravenclaw," Aurora said pulling her arm out of his grip.</p><p>"He's not what he seems. Just be careful," Severus said actually sounding concerned which was a lot different from his usual monotone voice. </p><p>Not wanting to push or worry her friend she agreed, "Okay, I will."</p><p>After Severus looked content Aurora left the common room making her way up to the entrance of the grand hall where she and Lupin were supposed to meet. She couldn't help but think about what Severus said. What could Lupin be hiding that worried him so much that he voiced his concern about her safety with the boy?  As far as she could tell, sure Lupin got sick a lot which was strange, but she didn't think he could hurt a bowtruckle. Before she knew it she was walking up to the entrance where Lupin was already waiting for her. </p><p>Holding her head up she made her way next to him and said, "Sorry I'm late, the talk I had with my house's first years took longer than expected."</p><p>"Don't worry about it, I was early." Lupin gave her a small smile. </p><p>They started walking down the halls in uncomfortable silence and Aurora couldn't take it anymore and spoke up, "Look this is going to be a long night if were not even going to talk to one another. So, let's get to know one another I'll start. My name is Aurora Malfoy, I have one older brother named Lucius. What else? I hate quidditch it's idiotic and dangerous for no apparent reason, my favorite color is green, no surprise I know, and my favorite magical animal is a Hippogriff. Now your turn."</p><p>Lupin gave me a questioning look before answering, "My name is Remus Lupin, I'm an only child. I have three great friends that only seem to get me into trouble, I prefer to watch quidditch from the stands than to be flying out there on a broom, and I love chocolate."</p><p>"See that wasn't so hard. I feel like we know all that we need to know about each other already," Aurora joked lightly with Lupin. </p><p>"This night is already a lot different than I expected," Remus admitted shyly to the witch. </p><p>"What you thought just because I was a Slytherin that I was going to be cruel to you for no reason. Come on Lupin I thought you were smarter than that?" Aurora rolled her eyes at him. But made no further comment.</p><p>"No, it's just from what Sirius said that I..." Remus said but was cut off by Aurora cutting in.</p><p>"And what Black says goes right? Let me tell you I don't care what he has to say. He lost that right with me a long time ago. You know he and I use to be quite close when we were children right?" Aurora asked. Remus just shook his head in reply. Aurora scoffed and continued, "Of course he wouldn't tell his all righteous Gryffindor friends that he use to be friends with a 'no good Slytherin' as you Gryffindor's like to say."</p><p>"I'm sure Sirius didn't mean anything by it," Remus tried to justify his friend. </p><p>Taking a deep breath to cool herself down before she said anything else she might regret she said, "Look let's just agree to disagree on the subject that is Sirius Black. It's getting late anyway, look let's just call it a night."</p><p>"I'm sorry."</p><p>"You didn't do anything wrong to were just defending your friend. I would say that I'm sorry but I'm not. Good night, Lupin. I'll see you later," Aurora said and left Lupin where he was standing before he had a chance to reply.</p>
