  <strong>THE BOY WHO DISAPPEARED</strong>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>That's what the Daily Prophet headlines screamed. Despite assuring Hermione and Ron, Harry disappeared on the night of Bill and Fleur’s wedding right when the Ministry was taken over by Voldemort.There was no trace or sign of him anywhere.No One knew whether he was alive or dead,even Voldemort.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The mass hysteria that followed due to his disappearance was a huge blow to the WIzarding Ministry. Voldemort offered them a chance to live peacefully if they all accept his leadership. With no Special boy around,many of them decided to turn over to the Dark Side. The Muggle borns and those who supported Dumbledore decided to fight no matter what and went underground.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>After few months of taking over the Ministry,Voldemort launched his biggest weapon which he had developed during his absence. He put a trace on the magic done by every wizard or witch who were part of the British Wizarding Empire. So the moment you do magic,you will immediately surrounded by Snatchers ready to take you. Only those who had the Death Eater mark in their wrist can operate without having trace. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Forbidding magic to wizards is like forbidding Electricity to Muggles. They needed it for their day to day life. But since the Weasley family had Hermione. She helped them adjust being a Muggle. It was really tough for them to live as a Muggle,especially Molly weasley who was always in a foul mood and kept bickering. One day she accidentally set a charm instead of using the heater and immediately a dozen Snatchers descended. With more descending every minute and not enough people to fight. Hermione took out her special Portkey and called out to group but there was a deafening light and sound and there was total darkness. She felt a hand touch and then the Portkey. There was a pull in her navel and she was transported. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>She then landed in a farm. The Portkey was designed in such a way that it will change to a random location every second to prevent the Snatchers from following. She found that she was accompanied only by Arthur Weasley.she was happy that they didn’t go to a mountainous place or a desert. She looked up at the sign and said “Arthur,I think we are in Kansas, now”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Arthur still in shock asked where it is. They had landed in the United States of America. Now they don’t have any proof of identification or passport. So they could be arrested if found out. But Hermione knew how to be a Muggle. So within 2 days,she got the job of being a waiter in a bar. She rented a trailer which was around 2 miles from the bar. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Although,Arthur loved Muggles. He was still clueless and it would only sound suspicious especially when there were so many trailers in her park. So she told her neighbors that her father was a former professor who lost his mind .Arthur didn't mind playing that role as he could ask many inquisitive questions and learn the ways of Muggles. He usually used to watch TV in the house of an old lady when she’s at work.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>3 months had passed,Hermione was doing a good job as a waiter and was earning good tips. Arthur wanted to help but Hermione felt he still needed time. They changed their names to Heather and Aaron Weatherby. Hermione used to visit library every week to read the news about Britain and also to check how she can get a passport .</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Since it was a one room trailer with just a bathroom and toilet. It was very uneasy for them to stay together. Afterall,both of them needed privacy.Initially Arthur used to go out whenever Hermione had to change her dress or come out after her bath. But later Hermione told him to just turn the other side. Arthur had a very high libido which led them to have 7 kids and even after so many years,he and Molly used to have sex almost every other day.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Initially he looked at Hermione like a daughter but after staying with her for close to 3 months,he could no longer think of her like that.He would get tempted to have a peek while changing dresses or when she takes bath but he would control himself. She was no longer the bucktoothed little girl who came to Diagon Alley with her parents. She was only 18 years old and a full grown woman with amazing breasts and legs.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span> He knew his son had a crush on her but they never married or dated,but still he was 47 years old and she was just now legal. He would try to remember his wife but that only worsened it because she gave him the worst times in the past few months and it was her spell which caused this trouble.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>For the past few weeks,Arthur could see something strange in Hermione. She was spending more late hours than before and came only early morning. She also started bringing hundreds of dollars everyday especially during weekends. Also he noticed that she went to salon and now has a wavy hair.Her body was totally smooth when she wore a mini skirt it glowed. When he asked about it,she just said the bar wants her to be more presentable and that's bringing her more tips.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Arthur could sense that she was not telling the truth. So he decided to follow her. The next evening,Hermione started walking to work and Arthur followed her. He saw her walking past the bar she was working and then move to another street. That street looked a bit dodgy and then went to a door which was guarded by a man who looked like Hagrid without beard. She was allowed inside. Arthur tried to follow her but that man stopped him and said sternly “This entrance only for performers,the customers should enter the main entrance”.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>So he came to the front entrance and then he saw huge Neon Sign Board “Wild Coyote Gentleman Club”.There was a small line and then there were two more little giants standing.He waited in the line and then paid the $20 entrance fee they asked him.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The Inside of the club contrasted what it was outside. It looked fabulous with a bar on the side,many chairs and there was a ramp right in the middle. He still didn’t understand why this bar was demanding entrance fee compared to the one Hermione used to work.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He then saw a man in a tuxedo entering the stage. He was followed by a ray of light following him.He started  announcing “Gentleman,let's start the entertainment tonight with our newest but still the most popular performer ...and then he gave a long pause for the dramatic effect and then he put his hands and shouted <em><strong>“HEEAAATTHHHERRRRRRRRRRRRR…..”</strong></em></span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The Spotlight moved to the performer waiting and Arthur’s jaw dropped. It was Hermione dressed in a nurse outfit and beaming with a smile.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
