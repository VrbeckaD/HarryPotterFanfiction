    <p>"Lily?" Severus gasped as he stared at a living Lily Potter.</p><p>"Yes, Severus." Lily smiled at him. "I'm sorry I didn't come to Hogwarts sooner but Albus wanted me to stay hidden."</p><p>Harry looked at his mother and to Dumbledore. The man seemed pleased by the reaction Severus was portraying. "Mum?"</p><p>Lily glanced at Harry but ignored him as she walked to Severus. "I have missed you." She ran a hand down Severus' face.</p><p>Severus stepped back, looked at Dumbledore. "You knew she was alive? You kept her hidden?"</p><p>"Oh, Sev, it wasn't like that. I made him take a Vow after that night. I thought it would be best for Harry to be able to use the Blood Wards and stay safe while I stayed hidden. Albus agreed. Albus knew Harry would need to be strong to defeat the Dark Lord. My sister made sure he was."</p><p>Harry's face registered his surprise. "You knew what she and her family did to me and you did nothing?"</p><p>"It had to be done for the greater good. Don't be such a whining brat." Lily snapped. "Be thankful, you defeated him because of it."</p><p>"No, I defeated him because Severus trained me, hard for months." Harry couldn't believe this woman. This was the woman everyone raved about, everyone said how warm and loving she was.</p><p>Lily didn't respond. Harry huffed in annoyance. "Do stop that Potter, it's annoying."</p><p>Potter? Since when was he back to being called Potter. "Harry, your mother and I believed it was for the best. Now that Voldemort is defeated, we felt it was time for her to return and claim the mantle of Lady Potter."</p><p>So that why. Harry didn't want to burst their plans but he already claimed all his seats and made sure that no one could get into his vaults. There were even parslewards on them. He wondered what they had done to Severus. The touch, it had to be the touch. Harry knew he couldn't do anything right now but he would protect Severus. "Yes, I am going to head there as soon as we are done here. Now, Harry why don't you go and see your friends. Hermione, Ron, and Ginny have been very welcoming."</p><p>Oh, he bet, they were just as much liars as Dumbledore was. Did the old fool really think this was going to work? He was going to be 18 next month. He was able to claim his seats and titles when he was 14 thanks to that tournament. "We actually came up here to speak to the Headmaster about my apprenticeship program. We have the contract drawn up."</p><p>"I don't think I will approve it." Lily stated. "Severus will be very busy for the next few months."</p><p>"It's already signed. We just need the Headmaster to sign off on it." Harry looked at Severus, who was still staring at Lily. This was very bad.</p><p>"Sevvie?" Lily pouted, "do you really want to spend your time with him? Wouldn't you rather spend it with me?"</p><p>"Yes, Lily." Severus removed the contract from his pocket and before Harry could say a word, he ripped it apart, the pieces falling to the floor.</p><p>"Now, you little brat, go. Let the adults talk." Lily hissed at Harry.</p><p>Harry glared but seeing how he knew he wouldn't be able to beat the Headmaster, his eyes twinkling, and Severus, Harry left. He had to make some plans.</p>
