    <p>Albus felt almost light-headed with giddiness. He felt warm fingers squeeze his and he glanced over at his boyfriend, Gellert, who mirrored his own excitement. A wide smile graced Gellert’s handsome face. His pupils blown wide. Albus wanted to laugh. Here they were, two the greatest young minds in the wizarding world today and they were tiptoeing closer to destiny.</p><p>Torches flared into life as they passed, seeming to leap into life with joy as two youths walked down the long corridor. Neither spoke, for what words could capture this momentous moment in history?</p><p>The last few years had been filled with failures. Men and women too confident in their powers brought friends and followers with them to bask in what they hoped to be greatness. Naturally, Albus and Gellert had discovered where these people were going so very wrong. Rulers were wise and <em>humble</em>, so tonight they had come alone.</p><p>Time seemed to move slower as they crept ever closer to the heart of the Ministry where the Orb dwelt. Gellert let out a low chuckle, tension rolling off him in waves. </p><p>“Tomorrow we’ll be rulers of the Wizarding World!” It seemed incredible. The Orb selected the greatest wizards - one dark, one light - to rule the Wizarding World. Those chosen lived in history for all eternity. Tonight their names would join that incredible list. It was intoxicating: tomorrow they may as well be Gods.</p><p>The door to the Department of Mysteries opened and together they stepped into the future.</p><p align="center">~*~</p><p>Tom Riddle smiled as he walked away from the Orb, satisfaction riding high on his limited emotions. A bell sounded throughout the Ministry and would echo in the homes of every wizarding family in the British Isles. A Dark ruler had been chosen at last.</p><p>Gellert Grindelwald was the first to step forward to congratulate him. His former teacher wore a tight smile, his eyes cold. “Have you chosen a name for yourself?” A hush fell over the crowd, allowing their voices to ring out. Tom’s dark blue robes clinging to his well-defined form regally. They stood face to face in the circular antechamber.</p><p>Tom tilted his head, his dark chocolate brown eyes calculating. “My name from now on is Lord Voldemort.” Another bell sounded at the words; the click of a camera pulled Tom away from the staring contest he had been having with Gellert.</p><p>“My lord, congratulations,” Gellert bowed his head to the new young lord. “Did you by chance see who had been selected to rule beside you?” Gellert crossed his fingers by his sides, his long robe sleeves covering his actions. The honour had been denied to him but there was still hope for Albus.</p><p>It stung. They had been so hopeful, so <em>joyful</em> and then the Orb had rejected them. They had waited and waited but nothing had happened. The Orb did not react to them at all it was if they didn’t matter. That had been over fifty years ago. The last ruler of the Light had slowly died, her great power diminishing as time trickled on. Albus could have - should have - replaced her. He and Albus had plans. They would have changed the world for the better, and ruled in harmony (or as close as the two sides ever got, he supposed.)</p><p>“Fool.” Tom’s rich voice broke through his thoughts. Tom’s deep chuckle sent chills down his spine. “I rule, alone.” Tom allowed a grin to spread across his face. “I smashed the Orb. There will never be another ruler of the Light. I and I alone shall lead the world back to greatness.”</p><p>Gellert shuddered as Tom swept past, his blood running cold. Tom would bring the world to ruin, the balance of Light and Dark <em>had</em> to be maintained. <em>Tom had smashed the Orb.</em> What was the world to do? Behind him, Tom’s followers clapped and cheered. Their voices seeming to mock him and his failure to become the ruler of the Dark. <em>Albus.</em> He would have to write to Albus while he still had time.</p><p>Tom watched as Gellert left. The fool had once thought he would be chosen! The arrogance. Gellert Grindelwald was a talented wizard, of that there was no question, but he paled compared to Tom. Everyone paled compared to him.</p><p>“My Lord,” Bellatrix bowed deeply to him, her long back hair touching the floor. “What is your first order?”</p><p>Tom rolled his neck. “Work so soon my dear Bellatrix? I, for one, am going to get some rest. I expect you all to come to me tomorrow, however. Have fun.” His people cheered, clapping him on the shoulder. He winced internally. Maybe his first order would be to ban people from touching him.</p><p>The rabble disbursed, leaving the new ruler alone, except for one faithful follower. “Congratulations, my Lord.” Rabastan bowed deeply “May I speak freely?”</p><p>“Rabastan.” Tom stretched, his aching muscles protesting. He really should not have stayed up late the night before doing last minute research. “Go have fun for today. Find a willing hole to fill. Tomorrow, my reign will begin in earnest.” Without waiting for the man to reply, Tom left; he had planning to do.</p><p align="center">~*~</p><p>The bell rang out through Hogwarts, silencing every conversation. The ancient castle grew eerily still as the clear, full sound echoed through the corridors and classrooms. Seeped into every nook and cranny, filling every space.</p><p>Albus leaned forward on his desk, steepling his fingers together, a serious expression on his face. He could make a very educated guess as to who was just selected as Dark Ruler and it terrified him to his core.</p><p>Glancing down over his half-moon spectacles, he sighed. His desk was covered with pictures of members of the Order of the Phoenix. All were talented witches and wizards. All were capable of being the Light Ruler. Or rather they had been capable. Lowering his hands, he picked one picture from the bunch, his brow furrowed deep in thought. Perhaps all was not lost.</p><p>“Fawkes, I’d like you to keep an eye on Miss Evans.” Fawkes’s answering chirp filled him with renewed hope.</p>
