    <p>I smirk to myself as the blond races past me, muttering to himself. He was looking for a blond-haired, wide-shouldered kid. I’d let myself fade to my normal size and went to black hair again, so he wouldn’t see me. The only thing he might recognize is my pants or my shoes, since I’d ditched the jacket before I’d left the alley, and he hadn’t seen my shirt before that.</p><p>When he disappears around the corner, I turn my casual stride and head back to the deserted Alley. I calmly pick up the jacket, sling it over my shoulder, and start moving away.</p><p>I’d been working all day, switching between looks as I did so to attract more people. I refused to work nights, but I still got a good flow of people during the day. I was almost going to leave when Jessie had led the blond haired, blue eyed man over to me. ‘He’s got a thing for kids,’ he’d said. The curly locks had given me the shivers, but I’d nodded at the obvious nudge Jessie was giving me and led the man to the alley. I was 16, but I had been at this for years and still looked too young to be out and about. But the .mans looks still got to me, so when he’d forced me on my knees I’d done my best to distract him and had stolen his wallet. He hadn’t noticed until I’d already left him.</p><p>“I make believe that I impress. That every word, by design, turns ahead. I wanna feel reckless, wanna live it up just because. I wanna feel weightless 'cause that would be enough-” I pull out my phone and answer without looking at the screen. Only four people have my number, and only one of them have that ringtone.</p><p>“What do you want Princess?”</p><p>“A minute of your time, peasant. Where are you?”</p><p>“Out.”</p><p>“Oookay. I’m at your place. I let myself in.” </p><p>I growl in frustration. Draco had a bad habit of flooing to the leaky cauldron and braving the muggle world to break into my flat. I didn’t share it with anyone, and his only guardian didn’t mind him coming over so long as he told his mother where he was going. She even let him test out the new phones that Japan had come out with that worked with ambient magic. Unlike her deceased husband, she was embracing any new changes wholeheartedly.</p><p>“I’ll be there in a few minutes. What did you want?”</p><p>“We’re getting a new head of house this year,” he says, and I can hear him moving around.</p><p>“Don’t touch my shit, princess.”</p><p>“I’m making tea you asshole. Your cupboards are empty again. I’ll send Dobby over when I get home.”</p><p>“Why did Slughorn leave?” I ask to change the subject.</p><p>“Hm? Oh. he didn’t really. He’s still teaching potions, I mean.”</p><p>“But he’s not our head anymore?” I ask, turning to the building I rent from. I climb the steps quickly to the second floor.</p><p>“No, he’s not.”</p><p>“You’re beating around the bush again.”</p><p>“I am not!”</p><p>I hang up instead of answering and throw the door that he had left unlocked open. I see him glance up from what he was doing at the counter, his phone now discarded on the counter.</p><p>“Head of house?” I prompt as I throw the jacket over the back of my couch. I settle at the table as he joins me.</p><p>“He’s my Godfather, Severus Snape. He was overseas for a while, but he’s back now.”</p><p>“Exciting. Is he our DADA teacher?”</p><p>“Yeah, as far as I know. Slughorn gave him head of house duties because he was one of his students before. Mother told me this morning.”</p><p>“It’s almost six, how did you last this long without telling anyone?” I ask, smirking when he scowls at me.</p><p>“Shut up. I can keep secrets,” he mutters. I concede his point. I’ve lived in this flat since I was 12 and he hadn’t told anyone yet.</p><p>“Why is this so important then?”</p><p>“Because He’s going to be our head of house.”</p><p>“And?”</p><p>“Harry, He knows nothing about what’s been going on the past six years.”</p><p>Oh.</p><p>Well, that would be interesting. To get an outside point of view. I haven't had one of those in a while. Draco just defended me, saying I had every right to whatever I want. I ignore him, mostly. Dumbledore hasn’t talked to me since that disaster meeting the first year, but all his lackeys tell me what a disappoint I am often enough.</p><p>“You really don’t care do you?” Dracos annoyed voice has me looking at him again.</p><p>“Hmm? Sorry, Princess, I haven’t met the man I can’t say I do.” I tell him. </p><p>“You’re such an asshole,” he mutters, finishing his tea.</p><p>“Anything else you needed?”</p><p>“I had planned on spending the evening with my best friend, but I can leave if I’m really that big of a bother.” he huffs, going to stand.</p><p>“Let’s go to Knockturn.”</p><p>“Harry!”</p><p>“We go all the time. Everyone knows we’re regulars by now.” I tell him as I go towards my bedroom, stripping as I go.</p><p>“That doesn't mean we should go every time that I come over!”</p><p>“Come on, it’s boring here. I don’t have anything to do and here in a few hours, you‘ll be whining.”</p><p>“I will not!”</p><p>“You scared that your mother will find out after all this time?” I tease as I reemerge from my room, a black tee shirt on and black leather pants over my dragonhide boots. He snorts and shoves past me to start going through my closet. We were roughly the same size, so he didn’t mind going through my things to look for a long-sleeved black turtleneck and a pair of black dress pants. When he comes out I hold my black cloak out to him expectantly. He takes it with a huff and puts the hood up immediately. </p><p>On one of our first trips down there, we had learned from a local that exposing your neck meant that you were willing to feed a vampire, whether for a price or for the thrill of it was negotiated after they approached. Since then Draco did everything he could to cover up his neck. Usually, I stuck with a high collar on my cloak, but occasionally I would wear nothing but a tee shirt and prance around to get their attention. It never ceased to drive Draco crazy and amuse me. Today was one of those days. I clip on a cloak and apparate us out before he can protest, causing me to laugh when he stumbles at our entrance.</p><p>“Don’t do that! And where’s your collar at!?” he hisses. I wave away his concern, moving away from the mouth of the entrance to Diagon Alley and making my way to a bar that didn’t ask too many questions.</p><p>“Don’t turn away from me! You could-”</p><p>“Shush, we’re too close to Diagon and it’s still daylight.” I point out, making him pause. </p><p>“I hate it when you do this.”</p><p>“Oh, I know,” I tell him with a smirk as I push the door open. He follows me into the Bonedust Bar and I order us both butterbeer, deciding that we didn’t need to drink this early in the day. We settle at a card table in the back with three other wizards that we know, and we pass our day making money. Draco wins a lot more than I do, but I don’t mind because I’d made a lot more money today than I normally do.  We eat dinner there as well, having a few shots of firewhiskey.</p><p>“Alright, I need to get home. Mother is expecting me before 11.” Draco finally says, glancing at the pocket watch he always carries around. </p><p>“Righto. I’ll walk you to the apparition point.” I agree, standing and stretching. We’re laughing and joking together as we make our way out of the bar, and I stumble a little hitting the uneven pavement.</p><p>“You’d think you’d have learned to walk by now,” Draco says as he steadies me, grinning.</p><p>“Shut up. It was uneven and I was watching you.” I tell him to make him stop teasing.</p><p>“Watching me, huh? Well-”</p><p>“How much do you want?” a smooth voice asks to my left, startling me. Draco flinches away as a cool hand touches my bare neck, and I curse internally. I had meant to throw my hood up.</p><p>“Nothing, sorry. I hadn’t put my hood up yet, I’d tripped. Sorry for the confusion.” I answer smoothly. I’d heard stories of vampires taking offense to this approach, accusing us of baiting them before turning them away. I’ve had it happen twice before, and though annoyed they didn’t seem upset. </p><p>Not this time.</p><p>My back slams into the wall of the bar and Draco lets out a startled yelp as my arm is ripped from his.</p><p>“You shouldn’t be Sorry you should be repaying me. Everyone here knows what an exposed throat means, and since you didn’t name a price, I’m just going to take it!” </p><p>“What!? I-” I cut off on a hoarse yell as teeth tear into my neck and send a searing pain into my bloodstream. This guy was furious! I’d donated, once, to a friend of mine at the bar when Draco was gone. It was a hazy feeling that I hated, but he explained that he could have made me feel lust, or pain, or a number of other things. I’d avoided giving blood after that because it put me in a situation that I couldn’t control.</p><p>I hear Draco yelling, and people rushing from inside the bar. We had quite a few friends in there that knows I wouldn’t donate to a stranger. Black dots enter my vision and I realize with slight horror that this man is attempting to drain me dry, something that very few vampires do. Before I can pass out I let out a screech as he’s ripped away, leaving a gaping hole in my neck. Another pale face is looming over me before I black out.</p><p> </p><p>HPHPHPHPHPHPHPHPHPHPHPHPHPHPHPHPHPHPHPHPHPHPHPHP</p><p> </p><p>I bolt up out of sleep immediately, and someone yelps. My neck flares in pain and I growl, snapping my eyes open at the same time to look around. I ’m at Malfoy Manor, in the guest room Narcissa tried to get me to move into last summer. I look around frantically only to see Draco on the other side of the bed, sitting in an armchair and looking startled.</p><p>“What happened?” I groan, working my shoulder and neck and trying to get the pain to ease up.</p><p>“Your idiocy! Your blatant disregard for the rules! Your inability to fucking listen when I ask you to follow the fucking traditions! I TOLD you that you needed to cover your neck, that you were going to get propositioned. But no, Harry Fucking Potter does what he wants!” </p><p>His outburst startles me and I blink at him in shock for a long moment, before it comes flooding back.</p><p>“He tried to drain me,” I say in surprise, touching my neck again.</p><p>“He didn’t fucking try, Harry! He did drain you and if Lucien hadn’t been there- if you hadn’t said- Fuck, Harry, I was watching you die.” his voice breaks before he’s launching himself at me, a common occurrence when he’s emotional. I hug him back immediately and he makes a squeak of protest.</p><p>“Too tight!” he growls, and I release my hold, confused. I hadn’t really touched him, but I’m much gentler as I hold him again.</p><p>“Lucien? What about that old bat?” I ask suddenly, recalling his broken sentences.</p><p>“He came out of the bar and saw that man attacking you. He tore him off and asked you if you wanted to live. You wouldn’t answer, we thought… he asked if you would take his blood, and you tried to talk. He said you said yes, but I didn’t hear anything. He…”</p><p>“He changed me?” I ask, this time it was my voice breaking.</p><p>It wasn’t that I was suicidal, perse. But if I was drained of my blood and I had the option, I know for a fact that I would have told him to fuck off and not change me. Draco called me brash, and Gryffindor, but most of the time when I’m pulling a stunt I have no thought to if I die or not. If I did, I wouldn’t have to go back to my flat during the summer. If I didn’t, then I could further my magical knowledge. It was as simple as that. There was no negative to dying, except for the fact I knew that Draco would hate me for it.</p><p>“Where is he?” I ask after a long moment. I know all about vampiric changes, I’d wrote a defense essay on them and sent it into the examiners as a prerequisite for teaching when I leave the school. That one, the werewolf essay, and the common spells essay I had passed with an above perfect grade.</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>“I know how this works, the transformation isn’t over yet. I have to… I have to take his blood at least two more times.”</p><p>“What? He never said anything! It’s been two days, surely he should have been by now?”</p><p>I growl low in my throat in frustration. Lucien was going to have his ass kicked when I was at full strength again.</p><p>Before I can get too worked up the door opens and Narcissa moves into the room, a stern frown on her face.</p><p>Oh no, she was going to mother me again.</p>
