    <p>Warning: This will contain spoilers for the Crimes of Grindelwald as it takes place shortly after the events of the film.</p><p>You and Newt Scamander were lovers, secret lovers. You weren’t strangers to the odd meeting times, kisses stolen in the moonlight, and hands held beneath tables at meetings between your families. The time had come where you and Newt had brought up announcing your relationship and facing whatever may come. But, your parents were quick to decide your destiny for you. Right before you intended to come clean, your parents let out a secret of their own— that you were to marry their own selected choice of a worthy suitor. Now restricted from marrying who you chose and with a new future thrown in your face and approaching soon, you were fearful of what was to follow. Though forbidden to, you still met with Newt, the man who had brought up marriage with you more than once already, against your parents’ wishes. Beneath the stars and outside your childhood home, he pledges his love to you yet again, telling you that he’d do anything for you, even if it meant giving up his dreams and job to run away somewhere where the two of you would be far from all the chaos. The day that you two set off together never came, for you disappeared alone, leaving Newt heartbroken with nothing but a tear-stained letter stating that you wanted him to move on and achieve the dreams he told you about, and that you did this, “Because you loved him and didn’t want to be the reason he was being held back.” Newt searched, ached, and cried for months in agony, but it was as if all traces of you were just gone into the cold air.</p><p>But that was years ago. </p><p>Now it’s 1927. Grindelwald is still out and on the rise, and following twisted and shocking events of Paris, it doesn’t appear that he is growing any weaker. Everyone is still left with a long list of questions, but another set is added to the list when your photo begins to appear in newspapers surrounded by a false name and such titles like “Mysterious Fanatic?” And “Another Player in Grindelwald’s Dark Game?“ Newt is nearly knocked off his feet when he sees your face again, and even though he doesn’t believe for a minute you’re on Grindelwald’s side, he does think that you may know things that could help them put an end to the terror that has been caused. He sets off to find you once more, and though the scenario is different and time has slipped by, it doesn’t mean his feelings for you had shifted in the slightest. </p><p>With a complicated past, a chaotic present, and an uncertain future, the relationship between you and Newt is tested, and maybe even rekindled, while the impending darkness looms over all of you. Could things go back to how they were before and what else will unfold between some familiar faces and Grindelwald himself yet again?</p>
