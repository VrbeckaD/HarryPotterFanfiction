  <em> Entry #1 </em>
</p><p>
  <em> 1st of September, 1999 </em>
</p><p><em> I’d lost my journal since the war, and I hadn’t the motivation to go out and purchase a new one since then, but mother insisted on me going to buy myself a new one. I wasn’t all too surprised when I went to Diagon Alley only to be glared at by everyone there as I got my new school supplies. I mean, after all that happened I don’t blame them… Anyways, yes, you heard that right. New school supplies. A majority of students who missed out on the rest of their final year are returning to Hogwarts to finish off their education, I included. I won’t be surprised if I’m one of the only few who shows up since so many were lost from… </em><br/> <em> Anyways, it’s my first day back today. Hopefully, I don’t run into the ‘Golden Trio’, seeing as they may decide to rip my head off the first chance they get. </em> <em><br/> And honestly, I wouldn’t blame them. I don’t blame anybody for feeling that way when they see me.</em></p><p> </p><p>It’s common knowledge that on the 15th time that you and your soulmate touch each other that the tattoo of the plant on your neck(whether it be a tree or other) will bloom and grow into an identical one to that of your soulmate’s. Unfortunately, Draco Malfoy is very unlikely to find his soulmate after all he’s done to others, and he’s pretty sure his soulmate would likely sooner die or abandon him or pretend he doesn’t <em> exist </em> than be with him.</p><p>As he walked into the station, he stared down at the mirror in his hand, speaking with Pansy and Blaise. “What do you <em> mean </em> you’re not coming back to Hogwarts? I thought-”</p><p>“Draco, we’ve been over this. I’m much too busy with these bloody children running around my house, and Blaise is working on that dumb business he insists running.”</p><p>“Hey! Convenient Magical Travel is useful!”</p><p>“Maybe for <em> long distances </em> , but just about every witch and wizard can apparate wherever they please, <em> Blaise </em>.”</p><p>Draco rolled his eyes, “Stop your bickering. I’ll just deal with this.”</p><p>They both turned their attention back to Draco. “We’re sorry you’ll be the only returning Slytherin, Draco.” Pansy then apologized, “We’ll make it up to you.”</p><p>“Oh? How will you do that then?”</p><p>There’s a long pause, “We’ll figure something out.”</p><p>“You best hop on that train, Draco. Don’t want to miss it.” Blaise piped up.</p><p>Draco looked up at the train quickly, “Shit, you’re right. I’ll talk with you two when I get settled into the dormitory.”</p><p>“Alright.” Draco gave a weak, pained smile before putting the mirror into his messenger bag. He took a deep breath and looked at all the cold glares he was getting from other students and families. It was even worse when his eyes landed on three Gryffindors he had hoped to be there the <em> least </em>.</p><p><em> Shit </em>.</p><p>This was going to be a long school year.</p><p align="center">* *</p><p>It was surreal how smooth and calmly McGonagall laid on the information that Potter and Draco would be paired up in a room together. Neither of them had dared look each other in the eye, and Draco kept his head hung whenever Potter would shoot him nasty glares throughout the day. Now he had to live with that shit? It wasn’t fair!</p><p>But he had no room to complain. He understood why she would pair him up in the same room as Potter. It was likely to help her keep a close eye on him. Make sure he doesn’t do anything dangerous and/or stupid. She obviously didn’t trust him. Of course, she didn’t. Why would she after what he <em> did </em>?</p><p>As he headed to his room, journal clutched to his chest, he tried to avoid the glares he got from the other eighth year students who had decided to come back and finish their education. His eyes stayed down toward the floor as he rushed away and into the confines of his half-private quarters.</p><p>Draco simply took his things and started to unpack on his side of the room right before Potter came in to do the same. He set some muggle books on his nightstand, put his clothes away, and made his bed with his favored purple bedding. He does this all whilst he feels Harry Potter’s eyes boring into the back of his head. He swallows thickly turns his head to look at him, realizing he’d finished unpacking already.</p><p>“Yes, Potter?” Draco tries to force his voice to sound even but it betrays him and sounds slightly higher than it normally would be. He hadn’t even properly seen his face when he looked at him earlier. The most prominent thing that was a bit new to him was this <em> look </em> Potter had in those green eyes of his. It was something <em> different </em> than what he’d ever seen come from him. It was unrecognizable- he had no idea what it was.</p><p>“If we’re going to be sharing a room I want to make a couple of things clear.”</p><p><em> Bloody hell, please don’t let this go even more downhill than it already has been. </em> Draco really didn’t want to deal with more problems now that he was here.</p><p>“Go on, Potter. I haven’t got all night.” He said, trying to make himself sound uninterested but his uncomfortable tone overriding it.</p><p>“You keep to your side and I’ll keep to mine. I’m not going to be an ass to you, but as long as you aren’t one to me. If we want privacy, we say something and the other leaves immediately. Don’t get angry if I’m doing something you consider obnoxious or don’t like and I’ll do the same for you.”</p><p>“So, would you just like me to pretend you don’t exist?”</p><p>“Well, not what I had in mind, but that works perfectly actually.” Potter blinks at Draco, who crosses his arms, trying not to stare at his eyes. His eyes which were just <em> so green </em> and had such a <em> different </em> expression in them.</p><p>“Smashing.” Draco’s voice was dripping with sarcasm now, finally managing to conceal his discomfort. “Can I return to unpacking now?”</p><p>“I believe you already finished.”</p><p>“Let me rephrase that then, in the simpleton ‘I can’t take a bloody hint’ way. I. Want. To. Be. Left. <em> Alone </em>.”</p><p>There was an excruciatingly painful, and fairly awkward, silence that came up as soon as he said that. Draco pauses before turning back to his bed and having a seat as he grabs one of the muggle books off of his nightstand and opens it to pretend to read it. Potter takes a moment to examine him(albeit suspiciously) before grabbing something of his and walking out of the room. Draco then drops the book back on the nightstand and groans, pulling one of his pillows of his head. He starts grumbling to himself about how “unfair this situation is” and that there were “plenty of other students he could have been roomed with”. He eventually pulls the pillow off his head after thinking about it.</p><p>“... Actually, I think I might be luckier than I first thought.” He countered himself, “Being put in a room with Potter probably saved me from the possibility of being strangled or hexed in my sleep by someone else…” He murmured this to himself softly, rubbing his chin in thought.</p><p>And what the hell was with that look in his eyes? He’d never seen anybody look at him like that before. It wasn’t really intimidating or scary, or anything negative as a matter of fact. He couldn’t quite place his finger on it, but it felt nice. Maybe Potter didn’t <em> hate </em> him? Maybe they could get along this year. Maybe, just maybe, he could try and apologize for everything.</p><p>That is if nobody goes on a manhunt for him before then.</p>
