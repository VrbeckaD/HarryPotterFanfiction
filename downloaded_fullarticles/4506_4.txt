    <p>Saturday</p><p>12:33<br/>[Draco] Okay, you win. I’ve got one of these ridiculous muggle devices. Now what?</p><p> </p><p>---------<br/>Sunday</p><p>09:21<br/>[Draco] Pansy</p><p>13:45<br/>[Draco] Pansy</p><p> </p><p>----------<br/>Monday</p><p>08:06<br/>[Draco] PANSY CAMELLIA PARKINSON WHY WON’T YOU ANSWER MY TEXTS</p><p> </p><p>---------<br/>Tuesday</p><p>09:13<br/>[Draco] PANSY IF YOU DON’T ANSWER ME RIGHT NOW I SWEAR TO SALAZAR I WILL MURDER YOU.</p><p> </p><p>---------<br/>Wednesday</p><p>17:35<br/>[Draco] I hate you.</p><p> </p><p>-----------<br/>Friday</p><p>15:28<br/>[Draco] We’re all meeting at McCormick’s. Don’t you fucking dare be late. If I’m stuck there alone with Goyle, I might drown myself in the toilet.</p><p>17:09<br/>[Draco] Seriously Pans, what the fuck was the point in giving me your number if you never ANSWER YOUR GODDAMN TEXTS.</p><p>19:25<br/>[Harry] Mate. Whoever gave you this number is having you on. I’m not Pansy.</p><p>[Draco] Who the fuck is this and what have you done with Pansy?</p><p>[Harry] No idea who she is, but she’s not here.</p><p>[Draco] Well then not-Pansy, why have you got Pansy’s phone?</p><p>[Harry] It’s not her phone, you idiot, it’s my phone. She’s given you a wrong number. Take a hint.</p><p>[Draco] That evil little she-devil. I really will kill her this time.</p><p>[Harry] Sorry. Plenty more fish etc etc</p><p>[Draco] Plenty more fish?<br/>[Draco] What do you mean???</p><p>[Harry] You know. Maybe you guys weren't meant to be. She's clearly not interested if she gave out a fake number </p><p>[Draco] OH! Oh good grief, no! She's my best friend, or at least she was. I'm reconsidering that now. She probably thinks she's being hilarious. Well. I'll show her.</p><p>[Harry]  ... Should i be concerned for Pansy’s safety?? </p><p>[Draco] Yes, probably. But don't worry about it, she completely deserves everything that's coming to her.</p><p>[Harry]  oooookay. Well. Good talk. If I see Pansy’s name in the news, I'm forwarding this convo to the authorities.</p><p> </p><p>-------</p><p>19:43<br/>[Harry] Pansy...for the last.fucking.time. Please. For the love of god. Stop giving my number out to your rejects.<br/>[Harry] And who is this latest guy anyway? He’s talking like he’s a friend of yours. It’s not anyone I know is it....?<br/>[Harry] Wait.<br/>[Harry] Wait a fucking second<br/>[Harry] Please please please don’t tell me it’s who I think it is…<br/>[Harry] PANSY!!!!!!!????</p><p>[Pansy] Oh hush now. Don’t worry your fuzzy little head about it.</p><p>[Harry] Pansy!!<br/>[Harry] That’s not an answer!!!!!</p><p> </p><p>-------<br/>Sunday</p><p>11:14<br/>[Draco] I apologise for all the texts I sent believing you were Pansy. She said she's sorry too.</p><p>[Harry] To me or to you? And how do I know you're not just saying that to cover up for the fact you murdered her last night.</p><p>[Draco] To you, I think. She was fairly vague.<br/>[Draco] ...and unfortunately, she’s still very much alive and still a huge pain in my arse.</p><p>[Harry] how did you find her without her phone number?</p><p>[Draco] I floo called her.</p><p>[Harry] and yet it still took you a week to realise you had the wrong number.</p><p>[Draco] shut up.</p><p>[Harry] Wow. Ruuuude.</p><p>[Draco] I think you'll find you were rude first. I’m merely following your lead.</p><p> </p><p>———<br/>Saturday</p><p>07:09<br/>[Draco] PANS <br/>[Draco] PANSY<br/>[Draco] WOMAN DON’T MAKE ME COME UP THERE </p><p>[Harry] still not Pansy<br/>[Harry] update your fucking contacts</p><p>[Draco] Ah. Apologies.<br/>[Draco] Still rude, I see.</p><p>[Harry] it's fucking 7 am. Jfc </p><p>[Draco] ...just fight crups? Jolly fat cat? </p><p>[Harry] jesus fucking christ.</p><p>[Draco] Oh! Someone certainly got up on the wrong side of bed this morning.</p><p>[Harry] I'm not up. I'm still asleep. It's Saturday. Go the fuck to sleep or shut the fuck up. </p><p> </p><p>12:18<br/>[Harry] okay. Now I'm up.</p><p>[Draco] you're only just getting up now? Seriously? Are you ill?</p><p>[Harry] no. I'm 22 and it's a Saturday. Are *you* ill? </p><p>[Draco] No. Why?</p><p>[Harry] because you’re not only just getting up now. Unless you’re puking your guts up or are still up from the night before, you have to be seriously gone in the head to be up so early on a saturday.<br/>[Harry] or old...I’ve heard that old people get up early too.</p><p>[Draco] Some of us have to study on a Saturday. </p><p>[Harry] wtf<br/>[Harry] Who the fuck studies on a saturday morning? </p><p>[Draco] Those of us who actually care about bettering ourselves rather than lounging around with a hangover. That’s who.<br/>[Draco] BUT even if I didn't have to study, I wouldn’t sleep until noon. Good grief.</p><p>[Harry] Good grief?  What are you, like, 50?</p><p>[Draco] Ouch. Please. Don't sugar coat it. Just say what you mean...</p><p>[Harry] come on, no one under 50 years old says good grief. No one. <br/>[Harry] and then there’s the whole getting up at the arse crack of dawn thing. OLD.</p><p>[Draco] Well I'm only 22, same as you, so that's your theory blasted out of the water.</p><p>[Harry] No way are you 22. You're probably some dirty old perv who’s pretending to be young so you can drag me off to your lair to do unspeakable things and feed off my youth.</p><p>[Draco] !! <br/>[Draco] Fuck you.</p><p> </p><p>———</p><p>14:46<br/>[Harry] It’s him, isn’t it?<br/>[Harry] He said he’s 22. And he said you’re his best friend. And he sounds like a bit of a git.<br/>[Harry] What are you on, woman?? <br/>[Harry] Why would you do this to me??? </p><p>[Pansy] Calm down, Potty. Why on earth are you still texting him?</p><p>[Harry] Because he keeps texting me.</p><p>[Pansy] No one forces you to reply to these unknown numbers, you know. </p><p> </p><p>———<br/>Wednesday</p><p>18:16<br/>[Harry] are you not talking to me?</p><p>[Draco] Are you still scared I’m trying to lure you to my old man lair?</p><p>[Harry] ....a little... but I'm bored.</p><p>[Draco] Wow, thanks. What if I don't want to talk to you?</p><p>[Harry] fine. <br/>[Harry] I don't care<br/>[Harry] I'm just going to <br/>[Harry] keep texting anyway<br/>[Harry] make your phone vibrate<br/>[Harry] all<br/>[Harry] fucking <br/>[Harry] night</p><p>[Draco] OH SWEET MERLIN’S TITTIES STOP THAT NOW</p><p>[Harry] sorry not sorry</p><p> </p><p>21:50<br/>[Harry] I'm still bored...and maybe a little tipsy now. </p><p>[Draco] I'm not here for your entertainment. <br/>[Draco] Don’t you have friends you can pester?</p><p>[Harry] I do, but they're the ones being boring. Was supposed to be heading down the pub but my interfering friend decided we should study instead.</p><p>[Draco] Ha. Saturday morning study doesn’t sound like such a bad idea now, does it? Your interfering friend sounds sensible. You should listen to them more.<br/>[Draco] Wait, you said you’re tipsy. Are you studying while drunk?</p><p>[Harry] Not drunk, tipsy- there’s a difference! This is so fucking dull, i need the alcohol to stay sane.<br/>[Harry] And don't take her side! <br/>[Harry] AND FYI, I will NEVER think sat morning study is a good idea so shut your mouth</p><p>[Draco] Studying is important. Studying sober is VERY IMPORTANT. <br/>[Draco] How are you supposed to retain the knowledge you’re supposedly acquiring if you’re three sheets to the wind? </p><p>[Harry] I’M NOT DRUNK IM TIPSYYYYY there’s a difference, mr know it all.</p><p>[Draco] If you could see me, you’d know by my eye roll how unimpressed I am with you right now.<br/>[Draco] What are you studying anyway?</p><p>[Harry] Just smth for work. <br/>[Harry] You're mean. Always shouting at me. Telling me to study :( </p><p>[Draco] shut up and pay attention to your friend.</p><p>[Harry] :’(</p><p> </p><p>———</p><p>“Harry, do you have any idea how important these exams are? They could drop you from the Auror program! Put the phone down!” Hermione yelled, punctuating her words with a thwack of a textbook to the back of Harry’s head.</p><p>Harry yelped and ducked his head down, narrowly avoiding spilling his drink over the carpet.</p><p>“Good luck with that. Bloody thing’s been stuck to his hand more than usual.” Ron grumbled. </p><p>Harry scowled at his friends, then pouted as he turned off his phone’s screen, grudgingly accepting that maybe they were right. </p><p>“Who are you texting anyway?” Hermione asked, leaning forward to take a look at the thankfully blank screen</p><p>“No one. It doesn't matter. Look—phone is going in my pocket. I promise not to interrupt the sacred dullness of study time,” he said, holding up his empty hands to demonstrate his lack of distracting muggle devices.</p><p>“Wait a minute. Is it still that guy from the other day? One of Parkinson’s rejects? The one you thought might be…<i>ferret face</i>?” Ron asked worriedly, his voice dropping to a horrified whisper as he spoke <i>his</i> name.</p><p>“So what if it is?” Harry replied defensively, tensing his shoulders. He didn’t fancy trying to explain himself to his friends when he wasn’t really sure himself what he was doing.</p><p>“Oh my god Harry, it's been two weeks! How long are you going to drag this out for? Does he have any idea who you are?”</p><p>“I don’t think so,” he huffed. “And I’m not dragging anything out! It’s just an occasional text or two. It’s not a big deal.”</p><p>“...occasional…” Ron snorted. Harry leaned over and punched him in the arm.</p><p>“Are you going to tell him it’s you?”</p><p>“No! Are you mental? Look, it's just an occasional text. He'll get bored soon and stop so there's no need to do a big reveal. And you’re forgetting that I’m not even sure it <i>is</i> him!”</p><p>“I don’t get why you don’t just ask him who he is. Here, pass me your phone and I’ll do it for you.” Ron held out his hand expectantly.</p><p>“No fucking way!” Harry cried, slapping his hand over the pocket that held his phone in case Ron got it into his head to try and take it by force. “Just leave it alone. It’s probably not even him.” Harry wasn’t sure why he felt so protective of his strange text-relationship with this possible-Malfoy, but he wasn’t going to let Ron blunder in and ruin it.</p><p>“Alright, keep your knickers on. Merlin.” Ron shook his head half in amusement, half in exasperation. He turned to Hermione. “It’s happening again, ‘mione. Next thing we know he’ll be stalking that blond twat around town, rather than just flirting on the phone.”</p><p>“Shove off!” Harry launched himself at his best friend and, laughing, they both fell to the floor in a tangle of limbs and wrestled until Hermione’s loud throat-clearing attracted their attention. </p><p>“Right, that's enough chit-chat you two. Back to the books!”</p><p>“Yes, Mum,” they replied sullenly as one.</p>
