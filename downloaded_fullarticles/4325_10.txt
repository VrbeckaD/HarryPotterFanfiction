          <div class="userstuff"><p>Hermione sees Luna on Wednesdays. A perfect break to the week, an easy lie to tell (there's nothing <i>suspicious</i> about a Wednesday).</p>
<p>Anticipation always makes her angry and horny as hell until she's ready to explode when she arrives. No matter what's in store, it's always amazing.</p>
<p>Sprawled across Luna's bed, arms shackled while Luna takes her from behind with their newest toy is more exquisite than breathing.</p>
<p>Orgasms inspired by Luna as she murmurs filthy things into Hermione's ear--letting go like this is more than worth returning to the mundane once Thursday rolls around and they split again.</p></div>
