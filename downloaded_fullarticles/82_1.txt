The Gemara adds: and from this we learn that Howlers must be treated with special caution, as it is said, "For a fire is kindled in my anger" (Deut 32:22). </p><p dir="ltr">The Gemara asks, but when may one Apparate? תנו רבנן, it is assur to Apparate on Shabbat. אמר רבי אליעזר, one may Apparate even on Erev Shabbat. However, the mishnah says a person may not Apparate a half hour before mincha on a weekday, or bow before a hippogriff, or begin making a potion, lest they become distracted and forget to recite mincha.</p></div>
