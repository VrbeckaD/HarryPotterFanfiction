    <p>Disclaimer: I don’t own anything. There. I disclaimed it.</p><p>The fifth year at Hogwarts started much differently than other years. As Dumbledore stood to address his students, an expectant hush swept over the upturned faces. </p><p>“My dear children, it is a joy to see you all here, safe and sound. A reminder to our new students and certain others that the forbidden forest is completely out of bounds as is Hogsmead to any student below third year. Also, we have a new addition to our teaching staff. Professor Umbridge from the Ministry of Magic has agreed to take up the position for Defense Against the Dark Arts, “he broke off to clap, the rest of the students half-heartedly clapping along with him. “And finally, a new student has been accepted here under special circumstances, for she is the first non-human student we have ever taught. Due to her elven heritage, the sorting hat cannot sort her into a house so Ms. Lofland will be spending four weeks each in every house to determine which one will best suit her.” </p><p>The side door opened behind the faculty table and a figure stepped out and stood poised next to the table, head tilted towards Dumbledore in uncertainty. Every student in great hall craned their necks, even stood up, to get a look at the new mysterious new student. From what they could tell, she was tall and willowy, with dark wavy hair that reached her shoulders. Dumbledore nodded back to her and gestured towards the Hufflepuff table, indicating she should join them. Lofland strode down the steps quickly and took her place next to a Hufflepuff fifth year that gaped at her openly before quickly making room for her. </p><p>Draco nudged Blaise and Pansy, “Why do you think that Dumbledore has allowed a nonhuman in this year? And what’s with that Umbridge woman…” Draco eyed the plump pink woman in disgust, immediately catching on that something was amiss. </p><p>Pansy flicked a piece of hair out of her eyes and stared intensely at the elf that was making no move to interact with the wide-eyed students around her, but merely stared down at the worn wood of the table in front of her. “I didn’t know about this at all and my parents are very connected. Dumbledore must have made an inside decision and didn’t tell any of the members in the Ministry of Magic.”</p><p>Draco could see her itching for a parchment and quill to tell her parents about the scandal that was unfolding. Blaise glanced at Draco and then at Umbridge, “I’d be careful around her mate. I heard she’s not one to mess with, because her methods to get into Fudge’s inner circle were violent to say the least. </p><p>Draco scoffed, “she wouldn’t dare do anything to me. I’m a Malfoy,” he said somewhat bitterly. He was glad to be at Hogwarts instead of Malfoy Manor, which was the first time he could honestly admit it. Ever since Potter had stumbled out of the maze last term with a dead Cedric Diggory and the news that Voldemort was once again at full power, things had changed in the Malfoy household. Draco shuddered and glanced up, his gaze catching on the elf again and surprised at finding her looking directly at him. Her eyes were slanted and he was surprised to see that they were dark crimson. Draco held her gaze for a second more before he dropped it. “Aren’t elves supposed to be nature hippies or something?”</p><p>Pansy scoffed, obviously jealous at Draco’s interest in the newcomer. “There isn’t just one type of elf- there are a couple different species. I know what kind you’re thinking of but I don’t think that’s what Lofland is. She looks more like a Mountain elf…or maybe a Dark elf, but Dumbledore would never let one of those into Hogwarts.”</p><p>Draco glanced over at Dumbledore, who was talking merrily to Professor McGonagall while eating roast turkey. “Well he willingly lets death eaters onto the premises so maybe a dark elf isn’t such a stretch for him,” he muttered under his breath. </p><p>Blaise was the only one to hear him and raised a questioning eyebrow, “Had a rough summer?”</p><p>Draco winced and his left hand ghosted over his ribs. “You might say that.”</p><p>Blaise’s eyes flashed and he prodded Draco’s ribs gingerly, checking for broken bones. “Looks like you got off easy mate, I think it is mostly bruising, I don’t feel anything that’s broken.”</p><p>Draco looked even more pale than he normally did but he nodded jerkily. “Ill see you later,” he said shortly as he got up and walked quickly from Great Hall. </p><p>--</p><p>	Draco had been lying in his bed for hours. Memories from the summer had been in his head since he had arrived. He sighed. Draco had thought that finally getting away from his parents and the death eaters and the looming presence of Voldemort would clear his mind but it did quite the opposite. The time was nearing three in the morning when he decided to get up and take a walk. He had long since memorized every short cut from the Slytherin rooms to a small doorway almost concealed behind a large shrub on the grounds. Emerging into the bright moonlight, he breathed in and leisurely strode over to the lake, his dark cloak pulled over his head for concealment. This is what he had needed- some fresh air away from everyone and their opinions. He needed to find his own thoughts that had been chased away by his domineering father and his threatening company.</p><p>Draco was halfway around the lake when he saw something ahead of him that made him pause. There was someone sitting by the lake, a cloak like his own covering the figure and making it unidentifiable. Figuring it couldn’t really be something that could hurt him, he made his way over slowly, stopping a couple of feet away. </p><p>The figure didn’t turn its head but a low voice murmured, “what?”</p><p>Draco looked away, staring out across the slow-moving lake, “Nothing, I was just wondering who would be wandering out here at this hour.”</p><p>The figure scoffed, “says the human that is doing the exact same thing.”</p><p>“Human? Does that mean you’re…”</p><p>The figure pushed back its hood, revealing coppery skin and red eyes, “Surprise. It’s me.”</p><p>“Oh…Lofland right?”</p><p>“Yes. And you’re—“</p><p>“Draco Malfoy.”</p><p>“Right…the boy with the bad summer. How are your ribs?” She looked up innocently at him and Draco gaped at her.</p><p>“I’m…what, how did you know…wait, you probably have advanced hearing or some shit like that?”</p><p>Lofland glanced down, “Some shit like that…”</p><p>Draco sighed. Without really thinking about it, he sat down a couple of feet away from the elf, then laid back in the grass, letting the hood slip off and his silver hair splay around him. He was tired of not being able to sleep and be in constant fear for his life. He had closed his eyes and when he blinked them open the elf was staring at him again. It was his turn to murmur “what?”</p><p>“You are…you’re not like the others.” She waited a beat before adding, “It’s nice.”</p><p>Draco frowned. “Don’t get too used to it. I don’t associate myself with creatures.”</p><p>Lofland’s eyes narrowed, “I wouldn’t expect you too, a great pureblood like yourself.”</p><p>“Do you have something against purebloods or is it just all wizards in general?”</p><p>A dark look crossed her face and Lofland brushed her hair behind her ear, “it doesn’t matter.”</p><p>Draco was caught on the movement, for it had revealed one of her sharply pointed ears and he had the strangest desire to reach out and touch it.  He caught himself in the middle of doing just that and reigned in the abnormal desire. “Enjoy the lake,” he said shortly as he rose and left her there in the gleaming moonlight, staring after him.</p>
