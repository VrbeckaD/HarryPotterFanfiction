    <p>Hermione sat at the library late at night, trying to finish her potions essay. Usually, she aced potions with a gleaming cauldron, but this essay had her stumped.</p><p>She let out a frustrated sigh, and it echoed around the nearly deserted room, drawing the attention of the other occupant. Draco Malfoy sat a few seats down at the long table. He picked up a crumpled bit of parchment and tossed it down the table, hitting her shoulder. </p><p>"Oi, Granger. Stuck on potions?" Draco whispered down the table</p><p>"Oh, go swallow your tie..." Hermione growled. Draco smirked and scooted closer. When she ignored him he tossed a quill onto her essay.</p><p>"What are the properties of that blasted root again?" He asked. She continue to ignore him, so he scooted closer in hopes of catching a peek at her essay. Hermione hastily covered it, knocking over her bottle of ink in the process. The onyx liquid spread over the entire table, covering both Hermione and Draco's essays.</p><p>"Wonderful going... Merlin's beard, you stupid mudblood!" Draco hissed, flushing in anger. Hermione slammed her potions book on the table before shoving everything into her book bag and promptly bursting into tears of exhaustion as she fled the library. </p><p>"Scourgify." Madame Pince growled over Draco's shoulder, cleaning up the spilled ink. On the table was Hermione's quill, now ink-free. Before he could stop himself, Draco grabbed the quill and his belongings before chasing Hermione into the corridor, much to the dismay of the librarian. </p><p>"Wait! Granger..." Draco called, getting up and running after the bushy-haired Gryffindor. "Your quill." </p><p>He caught her arm on the grand staircase, offering the quill. Hermione snatched it back and kept stomping up the steps. </p><p>"Granger, what's gotten your knickers in a twist?" Draco persisted, trying and failing to catch her wrist. </p><p>"Granger, I know you can hear me." Draco panted. </p><p>Hermione spun around, sending him clattering down a step as she advanced on him. "Go on then, keep ranting about how much of a clumsy mudblood I am, how I go out of my way to inconvenience you, how Potter and Weasley only hang around me because I do their homework? Have I missed anything? Anything else you tell your father about in your daily letters?" </p><p>Draco took another step back, whatever he'd been about to say dying in his throat. </p><p>"I spent all day in the library to get away from those two idiots, found myself actually confounded on an essay for once, and then had to go spill ink all over everything. I'm exhausted, I'm hungry, I'm dying for a shag, I don't need you following me around making me feel shittier!" Hermione finished her tirade, breathing hard. </p><p>Silence reigned around the deserted staircase. A nearby portrait averted his eyes, coughing to hide a choked-off laugh. </p><p>"Scourgify." Draco said softly, pointing his wand at the slimy ball of parchment in Hermione's hand. The ink dripping down her balled fist onto the steps receded. Hermione opened her hand, looked at the parchment, blinked, and then fell on her backside, crying again. </p><p>"Merlin's beard." Draco said. "What's gotten into you?" </p><p>"I-I-I can't r-remember to do a s-s-s-imple spell!" Hermione wailed. "I-I-I'm going m-mental!" </p><p>"Granger, you've always been mental, you didn't need this to prove it." He pulled a handkerchief from his pocket and tossed it into her lap. </p><p>"You've got to be joking." She sniffed, picking it up and mopping her face with it. </p><p>"Cheer up, Granger. Everyone forgets about magic from time to time, even you. You're allowed-" </p><p>"Don't you dare say it's because I'm a muggle-born." Hermione threatened. </p><p>"I wasn't going to. I was going to say it's because you've got enough crammed into that head of yours." </p><p>"Oh." She blinked up at him. "<em>Oh." </em></p><p><em>"</em>What?"</p><p>"What is happening?"</p><p>Draco sulked a moment. Hermione offered the handkerchief and he pocketed it. </p><p>"I don't know. Slip of the moment, I guess. Should I stop and go back to my usual git demeanor?"</p><p>"Suit yourself." Hermione replied, picking herself back up. </p><p>"Let me walk you back to the tower. Tell me about the homework, and we'll forget this ever happened." Draco offered. Hermione scoffed and rolled her eyes. </p><p>"Fine. But we better not get caught by anyone." </p><p>"I'm sure I can start insulting you and make a clever exit if they do." </p><p>They started up the grand staircase, waiting for their section to move and then continuing up. </p><p>"Speaking of seeing others, where is your usual retinue?" Hermione asked. </p><p>"Crabbe and Goyle? Wouldn't be caught dead in a library. They're probably lazing around the common room or in bed already." </p><p>"What were you doing in the library?" Hermione asked. </p><p>"That's where they keep the books, Granger, don't you know?" The sarcasm crept back into his voice, but instead of biting back, Hermione chuckled. They climbed onto the staircase that floated to the Gryffindor landing.</p><p>"The striped knoxroot gives three distillations, one that is key in memory potions, one that is a bang-up cure for warts, and one that is poisonous. The correct distillation depends on the temperature it reaches before heat is removed." Hermione listed off. </p><p>"Memories, warts, poisons. Who would think. I loathe Potions." Draco grumbled. "Snape has no business making us write a foot and a half on this."</p><p>"You sound like Ron." Hermione quipped, chuckling again. </p><p>"Don't compare us, please. I'll say something nasty." Draco replied, allowing himself a smirk. </p><p>The staircase suddenly bucked, sending them both into the railing. Hermione lost her footing and fell hard against Draco, who lost his footing and slid down the steps into the endcap railing. The staircase gave one more shudder, then fell still and connected to the Gryffindor landing.</p><p>"Alright there, Granger?" Draco asked. </p><p>"Draco..." Hermione whispered, staring up at him. He lost his train of thought as his body processed how close she was to him. How she wasn't currently struggling to get away. How she subtly shifted closer. How her eyes fell on his lips. He felt a bolt of warmth and arousal shoot through his body.</p><p>"Erm, Granger? What was that about dying for a shag?"</p><p>"Malfoy... yes." She moaned. </p><p>"Prefect's bathroom?" He asked, yanking at his tie to loosen it. </p><p>"Yes..." She breathed, closing the distance between their mouths. She tasted like cinnamon and smelled like ink and parchment. It was absolutely intoxicating. </p><p>They managed to make it down another two staircases and down the 5th floor corridor, pausing every couple steps to lock lips again. Her hands were roaming everywhere, mussing up his hair, squeezing his arse, undoing buttons of his shirt. Merlin's beard, with how loud they were moaning it was a miracle they didn't wake the whole castle. </p><p>"Spring storm." Hermione panted at the 4th door, and it opened into a mercifully empty bathroom. She yanked Draco in by his shirt and he eagerly pressed her up against the nearest wall, knee in between her thighs. </p><p>Hermione sighed as he ground into her, allowing his tongue into her mouth. She frenched him eagerly before pushing him back and resuming disrobing him. Their robes fell into a puddle at their feet, followed by her jumper and button-up. She shivered as her bare back met the stone wall, but ignored it and began attacking his neck with relish once she finished his buttons. He focused on rubbing his knee against her pussy and getting her bra straps off her shoulders. </p><p>"Fuck... ugh..." Hermione groaned as he pinched her nipples. </p><p>"You like it rough, Granger?" Draco asked, surprised by her eagerness. </p><p>"Yes. Talk dirty to me." Hermione groaned in between kisses. Malfoy felt thunderstuck. Granger liked it rough and filthy? His treat. </p><p>"Up." He commanded, picking her up and pinning her back to the wall, grinding his hips against hers and kissing hard enough to bruise. </p><p>"Oh, yes. Yes." She panted. "More." </p><p>He shoved a hand in between them to roughly handle her breasts, biting at her neck and then sucking hard. She'd have marks later. She rolled her hips on his, making him groan. </p><p>"Let me down. I need you." Hermione panted. He dropped her legs and shoved his hand in her panties, not surprised to feel her wet. He went straight for two fingers inside, then backtracked to swipe across her clit with his thumb. He alternated between fingering and jerking her clit, keeping his lips on hers as they kissed sloppily.</p><p>"Oh, yes. Draco. Finger me like that." She panted, arching her back when he pressed his fingers towards the front of her vagina. "Right there."</p><p>"You're so wet, Granger. You like me handling you rough. You want my fingers in your greedy snatch." </p><p>"Oh, yes." She whined, letting her head fall back. </p><p>"I'm going to fuck you so hard you see stars." Draco growled, pulling away and turning her around. She braced herself on the wall as he ripped her panties down around her ankles. </p><p>"You like to be spanked?" He asked, already knowing the answer.</p><p>"God, yes!" Hermione cried. He hiked her skirt up a little and brought one palm down on her arse, the slap echoing around the bathroom. He pulled down his zipper and gave himself a couple quick strokes before spitting into his hand and swirling it around the head. Hermione spread her legs, quivering in anticipation. He drew his dick through her wet folds, lubing up the tip before giving a short experimental thrust. She took him in a little more every couple of short thrusts, until he gave a full thrust and seated himself inside. Their combined moans filled the bathroom with echoes. </p><p>"Move, Malfoy. I need your dick." Hermione demanded. </p><p>"Quiet, Witch." Draco hissed, giving her arse another spank and earning a lewd moan from her lips. He started to pump in and out of her, thighs slapping against each other. </p><p>"You like that?" He panted, canting his hips so he could aim towards the spot he already knew most witches liked. </p><p>"Oh-oh-oh..." Hermione cried, legs shaking. He could feel her thighs leaking onto his from how wet she was. He reached up and took a solid hold on her bushy hair, pulling it enough to be felt, but not that she would be in excruciating pain. </p><p>"Draco!" She cried in surprise and arousal, quickly followed by moans. </p><p>"That's it, ride my dick, Granger. Filthy witch like yourself wants it rough." </p><p>Draco let go of her hair and swatted her arse again before reaching around and jerking on her clit. Hermione let out a little scream. </p><p>"Fuck, Granger, I'm going to cum. Get down on your knees." Draco demanded. Hermione dropped to the floor and took him all the way into her mouth before he even had time to process the loss of warmth. He was finishing before he knew it. She swallowed and let him go, wiping her mouth. </p><p>"Fuck." Was all Draco could say. "You look utterly... debauched." Hermione flushed, pulling her sweaty hair off her neck. She began looking around for her clothes. </p><p>"Wait a moment, you didn't finish." Draco said. </p><p>"Erm, well, it's a bit different for witches, don't you know." She replied, avoiding his eyes. </p><p>"I'm well aware." Draco rolled his eyes. "Lay back."</p><p>"I-I don't know, Draco... It's... I've... well-"</p><p>"Shut up and lay back, Granger. Don't make me force you to enjoy yourself." </p><p>Hermione sat back, knees drawn up to her chest. Draco gave her shoulder a small push. She went down reluctantly, and he prodded her knees apart. </p><p>"I can't allow my flawless reputation with witches be tarnished, I don't care how good the shag was." He growled, sliding his hands up her thighs and gently kneading them. "What do you like?"</p><p>"Erm... I don't really know." </p><p>"Merlin's beard, woman, do you not masturbate?" </p><p>"Well, yes. But that's different. It's different with guys." </p><p>"You've never had a bloke get you off?" </p><p>"No, I haven't." Hermione's brown eyes finally met his. He saw her apprehensiveness. </p><p>"Try to relax, imagine it's your hands on yourself, and direct me with your voice. I can take it." </p><p>"O-Okay..." </p><p>He stroked either side of her with delicate touches before sliding two fingers inside, reaching for the same point as before. He let his thumb stroke over her clit just gently, increasing pressure. </p><p>"Can I go in with my mouth, I'm much better with my tongue." </p><p>"Sure..." She sighed. The moan as he tongued her clit was the loudest yet. </p><p>"I take it you like that. You like the idea of Draco Malfoy tonguing you." He said against her thigh before delving back in. Her fingers found his hair and held on for dear life. </p><p>"Harder..." She panted as he crooked his fingers and pulled up, searching for her spot. He sucked hard on her clit, flicking it with his tongue. </p><p>"Oh-oh-oh..." She groaned. "I think I'm getting closer, Merlin, oh-"</p><p>Malfoy pulled away and jittered the flat of his hand as fast as he could, roughing her clit. The spasms started, increased, and broke as Hermione's orgasm hit her like a train. </p><p>"Oh, dear lord." She panted as she came down. "I didn't know it could be like that." </p><p>"Like I said, reputation." Draco said, planting a final kiss to her winking pussy. </p><p>"Merlin's Beard." Hermione said, covering her face in her hands. "What just happened." </p><p>"You said you were dying for a shag, and I obliged." Draco replied, standing and pulling his trousers up. Hermione tugged at her panties, then swiveled her skirt on correctly. He tossed her bra at her and began doing up his buttons. They dressed in silence, then stood awkwardly, neither wanting to be the first to leave. </p><p>"Well then. Erm, this was fun." Hermione finally said, shifting awkwardly between her feet. Who was she kidding, she felt like a million galleons from how good that fuck had been, but she had no idea how they were supposed to proceed. </p><p>"Let's just leave, this is awkward enough without small talk. And don't forget the contraceptive charm." Draco drawled. </p><p>"Right, right. Erm, well. See you." </p><p>"See you." </p><p>Hermione cast the contraceptive charm and then waited five minutes after Draco left to exit the bathroom and make her way upstairs. She made it to the portrait hole with only moments to spare before curfew. </p><p>"Bandersnatch." She said to the Fat Lady. </p><p>"Quite." the Portrait replied absently. </p><p>She waved at Harry and Ron tiredly but went right up to the Girl's dormitory, splashing some water on her face in the bathroom before changing into her pajamas. The others were all asleep already. </p><p>Hermione was just selecting a book to read from her trunk when she heard a tapping at the window. An eagle owl was fluttering outside, note clutched in its beak. She quickly let it in before it woke up the other girls. </p><p>
  <em>Granger - </em>
</p><p>
  <em>I cannot remember the properties of that bloody root. It would appear you sucked all cohesive thought out through my dick. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Do it again. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>D.M.</em>
</p><p>Hermione red and re-read the note, her cheeks flooding with red. Her pussy gave an unsolicited clench. What had she been thinking, shagging Malfoy? And why was he sending her a note afterwards? This was not normal at all. What would Harry and Ron think of her shagging Malfoy? They would think she was mental. And maybe she was, but the sex was so good... and she wanted it, so badly...</p><p>Before she could stop herself, Hermione grabbed a pencil off her desk and jotted a reply. </p><p>
  <em>Malfoy - </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Only if I come twice next time.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>H.J.G.</em>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>
