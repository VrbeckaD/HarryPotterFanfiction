    <p>The shop was full, and maneuvering through a crowd like this would have been difficult regardless. But the bushy haired girl, carrying 4 coffees and a particularly thick iron wrought, no. 8 cauldron full of books, found this a greater challenge. She cursed herself for not having put the items in her little handbag, but muggle habits die hard.</p><p>As she made to turn the corner, she misstepped, and a shelf of Peruvian Instant Darkness powder hit the ground, in what she considered later to be a rather dramatic crash.</p><p>Crouching quickly, attempting to crawl her way out of the cloud of dust, coughing, eyes watering, Hermione was suddenly hit with a not-so-distant-enough memory. As if punched square in the chest, her eyes swelled with even more tears, but she pushed herself forward. Doing her best to focus on the clear space a few feet ahead of her, the shadow of an old terror continued to impress itself, as if the danger was immediate and present.</p><p>Finally making it out, the witch tried forcing herself to breathe in clean air while her heart was busy beating its way out of her throat. She could feel her thoughts bearing down on her like a heavy weight, and accepting the futility of her effort, quickly made her way behind the front desk and through a door to the back room.</p><p>The room was as messy as its owners, with a few touches of attempted organization thanks to the sole Weasley daughter. She had left her mark in the form of a large silver card magicked to a shelf that said <strong>'<em>I fucking tried' </em></strong>in bold blue letters, that no one seemed able to remove.</p><p>Making her way behind a particularly large pile of boxes, Hermione found solace in a hidden corner. Falling to the floor, back against the wall, she shoved the cauldron into her little beaded bag.</p><p><em> ‘Don’t,’ </em> she thought to herself. <em> ‘Don’t.’  </em></p><p>Closing her eyes, she tried her best to breathe in. Out. In. Out. But the weight of the memory was stronger, and giving up, she curled herself around her knees and buried her face.</p><p> </p>

    <em> Hermione and Ron turned the corner, just as they heard a voice scream. </em>
  </p>
  <p dir="ltr" align="left">
    <em> “ HELP!” Percy cried. “HELP PLEASE!” </em>
  </p>
  <p dir="ltr" align="left">
    <em> The pair ran over, and, without hesitation, Ron was down on his knees with the estranged brother, attempting to pull off a huge wall of bricks lying on top of the left half of Fred Weasley. </em>
  </p>
  <p dir="ltr" align="left">
    <em> Hermione stared for a second before remembering herself and, using her wand to pull the wall off Fred, she knelt down to feel for his pulse. It was the faintest beat, but it was enough. Doing her best not to be distracted by the fractured bone sticking out of his shoulder, or the gaping hole where his cheek had been, now hanging from his jaw, she set to work. </em>
  </p>
  <p dir="ltr" align="left">
    <em> “Accio dittany. Accio frog skin. Accio goldenrod. Accio stinksap. Here,” she said shoving the dittany at Ron, and the frog skin at Percy. “Ron apply the dittany to his face, USE A CLEANING SPELL FIRST. The one I taught you after Gring— yes that’s the one. Make sure you get in deep. Percy, as soon as he does that, you need to place the dry skin over the hole. The essence will help it stick down, like a bandage of sorts. Liberally apply the stinksap on top.” </em>
  </p>
  <p dir="ltr" align="left">
    <em> She then turned her attention to his shoulder. The bone that was sticking out was clearly splintered and she wondered if it wasn’t missing more than was obvious to her amatuer eye. She thought of 12 year old Harry and made the split decision to simply remove the bones from his arm, doing her best to not accidentally magic away his ribs. </em>
  </p>
  <p dir="ltr" align="left">
    <em> “HERMIONE WHAT—“ Ron started, but Percy shushed him, realizing what she was trying to do.  </em>
  </p>
  <p dir="ltr" align="left">
    <em> “I know a few stitching spells from mum but they’re for clothes, not skin,” Percy offered. </em>
  </p>
  <p dir="ltr" align="left">
    <em> “It’ll have to do,” she said, moving to place a few spells over his lungs, hoping they weren’t too damaged.  </em>
  </p>
  <p dir="ltr" align="left">
    <em> She turned to the now very pale faced Ron, who she found was much better at defensive dueling than he was at healing. </em>
  </p>
  <p dir="ltr" align="left">
    <em> “Can you shield us while we lift him to where Madam Pomfrey is stationed?” </em>
  </p>
  <p dir="ltr" align="left">
    <em> He nodded.</em>
  </p>
  <p dir="ltr" align="left"> </p>
</blockquote><p>Hermione remembered the look on Madam Pomfrey’s face when they brought Fred in. She had been busy working with the other healers, expanding the space, conjuring more beds, brewing potions. She told them she could use quick thinking magic like that, but Hermione had to decline, she had other priorities that day. Percy, however, stayed behind, which he would later mark as the beginning of his career in healing. It was a story he liked to tell and one to which Ron or Ginny always replied with, “who knew such an anal git, could find such a calling?” Which always sent the twins off on some long winded discourse full of butt jokes.</p><p>Hermione chuckled, recalling one particularly funny line involving a pixie on Uranus, when a red head popped her head around the wall of boxes. </p><p>“Hey,” she said quietly, sitting down and filling the space with a light scent of gunpowder and honey.</p><p>“Hey,” the brunette whispered back.</p><p>“You left your coffee on the counter,” she said, and Hermione noticed Ginny was holding two cups in her hands. “You good?”</p><p>“Of course.”</p><p>“Your face is covered in powder.” Ginny transfigured a sign on the wall beside them into a mirror. </p><p>Hermione looked at herself. Gray soot covered her, the creases of her face, and her hair, which also seemed to be bigger than usual.</p><p>Ginny muttered a quick incantation and twirled her wand, tapping her friend on the nose.</p><p>“One of the girls on the team taught me that,” she added, while Hermione stared amazed at the mirror.</p><p>“There’s not a single... wow. I think my face actually feels cleaner than it did before. How are THE Harpies by the way,” she teased, wiggling her shoulders and exaggerating the name.</p><p>“Oh, shut up,” Ginny rolled her eyes, but let a smile slip. “I’m too new to be anywhere but the bench for now. But the practices are amazing. Do kinda wish they’d stop trying to make me seeker during practice, though.”</p><p>“Well, the way I hear it, you’re pretty fair at catching the snitch.”</p><p>“So, I beat Harry a few times,” she shrugged. “Between you and me, I think he lets me win.”</p><p>“Between you and me,” Hermione shot back laughing, “I’ve seen Harry after those wins you pull, and he is not letting you win.”</p><p>As the laughter settled, the two girls sat in silence, sipping their drinks. Hermione enjoyed the company, and the distraction from what would have been an otherwise unending panic attack. </p><p>She and Ginny had always been close. But after the battle, when they both returned to Hogwarts to finish up their N.E.W.T year,  they became closer. </p><p> </p>

  <p>
    <em> The Ministry, now headed by Kingsley Shacklebolt, had offered students a variety of options to mitigate the damage done to their education during the Carrow takeover of Hogwarts. Kingsley brought in the Golden Trio to his office, wishing to speak with them personally. He ended up offering them a sort of fast track to Aurorship, should they want it. </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em> “Of course,” he had said, “you would still need to undergo several additional tests, in lieu of providing us with N.E.W.T scores. But if you wanted it, we would certainly work to make it possible.” </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em> Hermione declined, knowing should she later choose to go that route, it would still be within her options. The boys unsurprisingly leapt at the chance to move beyond academia, to which she was obligated to reprimand them. </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em> It would be a much different year at Hogwarts without them, though they came by often to train on the grounds or in the forest with certain professors. </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em> She found herself often sitting in study groups with Neville, Luna, Ginny, Dean, and Seamus. And as time moved away from the battle, life began to feel more regular. </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em> There were little dramas here and there, like Pavarti dating Dean and then breaking up and dating Ernie Macmillan. A few common room nights involving fire whiskey. </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em> One drunken night in particular, the D.A. members still in attendance at the school snuck into the room Firenze briefly taught Divination, for a reunion. Seamus, looking for the fireworks stash, happened to stumble over a couple that turned out to be none other than Dean Thomas and Luna Lovegood. </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>“She’s absolutely mad,” Dean said about her the next day. “It’s a bit frightening, yeah. But if you listen long enough, it begins to make sense. Must be the Ravenclaw in her. She‘ll make a brilliant unspeakable.”</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em> Ginny and Hermione also found their friendship growing, spending a lot of late nights discussing what the other did during that long year leading up to the battle. </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em> “You really didn’t want to be an Auror, then?” Ginny asked. “Even I consider it some days.” </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em> “Well, why don’t you?” Hermione questioned back. </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em> “The Order still needs people,” she replied simply. “Voldemort may be gone, but he wasn’t the only dark wizard out there. It’s always helpful to have its members in different fields, keep an eye on things more thoroughly.” </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em> “That’s how I feel, too. And let’s not kid ourselves, Kingsley may be Minister, and sure there’s marked improvement in the Ministry, but it sometimes feels like they’re discovering more and more internal threats every day.” </em>
