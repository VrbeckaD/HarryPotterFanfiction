    <p>"Alright everyone. That was a good meeting. Kingsley, make sure you have your team ready for the raid on Tuesday. Severus, be careful at the next Death Eater meeting. Molly, you said dinner would be ready in five minutes?" Harry stood at the head of the table at Grimmauld Place, headquarters of the Order. At his last thought he turned to the Weasley matriarch who nodded politely. He sent a quick glance at his wife, Ginny. She tilted her head towards the couple near the end of the table, they were talking quietly to each other, their bodies each turned to the other. "Hermione. Draco."</p><p>The two jumped and looked guiltily towards their leader. Hermione spoke first, "Yes Harry?"</p><p>"Would you two please go and grab a couple more chairs for the table? Andromeda is supposed to be bringing Teddy over for dinner." Tonks turned from talking with her husband at the mention of her mother and son.</p><p>"Wotcher Harry, let me just conjure a couple..." Her husband tugged her arm and she stopped talking. He gave her a pointed look and her hair turn red in embarrassment. "Oh. Uh. Nevermind then. You two hurry up."</p><p>Hermione and Draco both gave her a questioning look but quietly stood and left the room.</p><p>"Finally!" Harry clapped his hands when he was sure they were out of earshot. "We only have a couple minutes before they come back."</p><p>"Unless they decide to just up and snog on their way to get the chairs." Fred joked to his twin.</p><p>"Right, have you seen the way they've been looking at each other recently?" George returned.</p><p>"Oi! Pay attention!" Ron whacked the twin closest to him. "That's what we're here to talk about, remember?"</p><p>"Don't get your knickers in a twist Ronniekins." George rubbed his arm.</p><p>"We were only joking," Fred agreed.</p><p>Harry shook his head at the men. "Anyway, we're here because Draco and Hermione have been mooning over each other for the past month and most of us are sick of it. We need them to realize how they both feel and just snog already."</p><p>"Are we sure that we want Hermione to be with someone like Draco?" Marina, a rather new member of the Order, asked from her spot next to Ron. "I mean he is a Malfoy after all."</p><p>"Marina dear," Ron placed his arm on the back of her chair. "Malfoy came to our side five years ago, right before sixth year. He wanted nothing to do with Voldemort."</p><p>"And he's proven that time and time again. Now about those two..." Harry started but was interrupted by a loud noise from upstairs. All eyes turned upward.</p><p>"What do you think they're doing up there?" Ginny asked quietly. The twins turned to her and wagged their eyebrows.</p><p>"Wouldn't you like to know," They spoke in unison.</p><p>"Boys!" Molly was outraged at the insinuation. "Now, everyone, we have to bring the two together. Brainstorm ideas and bring them to the meeting next week. We'll find something to keep them out of the room longer that time."</p><p>Harry silently thanked Molly for taking over that part of the conversation. A few moments later Draco and Hermione reentered the kitchen with two chairs. They looked at the silent group. "Anything happen while we were gone?"</p><p>#WHAT HAPPENED UPSTAIRS#</p><p>"Do you think they can hear us?" Hermione whispered as they reached the first landing.</p><p>"Of course not, besides they're probably gossiping too much to listen to us anyway." Her male companion turned towards her. She saw the smirk on Draco's face and instantly knew what he was about to do. "I don't know Dray, what if someone comes up to help us?"</p><p>"No one's going to come help us. We're just grabbing a couple chairs. Now, come here." He demanded, his arms going wide. Hermione sent him a smirk of her own before stepping into his embrace. The couple stood for a moment, just happy to be in each other's arms. "I hate those meetings. It's just an hour I can't do this."</p><p>Draco kissed Hermione slowly, deeply. Their actions soon became quicker, needier, more passionate. He pushed her into the wall, determined to take her in the hallway, forgetting that others were in the house and they were on a mission. However, his hasty movements had them crashing into the wall creating a loud bang that reverberated through the whole house. Hermione broke away.</p><p>"I guess that's the end of that." She stated after a few moments of silence, untangling herself from his arms. "We'd best be getting those chairs."</p><p>The secret couple started up the stairs again, hand in hand, stealing kisses as they made their way to the room with the extra chairs. They grabbed two and hurried back to kitchen where everyone turned to watch their entrance.</p><p>"Anything happen while we were gone?"</p><p>"Nothing at all." The order members shared a knowing smile. Harry kept speaking. "What took you both so long?"</p><p>"Oh uh nothing." The couple stuttered and mumbled, both turning red. They were rescued from further embarrassment by the arrival of Teddy and Andromeda. The little boy with turquoise hair yelled. "I'm here!"</p><p>The couple under scrutiny smiled gratefully at the child. Draco picked him up and Hermione ruffled his hair. "Yes you are, Buddy. Thank goodness you are."</p>
