<p>Escape Plan</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Severus’ mouth dropped open. “Excuse me?” </p>
<p>“You heard him.” Narcissa’s voice was steely. “We wish to escape the Dark Lord.” </p>
<p>“How do I know this isn’t a trap?” Severus asked. </p>
<p>“You don’t,” said Lucius. “But if it were, you’d be able to tell by reading our minds, would you not?”</p>
<p>Severus raised an eyebrow. “And you would allow this?”</p>
<p>“To keep Narcissa and my son safe?” Lucius scowled. “Of course.” </p>
<p>Severus nodded. “And you?” he said to Narcissa. “Would you allow me to look into your mind to read your intentions?” </p>
<p>Narcissa paled, but lifted her chin. “If I must.” </p>
<p>~</p>
<p>“And you believe them?” </p>
<p>“I Legilimised them.” </p>
<p>Kingsley whistled. “This isn’t something I can decide. Albus is head of the Order.” </p>
<p>“He’ll insist on payment.” </p>
<p>“Or he may just help them to help them.” </p>
<p>Severus snorted. “We’ll see.”</p>
<p>Sitting back, Kingsley regarded Severus for a moment. “What did Albus do to you?” </p>
<p>Severus looked away. “There’s no time to discuss that now. The larger question is, where to hide them?”</p>
<p>Kingsley nodded. “I have an idea, although they will have to agree.” </p>
<p>“I’m sure they will.” Severus recalled the desperation he’d seen in Lucius mind. “What’s your idea?” </p>
<p>“Upper Flagely.” </p>
<p>~</p>
<p>“This looks like a sleepy, retirement community,” said Severus, looking around. </p>
<p>“Where better to hide?” Kingsley countered. “My great-aunt lives here, and, as she’s quick to tell me whenever I visit, nothing exciting happens in Upper Flagely.” </p>
<p>“If the Dark Lord tracks Lucius and Narcissa here, things will get very exciting rather quickly,” Severus muttered. </p>
<p>“Then we’ll need to ensure they are not tracked here.” Kingsley crossed his arms. “Be sure this isn’t a trap, Severus. I have family here. I don’t want them placed in danger.”  </p>
<p>“Understood.” Severus sighed. “What’s next?”</p>
<p>“We clear it with Albus.”</p>
<p>“If we must.”</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>After Kingsley presented the plan, Dumbledore turned to Severus. “And you’re willing to vouch for the Malfoys?”</p>
<p>“I’ve examined their…motivations, so yes, I am.” </p>
<p>“Very well.” Dumbledore nodded. “We’ll require information, naturally, but if they cooperate, I see no reason we cannot proceed with your plan.” He smiled. “Upper Flagely is charming.”</p>
<p>“And if they have no useful information?” Severus asked. “Or they refuse to betray the Dark Lord?”</p>
<p>Dumbledore’s smile faded. “Then they should seek assistance elsewhere. Do you believe they’ll refuse?” </p>
<p>“No.” Severus smirked at Kingsley. “I was just curious to see what your answer would be.” </p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Once Dumbledore left the Upper Flagely pub, Kingsley sighed. “I knew Albus was ruthless, but—”</p>
<p>“Surprised?” Severus snorted. “Dumbledore’s the ultimate manipulator. Since he agreed to shelter the Malfoys, be assured he expects a lot in return.” </p>
<p>Kingsley hummed. “We’ve a few minutes. Tell me what Albus did to you.” </p>
<p>Eyeing his empty cup, Severus sighed. “I’ll need a refill for this.” </p>
<p>Kingsley smiled. “Something tells me I will too.” </p>
<p>Once they had new drinks, Severus leaned forward. “I’m telling you this not for sympathy, but because you need to know what kind of person Dumbledore is.” </p>
<p>Kingsley nodded. “Proceed.” </p>
<p>~</p>
<p>When Severus finished speaking, Kingsley was silent. “And they weren’t punished?” he finally asked, voice low.</p>
<p>Severus, on his third drink, laughed bitterly. “His pet Gryffindors? Please. Nothing got them more than the occasional detention, including my near death.” </p>
<p>“Severus. I’m so sorry.” Kingsley clasped his hand and squeezed. “That must’ve been awful.”</p>
<p>The pulse of awareness that went up Severus’ arm made his breath hitch. He swallowed hard. “Thank you. And it was.” </p>
<p>“So if Albus apologised—”</p>
<p>“He wouldn’t.” </p>
<p>“But if he did,” Kingsley persisted, “you’d…forgive him?”</p>
<p>Severus snorted. “I wouldn’t believe him, so no.” </p>
<p>Kingsley nodded. “Good.” </p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Severus stared at Kingsley. “What?”</p>
<p>Kingsley hummed. “I fancy men who value themselves. I understand now why you don’t trust Albus, and I agree with your reasons.” </p>
<p>“But?”</p>
<p>“No buts. Albus is focussed, to the detriment of people. He’s a decent general, but not the best friend.” Kingsley’s eyes hardened. “Lily, however, should know how much her defection hurt you.”</p>
<p>Severus tried to pull back. “I never said—”</p>
<p>“You didn’t have to.” Leaning in, Kingsley kissed Severus’ fingers. “I could tell. Now, shall we leave Upper Flagely?”</p>
<p>“And go where?” Severus whispered. </p>
<p>Kingsley’s smile was sharp. “Where do you think?”</p>
