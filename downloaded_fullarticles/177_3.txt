</p><p>Stretched across the sofa in the beige, generic living room of a shared student apartment, in one of her university's four halls of residence, and with every intention of courting a reaction, Lily Evans lifted her knees and moved her feet out of James Potter's lap.</p><p>Immediately, without looking at her or the television they were supposed to be watching, James placed his phone on the arm of the sofa, took hold of her feet with both hands and moved them back.</p><p>"Watch the movie," he absently instructed, returning his attention to his phone.</p><p>Lily smiled.  </p><p align="center">
