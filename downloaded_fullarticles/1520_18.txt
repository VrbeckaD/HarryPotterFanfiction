    <p>“And you’re sure the curse will work?”  The voice beneath the voluminous hood sounded both frightened and hopeful.</p><p>The old witch cackled.  “So long as the sample of hair you brought belongs to whom you claim it does.  I have never failed to deliver an effective curse… especially not when the young lady has paid such Galleons for it.”  She barked another laugh as the hooded figure started.  “Did you think you could fool Old Mildred with your form-hiding cloak—made from the softest velvet, the reason I even considered listening to your request—and poorly disguised voice?  Only young lasses would have such fiery hatred as to wish ill on a competitor for a stripling’s affections.”</p><p>“He’s not a strip—”</p><p>“Ah!  Think you’re wise to the ways of the world, do you, girl?  I’ve seen further into the darkest recesses of the human heart than your pretty head could fathom.  You be careful how you use Old Mildred’s spell.  Your heart’s desire may yet remain unfulfilled.  The greatest mages have failed to bottle love and control hatred for good reason.”</p><p>“Oh, shut it, you old hag!  If you were that powerful, you wouldn’t need to live in this hovel in the filthiest corner of Knockturn Alley.”</p><p>The witch Mildred laughed her raspy laugh, not in the least put out.  “You think I couldn’t live as grand as you?  I <i>chose</i> to leave that silly life you cling so dearly to because it contained too many petty bitches like you.  You run along, now.  Knockturn Alley after dark is no place for a delicate blossom like you.”  And with that, she disappeared into the inner room.</p><p>The cloaked figure hesitated but then stomped out of the tiny abode, slamming the door behind her.</p>

</center>“What did the Head Healer say?” Pansy nearly stumbled as she stepped out of the fireplace.<p>Hermione burst into tears.  Pansy grabbed her in a tight hug and did her best to soothe.  She looked up at her best friend and frowned at his expression.  </p><p>“He’s been cursed.  And there’s nothing they can do but monitor and make sure he doesn’t suffer too much.”  </p><p>“What!  But—they caught all the Death Eaters, didn’t they?  Who have you offended so badly that they’d wish harm on an innocent child?”</p><p>“The question is: where’s your sense of decency?”</p><p>Pansy stiffened.  “What do you mean by that, Draco Malfoy?”</p><p>“Draco, don’t…”  Hermione wiped away her tears.  “It’s circumstantial.  She would never—”</p><p>“She threatened to <i>Crucio</i> you if I so much as asked you out on a date!”</p><p>Pansy’s jaw dropped.  She was before him in a few steps.  She slapped him.  “If you hadn’t broken up with me the way you did, you insufferable prat, I wouldn’t’ve said those things!  There isn’t a day when I don’t wish I could take those words back!  And you think that <i>I</i>—he’s my godson!”</p><p>Draco rubbed his cheek and glared murderously.  He clenched his fist and took a few deep breaths.  In a voice of forced calm, he said, “Do you deny that you took a lock of his hair?”</p><p>“<i>That’s</i> what you—Fine!  Here!”  She removed the locket from beneath her robes and extracted the golden strands secured within.  She grabbed his hand and placed the knot of hair into his palm.  “I only wanted something to look at when I think about him.  But if you’re so convinced that I would wish any harm on him, then I have no words except <i>good-bye</i>!”</p><p>As the “FOOM” died, Draco sat down heavily beside his wife.  “This day just keeps getting better.  I know: I overreacted.  But she could have just asked for it!”</p><p>“You know she sometimes gets impulsive.  She probably didn’t consider we might react negatively until after she’d cut the lock, and then she was too scared to tell us.”</p><p>“But if it wasn’t her…”</p><p>“I’d like nothing more than to hex whoever is responsible into oblivion.  But that’d be wasted energy and time away from Aneirin.  We don’t know how much longer—”</p><p>“Shhh-shhhhh!  I’m sorry.”  He rubbed her back.  “You’re right.  I’m focussing on the wrong thing.  It’s almost time for his nap.  Let’s tuck him in together?”</p>

  <p>~*~*~*~</p>
</center>The faces around the Weasley kitchen table were varying shades of ferocious red.  Ron slammed his fist so hard against the table that the wood wobbled.<p>“We’ll catch the bastard, ’Mione!  He’s going to wish he was never born!” he declared.</p><p>“I’ll speak to Kingsley first thing tomorrow.  He won’t refuse my request to use all available resources,” said Harry stoutly.</p><p>“I’ll look at some of the old tomes in Mungo’s library,” Susan promised. </p><p>“And you’re <i>sure</i> Parkinson…” Ginny asked through clenched teeth.</p><p>“I’m sure, Gin.  Crookshanks likes her, you know.  And having gotten to know her these past two years, she’s only bitchy for show.  It’s a Slytherin thing, I think.”  </p><p>“Ha, bloody ha,” said Draco.  A few days had not reconciled him to the fact that he could lose his son at any moment, but it had tempered some of his initial rage.  The smashing of several priceless vases had helped as well.</p><p>“Well, I’m going to investigate her, just for my own peace of mind.  If I find out she’s behind it…”</p><p>“If I’m wrong about her, Gin, I promise you can have the first shot, but you also have to promise you’ll keep her alive so Draco and I can have our turns.”</p><p>“Oh, don’t you worry.  Everyone at this table will have a crack at her before I’d even consider being merciful.”</p><p>“Have you upgraded your protective wards around the house?”  Arthur asked, though his usually calm voice held a tremor.  </p><p>Hermione nodded.  “Lucius spent a whole day scouring the private library for the strongest blood wards.  He disappeared without a word since yesterday morning.  If she weren’t so concerned about looking after the three of us, I’m sure Narcissa would either have joined him or gone on the hunt herself.”</p><p>“Well, I’ll Floo her after this and see if she’d be willing to let me help look after things,” Molly chimed in.  “We all need to be in the best shape to dish out punishment when we catch the blaggard.”</p><p>There was a chorus of volunteers to share in the burden of watching over the baby.  Hermione gave a tearful thanks.  She pressed kisses to her son’s head and hugged him close.  He had been in an almost constant state of drowsiness as a result of the potion that was slowing down the effects of the curse.  He gave a sleepy gurgle.</p><p>“Hey, Malfoy!  Care to help us de-gnome the garden?  See who can toss them farthest?”  </p><p>“Yeah, all those threats about hexes and jinxes during Quidditch, but can you even throw a punch?”</p><p>Draco snorted.  “You’re on, Tweedles!  The trick to superior hand-eye coordination is enough brain power.”</p><p>“Guess that means Harry’s got a bigger brain than you!”</p><p>Hermione gave a watery chuckle.  “He almost Sorted into Slytherin, you know.”</p><p>“Hermione!”</p><p>“Oh, Harry, did you really think that was still a secret?  You shouldn’t tell drunken confessions to Ron, then,” said Ginny. </p><p>“Oi!”</p><p>“Oh, don’t pout, Ron.  Honestly, people’d think <i>you</i> were the Weasley daughter!  Go be useful and help Mum de-gnome the garden.  Or go up to your room and sulk like a baby.”</p><p>Ron huffily joined the other boys in the yard.</p><p>“You girls go into the living room and have a chat.  I can manage here.  No!  Don’t argue!  This is still my house!”  Molly shooed them off.  Arthur put on an apron and proceeded to fill the sink with soapy water.</p><p>“Are you… coping all right, Hermione?  You know that there’s no shame in seeking a Mind Healer if…”  </p><p>“I’m managing so far, Susan, but thanks for your concern.  I know I need to keep myself healthy and strong.  Neir isn’t in any immediate danger and he’s not in pain, not like that night… And—and I need to hold it together for Draco’s sake.  He’s finally reached the limits of his ability to compartmentalize and block off his emotions.  Narcissa’s been keeping a close eye on his every movement.  She said to look out for an involuntary eye twitch.  So far…”</p><p>“This is such cockwombling arsery.”</p><p>“Language, Ginevra!”  called a scolding voice from the kitchen.</p><p>“But it’s true, Mum!  Did you forget you blew Bellatrix to bits for even coming near me?”</p><p>“I managed without your filthy vocabulary, so let that be a lesson.”</p><p>“Yeah, yeah.  Anyway,” Ginny returned her focus and said in a lowered voice, “You know you can always ask me for anything, ’Mione.”</p><p>“And me,” agreed Susan.</p><p>“Thanks, girls.  Meanwhile, just keep an eye on the boys.  I don’t want them exhausting and hurting themselves unnecessarily.”</p><p>“Leave them to us.  You just… keep this little guy happy.”</p><p>“You know that, as long as you take precautions, you can take him out of doors on occasion, Hermione?  Being cooped up in the house, no matter how safe, is not good for either of you.  And… he should be able to experience as much of the world…”</p><p>Hermione nodded.  Aneirin gave a whimper and she checked her watch.  “It’s time for lunch.  I’m really thankful he still has a good appetite.”  At Susan’s hesitation to speak, she replied, “And no.  The Head Healer is fairly certain that the curse, whatever it is, doesn’t get more powerful with physical sustenance.  And he hasn’t increased his appetite all of a sudden.”</p><p>“That’s a small mercy.”</p><p>“Ginny, may I borrow your room to nurse?”</p><p>“’Course.  As if you need ask.  Let me tidy up a bit so you don’t accidently trip over anything.”</p><p>“Maybe Ron really <i>is</i> the Weasley daughter.”</p><p>“Ha! He only keeps his flat clean because he found out the hard way that his socks give off this horrid smell if he leaves them lying around for too long.  And like mould, the smell starts spreading until all his clothes are infected.  Aren’t you so glad you married a ferret with kindly treated house-elves instead?”</p><p>“Oh, shut it, Ginny.”</p>

  <p>~*~*~*~</p>
</center>“How are you holding up?”  Daphne asked as she poured tea.<p>Hermione accepted it with a nod of thanks.  She sighed.  “I’m all right.  I managed a consecutive four hours last night, which is the longest I’ve had since…”</p><p>“You poor dear.  Are you still on leave from Mungo’s?”</p><p>“No, I’ve returned to work.  It helps distract me from my thoughts.  And it’s really not fair to burden the others with my caseload.  They’re busy enough as is.  You know how Mungo’s gets.  And even though the pressure is less because we’re still apprenticing, sometimes we need to make final decisions if the Healers are handling more complex situations.”</p><p>“You’re too good, Hermione.  I don’t know what I would do in your shoes.”</p><p>“I’m sure you would be handling things better than me.  I see how Narcissa is, and that is something that is practised from childhood.  I may not always agree with the attitudes, but there’s no denying that the discipline…”</p><p>“Oh, you put too much stock in good breeding.  It is easily acquired.  I could never have survived in the wilderness like you did.”</p><p>“You’re romanticizing it, like most do who have never had to face the terror of being in such situations.  It’s not as brave as you make it seem.  Too many times, I wished I could just have a nice cup of tea like we’re doing now.”</p><p>“Well, you survived that hardship… and you will survive this one, too.  Now, could I tempt you with one of these salmon sandwiches?”</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>~*~*~*~</p>
</center>The group of friends stared down at the captive in the corner of the room.<p>“Oh, please!  Have mercy!  I didn’t know!”  The huddled figure rocked back and forth, her raspy voice strained.  “She never said it was for a child!  She said she was taking revenge on a lover who’d spurned her!  Please!”</p><p>“You’re lying!” snarled Ron.  “She’s lying!  She started laughing like a madwoman when I told her ol’ Lucius is gonna make sure she dies a slow and horrible death.”</p><p>“No, no!  I laugh when I’m scared!  Have always done!  Ask my sister.  When she threw that Stinging Hex and burned my face, I laughed like she’d given me a Tickling Charm!”  The old witch sobbed.  “Mercy!”</p><p>Hermione came slowly forward and crouched beside the trembling woman.  “Please, can’t you reverse it?”</p><p>“’Tis ancient magic, that spell!  Not easy to stop it once unleashed.  The old ones were merciless.  Ohhhh, poor ol’ Mildred!”</p><p>“But… you’ve studied the curse, you know what it is more than any of us.  Surely you can think of something that could help?”</p><p>“Hermione, why reason with her?  If she had any compassion to begin with, she’d never have plied such a trade.”  Draco dragged Hermione to her feet and made sure Harry guarded her.  He turned to the old witch.  “What do you want, hag?  Money?  Protection from old enemies?  You <i>know</i> the counter-spell.  You wouldn’t’ve let yourself be found otherwise.”</p><p>The witch stood and hissed at him.  “Are you certain you could afford the payment, insolent brat?  Is your son’s life not worth more than all the wealth in the Malfoy vaults?  Old Mildred has outlived her worst enemy, so what can you offer?”</p><p>“If you think either of us would hesitate to exchange our lives for his…”</p><p>“Ah!  Flesh sacrifice.  Yes, you are starting to use your tiny brain cells.  Indeed, one life for another would be a most suitable price… under other circumstances.  But you said it so readily—I don’t know that you value your life that highly if you would give it away in such a hasty manner.  No, I think you will have to give up something more important than your measly life.”</p><p>“So long as it doesn’t harm him nor cause harm or require further sacrifices from any of those who are his family, blood-related or otherwise, then name your price,” said Hermione.</p><p>“Ah!  Your wife is much more clever than you, Malfoy spawn.” She dismissed him with a flick of the eye.  “Now, my pretty, if I were to lift the curse from him completely, would you give up your deep love for him?  Oh, I don’t mean severing ties; a mother’s love can linger from beyond the veil.  You would merely be separated from him.  Not forever, for the bond must be strengthened regularly.  Love is the nastiest of emotions: it is all the stronger and more pure for the separation.  What are a few years, after all, in a lifetime?  He will live to be healthy and happy, possibly have a family of his own.”</p><p>Hermione had gone ashen as the witch laid out her terms.  Her eyes found Draco’s and locked with them.  His silent plea to not heed the witch gave her courage.  She took a long, shuddering breath.</p><p>She turned to look at the witch.  “How long a separation?  How long a reunion?  And he is to remain under the protection of his blood family.”  When the witch nodded and because she couldn’t help herself, Hermione asked, “What will you do with the love you take?  If you use it to cause harm to another in any shape or form, I’d rather smother my son with my own hands.”  </p><p>The witch barked a laugh.  “Always so thoughtful of others.  It’s no wonder even the diamond-cold Malfoy heart thawed before such nobility of spirit.  Ten years apart, ten hours together.  Love is the most potent healing ingredient.  After all the Dark spells that poor Mildred has been forced to perform to subsist in this cruel world, I shall use it on my poor battered body.”</p><p>“Five years and five years,” snapped Draco.</p><p>“Such selfishness!  That would hardly count as true sacrifice.”</p><p>“Six months apart, six months together.”</p><p>“See yourself as being like Hades, do you, whelp?  Yes, that seems right.  You Malfoys were always cold and haughty.  <i>She</i> certainly resembles Persephone. Seven years, seven days.  That is my final offer.”</p><p>“But if you want it for healing, then surely it would be more beneficial if we remained together.  Then you would have a constant source—”</p><p>Before Hermione could finish her attempt to reason, the door crashed open and Lucius and Narcissa rushed in.</p><p>“Ah!  Narcissa Black.  You arrived just in time.  I was making final arrangements for your grandson’s cure.”</p><p>Lucius snarled at her and said sharply to Draco, “Do not promise her anything!  She’s not to be trusted to keep her word.”  And to the witch, he growled, “I thought you already dead, Malice Mildred.”</p><p>She bared her teeth.  “All thanks to your dismissal of my affections, Lucius.  Made me realize I didn’t need to be a shy mouse, to be kicked about.”</p><p>Lucius snorted.  “Always the downtrodden act.  You forget I saw you pluck the feathers one by one from that canary when you were six.  And I warned Rodolphus.  Thankfully, he was never interested in you.”</p><p>Mildred hissed.  “That bitchy Bellatrix laced his pumpkin juice with Amortentia.  I know she did!  All these years, I hoped to get her back, but she hid away in Azkaban and then got herself foolishly killed!  But how fortunate for me that she still has family.  And one of them needs my help.”  She stepped forward and stared greedily at Hermione.  “So, what will it be, my dear?  Will you sacrifice your love for your son’s life?”  </p><p>"Why?"  The question burst from Hermione before she could stop herself.</p><p>Mildred raised a brow.  "Why?  I should ask the same of you.  What is a good Gryffindor girl doing associating with Death Eaters?"  (Narcissa wandlessly held back her husband and son.)  Mildred cocked her head.  "Or perhaps the Malfoy vaults overcame your scruples?"</p><p>"I would advise you not to continue your line of questioning, Mildred Hortense Lyssa Meagher.  I have since perfected that little spell of mine from Fifth Year."  Narcissa's voice was calm but cold.</p><p>Mildred paled but then gave a cackle as she recovered.  "The Dark Lord was a fool to have overlooked you, Narcissa Black.  He would still be alive if you were beside him, whispering proper tactics in his ear."</p><p>Narcissa sniffed but turned her attention to Hermione.  “What has Mildred done, my dear?”  Her composure cracked as she heard of the curse and the witch’s demands.  With an effort, she controlled both herself and the tight leash she held on Lucius and Draco, who were both red-faced.  “One year and seven days.  A mother’s love may be powerful, but it is not without peril.  You risk deterioration if you separate them for longer.  Whatever you may think of me or my family, you should understand when I speak as a mother that it will not benefit you to risk your health for jealousy.”</p><p>Mildred growled and after some consideration, said, “Very well.  It is fortunate that I have never been a mother, if such weakness is the consequence.  Now, my brave girl, I shall need a drop of your blood.”</p><p>“No!” Lucius and Draco shouted; Narcissa stepped forward.</p><p>Mildred took a few steps away from them and quickly reached into an inner pocket, pulling out a lock of golden hair.  She ignited her wand and brought the lock into contact with the flame.  “Decide now or watch his life burn away before your eyes!”  </p><p>A singeing smell began to permeate the air.</p><p>“Stop!  I accept!”  </p><p>The flames were snuffed, revealing a pristine lock of hair.  The fire had been an illusion.</p><p>“Now, I need a drop of blood from you, smeared over this lock of your precious son’s hair, to seal the bargain.”  She grinned in mad satisfaction as Hermione complied.  The blood stain disappeared into the golden strands.  They were then placed inside a small, golden frog-shaped amulet.  “I shall keep this, to ensure that you keep your end of the bargain.  And you may take this to your healer.”  She plopped an ordinary-looking shard of obsidian into Hermione’s hand.  “She will know what to do to remove the curse.”</p><p>She made her way toward the open door.  Several bodies tried to impede her but had to move aside when she waved the amulet in front of their faces.  </p><p>The last person to stand between her and the exit was Narcissa.  </p><p>“And what do you intend to do to save your brat’s spawn, Narcissa Black?”</p><p>“I intend to love him.  It may only be a poor substitute for that of his mother’s, but he will never lack it.  Beware of the power of sacrificial love, Mildred Meagher.  You may find it cuts deeper than the sharpest knife.”</p>
