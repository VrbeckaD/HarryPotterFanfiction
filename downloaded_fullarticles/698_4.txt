    <p>Harry sighed, glancing at the newspaper once more before tossing it onto the already cluttered desk. He took a deep steadying breath as he surveyed his surroundings. Suitcases lay open, as stacks of neatly folded clothes continued to pack themselves into various bags. Twisting his hand in a precise series of motions, books and photographs from the shelves began to pack themselves into boxes and cases as well. </p><p>Dread began to pool in the pit of his stomach. Harry knew that returning to England was the right thing to do, that staying here, staying in this house, this house where so many memories were soured, was not an option. There was no going back on this decision. The Magical Congress of the United States of America had already signed his official transfer papers, making him an employee, once again, of the British Ministry of Magic. It had been seven long years since Harry had stepped foot in England. </p><p>Shaking his head, he turned back to the task at hand. He knew he had less than two hours until his international portkey would activate, and he would be back on English soil. Pulling his American issue auror robes off the bed he quickly got changed. He knew he would be given new ones on his arrival, but for now, these would have to do. Stepping in front of the mirror, he ensured the dark blue robes fell neatly over his shoulders, and he swept a hand through his hair. He wasn’t accustomed to the shortness of it yet. Looking into the mirror, he no longer saw a pale skinny boy looking back at him, instead, he saw a deeply tanned muscular man, who was sure of who he was. The years had been kind to Harry. </p><p>His things mostly packed, Harry sat down tiredly at his desk, moving the newspaper aside. “Scandal! Harry Potter, The Chosen Queer? More on Page Two!”. A brief wave of anger flowed through Harry as he swept the paper into the bin instead, settling instead on the case file in front of him. </p><p>This was the reason he was being pulled back to England. An organisation of witches and wizards had been systematically hunting down ex death eaters and their families and “punishing” them for their crimes, most of whom had already been punished or served lengthy sentences in Azkaban. Around three years ago, when the attacks first started occurring, they were more minor.</p><p>The ministry seemed to turn a blind eye, and most of the attacks went unacknowledged, the after effects of the war still weighing down on many, especially those in the ministry. On the outside, they did their best to make it seem like investigations were underway, but anyone who worked there could tell you that many of the higher up officials, who determined whether or not to address the cases, seemed to think it was some sort of divine retribution that supporters of the dark lord were being punished again.</p><p>Harry flipped through the first section of incident reports, detailing death eaters and their families being the victim of death threats, curses, destruction of property and in rare cases, unforgivables. Most of these incidents were not investigated, and no suspects were documented. Even though this was not the first time Harry read this case file, he felt the anger once again wash over him. It should not have taken years for these cases to be re-opened. </p><p>Turning slowly to the next section, Harry continued to re-read the file. He needed to make sure every piece of information was fresh in his mind. The first documented death caused by this organisation was on the 2nd of May 2006. Just over two years ago, on the eighth anniversary of the end of the second wizarding war. Severe curse damage landed a young woman in St Mungo’s, where she fought for her life for 18 hours before passing away. The woman had not been a death eater, but the wife of one. Eyes skimming down the page, Harry finally found her name. Astoria Malfoy, wife of Draco Lucius Malfoy. </p><p> </p><p>As Harry finished reading the rest of the folder, a disgusted feeling settled in the bottom of his gut. He could not believe it had taken three years and six deaths before the ministry began to investigate in earnest. </p><p>Closing the folder, Harry sighed. He knew that the Ministry requesting his return, was at least in part, another publicity stunt. They wanted the wizarding world, especially those who had began to question the integrity of the ministry, to see they were taking this matter seriously. So seriously, they had gotten the great Harry Potter himself to return and assume the position of lead auror on the case. Had circumstances been different, Harry may have considered not going. </p><p>Harry had built a good life in America. Though he was still undeniably famous here, people didn’t mob him in the streets anymore, and up until a year and a half ago, the papers had left him in peace, for the most part. He had built himself a strong career, and a reputation as an outstanding auror. He had people here, friends he considered close enough to be family. And until a few days ago, he had Liam. </p><p>Harry closed his eyes. Fighting back a surge of emotion as Liam once again, rose to the forefront of his mind. He met Liam five years ago, snow skiing in the south of France. They had been on the same ski trip, and Liam had taken an instant shine to Harry. He was confident, kind, and devilishly handsome. They bonded, one thing leads to another, and soon they began dating. </p><p>They took things slow for a while. Harry at that point, was still not right after the war, and his mind healer advised him that rushing into a relationship might not be the best idea. He needed time to learn to love himself before he could even fathom loving anybody else.  </p><p>All these years later, had things not gone wrong, Harry had planned to propose. But with Liam long gone, and the engagement ring deep at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean somewhere, that was no longer on the table. He was sure that the American papers would weep, having lost their inside man to feed them information on Harry’s private life, but some betrayals are too painful to forgive. </p><p>Harry checked his watch, and stood up, linking his fingers and raising his arms above his head, stretching out his muscles. There was now only half an hour until his portkey activated. He turned around, and his gaze swept the room. Apart from his files, everything was packed that Harry planned to take. He picked up a small briefcase and locked the case files inside, before shrinking the briefcase and tucking it in the inner pocket of his robes. </p><p>He zipped up his suitcases, shrunk them, and cast a lightening charm on them, before tucking them in the pocket of his trousers. He walked through the door of his room, and into the main living area of the apartment. He smiled a sad smile, knowing this was likely the last time he would ever set foot in this place. </p><p>He took a letter out of his pocket and lay it on the kitchen table. If Liam ever came back here, he would find it. He opened the door, stepping out into the cool afternoon breeze. He had a little bit of time for one last coffee, he thought. </p><p>Harry wandered the familiar path to the little coffee shop on the corner. Despite the fact it was almost noon, he knew he could rely on this place to be quiet. Harry pushed open the door to the shop, the gentle tinkling of a bell to announce his arrival. The woman behind the counter glanced up and broke into a wide smile. “Harry!” she exclaimed, putting down the paper she had been reading to stride over and embrace him in a tight hug.</p><p>“Hiya Sam” Harry said softly, hugging her back for a few moments longer than usual. They broke apart. “I’ve come to say my goodbyes” Harry admitted, trying not to let his sadness creep into his voice. </p><p>“To the coffee or to me?” Sam asked, making her way back to the counter. Harry smiled “Both?” he said, making it sound more like a question than he intended. </p><p>Sam sighed, her happy mood seeming to evaporate. “I thought you had a few more days” she said, grabbing a cup and making a coffee for Harry without question. She didn’t need to ask what he wanted. </p><p>Harry walked over to lean against the other side of the wooden counter. “I know,” he said. He looked down and fiddled with one of the menus. “I thought I did too. They phoned me last night to let me know they wanted me there early” he said eventually. </p><p>Sam nodded. “I’m impressed they managed to get you on an earlier flight with such little notice” she said, her tone full of something almost close to an accusation. </p><p>Harry nodded slowly. He would never get used to this. The lying. “I suppose that’s the benefit of working for the government,” he said, hoping his voice came out steady.</p><p>“Well” started Sam, handing him his coffee, “We will miss you. We all will”. Harry took the coffee and nodded, smiling at her. </p><p>“I better be on my way.” Harry said, clutching the takeaway cup in his hand. “Tell the others goodbye from me. I don’t have time to see anyone else before I go, leaving early on such short notice and all that”. </p><p>Sam nodded, and walked around the counter to hug him one last time. “Take care, Harry. Don’t forget to call us when you’re living large in London.” </p><p>“I won’t” Harry promised. Taking one last look at the small coffee shop, he walked outside. He checked his watch, three minutes to go. </p><p>Harry made his way slowly down a small laneway, the large building to either side casting huge shadows on the ground around him. He made sure he was out of sight before leaning against the smooth stone wall, fishing his portkey from his pocket. A small token which just read “London, Harry Potter”. </p><p>Another minute later he closed his eyes, right before he felt the familiar tug, and the dizzying feeling of being pulled forward too fast, before his feet hit the ground once again, on home soil.</p>
