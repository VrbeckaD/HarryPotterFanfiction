  <span>Dolores Umbridge would have order. And she’d die before she didn’t, no exaggeration. To her, Hogwarts was out of control. She needed to do a lot of things to shape it up, make it presentable again for her crush, the Minister of Magic. One of the things she ended up doing right away as soon as possible:</span>
</p><p>
  <span>No boys and girls could be permitted to be within eight inches of each other at any times. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Some of the kids were really upset about that, come to think of it. Lavender Brown had a crush on Ron Weasley, and Dean Thomas was pretending to like Ron’s sister Ginny (pretending because in reality he had a crush on his best friend Seamus Finnigan). And Harry Potter of all people, the little snot, liked a certain Cho Chang. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Some kids though weren’t upset. Umbridge wasn’t sure why though. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh no,” Draco Malfoy deadpanned. “How traGic. WhAtever will I do, oh mY.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Right. He was gay. </span>
