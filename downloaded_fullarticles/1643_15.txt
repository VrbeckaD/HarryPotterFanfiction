    <p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">It was no surprise really. Harry Potter was admirable, clever and kind to strangers who were kind to him. (Y/N) Green always watched him from afar, directing gentle smiles to him whenever she caught his sight. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> She stood no chance to even befriend him, or so she though. She was a Slytherin, so for a starters, if she even got close to the golden trio they sent daggers. After years and years of Draco Malfoy’s bullying she didn’t take those daggers personally, so no hard feelings.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> (Y/N) was heading to Hogwarts on her fourth year. Her black cat, Tenebris, laid by her side, sleeping lulled by the train’s sway. She had her uniform on already; it was comfortable, so why change just before arriving?</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> The compartment she was in was the first in the “Slytherin wagon”. There was no such thing as a Slytherin wagon, but no one dared to set foot;</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Anything from the trolley?” </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Out of the blue (Y/N) heard the cheerful voice of the Sweet’s Woman. She got up exited, waiting for the old lady to arrive to her door.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Green was kind of impatient when sweets were involved, so when she didn’t hear the trolley moving, she went out of her compartment. The old lady stopped in the previous compartment before the wagon changed where she saw Ron Weasley talking to the old lady, Potter popping out seconds later.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> (Y/N)’s heart skipped a bit, and decided to approach to him and say hi. However, her chances turned to toast when she saw Cho Chang smile shyly at Harry. (Y/N) stood her ground determined, waiting for the sweets, at least something to console her pitiful soul, still watching how Harry melted at the Ravenclaw girl’s smile.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Move, Green.” A cold voice called from above her. Today was not her day clearly, as she saw Draco Malfoy’s eyes look down at her; (Y/N) was surprised he even knew her surname. She muttered a soft <em>sorry </em>and moved to the side, not meeting his eyes again.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> He didn’t leave instantly; he waited a couple of seconds and (Y/N) could swear Malfoy looked at her, then at Potter, then at her again. He then scoffed, like he just saw something hilarious, and returned to his friends. (Y/N) quickly bought some sweets and almost ran back to her compartment, greeted by her lovely cat. With a sigh, she couldn’t wait to reach to her dormitory at Hogwarts. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Just when she thought this year would start remotely normal, she saw Dumbledore announce some funny business, something about a tournament. (Y/N) couldn’t care less, as she had more pressing matters at hand. For some reason Malfoy was sitting across from her, and not only that, Green got a perfect view of Harry Potter. The problem was that every time she tried to sneak a peak at Potter, Malfoy was on the way. So it ended in a huge quick misunderstanding:</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Am I handsome?” He asked directly at her. “I know I am, but quit the staring.” Pansy Parkinson at his right shoot daggers at the poor girl.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “I’m not looking at you.” (Y/N) defended herself, digging her own grave. Instantly, Draco looked back and laughed ironically.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “You are looking at <em>Potter?” </em>He teased, laughing at Green with his friends. Just as (Y/N) was about to get up and move somewhere else, the doors opened dramatically and some girls in light blue uniforms waltzed their way in. All the boys in the great hall cheered and howled like wolfs. Green stood up and moved to the back of the table, were she knew no one would bother her. Soon after, very well built men came in the same dramatic way the girls had a minute ago, all the Hogwarts’ girls gasped in awe. (Y/N) was just impatient, waiting for the banquet to start.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Dinner finished without any bullying or weird announcement. In her way back, (Y/N)’s view wandered around, still mesmerized by the dark halls leading to Slytherin’s common room. When she entered, however, she could see Draco’s evil smile as he whispered something into Pansy’s ear, not seductively, but surely with mischief. Pansy Parkinson’s grin grew wider by the second, so (Y/N) just pretended she saw nothing and continued to her room.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> “Hey girls, you won’t believe what I recently discovered.” Parkinson stated, entering the 4th years girls dorm where she slept, that unfortunately was (Y/N)’s own as well. All the girl started buzzing, and immediately Green knew this was about her as she looked at her with wicked eyes. “Y/n Green, our beloved and quiet Slytherin sister has a little crush…”</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> Not a nanosecond passed that all of the girls were over Green asking questions, making her blush extremely. “Oh girls, relax. You would be surprised to know who he is…” Pansy teased, sitting in her own bed, across from (Y/N)’s. “It’s no other than the infamous, listen well here, Harry Potter.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> A loud unison gasp was heard as all the girls turned to face Green, making her even more embarrassed. Then a mixture of hysterical shrieks and laughs roared through the room, making even the moving paintings in the hall look at each other curious.</span>
