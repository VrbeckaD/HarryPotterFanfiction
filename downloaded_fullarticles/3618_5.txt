    <p>For the last Thirteen years or so, Hope had learned something new every single day. After all, she had spent that time living a double-life of sorts. It wasn't really much of a fuss, though at times Hope had found herself inconvenienced with planning and keeping in touch with the right people at the right time. However, she worked well in her job with a local Agency, Livewell &amp; Holland Financial Insurance, which provided her with both handsome pay and wonderful excuses to keep her hands tied when friends or family came knocking at her door unexpectedly and at the worst of times.<br/>
Her parents would visit every Sunday afternoon after Church, and not often otherwise. While Hope and her father wrote to each other regularly, the drive from Holyhead to Cardiff was simply too stressful to make more than once a week most of the time. There were always exceptions to this unspoken rule and every once in a blue moon a knock would sound while Holly and her husband, Lyall, had guests.</p><p>"Oh, just a minute." She would say in undertones. She and Lyall shared most of their friends and she had met all of Lyalls family, however, their families did not mix well by the laws that ruled his country... or was it a society within her country... She could never understand.</p><p>"I'll get the door. Darling, could you keep our guests quiet?" Holly spoke fervently as she stood. She hardly heard her husbands response of "Well, Sure!" as she whisked towards the front step. It was at times like these that Hope was grateful that Lyall's friends didn't drive automobiles or otherwise leave any trace of their presence outside her home.</p><p>"Surprise!" Her father's boisterous laugh would sound as Hope opened her front door. They would embrace and kiss each other's cheeks, but Hope wouldn't step aside or invite him in. Her company was very different than the people she'd grown up with and the cultural difference was startling to say the least. No, it would be best to keep things separate.</p><p>"Your mother had to get her eyeglasses repaired and I suggested the repairman here in Cardiff. His shop is simply delightful and you know I'm always looking for an excuse to see my shining girl." Hope's father spoke to her in Cymraeg. She had come to use English with her husband and his friends, but she slipped easily into her mother-tongue whenever her family was around.</p><p>"The drive is whats killing her eyesight, I swear. You should let us come and visit you more." Hope insisted, as she always did when her parents showed up.</p><p>"That boy of yours has enough on his plate without making that long drive. I'll survive, but his illness is nothing to cough at. No, until he's better we will come to you. Spare him the drive, we can weather it." Again, her fathers' age-old response. "Why don't you let me come in for some tea, I'll catch my death out here in the wind. Or are you-" He trailed off and gave Hope an inquisitive look.</p><p>"Up to my ears in work, I had to take home. Oh, I'm so sorry dad. Here, give me half an hour to tie up my work and then I'll meet you in town at the cafe for lunch before you grab mum for home. It's so stuffy in here, I'll be glad for an outing."</p><p>"Alright, Hope." He would say, because Hope's father was under the impression that she couldn't work with guests in the house. It was a lie that pained her to say every time, but she saw no grief on her father face as he hugged her again and turned for his automobile once more. It was then Hope's duty to say goodbye to Lyall and his mates, finish her tea, and make sure that her son was comfortable before she could follow her father to their favorite Cafe, The Mariner's Lounge.<br/>
The secrecy surrounding Lyall's friends was something Hope had never counted on when she had, as a child, imagined married life. Most people might assume the secrecy came from dangerous fraternization, however, Lyall's friends were some of the most trustworthy and honorable people she'd ever come to know. Each of them worked a legitimate job, had married to good wives, and worked in noteworthy positions within the government. By all accounts, Hope wished she could brag to her parents about the wonderful life that had spirited her away. The one circumstance that held her lips shut was this certain document that governed Lyall and all of his people; The Statute of Secrecy.</p><p>Lyall worked for a government, but it was no government that any of her friends or family would know of. In fact, if she came out and said exactly where Lyall worked in truth it might inspire her friends or family to call lunacy. In Hope's opinion, that was a fair and valid judgment. If she herself had not witnessed Lyall at work, Hope could not truthfully say she'd have believed her husband if he confessed everything to her.</p><p>Hope's husband, Lyall, was a Wizard. Normal people like her (Or, Muggles, as he called her family and herself) were not to know about the existence of the Wizards or Witches that lived among them. In the spirit of that, Lyall had grown up completely separately from Hope. He'd gone to a different marketplace, he'd been to a different school, and he worked for a different government. His whole world was neatly wrapped and packaged somewhere within her own, and she'd failed to sense it at all until the day Lyall had saved her from a creature in the woods near her childhood home.</p><p>Each year had brought her newer and richer knowledge of the Wizarding world, always from a slightly outside perspective. Now, with a child at eleven years of age, Hope was prepared to see him off in the largest leap-of-faith she'd ever taken.</p>
