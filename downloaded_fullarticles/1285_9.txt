          <div class="userstuff"><p>TOM: He's so pathetic. Let me tell you something about Abraxas Malfoy. We were best friends in first year. I know, right? It's so embarrassing. I don't even... Whatever. So then in fifth year, I opened the Chamber of Secrets, and the Baslisk, who was totally under my control because I'm Slytherin's Heir, but then the Chamber had to be closed again. And Abraxas was, like, weirdly jealous of the Basilisk, and thought it was my boyfriend or whatever. Like, if I would blow him off to hang out with the Basilisk, he'd be like, "Why didn't you patronus me back?" And I'd be like, "Why are you so obsessed with me?" So then, for my birthday party, which was an all purebloods christmas party, I was like, "Abraxas, I can't invite you, because I think you're a mudblood." I mean, I couldn't have a mudblood at my party. There are gonna be purebloods there in their death eater masks. I mean, right? He looked like a mudblood. So then his mom called my orphanage and started yelling at her. It was so retarded. And then he dropped out of school because no one would talk to him. When he came back in the fall for NEWT preps, all of his hair was cut off and he was totally weird, and now I guess he's on crack.</p></div>
