    <p>"Are you sure this is what you want? You don't have to go if you don't want to Harry, you know that." Severus says while watching Harry pack his clothes into a muggle suitcase. His son of three years was going to America all by himself, and well, with Harry's luck, anything could and would happen. </p>
<p>     "Dad, I have to go. You know this as well as I do. They won't stop hounding me, and soon enough they will do anything to make sure I 'stay' on the light side. I'm done with them, if I don't leave there will be curses and hexes thrown, and not everyone wants that." Harry replies. He knew what his dad was trying to do. He didn't want him traveling by himself all the way across the ocean just to meet someone who might not want anything to do with him. Harry understood, he did. But at the same time he had a gut feeling about this JJ person. Harry also knew that if she did accept him, she could protect him, seeing as how she's a part of the FBI. 

</p>
<p>      "Alright, alright. Just, promise me that you'll let us know how she reacts to you. If her reaction is favourable, tell her about magic. But before you do anything, let the American Ministry know that you are there, and that you might be staying there permanently. As soon as we're able, we will follow, but only if you say we can. Get to know this JJ first. Make sure she isn't a threat.

<p>      "Oh, and if you do trust her, tell her about your... other relatives." Severus said just as Sirius walked into the room. He smiled a tad sadly at his pup. He was going to miss him while they are apart.

</p>
<p>      "Okay pup. You'd better get going if you want to catch your flight. Be safe, alright? Keep your head down until the plane takes off." Sirius instructed his pup. Harry smiled, then launched himself at his dad and papa. He was going to miss them. 

</p>
<p>      "Give pa my love. I'll see you guys soon." Harry said, and left.</p>
