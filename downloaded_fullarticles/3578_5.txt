<p>Ambition </p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Shaking his head, Harry said, “Tempting as the thought is, staying home and shagging all day isn’t going to help you climb the ladder at the Ministry.” </p>
<p>Draco snorted. “And who says I want to do that?” </p>
<p>Lying on his side so he was facing Draco, Harry smiled. “You, love, are one of the most ambitious people I know. Are you really going to try to tell me you <i>don’t</i> have some master plan to become Head Auror by age thirty?” </p>
<p>“Shows what you know.” Draco smirked. “My plan had me getting there by twenty-eight.” </p>
<p>Harry laughed. “My point exactly.” </p>
<p>~</p>
<p>“You think you know everything about me?” Draco huffed, the faint smile playing around his mouth indicating his amusement. </p>
<p>Harry smiled. “I’d never claim that,” he whispered, sliding his thumb over Draco’s lower lip. “But I’d like to.” </p>
<p>Draco’s expression softened. “You’re one of the people who knows me best right now.” He dropped his eyes. “You managed to climb to the top of that list rather quickly.” </p>
<p>“Because we’ve been inseparable for almost a week.” Tilting Draco’s face up, Harry smiled into his eyes. “But all good things must come to an end, right?” </p>
<p>Draco sighed. “So they say.” </p>
