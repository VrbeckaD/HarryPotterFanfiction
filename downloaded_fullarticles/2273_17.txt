Rowling</p><p> </p><p>
  <b>June 5th, 1998</b>
</p><p> </p><p><em> Fuck</em>.</p><p>Harry’s eyes snapped open. Oh, shit.</p><p>He sat upright with a start, fighting off his clinging duvet. June 5th, it was. Malfoy’s <em> birthday</em>.</p><p>The day he’d sworn to give Draco back his wand.</p><p>Yawning, Harry dragged himself out of bed. The splintering shafts of sunlight of a ridiculously bright June morning had him blinking rapidly as they pierced through his bed hangings.</p><p>Squinting and scratching his belly, he nipped into the adjoining loo connected to Sirius’s old suite and went through his usual morning ablutions absentmindedly, his thoughts focused on the logistics of his self-assigned task of the day: finally returning Malfoy what was rightfully his. The one Malfoy had gotten from Mr Ollivander, all those years ago. And doubtless right about the same time Harry had gotten his own, given that they’d bumped into one another at Malkin’s, all unknowing of what Fate had in store for them.  </p><p>Yes, well. Fuck Fate, Harry thought firmly. His fate was his own, finally. Mostly. Keep calm and carry on, but lightly, right? They’d <em> won</em>.</p><p>Right, that. Harry forcibly cleared his mind of dwelling on prophecies and the like. He’d a rather more pressing thing to accomplish now; Hermione had said so quite firmly before she’d left. She’d said so quite firmly just last evening via a somewhat garbled international Floo, actually, among other repeated commands. <em> Again.</em></p><p>Harry had found himself to be compliant with her urgings; he was curious about Malfoy, and wanted to see how his ex-adversary was doing. True, it hadn’t been all that long since he’d seen him last, there in the wreckage of Hogwarts, but still. A lot could happen in a very short while, as Harry could attest.</p><p>To wit, Malfoy’s wand. And Harry’s quite perversely strong urge to return it.</p><p>The one Harry had abruptly ‘borrowed’. Not <em> stolen</em>, but more like…'swiftly appropriated for the war effort’. But still, the wand he really rather needed to return to Malfoy before all those who’d been cajoled into it gathered back at Hogwarts to begin the work of the Grand Restoration at month’s end.</p><p>Harry winced, recalling the summons for help. McGonagall had actually had the gall to appear terribly frail and beseeching when she’d simultaneously proposed the idea of the United Restoration Effort and quite publically begged the favour of Harry’s returning for it. And then proceeded to guilt everyone listening into helping. So, yes, it would be he and Malfoy and no doubt any number of other Hogwarts students and alum, but not Ron, and also not Hermione, who’d both conveniently fucked themselves off to the Great Down Under.</p><p>With Harry’s full blessing. Hermione really needed to reconnect with her parents; Harry could absofuckinglutely understand that. And Ron really, <em> really </em> needed to get the fuck away from his gathered and grieving family, all of them chafing at the bit whilst the Burrow was being rebuilt. Harry loved Molly most dearly <em> but</em>. Ron needed some space, clearly.</p><p>Also, Harry figured, his best mates would probably want to shag, and shagging under the eagle eyes of McGonagall and Mrs Weasley was just not on. Oh, so very not on. Privacy wasn’t exactly abounding at Hogwarts, not even with the tents Professor Flitwick had Charmed for all the Wizarding refugees.   </p><p>Indeed, Harry himself had fled as soon as he possibly could. Hogwarts was utter madness at the moment, being currently inhabited by not only the extended Weasley clan, but two or three score of older students besides, and the bustling flock of Professors. Miscellaneous other Wizards and Witches were also kipping over due to the damages done to Diagon, Hogsmeade and assorted Wizarding villages and estates. Neville’s grandmother was in residence, as well as the Lovegoods, father and daughter. Mr Ollivander, Madame Rosmerta and Mr Pottage of Potage’s were being housed. Fortunately St Mungo’s had taken away all the seriously wounded and the bodies of the dead but still, Hogwarts was no place to be if one had somewhere else one could be.</p><p>Harry assumed the Malfoys had realized the same thing and had done a bolt back to their mouldy old Manor. He’d not seen them past the afternoon of the day after the Battle.  </p><p>He took a moment to smile about his own surroundings, appreciating the peaceful mustiness and dank calm of Grimmauld Place as he traipsed through it on the way to his dining room. Even Kreacher had been welcoming in his own cranky way, a development Harry had decided to simply go along with.  Apparently rather a lot could be forgiven of Harry Potter, Avenger of Regulus.</p><p>“Master.”</p><p>“Morning, Kreacher!” Harry sang out cheerily, sitting down to the impressive full English the freakishly friendly old Elf insisted on presenting him every morning. He set Malfoy’s wand on the table by his cup and turned his attention to a spread worthy of one hundred young Wizards with wonky appetites. “Thanks for this; the food’s brilliant. As always.”</p><p>There was no way he could ever consume all of it, of course. Harry rather hoped Kreacher was slyly feeding the Elves the War had left homeless with his abundant leftovers. He had suspicions a few of those might even be housed in Grimmauld, kept out of his sight by his crusty old retainer. It made no matter to him, certainly. Kreacher was more than welcome to entertain his extended family.  In fact, it was a bit cheering to learn Kreacher even had family. Oh, the wonders of Ogden’s as a social emollient.</p><p>As usual, the Elf didn’t respond to Harry’s idle chatter much past an occasional grudging grunt of acknowledgement. Ignoring his less-than-sunnily dispositioned staff, who popped off on his own business anyway, Harry set his mind to recalling how exactly he’d gotten to Malfoy Manor the last time. It had seemed a sort of simple endeavour, getting Malfoy his wand back, but it really wasn’t.</p><p>Of course, Harry’s arrival there had been mostly accidental, thanks to the Snatchers. He’d always known the Manor was in Wiltshire, of course, because he knew rather a lot about Draco Malfoy, but he wasn’t terribly familiar with the topography of that part of the country. Although it clearly wasn’t UnPlottable and under Fidelius like Grimmauld, the Manor had certainly struck him as being pretty well private and secluded. All those long dark hedges and hulking huge gates! And the mansion itself being built of positive acres of ghostly white marble, with columns and architectural furbelows and follies abounding; it was all a bit much, at least in Harry’s estimation.</p><p>No wonder Voldemort had chosen it, though, Harry thought. What with all the ominous ostentation! Well, he wished Malfoy joy of his manorial mausoleum but Harry still needed a way to get there--and back again, as quickly as possible.</p><p>Harry mused, ticking possibilities over in his head as he shovelled down his eggs. There were ways...and then there were <em> Ways </em>. He could simply try to fly it, he supposed, but maybe the easiest thing to do was to simply Floo. Which he would have, excepting he was fairly sure Voldemort hadn’t kept up the Floo connexion. And Kingsley had been sort of reticent about what was happening with the Malfoys and their Manor when Harry had last taken luncheon with him.</p><p>So instead of all those, he’d make use of the Elf Portal Kreacher had grudgingly suggested: “<em>Family</em>, Master Harry. You is family to some in the House of Malfoy, and you is family to the House of Black, and Elf Law allows for family in need to pass through our Doorways.”</p><p>Harry nodded to himself, fairly satisfied. That was it, the plan.</p><p>After all, Narcissa had been a Black before her marriage, had she not? And so Draco was a Black relative as well. Harry was an honorary Black, courtesy of his late godfather, and a legal Black now as well, courtesy of the recent barrister’s visit and what seemed like a hundred dusty old scrolls, all requiring Harry’s signature. And Kreacher had said so, which meant more in practical ways than anything the fustily dressed old Goblin had had to say about it. Then, too, there was Teddy, Harry’s godson, and of course Andromeda herself. Mayhap even some of Harry’s actual blood Potter forebears had commingled with all that lot of Ancients-and-Honourables some centuries past; who knew?</p><p>Harry shrugged, feeling philosophical as he ate the last of his toast soldiers. Fuck, he was likely Draco’s cousin in some weird convoluted way. But--please dear Merlin!--<em>not </em> Lucius’s!  </p><p>So, yes, it wasn’t too unreasonable a stretch to assume the Ancient and Honourable House of Black would still have a working Elf Door accessing Malfoy Manor somewhere. If Kreacher said so, then it was so. And while it might be rude of Harry to pass through without any advance warning, Harry felt he really, <em> really </em> had to return Malfoy his wand. Today. On Draco’s birthday.</p><p>Didn’t he?</p><p>Oh yes, definitely. Dithers aside, Harry had pretty much convinced himself the poor sod was probably feeling quite at a loss without it. Draco had certainly seemed wan, forlorn and more than a bit lean-and-desperate the last time Harry had seen him. Hermione had mentioned she thought Draco looked ‘peaky’. Which caused Ron to scowl and then guffaw and Harry to stare at her like she’d gone mental.  </p><p><em> Merlin! Poor </em> peaky <em> Malfoy! </em>Harry couldn’t quite suppress a small shudder as he licked a gob of lemon curd off his thumb. A year or more ago he’d have giggled his arse off over a ‘peaky Malfoy’, but not anymore. There’d been quite enough suffering and rather too much cruelty; he wasn't about to contribute. Besides, Harry had been feeling uneasy, even guilty over taking the wand--amongst a wealth of other nebulous matters to do with Draco Malfoy--for a while now. He’d not mind it all, having an excuse to check up on him. Maybe satisfy his curiosity.</p><p>His perfectly <em> natural </em>curiosity.</p><p>Of course, Harry’s memory of his brief time at the Manor was a bit of a blur, what with the Snatchers and the horror of Hermione’s torture and the brutal hexing he’d endured first to render himself unrecognizable, but several strong impressions had stuck with him. Malfoy’s <em> look</em>, at that crucial moment when he’d been called upon to identify Harry, for instance.</p><p>It had been singularly strange for Harry, staring into Malfoy’s glass-grey eyes and knowing full well the bloke <em> knew </em> him, knew <em> exactly </em> who he was, not a <em> shred </em> of doubt about it all, even as Harry listened to Draco waffle on and deny him. Vague, that verbal faffing about Draco had pulled, but sufficiently slippery for the purpose. He must’ve been Occluding like mad! But it had sparked Harry’s hope they all might make it out of Malfoy Manor alive...if not quite unscathed.</p><p>If Harry was brutally honest about it, there’d always been a certain tiny part of him who’d known Draco wouldn’t blithely sell them all down the proverbial river.  </p><p>But there’d been something else, too, beyond that gut instinct. Something very <em> off </em>about Draco’s behavior. Harry meditatively sipped the dregs of his tea, thinking it over. The thing with him ‘stealing’ Malfoy’s wand? It had been all too easy, remarkably so. In fact, he’d rather felt as though Malfoy had practically offered it him. He’d barely struggled against Harry at all, although he’d certainly made it look as though he was for their viewing audience. No, Draco’s wand had been a gift, in a way, from a bloody ‘secret admirer’. An unexpected ally, even.</p><p>Harry grimaced. Very bloody fucking ‘secret’ after how many years of open animosity, but still! It had certainly set Harry to thinking.  </p><p>Indeed, beyond that incident which had struck him so deeply, there’d been those glimpses he’d had of Draco, through Voldemort’s mind’s eye. And other things, too. The Fiendfyre, for one--and how Draco had been acting before Crabbe went mental. Even the stupid-sly way he’d been acting with that one Death Eater, the one Ron had biffed him over. The time he warned them all; ‘Keep that big bushy head down, Granger,’ he’d said. </p><p>All of it taken together had really impressed itself upon Harry’s consciousness, so much so he’d made a point to have a serious word with Kingsley and even Professors McGonagall and Flitwick after it was all over, the Battle. How Malfoy had seemed to be cooperating with Harry’s seat-of-the-broom wild plan of escaping, even to the extent of aiding-and-abetting. Which, when taken into consideration with both his notable lack of bloodthirstiness in the Room of Requirement and the rumours Harry had heard about him fighting off Death Eater’s to keep the younger Slytherins safe during the Battle, all sort of added up to <em> something</em>.</p><p>Something <em> interesting</em>, Harry thought. Something ‘positive and healing’, even. ‘Rift-mending’. Well....That was what Hermione said about it, when he’d Floo’d her. Ron had just stared at Harry, long and squinty-eyed, and told him “Whatever, mate. You do you. You will anyway, right?”</p><p>Well, Harry was intending to.  Wasn’t he? No time like the present, then.</p><p>Squaring his shoulders and firming his chin, he rattled his cup into its saucer and leapt out of his seat, all at once eager to crack on. It would be fun. Sneaking into Malfoy Manor through an Elf Door? What a lark, right? Who knew where he might end up? Kreacher said Elf Doors weren’t exactly set in jolly, wide-open, welcoming places, like Wizarding Floos were. Oh no, they were Elven and thus secret, as they wound about the spaces In Between.</p><p><em> Oh, wait, no! Ugh! </em> Harry shivered, the memory of the Malfoy dungeons briefly revisiting him. He rather desperately hoped he wouldn’t end up in any of the nastier bits. He’d have to trust that Kreacher wouldn’t want that for him either. The Aurors had been through, or so reported Kingsley.</p><p>“Kreacher! Kreacher, I’m ready.”</p><p>Harry perked up as he waited on the Elf’s reappearance, idly fingering the extra wand tucked in the waistband of his joggers. It would be a nice end to it all, returning the wand. One way or another, it was going to be a lot more than merely <em> interesting</em>, informing Draco Malfoy the two of them were “family”.</p><p>“Right this way, Master Harry.”</p><p><em> Ack! Fuck! </em>  Harry careened over a large wooden cask upon arrival, nearly braining himself on the spigot.</p><p>“Oi, fucking help!” he yelped, scrambling to his feet and looking frantically about him. The first thing he saw though, instead of a pile of poor dead Muggles, was another House Elf.  “Wait, who are you?”</p><p>“I am Snobby, Master--Master Harry Potter? Can it be that Snobby sees Master Harry Potter in Snobby’s own cellar?”</p><p>A dancing Elf, with ears even longer than Dobby’s, clad in a smart little toga and a Slytherin green sash, his hands bedecked with set of kitchen mitts. Green ones, with giant silver ‘S’s. Harry winced, dodging.  </p><p>“Oh, it can, it can! Master P-Potter! The Master Harry Potter, it is you, s-sir!” Snobby had gone completely off his nut, capering toward and around Harry in dizzying circles, the mitts and toga flapping. “The same Master who has exploded the evil great Wizard? Our Dobby did say so much about you, Master Harry--all good things, all of them!”</p><p>“Er?” Harry gulped, stifling the pang the mention of Dobby brought him. “Did he now?”</p><p>“Oh yes, and thousand times yes! All of us have heard our Dobby’s tales of the Great Master Harry ever so many times, Master Harry! Even Master Draco has spoken kindly of the Great Master Harry!”</p><p>“...H-He<em> has </em>?”</p><p>“Ever so many times, oh Master Harry, ever so. <b>Many</b>. Times! Old Master Lucius who is <em> Not</em>-Master-Now did often shake his head over it! Oh, but please let poor old Snobby bow down and kiss your precious f-feet, Master Harry Potter? Pretty, pretty please, with knickers on?”</p><p>“Ack! No, don’t!”</p><p>Alarmed, Harry skittered crabwise behind yet another fragrant cask and warily regarded the shaking, squeaking being he’d put safely at arm’s-length. Landing on an unwary Elf was not part of the programme! The prospect of having his feet kissed by same was positively revolting.</p><p>“But, Master Harry, Snobby would be so very honoured!”</p><p>“No, no, please don’t do that! It’s not at all necessary--I mean to say, Snobby can be very, er, honoured from over there, alright? Alright.” Harry made frantic ‘shoo’-ing motions at the importuning Elf. “Erm, see here, could Snobby just please go fetch Malfoy? <em> Draco </em> Malfoy, not the other one. Quickly now, please. Er, Master Harry here is in a great hurry, see?”</p><p>He stole another glance about him. Kreacher had warned him he’d end up in the Malfoy cellars, and indeed he had. Elf Doors generally led into the more private parts of the places Wizards and Witches dwelt: lavs, root cellars, Potions pantries and the like, places where the public wasn’t prone to roam. This one was abounding in kegs, casks and bottles. “I rather don’t think I’m supposed to be down here.”</p><p>“B-But of course, M-Master P-Potter! If poor old Snobby may not kiss your feet, he may certainly fetch Master Draco for Master Harry! But one m-moment!”</p><p>He popped off, leaving a blessed stillness in his absence.</p><p>Harry released a hefty sigh of relief and prepared himself to wait. The Malfoy dungeons weren’t a fond memory by any means, but a more thorough scan truly assured him he’d come through to what looked to be solely the harbour of Ancient-and-Honourable hard spirits and not some horrible Death Eater abattoir, stinking of Dark Magic and the death of many Muggles.</p><p>Happy there was nothing more worrisome than a few stray spider webs and some posh dust, Harry let himself settle back into his slippers and posed himself, leant up casually against an ancient old oak barrel. He considered whipping out Draco’s wand and twirling it about, just for the devil-may-care look of it. For, if nothing else, Harry rather wanted to appear confident in the eyes of his old school rival.  He glanced down, taking in his comfortable morning tattiness and mentally ‘Oops!’-ing. Perhaps it might’ve a better idea to change into day robes and denims before visiting but then again, what if he had? He might not have come at all, if he’d thought overlong about it. It had been touch-and-go there, for a bit.</p><p>Say what one may about puffed-up ‘Saviours’, Harry knew full well he was no Gilderoy Lockhart. Malfoy Manor gave him the willies. And reminded him of sorrow. Harry hunched his shoulders, struggling to retain his sense of purpose.</p><p>The Malfoy elf--'Snobby’, was it?--greatly resembled Dobby, something he supposed wasn’t all that surprising. Kreacher had been surprisingly forthcoming late last night, both of them deep in their cups down the kitchens, sharing all manner of Black family stories with Harry. Never failing to remind him that, after all and often no matter what, House Elf families really were intensely loyal to the Wizards and Witches they served. And, just as with those Wizarding families, there was a great lot of closely connected blood relations in House Elf society. ‘Snobby’ might even be Kreacher’s relative. Likely was.</p><p>Same as Draco might be Harry’s ‘cousin’--and wouldn’t that infuriate the posh prat?</p><p>“Potter?” A dryly surprised voice interrupted Harry’s musings, causing his latent smile to vanish. “Harry Potter, in the flesh? What on earth are you doing, loitering about in my cellars? Are you lost, perchance? Misplaced?”</p><p>“Merlin, Draco!” Harry started, nearly jogging open the wine spigot by accident. He sent an accusing glare. “Fuck, but you put the wind up me! A little warning next time, alright?”</p><p>“Oh, well. Sorry, Potter. Is there to be a ‘next time’, then?”</p><p>Malfoy sniffed, shrugged carelessly and narrowed his eyes, considering Harry from his rumpled hair to his battered mules and pausing for just a little longer than was quite comfortable to gaze inquiringly at all the in-between bits. The part where Harry’s ancient t-shirt had rucked up, exposing the sag of his equally aged joggers, in particular. Harry flushed under the scrutiny, setting himself to rights quickly as he could; he’d not the faintest what Malfoy was on about, but surely his skin shouldn’t be <em> that </em>fascinating?</p><p>“I’m sure I didn’t mean to give you a fright,” Draco continued. “But it is my cellar, not yours, and it never occurred to me you might inhabit it---again, that is. So? Is it too much to ask what you’re doing lurking amongst my prized ports at arse-crack o’clock in the morning? In your pajamas, Potter?”</p><p>One fair eyebrow canted up at an angle, invoking instant consternation. So much for his erstwhile confidence! Harry seethed a little inwardly, blushed a little outwardly, and instantly avoided the open mockery in Malfoy’s eyes.  </p><p>“You see, Malfoy,” he said, earnestly addressing the teetering stack of port barrels and feeling very wrong-footed. “Erm, Draco, I mean. It’s....well.”</p><p>“Yes, <em> Potter</em>?”</p><p>“Shut it.” Miffed, Harry bucked right up in visceral response to Malfoy’s sniping. “I’m here for good reason, <em> Draco,</em>” he said doggedly, enunciating tit-for-tat. “Don’t be an arse over it; hear me out.”</p><p>“I see,” Draco replied suspiciously. “You’ve just stopped in to scold. How kind of you to call, <em> Potter</em>.”  </p><p>“No, shut your gob! Let me finish.” He met Draco’s coolly disbelieving gaze with a beseeching look, the same one he’d used sometimes on Ginny, actually.</p><p>“Uh...Right.” Draco ceased his nonsensical posturing, cleared his throat and flicked his fringe back, faintly flushed. It cascaded regally over his high forehead again right quick. “Go on, then. State your business.”</p><p>Harry drew out Draco’s wand but kept it mostly concealed in his dressing gown sleeve. It was quite true it was a bit early for a social call, yes, and also rather horribly apparent that he was clad in what amounted to his sleeping kit. But none of that was pertinent.  He’d not allow to be, despite the way Draco’s eyes were furtively roaming his person.</p><p>“It’s very important, really,” he said, focussing on and specifically addressing the one stubborn blond eyebrow, determined to keep to his mission. The utter untouchable Malfoyishness Draco effortlessly presented at ‘arse o’clock of the morning’ was so very much in contrast to Harry’s rough-and-tumble, though. It was daunting. “I swear. I’d not have come if it wasn’t.”  </p><p>“Alright.” Draco dropped the last remnants of his mocking pose instantly, stepping closer. “Sounds serious enough. Is it more Auror business? Because Shacklebolt’s squad has practically taken up residence and we are in full cooperation, I assure you.”    </p><p>“No! I’m not an Auror, Merlin forbid!” Horrified by the idea, Harry ventured forward. Draco’s wand was right there in his fist, mostly visible, and yet Draco had yet to so much as glance at it, much less mention its blaring presence. “Think I’ve had enough blood-and-gore to last a lifetime, ta very much!”</p><p>“And haven't we all?” Draco nodded. “Go on.”  </p><p>“Well…” Suddenly what had all seemed so simple in concept had become terribly complicated! Entangled in a conflict of reality-versus-expectations and feeling stumped, Harry fell back on the niceties.  “I’m, well, it’s just that I...ooh, er, <em> Merlin</em>. Um...hullo?” He smiled at Draco, gamely maintaining his determination and grimly gripping fast in a sweaty palm his friendly purpose. “Good morning. Uh. It’s been a while, hasn’t it? How are you?”</p><p>“You’re joking?” His Poshness went all stock-still, wary and regal. He regarded Harry steadily, striking hair gleaming silver-gilt in the subdued sconce light. “Hullo yourself, Potter. Good morning. What <em> did </em>you want?”</p><p>“Okay, yes. That.”</p><p>Harry abruptly decided Hermione’s way was the best way: when in doubt, list the facts in a rational manner. People--even the Draco Malfoy sort of people--didn't tend to be so argumentative when faced with an onslaught of data, right?</p><p>“Okay, thirdly,” he said, mentally fumbling through his list of things to say to awkward people. “I’m sorry it’s so early but I--well, this was too important for it to wait. I don't sleep well and it was incredibly bright this morning; I’m a little hungover still, maybe, and I--I just came through. It’s your birthday, isn’t it?”</p><p>“...Yes.” Draco frowned heavily, shifting his stance. “What of it?”</p><p>“So.” Harry attempted to plaster over an even friendlier version of the smile he’d previously pasted on and somehow lost in the process. “Happy birthday, Draco! Best wishes of the day, all that. I’ve, er. I’ve just come to return something to you. As a present, in a manner of speaking. A gift.”</p><p>“I see,” Malfoy replied flatly, cautiously approaching Harry and clearly unimpressed by Harry’s well-wishing. Or possibly by Harry’s bloody everything, who knew?  “Well, honestly, Potter, I don’t see anything at all but. Whatever. Excuse me.”</p><p>He grasped Harry by the upper arm, stubbornly not taking note of his wand in the slightest. Harry blinked at at him, mildly aghast. "Aren't you going to at least thank me?"</p><p>“Yes, thank you, much obliged and all <em> that</em>, but this is hardly the best place to entertain a guest of the Manor,” Draco said, nimbly aligning them. “Especially the Wizarding World’s Saviour, right? Do come along to the Morning Room, present yourself properly at least. Mother will want to know you’ve come calling on us Malfoys. She’ll be all agog.”</p><p>“What, go meet your mum?” Harry did a double-take. “Take tea? In the Morning Room? <b>Now</b> ? No! I’m not here to--I’m not even dressed for that!” He dug his slippered heels into the cracks between the dark stone pavers and resisted to no avail. Draco was clearly adamant. The cellar at once spun about and became all hazy, even as Harry protested. “What in the hell, Mal<em>fooy </em>!! Errr--uulp! Bleaugh!”</p><p>“Fuss and bother, Potter.” Malfoy smirked, landing them neatly. “I swear, you’re always so dramatic.”</p><p>“Gah, but I hate that sensation.” The Side-along left Harry groaning and blinking against the  wind-down of the inevitable dizzying spin. “Fuck, Draco. I’m only here to--I mean, I just can’t even--and--and your mum!”</p><p>“Potter,” Malfoy, all exaggerated patience, unhanded Harry with alacrity and gesturing widely about them. “We’re already here. Stop being such a namby-pamby baby about it. Oh, and welcome to Malfoy Manor proper. I don’t believe you had a chance to admire it when you were here last. Sorry about that.”</p><p>“Fuck you too, Malfoy,” Harry replied, busy staring. Everything confronting him was huge, marbled, brilliant with morning and featuring gobs of glittering glass and greenery. “Good gods! Where <em> is </em> this?”  Harry, accustomed to the tattered grandeur of Grimmauld and the imposing halls of Hogwarts academia, frankly gawped.</p><p>“Morning Room, Potter. As I said.”</p><p>Whether dedicated solely to ‘mornings’ or not, it was yet a vastly elegant space, drenched in the light from a series of huge arching windows. They faced out upon an endless expanse of smooth white stone balcony, all done up in miles of carven railings and balusters, and all overlooking extensive grounds. The Morning Room, Draco called it?  Harry shook his head. It was more like a gargantuan conservatory and it had Harry wincing against the resolving glare of a thousand panes of perfectly transparent glass reflecting off a wealth of polished pale tile. It was especially shocking to the senses after the pleasantly sweet alcoholic dimness of the wine cellar. But...it did smell good, Harry noticed, and it was a relief to see the countryside again after the weeks spent in the urban fastness of Grimmauld.</p><p>“Oh. Merlin, Draco, this is a bit brilliant,” he allowed, peering about a little more intently as his eyes adjusted. “It’s as if you have your own Hogwarts greenhouse right inside your actual house.”</p><p>Imposing as it was, Harry discovered he found it all rather amazingly lovely, the white and the gilt of the fancy furniture, and then the many greens of the lawns and the forest beyond them, echoed within the room by towering live ferns and artfully espaliered fruit trees trained against the gleaming walls. Potted gardenias and other far more Magical varieties bloomed all about them, perfuming the air and calming his addled nerves.</p><p>“Ta, glad you approve, Potter.” Draco waved Harry’s compliment off as if it were nothing. “It’s actually bog standard compared to some but this is just the West Wing, where we’re more informal. More suitable for unexpected callers, don’t you agree? The actual Conservatory is located in the South Wing.”</p><p>“Oh?” Harry gulped, his eyes widening. “It is?”</p><p>“Mmm-hmm. This way, Potter. Over here.”</p><p>Draco’s lips quirked as he beckoned at Harry; his eyes had darkened to a very interesting smouldering pewter shade. When Harry remained stalled, still rubbernecking, he huffed and took up Harry’s elbow, steering him. His long-fingered grip flexed as he guided Harry across the black-and-white parquet and straight into an richly upholstered chair, lingering before he drew it away. Harry liked the spot instantly; It was an intimately cosy seating arrangement removed from and set at an angle to the windows, all centred on a lovely moss-green carpet and sheltered by yet more towering greenery.</p><p>“Here,” Draco said affably, that faintest insinuation of a leer setting Harry’s teeth on edge. “Do be at ease, Potter.”  </p><p>“What? What does that even mean, Draco?”</p><p>Once more the perv was silently calling out Harry’s state of undress, it seemed. Harry ground his teeth together, beetling his brows darkly at his host. Draco noticing Harry was making Harry notice Draco all the more, and it was all a bit…disturbing. And not to the point, either.</p><p>“Just...this one’s a nice one,” Draco was saying, giving the armchair a fond pat in passing. But his gaze was on Harry's arse. “Some of the older ones can be a little squirrely. They don’t much appreciate visitors.”</p><p>Harry met Draco’s gravely amused gaze as he settled his bum firmly into the upholstery, hiding it from view. “Oh? ‘Squirrley’, you say?  What, is it likely to bite me?”</p><p>“No,” Draco chuckled. “I only meant my forebears haven’t always been of the opinion comfort was necessary,” he explained. “Apparently sufficient padding in the upholstery was for the weak-willed.”</p><p>“Ah.”   </p><p>Suitably installed, Harry occupied himself with trying to identify some of the plants whilst Draco drifted off a few steps, muttering under his breath.  He snapped his fingers, just as Harry was burying his nose in a massively wide purple bloom, easily the size of his entire head. Fleetingly, he considered the puzzle of the Malfoy 'Morning Room' being situated in the West Wing when the sun generally rose in the East, but shrugged it off as not worth his while asking.</p><p>“More tea, if you please, Snobby.”</p><p>“Yes, Master Malfoy.”</p><p>“In fact, Snobby.” Draco side-eyed Harry thoroughly. Harry, very much on edge, practically embedded himself in his flower. “If Measeley might manage it quickly, send along something a little more substantial. Eggs, bangers and toast. Biscuits and those apricot scones. P’raps some hot chocolate? Potter?”</p><p>“At once, Master Malfoy.”  </p><p>“Mind the Bougainvillea Gargantua, Potter; some say it’s carnivorous.” Harry twitched under that piercing stare, cursing Draco's attentiveness. “Hmm, you rather look as though you could do with a good dose of chocolate. Be sure to bring rather a lot of those digestives, Snobby.”</p><p>Harry did his best to ignore him, other than a scowl in passing resentment over Draco’s commenting on his appearance in yet another manner. Besides, Harry grumbled internally, leaving go of the flower hastily, his previous malnourishment wasn’t a problem. Especially as Kreacher had been hell-bent to remediate it by feeding Harry five massive meals a day.</p><p>“That will be all, Snobby; thank you. Oh, Mother?”   </p><p>Harry squinted at the icy-white blots moving about on the manicured lawns, instead. Yes, those had to be the famed Malfoy peacocks, the ones he’d heard tell of. They looked sleek and evil, even from a distance. He was very glad he’d not been sent through an Elf Door in their vicinity. Regular peacocks were horrid enough; Harry couldn’t even imagine how terrible their magic equivalent would be to encounter.</p><p>“Mother,” Harry heard Draco saying, “Mother, we have the unexpected pleasure of Potter.”</p><p>“What? Wait a moment, Draco!” Harry jerked his head about in alarm. Oh bloody Merlin, but Draco had mentioned something about his being presented to Narcissa, hadn’t he? “No, no, no!” he burst out, half-rising from the seat Draco had stuffed him into, “I really can’t stay to meet your--”</p><p>“Mother? Here you are.” Draco was some ways away, politely addressing the back of an immense wing-back armchair turned to face full on the gardens. “I’m so sorry to intrude on your morning meditation, but we’ve Potter, you see. I’ve called for more tea, if you’ll come and have some with us?”</p><p>Harry heard an indistinct murmur, and tensed himself for flight.</p><p>“And,” he heard Draco chiding his mum gently, “may I ask why have you not mentioned the wine cellars were left insecure by Father? I’d’ve re-Warded them immediately if I’d known. Though Father’s instructions are not exactly the epitome of clarity. Was he sozzled when he wrote them out?”</p><p>“Oh, quite possibly, Draco darling,” Narcissa replied, rising from her seat and coming about it to link arms with her progeny and advance upon Harry in a deceptively graceful swift gait. “No doubt it will be resolved quickly enough; you should not concern yourself at the moment, what with Minister-Elect Shacklebolt in constant attendance. Why, good morning, Mr. Potter! What a delightful surprise, to be sure.”</p><p>“Mrs Malfoy!” Cornered, Harry sprang to his feet politely, as if yanked upright by Levicorpus. “Ma’am!”</p><p>“Indeed, this is an unexpected pleasure, Mr. Potter,” Mrs Malfoy purred. “How terribly kind of you to call.”</p><p>She extended both hands to him as she unlatched herself from her son’s arm, leaving Harry with no choice but to take up her her long white fingers in his rather markedly shorter stubby ones. A quick clasp-and-squeeze left him flushing. He went scarlet when he remembered he’d not thought to wash up before popping through Kreacher’s portal.  </p><p>“Er, um. Thank you?”</p><p>Draco watched them both surreptitiously, Harry noted, even as he directed the activities of the House Elf about the over-laden the tea trolley. Harry frowned at him, but instantly smoothed out his irritated expression when Narcissa raised one of those bloody blond eyebrows at him in puzzlement.</p><p>“Nice to be here,” Harry added, looking down at their joined hands awkwardly. He hoped she wouldn’t remark on his buttery thumbnails. “Er. Sorry it’s so early.”</p><p>“And?” Narcissa prompted archly, showing no indication of leaving go of Harry. “Is there a reason for it? I do hope Mr Shacklebolt has assured you the Manor is in the all clear now.”</p><p>“Um--argh!” Harry swallowed so fast and hard, he began to cough uncontrollably. "Ahem, ack!"</p><p>What was with these Malfoys, not even batting a lash when they mentioned Shacklebolt? As if the man had become their dear friend instead of their long-term adversary. But then again, the woman before him had effectively saved his life from her former Master, just by bold-faced lying. She clearly had bollocks of brass, or possibly platinum. And Harry wasn’t an Auror, and no longer wanted to be. He’d no intention of fucking with her life further by trotting off to Shacklebolt like a rotten tattletale. “S-sorry!”</p><p>“Alright there, Potter?” Draco called out. “It’s bad form to expire before tea is served, you know.”  </p><p>“Yes, fine! Shut--oop, erm!” Harry hastily wrenched his attention back to Mrs Malfoy. “Um, it’s actually not a social call, really, Mrs Malfoy. I’ve Draco’s wand yet. From--from before. I’ve wanted to return it to him, and so.” He shrugged, hoping not to be forced to explain the early-morning wine cellar encounter. “Um. Here I am, thanks to Kreacher. I couldn’t trust trying to come through your main Floo, sorry.”</p><p>“Oh yes,” Mrs Malfoy’s smile deepened and her cool blue eyes warmed several degrees as she deftly took control of the conversation, patting Harry lightly on the wrist in passing as their hands parted. “Dear old Kreacher. Of course he would have realized the Elf Door was the most efficacious method for you to enter the Manor.” She settled herself into one of the other chairs grouped upon the attractive carpet. “You are the godfather of my sister’s grandson, are you not? And my poor departed Cousin Sirius’s rightful Heir. Family indeed. Still, it’s most thoughtful of you to return Draco’s wand, Mr Potter. No one would expect it of you.”</p><p>“Indeed,” Malfoy chimed in dryly, fussing with the trolley Snobby had delivered them. “Very heroic, Potter. Do sit. <em> Tea</em>.”</p><p>“No, really.” Harry really hadn’t expected such a warm welcome from the Malfoys--or at least the two Malfoys he’d so far spoken to. “It’s nothing much,” he mumbled, ably plucking the delicate cup-and-saucer Draco sent winging at him out of thin air. “I mean to say, I should’ve done it sooner, except there’s not been much time.”</p><p>“Yes, yes, you’ve mentioned,” Draco said impatiently, disregarding Harry’s mention of his wand entirely. “Biscuit? Or shall I just make up a full plate for you? You’re looking peaky, Potter.”  </p><p>“Oh! What? No, I’m not hungry, ta. Peaky? Hey, that’s exactly what Hermione said about <em> you</em>, just the other--ah!” Harry brought himself short with a start, as Mrs Malfoy was tilting her chin at him in an aggressively inquisitive manner. “I’m waffling on, sorry. Did I mention I don’t sleep well? I don’t, so I’m a little off when it comes to a proper sense of the time. Pardon again for barging in upon you so very early.”</p><p>“Quite understandable, Mr Potter.” Narcissa cocked her chin the other direction, smiling. “I’d expect you’ve had much to accomplish after the defeat of--”</p><p>“Yeah, him!” Harry hastened to interrupt. "I think we've all had quite enough of <em>him</em>, don't you? I know <em>I</em>  have, definitely." He rolled his eyes, restraining himself from indulging in further covert glances at her son, who’d thus far remained remarkably, uncharacteristically mum as he sat his fine arse upon the floral settee making up the conversational circle. And who looked fit, in an angular but interesting ‘recently recovering from untold strain’ sort of way. Not bloody ‘peaky’ at all, the prat. “And, but, um, how do <em>you  </em>do,  Mrs Malfoy? Well, I hope.”</p><p>“Very well, Mr. Potter, thank you for enquiring. It is drawing near the the Summer Solstice.” She nodded meaningfully and leant forward, as if sharing some arcane confidence with him. “I know I always find it more difficult to sleep peacefully at this time of the year myself, Mr Potter. I am sure you may be forgiven a little bout of insomnia. Don’t you agree, Draco darling?”</p><p>“Yes, Mother.” Draco nodded perfunctorily and snapped his fingers, his eyes on Harry. “Nevertheless, Potter. The first meal of the day is the most important.” Another full English appeared on the small console table by Harry’s elbow. “Anything else you might require? Do eat up; Measley will be highly offended if you don’t at least taste it.”  </p><p>“Ah, no!” Harry regarded the steaming plate-full askance; there was no possible way for him to manage yet another breakfast on top of the feast Kreacher had practically stuffed down his gullet. In spirit if not reality. "Merlin, <b> <em>no</em></b>, thank you; I really just cannot manage another bite of anything. And I’m fine. Just tea is fine. In fact, I’m not even all that thirsty.”</p><p>“Pity.” Both Malfoys sniffed, Draco especially looking affronted. “You look as though you could use it.”</p><p>“Er, do I? Still?” Astonished, Harry blinked at the both of them, shaking his head slightly to clear it. Narcissa was positively twinkling over Draco's insistence on offering Harry brekkers--and Draco seemingly was truly offended when Harry couldn’t eat it! It was more than a little disconcerting, the entire situation. P'raps the Elf Door had sent him to an altered reality?</p><p>"Very well then, if you don't want it." Draco sniffed and glared at the plate of eggs, etcetera, Vanishing them forthwith. "Don't say I didn't try, Potter." </p><p>"Of course not." Harry blinked. “...Um, so?” </p><p>Suddenly uneasy and not unsurprisingly a mite suspicious, Harry cast about for a polite way to ascertain whether he’d suddenly be confronted with a maddened Lucius. Fate did have this nasty way about her, at least in his experience. Perhaps all this tea-and-sympathy was just a precursor of a Slytherin-esque trap?</p><p>“Yes, Potter?”</p><p>“Right.” But Harry was no coward; he was made of sterner stuff. Accordingly, he affixed a concerned expression to his face and set his cup down, readying for the worst. “And how is your father, Mr Malfoy? I believe I’ve already asked after your health, Draco.”</p><p>He gamely attempted a polite smile on the scion of House Malfoy, quelling the rising urge to simply toss the stupid wand at Draco and do a bolt out the huge marble hearth in the distance. “Must say you look a great deal healthier than last time I saw you. Not that it’s been all that long.”  </p><p>“I’m fine, thanks.” Draco bared his very white teeth at Harry, curling his lip back like a terribly well-bred Abraxan. “And no fear, Potter; it’s been long enough for Father to completely decamp to Switzerland. On a permanent basis. More tea?”</p><p>Malfoy made a vague gesture and set the teapot about playing Mother and refreshing everyone’s cuppas. Harry couldn't help but notice that he seemed to be managing just fine without his wand. And had been, the bloody devious bellend.  </p><p>“Oh, no thank you, darling.” Narcissa waved the floating teapot off gracefully, chiming in. “Yes, Mr Potter, Lucius is now residing abroad. I may--or may <em> not;</em> I’ve not yet decided--one day join him.”</p><p>“Oh? Oh! Did he? Well,” Harry straightened his face as best he could for want of a better way to greet the happy news of Lucius’s departure. “That’s..that’s very interesting.”</p><p>“Yes, quite.” Draco waggled his eyebrows at Harry. “Mother and I are both in alt over it, frankly. And you may rest assured my Father will <em> never </em> hear about this, Potter.” He swept an expressive hand over the tea trolley, lips twitching. “Do cease fussing. There’s nothing here left to concern you.”</p><p>“I wasn’t!”</p><p>Harry’s hackles immediately rose up at the insinuation that he, of all people, was afraid of that scurrilous creature Lucius Malfoy!</p><p>“I was just--I mean, the War is <em> over</em>, Malfoy.”</p><p>Harry wanted to say ‘Draco’ but the ‘Malfoy’ just stuck itself in there, perhaps because of his inner upset. He took a deep breath, just as Hermione had shown him, and deliberately paused. The correct words would come to him, if only he gave them a chance--and they did.</p><p>“Right. I just wanted...I just wanted to know how it turned out for you and your family, that’s all. I mean, I...” He took refuge in staring down a particularly odd looking tropical plant, avoiding his old nemesis’s piercingly direct gaze assiduously. “I do know you love your parents very much, Draco.”</p><p>“Yes. He does.” Narcissa interceded, setting aside her untouched tea and rising, the seafoam green of her light morning robes swirling about her. “A blessing for which we are grateful. Now, I believe I will leave you both to your business. Good morning, Mr Potter. Draco, darling?”</p><p>“Mum?”</p><p>“Darling.” Narcissa paused partway across the lintel, smiling sweetly at her son. “A word with you later, if you please. There is much to accomplish before you leave for Hogwarts. As it happens, I have a full set of all the usual Manor incantations tucked away. The proper ones, given me by your Malfoy grandmother, dear--<em> not </em> your father’s devilish alterations.”</p><p>“Oh! Brilliant, Mother!” Draco smiled freely at his mum, the sunbeams kissing the platinum of his hair as they altered infinitesimally. “Of course. Good morning.”</p><p>“Goodbye, Mrs Malfoy,” Harry said, rising, propelled in part by the realization that he’d been at Malfoy Manor far too long. “It was nice to see you again.”</p><p>“Sit, <em> do</em>. Bit hard to converse if you’re hovering there, right? And no, really, Potter,” Malfoy smiled, resuming his seat opposite Harry’s chair and placidly sipping his tea as if he entertained old school rivals daily. “No offense intended--or taken, I’m sure. My father’s a minging cad and an absolute wanker, so I’m sorry for teasing you. I merely wished to set you at ease and that seemed a familiar way to go about it.” He grinned beguilingly. “Especially as you’ve brought me a present.”</p><p>“Oh, yes, that.” Harry groped up his bathrobe sleeve and fumbled about for the wand in question, producing it with a feeble sort of flourish. “This has all been, um, distracting, but here you are. Thank you again for letting me use it.”</p><p>He thrust it out in Draco’s direction, ever more grimly determined to flee back to Grimmauld at next opportunity.  Visiting attractive old ex-enemies so frightfully early and clad only in his night kit had probably not been the most well thought out plan-of-action, especially given the way those ex-enemy eyes had kept trailing attentively all over Harry’s state of deshabille. Unmistakable flirtation initiated by same was just absolutely not on. Unless it wasn't flirtation at all, but Harry wasn't a complete babe-in-the-woods, and he had his suspicions alright.  </p><p>“All in good order, too.” Harry caught Draco’s eye deliberately, quashing his passing bogglement in favour of business. “I had Mr Ollivander look it over for you, just yesterday. No harm done.”</p><p>“‘Letting you use it’, Potter?” Draco rolled his eyes. “I hardly think that was ‘letting’ you.”</p><p>“Yes it was,” Harry shot back instantly. “Now, please take it.”</p><p>Draco said no more but accepted his wand with the hand not occupied by his biscuit. He tipped it this way and that to examine it cursorily. “Looks perfectly fine,” he pronounced. “Thanks, Potter. Much obliged.” It was shoved up the fitted sleeve of his elegant dark burgundy velvet morning robe without further adieu, as if it were of no great consequence. “Was that all, then?”  </p><p>“Ah, okay? Yes.”</p><p>Harry frowned his confusion but decided this was his definite cue to take his leave. A thing, he told himself, he was glad to do! And if Draco was going to be so cavalier about his wand, it was his business, the ungrateful twat; Harry was done with this entire silly business.</p><p>“Right,” he announced loudly. “You’re terribly welcome, Malfoy, it was no trouble at all, and now I’ll just be...just be on my way!” He rose to his feet, making certain to secure his dressing gown about him and looked longingly towards the great double doors. “If I could trouble you for use of your Floo, that is. The Elf Door was a bit strange, you see. Er...Grimmauld cellars are also a bit strange. Rather not repeat the experience.”</p><p>“Of course, Potter,” Draco agreed genially, standing.  “I quite understand.” Harry stared at him; it was almost eerie, how polite they were both being with each other. “Please. Right this way.”</p><p>In but a moment he’d been suavely ushered out of the Morning Room and off to the Malfoy’s formal Floo point-of-entry, a spacious and echoing marble-lined chamber dominated by the largest, most ornate fireplace Harry’d had ever the fortune to view. An entire flock of sheep could have been easily spit-roasted inside its vast polished white expanse; that is, Harry thought,  should anyone ever have the excruciatingly poor taste to even attempt such a thing in such a fucking posh residence!</p><p>“Here. Floo powder.” An enormous urn made of a highly polished, highly carven Slytherin green stone stood upon a small teak pedestal beside it. Draco gestured, indicating Harry should help himself to handful.</p><p>“As you can see, Potter, we are on the Floo Network again,” he remarked blandly. “In the event you’re ever again struck by the sudden urge to...er, call in.”</p><p>“Oh fuck off.” Harry snorted, irked by the tiny lift of Draco’s lips. “As if I would!” He’d enough of having Draco take the piss. “But you should thank me; it’s not as though you won't be needing your wand. We’ll all have a work cut out for us, what with Restoration.”</p><p>“Naturally.” Draco accorded Harry a sort of awkward half-bow, which came across as both comical and a bit tentative. “I suppose I just wasn't really expected to ever see my wand again, you know? Bit surprising, having you turn up in my wine cellar with it.”</p><p>“Yeah, well,” Harry flushed guiltily. “Sorry about that, but I couldn’t think of a better way to get here. I knew the Manor was in Wiltshire but I didn’t think you were on the Floo, what with Voldemort and all,” he flapped a hand vaguely, still not taking up any Floo powder, “and I just couldn’t face all those hours bashing about on a borrowed broom looking for your house. I mean, what if you were UnPlottable, right?”</p><p>“We’re not, as it happens. But I can understand your hesitation, Potter.”</p><p>“Well, I didn’t know that, did I?” Harry shrugged, feeling less awkward at hearing Malfoy’s sympathetic murmur. “So, when I was talking it over with Kreacher last night--he’s my House Elf, or rather the one that came with the Ancient and Honorable etcetera House of Black, you know?--<em> he </em> said that, what with one connection and another, I was practically family with you and that would entitle me to use the Elf Door. See? So I did.”</p><p>“So you mentioned.” Draco smiled. Politely but also rather as if he wasn't silently castigating Harry as an utter lackwit. “And, indeed, so you did, and to my benefit,” he added agreeably. “Thank you for calling. Again.”</p><p>“Right.”</p><p>“Yes.”  </p><p>They both stood there for a moment, Draco stolidly smiling rather as if he wasn't sure what else to do and Harry feeling much the same. They both furtively glanced at the Floo.</p><p>“Well,” he said, after a far too long moment of subtle shifting in his slippers and fidgeting; clearly Draco had nothing further to say in the matter. “Yes. Thanks again. For the tea, I mean, this time. And for not Hexing me on the spot when I showed up in your wine cellar. I guess...I guess I’ll be going?”</p><p>“Right,” Draco replied. “Do.” Harry was pretty certain it was definitely still the friendly sort of smile and not the other sort. Although both their smiles seemed to be fraying. “Have a good day, Potter.” Of course he was still calling Harry ‘Potter’. “Thanks for my surprise birthday gift, yeah? Much appreciated. Inexplicable, but appreciated.”</p><p>“Yeah,” Harry said, finally palming a handful of iridescent Floo powder and edging closer to the gigantic hearth. "Not really, but whatever." He stepped inside, peering back over his shoulder. “Um. Wow, this is enormous, isn’t it? Suppose you know that, sorry. Ah. See you again, then.”</p><p>“Good day, Pot--”</p><p>Stumbling out onto his own hearth, back at Grimmauld, which was grand in its own dilapidated way and nowhere near as tidy, Harry shook his head over the whole experience, grumbling internally. Partially in wonderment over exchanging niceties with Narcissa, partially because Floos always left him dizzy.</p><p>Draco left him dizzy, too, apparently.</p><p>But, there, he told himself bracingly as he made his way up to his suite. Mission accomplished, thank Merlin. Hermione would be chuffed with Harry; Harry was pretty chuffed with himself, actually. And it hadn't even been too, too awful, amazingly enough.</p><p>Going for his wardrobe with the intention of finally changing into something a little more suitable before he Floo’d off to the Ministry--Kingsley had requested him to, especially; something about wanting to discuss a scheme for ‘private reparations funding’--Harry truly couldn't help but feel fairly proud of himself.</p><p>He really had managed it, having a civil conversation with Draco Malfoy. And his formidable mum! It couldn't help but bode for a better working relationship, or at least a far less nerve-wracking one, when they all headed back to Hogwarts <em>en masse</em> at month’s end to help with the Restoration.</p><p>Still? Thank Godric he’d nearly a full month ahead of him before he had to see that snarky git’s face again!  </p>
