    <p>Dancing couples, colorful, glittering lights. The smell of spilled alcohol, sweating people, and little opportunity for fresh air. Booming music spilling from speakers all around the room.<br/>
And his eyes, gray like storm clouds, yet oddly calm, looking at hers.</p><p>Just for the fraction of a second. </p><p>It had been more than enough time to fascinate her drunk self. </p><p>He had loomed over nearly everyone else, taller than her by more than a head. Broad shoulders, accentuated by a white shirt, which in the course of the evening had become more and more unbuttoned. Black slacks, black tie, black hair. </p><p>She had ignored her usual inhibitions and swallowed down what she couldn't ignore. The aftertaste was graciously washed away with a little more Gin and Tonic. </p><p>Then she had dragged him on the dance floor, time after time. </p><p>He had been game, following along. Treating her like a lady, despite both of them having drunk their fair share. </p><p>His chivalry, even when buzzed, had led to her actually testing the waters for a little more. </p><p>He had invited her to his hotel room. </p><p>She had accepted. What else was there to say? </p><p>He was devastatingly handsome. </p><p>She wasn't. And she knew it too. </p><p>Those who knew how she had gotten her scars always treated her like some sort of saint, something they dare not despoil. Or like a sister, if they cared for the person beneath the scars. Those who had no idea how she received her scars did not give her a second glance. </p><p>Usually. </p><p>But this silent, seemingly <em>shy</em> gentleman, he had appeared to see her. </p><p>So off Harry went.<br/>
<br/>
And even two months later, she did not regret what had followed afterward. Even when the consequences were literally life-changing.</p><p align="center"><br/>
oooo </p><p>Of course, Hermione and Ron were the first to know. She had come to them with her suspicions. Hermione had even gone to get a few pregnancy tests for her, from the drug store near her parents' house. </p><p>Then held Harry's hand as they waited for the results. </p><p>Ron had reassured her that everything would be well. Whatever happened. They'd always be there to support her. </p><p>After that, they had convened in a sort of unofficial war council. </p><p>"Did you use protection?" Hermione asked methodically, going through a list of questions to prepare her for the obstetrician visit. </p><p>"A condom and the potion."</p><p>Emma, Hermione's mother, poured her adopted second daughter another cup of cherry blossom tea. "You are just the exception to prove the rule, dear, aren't you? Now if only I could convince you to play the lottery with me..."</p><p>Harry snorted into her tea, while Hermione rolled her eyes. </p><p>Ron smirked. "That's what Mum says too!"</p><p>"So, you used protection. Are you sure the condom didn't rip?"</p><p>"As sure as I can be."</p><p>Hermione sighed. "Well, I suppose that's all I could imagine them asking about that. What do you know about Baby Daddy?"</p><p>Harry blushed. "Well..."</p><p>“Not a whole lot, I'm guessing?" Dan, Hermione's father, sighed, rubbing his forehead. </p><p>"Unfortunately not. He said I could call him Mori. He has gray eyes, black hair, is definitely Asian, and very considerate. Also, I think he's pretty well-off."</p><p>"That's a start, at least," Hermione said, jotting down everything Harry had mentioned.</p><p>"Which part of Asia would you say he's from?"</p><p>"Japan? He mentioned something about going to school in Tokyo? I think. But I'm not sure."</p><p>"What is he doing in London then? Japan is quite a long way to go, even for wizards," Ron wondered aloud, scratching his chin. </p><p>"Well, it could be that he came for business reasons? Maybe wanting to work abroad?" Emma suggested, absentmindedly rubbing Harry's back. "Or he wants to learn to speak better English? Possibly studying here?" </p><p>"I don't think so. He spoke English pretty fluently, with a slight American accent even. And he was far too well-dressed for a university student. It could be that he's from old money or the Japanese equivalent."</p><p>That caught Dan's attention. "Why old money?"</p><p>Harry's blush deepened. "Well... He must have been raised as a true gentleman. The way he treated me was..." Her voice trailed off, as memories of their one night stand flickered back to life in her mind. </p><p>Ron cleared his throat obnoxiously loudly. "Back with us, Harry?"</p><p>“Leave her alone. That boy must have been very good to still evoke those memories," Emma reprimanded her future son-in-law with a mischievous twinkle in her eyes.</p><p>Dan groaned into his hands, burying his head in them. Then he stared at the ceiling, wondering out loud what he had ever done in a previous life to deserve this. </p><p>"Are you going to tell him, dear?" Emma wondered, sparing her husband a new gray hair. </p><p>Harry nodded decisively. "He deserves to know. I mean, I will keep the baby, but for both their sakes, I have to tell him."</p><p>"You don't <em>have</em> to," Dan pointed out. </p><p>Only to be met with several questioning looks and a heated glare. </p><p>"Hey," he said, raising his arms in the air, "I am just making sure you know that you have other choices."</p><p>"Thank you. But I will tell him. He gets one chance to decide if he wants to be in the baby's life or not. If he chooses to not be involved, I can at least go with a clean conscience."</p><p>Emma slung an arm around her second daughter's shoulder, smiling down at her. "And if he's as dishy as you make him sound, well... You can't get more pregnant than you already are."</p><p>"MUUM!" and "Emma!" rang out simultaneously. </p><p>Harry had to laugh, against her will.</p><p>"So, where do we start looking?" </p><p>"I have no clue," Harry admitted. But she was positively beaming at everyone present.</p><p>Dan sighed again, pushing the teapot towards her. "Well, we can at least help with the gynecologist. That's if you don't want to go to a magical doctor?"</p><p>"NO! For Merlin's sake! The whole world would know a day later!" Harry's face had lost all its color within seconds. </p><p>Emma glared at her husband, then soothed Harry as best as she could. "It's okay, darling."</p><p>Hermione nodded. "I'll look for anything pregnancy-related in the library. I'll also check the owl- order catalogs in case there's differences for magical pregnancies. Ron, you and Harry should probably start looking at spells to locate missing persons, or related information. I don't think we'll go far without a name and just a general description in the Muggle world."</p><p>Ron saluted. "Aye aye, ma'am."</p><p>Harry tapped her chin. "I think we should try private investigators in addition to the spells. We might find out his full name, but that won't give us any information about his background or address etc. "</p><p>Dan nodded approvingly. "I can ask around if anyone trustworthy has recommendations. Some of my old mates from the military might know someone."</p><p>Harry hugged everyone tightly. "Thank you. Thank you so, so much. I really appreciate all the trouble you're going through for me."</p><p>Emma smiled at her. "No need to thank us, dear. You're family."</p>
