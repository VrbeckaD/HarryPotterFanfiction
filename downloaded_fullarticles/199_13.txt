    <h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
    <p>Once upon a time long ago, one witch and one wizard fell madly in love. The wizard though had not been meant for the young witch; he had been betrothed to another. When the wizard left his bride on what was to be their wedding day, he had broken her heart. She had vowed to never love again and had cursed the wizard and his witch, they would never know a life of happiness together, and they would be doomed to repeat their heartache until the day the one with the blood of the Horned Serpent set them free. <br/>Time was a funny thing for us. You and I could never escape, one step from each other. Never truly together, yet always in fates embrace. -Wicked Words<br/>Sixth Year May 1st <br/>With the rising of the sun Draco could feel the clarity that finally remembering the past afforded him. He was no longer the lost boy, but the man who had been searching for centuries for something that was just out of reach. The memory’s from long ago past mixed with the his more recent ones told him, who he was searching for. It could only ever have been her, with the road that lay ahead of him he would once again have choose between her and the duty he was bound to uphold. Searching within in himself he could feel her, he could feel the sorrow, the bitterness and the loss of hope. He left his dormitory following the emotions that were not his own but hers.  </p>
<p>She was sitting at usually table in the library where she could so often be found. Lost in her work, she didn’t see him approach, which he was thankful for. He didn’t know if she would hex him or run into his open arms, the way she always did when they awoke in a new life. The bleeding curse that wouldn’t just leave them be, they had been doomed long ago to lifetime after lifetime of loosing each other until they could break the curse. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Hermione,” he said softly as he pulled the chair across from hers out and sat down. She didn’t look up from what she was writing. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Malfoy if you have come to mock me some more please save it, I️ am rather sick of being you’re punch line.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Hermione.” he said her name again she stopped writing and looked up, but not with the usual happiness when they had finally awoken in their new life. The sadness he could feel in her emotions were mirrored in her eyes. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Draco,” she said softly </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“How long this time,” he asked knowing she would know what he meant. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Almost a year,” he sighed, he was always the last to awake to their memory’s. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“This Time is different,” he said, as he saw the unshed tears welling up in her eyes. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>She wiped them away, “This time is meant to be the time we break the curse, I️ can feel it.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“But you aren’t hoping for a happy ending,” he said softly, she shook her head. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“The war is about to break out, and we are on different side, you have already been marked. You are a death eater and I am a muggle born.” He didn’t ask her how she could possibly know this, he already knew. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“We can run away,” he said fear building in his chest. He was willing to turn his back on everything for her, his task be damned if it meant that he could keep her safe he would do it. He would do anything for her, which was why they had found themselves in this unfortunate situation. The look in her eyes though told him her mind was already made up, and he had known her long enough to know there would be no changing it. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Draco,” she smiled a broken smile, that made his heart stop. “We are always faced with the hard choice, and we also choose ourselves. I think that is the point. We will live this life over and over and over again, until we learn to be unselfish.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I won’t be able to protect you from what is about to come. You have yourself so entangled with Potter.” His voice cracked, why couldn’t she see that Potter was going to be the death of her. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I know, I love you with every fiber of my body, but this time, the choice isn’t easy is it?” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“They will hunt you down and kill you, they will kill everyone you love.” He said </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“They will kill everyone I love regardless.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“There is no changing your mind?” he asked hoping that there would be something he could say to persuade her to just leave with him. Leave this whole mess behind them.</p>
<p>“No,” she said wiping the tears away. “I had hoped that you wouldn’t wake up this time.” He tried not to look hurt at this small truth. He was though, how could he not be. In every life they had ever lived he had always been ready to give everything up for her. It had always been her; it would always be her. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“That isn’t the point of the curse.” The sad smile he gave her only brought more silent tears to her eyes. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I know.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>He looked at her, searching her eyes for some sort of weakness he could use, but he found none. She had made up her mind and he would be a fool if he tried to change it. She had always been so strong; it was one of the many things he loved about her.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“So that is it then? We will stand on opposite sides of the line?” true fear set in, didn’t she understand how powerful he was, Potter would stand no chance, he would die and so would everyone who stood with him. Couldn’t she see that she would die?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Draco you are free to make whatever choice you want. I just I can’t do this again, I can’t be doomed to life after life of repeating the same mistakes.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I am not a mistake Hermione.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Aren’t you though?” She could see the hurt in his eyes. “Wasn’t that the whole point of the witches curse. You were meant for someone else not me, and I was stubborn and took what wasn’t mine to take. This is my punishment, our punishment. We weren’t meant for one another.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I don’t believe that.” He looked deep into the depths of her eyes. “I love as much today I as I did four hundred years ago. My love for you is timeless, nothing you can say will make me believe otherwise.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“It doesn’t mean that it is meant to be. Sometime we don’t get what we most desire in the world, we don’t get the golden snitch at the end of the game.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>He didn’t know what else he could say that would make her believe him. She was being stubborn and a fool. “Keep yourself, and those two idiots you call friends safe.” He said looking down at his hands. He wouldn’t be able to survive if something happened to her. He would never forgive them if they were the reason she perished from this world.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I will do my best.” She tried to manage a smile but was unable to “Draco you should know that we won’t be back next year.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I love you Hermione.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I love you too.” She whispered wiping at the silent tears. He stood and took one last look at her before turning to leave. Walking away now would be hardest thing he would ever have to do. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Five years later.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The war had been brutal, the Wizarding world had lost so much when the end finally came. The Dark Lord had been ultimately been defeated but it had come at the cost of human life. So many of their friends had paid the price with their own life and their world was just starting to heal. Hermione Granger had found the aftermath of war much harder to handle than the actual war itself. She hadn’t planned on surviving yet here she was five years later alive and well. Her guilt over surviving followed her everywhere. It seeped into every part of her life until she could no longer take it. She was revered as a hero of the war, but she didn’t feel like a hero. She had only done what she had to, to survive. That’s wasn’t being a hero that was being human was. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>In the years following the war Hermione had finished her education, gone on to study Magical Law and the fragile ties that bound Wizarding Britain to the rest of the world. She had earned herself a position in the Department of International Magical Cooperation. She worked closely with other foreign Magical governments to repair the ties that Voldemort and his death eaters had destroyed. She had thrown herself into her work, anything to keep from facing the hard truth about her life. She never liked to think she needed someone to complete her, she could do that all on her own. All the pieces were there, but there seemed to be one that just wouldn’t fit itself neatly with the rest. In the years following the war she had had one failed relationship after the next, never able to commit herself to anyone. In the deepest recess of her brain she knew why this was of course, but it didn’t stop herself from trying to prove the fact of the matter wrong. The true problem was she wasn’t just Hermione Jean Granger, there was a very big part of her who was Helena Ophelia Vallens, who fell in love with a man who was far above her class and station, and when the same man fell in love with her, they had been cursed to repeat their life and betrayal for centuries to come. How could she ever explain this to anyone, and the only person who knew what this was like was long gone, having fled London after his eventual trial and acquittal. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>After the end of her last disastrous failed relationship with Oliver Wood, she jumped at the position that had suddenly became available as liaison to the American Congress. The post required the liaison to live in America, and Hermione would take any excuse to leave England and the aftermath of her most epic failure yet. Ron and Harry had not understood why she felt like she needed to go, after all it was only a breakup and merlin knew she had plenty of those. Unable to explain why exactly it was she had to go caused a rift between her and her oldest friends. Ginny understood, she knew what it was like to search for something you couldn’t put into words. The redheaded witch had known for a long time there were things Hermione was unable or unwilling to share. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Are you ever going to tell me why you have been looking for all these years.” Ginny had asked while she helped Hermione pack up her small London Flat. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I can’t even begin to explain what it is. I just know that I will know it when I see it.” Was Hermione clipped response. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Or maybe you do know what it is, but you won’t allow yourself to have it. Maybe you don’t feel worthy of it, not after everything that has happened. I just wish you could see that it is ok to be happy Hermione. No one will fault you for it, in fact I think many would say it was one of the reasons we fought a war. So, everyone could have a chance at being happy.” Hermione didn’t say anything as continued to pull books from the shelves and into boxes. Ginny had always had away of seeing right through her, even if she didn’t have all the facts. “You have to promise me something.” The she said when it was apparent Hermione would not give her the answers she wanted. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“What is that Ginny?” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Promise me when you get to New York you will put yourself out there, really and truly out there. If you don’t risk it all, how will you ever know if it is truly worth it. You can’t go through life putting up walls to isolate yourself from the rest of the world, that is not living.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hermione smiled a sad smile as she put down the books she was holding and walked over to her best friend and hugged her. She would miss this woman like no tomorrow, and no amount of visits or floo calls was going to make up for the fact there would very soon be an entire ocean between them. “I’ll try Ginny I promise to try.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>When all her bags were finally packed, and the last five years of her life were filed away into neat boxes she said goodbye to her home. Goodbye to the person she had been, and started what she hoped was a new Chapter. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>....</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco Malfoy had not survived the war unscarred, the black mark on his arm was proof of that. When the war and his trail was over, he had put an ocean between himself and the bad memories that were left in the aftermath of the war. Free from his father and what was expected of him as the sole heir to the Malfoy name, which in all honesty did not hold much weight anymore, he was free in more than one way to make a new life for himself. The United States was free from the pureblood mantra that plagued Europe for centuries. Witches and wizards feared the No-Majs to be sure, but their fear was justified, they however didn’t use that fear to insight prejudice. The Magical community wanted to live among the No-Maj’s and be as invisible as possible. This is what appealed to Draco the most, being invisible. He had spent his life being known for his name, his heritage, his standing in their world, he thought being unknown sounded good for a change. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco had found this way of living to be rather refreshing and so at odds with the way he had been raised back in England. Though he was no longer the prejudice git he once was, America’s law concerning commingling between Magically people and No-Maj’s easy to adjust to. He was baffled by the muggles, and he was sure the only person who could ever make him understand them, had made it very clear she wanted nothing to do with him before the war. He couldn’t blame her however, she had endured centuries of unhappiness because of him, because of her love for him. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Upon arriving in America he had reported to the American congress and registered as foreign wizard who was seeking refuge from his war torn homeland. The troubles from Europe were well known to the American Congress, and he had a fair number of hoops to jump through to be allowed to stay. In the end though he had been deemed safe and had been allowed to settle into a new life. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>With what money he had left in his vaults he had been able to open a successful potions business that he operated out of New York City, and worked closely with Congress to help provided potions for the many Magical hospitals around the country. He had seen the way the No-Maj pharmaceutical company’s ran their business and vowed never to allow greed to rule his sole purpose, to help people who are in need. This was what helped Draco give back to the world, he had been a boy who had been made to do horrible things. He could have died and been saved the inner turmoil, but he had chosen to live. This was the guilt he carried with him, his choice to live. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>His life wasn’t all bad though, he had made a good life for himself, he had made knew friends, built a successful business and he had even met someone who he thought he could spend the rest of his life with. She was American (obviously) she had been educated Ilvermorny where she had graduated top of her class before earning herself a position in Congress in the Major Investigation Department from there she had worked her way up the ranks, and was now the youngest witch or wizard to be appointed Vice President of congress. It would see that Draco Malfoy had a type; he could see the similarity’s, but he did his best to ignore them. He was truly unaware just how much his new life would soon be turned upside down. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>.....</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hermione had settled into her new apartment on Manhattan island, down the street from NYU. It was a small just over five hundred square feet, but it was quaint and all she really needed. Tomorrow would be her first day working at congress and she was excited at the prospect of a new adventure. She had spent the last few days exploring the muggle city and getting familiar with her new surroundings. She had been on holiday here as a child with her parents before she knew she a witch, and she had been mesmerized by the city even then. It was known around the world as the city that never sleeps, and it had been easy to discover why. At any given time during the day a person could find a hundred things to do, the fast pass of it all helped breath new life into her, maybe she would be able to keep her promise to Ginny after all. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Part of her new job was help start a new project what would bring the American and British Magical community’s closer together, and to help start a Magical task force that would help prevent another uprising such as Voldemort. It was taunting task to be sure, but Hermione was up for the challenge. There was nothing she wouldn’t be able to do, if she put her mind to it. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Monday dawned, Hermione was having a hard time adjusting to the time difference and had been up for several hours by time eight o’clock rolled around and it was time to head to the Woolworth Building. It was easy enough to find seeing as she had been to Congress on one other occasion on behalf of the Ministry, and it was only a ten-minute subway ride from her apartment. Even after all this time living in the magical world, she still found muggle transportation a more appealing option. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>At 8:15 on the dot she walked into MACUSA and was greeted by a flood of activity not unlike mornings at the Ministry, witch’s and wizard’s rushing about in what could only be called chaos. Spotting the welcome desk, she made a beeline towards the friendly looking witch who set behind the desk. “Hermione Granger.” She told the witch.<br/>“Yes,” the young girl said riffling through a stack of papers. “This is your visitor’s badge till your official badge is issued to you.” She handed over the id card. “Someone should be a long to collect here soon. Welcome to MACUSA.” She said with a smile.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Miss Granger.” She heard someone call from behind her, she turned from the desk to see a tall man of about 30 make his way over to her. He was handsome she noted with cropped dirty blonde hair and piercing blue eyes. “Miss Granger I am Finn Bishop, it’s a pleasure to meet you. I’m here to guide you to Miss Chamberlin’s office.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Please call me Hermione Finn.” She held out her hand for him to shake which he did with a smile. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Follow me.” He said turning and making his way to the lifts, Hermione followed behind before falling into step with him. “Did you get settled alright; the city is a big place.” He asked.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Yes, but so is London.” Finn smiled at her before he stepped into the lift and told the goblin where they we’re headed. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I’ve never been abroad, nice place London?” He asked trying to keep the small talk going, so they wouldn’t fall into an uncomfortable silence, she grateful.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“It’s lovely this time of year.” Hermione smiled; a small ding sounded overhead telling alerting them to their arrival to level 50. “What is it that you do here.” She asked as they stepped out of the lift and started making their way down a regal looking corridor, falling into step once again. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“The Office of Magic Relations and Education. I’ll be your counterpart while you are here. We will be working closely with Madam Vice President Chamberlin forming the new task force.” They had stopped in front of a set of large oak doors. The Plaque read Vice President Emily Chamberlin, Finn lifted one arm and knocked twice before allowing it to fall back to his side. After a few seconds the door sprang open of its own accord and allowed them entrance. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Finn walked in first with Hermione right behind him, the office was large with an entire wall of glass that overlooked the city just beyond the walls of congress. A large white desk sat in the middle of the room. A petite woman with shoulder length straight brown hair sat behind it absorbed in whatever file was in front of her. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>This must be the formidable Emily Chamberlin; Hermione had heard all about from Kingsley. She was said to be smart and ambitious and had made a name for herself as soon as she stepped foot inside Congress’s doors. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Madam, Hermione Granger has arrived.” Finn said once they were standing in front of her.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Emily looked up and gave Hermione a long once over before a smile spread across her beautiful face. She stood and rounded the desk holding out her hand once she reached her “It is such a pleasure to meet you at last.” Emily said as the two women shook hands. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Likewise, the Minister has nothing but praise when it comes to talking about you.” Hermione said with a smile. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Miss Granger, you should hear the way the man talks about you, I was half expecting a saint to walk through my door.” Hermione laughed nervously but held her smile in place. “What you and your friends did for your community, well I’m just glad we have never had to face something like that here.” Hermione nodded, what do you say to that? “Please both of you take a seat.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Both her and Finn took the chairs in front of Emily’s desk. Hermione took another moment to look around the spacious office, it was very modern with lots of white. To much white if Hermione was being honest, it wasn’t warm or inviting, and there seemed to be no personality about the office. It felt cold and detached.</p>
<p>“So, you have already meet Finn here, he is head of our magic relations division and will be who you report to here.” Emily said getting down to business. “The point of this liaison position is help make the ties between our two country stronger. You still work for your Ministry of course, but we ask that you follow our laws while you are here. We know that you are a what do you call it?? Muggleborn?” she looked apprehensive for a moment unsure of if she had gotten the term right. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Yes.” Hermione tried to smile encouragingly; she had been through too much for a misused phrase to offend her anyways. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“We know that you might be comfortable around the No-Maj’s given your background, but we ask that you don’t form any sort of relationship with any that you may come into contact with.” There was something about the ways she said that, that made Hermione uncomfortable. What could this woman possible no about her background?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You are aware that my lodgings are in the muggle world Madam Vice President.” Hermione tried to hide her clipped tone. She hoped she had been able to pull it off. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Oh, dear girl of course I am. Most of us live among them, but we don’t interact with them more than what normal pleasantries require.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Dear girl??? They had to be close to the same ages for Merlin’s sake. “Right.” was all she could manage. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Now I want to turn our focus to the task force. It will be Finn and your job to get the other countries around the world on board for this task force. It will be a daunting task, but Kingsley assured me you would be up for it. There very well maybe a bit of traveling and long hours.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Yes Madam. I am ready for the challenge.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Excellent. Finn why don’t you show Miss Granger to her office. Let her get settled and then show her around a bit. I know you have been here before, but it’s easy to get lost in this place.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Madam Vice President, your fiancé is here to see you.” A disembodied voice said suddenly causing Hermione to jump slightly. It took her a moment to realize the voice was coming from the phone sitting atop her desk. For people who were so leery of the muggles, they sure didn’t mind taking advantage of their technology. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Tell him to wait one moment, we are just finishing up.” Emily said pressing a finger to one of the buttons. “Hermione if you need anything don’t hesitate to ask.” She and Finn both stood up, both understanding they had just been dismissed. Hermione shook her hand again before following Finn to the door. </p>
<p>Hermione had in no way been prepared for what would happen next. Following Finn back out into the corridor she didn’t see the man who was waiting just outside of the office, it wasn’t until he spoke did, she take any notice of him. “Finn, what are you doing up here? I thought Em banished to twenty fifth floor last week.”  <br/>Hermione’s blood had run cold at the sound of the man’s voice, she would know the sound of that voice anywhere, in any life.  She looked up and grey eyes meet brown, Hermione was being forced to face with the last person she expected see here of all place. It was evident by the stunned looked she was receiving from the tall blond man he was just as surprised to see her, as she was to see him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Hermione.” The man said in nearly a whisper. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Draco.”</p>
