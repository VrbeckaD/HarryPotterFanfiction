    <p>Chapter 1</p><p>It was raining outside. The clouds hung high in the sky and a strong gust of wind had brushed against the windows. There was hardly any light at all. The dark clouds took over the world and sheltered the sun, making the day gloomier and duller.</p><p>Harry watched as the raindrops fell to the ground below. There were a few people walking in the streets. Most of them were rushing to find shelter to get away from the storm. Harry could barely make them out. All of them took the forms of blurry blobs.</p><p>The glass was fogged from the cold and a cloud had overtaken Harry's sight when his warm breath met the cold surface of the glass.</p><p>This was probably the worst storm yet. As far as he could remember, there was always a storm on Halloween. It never failed to happen. Harry somewhat suspected that he was the one who caused it. He caused a lot of things that were never really understood or proven. He could talk to snakes, make things appear out of thin air, and cause them to disappear without a trace. Sometimes, he would see weird creatures. One looked like a dead horse with wings and the others looked like ugly little creatures that hid in the hills and in the forest behind the orphanage. There was a time when he thought he even saw a ghost. But nobody ever believed him, even when he did something that was a lot more visible.  </p><p>With a wave of his hand or a simple thought, he could cause the impossible to happen. When he was feeling moody, the sun would disappear and clouds would appear where they previously had not. Sometimes, when he was angry, he would say something foolish or wish something terrible on someone and it would happen.</p><p>It was why everyone was scared of him and why nobody wanted him. The other kids would always stay far away from him, both in fear and in hate. They never said anything to his face, but he knew what they thought of him. They weren’t subtle and neither were the adults in the orphanage.</p><p>The staff would hardly look at him or offer him a greeting. He would hear them talk about him behind closed doors. He would watch them from afar as they would offer words of comfort to the others or provide gentle touches when they were scared or when they hurt themselves playing outside. There were a lot of things that they didn’t do for him like read to him or sing a soft song before bedtime. They would always give a small cupcake for the orphans when it was there birthday, but they never did it for him.</p><p>Harry couldn’t comprehend why they disliked him. It wasn’t his fault that he was the way he was- whatever he was. It just came naturally. There was a power, something indescribable, that filled him. It was always there in every step he took and in every breath, he breathed. It was around him and inside him. It was a wondrous feeling, but it was also something that made him dangerous.</p><p>The others, they couldn’t really understand or maybe they just never paid close enough attention, but either way, they could feel the power that radiant within Harry; whether they believed it or not. In the end, it scared them. And they always stayed away from him.</p><p>When they were younger, the other kids used to possess that childish indiscretion and would make poor choices and words. They used to mock him that his family didn’t want him (his aunt and uncle) even though a good chunk of them had similar situations.</p><p>They would ridicule him, bully him, and just be cruel to forget about their own disappointing lives. Harry didn’t know about his powers back then and so he didn't really fight back. He would stand still and listen to their hurtful words and hits until it just became too much.</p><p>They weren’t gentle. Harry nursed his stomach and his chest even though there were no more bruises or cuts; there were only the scars that remained now. But no matter how hard they hit him, Harry thinks their words were the ones that hurt the most.</p><p>They used to talk about his parents and how they were drunks that died in a car crash as the caretakers said. They would tell him that they didn’t love him; that they hated him. Their taunts were unoriginal and hypocritical, but they were children that lacked intellect. But it still hurt the same.</p><p>In the end, in an angry cry, Harry had just wished that they would go away, that their words would stop, and sometimes he even wished something terrible would happen to them. And it did.</p><p>Sometimes, it was just something simple like changing their hair color to a different one. Other times, he would silence them completely. They wouldn’t be able to speak for hours, sometimes days. The children knew it was because of him, but the staff just thought they were playing a trick and didn’t believe them when their voices came back.</p><p>However, there was one incident that could not be ignored.</p><p>There was one kid, Johnny McCormack, that was the cruelest out of all of them. He had gone missing in the orphanage and Harry knew that he was the one responsible for it. He didn’t know how or where he went, but Johnny McCormack was gone and he was not coming back. It caused a wide panic in the orphanage, but nobody had suspected that it was him. And why would they? There were rumors of course. Mostly created by the children, but even they didn’t think Harry was powerful enough to do such a thing.</p><p>At first, Harry was horrified that he did it, not even sure of how he did it in the first place. But in the end, it didn’t matter anymore. Some part of him, a darker part, agreed that it was for the best because now he was no longer there to torment him. Harry still didn’t think it was right, but he didn’t know to undo what he did and it just became a shadow of regret.</p><p>Ever since then, he made more things happen intentionally or not, and now everyone stayed away from him.</p><p>Even if the children were cruel and the staff had ignored him, none of them dared speak a word to his face and all of them, even if they had wanted to warn them, never said anything to the visitors wishing to adopt a child. Would they wish it was them and not Harry? Of course, they did, but it was better to get rid of the problem and give it to somebody else. Yet, even complete strangers could see that something was off and Harry never passed the first meeting. Nobody ever came back for him.</p><p>Their taunts and remarks were cruel, but there was some level of truth to them. Nobody wanted Harry Potter. It was something that Harry had then accepted as he got older and was something that he had to face when he was eighteen and was legally an adult.</p><p>Happily, the orphanage sent him away, hoping to never hear a word of him again. All of the children that Harry grew up with were already gone, missing, adopted, or sent to a foster family. He was once sent to a foster family, but they were cruel and he did something terrible. They soon sent him back and he never ventured past the gates again. Since then, it was just him. Even now as he watched the world move by through the window of the train, he was alone. It was taking him to a place forgotten, yet not unknown.</p><p>Harry didn't know anything about his parents. The only thing he knew was their names and the gossip the women in the orphaned spread during tea times and dinner. From what he's learned, they were a waste of space. One of the caretakers had said that it was a good thing that they were gone, but then another had argued that it led to them dealing with Harry instead. They all agreed that it was the worst fate.</p><p>Besides the fact that they died in a car crash, according to the statement left by his aunt that he had never met, there was nothing else. He didn't know who they were or what they looked like. Or if he even looked like them. He didn't know anything.</p><p>When he was younger, he craved for his parents' return like most orphans do. But how can you want something back that you didn't know was lost? Other kids can still remember their parents’ touch, their smell, their smiles, but Harry doesn't remember anything. The only thing he deems as a memory is a scream calling out his name and intense pain.</p><p>Unintentionally, Harry picked at his scar. The wound has long since healed: rigid and pale. Sometimes it burned hot and brought the most splitting headaches, but mostly it brought nightmares that kept him up at night.</p><p>The scar, Harry knew, was a visible reminder of his life and their death.</p><p>There was nothing he could do about it now, but he still wished that it never existed at all. Sometimes, he wished that he didn't make it out of that car crash.</p><p>Pressing his head against the cold glass, Harry watched as the traffic continued and the storm began to worsen. The lights in the train began to flicker and for a split second, he feared that it would shut down, but it would buzz back to life and it continued its way.  He had been living on his own for almost a year now. The government had been preparing him for some time before his eighteenth birthday. They prepared living compensations for a brief period and helped him find a job. After the first few months, they left him with a bit of money, but he was from then on his own. He worked at a bookstore not far from his apartment. It was a bit rundown and cramped, but it paid the bills. He mostly spent his time reading books to pass the time and cleaning the floors and windows. It was nothing hard, but the owners were very rude and spiteful. Harry hated to work there and had tried to find another job, but he didn't find anyone willing to take him.</p><p>For the whole year he spent living on his own, he lived on repeat with nothing different or new. His apartment was more of a closet than it was a room. It was small, cramped, cold, and dark. It was cheap in every sense of the word, but Harry couldn't afford to live anywhere else and spent his days there much like he did in the orphanage: alone. In a way, it was both tormenting as it was comforting. It was something that he knew well and was, in a way, stability. But either way, Harry didn't care for it and once he was able to scrap enough money (skipping meals and walking home late at night instead of taking the bus), he bought a train ticket to a large town in Cokeworth.</p><p>The town, Harry learned, was nothing impressive. It was chilly and drifted. It was large and unseemly. The river was dirty and the ground was overgrown with trash. The sky was often dark, filled with chimney smoke and clouds. The place was completely depressing. However, despite the state of the town, it was the closest one by train and was the only one that seemed to have a large supply of jobs. It was a risk going there, but Harry didn't have any better plans. So, with four hundred pounds in his pocket, Harry took a train and was making his way to the only hotel he knew: Railview Hotel.</p><p>The hotel was just as depressing as it was with the rest of the town. The name, Railview, was as it said: a view of the rail.</p><p>The town was large for its biggest export of factory work of steel and copper. Harry never dreamed of himself to work at a factory, but then again, Harry never dared to dream at all. Either way, it was something different in a certain way. Harry wasn't quite sure why he picked to leave in the first place. There was something here that was drawing him towards it. It was something odd yet electrifying and Harry followed it all the same.</p><p>He suspected that it had to do with his powers. Despite his history with curses and jinxes, Harry was not in control of his powers. They would come every now and then, especially when he upset or angry. Sometimes when thought hard enough, he could control it at will for short periods of time, but even then, it was quite exhausting and he hardly ever used it unless it was for an emergency. There were times when he would forget about them entirely. It was only when someone tried to rob him in an alley or when he was deep in a nightmare that it shook the building that they returned to protect him. When he was at the orphanage, it was mostly chance. He did try to control them, but he never really understood what he was doing and thought he was crazy. In the end, he just chose to never use them in case he does something worse than what he did to McCormack.</p><p>When Harry's train came to a stop, he gathered what little he brought and exited the station. Taking a guess, Harry made his way south and walked past the endless miles of brick houses in hopes of finding the dreaded hotel. He had called earlier in hopes that they would have a room for him. It was reserved for him and would cost extra when he entered. Clutching the pounds in his hand, Harry almost mourned the loss of it. One night at the hotel would take almost a hundred pounds- that was without breakfast and dinner.</p><p>With every step Harry took, he became less sure about his adventure and wished for his dirty bed at the apartment he left behind. At least there, he knew he had a room for at least a few months with no extra wages. Harry supposed he could trick the owners or 'make' more money if he tried really hard, but he was not very good with the art of the mind nor was he good at changing the forms of one thing to another, to begin with. Hopefully, he would have enough strength to do something about it.</p><p>As Harry continued to walk, it was about mid-day, not that Harry could tell, and there were a few people walking about. He tried to not draw too much attention to himself and mostly kept his eyes down and his feet moving forward. He would sometimes push his glasses back up his nose when they threaten to fall, but he mostly kept his hands at his sides and avoided the crowd much like they avoided him. This is why it was such a surprise when he felt the warm body of man crash against his arm. Looking up startled, Harry caught the eye of a man with pale skin, black hair, and haunting black eyes. He was not very good looking, his nose too big and crooked. His lips were thin and were beginning to form a sneer, his mouth was opened slightly showing somewhat crooked, yellow teeth. In that split second, those narrowed eyes widen slightly.</p><p>“James,” he heard, barely audible that Harry had thought he had imagined it. Harry was about to apologize when those eyes narrowed in suspicion and he found himself with a stick pressed against his neck.</p><p>Immediately, both the rain and time had stopped as they gazed upon each other. Before Harry could say anything, the man yanked him close and pressed himself against him. Instantly, Harry felt like he was being pushed into a small tube. The feeling made his head spin and his body ache. His stomach turned in agony, empty with the exception of bile that threatens to escape his lips, but Harry pushed it down. Closing his eyes in pain, Harry felt himself be pushed against a wall. It was quiet and warm. He could hear the crackling of a fire and could smell more dust than smoke. The air was tense and thick from pressure instead of pollution. When he was finally able to open his eyes, Harry caught sight of the inside of a living room. It was mostly bear with the exception of a few couches, shelves filled with books, tables covered in papers, and a mantle. Beneath his feet laid a rug, old and worn with a few holes and stains. From the corner of his eye, he could make out a wooden staircase, dull in color and in structure. But Harry barely minded that as he was still faced to face with the man from before.</p><p>Up close, Harry could see the man's face a lot more vividly. His eyes were truly black, not even the gleam of the fire provided any light within them. Harry almost felt fearful of the man before him, something he had never felt before in his life. Harry swallowed thickly and the man pressed his stick deeper into the side of his throat. Harry raised his head to provide more space, but he could hardly move with his head so close to the wall.</p><p>His breath began to deepen as he couldn't quite catch his breath and Harry had hoped that the man would speak or do anything really. Preferably, he would remove his stick and his hold on Harry.</p><p>Almost in a trance, the man raised one hand towards his face, stopping briefly when Harry flinched, but he reached out anyway and held his head carefully. It was like he was scared that he would disappear from his touch despite that he had his whole body pressed against Harry.</p><p>His hand was cold, faintly discolored, and filled with stains of pale yellows, greens, and blacks. The rest of his body, covered in deep black robes, was warmer, but Harry hardly noticed it when the stranger directed his face towards his own. It was like he was lost as he searched for something on Harry's face, taking extra care and attention towards his scar, but nothing could match to the absolute sadness that filled his eyes when he caught Harry's green ones.</p><p>Harry's mouth felt dry and he licked his lips to wet them. The action caught the stranger's eye and he instead transferred his attention to Harry's lips instead for a split second. It was enough to break him from his trance.</p><p>The stick was still deeply pressed against his throat, but the man's face was more guarded and his eyes had become blank.</p><p>"Who are you?" he demanded. His voice was thick and sultry like velvet. Harry could feel the rumble in his chest against his own when he spoke. It was somewhat intimate, almost dark and forbidden. Harry had almost forgotten how to breathe and had totally disregarded the man's question until he said it again more forcefully.</p><p>"Harry- my name is Harry Potter," he whispered, but his answer seemed to anger the man even more.</p><p>If possible, he pressed his stick more deeply into his throat. Harry thought he was trying to stab him with it alone or to at least try and choke him instead.</p><p>“That’s impossible,” said the man. “Harry Potter is dead.”</p><p>Harry’s brows furrowed in confusion since he was quite sure that he was alive. But he never got the chance to defend himself when he felt a small tickle in his mind. It started off slow and careful, but it soon became forceful and painful. It felt like there were hundreds of shard glass being stabbed against his mind. Harry feared for a split second that his mind was going to explode. He barely registered the moving images of his memories: the orphanage, McCormick, Harry talking to snakes, watching the other kids stay away from him, the caretakers whispering about him behind closed doors, waking up from nightmares in cold sweat, the train ride…</p><p>With a cry, Harry pushed against the intrusion and he felt the man in front of him stumble slightly as if he was burned. It was enough for him to push the man away from him. Harry felt himself collapse to the floor. His face was scrunched in pain and he clutched his head. Bile was beginning to rise and there were tears on his cheeks.</p><p>The man had regained his composure and had aimed his wand towards Harry’s face. Harry watched with hooded eyes. He wasn’t sure what the strange man did, but Harry never wanted it to happen again.</p><p>“Don’t touch me!” cried Harry. With a vengeful thought, Harry cast a cursed towards the man. Hopefully, his powers will distract the man long enough for Harry to get away and call the police, but to his surprise, the man waved his stick and deflected the curse like it was nothing.</p><p>Harry couldn’t take his eyes away from the man in front of him. In that split second, Harry felt the same power that radiant in him was escaping from the man. This man, this stranger, was like him.</p><p>“Who are you?” whispered Harry. The man watched him with a critical eye. The silenced loomed over them for what felt like forever, but the man spoke in that velvety voice once again.</p><p>“I’m Severus Snape.”</p><p><br/> <br/> </p>
