  <p>Tracey</p>
</center>Tracey Davis had walked into her boss' office the first opportunity she had to pitch her article about inter-House unity that didn't involve Dumbledore's Army and actually included Slytherins who didn't agree with You-Know-Who's takeover of Hogwarts, but it was poor timing. Before she could make the request, she was immediately assigned to an article that took almost six months of researching, traveling, and writing.<p>Then again, she could also view it as decent timing since she needed a big distraction after ending her relationship with Ben. Apparently, he's dating someone new now – a Hufflepuff girl who's a year younger than them. So she hears.</p><p>But now that her article is done – a piece on international trade relations with the UK in the aftermath of You-Know-Who (dreadfully dull, to be honest, even though she got to travel to the United States, Canada, Argentina, France, Russia, and China) – she finally pitches her idea: an inside scoop of the underground book lending system at Hogwarts.</p><p>Her boss, William Fraser – a man whose age she isn't quite sure she can pinpoint: sometimes in the right lighting, he looks as young as thirty-something, others, she's sure he's close to fifty – furrows his brow at her pitch. She fights the urge to play with a curl of her hair.</p><p>(She’s heard that he’s the superior editor-in-chief in comparison to Barnabas Cuffe, who was quickly forced out in the aftermath of the Battle of Hogwarts; he just couldn’t be trusted after what had happened over the last few years between being a mouthpiece for the government and everything else.)</p><p>Fraser hums. "Is this the thing that Longbottom said he ran with that Slytherin girl?"</p><p>"Her name is Daphne Greengrass. She's actually one of my dearest friends," Tracey corrects. "And yes. But that's the thing – he didn't start it. Another Slytherin did."</p><p>His brow furrows further, aging him. "Why would he lie about that? Fame getting to his head?" he questions out loud, already trying to find an angle to the story.</p><p>"Longbottom is genuinely as nice as he appears – he's not obsessed with fame," Tracey says with a roll of his eyes.</p><p>"Then why lie?"</p><p>"To protect the one who really started it."</p><p>"Who started it? Your attempt at suspense is only irritating me."</p><p>Tracey tries not to be offended. "Theodore Nott. He was in my year – his father –"</p><p>"Of course, I know who his father is. One of the original Death Eaters – his <i>son</i>, you're claiming –"</p><p>"I'm not <i>claiming</i>, it <i>is</i> true –"</p><p>"He started a secret book lending system behind his father's back. Why?"</p><p>"Because he obviously didn't approve what was going on at Hogwarts. You weren't there – you didn't know what it was like that year." Tracey hates thinking about how she expected so much better out of her last year at school and instead felt paralyzing fear most of the time. "I think it's pretty telling he didn't immediately become a Death Eater once You-Know-Who had taken over Hogwarts like all the others. I mean, look at Malfoy and Crabbe and Goyle –"</p><p>"Okay, fine, but <i>if </i>that's the case – the kid has been gone for <i>two years</i>. He ran off presumably during the Battle of Hogwarts. Why? And why stay away if the side he wanted to win had won?"</p><p>Tracey shrugs. "I don't know. I didn't know him well. Nobody did, really. But I think this story is worth exploring. I mean, you have two of the biggest leaders of the resistance assisting with this and <i>trusting</i> Nott, the son of a prominent Death Eater, enough to do it. They were already risking a lot with Dumbledore's Army."</p><p>Fraser exhales, leaning back in his chair as he thinks. She forces herself not to fidget.</p><p>"Interesting," he allows. "Although I'm not sure about having you write it."</p><p>"I guarantee you that Daphne will not talk to anyone else," Tracey says with forced calmness. "And you won't get the full story without her."</p><p>"Hm, of course. Slytherins must stick together."</p><p>Tracey ignores the snide comment. "This is <i>my</i> story. I'm the only one here with any sort of real perspective on it. Nobody else was there <i>and</i> managed to get glimpses of what was going on. Ask anyone – as Richards, ask Corrigan – they don't know a thing –"</p><p>"What did you mean about 'not getting the full story without her'?" he interrupts her.</p><p>She raises her eyebrows and purses her mouth.</p><p>"Ah, I see." The corner of his mouth twitches. She thinks it might be begrudging respect. "Alright. Fine. I'll let you start working on it."</p><p>"I'll need to go to Japan. Daphne is currently working there."</p><p>This time he properly grimaces. "Fine."</p><p>"I'll reach out to all parties and see about picking a date to have everyone be available."</p><p>"A group interview?" he asks, unconvinced.</p><p>"It'll be the first time they will be in the same space together," she says with a smile.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>**</p>
</center>Tracey spends the extra money to send Daphne a letter quickly, informing her that the article has been approved and which possible dates would work for her and her busy schedule.<p>She gets a response a week later, the handwriting off like Daphne hasn't written in a while, which is preposterous until Tracey remembers that she's probably been writing in Japanese for the most part over the last five months. Daphne suggests the beginning of April, referencing the blooming of cherry blossoms. </p><p>Tracey finds out that Lovegood has been traveling around the world and is difficult to get in touch with, so she reaches out to Longbottom, who has begun studying under Professor Sprout to replace her. Rumors, of course, but Tracey believes them.</p><p>Longbottom responds with enthusiasm – exclamation points and all – and says he can go to Japan for the requested dates and he will let Lovegood know.</p><p>Tracey thanks him and says she's looking forward to it.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>**</p>
</center>They're meeting at a garden – a temple, really – where Daphne has reserved a small tea house for the afternoon. Tracey had imagined the interview occurring in her grandparents' house, but she supposes Daphne doesn't want the risk of others knowing where her family lives. She also knows that the Greengrass family is not nearly as wealthy as they were before the fall of You-Know-Who, but she supposes that Daphne's maternal grandparents are still very much comfortable in their finances.<p><i>The Daily Prophet</i> has connections all over the world, so Tracey will be staying at a small inn located somewhere in Kyoto for two nights – Tracey figures that Daphne will at least point her in the right direction when the time comes.</p><p>The Portkey to Kyoto is scheduled for first thing Thursday morning – Kyoto is eight hours ahead of London, so she will arrive just after lunch. While she waits for the activation, yawning every other moment, she's surprised when Longbottom comes in two minutes before, out of breath and winded, his shirt untucked and his jumper on backwards, Tracey believes.</p><p>"Made it," Longbottom sighs. He spots Tracey at once. "Hello – I had thought you'd left earlier!" he greets her.</p><p>"Could only come today. I just hope I can wake up," Tracey says. "Your jumper I believe is on backwards, by the way."</p><p>Longbottom flushes and scrambles within his jumper, twisting it so it's the right way. "Thanks," he says, rubbing the back his neck for a second before trying to tuck in his shirt. "Totally overslept. I was trying to take care of –"</p><p>"One minute," Tracey overhears someone yell.</p><p>Tracey politely smiles at Longbottom, grateful to have been spared whatever held him up. "Well, you made it just in time."</p><p>Once he's put himself together, his strong arm pressed up against hers, she realizes that Longbottom is definitely not the same boy he was at school; a definite improvement.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>**</p>
</center>Going through customs is relatively quick, even though Tracey is asked specific, pointed questions regarding her article and why she was interviewing a Japanese citizen.<p>(Tracey had no idea that Daphne had dual citizenship. But Tracey isn't surprised – Daphne likes her secrets.)</p><p>When they walk outside, Tracey immediately spots Daphne, who has cut her hair a little shorter, but otherwise looks the same. She smiles brightly – well, brightly in Daphne's case, which is rather tame in comparison to other people – and raises her hand.</p><p>"<i>Ohayo</i>! Hi!"</p><p>"Hey, Daphne!"</p><p>Tracey hugs Daphne, remembers to keep it brief. </p><p>"<i>Ohayo-gozaimsu</i>!" Longbottom greets in a clunky manner.</p><p>Daphne smiles. "You can just say <i>ohayo</i> – we're friendly enough."</p><p>"So -<i>gozaimsu</i> makes it polite?"</p><p>"Essentially."</p><p>Tracey doesn't follow, but she was never very good with languages, even when her parents wanted her to learn French as a child.</p><p>"I'm assuming you're both staying at –" Daphne says a name Tracey thinks sounds like the inn's name, but she only recognizes how it looks spelled out in English.</p><p>"No, actually, I'm staying with an acquaintance of Professor Sprout's…Sara Kobayashi? She wants to meet me to see if I can intern under her."</p><p>Daphne smiles in amusement. "Of course."</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"Names can be written using different kanji, which gives names different meanings. Sara, for example can mean good fortune and also mean vivid blossom. Kobayashi means small forest. So, it's fitting that you're to study Herbology under her," Daphne explains while they walk. </p><p>Longbottom's eyes widen. "Wow! That's amazing!"</p><p>"I can Apparate you individually. It's about an hour outside of the city, just…" Daphne trails, eyes roaming before landing on a particular street. "Ah, soko…"</p><p>Daphne explains that magic is weaved into the city, that there isn't a designated place in Kyoto where wizards can congregate and shop like Diagon Alley in London. She says it's subtle, that information travels mostly through word of mouth, but sometimes, markings can be found on shop signs, or something will catch the eye of a witch or wizard but not a Muggle…</p><p>Daphne leads them into a tea shop. The owner, presumably, greets them and Daphne requests something in Japanese, the owner nodding and leading them to the back.</p><p>"Stay here, I'll come get you," Daphne says, grabbing Longbottom's arm first and Disapparating with a loud <i>pop</i>.</p><p>Tracey barely has time to look around the room when Daphne comes back for her. "You really love it here?" Tracey questions before Daphne can take her arm.</p><p>Daphne blinks. "It's home," she tells her.</p><p>Tracey doesn't know if that's a real answer or not. Daphne takes her arm and they're off.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>**</p>
</center>They walk down the bottom of a hill in silence. When they get to the entrance, Luna Lovegood is waiting outside. She's humming to herself and looking up at the sky. Nothing about her has changed over the years – she's even wearing an ugly pair of earrings and mismatched socks.<p>"Luna! I'm glad you got my letter!" Longbottom exclaims, walking toward her to hug her.</p><p>"I just received it yesterday. A new acquaintance of mine said he was coming to the area, so I came with him. We're going to travel around Japan together."</p><p>"Who is it?" Longbottom asks.</p><p>"Rolf. He's very nice."</p><p>Longbottom's eyebrows shoot up. "Rolf Scamander? Really?"</p><p>Tracey's eyes widen, but she doesn't say anything. </p><p>"Runs in the family, I suppose," Daphne says, unphased. "Shall we? We only have this garden reserved for a few hours."</p><p>They begin walking through the entrance down the trail. Tracey soaks in the garden, forming sentences in her mind to develop the opening paragraph or two – something akin to being transported to a different kind of living. </p><p>"I'm surprised you were able to do that, given that this time of year brings people from all over the world," Lovegood says.</p><p>Daphne doesn't respond for a moment. "I did a favor for the family."</p><p>They arrive at what Daphne explains that the building is a temple turned tea house that has been run by the same family for hundreds of years. The family in question – an elderly couple – comes outside to greet them, bowing. Daphne and Lovegood follow suit, with Longbottom doing the same a few seconds afterward.</p><p>"You're just in time," the old man says in English, thankfully.</p><p>"One of your party arrived fifteen minutes ago. We're very impressed with his Japanese. He says he taught himself – most remarkable."</p><p>"Who –?" Tracey starts, looking at Lovegood, Longbottom – </p><p>Daphne has never been one to showcase her emotions – she's careful of her face revealing too much, but given that Tracey has been her friend for years, she can recognize certain things – mainly from her eyes, but sometimes, she'll purse her mouth in disapproval, her eyebrows will raise in disbelief, her nose will wrinkle in disgust –</p><p>But Tracey has never seen Daphne's mouth parted, her eyes alight in surprise and, dare Tracey say…happiness?</p><p>In the blink of an eye, Daphne is back to her serious self, speaking quickly in Japanese to the couple, who seem to answer positively, judging by their nods and smiles.</p><p>"<i><span title="Yes go ahead.">Hai, dozo</span></i>," they say, stepping to the side.</p><p>Daphne walks forward and Lovegood skips behind her, grinning from ear to ear. "Do you feel it?" she asks excitedly.</p><p>"Feel what?" Longbottom questions.</p><p>"He's here!"</p><p><i>He</i> being Nott, Tracey realizes with a shock. He's sitting on a cushion on the floor, calmly drinking tea. He glances up to look at them. Tracey never liked the way he looked at people, like he was studying them, or worse, he already knew what he was looking at and was indifferent. There's an intensity that always put her on edge.</p><p>"Self-taught?" Daphne questions in lieu of a greeting.</p><p>"<i><span title="It is difficult, but I am motivated.">Sore wa muzukashīdesuga…watashi wa iyoku-tekidesu,</span></i>" Nott says a tad slowly, but he doesn't stumble over his words.</p><p>A smile slowly blooms on Daphne's face. "<i><span title="Is that so?">Sōdesu ka. </span></i>"</p><p>To Tracey's immense surprise, a small smile flashes on Nott's face. </p><p>"I thought I felt you here, but I didn't want to say anything," Lovegood says happily, taking the seat beside Nott. "You still leave traces."</p><p>"Perhaps that was on purpose," he quips.</p><p>"It never is." She reaches to the cup in Nott's hand and takes it, placing it in front of him. "You're being rude, you should greet everyone properly. We haven't seen you in a long time."</p><p>There's a flash of amusement in Nott's eyes before he stands up, walking towards Daphne. "<i><span title="It has been a long time [formal]">Ohisashiburi-desu ne,</span></i>" he says.</p><p>"<i><span title="It has been a long time [casual]">Hisashiburi,</span></i> " she says, almost like a correction.</p><p>He nods his head in acknowledgement. Tracey is almost disappointed when he turns to Longbottom and holds out his hand. "Longbottom," he greets.</p><p>Tracey tries to catch Daphne's eye, but Daphne has already turned toward the elderly couple and has begun conversing with them in Japanese.</p><p>"Hi Davis, it's been a while."</p><p>Tracey turns to look at Nott, who has also held out his hand. He still looks the same, she thinks while shaking his hand – his grip is firm, and he keeps eye contact with her. He is still tall, his eyes still intense and almost strange, his face and body lean, but there are some small changes: his hair seems more windswept and his clothes don't seem as perfectly pressed as they were while they were in school.</p><p>"How did you find out about this?" Tracey asks, busying herself with taking out her notebook, ink, and quill.</p><p>"I have eyes and ears everywhere," he says with his hands behind his back.</p><p>"Vague," she mutters, but writes down the quote all the same.</p><p>"That's the point."</p><p>He goes back to his seat and Longbottom goes to sit across from Lovegood. Daphne rejoins their group and offers the seat at the head of the table to Tracey. "You're running this – it's only appropriate," she says before lowering herself down on the seat across from Nott.</p><p>Tracey steels herself and drops her writing materials onto the table before reaching into her bag for her camera. "Do you mind? I would like to take a few."</p><p>They all murmur some version of, 'not at all,' so Tracey brings the camera up to her face. Lovegood grins widely, Longbottom smiles normally, Daphne's mouth is slightly turned up, and Nott stares blankly. Tracey sighs and takes the picture.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>**</p>
</center>They are all served tea and there are sweets on the table. Once the shoji is shut, they sit in silence.<p>"So, how does it feel to be together in the same room for the first time?" Tracey asks.</p><p>They all look at each other.</p><p>"A little strange," Daphne admits.</p><p>"Weird," Longbottom offers.</p><p>Nott nods in agreement.</p><p>"I think it's lovely," Lovegood says.</p><p>Longbottom smiles at Lovegood. "That too."</p><p>Tracey smiles a little. "I guess I should start from the beginning: how did the book lending system come about? I know it started in October or November, but then it really picked up speed in February. What happened during that timeline?"</p><p>Daphne, Lovegood, and Longbottom look to Nott.</p><p>"I started acquiring my collection after the book burning that occurred," Nott begins to explain. "I didn't care for my access to knowledge being so restricted. But Daphne caught me reading one of the banned books and asked to borrow it…and <i>she</i> was then caught," he narrows his eyes at Daphne, but Tracey is mostly…or pretty sure…that Nott is amused.</p><p>"I think Tracey has turned out trustworthy, yes?" Daphne retorts.</p><p>Nott's gaze flickers to Tracey, who tries not to feel so flustered; she had completely forgotten about that – catching Daphne reading that textbook. </p><p>"And then, more Slytherins had heard about it because that House cannot keep a secret," Nott continues, rolling his eyes.</p><p>"Ravenclaw found out," Lovegood interjects. "And I became a happy customer."</p><p>"It was admittedly disjointed, the initial roll out," Nott says. "But regular security checks, as you remember, didn't properly start until later on."</p><p>"That's the thing – we obviously had no access to any sort of schedule – how did you find out? Was your father involved?" Tracey asks.</p><p>"No. A professor was helpful in providing some information regarding the random security checks."</p><p>"Are we allowed to disclose?" Tracey trails off, looking at all of them.</p><p>They all look at each other. "We'll get back to you," Longbottom says.</p><p>Tracey has a feeling it's Professor McGonagall, but she doesn't say anything. "But you were caught – the first time," Tracey says, getting back on track.</p><p>"Unfortunately, a fifth year was and informed the staff that I was responsible."</p><p>"I missed this. I was imprisoned in the Malfoy Manor during this time," Lovegood says, but Tracey is surprised by the lucidity of her eyes, how cold they are.</p><p>"That's when I came in. I returned a book that Luna had borrowed," Longbottom continues.</p><p>"But that was in January…right? Is when you were caught and did detention for over a month, right?"</p><p>"Six weeks," Nott agrees. "One week for every book in circulation."</p><p>"That was a lie," Tracey states rather than questions.</p><p>"I was off by about thirty."</p><p>Tracey had no idea how expansive it was. She has a hard time remembering what she did that year that was more important than this.</p><p>"How did you come to the decision to start it again?"</p><p>Nott looks to Daphne; they seem to be remembering. "We had bumped into each other on the grounds while everyone was in Hogsmeade for Valentine's Day. He suggested it, and I agreed to help," Daphne says slowly.</p><p>Tracey remembers that trip to Hogsmeade. Ben had bought her a silver bracelet and said she was the most beautiful person he knew. They had snogged almost the entire time. She remembers coming back and talking with Daphne, showing her the bracelet and the chocolates, giving her a box since she felt badly that she stayed behind to be with her ill sister, but Tracey didn't pay attention to Daphne, didn't ask how her day went.</p><p>Tracey supposes Daphne would've just lied anyway, but still feels like a bad friend.</p><p>"So, it started again, and you had a contract this time, that I can recall, and…Daphne, you went to Longbottom?"</p><p>"During Herbology," Longbottom confirms. "But I didn't agree until I spoke with Nott."</p><p>"I'm surprised you agreed," Nott says.</p><p>"The thing is…I felt like what you were saying…was something along the lines of what a Slytherin would think. Not a Death Eater. If that makes sense. It was when I realized that the two could really be separated," Longbottom thinks out loud.</p><p>Nott raises an eyebrow. "You told me I would've made a terrible Death Eater."</p><p>"I still stand by that," Longbottom says with a grin, picking up a sweet.</p><p>"What, why?" Tracey asks, confused.</p><p>"Because he's a terrible follower," Daphne answers for them.</p><p>Longbottom looks surprised.</p><p>"I came to that conclusion a long time ago," Daphne says with a small shrug before taking a sip of her tea.</p><p>"Why?" Tracey asks, looking at Nott.</p><p>Nott stares at her.</p><p>"Why didn't you want to be a Death Eater?" she continues, forcing to keep her tone even.</p><p>"I thought we were discussing the book lending enterprise," Nott says without missing a beat.</p><p>"We are. But this is important. This was your idea – if you had become a Death Eater, or were waiting to be one, would you have really done all this?"</p><p>Nott stares at Tracey with a cool expression. </p><p>"I wouldn't have believed in you if I thought for a moment you'd become a Death Eater," Lovegood says, breaking the tense silence.</p><p>"And I wouldn't have gone along with this if I hadn't trusted Luna," Longbottom adds.</p><p>"So maybe you should ask Luna," Nott offers, drinking his tea.</p><p>Tracey finds Nott <i>irritating</i>, but she hates more how he unsettles her.</p><p>"Theodore," Daphne starts.</p><p>"Theodore has always been a solitary person," Lovegood says, eyes looking into space, her voice soft. "He always wanted to do things in his way and when someone got in the way of it, he made a point to do what he wanted <i>and</i> more."</p><p>"So…out of spite?" Longbottom suggests. "And profit, of course."</p><p>Nott snorts into his cup.</p><p>Tracey puts down her quill in annoyance.</p><p>"Theodore, <i><span title="It is okay.">daijobu,</span></i>" Daphne says.</p><p>"<i><span title="Why should I?">Doshite watashi ga kon'na koto ni</span></i>?" Nott shoots back.</p><p>"<i><span title="Because it is important.">Jūyōdakara</span></i>."</p><p>"<i><span title="For whom?">Dare no tame</span></i>?"</p><p>"Them, you, me, us," Daphne says in English, nodding towards the table, placing a hand over her heart.</p><p>Nott breathes.</p><p>Tracey swallows.</p><p>Nott shuts his eyes briefly, takes another long sip of his tea, then looks to Tracey. "I hated my father for over ten years. People can speculate as to why. I knew from a young age that I would never follow in his footsteps." He looks away and sips his tea again.</p><p>"I'm assuming then, that your father didn't know," Tracey says quietly.</p><p>"I played my part to be left unbothered."</p><p>Tracey busies herself writing because she can't stand the uncomfortable silence.</p><p>"This food is really amazing, Daphne, what are they?" Lovegood asks.</p><p>"They're called <i>wagashi</i>, which usually made of <i>mochi</i>, a, uh…type of bean paste, and fruits. They're confectionery sweets," Daphne explains. She points to each one and describes what they're made of. Some of them sound disgusting to Tracey, but since she's eaten three of them willingly, she figures sometimes it's best not to know what's in the things you eat.</p><p>Once they're finished, Daphne stands and says, "We can walk around the gardens. Maybe we can speak off the record."</p><p>Tracey puts away her things and drapes her camera around her neck.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>**</p>
</center>Tracey immediately understands what Lovegood had meant about everyone traveling from all over the world to come here to see the cherry blossoms. She practically wastes a roll of film solely on photographing them.<p>But she also takes pictures of the four of them, walking behind them to get a group shot. Daphne makes sure to tell her it's incredibly cheesy, but only after Tracey gets the photograph.</p><p>Tracey asks Nott why he ended the system. There was still over a month left of school – why not go until the very end?</p><p>"Because we were barely keeping up with the increasing security after the Easter holiday," Nott explains, picking a cherry blossom off his shoulder. "The risks outweighed the benefits."</p><p>"<i>I</i> thought it was too risky," Daphne says, coming up on Nott's other side. "I asked to end it. He went along with it."</p><p>"I agreed with your reasoning. Besides, I didn't much fancy having detention for the rest of the year," Nott points out.</p><p>Daphne sighs. "That's it, essentially. Then it ended."</p><p>Tracey looks ahead to find Lovegood and Longbottom looking up at the trees. They're holding hands, but Tracey thinks it's platonic, so she doesn't bother photographing it. Besides, she's not involved in the gossip section of <i>The Prophet</i>.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>**</p>
</center>"How did the book lending system help Dumbledore's Army?"<p>Longbottom lowers his head and looks at Tracey. "Well, since we weren't learning a thing in school, it helped for us to self-teach. For everyone in sixth year or below, we used notes and old tests and textbooks to teach them, but for seventh years…we had to learn things for ourselves. So, I'd say it was extremely helpful."</p><p>"I have another question that's for you and Lovegood," Tracey curls her hair behind her ear and ends up pulling out a cherry blossom. "Why wasn't Ginny Weasley involved? I mean, you three were leaders of the DA that year…doesn't really make sense to leave one of them out of this."</p><p>Lovegood and Longbottom look at each other. "Well, I mean…" Longbottom starts, wincing.</p><p>"Ginny didn't want to fraternize. Which was fine. I love her, but she is stubborn in her ways," Lovegood says.</p><p>"Off the record. That was off the record," Longbottom says quickly, pleadingly.</p><p>Tracey looks over to Daphne, who has a stern expression. Nott, standing beside her, is...almost understanding, which, considering, made sense; he didn’t bother fraternizing at all.</p><p>"I suggest a rephrasing in the next minute, Longbottom, or that's going to print," Tracey says, unable to keep the anger out of her tone.</p><p>The Weasleys are untouchable. Insulting them would only lower her credibility.</p><p>"Ginny was the leader of the DA, at least until Easter," Longbottom says slowly. "That was her main focus. Everything else…she trusted to us. She was busy, that's why."</p><p>Tracey shakes her head, but writes it down.</p><p>"She's grateful, too. I mean, she definitely learned from the books we had."</p><p>"That's wonderful," Daphne says with so much sarcasm that Tracey snorts.</p><p>"I'm sorry," Longbottom says. "I'm not saying it was right. It was a horrible time for everyone. I tried to make things right afterward."</p><p>Daphne's eyes soften. "I know. You're one of the few."</p><p>"As far as I'm concerned, the only Slytherin who should be punished and hasn't been is Draco Malfoy," Lovegood states.</p><p>"Off the record," Daphne says at once.</p><p>Tracey looks at her in surprise.</p><p>"My sister is dating him. I can't, I'm sorry," Daphne explains to Lovegood.</p><p>Lovegood stares at her for a few seconds. "One day your loyalty to your family will cost you more than you're willing to give."</p><p>"<i>Luna</i>," Nott says sharply to Lovegood, who stares back, unphased. Daphne aborts a movement toward Nott.</p><p>Nott looks to Tracey, his face still holding traces of anger. "Davis, please ask your next question."</p><p>To lighten the mood and move on from that awkward exchange that she doesn't understand the context of, Tracey asks, "I don't suppose you'll tell me where you're hiding?"</p><p>"No. My apologies," he responds flatly.</p><p>"Couldn't hurt to ask."</p><p>They continue walking and eventually, the tension and awkwardness fades. There's a small lake with lily pads and vibrant fish. Lovegood plops herself by the lake and wiggles her fingers in the water.</p><p>"I have to ask – it can be off the record – but…how do you put up with her? She's…<i>Loony Lovegood</i>," Tracey asks Nott.</p><p>Nott stares at Lovegood for a moment. "I rather like her unconventional thinking. She's smarter than most people. That can be on the record."</p><p>Tracey blinks in surprise and notes it like a good reporter.</p><p>“So, I guess my next question is…when do you plan on coming home?” Tracey asks.</p><p>“I have something in the works,” Nott responds in a vague manner.</p><p>Tracey rolls her eyes to look at Daphne, who is staring at Nott like she’s trying to read him. Nott glances at Daphne, holding her gaze for a few moments. Daphne raises her eyebrows and gives him a small smile.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>**</p>
</center>Tracey gets a shot of Nott against the cherry blossoms – he’s looking ahead, then up, and for a moment, he shuts his eyes in peace. She’s grateful that Lovegood laughs loudly and it masks the click and shutter of the camera. She’ll develop that for Daphne, if she wants.<center>
  <p>**</p>
</center>"I'm asking you as your friend," Tracey starts, putting away her notepad to reinforce her point. Lovegood, Longbottom, and Nott are further away. Nott is reading a large book, Longbottom is dozing against a tree, and Lovegood is resting on the grass, staring up at the trees and sky. "Is this the first time you've seen Nott in almost two years?"<p>Daphne is expressionless. "No," she admits. "I saw him six months ago."</p><p>"Did he come to London? Japan?"</p><p>"Neither. I came to him."</p><p>"So, you know where he is."</p><p>"Thanks to Luna. She accidentally found him."</p><p>Tracey snorts. "That I can believe." She smiles slyly. "So…"</p><p>Daphne looks at Tracey with an unamused expression.</p><p>"Did anything happen?" Tracey presses, excited.</p><p>Daphne swallows and looks away, a faint blush on her cheeks. </p><p>Tracey squeals and Daphne reaches over to grab Tracey's arm. "Stop it," Daphne hisses. "Yes, fine. But obviously, no one can know."</p><p>"Wow, I just – <i>finally</i>. But I'm also shocked because it's <i>Nott</i>. I figured he wasn't capable of normal emotions." Tracey suddenly realizes something. "Wait, if something happened, then why are you still acting like you're nothing more than acquaintances? Is it me?"</p><p>Daphne smiles sadly. "Tracey. I grew up in a home where my parents did not engage in any public displays of affection beyond holding hands, and even that happened rarely. Theodore had seen nothing positive from his parents. It's just not in either of our natures."</p><p>"But that's nonsense – we're not dictated by our parents – shouldn't Nott know that better than anyone?"</p><p>"We're just not comfortable with it. It doesn't mean that we don't…" Daphne trails off, either not knowing the words to say, or knowing exactly which words to say but not feeling able to say them.</p><p>Tracey's heart aches. "I just want you to be happy," she tells her with all the honesty she can muster.</p><p>Daphne inhales and exhales slowly. "I am. The weather is beautiful, the cherry blossoms are vibrant, and I'm with people I've sorely missed by being on this side of the world," Daphne says with a serene smile.</p><p>Tracey sighs and takes her writing materials out of her bag again. "After the war, you've remained in Japan, primarily."</p><p>"My parents wanted my sister and me to be safe. I only remained because I grew to appreciate it."</p><p>"What are the biggest differences between England and Japan?"</p><p>"Beyond the fact that they start learning at age seven versus eleven?" Daphne shakes her head. "It's extremely competitive. There are a lot more educational opportunities once you're seventeen. There is a strive towards excellence and perfection…"</p><p>"Sounds perfect for you," Tracey says.</p><p>Daphne smiles. "I'm not fully Japanese, so it can make things difficult, but…I feel like I fit more."</p><p>"Is that why you go by your…grandparents' name? Your mother's maiden name?"</p><p>"I'm sure other families would be grateful to shed their last names that are associated with the war," Daphne answers with a dark expression. </p><p>"What do you want people to consider about you – about us Slytherins – post-war? Unfortunately, our House has been intertwined with Death Eaters and You-Know-Who, and now that he's finally defeated for good…what's left? What's next?" Tracey asks, but really, she wants to know for herself – what is next? <i>How do we move on</i>?</p><p>"Theodore," Daphne calls out. Nott's head lifts at once. "I think you need to answer this question too."</p><p>Nott shuts his book and hands it over to Lovegood, who takes it and begins reading where he left off. He walks over to them with his hands in his pockets and <i>huh</i>, okay, he's…rather cool. Or at least now, he appears <i>way</i> more attractive than Malfoy, who gets invited to parties and meetings because <i>he saved Potter and his friends during their quest</i>, never mind the fact that he could never fully commit to either side and that time, it worked in his favor.</p><p>"What's the question?" Nott asks.</p><p>"How do we want people to view our House now – what's left now that the Dark Lord is gone for good," Daphne answers.</p><p>Nott exhales and shrugs. "What's left is what the House has always valued: cunning, resourcefulness, ambition. They're all seen in a negative light, but what's so wrong about being motivated, of wanting to achieve something? And people also tend to forget we're loyal too – Gryffindors and Hufflepuffs don't have the monopoly on that character trait."</p><p>"You also disregard the rules," Lovegood shouts.</p><p>"How the hell did she hear –" Tracey starts.</p><p>"We wouldn't be here if we all didn't," Theodore interrupts her, the corner of his mouth quirked in amusement.</p><p>Lovegood grins and lowers her head to continue reading.</p><p>Tracey shakes her head and turns to Daphne. "So, what do you think?"</p><p>"Mahoutokoro doesn't have Houses. Sometimes I think Hogwarts does a disservice by immediately splitting students and encouraging competition based on the colors they wear. It seems so trivial," Daphne answers.</p><p>"So how does Quidditch work over there?" Tracey asks.</p><p>"Because obviously that's the biggest concern," Nott says dryly.</p><p>"Sorry, must be prepared for when I inevitably get letters about it."</p><p>Daphne smiles. "It's based on a lottery system, the teams that do the poorest get first pick on most talented players."</p><p>"Hm," Tracey hums.</p><p>"But I think we should be just viewed as people. Kids, really. We're not children anymore, of course, but we were. And there are still children in Hogwarts wearing green and silver. Please be kind," Daphne says with sad eyes.</p><p>They haven't brought it up – how two Slytherin girls killed themselves during Easter Recess, leaving letters behind detailing how they felt targeted at Hogwarts, how hated they felt.</p><p>Tracey throat closes as she nods. Sometimes she's just so tired and wants to pretend she was homeschooled, just to avoid the inevitable look of judgment when she mentions she was in Slytherin.</p><p>But no one cares about that when you have peers whose parents were killed, who lost siblings, who lost friends. <i>Poetic justice</i>, some would say.</p><p>Tracey figures an eye for an eye will only make everyone blind with rage.</p><p>"So…what now?" Tracey asks out loud.</p><p>Daphne and Nott look at each other. "Move forward," Nott answers to Tracey's surprise.</p><p>"Do better," Daphne adds. "The war changed everyone."</p><p>It did. Some for the better, Tracey thinks when she considers Longbottom looking her in the eye and speaking with conviction, or Nott, who doesn't seem as guarded as he did in school (although that's not to say he's an open book – she has <i>no idea</i> how Daphne puts up with him, even though Daphne isn't one for sharing much either, there's still a marked difference between them).</p><p>But Tracey can't get Lovegood's eyes out of her head when they talk about Malfoy, what Death Eaters did to her and her father. And even though Daphne seems to have embraced the part of herself that she didn't acknowledge much in school, there's still a weight on her shoulders that she acquired.</p><p>Tracey puts her notebook away. "How much time do we have?"</p><p>Daphne looks at her watch. "About an hour."</p><p>"Well, I'm going to take a nap under that tree. Wake me up when it's time to leave."</p><p>Daphne smiles. "Sure."</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>**</p>
</center>Tracey does doze for a bit, although she wakes up at one point and spots Daphne and Nott speaking quietly a few meters away – Tracey isn't able to figure out what language they're speaking. Nott reaches out and plucks a cherry blossom from Daphne's hair. Even though Tracey is too far away to see clearly, she likes to think he's smiling just a little. She shuts her eyes again, not wanting to ruin the moment.<center>
  <p>**</p>
</center>Daphne gathers everyone and leads them back to the tea house. Tracey takes more pictures because she wants to remember this. Lovegood at one point puts a hand on her camera and lowers it.<p>"Just be here," Lovegood says before spinning away. </p><p>Longbottom walks ahead of Tracey and shrugs. Tracey shakes her head and lets her camera hang around her neck the rest of the walk.</p><p>The elderly couple is waiting for them. The man says something in Japanese to Daphne and he and his wife bow deeply. Daphne looks almost flustered as she shakes her head and insists something in Japanese, but the couple sound insistent. Nott’s brow is furrowed in concentration during the exchange, but at one point, his eyes widen, and then there’s an expression that’s so unfamiliar to Tracey that she can’t figure it out until the couple explains in English that Daphne had been instrumental in saving their great-granddaughter’s eyesight after an unfortunate accident.</p><p>Nott was impressed.</p><p>Daphne is almost properly blushing as she says something to the couple in Japanese, bowing. "Let me take you to Kyoto," she says to them, but her eyes linger on Nott. She doesn't ask what Tracey wants to know too – <i>are you staying? Are you leaving?</i></p><p>They walk to the gate and Daphne grabs Lovegood first then Longbottom. There are a few moments when it's just Tracey and Nott.</p><p>"You better make her happy," she threatens.</p><p>Nott raises an eyebrow.</p><p>"Don't look at me like that. I know you don't think much of me, or anyone for that matter, but I've cared about Daphne long before you have. I know she'd give everything for her family and I know you must have reservations about that because I do too. You have to remind her that she deserves her own happiness too, that she can't sacrifice everything for her family. It doesn't do anyone any good."</p><p>"You're wrong."</p><p>Tracey snorts. "Of course I'm wrong. Everyone is always wrong."</p><p>"I don't have reservations about Daphne's loyalty and love for her family," Theodore continues as if he didn't hear her mumbling. "Why else would I learn a language that has vastly different grammatical structures and three different types of characters? Or drink tea that isn't English Breakfast?"</p><p>It's so strange (and wonderful), how much he respects her. Also, did he just make a <i>joke</i>?</p><p>Tracey shakes her head to clear her mind. "All I'm saying is, and I know you obviously didn't care for when Lovegood said this, but she had a point. Daphne will give and give until there's nothing left. I don't know what happened after the Battle, but I worry about her." Tracey shrugs. "That's all I'll say."</p><p>Nott stares at her with an intensity that makes Tracey want to look away, but she forces herself to meet his gaze. </p><p>"I'll keep that in mind," Nott says, face blank.</p><p>Tracey does her best to keep a straight face. "You do that."</p><p>Daphne comes back and she smiles at the both of them. "So, whom am I taking next?"</p><p>"Tracey. I need to head back," Nott says.</p><p>Tracey blinks in surprise at the use of her first name.</p><p>"<i><span title="Really?">Honto</span></i>?" Daphne asks.</p><p>"<i><span title="Yes. But we will see each other soon.">Hai. Sugu ni o ai shimashou</span></i>."</p><p>"<i><span title="June is okay?">Roku-gatsu daijōbu?</span></i>"</p><p>"<i><span title="Yes, that is fine. The sun does not set – did you know?">Hai, daijōbu. Taiyō wa settei sa rete imasen - anata wa shitte imashita ka?</span></i>"</p><p>"<i><span title="Amazing.">Subarashī</span></i>."</p><p>"<i><span title="I am sorry. We did not have time together.">Gomen'nasai. Wareware wa issho ni jikan ga nakatta.</span></i>"</p><p>"<i><span title="We will have time soon enough. Goodbye, Theodore.">Watashitachi wa sugu ni jikan ga arimasu. Ja ne, </span></i>Theodore."</p><p>"<i><span title="My beloved.">Watashi no aisuru.</span></i>"</p><p>Daphne turns <i>pink</i>. Tracey has never wished she knew Japanese until this moment. "<i><span title="Where did you learn that phrase?">Anata was ono furēzu o dokode manabimashita ka</span></i>?"</p><p>"<i><span title="From a book.">Hon kara.</span></i>" And Nott actually <i>smiles</i>.</p><p><i></i>Tracey delicately clears her throat. "Maybe you can take me to Kyoto and you can have a few minutes alone?"</p><p>Daphne grins in amusement reaching out for Tracey's arm. Before they Disapparate, she catches Nott – Theodore – looking at Daphne with such fondness that Tracey loses her breath.</p><p>When she lands on her feet in the back of the tea shop, it takes her a few seconds to orient herself.</p><p>"I'll only be a few minutes," Daphne promises.</p><p>"Okay, you have to tell me what he said to you," Tracey demands.</p><p>Daphne leans close, even though Tracey can barely hear the bustling crowd beyond this room. "My beloved," she says.</p><p>"Oh."</p><p>"I'll be back." Daphne squeezes her arm once, lets go, and Disapparates.</p><p>Tracey thinks about how to write her article in the meantime. She leaves the room and finds Lovegood conversing with the shop owner, pointing to jars on the back shelves. Her Japanese is slow and clunky and she mixes English words, but the owner clearly appreciates her efforts.</p><p>Eventually, Daphne returns and Tracey doesn't know why she expected her to look anything other than put together, but she's still disappointed all the same.</p><p>"One day I better catch you having snogged him," Tracey mutters, recalling plenty of times in school when Daphne caught her.</p><p>Daphne laughs and says nothing. "Shall we eat? You must be hungry having missed lunch."</p><p>It's almost sad that Theodore isn't with them anymore, but Tracey gets to spend a little more time with Lovegood and Longbottom, who eventually insist on her calling them by their first names. </p><p>"When do you expect the article to be up?" Longbottom – Neville – asks as he struggles with chopsticks. Daphne flags down a server and asks for something in Japanese. The server glances at Neville and nods, leaving them.</p><p>"Depends on how fast I write it and other factors. But I can keep you informed," Tracey says.</p><p>The server comes back and hands Neville a pair of chopsticks that are bound together. He smiles at her gratefully and thanks her in Japanese.</p><p>"I'm bloody awful," Neville says with a shake of his head, but at least he's able to pick up food.</p><p>"It just takes practice," Daphne says. "I don't think I can even use a fork anymore," she considers out loud.</p><p>Luna looks at Daphne with sharp eyes, then picks up her cup of sake and sips it.</p><p>They're only a little bit tipsy when Daphne takes Tracey to the inn she's supposed to be staying at. Tracey hugs Daphne goodbye.</p><p>"We'll grab lunch tomorrow. My grandparents will be in the city too, so you can meet them," Daphne says.</p><p>"I'd love to," Tracey says, insatiably curious about the people in Daphne's family who have pulled her away from England.</p><p>After saying goodbye to all of them, she orders a pot of tea to be brought to her room and she begins writing her article.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>**</p>
</center><i>It's difficult to describe Theodore Nott – those who have went to school with him know what I mean: he isolated himself so well it was almost as if he didn't belong to any House. He was brilliant, always one of the first to master a spell, but he was never egotistical; he clearly preferred to be left alone to his own devices.</i><p>
  <i>It's obvious that some things remained unchanged. He spoke eloquently and his face rarely gave way to emotions; he was very careful on how he presented himself.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>While he would not disclose where he currently lives, he did hint toward a return to England: "I have something in the works."</i>
</p><p>
  <i>Irritatingly vague, but consider that a warning, Ministry. </i>
</p><p><i></i>Tracey sighs and sits back in her chair. She wishes she could say that he has a heart, that he's careful about whom he shares it with, but she wants to protect that part of him for Daphne's sake.</p><p>She checks the clock hanging about her bed and is surprised to see it's almost one in the morning. She puts down her quill and resigns herself to continue in the morning.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>**</p>
</center>Tracey has lunch with Daphne and her grandparents in the afternoon. They're as intimidating as she imagined they would be, but Daphne's grandfather at least faked an interest in her career in journalism.<p>It's obvious that Daphne's grandmother is a matriarch in every sense of the word.</p><p>At one point towards the end of the meal, Daphne's grandmother speaks in Japanese. Daphne looks to Tracey apologetically before responding in turn. Daphne's grandmother nods and turns to her husband to speak with him in Japanese.</p><p>"My grandparents have an engagement they need to get to, so they'll be leaving," Daphne explains.</p><p>"Oh, erm, <i>haji…mema..shite</i>?" Tracey ventures, wincing a little, but Daphne nods encouragingly.</p><p>Her grandmother smiles for the first time. "<i>Hajimemashite.</i> It's nice to meet my granddaughter's school friends. I hope you enjoy Kyoto."</p><p>"<i>Hajimemashite. Shitsurei shimasu</i>," Daphne's grandfather says when they both stand up and leave.</p><p>"What did that mean?" Tracey asks once they're out of earshot.</p><p>"Essentially, it means 'excuse me' in the context that they're leaving first," Daphne explains, slouching a little.</p><p>"They're…nice," Tracey says.</p><p>Daphne smiles. "You looked terrified. I don't blame you – they're…imposing."</p><p>"Well, it was nice to meet them, or at least put faces to names."</p><p>"So…do you want some dessert? Outside of this restaurant. It's very stuffy in here."</p><p>Tracey smiles and lets herself be led out by Daphne.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>**</p>
</center>(Tracey <i>tries</i> to ask Daphne about Theodore – "it's only fair since I bombarded you with too much information about Ben," Tracey insists – but she doesn't get much.<p>"Daphne, come on, you have to give me <i>something</i>. Have you <i>done it</i>, at least? Remember – I went into details about how <i>awful</i> my first time was."</p><p>Daphne shakes her head and looks intently at the menu of the sweet shop they're in. "Fine," she says, putting the menu down. "Yes, we have. And if you must know, it was…" she trails off.</p><p>"You're <i>killing </i>me, Daphne Greengrass," Tracey sighs. "I'm going to assume it was terrible."</p><p>"It wasn't terrible. It was…surprising. Nice. I don't know – how do you describe something like that? It was…" she sighs again, frustrated. "There's a phrase in Japanese that doesn't really have an English equivalent, it's from Zen Buddhism: <i>ichi-go ichi-e</i>, which means 'one time, one meeting,' but the heart of it is, treasure every encounter you have, because it'll never happen again. So, that's what it was. A one of a kind moment that I keep with me."</p><p>Tracey tries to smile, but she's having a hard time. "Wow," she says, hating how hearty her voice sounds.</p><p>Daphne smiles – half apologetic, half sheepish. "There's another phrase: <i>kyouka suigetsu</i>, which means flower in the mirror; moon on water. Something that's there but can't be touched. Or, in my case, a feeling that I can't put into words."</p><p>Tracey is a writer – can find the words to describe everything, so she hates how she immediately identifies what she's feeling: jealousy. But there's happiness too – she's happy that Daphne has love.</p><p>"And, well, let's just say he has lovely hands," Daphne adds casually, which causes Tracey to burst out laughing.)</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>**</p>
</center>Before Daphne leaves Tracey at the inn, she hands Tracey a bit of parchment with a set of numbers.<p>"I have what Muggles call a <i>telephone</i>. It's much more efficient than owls, I think. Please call," Daphne explains. </p><p>Tracey knows what a telephone is, but she's never used one before. She takes it and nods. "I will."</p><p>Daphne smiles and hugs Tracey. "Thank you."</p><p>"<i><span title="No, no.">Ieie</span></i>."</p><p>Daphne laughs and lets go. "You're learning!"</p><p>Tracey is trying, but she doesn't say that. Her heart pangs, watching her friend go, not knowing when she'll see her again, but Tracey hopes it's soon.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>**</p>
</center>By the time she comes back to London the next day, her article is almost finished, mostly thanks to working through most of the night, unable to sleep. She's proud of it; she's sure she's captured the varying dimensions of these four people with different motivations coming together.<p>She's scheduled to meet with her boss the following day, so she takes the time to sleep and drink a <i>lot</i> of tea because surprisingly, she and Theodore Nott have one thing in common beyond their caring about Daphne and that's the undisputable superiority of English Breakfast tea.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>**</p>
</center>Fraser reads the article with a blank face. Tracey does her best not to fidget, keeping her hands behind her back as she waits.<p>"You were right," he finally says after a long time.</p><p>Tracey forces herself to wait a moment before responding. "About what?"</p><p>"Only you could've written this. You're checking your own biases just as the reader is. We feel what you feel."</p><p>Tracey wants to laugh and say <i>I told you so</i>, but she holds herself in check.</p><p>"I'm surprised you didn't reference the rumors around Nott's parents, though."</p><p>"What do you mean?"</p><p>"I mean, why would Nott so vehemently hate his father? You know as well as I do there were rumors about what happened with his mother."</p><p>Of course. It was always there, hinted at for years, but no one dared to say anything. And Tracey knows that besides Neville and Potter, the only other person who saw Thestrals in that one class was –</p><p>"I only want to print what I see and the truth. That's pure speculation. Unless Nott wants to say something about it, I'm not about to bring back a horrific rumor for drama's sake."</p><p>Fraser holds up his hands in defeat, but it's more condescending than anything else.</p><p>But Tracey does believe it, that Theodore's father killed his mother. And if she thinks about it further, there's probably a darker reason as to why Theodore has stayed away from England, even with the deaths of the Dark Lord and his father.</p><p>But Tracey isn't thinking about that because it's not confirmed and she will only print facts. Readers can go to <i>Witch Weekly</i> if they want to gossip and speculate – </p><p>She gasps suddenly, remembering what Theodore had said: <i>I hated my father for over ten years. People can speculate as to why.</i></p><p>People can speculate.</p><p>Did he…give her permission?</p><p>"Davis?" Fraser questions.</p><p>Tracey swallows. "He…confirmed it. I think."</p><p>He pauses for a moment, then sits up straight in his chair. </p><p>"He said…he hated his father for over ten years and 'people can speculate as to why.' I think he was…validating the rumors," Tracey explains slowly.</p><p>His eyes spark with triumph. "This is <i>so much more</i> than I expected."</p><p>Tracey wets her bottom lip and looks out the window at the bustling city. </p><p>"I'll add some comments and you'll add the death of his mum in here." He snorts. "Wow, it's just <i>truly</i> remarkable, how deep the incompetency ran for how long. Nott Senior <i>murdered</i> his <i>wife</i> –"</p><p>"And Theodore saw it," Tracey says, crossing her arms. She clenches her hands into fists. She wants to be far away from her boss and his utter <i>glee</i> on this awful revelation.</p><p>She can't look at him, but she can only imagine how hungry his expression is. "How do you figure?" he asks.</p><p>"He was one of the few people in a Care of Magical Creatures class who was able to see Thestrals in our fifth year." Tracey feels lightheaded. "And it would explain why he loathed his father so much."</p><p>She watches a mother struggle to walk with her children across the street. They're young and dragging their feet.</p><p>"Why does he want to come back, then? To the country that allowed his mother's murderer to go unpunished?"</p><p>Tracey scowls. "Did you not learn anything about Theodore Nott from my article?" she retorts, unable to hold her tongue. "This all started because he didn't want to be limited. Right now, he can't return to England. He wants to be able to do what he likes without people pestering him."</p><p>Fraser snorts. "Right. Well, come back to me tomorrow with the changes implemented. And get a quote on that class."</p><p>She takes her article and leaves without saying another word.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>**</p>
</center><i>I knew, after the initial shock wore off that Theodore Nott was in front of me for the first time in almost two years, that Nott wasn't going to be forthcoming with information that he deemed personal – he was, and still is, an extremely private person.</i><p>
  <i>But after delaying, he gave his answer as to why he didn't want to be a Death Eater: "I hated my father for over ten years. People can speculate as to why. I knew from a young age that I would never follow in his footsteps."</i>
</p><p>
  <i>Some of you, dear readers, may know what he was referring to, but for those who don't, I will explain: there were rumours over ten years ago regarding the unusual circumstances of his mother, Nora Fawley's death in 1988, the darkest of which was that Theodore Nott, Sr. had murdered her after it became clear that she was not to bear any more children.</i>
</p><p>Tracey swallows over the lump in her throat and puts her quill down. She wants to confirm with Nott, just to make sure, that it's truly alright.</p><p>Figuring that speaking with Daphne is almost as good as, she scrounges through her notebook to find the number that she gave her prior to parting ways. She does a quick mental calculation and figures it's late enough in the morning in Kyoto to not wake anyone.</p><p>"<i><span title="Hello?">Moshi moshi</span></i>."</p><p>"Daphne?" Tracey ventures.</p><p>"<i>Oh, Tracey, hi, how's the article coming?</i>"</p><p>Tracey smiles. Straight to the point. "I wanted to…make sure what I'm writing is alright."</p><p>"<i>You're a great writer – you shouldn't second guess yourself now that you're friendly with its subjects.</i>"</p><p>"No, I want to make sure the <i>content</i> is alright to publish."</p><p>"<i>Okay…like what?</i>" Daphne asks warily.</p><p>Tracey swallows, thinking of how to word it carefully. Who knows who is listening, although the wizarding world hasn't caught up with Muggle technology. "Like…old rumors. Confirming them. Bringing up that one class that would Longbottom was in."</p><p>"<i>Tracey,</i>" Daphne sighs. "<i>Why do you think I was so insistent on him speaking about it? I sympathize with his desire for privacy, but he's going to need to, for lack of a better word, use what happened to get back home. It looks</i> horrible<i> for the Ministry – the least they can do is let him back into the country.</i>"</p><p>Letting a murderer live freely with his eight-year-old child, who witnessed the crime? It looks beyond horrible – it's downright unforgivable.</p><p>"Okay, I just…wanted to make sure," Tracey says, feeling a little stupid.</p><p>"<i>It's sweet. I appreciate it. And I'm sure he will too. I'm looking forward to reading it – are you almost done?</i>"</p><p>"Yeah, should be done by the end of the week. We'll see about getting it in next week."</p><p>"<i>It'll be great.</i>"</p><p>"I hope so. I'm just…tired, you know?"</p><p>"<i>I know.</i>"</p><p>They sit in silence on the phone for a little while.</p><p>"<i>I have to go, I'm afraid, but we'll speak soon. I'm working on potentially living on my own, but that'll require some more convincing. You can stay with me.</i>"</p><p>"Sounds great. Bye, Daphne."</p><p>"<i>Bye.</i>"</p><p>Tracey hangs up and picks up her quill and takes out another piece of parchment to write a quick letter to Neville, who thankfully returned to London and will be going back to Japan in a week, requesting a meeting first thing in the morning.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>**</p>
</center>"I need a quote from you about that Care of Magical Creatures class in fifth year," Tracey says, immediately pulling out her writing materials before getting a chance to sit down in Rosa Lee Teabag.<p>"Wait – what class – oh, you mean – the –"</p><p>"Yes, that one," Tracey says. "I'm going to make the Ministry of Magic look like maggots."</p><p>"You know, they're trying to rebuild," Neville points out with a frown. "How is this productive?"</p><p>"In order to rebuild, they need to acknowledge <i>everything</i> they did. And now, they're going to have to face the fact that they did <i>nothing</i> to help an eight-year-old boy and they neglected a woman's wrongful death," she insists.</p><p>Neville looks unsure for a moment and Tracey wonders if maybe she should've held back, but she wants to be honest, she <i>needs</i> to be honest about her intentions because transparency is important now more than ever.</p><p>"Myself, Harry, and Theodore were the only people in that class who claimed to have been able to see Thestrals. Theodore didn't share whose death he had seen, but…"</p><p>Tracey copies his words quickly. Once she catches up, she looks up at him. She catches the moment when he steels himself.</p><p>"But the way he spoke about his father reminded me of how I spoke – still speak about Bellatrix Lestrange," Neville continues. "You hate the people who destroy the ones you love."</p><p>Tracey impulsively hugs him before they say goodbye. "Thank you," she says.</p><p>He's flustered when she pulls back. "You're welcome," he says, bewildered.</p><p>She reaches into her bag and takes out an envelope. “Since you’re going back to Japan, do you think you could give this to Daphne? I developed a few copies of the pictures in the paper and some others.”</p><p>Neville takes it and fiddles with it between his hands. “I don’t suppose  –”</p><p>Tracey reaches into her bag again, pulling out two more envelopes. “For you and Luna.”</p><p>Neville smiles brightly and Tracey returns it.</p>
