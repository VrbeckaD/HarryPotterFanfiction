  <strong>Fandom: Star Wars, Reylo</strong>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The stars unfold around them in lines of white that remind him of the glitterstim traded in the dark and smoky haunts of the Hutt cartel. Being here, lost with her small hands making constellations of the small moles and old scars on his shoulder blades and chest, feels like one of those hallucinogenic trips. Intense in a dreamy sort of way. Delicious. Heat soaked and confusing as his fingers weave mirror images of her movements, caressing her pert nipples, her clavicles, the thin, tunnel shape between her breasts. She is starlight and madness.</p>
<p>The bond between them flares and spits, a fiery blaze of humanoid sparklers in a deep velvet sky. His mouth finds hers even as she smiles, plump lips melting against her small giggle.</p>
<p>“Why do you laugh?” He asks, already knowing.</p>
<p>“You’re maudlin,” she says, her quick fingers pushing against the heat of his naked chest. “Can’t you just enjoy it... enjoy us?”</p>
<p>His erection presses against her stomach. “Who says I’m not enjoying myself?”</p>
<p>She nips the wide shell of his left ear through his hair and his mouth stretches into a grin so boyish and delightful and such a contrast to the hard heat of his cock that she cannot keep her thoughts from automatically passing to him through the bond. She squeaks as she finds herself pinned to the bed, his huge frame weighing against her small one in a flash of movement masked and so fast that even she did not sense it coming.</p>
<p>“Oh, really?” His deep voice, pitched to that tone that has undone since her first told her what she already knew so long ago, that he can take, and take and take, <em>whatever he wants</em>, does dark things to her and to the wetness between her legs. His hand moves to his cock, fisting between them, drawing the velvet slant of it against her core in one agonizing brush. “I think I can make sure you enjoy it, Rey. Do you doubt me?"</p>
<p>His other hand reaches for her throat and she bucks against him, pleading through the bond, spoken words unnecessary. </p>
<p>
  <em>Never. Please. Now. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Give it to me. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Give it.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Give it to me. </em>
