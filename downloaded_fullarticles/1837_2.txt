    <p>The click of Walburga Blacks sandalium on the mosaic floor wasn't loud enough to cover up the moans and guttural voices that echoed the halls.</p><p>As she neared the thin piece of dark fabric that separated her sons atrocities, she considered handling her family affairs in a different way, a bloodier way. But the ability to produce another heir was impossible thanks to this son as well, the last male heir of the most ancient house of Black. His only duty now is to continue the line of succession.</p><p>She stood in the doorway, waiting for her son to acknowledge her presence as he sodomized a servant boy she didn't recognize. The poor blonde haired heathen was the one to notice her cold unmoved face as she watched them. Frightened for his life he pulled away and reached for his loincloth. He attempted to run past Walburga but was frozen in place when she raised her hand. All the blood rushed to his head and he realized he no longer had control of his own body.</p><p>"You will never mention this, if you value your life." Lifeless eyes peered into his soul and his eyes were the only thing he could manage to move. Knowing she did not threaten him in jest, he blinked hoping she would take that as confirmation.</p><p>"Mother, why must you bother us? We weren't hurting anyone, we were actually enjoying it quite a bit. Isn't that right Herc?" Sirius, still lounging in his bed, looked to his mother.</p><p>Her hand fell, the young servant boy turned crimson before taking control of his own body once more and ran.</p><p>"You're hurting the family with these urges of yours." His mothers words cut through him, but Sirius didn't give her the satisfaction. "If Regulus-"</p><p>"Don't speak his name..." He couldn't keep the pain from his eyes now, so he looked away from her and out the window.</p><p>"You do not give me orders, filth. If Regulus was alive to honor our family, you would already have been disowned. You have yourself to thank for the life you live." Disgust coated her voice.</p><p>"It's your fault he's dead. You and your hate." No matter what he said, his mother knew that he would always feel this guilt. The man who was meant to carry on the family name, the older brother Sirius looked up to. Regulus, he was dead and it was his fault.</p><p>"You're the one who turned your back on this family. You're the one who didn't protect him."</p><p>"Did you come just to torment me mother?" Sirius didn't want to listen to her venomous words anymore. Sirius reached out to grab the book that materialized from thin air.</p><p>"Just to give you news of your pending engagement to Bellatrix" Walburga just wanted this conversation to end already, to be away from this demon spawn.</p><p>" I will never take part in a union with that insane woman, I would rather marry that servant boy." He'd rather never be married, to even bring a child into this world would be cruel.</p><p>She gritted her teeth in annoyance, the continued interruptions were not to be tolerated.</p><p>"We are not Greece, you Cinaedus. We are respectable, we are the-" Her pure anger rising, she was losing all patience.</p><p>"Ancient and most NOBLE house of Black, yes I know. I will not-" Rolling his eyes and fingers running through his hair.</p><p>"It is your duty, and you will. Your father and I have spoken, we will be announcing your engagement to Bellatrix during this weeks banquet. Your father has even allowed you a concubine of your choosing." She was visibly disgusted by the very thought, but if this were the only way to recover an heir that she could raise correctly...</p><p>"Thats in a few days, I-" Sirius saw his only life falling apart, any control gone, what could he do?</p><p>"Listen to me boy- this is your only option. You may have your one toy, choose wisely. That is the end of it." She turns to leave the room snapping her fingers to replace the curtain and she exits.</p><p>Â </p><p>-------------------------</p>
