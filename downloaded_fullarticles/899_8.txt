  <b> <em>1979</em> </b>
</p><p>With a pensive breath and hands that shook like leaves, Thomas Marvolo Riddle set to pacing about his little hideaway for the umpteenth time this evening. The only thing that seemed to help with keeping his wits and courage about him was the looping knowledge that where others were mere men, <em> he </em> was more. </p><p>An aspiring Dark Lord.</p><p>Winner of Witch Weekly’s Most Eligible Bachelor award for three years running.</p><p>Professor of Defense Against the Dark Arts at the prestigious and world renowned institution known as Hogwarts.</p><p>And certainly last, but not least, he was the holder of Peter Pettigrew’s enormous life debt.</p><p>None of those things on their own were enough to make him anything <em> more </em> than a man, but he was sure down to his very bones that he was destined for greatness; he was <em> more, </em> he was <em> better, </em> he was a walking God. Well, a walking God that was slowly losing his mind from anxiety and the cold, but a God nonetheless.</p><p>But Godhood or not, his current assemblage of plans were lying dashed about his feet with no recourse other than to soldier on with half as much time and twice as much experience. The plans and rituals he’d drawn up during his school-days were fifteen years behind him now, the dreams of ruling their little world and squashing the unrepentant and unworthy beneath his feet gone cold and dark since he’d received his graduation papers. In his mind the goals he’d set were more than adequate to set him atop their social ladder; the first stepping stones in a grander design that would have seen him King above all others. He was to have created an army of impossible to defeat Inferi, gather underneath his banner all the Dark Witches and Wizards of the world, and storm their broken Ministry before wiping the slate clean with a wave of guided chaos and destruction. </p><p>Oh, and kill his old Headmaster Albus Dumbledore while he was at it.</p><p>But while those dreams had all once seemed so clear and easy, real life had a way of intervening and scattering it all to the wind. Instead of sitting atop a pile of bleached bones he was standing in a forest, instead of subjugating those beneath him to his will he was grading papers on the weekends, instead of building an army the size and strength of which hadn’t been seen since Grindelwald’s time he was helping Albus <em> Fucking </em> Dumbledore design a new Dueling Range. Merlin’s Bloody Beard, when had it all gone so wrong?! Half the time he wasn’t sure he was in his right universe it was all so <em> mad. </em></p><p>And the worst part? It was all his own bloody fault. </p><p>Where he’d been expecting the old Goat to ignore and deny his request for the D.A.D.A position, he had instead accepted it immediately along with offering him the prestigious position as Head of House Slytherin; something he’d craved since old Slughorn had retired. Who could say no to that offer? Certainly he couldn’t do anything other than grit his teeth and accept; to back out of it would have made him look a fool or even worse, it could have tipped off the old man to his ultimate plans.</p><p>No, he’d accepted it right then and there, thrown off his ideals and dreams in favor of ensuring he wasn’t turned against, and for all that trouble he now found himself in a shitty forest in Albania, on a shitty outcropping of rocks beneath a cliff and a forest, with Peter Pettigrew somewhere at his side and dragons circling up above him.</p><p>As he stood there for the next hour of waiting his mind turned back towards thoughts of his youth and the first thoughts that had sparked his ambitions into proper infernos. A perusal of his ancestry hadn’t been done until his fourth year; all the ones before then he’d simply been aware of the creatures flying above him and the envy digging through his heart. It was an oft hushed rumor that the beasts were nigh immortal unless harmed by an outside force, talked about in barely heard whispers that they could coalesce themselves into a human form to intercede on Wizardkind’s affairs, that their blood could cure sickness and ailments like Fae magic of old.</p><p>He’d ended up envying them so much that it had given him recurrent heartburn that lasted well into his thirties and plagued him much the same today. But once he’d found out his family heritage? Where they drew their lines from and the storied histories of their past? Oh how badly his envy had turned towards <em> want, </em> towards <em> need. </em> His families true name was a legacy left in the past and here he was with nothing to show for it.</p><p>Ancient texts that he’d come across in the depths of the Chamber of Secrets had given all the indications and information he’d needed to determine that Salazar Slytherin was himself a dragon; an odd one for sure but a dragon nonetheless. The ancient man had used his skills and wiles of dragon-hood to build Hogwarts up from the ground, to pass off to humans and wizards alike knowledge that to this day fueled their deepest and strongest magics. Riddle <em> knew </em> that his life should have been leading him towards bigger and better things, he and his whole ancestry <em> should </em> have held numerous draconic traits or been dragons themselves outright. Instead it had all worn off; the prized blood they had been gifted diluted and bred away after Salazar and his immediate family died off. Each following line, eventually coalescing in only the Gaunts, had thrown themselves further into debauchery with incestuous relations that broke down their genes and eventually left them with only one trait of their forefather, the ability to speak with snakes. Not that it was a help at all, snakes themselves were lowly cousins to dragons and though they could hold a conversation when necessary, they were far more fitting as spies and lowly servants instead of comrades and co-conspirators.</p><p>Still he had persevered, for surely <em> he </em> of all people could turn their legacy around. Years and years of study had led him down a darkened path filled with danger and intrigue that nearly killed him at least once a year; all to find out <em> one </em> secret. It hadn’t been easy, but then again nothing worth it ever was, and though it only required one ingredient it had taken him many years to determine exactly <em> what </em> that one ingredient was.</p><p>A dragon egg; one from a five hundred year old dragon, the seventh in a clutch, and struck through by moonlight, whatever the Hells that meant. Pettigrew knew though, his only real reason for being here besides his status as easy bait should the beasts attack, and the Monks who’d lived high up on the tip of the world had divulged the spell he needed once he had his prize. Get the egg from between a nest, perform the ritual in absolute secrecy, and then sit back to relax and revel in his newfound status as a Man made Drake; a God among Mortals.</p><p>After that was accomplished the task of solving death by outside force could be overcome; soul magics dark and foul would come in handily there. Unfortunately that particular portion of his plan would only commence once he’d claimed his birthright, if he messed this up there was no option for a redo, no backup waiting to take over. As it was there was no absolute guarantee that making a true Horcrux would even work, nor was there anything to suggest that he would come out the process anything like he had gone in. Herpo the Mad wasn’t known by that name just for his proclivity to eat Horned Fish, or that time in his midlife crisis where he’d hunted all Periwinkle Frogs in the world into extinction. No, Herpo had disappeared into nothingness and never been seen again after he completed his ritual to develop a Horcrux, a mad dash of smoke and a few maniacal cackles had been the last anyone had ever seen or heard of him. Suffice to say that he had absolutely no intention of letting himself fall from grace in the manner of that ancient Dark Wizard.</p><p>Again he paced and rubbed his too chilled shoulders, eyes out of focus and mind cratering around the object of his desires. Soon enough Pettigrew, also known as Wormtail to those who knew his nocturnal proclivities, would let him know he’d grabbed the egg, sending up a-</p><p>
  <em> There!  </em>
</p><p>Atop the land above him Riddle saw a showering of white luminescent stars and sparks begin to top the treeline, Pettigrew’s predetermined signal to announce that he’d grabbed the egg. <em> ‘Finally,’ </em> he thought to himself with a smile stretched eerily across his face, <em> ‘My works can be completed, nothing and no one will be able stand in my- </em></p><p><em> ‘Oh no,’ </em> his face blanched white and slick, jaw hung open as the showering sparks of white suddenly deepened into the bright crescendo of red. The sparks remained where they’d first shot up for a few seconds more, straight up and unwavering, but soon enough the whole group began speeding towards him above the treeline. Closer and closer the sparks advanced, suddenly shooting straight at his little hiding spot with a speed and rapidity that shouldn’t have been possible for a single person to travel at, magic or no magic.</p><p>His last words, a rather tactless “Fuck,” were snatched up and eaten away between the mad Apparition of Peter’s gloriously flaming return and a gush of burning chemicals sprayed out of the mouth of a monumentally pissed off Albanian Woodhide, and the strange sort of half-magic pumping out from the egg held tightly between Peter’s melting fingers.</p><p>One minute he stood there as a man-</p><p>---</p><p>-and in the next he was nothing more than a loose and wayward pile of ashes, blowing along with the breeze that rushed in off the rooftops guarding the thin side street in a village known as Hartnet. Sitting atop the largest remaining portion of the ashes was an enormous egg nearly the size of a rugby ball, the whole of it rocking gently side to side as the creature buried within it realized there was no Mother to warm the stones, no Father to guard the cave’s entrance. It was alone, somewhere cold and dark and dreary, thoroughly suffused with the scent and feel of <em> Man. </em> From deep within a wave of magic began to pulse and throb, radiating outwards from the center of the egg as it rocked, learning its surroundings and freezing at the frightening lack of Dragons.</p><p>For only one second more the egg was still an egg; mottled brown with flecks of gold and green spattered across its surface in patterns that whirled as they caught the light, and then it was-</p><p>---</p><p>“Didy’a hear that John?” Emma Granger removed herself from John’s grip, pulling herself backwards until she could just barely see around the edge of the alleyway that they had secluded themselves within. </p><p>John rolled his eyes as his wife pulled away, “No,” hands reaching out to pull Emma back into his embrace and mind focusing on everything else except whatever noise she thought she heard. He knew what <em> he </em> wanted to hear and it certainly wasn’t anything about strange noises in idyllic little hamlet’s off the beaten path. John Granger was three weeks tied and only five weeks into officially earning the right to be called a doctor, off on tour throughout as much of Scotland and England as his shoestring budget and University debt would allow. He was ready to explore, examine, relax and unwind; all the while on a mission to earn as much neck as he could before they settled into domesticity.</p><p>The woman now standing not one meter away was Emma Granger nee’ Bulston; a beautiful young woman that he’d met out at a stag night over three years prior, his PhD still a twinkle in his eye. He watched her shiver from a cold draft and the liquor swimming up beneath her bloodstream, short hair waved away from her ear and eyes as she poked her head out into the preternatural silence and darkness that seemed to blanket the town. The longer they stood in quietude the more she seemed to be perturbed by whatever she had heard, her body pulling steadily further away until she was standing directly on the sidewalk, John venturing out slowly behind her to lay a warm hand upon her shoulder.</p><p>When it became obvious she wasn’t going to give up on whatever it was that she had heard he stepped up around her and tilted his head into the wind in an effort to hear whatever his wife was on about. When the sound came, and it did, quietly and almost missed, it warbled upon the wind along with the rushing sound of air. “Come on Em’, it’s gotta be some kid making a ruckus. T’isn’t anythin’ more-”</p><p>“Goddammit John, it’s not just some kid!” She punched him in the shoulder and sent a withering look, “Why in the world would a fuckin’ child be cryin’ out here? At night?” She pointed off down the road, “I don’ see anyone else around here, what if they’re hurt? Come on, let’s go.”</p><p>With nothing to be done about it, as John knew exactly where going against his new wife’s wishes would lead, he followed out behind her along the sidewalk in search of whatever was making the noise.</p><p>It wasn’t a matter of even a hundred meters before they found what was making those noises, around a small bend in the road and between the two sides of the crowded street was a small and wailing infant. The baby was lying directly on the hard stonework of the ground with nothing else surrounding it, bronze skin pale and gray where ashes and soot covered it.</p><p>“What the fuck,” they both uttered in unison, their faces open in confusion as the child below them began crying anew.</p><p>---</p><p>
  <b> <em>1980</em> </b>
</p><p>John Granger, PhD, Dentist, loving husband, and brand-new father, was at his wits end.</p><p>He loved the darling little child that he’d come to call his own girl, loved her so much that there wasn’t any conceivable thing in the entire world that he wouldn’t do to make sure she was as happy and healthy as a toddler could be, but there was something immensely <em> off </em> about his little bundle of joy. Not that he minded that, no, he loved her all the same, but still. It needed to be said.</p><p>The little girl that he doted on so much was never claimed after that night he and his new wife had found her, darkness all around them and ashes on the ground. The wailing child at their feet had calmed down immediately once Emma had her safely wrapped up into a bundle made from her scarf and jacket, tucked into her arms and softly cooing as she waved a finger that the child continued trying to grab. They’d ended up spending an extra month in that shitty little village; used up every cent of their funds that had been supposed to go towards the remainder of their trip up north and settled on finding a rather cheap little hotel room to ride out their stay. Soon enough after delivering her to the local medical center it became clear that the girl would eventually end up somewhere as a Ward of the Court, shipped out to a mill-run orphanage and given only a paltry chance at a stable home or life. Emma, being the kind and gracious soul that she was, just couldn’t stand to leave the girl behind, not in good conscience at least. That sentiment became one that he echoed as they spent hours and then days with her passing between the two of them, the nurses and doctors happy to get the abandoned tyke off their hands.</p><p>And so eventually, after much paperwork and little in the way of fanfare or celebration, they found themselves the right and proper parents to this lost little infant girl. Sure they had ended up with a child far sooner than they had imagined, and yes they didn’t have all that much in the bank after purchasing both a home and a secondhand practice, but their business ended up securing their livelihood and allowing them to take the child home. One Saturday they’d just been man and wife, alone besides themselves, and then by the time they arrived home they were parents, through and through.</p><p>They spent an agonizingly long period of time thinking up names for their new child before eventually settling upon Hermione; named as such after the daughter of Helen and a beauty in her own right, a child born from greatness and destined to it as well. Her skin was a beautifully deep bronze that wreaked havoc on the eyes the longer one stared, the color shifting from the warmth of metal to the softness of wood in an instant. Her hair was slowly growing in and promised to eventually be a beautiful sight, brilliantly burnt auburn that sparkled and rippled as light cascaded off it. Her eyes were an oddity; golden like honey beneath the sun, dappled and flecked throughout with specks of green that shimmered and glowed beneath twilight.</p><p>She was a wonder to deal with no matter day or night, beautiful and quiet as she joyfully played or grabbed at hair and hands, shimmying along on her stomach in the way young children do until they learn to crawl and pull themselves along. Soon enough they’d needed to keep an eye out underfoot at every step they took, careful and considerate so as to not cause her any harm.</p><p>There were, however, downsides to this whole parenting business. Not that they hadn’t expected some; Emma had practically cleaned out the local library on every text regarding child rearing and came home one day all in a tither over <em> teething </em> of all things, but they had practiced and prepared and for all that they were still overwhelmed in the end. Removing sharp objects? Everything was put away in cubbies or cupboards that Hermione couldn’t reach. Stopping her from falling down stairs or getting her head stuck between the bars of the railing? They bought netting and strung it up along with childproof barriers at every landing. It was all normal really, what they’d been led to expect and deal with were all easily managed problems that required no more effort than if Hermione had been a particularly rambunctious cat.</p><p>But there were… irregularities.</p><p>Well, less like what one would consider an irregularity and more like what someone would call a trope from some schlocky horror novel, all the odds and ends wrapping themselves up in cloth that made them doubt their sanity one day before proclaiming everything fine and dandy the next. Chief among these sudden outbursts of strangeness was the… <em> transformation, </em> that Hermione would sometimes undergo. It was a predictable affair, or at least it was once they’d noticed the pattern, their little child swaddled and cuddled up in Emma’s embrace with a little smile on her pudgy face and infant voice cooing and laughing in all the ways that young children could vocalize. The next moment, however, she was, well. </p><p>The easy way to say it was just to say it and move on; <em> she had wings. And a tail. And a forked tongue. And claws! </em> <b> <em>And sharp teeth!</em> </b></p><p>When the first transformation happened Emma had nearly thrown Hermione across the room in fright and shock, her scream sending the child back into her normal body in the span of a millisecond and pulled John running from the garage until he was breathlessly panting in the living room. </p><p>
  <em> “I swear,” Emma had said, her eyes wide and Hermione bouncing happily in her arms while she reached for short black hair, “John ya know I’m not lyin’ to ya, ya know I wouldn’ lie about something like this-” </em>
</p><p>And then it had happened again.</p><p>John promptly fainted; he was never one for shocks and his poor heart simply couldn’t keep up with the sudden demand for imagination, leaving Emma to remain the strong one in the interim of his consciousness. With a sigh and a pout she set the creature that her daughter had turned into down upon the couch to inspect each oddity in turn, every single one odder than the last.</p><p>Teeth? All there, thirty two of them, each needle sharp and hooked like a puppy or a kitten.</p><p>Forked tongue? It was right there, twisting around and longer than would be considered normal for an adult, pink but darker along the edges, much closer to purple. A split ran down the center, each moving independently of the other, the whole length pushing in and out of her mouth like a snake tasting at the air.</p><p>Claws? Sharp and pointed at the tip, a deep black color instead of the clear they normally were, growing and poking out from the midpoint of her fingers like any other nail except that they were shaped like a common beast. They scratched and caught on fabric, tangling and leaving red marks upon Emma’s skin, the little child seemingly knowing her own strength and refraining from truly digging in.</p><p>Wings? … Yes? They were little things, two flaps like miniature arms poking out from her back near the center of her shoulder blades, each nascent and mostly immobile except for random flutters that stretched the webbing between each long finger like… <em> thing, </em> before closing up again.</p><p>Tail? Again, nascent and short but present nonetheless. The length of it was scaled in dapples of brown and green that shifted between the two colors depending on the light. The appendage waggled backwards and forwards, up and down, at a pace and frequency that seemed far more tied to Hermione’s emotions rather than any planned movement on her part.</p><p>Eventually John stirred, helped along by her nudging foot, rising from his impromptu sleep to poke and prod at Hermione with as much care and gentleness as he’d always had for their child. He watched her face as he ran a finger down her wings and tail, watching her face intently for any sign of distress or unease, his chest heaving a sigh of relief when there was nothing amiss. Hermione was happy, healthy, and far more importantly didn’t seem at all put off by suddenly looking half human and half reptile. Of course their next topic after his inspection was regarding whether they should inform someone, anyone, and even then who would it be? A pediatrician?</p><p>No.</p><p>“We can’t tell anyone Emma,” he’d pleaded after thinking through all their options, “No one else can know about this. We have no idea what they’d want to do to her, whether they’d take her away or what have you. <em> No one can know.” </em></p><p>Emma agreed wholeheartedly with his view on that, worried as she was for her daughter’s safety and more than a little bit concerned that if they went public with it she would disappear from her grasp with no way of ever getting her back. With that decision settled they waved off the occurrences as something to be feared and began to slowly fall into a blissful domesticity, odd though it was. Hermione continued to change as the days passed into months, and then on into years, the pace of them seeming to fluctuate the older that she grew, but other than that she seemed as healthy and normal as any other child, her oddness confined to the home and never once shown off while they were out and about, or in the company of strangers.</p><p>The next odd thing to plague their little family was just a bit harder for either of them to cover up, especially with all the broken bits of metal and wood that Hermione would leave laying about. Or rather, spitting out. They weren’t quite sure which term was proper, were the pieces really just laying about if Hermione was forcefully throwing them away after ripping them to shreds with her teeth?</p><p>Before they’d even brought Hermione into their home they had bought her a crib, something homey and made from white painted wood, lead free of course, and though it was a mite bit large for her they had been sure she would grow into it soon enough. With that in mind they had budgeted themselves for another crib in a year or two, and then promptly went about their day. Four weeks after Emma had first set eyes on Hermione’s rather odd reptilian form, they found said crib a broken mass of chewed up wood and splinters, scattered across the floor while Hermione pulled bits and pieces from her mouth. She’d even been making giggling noises of happiness while doing so, a counterpoint to the immediate faint that John had slipped into.</p><p>“How,” Emma had asked, helping John up off the floor.</p><p>“Don’t know,” John had replied, shifting forward to pick Hermione up off the pile of debris as he helped her to remove the last pieces of splinters from her sharpened teeth.</p><p>---</p><p>“It’s… It’s not wrong of us to keep a child in a cage, right?” John looked down at little Hermione as she sat in her new ‘crib’, a converted metal cage that would have been better off employed in housing animals in a zoo.</p><p>“I mean…,” Emma had stared, first at Hermione asleep on her covers and then at her husband as he nervously rocked back and forth.</p><p>“Yeah…”</p><p>“... Yeah.”</p>
