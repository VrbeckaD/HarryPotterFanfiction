    <em>“Where are we going, Severus?”</em>
  </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">
    <em>You tried to pull away but he had the sleeve of your Slytherin robes in a grip. You passed he corridors, the windows tinted with a faint mist. It was raining outside, and you wondered why you let him drag you through the rain into the Boathouse. </em>
  </span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <em>“Severus?” You asked as he stopped and turned. His Slytherin tie glistening despite the moisture.</em>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">
    <em>“(f/n),” He ran his hands over your shoulders. You stepped back. </em>
  </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">
    <em>“I’m not a replacement for Evans, Severus.”</em>
  </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">
    <em>.</em>
  </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">

  </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">
    <em>.</em>
  </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">You sat up in your bed with a gasp. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">How embarrassing. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Just as you thought your… <em>feelings</em> for Severus had faded, you go about having a dream of him. </span>
</p>
<p class="p2">The man has not sent you a letter all summer, despite his promise to write. Perhaps he would have something interesting to write about when term starts in a few weeks…</p>
<p class="p2">You pinched your nose as you caught yourself <em>hoping. </em>Hoping for what exactly? It’s not like you would want to… or if he would…</p>
<p class="p2">You shook your head.</p>
<p class="p2">Perhaps an early start to the day would ease your mind.</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">You were still coming to terms with having…<em> feelings</em> for Severus. Accepting it did not make it any less confusing and annoying.</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Confusing, because you kept asking yourself <em>why</em>. Why Severus? Bitter, snarky, sarcastic, Severus. Perhaps two of those qualities made him a bit… endearing. You groaned to yourself as you clocked in your badge in the hospital. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Annoying, because at times random things reminded you of him. Last week, a parrot was admitted to artefact accidents and was apparently the snarkiest bird you’ve ever seen. That, coupled with the shape of its beak, oddly reminded you of Severus. </span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p class="p1">“Come in, Gilderoy,” You said without even looking up. Though you were placed in charge of Artefact Accidents, Gilderoy frequented your office since he was given permission to wander. You didn’t blame him, you were the only thing closest to a friend to him.</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">(You wonder why his once <em>allegedly </em>proud family has not come to visit him yet.)</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Your promotion did not mean much at all. Well, you could finally get rid of the lime green uniform, but that’s about the only advantage you could think of. Much to your chagrin, the head healer placed you in an office, which removed you from first-hand experience in handling patients. You knew the reason you were given the position was not because of Madam Pomfrey’s commendations (which praised your practical performance), but due to the old healer-in-charge retiring. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Now you were stuck doing boring paperwork— well, actually more to <em>un</em>doing paperwork, the old healer-in-charge had some serious organisation issues, which would be fine if it didn’t involve vital patient information and possibly deadly cursed artefacts. </span>
</p>
<p class="p2">Sometimes the trainee healers would call you when there’s a special emergency, but nothing much ever really happens in the Artefact Accidents department. You actually found yourself looking forward to Gilderoy’s visits amidst the tedious paperwork. </p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“You look really tired, (f/n),” Gilderoy sat on the chair across your desk, “is it the new job?”</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Yes… between you and me, it’s a bit boring,” You threw the stack of papers you finished across the table. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Oh, then would you like to hear a story?” He fetched something out of his pocket, “Miriam gave me this book the other day.” He held up a book with an Augurey on its cover. From the looks of it, you could tell it was a children’s book. </span>
</p>
<p class="p2">Gilderoy’s reading has improved greatly since he was admitted to the Janus Thickey ward. Miriam Strout, a healer in the ward, was particularly fond of Gilderoy and lately turned to giving him children’s books from the children section on the first floor to help him read.</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Doesn’t this bird look like that Severus fellow?” Gilderoy pointed at the picture, “His nose really looks like this,” he traced the outline of the Augurey’s beak. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">You had to chuckle at how innocently Gilderoy delivered the sentence. Perhaps that’s why the parrot from the other day reminded you of Severus. </span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p class="p1">
  <em>"What happened, Severus?" You pulled up the sleeve of his Slytherin robes and inspected his broken wrist.</em>
</p>
<p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">
    <em>"Your cousin hexed me until I fell from a height.” </em>
  </span>
</p>
<p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">
    <em>"He'll be removed from the family soon enough," You turned his hand and he hissed in pain, "hold still."</em>
  </span>
</p>
<p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">
    <em>You held his hand as you mended his wrist. </em>
  </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">You rubbed your eyes and stretched in your bed.</p>
<p class="p1">
  <em>
    <span class="s1">Another dream. </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The feeling in your gut twisted as you closed your eyes and remembered his face. You’ve been dreaming of your days in Hogwarts… of things that never really happened. </span>
</p>
<p class="p2">(Things that perhaps you wanted to have happened…)</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">You flipped over and buried your face in the pillows. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Maybe… <em>you </em>should write to him first.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">What would you even say? If you spoke of your promotion, it would most likely come off as you flaunting your wealth.</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">But you can’t just sit and wallow in… dreams. You knew you sounded really pathetic. However just <em>willing </em>the gut feeling out of existence never worked— if it did, well, you wouldn’t currently be laying in your bed with frustration. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">A soft tapping sounded by your bedroom window and you pulled your head from the pillows to see an owl. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">You sat up and breathed in to steady yourself. You shouldn’t hope… it’s not Severus, it’s not…</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The envelope had the Hogwarts crest and you tore it open, finding a very vague letter from Headmaster Albus Dumbledore inviting you to work at Hogwarts for the coming year. </span>
</p>
<p class="p2">Vague as it is, you supposed that your excuse to return has presented itself.</p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">
    <em>You’ll see Severus again. </em>
  </span>
</p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The thought alone was enough to quench the feeling in your stomach. </span>
