    <p>“Well done Draco,” Voldemort said, his snake-like voice cutting through the quiet air. “Not only have you managed to lead us to Potter’s friends, you’ve managed to catch Potter himself. Again I say well done.”</p>
<p>Draco bowed his head gratefully and said his thanks. He looked out of the corner of his eye to see his father. He was smiling and nodding at him. It was the first time he’s smiled since Draco's mother… Well it’s the first time in a long time he’s smiled.</p>
<p>“Now before we kill,” Voldemort said. “What would you like as a… reward Draco?”</p>
<p>Draco thought for a moment before pointing towards Potter. Everyone seemed either angry or confused. There was no in between. Except with Voldemort. He just widened his blood red eyes and tilted his head a little.</p>
<p>Draco's father on the other had had a stoney glare directed right towards him. 

So much for the smile, Draco thought.</p>
<p>“What?” Voldemort said with a hint of anger in his voice.</p>
<p>“Think of it my lord,” Draco said quickly. “Potter’s punishment could be serving his us. His enemies. It a fate worse than death. To be reminded everyday that he failed.”</p>
<p>“And his friends?” Voldemort asked, thinking of his proposal.</p>
<p>“They could be forced to serve too my lord,” Draco said bowing his head back down.</p>
<p>“Hmmm…” Voldemort hummed. “I do like your plan Draco. Eternal suffering for Potter and his friends until they perish. Yes it does intrigue me. Very well Draco we will go through with your plan.”</p>
<p>Draco smiled and bowed his thanks upon him. He waved his hand and Greyback let go of Potter. Potter’s face was immaculate, Draco thought. Realization hit him and his friends and you could see despair fall into their eyes like with a dementor.</p>
<p>“Greyback take them all to the dungeons. That’s where they’ll be staying,” Greyback nodded at Voldemort’s orders. “Draco go to your room. The adults and I need to have a conversation of this arrangement.</p>
<p>Draco tried not to scowl at that and asked, “Um… My lord if it’s not too much to ask can I borrow Potter now?”</p>
<p>Everyone raised an eyebrow to this but Voldemort just waved his hand and said, “Very well if you want. Just leave the room now.”</p>
<p>Draco bowed again and grabbed Potter by the arm, pulling him out of the room.</p>
<p>Once they got to Draco's room Harry jerked out of his hold and asked, “What’s the meaning of this Draco? What are you doing?”</p>
<p>Draco ignored his questions and told him to bend over his chester drawer.</p>
<p>Harry narrowed his eyes and asked why.</p>
<p>Draco told him he dropped something back there and his first task was to retrieve it.</p>
<p>He didn’t seem to trust him but seeing as he didn’t have his wand anymore, Voldemort took it, he did as he ordered. Like a good little servant, Draco thought.</p>
<p>Once he bent over the chester drawer Draco cast a spell on Potter, a body frozen bind. He could blink, talk, and look around but that was about it. He couldn’t escape Draco.</p>
<p>“Dr-Draco wh-what are you doing?” Harry stuttered like Professor Quirrell.</p>
<p>“Oh Potter,” Draco whispered. “You don’t know how much I want you.”</p>
<p>“What?” Potter asked.</p>
<p>Instead of saying more Draco yanked Harry's pants down along with his underwear. Harry gasped and Draco could tell he was struggling against the spell but to no avail. He was trapped.</p>
<p>Draco cast a lubrication spell on his fingers and ran his index finger back and forth over his hole. Draco could see Harry's eyes widen in shock but he kept going.</p>
<p>Draco pushed past the tight rim of muscle and into his hot and tight virgin hole. It was icrediably warm and tight so Draco knew this had to be his first time in a situation like this. He was so tight there was no way he could of had sex before.</p>
<p>“Oh Merlin Potter you feel good,” Draco moaned.</p>
<p>Potter gasped in pain as Draco started to twist and turn his finger inside of him and as Draco added a second digit to his hole he groaned in response.</p>
<p>“Do you like this Potter?” Draco asked in a husky whisper. “Tell me you like it.”</p>
<p>Potter groaned and told him to get off.</p>
<p>“Can’t do that Potter,” Draco smiled as he added a third finger to Harry's overwhelming hot hole.</p>
<p>Draco groped himself through his pants and could feel himself grow harder as Potter groaned, it went straight to his dick and Draco leaned his head back to moan.</p>
<p>Draco tore his pants down and pulled his fingers out of Potter’s hole and heard him sigh in relief. Draco smirked, thinking to himself of how full Potter would feel in a minute.</p>
<p>Draco lined himself up and slowly pushed inside Harry. Potter groaned and gritted his teeth while every inch of Draco's cock slowly went into his hole.</p>
<p>Draco was finally completely inside and marveled at how hot and tight Potter was and how hot his hole looked as it encased his dick.</p>
<p>Draco started to pull out and thrusted back in. Potter groaned and shut his eyes. Draco assumed he was trying to imagine himself elsewhere instead of being fucked by his cock.</p>
<p>Draco gripped his hips firmly as he thrusted in and out. It was a sight to behold; Potter bent over his chester drawer, eyes closed, mouth slightly open,groan after groan escaping his lips while Draco penetrated his virgin arse. </p>
<p>Draco could feel himself growing closer and he started to pick up the pace, making Potter slightly bounce back onto his cock.</p>
<p>He leaned his head back and moaned as he came deep within Potter’s hole. He pulled out and watched as his cum leaked out.</p>
<p>Draco left the room after reversing the frozen body spell but even after he did Harry still wouldn’t move.</p>
