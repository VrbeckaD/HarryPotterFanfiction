    <p>Although Suzuki missed Japan, he enjoyed being at Hogwarts. His housemates were cheerful and friendly, the classes were interesting, and one of the best things of all?</p><p> </p><p>No fangirls. Or at least, not many.</p><p> </p><p>He could walk down the streets of Hogsmeade without fear of being mobbed down by fans, and he didn’t have to worry about being stalked by the paparazzi all the time. Here in Wizarding England, he was just another face in the crowd. And he was loving it.</p><p> </p><p>Something else he was loving? Celestina Warbeck. Or her music, anyway. He had overheard one of her songs being played on the radio in the Hufflepuff Common Room, and instantly fallen in love with the sound of it. After learning who the singer was, Suzuki had immediately gone looking for more of her songs. His current favorite was <em> You Stole My Cauldron But You Can’t Have My Heart </em>, which he had taken to humming under his breath a lot.</p><p> </p><p>Needless to say, he idolized the woman. And he wasn’t afraid to let others know it.</p><p> </p><p>----------</p><p> </p><p>Ai sighed to himself, glancing briefly at the annoyance to his side. Suzuki was <em> still </em> going on about that British singer he had discovered a few weeks ago. Huffing, he turned his eyes back to the sprig of mistletoe across the hall that he was manipulating with his wand.</p><p> </p><p>“She’s <em> so great </em>, Ai-kun! Warbeck-san actually attended Hogwarts years ago, and even then she was incredibly talented! Can you believe that someone like her went to the same school we are?”</p><p> </p><p>Nodding absently, Ai flicked his wand, moving the mistletoe towards the heads of a certain pair of arguing fifth years.</p><p> </p><p>“Not only that, but she’s incredibly kind, too, having lent her name and talent to good causes, like raising funds for St Mungo’s Hospital in London!”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s nice,” Ai murmured, having finally gotten the mistletoe into position. Now, how to get the two to notice it…</p><p> </p><p>“<em> I know! </em> I’d just love to meet her someday, maybe even perform a duet together with her! It would be amazing! Don’t you ag-- is that Malfoy-san and Potter-san? Are… are they <em> kissing?! </em>”</p><p> </p><p>With a smug grin, Ai lowered his wand. “It’s about time.” <em> Cupid strikes again. </em></p><p> </p><p>(Meanwhile, at the staff table, a certain toadlike Professor was choking on her food, absolutely appalled by this turn of events. Nobody really cared what Umbridge thought, though.)</p>
