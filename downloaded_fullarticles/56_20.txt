Harry might have found Ginny attractive in school but after the war,he wasn't ready for a relationship. </p><p>Due to his best friends and Mrs Weasley just didn't understand. Harry finally gave up and gave in to their demands.He and Ginny were dating again.</p><p>It didn't take long for Ginny to demand he marry her,Harry kept avoiding the topic.He wasn't ready for marriage.He was only nineteen years old.</p><p>Ginny threw a hissy fit and ignored him.Harry kept getting hints from Ron and Hermione,telling him that he needed to start a family and as the last Potter and Sirius's heir ,he should have a son at least.</p><p>Harry only needed one son,he already decided on naming Teddy as the Black heir.Teddy was a Black by blood and Harry wanted the best for the boy.</p><p>He thanked his lucky stars that the boy hadn't lost his mother during the final battle.Harry wasn't ready to take on the responsibility of raising the baby.It would have been too much.</p><p>He was sad that Remus died and Harry promised Tonks that he wouldn't be a stranger in the boy's life.He reinstated Tonks and her mother Andromeda back into the Black family. </p><p>The three of them kept it a secret,he didn't want them to be targeted or place Teddy in danger by having it known that he was Harry's heir. Due to Ron and Hermione being busy with their wedding plans ,it never seemed like the right time to tell them.</p><p> </p><p>Harry was coming from work.He wanted to relax at home after a tiring day. He walked in his apartment and heared moaning sounds coming from his bedroom.He hoped that it wasn't Hermione and Ron again. He had burnt the sheets the last time they had sex on his bed.</p><p>When he walked in he was shocked at what he saw .Ginny was fucking Dean on their bed and he felt a bit of anger,hurt and sadness.He realised that he wasn't heartbroken,he was free...</p><p>Harry left after pinning a note on the inside of the door ,telling Ginny that it was over and she was free to fuck Dean whenever she wanted.</p><p>The rent was paid three months ahead,he had no reason to stay there.He didn't care for the few items of clothing he left behind as most of his things were at Grimmuland Place.He never brought anything of value in Ginny's apartment,much to her frustration. He was glad about that.A few robes and sleeping clothes could easily be replaced.</p><p> </p><p>It didn't take long for word to spread that the man who conquered was single again. Rita somehow saw Ginny and Dean that day and was quick to put it in the newspaper. </p><p>Hermoine and Ron kept trying to get him to forgive her.Mrs Weasley tried to get him to return to the Barrow but he firmly refused. When it was clear that no amount of apologising or reasoning would make him take her back,Ginny claimed that she was having his baby.</p><p>Ron told him to marry her ,so that she wasn't disgraced with a bastard.</p><p>Harry knew that it couldn't be possible,he hadn't had sex with her in two months and the last time they had sex Harry used a contraceptive charm.</p><p>Harry demanded a paternity test. Ginny refused and Ron tried heading him.In the end Harry hired a lawyer and forced her to take the damned text. The baby was not his but surprisingly Dean ordered a test as well.The baby did not to Dean either. </p><p>Harry and the Weasleys as well as Hermione 's friendship was over. Dean broke up with Ginny after the test results.</p>
