    <p>Theseus had been pacing around the house for the last day, and Newt was beginning to get a headache. He didn't quite understand why his brother was so worried - it wasn't like he was the one being forced to marry an older man that they didn't know. Theseus was getting all of the advantages, with none of the problems - if this went well, it would raise the Scamander family's status, rid them of an unwanted omega son, and clear the way for their Alpha boy to join the Ministry. Theseus should have been delighted about it.</p><p>His brother seemed to notice him staring, and had the decency to look a little ashamed.<br/> "Sorry," he mumbled. "I'm waiting for Perce to get here."<br/> Newt nodded, closing his eyes.<br/> "It won't work These. Even if we try, having sway in America won't help you now."<br/> "I don't..." Theseus began, then shook his head, taking a couple of slow breaths before he turned and looked Newt in the eye. "I don't want to buy my position like this Newt."</p><p>Newt nodded, able to tell when his brother was being honest with him at least. He reached out to hold Theseus's hand.<br/> "You'll write to me won't you?" he asked. "And you'll visit?"<br/> Theseus nodded, pulling Newt into an embrace, and Newt clung to him, shaking in his arms, trying not to be afraid.</p><p>He knew he was being foolish. He was hardly the first omega to be married off to a stranger, and many of the matches worked well enough. He was old enough - he'd had his first heat a year before, and now that he was expelled his education was no longer an excuse to postpone it. This had to happen. He was terrified.</p><p>Theseus held him closely, and Newt could feel his heartbeat.<br/> "I promise you, I'll come and visit," he told Newt, and there was a strength to his voice that Newt found reassuring.<br/> "Even when you become an auror?"<br/> "Even more then," Theseus teased, ruffling Newt's hair. "I've got to go and check on how he's treating you."</p><p>Newt managed to smile at his brother, then paused as he heard the fire roaring to life. He stayed in the background as an Alpha his brother's age stepped from the flames. Theseus strode over to shake his hand.<br/> "Percival!" He embraced him. "It's good of you to come here,"</p><p>Graves answered by smiling.<br/> "This your brother?"<br/> "This is Newt," Theseus agreed, guiding Graves over. Newt didn't want to shake hands - it was only a day before the wedding, and it would be bad luck to touch an Alpha. He gazed at the floor, trying to sneak a glimpse of Percival out of the corner of his eye.</p><p>The first thing he noticed, the thing that took his breath away, was that Percival's eyes were kind.</p><p>***</p><p>
  <em>Stepping forwards into the aisle, Theseus beside him, Newt felt trapped. He wanted to run, but the gazes of those around him held him steady. He nearly stumbled, but managed to keep his balance.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The man facing him had pale hair and a thin face. He stared at Newt, hunger visible. Newt wanted to run away, feeling exposed before this man. He had to do this, for Theseus's sake if not his own. He bowed his head so he didn't have to look the man in the eye.</em>
</p><p>***</p><p>Newt gazed at the floor of the kitchen in irritation. He'd been working to clean it since Percival had gone to work that morning, but there were still magical stains that would not go away. <em>You need to make the house tidy. That's your only job. Keep it tidy and look pretty and...</em> Newt shook his head. That wasn't now. That wasn't Percival. He could feel himself collapsing in on himself, curling up by the sink, his knees as close to his chest as they could get with his swollen stomach in the way. He rested his hand on the bump, trying to reassure his child. They were safe now. No harm would come to them this time.</p><p>Percival was excited about the baby, and had told Newt to rest. Newt realised that meant he had been disobedient, and that thought made him panic, his throat closing up. He barely realised that there was movement before the door opened, and Percival hurried in, wrapping his arms around Newt and guiding him to look into his face.<br/> "Newt, Newt, look at me, there we go, there we go...." He praised softly. Newt managed to meet his eyes.<br/> "Are you hurt?" Percival pressed, and Newt managed to shake his head, even though even that felt like disobedience. A wave of relief passed across Percival's face, and he pulled Newt close to him.<br/> "You're safe now."</p><p>Newt felt his body relax, lulled as it always was by Percival's words. He could see now why Theseus had trusted him. He was remarkable. Percival guided him into a chair, fussing around him, making sure he was comfortable and his legs were raised.<br/> "What happened?"<br/> Newt ducked his head, shame filling him.<br/> "I couldn't clean the stain by the sink."<br/> "Newt..." Percival began, then shook his head. "You need to rest darling, and I promise you, it doesn't matter. That isn't your fault."<br/> "It was my venom-"<br/> "It doesn't matter," Percival said, his voice sympathetic and patient but firm. Newt fell silent. Arguing was wrong.</p><p>Percival held him close, leaving only to fetch him some tea, and Newt tried to focus on his life now, chasing away the strands of darkness which threatened to unravel all he had built.</p>
