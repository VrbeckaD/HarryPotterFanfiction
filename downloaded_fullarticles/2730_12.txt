    <p>
  <span>Lily threw her book down on the library table. “You’re hiding something.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Remus flicked his eyes up from his own textbook to the flaming and sometimes quite terrifying redhead sat opposite him. She was squinting rather hard, and Remus vaguely wondered if she had been reading up on legilimency. He returned his gaze to his book.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Moony…” Now she was gazing at him like someone might look under a car for an oil leak. The use of his Marauder’s nickname was a rather recent addition to her vocabulary now that she and James were on speaking terms again. They had made up after the </span>
  <em>
    <span>green eggs and stag</span>
  </em>
  <span> incident. It made Remus shudder. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Moony.” He kept his eyes fixated on his textbook in an effort to avoid her gaze. Somehow this red headed devil woman could read him like a book. She had known that he was hiding something with his health, she had figured out independently about his… </span>
  <em>
    <span>furry little problem</span>
  </em>
  <span>, and now she was about to dig up yet another embarrassing thing that really he would rather nobody knew about. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What book are you reading?” Remus looked up, almost too hopeful that she was just curious about his textbook choice and had dropped the secret subject. The only problem was that he seemed to have forgotten what book it was.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Uuuuhhhh..” he quickly scanned for clues in the text. Truth be told, he hadn’t really taken in a word of it the last half an hour they’d been sitting there. He did not want to make it obscenely obvious that this was the case though. Especially not in front of this witch-extraordinaire-cum-detective. “Book- spell book. Wizard. Book.” He mumbled intelligently.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“It’s potions,” she deadpanned. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“That’s still a wizard book,” he tried meekly.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You’ve been a wizard for six years, Remus, You’re the best bloody student in our year. Shut up ‘wizard book’.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Remus looked surreptitiously around the library. There weren’t too many students this time of year so they had no chance of being disturbed. That also meant no one to save Remus. He knew exactly what had been distracting him, and he was determined that he would be the only one to know what that was. But LIly was about to pry it out of him. She always did. He sighed, “I have no idea what I was reading.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yesss,” she grinned over her little victory. “I mean, you have been staring at the same spot since you opened the book. Actually, you haven't even turned a page.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Just drop it, okay?” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Moony, Remus. Has your life ever been worse for me knowing about things you don’t want anyone knowing about?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“This is serious.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“More serious than lycanthropy?” She mouthed the last part. Remus pinched his lips together. It was possible that she had a point about that. “You always think that other people think that stuff is worse than it is. Perceived threat.” She squinted at him again. “Remus. What does Remus never talk about?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She grinned.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Stop it.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Who is it?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He grimaced and stood up to go. Lily quickly lunged forward and grabbed his book, dragging it to her side of hte table, gripping it to her chest.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Give that back.”</span>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>“Tell me who it is.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“No.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She cocked an eyebrow. “Alright then.” He made to leave. Even managed to sling his bag over his shoulder. But he couldn’t finish his essay without that book. He huffed that she called his bluff. “Give it back.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>But she was squinting at him again. He covered his eyes with his hands, certain that she was somehow reading his mind.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Someone that is embarrassing…”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Oh no. She hasn’t dropped it.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“So, hmm.” She tapped her lip. “Someone you wouldn’t tell your </span>
  <em>
    <span>Marauders</span>
  </em>
  <span> about.” She said it with a smirk. “Wait, have you told them?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He opened his mouth, then shut it again quickly. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Stupid, traitor mouth.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“No. You haven’t. So, is it that girl that Peter’s been kissing behind the tapestry on the third floor? Oh, don’t look so surprised, of course I know about that.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Sensing that his doom was impending, Remus decided to be a man and face his fate head on. He sat down. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“So you’re not denying that you are crushing hard on someone?” She had put her head in her hand coquettishly, and it was bloody annoying how smug she looked.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I guess not.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Marlene.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He closed his eyes. “No.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Mary McDonald?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He rolled his eyes at her.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“No, they’re too obvious. Is it-” she hesitated, “Emma Vanity?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What? No!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Well, she is really good at quidditch. She might carry Slytherin to victory this year, and that would seriously piss James and Sirius off so-” She shrugged. “I can’t really think of a girl worse than her-” Her eyes went wide. “Is it Narcissa?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Remus actually snorted at that. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yeah, we'll have to cover all the bases. Umm… Please tell me this isn’t some stupid charade where I wind round and round all the girls in Hogwarts and it turns out to be me?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Lily, don’t be thick.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Good. Because I’d slap you.” She tossed her mane over her shoulder, looking rather like she was preparing for battle. “Right. Clearly I need a change of tact. This is not working.” She cricked her neck, then leaned in. “Is it- a. Gry-irl?” The last word barely slid out of her mouth. It sounded like she had been about to say Gryffindor, then changed direction completely.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Nothing could have stopped the burning, prickling sensation creeping under Remus’ neck. Lily’s hand slid over her mouth. She cupped it so that no one could see her mouth “Are you gay?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Give my book back.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“It’s chill!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She handed it back to him, gently. He had stood up so quickly, cheeks a rather fierce shade of pink, that Lily hadn’t had the heart to keep teasing him. He pushed it back into his bag and made to go again, but stopped when Lily placed her hand over his. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Moony, it’s okay. I don’t care. I mean, I do obviously, but not about that. Wait, did that make sense?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He squeezed her hand. “Thanks.” He mouthed it. They stayed there for a minute. Eventually, Remus sat down, a sheen of water over his eyes. “Do you know how hard it is to be a werewolf?” He whispered. Lily didn’t think it was a question that was supposed to be answered, she already knew that she had no idea how bloody difficult it was for Remus. “And I just had to win the lottery twice and be a gay werewolf.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Nobody who matters will care about that.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He closed his eyes, the ghost of a smile playing on his lips. “Thanks Lils.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She smiled and grabbed his hand again. “See? You always feel better when I know your secrets.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I am not sure that that is the reaffirming message either of us should be getting from this.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You worry too much.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I have a lot to lose.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She squeezed his hand again. “You won’t lose me, though. So. Who is it?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Drop it.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Unless you want to just tell me?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He sighed. “I am still getting over the shock of  you not disowning me forever. And the shock of just telling someone. And maybe even admitting it to myself. Out loud. Big day. I think that is enough for part one.” He brushed his eyes with his sweater sleeve. “Sorry.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“No, no, I get it. How about we actually do some work, hey?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>With a wet laugh, Remus pulled his textbook back out of the bag and to the position he was before this interrogation had begun. Lily continued her essay, and it was as though nothing had even happened. Relief made his hands wobbly and his face feel light. He pulled himself together and began taking a few notes, quill scribbling. Remus thought he was starting to get into his study vibe, until his eyes flicked once again over the little doodle that had been scribbled in the border of his textbook earlier that day. The source of his earlier distraction. He glanced up at Lily who was sucking the end of her quill. She noticed his gaze and smiled at him. He smiled awkwardly back. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Dammit. Just finish the essay. The jumpier you look the more questions she’ll ask.</span>
  </em>
  <span> He took a deep breath and scribbled something down quickly. Anything. Although he couldn’t actually recall what he had written. Once again, the little doodle on his notebook was commanding his attention. An infantile stick doodle of a dog, a wolf, a stag, and what was nearly a rat but the perpetrator had been ordered to ‘pay attention’ at that point and Remus had been forced to finish off the piece of ‘art’. Somehow, his rendition of a stick-rat was even worse than the hand that had begun the doodle.  He smiled at the memory. The whining voice,</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>       “Moooony! I can’t believe you tried to finish it! It’s a masterpiece, and look at what you did to Peter! A mere caricature of his true self.”</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>       “Stop defiling my textbooks!”</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“You’re thinking about him again.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh jeez, not this.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Stop spacing out! Oh goodness, Moony, just tell me who it is. The anticipation is killing me.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“It’s not.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I could drop dead any second. The tension is unbearable.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“It isn’t.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You stopped working again. Just tell me.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Remus dropped his textbook on the table. Clearly also a traitor.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Someone that you still can’t tell me, even though i am fine with your choice of sexual preference aligning with mine.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Phrasing. Please.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“It’s not… it’s not Severus is it?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He pulled a face like his porridge had been made with curdled milk. “Please, Lily. Pretend to be taking this seriously.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“But you agree that he would be a crush candidate that you would not want your friends knowing about? Even me, maybe?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Hesitantly, I agree that your logic has merit.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She drummed her fingers against her lips. “Oh god, it’s not a teacher.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“No!” People actually looked around at his shout, some of them frowning or shaking their heads as they returned to their books. “No.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Lily had now bared her teeth in a grimace, “Oh Merlin, tell me it’s not Regulus. That would be super awkward.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Remus slumped to the desk. “Why are you picking all the worst possible candidates? It’s really not </span>
  <em>
    <span>that</span>
  </em>
  <span> bad. Give me more credit than to fall for a death eater.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Lily wilted at that. Severus and her had had a major falling out not two months ago about his alarming alliances with dark wizards. The atmosphere in their shared classes was icy. Lily had been crying a lot and shouting at James a lot because he was bad mouthing her memory of Severus, and whilst he was right it was too painful for Lily who had stuck up for him for so long. Hogwarts had also been under her tirade of strict rule-implementation as she stomped around being very stringent on tucked in shirts and other prefectly duties. Merlin forbid you were seen in the corridors out of hours. A few days afterwards, Sirius and Regulus had had a similarly explosive death-eater related fight that had left Sirius also stomping around for days. Although, he had always suffered a rift between himself and his brother, especially this year after running away from ‘that shitty grim old place’ as he described it. Not home. Never home. It had still been painful to see Regulus idolising terrorists.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He had curled up next to Remus that night. Silently climbed on top of his bed and buried his head into his shoulder. His hair, uncut since the move, fanning out over the covers. Remus had gently stroked his shoulder until Sirius fell asleep or he did, he could not remember which had happened first. He was brought back from that particular cherished memory by a giggle.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“It’s not Barty Crouch, is it? Please tell me it isn’t Barty.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Lily! You must think I have terrible taste! Please give me some credit.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She stifled her giggles, but choked out “He’s not </span>
  <em>
    <span>bad</span>
  </em>
  <span> looking. There must be a reason you don't want anyone to know. You can’t blame me for assuming it’s someone… ”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Don’t finish that sentence.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh dear. Is it- James?” He looked at her in surprise. Her cheeks had flushed a delicate pink, as though she had just been running.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Now, Lily Evans. Why on earth would that be an issue for me to tell you?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She glared at him.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You hate him, so obviously I wouldn’t be ‘taking a potential boy out the dating pool’. Unless… you don’t hate him.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh be quiet. Answer the question.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He shook his head. “It’s not James. Feel safe that you won’t be interrupted from continuous propositions to Hogsmeade. And feel free to maybe accept once in awhile. It would make the dorm room much more peaceful.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Remus silently thought that with Peter already out of the dormroom picture snogging the girl behind the third floor tapestry, and James out at Hogsmeade, that might very well leave the dorm room free for him and a certain other person to … well, hang out at least. He wondered how he would orchestrate another cosy cuddling session without it seeming weird. He didn’t know what made the ‘click’ in Lily’s brain. Maybe it was his goofy smile at that thought. Maybe it was her eagle eyes identifying the source of his distraction in the column of his textbook. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>That didn’t sound good.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“OH!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>That didn’t sound good at all.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Long, luscious locks…”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Lily,” Remus said warningly.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Gorgeous athletic body…”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Lily.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“A devil-may-care attitude and a smile that makes honey seem bitter…”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>She knows.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Well? Is it your favourite beater?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Remus ran his fingers through his hair. “The uh… Prewett twins?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“That would be a great deflection if they still went to school,” she said sticking out her tongue. Then, sighing, she said “It’s Sirius. It’s actually so obvious now.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Despite knowing the revelation was coming his heart still squeezed painfully. The seconds ticked on, and it became too late to try and deny it. That uncomfortable flush was returning to his cheeks. With nowhere to hide, Remus took the hero’s way out and shut his eyes. “Please Lily.” His voice sounded pathetically small. “Please please don’t tell him.”</span>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>“I won’t tell anyone!” She said immediately, sounding so earnest that Remus felt safe enough to open his eyes. “Never. I would never break your confidence. I haven’t and I won’t.” He slumped to the desk, exhausted. She gave him a little pat on the head.  “I mean, I can’t blame you. Sirius is like, really really hot.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Remus let out a groan. “What am I going to doooo?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yes, that is a slightly more problematic aspect of this situation. Is he even, you know, into guys?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Remus shrugged, still pressed against the desk. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Hmm. Would you like to go to the kitchens?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Eh?” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I am not going to get anymore work done, and I could do with a glass of pumpkin juice. And a walk. Wanna come?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He rubbed his eyes and grabbed his satchel. Even if he sat here for the next four hours this essay still wouldn’t be done. “Yeah. Let’s go.”</span>
  <span></span>
