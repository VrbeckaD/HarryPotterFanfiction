    <p dir="ltr">Harry Potter is owned by JK Rowling</p>
<p dir="ltr">Earthdawn is owned by Fasa</p>
<p dir="ltr">Chapter 1 - Fearless</p>
<p dir="ltr">Fearless is the only word for Ginny. Raised with 6 older brothers, she had to be bold and aggressive to survive in that house. Her oldest two brothers were so much older than her they seemed more like beloved uncles. Bill (11 years older) and Charlie (nine years older) always doted on her and made her feel like the most amazing person in the world. Percy, the third brother was judgmental and uptight.. He could be a bit of a prat. Percy was family, but she never really felt that close to him. He is the uncle that annoys. Nothing 'beloved' there.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Next came the brothers she spent more time with. The Twins, Fred and George, were old enough to be protective, but close enough in age (3 years) to deliberately annoy her. They were fun and full of love, but the pranking never stopped with them. There is a picture of these two in the wizarding dictionary beside the word 'Mischievous'. These were the two who first brought out her famous temper. By the time she was six, she had already given both of them multiple black eyes. Despite frequently wanting to hurt them, she loved them dearly and knew that they were never intentionally cruel. Although she did think they crossed the line too much with her closest in age sibling.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Ron was a year older than Ginny, but easily 3 years less mature. He is moody, insecure, over-protective, and on occasion, tended to be the pinnacle of a GIT. It was just who he was. But, he never abandoned family – even if he sometimes turned his back on his closest friends. For him, the shame of the tri-wizard tournament will never die. In many ways, Ron is the most Gryfindor-ish of them all. Ginny perfected the Bat Bogey hex on Ron when she was very young and never looked back.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In this household, Ginny learned to be aggressive and to fight for everything she wanted. She learned the importance of never letting boys define her, and how nice it felt to put them in their places. This attitude carried her thru the last Wizarding War where she was recognized for her fearless nature. Hence, her flying style. Play for keeps, and go for the kill when the opportunity presents itself. This was also her fighting style in the war.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In the present, Ginevra "Ginny" Weasley is having an amazing day. Like most of her first season, she has been a standout chaser for the Holyhead Harpies. Rapidly moving from back-up Chaser to starting position, Ginny has been catapulted to stardom. Today at the exhibition match against Puddlemere United, she is on fire. Hitting all the plays and leaving most of her team mates and competitors in her wake as she once again shows her fearless approach to the game she loves.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Being an exhibition match, the Harpies are occasionally rotating in the back-up squads – letting Fay Dunbar play. Ginny has got to admit Fay knows how to crack the quaffle. Ginny was on the backup squad for the first third of the season until a starter was injured and she rotated in and had a break out game. The rest is Harpy History.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Harpies win soundly with Ginny as the high scorer. The match raised record dollars for the orphans and widows fund. Much needed even a few years after the last wizard war. In addition to the funds, it entertained all spectators and sponsors. Oliver Wood made a special effort to congratulate Ginny as he was good friends with all her quidditch playing brothers as well as her fiancé Harry. "Great game Ginny – you really are an amazing player!" Oliver said enthusiastically. "Say hi to your brothers and Harry for me."</p>
<p dir="ltr">Ginny beamed at the compliment. She remembered well watching Oliver play with Charlie, Fred, and George. "You take care Ollie – see you around." On her way to the locker room her idol and team captain Gwenog Jones stops her. "Well, well, well… looks like the <b>Rookie of the Year</b> is kicking quaffle and taking names! Keep it up Spitfire and we could take the league. Wear this with pride" Gwenog said as she handed Ginny the MVP dragon hide jacket. Ginny turned bright red and could not hold back her smile. What a day! Team mates continued to congratulate her on the way to and inside the locker room.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As Ginny entered the locker room, she looked around at her friends and realized she was truly having the time of her life! She quickly showered and changed – putting on the amazing MVP jacket. It was enchanted to be a perfect fit. High grade dragon hide with the Harpies logo on the back and a stylistic MVP written on the left sleeve. As she put it on, her name appeared on the left upper chest Ginevra "<b>Spitfire</b>" Weasley. In muggle terms this is a bad-ass jacket that carries its own cool factor. And she would be proudly wearing it every day until the next game. Now, time to mix with the crowds – after all, this is a charity event.</p>
<p dir="ltr">She made the rounds and talked to her sponsors and fans – noticing that there is now a Ginny Weasley fan club complete with shirts, hats and buttons. Signing autographs was still a new thing to her and she relished it. The Hollyhead Harpies are an amazing team with a positive message to girls everywhere. Being a role model was nothing new though – she had a bit of a following among the younger years at Hogwarts too during the last year of the war. Those were dark and grief-filled days. Best not to think too much of that. So, autographs – she signed calendars, posters, a broom, and even a hot off the press Quidditch card!</p>
<p dir="ltr">'Wow', she thought – 'I did not know it had printed! And the label was 'Rookie of the Year'. All these little girls looking up to me. And some of the boys too, although most tended to be shy and have hearts in their innocent little eyes. The younger boys anyway. No comment on the older boys. Hormones and hero worship, goes with being a star I guess.' At this thought, her mind turned elsewhere. 'Harry always hated the fame and the attention, but I am soaking it up! Strong, independent, talented, and quite the striking image if I do say so myself!'</p>
<p dir="ltr">Then it all comes to a pause as one little girl decked out in a Ginevra Weasley jersey, hat, and button with her image on it proudly walks up and asks – "Will Harry Potter be at your next game?" Forcing a smile, she proudly says "Of Course, Harry <b>LOVES</b> the Harpies". Strange how that question bothered her a little. Another little girl explodes with a high little voice "<b>No</b> Ginny, He Loves <b>YOU</b>!" and the giggles start… The questions shift a bit, but she rides the wave. A few hours later the crowds begin to thin and the group of players slowly break up. Ginny leans against a column, looking tough as nails and hotter than a furnace in her MVP jacket while she sips her hot cup of tea and relaxes. She returns to her earlier thoughts considering Harrys hatred of attention and fandom – 'I guess I <b>kind of</b> get it', she thought as fatigue was setting in from all the hob-knobbing. 'Harry was known for being the 'Boy Who Lived' for so much of his life. Then as the 'Boy Who Won', the 'Boy Who Saved', the 'Boy Who Fought', etc. Not as Harry Potter, sweet and quiet little boy who just wanted to make friends. No, he was always the mythical child who ate dark wizards for breakfast and had books written about him'.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Harry always seemed to take his dislike of attention to an extreme though. 'Knowing what I now know about his developmental years… living in that damn cupboard, maybe even positive attention was just too much for the skinny little fellow that just wanted peace and quiet', she decided. 'Hard to believe that shy little boy never backed down from doing the <b>right thing</b>. No matter how much it hurt'. Then she turned toward more dark memories. 'And Malfoy just loved to drag him into the spotlight and make it hurt as much as possible. What is the Muggle saying her father told her about? "He who laughs last, laughs best" she reflected. Ginny also wondered, 'Without having a Malfoy around acting like a Grade A GIT, would shy and quiet Harry Potter have become the person we all looked up to and followed into battle? Was he tempered in the fires of hatred, bigotry and ridicule that Malfoy loved to spout? Doesn't make it ok, but it does make me wonder if Harry needed Malfoy to push him to greatness…'</p>
<p dir="ltr">It has been a while since she last thought about Harry's childhood or the sad details he finally shared with her. As she considers this she realizes that it is strange how everyone still refers to him as a "<b>Boy</b>". The BOY who lived, the BOY who fought, the BOY who WON, etc. Of course "The Next Merlin" is starting to gain steam… as is "The Greatest Wizard of the Age", "The New Dumbledore" and others of a similar note. It is really no wonder Harry rarely reads the Daily Prophet anymore, he keeps saying he will renew his subscription as soon as the fame and attention blow over... three years and it is still going strong'.</p>
<p dir="ltr">He's not completely disconnected, she knows. Harry still reads and even writes for the Quibbler and a few foreign publications. He seems to enjoy writing those unusual articles for The Quibbler. The Lovegoods definitely profit from it as the subscriptions are easily 100 times what they were before. Sadly, that's still not saying too much.</p>
<p dir="ltr">'I remember being shocked when he told me the articles are theoretical and on the fringe of magic theory, but not <b>really</b> fiction. Hermione even let it slip that the Department of Mysteries, aka the 'D-O-M', scrutinize his articles and has actually required him to submit certain types of articles for review before posting – declaring some of them too sensitive and too close to DOM secrets. Since getting access to Peverell family magic and grimoires, Harry has really grown in knowledge. The family magic and his natural curiosity frequently take him into uncharted magical territory as he strives to understand what he has access to. Ginny remembers reading a few of the 'questionable' articles before they were redacted and noted that they ranged from wondrous and thought-provoking to truly terrifying.'</p>
<p dir="ltr">'Hermione may have been the <b>brains</b> of the golden trio, but Harry was the dreamer, the artist, and the one most willing to explore beyond what was known and accepted. Occasionally', she reflected, 'that took him to some dark and obscure arcana.'</p>
<p dir="ltr">"OK – enough of those thoughts", exclaimed Ginny out loud, "time to focus on <b>ME</b> now! Nothing is going to get me down today!" Smiling, she considered 'my interview made the cover of Witch Weekly!' Two months ago she met with one of their celebrity reporters and had an amazing interview. They discussed many topics including quidditch, fashion, growing up with 6 older brothers, the importance of instilling self-confidence in girls, and how she want to be a role model for all girls who just need a little encouragement to achieve their goals. They talked about the need to set positive examples and how it felt to achieve an Order of Merlin 3rd Class and being in the running for 'Quidditch Rookie of the Year'.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Harry came up briefly, but that is to be expected when he is featured so frequently – 'Honestly', she thought, 'he has no idea how frequently.' The advanced copy came with a request to have a short follow-up interview updating the article for her thoughts on actually being named 'Rookie of the Year' as the interview came out when she was still a candidate. Maybe a paragraph or two. The Harpies had just started a two week break so she would work it in next week as the publisher was eager to go to print as fast as possible.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Walking on air and surrounded by sunshine and happy thoughts she apparated to the apparition point near her flat. She still can't quite believe she was named the Quidditch Rookie of the Year. She had her own Quidditch collectable card that is quickly gaining in value and the endorsement requests have significantly picked up. She could be the "Face of the new Firebolt Mk2!" Her team jersey is selling out and for the first time in her life, she has extra cash. Quidditch Today has dubbed her "The Spitfire" and the Prophet calls her the "Red Fury". Someone even started calling her the "Crimson Hurricane". She doesn't have to wonder which one will stick – “<b>Spitfire” </b>is written on her Jacket.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Walking up to her front door she notes how well she is settling in to her new place – One she just recently signed the lease on with two fun an amazing ladies. The first is the backup rookie beater Fay Dunbar who was a year ahead of her and had a great performance in the exhibition match today. Fay originally wanted to become an auror, but she saw enough violence in the war and decided not to go that route. The other is Katie Bell who was graduated two years ahead and is now the team healer. Katie just finished her training at St Mungo's and is using her skills to go with her love of quidditch. All in all, the girls are their own awesome support group and becoming close friends and confidants.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The flat is in a nice magical district that has plenty of other quidditch players and enthusiasts all around it. The area has a fun night life with cool restaurants, bars, and even has a small garden for district members only. Not really a family setting, but definitely a Young Upwardly Mobile Magical Individual (often referred to as a YUMMI) friendly district. There are enough Aurors and hit wizards living near by that it is safe to walk the streets at night. While the flat had good security and strong wards – Harry and Bill really beefed it up. Sometimes she wonders where all that raw power Harry throws around comes from. But then he was casting a mega powered Patronus capable of driving off over a hundred dementors at thirteen years old. And once that little 'parasite' was removed from his scar, his magic really came into his own. Of course that is a state secret, not for discussion.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Back to her home: The main room of the flat is warm and cozy with a large fireplace, making for easy floo travel, and an amazingly comfy set of love seats. The optimal word here is PLUSH. The walls are a bit bare, but the 3 ladies have plans to go with an antique quidditch deco look. A place where up to a dozen witches can meet and just hang out. Lots of Rookies gravitate to this flat on their days off. The kitchen is kind of large, but Harry loves to come over and cook, so all good there. There is a smallish table in the kitchen – but with their busy schedules, it is mostly unused, mostly they just stand around the counter when they eat. Unless harry is cooking, that is. Fay and Katie seem to hang around on 'Harry days' as he always makes extra. The pantry is stocked for Harry, but the girls are not really handy in the kitchen and prefer ramen noodles and energy bars (muggle food is fast and easy). Honestly, if it wasn't for the occasional visit from Harry and Molly Weasley, they would never eat a home-cooked meal.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The stairs are narrow, but well maintained and lead up to the 3 bed rooms. Katie took the master as she put down the first payment, Fay and Ginny each have their own rooms but share a connecting bathroom. The attic is pretty nasty, they never go up there. Ginny suspects there are doxies, but who wants to find out. All in all, this is a fun place in a great area.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sitting at the kitchen table and going thru the mail, Horace Slughorn sends his congratulations. 'I need to send him a few tickets' Ginny reflected. She always thought it was kind of weird how much Harry seemed to like him even though he was a bit of a fan-boy. But then, Horace was close to his mother and he was not there during that horrible 'goblet of fire year' where Harry was treated so badly. 'I know', she said to herself, 'they meet up sometimes and grab a pint when Harry needs to get away from the hustle of his work. Horace does look after him, but he also gets seen with Harry'. Harry always says Horace is upfront and transparent in his pursuit of glory, but his heart is in the right place 'Still,' Ginny reflected, 'I find him a bit annoying'.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Ginny continued sifting through the mail.' Hmmm a few meeting requests from potential sponsors… not just sports either. Apparently a few designers want to get her to wear their brands'. Ginny can't help but think back to when she wore second hand clothes. She so badly wanted to be seen in fashion forward clothing. Now designers send her their latest trends just so their 'new look' can be seen on 'the Spitfire'. She shares some of the accessories with her mum.</p>
<p dir="ltr">She reads the Witch Weekly letter discussing the best time to meet for their follow up interview. Included in the letter is a shrunken poster of the planned cover. Apparently they send these to all of the featured witches to hang on their wall or put in a scrapbook. She taps it with her wand and watches it expand, eager to see which photo they chose. It is the close-up that featured her eyes and the mischievous smirk that looks so good on her. She picked that smirk up from Harry, but she does it better.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Then she reads the caption at the bottom – "Harry Potter's Girl!'</p>
<p dir="ltr">"What the HELL?"</p>
<p dir="ltr">Her flat mates look up to see what is wrong only to find her fuming over a poster. "When do I get recognized for who I am? I am not just someone's <b>girl</b>!"</p>
<p dir="ltr">Glancing over at the poster, understanding dawns and the girls move to circle up to comfort their friend. Katie moves in for a hug and Fay grabs a few bottles of wine.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Time for a Girls night!</p>
