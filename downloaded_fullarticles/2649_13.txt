    <p>Hi my name is Rose Lily Zendaya Mercury Venus Potato Potter. My parents died in a car crash when I was a baby and I live in an orphanage. I don't have any friends, and everyone else in the orphanage makes fun of me for my lighting scar.</p><p>I woke up one morning in my own personal room and went into the bathroom and looked in the mirror. My black hair was wavy and cascades over my C cup boobs. The nurse asked me a couple days ago if I had gotten my period yet, but I don't get my period because writers don't want to write about that.</p><p>I put on a crop top and ripped jeans and glasses. Everyone would make fun of my poor-looking clothes.</p><p>Then I remembered, it was my 17th birthday! But I figured no one would get me a present because everybody hates me!</p><p>Miss Cole, the owner, walked in. "Good morning, honey!" she said cheerfully. "Come down, there's a visitor for you."</p><p>Ugh, she's out to get me!</p><p>I walked into the living room and saw a giant!</p><p>"'Ello, Rose! I'm 'Agrid from 'Ogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry."</p><p>What??!? There's no such thing as magic! So I retorted, "What??!? There's no such thing as magic!"</p><p>"Oh yes, there is! 'Ave you ever done magic?"</p><p>"Sometimes, when I'm angry or upset."</p><p>"Yer a witch, Rose!"</p><p>"WHAT??!?"</p><p>"Do you wanna go to 'Ogwarts?"</p><p>"Okay. How do we get there?"</p><p>"LOL, magic, duh!" Hagrid exclaimed. He grabbed my arm and we disapparated because I know what that is.</p>
