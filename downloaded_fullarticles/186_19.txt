          <div class="userstuff"><p>Ginny lay in bed, listening to the distant clock striking midnight. She could hear Hermione breathing steadily only inches away, but knew she was awake from her recurrent shuffling as she tried to get comfortable on the hard, second-hand mattress.</p>

<p>There was a pause. "And girls?"</p>
<p>Ginny blushed. "I like girls... and... there's one girl in particular."</p>
<p>Hermione turned to face her, smiling. "Oh, yeah?"</p>
<p>Ginny grinned, leaning in. "Yeah".</p></div>
