          <div class="userstuff"><p>Hermione Granger had no idea who she saw for a date.  <i> This isn't a date. It's a meet and greet. I can't believe I let Molly set me up after Ron and I broke up!</i></p>
<p> She heard an "Ahem, Miss Granger, I presume? My sister said that you would be here."</p>
<p>Molly had picked a bookstore for their not date.  It was quaint, secluded, and a wizarding bookstore owner was a friend of hers.</p>
<p>Hermione picked a table away from prying eyes. Just as Molly instructed her earlier.</p>
<p>"Yes, I am her." She barely whispered and looked up.</p>
<p>There stood a distinguished-looking gentleman in his late 50s, bearing a resemblance to Bill Weasley.</p>
<p>"Excuse me, are you perhaps related to the Weasleys?"</p>
<p>The man laughed, "Of course I am! I am Molly's older brother, Gideon," he whispered the last part. Which caused her to shiver in pleasure.</p>
<p>"But I thought…you was killed…" her voice trailed off in amazement as he sat down, signaled the waiter for two coffees.</p>
<p>"Hermione, Molly didn't explain to you what happened to my brother and me?"</p>
<p>Hermione shook her head no. She was dumbfounded. "You must be mad, coming here like this!"</p>
<p>Once the coffee arrived, she took a gulp of hers and waited for Gideon to continue.</p>
<p>"Hermione, I am not mad at all! I know I owe you an explanation; I faked my death and been hiding in seclusion. Molly is well…you know…" he waved his hand, and she got his meaning.</p>
<p>She gently squeezed his other hand. Gideon felt a connection between them. "Well, perhaps this unexpected counter not a date would be a date after all? Let's start slow and see how this goes."</p>
<p>Hermione wholeheartedly agreed.</p></div>
