    <p>It had been fifteen long years since Draco had last seen it. Yet there it was, just the same as he remembered and coming into view: the dark silhouette of Hogwarts, its castle towers stabbing into a red sky. It was a most appropriate colour, seeing as it had been slick with death the last time he had seen it. </p><p>But he didn’t <em> want </em> to think about the war. After the war, after the trials, after the whole dark mess of of it, he had just wanted--<em>needed</em>--to get away. Away from memory. Away from aristocracy. Away from politics and purebloods and propriety. Away from stuffy rooms and judging eyes and expectations for his future. All of it. So he ran.  </p><p>And ran.</p><p>And kept running.</p><p>He had been running ever since.</p><p>He had been abroad for well over a decade, traveling from country to country, moving from one research project to another, surviving solely on grants and donations. He didn’t <em> need </em> the money, it was true, but in the early days being paid kept him away from his father. After the war, he swore would never ask anything of his father ever again. He had asked for love and protection, and look where that had gotten him. He would not be caught dead on his knees begging his father for a single knut. So he worked. He traveled, he researched, and he worked. It was a most un-Malfoyan lifestyle, which meant that he trusted it.</p><p>He served on committee after committee wherever he traveled, abandoning traditional aristocracy for new forms of power and influence. Whenever he made a new discovery, he published his findings in prestigious journals like <em> Contemporary Potions Studies </em> or <em> Journal of the International Potions Society </em> . He was constantly on the move, seeking ancient or forgotten potions and recipes wherever they led him: archaeological digs, research facilities, academic institutions. Above all, he was seeking new people who didn’t know his name. People who wouldn’t see him and think: <em> Death Eater</em>. People who, instead, might think: that’s the one who wrote that brilliant article for <em> Potions Today. </em>He had never stayed in the same place for very long, and he certainly wouldn’t be staying at Hogwarts for very long either. </p><p>Hogwarts wasn’t his first choice. In fact, he didn’t <em> want </em>to return to Hogwarts at all. The only reason he was sitting on the Hogwarts Express was because Hogwarts was the last possible place that contained it: The Fountain of Youth. And he had to find it. Because if he found it, it would be such a monumental discovery that it would make his career. It would undoubtedly wash away his past. He would no longer be known as Draco Malfoy, Death Eater. He would be known as the man who discovered The Fountain of Youth. And then, he would go abroad again to make some other brilliant discovery and find respect all over again.</p><p>Witches and wizards had been whispering about a Fountain of Youth for hundreds of years. It wasn’t some mythological fountain like existed in Muggle folklore. No, it was real. It <em> had </em>been real. He had found enough ancient texts across different ancient cultures referencing its medicinal uses to know just how real it had been. And then something happened. It got lost in history, in The Siege, a brief time when healing potions were believed to be as evil as dark magic because of their potential effects on the body. All healing potions had been destroyed, along with any texts containing their ingredients.</p><p>It <em> became </em>myth. </p><p>Until Draco assembled enough ancient texts, previously believed to be lost, to prove that it wasn’t a myth at all. He had encountered the first fragment while at a dig site in Mexico. He had found additional references in Siberia. And cave paintings in Australia. But the most significant discovery, the discovery that convinced him that the potion was real and he could actually <em> find </em> it, had been Egypt. He had been exploring wizard tombs in Ancient Egypt, assisting with a search for ancient potion ingredients left in burial sites. He <em> had </em> found plenty of dried ancient potion ingredients. But he also found the Tomb of Hannu, which contained the largest collection of ancient texts referencing the Fountain of Youth he had ever seen. It was in the hieroglyphs on the walls. It was in the papyrus rolled in jars. Not only did the texts contain a partial list of ingredients, but the texts indicated that it had been <em> in the tomb. </em>In the treasure chest containing Hannu’s jewels for the afterlife, there had also been a vial of the Fountain of Youth. An actual, surviving vial.  </p><p>Of course, Draco never actually found the vial in the tomb, because he later discovered that the tomb had already been ransacked sometime in the 1910s by Havartus E. Carter, wizard archaeologist famous for chauvinistic unprofessionalism and reckless archaeological practices.</p><p>Draco sighed and leaned his temple against the window. It was early September and still warm yet, so the window felt comfortable against his skin. The trolley witch was in the hall, shouting, “It’s time!” and a couple of students ran toward her in the hall to make their final payments for sweets. As he listened to the <em> click-clack </em>of the train wheels, Draco knew he only had a few minutes left before his arrival. He had to finalize his plan.  </p><p>The first thing Draco had done, when the grant for the Egyptian archaeological dig had ended, was visit Carter’s estate and attempt to track down the vial that Carter had ransacked from the tomb. Even if the vial wasn’t at the estate, and he had doubted it would be, he had at least hoped to acquire more detailed lists of his archaeological discoveries and donations. But this was Havartus E. Carter. Of<em> course </em> there weren’t detailed lists. Draco was only left with a single lead. The people at Carter’s estate had explained that in his lifetime, Carter had donated all of his discoveries to two major organizations: the National Museum of Wizarding Artifacts in London, and Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, his alma mater. And Draco had already been to London.</p><p>The Hogwarts Express lurched as it crossed a bridge, and Draco’s head shook from side to side, still gently pressed against the glass window. The door to his compartment slid open, and two young girls with armfuls of sweets blinked at him from the hallway in embarrassment. Draco simply stared at them. One of the girls, who had shoulder-length orange hair and a vaguely familiar bone structure, angled her head to one side, studying him with open curiosity until the other girl was dragging her out of the car by her robes. Soon they were running down the hall and hadn’t even bothered to slide the door closed again behind them. He would have to get used to that, he thought. Being surrounded by children. Possibly being friendly to them, even. On second thought, possibly not. Snape had gotten along perfectly well without ever being <em> friendly </em>to children. Draco was probably fine to be himself. Whoever that was. He had never stayed in one place long enough to really find out.</p><p>When Draco had overheard someone in London say that Slughorn was retiring, it was all too perfect. He applied for the position of Potions Master, doubtful that he would even be considered for the position. With his history at Hogwarts and his associations with a certain Dark Lord, he suspected they wouldn’t exactly welcome him back with open arms.</p><p>But what other option did he have?</p><p>He had already considered the far more simple option of asking Hogwarts what they knew about the potion, if they knew anything at all, just like he had asked the Carter Estate. After all, most donations to Hogwarts ended up in a dungeon or a secret room somewhere never to be seen again. It wasn’t like they would <em> miss </em> it. And the 20th century headmasters had not been known for their supreme record-keeping skills; he would be doing them a favour, really. But everyone at Hogwarts knew him too well. In fact, he was fairly convinced that the headmistress <em> hated </em> him; he didn’t know how she couldn’t. Besides, what would he say? He supposed he would just walk up to Hogwarts and say: <em> Hello, it’s Draco Malfoy, former Death Eater, remember me? I’d like to explore your dungeons--remember the last time I did that, trying to find a way to let the Death Eaters inside?--care to let me in? </em> And they would surely say: <em> Why of course, please explore our dungeons for a powerful legendary potion; wouldn’t it be great if you pass it to your fellow Death Eaters so the next Dark Lord can be even stronger than the last one? </em>No.</p><p>There was no way that could possibly go well. </p><p>However, if he could enter Hogwarts on the premise of being a <em> teacher</em>, with all of the freedoms to explore the Hogwarts grounds that teachers received? That was the far more promising option, and somehow he had actually managed to do it. Although, now that he was actually encountering giggling children on the Hogwarts Express, it was an option he was deeply reconsidering. </p><p>The Hogwarts Express hissed and came to a gradual stop. He stood and braced himself against the opposite wall. Anxiety swelled in his gut. He hadn’t finished his plan. He hadn’t finished his <em> plan</em>. Oh Merlin, what had he gotten himself into? He knew he had to move. He knew he had to get off of this train and move forward to meet the house elf at the base of Hogwarts, just like the note attached to the owl had said. Most professors arrived at least a week before the students arrived, but Draco’s research had gone on just long enough to obligate him to return with the students. And now he was unexpectedly petrified.</p><p>He looked at his reflection in the dark glass of his window: his newly purchased black and green robes, his long hair secured with a velvet green ribbon at the back of his neck. A stranger might think he actually looked like a Potions Master, but he didn’t feel like one. He didn’t even feel grown. He felt like a child, as shy and nervous as he had felt when he had first stepped onto this train.  </p><p>He was about to step onto Hogwarts grounds. </p><p>He was about to step onto <em> Hogwarts grounds</em>.</p><p>Hogwarts, where he had first fallen in love with Potions. Hogwarts, where he learned how to fly! Hogwarts, where he had owned the halls with Crabbe and Goyle, raising a little hell just for fun. Oh, that had felt so bloody fantastic, so innocently youthful, so naively <em> free</em>. Hogwarts, where he had snogged his first boy. Hogwarts, where his favourite past-time was vexing Harry Potter and insulting his friends. There were so many enjoyable things. So many <em> good </em> things. He had almost forgotten the good things. It was easy to, when the bad things were so, so <em> bad</em>. When the nightmares felt so much stronger. When one decision he made as a kid, which had hardly even been a decision really, had ruined his entire life. Was <em> still </em>ruining his life.</p><p>This was actually happening. This was real. </p><p>He felt like an imposter. He <em> was </em> an imposter. How could anyone have wanted him here? How could he have actually been qualified enough for this position? How had he gotten through endless stages of interviews? How--<em>why</em>--was he actually <em> here</em>? What the bloody hell was he <em> doing</em>? </p><p>Draco took a deep breath. It was too late now. He decided to do what he always did in times like these. He had done it the first time he was on this train, and he could do it now: act far, far more confident than he actually felt. He straightened his shoulders and stepped back, smoothing out his robes and running his hands over his golden hair. It <em> was </em> golden now, sun-stained from his years of outdoor work. He couldn’t remember when he had grown his hair out exactly; it was sometime after his father had died. He found that he liked pulling it back into a messy bun during a dig to keep it securely out of his face. His skin was a little more sun-tanned as well, although his time at the museum in London had already started him back on the path to pale. He lifted his dark dragon-leather satchel over a shoulder and stepped off the train, feeling like a giant as children eagerly scurried around him. <em> Just find the potion</em>, he told himself. <em> Just find the potion, and you can leave. </em> Spending too much time in one place made him nervous anyway. <em><br/></em></p><p>As expected, a house elf was waiting for him in the Hogwarts keep. “Are you Mr. Malfoy, sir?” The house elf asked meekly. Draco nodded. “Please follow me, Mr. Malfoy, sir.”</p><p>They wove through crowds of excited students toward the professors’ wing, where Draco was directed to his new living quarters. “I am to instruct you to visit the headmistress’ office as soon as you are settled. You remember the location of the head office, Mr. Malfoy, sir?”</p><p>Draco nodded again. <em> Granger</em>. The headmistress. By some miracle he had avoided her until now. She wasn’t present in any of his interviews. Now he was realizing that he hadn’t really thought this part through. He would have to actually <em> face </em> Hermione Granger. Granger, in some strange twist of fate, now employed him. He inwardly cringed at the endless insults he had once thrown her way without a second thought. She must absolutely despise him. <em> Merlin</em>, his aunt had tortured her in his family’s <em> house </em>for fuck’s sake. After fifteen years he still wasn’t sure he was ready to face her. He didn’t even know how to begin making amends, or if there were any amends he could even make. Perhaps she had hired him simply so that she could make his life as much of a living hell as he had once made hers.</p><p>“Is there anything else, Mr. Malfoy, sir?” the house elf asked as Draco surveyed his new home. The room was much larger than he had expected, with a wide bed to the left and a fireplace and sitting area to the right. Toward the back of the room there was a narrow hallway with doors to a small storage room and the bathroom. It was more space than he'd had to himself in over a decade. It was entirely possible, Draco realized with a rush of emotion, that these could have been Snape’s quarters once. ...Except someone had made them extra posh. Draco had become so accustomed to a narrow room or tent shared with one to three other people, that this looked like Malfoy Mansion. And that bed. Silk. So much silk. He had spent the latter half of his life sleeping on some version of a stiff bunk with rough linen sheets, and now that bed looked like actual heaven. Draco waited until the elf disappeared with a <em> pop </em>before he pulled his leather satchel over his head and set it in a chair, resisting a childish urge to jump up and down on his new silk bed. </p><p>-</p><p>It wasn’t a very long walk down the hall to Dumbledore’s old office. Snape’s old office. McGonagall’s old office. Granger’s office now. Draco smoothed his robes against his chest one more time before climbing the spiral staircase. Headmasters of the ages watched him guardedly as he climbed the stairs. Several threw insults at him, but he remained silent and on his guard. As he neared the top, he could see the walls decorated with red and gold. He could see a room filled with books and trophies and trinkets. He reached the top of the stairs, where a mewling cat announced his presence. The room was filled with a warm, homelike energy. </p><p>Granger sat behind a large desk, scribbling something onto parchment with an elegant quill. Her hair, still frizzy and wild, was pulled back into a loose ponytail. He'd heard that she married Weasley, but either they had gotten divorced or she had kept her name, because a metallic placard rested on her desk that read “H. Granger,” and he certainly wasn’t about to ask. She looked up at him. </p><p>“Professor Malfoy,” she said, coming around her desk. “Welcome back.” He wasn’t sure what he had expected, exactly, but it wasn’t this. It wasn’t warmth. It wasn’t kindness. Apprehensive warmth and kindness, perhaps. Cautious warmth and kindness, to be sure. But everything in her stance implied that she was going to be professional and give him the opportunity to prove himself. He and Granger had never been on good terms, ever, and yet she was welcoming him better than he felt he deserved. “I’m so glad you’ve decided to join us.”</p><p>Draco hummed in acknowledgment, folded his hands behind his back, and took a short stroll around the room to try to distract himself from asking her the one question on his tongue: <em> why him. </em>Instead, he studied all of the things that both had and hadn’t changed since Dumbledore’s time. McGonagall’s portrait was right next to Dumbledore’s and Snape’s on the wall closest to Granger’s desk. Granger had to be one of the youngest leaders of Hogwarts in history, but it suited her. She had always been an excellent scholar; Draco had never, at least internally, denied that much. </p><p>“I take it you were directed to your rooms alright?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Their last occupant was Potions Master Severus Snape. Harry thought you might like them.” </p><p>Draco nearly tripped over the rug. <em> Harry </em> thought he might like them? Harry who<em>?  </em> Surely not Harry <em> Potter</em>?</p><p>“Allow me to show you to your office,” Granger said, waving him down the stairs after her.</p><p>Draco followed her back down the spiral staircase and down the hall into the next wing. Draco already knew where they were going--the old Potions classroom. </p><p>“You remember most of this from your school days, I expect? Some areas were rebuilt after the war, but on the whole it should be the same.” Granger opened the door wide to the Potions classroom. “I trust I can skip the grand tour of the castle?”</p><p>Draco nodded. He still remembered the castle as clearly as if he had only left it yesterday. When he stepped inside the Potions classroom, Draco inhaled and was instantly filled with nostalgia. It was a smell he didn’t even realize he had missed--half-burned potions and misfired spells, layered with that distinctly unique Hogwarts scent of pumpkin spice and woodsmoke against cool stone. </p><p>They crossed the classroom and Hermione opened the Potions office door with a wave of her wand. She cast light into the dark office, revealing a large room with a wide wooden desk and walls covered by bookshelves. Most of the bookshelves were empty, but there were at least 25 Potions books and some dried herbs scattered throughout the office. As Draco's eyes scanned the green and gold armchair in the corner, the one where he'd sat when he wanted to discuss a Potions question or needed some additional tutoring, he could almost see Severus Snape sitting behind his desk. Everywhere Draco looked was a memory. He hadn’t expected this. He had expected this part to be easier, somehow. He hadn’t expected to feel so <em> emotional</em>. It was so unlike what he was used to, where every new job meant a new place with new faces--strangers he could detach from before any pesky attachments could develop. He reached for the doorframe and took an unsteady breath, feeling a little overwhelmed.</p><p>“M-- Professor Malfoy?”</p><p>“Why <em>me, </em>Granger?” He felt his stomach clench a little as soon as he had spoken the words.</p><p>Granger smiled a little awkwardly, as though she had already asked herself the same question. “What’s the old saying? Keep your friends close and your enemies closer?”</p><p>Malfoy forced half of a laugh, crossing his arms protectively around his middle as he stared at the floor. Part of him wanted to shout, <em> What’s the old saying? Once a Mudblood always a Mudblood? </em> but he bit his tongue. He needed to find the Fountain of Youth, and he certainly wouldn’t find it by turning the headmistress of Hogwarts against him. He didn’t give a damn about blood purity, besides. He never really had; he'd just been an idiot. He'd thought it was just something you <em> said </em>in school if you were someone like Draco Malfoy. It was like calling someone Four-Eyes or Scarhead. “I’m sure there were more qualified candidates.”</p><p>“There weren’t, actually. Your reputation precedes you, Professor Malfoy. The work you’ve been doing is exquisite. I am particularly eager to discuss your work in Siberia, whenever you feel more settled.”</p><p>“I’d like that.” He still wasn’t quite comfortable with the fact that Granger was treating him—well, mostly—as if nothing negative had ever transpired between them. It was hard for him to believe that she wasn’t bitter. Instead, he actually found himself impressed. If she <em> was </em>feeling anything, she hid it as well as a Pureblood politician. And if she wasn’t feeling anything, it meant that she had recovered from the past far better than he had. Regardless, the fact that she seemed to be expressing genuine interest in his academic work was exciting. He was eager to discuss his more advanced work with anyone who would listen--which, as it so happens, wasn’t very many people. The moment he ever began eagerly discussing the polarities of potion substances, the elemental components of wolfsbane, the protonic behavior of wormwood, people had a tendency to gloss over. But not Granger. He let his arms relax. He felt his shields coming down already.</p><p>Granger locked up the office with a swish of her wand. “Do you have the key memorized?” she asked, repeating the motion she had used to unlock the door. Draco imitated the movement of her wand with his own and the office door clicked open before he locked it again. “Good,” she said, and turned back toward the classroom, leading him into the hallway. “I’d also love to discuss your findings in Cairo,” she said, locking the classroom door. “Oh, and your paper comparing ancient potions of Transylvania? Brilliant.” She sighed, turning to face him in the hallway. “<em>You </em>were chosen<em>, </em>Malfoy, because your accomplishments are unparalleled. When it comes right down to it: I trust your academics, and Harry trusts <em> you</em>. You have as much right to be here as anyone else.”</p><p>There was that <em> name </em> again. She couldn’t possibly be referring to Potter. But Potter was the only Harry that he knew. Draco moved to face Granger, positive that it expressed his confusion even in the dim torchlight of the hallway. “You mean Harry <em> Potter</em>?”</p><p>“Of course. You do...remember him?” Granger asked cautiously. Remember him? How the hell could anyone forget Harry bloody Potter? But more importantly--Potter <em> trusted </em> him? Since when did Potter <em> trust </em> him? And why was Granger discussing Potter as though he had any sway over executive decisions at Hogwarts? As if reading his mind, Granger added, “He <em> is </em>the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher here at Hogwarts, after all.”</p><p>Draco stared, certain that without a lifetime of pureblood etiquette dictating his every movement, his jaw would be hanging open. He couldn’t respond. His mouth had gone completely dry.</p><p>“You didn’t know?” Granger asked, her mouth narrowing into a concerned frown. He simply shook his head. The last he had heard, Potter had made Auror before going off and marrying the Weaslette. Head Auror, possibly. He purposely tried to avoid reading the papers whenever Potter was concerned.</p><p>“Oh dear. Well. He is currently away on business at the moment, but he is expected back in a few days. You have time to...prepare. Or...whatever it is you need to do.” She shifted uncomfortably and then let out an explosive sigh. "I'm sorry, Malfoy, but as it pertains to the welfare of this school I really must ask. Will you be...capable? Of working professionally in such close proximity to Harry?”</p><p>“Of course I will,” he said a little more snappily than he meant to, hoping that his voice sounded more confident than he felt.</p><p>Granger bit her lip and nodded a little nervously.</p><p>“What time did you say dinner was?”</p><p>“Seven o’clock. The faculty are meeting several minutes early to parade in as part of the opening ceremony. Meet us by the gargoyle?”</p><p>-</p><p>Once back in the safety of his rooms, Draco took a closer look at his surroundings. </p><p>He ran his eyes along the Slytherin-themed regalia on the walls, the green and gold rug that covered most of the room’s pale green marble tile, the carved golden swirls at the corners of the ceiling, the overstuffed green leather armchair by a cozy fireplace. Above the mantle, there was a wooden plaque on which shimmering green gems had been crafted into the shape of a snake. <em> Harry thought you might like them</em>. Draco collapsed onto his soft bed, rolling in a mountain of silken green pillows as he admired the the dark wooden bed posts carved into the shapes of coiling serpents and thick green bed curtains. <em> Harry thought you might like them</em>. Draco <em> did </em> like them, and that was the worst part. All of it was so luxurious and <em> clean</em>. Not a hint of sand or linen or a broken mattress spring. But why was Potter thinking about Draco’s rooms? About where he lives? About where he sleeps? It felt so personal, somehow. So intimate.</p><p><em> Harry trusts you</em>.</p><p>Why couldn’t he get those words out of his head? <em> Harry trusts you. </em> And why was the absent-minded Potter spending so much time thinking in great detail about the room that contained his <em> bed </em>? Malfoy rolled over and shoved his head into a pillow. He did not want to be thinking about Harry Potter.</p><p>The truth was, he already thought about Potter far more often than he would have liked. He often wondered how Potter was doing, but he refused to ever try and find out. He thought about those wonderful times he had grimaced at Potter, insulted Potter, tried to be better than Potter, disliked Potter, despised Potter, hated Potter, hated Potter, <em> hated </em> Potter. Yet, inevitably, he sometimes thought about how desperately he had wanted Potter to take his hand on the train when they first met. He thought about the way Potter adamantly defended his family at the trials, saying things like, “The Malfoys are innocent, and were simply swept up in events beyond their control.” Or when the prosecutor was questioning Potter about the murder of Albus Dumbledore with sly words, and Potter had interrupted him in a fury, saying, “You’re twisting the question, sir. Draco didn’t do anything wrong, nor was he going to. I know because I was there.” And the way Potter had looked at Draco--right at him--when he added, “Draco has a good heart. If he did anything that night, it was change the course of history and allow me to win the war.” And how it had made something in Draco melt a little. <em> A good heart</em>, Merlin. No one in the history of <em> ever </em> would dare suggest such a preposterous thing. Yet, leave it to Harry Potter to defy an entire courtroom and suggest that Draco Malfoy <em> has a good heart</em>. What rubbish. What sentimental, heart-melting rubbish.</p><p>...Sometimes Draco even thought about the way Potter used to peel his sweat-soaked uniform over his head in the changing room after a Quidditch match. ...The way his muscles would roll so beautifully along his shoulder blades and... Draco shook the thought from his head. Back to focusing on the hatred. The hatred of Potter.</p><p>Draco sighed. </p><p>He sank onto the bed and slid his hands down his face, trying to breathe. Eventually he would have to actually <em> face </em> Potter. He could face a train full of screaming children. He could face Granger, who had every reason to despise him. But somehow the thought of facing Potter was so much worse. So much harder. He hadn’t actually seen Potter since the trials, and even then they hadn’t spoken directly. Come to think of it, they hadn’t actually <em> spoken </em> to each other since...since the Fiendfyre, probably. Since the war. He owed Potter his life; he owed Potter everything, and yet it still felt wrapped up in a mess of bitter emotions that Draco had no desire to begin to analyze or untangle. What would he say to Potter when he saw him? What could he possibly say? He had been running since the war, and he <em> still </em> wasn’t ready to stop running and face Potter. “Ugh,” he groaned into his hands. “Pull yourself together, Malfoy.” Draco stood, washed his face in the sink, and then dabbed himself dry with a towel. Even the towels were green and delightfully soft. He looked up to find himself staring into a gold-framed mirror. He lifted his sharp chin from side to side as he studied the edges of his face--the masculine lines of his nose and jaw, the smooth hair held at the nape of his neck with green ribbon--making sure nothing looked out of place. “Be professional. This is business.” Just business, his mind repeated. “Right,” he muttered, a little disturbed that it sounded more like a question than a statement.</p><p>-</p><p>Draco stood by the gargoyle, tapping his foot while he waited for dinner to be announced. There was no sign of Granger, and none of the other professors had spoken a word to him. None of them even acknowledged his existence. He may as well have been the gargoyle. </p><p>As he stared at his watch, pretending to be enraptured by the time, his thoughts drifted to Cornelius Howe, as they often did when he felt completely alone. Cornelius had been one of his colleagues during a research expedition in Norway. He and Cornelius had shared a caravan located between the research base and the forest where they were doing their research. </p><p>From the moment Draco met Cornelius, he felt inexplicably angry in Cornelius’s presence. He respected the man’s knowledge of Norwegian flora, to be sure, but also thought he was a complete git. He hated the way Cornelius read his newspaper in the morning. He hated the way Cornelius would sit giggling at the kitchen table, writing gossip-rich editorials for <em> The Daily Prophet </em>. He hated the way Cornelius’ slender hips swayed as he moved about the caravan, and the way he always walked around the caravan after a shower with dripping wet hair and no shirt to speak of.</p><p>Thus, Draco purposely arranged his schedule to interact with Cornelius as little as possible. Draco would wake up before dawn just so he could mull about the caravan’s kitchen in solitude before marching into the forest alone to collect specimens. He would come back long after Cornelius had gone to sleep or, if Draco was feeling particularly exhausted, he would slip back to the caravan when Cornelius was at the research base in the evenings. </p><p>Of course, that all changed one morning when Draco accidentally had a bit of a lie-in, and came out to find Cornelius sitting at the small table near the kitchen, sipping coffee and reading his newspaper<em>. </em>Draco still remembered the way the sunlight seemed to shine only on Cornelius, on the way he mindlessly slid his top lip back and forth along the rim of the mug before taking a sip. He felt such an unexpected surge of attraction to Cornelius in that moment.</p><p>“Morning, Draco,” Cornelius had muttered without even looking up. “I’ve been meaning to talk to you about--” Draco had stumbled toward the door and out of the caravan as if Cornelius had come down with dragonpox. He ran into the forest without a morsel of breakfast and couldn’t even be bothered to care.</p><p>Draco didn’t <em> want </em> to be attracted to Cornelius. Draco didn’t have <em> time </em> to be attracted to Cornelius. He didn’t have the <em> patience </em> for emotional entanglements. Furthermore, it made Draco feel dangerously vulnerable. The last time he allowed himself to get attached to <em> friends</em>, one went and burned to death before his very eyes, and most of the others ended up in Azkaban. He couldn't deal with any more of that now; he was focusing on his career.</p><p>In the weeks that followed, if Draco couldn’t avoid Cornelius completely, he would be as unpleasant as possible. He would insult Cornelius’ taste in shampoo, insult his cooking, insult any little habit he could latch on to. Focusing on these annoyances helped him keep his attraction to Cornelius at bay. Focusing on Cornelius’ negative traits allowed Draco to <em> not </em>fall more madly in love with him than he already was.</p><p>And then it happened.</p><p>Draco had been in the middle of the forest one morning, crouched low and peacefully scraping frosted flora from the dirt floor in order to test its similarities to an ancient specimen of dried Frost Root, when a new and terrifying thought suddenly slammed into his brain. His thoughts often wandered while out doing fieldwork; there was always lots of contemplating and soul searching, that much was normal. But this particular thought? This was something else entirely. He had been reflecting on his feelings toward Cornelius, trying to make sense of the attraction, the anger, the insults. And, to his horror, it dawned on him that he had always felt that way about Harry Potter. Multiplied by one hundred.</p><p>He certainly hadn’t expected to have a life epiphany there, in the middle of nowhere in a Norwegian forest, and it quite literally dropped him on his ass. He fell back onto the dirt, staring at the trees with wide eyes and the new realization that maybe, just maybe, his feelings toward Potter had been more complex than simple hatred. That maybe he actually...<em> Merlin, </em> it was nauseating...had <em> feelings </em> for Potter. <em> Non-hateful feelings</em>. For the boy he was convinced he <em> despised </em>with every fiber of his being. That was like being hit by the fucking Hogwarts Express.</p><p>He wasn’t sure why, but something possessed him to drop everything he was doing in that instant and run back to the caravan. When he threw open the door, he saw Cornelius sitting at the kitchen table, blinking up at him in the sunlight. “Morning, Draco,” he said without looking up. “Forget something?”</p><p>Draco had marched across the room, stared at Cornelius for a moment over the edge of that damned newspaper, and then snogged him right then and there as if proving a point to himself. Well, he <em> was </em>proving a point. He had a theory and he was proving it. Luckily, Cornelius didn’t seem to mind. A few minutes later, flushed and feeling rather drunk as Draco returned to the forest, he realized that he still had dirt on his palms.</p><p>He and Cornelius dated for a few months. They were even happy for a while.</p><p>Eventually though, Cornelius discovered that Draco was a former Death Eater and it had all gone up in smoke. He didn’t even give Draco the courtesy of a break-up note. When Draco woke up after their first night together, the caravan was empty. Cornelius had taken his things and apparated to who-knows-where. Draco never saw him again.</p><p>That was why, Draco reminded himself, he didn’t <em>need </em>friends. That was why he should be perfectly content to stare at his watch as though it was the most fascinating thing in the world. That was why he stood a little straighter beside the gargoyle, trying to appear purposeful rather than rejected. </p><p>At any rate, this was exactly why he needed to do everything he could to put his past behind him, to rebuild his name. He <em> needed </em> to find the Fountain of Youth. This would change his career. This would change the entire Wizarding World. And maybe people would finally be able to look at him and think <em> Brilliant Potions Master </em> rather than <em> Death Eater. </em>He would play nice for as long as he needed to, until he was able to learn what he needed to learn, and then be free of the wretched place.</p><p>-</p><p>Draco sat at the head table in a daze. How strange it all was, seeing the world from the opposite side of this table. He looked out at all of the excited young faces, suddenly nostalgic for his own childhood. For that <em> confidence </em>, naive and misplaced though it may have been. It had been a long, long time since he had felt anything close to it. </p><p>Draco watched with grim amusement as the Sorting Hat chose students’ futures for them. Would things have been different if the hat had chosen a different house for him? Would his life had played out any differently if he had been surrounded by different friends, different influences? Draco supposed it didn’t matter. He was where he was and that was the end of it. He tried to memorize as many first years as he could, Slytherin or otherwise, before his brain stopped working and he felt a growing anticipation for the feast. His ears perked up, however, when the Sorting Hat shouted, “Lily Luna Potter!”</p><p>A <em> Potter</em>? Of course, <em> that’s </em>why the girl from the train looked familiar. Draco watched her walk toward the Sorting Hat. The Weasley hair, the Potter bone structure. It suddenly made sense. She was Potter-Weasel heathen spawn.</p><p>“Go Sis!” a dark-haired boy from the Gryffindor table called. <em> Two </em>Potters? Bloody hell, Potter and Female Weasley had been busy, hadn’t they? The real question was: had they shagged immediately after the war, or before? </p><p>“Gryffindor!” Called the sorting hat, after an unusually long deliberation.</p><p>Before the war, Draco decided, studying the Potter-Weasel boy as Lily Luna walked over to the Gryffindor table and gave him a high five. Definitely before. Oh, what a scandal. Draco almost regretted not picking up a newspaper to read all about Potter’s teenage lovechild and, most likely, consequent overhasty marriage. </p><p>Well, the war made everyone a little crazy. Everyone was convinced they were going to die anyway, probably Potter most of all. Frankly, Draco was surprised they hadn’t <em> all </em>been shagging. </p><p>...Well, there <em> was </em>that delightful fling with that Ravenclaw boy during the summer before sixth year. </p><p>...No. Best not think about that with children present.</p><p> Granger stood and gave the welcoming speech. The students were in complete awe of her, and even Draco had to concede that she held herself with enough grace and poise to seem superhuman. Ron Weasley sat at her right side. Judging by the way that Weasley, who was apparently the Quidditch coach--nevermind the nepotism there--beamed at Granger, Draco guessed that they were still happily married. A flash of their wedding bands in the candlelight confirmed it. Clearly Weasley was not as content with Draco’s presence as Granger was, if his furrowed orange eyebrows were any indication. Weasley had already attempted to murder Draco with his eyes several times, and dinner hadn’t even appeared yet. Weasley leaned forward to look disgustedly down the table at Malfoy for the upteenth time, as if he couldn’t even believe what he was seeing was real.</p><p>Draco had often eaten quite well in his travels, but nothing quite rivaled a Hogwarts meal. When the food appeared at his table, the first thing he reached for was a slice of shepherd’s pie. His fork sliced through the crust like air and it practically melted in his mouth. He swallowed it down with a full goblet of pumpkin juice. </p><p>In fact, Draco was still guzzling his pumpkin juice, staring blissfully at the starry ceiling, when the doors to the Great Hall slammed open. Malfoy nearly choked, and as he looked toward the door it took all of his good breeding to not spit pumpkin juice all over the table. There, standing silhouetted against the light of the hallway and looking more disheveled than ever, was Harry James Potter.</p>
