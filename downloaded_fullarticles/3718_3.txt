    <p align="center">After the War - Harem</p><p align="center">1</p><p>Harry, Hermione and Ron trudged to the portrait of the Fat Lady. When she saw them she swung forward and let them in without a password. They paused in the Common Room and sighed with relief. Gryffindor Tower was intact as far as they could tell. They trudged to the Bathroom and all three of them washed the grime and toil of the year from their bodies. When they were clean they headed up to their dorms and all three of them passed out and slept for a solid 12 hours.</p><p>About an hour later everyone else was sent up to seek sleep, as relief forces from Ally nations showed up to deal with the aftermath. The African Aurors showed up first and started to place white linen shrouds over the deceased. They brought all the dead Death Eaters to the same room as Riddle and gave the recommendation to Shacklebolt, the Interim Minister of Magic, to burn their bodies and scatter the ashes in the Thames. Kingsley arranged for it to happen. The captured Death Eaters were sent to Azkaban to await trial. The youngest of the Aurors, a young girl named Nila, escorted Kingsley to Gryffindor Tower, where he crashed for a few hours in Neville’s bed, as Neville, Seamus, and Dean were in the Hospital Wing getting injuries treated.</p><p>Nila then headed to the Hospital wing to make sure that it was secure and to see if the resident Healer needed help. Inside the wing were five youths, not much younger then herself. Three of them were being treated while two more were providing support. Nila eyes were drawn to the African colored male who was sitting beside an Irish red head whose face was beat up. She dove in and started treating him, earning a grateful look from the Healer. The wing was full of sleeping patients and in the back a huge cauldrons was mixing the potion for dreamless sleep.</p><p>They worked silently and eventually everyone was treated. Then the Healer spoke.</p><p>“Mr. Thomas, Miss Lovegood, you can return to your dorms; Miss Brown, Mr. Finnegan and Mr. Longbottom will remain here this evening.</p><p>Nila escorted both of them to the Gryffindor Tower, as it was the safest spot in the castle, and the most intact area as well. The African Aurors took the night watch allowing the Battle survivors time to rest. They were joined by a larger French contingent around noon, followed by Bulgarian in the early evening; when the castle started to stir again.</p><p>The new contingent started to work on getting the Great Hall and Entryway repaired and then they headed down to the kitchen to help the House Elves start cooking again. Breakfast was ready when everyone reentered the Hall. The only ones missing were the Golden Trio, and George Weasley told the family that they were eating in the Common Room. Kingsley and McGonagall overheard and headed up to talk with them. They were stopped by the trio as they came into the Great Hall. They sat in a corner and Kingsley headed back up to the Head Table and started to speak.</p><p>“Today, is a great day. Today is filled with the joy of victory, for the Dark Lord has perished!” HE declared in a loud voice; that carried to every corner of the Hall. “And yet, today is also a day of great sadness as we mourn those who have passed on, either in battle or by being in the wrong place at the wrong time.” His voice, was no more subdued. “Those who are no longer with us, will always be remembered. I have decided that if the Board of Governors agree; that two War Monuments will be erected near Dumbledore’s tomb. To that effect a group of Goblins are coming tomorrow to start the designs and look at what they can help us repair here in the castle. You are all free to stay as long as you wish while repairs are being made. The contingent of Aurors from Ally Nations will patrol the grounds and help keep us safe until the wards are redone.</p><p>“If you know of any who could help out with the cleaning or repairs that will be helpful today. Those who were seriously injured well be transferred to St. Mungo’s; a list of who is where will be posted on the Hospital Wing doors.” He paused for air and a drink of water. “Go on about your lives without fear for the darkness is behind us.” He finished and headed back to his seat. He had watched the trio move to sit with the rest of the Weasleys.</p><p>He focused on doing his job and waiting until the Goblins showed up. They did just as the sun finished setting. They were led by two female witches; one blonde and one brunette. The blonde broke off and headed to the table next to the Weasleys, where she greeted Lee Jordan. The brunette and the Goblins came up to the table. The witch nodded at both him and Minerva.</p><p>“We’re here to help.” She said simply before moving aside so one of the Goblins could speak.</p><p>“You’re addressing Balok.” His voice was dour, and both the elder magic wielders knew that this was the leader. “We are here to help with the monument and the repairs to the castle.” He started.</p><p>“What can you do to help with the repairs?” Kingsley asked, confused. The witch jumped back in when she saw that Balok was about to make a very rude comment to the interim Minister of Magic.</p><p>“The castle was built by a combination and collaboration between Wizards and Goblins. That and they also have the original blueprints to the castle.” She told them her Irish baroque charming to the listeners and helped calm the Goblin down.</p><p>“What she says is true. To that effect half of the Goblins will conduct a castle wide survey to assess the damage. The other half will head out to the grounds and start the plans for the war monument.” Balok spoke again.</p><p>“Very well.” Professor McGonagall spoke as she stood up. The goblins looked to her. “I will take the group around the castle to insure that they are allowed access anywhere they need.” She announced and led half of the Goblins out of the Great Hall. The rest of the group included Balok, and they remained until the others were out of sight.</p><p>“My group will head outside to Professor Dumbledore’s Tomb and start working.” HE told Kingsley and he started to led the rest of the Goblins out to the grounds. The witch remained. Kingsley looked at her with a raised eyebrow.</p><p>“I just came with them.” She grinned and then turned and whistled. The blonde who came in with her came up to them.</p><p>“Minister, my name is Morgan and this is Jess.” She introduced. “Jess had a crucial job to help the Order. She was in charge of scrambling the stations and setting the password charms for Potterwatch.” Morgan told him and he smiled, remembering the woman. She could be seen at the very beginning and end of the broadcasts. “She came to help me.” She continued and Kingsley turned back to her.</p><p>“And what is your job?” He asked in his deep soothing voice.</p><p>“I used to be a Curse Breaker, but this morning Gringotts created a new office: Gringotts’ Office of Inheritance. The office is what is says, I’m in charge of assuring every one of their proper inheritance and insure that Wills and Last Testaments are read properly. I’m here to ascertain rights of Conquests with the dead Death Eaters.” She said.</p><p>“The Bodies are scheduled to be burned before the next Sunrise.” Kingsley told her.</p><p>“Then I have to work fast. Here’s what I’ll do: I’ll take a body, get the name of the deceased; and the killer of the Death Eater then change the shroud to a different color. The ones that are the different color and done and can be taken to the burn site.” She told him thinking; her head cocked to the side.</p><p>“Deal.” Kingsley said. And the two witches got to work. They finished half of bodies when the workers came to take them to the pyre. They started to take the finished bodies and the two girls carried on with grim determination. This was a part of the job that Morgan was hoping that she would never have to do again. She sent all the paperwork back to her office to start the long process of weeding through Wills and other forms of paperwork. Jess headed back to the Great Hall an hour before Morgan did.</p><p>Morgan needed some fresh air and headed outside and saw the Goblins at work. They had apparently agreed to one design and had now started to finalize the plans. She sighed with relief as the thoughts of death vanished with the slight breeze in the morning air.</p><p>“Well if it isn’t Morgan Hadley, as I live and breathe.” A voice sounded from the direction of the Quidditch Pitch. She turned and smiled at the sight before her.</p><p>“Charlie Weasley, back from playing with Dragons.” She said raising her eyebrow at her former boyfriend.</p><p>“Yeah kid, got called over Easter said they needed more fighters over here, and I wanted to be near my family.” He joked and sat next to her on the Entrance steps.</p><p>“’Kid’! I am more grown up then you, Charlie Weasley.” She told him.</p><p> “Oh yeah, how did you do that?” He teased her nudging her shoulder with his own.</p><p>“By becoming a wife and mother.” She said a bittersweet smile on her face.</p><p>Charlie’s smile fell from his face as he found a small silver band on her wedding finger. HE didn’t notice that it was a Widow’s Band.</p><p>“Who’s the lucky guy?” He asked.</p><p>“His name was Marius.” She said her eyes welling up with tears. Charlie cottoned on to the fact that something was wrong with the tears and her use of the past tense.</p><p>“’Was’?” HE asked, his voice serious and soft instead of the loud, teasing it had been.</p><p>“He was an Auror. He died trying to stop the take over last summer.” She told him, and he looked back at her ring and noticed it was a Widow’s Band.</p><p>“Is it inappropriate for a former flame to give you a hug?” He asked in a softer voice. She smiled at him and leaned into his embrace.</p><p>“How many children do you have?” He asked remembering that she said she was a mother. That brought a soft, happy smile to her face.</p><p>“One, a daughter. We named her Charis.” She said and fished out a pictured of a small red-head with blue eyes.</p><p>“Classic Irish there Morgan.” He laughed, pointing out her red hair and blue eyes. And She smiled before putting the photo away.</p><p>“That she is, and she knows it.” Morgan laughed.</p><p>“Where is she?” Charlie asked, though he couldn’t help but think that the little girl could be his daughter with her red hair. But that was impossible, he hasn’t seen her for over seven years and the little girl looked to be five years old.</p><p>“With Cassie, in America. I sent her there when the Ministry fell. I had to stay here and help get Muggle-borns out or hide them.” She said.</p><p>“When I got word of the end of the war I sent for both Cassie and Charis.” She said.</p><p>“Cassie’s your sister right?” Charlie asked; his arm still around her shoulders.</p><p>“Yeah, my mother adopted her. She’s the same age as your youngest brother, I think.” Morgan told him.</p><p>Before he could speak again, her stomach growled and he laughed. “Come on lets go get food.”</p><p>She grinned and stood up. He led her to the Great Hall and they sat down and started to eat.</p><p>Jesse stayed behind to help more with the repairs and Morgan returned to the building she was using as her office and started to work on everything.</p><p>Conquest rights were easy to sort out and get all squared away. She would wait until after the week long series of funerals and the memorial to summon everyone. She got the master letter written and made 15 copies of the letter before adding the personal information in.</p><p>Next she turned the fifty some who died in the final battle and everyone else who perished during the war and started to figure out who needed to be there when the wills were read. This task took longer and she had the letters made individually and they sat waiting for the same time as the conquest letters. She next filed those in her ‘to do’ box and turned to her inbox. There were a couple memos regarding hiring that she needed to do and her vote for who would take over the Head of Curse-breaking department as the previous Head had just resigned after the Dragon fiasco. After that was a folder with the label: <em>Incomplete Inheritance.</em> There were 7 wills in this folder for 6 individuals.</p><p>She went through the individuals and saw that they had only received the physical, the monetary, portion of their inheritance and nothing else. So she made new letters that were sent out immediately for those six individuals. She turned to the final wills, that were both for Harry Potter and found that they had the same problem.</p><p>Morgan grew curious and started to compile everything for Harry’s full inheritance. She of course started to trace the Potter line as far back as she could and made a shocking discovery. She confirmed it by have a goblin at the bank check it and it was soon confirmed. Now Morgan had more paperwork to complete with this new discovery.</p><p>She finished that and decided to return to the castle and help out there. Her back was aching from sitting for the past few hours.</p><p>She again sat next to Charlie who introduced to everyone at the table including the Golden Trio. She greeted everyone and watched Mrs. Weasley and Bill exchange looks with Charlie. The meal was pleasant and everyone enjoyed the love the floated around the table.</p><p>When the meal was finished Morgan used the floo to contact her sister and tell her to come home and to bring Charis with her. The message was encoded with a code that her sister created so she would know that it was real and not a trap.</p><p>Hopefully the future could be peaceful for a generation.</p>
