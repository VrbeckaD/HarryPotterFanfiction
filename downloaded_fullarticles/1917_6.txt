    <p>Remus approached Professor McGonagall with a wary smile on his face. She stepped in line with him as he went up the steps towards the Great Hall and began speaking as they turned down a corridor towards his classroom.</p>
<p><br/> "Welcome back, Lupin," she began, sending a glance towards her companion. He saw her eyes briefly trace the scars on his face and remembered too late that they had not been there when she saw him last.</p>
<p><br/> "It's a pleasure to be back, after all these years," he replied, hoping the purposefully light tone of voice would distract her. "I'm thankful to the headmaster for allowing me to take the position."</p>
<p><br/> "You say that as if you expected Dumbledore to turn you away. Haven't you learned anything about him, Lupin?" Her tone of voice was not unkind, and he knew she wanted him to doubt himself less. Twelve years of lonely full moons and almost no job offers had set him pretty well in his ways, however. He knew that a teaching job was generally out of reach for... someone with his condition, and he refused to let himself become too comfortable.</p>
<p><br/> "Professor-" he started, before the job of changing the subject was dealt with by her.</p>
<p><br/> "You needn't stand by that old formality, Lupin. I am no longer your teacher and you may call me Minerva as everyone else does."</p>
<p><br/> He smiled with relief at the change in topic. "I shall call you Minerva if you begin to call me Remus, instead of Mr. Lupin. I'd prefer to have as few reminders as possible of the many times I heard you follow that name with a pronouncement of detention." He gave her an amused and rueful glance, and hefted his suitcase into a more comfortable position as they climbed another flight of stairs.</p>
<p><br/> "Most of the time, you deserved it," she commented.</p>
<p><br/> "Only most of the time?"</p>
<p><br/> "I have a feeling some of those detentions were what you considered a noble sacrifice," she replied, her tone only slightly sarcastic.</p>
<p><br/> "Ah. You knew I covered for them, did you? I felt I owed it to them, what with everything they'd done for me. And with the way Sirius was treated at home-" He cut the thought off abruptly and drew in a breath. He had almost forgotten that his old friend was a murderer on the run. Professor McGonagall turned and gave him a look that would be described by some as pity.</p>
<p><br/> "I'm sorry. I shouldn't have reminded you." She put a hand out and patted his shoulder. He forced a smile back onto his face.</p>
<p><br/> "I'm alright," he said bracingly.</p>
<p><br/> "I still wonder where we went wrong with that boy... He was never exactly a rule follower but he never showed any inclination to the Dark Arts. Not like his family, anyway." She mused, almost to herself, as they continued up the stairs.</p>
<p><br/> Despite his answer of 'alright', Remus had had enough of this topic also, and replied, "Speaking of the Dark Arts, I assume I'll have the same old classroom?"</p>
<p><br/> She answered without looking back at him, but nodded. "Not much has changed since you left, Remus. You'll find the classrooms much as you left them. You have changed far more than this school has."</p>
<p><br/> He thought, for a fleeting moment, that he had now detected weariness in her voice - and he shook his head in mock disbelief. "You sound almost as if you want a change, Minerva. How unlike you."</p>
<p><br/> "Contrary to popular belief, Remus, I am sometimes prone to human failings. Life here is always either monotonous or a battle of life and death, and I happen to prefer neither." Her voice had no bitterness, however, and as she looked back at her former student she let slip a fully fledged smile.</p>
<p><br/> "And here we are. I apologize for being so downcast on your first day, I hope you'll forgive me. You should find everything in the classroom in order, let me or any other staff know if you're missing anything."</p>
<p><br/> They had stopped outside the DADA classroom, and he moved to enter it, but he felt her hand grip his shoulder once more. He turned, surprised to see her looking at him with the most affection he had seen in a long time, from anyone. She didn't let go of his shoulder. "Welcome back home, Remus. I've missed you, my boy."</p>
