  <strong>Fate, Time, Magic, And Atlantis</strong>
</p><p align="center">Â </p><p>Long, long time ago, eons ago before all the universes, There were three women who were bored. Very bored. Well, more like 'being' but later humankind would describe them as female, so let's just say 'woman'. They knew Something was going to happen but didn't know what it was. They were just there, waiting and waiting and waiting.</p><p>Fate felt a pull so she waved it away with her hand, irritated.<br/>
Then, a big explosion happened.<br/>
Time started to feel something so she let that feeling flow through her.<br/>
Few moments later, smaller but still big explosions went off.<br/>
A dot began to expand and each one grew into a small universe.<br/>
Three women watched them happen.<br/>
each universe was unique in one way and Magic, tired of waiting around, just walked into a world.<br/>
Two women watched her go. Fate was scowling but didn't say anything.<br/>
Time made worlds flow forward and expand, and Fate shaped the way.<br/>
Magic, inside one of the smaller universe, moved along the time and fate but rather differently. Time and Fate were nature, hence natural. However Magic was, well, magical.</p><p>So each universe bloomed and slowly matured. Thus laid the problem. Two worlds were close. Close enough to share a particular place called Atlantis later. One of the world had magic, and it started to flow into the overlapped area. Magic tentively reached out shared some of its power and everything started to flourish. Magic infused with everything: earth, plants, animals, humans... Nothing was the same. Beneath the earth, ley line appeared. Magical beasts roamed. Creatures such as Goblins. Werewolves, Vampires came into existence. Human could wield the magic to some degree.</p><p>Humans and Creatures started to gather and form a community. A big council was set and the land was called Atlantis. They started to do productive work together. Many different branch of magic were practiced. Society thrived and population increased. Atlantis was no longer enough. People moved out and started colonies. Each guild of magic practicers had their own colonies. Humans without magic didn't understand their powers and magicals were viewed as Royals, Shaman, or even gods and demigods. No one commented about how Magical being spread those rumors in the first place.</p><p>Magic was very, very satisfied. She liked the notion of being a creator of sorts.</p><p>Sadly every good things must come to an end. Fate and Time intervened. Two worlds were bigger and much more developed. It was time to break off from each other.</p><p>Atlantis never survived the separation. It exploded. Only colonies remained, but without the other guilds to support the colonies, known as cradle of civilization, withered away. Magic originally concentrated on Atlantis spread around the Earth. Earth slowly embraced magic as part of nature.</p><p>Time and Fate may have been satisfied but Magic certainly wasn't. She was very petulant and sour with their work. Hence, she did something to spite other deities: She created something that can defy order and time. She breathe life into a Time Traveler.</p>
