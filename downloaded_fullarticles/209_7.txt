  <strong>Prologue:</strong>
</p><p align="center">The passage of time was never changing, or a least she thought it was. It was always said that bad things happened to those who meddled with time. People always told her there was no way to change time or events that had already passed. She hadn't ever believed it, especially after going back in time in her third year to save her Godfather. They had stopped Buckbeak's execution and they had saved Sirius's life and nothing had ever happened to them, she had just never had a change to pursue if what was said about time was true. </p><p align="center">The one thing Hari Potter had never understood was why Dumbledore had allowed her to save Sirius if he was just going to force him away from her and then arranged his death in her fifth year. She had never realized that the Black's took family vows to never kill, maim or harm each other when they became old enough to start Hogwarts until it was to late. It was why Sirius had never harm Bellatrix during the First War. It was only after the final battle that Hari had realized what had happened. It had been Dumbledore who had sent the spell as Sirius. The one that send the only man she had ever trusted falling back into the Veil of Death. </p><p align="center">Dumbledore had raised her as a lamb for slaughter and had then arranged for her 'friends' to claim her a rising Dark Lady after the war was finished if she survived. The Old Coot had even faked his own death with the help of Severus Snape and had come out of hiding to attack her the day after the Final Battle. Only five people had stood at her side when it happened. Bill Weasley, a injured Fred, who had only escaped the battle by a hairs breath when Hari had thrown a shield up around them, George Weasley, Luna Lovegood and Neville Longbottom. Everyone else had betrayed her, saying that it must have been dark magic that defeated Tom Riddle. </p><p align="center">The ever fickle Wizarding World believed them.</p><p align="center">So began the hunt for the Girl-Who-Lived, Woman-Who-Conquered, Mistress of Death and Savior of the Wizarding World. She had escaped their first assault against her, only because of Fred and George's instant darkness powder. Dobby, who had survived the raid from Malfoy Manor, instantly took her into hiding in her family manor, which she had had no idea existed, and they placed up a fidelius charm. It was then all the truth came out. </p><p align="center">Albus Dumbledore had arranged everything.</p><p align="center">He allowed Severus Snape to hear part of the prophecy and reported it to Voldemort. He arranged for James and Lily Potter to die that horrible Halloween night. He made sure Frank and Alice Longbottom were taken care of and that Sirius Black ended up in Azkaban. He made sure Hari was placed in an abusive household and that Neville would struggle to succeed in life. For he would be needed if Vernon Dursley ever killed his precious pawn in a rage. He made sure that Remus couldn't find, write of visit her. Dumbledore tested her every year, slowly beating it into her that she was responsible to do anything to save the world, including give her own life. He even arranged for two people to spy on her in the form of 'friends' and watch for 'dark' behavior. </p><p align="center">Hari felt stupid thinking about it after the betrayal.</p><p align="center">What kind of teachers would never report her abuse like what happened at primary school and Dudley's behavior while at school? What witch walked through Kings Cross shouting about muggles? What healer ignored previously broken bones, malnutrition and neglect? What teacher praised three eleven years old for going after a dark wizard and almost getting killed? Or never figured out it was a basilisk petrifying students when a twelve year old did? Who would send two emotionally traumatized students back in time and not just calling for a trial as Chief Warlock? What was the Headmaster thinking when he allowed a fourteen year old to participate in a tournament with students three times older than her? Or how he sent her back to an abusive household after she witnessed the death of Cedric Diggory instead of to a mind healer? How about when she started having visions about Voldemort and instead of telling her what they were, she was just sent to be mind raped continually by Snape, which just opened her mind more to the Dark Lord? Sirius dead because of it, Voldemort outted to the press and then back to the Dursley's. No one believed her about Draco Malfoy being a Death Eater, so look what happened. Dumbledore 'dead' on Voldemorts orders, Death Eaters in the school, the war began anew. </p><p align="center">If any of those things had changed, then the war would have been much different. Hari had never been a stupid child but looking back on her past, she felt it. Why had she never questioned Dumbledore? Why had she allowed Ron and Hermione to plan her life for her? Why had she stopped trying her best?</p><p align="center">Hari had so many questions and no ways to answer them. </p><p align="center">Two years after she had gone into hiding, Bill was killed being forced to give up to secret to her location. Potter Manor had been raided by the surviving Order of the Phoenix members and then burned to the ground when Hari had gotten away. A year later Fred and George died as they fought to make sure she got away from her next hiding spot, a small cottage they had purchased in France. Andy had taken her in afterwards for six months and then Dumbledore had killed her to get Hari's location. Hari had taken her godson Teddy and run, ending up in hiding at Grimmauld place. Kreature was killed apparating her and Teddy away to Luna and Neville, who had gotten married after the war, a year later. They were able to get them into a safe hiding place.</p><p align="center">They were moved to Bulgaria to be hidden by Viktor Krum, a year later they were moved to Germany to Newt Scamander. A year after that they were moved to a small cottage in Scotland, which was found and raised six months into their lives there. Hari was injured and Teddy almost killed before Dobby arrived to save the day. They were transferred to a safe house in Italy with Blaise Zabini, where Hari fell in love. Only a year later, right before their marriage, Blaise was killed by Hermione when she learned the man was connected to the Girl-Who-Lived. In her grief, Hari killed the muggleborn witch and then went back into hiding with Teddy in Russia, where they lived for three years before they were found by Ginny, who was there playing Quidditch with the Holy Head Harpies. </p><p align="center">Finally done with it all, Hari returned to London with an eleven-year-old Teddy Lupin in 2010 and that was where she was currently. She was standing in front of her old home at Number 4 Private Drive, Little Whinning, Surry and battling against surviving Order Members and Dumbledore himself. Teddy was crouched behind her, hair white as milk in his fear and wand sending simple spells at the people who got to close to her back. Hari was no longer the stupid and naive witch she had been at seventeen. Now at twenty-nine years old and having been emerged into many other magical cultures in other countries, she was stronger than she had ever been. Standing protectively in front of her godson, dressed in basilisk skin armor, harvested by Dobby from the Chamber of Secrets, red hair crackling around her as her magic pulsed, green eyes glowing the sickly color of the killing curse and wielding the Elder Wand, the Death Stick, a Deathly Hallow, she was the stunning picture of the Savior she has always been called. </p><p align="center">As she dueled against Dumbledore, McGonagall and Kingsley, she reflected sadly on the history of the Black family as she was hit with a longing for her Godfather. Sirius never would have allowed anyone to claim her a rising Dark Lady or to hurt her. She remembered reading about the Black family. Orion was killed by suspicious means, a sickness, Walburga went crazy and died of a heart attack, Regulas was killed by Voldemort, Sirius by Dumbledore, Bellatrix by Molly Weasley, Nymphadora during the war, Narcissa by Dumbledore when looking for Hari, Andromeda for the same thing and Orion's sister Lucretia was killed in the beginning of the First War by Death Eaters. Hari and Teddy were the only Black's left.</p><p align="center">When she deflected an exploding curse towards the house and it shattered the glass windows, she was hit with a sudden feeling of unfairness. The wizarding world was fickle and she was done, if her and Teddy were dead, at least they would no longer be running. Running was no life for her godson/son, the boy she had been trying to raise the best she could while being on the run. She felt his hand on her elbow and she looked down into the identical eyes to her and saw nothing but love and understanding. </p><p align="center">"I'm sorry Teddy," she cried out as she sent a powerful bombarda back at the three fighting magicals, causing the ground to explode beneath their feet and send them flying.</p><p align="center">He smiled at her, the same smile Moony used to give her and she felt her heart clench with longing, "It's okay mum," he reassured her as he lowered his wand and wrapped an arm around her waist, holding her tightly as his heart pounded in his chest. "I wanted better for you," she whimpered as sweat fell down her cheek and she shifted to raise a shield over them, deflecting two exploding curses and a spell to disarm her of her want. Fire falling around them on the ground as it sparked off her ward shield, something she had learnt from Blaise. Teddy hugged her tight, "I had you," he whispered into her chest, meaning every word her said. Their life hadn't been easy but Hari had always been there for Teddy. She had never tried to take the place of his parents, never tried to make him forget them. On the contrary, she tried her best to make sure their memory lived on for him. He knew everything about her years at Hogwarts, what happened during the war and many secrets Hari had never shared with anyone else. To him, Harry was his mum. She had been there all his life and never once had she ever left him or made him think she didn't want him. He knew how hard it had been to be on the run with a young child. As he stood pressed against her side and holding to her tightly, defeat was flooding him. He was tired of running, he just wanted to be with his parents and Hari. He was tired of the paranoia they lived by, Constant Vigilance got tiring.</p><p align="center">Tears leaked down Hari's cheeks as she wrapped an arm around him and saw the matching defeat in his eyes. In that moment Teddy reminded her heavily of her godfather and the haunted, defeated expression he had warn every time they had to leave him alone in Grimmauld Place. She felt her magic begin to give, after hours of fighting and trying to protect Teddy at the same time, Hari was exhausted and her magic was finally beginning to falter. She tightened her hold on her son, a child stuck in the middle of a battle that was not his fault, "Don't let me go Teddy, your not alone," she said firmly, knowing she was weakening, her shield was beginning to look like a shattered mirror. She wouldn't be able to fight much longer. Teddy squeezed her so tight she lost her breath, but she was holding onto him just as well. "I love you mum," he cried as she wrapped both arms around him, her shield broke at the same time she wrapped both her arms around him and buried her head in his hair, inhaling the unique scent that was all Teddy. </p><p align="center">Hari never realized at the same moment she was ready to give up and had accepted her death at the hands of the Killing Curse for the third time, the deity Death, who had long watched over her, stepped into her path of fate. As the green light of the Killing Curse sped towards woman and child, he slowed time and stepped into its path, just as he had done so many years before when he saved Hari Potter from Tom Riddle the first time. Lily Potter had willingly come to him, just like Ignotus Peverell had done eons before, just to protect her child, the last of the Peverell line, the only one capable of holding his Hallows and becoming the Master of Death, or in her case Mistress. It was the reason that Hari Potter had survived that night in 1981. His long black cloak swirled around him as he moved over to her and stopped in front of his Mistress. She had been through hell and back he knew, so he didn't blame her for her wish.</p><p align="center">To save Sirius Black and the rest of the Black family.</p><p align="center">A creepy wide grin covered his skeletal face, rotten teeth peeking out as he reached out and touched the warm cheek of the Woman-Who-Conquered. Her eyes briefly flickered as he knew she could sense his presence, she was <em>his</em> Mistress after all, and then he pulled away and brought his scythe down on the ground, ice sprawling across the ground as cold filled the air, "Very well Mistress, enjoy your fresh start," he said before the blade started glowing a bright with color and he vanished with a demented cackle ringing through the air.</p><p align="center">Hair sensed the cold presence of Death and thought for sure her time had come but before she could look up, a bright white light, feeling cold and familiar wrapped around her and with a jerk beneath her navel, she and Teddy vanished in a bright flash. Just seconds later, the green of the killing curse sailed passed where they had been standing seconds before and only confusion was left behind as the Order looked for the bodies of woman and child. Only there was no trace of either. </p><hr/><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">In 1972, thirty-eight years in the past, in a bright flash of white light and ice, woman and child were dropped unconscious onto the floor in the Directors office of Gringotts Bank. Both bearing a family resemblance, beaten and bloodied and both clearly from a different time, the magic of time travel surrounding them unmistakeable. </p><p align="center">Hari Potter had gotten her wish. She had been returned to just before Tom Riddle gained power the first time and before a single Black had been killed in his quest for power. Death had also dropped her into the perfect place to gain allies, after all, who better than those Purebloods thought beneath them, to help her in her quest to save the Wizarding World. The Goblins had no idea of the boon that had been dropped into their laps, at least not yet, but they would soon.</p><p align="center">In the Forbidden Forest, Firenze and Bane looked up into the sky, "Mars is bright tonight," the latter remarked.</p><p align="center">The former looked up and a slight smile crossed his face, "She has come at last," he agreed quietly before they took off with the rest of the hunting patrol.</p><p align="center">In the Headmasters office of Hogwart's School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Fawkes the Phoenix woke with a start and a pleased trill rushed through him as he felt the highly magical presence arrive. He trilled lightly in a pleased sound, shocking Albus Dumbledore, who had been watching the shocked Phoenix who had been fuming for the last few weeks because of the magical restraints Albus had placed on him and who had not moved from his spot since, his quiet form of defiance.</p><p align="center">The most shocking thing of all was that for the first time since the Hogwart's Founders heirs had walked her halls, Hogwart's woke up. The ancient castle had once been sentient and had protected the children in her halls viciously, had fallen asleep when the Founders heirs had stopped communicating with her. Even when young Tom Riddle had walked her halls, he had never communicated with her. Now as she woke, she felt the overwelming, powerful presence of a Hogwart's Heir, one practically bursting with magic that was partially locked of two different lines. Weak from only just woken, she could not help her heir but she could make sure no one else could harm them. Instantly, the wards locked down across the grounds, stopping anyone from going to investigate the magical disturbance and inside the headmaster's office, the Sorting Hat cackled with glee as he felt his old friend awake for the first time in centuries. He knew life was going to get interesting. </p><p align="center">Inside Gringott's, Hari and Teddy had been moved to the Hospital wing. Healers working on mother and child. Director of the bank Ragnok, stood to the side seething as Healer's cursed in Gobblegook about the damage to both humans. Learning that the girl had once carried a hocrux had his head reeling and he felt something inside of the magic in the air shift. All around him, the other goblins felt and watched as an ancient magic began surrounding the girl. Ragnok felt his breath catch as a symbol appeared above her body. It was a triangle, a circle in the center and a line slashed right through. Anyone who had ever worked in Gringott's knew that symbol. It was that of the Peverall's, an ancient family. One of the sacred Twenty-eight and a line long thought dead. As the healers rushed to break magical blocks, flush potions and heal injuried, Death watched from beyond the veil and cackled to himself, pleased with his little trick.</p><p align="center">Hari Potter had another fight and destiny ahead of her.</p><p align="center">Death hoped she was ready for it.</p><p align="center">It wasn't everyday your dreams came true.</p>
