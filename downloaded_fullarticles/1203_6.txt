    <p>When James Potter bumped into Lily Evans at his local supermarket, he couldn't believe his own two eyes. He had never seen such a beautiful person, and as he stuttered a hello, she smiled warmly.</p><p><br/>
"I'm Lily," She said, putting her hand out toward him.</p><p><br/>
All James could focus on was her auburn hair, and how she pushed it behind her ear. "Oh, yeah, first time seeing a ginger?"</p><p><br/>
James quickly shook his head and looked at his feet, then back up at her, a small grin and blush creeping onto his face. "No, no, sorry, I was just admiring your hair," He coughed awkwardly and ran a hand through his hair, before extending it and feeling her hand slide into his. It fit perfectly, like two puzzle pieces touching for the first time and finding out that they are a perfect match. Her hand lingered too long, and she blushed and looked down at the groceries James had dropped when bumping into her.</p><p><br/>
"Oh, let me," She said, and kneeled down. She started picking the vegetables up, holding them in her arms. She looked up at James, who was fumbling with the hem of his shirt. "So, what do you do for a living, since you need this many vegetables?"</p><p><br/>
James couldn't help but smile, and his hand went directly to his hair again. A nervous tick, as his brother Sirius would say. "Well, you're standing in my workspace," Lily looked suprised up at him, "I just got off. And I also work down at the Witch's Brew," James pointed his thumb in the general direction of the caf√©. Lily nodded, "So, why all the vegetables?"</p><p><br/>
James winked at her, "Research,"</p><p><br/>
Lily laughed, and didn't know why, but she also didn't care. She stood up tall and put the vegetables in her basket. "Well, I need some cereal,"</p><p><br/>
"Right this way," James led her to the cereal aisle. He gestured toward the different cereals, "We have flakes, hoops and, excuse me, balls!" At that last one, they earned a stern look from a nearby elderly lady. "I said 'excuse me', Mrs. Hartridge," The lady turned away from them and walked on down the aisle, shaking her head disapprovingly.</p><p><br/>
James turned to look at Lily, a broad smile on his face. She returned the smile and added a blush. "You're very creative,"</p><p><br/>
"Some might call that same creativity stupidity, but I try to ignore the haters," He leaned against the shelves.</p><p><br/>
Lily shook her head, looking downward, and then turned her attention toward the cereal. "Give me some balls!"</p><p><br/>
"Oh my God, you did not just say that," James said in a hushed voice. "What kind of ball? We've got expensive chocolate and, oh guess what, cheap chocolate."</p><p><br/>
"I'll have to go with the expensive. Remus'll know the difference,"</p><p><br/>
James raised a brow and tried not to sound disappointed, as he reached for the cereal, and handing it to Lily. "Is that a boyfriend?"</p><p><br/>
Lily laughed loudly, "Oh God no, he's my best friend, we work together at the children's hospital," She put the cereal in her basket. "What about you, do you have a girlfriend?"</p><p><br/>
James shook his head, and they continued down the aisle, entering the bread aisle. "Is there anything else you need for this Remus person?"</p><p><br/>
Lily looked into her basket, then shook her head, concluding that she had it all. They went to the cashier, James' vegetables up first followed by Lily's essentials for the weekend. James paid, a smile tugging at his mouth. When Lily had paid they stood face to face at the exit.</p><p><br/>
"My shift's at 10 till 15, down at the brew, tomorrow," James reached up and scratched the back of his head. "I mean, if you were wondering,"</p><p><br/>
"Well, I can always drink some tea," She said and struggled carrying the bags, and James noticed the subtleness of a bruise on her wrist. He reached over and took the bag from her bruised hand. "I can follow you to your car-"</p><p><br/>
"I don't have one," She said.</p><p><br/>
"To your bike then?"</p><p><br/>
"Nope,"</p><p><br/>
James sighed and looked to the sky, "When I actually try to help a pretty girl for once..." He muttered.</p><p><br/>
Lily giggled and tucked a strand of hair behind her ear. "You may walk me to my flat, but no funny business!"</p><p><br/>
James' face lit up and they started walking down the street.</p><p><br/>
The walk was quite awkward, as is expected, and Lily tried not to look at the handsome stranger next to her. It was as if her eyes kept darting back to him. His jet-black hair, accompanied by those big brown eyes and his dark complexion, made him seem mysterious, but those glasses made him the exact opposite: he was goofy.</p><p><br/>
As they neared her building, she felt the need to come up with something to say, even though the silence was very comfortable. "You never told me your name,"</p><p><br/>
"Oh, sorry, I'm James," He said and smiled down at her.</p><p><br/>
"Hi James," She started taking her keys out of her bag. "Right here," They rounded the corner and stood in front of her front door. She put the bag down and took the key out, putting it in the keyhole.</p><p><br/>
"Well, you'll have to come down to the brew one day," James said, casually leaning against the wall.</p><p><br/>
"Only if you'll be there," She tried not to look at him, but when she did he looked surprised and happy. "I will personally bring you your cherry tea with a hint of vanilla,"</p><p><br/>
She laughed, "How do you know I'll want to order that?"</p><p><br/>
"Well, excuse me, I have known you for about half an hour, and tea is my thing, also this tea is amazing. It's my mom's secret blend," He went after her through the front door. Her flat was very cozy and tidy.</p><p><br/>
"Bags on the counter," She pointed toward the kitchen counter, and James placed the bag on top. "Well, I better get going. My brother is expecting me,"</p><p><br/>
"Oh really? I was hoping you'd tell me some more about your tea fetisch?" She grinned widely, and in a goofy way, which made James believe she could make anything funny.</p><p><br/>
"We'll have to do that tomorrow then," James said.</p><p><br/>
"Right, two seconds," She went around the counter to the fridge and took a sticky note and a pen. She returned and handed it to James. "You should write your number here so I know who to call if I won't be able to show up due to work or something,"</p><p><br/>
James nodded, "Sounds reasonable," He scribbled out his number and a smiley, then pulled the sticky note off the notepad. He reached his hand out and stuck it to her forehead, a teasing smile playing his lips. She took the pen from his hand and scribbled her number onto a note as well, and stuck it to his chest. She lingered a second too long. "Be on your way, sir, and I will see you tomorrow,"</p><p><br/>
James shook his head, looking down at the note stuck to his chest. "This will be great, Lily," And he walked out of the flat. Lily took the note off of her forehead and studied it; the slight cursive of his t's made her think of his messy curls, and the little smiley-face made her think of his smug grin.</p><p><br/>
James took the note from his chest and inspected it; her name was written in perfect cursive, and the heart above her 'i' made his heart flutter. He went home with a bounce in each step.</p>
