    <p>“You can’t give detentions anymore, Malfoy, we’re not in school and you’re not Head Boy.”<br/>
<br/>
“All right then,” Malfoy said, lowering his voice and leaning in. “I’ll settle for a spanking.”<br/>
<br/>
Harry felt the heat rise in his cheeks. He looked around to make sure no one else had heard. When he was sure everyone’s attention was still safely on their lattes, he shot back defiantly, “You wouldn’t dare try.”<br/>
<br/>
“Are you sure about that?” Malfoy smirked and raised his eyebrows.<br/>
<br/>
Harry licked his lips, trying not to squirm as tingles ran through his stomach and straight to <em>other</em> places. Just out of pure curiosity, he decided he’d play along. “You’d have to keep me still enough first.”<br/>
<br/>
“Easy.”<br/>
<br/>
“Ha! If you say so.” Harry rolled his eyes. “I’ll bet you never spanked anyone before anyways.”<br/>
<br/>
“I would tell you about it, but I have a feeling this isn’t acceptable coworker lunch conversation.”<br/>
<br/>
“No,” Harry agreed, “it’s definitely not.” His toe was tapping on the floor, and he stopped. His espresso suddenly seemed stale, his bacon sandwich dry. Malfoy was bluffing, obviously, he was <em>Malfoy</em>. He was just trying to be cheeky and he knew he could rile Harry up. He clearly had no idea what he was talking about; and yes, this was an inappropriate conversation.<br/>
<br/>
“How would you do it, then, if you’re such an expert?”<br/>
<br/>
Malfoy’s lips twitched. He lowered his voice even more, until it was gratey and moved through Harry in a deliciously aggravating way. “I’ll shoot that wand from your hand so fast you’ll question that so-called Auror training of yours. Then I’ll tie your hands behind your back, turn you around and throw you over your own kitchen table. Kick your legs apart. Tear off your clothes.” Draco stopped and swallowed, his cheeks flushing with every word. He was slightly scowling now, like he was struggling to temper his own onslaught of lust. “Then I’ll make you count each strike of my hand against your bare arse until you’re so red and well-spanked, you’ll never forget your manners again.”<br/>
<br/>
Harry’s heart thumped madly. He shifted in his seat alleviate the pressure on his now half-hard cock.<br/>
<br/>
Malfoy sat back against his chair, crossing one ankle over his knee. He cleared his throat and picked up his cappuccino. “Not that I’d dare,” he said as he took a sip.<br/>
