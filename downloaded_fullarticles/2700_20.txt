    <p>“With all due respect, I disagree”.</p><p>Travers shot a nasty glare at Spencer-Moon, the British Minister of Magic.</p><p>“Grindelwald should be put into Azkaban and stay there for the rest of his life”, Travers repeated.</p><p>“I agree with our American friends”, Spencer-Moon said mildly and nodded towards Madam Picquery.</p><p>“There is a certain irony that Grindelwald ends up in his own prison. Put him in Nurmengard. It should be the best place for him to reflect upon his actions”. Travers huffed. “Reflect upon his actions”, he muttered. “Is this your doing, Dumbledore?” he asked then.</p><p>Several eyes turned toward Albus Dumbledore who sat quietly next to Spencer-Moon.</p><p>“After you idly fooled around, saying you couldn’t fight Grindelwald for years, you won’t get to decide what happens to him. Your lingering affection”, he spit those words out like acid, “have caused more than enough trouble. Grindelwald build Nurmengard, he’ll easily break out”.</p><p>There was a soft smile on Dumbledore’s lips, but it couldn’t fully cover the pain in his eyes. “He won’t, he understands that he has been defeated. But to put your mind at ease, I will ensure that he won’t break out. I shall put up defensive spells that –“, he started.</p><p>“Just put him in Azkaban and we don’t have to waste time arguing about this matter any longer”, Travers cut him off.</p><p>“I think, we should vote”, Madam Picquery said calmly.</p><p>The European Ministers along with the American Minister all exchanged gazes and nodded. Newt looked rather out of place, his eyes were fixed on Dumbledore’s right elbow who sat before him. The Aurors and other people who had contributed to Grindelwald’s capture had been allowed to witness the discussion after the Judges had not come to a conclusion in the trial.</p><p>“Grindelwald has caused trouble in all of our countries but has stayed out of Britain. Why should we lock him up there?” the German Minister of Magic said. The woman next to him hummed. Dumbledore’s eyes wandered over the Ministers that began the voting process.</p><p>“Nurmengard it is”, Madam Picquery finally said.</p><p>“Dumbledore we rely on you for further securing the prisoner”. Dumbledore gave a slight nod.</p><p> </p><p align="center">*</p><p>Majestic mountains rose into the clear blue sky, they were covered with fine white snow. The view was so serene that Dumbledore lingered for a moment and looked out the large window front. “Dumbledore?”</p><p>He turned around. Three Aurors and the Austrian Minister of Magic had entered the room. Dumbledore nodded and followed them. They went down a wide staircase, through heavy oak doors and along a long stone hallway and then took further stairs down. Further down, deeper and deeper, where the mild sun no longer reached. The only light was the illuminated tips of their wands. They stopped in front of a heavy iron door, one of the Aurors did a complicated wand movement and tapped the door which unlocked with a mechanic whirring sound. Another long corridor came into view and at the end of it was a single door that was magically locked. Dumbledore saw the seals around the door and could feel the strong force of it. It almost pushed him away and taking another step toward it cost him great effort. But maybe it was what was behind the door that made it so difficult to move forward. He hid his agony behind a cold mask as he walked with the Aurors toward the door. The Auror pointed his wand at the door and a narrow peephole was revealed. Dumbledore took one last step and stood before the peephole. It was so narrow it only allowed one person to look inside at a time.</p><p>There was a small room with dark stone walls and a small hard bed on the left side. Besides the bed there was nothing but a man inside. He sat on the bed unmoving, still and emotionless. His hair was longer and hung tangled into his face. On his wrists there were two silver bracelets looking almost like handcuffs. They sealed away his magic.</p><p>“What is there to add?” Dumbledore said, but his voice only came out as a cracked whisper.</p><p>It seemed that Grindelwald had heard his voice because finally the man looked up. Their eyes met and Dumbledore could not stand the other man’s gaze. He lasted hardly more than a few seconds than he took a step back.</p><p>“You’ve done everything possible”, Dumbledore said quietly. “I will put up another spell around the castle, I think we can improve there. Otherwise he is as secure as he could be”, he added then firmly. The Aurors nodded. They turned around to go but Dumbledore did not move.</p><p>“What is it, Dumbledore?” the Austrian Minister asked. Dumbledore raised his wand and pointed it at the door, there was a soft whoosh and it looked like the air rippled.</p><p>“He won’t hear a word spoken out here anymore”, he said.</p><p>“Then we should also block his sight”, one of the Aurors said enthusiastically.</p><p>“Wait”, Dumbledore said surprised but the Auror had already pointed her wand at the peephole.</p><p>Dumbledore looked through it once more. Grindelwald had gotten up to his feet and had walked up to the door. He stood a couple of steps away from the door where a magical barrier blocked his path. He looked at the peephole although from his perspective there was no longer anything to see or to hear. There would only be a rectangular window to a dark and empty corridor. But he still looked at him, his eyes fixed on Dumbledore’s as if he knew that he was still there. Dumbledore tore his eyes away from Grindelwald.</p><p>“Let’s go”, he said and hurried ahead.</p><p>“He’s still looking. Are we sure he can’t see outside?” one of the Aurors whispered scared.</p><p>“Of course, he can’t see us anymore. Stop looking”, the other Auror said and with a whip of his wand the peephole shut itself. Dumbledore was already at the door when the Aurors and the Minister joined him. He had regained a bit of his posture but putting one foot before the other felt like he was fighting against an invisible spell that tried to pull him back. As they stepped through the door and it fell shut, the long corridor with the single cell at the end disappeared. The mechanical whirring echoed through the silence as the door was locked. They hurried up the stairs back into the sunlit wide rooms. Without another glance at the beautiful scenery they left the castle. On the grounds outside Dumbledore put up spells and charms surrounding the castle, protecting it from unwanted visitors, making it untraceable. The castle on the mountain glittered in the sun, innocently as if it was just a castle of a pompous king. The party left the castle grounds and Disapparated.</p><p> </p><p align="center">*</p><p>The candles threw long shadows on the walls. Dumbledore averted his tired eyes. He had not bothered lying down and trying to sleep. He knew that sleep would not welcome him tonight. Exhaustion would only drive him into the same nightmares and bittersweet dreams of a spoilt past. He had tried numbing the pain many times after he had finally fought Grindelwald. The night after they had captured Grindelwald, he had drunk a Sleeping potion. He had cast all the spells to numb the terrible aching in his chest but once they wore off, the pain just came back as raw and unhealed as before. It seemed the pain of those memories would stay with him, sometimes blinding him like the bright sun when the morning rose after another sleepless night and sometimes only dully reminding him like a shadow that followed him wherever he went.</p><p>Only months had passed after Grindelwald had been locked away at Nurmengard when Dumbledore received the first offer to become the new Minister of Magic which he immediately turned down. He had learnt his lesson long ago. He knew that he was not suited for such a position. He continued his teaching position at Hogwarts as a Transfiguration teacher. The school gave him a routine to follow, work to keep his mind occupied and the feeling of repaying for the damage he had caused. A certain pupil caught his attention, in some ways he reminded Dumbledore of Grindelwald. He was a good looking young man with great talents who seemed to quickly gain a round of admirers. But there was a dark atmosphere surrounding the boy, he seemed unapproachable. He was always surrounded by admirers but he seemed to have no real friends, no one who was really close to him. And Dumbledore told himself that Grindelwald had not been like that. When they had first met…</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>A blonde young man was standing before one of the graves. Albus walked closer, he had never seen this man before. Godric’s Hollow was a small village, the young man must have moved here only recently. Maybe during the time he had been at Hogwarts? He seemed to be his age. But Albus could not recall anyone like him at Hogwarts. He would have remembered a man like him. The blonde-golden hair had been brushed behind his ears. It was longer and fell in soft waves. He had an extraordinary handsome face, very distinct facial features and his alert eyes were fixed on the tomb before him. Then he suddenly looked up, he seemed to have noticed Albus standing not far from him. As their eyes met, his heart missed a beat. He felt strangely caught. At a loss what to say, Albus lowered his eyes to the tomb. It was Ignotus Peverell’s tomb. The man had looked at the symbol carved onto the tombstone. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Are you – are you related to the Peverells?” Albus finally asked. The young man tilted his head, there was arrogance in his movement. He was taller than Albus. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“No”, the young man simply said.</em>
</p><p>
  <em> “Have you just moved here?” Albus asked next. The young man eyed him suspiciously like an alert animal, unsure whether he could trust Albus.</em>
</p><p>
  <em> “Yeah”, he said very slowly as if he had rather not shared that information with him. Albus looked back at the tombstone. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“The symbol?” he asked. For a moment something seemed to sparkle in the stranger’s eyes. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“You know something about it?” the young man asked, he looked like he could hardly hold back his curiosity. He looked intently at Albus.</em>
</p><p>
  <em> “The Deathly Hallows”, Albus said. Now the stranger’s eyes were glowing, he made a step toward Albus. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Albus! What are you doing? Hurry up!” the angry voice of Aberforth, his little brother echoed over the graveyard of Godric’s Hollow. Annoyed Albus shortly turned around to look at his wiry young brother standing at the entrance gate. When he turned back, the young man had disappeared. Albus frowned and then with a last glance at the tombstone he hurried to join his brother.</em>
</p><p>
  <em> Just the very next day, Bathilda Bagshot came to visit them. And much to Albus pleasant surprise she brought the young blonde man with her. “My great-nephew has just moved in with me, he is staying for a while”, she said with a kind smile. The young man looked directly at Albus recognising him, too. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Albus, this is Gellert”, Bathilda introduced the two. Gellert reached out his hand and Albus took it. Gellert gave him a firm handshake but on his face a smile appeared. It caused tingling up into the tips of Albus’ fingers. He hardly heard what Bathilda said about the two being around the same age and maybe having someone to talk to. Under the pretence of showing Gellert around, they went outside into the garden while Bathilda struck up a conversation with a grumpy Aberforth in the kitchen. Gellert looked at him curiously. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Well, I’ve just graduated from school. Hogwarts”, Albus said and then dared a side glance at Gellert. “You didn’t go to Hogwarts, did you?” </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Gellert softly shook his head. “Durmstrang”, he said. “I’ve heard about it! Have you also graduated already?” Albus asked, now equally curious. Gellert’s lips twitched into a strange smile. “I was expelled”, Gellert said. Albus’ face fell. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Most people cannot grasp great ideas with their narrow minds”, Gellert said. Albus thought of his brother. “Yeah”, he murmured. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“I thought you would understand”, Gellert said. This surprised Albus and he looked at Gellert. “Only few people know about the Deathly Hallows and can understand their potential”, Gellert continued. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Albus just listened as Gellert went on speaking about the Deathly Hallows and how he had always dreamt about finding them. His fascination with them was contagious. Had Albus not already been intrigued by the Hallows, he would have been by then. Gellert’s way of talking drew him in, mentally and physically. It was like every word they exchanged was a secret that only the other could understand. Albus told him about the Peverell family and that Ignotus Peverell probably was the youngest brother from the Tale of the Tree Brothers, making him the original owner of the Cloak of Invisibility. Gellert listened to his words just as intently as Albus had listened to his. Albus had never before met anyone his age who listened to him and fully grasped the meaning of what he had said and whose words and ideas excited him so much he could not stop smiling. He could hardly wait to see him again. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>They spent every day together from then on, discussing their ideas, sometimes they spoke about articles on spells and potions and about wizard’s politics. When they parted ways late in the evening, sometimes another thought would strike them and they exchanged letters sending an owl. Albus had close friends but he had never had had a friend like Gellert. Sometimes he lay awake at night and as he would think about the time he had spent with Gellert that day, he could no longer say whether the excitement and overflowing happiness he felt was purely because he felt so understood and had found a real friend or whether it was something else entirely. One evening they were discussing one of Albus’ ideas. The Greater Good. Gellert had gotten very excited when Albus had uttered those words out loud although he had mentioned it before in a letter. Gellert leaned closer to Albus, he raised his hands and tapped Albus’ chest. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“This will be the heart of our philosophy”, Gellert said. In the heat of the moment, Albus took Gellert’s hands. They were so close, he could see the light of the candles reflecting in Gellert’s eyes. The blonde hair was falling in waves almost reaching his shoulders. Albus abruptly let go off Gellert’s hands in fear that Gellert had felt his fingers starting to tremble. He didn’t dare to look any longer into Gellert’s eyes. “It’s late. Let’s continue tomorrow”, he said and got up. This small moment seemed to have thrown his mind into chaos. Gellert got up, too. Albus flinched when he felt Gellert’s hands grabbing his arm. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Why don’t you stay the night?” Gellert asked. Albus opened his mouth in surprise. He wasn’t sure how he could sleep here. “Stay”, Gellert said quietly, stepping closer. Albus heard himself say: “Okay”. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>He sent an owl to his home to tell Aberforth that he would stay over at Gellert’s place for the night. They picked up their discussion about the Greater Good. But somehow Gellert was as restless as Albus felt. Their conversation somehow faded out as if both of them thought about something else. Albus was sitting on Gellert’s bed and after a long silence, he dared to turn his head and look at Gellert. He had fallen asleep. His shirt was half open, exposing his chest, rising and falling slowly. His hair was falling into his face. Albus sat a bit closer and watched him like that for a few moments. He knew that to him Gellert was no longer just his best friend. He reached out his hand. He hesitated and then slowly touched Gellert’s hair. It was soft. Very gently he ran his fingers through his hair, pushing a few strands out of his face. His heart almost jumped out of his chest when Gellert opened his eyes. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“I’m –“, Albus started in panic and pulled back his hand. Gellert just looked at him. “Come, lay down”, he finally said then. Albus had not expected him to say anything like that but he lifted the sheets and slipped under them as far away from Gellert as it was possible in the bed. Albus thought Gellert could hear his anxious breathing as well as his heart beating hard and fast, so he avoided looking at him, scared that he had ruined everything. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Albus”. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>He slowly turned his head on the pillow at his name. “What’s wrong?” Gellert asked softly. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“N-Nothing”, Albus said nervously. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“You’re lying”, Gellert said but it didn’t sound accusing. He slid closer. “Are you still worried?” Gellert asked. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Worried?” Albus asked confused. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“You looked so worried when we spoke about Muggles earlier”, Gellert said and propped himself up on his right arm. With his left hand he touched Albus’ cheek. The breath got stuck in Albus’ throat and he didn’t dare to breathe. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“It’ll be just like you said, for the Greater Good. We won’t be cruel or merciless – of course not”, he said quietly while his thumb caressed his cheek slightly. Something like an agreeing hum came over Albus’ lips. Gellert lifted his hand. “Good night, Albus”. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>He lay back down, but so close that their arms were touching. “Good night”, Albus whispered and closed his eyes. His heart beating so fast, full of hope. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>The next day Albus had to go back home because of his brother and sister. He knew that he had to look after them, he had been away for an entire day and night. “I’ll meet you in the afternoon”, he said as he hurriedly put on his boots. “See you”, Gellert said and Albus rushed out of the door. His brother was agitated that Albus had been gone for so long. They argued but quickly stopped as to not upset Ariana. It was exhausting and annoying. Albus couldn’t wait to finally leave again. After having taken care of his sister, he told Aberforth to prepare the bath for her in the evening as he would be out. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Of course, you’re not there. This is your job! You should be doing this but here you go, running off again!” </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Albus left quickly and paced around the garden in circles. He didn’t want to go to Gellert in a bad mood. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“You shouldn’t get angry over something like that. He just doesn’t understand”. Albus jumped. Gellert was standing at the gate to the garden. “Gellert!” Albus’ bad mood seemed to wash away immediately upon seeing him. He hurried over to him and opened the gate. Gellert was smiling at him. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Let’s go down to the lake”, Gellert said. “The lake?” Albus asked surprised. Gellert took his arm and pulled him along for a few steps before letting go. They walked in silence through the wild nature and then down a rolling hill. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“I love this scenery”, Gellert said quietly as they stood at the lake. Mountains rose in the distance and the sun was sparkling on the lake. But Albus didn’t look at the lake or the mountains. “There is a place in Austria like this… the mountains are bigger, closer. I really want to show it to you, it’s a special place”, Gellert said. He turned and looked at Albus. “Don’t worry about your brother”, Gellert said. “I’m not worried about my brother”, Albus said. His heart wouldn’t calm down, his fingers wouldn’t stop shaking. “What bothers you so much, Albus?” Gellert asked, a frown appearing between his brows. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Tell me”, he demanded. “Tell me”, he repeated but his voice was gentle and he stepped closer. “Nothing stands between us, you know that”. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Albus felt excitement rush through his veins and at the same time fear. This could ruin everything. But hadn’t Gellert reached out to him, too? The night before, when he had touched his cheek? </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Albus, nothing will separate us”, Gellert said. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Are you sure about that?” Albus asked. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Of course”, Gellert said, a little surprised. “Of course”, he repeated firmly. Albus stepped even closer, their shoes were touching. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Nothing?” he whispered. “Nothing”, Gellert said quietly. The tips of their noses brushed against each other when Albus tip toed. He placed a kiss on Gellert’s lips, not daring to look he kept his eyes closed as he pulled away again. He turned his head away. He opened his eyes when he felt Gellert’s slim fingers on his chin. Gellert was looking at him but Albus could not read his expression. Then Gellert’s hand slid down resting below Albus’ ear on his neck. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“I’ll always be with you. Will you, too?” Gellert asked. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Yes”, the answer came so fast and breathy of excitement that Albus was almost ashamed. “We will never fight each other?” Gellert asked. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Never”, Albus said. Gellert leaned in and their foreheads touched. “Never”. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>It didn’t even take persuasion to seal a blood pact with Gellert, Albus had immediately agreed when Gellert brought it up. It was all of their intense feelings and moments rushing through him all at once when Gellert interlaced their fingers. Gellert pocketed the silver vial that carried their blood. Then he took Albus’ hand and ran his finger over the fresh cut which immediately healed itself. Still shaken up and emotional Albus could hardly stand. Gellert was breathing fast, too. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Let me heal your hand, too”, Albus said and took Gellert’s hand and ran his thumb over Gellert’s hand. Then Gellert opened his hand and Albus’ fingers interlaced with Gellert’s once more.</em>
