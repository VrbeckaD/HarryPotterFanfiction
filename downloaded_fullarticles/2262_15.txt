    <p>Voldemort waited in the parked car for his target to appear. His target kept the same routine every day, he could have laughed at how idiotic that was. Then again, the target probably thought they were safe. Money gives you that illusion. Voldemort was more than happy to tear that illusion apart.</p>
<p>Spotting the now familiar wild black hair, Voldemort picked up his phone. <em> R we still on 4 tonight? </em>  He looked out the window, wincing. It was incredible how dumb young people were these days.</p>
<p>He would never understand people could lower their IQ’s in such a degrading way or how they were able to find mates willing to <em> breed </em> with them. Just how and why this lazy form of communication had become quite so popular he would never know. This, he concluded, only proved how right he was - he superior to these people, in every way that mattered.</p>
<p>Maybe he should force the teen to read a book, preferably the dictionary. The target was now looking at their phone typing out a reply. His phoned dinged.</p>
<p>
  <em>Yes.</em>
</p>
<p><em>Perfect </em>. The black haired youth disappeared from view, surrounded now by friends as they headed herd like back to the assumed safety of palace gates.</p>
<p>He sent a text back. <em> See u soon </em>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">~*~</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When the thought had first slithered into his head, he had dismissed it as quickly as it had come, it was absurd, how was he to pull something of this calibre off? But then, the thought settled in his head and festered. It had swirled around in his head, haunting his dreams, until it had transformed into a carefully crafted and well thought out plan.</p>
<p>It hadn’t happened overnight, no, it was slowly that the plan had come together, it had to be perfect. One slip up could have everything falling to pieces.</p>
<p>His short black hair ruffled in the breeze that blew up, he tucked the strands that had come loose back under the baseball cap he wore. A storm was on the horizon, which was perfect. The rain would slow down anyone trying to find them, helpfully washing away any evidence that was left behind.</p>
<p>Long pale fingers twitched, waiting was the hardest part. Logically, he knew he had done as much of the groundwork as he possibly could have done. The wild-haired teen would either arrive or they wouldn’t. He was standing outside the entrance of Hyde Park.</p>
<p>The famous London landmark was a hive of activity, despite the lateness of the hour.  Children still played, their shrill laughter threatening to bring on a migraine. The parents hovered close by, never too far from the precious spawn, lest someone like him was lurking about in the shadows.</p>
<p>Being who he was, it was a bold risk to be close to such a well-known landmark. Police patrolled the area. Two had already walked past him and said hello.<em> If only they knew </em>, he thought smugly. It was thrilling, here he was about to pull off the crime of the century and those sworn to stop him were just casually walking past him.</p>
<p>To the East, a  flashlight flicked, he smirked. <em>Showtime. </em>He thought as he jogged into the park, pulling the baseball cap further over his face.</p>
<p>His target looked small without the near constant crowd of people that usually surrounded them, his heartbeat quickened as the youth moved ever closer. The rush was intoxicating. The target stopped next to the willow tree as planned and Voldemort grinned. Good. He stepped off the path and headed into the woods. He needed to come at the target from behind.</p>
<p>He stopped about 500 meters away from the target and checked the time. If everything and everyone was doing their job, it should be safe to move. He was going to go on a massacre if anyone fucked this up.</p>
<p>He approached the target slowly, who was busy looking around, confused. He pressed the gun to the small of the target’s back.</p>
<p>“Hello, little prince,” Voldemort purred, his lips close to the shell of the boy’s ear. “Are you being watched?”</p>
<p>The boy shuddered. “No,” he whispered licking his dry lips.</p>
<p>“For your sake, you better not be lying.” He pulled out the burner phone he had been contacting the boy on and fired off a quick text. The boy’s phone buzzed.</p>
<p>“Read it,” Voldemort instructed.</p>
<p>Shaking the boy reached into his coat pocket. His eyes went wide as he read the message on the screen.</p>
<p>“Nod if you understand.” The boy jerkily nodded his head. “Good, we’re going to walk together. Try to run and I’ll shoot you dead.”</p>
<p>He stood next to the boy, trying to make the movement look as natural as possible. They linked arms, walking along the winding park path. They looked like a close father and son, which suited Voldemort just fine.</p>
<p>An old beat up Nissan waited for them as they exited the park. His number two was seated behind the wheel, the boy let out a soft gasp as he recognized the man.</p>
<p>“Don’t make a fuss,” Voldemort warned quietly. He opened the car door, ushering the prince in. He checked his watch again, he had gained a few minutes, the timing was still going to be essential. He climbed in after the boy and car was off.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">~*~</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em> Pay attention </em> , Harry thought desperately to himself. <em> Pay attention to everything around you. </em>He could remember clearly the afternoon he had spent being taught what do if you were kidnapped, thinking it a waste of time. He had security, he didn’t to worry about being kidnapped.</p>
<p>He felt so incredibly stupid. The man who had put a gun to his back had wrapped his arm around Harry’s shoulders as they sat in the car. He clung to the knowledge that he had at least been able to see the car and would be able to give the police a description of it.</p>
<p>He sat, in the small car, between his kidnapper and a man with blonde hair and an arrogant face.</p>
<p>Harry kept his eyes facing forward, not wanting to give the kidnappers a reason to hurt him. The words on his phone were burned into his brain. <em> You are just as useful dead as alive. Think of your parents. </em></p>
<p>The blonde man had undone his seatbelt and was forcing his legs together. He could feel panic rising within him.</p>
<p>“Sssh,” The man with the gun hissed soothingly. “Luc here is just going to make sure you can’t run.”  He rubbed the back of Harry’s neck in soothing circles.</p>
<p>“Speaking off, I have the drug if you want it.”</p>
<p>Furry and horror burned at the sound of Severus Snape’s voice. Severus was his mother’s best friend and while Harry had been told that the man head ‘opposing’ views, he had never thought he could do anything like <em> this </em>.</p>
<p>“What do you think your Highness, are you going to be a good little boy or do I need to knock you out?”</p>
<p>“Please,” Harry said his voice shaking with fear “I’ll be good.” He did not these people pumping drugs into his body. He needed to be conscious. He was going to make sure these people ended up behind bars.</p>
<p>“Blindfold him,” The man decided, removing his arm. “The Prince knows better than to try and do something that will cost his family their lives.”</p>
<p>Harry’s heart stopped, fear paralyzed him. If this man had managed to get to him, what else had he done? Reflexively he screwed his face up as some rough cloth was placed over his eyes, locking him in complete darkness.</p>
<p>He tried to memorize everything, the sound of the voices around him. The features of faces he had seen, the smells in the car.</p>
<p>He tried counting mentally, trying to keep track of time and distance. Anything that could help the police.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">~*~</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Voldemort checked the time, it was a little after one in the morning. Outside it was pitch black, the lights of the nearest city having faded a while ago.</p>
<p>The car they had arrived in had been pushed into a ditch and set aflame. Bellatrix had been sent to find them a new car for the last part of their journey.</p>
<p>Voldemort crouched down next to Harry, who was propped up against a tree. He pulled the blindfold down, wanting Harry to be able to watch.</p>
<p>“Having fun?” He asked.</p>
<p>“If you want money -,”</p>
<p>“- Oh please, I want something better than <em> money </em>.” Voldemort pulled out his burner phone and quickly dialed a number.</p>
<p>“Whatever you want, my family can provide it.”</p>
<p>“Oh I know,” Voldemort flashed Harry a quick smile before speaking into the phone. “Listen carefully, I am Voldemort. I have the Crown Prince, say hello Harry,”</p>
<p>He pointed the phone towards the boy. “Hello,” Harry said meekly.</p>
<p>“If the police start looking for us, I will send the prince back - limb by limb.” Voldemort hung up and turned the phone off.</p>
<p>“You're Voldemort?”</p>
<p>“That’s right.”  The look of horror on Harry’s face was priceless. Voldemort stroked the boy’s pretty face tenderly “I’m glad you’ve heard of me.”</p>
<p>“My Lord,” Severus approached them, “Bellatrix just contacted us, she should be here within a few minutes.”</p>
<p>“Excellent,” Voldemort stood, looking down at the bound Prince. “Enjoy this, your Highness, it’s the last time you’ll ever see the outside world.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">~*~</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p>Harry watched as the terrorist known only as Voldemort walked away, his heart sinking. This wasn’t just a normal kidnapping. He cursed under his breath if he tried to escape he’d be killed, of that, he had no doubt.</p>
<p>He stiffened as Severus walked over to him. “How could you?” The words were out of his mouth before he could stop them.</p>
<p>Severus narrowed his black eyes. “I would watch your mouth boy, no one is going to be calling a doctor for you should you - accidentally, get hurt.”</p>
<p>Harry was pulled to his feet, wobbling slightly as his ankles were still tied together. Severus rolled his eyes and tugged Harry along, not caring that the boy struggled to keep up.</p>
<p>Harry wanted to say something, remind the man that he was best friends with his mother, anything to make Severus see what he was doing was wrong.</p>
<p>“Sev, are you still OK to drive?” Voldemort asked.</p>
<p>“Yes, my Lord.”</p>
<p>"Good, everyone same as before then.”  </p>
<p>Severus shoved Harry between the shoulder blades, forcing the boy forwards. Harry stumbled, a pair of strong arms caught him before he fell.</p>
<p>“Can we not break him until we’re at the safe house?” Voldemort snapped testily. “You can take your aggression out on him later.”</p>
<p>Harry opened his mouth to protest and found himself being shoved inside the car instead. This car seemed to be smaller than the last, and he was forced to lie across the bottom of the car floor.</p>
<p>The slamming of the car door and the rumble of the engine was his only warning that they were moving again. The car was eerily silent. No one dared to speak if Voldemort wasn’t speaking.</p>
<p>They hadn’t gone far when Harry felt his phone ring. He recognized the tone straight away.</p>
<p>“Stop the car,” Voldemort ordered almost lazily. His deft hands reached down and pulled Harry’s phone from his jacket pocket.</p>
<p>“Hello, your Majesty,” Voldemort purred into the phone. Harry wriggled, he couldn't let this monster speak to his mother!</p>
<p>The sound of guns being cocked filled the air and Harry stilled. Voldemort pulled the phone away and tutted at him.</p>
<p>“Play nice,” he mouthed. Harry could only watch in despair as the criminal turned his attention back to his mother.</p>
<p>“I can assure you, I plan on taking great care of your son - as long as you and your husband obey my commands. There is no reason for anyone to get hurt. Don’t worry, I’ll call you as soon as I’m ready to talk to you.” Voldemort hung up and turned off the phone.</p>
<p>“Leave my parents alone.” Harry snarled. How dare this no good <em> animal </em> do this to his family. “When the police catch you -,”</p>
<p>Voldemort broke out in laughter. A high pitched, cruel sound. “Catch me? They’ve had plenty of chances and they’ve always failed. You may be the apple of the countries eye, little Prince, but you alone can not make a group of idiots more capable of doing their job.”</p>
<p>“You will be caught.” Harry’s green eyes flashed with anger.</p>
<p>“He’s cute when he’s angry, isn’t he?” Voldemort laughed. “Severus hand over the drug.”</p>
<p>“No!” Harry cried he couldn’t afford to be drugged. Not around these monsters.</p>
<p>“Sssh, darling, it won’t hurt a bit.”</p>
<p>The was a sharp pain in his arm and his world turned black.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">~*~</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The heavy pounding of rain on the window woke Harry. He sat up shivering, this was most certainly not the palace.  Looking to his right he spotted a small dresser with his glasses on it. He moved quickly, afraid of Voldemort appearing.</p>
<p>To his great relief, he wasn’t chained up. The room itself was basic, wooden floorboards, a single beaten up chair, a table and the double bed he had found himself on.</p>
<p>The two huge skylights not only provide him with light but let him know he was in the very top room.</p>
<p>He paced the room, keeping away from the door. It would be just his luck if he tried his handle and a terrorist decided he was trying to escape. Trying to keep his wits about him, he mentally catalogued everything useful he had on him.</p>
<p>He had everything he had stupidly left the safety of the palace with; a comb, some loose change, and his glasses case - everything but his phone.</p>
<p>Having nothing better to do and needing to feel like he was doing something useful, Harry investigated the room. The leftmost corner had a leak, he wasn’t sure how helpful that would be but decided if push came to shove, he could try to find the hole and somehow make it bigger.</p>
<p>Voldemort and his band of despots have done a pretty good job of making sure the room was secure. All the cracks had been covered up, the door had been added to so Harry couldn’t even see underneath it.</p>
<p>God damn it, why did he have to be kidnapped by a competent criminal?!</p>
<p>He had just circled back to the bed when he heard angry footsteps stomping his way. “Fuck.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">~*~</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Voldemort banged on Harry’s door, “Step back.” He didn’t wait, instead opting to unlock the door straight away.</p>
<p>He stormed in, his nostrils flaring in anger. Harry was standing by the bed, looking scared. Good.</p>
<p>“Well?” he shouted at his men, who scuttled in, grabbing Harry roughly and forcing him into the chair.</p>
<p>He watched impatient as Harry’s legs were tied to the chair, the boy’s arms tied behind himself. He stalked over to the boy, grabbing the beloved prince face and opening his jaw. He stuffed a dirty rag in the Prince’s mouth.</p>
<p>The camera was set up on the table facing the boy. He made sure that the boy’s terrified face was framed properly. He couldn’t deny that Harry was indeed as handsome as the world’s media proclaimed him to be. He would have to take care not to scar that pretty face.</p>
<p>He stalked over to the shaking boy and whispered into his ear. “What happens next you can thank your parents for, all they had to do was follow my instructions and all this could have been avoided.”</p>
<p>Harry’s eyes were wide with fear, he screamed, the gag blocking the sounds. Voldemort patted the boy softly on the check “There, there,” he crooned mockingly “Be a good little Prince and this will all be over soon.”</p>
<p>Once Voldemort was happy with the setup, he and his men donned masks and turned the camera on.</p>
<p>Voldemort stood centre stage in his blood red mask, temporarily blocking Harry from view. He spoke directly to the camera.</p>
<p>“People of Great Britain, last night a gave the King and Queen a rather simple instruction. That instruction was not followed as you all have come to know by now, I don’t like it when people ignore me,” He allowed himself a sadistic grin before continuing.</p>
<p>“As punishment, may I present to you, Prince Harry.” He stepped out of the way, giving the scared Prince a full minute of screen time and oh, did Harry look like the perfect victim. Barely 16, full of innocence and hope. A bright, shiny, pretty beacon of hope.</p>
<p>Behind him, Lucius turned on a blow torch. Harry whimpered in fear, tears leaking from his eyes as he begged for mercy around the gag. Voldemort picked up the knife that had been placed behind the camera and handed it to his lieutenant.</p>
<p>Lucius heated up the blade, handing the now red-hot knife carefully back to Voldemort.</p>
<p>Voldemort plucked at the boy’s sweat-soaked t-shirt. “I wish now to speak directly to the King and Queen. Every time you fail me, your son will pay the price.” He ran the blade up the shirt, effortlessly slicing the fabric in half, revealing Harry’s firm torso to the world.</p>
<p>“I did always find that a hot knife cuts better, watch.” He placed the tip of the knife at the bottom of Harry’s belly button. The boy screamed louder still as the blade pierced his skin. The smell of blood and burnt skin soon filled the air.</p>
<p>Without warning, Voldemort sliced cleanly upwards. The knife cut through Harry’s skin like butter. He stopped at the start of Harry’s pecks. There was no need to ruin the boy completely just yet.</p>
<p>Harry slumped against the ropes binding him, unconscious. Blood poured out of Harry’s chest like a river that had burst its banks. The sight was arousing. Harry looked lovely covered in blood.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">~*~</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A solemn air covered London like a thick blanket. The terrorist organization, known only as the Death Eaters had hacked into the news broadcast to play the horrific tape in full.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Albus Dumbledore had issued a statement condemning the tape and the actions of the group, demanding Harry’s safe return.</p>
<p>As shocked and horrified the public were, seeing her son being tortured on TV was too much for Lily.  The Queen had locked herself in her room and was refusing to see anyone.</p>
<p>“James?” Sirius placed a hand on his best friend’s shoulder. “We’re gonna get the pup back and make that bastard pay.”</p>
<p>James sat on the edge of his desk, staring blankly at the TV as a reporter was discussing the tape. “Yeah,” he said “Sure.”</p>
