    <p>Turns out Newt has been wrong this whole time, because it seems like Theseus does really care about him. Perhaps it’s a slow process, but at the end of the day Newt does notice.</p>
<p>Especially after Theseus manages to keep the occamys his aurors saved during a case; he convinces the Minister himself to allow him to keep the creatures, the same ones he gives to Newt later.</p>
<p>Newt is so happy, so moved by the way Theseus took care of the occamys he does something he doesn’t usually do; he leans forward to kiss his brother’s cheek.</p>
<p>Theseus freezes, face turning so red Newt worries his brother is furious with him because of what he did, but he’s not… He smiles at him, looking almost in shock still and then he mumbles something about having too much work to do and he turns away from Newt. And because of that Newt doesn’t get to see the way Theseus touches the cheek his little one just kissed.</p>
<p>After that Theseus starts to act a little bit weird, at least that’s what Newt thinks; he’s constantly following him, giving him all sorts of gifts and just staring at Newt like he’s just… waiting for something.</p>
<p>Until one day, after touching Newt’s arm, like he sometimes does, and sitting right next to him oh his office’s couch, he finally… asks: “Can I get another one? Another kiss?”</p>
<p>Newt relaxes immediately after that; just that? All this time worried he had pissed his brother off in some way and it’s just that Theseus wants a kiss. It’s not a surprise, his brother has always been a person that enjoys being touched.</p>
<p>So Newt kisses him on the cheek again and starts doing it every time he comes back from a long trip, because Theseus has a particular way to look at him whenever he’s been away from home for more than a couple of months. He always looks like he has missed him, like waiting for him had been a torture.</p>
<p>Newt kisses him on the cheek to make that sadness disappear, to make Theseus smile at him; it always works.</p>
<p>But then… Theseus starts acting shy around him, looking away every time he gets caught staring at Newt for too long or just having that look of longing like one of Theseus’ aurors told Newt once.</p>
<p>One day he walks towards him, stopping once he’s right in front, staring at the ground like it’s the most interesting thing in the world, blushing to the tip of his ears.</p>
<p>“Newt…” He breathes. “Can I have another kiss but not… on the cheek this time?”</p>
<p>Theseus isn’t shy and he certainly doesn’t get flustered easily; Newt’s confused and it doesn’t help that his brother is finally looking at him in the eye again, like he wants to tell him something important.</p>
<p>“Sure,” he says, although he doesn’t have any idea. Newt just pulls Theseus down by his tie so he can kiss him on the forehead.</p>
<p>“That wasn’t what I meant,” Theseus chuckles, but he takes Newt into his arms. “But it’s okay as long as you keep kissing me.”</p>
<p>Theseus assures it’s alright, but Newt has the feeling there’s something else, something important he’s missing.</p>
