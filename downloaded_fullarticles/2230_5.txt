"Do you mean the very important matter of whether we should keep our relationship a secret or make it public?"</p><p>Filius nodded and muttered, "I-I want to make it official, Pommy; but I don't want the students or worse, the other Professors to use our relationship against us."</p><p>Pomona inquired, "Do you really think our fellow Professors would ever do that?"</p><p>Filius said, "I wouldn't put it past Arvid."</p><p>Pomona grinned. "Arvid is the most harmless Defence Against The Dark Arts Professor we've ever had, so don't worry about him."</p><p>Filius sighed. "I guess there's nothing stopping us going public now then."</p><p>Pomona beamed, "That's what I like to hear because I might have arranged a dinner with all of the Professors."</p><p>Filius smirked. "You sly woman."</p></div>
