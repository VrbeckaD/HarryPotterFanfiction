    <p>“Evans, go out with me.”</p><p>“I would rather go out with the giant squid and then HELL would have to FREEZE OVER before I even remotely consider going on a date with you. Get that in your arrogant, egotistical head. I will never go out with you, Potter.”</p><p> </p><p>
  <u> <em> <strong>Lily’s POV</strong> </em> </u>
</p><p>It was finally summer, and I had come up with the best revenge plan to finally knock Potter and his little band of Marauders down a few notches. Charm one of his fellow Marauders to be in a relationship with me causing a rift between friends. The hardest part would be getting one of the Marauders alone long enough to charm him if that failed, I could always use a love potion administered daily for maximum revenge.</p><p>“LILY” My mum called from downstairs, “It’s time to go. Get down here and we will leave for the train station.” I gave my room one last look making sure that I hadn’t forgotten to put anything in my trunk. When I had finished that I went down stairs.</p><p>“All ready mum.”</p><p>On the way to King’s Cross Station, I was deciding which of the other three Marauders I wanted to use to get my revenge on Potter. Sirius Black, his best mate and the renowned playboy of Hogwarts; Remus Lupin, my fellow prefect, the brains of the group and my friend in the entire group of miscreants; or little Peter Pettigrew, a sweet boy who wasn’t great at magic but had a nice personality before becoming corrupted by Potter and Black. I choose Sirius Black because he is the closest with Potter - being on the quidditch team with him, living with him, and always getting into all sorts of trouble with him.</p><p>I swear James Potter’s mission in life is to make mine a living hell. Every day, without fail for the last two years, he had asked me out every break, in between every class, during every class I had with him and whenever the hell he felt like it.</p><p>Potter and Black have their own personal fan clubs outside of the fan club for all of the Marauders. I honestly have no idea what girls see in in Potter with his windswept sex hair, tanned body, muscles, being a notorious jerk to other students, always getting detentions or any of the other crap a member of the <em><u></u><strong>James is Great at Everything</strong></em> club finds to thinks about during their meetings. Potter is always playing pranks on me, the girl he supposedly <em>'LOVES'.</em> According to Remus, he is only mean to me to get my attention. If he wanted it, maybe he should stop acting like a prick and being such a bastard to everyone he doesn’t like. Sirius Black infuriates me because he treats the female population with little respect shagging one girl than snogging someone new not long after. Apparently he is suppose to be great in bed, not that I would have any idea about that one. Through <em>'Our relationship'</em> we never slept together because I would never be able to come to terms with being another notch on his bed post. Trust me, he really has notches on his bed and if you are a member of the Sirius Black fan club your dream was to be the next. If you had slept together, within twenty-four hours the entire school knew.</p><p>You see, when I first found my hatred for Potter, Black, and Pettigrew I started the <em><strong>I hate the Marauders,</strong></em> club for any guy or girl who has had enough of the Marauders being the kings of the school. Sadly, the only students in it are my friends Marlene McKinnon, Mary McDonald, Alice Prewett; a hand full of Slytherins who were tired of being the butt of their jokes; and the members of every other quidditch team in the school. Now if you asked me how many teachers are in the<strong><em> I hate the Marauders club</em></strong>, I would have to say about half the faculty, because we have: the divination teacher, Filch, Magonagall, and a couple other teachers who hate the pranks they play but find they like the boys otherwise.</p><p>When we got to the train station, I had to be quick to get on the train to avoid a certain prat that had this sick sixth sense; he always seemed to know where I was at all times. I called it his stalker sense. Now that I think about it, I overheard the Marauders talking about a map they had that James needed to find me so he could ask me out again. Well, I may as well wait for Mary and Marlee to get here so I can do my favorite thing, Potter bashing.</p>
