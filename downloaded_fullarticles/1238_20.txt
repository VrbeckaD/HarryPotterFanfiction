          <div class="userstuff"><p>At first I wasn't hungry, nauseous even. The cheer of the Great Hall couldn't blot out the fact that they died. Cedric. Sirius. The grief fed me in a way that no food could. Later, all I could feel was this hunger, a gnawing, all encompassing feeling that was mine to bear. At any time, I could gorge upon pumpkin pastries and treacle tart until I ballooned up like Aunt Marge. But I wouldn't, perhaps even couldn't, go back. It was both power and a curse. I dared to live, a skeleton masquerading as a boy, while they remained dead.</p></div>
