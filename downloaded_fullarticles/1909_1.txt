    <p>Kendra Zeller looked at her friend, baffled by her behavior, while the former Ravenclaw girl didn't even bother to stop singing like a mad woman. Somehow, they ended in some Muggle bar, celebrating Kate's recent break up with her fiancé. It took few glasses of vodka for the woman to stand on the table and show everyone her singing skills, which were... bad to say the least. Still, Kendra just couldn't make her body move to stop the blonde-haired girl. She was her best friend, they worked together in the Aurors' Department and the way she was left by her fiancé... Kendra wished she could just find the guy and rip his head off.</p>
<p>It was few weeks to their wedding, and everything was progressing more than smoothly, when everything fell apart. The brunette was helping Madeline in the restaurant's garden with flowers arrangement, when they saw Nathaniel shoving his tongue in some girl's throat. The anger in Kendra's veins was enough to separate the two of them, while she send few curses towards the man, who who dropped to the ground unconscious, and after that she turned the young girl into a pig.</p>
<p>So yeah, she wasn't really surprised when the notice from the Ministry came, saying she was suspended for six months for attacking a muggleborn and performing magic in a place where she shouldn't. Right now, Kendra was jobless, her own personal life was falling apart and her best friend was trying to seduce some wasted Muggle. Could this evening get any worse?</p>
<p>"Merlin, Katie, leave the boy alone," she said, as the male didn't look like he was even of age. Unfortunately, her friend had other plans and before Kendra stood on shaking legs, feeling the earlier consumed alcohol quite strongly, Kate disappeared, taking the almost unconscious Muggle with her. "For fucks sake, did she just..."</p>
<p>"Yes, she apparated. Quite a handful, this secretary." Deep voice resonated just next to her ear and she jumped surprised, before turning to see the intruder's face.</p>
<p>"Remind me, why are you here, Ethan?" she said, wincing when he asked the bartender for a drink and sat at her table.</p>
<p>"Sit with me and let's talk," he said, taking a sip of beer and Kendra rolled her eyes, but still complied. She took her time looking at him, taking the view in front of her wit unnoticeable pleasure. Auror Ethan Davies was her co-worker until her accident occurred. Well, maybe a little more like her boss, but she felt disgusted just thinking about his promotion, especially since they started working in the department at the same time, and she was definitely better than him. Well, at least in her opinion.</p>
<p>The man had black, too shiny for her taste, messy hair, which contrasted with his pale complexion. Blue eyes made the impression like he could see clearly what was inside her head and sometimes she suspected him of actually checking her mind in some way she couldn't stop. Which was ridiculous, because she knew Occlumency. White shirt, unbuttoned at the top, with a loose tie made her heart ache, at how handsome he looked while being such an awful human being. If she hadn't have a boyfriend until last night, she would have been head over heels for him for years. But she had one. Until he stepped in between Katie and her excuse of a fiancé and tried to convince them that 'it was alright when they're not married yet and are still single and there was nothing wrong with it, as he was doing the same thing'. To his dismay, Kendra had stood right behind him at that time and their relationship ended, before he could even open his mouth to protest.</p>
<p>"So, what do you wanna talk about? Certainly not about my crumbling carrier, I'm out for six months," she said, taking her glass of whisky and hesitating for a second. She had enough of alcohol for today, her body was sending her clear signals of it, but on the other hand... If she was supposed to sit there and listen to him, she would need another glass.</p>
<p>"Actually, as you're now jobless and you're not under our Department supervision, I thought you could help me. You see, aunt McGonnagal is looking for a Defense Against the Dark Art teacher and I thought that you'd be perfect," Davies explained and Kendra put the glass down immediately.</p>
<p>"Me? Teaching some brats?" she asked, suspecting that he probably had to hit his head somewhere on the way to this place.</p>
<p>"Come on. You don't really have a choice, you need money to live. Besides, your friend just used magic in the Muggle's presence. If you don't agree, I'll have to chase her and she'll end just like you. I think she already has enough problems, given her situation." Small smirk appeared on his face and Kendra cursed under her breath.</p>
<p>"You blackmailing asshole," she spat, while he chuckled. "Fine. But only for six months!" Of course she didn't have any other choice. No one really wanted to hire an Auror who was kicked out. It just didn't look appropriate in society's eyes.</p>
<p>"You'll start on Monday, it's the start of school year, if you didn't know. And they are not brats, some of them are not much younger than you." The woman laughed, not really believing his words.</p>
<p>"They are seventeen. That's still four years," she said coldly. Just thinking about dealing with teens made her stomach clutch in pain. She hated teens. They were unpredictable, spoiled and didn't know anything about the real world. Besides, if she was correct, the famous girl from the Golden Trio came back to finish her education with other brats who couldn't do it because of the war and they were nineteen. They wouldn't really see her as an authority when she was only two years older. Even now Kendra was sure they would be problematic. War heroes or war villains from her own Snake's House. They probably thought they were invincible, one way or another.</p>
<p>Kendra smiled mockingly. She would show them they still knew nothing. Voldemort was just one bad guy, who would rule the world if it wasn't for Dumbledore. But the world was full of other evil people and these kids had no idea how cruel and disgusting their murders and they could be. Much more than some old prick sending Avada everywhere.</p>
