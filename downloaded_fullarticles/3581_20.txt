    <p> </p><p>August, 1980</p><p> </p><p>“I need new friends.”</p><p>Sirius mumbled empty insults under his breath. His closest friends had left him in the lurch. Sure, they had a valid reason, what with their 6 day old baby and all...He didn’t <em> really </em> think that they should have planned their family with more consideration for <em> him. </em>But he couldn’t help but feel annoyed at the new duties to The Order of the Phoenix that he would need to pick up, considering James Potter’s absence for the next 8 weeks.</p><p> </p><p>He felt a smile coming on as he imagined little Harry giving them at least a tiny bit of hell.</p><p> </p><p>Sirius considered the fact that James Potter was likely tending to a nappy while Sirius was stuck reading over the files on the newly enlisted witch he’d been roped into mentoring. James’s task would be more brief but certainly had a more unpleasant odor. The little parlor room The Order of the Phoenix rented at The Leaky Caldron was perhaps a bit musty from old furniture and neglect, but that was the worst of it.</p><p> </p><p>Sirius has persistent doubts that he’d be a suitable mentor. He didn’t really understand why Dumbledore chose him to take up this slack.</p><p> </p><p>He went over the possible reasons in his head, since pointless mental conjecture was one of the long list of things that Sirius Black enjoyed more than paperwork.  </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> I suppose I was the next best thing? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>He wasn’t. He knew this. The Potters were the sort of people that took naturally to leadership. They’d been head boy and girl during their 7th year at Hogwarts. They were both more patient and more responsible than most people in their early 20s. Sirius was a far cry from that description.</p><p> </p><p>Two years out of Hogwarts, the goals he’d accomplished were less, “find a wife, buy a house, have a baby” and more “try not to be a gigantic twat to anyone today”.</p><p> </p><p>He was fairly pleased with his progress in the realm of minimizing twatishness. He hadn’t been born to be a good or a kind person. Certainly, none of his family possessed those qualities. He didn’t even become aware that it was an option until he was 11 years old. His youthful attempts at catching up were often abject failures in real decency. He’d been a major twat a time or 50.</p><p> </p><p>He really had gotten better. He didn’t feel like a decent person deep down, but that was certainly what he was aiming to be.</p><p> </p><p>However, Sirius didn’t really do “responsible”. He once bought new clothes because he was so rubbish at laundering spells, rather than practicing up on the aforementioned charms. It had seemed reasonable to Sirius. He rode a flying motorbike and never found himself compelled to follow the rules in favor of having a good time.</p><p> </p><p>He considered the possibility that Dumbledore was using this as some sort of mission to persuade him into behaving like more of a role model. The only flaw in that theory was that it assumed Dumbledore had reasons for all the things he did. Sometimes he just did things. No one knew why. Including Albus Dumbledore himself.</p><p> </p><p>Reason or no reason, Sirius was stuck with the job. Very soon he’d be face to face with his new mentee; Marlene McKinnon of Hufflepuff house, age 16. It was his his job to teach her how The Order worked and let her follow him around, watching and learning, for the next month until she went back to Hogwarts.</p><p> </p><p>She was an incoming 7th year. Sirius figured she must’ve gotten bored and restless during the summer or that perhaps her older sisters and brothers going off to fight in wars seemed exciting to someone that young. With four siblings in the order she’d be an obvious recruit after she finished 7th year.</p><p> </p><p>He spotted the line on the file in front of him that stated Marlene wouldn’t even come of age until August 31st.  Generally, The Order wasn’t wild about taking under-age witches and wizards or even of age candidates who were still at Hogwarts.</p><p> </p><p>There were exceptions. Sirius found that speculating on what made Marlene McKinnon exceptional more interesting than her file as well.</p><p> </p><p>7th years were particularly vulnerable to recruiting from the Death Eaters. Having a 7th year spying for the order and keeping tabs on who had taken the mark and who was likely to to do so was a fairly useful thing for The Order. It had been done before.</p><p> </p><p>A McKinnon would be ghastly choice for this task.</p><p> </p><p>The McKinnons were a well known wizarding family. All fervent supporters of Muggle Born equality and every one of them (now that their youngest had signed on) was order affiliated. Sirius didn’t know their exact percentage of Magical ancestry and thought that sort of tedious detail was better saved for people who were vile enough to care. His mother probably would have known.</p><p> </p><p>The McKinnon parents were a black Londoner witch and an Irish wizard. Their five children had slight variations of skin tones in the middle area between their parents. But every one of them had the same hair. It was instantly recognizable, as it was <em> large;</em> heaps of ringlets that seemed to grow out rather than down. One might easily spot a McKinnon in a crowd from a broomstick at a distance. This was obviously an unideal quality in a spy.</p><p> </p><p>So, when the girl showed up 20 minutes early with a smile as broad as Hagrid’s shoulders, he didn’t have to ask who she was. This was <em> obviously </em> Marlene McKinnon of Hufflepuff house. She had more freckles than her sister Grace, who’d been in Sirius’s year, but he contended that they looked related.</p><p> </p><p>The beaming impish girl was tiny under her head full of golden-brown spiral curls. Sirius had encountered taller 2nd years. Marlene’s taste in muggle clothes might have made someone else look tough or edgy. She looked, instead, like a human sunflower who inexplicably enjoys muggle bands with a penchant for profanity.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> She’s actually quite pretty. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>As soon as the thought crossed his mind backtracked and argued with himself over how she wasn’t really beautiful. She might have been more accurately described as cute. Sweet looking? Like a kneazle kitten.</p><p>Marlene McKinnon had nothing of the icy untouchable beauty that his own family was known for. Sirius thought maybe that whole concept was overrated anyhow. His deranged cousin Bellatrix may have been one of the great beauties of her generation, but nearly everyone would agree that she was terrifying.</p><p> </p><p>Marlene was anything but terrifying. The only thing Sirius found disconcerting about her was that she was looking at him like Godric Gryffindor come again.</p><p> </p><p>Was she under the influence of a curse? Was she confusing him with someone important? Or just… confused in general?</p><p> </p><p>Sirius was entirely oblivious to the fact that Marlene McKinnon had been looking at him like that for quite a while. She’d considered herself well over it by now, even. But as soon as she walked in she realized that the crush she’d acquired when she was in her 4th year and he in his 7th, was not entirely a thing of the past. When then-14-year-old Marlene heard he’d run away from home and subsequently been disowned for rejecting his family’s blood supremacist ideologies, she decided that Sirius Black was perhaps the most impressive young wizard she’d ever come into contact with.</p><p> </p><p>She’d been completely smitten when she found that along with his principles and willingness to stand up for them, he also possessed strikingly handsome good looks. His high contrast coloring and steel grey eyes in combination with his aristocratic bone structure made it hard for Marlene to focus on anything else, even from across the dining hall.</p><p> </p><p>Her near in age siblings, Grace and Lucan, had taken notice and did not hesitate to tease their baby sister mercilessly. She’d tried saying yes to the first boy who expressed an interest in her in 5th year, just to prove to them that she was over her silly crush. She made a noble effort to overlook Reginald Cattermole’s uncanny resemblance to a ferret. Poor sod. Never stood a chance. She’d grown increasingly bored of him during 6th year and gave him the boot officially some months back. And now she was back to square one. Sirius, naturally, hadn’t even been aware of any of these details as they’d occurred.</p><p> </p><p>He was under the impression that no one looked at him like that. Though he liked to think he was quite pleasant to look at (Marlene would concur), in general he was looked upon with suspicion. And that was amongst his allies. There were plenty of witches and wizards who looked at him with complete contempt. Marlene, on the other hand...</p><p> </p><p>He wasn’t sure of her reasoning, but Sirius found himself reveling in the way she looked at him.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> But why? It’s strange. I should stop. She should stop. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“You’re Sirius Black.”</p><p> </p><p>“I am. But I’m afraid you have this whole introductions thing backwards. I already know who I am. You’re meant to tell me who you are. But I’m fairly certain you’re Marlene McKinnon? Am I right?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes. That’d be me. Errrm… I meant to have introduced myself. Not just stare at you like an idiot, then tell you your own name. And I’m early. That’s...unfortunate. Uh… I’m pretty bad at this. I’m sorry?”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s alright Marlene. It’s a pleasure to make your acquaintance. You’re bad at… what exactly?”</p><p> </p><p>“So many things, really.” She laughed.</p><p> </p><p>Sirius decided that the ability to laugh at herself would come in handy if she blundered this way as matter of habit. He actually sort of admired that quality. Most people took themselves to seriously, he thought. It was tedious for him to spend time around people like that. He had a feeling that mentoring Marlene would be anything but tedious.</p><p> </p><p>“Well aren’t we all? I’ve never mentored anyone before and I’m sure I’ll be very disappointing. Truly, I’m sorry that you got stuck with me. You can send complaints to the Potters.”</p><p> </p><p>He thought maybe a little dose of self deprecation would put this little tightly wound ball of nerves and hair a bit more at ease. Looking at her posture was making him feel uneasy.</p><p> </p><p>It was also Sirius’s earnest opinion that he would be a terrible mentor. He had no idea what he was even meant to do with her. He felt it was likely that he would forget to feed her or something like he had done with that goldfish he’d won at that muggle fair.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh no not at all.” She blurted out as if it were all one word.</p><p> </p><p>As Marlene continued to speak, her words tumbled out at an impressive pace without so much as a pause for breath.</p><p> </p><p>“I was so excited when I heard you were going to mentor me. I always thought you were so brave, walking away from your family like you did. That must have taken an enormous amount of courage. But I hadn’t seen you since you left school and you are <em> exceptionally </em> good looking and I got distracted and forgot that I was supposed to say <em> my </em>name when I meet a person.”</p><p> </p><p>Sirius did his best not to let his face react in any way while Marlene cycled through approximately 50 facial expressions within the span of a minute.</p><p> </p><p>Sirius wondered what planet was this girl had come from. Grace McKinnon had been fairly Hufflepuffy in his recollection, but she wasn’t the personification of a broom crash when she spoke. But just like a broom crash, Marlene was impossible to look away from. Sirius was transfixed. But he preferred to think that he wasn’t quite terrible enough to have to hold back a laugh at a broom crash.</p><p> </p><p>He was at a loss of anything at all to say. Lucky for him that Marlene, whose embarrassed blush might have been visible from her far off home planet, felt compelled to fill the air with more of her own words.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh sweet Merlin did I really say that? I’m so so sorry. I think I should probably go. Maybe I’ll tell Dumbledore I’m not cut out for The Order. Maybe I’ll move to Spain and start a new life…”</p><p> </p><p>“That won’t be necessary. Besides it would reflect pretty poorly on me if my first mentee ran away to Spain after meeting me once. So I must object. You’ll be great with The Order. Your heart is in it. It must be. You’ve still got a year of school left but here you are.”</p><p> </p><p>“I thought maybe I could help. Everyone’s so scared. He’s getting more and more powerful. I’d rather be part of something that stops him than sit idle and be scared.”</p><p> </p><p>“See, you do belong here. Please don’t run away to Spain. I’m sure your brothers and sisters would miss you terribly.”</p><p> </p><p>“I suppose they might. A bit. Well, maybe not Gawain, but the rest, yes. Do you know them?”</p><p> </p><p>“I was in Grace’s year. We’ve never been close but she seems like a lovely person. You look a lot like her. You all look alike. Gawain too. What’s wrong with Gawain?”</p><p> </p><p>Marlene did look like all the other McKinnons. But Sirius had never given Grace a second glance and if he had glanced any more at Marlene it would have constituted a full on ogling.</p><p> </p><p>He told himself that he shouldn’t have been looking at her like that, but she had just called him <em> exceptionally good looking </em> so it was sort of forced to the front of his mind. Or that’s the mental gymnastics he performed to excuse it anyway.</p><p> </p><p>“He’s terribly embarrassed by me. I’m… pretty embarrassing. So I don’t really blame him. But we aren’t particularly close.”</p><p> </p><p>“I have a thing or two to teach him about what it’s really like to have embarrassing relatives. Did you know that my first cousin <em> tells people </em>that she’s the Dark Lord’s mistress? You’re not embarrassing. I… look forward to working with you.”</p><p> </p><p>All the impulses Sirius felt towards Marlene felt <em> wrong </em>and contrary to the image he attempted to portray to the world. He was supposed to be blazé about people’s opinions of him. Self confident and cool. He felt anything but cool when intentionally bringing up Bella’s terrible taste in men. Could Voldemort even really be called a man at this point? He looked… not entirely human. Sirius idly wondered if he had all the working bits. But he would refrain from making any inquiries into the matter.</p><p> </p><p>Marlene looked so anxious. She looked down at her boots and played with the ripped hem of her too-big shirt. As endearing as her nervous fidgeting was, Sirius wanted to make her feel more at ease.</p><p> </p><p>But why should he care if she’s awkward? Probably that was just her. Why was he making himself uncomfortable in efforts to make her less so? He didn’t do that. He especially didn’t do that for skinny 16 year old Hufflepuffs with huge hair and school girl crushes.</p><p> </p><p>But he did. And he continued to, even as he thought about how he didn’t.</p><p> </p><p>“So, you mean to say that she’s <em> not </em> his mistress but she <em> tells people </em> that she is? That’s. Wow. I can’t think of many things more embarrassing than that. Actually being his mistress would be less pathetic, at least.”</p><p> </p><p>Her sunny smile was back. Sirius felt a small sense of victory.</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t know. I mean that’s my theory. But I don’t keep a sneekoscope in he-who-must-not-be-named’s bedroom.”</p><p> </p><p>“Do you think he even has a bedroom? You know I’ve never before this moment thought of him being a person who does mundane things such as sleep or shag your cousin. But he must, right? He can’t possibly devote every moment of his life to terrorizing and murdering. Do you think he does his own shopping?”</p><p> </p><p>“He probably has his minions do it or else a house elf, but now I really wish he did do it himself. I like the mental image it creates. He’d need breaks from reigning terror for a few hours on Thursday afternoon, because he needs to stock up on fresh produce. Can you picture the poor shopkeeper, totally gobsmacked?”</p><p> </p><p>“You make jokes about He-who-must-not-be-laughed-at too. Gawain would be so scandalized.”  </p><p> </p><p>The pair were having quite a laugh at the expense of the most dangerous dark wizard alive. They were both sure that this was going to be fun. Sirius decided that he needed some fun in his life now that James and Lily were busy with their baby.  </p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>It didn’t take long for Sirius’s family issues to make themselves known to his new mentee. He was not cut out for this at all, he thought, for a myriad of reasons. Marlene would surely be better off with someone who didn’t have a little brother who took the dark mark.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> So anyone other than me. Poor Marlene. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>While Sirius was right that he held the distinction of being the only member of The Order of the Phoenix to have a sibling take the mark, he was not correct about his ineptitude as Marlene’s mentor. At least not if you asked Marlene herself</p><p> </p><p>For Marlene, seeing Sirius’s fruitless efforts to hide his conflicted feelings while listening to reports about his only brother and the danger he may be in was like throwing gas on the already roaring fire of her infatuation.</p><p> </p><p>She felt that all that conflict and turmoil over his family background made him even more admirable. The fact he was the only member of the order with a death eater sibling meant that he was the one who had the hardest choices to make, and despite that, he’d chosen the side of the light. He would have had a much easier time keeping his head down and staying out of it, even if he privately detested Voldemort’s ideologies. That would be what most people would have done in his position, Marlene thought. But Sirius was brave and daring. He stood up and fought for what he believed in, even if it meant fighting against his own blood family.</p><p> </p><p>She looked at Sirius like he was a gallant knight out of a story book. He noticed. He noticed that she didn’t look at him any differently when she sat down at her first meeting and heard Dumbledore’s report that his brother was on the run. That all Order members were to keep eyes and ears out for Regulus Black because he might have information.</p><p> </p><p>So, Sirius thought, Regulus wasn’t just a death eater. He was a death eater who was extremely afraid of death and ran for the hills when he realized he wasn’t cut out of war.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Bigotry and Cowardice. That’s Reg. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Marlene still looked to him as if he actually knew what he was doing, despite the failings of his nearest blood relative. He kept waiting for her to realize he was rubbish but the realization just didn't happen.</p><p> </p><p>Still, he felt so ashamed as they left the meeting. He knew he was as supposed to be teaching her something or another but part of him wanted to tell her to just go home because he was pants at this anyhow. He didn’t. He couldn’t bring himself to dismiss her once she was right in front of him, smiling like a ray of sun through the clouds. The part of him that wanted to keep her with him won out.</p><p> </p><p>Warmth was the only thing Marlene had more of than than hair. It would have been easier for Sirius to ask Dumbledore to assign her to someone else if she hadn’t been so enjoyable to be around.</p><p> </p><p>It was still a little weird for him. It wasn’t like him to really enjoy being around teenage girls with sunny dispositions who burst into the room and tell him that he’s <em> exceptionally good looking </em>.</p><p> </p><p>That was because he hadn’t met any one particular girl who met that description before Marlene. It turned out he enjoyed Marlene quite a lot.</p><p> </p><p>She seemed like someone he would have been friends with had she been in his year. She had a mischievous streak that she didn’t even try to hide. It was just very easy to underestimate her trouble making abilities, since she was  far more adorable than your average delinquent.  She was still intensely Hufflepuffy, but they had a more natural and immediate good rapport than he had with Peter. And certainly than more-so than Lily with any them. But he conceded that the whole reason he was even decent enough to be friendly with this little sunbeam was because of Lily. Lily made all of them more decent. He was glad she’d decided James was worth the effort.</p><p> </p><p>He would have to say something eventually. He’d been standing there staring at Marlene like I’d been hit by a stunning curse for quite some time.</p><p> </p><p>“So uh… yeah I feel a little out of sorts after all that and I can’t think of what we should do. Um… do you… have any questions? Or anything?”</p><p> </p><p><em> Idiot</em>.</p><p> </p><p>He wondered why she didn’t realize she got cheated out of actual mentoring. He knew that it was likely she thought he had lovely grey eyes (this was a fair assessment. They were lovely.) but there was no reason at all, in his own opinion, to think he was capable of teaching anyone anything.</p><p> </p><p>“Are you feeling alright Sirius? You looked a bit sick back there. It must be awful for you. I can’t imagine.”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re… very kind Marlene. I’m alright. It’s just part of life for me. You’re lucky though. Your family...”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah. I suppose I am. I mean I’m the youngest and the least impressive of five. That hasn’t always been fun, but seeing what you live with has made me realize how lucky I am.”</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t know your siblings very well. Would it be terrible of me to say I’m quite a lot more impressed with you than I ever was with Grace? I had classes with her for 7 years and she isn’t… you’re different.”</p><p> </p><p>Grace McKinnon had just been part of the background noise for Sirius. She was, by all accounts, a decent person and a good student. She was order affiliated; like all the McKinnons. She was not anything to write home about. If one were going to write home at all, which Sirius didn’t.</p><p> </p><p>Marlene, in contrast to her sister, was <em>very </em> interesting. And very cute. He did have to write a report of how things were going with her for Dumbledore, but he would refrain from mentioning how cute he thought she was. That detail seemed both irrelevant and likely to reflect poorly on him as a mentor.</p><p> </p><p>“Well I am different. You have that right. But you’re probably the first person to think I’m more impressive. Grace is in healer training. Grace was a prefect. Grace is lovely. She isn’t… verbally clumsy...like me.”</p><p> </p><p>“Verbally Clumsy. That is a brilliant way of putting it. And I actually think that makes you more impressive? It’s… well...never mind. You’re my favorite McKinnon for sure.”</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> I could probably just stare at her all afternoon and soak up all that warmth. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>He knew that wouldn’t be a very useful lesson. He’d figure something out. Or else they’d just kill time until it became evident that nothing was getting taught today. It was strange but Sirius could deal with that.</p><p> </p><p>He’d rather have Marlene smiling at him than not. That was what it came down to.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>Sirius was not an impressive duelist, even under the best conditions. He was passing decent. Maybe. He tended to act on instinct rather than calculating his moves based on his opponents weaknesses.</p><p> </p><p>Even worse, he found that Marlene, he couldn’t muster any sort of impulse toward aggression. His dueling was just awful and it was, in his mind, all her fault.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Damn her and her annoying cute freckles and her irritatingly sweet smile. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>No one could be expected to send a curse at her with any kind of power behind it. Every instinct he had was more along the lines of “give the girl a hug” rather than “knock her on her arse”.</p><p> </p><p>“You don’t have to let me win Sirius! You know that won’t help me at all if I were to end up in a real battle.” She looked a little annoyed with him. Annoyed, but still excessively sweet.</p><p> </p><p>“Sorry. I wasn’t actually... It wasn’t intentional. I just can’t bring myself… what if I hurt you? You’re uh… really tiny and breakable.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m tougher than I look.”</p><p> </p><p>Marlene was telling the truth. It would have been impossible to grow up as the youngest of five and come away as the delicate little flower Sirius seemed to believe she was. She was a kindhearted Hufflepuff with a petite frame, but she also had the top marks in her year in Defense Against the Dark Arts. She didn’t need to be physically large in order to throw big spells.</p><p> </p><p>She was clearly gifted enough and had all the OWLs to apply to the ministry to be an auror, if she’d been of a mind to. She had a brother-in-law in the aurors even. Professor Sprout had been surprised bordering on disappointed that Marlene was not even considering a career in magical law enforcement.</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t that she was afraid of a fight or didn’t want to devote herself to taking down dark wizards, it was a matter of not wanting to work for the ministry.</p><p> </p><p>“How about we just go for disarming?”</p><p> </p><p>Marlene rolled her eyes. Sirius would have to get over this notion eventually. But she wouldn’t push him. For one thing, she thought it was very sweet that he was afraid of hurting her.</p><p> </p><p>She waffled over what that and every other little thing Sirius did might imply regarding his feelings towards her. She went over and over it, 30 times a day every day for at least the past week. She had no delusions that he didn’t know about her crush. Anyone who spent the least bit of time around the two of them would have known. It was not hard to spot. She was fairly certain that he didn’t find her entirely repulsive. He did seem to enjoy her company. That was a start.</p><p> </p><p>“Fine fine. But you have to really try to disarm me. No half hearted expelliarmus! I <em> will </em> notice and we will have words.”</p><p> </p><p>“Well I’d hate for us to have to <em> have words</em>.”</p><p> </p><p>His tone rang out <em> a little </em>flirtatious in his teasing. He only noticed when he saw the blush creeping up under Marlene’s freckles. She was more highly attuned to these little things than Sirius himself.</p><p> </p><p>Marlene brimmed with nervous excitement. </p><p> </p><p>Sirius was just plain nervous rather than excited. She already looked at him like he hung the moon. He felt he shouldn’t encourage her little crush.</p><p> </p><p>Except that he was really enjoying it.</p><p> </p><p>He went about his mental self flagellation, wondering what was wrong with him, how could he be so mean to egg her on like that…</p><p> </p><p>He questioned if he was really that much of an egotistical wanker that he’d encourage her in that direction because it was fun to have someone earnestly admire him like that.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Gross. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>On the the other hand, that was far preferable than the alternative<em>. </em>He could handle being an arse. Plenty of people would have said he was already doing a fine job there. He couldn’t handle the thought of his growing feelings for her. Feelings were a whole other level of gross.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Scary gross </em>
</p><p> </p><p>He took a breath and then a bow, to signify the start of this round of their duel. Soon he’d cast his expelliarmus and she’d thrown up her shield. Her shield which was quite sturdy.</p><p> </p><p>He tried casting an impediment jinx then immediately following it up with another disarming spell. But she ducked and shielded herself with more finesse than should have been possible for someone who tended to fall all over themselves in normal conversations.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Damn. She is… wow. Maybe she is tougher than she looks. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>It took a lot more moving in on her and rapid fire spells than he’d thought it would, but eventually he got her on her knees, with her wand in his hand. He doubted he’d be able to beat her in a year. She was surprisingly good with defensive magic. Maybe, he thought, her sweetness was more of a bonus than a drawback in that regard. Opponents would underestimate her. He would try not to underestimate her again.</p><p> </p><p>He felt it necessary, however, to take advantage of the full theatricality of a wizard's duel… He approached slowly, and got just a hair too close.</p><p> </p><p>“Do you yield?”</p><p> </p><p>He looked straight into her big brown eyes. From her knees she looked up at him with a hint of playfulness that felt, to Sirius, a bit… dangerous. She was fairly certain he was flirting and she was not backing down from the challenge. They were both having <em> far </em>too much fun with this show of a duel.</p><p> </p><p>“I yield. Do your very worst.”</p><p> </p><p>He couldn’t hold in his laughter as he pulled her up by the hand. He’d only meant to help her to her feet and return her wand but Marlene used the momentum to throw herself all the way into an embrace.</p><p> </p><p>The more Sirius was around Marlene, the less in control he felt. It wasn’t generally this fun for him to be ogled. He was <em> definitely </em>being ogled at that very moment.</p><p> </p><p>He knew he should probably do something to discourage it, but there he was, not letting go of her, getting lost in the warmth of her smile.</p>
