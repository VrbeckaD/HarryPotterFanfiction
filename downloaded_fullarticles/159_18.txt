James, Remus and Peter all raised their eyebrows and exchanged confused looks, none of them having any idea what could have brought about such an outburst. </p><p>It was just a normal Tuesday evening in the Gryffindor Tower; first years were panicking over due assignments, the fire was crackling and the Marauders were plotting. They had decided their next trick would be to transfigure all of Dumbledores robes into the latest muggle fashions, so naturally Sirius had been flicking through one of Marlene’s magazines for inspiration. That had been before the outburst. Now the three other boys were left just with a piece of parchment containing several question marks and the words ‘flared jeans’ and ‘tie dye’</p><p>“Whoah Sirius, slow down, you’ll run someone over.” Lily teased as the Black boy skidded to a stop in front of her. </p><p>“No time for that!” He cried as he frantically pointed to a picture in the magazine. “Have you seen this?”</p><p>Lily’s brows furrowed. “This? You mean the nail varnish?”</p><p>Sirius nodded his head as Lily laughed. “You’ve never seen nail varnish before?” </p><p>A couple of muggleborns near them giggled and Sirius raised his hands in a defensive stance.</p><p>“Hey it’s not my fault that pureblood families don’t go anywhere near muggle products.”</p><p>Lily bit her lip but she was still smiling. “Of course Sirius, you’re right, I’m sorry. I don’t have any here with me but I can owl my mother for some if you’d like?” </p><p>Sirius’ eyes widened. “You’d do that?” </p><p>Remus’ heart clenched a little. Sirius was still surprised when people did things for him with absolutely no ulterior motive. </p><p>Lily was already pulling out some ink and parchment. “Yeah of course. What colour would you like?”</p><p>Sirius’ face really was comical at this point. “There are different colours?”</p><p>Lily chuckled as she nodded her head. “Yeah, hmm let me see… how about I surprise you?” </p><p>Sirius leaned down and kissed her on the cheek. “Lily Evans I could marry you.” He proclaimed grandly. </p><p>James leaned over to Remus. “Mate, do you think we should be worried that your man just proposed to my girlfriend?”</p><p>Remus looked at where Sirius was now enveloping Lily in a hug. “Yeah.” He teased. “We should definitely be worried.”</p><p> </p><p>Remus’ studies were interrupted by his very excited boyfriend. </p><p>“Remus! Look at my nails!” </p><p>A pair of black painted nails were shoved right in his face and Remus actually had to catch Sirius’ wrist to move the hand in question slightly further away from his face so that he could actually see it. </p><p>“They’re really cool Pads.” He said grinning at the contagious excitement radiating off the boy in front of him. </p><p>“Lily says black is totally punk. They’ll go with my leather jacket, won’t they?”</p><p>Remus glances back down at his half finished essay and picked up his quill. “Yeah totally Pads.” He said, already starting to write again. He could hear Sirius moving around him but he had already zoned out – needing to finish this essay so he could get a head start on the rest of his work. Missing a few days every month wasn’t ideal, but Remus was lucky that teachers would let him know what they would be covering when he was out so that he could complete his assignments in advance. They had given him the option of catching up afterwards, but Remus preferred it this way; he already had enough to worry about without an intense workload on top of it. </p><p>He knew Sirius didn’t mind and that his boyfriend was happy enjoying his new accessories himself for a little while anyways. He was probably showing off to the entire common room. Scratch that – Remus knew his boyfriend – he was probably showing off to the entire school. </p><p>“Hey Moony.”</p><p>Remus glanced up from his essay to see Sirius standing in his leather jacket, clad in jeans so tight it was surely illegal, his hair half up, half down (in the way that Sirius knew drove Remus absolutely wild) and last but not least, the famous nails. </p><p>Remus’ mouth dried up. </p><p>“Wow Pads… you look… you look wow.”</p><p>Sirius smirked and strutted to Remus’ side. “I look hot.”</p><p>Remus huffed a laugh. “That’s an understatement.”</p><p>Sirius slid onto Remus’ lap and held his hands out so the pair could admire them as Sirius wiggled his fingers. “Nice, huh?”</p><p>Remus caught his hands and lifted them to his lips so he could press a gentle kiss there. “Very nice.” He agreed. He kissed his wrist, the crook of his elbow in that goddamn jacket, the soft skin where shoulder meets neck and finally, Remus kissed along Sirius’s jawline; he also knew what drove his boyfriend crazy – two could play at that game. </p><p>Sirius sighed and tilted his head so Remus would have better access but Remus pulled away and kissed his boyfriend on the lips just once before pushing him gently off his lap. </p><p>“I love you.” He said, highly amused at the indignant look of Sirius Black sitting on the floor. “But I need to finish my essay.”</p><p>Sirius rose. “Fine.” He announces as he flounced from the room, but he stuck out his tongue at Remus playfully as he left the room causing Remus to roll his eyes laughing. What a dork. </p><p>(His dork though). </p><p> </p><p>“Okay boys, the day has come.” James said slinging his arms around Peter and Remus as the Marauders all walked into the Great Hall together for dinner. “We’ve planned for this, are we all ready?”</p><p>“You bet your ass we’re ready.” Sirius chirped, sliding into his seat, the rest of them following suit. </p><p>“Let’s just review one more time.” Peter said, always the worrier. “So I’ll transfigure his hat, James and Sirius, you’ve got the robes – James you’re doing the top half and Sirius is taking the bottom, right?”</p><p>“Right.” They both confirmed. </p><p>“And Remus you’re doing the shoes.”</p><p>“Yup.” Remus said popping the ‘p’ as he poured them all a glass of pumpkin juice. “Remember;” He warned them, “We all have to do it at the same time, so what’s the signal?”</p><p>“When he stands to speak at the end.” The others said in sync, words slightly muffled by the food  they were now shoving into their mouths. Remus grinned. “We’re ready.”</p><p>The boys ate their dinner, relatively quietly as they all loaded their plates and exchanged secret, excited glances. This wasn’t one of their hardest pranks, not by a long shot but it was definitely one of their most daring. </p><p>“And now,” The headmaster said as he pushed back his chair and the hall fell into a silence. “For a few words.”</p><p>As one, the four boys cast the charm, wands swishing under the table, all aimed at Albus Dumbledore. </p><p>His tall wizards hat folded in on itself until it was a simple headband over his long loose hair. An oversized denim jacket now adored his arms and, by Merlin, even Remus was stunned by the crop top James had given him – eliciting many a gasp and giggle from the students. Where his long robes had been, now there were a pair of embroidered bell bottom jeans and the entire ensemble were topped off with a pair of sandals Remus was quite impressed with. </p><p>The entire hall fell into utter silence as Ms McGonagall stood up in outrage but Dumbledore simply looked down at his new outfit demurely. </p><p>“It’s always good to keep up with the latest trends.” He said without missing a beat, throwing a wink at the Marauders and sending the great hall into utter chaos. The four boys burst into laughter with them, filled with a mischievous delight as rumours already were sparking. </p><p>“Did you see his tattoo?” Remus heard one Ravenclaw ask and he actually nearly choked on his pumpkin juice. </p><p>McGonagall however was not quite as amused as her colleague. She appeared at the Gryffindor table in moments, looming over the Marauders. </p><p>“Hello Minnie darling.” Sirius said, donning his ‘innocent’ look. </p><p>“Detention, all of you.” She said, her face the picture of disapproval, but Remus was certain that he caught the hint of a smile on her face as she turned away. </p><p>The four boys exchanged looks before bursting into laughter once more. </p><p>“Totally worth it.”</p></div>
