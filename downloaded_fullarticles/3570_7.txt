    <p>He is standing in front of the door. It has been half an hour and he hasn’t done anything yet...He couldn’t make up his own mind to knock and come in the office. His hands are sweaty and his mind is racing. What is he doing here ? It is his last chance. The last resort, he tries to convince himself. Surely not, his pride seems to say. It couldn’t. It is.</p>
<p>He tries to breathe slowly, inhales and exhales thinking it might help. It doesn’t so he starts to walk back and forth. His heart is about to explode and his head aches.</p>
<p>"Malfoy ? What are you doing here ?"<br/> "Granger ! I...nothing."</p>
<p>Hermione Granger is looking at him suspiciously. He could read her thoughts in her gaze : the presence of Draco Malfoy is never a good sign.</p>
<p>"Are you here to meet Harry ? she says, like it’s the most unlikely reason she could think of."<br/> "Actually..." he starts.</p>
<p>Draco stops...Is he ready for this ?</p>
<p>"YesIamheretomeetpotter...he mumbles."<br/> "What ? Sorry I didn’t hear what you said."</p>
<p>He coughs to clear his throat. His cheeks are burning and humiliation makes his heart pound loudlier than ever. His eyes meets Granger’s. And he can't help but feel nauseous.</p>
<p>"Yes, I’m here to meet Potter."<br/> "What for ? "<br/> "Mind your own business, would you ? "</p>
<p>Granger looks at him for a second. A spark in her eyes tells him he should be careful. She wouldn’t hesitate to punch him again. He takes a step back. She smirks.</p>
<p>"No need to be rude. Wait here."</p>
<p align="center">* * * *</p>
<p>"Hermione ! Come in. How are you ? "<br/> "Pretty good. I came to talk to you about the stolen artefacts in Newcastle and about your niece you haven't seen since Christmas and who misses you. But we’ll talk about it later. Do you know you have Draco Malfoy waiting for you at the door ? "<br/> "Malfoy ? What is he doing here ? "<br/> "Don’t ask me. He wouldn’t tell me. He just barked at me with this nasty look of him."</p>
<p>Harry was lost in thought for a moment. It’s been a while since he has met Malfoy.</p>
<p>"You know, you should probably let him in. It might be important. He looked a mess. Like he hasn't shaved or showered for a long time" Hermione says.<br/> "I wonder what he is up to."<br/> "It's Malfoy we're talking about. It could be anything."<br/> "Yeah, that's what worries me. I actually haven't seen him since the war."</p>
<p>Silence fills the room. Hermione watches anxiety written all over Harry’s face.</p>
<p>"I owe him my life...in a way" Harry finally says.<br/> "You don't owe him anything. He made his own choice and he did some pretty ugly things too."<br/> "I know. But I always thought he was kind of a victim."<br/> "A victim ? Are you out of your mind ? He chose to take Voldemort's side" Hermione shouts.</p>
<p>Hermione rubs her arm. Harry takes a look at the word 'mudblood' engraved on her skin : a little souvenir from Malfoy's family.</p>
<p>"He was forced to make that choice. He had to protect his family. In other circumstances…"<br/> "Since when are you the advocate of Draco Malfoy ? " Hermione asks.</p>
<p>She was angry and Harry knew the wound the Malfoys inflicted her has not healed yet. Even after all this time she was resentful. The idea of victimizing Draco was unbearable.</p>
<p>"I’m not. The war ended five years ago and it allows me to think with a fresh perspective."</p>
<p>Harry stands up and walks towards the door. He hesitates for a second and finally opens it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">* * * *</p>
<p>"Malfoy."<br/> "Potter."<br/> "Come in."</p>
<p>Draco Malfoy's eyes look into Granger's and he can feel the tension in the air. She looks furious but she remains silent.</p>
<p>His jaw contracts.</p>
<p>"Potter, can I talk to you...alone ?"<br/> "Whatever you have to say, you can say it in front of Hermione."</p>
<p>He sighs. So predictable. They have always been inseparable, even at Hogwarts. Potter, his Weasel and the Mudblood.</p>
<p>"Fine."</p>
<p>Potter sits on his chair on the other side of the desk. And waits. Draco wants to take his time. He only has one shot.</p>
<p>"Malfoy, I don't have all day. What are you doing here ?"<br/> "I am here to offer you my help."</p>
<p>Potter blinks and refrains from laughing. Draco ignores it, smirking to hide his humiliation.</p>
<p>"Your help ?"</p>
<p>Draco stays calm but his head is exploding. He takes a deep breath to make sure his voice is steady and doesn't come out shaking.</p>
<p>"I heard that you are struggling with the Newcastle case."<br/> "How do you know that ? "<br/> "I have my sources."</p>
<p>Draco pauses and waits for Potter’s reaction.</p>
<p>"Well, it does not concern you whatsoever."<br/> "True."</p>
<p>The young man tries to fake confidence hoping Granger and Potter can’t see his despair.</p>
<p>"But I recognize dark arts when I see it."<br/> "Don't worry about it, Malfoy, we can see it too. Who do you think we are ? My team knows how to do their job."<br/> "I don't doubt it. But..."</p>
<p>Potter is becoming impatient.</p>
<p>"Malfoy, spit it out for God's sake."<br/> "I am the only one that can infiltrate the network you are trying, and failing, to dismantle."</p>
<p>Once again, Potter blinks. He opens his mouth to say something but chooses to shut it instead. He seems to think. And slowly, he says.</p>
<p>"Let me get this straight...you want to work for me ?"</p>
<p>Draco's heart skips a beat. Nauseous, he finds it hard to swallow.</p>
<p>"I want to help you."<br/> "Why ? "<br/> "Because I pity you", Draco says, smirking again.<br/> "You know you’re supposed to convince me, not insult me."</p>
<p>He feels anger rising and altering his judgment. He tries not to look at Potter, this arrogant little Auror, who always thinks he is better than anyone else. If he loses his temper now, he is screwed.</p>
<p>Anxious, his hands are shaking. He is so pathetic, Draco thinks to himself. He rakes his fingers through his blond hair and runs them all over his face. He feels his beard on the palm of his hand. Gosh, he looks like a mess, like a homeless person.</p>
<p>How could he let that happen ? Now, he needs to beg for a job to Potter. Potter ! His father would have killed him if he was still alive.</p>
<p>"Malfoy ?"<br/> "Fine. One of my oldest friends, from Hogwarts, a pureblood wizard…"</p>
<p>Next to him, Granger hold her breath. She hates this word.</p>
<p>"He comes from a good family, one of the best. And we kept in touch...you know after the war," Draco says.<br/> "So what ?" Granger says angrily. "You’re buddies and all. That’s great. What does it have to do with the Newcastle case ?"</p>
<p>Draco breathes to slow down the pace of his heartbeat.</p>
<p>"He came to me a few days ago saying he can sell me some...objects. At first, he wouldn’t tell me what they were, he was cautious and he didn’t know if he could trust me. But I was curious so I said I was my father’s son…"<br/> "Like it makes you trustworthy," Granger says, laughing.<br/> "Hermione…" Potter starts to say.<br/> "Well, in my world, my father was very respected and for better or for worse, I’m his son so yes, for some people, not your kind obviously, it makes me trustworthy."</p>
<p>Silence fills the room. Potter looks as tired as him. And it’s only eight in the morning. Draco looks around and see Potter’s old broom on the right corner. A nostalgic feeling emerges. Their rivalry over Quidditch was so simple and naive in many ways. After all these years, and what happened, it now just seems shallow.</p>
<p>"Finish your story, Malfoy."<br/> "My friend told me the artefacts once belonged to...you-know-who," he says with disgust.<br/> "Voldemort !" Potter and Granger shout in unison.</p>
<p>Draco Malfoy quivers. He hasn’t heard this name since the war. His touches the mark under his shirt. His skin is burning. The sound of this name makes his body shiver and weaken. His knees are about to faint so he sits.</p>
<p>"But why ?" Granger asks.</p>
<p>Draco turns to look at her. She doesn’t even look angry anymore. Just curious and confused.</p>
<p>"Why what ?" He replies.<br/> "I don’t understand. Your family bragged for years to be close to Voldemort, to be pureblood wizards. Collecting dark arts artefacts always has been a hobby of yours. Why do you want to help us now ?"</p>
<p>Draco dives his eyes into Granger’s and he hesitates for a moment. Does he have to be honest ? Lying has always been the easiest way to get what he needed. That’s how he was raised. He bites his lips. He claims he wants to change his life, to be a better man. For her. This is for her. Draco sighs. It’s time to do things differently. He clears his throat to undo the knot.</p>
<p>"My daughter, Elena. Her mother died 4 years ago and since the war I haven’t been able to find or to keep a job. Nobody wants to hire a former death eater. Especially me. The other ones are either in Azkaban or dead. I am the only one left. And I’m the pariah of the wizard world."</p>
<p>He stops. Out of breath. He hasn’t told anyone before and it feels so unnatural to bare his life to Potter and Granger.</p>
<p>He looks up and expects to see a taunting smile on their faces but they look serious. Almost caring. He feels nauseous again. But now there’s no turning back.</p>
<p>"Anyway, I need money to take care of her."</p>
<p>Humiliation just slapped him several times. He feels dizzy.</p>
<p>"Why don’t you sell stolen objects yourself ?"<br/> "Hermione !" Potter looks shocked.<br/> "What ? The Malfoys are not known for their integrity or their goodness. If you want money, why don’t you work at the dark market?" She asks.</p>
<p>The logic behind the words almost makes him laugh.</p>
<p>"I don’t want this life anymore. I don’t want any of what I have been through to happen to my daughter. She deserves a normal life."</p>
<p>After a minute of silence, Potter is the first one to speak.</p>
<p>"Okay, so what’s your plan ?"</p>
<p>Granger looks at his friend, surprised. But his eyes are staring at Draco’s.</p>
