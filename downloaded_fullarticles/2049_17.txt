  <strong>Beautiful Nightmare</strong>
</p><p>
  <em>Prologue</em>
</p><p>Harry Potter was in full-blown denial of his current predicament.</p><p>He was completely concealed by his invisible cloak, crouched low in some random dark corner, along with a random hallway in Hogwarts Castle, School of Wizard and Witchcraft. At that moment, his current location completely escaped him, even though he could recall it only a few minutes before.</p><p>His skin was heated and sweat damped it. The cloak was almost unbearable to stay under, but he didn’t dare remove it for fear of the consequences of being discovered in such a state.  His breath came out in wet gasps as he tried to get his body under control, but there was no fighting mother nature. Especially when she went out of her way to <em>help</em> even though most would always think her cruel and unkind, she did try. After all, as far as Harry’s slowly dwindling mind can comprehend, he was blessed <em>alone. </em></p><p>Harry shook his head to clear it, but only succeeded in making the world spin. He gaged on bile and swallowed it down with a painful gulp before his wet mouth fell open to pant. His skin was becoming even <em>more heated</em>, and Harry knew it would only get worse from this point on.</p><p>But still, he couldn’t face the truth, even as his own body betrayed him and screamed it.</p><p>So, he huddled on the floor, trembling in heated fever as he slowly suffocated on his own sickly sweet scent.</p><p>Harry needed to move, he needed to remove himself from this too public yet completely deserted hallway and find a safe cool place to ride it out-<em>Or a Mate, </em>his mind rudely interrupted.</p><p><strong><em>No. </em></strong>Harry shook his dark head fiercely and even snapped his neck back to bang it on the wall behind him in his attempt to remove such disturbing thoughts.</p><p>It didn’t really matter what he wanted though, Harry was beginning to realize and for a moment he was utterly paralyzed by his own despair. <em>He didn’t want <strong>this</strong></em>, Harry wailed in his mind, shaking and trembling, tears welled in his eyes and he squeezed them shut with gritted teeth. <em>Why was it always <strong>him!? </strong></em>Harry gripped his cloak with clawed hands and choked on a sob. <em>He just wanted to be normal. Was that really too much to ask for? </em>Harry had only ever wanted one thing in his life, and it seemed the more he lived out his days the more that simple wish was pushed away, never to be reached.</p><p>It seemed Harry Potter was never meant to be normal. From the moment he was birth from his Omega mother Lily Potter, his fate had been sealed. The world seemed determined to take, take and take from him, all the while laughing as he was forced to adapt to ever hurtle that was thrown at him. He felt like some greater being took dark amusement in how his life always seemed to twist and turn dangerously, leaving Harry always feeling unstable and wary.</p><p>And now <em>this.</em></p><p>Harry James Potter, Prophesied defeater of the Dark Lord, and therefore the boy who <em>must </em>live, was coming into his secondary sex as an Omega Male.</p><p>Of course, he couldn’t be the Beta that he had all but prayed to be. He hadn’t even dare think that he was capable enough to be an Alpha like most had speculated.</p><p>No.</p><p>Fate saw fit to kick him in the balls and bring to life an option he hadn’t even <em>thought possible. </em></p><p>Now Harry sat alone, in an abandoned hallway as his body slowly moved through the first stage of presenting as an Omega; Pre-heat.</p><p>He had no clue what to expect. He had no idea what being male, and an omega would even <em>mean. </em>Harry hadn’t really pay attention to the secondary sex education class that all students were forced to sit through during second year. All the facts, tests and projects were suddenly fuzzy and distant, and he just didn’t know anything.</p><p><em>I’m Scared</em>, Harry thinks with trembling fingers. This was no enemy he could fight with his wand or even his fist. This was his body, and it was more aware of itself than Harry was of it, and he never felt so disconnected. He rocked himself with wide fevered eyes staring blankly at nothing. Sweat dripped down from his temple and stung them, but even then he didn’t dare to blink. He sat there and a dark trance as his secondary sex begun the process of awakening itself in his body.</p><p>No matter how much he silently pleaded and protest, thinking <em>I don’t want this, Why me?, Stopstopstopstopstopstopstopstopstopstoptstopstopstopstopstopstopstopstopstopstopstopstopstops<strong>STOP!</strong></em></p><p>His body paid him no heed and continued on.</p>
