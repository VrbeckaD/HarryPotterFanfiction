    <p>Hoseok thinks he might have broken his jaw. There’s a heavily starched envelope in his left hand, complete with a wax seal and writing in some medieval cursive. In his right hand, there’s a piece of really ancient looking parchment.</p><p>
  <i> Dear Jung Hoseok,</i><br/>
<i> We are pleased to inform you that you have a place at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all the necessary books and equipment.</i><br/>
<i>Term beings on 1 September.</i><br/>
<i>We await your owl no later than 31 July.</i><br/>
</p><p>
  <i>Yours Sincerely,</i><br/>
<i>Minerva McGonagall</i><br/>
<i>Deputy Headmistress </i><br/>
</p><p>	There’s an equally fancy signature signed with something that’s definitely not a ballpoint pen, and Hoseok somehow finds it in himself to turn to face his mother. Madam Jung is reading the letter over his shoulder with an equally befuddled expression. There’s a very heavy silence in the Jung household, until a slight cough breaks it and both mother and son turn to look at the messenger, a stern lady in maroon robes. </p><p>	“My name is Madam Aquila, I am a staff member at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. I am here to explain everything you need to know. As you can tell from the letter, Mr Jung Hoseok is a wiz- ma’am please I’m telling the truth! Ma’am-”<br/>
</p><p> Hoseok watches in awe as his mother rolls up her sleeves and picks up the nearest household object- a mop, and begins to brandish it in earnest at the lady. There are screams of “you think I can’t see through scams, you kidnapper!” and “no ma’am you misunderstand! Look I can show you!” as the two women being to run in earnest around the living room. But even with the havoc ongoing around him, Hoseok takes this chance to glance down at the letter again, letting the words fully sink in. </p><p>	A small smile creeps onto the little eleven-year-old’s face and as much as all these seem so utterly unbelievable, Hoseok cannot help but feel incredibly at peace, as though everything had fallen in place. He’s magic. And he’s known it all along honestly, deep down.</p>
<hr/><p>	It takes a while longer and some actual <i>real! magic!</i> before Hoseok’s mom finally calms down and begins to take in the unbelievable. The lady witch is incredibly patient, obviously having dealt with this many times before, and wastes no time in dealing out the facts and giving the Jungs just enough time to process and digest everything. They set a date for Sunday at noon, where the nice lady witch would bring the Jungs along on a shopping trip to ‘dragon alley’, Hoseok hears, and that’s enough to send the child over the moon.He had been worried enough about high school and all the horrors he had heard about while he was still in middle school, but this just seems to be too grand an upgrade from the public high school he was intending to go for.</p><p>	His mind is wandering now, what sorts of magic he’d be able to do at this grand new school, the people he’d meet and perhaps even, dragons? He’s done small, strange things before, like vanishing the school bully’s pants and vaulting (or was it flying?) over a high garden fence when the neighbour’s dog had it in for him. All those strange incidents and accidents... everything makes sense now. His excitement is almost tangible, before someone places a hand on his shoulder which startles him out of his daydreams.</p><p>	“Hoseok, I will see you on Sunday, and we’ll buy everything you need for school, alright?” Madam Aquila asks him very kindly, a small amused smile flickering over her features. It’s always incredibly precious to see muggleborn children finding out that they are magic- the parents are usually shell-shocked, but the children are always the first to accept the fact, and incredibly eager to find out more. Her warm smile doesn’t help Hoseok calm down and he’s nearly bouncing on his seat at this point.</p><p>	“Of course!” he chirps, and his mother can’t help but bite back a smile. Everything’s going to change now.</p>
