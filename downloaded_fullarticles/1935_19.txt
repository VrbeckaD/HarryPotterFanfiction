    <p>Helena awoke shivering to the feeling of sore muscles against the cold ground.</p><p>She blearily looked around herself, and noticed that she was in the middle of a forest. All her worldly possessions seemed to be scattered around her, her school books, potion ingredients, her entire wardrobe, some pieces of furniture; most of those broken.</p><p>it seemed like someone took everything in Grimmauld place – including its library, kitchen utensils and everything else you could think off – and just dumped it in a forest somewhere. Even more strangely, all her money – all of which is supposed to be in Gringotts – seemed to be distributed across the small clearing where she lay.</p><p><em>Alright, how did I get here?</em> she thought, feeling dazed.</p><p>After that she noticed, with some degree of alarm, that she was completely naked.</p><p>
  <em>Helena, you stupid girl, what sort of trouble have you gotten your gotten yourself into this time?</em>
</p><p>She tried to remember how she ended up here but came up blank. The last thing she could remember was Hermione taking her to Honeydukes for some catching up. She went home after that, somewhat drunk but not nearly enough to have let to <em> this</em>. After that… nothing.</p><p>Her friend had felt guilty, thinking that she had been neglecting her. After the war, Ron and Hermione took some time off to enjoy their new relationship. Helena felt they more than deserved it after the year – years really – that they had, and gave them space.</p><p>She tried to reach for her wand to cast a Fire-Making Charm on some of the broken furniture for some heat, but to further alarm, found her hand brushing against her naked thigh. <em>Oh yea, no clothes.</em></p><p>She thoroughly searched the area for her wand, finding and putting on some clothes in the process. She found the pants that she had worn last night, but didn't find her wand in its pocked.</p><p>After an hour of searching she gave up. During her search she did find some other interesting things.</p><p>She found the broken pieces of her old Firebold which she had lost when fleeing the Death Eaters with Hagrid on Sirius's motorbike.<br/>
She found her survival kid; the same survivals kit that she took with her on her Horcrux hunt along with all the food provisions they still had left over.</p><p>Lastly, she found what looked to be a big rock that was obviously man-made. The surface was smooth and gleamed red light, sort of like the rubies in the hourglass where the house points for Gryffindor were stored. Faint blue lines covered its surface like vines. She could sense that it was magical, but not its precise purpose.</p><p>Helena found herself strangely fascinated with it but couldn't figure out why. She would show it to Profess– uhm, Headmistress McGonagall and see what she made of it.</p><p>Interestingly enough, her invisibility cloak was the only thing she owned that she didn't find.</p><p><em>Well, the thing is immune to most spells, so I guess whatever brought me here didn't effect it.</em>, She mused.</p><p><em>Okay, now what?</em>, the young witch thought, feeling much more awake now.</p><p>Without her wand, there were precious few magics available to her. She had some limited skill in Occlumency, could brew potions with the ingredients she had with her, and still had her Animagus form, but not much else. If she got herself worked up enough she might be able to force some 'accidental' magic, but that was unreliable at best.</p><p>
  <em>First, I need to find civilization, from there I can try to find my way back.</em>
</p><p>xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</p><p>After collecting all her stuff that wasn't broken, she turned herself into her dog Animagus form – a husky with dark fur on her back, white everywhere else, and bright green eyes – and started running through the forest.</p><p>As a dog she could go faster and not be as hindered by any flora and, barring her eyesight, had far superior senses. She was also a lot warmer thanks to her tick fur.</p><p>After about an hour of traveling she started to pick up a briny smell that reminded her of the sea. Thinking that her chance of finding humans were higher near water, she chose to stay close to the shore once she found it.</p><p>During that first night among the trees she got her first sign that returning home might not be as easy as she had first thought.</p><p><em>I recognize none those constellations</em>, she thought, perplexed, as she looked up into the night sky. At Hogwarts, they had studied the stars intensively, so even if she was on the other side of the planet she should still recognize some of them.</p><p>For two days she traveled as a dog. Turning back into a human only to eat. She could, if she wanted, hunt for her own food as an animal but she knew that once she turned back into a human the memory of what she had done as a dog would have made her ill.</p><p>She had enough food stored in her bag for over a month in any event. Whenever she stopped, she took out the magical rock out of her bag and tried to learn more about it and, more importantly, why she was so fascinated by it. So far she had no success. She knew what a compulsion charm felt like, but this wasn't that.</p><p>xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</p><p>Helena smelled the city before she saw it. The smell of fish grew thicker and was now accompanied by the smell of humans and other even less pleasant scents.</p><p><em>This doesn't look like a modern city.</em>, Helena wondered as she stood on a rocky outcrop to get a better view.</p><p>The city was encircled by a giant white wall – 30 feet by her best estimate. Its smooth surface was broken by two iron portcullises, one facing the western sea, the other opening south to a road that followed a river leading into the forest.</p><p>Rising above the wall she could see a huge structure build of giant stones and turrets. At the top of the building she could see what looked to be a lighthouse. It wasn't illuminated right now since the sun was up so she couldn't be sure.</p><p>What really tipped her of that something wasn't normal were the guards – actual guards! – standing watch at both gates. More specifically their attire, they were both wearing what looked to be chain mail taking straight out of a medieval war museum.</p><p>None of this made any sense. Isolated pockets of human cultures may yet exist on Earth but nothing this big. They also seemed to have a pale skin color, making it even more unlikely.</p><p>It was around this time that Helena began to seriously consider the possibility that she was an entirely different world or dimension than the one she was used to. It wouldn't even be the weirdest thing that has ever happened to her, though it would probably make her top three.</p><p><em>Regardless, I will probably be able to find answers in the city</em>, Helena thought, and she strode towards the gate by the road.</p><p><em>On the bright side, I will probably not stand out so mush with my complexion and robes. This is probably the first time I have ever been thankful for how old fashioned wizarding fashion is</em>, she thought with some amusement.</p><p>When she made her way to the gate one of the guards stopped her with a hand gesture.</p><p>"And who are you miss? And what were ye thinking traveling alone on the road?" He asked. The man had a slight American accent, Helena noted.</p><p>"I am Helena Potter, and why wouldn't it be okay for me to travel alone?" Helena asked, hoping to get an idea of how dangerous this area was.</p><p>The guard raised an eyebrow in incredulity as if he couldn't believe that she needed to ask</p><p>"Not safe for a woman alone on the road lady, especially not in these times. Urgals been acting up, attacking trading caravans and travelers. Even heard rumors of entire villages up North being sacked by the creatures."</p><p>Helena had no clue what Urgals were, but she didn't want to draw more attention to herself by advertising her ignorance on the matter. "Well I thank you for your concern and I will be sure to take better care in the future good sir," Helena answered the man, putting on her best winning smile.</p><p>"Your welcome miss," the guard said, "And just what business do you have in Teirm anyway." The guard challenged, more gruffly then he intended Helena guessed by his slight wince.</p><p>"Just visiting family," Helena told the first lie that she could think of.</p><p>"Oh well, carry on then I suppose," the guard waved her through. She didn't think he necessarily believed her, but rather he just didn't want to bother her anymore, and didn't consider her dangerous enough to make trouble. <em>Ha! If only he knew.</em></p><p>xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</p><p>Helena decided that she should first find a place to stay. It wasn't difficult to find an inn. The people of Teirm where used to travelers and to being asked for directions.</p><p>She ended up at one of the nicer parts of the city at an inn called 'The Rusty Sea Eagle'. It looked to be a three-story building with white stone and walls that looked well maintained.</p><p>As she entered the house, the man behind the counter looked up at her.</p><p>He was cleaning some glasses that didn't even look dirty to her eyes. <em>I wonder if barkeepers really have to spend that much time cleaning their glasses or if they just need something to do when sitting behind a counter all day</em>, she mused.</p><p>She noticed that there were a couple of other customers sitting at tables around the room but they didn't pay her any mind and she was glad to return the favor.</p><p>"Can I help you, young lady?" Asked the bartender distractedly, not pausing his work.</p><p>"Yes, I'd like to rent a room?" Helena asked in a quiet voice.</p><p>"How long ye recon you'll be staying?" The bartender inquired, not unkindly.</p><p>"I would like to pay for a week, but I might decide to extend it."</p><p>"That'll be four crown miss, breakfast included."</p><p>Helena obviously didn't carry any of the local currency but she hoped he would accept galleons. They <em>were</em> made of gold after all.</p><p>She took out one of the gold coins and put them on the counter.</p><p>"Will this suffice?" she asked.</p><p>The man's eyes bulged momentarily. He quickly put away the glass he had been cleaning and offered her his full attention now. His lips curving into what even she could tell was a fake smile. She liked his previous casual but pleasant expression better.</p><p>"That will do nicely yes," he said as he reached for a cabinet behind the counter and retrieved a silver colored key.</p><p>"Thank you," Helena said as she took the key from the man.</p><p>"Second floor, end of the hall of the left. Now, my name is Seben, if there is anything I can do for you do not hesitate to ask."</p><p>The man obviously thought her a rich foreign girl, possibly noble born, and was trying to be extra helpful in the hope that she would spend more money here, or give a generous tip.</p><p><em>Well he isn't exactly wrong, I am a rich foreign girl.</em> She thought about it for a moment and decided she did need to know something.</p><p>"Actually, do you know where I might be able to get information?" she asked.</p><p>"Information?" the now named Seben repeated.</p><p>"Maps, history, books and such," Helena clarified.</p><p>"I suppose you might look up Jeod Longshanks. Nice fellow by all accounts, though I don't know him myself. Everyone knows that he has a rather impressive collection of books. Suppose he might be willing to let you look at them for a fee. He has been having some money trouble lately, and he could probably use the extra income," the man advised.</p><p>Helena thanked the man and went up to her room to get settled.</p><p>xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</p><p>Jeod seemed to be a very well-known individual and was easy to find.</p><p>The man had no problem sharing his library with her for a small fee. She suspected that if he wasn't having money problems he would have refused to take payment at all. He seemed glad somebody was finally taking an interest in his collection.</p><p>Jeod's library was a goldmine of information. Turns out that she was in a city called Teirm on a continent named Alagaësia. The name didn't sound familiar.</p><p><em>Well that settles it. I am in another world,</em>'' Helena thought morosely. She had suspected, but to have it confirmed…</p><p>She had never heard of magic being capable of such a thing, but when you have lived her life you just sort of learned to accept that these things are in fact possible when they happen.</p><p>She wanted to get back home, of course, and decided that to do that she needed to find whatever passed for magicals in this world.</p><p>Surprisingly, the existence of magic was well known to even those that didn't possess it. Magicians lived among normal people and were looked upon with suspicion yes, but also respect. Sadly, most magicians seemed to answer to Galbatorix, the king of these lands.</p><p>A tyrant if there ever was one. He allegedly betrayed his own comrades in a brutal grab for power and he seemed to care noting for his own people; judging by how he wasn't taking any effort to defend them from the Urgals in the north, in what people had started to call the 'Norther massacre'. Jeod told her he made an effort to destroy any literature that painted him a negative light and came down hard on any sign of dissent.</p><p>Since the king seemed to be trying to recruit any magicals he found to his side she had no intention to draw attention to herself, which made contacting any other magicals a difficult prospect.</p><p>She could go to Surda; a small country that had split off from Galbatorix' empire where she would hopefully find magicals with no connection to the king.</p><p>Another option seemed to be the Elves.</p><p>By the stories these books told, these weren't the domesticated house elf's that she knew of in the wizarding world, but seemed to resemble more the Elves from muggle fantasy literature. Extremely long lived, beautiful, mysterious, lived in forests and - most importantly for her - were very adapt at magic.</p><p>Sadly for her, they also seem to have gone into hiding ever since Galbatorix took power, so they would be difficult to find. She knew that they were reported to live somewhere in the forests of 'Du Weldenvarden' in the north eastern corner of the continent, but she knew that those capable of magic had ways to avoid being found if they didn't want to be.</p><p><em>They still seem to be my best hope of discovering a way back home though,</em>' Helena thought. <em>Although. . .</em> A part of felt dirty at the thought of leaving this land with such an obvious evil praying on people.</p><p>xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</p><p>Her research took several days.</p><p>She chose to spent what time she wasn't using to peruse Jeod's library on familiarizing herself with the city and its people and generally getting a feel of the place. They seemed to be having some troubles with trade being disrupted by Urgals, a violent hairy warlike race with horns so she learned, and pirates making life difficult for those who relied on the sea for their livelihood, like Jeod. The mood in the city was definitely sullen.</p><p>Still, Helena enjoyed exploring the city. Being a trade city, it had news, stories, and goods from all over the world and she enjoyed spending time among people that didn't immediately recognize her.</p><p>Since Teirm was so used to travelers and traders passing through, nobody payed her much attention. It was liberating in a way. <em>And exciting.</em></p><p>xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</p><p>Like every evening for the past week she found herself in her room in 'The rusty sea eagle'.</p><p>She had taken to looking through the books of the Black library looking for magics that she could still do without a wand.</p><p>There were some rituals that she could do but didn't want to do, since most of them involved making sacrifices that she was unwilling to make.</p><p>The book had some information on wandless magic, but warned that casting without a wand was often volatile and could only be accomplished by the most powerful and skilled wizards and witches. She knew that she was more powerful than most. She was never as smart, knowledgeable, or skilled as Hermione, but she did have power. It would have to do.</p><p>She had been practicing every evening with mixed results. She could somewhat reliably get her cushion to fly and after a few tries could magically lock her room shut. When she tried to cast a severing charm however she accidentally made a painful cut in her own index finger. She resolved to not try any hexes or curses for foreseeable future after that.</p><p>It was as she was practicing the lumos spell – a harmless enough spell that wouldn't blow up in her face if she got it wrong, Helena hoped – that she got startled by a squeaking sound coming from somewhere in her room.</p><p>She turned to where she heard the noise and found the red stone. She had placed it on the nightstand right beside her bed and had been studying the thing on and off for the past week when she could find the time.</p><p>She put her ear to the stone and could hear something moving inside.</p><p><em>Not a stone at all: an egg</em>, Helena surmised.</p><p>Helena knew of only one creature that had an egg that size: a dragon. Though as far as she knew, dragon eggs required a lot of heat to hatch.</p><p>For the next hour she fretted about the egg with worry, as she imagined what trouble a newborn dragon could cause her. Helena well remembered Norberta and how she had nearly set Hagrid's hut on fire.</p><p>Helena anxiously looked around at her mostly wooden room.</p><p>Not to mention that she had no idea how to explain how she got a dragon if it were discovered.</p><p>Eventually, the egg started wobbling followed by cracks appearing all over its surface.</p><p>After another set of particularly large squeaks, a small head poked out of the egg, quickly followed by the rest of its body.</p><p>To the witch's surprise, this dragon had a pair of forelegs.</p><p>Helena only knew of four legged dragons due to a small mention in 'Fantastic beasts and where to find them'. Those dragons were long since extinct on earth and lived on only in stories and legend.</p><p>The dragon was about as long as her forearm and was covered in a grey slimy fluid that came from the egg, but it held a bearing that somehow made it seem grand and majestic. Its scales where the same ruby color as the egg's. Its wings were several times longer than its body. The head was triangular in shape and she noticed two white fangs protruding from its upper jaw. There where small spikes that ran down the dragon's spine from its head all the way to its tail; not dissimilar to the Hungarian Horntail that she had to outfly in her fourth year at Hogwarts.</p><p>The dragon turned to her with warm orange eyes that shined with an intelligence that no newborn creature was supposed to have.</p><p>With a happy squeak the dragon moved in her direction.</p><p>Helena hurriedly moved to catch the dragon before it tumbled of the nightstand and hurt itself.</p><p>The moment her right hand touched the dragon, a bolt of raw power shot through her hand, flew up her arm and into the rest of her body. She felt it burning her, changing her somehow.</p><p>She fell on the floor with a scream of pain and was unable to move for a while. When she collected herself she found the dragon's eyes staring into hers. She felt a surge of concern for herself... what?</p><p>She examined the feeling and found that it didn't belong to her but to the dragon. Somehow, their minds were linked.</p><p>She felt she should be feeling alarmed at this, considering her history, but she couldn't muster any emotion besides wonder.</p><p>A heavy knocking sound came from the door.</p><p>"My lady, are you alright?" She heard Seben yell from behind the door.</p><p>Hoping that the dragon could feel her thoughts as she could feel its, she tried to convey a need for it to be silent for a moment.</p><p>"Nothing to worry about, I just... stubbed my toe," Helena uttered in a strained voice.</p><p>"Well... okay, I got some numbing herbal remedy stashed away if you need it," he offered.</p><p>"It's okay, it already doesn't hurt anymore," Helena tried to reassure him. To the witch's relief, he left after that.</p><p>After a few moments, she tried to mentally tell the dragon that it didn't need be as quiet anymore.</p><p>The dragon proceeded to explore her room and she could sense its curiosity about everything that caught its attention.</p><p>Suddenly she heard a rumbling noise from the dragon. It looked around itself wildly trying to find the source of the sound.</p><p><em>Adorable,</em>, Helena thought, making the typical female Aww sound for all things cute.</p><p>Guessing that the rumbling noise came from the dragon's stomach, she retrieved a piece of dried meat from her Mokeskin pouch.</p><p>The moment she pulled it out, the dragon's head snapped to it, and she could now feel its hunger through their link.</p><p>The dragon's head snapped the piece of meat out of her hand when it came within its range.</p><p>She could see it tearing at it with its rough tongue and made a note to herself never to let the dragon lick her.</p><p>Her situation had just become vastly more complicated she knew, but looking at the red dragon happily munching away, she couldn't find it in herself to bothered.</p><p>When she went to bed, the dragon climbed up into the bed with her and cuddled into her side.</p><p>
  <em>No, I don't mind this at all.</em>
