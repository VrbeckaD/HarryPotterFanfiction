    <p>Sam frowned as he laid on the couch in Bobby’s living room. He couldn’t sleep. Again. Not that it was out of the ordinary for him these days, but that didn’t mean it sucked any less. It had been hard for him to sleep ever since he had to bury Dean a few weeks ago. Every time he closed his eyes, he could see Dean getting dragged to Hell by those hellhounds, hear his screams. It meant that he was obviously not getting any sleep. And he was starting to feel it. Hard. Maybe he needed to leave Bobby’s and get back on the road. Find something to fill his time with. But what?</p>
<p>Did he really want to hunt again, alone? He thought about Dean’s Impala, his <em>father’s</em> Impala just hanging out in Bobby’s yard. It pained him to think that their car would just sit there forever, rotting away. But it pained him even more to think about driving it around without his brother.</p>
<p>He sighed, sitting up from his position on the couch. There was no way he was going to get to sleep tonight. He might as well stop pretending. He rubbed his chin where he was starting to sport a beard to rival Bobby’s. He stood up to make his way to the bathroom. The house was dark and quiet, the only light was what the moon gave off as it shone through the window. As he padded his way through the house he noticed that there was a light on upstairs. He frowned. He thought for sure Bobby was already asleep, and had been that way for a while.</p>
<p>He walked toward the stairs. He stopped at the foot of the stairs when he heard Bobby’s voice speaking softly to someone. He strained to try and make out what he was saying, but couldn’t pick out any specific words. He briefly contemplated moving further up the stairs, to see if he could hear anything. But decided not to risk it. It wasn’t worth it. He moved away from the stairs and continued his way down the hall toward his original destination. He would talk to Bobby about it in the morning.</p>

<p>Sam stirred from the couch. He didn’t remember falling asleep and he was sure he was going to pay for it later. He always felt worse when he got some sleep. He groaned, and tried to roll over the best he could, but his frame was much too large for the couch, so it wasn’t easy for him to maneuver.</p>
<p>“You know you don’t have to sleep on the couch, Sam,” he heard Bobby say from behind him.</p>
<p>He sat up, rubbing his hand down his face. “I know,” he replied. “But I just can’t go up to our room. It just…it would be really empty.”</p>
<p>Bobby sighed, sitting himself down in an armchair. “I know. I know this is hard. I miss him like hell, I can’t imagine how you’re feeling. Did you get any sleep last night?”</p>
<p>Sam shrugged. “I think I got an hour or so.”</p>
<p>Bobby nodded. “Listen, you know I love having you around, and you are welcome to stay as long as you want.”</p>
<p>“But…” Sam started.</p>
<p>“Last night I got a phone call. It was from an organization back east called MACUSA. They’re, well-<em>shit</em>. I really don’t know how to explain any of this to you.”</p>
<p>Sam sat up straighter on the couch. It was the first time he felt interested in anything in weeks. “Try.”</p>
<p>Bobby sighed, “MACUSA stands for the Magical Congress of the United States of America.”</p>
<p>“Magical Congress?” Sam asked.</p>
<p>“Sam, I need you to listen to me carefully. I need you to set aside everything you know, and keep an open mind.”</p>
<p>Sam took a deep breath, but still nodded.</p>
<p>“I know that you’re familiar with one type of magic, with one type of witch. The kind that comes with demonic ties. But there is other magic out there. Magic that is not tied to selling your soul to a demon. Magic that has been around basically since the beginning of time. This magic it’s, uh, it’s genetic.”</p>
<p>Sam leaned forward in his seat. “Genetic witches? I’ve never heard of anything like that. There’s nothing like that in Dad’s journal.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I hadn’t either until shortly before you came here. I got a phone call from MACUSA asking if I would be able to help them with a problem. I was skeptical until one of their law enforcement officers showed up here and demonstrated their magic, and it’s nothing like anything I have ever seen before. They have to channel their magic through wands in order to effectively use their magic.”</p>
<p>Sam scoffed and shook his head, his hair moving around his face. “Wands? Do you know how ridiculous this sounds?”</p>
<p>Bobby chuckled. “I know, Sam. I know. I could hardly believe it myself. But then she came here and she showed me what she could do. And it was pretty impressive.”</p>
<p>“How come we’ve never heard of these people before?”</p>
<p>“Something about a statute of secrecy. They’re not allowed to reveal themselves to non-magical people.”</p>
<p>Sam cocked his head. “If they’re not allowed to reveal themselves to non-magical people, how come they called you?”</p>
<p>Bobby sighed. “Our reputations proceed ourselves. MACUSA has been aware of us for a while. They have been following hunters and what they do, just in case they catch wind of a witch or wizard and mistake them for a demon made witch and try to kill them. So naturally, they’ve been keeping an eye on you and Dean. Well, they need our help. Something has come up that they need the assistance of a hunter with.”</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>“I’m not sure. When they called and visited before, I told them that I couldn’t help. That you and Dean were busy trying to keep him from…well you know. And with the destruction of the Roadhouse last year, there really isn’t a centralized location for hunters right now. Well, word has gotten back to them about Dean, and they called again last night, begging for our help. I told them that I would talk to you.”</p>
<p>Sam sighed, leaning back into the couch. Non-demon made witches? A secret magical world? And they needed his help? Could he help them? Could he hunt without Dean? That was the real question, wasn’t it? Could he do it without his brother?</p>
<p>“I don’t know, Bobby. What exactly do they need us to do? What could they possibly need our help with?”</p>
<p>Bobby shrugged again. “I don’t know, exactly. They said they would be sending a representative later today to talk to us. This representative is who will be working closely with us as we do whatever it is they need help with. They were being very secretive, and they kept shouting in my ear. I don’t know if they know how phones work.”</p>
<p>Sam shook his head. “What do you think, Bobby?”</p>
<p>“I think that you need something to live for again,” he said bluntly. “You’ve been on my couch for a few weeks now, and you’re not shaving. You’re not sleeping, and I don’t even know if you’re eating. You can’t go on like this. You need something to help you remember who you are.”</p>
<p>“But I don’t know if I can do this alone. Without Dean.”</p>
<p>“You’re not going to be doing this alone. I’m here. And you’ll have this magical guy working with you for a bit. I know he won’t be Dean, but at least you won’t be out on the road alone.”</p>
<p>“How do you know it’s a guy?”</p>
<p>“Because I don’t think they would send a woman out on the road alone with you with your and your brother’s “love ‘em and leave ‘em” reputations across the country.”</p>
<p>Sam laughed. “They really know all of that about us?”</p>
<p>“I’m guessing they do. They knew quite a bit.”</p>
<p>“Do you have any books or anything around here that we can read to familiarize ourselves with these genetic witches?”</p>
<p>Bobby shrugged. “I honestly don’t know. But you’re free to look.”</p>
<p>“Thanks, Bobby,” Sam said, rising from his spot on the couch. As he moved to the library, Bobby couldn’t help but smile. It wasn’t much, but he was starting to see some of the old Sam starting to poke through. Just a bit.</p>
<p align="center">SUPERPOTTER</p>
<p>Sam closed his eyes, running his hands down his face. He had spent the last two hours scouring books, and he hadn’t found one thing about genetic witches. Their statute of secrecy must be really fucking good. Not one word in any book about them. If Bobby hadn’t said he had met one and seen what they could do in person, he would think they were just a legend. A story. Like an actual legend and story, not a legend and story that they usually encountered. He didn’t like the idea of this wizard coming here and catching him unprepared.</p>
<p>He stood from the couch and went back to the bookshelves, trying to see if he could find anything, anything at all, about these people. He looked over at Bobby’s computer. Maybe he could find something on the Internet? Then he shook his head. If he couldn’t find anything in books, he probably wouldn’t be finding anything online. They seemed to keep any references to themselves out of sight. He wondered if they had a spell or something to help them with that. Then he started wondering if he’d ever met one without knowing it. It was possible. If they really blended in as well as they seemed to, he very well could have made friends with one and not known it. Could any of his fellow hunters be one?</p>
<p>He shook his head, banishing those thoughts. He would have known if a fellow hunter was a witch or wizard, they would have done something he couldn’t explain. He was about to move back to the couch and lay on it until further notice, he was exhausted, when there was a knock on the door. He frowned and looked around. Bobby had run into town to pick up a few things so they would have food for when their visitor arrived. When they called, MACUSA didn’t say when their representative would be here, but Bobby was pretty sure they would be here by dinner time.</p>
<p>Sam moved to the door, and opened it. He took a step back in surprise. Standing in front of him was a woman, who looked to be about the same age as him. She stood about a foot shorter than him, and her dark hair was pulled back in a severe bun. Her tailored black pantsuit clung to her curves, but the jacket flowed outward in a way that he had never seen a suit jacket do before. It was almost like she was wearing a robe…</p>
<p>“Hello? Can I help you?” Sam asked, suspiciously.</p>
<p>“Ah, yes, are you Bobby Singer?” she asked, her posh British accent taking him by surprise.</p>
<p>“Um, no, he’s actually out right now. Can I help you?”</p>
<p>She smiled widely. “Oh, you must be Sam Winchester, then. I had heard to expect you here as well.” She extended her hand then. “I’m Hermione Granger, I’m pretty sure MACUSA told you to expect me.”</p>
<p>Sam took her offered hand, and shook it. This was who MACUSA sent to work with him? She was definitely not what he was expecting. And not just because she was a woman. She was so petite. So proper. Unlike any hunters he had ever encountered. And he was expected to work with her? On what? Paperwork? He didn’t know what she was going to be selling, but he decided in that moment, he would not be buying.</p>
