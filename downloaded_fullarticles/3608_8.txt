    <p>Year 1:<br/>
Remus and Sirius are devastated that their best friends are gone, but they’re fiercely protective of the baby. They bring him to their small flat that they own and sleep with one eye open as he stirs in his crib on side of their bed. Neither one of them is willing to let him be in another room for the tense fear of what could happen. The first time Remus is set to change into a werewolf he fidgets all week whenever Harry grabs at him. Sirius gets Molly and Arthur to take him for the night while Remus changes and Sirius watches him. It’s also the first time they’ve had to deal with it without James and in the morning, they sit together completely exhausted from the struggle. They cry in each other’s arms before steeling themselves and go pick up Harry. When Christmas comes, Sirius picks out a jumper with a reindeer on it and nearly cries as he sees Harry’s delight at the animal form his father once took. Remus keeps trying to feed him chocolate and Sirius swats it away because he insists it’s bad for him.</p><p>Year 2:<br/>
On Harry’s second birthday, the entire Order packs into Sirius and Remus’s tiny flat to wish the child a happy birthday. He’s given gifts of quidditch memorabilia from his parents’ favorite teams and everyone brings all the photos they can find of James and Lily. Remus puts them all together into a photo album for when Harry is older and bakes a delicate chocolate cake with Sirius’s help. Sirius gets Harry his first leather jacket and Remus rolls his eyes as Sirius insists they get photos of their matching jackets while on his motorcycle. Harry gets into all sorts of trouble as he walks around their flat now and it exasperates Remus to no end. One night Harry gets a hold of Sirius’s wand and it begins a chase through the house while Remus struggles to get it back. Sirius laughs his ass off and finally becomes a help by changing into his animagus form, distracting Harry. Harry takes delight in watching the scruffy black dog bark with laughter and wag his tail. He falls asleep clinging to Padfoot that night.</p><p>Year 3:<br/>
Sirius and Remus finally move into a house, their uneasiness at leaving Harry in his own room settled as Voldemort has been inactive for long enough. They paint the walls in the colors of James’s favorite quidditch team and hang banners. Sirius makes a mess during this and Harry squeals with delight as he watches Sirius flick paint and speckle Remus’s face. Christmas that year involves a giant tree in their living room where Harry hangs sloppy ornaments he made with Remus on the lower branches. Sirius insists they hang a photo of James and Lily towards the top, misty-eyed as he does so. Harry helps Sirius pick out a present for Remus, a jumper with little black terriers all over it that he insists look like a mini Uncle Sirius much to the confusion of the people around them. On Christmas Eve they all sit in their pajamas and drink hot chocolate in front of a roaring fire until Harry falls asleep on Remus’s arm.</p><p>Year 4:<br/>
Sirius becomes an Auror that year, restless from staying at home with Harry while Remus conducted business for Dumbledore involving werewolf studies. Lyall Lupin watched Harry most often during the day, spending time with the boy he considered like a grandson. He often entertained him with stories of his guardians and his parents during their youth. He commented to Remus one day that they shared the same sweet tooth and Sirius exclaimed “I told you so!” for the rest of the evening. When Lyall commented months later that Harry could give both James and Sirius a run for their money in mischief, even at such a young age, Remus was smug for days.</p><p>Years 5-10:<br/>
Harry attended muggle school and slowly began to learn about magic from Sirius and Remus. Sirius always tried to get Harry to become interested in helping him work on his motorcycle but he only held mild interest in it. He often preferred to listen to Remus talk about magical creatures (especially werewolves like Remus) and defense spells. Occasionally, they would catch him looking at the photo album Remus made him all those years ago with pictures of his parents and the Order. At every holiday, the Order members would fight over who got to host the three that year and tell Harry all about the stories of James and the trouble he got into or how clever Lily was.</p><p>Year 11:</p><p>Sirius promised he wouldn’t cry the day they got Harry’s letter to Hogwarts, but he did. He did again when they picked out his wand and owl, when they sent him off on the Hogwarts Express. Remus held his tears back while Harry waved to them from the platform, the spitting image of James but with Lily’s keen eyes. He bit back a sob when he remembered the first person he met on that very train was Lily Evans, the girl that would become his best friend long before the Marauders. They both hugged each other in glee when Harry sent a letter home revealing he was placed in Gryffindor, just like his parents. Sirius smirked when Harry went on about how he found a Gryffindor sweater in his trunk that Remus had packed for him. He knew that very sweater once belonged to James because they had left it hanging in their closet, something Sirius had found mixed in his belongings at their flat the night after he cried over losing his best friend. It was fitting his son would wear it the day he made the quidditch team and again under his robes when he won his first match. Sirius and Remus had gotten special permission from Dumbledore to watch and nobody cheered louder for him that day than they did.</p>
