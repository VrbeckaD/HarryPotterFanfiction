    <p>It was a nice quiet evening at the Lupin home, well it was more like a cabin in the woods, but it was a nice cabin. Living in this cabin was a werewolf and his family, no pack but the werewolf hates it when anyone calls it that. Still, it’s nice to have a ‘pack’ again. The werewolf’s name is Remus John Lupin. He happily lives with his wife, son, and his best friend. Remus was outside watching his son ride on the back of his best friend Sirius Black. You see Sirius can turn into a dog. “Faster Snuffles, faster,” Teddy his six-year-old son cheered and laughed. Remus laughed with him as he walked onto the back porch.</p><p>“Having fun Ted?” Remus said as Teddy his six-year-old son got off the black dog who turned back into Sirius.  </p><p>“Yes, thank you, cousin Sirius,” Sirius smiled at the boy whose hair turned into his father’s brown sandy color.  Remus smiled and sat down on the porch.  Teddy ran up to his father and jumped on his lap. Sirius laughed and walked onto the porch.</p><p>“When will mum come home dad?” Teddy asked as he changed his hair to a bright turquoise color. Teddy like his mother can change his appearance. Remus smiled at how fast he is learning with his abilities. Remus opened his mouth to answer but then everything went dark as he held his son close.</p><p>              Sometime in the past, there were two brothers. Only they were not as close as Sirius and Remus who were not brothers. The brother's names were Theseus and Newton Scamander. They were totally different people, but they had one thing in common, they were both wizards. Theseus Scamander was walking down the road in the busy streets of London when he heard a cry, it was a cry of a child. The war hero turned around to see the child in question. He stood out from any other child he has ever seen. For starters, the boy had bright turquoise hair. He could not see his eyes for his head was in his hands. His clothes showed that the boy was, or seem wealthy but poor at the same time. Curious Theseus walked over to the bench where the boy was crying.  “Hello,” Theseus said quietly but he could not change the demanding tone in his voice. The boy who looked to Theseus about six years old did not say anything as he was to busy crying to notice the war hero. “Hello,” he tried again. However this time the boy looked up from his hands to look at Theseus.</p><p>“Hello,” he sniffed and wiped the tears from his blue amber eyes.</p><p>“What's your name?” Again, he could not change the demanding tone. The boy looked down at his hands before he said:</p><p>“Edward but dad and mum call me Teddy,” the boy-Teddy replied as he wiped the tears again from his eyes. Theseus smiled.</p><p>“Can I sit down?” Teddy nodded and looked around.</p><p>“Who are you?” Teddy asked. He realized that he was supposed to talk to people that he does not know but he can find his father so what choice does he have. Theseus looked at the boy.</p><p><em>He’s scared of me. Well, he does not know me.</em> Theseus thought before he looked at the boy once more. “I’m Theseus. Why are you sad?” he asked a little less demanding now. Teddy thought and then sighed.</p><p>“I can't find my dad. We-we were on my back porch and then I ended up,” the boy pointed a few inches from the bench that the two were sitting on. “My daddy was holding on to me, I was on his lap. how does this happen?” the boy cried. Theseus could see something in the boy's eyes. It looked like a wolf inside.</p><p>“Don’t worry. We will find your father. What does he look like?” Theseus asked after he shook the thought that the boy is a werewolf.  The boy cleared his throat, but instead of telling him Teddy changed his appearance to look like his father. Theseus looked at him shocked but then he nodded.</p><p>“Ok, come on. Let's go find him then,” Teddy nodded as he got off the bench and fallowed Theseus to go looking for his father.</p><p>Remus woke with a start as he looked around. “Where am I?” he asked out loud as he looked up to the now night sky. The moon was not full, not yet, not for a few more days. Remus sighed and sat up. “Ted, Teddy? Where are you Teddy?” he called when he did not see his shy kind son next to him. Remus sighed and got to his feet. “Where am I?” he asked again but in a low whisper. “Where’s Sirius?” he asked as he walked down the road. Using his werewolf hearing he listened for Teddy, but he did not hear the little voice of his beloved son.  Remus did not know how long he was walking. He did, however, got tired fast. The full moon was a few days away and Remus was starting to get a headache. “The wolf what’s to come out and play,” he said quietly as he looked around the dark street. He got so lost in thought that he did not see the tall man run into him.</p><p>“So, sorry,” the man said quietly not meeting the werewolf’s eyes. Remus smiled at him and sighed.</p><p>“Sir,” the man with brown hair looked at Remus.</p><p>“Um, yes,” the man said still not meeting his eyes.</p><p>“First can I ask you your name? then can you help me, I’m looking for my son?” The man looked at him for a moment then he sighed.</p><p>“Newt Scamander and you are?” Remus laughed as he stepped back.</p><p>“That’s not possible, it's just not. How can you be Newt Scamander? Author of my favorite book when I was a first year?” Remus laughed again as he rocked on the balls of his feet. However, this made his werewolf headache hurt more. Remus stopped laughing and let out a heavy but weak sigh. “Sorry. Remus Lupin. You don’t have to help me find my son if you don’t want to,” Remus said before he started to walk away from Newt.</p><p>“Um, wait, I can help you, but, but I might need some help from someone that I don’t really get along with. I’m not sure if he will help though. I don’t think that he cares for me,” Newt said sadly. Remus sighed and nodded.</p><p>“I think he might,” ‘<em>When he hears that there is a six-year-old running around in one of the most dangerous times in our history.’ </em> He added in his mind.</p><p>“Well, let's go see then and i'm sure he will help you,”</p><p>              Theseus took Teddy to the ministry to get some help on finding Teddy’s father. Theseus cleared his throat as he walked up to the desk.  “Hello sir,” the lady at the desk said as he looked up from her papers. </p><p>“Hello. I need to ask a favor,” Theseus replied as he and Teddy walked around the desk so he can show her the boy. “This boy can't seem to find his father. He’s magic so, we don’t need to worry,” Theseus added looking at Teddy.</p><p>“What's the boy’s name?” the lady asked. Theseus sighed and said:</p><p>“Edward but he says that his mum and dad call him Teddy. He did not say his last name though,” Teddy looked at the lady who went through the papers on her desk and hums.</p><p>“What's your last name then. Edward?” teddy thought for a moment and said:</p><p>“Lupin. Edward “Teddy” Remus Lupin,” Teddy answered as his eyes changed back to his father’s blue amber color.</p><p>“Is that your father's name, Remus?” Teddy nodded as tears formed in his eyes again.</p><p>“I, I want my daddy. I want Sirius,” Teddy cried as he fell to the floor. Theseus did not know what to do with the crying boy.  So he just stood there.</p><p>              Newt and Remus walked to the ministry in silence. Well, silence for Newt anyway. For Remus listened to everything with his werewolf hearing. He was listening for Teddy but he did not hear anything. Remus sighed as he pulled out a flask from his pocket. Newt watched him as he drank from it. “You’re a drinker?” Newt asked the werewolf. Remus looked at him with a raised eyebrow.</p><p>“What? No this is my medicine. I um, have a condition,” Remus said without saying anything else. Newt nodded as he looked down at his case lost in thought.  </p><p>“I did not, um ask what your son’s name is yet?”  Remus hums and said:</p><p>“Teddy. He’s six,” Remus looked around him and then realized that: “I’m in a different time aren't I?” he said out loud looking at Newt who did not meet his eyes again hummed.</p><p>“Yes. it’s 1927. What year did you come from?” Newt asked as they got closer to the ministry.  Remus did not say anything as they both walked.</p><p>“I’m a werewolf,” Remus said quietly with a low sigh from the back of his throat. Newt stopped in his tracks and looked at Remus.</p><p>“What? you’re a,” Remus nodded.</p><p>“I needed to tell you,” Remus paused and pointed at the moon. Newt looked up at where Remus was pointing.</p><p>“Right, and your um, son when we find him,”</p><p>“I need you to look after him. If we do not make it back to my, our time,” Remus said as they approached the ministry. “You won't tell anyone that will you?” Remus added looking down to the pavement. Newt nodded before he sighed.</p><p>“Sir, I hear a voice in my head that’s not mine. I don’t think I will tell anyone that. So I guess I won't tell anyone that you are a werewolf. Which is not really your fault,” Remus looked at him but did not say anything as he heard the cries of his son.</p><p>“Teddy,” the werewolf said as he ran into the ministry.</p><p>              Theseus was on his feet now trying to calm the boy who won't seem to stop crying.  At this point, an old but young looking man ran in. Theseus saw that the man had sandy blonde hair that looked like Teddy’s. however, his hair was graying a little, weirdly the man did not look that old. On his face had thin visible scars. It looked like he was attacked by something at a young age. He looked tired and sad for some reason. The boy, however, stopped crying and looked up to the man. “Daddy,” he cried and wrapped his arms around the man whom Theseus realized was Edward’s father.</p><p>“Shh, Cub. It’s ok. I’m right here, I’m right here,” the man was crying also.  “Thank you for looking after him,” he said after he calmed down and cleared his throat which was now dry. “Remus John Lupin and you are?” he asked. Theseus nodded and looked to the door to see his little brother Newton walk through the door.</p><p>“Hello, brother,” he said as he stood up folding his arms. Newt gave him a weak smile and looked down to the ground again. “I’m Theseus by the way. Theseus Scamander,” Remus who was still holding his son stood back like he did when he met Newt.</p><p>“Oh, bloody hell. I did not know that you had a brother,” the werewolf said as he covered his son’s ears. Theseus laughed a little as he looked at the family.</p><p>“Do you want to go get something to eat? Are you free brother?” Theseus asked looking at Newt who now was more into the ministry now. Newt’s eyebrows shot up</p><p>“Since when do you want to do something with me brother?” Newt said as he looked in the direction of Remus and his son. Theseus scoffed and rolled his eyes.</p><p>“I care about you brother we have been over this. It would be nice to take this loving father and his son out for something because no offense but it looks like he does not have money,” Remus raised his scarred eyebrow and chuckled.</p><p>“None taken,” Remus laughed a little as his werewolf headache started again.  Newt sighed and nodded.</p><p>“Your right. Sorry, Thee,” Theseus smiled.</p><p>“Right let's go then,” Theseus said as he clapped his hands together as the four of them left the ministry.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>
