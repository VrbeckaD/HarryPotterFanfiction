    <p>Her fingers trailed over the spines of the books. Bumping from one to the next. She wasn’t even looking at them or noticing the titles, just lost in thought. Then, a slight buzz of magic, like an electric shock after crossing a carpet, made her pause. She tipped the book off the shelf to take a closer look</p><p>The Time Turner</p><p>The title looped across the cover in a gold font that moved and shimmered slightly. Curious she opened to a random page and read</p><p>
  <br/>
  <em> “His gray eyes drilled into hers and her breath caught. He leaned in closer, his lips hovering just above hers, and whispered hoarsely ‘May I kiss you?”</em>
</p><p><br/> She snapped the book shut, glancing around guiltily. She knew she was blushing, but she also knew it wasn’t out of embarrassment. Peeking at another section it dropped her in the middle of a mystery of some sort.</p><p>
  <em>“We’re Aurors and we’re partners. We are going to have to make this work. Her honey brown eyes nearly sparked with anger. He grabbed her wrist as she turned away and drew her closer.”</em>
</p><p><br/> Lingering just a moment longer on the page she impulsively dropped the book into her basket and went up to the register. The clerk smiled kindly at her “Find everything you need Ms. Granger?” She nodded and tried to smile blandly as he rang up her purchases. His eyes never flickered or gave any indication he noticed the book and she gratefully dropped it into her beaded bag.</p><p><br/>***</p><p><br/> Bedtime had been a nightmare. Cassiopeia wouldn’t sleep without being held and Scorpius whined incessantly that it wasn’t fair, the he wanted his turn with her. She stayed in Cassie’s room until the whines had turned into soft snores, feeling guilty the whole time that she was avoiding her son. She slipped into the hallway just as Draco was leaving Scorpious’ room. Brown eyes met gray and he smiled tiredly at her. “I’m headed to bed.” His voice was almost gravely with exhaustion and he kissed her softly on the cheek “Come up soon?” Hermione nodded and bit her cheek to hold back her response. They’d barely had a chance to talk tonight, she wished he would come downstairs just for a little while.</p><p>She wasn’t tired and as she sank into the couch the pile of books on the arm spilled into her lap “The Time Turner” ending up on top. She picked it up and curled her legs under her as she began to read.</p><p><br/> Her eyes felt gritty as she came to the end of the story. She blinked and rubbed them, catching sight of the clock. 11:30! She gasped. Tucking the book onto the shelf she made her ways upstairs. Tomorrow was going to hurt.</p><p>***<br/><br/> Hermione clutched her coffee cup and pinched the bridge of her nose. Scorp was reciting facts off his chocolate frog cards and Cassie was singing loudly and banging her spoon in time. Draco wrapped his arms around her and pressed a kiss to her cheek “It’s going to be a late one” he said apologetically “Sure wish I was on vacation like you.”<br/> Her face fell, sure, vacation. A chance to be at home…all day…every day….just her and the kids. She thought briefly about her classroom and quiet office. Guilt flooded her, she was so lucky to be able to do this, that they could do this. She loved her kids, but also…. With a sigh she slid “The Time Turner” closer and flipped it open. Nodding and ‘Mhming” at intervals to Scorp and Cassie as she read.</p><p>***</p><p><br/> Was it Friday yet? Cassie flailed at the base of the stairs and Hermione sat a few steps up. Bits of baby magic crackled and sparked. She flicked her wand every now and then putting out the flares. Draco opened the door and took in the scene. He smirked and waggled his eyebrows at her. Looking down she realized her skirt was hiked up and one of her shirt straps had fallen down. She rolled her eyes and tugged her clothes into place. She knew it was supposed to be a compliment but HONESTLY the last thing she felt right now was sexy or alluring.</p><p>***</p><p><br/> Ginny took a sip of tea and gazed at Hermione. The kids had vanished upstairs with a giggle, leaving the two of them alone. “So, how are you?” Hermione fidgeted under her friends’ steady gaze.</p><p><br/> “Honestly?” she sighed “I’m fucking miserable.” Ginny didn’t answer, just quirked an eyebrow and waited. “I mean” Hermione continued “it’s not like anything in particular is bad. I’m just, tired. I’m home for the summer, which should be great but its exhausting and Draco just works so much and he’s stressed. We barely see each other. I don’t want to complain about him or anything, he’s wonderful and he loves me so much and is so good with the kids. I shouldn’t complain, forget I said any thing.”</p><p>“It’s your life too” Ginny said, squeezing her hand. Just then a crash and a cry of “Moooooooom!” from upstairs sent them running.</p>
