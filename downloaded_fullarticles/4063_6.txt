    <p>Two weeks after they graduate from Hogwarts, Annie receives a letter.</p>
<p>They’re at Armin’s grandfather’s house. It’s a warm afternoon and Iago, the Leonhardt family owl, is perched on the backrest of one of the dining room chairs. He hoots impatiently at Annie, and Annie scowls and glares back as Armin squints at her father’s untidy scrawl.</p>
<p>“This is honestly not the worst thing ever,” he says at last, folding up the parchment and setting it on the table.</p>
<p>Annie scowls again. “Yes, it is.”</p>
<p>“No,” chuckles Armin, “it’s not. Honestly, a ball sounds like it might be fun.”</p>
<p>A <em>ball. </em>Annie snorts mirthlessly into one of Reg’s floral tea cups and Iago hoots at her again like he wants her to write a damn reply already. “It’s not just a ball and you know it. It’s a <em>debut.</em> <em>My </em>debut.”</p>
<p>“Well,” says Armin. He crumbles a bit off the edge of his biscuit and offers it to Iago, who flutters eagerly off the backrest and onto his shoulder. “It’s a little outdated, sure. But it’s really, <em>really</em> not the worst thing ever. All things considered, this is pretty good for your dad.”</p>
<p>Annie snorts again. “I’m not dressing up for a bunch of stuffy fuckwits.”</p>
<p>“You can’t call them that.”</p>
<p>“I can call them what I want,” says Annie pointedly. “And they <em>are</em>. I mean. Armin. Think about this. Really think about this. You know what this is, don’t you? It’s a <em>debutante ball</em>. My father is literally having a party so he can <em>‘present me to wizarding society’, </em>which, you know, is defined here as ‘upper class pure blood families’, so those fuckwits can gawk at me and introduce me to their fuckwit sons. He’s one step off trying to marry me off. How do you not have a problem with this?”</p>
<p>Armin laughs. “He’s <em>not </em>marrying you off though. Read his letter again. <em>He </em>suggested you bring <em>me. </em>Me! A muggle born kid he probably hated on principle for years. Honestly, Ann, he’s been really good about holding up his end of the deal – all <em>you</em> have to do to hold up yours is go to this ball and attend a couple of meetings with the Hogwarts governors. It’s <em>really </em>not the worst thing ever.”</p>
<p>“It’s still outdated,” sputters Annie, “and <em>sexist</em>, and – and – <em>classist, </em>I mean – ”</p>
<p>“Annie – Ann, come on, look.” Armin offers Iago a little more biscuit and brushes the crumbs off his hands. "You hold a fair bit of power here, okay? Wasn't part of the reason you agreed to be the Leonhardt Heiress to help all those pure blood families – quote – 'get their heads out of their asses'?"</p>
<p>Annie makes a face at him. "Well - yeah, but -"</p>
<p>"So why not use some of that power now?" asks Armin. "Your dad wants you to go to this ball because of a silly tradition, right, but ultimately, it's still <em>your </em>ball. Invite Eren and Mikasa, maybe even Professor Ackerman and Madame Ral – you know, people you can actually hold a conversation with. Asking to have, what, five extra people there isn't unreasonable, but refusing <em>is</em> - and if your dad <em>does </em>refuse, <em>then</em> you can straight up say you're not going on the basis that <em>he's</em> the one being unreasonable. Play the game. Force a compromise. It’s the first step towards more change."</p>
<p>Annie narrows her eyes at him. She squints at the seal on the letter, and then at Iago (who hoots and nips at Armin's hair), and then at Armin again. “Well, I mean, that’s easy to <em>say</em>,” she grumbles, “but I’m still essentially being forced to dress up in stupid fucking dress robes for a bunch of stuffy fuckwits.”</p>
<p>“<em>Annie</em>.” Armin laughs. Annie can’t help but smile to herself at the sound. “Surely you get to at least pick out ones you like.”</p>
<p>“Nope.” Annie huffs and tosses a biscuit at Iago. “Those are traditional too. I’m supposed to wear my mum’s. I expect my dad to start calling about trying them on any day now.”</p>
<p>“Well,” says Armin thoughtfully. “You’re breaking a bunch of traditions already. Why not one more?”</p>
<p>“Pardon me.”</p>
<p>Armin scratches Iago’s feathers and grins. “Go dress shopping. Actual dress shopping, I mean – find something you like instead of getting fitted for traditional dress robes. Again, it’s <em>your </em>ball, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“Don’t you think setting all of these conditions is a bit much?”</p>
<p>Perhaps Annie just hadn’t noticed it before, but there’s a spark of mischief in Armin’s eyes. She honestly thinks he’s enjoying this – or, at least the idea of this – far more than he’s letting on. “Nothing’s ‘too much’ if you know how to ask for it,” he says. “Like I said, you just have to play the game.”</p>
<p>There’s a pause. Iago flutters off of Armin’s shoulder and starts pecking biscuit crumbs off the plate. Annie shoos him away with a frown.</p>
<p>“I didn’t realize you had a manipulative streak,” she says at last.</p>
<p>He winks. “I’ve always had one, Ann. Don’t tell anyone though – I’d hate to ruin my reputation.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>"You want to do <em>what</em>?"</p>
<p>Mr. Leonhardt's head frowns at her from the hearth. The Arlert fireplace has been part of the Floo Network for about a year now. In what Annie likes to think was a stroke of ‘skilled diplomacy’, she had convinced her father that it would make communication easier during her stays with the Arlerts. In reality, she'd done it to make things easier for Armin and his grandfather once she and Armin had a place to themselves closer to London.</p>
<p>She shrugs and crosses her legs on the hearthrug. "I want to set some conditions,” she says, trying to sound like she hadn't spent ten minutes memorising this whole spiel. “If you and the other families <em>insist</em> that I have a deb ball,” (she wrinkles her nose at the words ‘deb ball’), “then I think it’s perfectly reasonable for me to find a way to enjoy it.”</p>
<p>“What <em>conditions </em>would those be?”</p>
<p>Annie clears her throat. “I want to invite the Jaegers and the Ackermans.”</p>
<p>Mr. Leonhardt's head bobs disapprovingly in the flames. "We've already extended the invitation to Armin - him being there alone is going to turn heads. Isn't that enough?"</p>
<p>"Five extra people won't hurt, <em>Dad."</em> She pauses for a moment to study the way the word breaks down his resolve. It’s a cheap trick. Part of her feels kind of guilty for playing on his emotions like this, but she reminds herself that the entire concept of a deb ball is horribly sexist and outdated, and she presses on. "Surely, we can compromise on this.”</p>
<p>Mr. Leonhardt lets out a long, exaggerated sigh, but, at last, he shakes his head. "Fine. When will you be home next? We'll need to schedule fitting for your mother’s old dress robes."</p>
<p>"Ah - actually -"Annie coughs mildly. “That’s the other condition. I want to pick a dress.”</p>
<p>There’s a pause. Mr. Leonhardt’s head tilts to the side, confused. “Dress robes, you mean.”</p>
<p>“No,” says Annie. “A dress. Something nice, simple, and more importantly, something a bit more <em>me</em> – no offense to mum, but her old dress robes are a bit – ” Annie purses her lips. “Frilly.”</p>
<p>Mr. Leonhardt scowls. “Your mother’s dress robes are <em>traditional</em>, Annie, she wore those at her own ball, and her mother wore them before her.”</p>
<p>“Exactly,” says Annie resolutely. “They’re as outdated as this deb ball idea. I don’t want to wear them.”</p>
<p>“<em>Annie.</em>” It comes out as a growl, but Reg’s footsteps sound through the living room and Mr. Leonhardt coughs and takes a breath. “<em>Annie</em>,” he tries again, eyeing Reg carefully over her shoulder. “What, exactly, are you trying to achieve here? One would think you’re trying to – ” He coughs. “Trying to turn this into something like a <em>muggle </em>ball.”</p>
<p>Annie raises an eyebrow at him. “Is there something wrong with that?”</p>
<p>Mr. Leonhardt huffs. “I suppose not,” he grumbles. He’s still watching Reg. “But – the other families – ”</p>
<p>At that, Annie takes her own turn to scowl. "It's my ball, isn't it?" she snaps. "Honestly, the whole concept is <em>archaic</em>, but if you <em>insist</em> that it's <em>tradition</em>, then you'll have to excuse me for wanting to at least make it bearable. Can we compromise on this or not?"</p>
<p>Mr. Leonhardt pauses. Annie can practically feel the way he studies her face, and, at last, he sighs. "All right," he says. "Is there anyone else you'd like to invite?"</p>
<p>Annie shrugs and stares at a spot in the grate. "I suppose it's a little too hopeful to expect the other families to be polite to Reg if he's invited?"</p>
<p>"A little, yes."</p>
<p>"Then that's it," says Annie finally. "I'll go to the thing and I'll play nice and all the other stuff as long as Armin, the Jaegers, and the Ackermans can come, and as long as I can find a dress that I actually like."</p>
<p>Mr. Leonhardt's lips twitch upward a little - Annie thinks he looks both very relieved, and very pleased that this has finally been settled - and his head bobs up in down in an awkward kind of nod. "All right, then. Come visit soon, won't you?"</p>
<p>Annie chuckles. "Sure thing, Dad," she says - and she means it this time.</p>
