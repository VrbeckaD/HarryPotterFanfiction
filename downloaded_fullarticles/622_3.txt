He wasn’t supposed to be there.</p><p>He wasn’t supposed to be one of them.</p><p>Not yet.</p><p>His father had promised him that back in Draco’s fourth year.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Back when he’d had felt the power of the Dark Mark return upon his skin. When the shallow grey had turned to inky black.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He’d promised his son that the Dark Lord took only those who were of age into his service. That because of the ministry’s enforced underage trace, he, Draco, would be safe.</p><p>Safe at least, until the Dark Lord returned to power and took control of the ministry, that was.</p><p>Draco had found it odd, his father using the word safe instead of honoured. Odder still the relief Draco had felt hearing of the delay in his call to service.</p><p>If he had possessed any ounce of bravery, he’d have at least allowed himself the privilege of honesty within his own mind. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Draco was bloody terrified.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Three times now, Harry Potter had defeated the Dark Lord.</p><p>Three times he’d either vanquished, humiliated, or caused disruption to the Dark Lord’s plans. If Draco was to believe the rumour mill that flew through Hogwarts like a broom on fire, however; it wasn’t just three.<br/>
Harry Potter had been a thorn in the Dark Lord’s side at least once, if not twice more.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His father had said little after Draco’s second year, though he knew his father had had his hand in the events that had occurred.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He knew solely because it had lost him Dobby.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The thought of his Father having aided whatever had been petrifying students hadn’t troubled him for long, as his focus had been on ways to get Potter back for freeing his favourite house-elf. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Bloody saint Potter.</p><p>No, he hadn’t given his father’s behaviour after leaving the headmaster’s office until he’d returned home for the summer break.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Until he’d noticed his mother wearing longer sleeves than usual that summer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Noticed the slight tremor as she served tea and passed the jam.</p><p>Some things even magic couldn’t heal.</p><p>Draco had learnt that at the early age of eight, on his way back from pilfering a biscuit from the kitchens. He’d heard a noise, like a whimper of a crup, and his curious nature had drawn him to the slight crack between the door and frame of his father’s study.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As his eyes had adjusted to the flickering golden blanket of light from the fire from the hearth, he’d stifled a gasp.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Draco had had to look away.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He’d taken a deep breath and refocused upon the sight inside the room.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He’d needed to, for his brain to believe what his horrified eyes took in.</p><p>His mother, prone and limp upon the ground. The sounds coming from her had been… inhuman. They’d made Draco wish to rush inside and throw himself upon her. Shielding her from whatever was causing her harm. He’d instead found he couldn’t so much as move to blink, let alone get his feet to move.</p><p>His father had towered above her, wand drawn and cruelness etched upon his face. As his mouth had cast a curse, Draco’s mother had risen like a marionette with slightly tangled strings by a drunken handler.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Blood had run down her chin as she’d bitten her lip to—Draco had thought—keep herself from screaming.</p><p>Draco had slipped silently backward, not taking his eyes from the sliver of light and the sight of his parent’s tableau.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Just before he’d shifted toward the staircase, his mother had turned her head and his gaze had met hers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He’d sprinted like the hounds of Hades were on his heels up to his room when he’d seen his father turn round.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>His room was in the East wing, a fair dash from his father’s study, and it had winded Draco by the time he’d flung himself inside the comforts of his bedroom.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Pelting toward the bath, he’d promptly vomited up the biscuits.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It had taken him over an hour to calm his heaving stomach, to call for Dobby to come clean him up and to put him to bed.</p><p>That was the first time Draco’d seen an Unforgivable used.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>The first time he had an inkling that the Manor and the Malfoy name weren’t prizes his mother had won by marrying his father, but a prison.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>His father had surprised him the next day by taking him to purchase a new broom.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When asked, his father had proclaimed it a reward for his latest marks.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Marks, which according to Draco’s tutor, Professor Mileaubrand, showed that he carried on the pureblood respectability and brilliance expected.</p><p>Draco had preened under his father’s attention.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Draco rarely experienced Lucius’s full attention, not as he had that day. As they’d wandered throughout Diagon Alley and chatted about this and that, Draco had wondered about what he’d witnessed the night before.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></p><p>It had taken him years to realise that his father had known of his nocturnal visit and had reacted as he saw fit to ensure Draco didn’t become dis-enamoured with him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As Draco had looked at him adoringly, his father had subtly cast dispersions against his mother throughout their outing.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Your mother’s not meant for long social days, Draco.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“I can withstand the pressures that come with being a Malfoy, Draco, but alas your poor mother wasn’t raised in this esteem.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“We need to be gentle on her, Draco, give her her personal space and make no demands of her time.”</p><p>“Don’t hug her too hard, Draco, lest she fall into a faint.” <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>His father had woven these subtle barbs intended to separate son from mother as masterfully as a Ministry modiste wove a robe.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He’d then temper their sting by proclaiming his undying love for her, lest Draco became suspicious.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></p><p>His father’s apparent devotion had cast even more doubt upon Draco’s memory of the previous evening and upon returning home, he’d decided that he’d been mistaken. That he couldn’t possibly have seen what he’d thought he’d seen.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His father was too important a man, too proper a gentleman, to lay a hand upon or curse a woman.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Especially his wife.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Despite believing it all to be his imagination playing tricks on him, it had been the last time Draco had done any nocturnal wandering in his home.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At least until he’d left for Hogwarts and forgot.</p><p>He hadn’t forgotten now. Now, the past seemed to mock him. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His… father, whom he’d held in such esteem as a child and whom he’d wished to emulate politically and personally as he’d grown older, had betrayed him.</p><p>He’d lied. About everything.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>His father, who now rotted away in Azkaban like a common criminal.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Thanks again to bloody Potter.</p><p>And now Draco was paying the price of his own ignorance to his father’s manipulations and weakness.</p><p>“Does the pain ever go away?” His breath hitched as a sob pushed past his chapped and bloodied lips.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> He was asking about more than just the pain on his arm, the physical ache the least of his worries.<br/>
</span></p><p><span class="Apple-converted-space">He knew without words that his mother understood. </span>He felt her sigh as she cradled his head upon her lap.</p><p>“No, my darling. You just make room for it.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></p><p><span class="Apple-converted-space"><br/>
</span>Her soft hands, the hands Draco had always cursed for being weak, stroked his forehead with a strength he wished he possessed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Draco sobbed into his mothers lap, tears and snot running down his face unabashedly. For the first time that he could remember, Draco didn’t care about his appearance or if one thought he was a weakling, a coward.</p><p>He already knew he was.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>His mother, his darling, stoic, mother, whom he’d forsaken all these years as a flighty socialite without substance.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She was his rock.</p><p>“How… how did I get it so wrong?” His words pulled from his lips with the roughness of silk caught on a branch.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“How could I forget… not see…”</p><p>“My dragon,” his mother crooned, rocking him gently. She stroked his hair almost absently, as heart wrenching sobs erupted from his chest. “Your father’s brilliance blinded you. His shiny mask was always firmly in place with you, his grip on you too tight.”</p><p>“I’m sorry… I’m so, so sorry, mother.” Draco rose on one arm and cupped his mother’s cheek with his other hand.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’m sorry I failed you.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I should have been protecting you from him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Not dismissed you by his tongue.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And now…”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His face scrunched and crumpled as fresh tears careened down his cheeks. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“My darling child.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It wasn’t your place to protect me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is mine to protect you. I have done my best throughout the years, but I didn’t, couldn’t, truly speak out against him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is not your fault, my son.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I would be no good to you if I’d have gone the way of your friend Theo’s mother.”</p><p>Draco gasped.</p><p>“You don’t really think…”</p><p>“I don’t just think, my love.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I was there.” His mother stared at him, her placid stoic nature betrayed by the fire Draco saw in her gaze. “Cloeila was one of my best friends.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Agnar Nott made sure news of the unfortunate incident, as he called it, could fall from either of our lips—your fathers or mine.” Her lips thinned, her gaze lost to the past.</p><p>“What happened?” The soft-spoken words seemed to rouse his mother from her memories, but she shook her head.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Not a tale for today, my love.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Today is yours.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Today, we need to plan.”</p><p>“What’s there to plan?” Draco was suddenly angry.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He pushed away from where he sat nestled against his mother’s warmth, standing like a panther ready to strike the nearest prey.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’m royally and epically doomed mother.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There’s no way I’ll be able to carry out what the Dark Lord wants!!”</p><p>Pushing back his sleeve, he glared at the red throbbing mark pulsating against his pale skin. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>He’d always thought the mark fascinating, cut his teeth on the stories of the valiant Knights of Walpurgis and the followers of the Dark Lord that his father had told him. How they alone would uphold the traditions and sanctity of the magical community against those wishing to do it harm. How they alone would triumph over the mudbloods and blood traitors who spit upon the blessings from the gods and mother earth herself. How the Dark Lord would give them and their family's glory and magic beyond comprehension.</p><p>Draco hadn’t realised how blinded he’d been to the reality outside of the rose-coloured blanket that had covered his eyes and wrapped around him since birth.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Not until he’d begun Hogwarts, and a mudblood had beaten him in all classes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Every bloody year despite his academic efforts.</p><p>Hermione Granger, mudblood and disgustingly proud to be.</p><p>Not that that even mattered anymore.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She didn’t even matter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He couldn’t afford to care about anything passed the directly expected.</p><p>“I’m dead within the year mother, if I don’t do what the Dark Lord has ordered.”</p><p>“Then let’s keep you alive, my dragon.”</p>
