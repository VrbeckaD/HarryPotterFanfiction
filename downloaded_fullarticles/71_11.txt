    <p>Remus looked across at Sirius; the man was leaned over his vintage Fender 1958 Toploader Telecaster. It was Sirius’ pride and joy, he was extremely overprotective of it. Not that Remus completely blamed him, it had been something like £15000 when he had bought it for his 18th birthday. He had named it Francesca for a reason unknown to Remus, not that he ever cared enough to ask about it.</p><p> </p><p>Around the time Sirius was fifteen, he had become obsessed with guitars. One day after his physics class he informed James, Benjy, Peter and him that they were going to be in a band and that they need to pick an instrument. Remus learned how to play bass, Benjy was drums, James was keyboard and Peter was also guitar. After a month of their band, they had come across the problem of that they didn’t have a singer, everyone (but Remus) decided he was the best singer and that was how The Marauder’s started. They had mainly done weddings and small gigs during school holidays up until they left. Peter left the band around the time when he was twenty-one because he was going to work for his dad’s printing company. As he left he called everyone names and telling them that they will fail. </p><p> </p><p>They did continue to fail up until the night of Remus’ 25th birthday when they finally cracked Billboard charts. Sure, it was only number 11 but it was as if that gave them the perseverance to continue on, they got straight back into making more music. They have had a few songs chart in their home of the UK but nothing in the top 5. </p><p> </p><p>Sirius looked over his shoulder to find Remus looking at him, he quickly looked down at the bass guitar in his hands, pretending to be tuning it. “What is it?”</p><p> </p><p>“Nothing,” Remus shrugged it off. Despite being on opposite sides of the room, sometimes it felt almost intoxicating to be around Sirius. He would always suck Remus in and it always ended before anything really happened, that had been their relationship since they had both worked out they were into men. The longest time they had been together was 15 weeks and they had been 16 at the time.</p><p> </p><p>On Remus’ 25th birthday Sirius had broken up with him properly, it had been the most definitive break up they had. Sirius had just fucked him rough and hard before getting dressed and declaring that it was never going to happen again. At the time he hadn’t quite believed it, mainly because they had been doing the same dance for the last 10 years. They would date for roughly a month, something would happen and one of them would back off until they got lonely again. Except it has now been 4 months, the longest time they’ve gone apart from one another. </p><p> </p><p>“You’re giving me that look, so obviously it is something.” Sirius rolled his eyes as he carefully put the guitar on the stand. He turned around on the chair so that he was facing him.</p><p> </p><p>There were times Remus wished that he could go back to when their relationship wasn’t complicated by sex and feelings. Back to a time where he and Sirius were actually friends and didn’t just put up with each other. They had met when they were eleven on their first day at boarding school, from the moment they met, they became friends. Sirius had declared that they were going to be friends forever and they were up until Remus got drunk for the first time when he was fifteen and snogged him. It had seemed like a good idea at the time but in retrospect, it was probably his biggest regret.</p><p> </p><p>Remus had lost a friend that day, since then he has never managed to get him back.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s nothing Sirius, go back to wanking over Francesca,” Remus sighed running his fingers through his curly brown hair. He heard Sirius huff before the chair was being dragged across the hardwood floor making a horrible sound. When Remus looked up from his Ibanez SR800 Sirius was sitting less than a metre away from him with a frown on his face.</p><p> </p><p>Sirius cupped Remus’ face, his grey eyes boring into him. The pads of his fingers were calloused from picking the guitar strings. It took most of Remus’ self-restraint to not lean into the touch. “Tell me.”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re being a pest. I’m allowed to look at you.” Remus pushed the older man’s hand away from his face, before pushing the chair back to create more space between them.</p><p> </p><p>Sirius smirked running his hand through his black thick hair that fell to his shoulders, it had a slight wave to it. Girls (and some guys) seemed to love his hair, it was the physical feature that made him, <em> him </em>. “Never said you couldn’t, love.”</p><p> </p><p>“Just leave me alone,” he narrowed his eyes at his ex, well sort of ex. It wasn’t as if they ever actually were boyfriends, the most they ever were was dating. </p><p> </p><p>“Fine, be a cunt.” Sirius shrugged before dragging the chair back to its original spot. He picked up Francesca and went back to inspect it, or whatever he does with it. </p><p> </p><p>James and Benjy walked back into the green room, with a brown paper bag full of Thai food in their hands. Benjy sighed when he saw him and Sirius sitting at opposite sides of the room. “What happened?” </p><p> </p><p>“Nothing, we're both just minding our own business,” Remus shrugged putting Etta, his bass, on the stand before making his way over to the couch that positioned in the middle of the room.</p><p> </p><p>“He has been looking at me funny!” Sirius scoffed before sitting on the floor diagonally across from Remus, trying to put room between them both without it being seen as that. </p><p> </p><p>Remus rolled his eyes. “You’re being paranoid.”</p><p> </p><p>“Stevie, Lindsey fucking work it out,” Benjy groaned, waving the biodegradable fork between him and Sirius, </p><p> </p><p>“He’s Lindsey,” Sirius pointed to Remus with the plastic lid from his prawn pad thai. </p><p> </p><p>Remus rolled his eyes again. Remus had no idea how he was Lindsey Buckingham, he was the easy-going one while Sirius constantly started shit. Which was one of the main reasons they never lasted as a couple, Sirius just liked to fight with everyone. “How am I Lindsey? You’re the self-obsessed knobhead,”</p><p> </p><p>Benjy sat across from Remus on the floor as he opened his massaman beef. “Who gives a shit who Lindsey is?”</p><p> </p><p>“I do,” Sirius and Remus said in unison. James, who was sitting next to Remus on the couch burst out laughing. </p><p> </p><p>There was something about Remus’ relationship with James which made him feel almost uneasy at times. While he was both his and Sirius’ biggest support, as a couple and individuals, he was notorious for picking Sirius’ side in everything besides music. It wouldn’t surprise him if James would take Sirius’ side if he murdered someone.</p><p> </p><p>When it came to music though, James trusted Remus a lot more than Sirius, which would cause more issues between them. One particular time, when they were recording their first album when they were 21, they had been dating for almost two months until Sirius kicked off because James preferred Remus’ bassline idea over his. Sirius had ended up breaking up with him five minutes later during their smoke break.</p><p> </p><p>Remus knew why Sirius always fought with him, it was because he was insecure that he would leave him; not in the romantic sense though, just one day that he would pack up and disappear off the face of the earth. It was his way to deal with the abandonment from his family, he just pushed away everyone else but James and his fiance Lily. Most of the time Remus just brushed off the digs and things said under breaths because he knew where it was coming from. Sometimes though, Sirius would say something heinous and Remus would walkout, which Sirius would follow him out apologising profusely.</p><p> </p><p>Despite Remus knowing how toxic their relationship can be, it always started brilliantly each time they tried. It was probably why they kept going back to one another. Though when the band wasn’t doing much, not on tour or recording, was when it’s at its best because there were fewer arguments. Sirius would kiss Remus awake after making breakfast for them both, sometimes it was forgotten about, they would just hang out and watch movies, do normal couple things. Then a work commitment always came up and brought them back to the reality that they will never work and they break up again. </p><p> </p><p>James sighed. “Imagine putting your differences aside and not jeopardising the band over your penises.”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s never going to happen,” Benjy shook his head as he shovelled the beef into his mouth. </p><p> </p><p>Remus groaned falling back into the couch, he ran his fingers through his hair, it was something he had picked up from Sirius when he’s stressed. Over the years they had all picked up each other’s mannerisms since they have lived together since they were eleven. James and Benjy had both moved out of their flat and in with their partners, it made some days awkward when either Sirius or he decided to have someone over.</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t have an issue with him, he’s the one constantly starting shit with me,” he said defensively. Sirius just rolled his eyes and continued to eat his noodles. </p><p> </p><p>“Alright, you two just shut up and eat,” James said shoving the container full of larb at Remus. </p><p> </p><p align="center">⁂</p><p> </p><p>Remus was sitting at the dining table, in front of him was album cover ideas that none of them tickled his fancy. Sirius’ idea was a black background with a white skull and two flowers poking out the top, while Benjy’s was a close up on a black cat's yellow eyes. Neither of them seemed to capture the album concept.</p><p> </p><p>It was two days after the disagreement with Sirius, which had been forgotten about on the other man’s half but constantly replayed in Remus’ mind. That was another reason why they never seemed to work, Sirius was very much brush everything off and pretend it never happened and constantly gave shit to Remus for mulling over things. Their personalities seemed so different at times, he wondered how they ever became friends.</p><p> </p><p>The front door opened and laughter slipped into the room, giving it a life that it hadn’t had for a while. Sirius came into their flat, holding the hand of a red-haired man that Remus recognised. The man was taller than Sirius, not by much though, he only came up to his eyes and was broad-shouldered and seemed to be quite bulky. It was almost the opposite of Remus, who was thin and lanky, the only that they had in common was that they were both taller than Sirius, Remus beating both as Sirius came up to his chin. “Oh, sorry, I thought you would be out,” Sirius slurred as he kicked off his shoes. </p><p> </p><p>“Hm no, just going over album stuff,” Remus shook his head, he was in no mood to fight with him so he decided to keep the conversation as brief as he could.</p><p> </p><p>“This is Gideon Prewett, from the Prewett Brothers,” Sirius mumbled walking over to the kitchen pulling Gideon along for the ride. Remus gave the man a short wave, he nodded back as an acknowledgement. The Prewett Brothers were a name in the music production side of things, Remus remembered meeting them briefly one night the last time he and Sirius were together. Sirius opened a bunch of cupboards looking for something before sighing loudly. “Angel, babe, love, where’s the vodka?”</p><p> </p><p>Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Gideon look at him suspiciously, it was probably because he came back with Sirius under the pretence that they were going to shag but now he was preoccupied with finding more alcohol and calling his flatmate pet names. Remus wanted to roll his eyes at all the pet names he used in one sentence but he didn’t have the heart to, also if Sirius saw him roll his eyes it would create more conflict. He also wanted to tell him to not call him that, but again he wanted to avoid arguing with Sirius, especially while he was drunk. Not that he would admit it out loud but he quite enjoyed being called pet names by Sirius, which was the problem. The lines between them when they’re not dating is continuously blurred; Remus thought it was because they have gone back and forth between each other for so long they don’t know how to be just friends. “I don’t know, wherever you had it last.”</p><p> </p><p>Sirius turned on the spot, looking at him accusingly with a hand on his hip and all the cupboard doors open. “You haven’t drunk any?” </p><p> </p><p>“I don’t drink vodka, you know that,” he sighed as he watched his flatmate walk back over to the cupboard where they keep most of the alcohol. </p><p> </p><p>“Oh yeah, it makes you a slut.” Sirius’ hair whipped around when he turned to Gideon who was leaning against the benchtop across from the alcohol cupboard. “He’s a slut when he has vodka.”</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t as if he was a slut when he had vodka, just every time he drank it he got horny. The first time Remus kissed Sirius he had been drinking vodka, after that moment it became known that Remus was horny vodka drinker. If someone asked him, he would say he has done a lot more stupid stuff while drinking other types of alcohol but nobody cared. He just played it safe and didn’t drink vodka to save himself from everyone’s comments.</p><p> </p><p>Gideon smirked at Sirius, his gaze settled on the smaller man’s arse. “What about you?”</p><p> </p><p>“Wouldn’t you like to know?” Sirius said, his voice sounded silky. It was Sirius’ flirting/seducing voice which Remus knew all too well, especially when he whispered sexual things in his ear while using it. </p><p> </p><p>“I would, that’s why I’m asking,” the man stepped closer to Sirius. </p><p> </p><p>Sirius went to grab a bottle out of the cupboard but spun around at the same time, causing it to fall and shatter on the ground. Glass cut into his foot as he stepped back to get out of the mess. “Fuck.”</p><p> </p><p>Remus got up from the dining room table before helping Sirius waddle over to a seat. “Fucking hell, sit down.”</p><p> </p><p>“My foot hurts,” he whined moving his foot onto his lap to inspect the damage. It wasn’t that bad, shards were cutting into him but it wasn’t as if blood was oozing out.</p><p> </p><p>“I know,” he sighed as he tucked a piece of hair behind Sirius’ ear. While watching Sirius pick the glass out of his foot he decided to ask Gideon if he could watch over him while he gets the first aid kit out of the bathroom. “Can you-” he started asking before stopping when he noticed Gideon was gone. It didn’t surprise him, the man was after a shag not playing doctors. </p><p> </p><p>“What?” Sirius looked across at him confusedly, his eyebrows were furrowed. There was a tug at Remus' heart from the expression, if Sirius wasn’t drunk, he would have probably kissed him.</p><p> </p><p>Shaking the thoughts from his head, he started to walk out of the kitchen to get the first aid kit. “Nothing, just stay there. I’m going to get Dettol.”</p><p> </p><p>“Where am I going to go? Cardiff?” Remus didn’t have to see Sirius’ face to know that he rolled his eyes and probably folded his arms. He continued to walk towards the bathroom. </p><p> </p><p>“Knowing you, it’s a possibility,” Remus called out as he opened the cupboard and got out the red bag full of random medical stuff that they basically never used. </p><p> </p><p>“Fuck off,” Sirius yelled out across the flat. </p><p> </p><p>“Give me your foot,” Remus said once he sat next to Sirius got the Dettol and cotton wool out of the bag. He stretched the foot out that didn’t have glass across Remus’ thigh. “The other one.”</p><p> </p><p>Sirius huffed but swapped legs. He quickly found some medical looking tweezers in the bag and removed the rest of the glass from the foot. After he poured the antiseptic liquid onto a cotton ball, he immediately regretted it how much he used as it spilled onto his hand and it smelled really bad. When the cotton ball made contact with the cut Sirius flinched and swore, Remus had to grab his ankle to keep him still. A sigh of relief escaped Sirius mouth when Remus screwed the lid shut on the bottle of Dettol. </p><p> </p><p>There was a brief moment of silence while they sat in the breakfast bar chairs, with Sirius foot still resting on Remus’ lap. “You have really beautiful eyes, have I ever told you that?”</p><p> </p><p>“A few times,” Remus chuckled. Sirius had told Remus countless times about how his eyes are so beautiful and the gateway to his soul. </p><p> </p><p>Sirius’ hand made its way to the curls that hung over Remus’ forehead, twisting it around his finger. Something was hanging in the air which made it clear that Sirius was going to say something he won't remember. “I miss you.”</p><p> </p><p>“Sirius,” Remus sighed, carefully pushing Sirius’ hand away from his face.</p><p> </p><p>There were so many reasons why this shouldn’t happen, mainly because of their history and Sirius was in no state to talk about figuring their relationship out. Their relationship was toxic while they worked together, Sirius couldn’t separate work from home and liked to argue until he his voice gave way. He knew that it wasn’t all Sirius’ fault, Remus sucked at relationships in general. During an argument they had, Sirius had called him emotionally stunted and it stung because it felt like the truth at times. It wasn’t if he didn’t have emotions, he just couldn’t express them in conversation which is why he did music. The problem was there was only so many <em> I'm sorry </em> songs he could write for Sirius before he got tired of it, which he did very quickly. </p><p> </p><p>“No, I know, just I do,” he said, looking sad. One of the worst aspects of their relationship is that they were aware of how much they cared for another, but for some reason, they could never stay together. While Tenille Doram said love will keep us together, Remus believed that Ian Curtis was on the right track with love will tear us apart. “Sometimes I wonder how we became so fucked up.”</p><p> </p><p>“We’re just two puzzle pieces that don’t fit together but are in the same puzzle,” Remus sighed. </p><p> </p><p>“I don’t believe that.” Sirius clicked his tongue against his teeth. “I don’t believe that we won’t end up together.”</p><p> </p><p>The optimism Sirius had Remus admired, only he could look at something that has failed every single time and still think it was salvageable. It was probably because of the amount of time and effort they had both put in to make them work. Not because Sirius actually loves and wants to be with him. “How much have you had to drink?”</p><p> </p><p>“Dunno,” he shrugged as he held his index finger and thumb barely a millimetre apart. “Just a lil bit.”</p><p> </p><p>“I think it’s more than that,” Remus rolled his eyes.</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t be so patronising.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not.”</p><p> </p><p>“I get nervous around you.”</p><p> </p><p>Remus frowned. Growing up, Sirius was always cooler than Remus, he had girls following him around and wanting to be with him. Before the band even remotely took off, Remus had no idea how to talk to Sirius. He felt that he was always going to say the wrong thing and fuck everything up, which he still worries about now. It was a little bit of a mind fuck to find out that Sirius gets nervous around him. “Why?”</p><p> </p><p>“I just want you to like me…”</p><p> </p><p>“Sirius, I wouldn’t live with you if I disliked you.” the older man reached across before holding Remus hand against his chest where his heart was pounding. </p><p> </p><p>“I want you to <em> like </em> me,” Sirius said, his voice breaking at the like. His big grey eyes were sad, like a puppy dog. Remus hated that was how he made him feel, he was constantly torn between pushing him away and pulling him in closer. </p><p> </p><p>Remus sighed, he utterly loved Sirius despite his antics. Not that he had ever told him that or was planning on it, he just kept everything to himself until he wanted to explode. Even then, he never talked about his feelings, it just felt like he was burdening everyone else with his problems. Writing songs was his outlet, where he could write everything he was feeling down. Half of the songs never actually made it to daylight, mostly because being in a band with his ex made him nervous about the songs. Sirius always questioned the songs he thought were decent, what they were inspired from which was him more often than not, but it wasn’t as if he would admit that either. </p><p> </p><p>“If you still feel that way in the morning, we can talk then but not while you’re drunk,” Remus scratched his chin, he could feel the stubble beneath his fingers and made a mental note to shave tomorrow. </p><p> </p><p>When Sirius was drunk and Remus’ guard goes down was how they kept making the same stupid mistakes. Remus didn’t know how to let Sirius down gently or at all really, so they usually ended up either sleeping together or getting together. The only way to stop these things happening over and over, like groundhog day, was for Remus to not be drunk around drunk Sirius. </p><p> </p><p>“I’ve felt this way since I was thirteen, it’s not going to change in one night,” Sirius explained. Just as Remus was going to say something, Sirius vomited all over the kitchen bench. </p><p> </p><p>“Fucking hell,” he said moving Sirius’ leg off his. He grabbed the sponge and antibacterial spray and cleaned up the mess. </p><p> </p><p>Sirius was looking at him with his big puppy dog eyes. “Sorry.”</p><p> </p><p>After cleaning it up Sirius’ vomit on the bench, Remus got a napkin and cleaned the vomit from around his mouth. He knew he should’ve probably made Sirius do it, but he felt bad because of the conversation that took place before it happened. Also, the overprotective part of Remus, which he tried not to act on, liked taking care of Sirius because at least then he knew that he was safe.</p><p> </p><p>“You’ve got some there.” his ex pointed to the vomit mark on his black shirt. Remus groaned as he took it off and put it in the washing machine that was hidden behind a cupboard door.</p><p> </p><p>“Let’s get you to bed,” he said tucking the hair that came loose behind Sirius’ ear. </p><p> </p><p>“Moony, you minx.” he wiggled his eyebrows as if he didn’t just vomit. He jumped off the chair before crying out when his foot made contact with the floor. “My foot hurts.”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re such a princess at times,” Remus went over to Sirius and picked him up, carrying him bridal style to his bedroom.</p><p> </p><p>“Only for you,” Sirius smiled up at him adoringly before pressing a kiss on his cheek. “You need to shave, your face is prickly.”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s to keep away certain drunk guitarists.” </p><p> </p><p>“I didn’t know you wanted to keep Keith Richards away.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, I was <em>definitely</em> referring to Keith and not the drunken guitarist I am carrying to bed,” Remus laughed as he put Sirius down on his bed, he laid down on his back. Remus went over and turned the lamp that was next to the bed on before unbuttoning Sirius’ jeans and pulled them down his legs before removing his shirt, so Sirius was just in his pants. “Lay on your side.”</p><p> </p><p>“Why?” he asked rolling onto his side. </p><p> </p><p>Remus pulled the bed covers back, Sirius not bothering to move made it more difficult. He pulled the sheet over him but left the duvet off as it was mid-July and quite hot. “So if you vomit in your sleep you don’t choke on it and die like Jimi Hendrix.”</p><p> </p><p>“How tragic would that be,” Sirius mumbled. </p><p> </p><p>There was a hair tie on the bedside table, so Remus took it before sitting behind him. He ran his fingers through Sirius’ hair before starting to put it in a french braid so if he vomited again it wouldn’t get in his hair. “Very, I would become a hermit. It’ll be very sad on my behalf.”</p><p> </p><p>“I want you to write songs about how sad you are without me, I want you to throw yourself at my coffin,” he hummed as Remus continued to braid his hair. </p><p> </p><p>Braiding was a skill he had learnt for Sirius, mainly because he used to get in trouble for having his hair out in chemistry and it was a way to get him on his own. Almost ten years later, Sirius still didn’t know how to braid his own hair and depended on Remus to do it. </p><p> </p><p>“I’ll try to remember that,” Remus rolled his eyes as he tied the end of the braid which finished at the name of his neck. “Do you want your boxers or are you good with what you’ve got on?”</p><p> </p><p>“I wanna be naked,” Sirius said shifting under the sheet before throwing his dirty pants across the room. </p><p> </p><p>“Of course you do.”</p><p> </p><p>“Stay with me.”</p><p> </p><p>“Sirius…”</p><p> </p><p>“What if I roll over during the night and vomit and die? If you spoon me, that won’t happen.” he looked at him with his sad puppy dog eyes again. The worst thing was that it was a compelling argument.</p><p> </p><p>“Fine, but I’m getting the vomit bucket.” Remus got up and went to the bathroom to get it. The bucket wasn’t actually a bucket, it was an old 4L ice cream container that they used for all sorts of things. Mostly vomiting, sometimes bathing a hand or foot, one time Benjy decided to tie-dye with it. He put it on the floor next to Sirius before laying next to him on top of the sheet, determined to keep the barrier between them.</p><p> </p><p>“Night, angel,” Sirius mumbled as he grabbed Remus’ arm and wrapped it around him. </p><p><br/>
