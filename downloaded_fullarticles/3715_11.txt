    <p>Remus let out a sigh and rubbed his forehead, trying to ease the ever-persistent wrinkles that had started to form there. As a senior resident in the ER department of the local city hospital, it was almost as if everyone in the city were trying to get themselves killed. He had just finished his final check on a 9-year-old boy who had fallen down the stairs while playing tag with his friends.</p><p>“Exhausted already? Your shift just started,” a feminine voice said from behind him. Remus turned to find the other senior resident in the ER department facing him. Her red hair was tied in a tight ponytail and she was wearing the bright yellow scrubs the hospital had designated for all the doctors because “we want to be a friendly, cheerful hospital” as if wearing yellow somehow kept patients from screaming out in agony or from flat-out dying within seconds of entering the trauma bay.</p><p>“Ha,” Remus replied, his lips quirking slightly upwards at seeing his best friend for the first time in a month. They had become friends on the first day of med school when both had reached out for the same book on anatomy - the last book, too, mind you - at the college library, and ultimately decided to share it. “I’m on my second shift of the day,” he pointed to Lily, “<em>you</em> just came back from your honeymoon with James. How was it?” This time Remus gave her a full smile.</p><p>“Oh my <em>god</em>, it was <em>perfect</em>,” she replied, her eyes shining with happiness, her mouth curving upwards. “And,” Lily paused, “I’m pregnant!” Remus stared at the redhead in shock, his mouth gaping.</p><p>“Um, details, please.”</p><p>“I suspected it when we got married, and then on the second week, James had a work emergency so he was cooped up in the room all day, and then I went and bought a pregnancy kit, and,” Lily spoke excitedly, her voice rising in pitch. She held up her hand, palms facing Remus, “as a doctor I chose the most accurate one, obviously, and,” Lily squealed, both hands curving against her still-flat stomach, “I’m pregnant. You should’ve seen James’ face, Re, he was so happy. He even cried.”</p><p>“I’m so happy for you, Lils,” Remus replied, taking her into his arms. “I better be the godfather.”</p><p>“Of course,” she laughed, her right patting his left cheek.</p><p>“Dr. Lupin, Dr. Evans, if you have both finished your very important conversation, and would be so kind as to start treating patients sometime today it would be much appreciated.” Remus looked over Lily’s shoulder and spotted the hospital’s Chief of Staff, Dr. McGonagall, leaning against the break room door, her arms loosely crossed under her chest. <em>Shit</em>. “Congrats on the baby, Dr. Evans.” She promptly left, her steps light with her white coat swishing behind her.</p><p>Lily swiftly untangled herself from her best friend and Remus found himself hugging the empty air where Lily had stood for a very short moment. He watched as Lily squared her shoulders and walked out into the ER. He followed in her stead.</p><p>“Do you think we’re in trouble?” Lily asked as they made their way to the head nurse, Molly, to get assigned to one of the trauma bays.</p><p>“Honestly, I have no clue.” Remus shrugged his shoulders before giving Molly a small wave.</p><p>“Lucky day, today, much less patients on average. There’s a patient for Dr. Evans in trauma bay 4, GSC 15, complaining about arm pain. She slipped in the bathroom while taking a shower,” Molly greeted them. She handed her the hospital iPad which held all of the patient’s information and records. Lily ran off to treat her patient, tugging the stethoscope hanging off her neck. “For you, GSC 14, the paramedics say he has a broken tibula, and they’ve put a temporary splint on it. Trauma bay 2.” Remus took the iPad Molly offered him, walking towards trauma bay 2. He stopped in his tracks when he came across the name.</p><p>
  <em>Sirius Black.</em>
</p><p>Remus had certainly heard it somewhere before, but at the moment he couldn’t remember. He shrugged it off and continued his way towards the small space that held his patient, who according to the records had been “driving a gorgeous, 1,000cc BMW motorbike that had slid and landed on his leg.” He shook his head in disapproval; he had seen enough motorbike accidents to never get on one himself. He pictured a middle-aged man with an affinity for biking (and maybe a part of some obscure motorcycle gang), with a temporary cast on his leg.</p><p>What Remus absolutely in his wildest dreams, did not expect was a gorgeous man with jet-black wavy hair that reached his shoulders lying on the white rolling bed. <em>Fuck</em>. He was totally fucked. As his third year in residency, he had seen more than his fair share of patients but no one could look this good. It should be illegal to look that good. Remus was certain that if someone with a cardiovascular disease or a history of heart attacks would take one look at this man, they <em>would</em> have a heart attack. And he was a doctor. He knew these kind of things.</p><p>“Hi, I’m Doctor Remus Lupin,” he greeted, grateful that his voice didn’t shake, “and I will be taking care of you today. Firstly, we’re-”</p><p>“You’re cute,” the man – <em>Sirius Black</em> – interrupted. <em>Yep</em>, Remus thought, <em>I’m definitely screwed.</em></p>
