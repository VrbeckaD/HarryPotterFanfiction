    <p> </p>
<p>Harry had been surprised when Hagrid had told him he was a wizard. He could have never imagined that he was one of the few in the world who could do magic. But it was true, he was special, he could do magic. And, that knowledge gave him happiness beyond measure. It negated everything his relatives had hurled at him since he could understand things.</p>
<p>He wasn't a freak; abnormal.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry also noticed that his family had stopped bothering him after Hagrid had threatened all of them. His aunt and uncle even gave him Dudders second bedroom; that seemed to be the only perk of being a wizard. And, if he was being honest, it was the only one he cared about.  </p>
<p>It was very tiring to look after the whole house every day, he didn't even get to eat for whole days sometimes. His muscles hurt and the beatings didn't help either. It hurt. It really hurt. Not to mention, he couldn’t even breathe properly sometimes in the closet under the cupboard.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He was pretty happy with his new conditions, he wasn’t doing chores around the house anymore and he could breathe properly. It was nice to breathe in the fresh air and see the sky from the windows. They still starved him though. </p>
<p> </p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>When Harry had found out what had really happened to his parents, he’d come to a realization. He knew people will treat him differently once he will enter the wizarding world. They will refuse to see him, Harry, and only see the boy who lived. He should have known that nothing that good came without some problems. He didn’t like spotlight, he never had. He was happy to know, though, that his parents hadn’t been drunkards.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>It was a little weird that he was revered because he hadn’t died. A baby couldn’t have done anything to this Voldemort. It must’ve been his parents who’d done something remarkable. He also wondered why no one was bothered that he had been living in a cupboard under the stairs all this time. They did know where he was, the first letter was proof of that.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What kind of teaching institution wouldn’t care about a child’s living conditions? That too a magical one. That was very odd. That was something he will ask the headmaster of the school. He was sure Hagrid would not have been be able to give him an answer even if he’d asked him.</p>
<p> </p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry looked around the platform, but all he could see were people going about their day. He’d flinched when the guard had given him a funny look when he’d asked about the platform 9 ¾ quarters.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>With time, Harry started getting nervous and was thinking he might as well go back and send Hedwig to Hogwarts.  His aunt had given him plenty of money, he could make the journey back to Privet Drive without any problem. Hagrid had explained how owls worked in wizarding world, but he had forgotten to tell him how to get on the train.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He didn’t know how to get to platform 9¾ quarters.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry was contemplating going back when he heard a large family of redheads muttering about muggles.</p>
<p>That made him extremely wary of them.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>How were these people just shouting about muggles and magic in a place brimming with non-magic folk? Granted, people around them were busy, but Hagrid had told him that the wizarding world was a secret.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He didn’t approach them, he didn’t want to approach them. Instead, he quietly saw how each and every one of them went inside the barrier between nine and ten. Then, when there were a few people around, he went inside the barrier too.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry smiled brightly as he saw the Hogwarts Express and children carrying owls and chatting with their families. He’d done it.</p>
<p> </p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry found a quiet compartment to himself and spent the journey with eating sweets and treats with his owl. He had taken out a lot of coins from his bank account which had made Hagrid cry. He was wearing rags after all, it wasn't that hard to figure out why he'd taken so many coins. Now, he could eat as many sweets as he wants and wear clean and good clothes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He was about to take out a book to read when he heard a knock on the glass panel. Two tall boys entered the compartment and gave him a friendly smile.  From their robes, Harry figured out they were in Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff. He’d read some books at home and had found them fascinating.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>They asked him his name and were pretty friendly, but he deliberately did not tell them his full name. This will be a test. He’ll see how they’ll react to him after they know who he is. If it’ll turn out he is right, well, it’s not like being alone is a new thing for him.</p>
<p> </p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry looked at the lake and gulped in fear. He was extremely scared of getting inside the boat. He’d never been on one before, his relatives had never taken him for any vacation. He hoped to God he would not fall. The lake looked scary. He didn't know how to swim.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But his worry lessened as Hagrid patted him on the back and helped him in one. He gave the half giant a relieved smile and Hagrid nodded his head. He was glad Hagrid hadn’t called him Potter.</p>
<p> </p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry grimaced as he saw all the kids pushing each other down to get a good look at him when his name was called. He snuck a glance at the two who had shared an apartment with him, and was relieved to see they weren’t acting like hooligans. They did look a little shocked, though. Maybe Cedric Diggory and Roger Davies weren’t so bad.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You’d well in Slytherin, Harry,” the Sorting Hat said to Harry Potter.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The hat was surprised to know the boy was extremely wary of everyone. It seemed he really didn’t care if everyone knew him and that he was famous.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“But, isn’t that the house dark wizards usually are in? Already I am being gawked at, I don’t want these people to look more at me. I wouldn’t be surprised if they think I am the next dark lord and that’s why I was able to defeat Voldem…” Harry scrunched his nose adorably. “Um, You Know Who. Sorry, Hagrid was scared of saying his name.”  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The hat was astounded. It just didn’t know what to think after hearing that from Harry Potter.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He’d sorted Tom Riddle into Slytherin because he had all the attributes of Salazar’s house. In fact, Tom Riddle could have been an exceptional Gryffindor because he was too brave. Not reckless, but brave; the kid hadn’t feared anything except death.</p>
<p>And, he could have been an exceptional Ravenclaw because no one, no one was as brilliant as Tom riddle. He should know, he’d seen every kid’s head. Tom Riddle’s mind was on par with Rowena herself. But, his Slytherin like qualities were more profound, and he’d known he was Salazar’s family. The boy had belonged in Slytherin.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He had not said anything to the kid because the boy himself didn’t know it. Tom Riddle had been scared too. He’d seen the boy was angry after being ridiculed for his clothes and blood status.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>No, Tom Riddle or as the boy had come to call himself, Voldemort, was wrong. But so were the people around him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Harry, you have surprised me, child. You are a good human and you’ll do well in any house. But, you are too kind, and you only belong in Hufflepuff. Helga would’ve loved you and your parents must be proud of you.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Hufflepuff.”  The sorting hat shouted and the Great Hall turned deathly quiet.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But, after a few minutes, the whole house of badgers stood up and started clapping vigorously. They were soon joined by other houses, and Harry went and sat down at his house table.</p>
<p> </p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry was happy. He’d had some reservations about the school, but thankfully they turned out wrong.  He liked his classes and talked to a few people who didn't make him uncomfortable. He knew people will be weird around him, so he was always very careful.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Students soon found out Harry wasn’t interested in being an antique in a shop, so, most of them stopped staring at him and whispering behind his back.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry also had a feeling that Professor Sprout and Professor Flitwick were responsible for some of it. He had thanked them and had felt content when they’d patted his head.</p>
<p>He had seen them berating a girl who always spoke in class even when she wasn’t asked.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>“He is being stupid, he should know about himself. Doesn’t he know who he is? He should be proud.”</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>“Thirty points from Gryffindor, Miss Granger for your attitude. Please mind your own business. You have no right to tell anyone what they should or shouldn’t feel. How dare you call him stupid?” Flitwick said in an unamused tone.</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>The kid was already wary enough of wizarding world, and if people like Miss Granger will not shut up, the boy will think that everyone only cares about him because he defeated Tom Riddle.</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>Sprout was openly scowling at Hermione and bunch of other Gryffindors who were whispering the same nonsense as their housemate.</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry talked to her and a redheaded boy later. He was surprised when the conversation didn’t end up badly. He didn’t think it would go smoothly, it never did with Dudley’s friends.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Did it occur to you that maybe I didn’t want people to gawk at me? I just want to be an ordinary boy. My parents died for me, isn’t that enough?”</p>
<p>Ron Weasley flinched and Hermione Granger looked close to tears after hearing that.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry was shocked, though, when they two met him later and apologized for their behaviour.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Sorry, Harry. I also thought of seeing your scar, but it was wrong. Sorry.” Ron said with a sad expression on his face. He didn’t want to make Harry uncomfortable.</p>
<p>“I am sorry for being so insensitive. It’s your life, you should live it as you want, not how wizarding world sees you.” Hermione said with a sad smile.</p>
<p>Harry nodded at them both and went on his way.</p>
<p> </p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry thought McGonagall and Snape were okay, but Sprout and Flitwick were especially nice to him. Snape had tried to rile him a little in the beginning, but after two months of classes, he hadn’t singled him out in any way.  In fact, the man nodded at him when he made the potion well.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry also liked his flying lessons and was pretty happy when Hooch awarded him thirty points for doing well. He had also helped Neville,  his housemate in the potions class. Neville was nice. He liked him a lot.</p>
<p>He also became good friends with two upperclassmen: Roger Davies who was a Ravenclaw, and Cedric Diggory who was a Hufflepuff like him.  He was also good friends with Susan Bones, who was a First year like him and Neville, and their housemate. He always felt calm and content when he talked to the four, they were nice. It was nice to have people who didn't care if he had defeated a Dark Lord.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ron and Hermione were still his acquaintances, but maybe, someday they might become his friends too. They exchanged nods and polite greeting in classes they had together, which weren’t many.</p>
<p> </p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry was surprised when he was approached by a Slytherin. He didn’t think Slytherins would like him, what with the reputation of having produced most dark wizards and he had defeated one of them. But, Draco Malfoy seemed to have seen his wariness with his fame, and had not been mean.</p>
<p>Slytherins didn’t have a good reputation among the school. But, he had no qualms in talking to Draco in corridors like he talked to Ron and Hermione. Draco hadn’t said anything bad to him, so he had no problems in talking to him.</p>
<p> </p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry wasn’t surprised when he learned the Philosopher’s Stone was at school. The headmaster was friends with the maker of the stone after all.</p>
<p>He’d heard Quirrell muttering about it being in school.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>“I need the stone, without the Philosopher’s Stone, my master can’t get better. I failed getting it from Gringotts that day, but how to get past that bloody thing…”</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It wasn’t that hard to figure out what his professor meant. He was sure he must be the one who had let that troll in too.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hagrid had taken something from a vault in Gringotts when they had visited his account. Then there was news in the Daily Prophet about Gringotts being robbed the very same day. And, Quirrell had been there at the Leaky Cauldron. He may not be a Ravenclaw like Roger, but he wasn't stupid either.</p>
