    <p>By the time the duo arrive at the main doors, Hermione already likes Luna’s quirkiness. She’s also much more observant than she first appears, and Hermione thinks Luna sees the world differently than most Gamma’s. She’s the first to inquire about her Madisntic’s Necklace that Hermione always wears.</p><p>“It’s battered and rough around the edges, but that’s what makes it so pretty. I wonder why beauty has to be refined and controlled,” Luna had said. The Gamma is going to be a First year, like Astoria and Ginny. She didn’t ride in the boats because she saw invisible magical creatures that led her to the carriages.</p><p>“How can you see something invisible?” Hermione questions, and Luna hums against her chest.</p><p>“Magic? I suppose the better question would be how can one see air?” The Gamma replies dreamily.</p><p>“Well, when other materials interact with it,” Hermione replies, and a bright smile is her reward. The rest of the side continues in silence until they reach Hogwarts’ front doors. Hermione stands gracefully, holding Luna against her as she hops out of the carriage.</p><p>Luna waves to the Thestrals as they walk into the castle. Putting the Gamma down, Hermione realizes the little witch is as tall as her elbow. Yet that doesn’t keep her from slowing Hermione down, in fact she’s matching Hermione’s longer stride by her skipping. Hermione sees Luna off in the side chamber to wait for the other First years, waving goodbye to the girl.</p><p>Walking the corridors to the Great Hall, Hermione’s good mood settles, and she enters the Great Hall, sticking to the back. Sliding into her seat between Daphne and Beta Tracey, Hermione settles on a neutral look.</p><p>“What took you so long?” Draco asks a little ways down the table, his group sitting closer to hers. Hermione shrugs, looking up at the High Table. Mainly to the new Defense Against the Dark Arts Professor.</p><p>“I found a First year who hitched a ride on the carriages.” Pansy whistles softly.</p><p>“That’s gusty—they’re probably going to be a Gryffindor,” Omega Tracey muses, but Hermione shakes her head.</p><p>“No, she won’t.” She says, thinking about Luna. Daphne shrugs.</p><p>“Well she missed seeing the Black Lake at night,” The Beta says, and there are murmurs of agreement.</p><p>“Her loss,” Millicent snorts.</p><p>“On a different topic, where’s your two Gryffindors?” Pansy nods over to the red and gold table. Hermione looks up, scanning the students. Harry and Ron aren’t there, but fortunately Neville is. They lock gazes, and he smiles a bit, waving. She nods at him, her eyes flicking over to the Hufflepuff table. Harold’s talking with two other boys in their year; Omega Conner Moon and Beta Justin Finch-Fletchley.</p><p>He must of felt her eyes, because he looks up, giving her a thumbs up. Glancing over to the Gryffindor table, she remembers Arthur’s flying car. Sighing, Hermione knows where they are, or rather where they will be. How could they have decided flying a car to Hogwarts was a good idea, she’ll never know. At least they were smart enough to follow the train tracks.</p><p>“They’ll arrive, eventually.” Hermione responds noncommittally. Pansy nods, accepting the Slytherin answer. Waiting for the First years to arrive is boring, mixed with a growing anticipation that builds from the rest of the school. Finally, the doors open, and she watches the First years enter.</p><p>She easily spots Ginny, Luna, and Astoria with their distinctive hair colors. She also spots the familiar face of Peter Silverthorn. Her mind tunes out the rest of the new kids, as she waits for the four names.</p><p>“Greengrass, Astoria!” There's a beat.</p><p>“SLYTHERIN!” The young Alpha leaps off the stool, a jubilated grin on her lips as she bounces over to Hermione and Daphne. Without skipping a beat, the Alpha wedges herself between them and settles on Hermione’s lap. Her year mates—excluding Daphne who has an exasperated look on her face—are shocked by the blatant display of familiarity.</p><p>“Lovegood, Luna!” Hermione looks up at the Gamma, seeing the Hat muttering to itself.</p><p>“She’s not going to be Sorted anytime soon,” Draco mutters. No sooner than he says this, the Hat perks up and cries out.</p><p>“RAVENCLAW!” Luna walks towards her table. Sitting down with the other Claws, the Gamma shines a dreamily smile at Hermione. She lifts her chin up slightly, and Luna tilts her head down in response, bowing to Hermione as her Alpha. A curious thought strikes Hermione, and she wonders if Luna could be the one.</p><p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The Gamma tilts her head, muttering under her breath, and Hermione feels a delicate brush of Luna’s magic against hers. She reaches out with her magic, entwining the offered, submissive olive branch, and the two meld together, the magic merging as it ebbs and flows between them.</p><p>Luna smiles dreamily, her head tilting to the other side, happy that Hermione accepted the Bounded-Vassal connection. Hermione turns her gaze back to the Sorting, the new link dissipating from their sight, but laying underneath their skins.</p><p>“Silverthorn, Peter!” The Hat barely touches his head and it cries out.</p><p>“HUFFLEPUFF!” The Alpha is grinning madly, as he races towards the yellow and black table.</p><p>“Weasley, Ginerva!” Ginny walks up nervously, and the Hat is placed on her head.</p><p>“GRYFFINDOR!” The Hat’s lifted, and Ginny’s grinning, joining her brothers. Right at that moment, Harry and Ron enter the Opening Feast, scratched up, but otherwise fine.</p><hr/><p> </p><p>The very nex day, the story of Harry and Ron crashing into the Whomping Willow spreads. Err’sh comes flying in a hurry for the morning mail. Not even landing, he drops the letter, and flies away. Picking it up the red letter, immediately everyone at the table is interested in it. Hermione, frowning at their sudden intrigue, opens it, and it explodes with a <em>BANG</em>.</p><p>“<b><em>HERMIONE ETO MENDONICA!—</em></b>” Hermione flinches as she hears Juin’s voice a hundred times louder than normal screaming her name from the letter, it forming a fanged mouth. Everyone turns to look at her.</p><p>“<b><em>—POURQUOI SUIS-JE OBTENIR DES INVITATIONS DE PORNO ENFANT DE TROIS DAMES À ROZNICA—POUR PERFORMER À UN NIGHTCLUB EN PUTAIN DE </em>CHINE?!<em> PLUS IMPORTANT—POURQUOI VOTRE SIGNATURE EST-IL SIGNÉ SUR CES PUTAIN DE PAPIERS?!—</em></b> [<em>—WHY AM I GETTING ROZANICA THRICE-DAMNED PORN INVITATIONS—TO PERFORM AT A NIGHTCLUB IN<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>FUCKING</em> CHINA?! <em>MORE IMPORTANTLY—WHY IS YOUR SIGNATURE SIGNED ON THOSE FUCKING PAPERS?!—</em>]”</p><p>Juin’s furious voice yells in French.</p><p>"<b><em>—</em><em>VOUS ÊTES SI CHANCEUX QUE JE NE PEUX PAS VOLER DROIT AUDESSUS ET RIP VOTRE LANGUE D’ARGENT DÉVIEUSE DE BOUCHE SALE ET DRAINEZ CHAQUE GOUTTE DE SANG DE VOUS PART VOUS PUIS TU TU EN UN SEAU DE GODET PENDANT QUE JE DÉCHIQUETTE TA PEAU EN MORECEAUX—</em></b> [<em>—YOU ARE SO LUCKY THAT I CAN’T FLY STRAIGHT OVER AND RIP YOUR DEVIOUS SILVER-TONGUE FROM YOUR FILTHY MOUTH AND DRAIN EVERY DROP OF BLOOD FROM YOU THEN DROWN YOU IN A BUCKET OF IT<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>WHILE I SHRED YOUR SKIN TO PIECES!—</em>]”</p><p>Hermione’s eyes widen at Juin’s aggressive savagery. She wonders if the Veela woman has ever cussed out other children she was pissed at before Elise came along.</p><p>“<b><em>—ATTENDS PETIT VAUTOUR—QUAND CETTE ÉCOLE SE TERMINE—VOUS—ÉTRE—FONDU—MORT!</em></b> [—JUST WAIT YOU LITTLE VULTURE—WHEN THAT SCHOOL ENDS—YOU—ARE—FUCKING—DEAD!]”</p><p>The letter takes a shuddering breath, then hisses at Hermione before shredding itself up. A smaller letter falls from inside it, opening as it falls. It’s from Annie and Claire.</p><p> </p><p>
  <b> <em>Hermione,</em> </b>
</p><p>
  <b> <em> </em> </b>
</p><p>
  <b> <em>Hope this gets to before Mother’s finds out. We went to a nightclub, and needed an adult’s signature, so we used yours. Yes, we know you’re not an adult. We’ll try and cancel the prescriptions that the club always sends out to volunteers, until then, thanks!</em> </b>
</p><p>
  <b> <em> </em> </b>
</p><p>
  <b> <em>Love,</em> </b>
</p><p>
  <b> <em>Annie</em> </b>
</p><p>

</p><p> </p><p>Hermione can’t help but snicker, knowing that Elise will calm Juin down, and Eto will make sure she doesn’t do anything rash. Her snickers grow into laughter, as the Great Hall stares in shock. Juin let out something that Hermione can use, she can’t enter England. Another explosion rocks the Great Hall, and everyone turns to see another Howler, this one from Molly to Ron.</p><hr/><p> </p><p>Hermione saunters into her first class, a pep in her step from the Howler. Daphne just shakes her head at her.</p><p>“I think you’re the only witch here that laughs at a <em>Howler</em>—”</p><p>“But did you actually <em>do</em> that?” Pansy interrupts, she one of the four other Slytherins that understood French. Hermione snorts, a smirk on her face.</p><p>“No, my nieces did,” Flora trips over Hestia’s shoes in shock.</p><p>“<em>Nieces?</em>” She gasps. Millicent eyes her suspiciously.</p><p>“How old <em>are</em> you?”</p><p>Daphne elbows her.</p><p>“You know it’s not polite to ask that,” The Beta hisses.</p><p>“Let’s just say that my much older sisters weren’t expecting me,” Hermione says with mirth, enjoying her own inside joke. They enter Greenhouse Three with the Hufflepuffs, Professor Sprout showing them Mandrakes. Hermione pays attention, until she sees Professor Lockhart walking with Harry outside. The Alpha’s just interested in making himself more famous by using Harry.</p><p>She honestly doesn’t know why he thinks he can do it; James Potter is only famous because he’s a Pureblood who survived a Death Eater attack. And she knows that Professor Lockhart got a warning from the Potter Alpha himself. Looking around, she finds Harold.</p><p>Smiling at him, she crosses the invisible House line, the two Hufflepuffs next to him shying away from her.</p><p>“Hey Lurch, how was your summer?” Harold asks, and she chuckles.</p><p>“Not bad, I met some interesting people, how about you Bluejay?” That prompts him to regal his miserable summer adventures with his cousins. In Transfiguration, she traps her beetle between her hands, and when she lifts her hand away there’s a nice button. Daphne merely rolls her eyes when Hermione pins the button onto her uniform.</p><p>Then comes Defense Against the Dark Arts class. Sitting on the Slytherin side, Beta Tracey as her seat partner, she scowls at the desk. Beta Tracey on the other hand, has all of Professor Lockhart’s books out, sighing as she strokes them. She knocks the Beta’s hand off the books, annoyed at the sound.</p><p>“Hey! What was that for?” Hermione doesn’t answer, but continues to glare at her desk. Beta Tracey humphs, but doesn’t do it again. Blaise and Theodore sitting at the desk next to them, lean over to her.</p><p>“Hey, is it true; you actually don’t like Lockhart?” Blaise asks, and the Slytherins around her quiet a bit to hear her answer.</p><p>“I don’t fancy anyone who look like a styled rat.” Hermione drawls. The girls around her look scandalized, while the boys snicker. As if on que from some higher being controlling their strings of life—the so called Professor Lockhart strolls in, pushing a terrified Harold in front of him.</p><p>Flashing the class a horse smile, Hermione stares at Harold, silently trying to make the Beta look up.</p><p>“What? Why is he here?” Ron asks loudly. The Alpha just smiles brightly.</p><p>“Why, I was helping this Gryffindor to my class! Say, if you want a photograph, you can go ask that new Gryffindor with the camera!” There are confused glances thrown Harold’s way. Hermione’s eyes are slits, and she stands up. The whole class turns to her.</p><p>“He is a Hufflepuff.” She says coldly, and Harold looks up at her. Professor Lockhart flounders, looking down at the Beta confused.</p><p>“Why, of course! You should of said something my boy!” He taps Harold’s shoulder, and Hermione’s striding forwards before she realizes it.</p><p>“House colors are simple enough to memorize, learn them. <em>Sir</em>.” She adds the honorific as an afterthought. Pulling Harold to her, she guides him out of the class. Once out, Harold lets out a shaky breath.</p><p>“Thanks Lurch, he—he used his pheromones—I couldn’t go,” Harold quickly whips his eyes, turning from her. Rage roars in her at the admission, but she stomps it down, not wanting to frighten the Beta even more.</p><p>“Harold, look at me,” He does, and she puts a comforting hand on his arm.</p><p>“Go to Professor Sprout, tell her about it, he’s not allowed to do that to students,” She says in a calm but firm tone. Harold nods.</p><p>“If he forces you again, tell me or Professor Sprout right away,” Hermione orders, and Harold nods again.</p><p>“Now go,” She gives him a gentle push, and he starts walking forwards, but then looks back at her.</p><p>“You’re the best Alpha I’ve ever met,” And then he’s gone.</p><hr/><p> </p><p>Walking back, Hermione opens the door to pandemonium. Student are running around, screaming, and Pixies are flying around chaotically. She sees Professor Lockhart shout a stupid charm; <em>Peskipiksi Pesternomi</em>; and then a Pixie throws his wand out of the window. Hermione looks up to see Neville deposited on the chandelier by two Pixies by his ears.</p><p>Sneering Hermione enters, slamming the door with a bang.</p><p>“<em>Silencio!</em>” She shouts, all sound cutting off. Everyone including the Pixies turn towards her. It’s just what she needs. Her her hand jerks up.</p><p>“<em>Immobulus!</em>” A blast of magic hits all the Pixies, freezing them all. Then they all fall, making clunking sounds. With another wave of her hand, Neville’s lowered to the ground. Snapping her head at Professor Lockhart, she scowls, glaring.</p><p>“<em>Clean this up.</em>” She orders in her Alfā voice, the pathetic Alpha nodding quickly. Turning to the rest of the class, she unsilences the class.</p><p>“Dismissed.” She orders, and whirls out of the class, her cloak’s billowing a bit like a mini Snape.</p><hr/><p> </p><p>When not antagonized by Professor Lockhart’s stupidity, Hermione finds her time outside of class is just as full as the classes themselves. Luna always appears when she’s alone, draping herself on Hermione no matter where they are. She, Harold, and Neville meet up in the Library, discussing their classes or other study matter. They’re occasionally joined by Daphne and Beta Tracey, but mostly left to themselves.</p><p>During the halls, she usually talks with Harry and Ron. They angrily informed her that the border had closed on them, and Ron swore he saw a cloaked figure watching them. Other than Professor Lockhart stalking Harry for more fame, a First year Beta Gryffindor has taken to appearing around corners to take photos of him.</p><p>Draco came up the nickname; Click-Clack for Colin Creevey. Or in Pansy’s case; Creepy Creevey. Even in the Muggle world there’s such as thing as “not consenting to have pictures taken of someone.” Hermione also has a few shadows of her own. Astoria is always demanding that Hermione accompany her on a tour of Hogwarts, Ginny always looks like she’s internally arguing with her whether or not she wants to approach, and Peter just watches from a distance.</p><p>Then, when she retires for the night, her year mates have her all to themselves. Astoria especially enjoys that time to sit in Hermione’s lap, play with her hair, and prank other Snakes. Her lack of social cues and Hermione’s nonchalance attitude towards it makes the young Alpha somewhat untouchable.</p><p>Beta Tracey is astonished that Hermione even tolerates such behavior amongst the Slytherins.</p><p>“As far as I’m concerned Astoria’s not damaging our reputation.” She drawls, thinking of the endlessly energized young Alpha.</p><p>“You’re joking—you’re not joking—Hermione, the brat is—!” The Beta suddenly shrieks when a spider drops on her head, and Hermione turns to see Astoria hiding behind a mortified Draco. Hermione reaches over to the screaming Beta Tracey, smacking the arachnid off. It turns into mouse by the time it hits the floor.</p><p>Tilting her head at Astoria, an eyebrow raised, she only receives an innocent expression. After a beat, the young Alpha ducks her head.</p><hr/><p> </p><p>September nineteenth finally comes around, and Hermione turns thirteen. When she wakes up, all her dormmates are awake before she is, Err’sh as well. She looks pointed at him, and he rolls his wings in a shrug.</p><p>“Happy birthday Hermione!” They cheer. The whole Slytherin House seems to know her birthday, and Hermione wonders how any of them found out. Even students from the other Houses say happy birthday, although most follow it up with, “How old are you now?”, to which she doesn’t answer. She rather likes how everyone thinks she’s older.</p><hr/><p> </p><p>The first week passes, and Hermione’s resting with her post-first-week-angst going away. Not even a few hours later, loud whispering wakes her.</p><p>“What do you—oh it’s you. What do you want?” Pansy hisses at someone outside their dorm. Hermione hears the strong response from a First year.</p><p>“Flint wants Hermione for Quidditch.” Astoria whispers, a little wary of Pansy.</p><p>“Like hell, now scat.” Hermione hears a stamp.</p><p>“No! Flint needs Hermione—”</p><p>“Like hell, she’s a Reserve Seeker!” Pansy cuts in.</p><p>“Well, he needs her down at the pitch for practice! Now!” Astoria whispers louder, annoyance tinging her words.</p><p>“Shut up and bugger off! Just because she tolerates you doesn’t mean you can pull shit like this!” Pansy growls, pissed off, as she shuts the door on the First year’s face. Hermione groans into her pillow. Damn Marcus. Pansy approaches Hermione’s bed, shuddering.</p><p>“What the bloody hell are you doing?!” Millicent gasps, probably haven woken up as well. Hermione sits up, holding a hand up to Pansy.</p><p>“The whole dorm heard all of it, you weren’t quiet.”</p><hr/><p> </p><p>Hermione is the first Slytherin to get her things together, walking down to the pitch with yawning boys behind her. She leaves Err’sh in the stands. Today is Draco, Vincent, and Gregory’s first practice. The Beta’s playing as Beaters. After the boys admire their new brooms, specially painted in Slytherin colors, they zip around the pitch.</p><p>Flying high with a simple touch, she waits with Marcus. The Alpha gets the others on drills, and motions Draco and her to fly closer to him.</p><p>“You two are going to be training together, got it?” They nod.</p><p>“This way if something happens to you Draco, Hermione can fill in, now go teach him some moves,” He orders, and Hermione ignores the twitch in her eye at his order. But she obeys. They fly off to the side, Hermione trying to get Draco to trust his grip on his broom by having him barrel roll. The sky is still dark, not even dawn, which adds to Draco’s nervousness.</p><p>Suddenly Hermione spots another team clad in scarlet robes walking onto the pitch.</p><p>“Oi Marcus!” Draco calls, pointing. The Alpha Captain snarls, signaling for the team to land. They do, right in front of the Gryffindors.</p><p>“Off the pitch, Wood,” Marcus sneers, and Oliver draws himself up. Hermione sighs, tuning out the impending shouting match. Instead she traces the wood grains of her broom. Then Marcus reveals Draco as the new Seeker, and he and Harry have a glare off. Oliver growls, as Marcus pulls out Professor Snape’s approval slip. There’s nothing Oliver can do about that.</p><p>Hermione tilts her head, turning to the odd sound in the stands. It’s Colin with his camera. Draco sneers in him, then turns the Weasley twins.</p><p>“It’s no wonder you’re so dirt poor. You probably <em>want</em> Click-Clack to boast what’s left of your house, catering to filthy Mudbloods just like your oaf of a father.” Draco drawls. There’s a startled gasp from the Gryffindors. Hermione instantly dons a neutral face, and the twins roar.</p><p>Harry’s face is furious, and he lunges forwards, punching Draco in the face. Harry suddenly seizes, falling to the ground and holding his stomach. Draco stumbles away, holding his bloody nose.</p><p>≠ “<em>How dare you!</em>” ≠ Alicia screams.</p><p>“What did you do to Harry?!” Oliver yells, tackling Marcus. The Weasley twins surge forwards, roaring in rage towards Draco. Hermione grabs Draco’s robes collar, dragging him away as Vincent and Gregory block the twin’s path. Snarling at Draco, he cowers away from her. She’s just had <em>enough</em> with his supremest views.</p><p> </p><p>                                                                                                 <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>     — . —</p><p><em>Peskipiksi Pesternomi</em> = “Pixie Detox” Charm</p><p><em>Silencio!</em> = Silencing Charm</p><p><em>Immobulus!</em> = Freezing Charm</p>
