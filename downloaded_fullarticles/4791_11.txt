    <p>Draco didn’t scream when it happened; he stood quietly, then gave a little sigh into the Dementor’s mouth. Harry screamed, pain ripping through him as Draco dropped into a heap on the stone floor.</p>
<p>Kingsley offered Harry a job: they needed Aurors. Harry shook off the paternal hand on his shoulder, skin crawling.</p>
<p>Harry’d promised Draco, before the trial. “I’ll take care of you.” His influence hadn’t been enough to save him. But he could brush his hair and wash him and make sure Draco was warm and fed.</p>
<p>Draco wasn’t in pain. He watched with empty eyes while Harry cried.</p>
