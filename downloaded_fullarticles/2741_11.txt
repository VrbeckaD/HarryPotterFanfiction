    <p align="center">My Prick Fancies <u>YOU</u> SNAPE!</p><p align="center"> </p><p>MY name is Harry Potter. I’m 16 years old and –</p><p>
  <em>My prick fancies Snape.</em>
</p><p>Hermione says writing would take some pain away from my current predicament. Its not like I don't have plenty of other things to worry about, like a vicious Dark Lord wasn’t after me. Malfoy acting suspicious, hell SNAPe too, both acting suspicious together--- well that is another story…</p><p>Anyway, What should I do? Usually well,---- let’s start from the beginning. oR let’s say the beginning I suspect off as the beginning, the most likely beginning, its not 100% but most likely, eh…</p><p>Let’s start again. I'm Harry Potter and<strike> I fancy Snape </strike>!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO Scratch that!!!!!!!!!</p><p> </p><p>My blasted prick fancies SNAPe!!!!!!!!!!OKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK!!!???</p><p> </p><p>Ah that's better. Let's make one thing perfectly clear, MY PRICK FANCIES SNAPE!!!!! I DO NOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p><p> </p><p>AND IT TALKS!</p><p> </p><p>"Hey shorty." MY prick, not only talks but calls me SHORTY! The nerve...</p><p>My prick gives me  a wink/more like a nudge that translates into a wink/ Thankfully it does not have eyes or----well it's normal, except--- it can talk to me/ thankfully only to me ,but yeh where was I, yes right, the beggining.--</p><p> </p><p>###</p><p> </p><p>There was some fight going on in the corridor about whatever... the usual suspects, G&amp; S-</p><p>Ron, like the dumbass he is joined in, so I had to join in too, during the short fight I felt like something hit me but I was alright after...  my first mistake was not going to the infirmary. I shrugged it off, big mistake next thing I Know....</p><p>I was in my DEFense class, of course Snape was there I mean, he is the prof, duh-</p><p> </p><p>when I heard...</p><p> </p><p>"Hey sexy ..."</p><p> </p><p>"What?" I turned thinking who was the bloody wanker, it was said fairy bloody loudly in a class with Snape! I meant he would go ballistic...</p><p> </p><p>"What is Mr. Potter something you want to share with the class?" sneered Snape, coming right at me, still so greasy and sleazy even when not teaching potions,....UGH....</p><p> </p><p>'SO UGLY' I THOUGHT -----"SO SEXY" I heard, from somewhere close by.... I didn't recognize the voice but shit would Snape think I said that???????!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I had a mini panic attack--</p><p> </p><p>"Eh, ahhh, sorry" Shit I heard that RIGHTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT???</p><p> </p><p>"What are you sorry for? Not concentrating on the class like you are supposed to?" mocked Snape. HE didn't hear? OR????</p><p> </p><p>I just nodded dumbly, better to be accused of THAT, rather That calling him, UGH; sexy.  It made me want to throw up. DISGUSTING! IS THERE SOMEONE who FANCIES SNAPE; WHAT THE FUCK???? Some people have no taste... Or is it a prank...</p><p>"10 points from Gryffindor, Mr. Potter. Focus on the task I gave you. You do know what you should be doing?"</p><p>"Yes sir" I said hurriedly trying to cast the spell anything to seem busy. With a sneer he went away checking on some other <strike>students</strike> targets.</p><p> </p><p>"NO SEXY COME BACK!"</p><p> </p><p>I yelped indignantly, shocked through my bones. Feeling my soul shrivel in outrage.  IT WAS BLOODY LOUDER THAN BEFORE! Like someone shouting in my bloody ear!!!! I'm DOOMED!</p><p> </p><p>Snape like the snake he was slithered back at lightning speed, like..... his sharp eyes zeroed on a snitch to catch or more likely a Gryffindor to humiliate. Interesting how he moved at warp speed when there were points to be taken away.</p><p> </p><p>"Mr. Potter is there a problem?"</p><p> </p><p>'Someone shouting sexy stuff' I thought dejectedly. Can I have no PEACE?  but no one said anything and everyone was staring at me like i was the bloody culprit. That was the last strove.</p><p> </p><p>"IT wasn't me!" I said desperately.</p><p> </p><p>"It' wasn't you, Mr. Potter?"</p><p> </p><p>"No it wasn't, I swear I would never say that!" SHIT WILL HE BELIEVE ME??? SHit its SNAPE FAT CHANCE,...</p><p> </p><p>"What was said that you would never say? hmmm lets hear it Mr Potter."</p><p> </p><p>"Ahem I"</p><p> </p><p>"NoW, Mr Potter what was said"</p><p> </p><p>"But you heard it everyone did , I won't repeat it!!!!" Was he playing dumb???</p><p> </p><p>"What will you not repeat? Don't play coy, Mr. Potter. What was said?"</p><p> </p><p>"I didn't say it!!! I would never I would rather cut off my tongue than say it! I swear"</p><p> </p><p>"I didn' ask for that you simpleton I asked WHAT WAS SAID?"</p><p> </p><p>"Let some of your Slytherins say it I won't!!!!"</p><p> </p><p>Snape glared ferociously at me, "another 10 points from Gryffindor, If you won't repeat what was said this instant, <u>another 10 will be deducted</u> <u>plus a whole week of detention, you hear me?"<br/> </u></p><p> </p><p>"You can't!"</p><p> </p><p>"I MOst certainly can and will. Now. Mr. Potter. "</p><p> </p><p>Ron and Mione just looked incredulous they were eyeing me like i had grown another head. But I was stubborn, Hermione nudged me and whispered: "Just say it Harry!!!!!"</p><p> </p><p>I thought a whole week of detention didn't sound so bad, but then I looked at Malfroy, he was positively glowing. DAMN IT! IT WAS MALFROY's ploy to take me out so that i won't be looking into his suspicious behavior and Snape was helping him!!!!!</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>I gathered my courage and said "If I say it, you won't be giving me detention? I wanted it to be  Confirmed. "I don't want to say it but if you force me I suppose  I will. But I don't want you to give me a detention just because I was forced to say it-"</p><p> </p><p>"Is that a treat, Mr. Potter?"</p><p> </p><p>"No its just a fact. So you still want me to say it?"</p><p> </p><p>"Let's hear it, Mr. Potter. And don’t think you can make deals with me!"</p><p> </p><p>"But Dumbledore can" I added furiously at the git.</p><p> </p><p>"Dont think THat Prof. Dumbledore will keep saving you, you little nitwit. Now Potter what was said that got your knickers in a twist, hmm?"</p><p> </p><p>"YES SEXY"</p><p> </p><p>UGHHH, "You heard it!" DAmn the voice again...</p><p> </p><p>"Don’t think you can change the subject! I already told you to repeat what was said. How many times must I repeat myself?"</p><p> </p><p>"Fine someone said I don’t know who, I think someone like Malfroy..." There was a gasp of outrage coming from the snake's side.</p><p> </p><p>"Stop diddling Potter and say it so we may continue,----"</p><p> </p><p>"Fine but it has nothing to do with me, I strongly protest"</p><p> </p><p>Snape rolled his eyes, "Duly noted, Potter don’t evade the question, another 10 points from Gryffindor."<br/> <br/>  <br/> <br/> "Fine, someone said ....said…--wew,…. Said--"<br/> <br/>  <br/> <br/> "What potter do you want another 10"<br/> <br/>  <br/> <br/> <em>"NOSEXYCOMEBACK"</em></p><p><br/> <br/> "What I didn’t hear stop mumbling boy, and answer."<br/> <br/>  <br/> <br/> I looked the bastard in the eye and shouted<br/> <br/>  <br/> <br/> <strong><em>"NO SEXY COME BACK!!!!!"</em></strong></p><p><br/> <br/> It was worth it just for the look on Snape's face. I think he almost fainted. Deadly pale,... suddenly flushed bright red with anger.<br/> His eyes turning almost completely white, he leaned heavily on the table. His knuckles looked like they were firmly on the table, but if you looked closely they were lightly shaking with tremors.  Mouth open, trying to speak, but nothing came out...then...</p><p><br/> <br/> "DID I HEAR YOU CORRECTLY, BOY!! POTTER WHAT DID YOU SAY?????"<br/> <br/>  <br/> <br/> "I SAID THAT SOMEONE SAID, NO SEXY COME BACK!!!!!"<br/> <br/> "That's why I was so shocked, that they would say it to your face!!!! I think they are completely gone off the bender or have a death wish,....I think Malfroy..." I tried to explain.<br/> <br/>  <br/> <br/> "Stop incriminating Malfroy for your own deeds Potter"<br/> <br/>  <br/> <br/> "Its not fucking me"<br/> <br/>  <br/> <br/> "10 points from Gryffindor for language and detention tonight at 7 pm."</p><p><br/> <br/> "But you said"<br/> <br/>  <br/> <br/> "That was for 1 week this is for tonight can you keep up Potter?"</p><p><br/> <br/> He growled menacingly like he wanted to tear into something with his teeth. Preferably me.  SHITE I'M IN TROUBLE!<br/> <br/>  <br/> <br/> "Who did also hear what MR. Potter claims?!"<br/> <br/>  <br/> <br/> Everyone was dead silent. SHITE WHY NO ONE SAYS ANYTHING???<br/> <br/>  <br/> <br/> "Don't tell me that no one else heard??? Has Mr. Potter gone mad or is it a highly inappropriate prank gone wrong, hmmm?" He says like he wishes it was me so he could tear me- chew me apart like yesterday's news.<br/> <br/>  <br/> <br/> "I heard it too," said Ron, "I just didn't want to say it aloud, that would be crazy..."</p><p><br/> <br/> There was a murmur from other Gryffindors. I was relieved-</p><p><br/> <br/> "I see," said Snape than "who was it????"<br/> <br/>  <br/> <br/> "ME ; BABE ME YOU ARE SO SEXY!!!"<br/> <br/>  <br/> <br/> This time I managed to cover my mouth before anything else came out of my mouth.</p><p><br/> <br/> "Well, well, no one? I see, we don't have time for this nonsense but make no mistake I will catch the culprit and make sure that they won't ever forget it. Come to me after class or during my office hours, for any information on this matter. You will be rewarded, the one responsible will pay dearly. I Am not someone to be trifled with! Understand?</p><p><br/> <br/> " Yes, Professor!" all class said in unison.<br/> <br/>  <br/> <br/> "I like it Rough, so damn sexy"<br/> <br/>  <br/> <br/> I heard THE VOICE AGAIN and almost choked on my tongue.<br/> <br/>  <br/> <br/> "BACK to work. And you better work on your tasks or you will join Mr. Potter for detention tonight. OR WORSE-"</p><p><br/> <br/> Shite this detention will be the worse... I Can tell.... I wonder if the headmaster could help with this, ....IT WASN'T MY FAULT, for Merlin's sake!!!<br/> <br/> Everyone worked diligently, even the snakes were perturbed. Snape's mood rivaled a pissed of snake-demon, demanding blood for retribution, the git was a shite the entire duration of the class.<br/> <br/>  <br/> <br/> Sadly I could still hear someone whispering<br/> <br/>  <br/> <br/> "Oh, sexy so sexy. Talk dirty to me baby."<br/> <br/>  <br/> <br/> This time I wasn't falling for it! I kept my mouth shut and worked until the end.</p><p> </p><p>###</p><p> </p><p>Shit thank Merlin that class was over. It was the longest class of my life----<br/> <br/>  <br/> <br/> THis is it, for now, even writing this completely exhausted me. Shit, I can't believe Mione thought this was cathartic or something. It s freaking more like relieving a nightmare.<br/> <br/> Maybe I will write more, or just focus on a solution for this mess and stop wasting my time writing this. At least Mione said I could burn the parchment after I finished. For cleansing or something- Hell yeah, I don't want anyone finding about this shite!!!!!</p><p> </p><p>My Dear Prick, THE WAR IS ON!!!</p>
