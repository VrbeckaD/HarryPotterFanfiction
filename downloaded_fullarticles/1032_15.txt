    <strong>Better Late Than Never</strong>

</p>
<p>Harry sat down next to Hermione by the firepit outside their tent. She held her hands out to it to warm them up. "It's getting colder," Harry said.</p>
<p>     Hermione nodded. "I know," she said. "We're not going to be able to stay out here like this much longer."</p>
<p>     Harry nodded his agreement. "It's not like we have a lot of options," he added. "I mean, it's camping out here or it's… worse."</p>
<p>     "It is nice out here, isn't it?" Hermione asked. She sighed and rest her head on Harry's shoulder. He felt his heart start beating faster and his stomach tie itself up in knots. "Do you ever think about just throwing in the towel and staying here forever?" she asked. "Grow old?"</p>
<p>     Harry sighed. "At this point, I'm almost positive that the only way I'm going to grow old <em>is</em> by throwing in the towel and staying here. But I also don't think that You Know Who will stop looking for me. The prophecy and all…."</p>
<p>     Hermione sighed. "Yeah, that part makes it difficult," she agreed. "I just wish Dumbledore could have given you something more to go off of. Maybe then Ron wouldn't have… left."</p>
<p>     "Or he still might have. I mean, he is the one who thought we'd all be home by Christmas. And I told you both not to come with me. I said that I would do it all on my own."</p>
<p>     "I know that, Harry, but…"</p>
<p>     Harry chuckled. "I know I'm not smart enough to do this on my own," he said. "Doesn't mean that I wasn't willing to try."</p>
<p>     "It's not that you're not smart enough, Harry. You are. You just don't think about the little things. You're so focused on the bigger picture that the details of it get lost. And you don't ever apply yourself. I honestly can't understand why you didn't devour your school books before ever stepping foot in King's Cross for the first time. When they told me I was a Witch… I couldn't get enough."</p>
<p>     "And that's why I bet the Sorting Hat wanted to put you into Ravenclaw."</p>
<p>     "How did you know that?" Hermione asked, looking at Harry. "I've never told anyone that."</p>
<p>     Harry smirked. "Hermione, you're literally the brightest witch of our age," he said. "It doesn't take much to figure out that you're the smartest Gryffindor probably ever. Or at least since my mother and Lupin were at school. I'll bet the only reason the Sorting Hat <em>didn't</em> put you in Ravenclaw is that you value bravery over intelligence."</p>
<p>     Hermione pulled away from him and stared at her best friend. "And how did you know <em>that?</em>" she asked.</p>
<p>     Harry laughed. "You don't remember?" he asked. "First year in the potion room. You told me that bravery was far more important than books or cleverness. <em>That's</em> why you're a Gryffindor. You're smart as hell, Hermione, but you're also going to jump off that bridge if what's at the bottom is worth the risk and you'll be the first one to do it."</p>
<p>     Hermione smiled. "True," she agreed. She sighed and looked back at the fire. "Now if only I could be smart enough to figure out what Dumbledore didn't tell you…."</p><hr/>

  <span>Three Years Later</span>
</p>
<p>Harry looked at the glass of Firewhisky in his hand and sighed as he set it down on the table in front of him. He rubbed his scar. It hadn't hurt in years. Everything had been quiet since Voldemort died. He hadn't needed to worry about anything in a long time, aside from dodging reporters or other people clamoring for a chance to meet the Boy Who Lived. Most days, Harry dreaded leaving his house. He didn't want to live like this anymore. He wanted to find somewhere out in the middle of nowhere and build a life for himself.</p>
<p>     He picked up the pen next to him and put the tip to the parchment next to his glass. He was drunk enough that the liquid courage made the words come easy.</p>
<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em>Hermione,</em><br/>
<em>Remember when you said we should stay in the forest and grow old? Well, I never told you how perfect that sounded. Better late than never, right?<br/>
</em>
    <em>Love,<br/>
</em>
    <em>Harry</em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p>     Harry stared at the paper for a moment before he tapped it with his wand. The letter disappeared and he wondered how much she would hate him for his admission. She was supposed to get married next week. Harry was supposed to be Ron's best man. The closer it got to their nuptials, the more Harry couldn't stand the thought of standing aside while his best friend got the woman of both their dreams.</p>
<p>     Sure, he had Ginny waiting for him the moment he said something, but he didn't want to. He didn't want <em>her</em>. She reminded him of too many horrors. The Chamber of Secrets. The Horcruxes. His dead mother. He loved her, but it wasn't romantic love. He had wanted it to be, years ago when he respected that Ron wanted to be with Hermione.</p>
<p>     But Ron paraded Hermione around like a trophy. He showed her off every chance he had. He put her on the spot far too often. Harry could see how uncomfortable it made her. He knew she hated the attention. He knew that every time Ron was dismissive about what Hermione did in the war that he didn't value her as a far as Harry could see, Ron only cared about one thing: Proving that he was better than Harry in the end.</p>
<p>     Harry picked up his glass and brought it to his mouth. He tipped his head back, pouring the last of the whiskey down his throat. He winced as it burned its way down and wondered how Hermione would react to his letter.</p>
<p align="center">*     *     *</p>
<p>Hermione looked at herself in the mirror. Her wedding dress was everything she wanted it to be. It was short enough that she didn't have to worry about tripping over it, yet long enough to be elegant. She didn't bother with a train. The dress wasn't too over the top or fancy. It was simple. Elegant. Everything she wanted.</p>
<p>     Yet she couldn't bring herself to love it. She had put it on to try to get excited about her wedding, but she felt the same apprehension now that she had ten minutes ago. As much as she didn't want to admit it, she was starting to wonder if it was more than just cold feet. She shook her head and unzipped her dress. Once it was hanging once more in her closet, she turned back to her bed and sat down. Next to her, on the nightstand, a letter appeared. Hermione reached for it, not knowing who it was from until she opened it and saw Harry's handwriting.</p>
<p>     She read the letter to herself, her eyes widening with the implication of Harry's words. She gasped as she finished it. Tears welled up in her eyes. "Crookshanks!" Hermione said, turning around to her orange cat sprawled on her bed. He looked up at her and let out a distinct meow. "Harry loves me," she told the cat. "What should I do?"</p>
<p>     Crookshanks meowed again.</p>
<p>     Hermione sighed. "You're no help," she said. She laid back on her bed and stared up at the ceiling. She smiled at the thought that Harry Potter could possibly be in love with her. Instantly, her wedding came to mind, making her frown again. She held her hand up over her face and stared at the engagement ring on her finger. Ron had saved up for a year to buy it for her. His proposal, on the other hand, was far less romantic. He'd tossed the box at her and said simply, "'Bout time for that, don't you think?"</p>
<p>     Leaving everything behind and living in the forest with Harry sounded like a much better plan. Hermione sat up and looked at Crookshanks. "Harry or Ron?" she asked.</p>
<p>     Crookshanks meowed at her again.</p>
<p>     Hermione smiled and held up her right hand. "Harry," she said. She held up her left hand. "Or Ron?"</p>
<p>     Crookshanks, the intelligent animal he was, stood up and nuzzled Hermione's right hand and meowed once more.</p>
<p>     Hermione smiled and kissed the animal before she stood up. She grabbed some parchment and a pen and sat down at her desk.</p>
<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em>Ron,</em><br/>
<em>I'm sorry. I can't do this. I don't love you the way you want me to and I'm not willing to put myself through the horrors of a loveless marriage. I will not be your trophy any longer. Please know that I hold you in the highest regard as a friend, but I am not willing to remain your fiancé, girlfriend, or your wife.<br/>
</em>
    <em>Regards,<br/>
</em>
    <em>Hermione</em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p>     She sealed the letter and took off her engagement ring. She rolled up the letter and slipped her ring around it before she charmed it to not accidentally fall off. She then tapped it with her wand and the letter disappeared.</p>
<p>     She then looked at the room she stood in. She grabbed her school trunk and held out her wand. "<em>Pack!</em>" she said, causing her things to fly into her trunk. She then shrunk the truck and cast a lightweight charm on it before putting it in her purse. She picked up Crookshanks. "Let's go get Harry," she said before spun around on her heels and disappeared.</p>
<p>     She reappeared in Harry's kitchen in time to see him toss back a shot of Firewhisky. She put Crookshanks down and sat next to Harry. Startled, he stared at her. "You got my letter," he said.</p>
<p>     Hermione let out a chuckle. "Oh I did," she said.</p>
<p>     Harry stared at her for a moment. "You're not angry," he said.</p>
<p>     Hermione shook her head. "Let's go," she said.</p>
<p>     His eyes widened. "What?"</p>
<p>     Hermione reached out and grabbed the collar of Harry's shirt before she pulled him toward her and kissed him. "You. Me. Forest. Growing old. Let's go."</p>
<p>     Harry grinned before he kissed Hermione again and pulled her onto his lap. "What about Ron?" he asked.</p>
<p>     Hermione shook her head. "I sent him a letter," she said. "I ended things."</p>
<p>     That was the moment they heard Harry's front door open and slam shut. "Harry!" Ron shouted. Hermione moved off of Harry's lap and sat back down on the other chair as Ron entered the room.</p>
<p>     His eyes immediately fell on Hermione. He pointed at her. "Get out of my sight," he snarled at her.</p>
<p>     "Ron, she has every right to be here," Harry said. "And if you want to sit down and calmly discuss things, you're welcome to join us, but if not, then you need to go."</p>
<p>     Ron looked from Harry to Hermione. "All I ever wanted was for you to love me," he said.</p>
<p>     "I know," Hermione replied. "And I'm sorry, but I can't give you what you want. Please respect that."</p>
<p>     Ron's jaw clenched. His hands clenched at his sides. "To hell with both of you," he snapped before he turned around and marched out of the kitchen. A moment later, the door slammed. Hermione looked back at Harry and held out her hand. Harry gave her a smile and took her hand. "Give me a minute to pack what I want to keep," he said before he kissed the back of her hand.</p>
