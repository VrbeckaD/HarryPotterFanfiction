<p>Just the Grey</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>“Godric!” </p>
<p>“What?” Scorpius appeared at the bathroom door. “You okay?”</p>
<p>“No! Look!” James pointed to his head. “It’s terrible!”</p>
<p>Scorpius frowned. “Your hair? It’s looked like that as long as I’ve known you.” </p>
<p>“It’s <i>grey</i>!” James tugged emphatically at a strand. “I’m old!” </p>
<p>Scorpius bit his lip. “James, darling, we’re <i>all</i> getting old.” </p>
<p>James snorted. “Theoretically, although <i>you</i> still look twenty. Haven’t you seen how people look at me when we’re together?”</p>
<p>“Because you’re James Sirius Potter and you’re gorgeous?” </p>
<p>“Because they think I’m robbing the cradle!” </p>
<p>“Rubbish.” </p>
<p>James peered into the mirror. “Merlin! Is that a wrinkle?” </p>
<p>Scorpius sighed. </p>
<p>~</p>
<p>The following day, Scorpius found James rubbing something into his hair. “What in Salazar’s name are you doing?” </p>
<p>James grinned. “Did you know Muggles have magic hair dye that covers just the grey?” </p>
<p>Scorpius raised an eyebrow. “And it works?” </p>
<p>“We’ll see in a minute!” </p>
<p>Scorpius sighed. “You do realise I don’t care if you’ve grey hair, right?” </p>
<p>“I know, but I want to look as young as I can.” James smirked. “If this works, people may think <i>you’re</i> the old one.”</p>
<p>Scorpius snorted. “You’re mad.” </p>
<p>“We’ll see.” </p>
<p>Shaking his head, Scorpius left him, groaning when James screamed minutes later. </p>
<p>~</p>
<p>“It’s all grey!”</p>
<p>Scorpius tilted his head. “Yep.” </p>
<p>“Why?!” </p>
<p>Scorpius picked up the Muggle hair dye box. “This says it covers only the grey hairs, restoring them to their original colour.” He snorted. “Clearly they lied.” </p>
<p>“Fuck! I look even older now!” </p>
<p>Scorpius sighed. “It’s Muggle and you’re a wizard and their stuff doesn’t always work on us. Why did you buy a Muggle product anyway?” </p>
<p>“I didn’t want anyone in the magical world knowing I’m old enough to go grey!” </p>
<p>Scorpius bit his lip. “Well, if it’s any comfort, at least you look…distinguished?”</p>
<p>James’ hex <i>almost</i> hit him.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>“Is it safe?” Scorpius whispered, hovering at the bedroom door.</p>
<p>James, lying flat on the bed, his arm across his face, sighed. “Yeah.” </p>
<p>Scorpius disrobed, sliding into bed. “I’m sorry I laughed earlier.” </p>
<p>“It’s fine.” James shifted, looking at him. “I deserved it.” </p>
<p>Scorpius leaned in, kissing him. “Have you tried charming your hair back to its regular colour?” </p>
<p>James nodded. “Yes. As you see, it didn’t work. I’m stuck looking like this until it grows out.” </p>
<p>“Well,” murmured Scorpius, “it could be a good thing.” </p>
<p>“How?” </p>
<p>Scorpius grinned. “Now I know how you’ll look when you really <i>are</i> old.” </p>
