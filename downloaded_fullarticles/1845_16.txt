    <p>There was something different in the atmosphere.</p><p>That was, perhaps, the first thing he noticed when he walked into the bar that night, but James couldn’t quite put his finger on whatever this difference was. What <em>exactly </em>was that made the air feel so different from all the other times he entered?</p><p>The ambiance was about the same— same chatter from the usual people, same sort of soft lounge music, same sort of just about <em>everything </em>really— but he <em>knew </em>that if he spotted whatever it was that was so amiss about the situation, he’d notice it immediately.</p><p>He’d <em>have </em>to notice it.</p><p>Perhaps it was the lack of alcohol in his system that was making him feel that way. Maybe if he downed a glass or ten or it, he would be able to shake off the feeling that seemed to plague him. Alcohol <em>always</em> seemed to make things about a million times better.</p><p>Still though, he couldn’t shake off the feeling that something drastic truly<em> was</em> about to unfold that night, but maybe it was the magical side of him that was being superstitious. With the dozens of Order missions that he’d been sent on these past few years, he’d learned to be cautious, to always have his eyes and ears open for any sort of signal that foresaw impending doom coming his way.</p><p>But at a <em>bar?</em></p><p>He wanted to separate the drinks and the dark magic, separate the potions and the liquor, separate <em>anything</em> that kept him from living an ordinary life, even if it was just for the night.</p><p>He nearly <em>was</em> about to sit himself down at the front, order the usual, and wait for the night to take its course, but with something so <em>off </em>about the atmosphere, he instead took to ordering a drink before heading off to investigate some more. He intended on getting so sloshed that the bartender would have no choice but to summon Remus, his more sensible friend, but now, it seemed, finding the answer to this one question seemed far more important.</p><p>James took one quick glance around the room.</p><p>There were the same old wizards laughing over perhaps some same story that they’d recounted far more times than anyone cared to admit, a story that had probably been the highlight of their entire teenage years. At the table beside them were a group of friends, who seemed to have been the generic-brand version of James and his own friends— the Marauders, as they’d liked to call themselves in their Hogwarts years. James didn’t even <em>want </em>to mention the fact that there were far too many couples getting much too handsy than they should have in a public outing, yet there they were, going at it as if it was their last night together, and—</p><p>His eyes caught onto a sliver of red.</p><p>It was there for one second and then disappeared into thin air, like someone had taken to casting magic in the rowdy bar, a simple little trick to entertain his eyes. Upon processing the thought, though, he realised that it wasn’t magic.</p><p>It <em>couldn’t </em>be magic.</p><p>His doubts were soon resurrected, though, and his legs started moving on their own accord, like they were under the pull of a wand. Perhaps it <em>could </em>have been the lure of some spell, because there was no way that he could have followed some sliver of red <em>just </em>like that, not unless the caster held inconceivable power within them.</p><p>After much aimless walking, he caught sight of the red once again, but it wasn’t just a sliver. It was an entire <em>head </em>of hair.</p><p>Only <em>one </em>person had hair that red. One person who he remembered from years long ago, back when he was still running through the corridors of Hogwarts without so much as a care in the world.</p><p>He should catch up with her, ask about how she was doing in life.</p><p>The question remained though: how was he going to approach someone who he hadn’t made contact with in years without coming off as a creep? How to play it cool, like he <em>hadn’t </em>spent his last few school years having an achingly painful crush on her?</p><p><em>Let it flow, </em>he told himself. Flow. Smooth. Suave. <em>Exactly </em>what he was the epitome of.</p><p>If they were going to meet once again, he wasn’t going to force it to happen. A simple little <em>hello </em>should do it, and then they’d have a lovely little chat before they were to part by the end of the night, as all chance encounters went.</p><p>He had this in the bag.</p><p>Flow. Smooth. Suave. <em>Exactly </em>what he was the epitome—</p><p>He felt himself run <em>right</em> into her. Quite literally as well, because when he thought he’d formed a clear, concise plan, the universe had decided to add a twist to it, one that made it so that he would collide into her, the one person he thought he wouldn’t see again in a million years.</p><p>Life seemed as if it was moving in slow motion, but the events flashing before his eyes were doing the exact opposite— too quick for him to fully process— because she suddenly met his eyes, and he was struck with the brightest of greens he had ever seen in his life.</p><p>
  <em>Eyes. Green.</em>
</p><p>Green, green,<em> green.</em></p><p>He felt as if someone decided to use an Unforgivable on him. One where his very thoughts were being controlled, because <em>all </em>he could think about were how bloody <em>green </em>her eyes were. Like there was no other lovely aspect of hers that he could focus on. It didn’t help that he had nearly forgotten, after all of these years, just how <em>breathtaking </em>she was, just how easily she could light up a room, just how <em>wet </em>her shirt was from his drink spilling all over her, and—</p><p>
  <em>Shit.</em>
</p><p>He’d spilled his <em>drink </em>on her.</p><p>That, in all honesty, was <em>not </em>how he expected their meeting to start.</p><p><em>Way </em>to go, him.</p><p>“Oh!” She took a step back, looking at the mess he managed to make of their meeting and plucking at her shirt in an effort to keep the wet fabric away from her skin. Raising her distracting eyes back to him, she started, “Sorry, I didn’t see you and—”</p><p>Time slowed down again when their eyes met. She almost made a double take, and the sentence died before she could finish it.</p><p>“Oh,” she repeated. Her hands stilled by her side. “I haven’t seen— I mean... Hello.”</p><p>“Fucking— I didn’t mean to get you all wet,” he said, feeling himself flailing about like a chicken without a head. “Not in <em>that </em>context, at least.”</p><p>“Right. Of course not.” She laughed, but it was quiet and definitely forced. Her fingers moved by her side like she couldn’t decide what to do with them before choosing to push some of her hair from her face. “Lily Evans, by the way. I don’t know if you remember, but we, um…”</p><p>“Yeah, no. I think it’s a bit hard to forget when we’ve snogged in the past, yeah?”</p><p>Her shoulders relaxed - just enough for him to notice - and her giggle was more like the sound he <em>liked </em>to hear when running into a pretty girl at a bar. “Yeah, that part’s a bit hard to forget.” She hesitated, but, in spite of the new blush on her cheeks, whatever she was deciding won, and she continued before he could interrupt. “My friend had to run off to see her boyfriend, but I don’t know if I’m quite ready to go home. Maybe we could… catch up? You could buy me a drink to make up for the ruined shirt?”</p><p>He was, unsurprisingly, taken aback by her words, and he shrugged. “I could just give you <em>my </em>shirt. Right here and now.”</p><p>“They might kick us out for that,” she answered, though the color on her cheeks and smile didn't fade from her face.</p><p>“It’s not <em>that </em>much different than those couples snogging their faces off in the corner over there,” he replied, pointing back at a table in a more dimly-lit area of the bar.</p><p>She didn't look where he gestured, continuing to meet his gaze like it was a challenge. “Do you have plans like that you'd like to return to, Potter?”</p><p>“Nah, but I reckon I’ve got some plans that I could <em>start</em> right about now,” he said back, and, without so much as looking around, he motioned towards an empty table. “Fancy another drink? All on me, obviously.”</p><p>The corner of her mouth quirked up in the beginning of a smile. “I would,” she answered, plucking at the damp shirt again. “Since we already had one on me.”</p><p>He felt the corners of his lips curving upwards unceremoniously. “I’ll see if I can get something to clean that up, since apparently it’s criminal to lend you my shirt.”</p><p>“We'll figure it out.”</p><p>He nodded. “You should sit down. I’ll get the drinks.”</p><p>After her nod of confirmation, he turned to the bar and ordered. With two drinks in hand, he found her in the crowd again, alone at a small table with a cardigan thrown hastily over her shoulders. She tapped her nails against the tabletop while she waited but stopped when she noticed him looking for her, sitting up and visibly straightening.</p><p>He grinned at her, placing the drinks down with a soft <em>clink </em>and plucking some napkins from the center of the table, handing them to her. “All right, Evans? Napkins won’t dry it all up, but they’ll do something.”</p><p>“Not bad,” she answered, taking the napkins from him with a noticeable shock where their fingers brushed. She dabbed at the places where her shirt clung to her skin. Even with her sweater thrown over for cover, he could still make out <em>certain </em>parts of her. “Not exactly according to plan, but I found a cute boy to buy me a drink, so,” she looked up, “no complaints.”</p><p>“Yeah?” he said, unable to help the grin on his face while he looked around the room curiously. “Where is he now?”</p><p>“Must have run off.” She took a drink and set the glass back on the table, her fingers wrapped around the rim. “Boys are so flighty, you know? I was thinking you could keep me company in his place.”</p><p>“Only if it’s not <em>too </em>troubling for you. Let me know if I’m not staying up to par with your expectations, yeah? I know it takes a lot to meet your standards.” Feeling bold, which in all honesty was <em>not </em>anything new, he loosened her grip on her glass and picked it up, making a great deal of effort in drinking from her own drink. He wasn’t sure if the tingling sensation that ran through him was from the alcohol or from her touch, but he decided that it didn’t matter.</p><p>She hid what he assumed was a grin behind her other hand, letting her fingers linger by his. “What brings Gryffindor’s own James Potter to a bar like this and a table like mine?”</p><p>“Pretty redheads, apparently.”</p><p>“Charming, as always, Potter. That hasn’t changed.”</p><p><em>“Gorgeous </em>as always, Evans,” he shot back, and he leaned in close to her. “What’s your secret? Sold your soul to a dark wizard for eternal beauty, have you?”</p><p>“If I have to start the sale at age twenty, I guess that doesn’t bode well for my future.”</p><p>“Future can’t be <em>that </em>bad if you’re gorgeous forever,” he said, waving it off. He took another swig from her glass before sliding it back towards her. “What’s in store for your future, then, if not selling your soul? Finding the cure for dragon pox? Wouldn’t put it against you if you’ve already done it.”</p><p>“Nothing like that,” she said quickly, taking the drink from him and a swig of her own. “Haven’t you heard? No one wants to hire muggleborns.” Her expression soured momentarily, but she quickly replaced it with a smile he recognized, the kind she used when someone said something distasteful and she was coming up with the best response. “What about your future? I haven’t heard about you in the European Quidditch League, so you could be doing anything.”</p><p>“The world is really bloody stupid to be hiring a thick-headed Pureblood rather than the genius who is Lily Evans.” They established a pattern of sip and slide, but when her glass went empty, he reached for his own, which had been neglected since they sat down. “Gave up on Quidditch since I left Hogwarts. There’s so much more that I could be doing with my life, and I’d have to be the biggest, most selfish prick to be playing instead of fighting for the lives of other people.”</p><p>Her small, teasing smile was back, thankfully replacing the previous grimace. “Or distracting us from the worst of it with your death-defying scores.” She reached across the table to slip her fingers over his, explicitly to take his drink for herself, but it couldn’t be just his imagination that made her fingers fit perfectly with his for a few seconds. “But you always were more of the hero type. Saving the world is your style.”</p><p>He felt a bit dazed. It <em>had </em>to be the alcohol in his system and definitely <em>not </em>from the redhead sitting across from him. “Yeah?” he asked softly, “Then do I get the girl after saving the world? Obviously she’s independent and isn’t just there as an accessory, but that’s always more of an incentive for me if she’s waiting for me.”</p><p>Pointedly, she took another long drink, pushing the half-empty glass back toward him when she was done. “Who says you have to save the world first?”</p><p><em>“I </em>say so,” he said, slightly in awe of her. “Don’t want to throw the world away for something that could be rekindled later, even if it involves someone who could practically <em>be </em>my world.”</p><p>“Maybe <em>the </em>girl comes after you save the world,” she allowed, tracing the ring his drink left on her side of the table. “I was thinking more like...” Lily twisted a finger in her hair, twirling the end. “A distraction. A short break from all the world-saving.”</p><p>Oh.</p><p>
  <em>Oh.</em>
</p><p>He immediately understood her implication, the one that confirmed that the words and gestures that she had been sending him were most <em>definitely</em> what he’d suspected.</p><p>Order mission after Order mission, he’d found no breaks in between, no way to let off steam except through alcohol, but even <em>that </em>wasn’t enough. To run into her, a crush of the past, was enough to burst the cage of feelings that he’d locked away for years, enough to make his mind conjure up new ways to find a release.</p><p>He wanted it. He <em>so </em>wanted it.</p><p>He was quickly taken back to the times that it was just the two of them, alone like they were now, inside of the Prefect Compartment on the train to Hogwarts, inside a crowded broom closet with nothing but the others’ bodies to explore.</p><p>He’d be <em>lying </em>if he said that he didn’t imagine those events happening again, events where he ran his fingers over her exposed skin, where he felt his lips pulled over hers in a fit of momentary passion. It was more than enough to make him want more, right here, right now, and when she expressed that she was more than willing… Well, a bloke couldn’t find it in himself to turn her away.</p><p>She was sober enough, the only indication that said otherwise being in the red of her cheeks, which was <em>such</em> a stark contrast to the whiteness of her skin. Of course he wanted this break. <em>Of course </em>he did.</p><p>“Do <em>you </em>need a break? Reckon we could sort out a compromise, yeah?”</p><p>She shrugged one shoulder and leaned back in her seat, acting like she hadn’t just twisted his world on its head and made him want to get all the closer to her. That maddening smile— almost a smirk, really— still played at the corners of her mouth. “Reckon we could. Who doesn’t need a break these days?”</p><p>“Voldemort and his cronies, apparently,” he replied, feigning nonchalance. He picked up the glass, holding it out to her. “Want the rest? Got to make sure that every sickle isn’t put to waste before we go.”</p><p>She took it from him, nearly rolling her eyes. “War makes everyone practical.” She downed the last swallow and a half and put the glass back on the table with force, like it was something that she conquered. “Lead the way.”</p><p>He rose from his seat, the legs of the chair squeaking unattractively across the floor, and she followed suit. Without so much as a glance back at the bar, they left.</p><p>Something had been amiss all right, but with his finger now pinpointed on what exactly it had been, he couldn’t will himself to care any less.</p><p>He had <em>other </em>plans for the night.</p>
<hr/><p>Lily didn't know <em>what </em>possessed her, exactly.</p><p>Maybe it was the idea of Mary finding out that she ran into James Potter— the same James Potter who snuck into a few too many of her teenage dreams— at a bar when she was alone and did little more than mumble an apology for <em>actually</em> running into him.</p><p>Even though, really, he should be the one apologizing, since he was the one who dumped a drink over her shirt— the one she <em>specifically</em> picked to make her eyes shine, even in the dim lights of a bar. Women had a tendency to over-apologize, she knew. She’d told herself the same thing a hundred times and <em>still</em> hadn’t managed to break the habit.</p><p>The spark behind his glasses didn’t help matters.</p><p>Maybe it was because she already felt on edge— untethered and unattached to anything, including her own idea of herself. Lily could be anyone she wanted to be for the night. Her friend might have left before the night felt properly over to tend to a sick boyfriend, but Lily only had a half-packed flat waiting for her.</p><p>What was one more drink and maybe— if she was lucky and daring enough— one more night away from the boxes?</p><p>Of course, she didn't really <em>have</em> to admit anything to Mary. She could send her an owl the next day, guilting her for leaving Lily to her own devices in the way of best friends. She could spin a tale of woe and convince Mary to come out with her again before everything changed.</p><p>She didn’t have to tell her friend that she had managed to run into the one boy who tangled up her thoughts. She didn’t have to tell her that he spilled a drink on her and still had those flashing hazel eyes that made any person who liked boys want to lean in and learn more.</p><p>She didn’t have to tell her that her heart still jumped and her skin still pricked, like it did when they were teenagers.</p><p>She didn’t have to tell her <em>anything</em>.</p><p>Mary only left her alone for a few minutes, and such brief loneliness didn’t necessarily mean that she needed another drink. She could be practical and productive— go home, pour a glass of wine, turn the radio on too loud, and finish packing. She could excuse herself from the situation and pretended it never happened. Pretend seeing him again didn’t make her feel like a schoolgirl who could never get what she wanted but wanted to try anyway.</p><p>But in matters of James Potter, she was rarely practical or productive.</p><p>All it took was re-introducing herself, half convinced that he forgot about the little prefect he knew at school, and noticing that small spark of recognition she so desperately hoped to see. One mention of their past, and she started <em>flirting</em>. One mention of their clandestine meetings and her silly two-drink brain wanted to find a way to get back to it.</p><p>Two-drink Lily, she found, was hardly subtle.</p><p>It was a good thing Mary left to pay attention to Reg, because it would have been far too embarrassing if she was still there to judge her every move. It was far too much like it was five years ago where Lily knew every empty classroom and closet between the Great Hall and Gryffindor Common Room.</p><p>Part of her thought Mary would have been enough to stop this grab at a past fling, but another part of her said she was getting particularly good at lying to herself.</p><p>With her fingers intertwined with his and the night air cool on her face, she wasn’t sure she <em>wanted </em>to argue with herself. She had the right to have a good time with a person who clearly wanted her company.</p><p>What was one night?</p><p>As an early fall breeze cut through them, Lily took the excuse to press herself against his side. He hadn’t given her an open invitation to touch him, exactly, but her meaning had to be clear, if it made them leave the bar that quickly without any notice.</p><p>“Where to?”</p><p>His arm flew out to hold her tightly against him, and with one step forward— <em>Destination, Determination, Deliberation— </em>they found themselves inside of his flat.</p><p>“Here.”</p><p>“Great,” she replied, light-headed from the combination of side-along apparation and how his body burned against hers, even through several layers of clothing. Reaching for his other hand, she took a step back and placed herself in front of him, chin tilted up to meet his gaze. One hand inched up his arm, itching to do <em>something </em>to pull him closer. “Could I…?”</p><p><em>“Yes. </em>Merlin, <em>yes.”</em></p><p>That was all the confirmation she needed. In one quick motion, she rose onto her toes, forgetting about every practical thing she could be doing, like taping boxes and selling off furniture. The only real, tangible thought that she could process was the fact that she was going to know what it would be like to kiss him again.</p><p><em>Again. </em>They were going to do it <em>again.</em></p><p>Wrapping one arm around his neck, she pulled him down so they could meet halfway, crashing their lips together in a decent imitation of their messy teenage sessions.</p><p>No, not<em> decent</em>.</p><p>It was <em>more </em>than decent, better than anything they ever shared in their secret meetings, which were always rushed and terrifying at the chance that they might be caught.</p><p>They had no such fears now.</p><p>He tasted like a trace of their shared drinks and fire, burning through her veins and fogging her mind until she couldn’t think about anything but the way his fingers lit up her nerves and his kiss felt like pure energy. She pressed herself closer, desperate to close the space between them and chase the rush of feelings, but he wasn’t going anywhere, didn’t <em>want </em>to go anywhere else.</p><p>It was not enough and too much at the same time. Not enough time for everything and too much space between them for anything.</p><p>“Let’s move this to the bedroom,” he murmured against her lips, and a warm, pleasant feeling shot through her.</p><p>“Yeah,” she sighed easily, drunk on something more powerful than hastily poured drinks from the bar. Her head swam deliciously, and she never wanted it to stop. No excuse to separate was good enough, so she stumbled forward with her arms still around him, hoping he could guide them to the right place without looking.</p><p>Sure enough, he navigated the flat without removing his fingers from her skin or detaching his mouth from hers, as if they were held together by some unknown force. In what could have been an hour or perhaps only a few seconds, she felt the back of her head softly find the surface of the bed and his own weight atop her.</p><p>His lips pulled off of hers, leaving her flushed and breathless, to hover over her and speak. The sight of him above her was more than enough to make her heart jolt, as if he was the one and only Aphroditus, handsome enough to send her insides into an eternal frenzy.</p><p>“You’re gorgeous. You <em>do </em>know that, don’t you?”</p><p>“Convince me,” she whispered, dragging him back down to her.</p><p>He did just that.</p><p>She tried to rid herself of her sweater without breaking contact, but her attempts at shimmying under him only pushed it down her arms and off her shoulders. She knotted a hand in his always-wild hair, using the pillow under her head for leverage. Her shirt still clung to her stomach and chest in sticky-sweet patches, and she longed for something else to take its place— <em>someone </em>else.</p><p>James must have been able to read her mind, or maybe she was just that obvious, because his fingers knew exactly where to go and what to do to make her gasp. To make her want to melt against him so it was impossible to get any closer. To make her forget about anything else and want to give him the same dizzying feeling.</p><p>Warm hands replaced the chill of her ruined shirt and shock of cool air when clothes were pushed aside to reveal skin. Falling back against the pillows, Lily giggled when his lips found her neck and covered her fluttering pulse, but it quickly turned into a series of content sighs.</p><p>It was everything she remembered from those few months of her fifth year, everything that set her heart racing and legs shaking. Everything but <em>better</em>.</p><p>There was no broom digging into her back or constant worry that Filch would hear a strange noise and come knocking. His current shirt had fewer buttons than their uniforms, so she could touch his skin sooner and press a kiss over his rapidly beating heart.</p><p>No reason why they couldn’t take their time, take all night, learn what was just right.</p><p>Two-drink Lily— nearly three-drink Lily, really, if she counted the drinks shared between them— needed to make her decisions far more often, she decided, if they all ended up like this.</p>
