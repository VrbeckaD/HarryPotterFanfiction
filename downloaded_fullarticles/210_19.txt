    <p>1. book date (peter parker)</p><p>  You smiled at the boy who had been anticipating this day since he nervously approached you in the lunch line at school, asking if you wanted to come to an event at the bookstore with him the following weekend. You had to laugh at the boy, Peter Parker, when he’d asked you because there was so much trepidation in his voice and such a worried look about his face that it was like he expected you to lunge forward, topple over him and proceed to attack him like you were a wild dog.</p><p>     The reality was you’d been friends for five years now and so there was no reason for him to be as nervous as he was in asking you to hang out. Of course you usually hung out with him around Ned or MJ but it hadn’t even been a big deal to you that the two of you would be going alone.</p><p>So now you faced him on the day of, him standing in front of you outside of your apartment door. You smiled at him and he smiled too, but you could still see that he was nervous for some reason, and whatever that reason was you weren’t sure. You just stepped aside for him to come in and greeted him,</p><p>     “Hey, Parker. I hope I’m dressed alright.”</p><p>You were wearing denim overalls over a white blouse that had flower and cherry drawings printed over it, and you had secured all of your hair away from your face in a sloppy fashion, chopsticks holding together what (insert your hair type) hair you had. He was dressed like himself, except he had a sort of fancy jacket on, and he smiled wide at you, some of his tension drifting away,</p><p>     “You look great.”</p><p>You grinned,</p><p>     “Thanks, you look good too, Pete. Would you like a cup of tea, some cookies? I just made some cookies and the kettle’s still hot.”</p><p>     Peter accepted, not because he really wanted any but because he was too polite to deny, and you made your way into the kitchen and came back with far more than you had insinuated- jam<br/>
and cookies with tea and strawberries and pieces of mango. Out of your friend group, you were the dainty one- not dainty when it came to voicing your strong opinions or carrying out complex equations, but kind and graceful, always generous and always baking and making creations. You were like the fairy of the group, was what Ned always said.</p><p>     You and Peter sat on your couch sipping tea and eating for a minute while Peter cracked his corny jokes over and over, and yet you found yourself drunk with laughter every time, having to cover your mouth to keep cookie crumbs from falling out. Peter was a nerd but he was Peter nonetheless, and even through all his awkwardness he knew how to make a person feel good about themselves, and feel good in general. That was part of the reason why you had been friends for so long.</p><p>     “You ready?” Peter asked, dusting himself off after he stood up off of your couch.</p><p>     When you had finished eating, he took all the plates and trays into the kitchen and washed them for you so that you wouldn’t have to, not even at your own request. He just did those things autonomously. You thought that was so cute of him, but you kept that to yourself, just showing your gratefulness and beaming up at him all the while.</p><p>     You nodded and suddenly you were off. Peter linked his arm with yours to be funny but you found yourselves walking like that all the way down to the local bookstore where Peter was taking you. It was a small bookstore but inside, it was like a wonderland- for bibliophiles at least, which the two of you were. In fact when Peter had heard about this happening he practically jumped (he did jump) in excitement because he knew you’d be a perfect fit. You didn’t know that he’d been waiting for months for something fun to do with you that you could do alone, on purpose.</p><p>     When you saw the sign and the assortment of books on the rustic shelf outside of the bookstore you stopped in your tracks, and in doing that your arm sunk down out of Peter’s grasp, leaving your hand hanging limply beside Peter’s. When you read the sign outside reading: “blind date with a book day”, you squeezed Peter’s hand. </p><p>     But you didn’t let go, because he didn’t let go, and so you just stood there with your hand laced in-between Peter’s. You didn’t think much of it, and looked over at Peter with an excited grin on your face, fueled by the books around you and the mysteriousness of the entire prospect, but what you didn’t see was how red his cheeks had grown from your hand being fully in his, and didn’t even realize how hot and trembly his hands and fingers had gotten either.</p><p>     You practically dragged him to the shelf outside, one hand laced in his and the other hand running along the books on the shelf that were wrapped in paper wrap, so you couldn’t see the title of the book or anything about it. The books ranged from thick and tall to slender and short, and you couldn’t bear to choose only one, so you and Pete found yourselves grabbing as many as your arms could bear and struggling inside of the bookstore.</p><p>When you got to the front desk you let go of Peter’s hand and his face fell, something you didn’t realize yet again, and you asked if you could get a basket to carry around your books in. The lady behind the desk received the both of you with a warm smile and her eyes traveled between you and Peter. From the flushed look on the both of your youthful faces, she confused it (more like guessed right) with young love, a trope which many of their books contained.</p><p>     “We’d like a cart please!” you exclaimed, your voice louder than you’d meant it to be by virtue of your eagerness for books and for this idea, and because you wanted to get even more books and you didn’t care if you’d have to pay for all of them instead of split the price like you’d chosen initially.</p><p>     “Gotcha,” the lady reached behind her and smiled again at the two of you. “How lovely of you two to spend your date here. I don’t usually see many kids jumping for this opportunity. Your girlfriend is a lucky one,” she said that directly to Peter, whose eyes widened as he started to stammer,</p><p>     “Um- she… we’re not- she’s not m-”</p><p>To shut him up, you squeezed at his hand and just grinned at the lady behind the desk. It worked because he looked down at your hands, glad to see that they were intertwined again, and just smiled up at the lady instead too. He had no idea what that meant from you, because you had stopped him from correcting her, but he was just glad you weren’t embarrassed at the possibility. Now he was more reassured in his trying.</p><p>     “You kids have fun,” the lady handed you the cart after she’d placed all the books inside of it for you.</p><p>     “Thank you!” your cheery voice got crushed by your grunts as you tried to hold the basket with all the books inside of it, which was making it quite heavy. But Peter reached beside you and picked it up easily, with one swoop of his hand, and said,</p><p>     “Here, let me get that for you.”</p><p>Not used to Peter’s sudden strength abilities, you cocked your head over at him curiously before chirping,</p><p>     “Why thank you.”</p><p>     “No problem,” Peter said, and there seemed to be a minute where the two of you were looking at each other in silence for far too long before you dragged Peter along to the back of the store where the fantasy novels were, and leaned against the shelf. Back here the two of you were alone and it was quiet and a little dark, and relaxing.</p><p>     “Um, YN?” Peter questioned, watching your fingers scan along all the fantasy titles as he leaned up against the shelf facing your back.</p><p>     “Mm hm?”</p><p>     “Why’d you, uhm,” Peter laughed nervously and even though you weren’t looking at him you knew him well enough to know that was his nervous laugh. “Why’d you tell that lady that we were um… boy… boyfriend and girlfriend? Like, that was a joke… right?”</p><p>     His voice seemed hinged on some anticipation that there was more to what you said, and you shook your head slowly and over nonchalantly, still not facing him, and said,</p><p>     “Not necessarily…”</p><p>     Peter nearly tripped over what little space there was behind him, and that alone would have knocked down that bookshelf and caused all the other ones behind it to topple in a chain reaction. Instead he choked on his own spit which was even more apparent, honestly, and when you turned around to face him he was trying to hold in his cough, puffing up his cheeks.</p><p>     His eyes were watery from coughing and yet he still had the audacity to try and fold his arms and lean up against the bookshelf to appear unbothered. You chuckled quietly not only at the sight of him being such a nerd as per usual but just because you liked looking at him, and the way you gazed over at him over your lustrous lashes made his breath hitch in his throat.</p><p>     His voice cracked, ruining any chance of smoothness as he replied, after quite some time had passed, though he was looking anywhere but at you,</p><p>     “What do you mean not… not necessarily?”</p><p>You shrugged, once again super nonchalant, making him feel like such an idiot for reacting the way he did,</p><p>     “Well it doesn’t have to be a joke… not if you don’t want it to be.”</p><p>     “Oh.”</p><p>     “You wanted me to be for real, right?”</p><p>     “I… I’m really confused right now, can we-”</p><p>     “Peter,” you said his name, bringing him back to earth, and he bit his lip. You smiled to relax him and to relieve any possible tension. All along you’d known that almost all this time Peter had liked you as more than a friend, and now was the moment of truth. Were your suspicions right? They couldn’t be wrong, you knew him and you knew the signs. But right now you were bracing yourself.</p><p> “Sorry.”</p><p>You turned around completely so you were fully facing him, and the kind smile on your lips only grew as he stood in front of you, waiting for your next move.</p><p>     “’S’okay. Was there something you wanted to tell me?”</p><p>He took in a deep breath and all the words came out like he only had limited time to say them,</p><p>     “IreallyreallylikeyouYN and I’ve been waiting for us to be alone together and I’m not great with words so I didn’t know how to say it before, but I like you as more than a friend and I guess I was scared of rejection and I hope you’re not repulsed by me now?”</p><p>You just giggled in response, shaking your head at him in amusement,</p><p>     “For a straight A student, Parker, you can be really, really stupid.”</p><p>He gulped and his face dropped, thinking that meant you didn’t feel the same way at all. But what you said next made his eyes light up and a smile appear on his lips.</p><p>     “You know what you do next?”</p><p>     “What do I do… next?”</p><p>     “Kiss me, genius.”</p><p>And he did. And the way he kissed you, the both of you blending into those fantasy novels as if you were characters in a wonderland too, was almost as sweet as your voice in his ear later that day, as you unwrapped and read to him all of the books you had bought blindly from the bookstore. And the phrase would leave his mouth over and over again for as long as you were together, whenever you read to him (which had become a recurrent tradition for the two of you): “wow, YN, your voice is really soft. You should read to me every night.” Lucky for you, all those books you’d bought together had a happy ending.</p>
