    <p>The thing that makes Cedric eventually snap isn’t the Daily Prophet article, or anything the other students say, or the laughs that stop when he enters a room. It’s not even the Weasley twins showing off their new badges – crude animated drawings of Cedric swelling and rising from the lake. Nor is it his father’s letter: <em>Son, you’ve beaten Harry Potter himself at Quidditch! You can do better than this</em>.</p><p> </p><p>In the end it’s a second year Hufflepuff who shrugs and says, “Cedric’s too nice and polite no matter what we say about him!”</p><p> </p><p>Cedric resents his perfect prefect reputation.</p>
