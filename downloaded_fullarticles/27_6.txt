    <p>Remus Lupin was not used to clothes that were tailored to him. His personal choice was always a soft sweater and casual smart trousers. He pulled at the ends of the suit jacket as though he could magically make it longer or straighter even though it was made for him and freshly pressed. He was finding problems everywhere although he voiced none of them. His suit felt wrong even though it actually felt perfect. The flower in his lapel was dropping slightly, even though it was fresh, beautiful and fragrant. He was bound to get something wrong. The person at the other side was going to see him, laugh in his face and ran several miles, and all of it would be broadcast on national television and he would be a complete laughing stock. What the hell was he thinking?</p>
<p>"Remus, calm down," Lily Evan's calm and reassuring voice came from behind him as her hands pressed lightly on to his shoulders. "Everything is going to be fine. Unlike real marriage, this doesn't have to be forever, should you want to in a few weeks you never have to see this person again."</p>
<p>Remus was concentrating on his breathing more than he was on Lily's words. It was true, he could just leave but there were all the catch ups, the where are they now. He had been regretting entering himself into this show for months and here he was moments before going ahead with it. It was far too late to back out. And if he were truly honest with himself, he didn't want to. He was tired of waiting to find someone only for it to fall apart, this was surely a way or trying to get himself further. Sure, it might be a nightmare. But what's life without a few risks?</p>
<p>He almost laughed at that thought. Life without risks was comfortable, and it was safe, and it was easier. It was also lonely which was why Remus was here. He was well aware the gorgeous Lily Evans with her long red hair, which was currently plaited in parts and curled in the rest, who was tall and beautiful but more important kind and loving and the best of people, would fall in love someday and things would be different with them. He was not willing to be left behind. To be alone.</p>
<p>“Come here, I’ll sort-”</p>
<p>Lily didn’t manage to get any further because the hotel room door was flung open. A woman would a scrunched face, blonde hair and lipstick far too red for how pale she was came bursting into the room with three or four camera people.</p>
<p>“Rita Skeeter here,” The woman announced, walking sideways so she would edge towards Remus while also ensuring the camera got her best angle. She announced herself to the film as though everyone who was anyone didn’t know her face and screechy voice. “In the room of our Groom to be. Now, it’s only 30 minutes or so under the wedding ceremony.” She spun suddenly and thrust the microphone into Remus’ face. He stared at it, like a rabbit in headlights. Terrified, dazed, awed. “Tell us Mr Lupin, what are your thoughts in these last few minutes as a free and single man?”</p>
<p>Remus continued to stare at the camera, too stunned to speak. He had barely been able to speak to Lily, the person he was closer to than anyone else. This was terrifying.</p>
<p>"I think it would be better if-" Lily tried to cut in, to free Remus from this, but Skeeter cut her off before she got any further.</p>
<p>"Are the nerves beginning to get to your Mr Lupin?" She didn't wait for an answer this time. "Viewers will remember that Remus Lupin signed up for Marriage at First Sight in an attempt to find a connection with something after many failed attempts on his own. The show using an algorithm that takes everything someone is looking for and finds the person who is perfect for them." She turned to Remus again. "Now, tell us, Mr Lupin, what or should we say who are you expected to see how there?"</p>
<p>Remus let out a vague laugh at that, "I think the whole point of this show is that we don't know who's going to be there when we get to the altar," He commented. It didn't sound harsh if anything it sounded shaken and broken.</p>
<p>Seeker's laugh was clipped and clearly unamused. "Of course, but you must have some sort of idea of who you are hoping to see." She turned back to the camera. "Remus here is bisexual and because of this has no idea which of the two genders he will find waiting for him at the altar. Which are you hoping for, Mr Lupin?"</p>
<p>Remus rolled his eyes, annoyance overcoming his nerves. "There are more than two genders and I don't care as long as the person is kind."</p>
<p>"What a lovely sentiment, Mr Lupin, but we know everyone has a preference. Who do you want to take to bed tonight?" Again, she didn't wait for an answer an instead turned back to the camera. "Mr Lupin and his Bride or Groom will be moving to the honeymoon suite on the top floor of this hotel tonight, before jetting off on their choice of honeymoon as early as tomorrow morning."</p>
<p>Lily sighed, moved over to Rita and physically pushed her backwards. "That is enough of that. Remus will be in the chapel when he needs to be until then you can piss right off."</p>
<p>"Language, my dear, this is going on national television." Seeker cooed.</p>
<p>Lily swore again, louder and more fervently and Seeker and the camera crew left with Seeker's high-pitched cackle following them.</p>

<p>Sirius Black was used to wearing clothes tailored to him. Growing up in the 'noble house of Black' he had had tailored clothes almost from the moment he was born. Clothes that were too itchy or too restrictive to allow him to do the things he wanted to be doing. It was hard to climb trees or run away after playing a trick on his little brother when the clothes barely even allowed for enough movement to walk. Still, this was different. The tuxedo he was in now, was tailored in a way that made him understand what it was about bespoke clothing that people loved. The material was light, allowing for the summer sun blazing through the hotel to not cause overheating, it was comfortable, he brushed imaginary fluff off the jacket because he just wanted to keep touching it. He could hardly believe that he was here, that he was minutes away from meeting someone that was supposedly perfect for him.</p>
<p>It had begun as a joke. James and he had both signed up after ironically watching the show for a couple seasons. They thought it would be a lark to go and make fun of that annoying Rita Skeeter and see who they would be partnered up with. James had talked himself out of it. He had realised that he probably shouldn't joke his way into marriage after all, even if it was one that he could get out of in the end. Sirius had not talked himself out of it and nor had he allowed James to talk him out of it. There was nothing that could be said to convince Sirius that he wasn't about to meet the love of his life and settle down perfectly happily.</p>
<p>"God, Siri," James whistled from behind him. "If I weren't straight, I would be pounding you into the bed right this second, never mind your upcoming groom."</p>
<p>Sirius didn't blush often, something he appreciated because it allowed him to hide a lot of what he was thinking and feeling. What happened instead was that the tips of his ears pinkened, and they were hidden by his mop hair.</p>
<p>His lack of brush meant he didn't have to tell James that comments like that made him uncomfortable. It meant that he didn't have to explain that he didn't even know why comments like that made him uncomfortable because he is definitely attracted to men. Big time. Still, now wasn't the time for that so Sirius just barked out a laugh and retorted. "Don't get too jealous of my future husband before you even set eyes on him."</p>
<p>James pouted. "I'll try not to. Maybe he has friends who are girls."</p>
<p>"You'll be lucky," Sirius laughed. They laughed about it a lot because they weren't the type of friends to had deep meaningful conversations. They didn't sit down and tell each other that they thought the other deserved the best things in the world, but they knew that they thought it. There were a lot of things that didn't need to be said. Like the fact that the Potter home was always there for him. James' family were rich but not in the same way as his own parents. James' father was an inventor who struck gold by chance and never forgot where he had come from. James wanted for nothing, but he was also taught the value of things. Sirius knew the value of their friendship without words, of James' whole family. He hadn't needed to change his surname to Potter to know that he was as much a son of Mia and Flea and James was.</p>
<p>"One day here's hoping," James grinned. "Who could turn down this face?"</p>
<p>"Well I certainly couldn't if you weren't straight," Sirius said.</p>
<p>"Curse our incompatible sexualities." James laughed. There was no chance for either of them to say anything else because the door opened and in strolled Rita Skeeter and her camera crew.</p>
<p>She was already speaking as she entered, "-ber that Mr Black he is from the Black Family, yes, yes you know the one." She smirked over at James and Sirius, both of which scowled back at her. "Of course, this particular Mr Black is not exactly on speaking terms with the rest of him. I suspect his groom will be a little disappointed to know that his new husband used to be worth more than a small country and is now worth zilch. Zero. Nil. Nada."</p>
<p>"They get the point," Sirius snapped, rolling his eyes. "Now did you want something, or would you like to-" He paused momentarily to stop himself from swearing. He did not want to be beeped out when this aired. "Go the hell away."</p>
<p>"Now, now, the viewers have questions, I'm sure," Skeeter said. "Now, Mr Black, tell me, what are you expecting to find out there? What does London's most striking homosexual bachelor hope to find when he walks into that chapel in just 23 minutes time?"</p>
<p>"A man," Sirius said. "I don't know. James, shall we invent one? His name is Robert Carlyle. He lives in the South East but not in London."</p>
<p>"He has a blond man bun," James piped in. "And he's only about 5-foot-tall, so he can make the short arse here look tall."</p>
<p>Sirius laughed. "Oh yeah, he has to be real short else I'm out of there." He nodded with mock seriousness. "He has to be ripped as fuck, anything else is not acceptable. I have needs you know."</p>
<p>Skeeter was grinning, eating up this sort of juice. This was what she lived for. Her expression fell into despair when James and Sirius both burst out laughing. James clapped Sirius on the back as Sirius bent over with his laughter. She raised an eyebrow and it reminded them of a teacher they had pranked many many times.</p>
<p>"Oh, come on, love," Sirius said, stifling back the last of his laughter. "Would I be on this show if I had an exact idea of who or what I wanted? God, I'm attracted to men, if the person out there is a man, then good, that'll be great."</p>
<p>"Well, we'll just have to see won't we," She said sweetly before backing out of the room, the camera focused on the panicked and confused expression that comment caused in Sirius.</p>
