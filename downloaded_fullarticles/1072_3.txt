  <b>Chapter 1. Fall For Me</b>
</h1><hr/><p>
  <b>July-01-2008--- Regent's Park, London, England </b>
</p><p>
  <b>POV Narrator</b>
</p><p>Harry hums absentmindedly to himself as he swings his feet pushing the park swing higher and higher. He closes his neon green and emerald green heterochromia eyes relishing in the weightless in-flight like feeling. It's been two months since his first year at Hogwarts let out. Since Hagrid came to pick him up for his first year, the Durselys kicked him out. They didn't even bother to drop him off at an orphanage or shelter. After all, it’s as they said, they were forced to keep him long enough. He's been on his own ever since. Aside from his lack of living arrangements, it isn't so different from living with the Dursleys.</p><p>He’s survived on his own well enough so far. It’s finding somewhere to live during the early fall and late winter months that's proving to be difficult. He's still expected at Hogwarts during the school year after all. Unfortunately, the Headmaster, Albus Dumbledore, refuses to allow him permission to stay within the year-round boarding school over the holidays or summer breaks. The man refuses to listen to his side of the story. He insists that the Durselys love will provide him with some form of magical blood protection. Even if he were blood-related to any of the Durselys, which he’s thankfully not, there is no love between them. Therefore the point is mute.</p><p>Personally, Harry doesn't mind being on his own during the summer months. Even being on his own during spring is easy enough. Spring out on the streets is comparable to the comfortable damp coolness of his Slytherin dormitory at Hogwarts. However, he quickly discovered being forced to spend Christmas out on the streets is its own special brand of torture. He's always had an unusual infinity for extreme temperatures going as far as to be immune literal fire and below 0 temps however other people don't know that. They don't need to either. It’s none of their business, besides its <em> not normal</em>.</p><p>Harry opens his eyes watching as he clears the thinning tree line of Regent's Park. He’s drinking his fill of the open sky and full sunset when the swing’s pendulum pulls him back to earth again. Harry frowns as the feeling of flight vanishes and gravity reinserts itself. As the swing rises into the sky once again Harry contemplates jumping if only to feel no restrictions between him, his magic, and the air. Alone with no company except for his thoughts Harry sees no harm in it. The park has been deserted for hours now and the shadows are quickly blending with nightfall. Unseen to Harry as he jumps, a lonely figure emerges from one such shadow head down and deep in thought. They both continue on their path until the two bodies collide and fall to the ground with muffled curses.</p><hr/><p>

  <b>POV Nico Di Angelo Age: 11.</b>
</p><p>“For fuck’s sake! Who in Merlin's name did I land on?” </p><p>“Shit! Who the Hades did I run into?” Nico mutters pondering over the other boy’s odd curse. He tries to get up only to elbow the other kid in the ribs as he gets kneed in the stomach.</p><p>“Hey! Watch it, will you?!” they both yell before staring in shock at each other and cracking up laughing.</p><p>“Uh...” Nico began only to stop and blush as he stared into the other boys glowing emerald green and neon green heterochromia eyes. They remind him of someone like a distant foggy memory. He clears his throat before continuing. “Look, I’m sorry. I wasn’t paying attention to where I was going.”</p><p>“You don’t say?” The boy asks with a deadpan expression before grinning and offering a hand. “I’m Harry, what’s your name?” </p><p>“I’m Nico.” Nico greets offering his hand once he's pulled himself to his feet.</p><p>“Thanks, Nico,” His voice is a little shy but cocky and he easily takes the proffered hand. The boy, Harry, is skinny, almost flesh and bones skinny, with wild black hair. He's wearing a black t-shirt paired army green cargo pants. “Wait, Nico? Nico di Angelo?”</p><p>“Harry?!” Nico asks surprised once he recognizes the other boy. “Wait aren't you British?” </p><p>“Well yeah, we are in Britain,” Harry says with an eye roll while giving him a once over. “You're the odd one with an Italian accent this far from Italy, mate.”</p><p>“This isn’t New York?” Nico asks shocked.</p><p>“No?” Harry says slowly before freezing and looking around. That's how Nico realized they are in fact in a park, at night, not at camp-half blood. “At least not the last time I checked it wasn't.” Harry continued before looking to him worriedly.</p><p>“They are <em>so </em>going to kill me,” Nico whispered to himself. He shook his head to clear his thoughts a bit, though unsteady on his feet as he glanced around him. ‘<em>What is a kid doing alone in a park at night? </em> ’ Nico wonders to himself before realizing. ‘<em>Wait I’m a kid alone in a park at night. Not to mention I accidentally shadow travelled here from another country. </em>’</p><p>“I take it you were in America last you checked?” Harry asks hesitantly breaking Nico from his thoughts.</p><p>“Yes,” Nico says running his hands through his wild raven hair and trying not to panic.</p><hr/><p>

  <b>POV Harry Potter, Age: 11.</b>
</p><p>“Yes,” Nico says very clearly panicking and running his hands through his mussed-up jet black hair. Judging by the feel of his, prominently dark, magic filling the air around them Harry's almost positive Nico’s a wizard-like himself.</p><p>“Right,” Harry says decisively while trying to decide how to help his friend out. Clearly Nico’s magic thought he needed to be here in England for some bizarre reason. Harry still clearly remembers the time his magic plopped him on the school roof. There were other cases of course. Like those times he ended up in various countries before finally making his way back to England. Each time all he wanted was to escape and his magic answered in its usual dramatic fashion. ‘<em>Maybe something like that happened to Nico.</em>’ Harry thinks to himself.</p><p>“Can you- I mean maybe your Aunt and Uncle- do you have a phone I can borrow?” Nico asks hesitantly while the night shadows grow darker and begin to whip around them.</p><p>“Mate, I’m homeless. I can barely afford a decent meal, so no.” Harry trails of hesitantly upon realizing what he just said.</p><p>“Well shit.” Nico murmured before muttering “I’m not in the state of New York. So, the main question is, where in England did I end up?”</p><p>“We’re in London, Regent's Park to be exact.” Harry helpfully provides.</p><p>“Well, maybe not.” Nico declares before plopping back down onto the mulch seemingly defeated. “Di Immortals, la mia fortuna è cattiva.” Nico sighed. “This must be what Father meant by accidentally shadow travelling to China.”</p><p>“What was that language?” Harry asks cocking his head to the side. “I understood ‘Gods’ but the rest was complete rubbish to me.”</p><p>Nico looks up at him an odd gleam in his eyes before clearly asking “Romani potes intellegere?” which Harry's mind instantly snaps to attention and translates to. “The Romans, you are able to understand them?” Before he has a chance to respond to the, frankly bizarre, question Nico quickly corrects himself. “Ísos katalavaínete tous Éllines?” Harry's brain instantly does a 180 and translates Nico’s words as “Maybe you understand the Greeks?”</p><p>Seeing no harm in it Harry responds in ancient Greek. “Katalavaíno tóso tous Éllines óso kai tous Romaíous.” which translates to “I understand both the Greeks and the Romans.” Then before Nico has a chance to do more than look to him bewildered and sceptical Harry continues in ancient Roman Latin. “Quid rogas?” which means “Why do you ask?”</p><p>Nico gapes at him for a moment which ‘<em>Fair,</em>’ Harry thinks, ‘<em>it's unlikely many people can speak seemingly dead languages at the drop of a hat. Even wizards use a butchered version of the languages.</em>’</p><p>“Are you a demigod too?” Nico asks before freezing as a look of panic overtakes his face.</p><p>“Maybe. I mean… I have shit luck and I just found out I’m a wizard last year, so anything is possible at this point.” Harry says trying to think about the odd question logically. ‘<em>Given everything that has happened to me so far being a demigod wouldn't make it all so weird. If anything it would explain some things. Well, actually it would explain a lot…</em>’</p><hr/><p>

  <b>POV Nico Di Angelo, Age: 11.</b>
</p><p>‘<em>Shit-Shit-Shit-Oh Fuck! What if he's not a demigod?! I probably look like such a lunatic right now and-'</em></p><p>“Maybe. I mean… I have shit luck and I just found out I’m a wizard last year, so anything is possible at this point.” Harry responds with a thoughtful frown.</p><p>“Wait, wizard?” Nico asks confused. “Don't you mean Hecate blessed?”</p><p>“No. I mean wizard.” Harry says slowly and with an exasperated eye roll. “You know, owls, wands, potions? You're one too or did you not get your letter.” Harry asks with a cute worried frown. </p><p>“Letter?” Nico asks cocking his head to the side confused.</p><p>"Yeah, they send out letters to everyone with magic once you turn 11. I almost didn't get mine, but uh, my parents were well-known wizards so they sent someone to fetch me. Yours probably got lost or someone confiscated it thinking it was a joke."</p><p>“Do you know around when it was supposed to arrive?” Nico asks head still cocked to the side.</p><p>“Um, no?” Harry says slowly. “Mine arrived around my birthday.”</p><p>“I was running from a greek monster on my birthday.” </p><p>“What, again?” Harry asks with a worried frown.</p><p>“Yeah. I'm surprised you've lasted as long as you have to be honest. Especially with you having both aspects of your godly parent. That's really rare you know?”</p><p>“There's been a few close calls but I honestly just thought they were Death Eaters.”</p><p>“Death Eaters?” Nico asks confused</p><p>“They're wizarding terrorists from what I understand. I’ve only known about the magical world for about a year now.”</p><p>“Why would you be targeted by wizard terrorists?” Nico asks bewildered</p><p>“My uh, my parents were rather famous wizards and died martyrs from what I understand,” Harry explains while ruffling his hair. “It’s all rather confusing given that I've only just found out about it all.”</p><p>“Right,” Nico says nodding his head decisively and taking Harry’s hand. </p><p>“Uh, what?” Harry asks looking to their joint hands bewildered.</p><p>“I’m taking you to meet my father he's an Olympian God and the King of The Underworld. We’re going to find out what's going on with you.”</p>
