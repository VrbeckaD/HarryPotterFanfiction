    <p>Nymphadora Tonks was a young witch of 22 who had a secret. It was easy to hide her secret. Tonks walked through the hallway with Alastor Moody. They head towards a door, but on the way, Tonks tripped once again on the umbrella stand. "Watch where you're going," Alastor barked at her.</p><p>She groaned, behind Alastor as they walked into the room. Tonks sank into a chair that was next to Remus Lupin. Her grey eyes looked around the room as she played with her bubblegum pink hair that was short today. Most of the Order was already there. "How are we this fine night Nymphadora?" he asked.</p><p>Tonks turned to him with a smile on her face. She wanted to glare at him for calling her Nymphadora, but for some reason, it didn't bother her. Everyone knew she went by Tonks. 'He's cute,' Tonks thought to herself. She hadn't realized that she was staring at him until Sirius said: "Take a picture, it will last longer."</p><p>Sirius sat down next to Tonks on her other side. She glared at him as she turned to him. "Right, Sirius," she then turned back to Remus to answer him. "I am fine, thanks. Since I have left work for the day, things are a lot better. Also, Alastor wants me to patrol with him tonight."</p><p>Remus gave her a nod with a smile gracing his lips. The man was head over hills in love with Tonks, but it would never work. She was a normal girl. Remus John Lupin, on the other hand, was a werewolf and a monster. "That's fantastic, Nymphadora," he said once again, calling her by her given name. “I am sure that you will have a good patrol.”</p><p>He mentally scolded himself for that last bit. You could say that Remus was nervous. There was only one other time that he was in love. It hadn’t gone very well, so Remus tended to stay away from relationships altogether. “You look amazing,” mumbled Remus.</p><p>Only Sirius heard that who didn’t say a word. He wasn’t going to out Remus. Remus had always called Tonks by her first name. The habit wasn’t going to go away anytime soon. It was a pretty name to him. “Remus once again, please call me Tonks,” Tonks said, frowning at him.</p><p>Remus smiled at her. "You know that I can't, or at least I won't. Calling people by their first name is what I do," Remus said.</p><p>Sirius chuckled. He knew the real reason why Remus called people by their first name. Lupin couldn’t use a nickname since Peter turned on them. “Fine, Remus, but I wish you would call me Tonks,” said Tonks giving in for once. </p><p>Sirius smirked at the two of them. He planned to get them together. He hoped it worked. Remus gave Sirius a look. He didn't like the look on Sirius' face at all. "So, how are things between Charlie and you?" Remus asked, being polite.</p><p>Last year, Charlie had come home for the summer. Things got heated between the two of them. He asked her out; then, they dated for a bit. Tonks put a frown on her face. “What’s wrong?” asked Sirius.</p><p>Once Tonks had told Charlie her secret, he dumped her. He was angry that she never told him what she was. Plus, Charlie wasn’t happy about what she was. Among other things, Charlie said it was a mistake to date her. He also said that he wouldn’t be there for their kid. "It's over. He dumped me after I told him I was pregnant," said Tonks.</p><p>They didn’t need to know the other reason yet. Tears started to come to her eyes. She wasn't over it yet. Tonks still loved Charlie in ways, but she vowed to move on. She didn't need Charlie. "I am sorry," Remus replied.</p><p>“I am sorry,” as well said Sirius wanting to kill Charlie. </p><p>Tonks was still frowning through her tears "It's alright. Remus, it isn't your fault. I can handle things," Tonks stated.</p><p>Remus lifted his hand, then put it to her face so that he could wipe away the tears. "I know you are a strong girl and you can do this. Sirius and I will help in any way that we can," Remus said.</p><p>Sirius gave the nod. He would do whatever he could for his cousin. "Thanks," she said.</p><p>A moment pasted as Arthur came into the room. He went to sit next to Molly. “Hello, Tonks. It’s good to see you,” said Arthur smiling at her.</p><p>She nodded at him. They didn’t get to speak much at work. Fudge was watching everyone’s move. “Hey, Arthur. It’s good to see you too,” Tonks said as the others came into the room.</p><p>Dumbledore started the meeting as soon as everyone was seated. The older man began to talk about Order business that didn’t pertain to Tonks. She was having trouble paying attention with Remus next to her. It was usual for her. Remus grinned at her. She smiled back at him. “That’s all for now,” Albus said.</p><p>A few started to stand up. Alastor spoke up. “Albus, are you going to ask Tonks about the thing?” </p><p>He figured she wouldn’t have anything yet. Plus, it was kind of private, but maybe Alastor did have a point in asking. Albus could get the info while he was her. “Nymphadora, do you have anything for me?" Albus asked, looking at her.</p><p>Tonks looked over towards Dumbledore as Sirius and Remus shared a look. “What could this be about?” Sirius mouthed.</p><p>The other man gave him a look. “I have no idea,” Remus mouthed back. </p><p>Over the last few weeks, she had gone undercover in the south. There was a pack down there made up of female werewolves. There weren't many, but they were strong, and they kept to themselves. "No, they still do not want to believe it. I did try, but you know how hard it is with Rosa out there," Tonks said.</p><p>Remus, who was grinning because of Tonks, now wore a frown on his face. He knew who Rosa was. She was a female werewolf that could take Greyback in a heartbeat. But she was worried about his pack coming after her.  Rosa was the female pack leader who ran the only female pack in the south. “Is he crazy?” asked Sirius to Remus in a quiet voice. </p><p>Shrugging his shoulders. He wondered what Dumbledore was doing. He didn’t think it was wise to send a pregnant Auror out on a mission. “I don’t think so, but this once he may be,” Remus said quietly.</p><p>"It's fine, Nymphadora. You tried. I knew they wouldn't, but I had to see. Remus, I would like you to go down there. You may have better luck than Nymphadora. Good day to you all," Albus said, getting up and leaving the house.</p><p>Albus never stayed around after the meetings unless they needed him too. “Good night,” McGonagall said, getting up.</p><p>“Goodnight, Minerva,” Remus said as she went out of the room.</p><p>She never stuck around after meetings. Minerva was a very busy woman. “Night Professor McGonagall,” called out Tonks to her.  </p><p>Tonks turned to look at Remus, who had a frown on his face. "What made you go down there beside Albus asking you too? Rosa or any one of them would turn you in a heartbeat," Remus stated.</p><p>He cared too much about her. Remus didn’t want to see her get hurt. “For your information, Dumbledore had asked me too as you said,” she said, giving him a look. </p><p>She continued. “Yes, you could have done the job, but Albus thought she might listen to a woman since she is a female werewolf and not a male werewolf. Plus, you were bitten by a male werewolf.”</p><p>Tonks was getting angry. She got up from the table and started to leave. Remus grabbed her arm. "I am sorry, Nymphadora, I don't want to see you get hurt," replied Remus.</p><p>Tonks pulled her arm away. "I can take care of myself, thank you," Tonks replied to him in an angry voice.</p><p>With that, Tonks swept out of the room. Alastor was out there waiting for her. "Tonks, you should tell him soon. He is bound to find out, and you would stand a better chance with him," Alastor said.</p><p>Tonks hugged him. While Alastor hated hugs, he didn't mind her giving him hugs. "I know I need to tell him, but Remus shouldn't have to put up with a child nor deal with what I go through each month. He goes through enough already. I know he is one too, but still," Tonks said.</p><p>Remus' head started to spin. He thought of something. But it couldn't be true because there were no scars on her face or any part of her body that he could see. 'Could Nymphadora be a werewolf,' Remus thought. It was possible because she could change her appearance at a moment's notice. Also, Remus took in the fact that she was never around on a full moon. He only knew that because Sirius had told him one night while they were talking about her. "Sirius?" Remus asked.</p><p>Sirius looked over to Remus after looking up from the table he was staring down at. "Yes?" he asked back.</p><p>He was curious about what Remus was going to ask him. "Do you think something could be wrong with Tonks?" asked Remus.</p><p>A smirk appeared on Sirius's face. "Like what exactly? A werewolf? I doubt it, Remus, you're worried because of the mission she had. Stop overthinking things as you do," Sirius said.</p><p>Sirius was right; he needed to stop overthinking things. Remus gave Sirius a nod. Tonks was, and there was nothing wrong with her. It was in Remus' head. But, Remus should have listened to his gut because he was right.</p>
