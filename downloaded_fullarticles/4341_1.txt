    <p>It was the beginning of summer and Cedric's death, still haunted his memories, along with the scene at the graveyard. He hated it and there was nothing he could do about it. Vernon rarely lets him out of the basement every three days and that was to write the Order a letter saying he was okay and to not ask for help. </p><p>...Not that Harry would get it even if he asked anyways. Vernon was using him more than usual during the summer, but Harry found a way to make the sensation numb whenever he entered him and just let him do what he wanted, he stopped reacting when he was nine because the sick bastard would only stay longer if he did. </p><p>Right now, Vernon was finishing up with him and he sighed in pleasure as he emptied himself inside Harry, who just laid there on the bed and accepted it with silence and waited for Vernon to get his weight off of him and kick him off the bed so he could go back into the cage. </p><p>Oh yeah, didn't you know? Vernon downgraded him from cupboard to a cage in the basement where he was given scraps in a dog bowl and he heard conversations between the both his uncle and cousin saying that Dudley would have to become a man and he would start his practice with Harry. </p><p>Vernon got off of Harry, his small cock sliding out of his asshole and he grabbed Harry by his hair was dragged to his cage in the basement and tossed inside. </p><p>"Listen freak, you are needed for an important job opportunity, maybe just maybe if you're good then one of my clients will take you as their personal bitch, but not after I remind you of your place. However...any of your freakiness, I will make you wish you were never born, do you understand?" He said in a deadly tone.</p><p>"Yes...uncle."</p><p>"Good, for a little freak. Now, you will get more money if you are actually fed so..." Vernon gave him his usual dog bowl, but instead just scraps, there was a piece of white bread, a whole chicken leg barely cooked, but cooked so he wouldn't get sick and a glass of what he already knew. </p><p>"You are to eat and drink everything or I will make you. I will not let this opportunity go to waste." He said, his cold, beady eyes watching his every move. </p><p>Harry ate slowly and swallowed and saved the 'milk' for last. He drank it, but he found out early on that if he held his breath, then the taste wouldn't affecting him that much. He learned the hard way what happened if he puked up Vernon's special drink. </p><p>After licking the cup clean, he opened his mouth and showed Vernon that he swallowed it all. </p><p>Vernon nodded and left the tray there and made his way upstairs. Muttering how he will have to hose him down and dress him for the clients in the morning. </p><p>Harry fell in a semi-peaceful sleep, already used to this routine. The first time back from Hogwarts was the worst. </p><p>Soon the next day arrived... Harry woke up with sharp pain as he was dragged to the backyard, early in the morning and tossed away and sprayed with cold water and Vernon made him clean himself using very limited dish soap while spraying him with the cold water and when that was done, he took him inside and made him wear a thong and stay on <em>that </em>bed, until he said so.</p><p>Harry did what he ordered and made his way quickly to the bed and locked the door only for the 'client' to open next. He went quickly so Vernon couldn't ask him to service him with his mouth. </p><p>For hours, Harry stayed in that room, glancing at the door or the camera that was in the room and soon the sounds of cars and people talking or in Petunia's case screeching filled the house. The evening had just begun and it for the auction of who gets to be first and over twenty men were there in their fancy suits. All of them wanted the beautiful green-eyed boy, but one was there in that hell for one reason and it was to awaken his charge. </p><p>"The auction has started! For the first one of the night, we start the bid off at 10,000 pounds!"</p><p>Most of the numbers went up and then Vernon started to raise it from there, from 10,000 to 15,000 then to 20,000 and he kept raising the number until Vernon made the deal of 50,000 pounds! Only two were left in betting and Vernon had money signs in his eyes. </p><p>"Next 75,000 pounds!" The person who raised a number to pay it was a greasy man with a weight to rival Vernon's while the other was a well-dressed man with a strong figure with raven locks brushed back with a pale skin tone as his looks made him look like a well-chiseled statue. </p><p>"We have-" "Wait!!" </p><p>"Huh?" Vernon asked </p><p>The greasy man was trying to glare at whoever spoke, but when the other man stood up he said, "I will pay you 100,000 pounds and I will double it if I get to have him right now!" </p><p>"Deal!!" Vernon said, nearly drooling at all that money. </p><p>The greasy fat man grits his yellow-stained teeth and looked lustfully at the green-eyed boy glancing at the camera feed. </p><p>The man strongly gripped Vernon's hand in a handshake and then the lights went out and the man let out a strong pulse of magic that knocked out everyone else in the house, except Harry who stiffened at the feel of magic. </p><p>The man went upstairs after prying the information from Vernon's head about where Harry was and Harry tensed as he could hear footsteps coming closer and closer and what surprised Harry was that the man knocked, but it soon faded and he said, "Please come inside, Master."</p><p>The man entered inside and Harry quickly hid his shock, he couldn't help but think that the man who entered was very good looking and he felt the magic that came from downstairs, pour out from him.  </p><p>"M-may ask who you are, Master?" </p><p>"My name is Drake, young one." He said, walking until he was just a few feet away from the barely-clothed boy. </p><p>"How do you want me, master?"</p><p>"Harry...I need to awaken you."</p><p>"W-what? Wait? Um~, are you a wizard?"</p><p>"You could say that, but I am also a creature and I am part of a fae clan."</p><p>"Fae?"</p><p>"Yes and so are you. I am here to awaken you."</p><p>Harry took his wand he hid underneath the pillow and points it in the middle of his face.</p><p>"You don't believe me," Drake said, not worried at all</p><p>Harry didn't reply, but his iron grip on his wand told him Harry's answer. </p><p>Drake walked until the wand was nearly touching his nose and gently pushed wooden stick out his way as he sat on his bed, keeping his dark eyes in contact with Harry's green ones. </p><p>"You're not lying, are you? My magic it's-"</p><p>"Curling around me, prodding me." He said, pressing his forehead against Harry's. He hissed as felt a disgusting piece of magic trying to leech off of him.</p><p>"Your scar...There's something inside it."</p><p>"Inside...my scar?"</p><p>"Yes...Do you want me to remove it?"</p><p>"Then you fuck me silly, right after?" Harry said, plainly</p><p>"That all depends on you, Harry."</p><p>"Do what you want Drake," Harry said, closing his eyes</p><p>Drake let magic fill his fingertips and make the process as painless as possible to remove the evil tainting his scar. Harry violently flinched as he heard loud and pain-filled screaming from far away. </p><p>Voldemort, on the other hand, was screaming in horrible pain as Drake was pulling out his a part of his soul out of Harry's scar, removing any and all connections with him and soon it was finished. </p><p>Harry fell on his back on the bed as he panted in exertion as he looked at Drake, entrapping a dark fragment piece encircled with his own magic. </p><p>Harry couldn't help but say, "Wow~."</p><p>Drake gave a light smile as he slowly crushed the evil magic being contained in a sphere of his own magic, the pain-filled screams made a darker part of Harry want to grin, but he just watched as Drake crushed the piece of evil magic out of existence. </p><p>"Your scar has faded now. It's barely noticeable."</p><p>"Really?" Harry said, touching his forehead, brushing his fingertips against the scarred skin.</p><p>Drake kissed his temple, making Harry flinch and twitch at the kiss. His magic was pulsing underneath his skin, making him feel very hot, he didn't want to but he restrained himself from grinding his cock against Drake's clothed one. </p><p>"You already know what you want Harry, let your magic guide you. I swear on my magic, pride, sanity, and life that I will never willingly cause you harm unless it cannot be avoided." He said as a glow of magic surrounded him and Harry allowed himself to sit up and crawl into his lap. </p><p>"Tell me what you want, Harry." He whispered low to Harry</p><p>"Off. Take. this. off." Harry said, pulling at his suit jacket and Drake did what Harry wanted and Foster pulled the younger boy close to him, their heartbeats slowing down until they started to beat in sync with each other. </p><p>Harry felt a red blush dust his cheeks and he panted as heat and blood pooled into his crotch as he grinded himself into Drake who returned it. </p><p>"Harry..."</p><p>He gulped, he never willingly gave himself up to another person and it scared him, but he swallowed his doubt and said, "Take me. I want you to take me and make me forget everyone and everything to the best of your ability."</p><p>"If that is what you wish. I will make you enjoy this, Harry. I promise you." He kissed him, cramming his tongue inside Harry's mouth, tasting him as he stripped off the rest of his clothes. Harry took off his thong and pressed his cock against Drake's, groaning at the pleasure contact. </p><p>Pre-cum pooled at the tip of their cocks as they finally released their lips from each other, saliva trailing down their chins from the sloppy kiss. There was no need for words, all Harry could feel was the need to be taken and it was from the gorgeous man in front of him. </p><p>Harry laid down the bedspread and spread his legs open as Drake lined himself at his entrance as he looked into Harry's eyes and he nodded for him to go ahead. Slowly, he pushed his tip inside of Harry who forced himself to relax until Drake was fully seated inside of Harry's ass. </p><p>The boy in question could only sigh as the thick and long length of Drake's cock pulsed inside of him with heat. </p><p>"Move...You can move now," Harry said, as the cock inside of him started to pull out and then thrust back inside forcing air out of Harry's lungs and he continued to thrust away at Harry's ass. </p><p>"...Ahh...Ahhhnnn... Faster, Harder!" </p><p>Drake pounded away at him and pulled him up, where Harry bounced up and down on his cock, holding onto the older man's shoulders as tried to position himself to where he would find the spot where he would see stars. </p><p>After several more thrusts, Drake found it, making Harry yell as he saw stars behind his eyes, "Again! Hit that spot again!"</p><p>Drake smirked and made to comply with Harry's wish, thrusting up while Harry went down, as the pair finally found a pattern to where they would receive maximum pleasure. </p><p>"D-Drake! I'm about to cum! I'm going to-" </p><p>"Do it! Cum for me, I'm going to cum inside you!"</p><p>"Fuck!" Harry snapped, biting into his shoulder as he came on both of their stomachs, heat taking over his body and Drake filled him with spurts of hot cum as Harry shuddered around him.  </p><p>Harry removed his mouth from his shoulder, he broke his skin and then felt something heat up at his back and he groaned at the uncomfortably tight feeling on both of his shoulder blades.  </p><p>"Don't fight it... Embrace it, Harry." Drake said </p><p>Harry screamed as he felt pain like nothing he ever felt before as onyx-black wings burst out of his back, he wept in pain as Drake kissed his tears away and Harry kissed him back. </p><p>"Thank you..." </p><p>"Of course, by the time you wake up, you will be a dark fae and then you will know everything," Drake said with a smile</p><p>Harry smiled back and nodded to sleep with a purr, onyx wings faded away and turned into black outlines of his wings. </p><p>Drake pulled himself out of Harry who slightly whined at the loss as he took him to clean him off and transfigured clothes from both himself and Harry. Drake carried his awakened one down the stairs, trying to find Harry's magical items and walked out of the house and then disappeared. </p><p>After Drake dropped Harry off at his bedroom at a beautiful castle and sent several healers to watch over him and fix the damage that his awakening couldn't. </p><p>He pulled out a cellphone and made a phone call and said, "Hey, you know that favor that you owe me? Yeah, but I think that this one you will enjoy fulfilling. There is a family and a group of people to be destroyed. Head to the Pivet Drive #4 in Surrey and you need to look for the fattest man, look into his mind and you will find out the rest of the story. Also, when you come back to the castle, you have to be ready to welcome another member into the family." Drake said, before shutting off his cellphone</p><hr/><p>Ending the chapter! I had to make a dark creature Harry fanfiction, it had to happen. I'm happy people like my other stories. It makes me really happy. Anyways, the Dursleys and the people who were there at the selling of Harry will be ousted as child molesters and rapists, which all of them are. The rest of the neighborhood will be seen as pariahs for not helping a boy in need and it will all over the news. </p><p>The Order will find out about Harry later through Hermione, Harry will be on the line through life and death and meet several people along the way, Voldemort reaction to losing his connection with Harry and Harry's new beginning as a dark fae and visit Cedric's grave with unseen people watching from afar.
