    <p align="center">Harry Potter</p><p> </p><p>Harry stood staring at the Veil of Death with a feeling of unease as images of Sirius’ death swirled through his mind.  Even at the age of twenty Harry was still plagued by nightmares of his godfather’s death that still kept him up at night.  For no matter how many times he was told it wasn’t his fault he knew better, for it had been him that led Sirius to his death. </p><p>He watched in morbid fascination as the mist within the veil moved elegantly around its narrow stone prison, unable to suppress the shiver that ran over him as he thought about what he was about to do.  Many people would consider his plan to be insane but to Harry it was the last resort.  The war was over but the damage done to his friends and the Wizarding World at large was too great.</p><p>The war had ravaged the British magical community with both sides, the Order and Voldemort’s forces, taking massive losses.  The magical population of Britain was a fraction of what it once was, and regardless of the number of buildings they repaired the feeling of loss was still rampant through every fake smile plastered on in public.</p><p>Like everyone else Harry had tried moving on.  He’d gone back to Hogwarts and finished his education, gained a mastery and he’d even moved into Grimmauld Place but something always felt like it was missing.  When he wasn’t having horrific flashbacks of the war, he’d dreamt of the Veil of Death and saw himself walking through it with his head held high and no hesitation.  At first he passed it off as depression knowing from personal experience that the veil only promised death.  However, the more he ignored it, the more the dreams persisted and the more of a push he felt.</p><p>That push turned into a compulsion to find out more about the Veil of Death and it wasn’t what he expected.  It had taken him a while but he eventually found an ancient scroll that actually posited that the Veil didn’t kill but was a doorway to another world.  From that day onwards Harry couldn’t stop thinking about the doorway and its possibilities; it haunted not only his dreams but his every thought.</p><p>Eventually after months he concocted a plan and he would walk through it no matter what.  It was like something was pushing him to walk through it and he was tired of suppressing it.  So there he was standing in front of the archway with his magically enhanced backpack over his shoulder and determination roaring in his eyes.</p><p>Realising that he wouldn’t be able to stay unnoticed within the Department of Mysteries forever, Harry rallied himself, closed his eyes and took a deep breath before stepping through the portal.</p><p align="center">--</p><p>Harry had only taken a few steps forward before stopping on the other side of the veil.  It wasn’t until he felt a chilly breeze whip through his untameable hair that Harry finally, and very hesitantly, opened his eyes.  Immediately Harry’s jaw swung open of its own accord effectively registering his shock.  With nobody in recorded history having successfully survived a trip through the veil Harry was unsure what to expect, but he anticipated something - more.  Despite the ominous feel to the gateway, the process of walking through the veil was rather akin to walking through a door into a dark room; no death – nothing. </p><p>He wasn’t sure if he was in London or some foreign country but his immediate surroundings were rather obvious and didn’t require much deducing.  He was standing before an old cemetery complete with wrought iron fence and unmanaged fauna that threatened to overcome the unkempt tombstones.  Tearing himself away from the sad image of a nearby tombstone, covered in vines and weeds with a large crack along its centre, Harry took a steady breath as he ran his hands through his hair.</p><p>“I…I did it.”  Harry whispered in shock.  “I did it!” </p><p>Feeling an odd sense of relief and happiness flood his body, Harry couldn’t help the booming laugh that burst out of him.  While he didn’t doubt his research he knew there was a chance that something could go wrong; something he’d been told by Hermione and Ron a lot over their adventures.</p><p>As Harry’s laughter died off to soft giggling his ears picked up whispered tones nearby, with this ingrained war reflexes pushing his actions Harry swiftly spun around to see a couple, muggle from their proper state of dress, standing off to the left behind him sharing suspicious glances at him. </p><p>Knowing that he must look quite a sight wearing plain light blue wizarding robes and laughing like an idiot in a cemetery, Harry gave the pair a smile that felt more like a grimace before turning to his right and following the dirt road that ran in front of the lot.  With his experience being in the spotlight, Harry expertly fought the temptation to turn around and see if they’re still watching him, instead choosing to put on a burst of speed.</p><p>Once he was certain that he was out of sight, Harry took a deep breath and took a seat on the side of the road to collect himself.  He had no idea where he was with nothing but green countryside surrounding him, but as he watched the sun sinking below the horizon throwing beautiful reds and oranges over the sky, he found that he didn’t mind too much. </p><p>Slowly lowering himself the rest of the way to the ground, feeling himself sink slightly into the soft grass, Harry stared up at the sky with a small smile.  Looking back at his life, he always felt like he was always on the go either serving his horrible relatives or saving the wizarding world from destruction.  However, that was all behind him now with no expectations to hold him down.  Surviving the trip was an opportunity for him to get a life away from the attention of being ‘Harry Potter’.  The idea of being free from the pressure of being the ‘saviour’ filled Harry with such excitement and joy that his smile stretched wider over his face.</p><p>However, before he could get himself a life he needed to find out if there was a magical world here, wherever here was, and find somewhere to live for a while.  With a location in mind that would help both goals Harry once again carefully looked around, to make sure there were no muggles watching, before standing up and apparated away with a crack.</p><p align="center">--</p><p>Harry appeared in an alley opposite the entrance to the Leaky Cauldron.  Sticking his head around the corner to scope out the street he was happy to see that it was practically deserted; the street only featured a stout blonde jogger waddling down the road covered in so much sweat it looked like he’d been swimming and an elderly couple walking down the opposite side hand in hand.  While he shouldn’t be too surprised, considering how early it was, Harry thanked his lucky stars and crossed the street before heading into the hidden magical inn.</p><p>In between wars in his home world the Leaky Cauldron was the hub for British magical beings, packed with all kinds of patrons and was filled with life and laughter as customers went about their day.  However, this dimension wasn’t anything like that. </p><p>Adjusting the strap on his bag Harry glanced around the inn.  The dilapidated room had clearly seen better days with scorch marks on the floor, chunks blasted from the stone walls and the odd smell of blood that hung ominously in the air.  Knowing he couldn’t stand in the entrance all day, Harry stepped into the inn where he quickly became pinned by four sets of eyes.</p><p>The only people in the pub were two men sitting against the back wall, their identities protected by their black hoods, whispering to each other as their beady eyes darted around with paranoid efficiency.  There was a wizard sitting at the bar with graying hair and a permanent scowl wrapped up in thick maroon battle robes.  Finally was the famous innkeeper, Tom, who was practically oozing distrust as his eyes bore into the back of Harry’s head. </p><p>Feeling rather unwelcome Harry ignored the four and headed out into the courtyard beyond the inn and out into Diagon Alley.  As the entrance way parted Harry had been hoping for something to remind him of how his world was before the second war, something positive or happy in the slightest, like the first time he’d experienced magic at eleven.  Unfortunately, his hopes were dashed as this world kept up its depressing theme – this wasn’t the Diagon Alley he knew.</p><p>A deep sense of fear covered the hand full of shoppers in the nearly deserted shopping district and it made the hairs on the back of his neck stand on end.  Something wasn’t right here.  He slowly moved down the street as two witches walked past him ensuring to keep their heads down and gave him a wide berth, as though he was carrying the plague, and noticed it wasn’t just the fear or lack of shoppers that was concerning him but the shops themselves. </p><p>Numerous stores he passed were boarded up, he could practically feel the dangerous wards smothered over them as he passed, the cobbled street itself was damaged and even had a few crater sized holes in it every few yards.  Not to mention that the few shops that were open were hardly welcoming. </p><p>Madam Malkin’s Robes for All Occasions had a sour looking dumpling of a wizard sitting out the front of the store, sharpening an axe with an unsettling amount of interest in his dead little eyes.  The Magical Menagerie looked about half the size he was used to seeing but it was the few long splashes of red along the shop’s front door that deeply unsettled him.</p><p>Finally reaching his destination Harry sighed in relief as he took in the massive white bank.  It was exactly as he remembered it.  It was such an odd thing to feel relief about, that the goblin’s bank stood slightly lopsided as it always had, but he’d take what he could get. </p><p>Harry had just reached the front of the bank from the street when the two goblin guards on either side of the doors jumped to attention and blocked his entry with massive spears. </p><p>“Go away, Wizard.  Your kind isn’t welcome here.”  The one on the left spat tightening his grip on his weapon.</p><p>“What?”  Harry asked perplexed.  “All I wanted to do was open an account.”</p><p>“You’ve got five seconds to leave before we attack.”  His short companion chimed in with a cruel smirk across his pasty face.  “One…Two…”</p><p>Knowing that they weren’t going to be convinced, Harry held up his hands in surrender and slowly backed away from the bank. </p><p>Harry swore under his breath.  Before stepping through the veil he’d completely emptied all of his accounts and collected all of his possessions in his bag using powerful extension charms to help.  Anything and everything he’d need to start a new life was strapped to his back and now that he couldn’t safely deposit it he was feeling a little exposed. </p><p>Shuffling along the cobbled street his stomach let out a low rumble.  Realising he’d not eaten anything in a while, Harry decided to head back to the Leaky Cauldron and to try and order something for breakfast. </p><p>‘I need a new plan.’  Harry thought to himself as he strode up the semi familiar cobbled path towards the Leaky Cauldron.  ‘I need to secure my backpack, maybe visit the bookstore to research this world’s history and find someone safe to live.’</p><p>Just as he was passing Slug &amp; Jiggers Apothecary a loud explosion tore through Diagon Alley the force of which threw him to the ground and shattered windows along the street.  Once it had passed Harry swiftly got up and looked behind him trying to suss out the situation.  He couldn’t see any massive fires or smoke to alert him to the location of the explosion but as shrieks pierced the air he knew it couldn’t have been far away.</p><p>Suddenly a man tore past him and stood in the middle of the alley with his back to Harry a few steps away.  Without warning he lifted his grey wand into the air and made a familiar gesture in the air that stimulated Harry into casting a silencing charm around himself.  Unfortunately, he was a fraction of a second to late as the caterwauling charm activated expelling a scream that tore at every nerve ending in his body.</p><p>However, as his silencing charm fell over him he let out a sigh of relief.  He hated that charm.  The Deatheaters in his world had used that when they took over Hogsmeade, Hogwarts and the Ministry which made their year of searching for Horcruxes very challenging. </p><p>Within seconds the few shops that weren’t boarded up quickly expelled people as they ran into the street and towards the Leaky Cauldron.  Harry was a bit irritated that he couldn’t hear what they were screaming or what the man with the grey wand was shouting but it was worth the sacrifice as the caterwauling charm had been known to make people deaf; something that he couldn’t afford to have happen in an unknown and dangerous world he knew nothing about.</p><p>It hadn’t taken long before Diagon Alley was deserted with shoppers and workers having been successfully evacuated within moments.  It was only once the alley was empty that Harry caught a proper look at the man who started the evacuation, feeling slightly surprised as he recognised the wonky nose and the grey hair as the unpleasant wizard he saw in the Leaky Cauldron earlier. </p><p>‘Bodyguard?’  Harry thought to himself noting the usefulness of the man’s demeanour and broad shoulders in such a field that required intimidation and battle ready situations. </p><p>With only the two of them left the man quickly approached, sending frustrated glances at him, before grabbing Harry’s forearm and starting to drag him back towards the Leaky Cauldron.  Realising that the man was mumbling something under his breath, judging from the way his jaw kept moving about, Harry lifted the silencing charm.</p><p>“Stupid civilians…gonna get someone killed…”</p><p>Harry bristled at his heated words.  He just opened his mouth to retort when screams filled the air again from further down the alley. </p><p>While he wanted to be free from his past and tedious titles like hero and saviour he wouldn’t ignore someone’s screams; he hated the attention and danger that followed such things and wanted something more but he couldn’t change who he was.  Electing to be a healer meant that he could still help people without having to be in the spot light and risking his own life again.  Besides he’d taken an oath to help any he could and he wouldn’t dismiss it.</p><p>Noticing that they were nearly at the exit to alley, Harry quickly pulled his arm back from the older man.</p><p>“What the hell are you doing, fool?”  The man spat spinning around and glaring at Harry.  “You should’ve evacuated like everyone else and now you’re being difficult again cause I’m trying to save your life.”</p><p>“I have to go help.”  Harry said turning back towards the alley only to be spun back around by a calloused hand.</p><p>“Civilians aren’t allowed to fight…you’d only get in our way anyway.  So be a good little boy and get to safety in the Leaky Cauldron!”</p><p>Harry narrowed his eyes at the man, his patronising attitude was really rubbing him the wrong way, as his hands tightened dangerously around his wand.  When he took his healers oath he swore to help those in need and he wouldn’t let some blowhard get in his way.</p><p>“<em>Somnium</em>.”  Harry said flicking his wand at the man causing his grey eyes to flutter slightly before his legs gave out from under him and he fell down in a heap.</p><p>Knowing it could be dangerous to leave him under a sleeping charm during such a situation, Harry levitated his body to the side of the alley and placed a few shielding charms and notice-me-not spells around his sleeping form.</p><p>With his unwanted guard asleep, Harry took off sprinting down the alley as more shouting and screaming filled the air.  He’d been delayed already because of that guy so he could only hope that nobody had died in the interim.</p><p>The screaming and shouts got louder and more desperate with each step he took down the cobbled street.  He had just passed Gringotts when he could finally see the fighting up ahead.  There were roughly fifteen people at the entrance to Knockturn Alley fighting viciously as the air lit up with a multitude of color as their deadly spells sped towards their enemies.  While he couldn’t really recognise the fighters, it was more of a concern that he could recognise what some of them were wearing.</p><p>“Shit.”  Harry muttered as he quickly placed a notice-me-not spell over himself.</p><p>‘Can’t catch a bloody break.’  He thought bitterly to himself as he watched Deatheaters duel expertly with vigorous use of dark magic.  He wanted a break from war and here he was stuck in the middle of another one.</p><p>From what he could see the fight seemed to be between three groups; the Deatheaters versus those clad in maroon battle robes, like his sleeping friend, and those in green battle robes.  Unfortunately, it looked like the Deatheaters were winning.  While the red and green robes were greater in number they were far from the strongest group in the alley. </p><p>Only two Deatheaters had gone down as their five fellows kept fighting using advanced duelling techniques and not holding back.  The other side had at least ten unable to fight in various locations around the duelling area with fifteen fighters still engaging the Deatheaters, but Harry could tell it was a matter of time before they lost.  They were sloppy and relied too much on their wand work, which wasn’t that impressive anyway, and completely ignored footwork or even dodging; he’d even witnessed one green robed wizard completely stuff up his aim and set his compatriot on fire.</p><p>However, it wasn’t the fighting that was his direct problem.  It was how he was going to help so many people at once that all clearly needed some level of swift treatment.  Seeing another two red robed fighters go down, Harry threw aside the notion of a well thought out plan and opted for a more instinctive strategic approach.</p><p>Seeing that the nearest fallen was only a few metres ahead of him, Harry pointed his wand at the man and focused.</p><p>“<em>Corium.”</em></p><p>Harry instantly saw the spells successful application when his target shimmered briefly like sunlight on water, a textbook response as his notice-me-not spell took hold.  With the fighters occupied amongst themselves Harry cast a levitation spell and brought the now disillusioned fighter towards him.  He instantly started panicking as he noticed blood continuously pouring out of the man leaving a bright red trail in his wake.  Putting a burst of speed on the charm Harry quickly brought the man in front of him.</p><p>The man, who barely looked old enough to have finished Hogwarts, was unconscious with a massive gash on the side of his neck.  Knowing he needed to fix that up first, Harry knelt down to the man and pointed his wand at the bloody injury.</p><p><em>“…vulnera sanentur…vulnera sanentur…vulnera sanentur…”</em>  Harry chanted moving his wand in a circle over the injury and watching closely as the neck wound started to close up. </p><p>After the wound was finished healing Harry cast a diagnosis charm over his patient and was happy to see that, other than his blood and energy levels being a bit low, he was fine and was out of immediate danger.  Normally Harry would administer a Blood-Replenishing Potion next but as a bright purple spell flew just over his right shoulder he knew he’d have to find cover first; people might not be able to target him, or his patient, while under a disillusionment charm but stray spell could be a problem.</p><p>Seeing a boarded up shop to his left Harry quickly waved his wand and checked the outside of any harmful spells.  He sighed in relief when his spell responded negatively and assumed that the building was probably abandoned by its previous owner; who, unlike the other building owners in Diagon Alley hadn’t warded his building against intruders.  Again with a half-assed plan in mind, and not bothering to thank his luck, Harry tightened his hand on his wand, got up and made a dash to the building. </p><p>“<em>Evanesco!”  </em>Harry said vanishing the door with a flick of his wrist. </p><p>Once safely inside Harry immediately turned around and recast the levitation spell on his unconscious patient to bring him inside where he placed him gently down on the ground by the boarded up window at the front of the shop. </p><p>Casting the lumos charm Harry quickly surveyed the shop and noted that other than an empty counter the room was completely bare.  Feeling secure that the room would suffice for now as a safe haven for his patients Harry turned around to the front of the store with his wand in hand.</p><p><em>‘The room may be safe for now but I need to make sure that it stays safe.  Protect the building and its occupants from unwanted guests.’  </em>Harry thought to himself as he raised his wand.</p><p><em>“Salvio Hexia…Repello Inimicum…Protego Maxima…Fianto Duri…Salvio Hexia…Repello Inimicum…Protego Maxima…Fianto Duri…”  </em>Harry chanted as he swirled his wand around the front of the store, a soft smile on his face as he fondly remembered a bushy haired witch teaching him such protections during the war.</p><p>A beam of silver magic shot out of his wand and slowly crept across the door and window, sparking with a bright blue light every time it touched a piece of wood or stray piece of glass. </p><p>Once the spell was complete Harry didn’t give himself a moment to take a breath before he launched himself out of the shop turned Hospital Wing and into the battle once more.  Harry groaned as he noticed even more people had joined the fight since he last looked, reinforcements from all three sides, and the collection of bodies lying around the space had doubled.</p><p>“Bloody hell…”  Harry muttered in defeat as he started mentally taking note of just how much work lay ahead of him.</p><p>Without seeing many other options Harry started.  Using the same method as he had with the first victim Harry started disillusioning fallen fighters and levitating them back into the shop.  Harry knew that he could’ve save everyone but he wanted to try.  By the time he’d collected seven fighters Harry returned to the safety of the store and got to work.</p><p>Not really having time to start transfiguring comfortable furniture as the injured required his immediate attention, not to mention they growing numbers of them back in the fight, Harry placed the seven he just rescued around the room. </p><p>The first treatment he gave all of his patients was to be placed under a sleeping spell as he didn’t want them to suffer or awaken and distract him.  Quickly Harry got to work diagnosing the new seven.  The first four were covered in blood from an assortment of vicious curses, two of them had been the victims of organ banishing curses but it was the last one that Harry knew would need to be treated first.</p><p>Her heart-shaped face was ashen and covered in dark purple bruises, her left arm was nothing more than a stump and all of the bones in her chest were shattered.  Whoever had attacked this woman hadn’t bothered going easy on her.  While each of her injuries were bad Harry was more concerned with the blood starting to pool under her body; he hadn’t noticed it at first until he did the diagnosis charm but it seemed that her maroon robes were hiding more injuries from him.</p><p>Not wanting her to bleed out Harry recast his earlier healing spell, but this time over her entire body, as he got to work figuring out how to best treat her.  Her blood loss could be fixed by a Blood Replenishing Potion which would in turn also fix her pasty complexion; something that he knew would be a similar and a repeating diagnosis for every fighter.  Regrowing limbs was a painful and time consuming procedure but as the remains of her arm weren’t suffering from troubling curses it could be done.  Unfortunately, her shattered ribs would have to be banished and regrown as they were too far gone for spell work.  However, he was happy that while she would need to be monitored she would definitely survive.</p><p>Opening his bag Harry quickly withdrew three vials Blood-Replenishing Potion before banishing the bright red liquid into brunette’s system.  Within seconds her complexion cleared and Harry cast a bone-mending charm on her ribs.  Even though the ribs were too far gone and would need to be regrown, his spell healed them enough that she could breathe normally until he had the time to heal her properly.  Standing up Harry smiled in contentment at the sleeping figure before him. </p><p>
  <strong>BANG!</strong>
</p><p>Harry flinched as the massive explosion shook his safe house causing dust to drift down from the rafters and the screams from outside to intensify. </p><p>Forcing himself to focus Harry continued around the room, casting counter-curses, using what potions he had on hand and continually checking vitals until he was happy that they were all resting peacefully.  Most of the patients would need follow up or long treatment plans but for now they were okay.</p><p>Standing up by the last patient Harry could feel how tired his body was after expelling so much magic in such a short amount of time.  It was an annoying fact that healers had to take more care of their own states during healing as their field of expertise could drain them of energy and magic faster than an auror in a fight. </p><p>Having heard the fighting still carrying on outside Harry knew that more people would need his help.  He understood why healers were hesitant to run into a battle but he really wished that someone was helping him care for the wounded.  Where were the healers of this world?  Surely someone would’ve summoned one to help.</p><p>He’d just made it to the door of the store when a shadow feel over Diagon Alley and the glass of the shops iced over.  As the fragments of Harry’s energy levels plummeted and his outlook turned bleak a scream echoed from the street outside. </p><p>“Dementors!”  A voice bellowed in obvious panic.  “He sent the Dementors! <strong>Run!</strong>”</p><p>Pushing away the depressing aura that was pushing away any positivity still clinging to him, Harry shoved his hand into the bag over his shoulder and rummaged around until he found a green potion.    With no time to lose Harry down the Wiggenweld Potion and darted outside into the street.</p><p>Glancing around Harry paled as he saw that all the fighters had fled the street for safety and had left their injured fellows on the ground.  What was more concerning was that covering over the scene was a swarm of at least twenty Dementors.  Slowly the horde of swirling cloaks of death started descending on the scene and right for the unconscious forms littering the pavement. </p><p>Without giving it a second thought Harry darted forward a few steps and cleared his mind.  Harry quickly conjured up memories of his parents, Sirius, Ron and Hermione, the DA and Malfoy’s face when Hermione had punched him. </p><p>As he tried to focus his eyes watched in panic as three Dementors pulled away from the pack and hovered mere inches from their first victims. </p><p>Harry let the memories blanket him in warmth and fill him up before thrusting his wand forward, brandishing his wand like a knight would a sword, and shouted.</p><p>“<em>Expecto Patronum!”</em></p><p>Silver light shot from his wand as Prongs burst into existence before him and galloped into the middle of the alley, where the injured lay, and started goring nearby Dementors with his antlers.  Harry could hear the ear-wrenching screams of the unholy beings as Prongs charged and protected them but Harry didn’t stop.  Despite his effectiveness Harry knew that Prongs couldn’t keep fighting them forever, and as none of the fleeing fighters were helping him, he knew that they were alone in this fight. </p><p>Harry held his wand tighter in his hand as he felt his strength start leaving him as he continued the spell, pouring more and more of his magic into it to strengthening the spell.  He’d never continuously held the Patronus spell for so long, normally only requiring a simple cast, but Harry was pleased to see that his efforts weren’t in vain.  With each second that went by Prongs grew stronger and started glowing brighter until silver light permeated every corner of the alley from the now white stag and kept the hovering Dementors above their heads at bay. </p><p>Finally, after what felt like hours the Dementors gave up their attack and fled as Prongs charged at the dwindling dawdlers until the alley was safe once more.  Harry quickly dropped his wand and fell to his knees as he struggled to catch his breath.  He’d only managed to take a few grateful gasps of air when an angry voice rung out.</p><p>“Potter!”</p><p>Slowly Harry looked up from his place on the ground to see a tall angry wizard striding towards him with his wand out.  Even in his exhausted state Harry was able to identify this wizard as not many carried a large black cane and had hair so blonde it was practically white.</p><p>Knowing that in this world Lucius Malfoy would unlikely be an ally Harry lifted his wand, ignoring the aching in his arm as it protested his movement, and readied himself for a duel.  However, before Lucius was close enough or had thought to start casting, probably thinking him an easy target in his current state, the sound of galloping filled the tense air.  Looking around Harry saw that Prongs hadn’t disappeared yet and was now charging forward with its silvery eyes fixed tightly on Lucius. </p><p>Before Lucius could react Prongs had gored the backside of the Head of the Malfoy family with its antlers and a corresponding woman’s scream of pain filled the air.  Harry couldn’t help but snort in amusement as Lucius lay in a heap on the ground with Prongs standing threateningly over his cowering form. </p><p>After a few minutes Prongs huffed dismissively at Malfoy before spinning around and trotting happily over to Harry.  Unable to not smile at his patronus Harry reached out and patted the silvery animal’s side.  However, the second his hand made contact a shot of power flooded him not unlike the time Dudley made him stick a fork in the toaster socket except this time he was inundated with raw magic. </p><p>Feeling much better Harry had just enough time to drag himself to his feet and thank Prongs before the stag vanished from sight.</p><p>Now that the Dementors and patronus were gone Harry could see that only a handful of wizards and witches were left but, unsurprisingly, none of them were Deatheaters.  Harry guessed that they all fled when the Dementors arrived, an additional attack on Diagon Alley probably thanks to their master.  Remembering that he had more to finish today before he could find somewhere safe to rest Harry started towards a nearby body. </p><p>The man looked to be in his fifties with a large bulbous nose and short greying red hair.  Harry wasn’t sure what it was exactly but something about this man was needling him, like his subconscious was trying to tell him something.  In the end Harry pushed his thoughts to the side again and reminded himself that he was here as a healer not to gawk at injured wizards.</p><p>With his wand in hand Harry quickly cast the diagnosis charm on the still form at his feet and groaned in pity at the results.  The man had severe burns across his face, every bone from his waist down was broken, there was a minor curse on his lungs and he was suffering from the beginning stages of Dragon Pox.</p><p>“Poor bastard.”  Harry muttered as he started healing the man.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p align="center">Sirius Black</p><p align="center"> </p><p>Sirius was many things, depending on who you asked, but he had never considered himself a coward.  Yet, as he sat in the side alley, hiding from Dementors, he had never felt worse about himself.  He was a member of the noble Order of the Phoenix.  He wasn’t meant to be hiding.  He was meant to be defeating dark wizards and saving damsels in distress.</p><p>The attack on Diagon Alley had caught them all unaware and when he’d been called in with the cavalry the Order and Ministry had already taken massive hits from the Deatheaters.  They’d only just started making progress in their fight when the Dementors descended.  With no real defence against such creatures Sirius had reluctantly allowed Remus and Alastor Moody to drag him behind a nearby shop for cover.</p><p>Sirius felt sick as he watched the Dementors circling the injured and unconscious bodies in the alley like vultures.  With no form of defence or offence to battle those bloody creatures and the anti-apparition wards holding over the entire area, Sirius ground his teeth in frustration as he realised that he was going to be forced to watch Dementors feed.</p><p>“We gotta do <strong><em>something</em></strong><em>.”  </em>Sirius whispered to his companions as other members of the Order sort shelter in their hiding place.</p><p>“We can’t.”  Remus replied heavily.  “We can’t even escape the same way we got here.  The portkeys’ timers won’t reactivate for another thirty minutes.”</p><p>Sirius didn’t like his friend sounding so depressed but he certainly understood.  The only thing they’d do by running out there would be to die with the others.  They had to survive for the war effort and sacrificing themselves for no reason to Dementors wouldn’t help anyone.  Sirius might hate it but their only option was to stay put and hope that the Dementors didn’t sense them.</p><p>Seeing the Dementors get closer and closer, Sirius shut his eyes not wanting to see what came next.  It is said to be impossible to stomach watching a Dementors’ Kiss and he wasn’t inclined to test that theory.  However, just as things were looking bleak a tenor voice called out.</p><p>
  <em>“Expecto Patronum!”</em>
</p><p>Sirius could only watch in awe as a young man appeared from thin air, standing strong and determined against the Dementors, as he sent his fully corporeal patronus against the horde of Dementors.  It was truly awe-inspiring to see a fully formed patronus in the flesh as the only wizard he knew that could cast it perfectly was Dumbledore, and the man wasn’t usually casting it for a party trick.</p><p>“What the…?” </p><p>Sirius hid his own shock behind a smirk that he directed to the wizard to his left.  “Everything okay there, Moody?”</p><p>“Shut up, Black.”  The man muttered darkly.</p><p>Sirius’ smirk only widened at the reply.  It was open knowledge in the Order that Alastor Moody, expert dueller, had been working on the Patronus spell for years with little success.  Although Sirius could sympathize as nobody else could perform it either he couldn’t help pushing the wizard’s buttons.  Sirius didn’t know why they bothered trying anymore though as the spell needed to be fuelled with positivity and happy memories, unfortunately, both of which were rather hard to come by in wartime.</p><p>The trio continued watching as the unknown wizard finished fighting off the Dementors single handedly before falling to his knees.  Sirius laughed loudly as the stag patronus flew after Malfoy and gored him with its antlers before fading away.  The moment the patronus completely vanished Sirius could actually feel the difference such a spell made as his earlier amusement and happiness faded back to normal levels.  It was one thing to read about the Patronus Charm but it was something else to feel its effects.  </p><p>With the threat gone, and by the looks of it their enemies, Sirius started moving out of his hiding place only to be held back by a concerned looking Remus.</p><p>“Don’t, Sirius.”  Remus whispered as his amber eyes locked tightly on their savior.  “We don’t know anything about him.”</p><p>Sirius tuned out his friend and their grumpy companion as Moody and Remus started working out logistics in favour of watching the wizard standing alone in the alley.  There was something about him that seemed so familiar to Sirius.  He’d been startled when Lucius had called him Potter, but as the only ones alive were safely back at Hogwarts he assumed that he blonde bastard was wrong.  He wished he was standing in a better spot as the only details he could make out were the stranger’s dark shaggy hair.</p><p>“What do you think, Sirius?”  Remus asked as the unknown wizard started walking up to a fallen Order member.</p><p>“Huh?”  He replied looking between the two wizards who were now too busy frowning at the sight in front of them to reiterate their question.</p><p>The lad had gathered himself up and walked over to a nearby Order member.  The alley seemed to be holding their breath as the impressive wizard before them started waving his wand over the Order member with a look of concentration on his face.</p><p>“What’s he doing to Fabian?”  Moody asked tensely. </p><p>The moment he asked the question their fears were realised as one half of the infamous Prewett twins vanished into thin air.  As the unknown wizard started walking back up the alley Moody turned to them. </p><p>“Remus, I want you to help those Ministry fools and take down the anti-apparition wards around the alley.”  The grizzled war veteran demanded before turning his eyes to Sirius.  “And you…I want you on clean up duty, gather our injured and take them back to the Hospital Wing.”</p><p>“What about you?”  Sirius asked as Remus sprang into action and ran out of their hiding place with a few Order members at his side.</p><p>“I’m going to catch me an unknown.”</p><p>Sirius watched the older wizard stride out into the street and point his wand at their saviour’s back.</p><p>“<em>Stupefy!”</em></p><p>
