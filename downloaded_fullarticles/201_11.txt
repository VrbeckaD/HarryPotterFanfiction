    <p align="justify">Harry didn’t know why he did it. It seemed natural. There was nothing odd about it. But he didn’t know why he did it. He didn’t know why his brain described Cedric Diggory as an extremely handsome boy. None of the boys he knew would describe him like that. Not out loud at least. But it was true, wasn’t it? Why even think about it? That’s right, there’s nothing about it, he can think about everyone the way he wants. Hermione was his friend and he thought she was pretty, or Ron wasn’t bad looking either, the combination of ginger and freckles, that all the Weasleys possessed, was in fact quite cute when Harry thought about it. Even Draco Malfoy would be good looking if he didn’t sneer so much and wasn’t such a git. So yes, Harry decided, he can describe Cedric Diggory as an extremely handsome boy and it’s okay. Of course, he is not going to say it out loud. That would be weird.</p><p align="justify">Harry was so deep in his thoughts that he didn’t almost register Amos Diggory talking about Cedric beating Harry in Quidditch. Cedric looked very embarrassed at that.</p><p align="justify">“Harry fell off his broom, Dad,” he muttered. “I told you ... it was an accident ...”</p><p align="justify">Harry looked at Cedric and smiled at him shyly while Amos Diggory kept talking. Cedric also sent Harry a small smile. And then they were gathered by the portkey and were instantly gone. They said goodbye to the Diggorys at the camp and then Harry had completely different worries.</p><p align="justify">...</p><p align="justify">Harry was certainly glad to be at Hogwarts again. How come that every time his life gives him something nice to enjoy, it also gives him a massive amount of troubles? To say that Harry wasn’t worried after the Quidditch World Cup would be a lie. Harry was extremely worried and stressed. Not only about the events of the World Cup but also about his recurring dream. But he didn’t want to seem weak or some kind of a coward so he never really voiced his worries to his friends. He let Hermione worry for him, she was good at that. Constantly reminding him what else he should be worried about. Harry knew she meant well so he just always nodded along, assuring her that he’ll be careful and that everything is going to be fine. But he was almost definitely sure that nothing is going to be fine.</p><p align="justify">After the sorting and dinner, Dumbledore started his usual announcements. To Harry’s dismay, one of the announcements was the cancellation of this year’s Quidditch Cup. That dampened Harry’s mood even more. He was sure if Oliver Wood was still in Hogwarts he would faint on the spot. Then Dumbledore introduced the new DADA professor, Mad-Eye Moddy, who gave Harry the creeps. But one had to be a bit odd to be a DADA professor. Then there was another announcement about the Triwizard Tournament that was about to take place in Hogwarts this year. That piqued Harry’s interest. It sounded very exciting. Everyone was really intrigued, the Weasley twins already saying the will enter, only to be shut down by the age restriction. Harry was a bit disappointed at first but then he was actually relieved. With all this stress and worries he had, worrying about the Triwizard Tournament on top of that was not a fun idea. And with his luck, he would definitely be picked if he tried to enter. Maybe this will actually give him a nice and quiet year for a change.</p><p align="justify">On their way out of the Great Hall, the twins were in a heated discussion about how to walk around the age restriction rule. Hermione kept reminding them how dangerous the Tournament actually is and saying that they should respect the rules but Ron was also on the side of the twins. Harry just smiled to himself, not really looking where he was going and staying behind his friends when someone bumped into his shoulder.</p><p align="justify">“Oops, sorry,” Harry looked up only to see Cedric Diggory giving him a shy smile.</p><p align="justify">“No, it was my bad, sorry,” Cedric apologized. “Are you okay?”</p><p align="justify">“Erm, yeah, you just bumped into me, it’s nothing.”</p><p align="justify">“No, I meant, I haven’t had the chance to talk to any of you after the World Cup and Dad said you were there when the Dark Mark was created.”</p><p align="justify">“Er, yeah, no, I’m okay,” said Harry nervously.</p><p align="justify">“I wanted to write you and the Weasleys a letter to make sure but then I got too shy because we don’t really know each other that well,” continued Cedric.</p><p align="justify">“Yeah, I suppose,” Harry shrugged. “So are you thinking of entering the Tournament?” he tried to change the conversation.</p><p align="justify">“Yeah, I think so. I mean, I know my dad wants me to, so I probably will, but I probably won’t get chosen anyway,” Cedric smiled.</p><p align="justify">“You never know, I guess,” Harry said. “I’m going this way now,” he motioned to the staircase that went up.</p><p align="justify">“Oh yes, I’m sorry. Well, good night, Harry,” Cedric said. “I’m glad you’re okay.”</p><p align="justify">“Thanks, goodnight.”</p><p align="justify">And with that, they parted ways. Harry climbed the stairs and caught up with his friends that were still discussing the Tournament. Maybe, Harry thought, what made Cedric Diggory an extremely handsome boy was not his good looks but his kindness and good manners.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Harry didn’t talk to Cedric again, which wasn’t anything unusual. They had different social circles so to speak. Cedric was a Hufflepuff and he was older than him so there wasn’t really much chance of them running into each other. Harry didn’t even think about it that much. He tried to focus on school which made Hermione really proud of him and Ron bit annoyed with him.</p><p align="justify">Mad-Eye Moody turned out to be true to his name. He was mad and he was moody. Harry wasn’t sure if he liked him yet because he was still giving him the creeps. Plus he seemed very interested in Harry, always looking at him, which Harry was quite used to from people by this time but still didn’t enjoy very much. Meanwhile, Hermione started S.P.E.W. and wouldn’t shut up about it. As honorable as her intentions were Harry didn’t care that much. He imagined Dobby being thrilled by the idea of S.P.E.W. but the whole thing wouldn’t probably excite that many people. Wizards didn’t really seem to care about other creatures and Harry didn’t think that would change. Even if Hermione was very stubborn and persistent.</p><p align="justify">September quickly rolled into October and the students from the other schools finally arrived. Amongst them none other than the very famous Viktor Krum, which made Ron well excited. Harry thought to himself that Ron was suspiciously overly excited. But Harry wasn’t going to judge. Then came the Beauxbatons students and Ron got even more excited, fawning over the girls. Harry didn’t really understand. Should he be feeling like that too? Or was Ron just going through something of his own? Hermione didn’t act any different at least so maybe Harry was fine.</p><p align="justify">“Are you okay, Harry?” asked Hermione when they were walking back to their dormitory.</p><p align="justify">“What? Yeah, just thinking,” he said.</p><p align="justify">“Are you thinking about Cho Chang? You kept looking at her. She is quite pretty, but not like that girl from Beauxbatons. But for Hogwarts girl, she is okay,” babbled Ron.</p><p align="justify">“Honestly, Ronald, can you think about something else than that?” Hermione said annoyed.</p><p align="justify">“Sure. I’m thinking about how I can sneak to see Viktor Krum and get his autograph.”</p><p align="justify">“Which is really the same thing,” said Hermione.</p><p align="justify">Ron didn’t say anything at that and just looked confused. Harry thought about if he really kept looking at Cho Chang. He honestly couldn’t remember. Maybe he looked in her direction and just spaced out. He kept doing that a lot.</p><p align="justify">“Honestly, Harry, are you okay?” asked Hermione again. Apparently, she was talking to him before and he didn’t register.</p><p align="justify">“Hm? Yeah. I mean, should I be looking at Cho Chang?”</p><p align="justify">“You fancy her, don’t you,” Ron nudged him.</p><p align="justify">“I don’t know. Should I? I guess she is pretty. But I don’t really know her so I can’t know if I like her.”</p><p align="justify">“You can like someone without knowing them,” Ron said.</p><p align="justify">“I mean I can like how someone’s looks but I can’t like-like them if I don’t know them,” Harry argued.</p><p align="justify">“Sure you can,” Ron shrugged.</p><p align="justify">“Just because you can Ronald, doesn’t mean Harry can,” Hermione said sharply. “I think it’s better that way anyway, to like someone after you talk to them and get to know them.”</p><p align="justify">“Maybe. But the only girl you ever talk to is Hermione, Harry. And maybe Ginny. So maybe you should try to talk to Cho Chang.”</p><p align="justify">“I haven’t really thought about it,” Harry shrugged.</p><p align="justify">“That’s good, Harry. At least you can focus on school, which is actually much more important,” Hermione said and glared at Ron. “And you will have time to help me with S.P.E.W.!”</p><p align="justify">“So if I like someone I don’t have to help, right?” asked Ron and Hermione just rolled her eyes.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">At dinner, the next day, everyone was ready to see who gets to be picked by the Goblet of Fire. All of the Gryffindors were rooting for Angelina and Harry did too. But he did admit to himself that he wouldn’t mind if Cedric Diggory was the champion.</p><p align="justify">The Durmstrang champion turned out to be Viktor Krum, which made Ron ecstatic. The Beauxbatons champion was Fleur Delacour, who turned out to be the girl Ron was fawning over the most. That made Ron even more ecstatic. And then the Hogwarts champion turned out to be – Cedric Diggory! That made Ron very unhappy but Harry just smiled and was actually glad for Cedric. This seemed like it would be a very interesting tournament indeed.</p><p align="justify">But before Harry could enjoy the excitement any longer, a long flame shot suddenly from the Goblet of Fire. Another piece of parchment flew out and Dumbledore seized it. <em>Please, no, </em>Harry thought to himself, getting a feeling that this would be very bad. And then Dumbledore cleared his throat and said – “Harry Potter”. And Harry felt like he died on that exact spot he was sitting on.</p><p align="justify">Everyone was looking at him and it was terrible. Harry wanted to throw up, or run away, or jump out of the Astronomy Tower. And then suddenly he was on his feet and Dumbledore motioned to him to go through the door as all the other champions did but no one said anything else. <em>Why is no one saying anything? </em>Harry thought. <em>They must know it’s a mistake.</em></p><p align="justify">And then suddenly he was in the room with the other champions and they were all looking at him like he was some kind of lost child separated from his mom. Then people kept talking but Harry couldn’t hear anything. He was shaking and all the attention was on him but no one really paid any attention to him, which was a very weird feeling. Then Dumbledore asked him if he did put his name in the Goblet or asked anyone to do it for him and Harry said the truth – that he didn’t. It was the first time he heard himself speak afterward and his voice seemed distant to him, almost foreign. And then everyone kept talking and it was decided that Harry must compete. Harry didn’t understand why he had to. He didn’t want to and no one else wanted him to. Someone probably wanted him to die in the Tournament so maybe he should just go ahead and do it himself to avoid all of that. But before he could think it out any further Dumbledore sent them off to their dormitories and Harry and Cedric left together.</p><p align="justify">“So,” said Cedric, with a slight smile. “We’re playing against each other again!”</p><p align="justify">“I s’pose,” said Harry. He was still shaking. He wanted to throw up and cry at the same time. He was scared Cedric hated him like the rest of the school will. Then Cedric’s hand was on his shoulder and Harry realized he was talking to him again.</p><p align="justify">“I believe you,” said Cedric. “I believe you didn’t put your name there.”</p><p align="justify">“You do?”</p><p align="justify">“Yes, I mean it’s obvious from just looking at your reaction,” Cedric smiled but then he frowned. “Harry, you’re shaking.”</p><p align="justify">“I,” mumbled Harry but before he could finish, Cedric took him by his hand and led him to the kitchens.</p><p align="justify">“Come on, you need to calm down a bit,” he said.</p><p align="justify">When they were inside the kitchens, only a few elves were around and they didn’t seem to mind them being there. They seemed to know Cedric quite well in fact. Cedric sat Harry down by the fireplace and sat next to him while one of the elves brought them each a cup of tea.</p><p align="justify">“I’m sorry,” Harry said finally.</p><p align="justify">“What for?”</p><p align="justify">“For being in the Tournament. Everyone was so happy you were chosen and then I just ruined it by being me.”</p><p align="justify">“It’s not your fault,” said Cedric. “And you didn’t ruin anything.”</p><p align="justify">Harry took a sip of his tea, which calmed his nausea a bit. He still felt like crying though but forbid himself to cry in front of Cedric.</p><p align="justify">“The only thing I don’t understand is why you have to compete.”</p><p align="justify">Harry just shrugged and drank his tea in silence. When they finished the tea, Harry felt a bit calmer.</p><p align="justify">“Thank you,” said Harry.</p><p align="justify">“What for?” Cedric repeated his earlier question.</p><p align="justify">“For being nice to me. And believing me.”</p><p align="justify">“Of course,” smiled Cedric. “I know we don’t know each other that much, Harry, but if you need anything, you can come to me. I guess it’s going to be hard for you now and don’t feel like you can’t talk to me just because we’re supposed to compete with each other.”</p><p align="justify">Harry was quiet for a while and then just nodded. “Thanks, Cedric,” he mumbled.</p><p align="justify">“Look at me, Harry,” Cedric said and Harry looked at him reluctantly. “I don’t hate you, okay?”</p><p align="justify">“Okay, thanks,” Harry smiled.</p><p align="justify">“And stop being thankful for someone being a decent human being to you.”</p><p align="justify">“Okay, thanks,” Harry chuckled a bit.</p><p align="justify">“Come on, it’s late. Let’s get you to bed.”</p><p align="justify">Harry protested to Cedric walking him to his dormitory but Cedric insisted, pulling out the prefect card. Harry wasn’t shaking anymore or didn’t feel nauseous. In fact, he felt much calmer. When they reached the Fat Lady portrait Harry thanked Cedric again and Cedric just squeezed his shoulder and smiled.</p><p align="justify">“Get some sleep, Harry. Goodnight.”</p><p align="justify">“Goodnight.”</p><p align="justify">With that, Harry climbed through the portrait hole into his common room. When he got in, he was greeted by applauding Gryffindor house. Everyone kept asking him questions but no one really wanted to hear the truth. So Harry, with much difficulty, went off to bed. To his great dismay, Ron didn’t believe him either and after their argument, Harry felt a bit nauseous again. He fell to his bed thinking that Ron will just need a bit of time to believe him and that he will try to reason with him tomorrow.</p><p align="justify">So it was not going to be a quiet year after all. </p>
