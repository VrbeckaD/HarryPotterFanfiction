  <em>Listen, I never wanted any of this.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I was a young boy who never dreamt of becoming the world's most powerful, most lusted after man. I never wanted to fight. I never wanted to lead. Sure, some of you think it's the sole reason I was born for — to defeat the Dark Lord, to oppose the forces of darkness — but I'm afraid I'm about to disagree vehemently.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>You were so very brave, the poor, faded shell of my mother told me. She forgot to mention how afraid I had been, how impulsive, how naive. Of course, I later understood what Dumbledore did — the people I saw were not my parents, were neither my godfather nor my mentor. They had been there to press me into accepting my death, to tell me what I wanted to hear in order to seal my last sacrifice, to carry out Dumbledore's preciously calculated plans.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I'm tired of fighting. I'm so, so very tired. And yet, when I look into Ron's and Hermione's gentle eyes, I know it's what I would do in a heartbeat to keep them safe — what we three would undoubtedly do. We had accomplished so much together, we've gotten so far .. They proclaimed us heroes, even as we scattered like rats in our apartments, hiding from the world in a vain attempt at forgetting .. They disregarded the deaths, said it was normal in times of war, that it was to be expected .. We were children, how could we have known? How could we have prevented it ? We were thrust into war, and once it truly, truly ends .. for it still hasn't, no matter what lies the Ministry spurs, what strong image they wish to project ..</em>
</p><p>
  <em> Once it truly ends .. What will we become ? Who will we become ?</em>
</p><p>
  <em>It’s funny, how even now adults never helped. Never wanted to .. were always so comfortable letting us take the blame, take the responsibility, making the changes. It was them — them who should have stood proudly against Lord Voldemort, them who should have hunted the horcruxes, them who should have fought for their very lives! Not their children, never us. How could we not have seen how manipulated we had been ? Ah, but of course .. A task given to us by the man we practically worshiped .. Merlin's reincarnation, had once said Ron. Have faith in Dumbledore, had always been Hermione's words. He was a war hero, the leader we all wanted to follow, a calming presence like no other ..</em>
</p><p>
  <em>An honor, it was, to be seen delivering Dumbledore's orders. It made us puff our chests, and pride ourselves for being trusted. And on top of that, Dumbledore gave us the ultimate secret, the one that would bring Voldemort to his knees. His last choices, his latest wishes, had been for us to continue what he started. It was the icing on the cake, I believe. Whatever suspicion we had about him seemed to have entirely disappeared after that token of trust.</em>
</p><p><em>What did he start</em> <em>, you would ask. You guys did all the job, you would say. What did he do if not create more problems for silly dropout of school teenagers ? The horcruxes we found could have easily been gathered by a man whose vast circle of intelligence, friends and allies had been unmatched, no?</em></p><p>
  <em>Well — refusing him never crossed our minds, not even once, for making him proud and pay tribute had been ever so important to us. I hope you wouldn’t judge us so harshly — this is, after all, Dumbledore we're talking about! The man, the myth; the legend.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>And besides, I did love him. Even now, when contemplating how deceitful he has been, and how blind I have been — I love him. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Ah, but yes, he has always been manipulative, of that I am sure — and it is amusing to discover that I have always had an inkling suspicion about it .. but I never thought that it would be to that extent at least — it hurted, to discover that he was set to die, and to have never known about it. But he knew me, so very well — well enough to predict that I would blame myself for his death, especially after our last little adventure, and how set I would be on avenging him ..</em>
</p><p><em>I</em> <em>truly, truly thought that I was in his debt — he wanted me to delude myself with these thoughts, so that I would never find the urge to renounce the fight. The fight I believed was my legacy. </em></p><p>
  <em>And yet, all this time, he had been controlling me, feeding my insecurities .. I should have realized .. I should have suspected .. For who sends one to war so untrained, as Dumbledore did me? </em>
</p><p>
  <em>I was shocked, I assure you. I still am. I don't think there would ever be a time where I wouldn't be. Sirius, dead, because I did not - would not listen. Cedric, dead, protecting me. My parents..</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Snape .. was a bully. He might have had some good in him, but he had been an awful, petty, cruel human being. So horrible, in fact, that even now I cannot think of him without biting down a grimace. He had joined the Death Eaters in spite of his feelings for the muggle-borns they targeted — for my mom — and it was only her apparent death — which, again, was partly his fault, by the way — that had him work for the Light.</em>
</p><p><em>Dumbledore used to say that he kept me alive — he used to say a lot of rubbish, now that I think about it. And while I am forever thankful not to have met my end in that Quidditch pitch, that sunny day years ago, for he had bought Hermione and Ron some precious time to distract Quirrel, </em> <em>I would never forget that it was his duty to do so — his duty to protect the children in his care, as a Professor — and Snape did nothing of that, not really.</em></p><p>He shook his head, still in daze, and a voice snapped him out of his stupor. Ron's smile was brilliant and warm. It always was.</p><p>"All right there, mate?"</p><p>He nodded. "Yeah. You don't have to worry about it. I - I got this."</p><p>"Not worrying," Ron laughed. "That must be fun."</p><p>"There is no time for jokes, boys," Hermione said quickly. "I wrote the runes. The spell is in march, and with Ron's strengthening the wards' hold .. Harry, it's on you now."</p><p>Harry blinked, surprised. "My turn already? I thought Ron—"</p><p>"Harry," she warned him, "I know what you're trying to do. It won't work."</p><p>"Felt I should try all the same," he murmured. "I don't think it's a good idea."</p><p>"It's really not," said Ron. "After all, it's <em>your</em> idea."</p><p>He glared at him. "And Hermione came up with the plan."</p><p>She smiled. "We all did our part."</p><p>"The plan was that I, and I <em>alone</em> would —"</p><p>"You're not leaving us behind," interrupted Ron firmly, his blue glinting with determination and concern. Harry wanted to whisk his worry away. "You're not buying yourself time to go back alone-"</p><p>"Was that a pun?"</p><p>Ron frowned at him. "That was certainly not one."</p><p>"Definitely a pun," Hermione agreed.</p><p>"We're in this together," said Ron softly, not bothering looking up at their grinning faces. <em>Whenever you utter a pun, Ronald, just like you did now, </em>had said Hermione slyly, a few days ago, <em>you will buy — or better, cook us dinner.</em></p><p><em>For how long, </em>he had despaired. </p><p>
  <em>A week.</em>
</p><p>The week in question had only just begun. </p><p>"We are," said Hermione, taking both their hands in hers. "We're not leaving you."</p><p>Harry stopped tapping his feet. His grin flattered slightly, "I always wanted a family," he told them quietly, "I - I thought it was one of the silly things people wished for - the ones that never come true."</p><p>Ron's lips twitched. He shared a fond stare with Hermione. "And now?"</p><p>"I have everything I ever wanted," Harry said. "I'm sorry."</p><p>"No," said Ron, tightening his hold on his hand. "Don't be. We wouldn't change a thing if we got the chance."</p><p>Hermione snorted in amusement.</p><p>"Well, <em>obviously</em>," he looked at Hermione somewhat sheepishly, "we're time travelling to alter events. But what I meant was - er - I don't know what my life would be without the two of you."</p><p>"Hum," said Harry, looking flattered. "Go on."</p><p>Ron rolled his eyes. "What I'm trying to say is that, if there is one thing I'm sure of —"</p><p>"So it's only one thing now," muttered Hermione, shaking her head. "I thought you were so sure the Chudley Cannons will win this season’s cup—"</p><p>"<em>Is that</em>," continued Ron forcefully, "we're supposed to be together."</p><p>"Always and forever," promised Hermione softly.</p><p>Harry chuckled, and nodded. He tossed his head back and looked at the ceiling. He had painted it himself. If he had known they wouldn’t be staying here for long, he would have had Kreature do the dirty work. </p><p>Hermione sent him a pointed stare and tightened her hold on his arm. He sighed — and started muttering the odd chants she had forced him to learn in order to complete this 'journey' of theirs, as well as to make it the safest possible.</p><p>He felt like an idiot. And was sure he looked like one, too. Ron must have thought the same, because he could hear him sniffling his laughter, the moron. </p><p>Then he went still, feeling his vibrant magic in the air. He smiled at them.</p><p>"I love you guys."</p><p>And in a blink of an eye, the three of them were gone, as if they had never existed. </p>
