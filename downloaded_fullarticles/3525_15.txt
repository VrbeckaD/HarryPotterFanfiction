    <p>"You're such an idiot!" laughed Simon, as he, JJ and Ethan left greenhouse four.</p><p>"How was I meant to know that it would bite me?!" protested Ethan, still holding his finger that was earlier bitten by a Fanged Geranium.</p><p>"Well, it's pretty obvious. It has teeth. You put your finger near the teeth. Need I say any more?" Simon answered Ethan sarcastically.</p><p>"And I thought I was stupid..." JJ chimed in, resulting in Ethan lightly punching both him and Simon, annoyed yet clearly finding the whole thing as funny as they were. The three of them continued to walk from Herbology back to their usual spot outside, soon where the others would join them.</p><p> </p><p>Although the October air was freezing cold, it was nothing compared to what the dungeons felt like during potions. Tobi, Vik and Josh were thankful to finally be out of the class and making their way to meet Ethan, Harry, JJ and Simon. Yes, the dungeons were horribly cold and almost damp like, but it wasn't just that which gave most people who entered a chill go down their spine, it was also the teacher. Snape seemed to have some form of hatred towards everyone, even those in his own house, Slytherin. No one wanted to spend any more time than they had to with him, purely because of the snide, rude comments and insults he had for the majority of the students. Tobi, in particular, disliked Professor Snape. Despite Tobi's usual kind and warm nature, he was always in a worse mood after having t have a lesson with Snape.</p><p>"I just don't understand what his problem is with everyone!" Tobi said to Josh and Vik as they started walking out of the dungeons, "It wouldn't kill him to just be a little bit nice every now and then, or even just to not be mean for once!"</p><p>The others nodded with agreement, almost at the normal tree that them and the others sat near. </p><p>"Still, at least I don't have it as bad as you do Josh." Tobi added on, "I'd hate to have him as my head of house." </p><p>Tobi gave Josh a sympathetic smile as they reached Simon, JJ and Ethan, sitting down next to them. </p><p>"Hey guys!" JJ exclaimed to them, as they sat down, with a big grin on his face.</p><p>"You alright JJ?" asked Vik, seeming genuinely concerned, "You look a bit too happy; It's kinda creeping me out."</p><p>They all laughed, and JJ replied "Yeah, I'm fine, but can you guess who has done something pretty stupid yet hilarious?"</p><p>"Ethan?" they all said in unison, followed by a lot of laughter. JJ and Simon then proceeded to tell the guys what happened in Herbology, causing Vik to roll his eyes, Josh to laugh and make fun of Ethan, and Tobi, trying to hold back his laughter, saying "We're not all good at everything, ey Ethan?"</p><p>"You must have annoyed it somehow, Ethan, or else it most likely wouldn't have done that." Vik said, trying to justify why the Fanged Geranium would've bit him in the first place. </p><p>"Ethan-annoying? Surely not!" Harry said sarcastically smiling as he joined the group. </p><p>"There you are Mini-Bog, took your time haven't you?" Simon said jokingly to Harry.</p><p>"Well, you know what it's like when you're this popular and everyone wants to talk to you. Well, maybe you don't Simon." Harry answered, winking at him, "But seriously, my class were held back for a few minutes as the professor wanted to remind us how although we're fourth years and OWL's are next year we need to pay attention and 'absorb all the knowledge'. Just a load of shit to be honest."</p><p>"At least you have til' next year," Tobi said, "with all of the studying for OWL's, practising for Quidditch and trying to keep my sanity, I'd love to be back in fourth year!"</p><p>The rest of them nodded as all of them, except Harry, were in their fifth year and being pressured to do well in their OWL's coming up in summer. Although they were all stressed and worried about them, some in particular were feeling a bit too overwhelmed by it all. Vik, hands down one of the brightest wizard's in their year, was definitely a bit too nervous about it all. It wasn't like he thought he'd do bad or anything, it was just that he really wanted to prove himself that he is as clever as he hopes he is. Coming from muggle parents(and a muggle family in general), he really felt like he needed to show everyone he was capable. He isn't the only one of them who is muggle-born though, Ethan is as well yet doesn't feel as much of a pressure as Vik does, probably because Ethan's mum is incredibly supportive of him and is just so happy that he's a wizard that anything else is just another bonus of it all. Harry, Simon, JJ and Tobi are all half-bloods who all, except Harry's whose mum is a wizard and dad is a muggle, have parents who are both wizards/witches. Lastly, Josh is the only pure-blood of the group, promoting the typical stereotype that most pure-bloods are Slytherin's. Although all of the boys have different backgrounds, families, houses, etc, they are still extremely close and have remained that way throughout all of their time at Hogwarts. None of them care what any other students have to say about them (some students still think you should remain with those in your house) as they have such strong friendships that no one could ever break. </p><p>After spending quite a bit of time outside, JJ looked at his watch and told the rest of the guys that they should be heading off to the Great Hall for dinner. They all got up, looking very tired and drained from the day, and dragged themselves to the Hall, ready for the feast...</p><p> </p>
