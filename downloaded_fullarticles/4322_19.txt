</p><p align="center">“The fear of death follows from the fear of life. A man who lives fully is prepared to die at any time.” — Mark Twain</p><p align="center"> </p><p>Harry doesn’t think he can die. Everything he’s done so far has proven that.</p><p>He stared Death in the face as an infant and survived unscathed but for an insignificant scar. He spent his entire childhood with people who abused and neglected him. He confronted a troll within the first two months of studying in Hogwarts. And in the years that followed, he only continued to evade Death, always staying one step ahead because of either luck or sacrifice.</p><p>So when he gives himself up for the final time in that solemn forest and Death offers him the choice to leave or stay, it’s hardly a surprise that he chooses to live.</p><p>Evading Death is all he’s ever known.</p><p>Of course, that isn’t his smartest decision. But when he remembers that time in a ghostly white King’s Cross Station with a long-dead headmaster, he can’t help but wonder why he took so long to decide.</p><p>Because the only thing he truly excels at is staying alive.</p><p>So when he outlives his children and his grandchildren and everyone after them, he simply reaches for another shot of firewhiskey and relishes the burn of it down his throat. When the muggles attack out of fear and prejudice, he shields the few wizards smart enough to come to him for help. And when he stands in the center of the universe and watches the world burn into ash on a wind that doesn’t blow anymore, he merely sighs.</p><p>Then he moves on.</p><p>He has to. That’s his curse, doomed to roam the world for eternity, forced to watch everyone he loves live and die within their lives while he carries them on to the afterlife. He’s a lone silhouette against the fading light as the world succumbs to the darkness he’s spent his entire life battling against, because nothing he does is ever enough.</p><p>And he wonders then, a little selfishly, if he will meet his end. He’s done more than what was required of him, saved the world so many times when no one asked him to. He’s walked among demons that wished the world dead and defeated them while everyone took his sacrifices for granted, endured the muggles deriding him for being the last of his kind even as he saved them all time and time again.</p><p>But Death has other plans in mind, and so Harry is spirited away to another dimension, one where Earth—they call it Midgard now—has just come into being and the Nine Realms are fighting for dominance.</p><p>He walks this new earth for millennia, a silent sentinel among the dust and ruins of entire civilizations that have risen and fallen with the tides of time. He doesn’t interfere anymore, not where he can help it.</p><p>He’s too tired of the war.</p><p>But the Æsir concern him, if nothing else but for the fact that they assume that their longevity and superiority grants them power over the Realms. So he attaches himself to them, makes himself out to be an advisor so he can keep an eye on them.</p><p>He is there when Bor Burison first assembles the Einherjar to steal the Aether away from the Svartálfar and when he eventually falls in battle. He stands by the dais when Odin Borson ascends to the throne after they mourn his father’s passing. He watches from the shadows as Hela Loptrsdottir is made his Executioner and together they assert their power over all the worlds.</p><p>Fenrir Loptrson howls in victory by his sister’s side, and their brother Jormungandr coils behind her, eyes gleaming in pride. Across the battlefield, Hela raises her head and meets Harry’s eyes. A sharp grin curls her lips, and Harry feels an answering smile tug at the corners of his mouth.</p><p>She always has been his favourite student.</p><p>When Midgard is invaded, Odin leads the Æsir to victory against the Jötnar, Hela at his side, as always, and claims the Casket of Ancient Winters as his prize. Somewhere along the way, Thor and Loki Odinsons are born, but Harry doesn’t pay much attention to that. He’s too busy trying to persuade Odin to give the Casket back.</p><p>“Take anything but that!” he shouts at Odin, temper running short. “That’s their source of power, they’ll die without it!”</p><p>“So?” Odin roars. “Know your place, Haraldr. You are but an advisor and I the king. I have the final say in things, and when I say the Nine Realms are better off without the Jötnar, they are!”</p><p>He leaves.</p><p>There’s nothing for him left on Asgard. Hela can handle being on her own for a while, and Fenrir and Jormungandr haven’t spoken to him since before the war with the Jötnar. He needs some time to clear his head.</p><p>There’s nothing but peace for a full century, but then Hela strikes out against Asgard.</p><p>He has completely rotten luck.</p><p>Harry holes himself up on a distant planet, too ashamed and grief-stricken to face his mistake.</p><p>He should have seen it coming.</p><p>He still takes note of every single war that happens, of course. It’s pretty much second nature by now: keep track of all the ways the world decides to screw itself over and try to fix it without revealing himself.</p><p>He saves countless empires that way.</p><p>But he fails even more.</p><p>The Valkyrior fall to Hela, their sworn sister, and he is powerless to help because he was too trusting, too naïve, and he didn’t think she would dare to attack those under his protection.</p><p>That’s a mistake Harry can’t afford to make again. Even after he finds out what happened to turn Hela against Odin, after he returns her brothers from their wrongful imprisonment, he still cannot forget how she slaughtered all her sworn sisters in her fury.</p><p>So he returns to life on Midgard, uprooting himself every decade or so because of his eternal youth. He keeps everyone at arm’s length, friendly but intensely private, so that when he has to pick up and move again, it’s with far less connections to sever.</p><p>There’s only so long he can remain somewhere as an immortal who doesn’t age as mortals do, and having to break his friendships every decade hurts.</p><p>Of course, he does make exceptions. He steps in a couple of times, saves a few people who have too much of their life’s work incomplete to die yet. But no one can convince him to return to Asgard. He can’t look at Odin without remembering the chains biting into Fenrir’s mouth, or the way Jormungandr’s scales were dulled and chipped when Harry had finally found him.</p><p>That changes when Tyr finds him standing in the Alfheim plains one day. “Haraldr!” he calls, and pulls a small boy forward. Tyr grins at Harry’s confusion. “I have found you a new student,” he says. “Prince Loki wanted to meet the famed seiðmaðr, and our queen has nothing more to teach him. You would not deny him this chance, hm?”</p><p>Harry shoots him a half-hearted glare. “I don’t take students anymore, Tyr,” he sighs, tipping his head back and closing his eyes. “And I know what you’re doing.”</p><p>“Harry.” His eyes open at the sudden gravity in Tyr’s voice. “No one will teach him, not after the war. Please.”</p><p>A quick movement from Loki draws Harry’s attention, and he turns just fast enough to see him hide behind Tyr, hair falling forward to obscure his face. He tugs gently at Tyr’s hand and mumbles something too soft for Harry to catch. But Tyr doesn’t move, just watches Harry with an all-too-knowing gaze.</p><p>Damn it.</p><p>“All right,” Harry hears himself say. He rolls his eyes at Tyr’s sly grin and makes his way to Loki, kneeling before him. “Loki, right?” he asks, and is rewarded with a shy smile. “Can you show me what you have learned already?”</p><p>Clever eyes peek out from the fringe of black hair, then Loki raises a hand and summons a green flame.</p><p>Harry’s breath catches in his throat. It’s the exact colour of the <em>Avada</em> <em>Kedavra</em>.</p><p>A warm hand squeezes his shoulder and he knows, without looking up, that Tyr has moved to stand behind him. Pulling together the shreds of his composure, Harry offers Loki a smile. “That’s a very good start,” he says with only a slight waver in his voice. “Come, I’ll show you what else you can do with that flame.”</p><p>Most of their time together is spent on Alfheim. Harry only returns to Asgard when Tyr can draw Odin away with council meetings, but he doesn’t stay long. It’s long enough to see the obvious difference in the way Asgard treats Thor and Loki, long enough to know that something’s not quite right in the way Odin talks to Loki sometimes.</p><p>But not long enough to teach Loki everything he knows. <em>Never</em> long enough.</p><p>He’s learnt his lesson, and no one in this universe will ever hold the same power Hela does.</p><p>He tells himself that it’s for the good of the world, but Death forces him to admit that the loss of the Valkyrior still <em>hurts</em>.</p><p>“There is nothing wrong with having selfish reasons, Harry,” she says in the middle of a ravaged battlefield. Stepping over the broken bodies of the fallen soldiers, she continues, “Everyone is selfish. It just depends on whether that selfishness leads to responsibility or not.”</p><p>Harry resolves to never ask her for advice again when she stops before a general and steps on his face hard enough for bone to crunch.</p><p>He doesn’t account for how quickly the millennia pass. He’d always thought that being alone will just drag out the years, that the lack of attachments means being forced to endure centuries of torturous emptiness. But they flash past in the blink of an eye and somehow that makes everything worse. It hurts that he’s grown so used to the lack of company, that his magic sends echoes into the universe that are never answered.</p><p>No one told him immortality would be this lonely.</p><p>“It’s not fair,” he screams at Death once, sobs wracking his frame. She doesn’t answer, just watches him with a hint of hopelessness in that skeletal face.</p><p>It’s only made worse when he realizes that this world is almost exactly the same but with one major difference. It’s one that makes Harry want to get the hell away from Midgard and while his days away in some distant planet far, far away in the distant galaxies.</p><p>There are no wixen.</p><p>There’s no one he can identify with, no one he knows from before, and the future gets bleaker by the second when he remembers that he’ll probably live forever.</p><p>For Harry, this is only the beginning. But there will never be an ending.</p>
