  <strong>Hermione’s Pov</strong>
</p>
<p align="justify">The sight that greeted Hermione Granger when she came through the portrait hole caught her by surprise. It wasn’t the large number of Gryffindors that were laughing with drinks in their hands, playing games with each other and dancing in celebration of the successful Quidditch match. It was what she saw after that. Looking around for any signs of Ron Weasley, her boyfriend, she stiffened as she spotted him in a corner of the common room, snogging Lavender Brown, a girl who was in their year.</p>
<p align="justify">Hermione gasped as Ron wrapped his arms around Lavender’s waist while Lavender’s arms went up to wrap around his neck. It wasn’t until Hermione had been standing there for a moment with her mouth hanging slightly open in shock, that Ron stopped kissing Lavender, pulling back from her and opening his eyes.</p>
<p align="justify">Then, he caught sight of Hermione, and his eyes widened.</p>
<p align="justify">“Hermione!” he exclaimed, panic-stricken, letting go of Lavender. Hermione turned away from him. “Wait, Hermione, I’m sorry!” he cried out. Hermione dashed out back through the portrait hole, her bushy brown hair trailing behind her; Ron immediately chased after her.</p>
<p align="justify">“Hermione, just let me explain!” she heard him yell desperately.</p>
<p align="justify">She turned around sharply.</p>
<p align="justify">“What is there to explain exactly, Ronald?” she demanded. “You and Lavender Brown were wrapped up in a rather tight embrace.”</p>
<p align="justify">“It was nothing compared to kissing you,” he rushed to claim. “She came at me and-”</p>
<p align="justify">“Stop!” Hermione interrupted shrilly, feeling quite exasperated. “Don’t even try making excuses. Just leave me alone.”</p>
<p align="justify">With that, she pulled out her wand and shot a hex at him nonverbally, causing Ron to start sneezing uncontrollably as she hurried into an unlocked classroom.</p>
<p align="justify">She sank to the ground against the wooden door, tears trailing down her cheeks. She sat there with her knees drawn up to her chest, her head buried in her arms, her body shaking with sobs.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Ron’s Pov</strong>
</p>
<p align="justify">After the sneezing hex had worn off, Ron headed back towards the Gryffindor common room. Just as he reached the portrait hole, it was opened to reveal his younger sister, Ginny. Ginny glared as soon as she saw him, placing her hands on her hips the way that their mother would when she was angry.</p>
<p align="justify">Taking a step closer to him, Ginny smacked her hand across his cheek hard.</p>
<p align="justify">“What the hell were you thinking?” she demanded</p>
<p align="justify">“Ow!” Ron swore under his breath, rubbing his cheek where she had hit him.</p>
<p align="justify">“Well?” Ginny prompted impatiently. “You have nothing to say for yourself?”</p>
<p align="justify">Ron guiltily rubbed the back of his neck.</p>
<p align="justify">“It sorta just happened,” he murmured, looking down. He knew his ears must be red. “It was very sudden. Lavender seemed drunk but she just came at me and I kissed her back without thinking.”</p>
<p align="justify">Ginny rolled her eyes.</p>
<p align="justify">“When you’re dating someone, Ron, it matters who you kiss!” she exclaimed incredulously.</p>
<p align="justify">“Don’t look at me like that,” he muttered in response.</p>
<p align="justify">“Like what? Like you’re a small child having trouble understanding a simple concept?” Ginny suggested.</p>
<p align="justify">“Look, I know I messed up.” Ron gave an agitated sigh, running his fingers through his hair. “I never meant to hurt her like this. I need to talk to her.”</p>
<p align="justify">“No, you’re going to leave her alone,” Ginny snapped. “I doubt she wants to see you right now.”</p>
<p align="justify">Knowing there must be some truth to this, Ron gave the password to the Fat Lady.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Ginny’s Pov</strong>
</p>
<p align="justify">Ginny found Hermione in the nearest unlocked classroom. The desks inside were arranged in neat little rows and copies of <em>The Standard Book of Spells</em> laid on each one. Professor Flitwick, the teacher that taught Charms in this classroom to first-year through seventh-year students was nowhere to be seen. Hermione, however, was sitting on his desk in the front of the room.</p>
<p align="justify">A flock of birds that she seemingly had conjured were twittering and circling her head. As Ginny approached her, Hermione pulled out her wand from her robes and gave it a wave, causing the birds to vanish. She must have been planning on telling whoever came in that she was just practicing charms, Ginny thought.</p>
<p align="justify">Hermione clearly had been crying though, judging by her puffy red eyes. Instinctively, Ginny held her arms out, silently offering her friend a hug. Hermione reacted instantly, putting away her wand and standing up. Ginny wrapped her arms around Hermione, squeezing her affectionately. Hermione hugged her back and the two stayed like that for a moment before they broke apart. The hug seemed to have made Hermione feel slightly better; she didn’t look as sad as before.</p>
<p align="justify">“You know I could go find my poor excuse for a brother and use the bat-bogey hex on him,” Ginny volunteered, clenching her jaw at the thought of Ron and his insensitivity. She was becoming fed up with his lack of tact.</p>
<p align="justify">Hermione shook her head in response, sitting back on the teacher’s desk.</p>
<p align="justify">“Stay with me?” she mumbled.</p>
<p align="justify">Ginny nodded and Hermione scooted over so Ginny could sit next to her. Hermione leaned her head against Ginny’s shoulder and Ginny wrapped an arm around her again.</p>
<p align="justify">“What I don’t understand is why he couldn’t have just broken things off with me,” Hermione said suddenly, her voice shaking slightly. Her brown eyes were starting to water again, but she blinked the tears back, folding her arms across her chest and scowling.</p>
<p align="justify">“I can’t believe that instead, he chose to cheat on me with Lavender Brown,” she said sharply. “We’ve been dating for a couple of weeks and I thought things were going well. Clearly, I was wrong. You certainly wouldn’t see me prancing around snogging strangers when I want to dump the person I'm with. They don't even know anything about each other and since when has he shown an interest in her? Sure, she's flirted with him and he was flattered, but he never flirts back.”</p>
<p align="justify">“Yeah, who knows what Ron was thinking. He probably wasn’t thinking. If he had been thinking then he would’ve realized that you’re a much better catch than Lavender Brown and left her alone,” Ginny opined. “Trust me, you deserve so much better than my brother. He’s an idiot for doing what he did and he’ll regret it soon enough.”</p>
<p align="justify">At that moment the classroom door was slowly opened. A tall, lanky, figure with fiery red hair and a freckled complexion stood outside.</p>
<p align="justify">“Speak of the devil,” Ginny murmured to herself.</p>
<p align="justify">“Hermione, can we talk?” Ron asked tentatively.</p>
<p align="justify">Ginny rose from the desk.</p>
<p align="justify">“Ron, I already told you to leave her alone,” she said, irritated.</p>
<p align="justify">Ron ignored her, looking to Hermione for an answer.</p>
<p align="justify">“We’ve already talked,” Hermione said, her face blank and her voice steady. “I assume that you’ve already figured out that we’re through. You really shouldn’t be keeping Lavender Brown waiting in the boys’ dormitory much longer.”</p>
<p align="justify">Ron started stuttering and Hermione calmly stood up, looking as though she was going to leave. However, halfway to the door, she drew her wand, conjured another flock of birds, and spun around as fast as a speeding bullet, pointing her wand at Ron.</p>
<p align="justify">“Oppugno!” The birds swirling around her shot at Ron. He yelped as one hit its mark, pecking his arm. He made for the door, but it was too late. They were all upon him, scratching and clawing at his flesh. Ron flailed his arms everywhere in an effort to drive them away.</p>
<p align="justify">Hermione lowered her wand, seeming satisfied. Then her face started to crumble. She pushed past Ron, rushing out of the classroom and slamming the door behind her.</p>
