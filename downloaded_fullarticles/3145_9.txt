    <p>A skinny, bespectacled preteen laid awake and blinked at the ceiling. He was comfortable yet distraught in his tiny cupboard under the stairs, the place he'd called home for as long as he could remember. His name was Harry, he was about to turn 11, and he was the pure embodiment of the word <em>miserable</em>...but not for reasons that you might expect.</p><p>Harry was <em>not </em>a normal boy.</p><p>For starters, he didn't live with his parents; he resided with his Aunt Petunia, his Uncle Vernon, and his pleasant, congenial cousin Dudley. In everyone's eyes (except for Harry's), the Dursleys were supportive surrogate parents who had always viewed Harry as a second son. Throughout his life, they encouraged him to pursue the same activities and extracurriculars as Dudley, from t-ball to Boy Scouts. However, it was soon apparent that Harry (unlike Dudley) was not a typical child.</p><p>While Dudley enjoyed playing soccer and games on his PlayStation, Harry much preferred simpler activities, such as cross-stitching and making cornhusk dolls. Harry's most traumatic childhood experience had occurred at a Chuck E. Cheese when he was six, although not due to understandable reasons, such as fear over the giant animatronic creatures. Instead, Harry had simply seen the <em>lights</em> and heard the <em>music </em>inside the venue, and that had sent him skyrocketing over the edge.</p><p>While screaming in a pathetic little ball outside on the pavement, Harry had sobbed, "The kids get <strong>TICKETS!</strong> WHAT DID THEY DO TO EARN THAT REWARD? Were any fields plowed today? Any cows milked? NO!"</p><p>Whenever questioned about her nephew's odd behavior, Petunia Dursley responded by saying, "You know, not <em>every</em> boy is interested in playing rough! And besides, gay marriage is legal now, so…"</p><p>Having decided that Harry's needs were not going to be met in conventional ways, Vernon and Petunia had focused all of their energy on honing Harry's "talents" instead. So far, his talents included singing "Pop Goes the Weasel" repeatedly at a high volume, and riding a bike. The last one was achieved with about 40% accuracy, depending on the day.</p><p>Yes...it was true. Harry simply did <em>not</em> fit in, and he detested his aunt and uncle for forcing him to try. In fact, he frequently enjoyed envisioning himself as a raft, bobbing listlessly in an electronic sea of broken smart phones. During these fantasies, he would wrap his arms around his legs, rock back and forth, and loudly cry, "WHAT IS A TWEET?"</p><p>These fantasies were some of Harry's fondest memories.</p><p>As Harry gazed at the ceiling, lost in pleasant recollections, his little spider friend Jebediah crawled daintily along the rafters. Whenever anyone asked Harry about his friends, he casually mentioned Jebediah and all of the fun times they had together. This was less pathetic than admitting that he didn't have any, but things <em>did</em> get awkward when Harry explained that he and Jebediah's favorite past time was playing a game called Who Will Bite Me?</p><p>Harry glanced over at a picture of his mum and dad that sat beneath Jebediah's rafter. They were wearing conservative black attire and head coverings. Neither was smiling as they stared glumly ahead, brows furrowed in intense concentration, as if they had to poop very badly but knew a bathroom was miles away. His mother's attractive bonnet and his father's striking top hat were presumably part of their mandatory gang getups.</p><p>To Harry, they embodied pure happiness. Unfortunately, Harry only had this picture to remember them by, as they had been killed when Harry was a mere baby.</p><p>You see, Harry had been raised by his aunt and uncle because his parents were murdered in a gang shooting. Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon often reminded him that this was the reality of living in England (and literally nowhere else in the world): Sometimes, you just die in random gun violence!</p><p>Harry had long-since accepted that having absent parents meant his life would forever be an empty black tunnel, one filled with resonating technological noises like the familiar cacophony of a dial-up internet connection and the ringtone everyone thinks of when they think of ringtones.</p><p>Harry sighed and turned over on his floor-bed, the one he'd insisted on inhabiting since early childhood. He'd been offered a "real bed" in a "real room" so many times that Vernon and Petunia had lost count, but it was of no use. No matter how many precautions his relatives had put in place to keep Harry in an actual room, his poor aunt and uncle had always arisen in the morning to find him sleeping under the stairs.</p><p>Harry sighed and closed his eyes, hoping that sleep would overtake him before he had to think too much about what the hell a coin was.</p>
<hr/><p>However, Harry awoke the next day - and on his eleventh birthday, no less - to find that things were not going according to his plan.</p><p>At 4:00 AM (Harry's favorite time to rise for the day), his nightmarishly well-intentioned aunt and uncle knocked on his cupboard to inform him that they'd be taking him to a beach resort.</p><p>The grins plastered across their faces suggested they assumed that Harry was a normal preteen; as such, they figured he'd enjoy a week frolicking in the brisk waters of the North Sea, torturing seagulls, and letting the coy British sun caramelize his rice paper skin.</p><p>But clearly they should have saved their goddamn money, because Harry spent the whole time in praying in the timeshare's broom closet.</p><p>"Lord," he intoned, his elbows propped on a shelf holding bottles of Clorox, Windex, and mildew spray. "Please forgive my Aunt Petunia, Uncle Vernon, and Cousin Dudley this week, as they shamelessly bare their bodies in the daylight, then fasten their trousers with buttons. The ocean doth erode a man's spirit as well as the shore."</p><p>His boyish tenor crescendoed at this last phrase, reverberating throughout the small enclosed space and making Jebediah tremble at Harry's breast. The spider had absconded up Harry's shirt before the family left for their vacation and stayed perched on his left nipple for comfort and support.</p><p>"Love?" Aunt Petunia's voice came muffled through the door. "Come on out, we've got your birthday cake ready! Just the way you like it."</p><p><em>Just the way Harry liked it</em> was plain. No frosting, no vanilla flavor, just a "humble baked dessert looking to do the Lord's work". Initially, he asked his aunt to bake "shoofly cake", but Mrs. Dursley had no idea what that was, and with a sigh, Harry had agreed to this second choice.</p><p>The Dursleys were gathered around the table, waiting for Harry to join them. Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia wore matching uncertain smiles while Dudley looked as though he would much rather be doing anything else, like pilates or time in a North Korean labor camp. When Harry sat down, the unadorned golden discus of god-fearing cake in front of him, the family knew much better than to start singing. Instead, they all joined hands and lowered their heads.</p><p>Harry closed his eyes and said one of his favorite prayers: "O Great and Glorious Creator of the Universe, we are not worthy of the food you give us to eat or the air you give us to breath, but we thank thee for staying thine's smiting hand yet another day. Amen."</p><p>"Amen," the Dursleys echoed uncomfortably.</p><p>"Sure you don't want to blow out any candles, Harry?" Aunt Petunia asked.</p><p>Harry groaned like a dad dealing with a terrible kid that ruined his best running shoes. "I told you, candles lit for an individual is a form of idolatry."</p><p>"Oh," she said. "Right."</p><p>The family began to eat the cake. It was like buttered toast in cake form and when Harry put it in his now 11-year-old mouth, he felt closer to who he truly was.</p><p>Suddenly, the door was punished by an unknown assailant.</p><p>
  <em>THUD! THUD! THUD!</em>
</p><p>Everything in the timeshare shook - the white wicker coffee table, the wood-paneled appliances from the 80s, the plates and forks the family was trying to eat Harry's cake with. Aunt Petunia cried out as a garishly-colored painting of a seal crashed to the floor. "Mr. Wiggles!"</p><p>When the thudding stopped, everyone sat frozen in shock. After a stretch of silence, Dudley voiced everyone's thoughts: "What in the hickety-heck was <em>that</em>?"</p><p><em>THUD! THUD! THUD! </em>This time, the earthquake was followed by angry grumblings in what sounded like German.</p><p>"Shit," Dudley said again. "<em>It's Nazis</em>."</p><p>"Young man - " Uncle Vernon began to admonish, though secretly he, too, was afraid it was unholy golem of Nazis that had snuffed out his half-Jewish blood and were here to take him and his son away to unspeakable horrors. It was honestly the most logical conclusion he could have drawn at the time.</p><p>However, before he could get any further, the front door shot off its hinges, rocketing into the living room and leaving a cloud of dust and splinters in its wake.</p><p>A giant beard attached to two enormous tree stumps stood in the doorframe.</p><p>"WHERE IS BROTHER POTTER?!" it boomed.</p><p>As Harry stared at the looming creature before him, he was shocked to realize that he had managed to glance at this man's body for a full 30 seconds without going to his mental happy place - the Smartphone Sea.</p><p>Harry frankly couldn't remember the last time he'd been able to take a prolonged glance at a fellow human being without somehow drifting off to that magical locale where he could merrily bob between a corroded Nexus 6 and a factory-locked iPhone 3. This had become a particularly unfortunate habit in school, as Harry would miss entire lessons if a teacher chose to wear some shameful sandals or a scandalous knee-length sundress.</p><p>After a sufficiently awkward amount of time, Dudley broke the silence by scurrying to his feet and bellowing, "HEIL HITLER!"</p><p>"Dudley," murmured Vernon disapprovingly, glaring at his son who had chosen to remain stoic in a standing Nazi salute. It was not lost on him that his son had willfully chosen to embody the same evil forces that had eliminated most of his extended family. Vernon placed his head in his hands and sighed deeply.</p><p>But the large man ignored all of this and again repeated, "WHERE IS BROTHER POTTER?"</p><p>As Harry glanced at the man, an odd sense of familiarity crept over him. The closest thing he could compare it to was a sensation he'd had a few weeks ago when he spilled a bowl of soup on his pants; as Harry had felt the noodle-y warmth spread through his jeans, he'd been instantly reminded of the time he pissed himself in first grade during his recorder concert, an oddly pleasurable memory that he had long-since forgotten.</p><p>Seeing this large man was exactly like that, but Harry desperately hoped <em>this</em> experience would come without the lifelong need to wear child-sized diapers to any event that could potentially cause even vague amounts of anxiety.</p><p>Dry as a bone - and with a voice that Harry himself didn't even recognize - he stared at the man and replied "I...I think I'm who you're looking for!"</p><p>The large man's face split into an enormous grin and he took two steps forward, grasping Harry's clammy little hand and shaking his entire body with the force of his handshake.</p><p>"It's so good ter see ya, Brother Potter. My name is Brother Hagrid, and I've been sent ter rescue ya from these depraved English folk!"</p><p>At this, Aunt Petunia, leapt to her feet, her pink hair curlers bouncing.</p><p>"I'll have you know," she snapped, her face contorted like a baby eating a lemon, "That we are not <em>depraved</em> English folk. My father is <em>directly</em> related to Henry VIII and on my mother's side, we believe that-"</p><p>But before she could continue to spew the bullshit <em>my-family-is-so-famous</em> nonsense that everyone - regardless of lineage - is somehow convinced to be true, her mouth was smothered by a gigantic hand.</p><p>"I'm not talking about <em>English</em> English, you <em>kauptdoof</em>! I'm talking about English, as in non-Amish. As in, non-holy," said Hagrid, clearly annoyed.</p><p>Aunt Petunia receded slightly, put her head down and muttered, "Oh! Yeah, no, that makes a lot more sense. Sorry."</p><p>"A..Amish?" Harry asked quietly, still shaking from the giant's handshake.</p><p>"Yes," Brother Hagrid replied, whipping around quickly and looking confused. "Ya know...like yer mom and dad? And yer whole family?"</p><p>Harry just shrugged apologetically and glanced at Dudley, who was now sweating at the brow and grunting from the exertion of holding his hand raised in the Hitler salute.</p><p>"Ya mean," said Hagrid, turning to face the Dursleys once again, "...that this boy here knows <em>nothin'</em> of his heritage? Knows <em>nothin'</em> of the Amish Mafia that mercilessly killed Lily and James Potter, the greatest Amish couple that ever lived?"</p><p>Vernon had been staring into space and imagining Dudley as an extremely incompetent SS officer, but Brother Hagrid's booming voice shook him awake from his reverie.</p><p>"Oh, yeah, <em>that</em>," said Vernon, yawning, "Honestly, we always just thought that shit was weird."</p><p>"Yeah," Petunia elaborated, returning to her seat on the couch, "My mother was always <em>oddly </em>supportive of her 11-year-old daughter's choice to marry an Amish dude and run off to America with him. Personally I never really got on board with that, cause I really enjoy having things like phones and electricity."</p><p>Vernon folded his arms over his chest and nodded in agreement. He opened his mouth as if to say something, but Petunia plowed on.</p><p>"Plus," she said, starting to laugh, "I don't know who I'd <em>be </em>today if I hadn't gotten to experience those slutty college years, <em>amiright</em>?"</p><p>At this, Petunia desperately glanced around the room for someone - <em>anyone </em>- to justify those experiences.</p><p>Unfortunately, she was only was met with dead stares from the men in her midst, and Vernon made a small noise in the back of his throat. This was quickly followed by a strained utterance of, "You...you said I was your first!"</p><p>But Harry and Hagrid had no fucking patience for any of this; the Dursleys had gotten on their respective last nerves the second they mentioned electricity.</p><p>Hagrid rolled the giant glassy globes in his skull that served as his eyes and looked back at Harry. His gaze was fond, akin to how a grandma looks over at her favorite collectible china dachshund.</p><p>When he spoke again, his voice was tender.</p><p>"Yer <em>Amish</em>, Harry."</p>
