    <p>There is darkness that lives in places such as this, a quiet village town that boasts history and trust between people. Cobbled stone walkways and trees that are older than it's settlers- a cold gust of wind now and again. The sound of the kids playing and women chattering about, waiting for their fathers to come home. It's the last place for dark magic to lay waste, but the light in it attracts them to devour. To destroy. To keep the dark vast, suffocating everyone in it's way. Today's case is like all the others, a mother of Two found Petrified and vitals signs all gone. The normal cure rendered useless, It's like they are in the state of Undead, fueling the rumors of an Undead Army being assembled in the far South. Everyday it goes like this, incidents piling up and soon, the Muggles will be involved.</p><p> </p><p>Auror Jon Snow , an expert in Dark Magic and Curse Breaking is looking at the scene before him and tries to weave what actually happened. In all his years of his experience, this seems to be bad news. As bad as the threat of the second wizarding war. Any Death Eater wannabee should be shot down. The Minister of Magic, Hermione Granger ordered to have a team dedicated to this incident- ensuring it will be controlled. As a curse breaker, he worked alone for almost five years and this working with other people can be overwhelming.</p><p> </p><p>He did finish Auror Training after graduating at Hogwarts but couldn't go through with the actual work till after 3 years ago. He needed a change, plus a position opened up and it felt like a sign. He has good people under him, Why The Harry Potter decided to pick him out of all the Aurors to lead this mission is beyond him. It did not make him popular in the Division, people wanted this job or the glory of it. If only they knew how hard this is, with the attacks starting a year ago but only escalating in the past months.</p><p>Gendry is asking a few neighbors on what happened before they found the body. Tormund is surveying the scene and Ygritte is positively seething while looking at the scene.</p><p>" I swear to you Jon, we will get these bastards who keep on doing this! " He can see the frustration in the red head's face, she means well but there is no room for rage right now. " It's sick, we don't even know if we should dispose the bodies or keep them in stasis till we find the culprit. "</p><p>" It's definitely the Undead problem . Same symptoms, " Tormund comes over to the both of them, his wand in hand ready to attack.</p><p>" We are being summoned back to the Ministry, " Gendry calls them, urgency in his voice and Jon can't help but feel the dread. He's superior already let him know, Jaime Lannister, telling him that they will be working with Unspeakables. Those special ones in the department of Mysteries- he's been interested being one before, but being an Auror had it's charm.</p><p>" Jon, we don't need anyone else, " Ygritte tells him as they walk towards their portkey. It's a slap on the wrist, that's what it is. They have no solid progress in the investigation.</p><p>" I know, but all are leads are turning cold. We need to find this Night King and their lair so this can all end. " Jon doesn't like the idea too, but he can't let his pride get in the way of saving these people.</p><p>" The body count is now up to 51, in statis at St. Mungos. The Ministry is pressured. " He explains, knowing that his team needs this ego boost. They have learned a few clues in the months of investigations. The signs and symptoms. That the attackers are like the Undead victims except they can walk and kill. They have encountered some but they all escaped, one who died and said their allegiance is to their Night King.</p><p>" I get it Jon, but the Unspeakables are creepy. Fake names. Disillusionment all over their body- " Tormund Complains and Gendry pats his back like he understands.</p><p>" We will cooperate with them and follow Ministry's instruction. This is bigger than us or our pride, We just want a solid lead and make sure all those victims are cured. "</p><p>He says finally as they touch the Portkey. It's the same uneasy feeling in his stomach as they land a close two feet to the Ministry office. Jon Snow leads his team as they all go in, in flames as they enter the main atrium- people walking and onto their own offices. This is why Jon has to work twice as hard , these people rely on them. He just needs one lead, someone to slip up so he knows what he is up against. A tip, so he can confront one of the Night King's Minions. It's been the most frustrating two months of his life by far, and this collaboration with the Department of Mysteries is not helping any.</p><p>He excuses himself to change into better Auror's robe before the meetings and pulls his hair up in a ponytail.</p><p>" Hot Date? " Jon curses as he notices Jaime Lannister not even knocking and is just in his office.</p><p>" Sir, I'm sorry I did not notice you. "</p><p>" That's fine, I just want to go here and talk to you before we go down the rabbit hole. " he laughs at that but Jon just keeps a straight face.</p><p>" I will cooperate sir, I think the Unspeakables can really help us. "</p><p>" They can, they have a lead on the next attack. "</p><p>" How do they know? " Jon asks, perplexed at this intel. Every information is to go to Him. Jaime. The Minister of Magic and Harry Potter.</p><p>" They will tell us, but they have tools their that we are not to use. " Jaime says and Jon thinks about it. How little they all know of the Department of Mysteries and what they have down there. The Time Turner, one that intrigues him. A tool so powerful and destructive, that only high skilled people like Unspeakables are allowed to hold and guard.</p><p>" Are they ready? "</p><p>" You are to meet with one Unspeakable. He is the only one they are going to loan- apparently, this is not the first time he's worked with Ministry officials. "</p><p>" An Ambassador? " Jon smiles, he's already intrigued. Is this their way of making Unspeakables known?</p><p>" I think so, you let me know how it goes- off you go Snow, don't keep them waiting. "</p><p>" Thank you Sir. "</p><p>Jon makes him way down to the Department of Mysteries and thinks about how far he has come. How his decisions and whatever happens after this meeting will decide the fate of the Wizarding World. How a Muggle born Orphan like him can come this far. He's proud, of course he is, but this mission is reducing him to a lost child. He is determined to find who is doing this, claiming to be a King.</p><p>He has been to this Department once before and as he enters the Dark corridors, It's still the same. His eye catches a lone man in Robes, on his back and he can see dark brown hair. He clears his throat, announcing his arrival and he is met with an Unspeakable.</p><p>His face looks pretty non descript at first glance - like a face who can look like someone else. Dark brown hair that looks soft, defined jaw and thin lips- but there is something striking. Blue eyes. It struck him as soon as he came face to face with this man, There is no mistaking. It's Robb Stark's eyes. But that's impossible, It can't be. A few more seconds and his face looks even more unique.</p><p>" Auror Snow, Nice to meet you. " The man greets him, offering his hand and he accepts.</p><p>" Same here- " he starts, forgetting that these people use Aliases. He doesn't even know his name.</p><p>" They call me Unspeakable Ghost. "</p><p>" Well, that's original. " Jon comments and the Man laughs. He's a different kind of Unspeakable, he gathers. They always look reserved and never meeting anyone's eyes. Let alone laugh good naturedly like this.</p><p>" I hope that's a real compliment. "</p><p>" Should you brief me on our mission? " He says, changing the subject. This man is handsome, but there is just people you don't flirt with.</p><p>" Yes, the Minister of Magic and Harry Potter are waiting for us. " Ghost says and he follows, this is different that what he was told.</p><p>The corridor seemed endless and Jon just follows, not bothering to look around. This person, Ghost. His eyes can just be an illusion, but that shade of blue can only be Robb's. How it seems like it changes color depending on the light or even his mood. It's the one thing, the most beautiful thing he had ever laid eyes on. How can he possibly forget? Even curse breaking and lonely nights can't take that away. Unrequited love is always the sweetest, especially at a young age and the Captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch Team is a walking dream. Add the fact that he was a brave and honest person, giving advise when as a sophomore he tried out.</p><p>Those years spent under his Wing were the best, well not so much the seeing him date countless men and women but never him. They were acquaintances, study buddies sometimes. Till that day- Robb's final year. When the nightmare happened.</p><p>" Are you alright? "</p><p>Ghost's hands is on his shoulder, he must have spaced out and he hates himself for letting his guard down. He should not be too trusting of anyone these days. He can only nod and takes the lead as he opens the door, greeted by Hermione Granger and Harry Potter. The both of them- legends, greeting him as he takes a seat followed by Ghost.</p><p>" Now that we're all here, we can begin. " Hermione starts, Jon on the other hand is trying his best to remain calm and collect his thoughts. He can't spend this whole assignment thinking about the identity of this Unspeakable. If he truly is Robb.</p><p>" Thank you Auror Snow for coming and Unspeakable Ghost. " she greets them and Harry just remains quiet. " This meeting is to carry out this mission for the both of you. You are very capable young men in your field and with this lead, the both of you can eliminate this threat before more people are damaged. "</p><p>" I'm sorry Minister, you said the both of us? I have my team. " Jon interjected and Harry speaks up.</p><p>" I know I asked for you to lead a team, but we can't trust anyone, we want as much Aurors and law enforcement we can in the streets and the two of you in this mission." He explains but Jon remains unconvinced.</p><p>" My Team can be trusted, I know we have not been giving results as expected- "</p><p>" I understand Jon, but Harry and I decided it's best if the two of you do this. Less people to think about, and you two are experts at what you do. " Hermione offers and Jon wants to snap, but he knows these two people are not doing this because of office politics. They defeated the Dark Lord in their teens, they know what they're doing- doesn't mean he hast to be happy and smile the entire assignment.</p><p>" I know you don't trust me, I don't trust you too - but this has to stop. This Night King and the Undead should be eliminated. " Ghost adds, atleast the feeling is mutual.</p><p>" The Intel that we have is that the next Attack will be in Hogsmeade. They are trying to get to Hogwarts, so you understand why we have to act fast. Their Army is growing, driving away giants from their sanctuary. You should disarm the attackers and get to the Night King. We could not send anyone who can do this more that you two. "</p><p>" You will be going there tomorrow morning to scout and you will find shelter in the castle grounds. " Harry adds.</p><p>Going back to Hogwarts is not a good idea for Jon. It's a place of fond memories, but he'd rather not go back. Add the fact that this Unspeakable holds Robb's eyes. It would add to his nerves, another issue to think about.</p><p>" sounds good. " Ghost says flippantly, like it's the easiest thing in the world.</p><p>" I will accept this mission, but I have to talk to my team first - " Jon finally says. Yes. He's pissed. He takes pride in his team and the Auror Force as a whole. He still wants to talk and know more, but it's like he can't breathe so he steps out closely followed by Ghost. This mission is what he's looking for, a solid lead but he always thought it would be with his team. He reaches the elevator to go back to the atrium and he is met again by this mysterious man. His face all serious, unlike the casualness he had minutes ago.</p><p>" I take my job very seriously Auror Snow. I wanted to do this Alone, but Harry and Hermione back there seem to trust you. "</p><p>" I'm the same way, I'll do my best. We'll get the Night King and make them pay. " Jon answers, seeing eye to eye. He feels the fatigue set in as he sees the Atrium, same bustle of people and the bad news he has to bring to his team. It's gonna be a long day.</p>
