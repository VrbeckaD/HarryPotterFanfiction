</p><p>Dark eyes watch her<br/>
Invading her dreams<br/>
Waiting for her to catch him<br/>
Wet walls and solid stone</p><p>Amber eyes search for him<br/>
Filling her dreams<br/>
Waiting for him to see her<br/>
Wet walls and solid stone</p><p>Dark hair falls over troubles<br/>
Knowing he should not want<br/>
Waiting for the feeling<br/>
Strong heart and weak mind</p><p>Chocolate curls hide troubles<br/>
Wanting what she cannot have<br/>
Waiting for the burn<br/>
Strong heart and weak mind</p><p>Dark eyes haunted by truths<br/>
Filling gaps with dreams<br/>
Knowing it can never be<br/>
Moist eyes and clenched hands</p><p>Amber eyes haunted by reality<br/>
Building bridges with wishes<br/>
Knowing it should never be<br/>
Moist eyes and clenched hands</p><p>Dark hair torn from his head<br/>
Anger served like hors d’oeuvres<br/>
Starving for her touch<br/>
Broken glass and forbidden touches</p><p>Chocolate curls torn from her head<br/>
Desire dangled like a carrot<br/>
Broken glass and forbidden touches</p><p>Dark voice calls in her dream<br/>
Knowing what they cannot have<br/>
“You know me,<br/>
I just couldn't help myself”</p><p>Light voice calls in his dream<br/>
Weeping for what could have been<br/>
“You know me,<br/>
I will be waiting.”</p></div>
