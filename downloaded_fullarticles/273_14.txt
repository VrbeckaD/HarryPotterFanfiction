    <p>Hope Lupin had many, many skills, but hiding her irritation wasn’t one of them. </p>
<p>She could hide fear. She could hide disgust. She could look at her son’s bloodied body once a month, see his scars and scabs and rips of flesh, and not react at all. Hers was a steady face. Hers were steady hands. </p>
<p>It was perhaps Remus Lupin’s favorite thing about his mother: when he was crying and aching and wishing for a world that wasn’t this one, she was steady.</p>
<p>But not when she was annoyed, and right now she was very, very annoyed. </p>
<p>She sat at the edge of her seat in their kitchen—the same tiny, yellow-tiled kitchen where Remus had eaten breakfast every day for eleven years. Her elbows rested on the table, chin on her palms. Her thumb wouldn’t stop moving. It brushed back and forth over her lip, quick and jittery, mindless. Remus couldn’t stop watching it. The more it twitched, the more nervous he got. 

But while Remus watched his mother, she watched someone else. Someone who had never stepped foot in their kitchen until about half an hour ago. Someone Remus couldn’t stand to stare at, like an earthed star that might burn his eyes. </p>
<p>Albus Dumbledore. </p>
<p>Remus knew of him by reputation only. A reputation Remus had learned of through a single, crumpled Chocolate Frog card—a remnant from the baggie of candy his father had given him upon returning from a rare trip to London last year. He was supposed to be a great wizard. An inventor. An unmatched duelist. </p>
<p>And now here he was, stirring a cup of tea in Remus’s mother’s kitchen. </p>
<p>“Your china’s charming, Hope,” he said, eyes twinkling, smile twinkling, glittery robes twinkling. Everything twinkling. He held up his cup, a floral-painted thing Remus secretly thought was stupidly tiny. “Delicate. I fear I’ll break off the handle.”</p>
<p>Hope pursed her lips. “I daresay you could fix it if you did.” </p>
<p>Silence fell again. It had been falling and falling and falling since Dumbledore had arrived unannounced on the Lupins’ doorstep. He kept trying to engage Hope and Remus in conversation, but without success. Hope was too unyielding. Remus was too terrified. </p>
<p>The front door swung open. </p>
<p>Lyall Lupin stepped inside. He didn’t see the kitchen’s occupants right away—he was busy balancing five heavy grocery bags. His face was hidden, only his long legs and long fingers visible.</p>
<p>“Lyall,” said Hope. Her tone was a warning.</p>
<p>“I got the eggs,” said Lyall. “And the milk, and your baking powder. You know, I can read the lists you give me.”</p>
<p>“<em>Lyall</em>.” Hope stood, grabbing two of the bags and dumping them unceremoniously on the floor. Remus thought he heard a few eggs crack. “We have a guest.”</p>
<p>Dumbledore stood, offering his hand to shake. “Mr. Lupin,” he said. “A long time it’s been, and thank goodness it’s not been longer.”</p>
<p>“Thank goodness” did not seem to be how Lyall would put it. His pale face had gone even paler, and his eyes were darting between Dumbledore and his son like high-speed pucks in a game of air hockey. He did not take Dumbledore’s hand. </p>
<p>“Albus,” he said, enunciating slowly. It was a voice Remus recognized, the voice his father used when very, very upset, but trying not to show it. “What are you doing here?”</p>
<p>“Well, that should be obvious.” Dumbledore waved a hand in Remus’s direction. “I’ve come to meet your son. School starts in just a month, you know, and he should really be buying his course books. His robes. His wand, most of all. Time is of the essence, my friend.” </p>
<p>School? A sick, twisty feeling bloomed in Remus’s stomach. He stood from the kitchen table, inching back toward the stairs. If he took them two at a time, he’d be in his room in only a few seconds. He could lock the door, and burrow under his covers, and hold his hands over his ears until he didn’t have to hear the word “school” anymore.</p>
<p>It shouldn’t have been a painful word. But it was. Oh, it was. </p>
<p>As if she could hear his thoughts, Hope crossed the room to stand at Remus’s side. She clutched his shoulders, pulling him back against her so his head rested on her chest. Despite himself, Remus turned, curling into her. It was a babyish display. Embarrassing. But it soothed whatever was burrowing in his tummy. </p>
<p>“Albus,” said Lyall. He’d dropped the rest of his grocery bags, and was looking at Dumbledore with an expression of forced amiableness. “I wrote to you about this when we got your first letter. We’ve decided to educate Remus at home. Hope here was taught by her parents as a girl, and it’s very important to her to pass on that tradition.”</p>
<p>That was a complete lie. Hope had gone to school just like everyone else. </p>
<p>Dumbledore smiled genially. “Of course, of course. I wouldn’t want to insult tradition.”</p>
<p>“Thank you. Now, once you’ve finished your tea—”</p>
<p>“But what say you, young Mr. Lupin?” This was directed not to Lyall, but to Remus. Dumbledore offered him an encouraging smile, bending over somewhat to halve their sizable height difference. “Do you feel you’re being well educated here at home?”</p>
<p>Remus leaned further into his mother. He opened and closed his mouth a few times, searching for words that wouldn’t come. Finally, his mother’s thumb rubbing small circles into his back, he stuttered out a response:</p>
<p>“Er. Well. I–I’ve learned a lot of maths. Mum says I’m–I’m well above my age level.”</p>
<p>Dumbledore nodded approvingly. “Good, very good. You know, I’ve always said that Hogwarts woefully undervalues mathematics. I mean, sure, we can transform tables into pigs, but can we calculate tips?”</p>
<p>Hogwarts. Another painful word. </p>
<p>When Remus was very small, it had been an exciting prospect: going to Hogwarts, seeing the enchanted ceiling that looked like the sky, slipping on the sorting hat, making friends, friends, friends. But that dream seemed frivolous now. Remus had a more important thing to think about: survival.</p>
<p>Hope gave what she seemed to think was a gracious smile. “Thank you. I try to cover muggle subjects, and Lyall gives him what magical education he can. Now, if you’re done with the tea—”</p>
<p>“But I must wonder—” Dumbledore stared once more at Remus, and this time his gaze was not so jovial. There was something sincere in it. Something imploring. “I must wonder if your hesitancy to send Remus to school has less to do with tradition, and more to do with ill-conceived wariness about his lycanthropy.” </p>
<p>Lycanthropy. Lycanthropy. The most painful word of all. </p>
<p>It elicited a flurry of responses from the Lupins: a shout of “See here!” from Lyall, a withered scream from Hope, and a silent, shaking choke from Remus. He couldn’t breath. His whole body was seizing. </p>
<p>No one was supposed to know. No one, ever, anywhere. </p>
<p>Dumbledore waved Hope and Lyall down with an air of impatience. Still looking only at Remus, he lowered himself to his knees—quite a feat, Remus thought, for one so elderly. </p>
<p>“Remus,” he said. “Would you like to go to school?”</p>
<p>Immediately, Remus shook his head. “I can’t.”</p>
<p>“That isn’t what I asked. I asked, ‘would you <em>like</em> to?’” </p>
<p>Remus would like to. He’d really, really like to.</p>
<p>His father cut in. “Remus isn’t an idiot,” said Lyall. “He knows what is and isn’t possible. He knows his own limitations.”</p>
<p>Dumbledore shrugged. “We’re people of magic,” he said. “It seems silly, doesn’t it, for us to speak of limitations.”</p>
