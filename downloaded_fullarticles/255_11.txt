    <p>
  <span>The snowy owl’s yellow amber eyes stared straight into Harry's as he stood in front of her cage, jaw slack with awe. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Yeh like 'er?”, Hagrid asked with slight amusement in his eyes and plucked the cage gently off its hook. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Harry nodded mutely as he stuttered a thank you for the best birthday present in his life. It was the best day of his life too if he was honest. His - </span>
  <em>
    <span>his!</span>
  </em>
  <span> - new owl was still watching him with those curious and intelligent eyes when he lifted her cage into his arms and walked after the gigantic man with messy beard and hair. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He looked down at her, smiling so widely he thought his face would split in two, and swore there was the same happy look in his new pet's eyes. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I'll take good care of you. Promise!”, he told the owl who tilted her head like she understood what he said. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Little did he know just how backwards that statement would turn out to be. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">

</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Harry stared at the ceiling of his new room in Private Drive and wondered if the day had been just an incredible dream. His birthday had never been so amazing and fun. But then he'd turn his head and see his new owl's cage and it's drowsy occupant and he'd get this funny glowy feeling in his stomach. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>It was real. He was going to go to a school of magic. Wizards and witches. A whole new </span><em><span>world</span></em> <span>he could explore and be with his </span><em><span>own</span></em><span> kind. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He wouldn’t be the freak anymore. He wouldn’t have to suffer through endless chores and unfair punishments in this household again. Only a month and he'd be free. Only a month and he would get to see the world he belonged to. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>His stomach churned with nerves. He was famous there. Harry had yet to draw an opinion of that but even if it was scary he knew it wouldn't stop him from feeling giddy. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Once again glancing at his owl he contently closed his eyes and drifted off to sleep. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He should come up with a good name. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">
  <span>xXXx</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Uncle Vernon finally allowed his owl to get out of her cage what with all the ruckus she had thrown up when they didn't. Harry was glad. It wouldn't be fun to get confided in a cage for so long. It had been two days since his trip to Diagon Alley and his life had gotten somewhat better. His Aunt and Uncle were furious but afraid of him and thus pretended he didn't exist. Dudley was outright terrified and still had a pig's tail. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He had decided to call his owl Hedwig. It was in one of his school books that he'd been reading through. The history one. She liked it and had nuzzled his cheek after that. He already loved her. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>She was an odd owl, not that Harry minded. In fact, he found her more lovable that way. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>She mostly slept when the boy slept and kept him company when he was awake. Or went to hunt for food but didn't bring it back like owls were supposedly wont to do. No, she brought more interesting things like abandoned objects (a nice pencil, a book, some trinkets, a notebook, dropped coins, a brown jacket about Harry's size, nice toys, more trinkets, chocolate frog cards, etcetera, etcetera) or plants that could be used in potions or some other such. Sometimes she brought unspoiled human food if she found it. Usually it was candy. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Hedwig’s favorite perch was on his shoulder. She groomed his messy locks and nipped at his ear. It felt… nice. She also found his books as amazing as he did, going through them with him and hooting when she read something interesting, dropping the book on his lap so he could read it too. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Harry had to admit that he found the passages useful in understanding a little more about the subjects and the world he was going to. In reward he usually pet her feathers. Not that he didn’t do it already. They were soft and white and he liked the feeling. He hoped it would give her the same warmth that he felt when the owl showed her affections. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">
  <span>xXXx</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Hedwig?”, Harry asked one afternoon. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The Dursleys were ignoring him and the owl was pretty much his only companion. She looked up from the book she'd been reading and tilted her head in question. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Are all other owls as smart as you?” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>She snorted (odd sound from an owl) and ruffled her feathers in a no. Harry had gotten pretty good at reading her body language. At least he </span>
  <em>
    <span>thought</span>
  </em>
  <span> so. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh”, he stayed quiet for a moment as he traced his book's pages. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>It was the potions book and he found it the most interesting. Probably because Hedwig kept bringing him ingredients. Most of them could be found in it but some were complete mysteries. He’d stored them into a plastic lunch box his owl had brought. It was divided in six sections so they could be kept separate. He shook the thoughts off to work up his courage. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Um… I know you can </span>
  <em>
    <span>read</span>
  </em>
  <span> but… can you write?”, he asked hopefully but remembered that she probably couldn’t hold a pencil or pen at all. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>A beak and talons were useful for many things but not that. He just… He </span>
  <em>
    <span>hoped</span>
  </em>
  <span>. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Hedwig, as always, surprised him by staring with those beautiful amber eyes before hopping to the ground and focusing on the quill he had left on the floor. It twitched. Then it shakily rose up and Harry watched with wide, delighted eyes. He scrambled for a paper and the ink bottle before dropping on his knees next to her, putting both in front of the floating quill. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>It less than gracefully dipped down into ink and floated over the paper, only one black drop dropping before she wrote shaky letters. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>‘Apparently’, it read and Harry tried not to laugh. Then she drew a disfigured smiley face and he had to muffle one so the Dursleys didn’t hear. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>His owl could </span>
  <em>
    <span>write</span>
  </em>
  <span>. They could communicate better! </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">
  <span>xXXx</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Only two weeks”, Harry muttered as he crossed another day from the slip of paper he'd taped to the wall. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>By now they had all but finished the school books between themselves and quizzed each other over them with paper, quill, and ink. It was a fun game they invented because boredom. Besides, the boy had to learn how to write better with a </span>
  <em>
    <span>quill</span>
  </em>
  <span> and </span>
  <em>
    <span>ink</span>
  </em>
  <span>. Harry's enthusiasm for learning returned slowly but surely. He had almost forgotten he had it with the Dursleys all but ordering him to not do well. Hedwig had been encouraging him to learn. It was good too, because he found that learning things with his owl was the most fun he had had in his life. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>His first friend was an owl. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He didn’t really mind. At all. Hedwig was </span>
  <em>
    <span>amazing</span>
  </em>
  <span>. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The owl understood him well. Truly understood and accepted. She had a patient personality and would fuss over him when he felt sad. She found him actual food when he was hungry and took care of him. Funny when he had promised to care for </span>
  <em>
    <span>her</span>
  </em>
  <span>. Also, she could float smaller objects around and had demonstrated with a small transfiguration of a matchstick to a needle that you didn’t really </span>
  <em>
    <span>need</span>
  </em>
  <span> the wand to learn things. Sure, it made things much easier, but people could learn without. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Harry</span>
  </em>
  <span> would be able to learn without. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>It was beyond cool to think that it was possible. Hedwig even told him that there was a school in Africa that didn’t use wands at all. Even if they thought it was a great tool for summoning power quickly. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>His owl knew a </span>
  <em>
    <span>lot</span>
  </em>
  <span> about the magical world and all Harry had to do was ask or mention something and he would have an answer. If she </span>
  <em>
    <span>didn’t</span>
  </em>
  <span> know something (which had only happened thrice) she gave a speculating answer anyway or wrote a ‘wait for a bit’ and came back with one. A treasure trove of knowledge. That’s what she was. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>And his dear friend. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Who seemed to be staring at him with a contemplative gaze. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“…Hedwig?”, he asked nervously. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The owl tilted her head and flew over to him with some paper and the quill. There were filled papers </span>
  <em>
    <span>stacked</span>
  </em>
  <span> in his room and Hedwig had had to go out to find more. Or then she duplicated them. His ink bottle was severely depleted. Until Hedwig cast a spell that refilled it. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Magic was amazing. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>She turned to him and wrote with neat script he had tried to copy more than once. While his handwriting had gotten better, it wasn’t </span><em><span>nearly</span></em><span> as refined as the owl’s now that she got the hand on ‘wandless</span> <span>locomotor’ as she’d put it. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>‘Would you like me to be your familiar?’, she asked. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Harry blinked, “What’s a familiar?” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>‘Animal companion who usually always stays by their master’s side’, she told him, ‘It means I could join your classes and share some of my abilities once the bond is old enough’ </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The boy felt his mouth go dry with the implications. She wanted to stay by his side. Always. Someone by his side </span>
  <em>
    <span>always</span>
  </em>
  <span>. Never alone anymore. He… wanted that. Maybe more than anything he’d ever wanted before. So he nodded, throat constricting and preventing him from forming coherent sentences. Her eyes were smiling and he felt like she… sparkled. There were no other words for it. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>She wrote again. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>‘You have to learn to move your magic around before it’s possible. It shouldn’t take long now. You’ve already felt it’ </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He nodded and immediately went to his lumpy bed to start meditating. This time it was with renewed vigor. Hedwig perched herself on top of his head and helped by letting her magic guide him. Just like always since he said he wanted to learn to do things wandlessly too. It had taken him twenty minutes to start recognizing the owl’s magic and two days to feel its movements. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>This was the fifth day. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>And it was getting easier and easier to slip into a meditative state of mind. He concentrated on Hedwig’s magic that comfortingly led him deeper and nudged at him gently. Then she slowly pulled away and wrapped it around him instead of inside and then he could start searching for the warm </span>
  <em>
    <span>feeling-power-energy</span>
  </em>
  <span> he had found just yesterday. After two hours of meditating. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Hedwig had told him not to rush things and first to only concentrate on recognizing it and what it was doing before even attempting to move it. That might have disastrous consequences. It was a part of him, like a limb, and it would have to become familiar before he accidentally set himself on fire or something equally disturbing. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>‘First learn to recognize and feel it, like an extension of your will, and after you can feel that in less than a minute you can try to slowly direct it to different places of your body’, he recalled the instructions. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>This time he found it much faster. It still felt warm and twisting and like… </span>
  <em>
    <span>him</span>
  </em>
  <span>. But it wasn’t something he could feel as </span>
  <em>
    <span>his</span>
  </em>
  <span> to control yet and it was </span>
  <em>
    <span>everywhere</span>
  </em>
  <span> inside him so he couldn’t try to even twitch it yet. His magic was reacting more to his emotions and thoughts than clear direction now. And he would stop feeling it once he stopped meditating. According to Hedwig he’d be ready to try spells once he could feel it at the drop of a hat. That he could slowly master his magic once he could feel and direct it </span>
  <em>
    <span>always</span>
  </em>
  <span>. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He breathed deeply. This would take a while. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">
  <span>xXXx</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He found that he liked reading. The book Hedwig had dropped off about a week in, </span>
  <em>
    <span>Lord of the Rings</span>
  </em>
  <span> by J. R. R. Tolkien, was his favorite so far. It actually had three books and a prequel (Hedwig explained what that was) called </span>
  <em>
    <span>The Hobbit</span>
  </em>
  <span> but she had found an edition with all of them stacked together and he </span>
  <em>
    <span>loved</span>
  </em>
  <span> the story. Frodo was so brave… He wished he could be like that. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Of course, Hedwig told him that he </span>
  <em>
    <span>was</span>
  </em>
  <span> brave. After all, he could stand up to himself even when his relatives treated him so horribly all his childhood. He had confided in her once she had offered to be his familiar. It was easy to talk to her. Perhaps a part of that was that she was an animal, if a scarily intelligent one. He wasn’t sure he believed her though. Bravery… it was so… strange a concept. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>What </span>
  <em>
    <span>was</span>
  </em>
  <span> bravery? </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He asked his trusty owl. Amber eyes softened and pretty letters filled a parchment. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>‘Bravery is the capacity to perform properly even when scared half to death’, she told him in a quote by someone called Omar N. Bradley before continuing on her own, ’It’s strength in the face of pain or grief, and the ability to react in a dangerous or hard situation’ </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>That fit Frodo rather well. He felt a smile spreading on his lips. It… fit him too. Somewhat. At least a little. Hedwig was right. As always. Her eyes sparkled like every time she found something amusing. Another quote was thrown in and he had to laugh again. He hadn’t laughed this much in… </span>
  <em>
    <span>ever</span>
  </em>
  <span> really. Hedwig could always make him laugh and he was a little amazed by that. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>‘Courage is found in unlikely places. By: J. R. R. Tolkien’ </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He was in high spirits. Only a week and five days until they took off towards Hogwarts. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>It was just… How was he supposed to get to London? </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">
  <span>xXXx</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>There were only three days left until September 1st when Hedwig finally gave him the okay to nudge his magic. He closed his eyes for scant thirty seconds (it had been an </span>
  <em>
    <span>hour</span>
  </em>
  <span> a week ago) before he was fully immersed in the feel of it. Carefully, slowly, he started… </span>
  <em>
    <span>directing</span>
  </em>
  <span> it’s flow from the center of his chest towards his stomach to his right leg. It worked. In fact it felt… </span>
  <em>
    <span>easy</span>
  </em>
  <span>. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>His stomach did a little flip and his concentration wavered, magic flowing back towards his chest in that moment. It took some seconds to get it back under control again. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>But he could do it! </span>
  <em>
    <span>He could do it!</span>
  </em>
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>It flowed like a river, vast and powerful and entirely </span>
  <em>
    <span>his</span>
  </em>
  <span> to move as he pleased. That was… satisfying. And scary. Terrifying. What could he </span>
  <em>
    <span>do</span>
  </em>
  <span> with this? Something amazing? Or something horrible? Hedwig would help him. He knew that and it immediately set him at ease. So what if he felt powerful, this feeling was also warm and gave him a sense of peace. If he held on to that peace… he could be happy for once. He could make </span>
  <em>
    <span>others</span>
  </em>
  <span> happy with this power too. Harry knew it. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He longed to be like that. A person who could help others, help people who would actually be </span>
  <em>
    <span>grateful</span>
  </em>
  <span> for it. A person who was </span>
  <em>
    <span>accepted</span>
  </em>
  <span> by others. Hedwig had already accepted him. Surely others, wizards, could too? </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The magic moved, sometimes jumping and swirling wildly, but he was in control this time. He could direct it, move it. It had always been a part of him. But this time, it was a part of his conscious will as well. He let it move back to his chest again, feeling warm and liberated like when he stretched out after waking up. Like all of him relaxing after a pleasant but strenuous day. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Harry opened his eyes a wide grin across his face and cheeks flushed with happy success. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I did it, Hedwig! I really </span>
  <em>
    <span>did it!</span>
  </em>
  <span>” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The owl looked satisfied and ruffled her feathers smugly, </span>
  <em>
    <span>proudly</span>
  </em>
  <span>. She was </span>
  <em>
    <span>proud</span>
  </em>
  <span> of him. A sudden flood of affection flashed through him and he laughed, reaching out to gently pull his friend in a very loose hug while very careful not to hurt her. </span>
  <em>
    <span>His</span>
  </em>
  <span> cheeks hurt, he was smiling so widely. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>A thick notebook floated up. The one they had been using for communication in the past six days. With a flourish, a black pen Hedwig had found along with it circled a pre-written sentence. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>‘We can do the ritual tomorrow’, and after that the details for said ritual and the end results it was supposed to have. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Harry had thought it impossible to grin wider but was, once again, proved wrong. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">
  <span>xXXx</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Hedwig, or her-as-Hedwig, worked in her mindscape with Rina right next to her. It was a pretty recent </span>
  <em>
    <span>big</span>
  </em>
  <span> skill and worked in… </span>
  <em>
    <span>most</span>
  </em>
  <span> dimensions. The thing was a work in progress. They had decided that it would be a house or castle inside an actual giant tree that would open up to a wild forest. Their mental defences were designed to disorient and keep out even the Mangekyou Sharingan, Yamanaka Inoichi, alien telepathy, and Charles Xavier so there was no way more inexperienced people were getting in. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>But the mindscape itself was a work in progress and for now they only had built the tree and the massive hall-like inside. A draft of a memory and record room was already there, locked behind even more security measures. After all, they had learned there was always </span>
  <em>
    <span>someone </span>
  </em>
  <span>more skilled or able to surprise them. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>In the mindscape was also the best place to bask in the young familiar bond she had formed with Harry. It was </span>
  <em>
    <span>warm</span>
  </em>
  <span> and soft and shone like the sun. The other side also felt like a calm sea. Like a calm before the storm. A storm of nervous energy that would erupt the moment things started going wrong again. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>They wanted to make sure that wouldn’t happen. At least not disastrously. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“So”, she said conversionally, “What do you think?” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>She looked like a little girl. A four-year-old to be exact. Her hair was chin-length and Luna-blonde but whiter and had wispy ends, skin was milky white light pink, lips had a red tint, and her clothes amounted to a simple white dress with black smudges and a wide sleeved silvery gray cloak over it. Looked like a witch’s robes really. Which was the wanted effect. Her eyes stayed the same golden amber, though a touch darker and more natural looking for a human. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Rina who </span>
  <em>
    <span>still</span>
  </em>
  <span> looked like Sakura, representing the girl she had become and hoped to always be, looked her over thoughtfully and nodded. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>As an owl she weighed just about 2 kg and was 55 cm in height. It wasn't </span>
  <em>
    <span>that</span>
  </em>
  <span> much of a stretch to add the 14 kg and 40 cm of an average 4-year-old. Of course, she would reduce baby fat with about three kg and add about two kg of muscle mass so her overall weight would be 15. Her height… maybe she could just add 35? So then the totals would be 15 kg and 90 cm. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>It was freaking </span>
  <em>
    <span>hard</span>
  </em>
  <span> to make yourself a </span>
  <em>
    <span>human</span>
  </em>
  <span> form even if she had been an animagus once or twice. At least animagi made themselves </span>
  <em>
    <span>smaller</span>
  </em>
  <span>. Usually. And even then it wasn’t the same as making oneself a human form because you didn’t </span>
  <em>
    <span>choose</span>
