    <p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>Well, I suppose the other shoe had to drop sooner or later</em>, Hermione thought as she stared, speechless, at the healer in front of her.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><em>Things were just going too well.</em></span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I’m sorry, Miss Granger,” Healer Smythe said softly, her eyes full of the pity Hermione hadn’t seen in years.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Of course, I’ll set a team of researchers to the task of finding a solution.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The healer paused and cleared her throat.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Should there be one.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Hermione could only nod.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When she’d decided to seek out a healer because she was feeling fatigued, she never could have imagined this was the reason.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Her worst case scenario was an unplanned pregnancy with her still-too-new-to-consider-a-baby boyfriend. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">If only.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Healer Smythe murmured her apologies again before she left Hermione to her thoughts.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was muscle memory that propelled Hermione off of the exam table and out of the room.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Waving mechanically to Padma Patil, who was passing by in her healers’ robes, she exited St. Mungo’s.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Hermione took a moment to breathe in the cool air of the London street, her heated cheeks finding slight relief in the late autumn chill.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>After a long moment and a few confused looks from muggles passing her by, she nodded to herself, took a deep breath, tightened the belt on her jacket and headed in the direction of the Ministry.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Just because she got incredibly troubling news didn’t mean that magical creatures didn’t need protection.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The walk back to work gave Hermione some time to clear her mind.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There was no way she would be able to process the news between the hospital and the Ministry, but she could start in on a plan.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Step One:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Keep it to yourself.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">It was really the only thought that Hermione was able to focus on as she dodged the muggles and smiled at the witches or wizards who called her name.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She wasn’t nearly as famous a Harry, thank goodness, but occasionally she was recognized when she went out.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It happened more often now, nearly as much as it did in the direct aftermath of the war, because her boyfriend tended to draw attention wherever he went.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">She supposed being in the Top Five of <em>Witch Weekly’s Most Eligible Wizards</em> list for three years running garnered a certain level of interest, more so when the wizard in question started a new relationship.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Instead of going through the public toilet, Hermione chose to enter through the red muggle phone booth, dialing 62442 and descending into the atrium.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">She was able to make it nearly to the lifts before running into one of her friends.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Before Angelina could get a word out, Hermione pasted on a large smile and said, “I heard George is throwing a party at the shop this weekend for the launch of a new product?”</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Angelina rolled her eyes and huffed a short laugh.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Yes, so he claims.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Not that he’s done a damn thing to plan it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I swear,” she added, her hand moving to rest on the growing swell of her stomach, “he just gets the ideas and makes Ron -“</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Hermione noticed Angelina’s cheeks heat as she cut herself off.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Really, Angie,” she said with her first real smile in what felt like years, “you can use his name.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We broke up <em>ages</em> ago.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In fact, I’m pretty sure he’s taken Harry with him to buy a ring for Padma. Merlin knows he can’t make that kind of decision on his own and he won’t admit that he needs help to me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And, you know,” Hermione added with a little smirk, “I’m seeing someone too.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“So that’s true then?” Angelina asked with interest as they stepped into the lift.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“You’re really dating …?”</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Draco Malfoy? Yeah,” Hermione confirmed, pleased that her cheeks didn’t heat up at the admission.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Still kind of new but, you know.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It’s good.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“You’ll have to tell me all about it this weekend,” Angelina said as the lift arrived at Level Four and Hermione made to step out.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“And it had better involve firewhiskey and a hot, hot shag!”</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Angelina!” Hermione hissed, whipping around to stare at her friend as a few of her coworkers wolf whistled.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Angelina just wiggled her fingers and the lift disappeared, the older woman’s laugh echoing in Hermione’s ears.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">With a bright red blush staining her cheeks, Hermione made her way to her office and shut the door to the rest of the department.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She wasn’t head of Control and Regulation of Magical Creatures yet, but she felt like the promotion wasn’t far off. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>Well, it hadn’t been … until now</em>, she thought bitterly as she removed her cloak and dropped into her seat.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Without giving herself the chance to fall into her feelings about what Hea;ter Smythe had told her, Hermione pulled a parchment in front of her and tried as hard as she could to focus on the draft legislation one of the younger employees working on werewolf rights had inked.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Unfortunately, her mind kept drifting back to St. Mungo’s and the news that the contrite-looking healer had delivered.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">A curse.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That’s what Healer Smythe had said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Hermione was being affected by a curse.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There was no name for it and Healer Smythe hadn’t been able to find any instances of someone else being treated at St. Mungo’s with similar results, so she had asked Hermione to sift through her mind for any time she’d been hit with anything unfamiliar.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It had taken her far longer than she wished to admit to remember that awful night in her fifth year, when Antonin Dolohov had been silenced but hit her with the purple curse and she’d woken up hours later with no knowledge of what had happened.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">A full gambit of tests and diagnostics were run on her and there was no specific diagnosis but a definite final outcome: Hermione was going to lose her magic completely, and had already lost some of her magical strength.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It wasn’t enough to make a difference in her ability to perform spells yet, but her magical core had dimmed minutely since her last visit to the hospital.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Why now, though?” she breathed to herself as she sat back in her seat, legislation abandoned.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“What changed to trigger the curse now?”</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Hermione wished she could trace back to exactly when the fatigue had started.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She knew it was more than a week but less than a month, but she couldn’t pinpoint the moment that she’d noticed the change.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She knew she could talk to Harry or Ron and see if one of them remembered anything specific that had happened in the last two to three weeks, but she knew they would both ask too many questions that she didn’t want to answer.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">And then there was Draco.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Their relationship was still somewhat new and they certainly weren’t the type to be clingy and spend all of their free time together, but she was pretty sure he would be able to narrow down any important events within the last month that could have triggered the curse.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>But should I even tell him</em>, she wondered to herself.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was obvious to her that their relationship was going to have to end if there was no cure for the effects of Dolohov’s curse.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Draco was a Malfoy, a member of the Sacred Twenty Eight, and the sole heir to his family’s name.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He <em>was</em> magic.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">They hadn’t done a formal “meet the family” dinner on either side, but Hermione was sure that his mother, as tolerant and changed as she might claim to be, would never accept her son having a lasting relationship with a muggle.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Her stomach turned as the impact of that word hit her.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Muggle.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She’d spent the first eleven years of her life not knowing there was anything else a person could be, then a beautiful thirteen years knowing she was special.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Now, at the too-young age of 24, she was faced with the possibility of going back to being a muggle, normal, nothing special at all.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Her own thoughts made her cringe.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Her parents were muggles; heck, her whole family were muggles.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There was absolutely <em>nothing wrong</em> with being a muggle.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The thing was, now that she knew what it was like to be different, special, powerful, she didn’t want to go back to the way things were before.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">A knock on the door made Hermione snap back to reality.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When she called for the knocker to come in, a genuine smile slipped onto her face when he did.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Harry,” she smiled.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“What are you doing up here?”</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Jessie said you had an appointment this morning,” he said, closing the door behind him and sitting in one of her spare seats.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Wouldn’t say where but Padma floo’d Ron, who floo’d me and, y’know, here I am.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“It’s nothing,” Hermione lied as convincingly as she could.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She knew Harry didn’t buy it fully, but he chose to nod instead of push her.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Just a general …” She waived her hand in a vague way over her chest and stomach.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Check up.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Very routine.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry arched a brow and lifted the edge of his lips.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“You’re the worst liar, Hermione.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The <em>worst</em>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But it’s obvious whatever it is, you’re not ready to tell me, so you can get away with it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For now.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Hermione knew he meant what he said; she was being permitted a free pass for now, but Auror Potter wouldn’t let her get away with it forever.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Luckily, Harry wasn’t one to push her too far when she wasn’t ready to speak about something; he knew she would just shut down and refuse to say anything at all out of sheer stubbornness if he tried too hard.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Thanks,” she said softly, a slight smile on her lips.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I just - have some things to figure out for myself before I’m ready to talk about it.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Are you -“ Harry started, a nearly imperceptible tremor in his voice.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Are you going to be okay?”</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">She took a couple of beats to consider his question before nodding once.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Yes, I’m going to be fine.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There were billions of muggles in the world; becoming one of them wasn’t going to kill her.</span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">That night, she stood in front of her mirror and let her eyes roam over her body.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She was in a pair of nice slacks and a deep blue shirt, not quite sure where she and Draco were going for dinner but knowing a pair of jeans wasn’t likely to match the dress code.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Hermione was tired, probably too tired to be going on a date, but she hadn’t been able to properly go out with Draco for nearly two weeks and she could admit that she missed him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Ten minute coffees or quick flow calls weren’t enough to sate her desire to see him.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">If someone had told her six months ago that she would look forward to going anywhere with Draco Malfoy, let alone on a date, she would have laughed in their face. </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">When Draco Malfoy had left the reserve team for the Appleby Arrows and taken a job in the front office of the Holyhead Harpies, everyone was surprised.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He hadn’t been a particularly popular quidditch player and only had a couple of chances with the main club before he decided to hang up his broom and make his way in another area of his favorite game.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Hermione was shocked he hadn’t gone into alchemy or something to do with politics, but the way Ginny spoke about him made her change her thoughts.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She hadn’t known him very well when they were children, after all.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">It was odd to everyone when Ginny brought him home to a Sunday dinner with the family, citing he needed somewhere to get a home cooked meal before he disappeared from lack of nutrition.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>George laughed and called her <em>Mum</em> for the rest of the day, but she didn’t seem to care.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She made it a point to bring Malfoy into conversations and shot her brothers or Harry dangerous looks if they dared to make a snide comment.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Hermione had needed a break from the stifling heat of the Burrow and gone out to sit at the small table in the garden shortly after their meal was finished.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It wasn’t more than twenty minutes before she was joined by Malfoy.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">
    <em>“Mind if I sit?” he asked a little breathlessly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“It’s …”</em>
  </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">
    <em>“Overwhelming?” she asked knowingly.</em>
  </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">
    <em>“A little,” he agreed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Not really used to …”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He waved a hand in the general direction of the house and Hermione completely understood.</em>
  </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">
    <em>“Yeah,” she smiled and pushed some of her bushy hair from her face.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’ve been coming for years and I still struggle with it all sometimes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>No shame in taking a breath.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Especially with the little one running around like crazy.”</em>
  </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">
    <em>“Not a fan of kids?” Malfoy asked with an arched brow.</em>
  </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">
    <em>“I - it’s not that,” Hermione denied.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“It’s just a lot when it’s all of the family, plus me and Harry and Luna, and you’re here too.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Jackie and Padma couldn’t come so that’s two fewer but Charlie keeps hinting he’s finally going to bring ‘round his new girlfriend and …” She exhaled and chuckled a little shakily.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I don’t know how anyone is comfortable in that house with everyone always hanging around.”</em>
  </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">
    <em>“Probably because you had a small family growing up; I did too.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We could breathe a lot better in our homes, I reckon.”</em>
  </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">
    <em>Nodding in agreement, Hermione smiled a bit.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Probably more room in yours than mine,” she teased.</em>
  </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">
    <em>“Yes well, you probably didn’t get lost in yours.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Thank goodness for house elves or I would have starved to death when I was six.”</em>
  </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">
    <em>Hermione shared a laugh with him, then paused to observe him for a moment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“You seem different,” she told him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Since we last spoke at that fundraiser for the school.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Lighter.”</em>
  </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">
    <em>“Thanks for noticing, Granger,” he grinned.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’ve been working out more.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He laughed at the look that was on her face.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I feel better than I did then.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I was reserve in Appleby, still trying to prove I’m not the same kid who made some pretty spectacular mistakes, and work through a rocky break up.”</em>
  </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>“Astoria Greengrass,” Hermione nodded.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“The </em>Prophet<em> was all over you about that.”</em></span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">
    <em>Malfoy rolled his eyes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Not as bad as they were with you and Weasley,” he acknowledged.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Thankfully.”</em>
  </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">
    <em>Hermione nodded.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“It’s nice being past all that.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Nothing interesting in the life of a Ministry grunt.”</em>
  </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">
    <em>“Nor in the life of a quidditch manager.”</em>
  </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">
    <em>They shared another smile before the brothers, Harry and Ginny burst out the doors with brooms in hand and a nod towards the orchards.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Malfoy, you in?” Charlie asked.</em>
  </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">
    <em>He looked at her and she shrugged and motioned for him to go.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Don’t fall off your broom.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Padma’s not here to heal you,” she grinned, standing as well.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“And I’ve no inclination to help any showboaters.”</em>
  </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">
    <em>“Showboaters!” Harry exclaimed, wrapping an arm around her and tugging her close.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I’ll show you showboaters!”</em>
  </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">
    <em>Hermione shook her head and met Malfoy’s eyes, sharing a small smile before they all took off for the makeshift quidditch pitch.</em>
  </span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Granger?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You, uh, you home?”</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Malfoy’s voice pulled her from her memory and she forced out a bright, “Coming!” before heading out of her bedroom to meet him by the fireplace.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Hi.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Malfoy stood on the rug in front fo the hearth in a pair of dress slacks and a black collared shirt, a smile on his face and his hair only slightly disheveled.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“You look nice,” he told her, reaching a hand out to her.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She placed her hand in his and he brought it to his lips for a light kiss.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“What’s the occasion?”</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Smiling honestly, then feigning nonchalance, she lifted a shoulder in a shrug.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Just dinner with some bloke,” she told him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Nothing important.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Got a better offer for me?”</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Malfoy hummed and used the hand he still held to tug her closer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>His hands slid around to her lower back and he leaned down so his lips were nearly touching hers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“I can think of a few,” he whispered.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Grinning, Hermione looped around his neck.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Please feel free to share,” she breathed just before he kissed her.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">As she started backing them towards her bedroom, grinning against his mouth, she pushed the horrible news from earlier in the day from her mind and decided to focus on <em>him</em> and <em>now</em>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She could deal with losing her magic tomorrow.</span>
