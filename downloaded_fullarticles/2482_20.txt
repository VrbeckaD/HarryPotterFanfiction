    <p>“Afternoon, Mr. Graves, sir!”</p><p>“Afternoon, Abernathy.”</p><p>It takes a moment for Newt, and granted he's a little preoccupied because he’s just been taken into MACUSA for Section 3A or other, whatever that is but—</p><p>Newt turns, his attention snapping toward to the suddenly, achingly familiar man coming up from behind him.</p><p>"Sorry," Newt interrupts, his gaze darting back and forth between the two men. "Did you say—I mean, are you Percival Graves?"</p><p>Goldstein gives him an annoyed, helpless look, and Newt’s shoulders hunch. His eyes dart towards the man to take him in, and now that he's actually really looking he can recognize him now. He’s much more imposing in real life, almost devastatingly handsome, really. The years-old newspaper article that Theseus had sent him long ago seems to burn in his chest pocket, and Newt can feel his face heat up. He should have recognized him earlier when Goldstein had brought him before the Investigative Team. </p><p>"Yes, Mr. Graves, and this is—"</p><p>"Newton Scamander," Newt interrupts once more, unable to hold it in. His eyes flick upwards in an effort to actually meet his soulmate's gaze, and so he sees <em> it </em> perfectly. There's a moment of blankness, an incomprehension that doesn't fit with what Newt has observed in all his years during a first meeting of soulmates. He doesn’t recognize Newt’s name. It's only a moment, but it's enough to send Newt reeling with doubt, his gut dropping.</p><p>Then surprised recognition comes over those stern features, delayed as it is, and the look on Percival Graves' face is more familiar now. Newt has seen it dozens of times, especially during his first year when his year mates would introduce or be introduced to their soulmates. He feels himself relax and a shy, strained smile blooms on his face as he ducks his head. He holds out his hand, his marked wrist upwards, the traditional presenting he learned as a child.</p><p>"Oh!" Goldstein gasps, pressing a hand to her mouth. Abernathy's jaw drops in blatant shock. Newt twitches, but keeps his attention on his soulmate, holding his breath. Newt wasn't quite sure how magical Americans did it, wasn’t sure what the proper way to present oneself to one’s soulmate was here, but—</p><p>Graves takes his hand exactly the way Newt was taught, his broad hand covering the worn leather band around Newt's wrist. Newt’s own palm tingles where it meets Graves’ own wristband, the silver of it sleek and elegant, and he can’t help but smile, his heart fluttering.</p><p>When Graves smiles back, it’s cold and sharp.</p><p>Oh.</p><p>Newt’s smile freezes on his face.</p><p>“It’s a pleasure to finally meet you, Mr. Scamander,” Graves says, and his eyes are just as cold as his smile.</p><p>“Yes,” Newt says dimly. "Call me Newt." He looks away and takes his hand back as quickly as he can without it seeming rude, a chill making its way down his spine. Graves doesn’t even look fazed, only turns to Goldstein with a raised eyebrow.</p><p>“And Tina, what are you doing with Mr. Scamander here?”</p><p>Newt winces. Goldstein, to her credit, gives him a sideways glance and grants him a semi-apologetic look before she steps forward towards Graves and then barely hesitates to inform him about how Newt has, quote-unquote, a ‘crazy creature in his case that caused mayhem in a bank.’</p><p>Newt doesn’t blame her. Just because Newt’s soulmate is the Director of Magical Security, that doesn't mean that Newt gets off scot-free off a magical creature violation during when, he later learns, New York is in the midst of a magical creature situation themselves.</p><p>Newt fiddles with the ends of his sleeves and barely manages not to flinch underneath Graves’ bemused look. He feels his cheeks heat up in embarrassment and he sighs to himself. Not a very good first impression on one's soulmate, he supposed.</p><p>“Let’s see the little guy,” Graves orders.</p><p>Newt stammers out a protest, but then Goldstein grabs his case and lays it out. His shoulders slump with resignment, and he can only watch as Goldstein opens up his case and reveals—</p><p>Pastries.</p><p>Newt stares. He finds that he can't find it in himself to really care about what Percival Graves thinks anymore, and his wariness at that sharp, cold smile and those dead eyes pushes itself to the side. He has bigger things to worry about.</p><p>(And so, after years and years of beating around the bush, or around the world in Newt's case, thus ends the very first meeting between Newt and his soulmate.</p><p>It's fairly anti-climatic, really. After four years of avoiding the New York area like a plague in fear of obligation to stay, Graves lets him leave with only Newt's flimsy promise to come back, looking all too eager to postpone an actual conversation between the two of them.</p><p>Newt tries not to feel hurt at that.)</p><p> </p><p align="center">*</p><p> </p><p>"So, what's he like?" Newt eventually asks Tina. His brother had been steadily communicating with Newt's soulmate for almost a year now, but almost always in the capacity of Director Graves and Head Auror Scamander. Their very first correspondence, in fact, Theseus had forwarded to Newt, along with a request of Newt's permission for Theseus to at least give Graves a little hint.</p><p>Of course, Newt had refused. Theseus had already practically begged him to go to New York years prior when Graves had first been announced as the new Director of Magical Security. Newt had hesitated and dawdled even then. He wasn't ready, he told Theseus, he had creatures to save and things to do.</p><p>"Mr. Graves?" Tina says, and Newt ducks his head as he nods. He fiddles with his wand, shifting slightly in discomfort as Tina um-ed, and ah-ed.</p><p>"Well, he's very powerful," Tina starts off, pursing her lips. "Very, ah, stern. To be honest, most of us assumed he didn't have a soulmate."</p><p>"Oh," Newt murmurs.</p><p>"He's rather… old, you see, and he's never mentioned it before."</p><p>"Oh yes, my parents have always assumed he'd be at least ten years older, some of their friends were quite worried," Newt agrees amiably. "But he must be in his late 30's? Or Early 40's, maybe—I’m not saying he looks old, he’s quite fit but—"</p><p>"43." Tina sounds amused and she pauses, blinking to herself before she seems to reorient herself, nodding slightly. "Of course, you would have been born already marked. That makes sense. I wonder why he hadn't written to you then, he would have been of age already by the time he got your mark."</p><p>Newt wilts at that and he can't help but frown, old hurts coming back in the way they do. "So it's true then? You Americans write to your intended? I've always, ah, found that very odd.” Along with their backwards laws about Muggles, but Newt will hold off on spouting that particular opinion until he has to. Tina already doesn’t seem as if she likes him, and Newt isn’t particularly keen on irritating her even more.</p><p>"Those raised in our world, at least. I can’t imagine being a Nomaj. It must be hard for them without Owls."</p><p>Newt bobs his head in agreement and scratches the side of his neck. "We British folk prefer a more natural meeting. A struggle before meeting makes for a more powerful bond, they say. I can't imagine just simply writing to your soulmate, it feels like cheating, don’t you think?"</p><p>“Well,” Tina says dismissively, “maybe that’s why it took so long for you two to meet then.”</p><p>Newt stops at that and then stares at her.</p><p>“Oh,” Tina says, stumbling slightly. She reddens. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean for it to come out like that.”</p><p>Newt’s jaw tightens and he ducks his head. He exhales, long and slow, before he looks up and smiles thinly at her. “No, it’s fine.”</p><p>He continues walking again, and this time it’s Tina who’s struggling to keep up with him, apologetic expression still fixed on her face. Newt sighs and glances at her guiltily before he looks away.</p><p>“I guess you’re right,” he says quietly. “I <em> am </em>the one who kept him waiting.”</p><p> </p><p align="center">*</p><p> </p><p>The majority of children are born without a soulmark. Newt Scamander is an exception.</p><p>“Oh,” one of the midwives murmur in surprise, a smile blooming on her lips as she spots the dark ink on the baby’s wrist. She cleans off the blood hiding it from view, her smile widening as the full mark is revealed.</p><p>Percival Graves, it reads.</p><p>The midwives croon to themselves in joy as they pass the baby to his mother’s chest, in love as most are with the idea that the baby’s soulmate is already waiting for him, already old enough to be writing.</p><p>Newt Scamander was born already belonging to someone, already loved, and for some, maybe that would be a comfort. For others, as they grew up, maybe they'd find it stifling.</p><p>For Newt, it would simply be another oddity in his already odd life.</p><p>The penmanship that spelled out his soulmate's name at the time of his birth was one of an adolescent, no longer the wavering script of a child. Not the clean, elegant script that Newt eventually lives with when he's older either, but it's well on its way.</p><p>"At least ten years older,” his parents’ closest friends speculate once they see it, some frowning a bit. Ten years would be turn out to be a generous estimate because as Newt eventually learns, Percival Graves is thirteen years older than him.</p><p>“One of the Original Twelve of MACUSA,” his pureblood grandparents murmur in approval.</p><p>“When can I play with him?” Theseus petulantly asks, eight years old and uncaring of silly little things like soulmarks.</p><p>As for his parents, all they were really concerned about was the mere fact that their son had a soulmate. That was all that mattered, they said to each other. Everything else would fall into place.</p><p>(Eventually.)</p><p> </p><p align="center">*</p><p align="center"> </p><p>"Come on, Newt," Leta prods, nudging his side. If she was anyone but Leta, Newt would call the look on her face a pout. However, pouting is above Leta Lestrange, or so she says, so Newt just smiles.</p><p>"I'll show you mine. It's only fair, isn't it?" Leta adds mischievously. Newt tugs at his wristband self-consciously and ducks his head.</p><p>"I don't know, Leta," he replies plaintively. He looks up at her through his fringe and softens. He hesitates, just a bit before he sighs and holds out his marked wrist. His wristband is brown and unassuming, clean leather instead of the more flashy jewelry that most purebloods wear. Newt finds that most animals prefer it though and it’s easy enough to make a switch to. His whole family prefers the brown themself, especially with the hippogriffs on their property.</p><p>Leta perks up and presses in closer towards him, her scent filling his nose, and Newt's face heats up. Flustered, he quickly taps his wand on his wristband and watches as it crawls back to reveal his mark.</p><p>"Huh," Leta says in surprise, tilting her head. She reads it out, slow and deliberate enough to make Newt embarrassed even if he doesn't know why. "Percival Graves."</p><p>"Yeah," Newt mutters. With a flick of his wand, his wrist is covered once more and Newt quickly tucks it back to his side.</p><p>With a careless air, Leta unlocks her own wristband, hers a more traditional, beautiful silver and shoves it under his nose.</p><p>Oh. Newt blinks.</p><p>"Well, now you've seen it," Leta says briskly, casually. She covers her bare, unmarked wrist once more and smiles at him tightly.</p><p>Newt licks his dry lips, and then hesitantly, he offers, "Theseus doesn't have one either." It isn't his place to be spreading his brother's status, but he's sure Theseus wouldn't really mind. He's already working for the Aurors and Newt knows Theseus hasn't even bothered to check his wrist in years. "And we're only 14."</p><p>"I hope I never get one," Leta declares as she tosses her hair back. She avoids Newt's eyes. "I have no need for soulmarks, and I have no desire to be bound to one person for the rest of my life."</p><p>"I think it's nice," Newt quietly replies, hunching into himself. "Mother said I was born already loved."</p><p>"Oh, don't be silly Newt," Leta sighs. "You should know by now that's not true."</p><p>Newt's gut twisted. One of his father's friends had mentioned long ago that American purebloods had a silly little tradition of writing letters addressed to the names on their wrists. He had insulted it then. How lazy these Americans must be, he said, to have an Owl do the finding for them.</p><p>Newt's father had glanced at him. He said nothing even as they both wondered why Percival Graves had not written.</p><p> </p><p align="center">*</p><p align="center"> </p><p>"Theseus?" Newt calls out quietly. His brother is standing by the window, the moonlight illuminating his pale skin, his ginger hair bleached in it. Theseus jumps, already spelling his wristband shut once more. Newt gets a glimpse of still blank skin and he draws back, hesitating. Theseus pays his hesitance no mind though and simply smiles at him, motioning him in.</p><p>Newt pads into his brother's room and stands beside him, shoulder to shoulder even if Newt isn't quite as tall as Theseus. He touches his own wristband self-consciously, his head tilted up in watchful wariness of his brother.</p><p>He doesn’t quite know what to say or what to do, and so he stays silent as Theseus gazes out the window, his hand gentle on his own unmarked wrist. He has no words of comfort for his older brother because, while Newt had grown up with his wrist already marked, Theseus did not. It wasn't uncommon. Both boys wore a wristband around their wrists for propriety's sake, but as they continued to grow up, it became increasingly obvious that it was only Theseus who regularly checked his wrist for any change.</p><p>Most children get their marks from five to ten years old as their peers learned to write their names and begin to associate that particular combination of letters as something that defined them. There are children, of course, as young as 3 or 4 that could copy the letters of their name, but until they learned that these letters were the same as the sounds that made up their name, until they identified these letters as <em> them</em>, it meant nothing.</p><p>Newt used to think nothing of it at the time. He was such a child then. He had only watched with an idle sort of curiosity as Theseus did his ritual of checking—nightly before, but the older he got, the less he had bothered. His melancholy tonight, and seeing him check struck Newt as odd. Theseus was already twenty-five, and Newt knew that the last time his brother checked was… He frowned to himself. It must have been Newt's second year at Hogwarts then, five years ago when his brother was twenty.</p><p>"Your soulmate must have waited quite a bit for you, huh?" Theseus breaks the peaceful silence between them. He tilts his head towards Newt and gives him a sad sort of smile. There was an odd vulnerability to him, one that Newt hadn't seen in so long. His brother had always figured himself as a guardian, as a protector to his much younger brother, and he couldn't be that and act weak around Newt.</p><p>Newt blinks and he looks away, his eyes catching on the hippogriffs Theseus must have been staring at during his silence. He couldn't deny that he had thought about it, about how long his soulmate must have waited, how he surely must have given up a bit before a five-year-old Newt had finally learned how to write his own name.  His soulmate must have been at least fifteen years old then, only a little younger than Newt now.</p><p>"He's still waiting," Newt chooses to say, and Theseus snorts at that.</p><p>In truth, Newt's early soul mark was reason enough for Theseus to accept the possibility of a much younger soulmate. Even as his year mates met their matches, even as late bloomers finally received their marks, Theseus had still held on with grim hope, had held on longer than anyone else would normally have.</p><p>The majority of the population gain their marks by fifteen, but as Theseus' 15th birthday went by and left his wrist still unmarked, Theseus barely faltered.  Their parents had already long accepted it, even before Theseus himself.</p><p>Theseus turns to him again, his gaze strangely intent. "You must know about the War going on."</p><p>Newt shifts at that before he nods. "Yes… The Muggles. Mother is quite worried."</p><p>"It isn't right." Theseus shakes his head, his jaw tight. "It isn't fair that Minister Evermonde is forbidding us from taking part while all those people suffer."</p><p>There's something decisive in his eyes that makes Newt's eyes widen, and his mouth falls open.</p><p>"<em>Theseus</em>," he whispers, practically begs, "You can't possibly be thinking of joining the war effort."</p><p>Theseus' lips thin and it's answer enough. Newt reels back, his features paling, his head shaking in denial. His fingers dig themselves into each other, leaving half-moon impressions on his skin.</p><p>At this point, maybe others would call his brother a Gryffindor.</p><p>They’d be wrong. Theseus Scamander was a Hufflepuff through and through and he was joining the war because it was right, because it was <em> fair</em>, not because of visions of valor and victory.</p><p>"There's all these people with marks on their wrist, a few who still haven't met their soulmates, and here I am, unmarked. They have so much ahead of them,” Theseus tells him quietly. He reaches out and wraps his hands around Newt’s wrists, his palm warm against Newt’s band, and Newt’s features twist in pain. Theseus gives him a small, gentle smile. “I have nothing to lose.”</p><p>Theseus gives him a long, drawn-out hug and for once, Newt actually hugs him back, tight and desperate. By the time the sun rose the next morning, he was already gone.</p><p>And Newt, a few months later at seventeen and so <em> so </em> afraid, had promptly caught up and joined the war effort. If only so he could stand before his brother, even as Theseus had paled at the sight of him, and say, "No. You have plenty to lose."</p><p> </p><p align="center">*</p><p align="center"> </p><p>"Newt," Theseus writes to him one day. "I'm not quite sure where you are now, but when you're done with whatever it is you're doing… You should visit New York."</p><p>Newt blinks. He turns his attention to the newspaper page that Theseus had included in his letter and immediately, his breath catches. </p><p>PERCIVAL GRAVES NEW DIRECTOR OF MAGICAL SECURITY </p><p>His grip tightens on the lone page of the New York Ghost, his eyes darting over the article and the picture that takes up most of the space. The man that must be Percival Graves is handsome, a sternness in his features that immediately catches Newt's eye. Newt already knew that his soulmate was older but he can’t help but be surprised anyway. </p><p>Graves doesn't smile in the photo, only steadily meets Newt's eyes before he looks away to shake the President's hands. Newt slumps in his seat and he releases a low breath, eyes still wide as he goes over his soulmate's features, his confident posture.</p><p>Shakily, he reaches up behind his ear where his wand is tucked and he taps it on his wristband. It releases silently, crawling back to reveal his bare skin. Percival Graves, his wrist still says, just as it's done for the past 25 years. Newt swallows. His eyes trace over the elegant script, taking in the dips and peaks of the clean penmanship. It matches the man in the photo perfectly, fitting the put together and neat quality that Newt had imagined before. In contrast, his own messy script must look truly out of place on his soulmate's wrist. </p><p>He had wondered for years what kind of man Percival Graves was to be a supposedly perfect match for him. Seeing a picture of him now, Newt can't help but squirm slightly. An Auror, just like his brother. Stern. Strict. Ambitious, career-focused, and goal-oriented.</p><p>Where would Newt fit in? </p><p>He turns around to take in the inside of his case and he can't help but see the mess and the abundance of creatures in a new light now. He tries to imagine the stern man in the photo standing beside him, or standing in the midst of his (sometimes illegal) creatures, or with him during his (sometimes illegal) adventures and he finds that he can't. </p><p>He tries to imagine himself in the Ministry or in MACUSA, working a desk job or consulting on creatures like how Theseus had suggested. Just the thought of being restricted to one place for too long already makes him squeamish, and he knows that he can't either, not for long, not again. The year he had spend in House-Elf Relocation had been bad enough, thanks.</p><p>Newt puts down Theseus' letter and takes one last, long glance at the newspaper article. He looks up, his eyes catching on the injured graphorn he had just taken in days ago, who surely would have died if Newt hadn't rescued him from poachers, and he nods decisively to himself.</p><p>Surely his soulmate could wait a little while longer. </p><p>It is with little regret that he folds up his soulmate's photo, and tucks it in to his pocket.</p><p>"The work is never done," he writes back to his brother. "New York can wait a little while, can't it?"</p>
