    <p>It was time for another year at Hogwarts and all of the students were excited. I mean, who wouldn't be excited about another year of witches, wizards, and magical beasts! Merlin, however, was pretty grumpy. He had been trying out a new spell and had fallen asleep for what was apparently over 1000 bloody years! All of a sudden he wakes up and there are things like cars and cell phones and what-not. Not to mention a thing called a train.</p>
<p>The train Merlin was currently on was a blinding shade of red. The first thing (well third, his bladder had been waiting for three hundred years and man had he been hungry!) he had done was check on the development of the wizarding world. It had really gone downhill! He had even slept through an entire wizarding war concerning blood purity of all things. And it had just ended less than a year before he had awoken! He could never imagine prejudice against fellow magic users based on something so flimsy as blood, when it didn't seem so long ago that they had all been hunted as a whole by Uther.</p>
<p>Not to mention the fact that the entire branch of magical folk in Britain had become completely independent upon wands. When he had first invented wands to help the more mediocre magic users channel their power, he had never guessed that they would eventually be used for everything.</p>
<p>Then he had read up on what had happened in more detail. While in a store called "Flourish and Blotts" he had overheard a young girl asking about where the books for Hogwarts were. Merlin had instantly grasped onto the idea of Hogwarts. What better place to learn than a school? He had been there only twice before. The first time was when he helped the founders turn the abandoned castle into a school. The second was many years later when he dropped by to visit and was sorted into Slytherin by what Godric had called "The Sorting Hat". </p>
<p>Merlin hurried to the nearest owlery and had, for a small fee, sent the current Headmistress of Hogwarts a letter claiming to be a transfer student. (Bless the Old Religion the goblins didn't question him accessing his vaults) He had written he was home schooled before his parents were killed in the war. Later that week he received a letter stating that if he was able to pass a few tests they would happily accept him as a 7th year.</p>
<p>He had passed their tests with flying colors after they had a teacher who met with him asking basic questions all seventh years were expected to know. He then had to transfigure a napkin into a parrot and brew a potion that, while new to him, was well within his range.</p>
<p>That brought him here. He was sitting in a small room on the so called ‘train’ thinking about all of the things he had missed in his sleep. He jolted when the train gave a loud noise and then began to move. Honestly all of this new technology was giving him a headache. So many things that could only have been achieved by magic were now capable with science and new inventions. He had even seen a flying machine the other day.</p>
<p>He was snapped out of his musing by the door of his room opening. Standing in the doorway was a girl with dirty blonde hair and radishes hanging from her earlobes. It looked as though there was metal hanging them there. Wouldn't that hurt?</p>
<p>"Hello" He said to break the awkward silence."My name is Marvin."</p>
<p>"My name is Luna" She said quietly as she almost danced her way into the room. "You wouldn't mind if I sat here would you?" She looked at him in such a way Merlin felt as if she was staring into his soul.</p>
<p>"Umm, no, I don't mind. Go ahead." Maybe some company would do him good.</p>
<p>"You know, sleep is good for the soul. Just because the world moves while you slumber does not mean it strays from its course." Luna said softly.</p>
<p>Merlin sat straight up and looked her in the eyes. "What do you mean by that" He said slowly.</p>
<p>"I mean only that though while somethings appearance has changed, that does not mean that it itself is any different." She said with a small smile gracing her face.</p>
<p>Merlin, for the first time, looked at Luna. Really looked. When he felt her aura he gasped. "You're a-"</p>
<p>The door of the compartment slammed open.</p>
