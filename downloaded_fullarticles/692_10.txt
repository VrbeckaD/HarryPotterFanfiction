    <p>Petunia Evans was alone. </p><p>Then she wasn’t. </p><p>Her little sister, Lily was perhaps one of the best things to happen, Petunia thought. The night Petunia first met her little sister Lily Evans’ was hands down her favorite and first memory ever, (even though Petunia herself was indeed very young when they first met). As they grew, Petunia adored Lily. She was beautiful like the princesses their mother would read to them at night, and privately thought that Lily was strong like the princes in the story too. She was abnormal that way, but beautifully so. Lily quickly started looking up towards Petunia, as Petunia adored her little sister. Petunia’s parents were delighted by the behavior of the eldest daughter. </p><p>“Attached at the hip”, their mother would say.<br/>
“A pair of two peas in a pod”, their father would exclaim.<br/>
All Petunia could do was agree wholeheartedly and adore her little sister even more. </p><p>Time passed and soon the girls were 10 and 8 respectively. Petunia was working hard to excel in school, and with Lily, made small yearnings from the baking competitions they would help her mother win. With enough money saved up, they begged their parents to allow them to buy whatever they wanted. And with permission, Lily had gone and spent all her money on new toys she desired. The living room was filled with exactly 14 of them, none of which Petunia was allowed to touch. Which was fair to Petunia. And again, with permission, Petunia went alone and saw her first-ever movie in town. 007, a movie about spies and espionage. She loved it. But what Petunia loved the most about the movie was the beautiful woman that had dominated the screen. That made the audience ooh and ahh. Afterward, when she came home she asked her mother who the lady was, and found out she was a popular Hollywood model.  </p><p>A model, she thought to herself. I want to be a model. A beautiful model.<br/>
It quickly became Petunia’s latest obsession. </p><p>And her parents were delighted with the idea. “You can do anything you put your mind too, Pet.” Her family had told her. And she did. All-day she would think about being a model, in a bid to hopefully become the beautiful woman on screen. She practiced the catwalks she saw on TV and the poses on the magazines at home. Figuring out, and making effective hair masks using items from the garden. Asking every woman she knew for their own beauty tips. It seemed to annoy Lily somewhat by her obsession. But it would never fail to make her parents laugh when Petunia would teasingly ask Lily to come with her into town to get magazines and the new COMOS edition. Lily’s face would turn sour like a lemon. And Petunia’s mind was soon filled by the obsession she had with modeling.</p><p>And then the new family had moved in. And this would be the start of a new obsession in Petunia’s mind. The Prince family.<br/>
It was raining the day they moved in, Petunia remembered. She remembered because she had on her old yellow raincoat and had been trying to save the roses for the rose-water bath she had been planning on doing. And that's when she saw him. A little black-haired boy around Lily’s age, with a crooked nose, helping who could only be his mother move furniture into the old house by the end of the street. </p><p>In moved this boy with his mother and father. The boy was delightfully shy and his mother tired, but kind. With a father who- Petunia noticed -enjoyed his drink. Just like their aunt Edna.<br/>
Though they had not seen aunt Edna in three years. Wonder why that was? </p><p>But the Prince family soon became something of interest to her parents, after one Tuesday afternoon when all the kids and parents in the neighborhood heard the shouting from inside the house. Causing parents to usher their kids inside up into their rooms and the street to go silent. And for the first time since she had seen 007, Petunia started thinking to herself about something different. She wondered and soon became obsessed with questions. What could have happened that day?  What was said, and what was done? And her parents! Her parents were so interested in the family after that day. What did they hear to have caused Petunia’s father to grip her shoulder tight when she answered the door the next day to Mr. Prince, and the way her dad stiffly spoke to Mr. Prince when telling him ‘’Your dresser broke the other day? Let me go fetch my toolbox.’’  To cause Petunia’s mother to whisper into Lily’s ear about making friends her age, and to invite the boy over. </p><p>Petunia soon became interested like her parents about the family. About the Prince boy. Wondering what he was like and wondered why her mother cared so much for him. He wasn’t family, it didn’t make sense. That frustrated Lily to no end. Who cared not for her parents focus on the Prince boy. And threw many fits around the house in a bid to stop talking about the ugly, greasy boy who lives with equally ugly, greasy parents. </p><p>(It would be a few more months into school before Petunia would hear about bird watching. Where people would stand very still up in the trees and watch for birds.)<br/>
And soon Petunia had an idea about what to do about the Prince family, and to finally find out all that she could about the boy and family in question.<br/>
So one day while in the woods, with her sister and other kids from the neighborhood playing, she snuck off back to the big tree where across was the Prince’s house in clear sight. She climbed up the tree and leaned against the forward branch with her arms stretched out in front of her, Leaning forward to get a better sight she did not notice the creak and groan of the wood as the branch of the tree snapped with a loud sound.  </p><p>Petunia’s voice caught in her throat as she fell down, the air swooshing past her ears sounded like the roaring of the lions from books, and inside her body, her stomach had dropped. </p><p>Then time froze. </p><p>At least she thinks it froze? She was not moving down anymore! The branch hit the ground with a low thud and Petunia suddenly realized that she was floating an arm away from the ground! Her mind exclaimed.<br/>
The shuffling of feet was heard and Petunia had the grace to look up. The Prince’s boy was holding up his two hands and his face twisted into a grimace. She noticed the sweat pouring off his head as he seemed to be struggling to open his mouth. </p><p>“...Get... r- rea-” was all he managed to utter before like a tossed stone into a lake, Petunia dropped to the ground with a solid thud. The wind was knocked from out of her body as she tried to gasp for breath and also in shock as floating an arm up from the ground, was admittedly, not something she often experienced. The Prince boy was also gasping from breath, seemingly exhausted and had a somewhat strange, frightened look on his face. As if he couldn’t believe what he had done. (Later, Petunia would find out that he couldn’t believe he had shown magic to a muggle and not the original thought of he discovered he could levitate people and save sneaky, little girls from falling out of trees.) </p><p>And so Petunia sat in shock and stared at the boy for what seemed like hours until words finally popped into her mind.<br/>
