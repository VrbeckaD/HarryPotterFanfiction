  <b>A = Aftercare (What they’re like after sex)</b>
</p><p>Let us be clear: Alastor Moody is not a man who will let just anyone into his bed. While he’s paid for sex before (it was in fact, his preferred method), he would have to love you in order to let you into his home. Knowing this, it’s no surprise that Alastor can be surprisingly tender. Are you alright, love? Did he hurt you? (He’s a big man, after all.) Do you need anything? He’ll stroke your hair, studying your expression. Once satisfied, he’ll hold you close, lips pressed against the crown of your hair as you talk about secret things.</p><p>
  <b>B = Body part (Their favorite body part and also their partner’s)</b>
</p><p><em>His scars.</em> They’re visible testaments to the life he’s survived. They remind you he’s paranoid for a reason, making his trust in you all the sweeter. </p><p><em>Your neck.</em> Whether it’s leaving hickeys or watching your fluttering pulse, Alastor can’t resist your soft skin. Rather than cupping your nape in a dominant move, he prefers to massage the base of your skull during meetings. He is, after all, well aware how worried you can get during mission plans. And whenever you’re in bed simply talking until the wee hours in the morning, he’ll cup the side of your neck, using his thumb to stroke your jaw.</p><p>
  <b>C = Cum (Anything to do with cum basically…I’m a disgusting person)</b>
</p><p>Inside you. Alastor’s very traditional. Wanting him to cum on you? He may be resistant. Coming form a pureblood family, Alastor has old ideas about sex. If anything, prepare for him to immediately cast a cleaning spell afterwards, as he’d feel as though he’d desecrated something sacred. (He’d view you as the purest person he’s ever met, regardless of your faults.)</p><p>
  <b>D = Dirty Secret (Pretty self explanatory, a dirty secret of theirs)</b>
</p><p>The first time Alastor was injured during your stay at Grimauld Place, you’d been horrified by how much pain he endured on a daily basis. It was the first time you were brave enough to actually stand up to the seasoned warrior. <em>“I don’t care who you are, you’re going to sit down and let me help you!”</em> You’d snapped. Being a caring person by nature, you’d started to worry over him whenever he went on missions. Needless to say, he noticed. </p><p>Back to the present, Alastor has a secret weakness for having you fuss over him. </p><p>
  <b>E = Experience (How experienced are they? Do they know what they’re doing?)</b>
</p><p>While it may be hard for most to believe, Alastor is rather experienced. Remember: he wasn’t always covered in scars. While you’ll always adamantly see him as handsome in his own rough way; before the first wizarding war, he was considered highly attractive. Between his stern mannerisms and Scottish brogue, women couldn’t resist him. Still, Alastor has always been naturally reserved. While he has experience, ‘making love’ is new territory to this guarded man.</p><p>
  <b>F = Favorite Position (This goes without saying. Will probably include a visual)</b>
</p><p>Missionary. Why? Your eyes. They’re so open and expressive—he can read you like a book. Whenever he’s making love to you, he loves loosing himself in your expressions of love and desire. He just can’t believe anyone, let alone you would truly want to be with him.</p><p>
  <b>G = Goofy (Are they more serious in the moment, or are they humorous, etc.)</b>
</p><p>He’s not overly serious, yet neither is he goofy. He cares about your comfort. If you’re not ready to have sex with him, he’d much rather wait until you are. If anything, Alastor is sweetly tender. You’re the only person alive who’s seen this side of him. You can feel his love just by the way he caresses and holds you.</p><p>
  <b>H = Hair (How well groomed are they, does the carpet match the drapes, etc.)</b>
</p><p>He’s not one for pomp and circumstance. Whatever gets the job done is what he’ll choose. Besides, he’s got much more important things to worry about. Luckily, magic makes personal grooming infinitely easier. He’s also somewhat malleable in this regard. After all, you’re the only person to see that part of him. If you’d prefer he try a different routine, he’d comply.</p><p>
  <b>I = Intimacy (How are they during the moment, romantic aspect…)</b>
</p><p>Alastor knows he can be…well, less than the romantic dream. But when you’re intimate, he’d open up to show you a side of him no one knew existed. You hold a special place in his heart—one reserved solely for you. As such, you deserve all the love and warmth he can provide. Expect <em>lots</em> of soft, vulnerable admissions of love as he trails kisses across your neck. He’ll hold you close, keeping you safe and cherished.</p><p>
  <b>J = Jack Off (Masturbation headcannon)</b>
</p><p>While he may be many things, Alastor’s still a man with needs. That being said, war has taken a toll on this Auror. As you may be aware, mental illness can heavily impact one’s libido. Simply put, when Alastor’s left with his thoughts, they’re more likely to fall into the pit of horrific memories.</p><p></p><blockquote>
  <p>Thus, he tends to bottle it up, resulting in lots of sex with you.</p>
</blockquote><p>
  <b>K = Kink (One or more of their kinks)</b>
</p><p>He’s a dominant man, thus making you beg will always heat his blood. Marking and claiming is another thing. Seeing you sporting a hickey for all to see? <em>Yes</em>. He’ll just sit back in his chair, not even <em>trying</em> to mask his smirk. </p><p></p><blockquote>
  <p>This will, of course, completely baffle the Weasley twins, whilst flustering you.</p>
</blockquote><p>
  <b>L = Location (Favorite places to do the do)</b>
</p><p>Anywhere that’s private and secure—so very specific places. Your rooms at Grimauld Place, as well as his home (location undisclosed). This way, he’s able to focus solely on you—for once letting his guard down.</p><p>
  <b>M = Motivation (What turns them on, gets them going)</b>
</p><p>Your touch. Alastor Moody is <em>immensely</em> touch starved. Just stroke his knuckles whilst holding his hand and he’ll trail off, becoming distracted. He’s the human embodiment of a rough-and-tough Tom Cat melting at the smallest amount of affection.</p><p></p><blockquote>
  <p><b>Note:</b> Needless to say, your skill level doesn’t matter much to him. You’re sexy because you’re you. Just the fact that you <em>want</em> to touch him is bliss.</p>
</blockquote><p>
  <b>N = NO (Something they wouldn’t do, turn offs)</b>
</p><p>First and foremost: Alastor doesn’t share. Having another person present would—on a number of levels—be less than ideal. You’d also have a hard time talking him into anything that might hurt you. </p><p>
  <b>O = Oral (Preference in giving or receiving, skill, etc.)</b>
</p><p>He’d be insecure about his scars, leaving him uncomfortable when naked before you. The first time you gave him head, he’d been completely tense, feeling your lips running along his many scars. How could you not see how ugly he was—his flesh marred and patched together? When you sucked him into your mouth, his mind had gone blissfully blank, head falling back. Needless to say, you’d had him trembling. <em>Not</em> an easy feat.</p><p>As for giving…He’s VERY talented. Unfortunately, the reason behind this is rather depressing. Alastor is <em>very</em> aware of the effect his appearance has on others. As mentioned, he’s paid for sex before. (He trusts sex workers more than complete strangers.) Being an expert at reading people means he’s not fooled by poorly concealed disgust. Simply put, if he pleasures his partner, they tend to forget his scars.</p><p>
  <b>P = Pace (Are they fast and rough? Slow and sensual? Etc.)</b>
</p><p>He definitely prefers slow and sensual. His entire life has been filled with pain and death. Making love to you is the softest thing he has. Thus, he’ll savor every detail of being with you—from your scent; to your little moans; to the way your body arches for him, desperately pulling him closer.</p><p>
  <b>Q = Quickie (Their opinion on quickies rather than proper sex, how often, etc.)</b>
</p><p>While he prefers proper sex, quickies have their uses. Have you been teasing him throughout an Order meeting at Grimauld Place? Mask of calm indifference in place, he’ll excuse the two of you for a ‘private discussion.’ Needless to say, the only talking will be dirty and entirely unfit for public ears.</p><p>
  <b>R = Risk (Are they game to experiment, do they take risks, etc.)</b>
</p><p>For all his grumbling, you know Alastor is secretly your personal teddy-bear. He’d definitely be willing to try new things—especially if it pleases you. Still, this is a man who suffers from severe PTSD. Certain bedroom activities may set him off. Be careful and think it through beforehand whenever considering more intense bed-play.</p><p>
  <b>S = Stamina (How many rounds can they go for, how long do they last…)</b>
</p><p>He’s surprisingly fit for his age. A warrior by lineage, Alastor is capable of some <em>intense</em> bed play. Sex with him is like listening to Beethoven’s Symphony No 9. You can skip to the climax for a quick buzz (a quickie), or let it build up for the full effect (his preference). When given time, he’ll weave a masterpiece of pleasure, lifting you both to a crescendo that will leave you dazed. </p><p></p><blockquote>
  <p>Honestly, if your legs would stop trembling, you’d be tempted to give the man a standing ovation.</p>
</blockquote><p>
  <b>T = Toy (Do they own toys? Do they use them? On a partner or themselves?)</b>
</p><p>He doesn’t own any toys, but you weren’t overly surprised. After all, the image of Alastor in a sex shop just doesn’t seem plausible—and you know revealing his address for shipping isn’t an option. </p><p>
  <b>U = Unfair (How much they like to tease)</b>
</p><p>When it comes to teasing, this poor man is your helpless victim. Unused to being desired, a well-placed look will get him going. This, of course, is something you do often. Having breakfast with the Order? Just give him a secret look with your lips against the rim of your glass. Enjoy his visible swallow. (Note: If you want quickies, this is the best way to get them.)</p><p>
  <b>V = Volume (How loud they are, what sounds they make)</b>
</p><p>If he’s loud, you’re the only one to hear it. He’s put so many spells around your room that no one will ever know what goes on in there. That being said, while he’s not one for talking, you’ll definitely enjoy his pleasured grunts and moans.</p><p>
  <b>W = Wild Card (Get a random headcannon for the character of your choice)</b>
</p><p>One of the surprising ways you bond is over animals. An adorable kitten? He’ll grumble about the little creature, but his heart of gold will shine through. Not wanting to wake you after returning from a late-night Order meeting, he’ll often opt to sleep on the couch. Imagine the wave of love you’d feel at finding your kitten curled up in his lap—him still sitting in his sleep so as not to wake it.</p><p>
  <b>X = X-Ray (Let’s see what’s going on in those pants, picture or words)</b>
</p><p>He’s pretty big, but then you’re not surprised. Whenever you’re in bed and you do something that especially turns him on, his cock will jerk. And when he’s inside you? You never knew you could feel so connected. Hell, you can even feel his heartbeat as he pulses against your tight walls.</p><p>
  <b>Y = Yearning (How high is their sex drive?)</b>
</p><p>Alastor is the master of self-control—to the point that others thought him celibate. Yet, after being in a relationship with him, you can only laugh at how wrong they were. Alastor? Celibate? Having reignited his libido, you find yourself in his arms <em>quite</em> often.</p><p>
  <b>Z = ZZZ (…how quickly they fall asleep afterwards)</b>
</p><p>Alastor is an insomniac—which is to be expected. That being said, if you keep him in bed, there’s a chance your soft touches will lull him to sleep. He’s most relaxed after sex, with you safely tucked in his arms.</p><p><b>Note: </b>Try convincing him to get a pet. Something to stay with you that can also act as a guard when he’s asleep. This will help him relax enough to actually fall asleep.</p><hr/><h2>
