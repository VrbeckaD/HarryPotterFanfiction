    <p>In 2021 the world around me had hardly changed. Rose would be starting her third year at Hogwarts. My wife Hermione would be in her third year strong as Minister.</p><p>I would start my monthly rounds in the DoM. It was honestly simple and great. When we dropped Rose off at Kings Cross she ran off to be with her Ravenclaw friends and classmates. </p><p>We said our greetings to the other parents dropping of their own kids, and caught up with a few old friends from our time at Hogwarts.</p><p>After that, we waved at the leaving Hogwarts express together wishing another successful year to our daughter. To have fun, do well, and make a lot more friends. </p><p>Then when the train left the station, we flooed to the Ministry. Hermione was greeted by all her aides and team who were already telling her the plans and schedule for the day.</p><p>We got a kiss in before she was dragged off to do her Minister stuff. I walked through the lobby and greeted the other people that were making their way into work.</p><p>When I got into the restricted elevator, which was filled with major players I caught sight of my old student and friend Harry Potter. </p><p>“Harry!” I greeted.</p><p>“Tonks! Did you just get in from dropping of Rose?”</p><p>“I did, how’s James?”</p><p>“He’s back home hunting for something invisible and fun no doubt.”</p><p>“How fun. How do you feel about him going to Hogwarts down the road? Any excitement?”</p><p>“I can’t wait! Hogwarts always was my home away from hell all those years. I want James to experience that. Well maybe not the regretting coming back for the Holls.”</p><p>“Well with all the people we know working at Hogwarts now, he’d be in very safe hands. He’d also stay out of all the trouble you got into.”</p><p>“Well he won’t have you to teach him, he’ll be missing out. Also let’s not forget you joined us on most of our adventures.”</p><p>“I think the adventures we went on are best left in the past. How’s Luna doing?” I switched topics.</p><p>“Wonderful, you know she’s pregnant again? I wasn’t supposed to tell you and Hermione till later but since you're asking now I thought I’d let you know.” </p><p>“Remember-”</p><p>“Yes yes, I know don’t give him or her such a lofty name next time. I just wanted to represent them in some way.”</p><p>“Fine you already know the lecture, this is your floor Mr. Head of DMLE.” I gestured to the open elevator door.</p><p>“Have fun doing what you do...down there all sneaky like.” Harry laughed as he left.</p><p>“I always do!” I yelled out after him. I rode down the rest of the way. Once I stepped out Daphne was already down there to greet me. </p><p>“We’ll start your rounds at the Death Room today.” Daphne wrote down on her clipboard.</p><p>“Wow not even a hello, it’s all business then?” I joked.</p><p>“Hello...after the Death Room we can move onto the Love room be sure to wear your ventilation mask.”</p><p>“Simply charming, would it be out of line to ask when the wedding will be?”</p><p>“We want to pick sometime when you and his friends will be free as well as mine. Right, I’ll meet you ahead.” Daphne then took off to one of the ahead rooms.</p><p>I suited up in the Uspeakables uniform making sure to wear the proper hood that would cover the top part of my face as not to give away who we were. It was regulation.</p><p>Since I started in the Death Room today I pulled out my wand so the veil and the Elder Wand could give each other their greeting. I felt my wand call out to it.</p><p>Then I braced for the call back, which came as a strong wave to everyone in the Ministry.</p><p>Only this time was different, when it let out it’s pulse of power it hit me like a wave of the ocean. Then much like being caught in a wave it pulled at me, hard. </p><p>I knew something was wrong as I slowly got lifted into the air. I did what I could as fast as possible. </p><p>I sent out a group of patroni, one to Daphne to see if she could help, others to my wife and friends telling them something was going wrong in case the worst happened.</p><p>Then I found the pull just too strong to resist I was pulled through the archway and into the Veil of Death. </p><p>The last thing I heard was a crack from apparition and a terrible scream. My heart broke at the wail of my wife. As the last she saw of me was my helpless body being taken away into nothing.</p><p>The first thing I heard was screaming, at least hundreds of cries from men, women and children. I shot up into a seated position. I was on a bed, a small one at that.</p><p>I was in some sort of wooden room, and just outside the door from where I was seated there were cries and screams. Some of pain, most from fear. </p><p>When I got up from the bed I had a sudden sense of vertigo. It was instantly noticeable that I was rocking. I was on a ship or even a boat with how things felt.</p><p>Trying to shake off the queasy feeling I pushed my way past my door into the chaos of a hall. There were bodies ripped apart limb from limb and bloodstains from the walls to ceilings.</p><p>At the far end of the hall there was a crouched person biting at the arm of one of the bodies. I didn’t think about it too hard before sending a diffindo at the feeding person’s head.</p><p>The head of the person came clean off and I rushed over to the person he was feasting on. It was a man in a black vintage suit. </p><p>The suit was torn at the sleeve and blood was rushing from his arm at the bite point. His mouth was open, and I watched as fangs were growing in.</p><p>“Fuck! Vampires.” While I had met a few vampires none of them were mad with blood lust. </p><p>Maybe a few were involved with the battle at Hogwarts but thankfully I didn’t personally have to deal with them. </p><p>I quickly incarceroused the newly tuned man so he wouldn't come after me and headed further into the ship. The vampire I had beheaded hadn’t gotten up.</p><p>So I cautiously made a wide berth around his body and went downstairs. I watched as people rushed past the stairs all in one direction.</p><p>Some shared the same rotten look as the one vampire had. While others looked like panicked people. Every now and again a vampire would jump on a person and rip them apart.</p><p>While I wanted to help there was only so much I could do. With how chaotic it was I might hurt a person not involved. As guilty as I felt I needed to get out of this situation and gain my bearings.</p><p>I cast a disillusionment charm on myself and quickly made my way in the opposite direction as the people went. I found myself at another set of steps.</p><p>At the bottom of the steps was a woman in a billowed purple dress. In her arms was a small baby. I could hear it’s cries. Without thinking twice I rushed down the stairs.</p><p>When I was halfway down the ship violently rocked and I was in midair. I came to a crash at the bottom of the steps. I was next to the baby and woman.</p><p>The woman was bleeding from her head and from the looks of things died from head trauma on the stairs. I slowly got up to my knees and examined the room I was in now.</p><p>It was the engine room of the ship. Ahead of me was a woman in a pink dress holding onto a man who was bleeding from his neck. That’s when I noticed a floating blonde head above them.</p><p>I had no idea what to make of what I was looking at, but my attention caught with some movement. Another group of undead were rushing over to the pistons of the engine.</p><p>From what I could see a body was stuck in the piston blocking the mechanism. Very suddenly the piston and engine exploded. I could feel the heat from the distance I was kneeling.</p><p>I knew that I needed to get off this ship as soon as possible, with the ship being made of wood it would catch fast. </p><p>In front of me, the floating head sprouted vein like tentacles from it’s neck hole and dragged the already bleeding man away from the woman in the pink dress.</p><p>Then I heard it’s voice speak, “Erina, look closely! With JoJo unable to use Ripple, I can easily take his body! And I, Dio, can escape easily into my bedroom that is that box. That box was created to protect me from the sun. It can also withstand quite the explosion. It’s basically my personal shelter.”</p><p>I looked at the black coffin next to the woman and guessed that he was referring to it as his bedroom. I held the baby close to my chest as I quickly made my way into the coffin. While the head and man fought for control.</p><p>As the woman watched on from next to me, I pulled her in by her arm as fast as I could and slammed the coffin shut.</p><p>“What-Who are you!?” The woman referred to as Erina, by the head asked in a panic.</p><p>“For now just call me Tonks, just stay here and shut up while I make sure this thing really can handle an explosion and fire!”</p><p>I made sure to make the red lined interior safer with a cushioning charm so we wouldn't get hurt from being knocked around inside the coffin. </p><p>I then cast an unbreakable charm on the coffin to make doubly sure of what the head said. With that done I cast a quick lumos to see inside the thing.</p><p>From outside the coffin I could hear that head still talking, “Let...go...JoJo. Let go! Think about it! I’ll give you eternity too! I’ll heal those wounds! You can be with Erina forever...JoJo! JoJo!? He’s dead!”</p><p>With that it seemed our time was up. There was a loud noise of an explosion as we were both rocketed and shaken from inside the coffin.</p><p>Erina, the baby, and I screamed from inside the coffin as it was tossed about. I could hear burning and the coffin was rocked violently by waves.</p><p>The only sounds were the ocean and the ship we had come from being turned to ash. Erina cried harsh heavy tears. No one said a word while we floated.</p><p>When it felt like enough time had passed I conjured a glass filled with water and offered it to the haggard looking blonde woman.</p><p>She held the glass delicately and took dainty sips from it. “Thank you...you’ve saved me and the child...I cannot thank you enough.”</p><p>“Don’t thank me, there were many more lives I might have been able to save if I could just have thought faster.” I felt guilt rise up in me.</p><p>“Do not blame yourself, Dio is an evil man that killed everyone on board with his zombies. Blame Dio if you must blame anyone!”</p><p>“Dio?”</p><p>“Oh...I guess you wouldn't know him.”</p><p>“Was he that...floating head from the ship?”</p><p>“Yes, he wasn’t always...like that. Well I guess he might have always been evil.”</p><p>“I know a few of those types.”</p><p>“There isn’t anyone quite like Dio, the lives he’s ruined and taken. He...killed Jonathan.”</p><p>“Ah, is that what his name was. That JoJo guy?”</p><p>“Jonathan Joestar, we were just married five days ago…”</p><p>“I’m sorry for your loss.”</p><p>“I am too.” She wiped a tear from her eye.</p><p>“...I’ll just check on the little one here.” I turned my attention to the baby in between us. I unwrapped the baby and checked her for any injuries.</p><p>Thankfully there were none but I did find out that she was a little girl. She had to be 2-3 months old. I made sure to conjure up some new clean clothes for her and dressed her.</p><p>My own memories of taking care of Rose scratching at the back of my mind. In all the chaos I had put me falling through the veil in the back of my head.</p><p>“Erina...where was that ship headed?” I asked.</p><p>“You didn’t know?” She looked confused.</p><p>“...I was...let’s just say a stowaway.” I made up a reason.</p><p>“Well...we were headed to America. The captain said we were barely into the Atlantic Ocean.”</p><p>“Seems odd you’d take a ship, was this like a cruise?” I asked.</p><p>“How else could we get there?”</p><p>“Oh, a plane might work.”</p><p>“A what?”</p><p>“You know an airplane…”</p><p>“I cannot say I do, is it any faster than a ship would be?”</p><p>“Really? Wait- I have to ask then...w-What year is it?”</p><p>“You don’t even know the year?”</p><p>“I guess I don’t?”</p><p>“It’s 1889! February 7th unless it’s become the 8th by now.”</p><p>“...1889...shit.”</p><p>“Why is that such a shock to you?”</p><p>“Because I didn’t expect it. Damn, this is…” Hermione’s parents weren't even born yet. Dumbledore would be around 8 years old.</p><p>“...why is your hair changing colors? How are you doing that?”</p><p>“Oh sorry...it does that.”</p><p>“That’s amazing...there are so many strange things in this world I didn’t know about.”</p><p>“Well you’ve fallen into the deep end with vampires. How did you say you knew that Dio character again?”</p><p>“He was, taken in by the Joestars only a short time I had met Jonathan. He was terrible then too...he had taken my first kiss from me…that brute.”</p><p>“Oh.” Was all I could think to say.</p><p>“He killed Jonathan’s father, then became a vampire and burned down the Joestar house. That’s just from what Jonathan has told me. Jonathan said he had killed Dio but I guess even that wasn’t enough.”</p><p>“If he’s the one that decapitated him, then I would be shocked if Dio was still undead as well...Jonathan must have been very strong to beat a vampire even if only temporarily.”</p><p>“It’s all thanks to Jonathan’s training in Ripple. I can’t say I understand it but it’s a martial art of some kind that is useful against the undead.”</p><p>“I can’t say I’ve heard of it, I’m sorry to scrape at any old wounds.”</p><p>“It’s fine. The fact that you’ve saved me means you deserve a bit of an explanation as to what happened to leave you in this situation.”</p><p>“Ah, well thank you for telling me anyway.” I shrugged.</p><p>“May I ask you who you are now? All I know is that you are Tonks.” I watched as her eyelids started to fight themselves to keep open.</p><p>“It’s Nymphadora Tonks Black.” I gave her my name.</p><p>“...Tonks Black...hm…” Her breathing evened out as she fell asleep. Next to her the little baby girl also yawned before closing her eyes.</p><p>I was left to my own thoughts. Who knows how long we’d be here floating in the water. I needed to make sure we had what we needed to survive. </p><p>I had water covered, food would be a priority tomorrow. Our shelter needed to stay afloat and we needed to be protected from the sun during the daytime. </p><p>I went over the necessary spells in my head. I made sure to cast a feather-light charm on the coffin. Then with my mind secure that we wouldn't sink I closed my eyes and let my body rest.</p><p>Time travel, zombies, and vampires...what the hell was I dropped into here. I guess it wasn’t any more bizarre than dropping into the wizarding world.</p><p>I just hoped that maybe one day I might get back to my own wife and child. Knowing magic most things could be possible. </p><p>However the nagging feeling of being stuck in this time weighed down on me as I slept with my hand gripped tightly around my wand.</p><p>When I woke up, I realized that there was a noticeable breeze. I opened my eyes to see that Erina had opened the coffin and the sun was midway in the sky.</p><p>She was fussing with the baby, I grabbed around in the coffin looking for the death stick only to find it missing from my side. </p><p>I shot up from my lying position and searched the bottom of the casket. Then I looked in the now opened lid. There was no trace of my wand.</p><p>“Erina! Have you seen a long stick, that looks like it’s detailed with four berries?” I asked the other woman floating in the coffin with me.</p><p>“No? Well I saw it when it projected that light last night. But I haven’t seen it this morning, why are you looking for it? Is it important?” She asked.</p><p>“Yes it’s important, I can’t seem to find it. I can make due without it though.” It’d be hard but I could make due with wandless magic for keeping us alive. I rubbed at my eyelids.</p><p>“What’s that!?” She cried pointing at me, “In your arm!”I looked down at my forearm and found it  the same as ever. “No, your inner arm!”</p><p>I twisted my arm over and saw something that nearly made my heart stop. My skin was protruding in a long thin shape. From the top of my wrist to the crook of my elbow.</p><p>That had to be the wand. I ran my fingers over the object and felt my skin, pressing down harder I could feel the wood underneath.</p><p>“What the fuck…” There weren’t any visible entry marks, but there it was below my skin.</p><p>“I take it, that isn’t normal?” Erina asked.</p><p>“No...it is not...I can worry about that later. For now we need to look into feeding each of us.” I put the wand getting into my body out of my mind. </p><p>I mindlessly summoned a fish from the water and caught it in my hand before descaling and cooking it with my magic. </p><p>It seemed that even if my wand wasn’t exactly in my hand, I could do the same scale of magic as if it were. “Hm...no change, here some cooked fish.” I gave her a sizable piece.</p><p>Then I got to work on making food that a baby could eat. While it was a law of magic that I couldn't create food from nothing. </p><p>Using preexisting food I could create something from the fish. While not exactly the most tasty thing it would fill her for some time. </p><p>With food prep done I got to work on some cooling charms that would line the casket. I then cast the four-point spell and noticed we were drifting south east.</p><p>“How many days were we into the trip would you say?”</p><p>“Oh...uh four days, this would be the fifth?” Erina put a finger to her chin.</p><p>“Hm, maybe we will end up in North Africa.”</p><p>“How many days do you think it will take?”</p><p>“I couldn't say, but I’d like to be off and out this death basket as soon as possible.”</p><p>“What a funny way of putting it.” She laughed into her hand.</p><p>“Yeah, yeah…” With that we spent the next 24 hours surviving and drifting further south. We could both make out land in the distance. </p><p>Once I was sure we could get back on land I placed my wand arm in the water and shot out air from the tip. The coffin shot forward across the water until it came close enough to a grouping of rocks.</p><p>I helped Erina out of the coffin and she carried the baby up onto land. I turned back to the coffin and with my foot kicked it back out to sea. I made sure to remove all the spells I cast on it as well.</p><p>Once we were safely on land I stuck close by Erina and the baby. Erina had to contact some people she knew. </p><p>Once we figured out we were somewhere in the Canary Islands we needed to find a place to rest and start on a letter. </p><p>While a tiny bit unethical I was able to conjure up and copy some appropriate money to stay at an inn and pay for lunch and dinner.</p><p>Once we were settled enough and well fed, Erina got started on her letter to one Robert Speedwagon. </p><p>I paid for the letter to be mailed where Erina had addressed it then we waited for a reply. It came not too long later telling us to stay put, and that he would come to us with a way back home.</p><p>It was late February before we were taken on another boat back to London. Erina introduced me to all her friends who she and Jonathan knew. The group included the known Speedwagon and a man named Straizo.</p><p>The entire time we waited, to the time we had returned to Great Britain I realized that the elder wand had worked its way deeper into my body.</p><p>Every time I changed or took a bath it would appear to make its way closer and closer to my heart. It would reach my heart in March of 1900.</p><p>Straizo would later adopt and name the baby girl Erina and I had recused from the exploding ship Elizabeth. By the end of 1889 Erina had given birth.</p><p>It turned out she had gotten pregnant almost immediately after marrying Jonathan Joestar. She named her newborn son George Joestar II after Jonathan’s father.</p><p>The next few years went smoothly if a bit slow. I looked into the wizarding world as soon as I had gotten back. It turned out I had not just gone back in time but had once again gotten sent to another dimension. </p><p>At least I didn’t need to be born again this time. I had also learned the whole sordid affair about Jonathan and Dio’s relationship in detail from both Speedwagon and Erina. </p><p>I had gotten close with Erina and Speedwagon. Erina had on multiple occasions told me she thought of me as a bigger sister. I became a second mother to George Joestar and an aunt to Elizabeth. </p><p>It didn’t take me long to discover something that had eluded me up to that point. While Erisa and Speedwagon eventually showed their age, I did not.</p><p>While at first I thought it was due to me being a witch and having an extended lifetime. It turned out that because of my Metamorphmagus abilities, I didn’t even age the same as a normal witch or wizard would.</p><p>It wasn’t just noticed by me, soon Erina commented on the fact I looked just the same as the day I met her. </p><p>Speedwagon made a joke or two about it saying “If I never saw you walk into the sun, I’d have thought you were a vampire.”</p><p>While I had never gone into details of my past with either of them. I did inform them that I was a witch. That I wouldn't age like they would. I could tell in their eyes they both felt sorry for me, hell I felt a bit sorry for myself.</p><p>In 1908 George and Elizabeth had gotten married. While the two of them had been close I don’t think Erina or I saw it coming. They were adults however so our family ties got that tiny bit tighter.</p><p>In 1910 with some loans from Erina and hard work discovering oil out in America. Speedwagon had created his own company. It was called the Speedwagon Foundation.</p><p>Because of its location out in America Speedwagon had to move. He would still come to visit when he could. But he was clearly busy with his company and distance would make the visits more and more infrequent.</p><p>In 1914 George Joestar, had enlisted for the British Air Force as a pilot in the Great War. When Erina heard the news she was inconsolable.</p><p>She also brought up a memory of hers from when we first met. “...he’s a pilot. He flies an airplane...didn’t you say something about planes when we first met?”</p><p>I tried to deny it, and while she dropped it, I knew it was added to the list of things that never added up about me. I think she suspected some kind of foresight but I never confirmed with her.</p><p>Each time news came out about the war, she would turn to me in question. I would do my best to reassure her that I felt the war would be over in a few more years. Which became the word, soon as 1918 started to wrap up.  </p><p>At the age of 51, on September 27th in the year 1920. Erina had become a grandmother to one Joseph Joestar. Even as a baby he had very much looked like the Joestar he was.</p><p>Tragically a year later Erina’s son George had died. It wasn’t because of any attack from any other country or a mistake as we learned later, but a zombie of Dio’s who had survived and lived working his way into an officer of the RAF.</p><p>George had been secretly sending letters to his wife about his plans to expose the high ranking officer. However he was unable to send the evidence out.</p><p>We only learned this information because Elizebeth hunted down and killed the high ranking officer to avenge her husband. </p><p>She then came to us telling us of what she had done. How she was now known and wanted for the murder of a high ranking military official.</p><p>With the help of Speedwagon’s resources Elizabeth had changed her name and faked her death. She moved far away from us cutting off all communications, in Erina and my care she left her son Joseph.</p><p>In that year Erina told me it felt like she had lost two children at once. I was also deeply affected but...with it happening to me a few times already...I quickly moved on.</p><p>Instead I put my energy into helping raise Joseph alongside Erina. Speedwagon also made more time for us, due to the circumstances.</p><p>It was Erina’s choice to keep Joseph in the dark about his father's death and his mother's disappearance. </p><p>The story we went with was that they had both died due to an unfortunate car accident. While normally I would want to come clean about this type of thing, I wasn’t the kids grandmother. </p><p>On November 27th 1930, I realized that I would be turning 90 years old. When we celebrated my birthday and took a picture with my new family, I looked the same as I ever did in every other photo of me.</p><p>As Joseph grew he showed signs of wit and charm that I didn’t know a child could poses as young as him. He lied almost effortlessly and always seemed to be cracking jokes.</p><p>He did have a bit of a temper in him, that when riled up caused him to throw massive temper tantrums when he was caught out for his bad behavior.</p><p>In 1933, when Joseph was thirteen he had taken a trip with Speedwagon back to America to see some of the sights. </p><p>It was then that he got caught up in an attempted kidnapping of Speedwagon by hijacking of the plane. Thankfully everything worked out in the end.</p><p>Though that didn’t stop Erina from nearly collapsing when she heard that the plane had crashed. Speedwagon had informed us of what had happened.</p><p>After striking Speedwagon the attempted kidnappers demanded that Joseph sit closer to them. </p><p>Joseph had tried to stay out of it, but the kidnappers wouldn't let up bashing Joseph with the back of one of their guns causing him to bleed over the shirt that Erina had bought for him.</p><p>From there Speedwagon informed us that Joseph had lost his cool and instead of following the kidnappers demands used Ripple on the pilot of the plane.</p><p>Apparently all on his own, Joseph had been gifted with the ability to use the martial art Jonathan had used in the past to defeat Dio.</p><p>I didn’t exactly get how he could do that, but if that’s how it happened there wasn’t much I could do to dispute it. </p><p>Speedwagon then went onto explain that since the pilot was out of commission that plane had gone into a free fall. </p><p>Joseph then instructed him to grab the pilot and hold onto the plane seat Joseph was already holding. Then Joseph shoved the seat out of the plane giving them a soft landing.</p><p>I was ready to call bullshit but, with how Ripple worked maybe there was something going on there to help cushion the fall.</p><p>After I finished reading the letter to Erina she waved herself down, before explaining she didn’t know where he got his personality from. Jonathan had been nothing but a gentleman.</p><p>With that decided Erina would have a conversation with Joseph about his grandfather, and his story. I was there for it, and while Joseph had a few questions he seemed to absorb it all including his Ripple ability. </p><p>Which he had known about for some time but didn’t know what to call it. Just like that another person was added to the list of people that hated a dead man named Dio.</p><p>As time passed and Erina got older she seemed to want to be closer to the only friends she had left. </p><p>So she asked me if it was alright, that we all move to America soon to be closer to Speedwagon. </p><p>I could tell where she was coming from, and felt I could also due with a change of scenery. Hell for however long I was going to live, sightseeing might keep the palette fresh. </p><p>So after getting all of our affairs in order, in the autumn of the year 1938 Erina, Joseph and I moved from London to New York. I didn’t realize it then, but this was where my bizarre journey would start.</p>
