    <p>James Potter was a self made soldier by choice. He involved himself in a war led by men of power whose plans for the wizarding world involved much more than wizards themselves.</p><p>James made his choice. He picked his side and he has accepted the target that his decision placed on him. However, his wife and children became targets with him. James has been ambushed by the enemy before and he has scars from his torture. His family will <i>never</i> go through the same. So, for as long as they have been in hiding James has diligently stood guard in his home as he was now..</p><p>A sudden noise near the door put James at high alert. Immediately, his shoulders tense and his hand tightened around his wand. The noise continued and James held his breath but after a few seconds he was able to decipher that the noise was merely the rustling of leaves against the door frame. Relieved, James gained control of himself and breathed in, then out. His elbows returned to their place, propped onto his knees with his wand clenched between his palms.</p><p>Only when the rustle of leaves abruptly stopped and only the sound of wind could be heard from the other side of the door did James allow himself to somewhat relax.</p><p>James' eyes felt dry. There was no doubt that they were red and irritated from the lack of blinking. He ignored the sting and continued to intently stare at the entry of Godrick's Hollow. He and his family's temporary shelter.</p><p>The ticks from the grandfather clock in the corner of the living room distracted his ears from the outside but overshadowed the quiet murmurs of his wife upstairs. Her murmurs were quiet pleas of a mother begging her children to sleep.</p><p>Children... More like, child for it was far likely that James' youngest, Nathaniel, was the only baby of the two upstairs making a fuss. Nathaniel truly proved himself as James' child with his loud whines and demanding nature. James' eldest however, was quite the opposite. He could picture Harrison quietly laying in he and Nathaniel's shared cot patiently waiting for his brother to calm and be laid beside him.

</p><p>
  <i>'James longed to be oblivious to the danger they were in like his children.'</i>
</p><p>It felt like decades since his wife Lily became pregnant, and they were forced into hiding. In reality, they have only been hiding for little more than two years, but it did not make it any easier to cope with.</p><p>A madman was after their children after all, and James could do little more than hide while his comrades fought and perhaps it was wrong of him, but James found an amount of comfort knowing that his former classmate, Frank Longbottom was just as burdened as he from the responsibility of protecting his own family. After all, his child was also being hunted.</p><p>"James..." Lily called out as she descended the stairs.</p><p>James kept his eyes on the entrance, "they asleep?" he asked, he was not surprised at the exhaustion he heard in his own voice.</p><p>Lily nodded. She placed a hand on James' knee in order to steady herself while she slowly knelt down at his side beside the rickety kitchen chair that James had positioned in front of their home's door. The only entry point to their home, James had made sure of that. The thin line that Lily lips had formed displayed her worry but she did not comment on her husband’s exhaustion. She knew from experience that she could not ease James' own paranoia, nor could she convince him to move from the post that he assigned himself.</p><p>Instead, she grabbed the canteen from the floor that laid at James feet and when she felt the weight of it her lips transformed quickly from a terse thin line to a displeased frown, it felt full.</p><p>"Drink," she commanded after she pressed the nozzle of the canteen onto James' lips. Obediently, James began to sip and his sips turned into gulps when he realized how thirsty he was.</p><p>James thanked her and Lily said nothing, but she did however remove James' overgrown bangs from his forehead before she placed a gentle kiss on his brow.</p><p>"It has been a month since you said we were on 'higher alert than ever,' James. Surely, you can rest now. Come, join me on the sofa," Lily begged. Her hands were atop of James' own. She longed to hold it proper but the man's hands were practically glued to his wand.</p><p>James' allowed his eyes to meet his wife's own for a brief second, and even the deep sorrow within them could not persuade him to abandon his post. "Lily, there is a feeling..." ever so slowly, James raised his non-dominant hand, it shook even as he clenched it over his chest where his heart lay beneath. "A feeling deep in my heart from my magic's very core <i>warning</i> me that something is coming. Until that feeling goes away, we are on high alert," he said with finality.</p><p>"Then at least allow our friends to visit once more. It has been a month James, surely you trust them," Lily continued to beg. James was not listening however, and ever so slowly he stood. His eyes on the door and his wife's pleas deaf to his ears.</p><p>"Jame's what is wrong with you--"</p><p>"Quiet, Lily!"</p><p>Lily would have protested the command had it not been so harsh and had James eyes not appeared so crazed. So with an audible clack of her teeth, Lily closed her mouth and turned her eyes to the door that James stared at so tensely.</p><p>Minutes passed, and the hairs on the back of James' neck stood so stiffly that he could easily pluck them out one by one with ease.</p><p>"Lily. Go upstairs, now," James said oh so slowly as he roughly grabbed Lily's arm and forced her to stand. He shoved her toward the stairs, "J-James, what has gotten-"</p><p>"Go!" the manic urgency in which her husband spoke frightened Lily, but before she could demand answers for his behavior she felt an offensive spell break through one of the many charms she had placed around and throughout the house. She gasped, someone unwelcome was coming. She looked to her husband, "James..." 

</p><p>Suddenly, James began to move, he looked mad as he began to spell anything and everything in their home to barricade the door. First, the chair he had been sitting upon, then the sofa, then the coffee table.</p><p>When he went for the kitchen table he stopped short when another spell hit one of their defenses. The house shook from the power of it and Lily did not argue when James angrily yelled, "DAMN IT, LILS, GRAB THE KIDS AND GO!"</p><p>Lily quickly ran up the narrow stairway to the nursery and barricaded herself inside. Just as James, she began to spell anything within the room to blockade the door. The chairs, tables, the bookshelf, Nathaniel's &amp; Harrison's toy box and any other items her magic latched onto. She did not waste too much time in doing so. After all, her goal was not to find safety within the nursery but to evacuate herself and her children as quickly as possible.</p><p>In the closet there was a plain muggle baby rattle which had been spelled into a port key that would take them to their muggle home Lily herself had purchased, where they would use the floo there  to floo to another home owned by the Potter's in America. When she opened the closet however, the shoe box where the rattle should have been was empty.</p><p>Lily was an optimist, <i>'surely, it is just misplaced,'</i> she thought to herself. In an attempt to soothe her rapid beating heart, she searched calmly. Gently, she moved shoes, articles of clothing and anything else in her way. Her calm movements turned to frantic ones when the rattle failed to reveal itself. No matter how hard she looked, no matter how many 'accio's' she cast, the rattle did not appear.</p><p>"Bombarda!" A voice hissed from below.</p><p>The sound of the door down stairs exploding made Lily jump and she decided to forgo the rattle and use the emergency-emergency port key; Harrison's old blanket which was hidden under the cot in he and Nathaniel's crib.</p><p>Nathaniel cried so very loudly and Lily ignored him in favor of her search. However, strangely enough, it seemed as if Harrison was doing his best to calm his brother himself. Briefly, Lily paused mid way of lifting the cot from under her children. She wiped away the tears that had formed out of frustration and she pulled herself together. If Harrison could comfort his brother during a time like this, then surely, she could keep her own calm and get them to safety. Gently, she lifted the cot as much as she could, she only needed to grab onto any part of the blanket in order to whisk them away to safety. Lily almost screamed when she saw that the blanket was not there.</p><p>Those were the only two port keys they had been allowed to have when the wizarding American government accepted their petition for emergency asylum. Lily did not panic. Now, it was only <i>legally</i> port-keying out of Godric's Hollow that was no longer an option. Lily still had the locket around her neck that would transport them there. They would only need a day to recuperate and they could be gone the next day to another Potter home in Europe.</p><p>Lily yanked the locket from her neck, tightened the hold she had on the children and said, "Potterbound." The words should have instantaneously activated the port key. However, it did not take Lily long to figure out that the key had been deactivated. "Potterbound, Potterbound, fucking Potterbound!" She yelled and threw the locket across the room when it continued to be useless. The only other person besides James and herself to know of the port keys was the only other person involved in setting them up… Wormtail.</p><p>Lily almost released an inhuman screech at the thought of such a horrid betrayal. They might die, and Wormtail-sweet, quiet, submissive Peter Pettigrew would be the cause. She ran to the door and removed the items she had used to block it in fear that the inevitable bombarda would cause the scattered pieces of debris to hit the babies like bullets.</p><p>It had grown quiet downstairs quiet long ago, and with each silent second Lily grew even more paranoid because she did not know what was to come. Lily tightened her hold on her wand and turned to the babies inside the bed with desperate need to see them alive and whole. She herself will die before she would allow any form of harm to come to them. The thought surprised her.</p><p>She gasped when she noticed how Harrison's eyes bore into her own. The baby looked contemplative while he stared at her and held his brother who was falling asleep in his arms.</p><p>"Lily Potter," Lord Voldemort hissed as he calmly opened the nursery door and invited himself inside. Lily found herself grateful that he did not explode it into a million pieces.</p><p>Lily breathed in through her nose and out through her mouth; she steeled herself. Lily was far from a coward; she was a Gryffindor after all, and this was not the first time that she had come face to face with Voldemort. However; she never outright had to deal with the man either. She turned her entire body to face him. Her wand at the ready.</p><p>"Where is James!?" She demanded.</p><p>"He is alive, you may go to him. Leave us," Voldemort hissed and waved a dismissive hand toward the door, "I have no need for you or your death."</p><p>Lily laughed, "I am staying right here, you need not harm these children."</p><p>Voldemort used a silent expelliarmus charm on her wand and it flew out of her hand. Lily gasped and was ready to call for her wand, but her plan was cut off as Voldemort threatened her, "attempt to retrieve your wand and your husband will die along with your children. Am I understood, girl?"</p><p>Lily gulped. She was no fool, she felt his power, she was at his mercy. So, she nodded.</p><p>Voldemort approached her and spoke as if he had been on a mere stroll and had come upon Lily by chance, "You are right, you know. I will not be harming any child. I will, however, kill the child of the prophecy. You know which child that is. It would save you the loss of two children by telling me."</p><p>By the end of his threat, Voldemort had gripped Lily harshly by her chin. His face was so close to her own that she could feel the air leave his nose as he breathed.</p><p>Lily began to sob; she would never tell. It would be needlessly cruel to choose. Nor was Lily foolish enough to believe that Voldemort would trust her word and not kill both children anyway.</p><p>"Please, don't—please. Take me! I have defied you; I still continue to do so! You will not harm these children!" Lily in a state of panic managed a bout of magic that knocked Voldemort back. The Dark Lord became enraged at this, "I have no time for this, little girl!" With a flick of his hand back he sent Lily flying into a wall across the room. It knocked her out upon impact.</p><p>"Tch. Now, you two…" Voldemort hissed as he approached the crib, wand in hand.</p><p>The children clung to one another which was more than impressive considering that they were mere babes. They could not truly understand their predicament.</p><p>One of the children eyed him fearfully and sniffled while snot dribbled from his nose. <i>'Disgusting,'</i> Voldemort sneered internally.</p><p>The other child however; challenged Voldemort. The Dark Lord could tell that it was a challenge the moment his red eyes were met with fair colored amber ones that peered into his own with what could be seen as calculation.</p><p>Voldemort raised his wand pointedly. Brown eyes continued to stare unflinchingly into the man's own even as the babe's brother continued to snivel and cry.</p><p>"I am sure that you would have grown into a formidable opponent, Avada Kedavra!"</p><p>Lily awoke to James' desperate voice, "Lily, Lilian! Wake up—" he called out and shook her gently.</p><p>"'M up James. I'm up," Lily mumbled and sat up slowly. Her head felt as if it had been torn apart. She looked around the room and quickly noticed that everything was in shambles and debris laid just about everywhere.</p><p>Suddenly she remembered why she had even been "asleep" in the first place.</p><p>"James! Nathaniel, Harriso—"</p><p>"Lily, my girl! They are fine," soothed one Albus Dumbledore-their former headmaster said as he approached the two ever so slowly. Lily immediately noticed that the man held a twin in each arm.</p><p>Lily held out her hand for them. She wanted them both but was only given Harrison. Quickly she checked him over and when she deemed him okay, she desperately reached out her other arm for Nathaniel.</p><p>"Lily, calm down!" James demanded as he grabbed her hand. He was slightly unnerved by Lily's hysterical behavior.</p><p>"No, James! I want my son!" Lily cried. She shook the arm that James held onto in an attempt to shake him off.</p><p>Headmaster Dumbledore smiled sadly but still refused to give her Nathaniel. He did, however, angle the baby so that she could see the lightning shaped scar that faintly glowed in the center of the back of the boy's hand.</p><p>A sob escaped Lily and she reached for him again. This time the headmaster allowed her to take him in as a replacement for Harrison who seemed to be dozing off.</p><p>James rubbed a tired hand over his face, "It's Nathaniel Lily. He really is the one of the prophecy," he was absolutely exhausted. James huddled close to his wife and youngest son and held them.</p><p>"It is with a heavy heart that I am in agreement. The Longbottoms were attacked this very night as well and while young Neville survived along with his uncle--he was unmarked," Dumbledore stated as he attempted to rock Harrison asleep. However, the boy became even more alert within his arms and physically shook himself awake and Dumbledore allowed a surprised chuckle to escape his throat.</p><p>Lily stared at the two men, unsure of their certainty.</p><p>"Oh god... Alice..." Lily whispered. She held Nathaniel closer, prepared to mourn her friend. However, she was startled out of her grief as she remembered the man whose fault it was that they were attacked, "Voldemort! Where is—"</p><p>James laughed hysterically, "he's dead, Lily. Nathaniel killed him. Besides that mark, that's how we know that he's the prophecy child."</p><p>Lily gaped at James and then at her son who was sound asleep within her arms, she then turned to the headmaster and displayed her open disbelief on her face in hopes that the man would provide some answers.</p><p>The headmaster's eyes twinkled in amusement, "it's true, the boy is exhausted from what I can tell is magical depletion. He has the mark and it even faintly glows. It is young Nathaniel who has slain Voldemort-at least we are assuming that it is, unless you were the one to vanquish him?"</p><p>Vehemently Lily shook her head in the negative, "no, no, I was knocked out… Thrown against a wall."</p><p>The professor nodded. He had suspected as much.</p><p>"Well, Sirius has gone with the other Aurors, to confirm Voldemort's remains. Only his ashes could be found, we will know for sure if they are truly the remains of Voldemort in a week's time."</p><p>The Potter's nod shallowly at the man's report. Lily still did not understand what really transpired after she was knocked out, how did Nathaniel do it?</p><p>As if reading her mind, the professor said, "from the magic residue left in the nursery, I infer that Voldemort attempted an Avada Kedavra and Nathaniel threw it back, most likely with accidental magic alone. I believe that he may have used Harrison's magic as well; they are both equally weak in magic at the moment."</p><p>Lily nodded again. That almost made sense and because she was too exhausted to question anything else, she left well enough alone for now.</p><p>"None of the port keys worked, otherwise you all would have been unharmed and in America right now," James stated and looked toward Lily with a look that demanded answers.</p><p>She let out a dry laugh, "the rattle and blanket were gone. Not even accio brought them to me and my locket didn't work... Wormtail betrayed us, James."</p><p>James shook with anger, "I'll kill him. I swear it. I'll kill him with my bare hands," and just as quickly as the anger came, it left him. His face fell into his hands and his shoulders shook tremendously from the betrayal of one of his dearest friends. They almost <i>died,</i> and Wormtail assisted in their assassination attempt. Lily huddled closer to her husband and remained silent. Thankfully, the headmaster did as well. They could further debrief later when everything wasn't so fresh.</p><p>(</p>
<hr/><p>)</p><p>Nathan Potter held his brother's hand in a tight grip and led them down Diagon Alley excitedly.</p><p>"Harrison, look! Bargen's Books! We can go there after going to the wand shop and Quidditch shop, okay?" Nathan stated to his brother as he babbled on about the various shops in Diagon Alley. Nathan nearly bounced on the balls of his feet in excitement. He continued to list what he and his older twin brother would do that day, without pause and without consulting Harry himself. To outsiders Nathan most likely appeared as a bossy and over demanding boy; however, that wasn't the case. While Nathan could be bossy at any point in time, Harry could--and has--spoken up for himself when he so wanted. Though he rarely felt the need to. Nathan was his best friend, and usually did things with positive intentions.</p><p>Harry nodded in approval and only half listened to his brother and allowed his eyes to drift toward the bookstore longingly as they passed.</p><p>Their mother Lily walked alongside her husband and allowed the boys to be until they finally reached Ollivander's wands. She turned to them and clapped her hands loudly, commandeering her boy's, and James' attention.</p><p>They were getting the boy's wands a few months early so that Nathan could use his own wand to proceed further into his defense training which was supposed to be a well kept secret, even from Harry.</p><p>Nathan of course, told his brother everything and when he was told that he would no longer have to use a practice wand or his father's wand for practice he refused to get a wand if Harry was not allowed to get one too.</p><p>Unbeknownst to Harry's mother and brother, Harry was quite adept with wand work due to the private lessons he was forced to take by his father with a mentor that his mother did not know about. His hired mentor refused to take Harry on as a student if he were not allowed a wand. However, the ministry has to be notified of any wands that could cause injury but his father did not want his mother to become suspicious as to why Harry would even need one.</p><p>As an heir with so many other responsibilities, his mother felt it unfair to add vigorous defense training on top of that. and thus, Harry was forced to use a hand-me-down wand from the Potter vaults during lessons with the man. Harry forced thoughts of the man from his mind. He refused to think about him on a good day such as this and really, it would be nice to have his own wand since his father never allowed him to despite Harry's vigorous training.</p><p>"Okay boys are we ready to get your wands?" Their mother asked excitedly.</p><p>Nathan nodded enthusiastically. He took a peak at Harry and received a small smile in return. On Harry it may as well be a grin. James ruffled Nathan's hair and fixed Harry's bangs out of his eyes before he placed a hand on each boy's shoulder and led them inside.</p><p>"Good evening all, I see that we have the infamous Nathaniel Potter among us, and oh—Harrison Potter as well, a pleasure, my child." greeted the renowned cryptic wand maker himself, Ollivander.</p><p>"It is indeed a pleasure, Mr. Ollivander. However; please refrain from calling myself Harrison, and Nathaniel as Nathaniel. You may call me Harry, and you may call Nathaniel, Nathan." Harry stated politely, he even gave a slight bow of his head after; as was good wizarding manners when dealing with those older and or in higher standing than you.</p><p>Their father looked slightly irritated at Harry's words. He prepared to reprimand Harry for correcting an adult in such a manner, but Nathan's enthusiastic agreement stopped him in his tracks, "Yeah, Olliva—I mean, Mr. Ollivander! Only Harrison and I can use each other's full names, even our parents use the shorter alterations." Nathan remembered himself and hastily threw in a small nod at the end. He looked toward Harry for approval and smiled wide when he got an approving nod.</p><p>Ollivander nodded in return and moved toward a shelf full of wands, "understood, young Potters. Please, this way."</p><p>"Who shall go first?" Ollivander inquired politefully.</p><p>Harry answered for them when he sat in a chair in the far corner and gestured toward Nathan. He ignored Nathan's pout at such a development. Harry was accustomed to such behavior from his brother and rarely did he allow Nathan to have his way just because he pouted a bit--unlike the adults in their lives. Harry stated that he was sitting down so that he could be comfortable, because it would be better to take turns as he knew that Nathan would take a long time.</p><p>Nathan sniffed a bit at that and childishly bet Harry a sickle that he would only take 5 minutes. Harry raised a brow at the other boy but did not reply or place his own bet much to Nathan's chagrin.</p><p>Nathan most certainly did not take 5 minutes. As a matter of fact, he took 30 minutes and his heart was filled with dread when he was informed that his wand was the twin to the Dark Lord's own.</p><p>Harry knew of the Dark Lord due to the many times that he was mentioned in passing by his father--that is, when the man felt so inclined to take over his defense lessons.</p><p>His father was harsh when he trained Harry. When Harry failed a spell, or staggered a step while dodging, his father would berate him and with crazed eyes he would ask Harry if he wanted himself and his brother to be killed by Voldemort, the Dark Lord, the Madman and any other of the various names that he-who-must-not-be-named went by. The memories were unpleasant but it was due to that that Harry could understand that his brother's wand further cemented him as the Boy-Who-Lived. A title his brother had supposedly earned for surviving the avada kedavra spell.</p><p>Harry stood from his chair and approached his brother gingerly. He placed a supportive hand on Nathan's shoulder and smiled. His smile was small and crooked but showed his pride in his brother, "You should be very proud, Nathaniel, it is an incredible wand and your new life long companion." he congratulated.</p><p>Nathan hugged him tightly. Harry tentatively returned the hug. Nathan was affectionate as ever, "thanks Harrison! your turn now!" Nathan said enthusiastically.</p><p>For 30 minutes Harry waved and shook every wand given him. None of them had even sparked. After the 92nd wand, Ollivander looked toward Harry with a gloomy expression plastered on his face; "I must confess, young heir, no wand I have crafted calls for you. They tell me that they refuse to spark because you would only damage them."</p><p>Harry ignored Nathan, questioning the Wand Maker, "you speak to wands!?"</p><p>"Of course not, child. Wands speak to me," Ollivander said incredulously, of course, he couldn't speak to wands! The wand maker noticed the forlorn look on Harry's face. His eyes looked down at his now empty hands shamefully.</p><p>"Do not appear so glum, young heir. A wand calls for you, however, I did not make it, and I pity you, because it is calling for you, a mere child. Please, give me one moment."</p><p>The Wand Maker traveled to the back of the room in a dark corner, which left the small family alone. Lily rubbed Harry's shoulder gently which he thanked her for as if she were doing him a service. His father watched the two intently, Harry did not notice the frown that formed on his father's face when he thanked his mother for her affection in such a manner.</p><p>Nathan tried to encourage him by telling him that he would get a wand, just as he did.</p><p>Ollivander returned and in his hands he held onto a long ashen box languidly. Ollivander opened it slowly and the box released a harsh chill throughout the room. Harry felt mesmerized as he stood before the box. Gently, Harry took the wand from its box and immediately, he felt the deep despair and sorrow that emitted from the wand the moment his hand contacted the sleek end.</p><p>Before Harry could stop himself, a tear fell from his eye and he grieved with the wand.</p><p>Nathan ran to Harry's side seeking to comfort his brother. Ollivander placed a firm hand on Harry's shoulder and garnered his attention.</p><p>"Mr. Potter, may I ask why this wand has called for you?" Ollivander whispered with eyes that reflected the sorrow that Harry and the wand both felt.</p><p>Briefly, Harry wondered about what the wand was saying to the elderly man. Then Harry considered that the wand may not be speaking to the man at all. After all, the Wand Maker did not make this particular wand, and if it did not speak to him, it wouldn't be odd that he knew little to nothing about it. The Wand Maker's question slightly stumped Harry because he did not know the answer. If Harry were to be honest, the fact that the wand chose him terrified him immensely.</p><p>"I don't know..." Harry paused and closed his eyes, and did his best to clear his mind and truly feel the emotions of the wand. His eyes were closed for mere seconds before he opened them with a gasp, "death," he breathed, "I can only explain it as death," Harry said earnestly.</p><p>Ollivander dropped his hand, his eyes were downcast and his smile was grim, "Ah, perhaps it is warning you that you will need it at your death. Or perhaps it is foreseeing you vanquishing another. It is a powerful wand. I can feel that much."</p><p>:ily jumped out of her seat, she could not allow such a barbaric conversation to continue. However, before she could interrupt them James placed a hand on her shoulder and gestured for her to watch and listen.</p><p>"I see," Harry stated determinedly, the energy from the wand shook his very core. Harry did not fully understand the elderly maker's words but he knew that he would greatly need this wand--it was his and would be by his side until the day he died. Without words, the wand made Harry feel that.</p><p><i>'I am akin to death, but I am not Death itself, you may not understand it now, but you will soon.'</i> The wand stated.</p><p>Harry looked at the Wand Maker, who looked at him intently with deep knowing eyes.</p><p>Harry's eyes returned to his wand and he squeezed it in assurance.</p><p>It was not as if Harry wanted to know what death was, but Harry often had dreams that revolved around death and eventually he had gotten used to the concept. He remembered that when he first had begun to have such dreams, they had scared him so deeply that he went to his parents for help.</p><p>His father had accused him of attempting to get out of his studies and his mother had brushed them off as nightmares, and because Harry was so unsure of himself, he never brought them up again to the two. Not even when the visions taught him things that he knew to have happened but should not know.</p><p>Ollivander gazed at Harry, eyes alight with something akin to respect.</p><p>"I… did not make this wand, the core is unknown even to myself. However; the wood—whatever it may be—is mixed with bone. A bone that was given voluntarily by a thestral, if legends are to be believed. It is because of that bone that the wand is near invisible to those who have not seen death. I do not know which wood and core were used, but I do know this. You and Mr. Nathan both—are destined for great things, but who will suffer the most I wonder?" The wand maker said dazedly.</p><p>"OK! We would like to pay, Ollivander—sir," Lily stated with a pointed look at their father who nodded his head in agreement and fished through his coin purse.</p><p>"Ah, yes, that will be 9 galleons, please."</p><p>James paused momentarily, mouth turned down in confusion, "but we are purchasing two wands." He informed dumbly.</p><p>Ollivander nodded in agreement, "yes, however, young Harrison's wand has always been his. I did not make it."</p><p>"Got it…" James said in open confusion. He shook it off and hastily paid before he herded his family out the door.</p><p>"Merlin, can you believe that man?" He asked conversationally once they exited the facility.</p><p>"Oh, leave it, James Potter! You wanted to hear that Drivel. Ollivander has always behaved in such a way, but Nathan is constantly reminded that it was he who defeated He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named and now Harry is being told he will possibly suffer and was given such a grim wand? I am shocked!" Lily bent over to check on Harry who had Nathan glued to his side in a one arm hug. Gently, she cupped Harry's face in her hands and checked him over.</p><p>"Harry, are you ok?" She asked worriedly which genuinely surprised Harry. Often, Lily just assumed that Harry was the stronger twin. That he could handle anything. This tender motherly care was usually reserved for Nathan.</p><p>Harry nodded silently in confirmation that he was fine. He squeezed Nathan's hand and looked at his wand determinedly, "I do not believe Mr. Ollivander meant to be offensive. The wand—I agree, it is a sad wand and perhaps it is a sign that something bad is soon to come as Mr. Ollivander warned... but it is my wand now and I think it will protect me from whatever is coming."</p><p>By the end of Harry's speech, his mother looked near to tears, she hated when he spoke like this. So wise, so old, so dejected.</p><p>His father rubbed his face tiredly, exasperation evident, "why must you speak that!? Can't you be a normal boy, just for today, Harry? Look, you're making your mother <i>and</i> brother awfully sad."</p><p>His mother hissed her husband's name at his callousness, she completely failed to stop the man from being insensitive to their eldest. Nathan frowned even deeper than he had been, "S'not Harrison's fault," He mumbled with a slight glare toward their father.</p><p>Nathan tugged Harry along gently, "May we go to the bookstore, now?"</p><p>"I thought you wanted to go to the Quidditch store," Harry reminded Nathan, confused by his sudden change in decision.</p><p>Nathan led them in the direction of the bookstore. He refused to face Harry and shrugged, "I changed my mind," he stated defensively.</p>
