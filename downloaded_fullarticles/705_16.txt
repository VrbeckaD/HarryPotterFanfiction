    <p>Death was like falling asleep, Sirius was right. I opened my eyes to white lustrous floors and walls. I slowly stood up and say that I was in king cross station but more cleaner. I still feel alive.                                                        “You shouldn’t ponder harry.” I looked up to see Professor Dumbledore standing in his grey robes. Looks just the same when he died. I was happy to see him but I was also angry at how he basically forced Snape to spy on him and that he lied to me. I walked up to him and smiled, fire behind my eyes.                                                                                                                                                                                                             “Why are we here?” I ask the dead Headmaster, he just smirked.                                                                                                           “It is your party, you can either get on the train and see your parents or go back to fight and win the battle as Voldemort has been weakened.” The Headmaster said wisely looking around at the train master. I could choose between life and death, the only person I want to save in this war is Snape as he died out of loyalty.                                                                                                                                                                                     “Headmaster, is there a way to bring a dead person back to life?” I asked hoping there would be. If anyone is going to live is Snape he deserves that much. He will hate me for it but I don’t care. Albus just smiled.                                                                                                                                                                                                      “Is this Snape you are talking about Harry?” he said looking through is half-moon glasses.                                                             “Yes sir, he didn’t deserve to die, I never got to tell him that I forgive him or my mother would.” I said sadly looking down at my feet.                                                                                                                                                      “You’re right, he did not. But do you not think from looking at his memories that he wanted to die” He stated matter of factly. I know Snape wanted to die but he died as a miserable man who had never had a life of his own. I am not excusing his behaviour but I know why he had to be mean and he was traumatized by my father and his friends, he had every right to treat me like my father’s spawn in which I was.                                                                                                                                                                                  “Yes I do but I he died miserable and I don’t think Mum would of wanted that even after everything he has done. James would obviously hate it.” I said spitting out my father’s name. Dumbledore looked at me in shock at the anger I held against my so called anger. I know he wanted to ask why but I didn’t let him.                                                                                                                                                                                                     “This potion is called the ‘Elixir of the Eclipse’, it does bring him back to life but it has a negative slant, it would change his gender and age, whoever gives the potion and is your age the person who died would become that age and Snape will become female. My question is Harry would Snape want that?” the Headmaster states smiling his signature smirk. I know he will hate being my age again and a female. I wonder what he will look like and what he would change is name to.                                                                            “It’s the best chance we got, I will see you again professor” I said before walking toward the white light which lead me back to life. I know I will probably find the elixir in the potion cupboard, as I know Snape brews everything. T’s time to defeat Voldemort. <br/>We won the war, we actually won. I didn’t give a toss about being congratulated as I ran to the potion’s cupboard trying to find the elixir. I looked at the top shelve. I stopped as I remember being here being scolded by Snape about stealing something which I didn’t actually steal. Why am I doing this? I question myself, I need to do this. I need closure and I need at least someone who knew my mum even if that person despises me. I found it on the bottom shelve. I ran back to the great hall which held the dead bodies of children and death eaters. I stopped when I saw Lupin and Tonks, I looked at the vial and saw there was only enough for one person and I knew Lupin would want me to save someone else even though. I ran to the shrieking shack which lay Snape. I walked towards him opening the vial. I opened his dead mouth and poured the contents of the potion into his mouth. I stepped back looking at him. I decided to leave as I know if he saw what I had done he would murder me on sight. <br/>I ran back to the great hall finding Ron and Hermione and the rest of the Weasleys huddled together in a hug. Even the twins made it. I walked towards them putting my hand on Ron’s shoulder.                                                      “Hey mate” I said looking at him as he looked up to me with sorrow. He put his hand on mine. Hermione looked at me, tears rolling down her cheeks. So, this is wat war does. It doesn’t matter if you win, you still feel like you have lost anyway. Lavender Brown, Colin Creevey and even Dean Thomas. I sat beside them putting my arms around them. Saying sorry multiple times.                                                                            “It is not your fault harry” Hermione said trying to comfort me. I knew this was my fault. How will we come back from this I thought?<br/>A year has passed since the war and I am heading to do y seventh year that I missed with Hermione. Ron is wanting to help at Fred and George’s joke shop. I stood at the station platform waiting for Hermione. I haven’t seen Snape since the war, I don’t even know the potion worked. I looked around and saw Hermione walking towards me with her trunk.                                                                                                                                     “Hey Hermione” I say waving. At her with a smile.                                                                                                                                         “Hey Harry” She replied as we begun walking into the train. The carriages were empty as we were 30 minutes early. Hermione’s fault. We entered a carriage and sat down chatting about anything and everything.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  “Did you hear Harry that there is going to be a new seventh year student this year?” she asked. Of course I didn’t know. I wonder wy they are only starting this year.                                                                                                               “No I didn’t Herms” I said shaking my head. I wonder what she or he is like.                                                                                    “Apparently her name is Serena Prince, she was home schooled apparently.” She said. How odd that is Snape’s mother’s maiden name, they could be related somehow. I nodded.                                                                                    “That’s amazing, I wonder what house she will be put in” I said curiously wondering whether she will be in Slytherin or Gryffindor or Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw.                                                                                                                        “More likely Slytherin. The Prince family are usually put into Slytherin.” She stated pulling out potion books. I think this one will be put in Gryffindor. The train got quickly full.                                                                                        “Can I sit in here?” Someone asked opening the train compartment door. I nodded. She was a tall girl around my age and long black hair which was down to her middle of her back. She looked at me with a weird expression, she has Black orbs for eyes. She looked so much like Snape which made me wonder if the potion worked and if she is Snape. She was already in her school robes and was holding her books. I looked at her neck and noticed scars which looked like Snake bites.                                                                  “What’s your name?” I ask politely, I believe she is Snape. I saw her fingers tighten around her books.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   “Serena Prince. What’s yours?” She asked, she has a deep feminine voice which was soft and not as harsh. I looked at her with a smile.                                                                                                                                                             “You know who I am” I say wanting to tell him I knew it was him. She smirked. I felt a kick which came from Hermione.                                                                                                                                                                                                        “Well who doesn’t know the chosen one who makes decisions others don’t want him to do” she states looking at him with annoyance. I looked at Hermione and she looked back In Shock.                                                                                                   “Maybe I wanted to save someone’s miserable life” I say snidely. Hermione kicks me again.                                                                      “Harry James Potter! Enough. I know who she is, she talked to me earlier for Christ sake! I would feel the same if you did that to me. So don’t look hard done to” Hermione snaps and opens her potions book. I look at Serena and she just smiles. Cheeky witch. The train starts and we are on our way to Hogwarts again well the refurbished version. I spent months helping restore it.                                                                                 “Serena can you help me with this recipe. I don’t’ get it please” Hermione asks sitting next to her pushing me against the window.                                                                                                                                                                            “Did you not listen during my lessons Granger” She said laughing a bit. She had a beautiful laugh I cannot deny that. And she is definitely pretty not as ugly as before I thought.                                                                                   “Potter, remember those occlumency lessons, please try to keep your thoughts to yourself.” She sneers while helping Hermione with potions. I scoffed, I am trying not to feel hatred towards the girl/man.                                                                                                                                                                                                               “What house do you think you will be put in again?” I ask looking at her, her hair was covering her face as she was writing notes in Hermione’s textbook. She looked up at me.                                                                                “Probably Slytherin” She replied bluntly, I kind of want her not to be put in Slytherin as I fear she will follow the same path.                                                                                                                                                                                     “I hope not” I accidently blurt out and Hermione and Serena look at me in confusion. I face palm myself mentally. Idiot.                                                                                                                                                                                    “Why not Potter? She asks shutting Hermione’s book before handing it to her. I look at her in sadness, I know she hates stereotyping but it wasn’t what I meant.                                                                                                “Slytherin is a fantastic house…” Serena scoffs. “But I think you should be put into any other house but slytherin as I don’t want you to follow the same path. I think you would prefer being in a house such as Ravenclaw.” I say smiling hoping she doesn’t get annoyed. <br/>Finally after an awkward train ride with my ex professor who is now a classmate and my best friend who somehow got tutored by him/her. I grabbed Serena’s trunk but she just scowled and grabbed it from me. We both followed the dark witch off the train. We silently walked to the thestral pulled carriages and got on the same one. I could see Snape’s reluctance of going back and being put back into education, it was if she was scared in case she was bullied again. We made it to Hogwarts with very little chat. The sorting should begin soon. I could see Snape stand at the end looking anxious as she was fiddling with her hands. I am praying she is not put into Slytherin again.<br/>Finally she was called up to the hat. Minerva placed the sorting hat on top of the witches head.                                                “Back again I see, I found difficulty placing you last time, will you stay there or will you change your mind. I should have put you in another house. I see you are loyal to a fault, very slytherin but you are also very brave so better be… GRYFFINDOR!” The hat yelled. I could see Serena tiny smirk before heading towards me and Hermione. I clapped and screamed happy noises. She sat beside me and smiled. I smiled back. I could feel her tension and anxiety fade away like perfume. The feast was brought out and we all began eating. I noticed that Snape was only eating small amounts. It was if she was allergic to it.                                                                                                                                                                                                  “Aren’t you hungry?” I asked her putting my fork down and facing her. She faced me and sneered.                                            “I don’t particularly eat much” she simply stated and I began to worry and I do not know why about her health. As from personal experience of being starved for days to weeks on end, I know the feeling of not wanting to eat.                                                                                                                                                                                                  “I would appreciate it if you eat more of your vegetables.” I said gently looking at her. I could see Hermione looking at us in what looked like awe. Serena looked at me and I saw a flash of calm go across her eyes. She reluctantly ate her peas and carrots and pushed her plate away. I sighed and finished the rest of my pumpkin juice.                                                                                                                                                        “What class are you most excited to be in again?” Hermione asked Serena who was looking at the teachers table probably missing sitting there.  Serena looked at Hermione and smiled and I scoffed.                                    “I would like to do potions again not that I don’t know anything but I want to see how the new teacher screws up.” She says bluntly. I and Hermione chuckled as we thought about Serena arguing with the potion master and telling him that he is wrong. Serena looks between me and Hermione and starts to laugh as well.                                                                                                                                                                                    “Do you guys know Amy Winehouse?” I ask randomly as somehow Serena reminds me of her. Her costume for Halloween is sorted.                                                                                                                                                                “Yes!” they both exclaim, they look at each other and laugh. I join them. I have never seen Snape relax or laugh before and she looked finally at peace with herself. Ever since seeing her memories I feel obliged to better than my mother and actually try to be friends with her as she deserves that much. I can relate to her abuse at home as it was exactly like mine at the Dursley’s. The feast soon ended and we were sent to our dormitories.                                                                                                                                         “Buttercream sauce” I said to the portrait, I could hear Serena scoff behind me and I couldn’t help but chuckle.                                                                                                                                                                                                             “Seriously, Gryffindor’s” I heard Serena mutter. I wonder what slytherin passwords were like. The portrait opened which revealed the beautiful Gryffindor common room. We all entered and I saw Serena immediately grab a book and sit on the arm chair next to the fire. I smiled but the rest of the Gryffindor’s chuckled and stared. I scoffed.                                                                                                                                         “Do you want a picture?” I say and the rest of the Gryffindor’s scoff but all head up to the dormitories leaving me and Serena. I sat across from her not wanting to leave her by herself.                                                   “You don’t need to stay Harry.” She said looking at me. I choke on my saliva as she never has called me harry. She rolls her eyes and proceeds to read.                                                                                                                            “I want to and besides we haven’t talked about what happened” I said hoping she would open up a little.                                                                                                                                                                                                            “Not tonight.” She stated and I deflated a little but continued to stay with throughout the night. I woke up to Serena placing a blanket over me and sitting back on the chair reading another book on ancient ruins. I slowly closed my eyes again and drifted into an easy sleep.</p>
