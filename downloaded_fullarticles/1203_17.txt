  <span>Harry had near broken during the war. It had destroyed much of his life and because of it he found himself not really caring about the rest of it. He had become an auror like was to be expected, he had even married Ginny but that had ended in disaster. Now here he was five years after the war in a home left to him by Sirius with nothing else to do. He was still working for the auror’s but now it was mostly as an instructor. He had enough of fighting and teaching was something he really enjoyed. Ever since he and Ginny had split up and he had taken custody of Teddy, his life was complete. He loved the little boy, he loved teaching. He didn’t need anything else and was quite pleased that most people left him alone. Ron and Hermione visited but they were so busy with their twins they didn’t have much time for anything else. Ginny came over every once in awhile to tell him about some new boyfriend, but he saw through it. She was trying to make him jealous but it wouldn't work. He just had no interest in her and no interest in love in general. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>So it was a surprise for him when, one early summer day, he received an owl from Gringotts requesting his presence at the bank. He was nervous at first, looking at the entrance to the great bank. They were probably still angry at him over the whole break in and dragon business. Nevertheless he did indeed walk in and was met with many different looks. Some goblins peered at him with anger, others with envy, and a few seemed to be very pleased or even amused. But he had brought a secret weapon with him this time. A gift of apology one could say. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He had approached Griphook, one of the goblins he had come to enjoy the presence of. As always, the goblin greeted him with a grin that seemed entirely teeth and then he was led back to a large room were a goblin easily three times his size sat behind a large desk. His fingers curled oddly and his nose large and crooked over thin lips. He took a deep breath before introducing himself, “I am Harry Potter, you asked to see me sir?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The goblin looked at him with an odd sort of look, “Ah yes, our greatest thief. I am Goblin Lord Cester, tell me Mr. Potter, would you do it again?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry blinked in confusion before thinking it over, “Yes, at the time… there was no other choice. It was needed to stop the war. Without it, we never would have won, and Voldemort would still be alive. The deaths over the years would have been for nothing.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He was regarded cooly, “Very well, though I am not pleased to know this, your intentions are clear. I must say… it was rather a daring move. You also of course helped point out some… flaws in our defences. However, you created a lot of damage in your wake.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The wizard winced, “I am willing to pay for all the damages.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Cester chuckled, “Oh, I bet you are. Despite your act of theft, you are a man of your heart and values. We know this. We will deduct the costs from your accounts. I dare say we need a new dragon as well, but the Romanians have offered us one of their own in exchange, a pretty female named Norberta. I believe you know her?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry looked up and blinked, “Yes sir. I was at her hatching.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Indeed. You will help get her here then as she does know you. Now, I believe that is all the business as of today. I’m sure you were brought here for an entirely different reason.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The wizard nodded and produced the letter, “You sent me this sir.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lord Cester took it and read it over then summoned a few documents to his desk. They floated about on unfelt winds and he glanced over them, “Ah yes… a letter was left here for you. Only to be delivered after the war was won.” He grabbed the floating paperwork and handed it to a smaller goblin who bustled out the door to go grab whatever it was. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry smiled softly, “Dumbledore I am guessing, he was always the one to do this sort of thing. Oh sir, I did bring something for you, for the bank really.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The massive goblin peered down at him, “Oh?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The wizard nodded and slowly unhooked the scabbard from his belt and pulled the sword from under his robe  and set it carefully on his desk, “The Sword of Gryffindor. I would like to gift this back to the bank. Until it is needed once again.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lord Cester stared down at the weapon, his eyes wide as he gently picked it up, “This is… one of our own goblin made pieces. To hold it is… a true honor. Thank you Lord Potter,” the sudden use of his title surprised him but he said nothing.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The smaller goblin ran back in holding an envelope and presented it to Harry. He took it and opened it carefully as a seat was brought out for him and he sat down. It seemed the goblins were treating him differently now, and not like a child in need of scolding. Carefully he opened it and took out the letter inside, it was weighted oddly and heavy. As he unfolded it, a key dropped out that he had to catch. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Dear Harry,</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>My boy, I wish I had been there to see you at your moment of victory. But I knew you could do it. I am sorry my boy, for placing so much on your young shoulders. Truly if there had been another way I would have taken it. It seemed both of us had been destined for a hard life filled with heartbreak and pain. I only hope now that your war is over, that you can begin to enjoy life and take each day with a full heart. Remember Harry, never give up your dreams, but don't drown in them either.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>All my love,</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Albus Dumbledore.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry lifted the key and frowned at it, what could Dumbledore had left him that he wouldn’t explain it in the letter? He looked at the goblin who was still examining the sword with a gleeful look of awe. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>When he held up the key however the goblin tucked the sword away and took it looking it over, “This belongs to one of the old vaults. I’ll have one of the younger goblins take you down to it. Thank you again Lord Potter. I do believe we will be very good friends.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The wizard blinked and took the key back before following the smaller goblin down the hall and to a large cart that looked older than the ones they normally used to take people down to vaults. Climbing in he gripped the side ready for the stomach wrenching ride that would await him. He had never been a fan of these carts. His grip tightened as they went careening down the tracks and twisting around corners, looping in full circles, at one point they even did a full upside down loop that had his stomach near lurching and him losing his lunch. It was even more stomach jumping when they slammed to a stop and he toppled forward into the goblin who did not say a word but he could see the gleeful twinkle in his eye. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Stumbling out he walked to the vault door and let the goblin take the key and unlock it. When the door swung open he was met with an empty vault. Frowning he stepped into it and walked around the vault. Why would Dumbledore leave him an empty vault. He walked around slowly and once he made it to the other side he turned back toward the entrance and froze. All he could see was himself. Staring back at him. Slowly he walked forward and touched his reflection carefully. Slowly his eyes went up and the writing slowly appeared at the top and he smiled. The Mirror of Erised. How long had it been since he had seen this?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He looked at his reflection once more and waited for the reflection to change to his heart's desire. But it didn't. He frowned and looked at it carefully trailing fingers along the cool surface. Then it wasn’t his reflection anymore. The very surface rippled and staring back at him was a man around the same age as him. Long black hair falling to his waist in waves. Pale skin and dressed in clothing he didn’t recognize. They seemed to be old, outdated even. Why would he be seeing this? Carefully he tapped the glass and the eyes shot opened revealing silver orbs that looked at him with such anger and intensity. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He stumbled back some and pulled out his wand on instinct but the form didn't come at him. He just stayed in the mirror glaring at the other. He didn’t seem to be able to get out of the mirror? But why was he there to begin with? The last time he had seen something like this it was with the stone were it randomly appeared in his pocket. Was the mirror like a cage? Its own dimensional cage? He sighed and just wasn’t sure in the end. But he would find out more when he got it home. He looked at the goblin, “Can I get the mirror delivered to my place?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The goblin nodded, “We will do that for a small fee yes. Are you ready to go sir?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry nodded and looked to the figure in the glass once more and sighed, following the goblin out the door and up they went. Once back in the office he signed the paperwork and was on his way home. He didn’t like being away from Teddy for long, even if Andromeda did enjoy babysitting the young toddler. He was the last family he had connected to his parents. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>------</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Two weeks had passed since he inherited the Mirror. He had moved it into his study were it was away from Teddy. He didn’t have to instruct anyone new till the next graduation. For now though he was drowning in books. Looking up and trying to find anything related to the mirror and how it was used. He found countless stories of it being stolen and pillaged by muggles and many dying and wasting away in front of the mirror. He managed to even find a small journal by a woman who owned it and catalogued everything she ever saw and when in the mirror. It wasn't until her near last entry that he found something useful.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>

</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>I saw something new. It was something I had never seen before in the mirror. I have spent 97 long years peering into this blasted mirror, using it to live my life to its fullest. Now I am at the end of my days and I had hoped to see nothing but myself within its image. That was not meant to be. I looked within and saw him. He looked like he slept. Stuck in time as well as place. At first I had thought maybe it was some midnight fantasy of mine, a dream I had that was brought to life in the mirror. It wasn’t until he moved that I knew it was no illusion. At first I did not know what to say to this being. I tried talking to him, but he could not hear nor respond. Then I remembered the writing on the top. I used chalk to write out, asking him a single question, ‘who are you’. At first he didn’t respond but in his hand chalk appeared and he wrote back, ‘I am It’s creator’, then he vanished within the mirror itself. I never saw him again, I never saw anything in the mirror again… </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry frowned and looked to the mirror that he had place near a window for the natural light. Slowly he walked over holding a piece of charcoal in his hand. Slowly he stepped in front of the mirror and almost immediately the male appeared, he smiled softly and began to write on the surface of the mirror, ‘Hello, My name is Harry’.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The male tilted his head and rolled his eyes before lifting his own piece of charcoal and wrote back, `I know, I am </span>
  <span>Tathor. I have seen you come to the mirror thrice before. The second, you took the stone.’</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The wizard frowned, ‘You knew about the stone?’</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The man nodded, ‘It was entrusted to me by the one called Albus. He discovered my many years ago. After the death of his lover.’</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry nodded and finally wrote, ‘Why are you in the mirror?’</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He could see the other grin and shaking his head, ‘I was trapped upon the completion of the mirror. I gave myself to its creation. That was a long time ago.’</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The wizard nodded but the curiosity got to him, ‘do you regret it?’</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The man’s face changed to one of surprise. His silver eyes widening then slowly, a shaking hand lifted and wrote a single word, ‘yes’.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry nodded and sighed softly, he could understand regrets. The want and need to correct past mistakes. He slowly began looking at the mirror and frowned touching the intricate designs seeing if he could find an irregularity or maybe see how it was made. He had the creator trapped in its surface. Maybe he could find a way to get him free, he knew how emotionally devastating it was to be trapped or caged. He wouldn’t enjoy it, and certainly couldn’t leave another in that state if he knew about it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The wizard stepped back over to the mirror and wrote carefully, ‘How did you make the mirror, maybe if I know how, I can undo it.’</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The man paused a moment and wondered how to convey such knowledge in only a few sentences. </span>
  <span>The magic of the mirror erased the words written on it quickly so it would be hard to write everything out in that way. But then… the mirror could transport things, from one realm to the other as it had with the chalk, philosopher's stone, and charcoal. Whatever the other held he could to and vice versa. ‘Blank book and writing utensil, look in the mirror and hold them. Will them within the mirror.’</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry nodded and went over to his desk removing one of the journal’s he had bought for research and a muggle pen. Walking back to the mirror he held them up and closed his eyes. He looked deep into himself and worked to touch his magical core until finally he felt like a great tug pulled at him and his hands felt lighter. The green eyes opened and looked at the male in the mirror who now held the book and pen in his hands. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>This was going to be an interesting summer. </span>
