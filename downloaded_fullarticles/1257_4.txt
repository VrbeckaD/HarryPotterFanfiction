    <p>   In the middle of a dark room, a woman lay propped up on an expensive bed. The woman rested one arm over her bulging stomach, the other gripping the bed post behind her. It was obvious to anyone who saw her that she was with child. Not to mention she had bragged shamelessly about the family her and her husband were to create. While they were on the wrong side of history, neither seemed to care in the moment. Their baby was coming soon enough. Sooner than the mother thought was safe. Her nurses had warned her that births this early could mean there was more that one baby. Impossible, thought the woman. She knew she was having one, her mother's intuition told her so. </p><p>   At least, that was what she would say when the idea of twins was brought up.  Oh, how she secretly prayed for just the one child. She knew the fate that came with a set of twins. Her husband knew the fate as well. And as she continued to grip the bed post everything became crystal clear. The nurses and house elves were silenced by the cries of a newborn. The woman smiled as tears rolled down her eyes. It's a boy, she heard them call out. A nurse took him from the room to clean him. A boy, the woman thought. How wonderful. A single boy. Her hopes came true. She knew her family would be free of fate's cruel hand. </p><p>   For ten whole minutes she went on believing she was fine. The nurses handed her the beautiful boy and she cradled him with glee. His little eyes barely opened. All of a sudden a harsh pain spread throughout her body, something she had never felt before. She screamed and her baby boy was quickly taken from her arms. The nurses returned to her quickly and assessed the situation. They tried to reach her, but failed miserably. She was blinded by the pain. She couldn't hear the nurses warnings. </p><p>   What she could see, though, was a silhouette in her mind. It moved closer and revealed itself to be a girl. She had long, platinum blonde hair, like the woman. She also had the woman's eyes; blue with a hint of grey. She began to notice other features they shared, along with the tears pouring down her face. You could tell the girl had been through hell and back just by looking at her. Just as the girl was about to speak, an infant's cry was all the woman could hear. </p><p>   She was instantly back from her "daydream" and saw one of the nurses holding a baby. Twins. A boy and a girl. The woman felt conflicted feelings of joy and fear. She knew what it meant if she were to bear twins. She also knew what she had to do in order to protect her babies. </p><p>   Unfortunately, her husband arrived earlier than she expected. She was speaking with one of the nurses when the doors to her room flew open. He stalked towards her, grinning. He stopped and her bedside and kneeled, grabbing her hand. </p><p>"How are you, my love?" He asked her. </p><p>"I'm fine, dear. Just a little tired." She smiled back at him. </p><p>"And the baby? How is the baby?" </p><p>She braced herself. "The babies are doing well."</p><p>"Babies?" He asked. </p><p>"Twins, Lucius. One boy, one girl." She watched as he grinned even more. She couldn't help but smile. Though she was very aware of the life her babies were to endure, the happiness that her husband felt in that moment was enough to make her forget. </p><p>"Oh, Narcissa," He composed himself. "We must notify the dark lord immediately. He will want to see the children."</p><p>   She nodded, knowing that even though she didn't want their lord anywhere near the twins, it had to be allowed. That didn't mean that the new mother couldn't stall for a bit. </p><p>"My dear, can't it wait til tomorrow," she petitioned. "I'm very tired, and I'm sure the children are too. We haven't named them. You haven't even seen them! We can notify the dark lord in the morning. Let us enjoy our first nights as parents." </p><p>   She convinced her husband easily. She had bought herself one night to do what she knew she must do. She played along with her husband until night had fallen and they lay soundly in their bed. She waited until she knew he was asleep and slipped out of bed. She removed her robe and dressed herself. </p><p>   The babies lay together in their nursery. She reached into the crib and grabbed her daughter. After remembering the images she saw while giving birth to the baby girl, she was sure of which baby was spoken about in the prophecy. She held onto the girl as she apperated out of the house. </p><p> </p><p>Ten Years Later </p><p> </p><p>   Two children, one boy and one girl, walked with each other in a train station in London. The boy was talking the girl's ear off with nonsense about their new school. The girl responded with silent nods and faint smiles. </p><p>"I can't wait to get to Hogwarts. Think about what we'll be bring to the table, Evie! I doubt Slytherin is ready for what we've got!" The boy exclaimed. </p><p>"Slytherin isn't ready for your loud mouth, Draco, so I suggest you shut it up." Their father scolded the boy, leaving him embarrassed. </p><p>     The girl stayed silent, knowing all too well what her fate would be is she decided to act out of turn. She continued to look forward and not at her twin brother. She felt slight guilt that she could not back him up, but knew he understood why. It had been years since the girl had spoken more than one word sentences. It wasn't that she couldn't talk, she just chose to stay not to. She had taken a life long vow of silence, and refused to budge. It was not very practical and had gotten her in trouble with her father on various occasions, but she didn't care. Nothing she could do could change her relationship with her father. And at this point in her life she did not want to even try. </p><p>    Both tended to stand closer to their mother, especially the girl. Her love made up for her husbands lack of empathy towards the children. Their mother went and hugged her son first, and to her dismay he only allowed it to go on for less than a minute before pushing her away. She was saddened by the affect her husband had on her boy. She didn't even have time to turn towards her daughter before the young girl was holding onto her mother. The mother held in the way she felt about her poor girl, and hugged onto her. Once the hugging had ceased, their father nodded to the boy, but scowled at the girl. The girl wasn't the least bit surprised. The two boarded the train, the girl lingering in the entrance, before following her brother. They made their way into a compartment. </p><p>   Their destination; Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The boy sat with his sister, until the door opened to be his minions. He looked at his sister apologetically before telling her he would be back. She nodded and gave him a faint smile, which he returned. He left her to sit in silence. Luckily for her, she was used to it. </p><p>    About an hour into their train ride, the girl got bored, and went to find her brother. She knew he would be off causing trouble. She eventually found him walking with his minions. The girl tapped his shoulder, and he turned and looked at her. He made the two boys move for her and they walked side by side. The boy stopped at a particular compartment and opened the door.</p><p>"Is it true?" The boy began. "They're saying all down the train that Harry Potter's in this compartment." The girl's eyes lit up. "So it's you, is it?" </p><p>"Yes." The dark haired boy with glasses said. </p><p>"Oh, this is Crabbe and this is Goyle." He spoke pointing to the two busty boys. "And my name's Malfoy. Draco Malfoy. This is my twin sister, Evelyn." The small girl waved slightly, before ducking her head. With her family's history, she was extremely embarrassed to be in the boy who lived's presence. The red headed boy next to Harry coughed, trying to conceal a snicker. </p><p>"Think my name's funny, do you? No need to ask you who you are. My father told me all Weasley's have red hair, freckles, and more children than they can afford." The boy snakily spoke. The girl responded to her brother's rude comment by lightly squeezing the back of his arm. After all her years of non-verbal communication, she had figured out other ways to get her feelings across. The squeeze was a warning from the girl. </p><p>"You'll soon find out that some wizarding families are better than others, Potter. You don't want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there." She wanted to scream at her brother's obliviousness. He had obviously gotten the message, but could not care less. </p><p>"I think I can tell who the wrong sort are but thanks." The girl suppressed her  laughter and settled for a smirk as her brother tried to warn the boy he was interested in befriending. After another rejection, the three boys stalked off, the girl following after giving the boys a small wave goodbye. </p><p>   Once they had all arrived in the compartment, her brother began to express his frustrations. All the girl could do was roll her eyes at his ludicrous comments. She was more focused on Harry Potter. The boy who lived was real. The girl's guilt set in. It definitely wasn't her fault that her parents were death eaters, but she felt like it was sometimes. She wanted to put those feelings aside, and reach out to the boy. She pulled a piece of parchment and quill from her trunk and opened the compartment door. </p><p>"Evie," her brother said once he noticed she was at the door. "Where are you going?" She just smiled and walked out. It wasn't a long journey to the compartment Harry Potter and the Weasley boy were in. She had already scribed her first message to them when she opened the door. They looked up, and she presented them with her words. </p><p>'Do you mind if I join you?'</p><p>   The boys took a second, glancing at each other. Their first impression of her was not bad, compared to her brother's. It didn't help the red-headed boy wasn't a fan of the malfoy's </p><p>"Come on in." The boy who lived said, moving over for her. She nodded as a sign of thank you. She could tell the Weasley boy was on edge with her. </p><p>"You don't seem to be much of a talker, unlike your brother." She shook her head. </p><p>"Do you ever talk?" Harry Potter asked sincerely. </p><p>'Never.' She wrote on her piece of parchment. </p><p>"Why not?" The boy who lived asked. </p><p>'I would prefer not to elaborate on it.' She respectfully scribed.</p><p>"That's okay. Don't feel pressured to talk. You can keep writing." He smiled at her, and she returned one to him. She sat with the two boys the rest of the way, laughing and writing to them. It was a very enjoyable trip. She was very glad to have opted out of hearing her brother drone on about how his friendship was rejected. </p><p>   The train stopped and the girl walked off in a plain uniform, her robes crestless. She followed the two boys as they walked toward a giant like man. </p><p>"Hey Hagrid!" Harry called out to the man yelling for the "firs years". </p><p>"Ah, hello there Harry! Who are these two?" He asked pointing to the two kids standing next to Harry. </p><p>"Ron Weasley sir."</p><p>"And that's Evelyn Malfoy." The girl waved and smiled but the man tensed a bit. She knew why. Her last name had an influence on people. </p><p>"Well, come on you three. To the boats." </p><p>   Once she reached the boats, the girl's brother had pulled her away. She was now stuck in a boat with him and his goons. They set sail across the lake. She lost herself in thought as the castle came in. There seemed to be a short collective silence at the beauty that radiated off their new home. She was in awe the entire time. She finally pulled herself back to earth when they were standing in front of a older witch wearing emerald green robes. </p><p>"Welcome to Hogwarts. The start of term banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats you will be sorted into your houses. The Sorting is a very important ceremony because, while you are here, your house will be something like your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your house, sleep in your house dormitory, and spend free time in your house common room. The four houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin." The girl automatically knew she would be placed in Slytherin. She was a descendent from two important pureblood families. </p><p>"Each house had its own noble history and each had produced outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs will earn your house points, while any rulebreaking will lose house points. At the end of each year, the house with the most points is awarded the house cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever house becomes yours. </p><p>"The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can while you are waiting." She eyed the students before continuing. </p><p>"I shall return when we are ready for you, please wait quietly." The witch walked away leaving the students to quietly converse with others around them. </p><p>   In the chaos of first years the girl slipped away from her brother and towards her new friends. She stood and listened to Harry and Ron's conversation. They talked to her and she nodded and made gestures to make up for the lack of writing utensils. From time to time she would look back at her brother and watch as his disgust was projected towards her. She couldn't help their different views on handling situations. She wished it didn't have to be the way it was. Finally the witch returned and all fell silent. </p><p>"Follow me children." They walked into what was knows as the Great Hall,  and lined up. Professor McGonagall, whose name she had just learned, began to call off the names. The first years were called by their last names, alphabetically</p><p>"Abbott, Hannah!"</p><p>"HUFFLEPUFF!" The girl waited as she heard name after name be called. It wasn't until many names had been called that she heard a very familiar one . </p><p>"Malfoy, Draco!" Her eyes darted to her twin brother. He swaggered up and sat down. The hat barely touched his head when it made its decision. </p><p>"SLYTHERIN!" She wasn't surprised she expected the same when her turn came around. </p><p>"Malfoy, Evelyn!" The girl walked up and sat on the stool. The hat fell on her head. </p><p>"Ah, Evelyn Malfoy, descendant from both the Black and Malfoy family. The obvious choice would be Slytherin, correct? But that's not where you belong. I see that you are needed somewhere else. You are needed in, GRYFFINDOR!" She was shocked as she got up and walked to the Gryffindor table. She sat next to a girl with big bushy hair. She couldn't exactly recall her name, but recognized her uptight expressions from earlier. </p><p>"Hello there. I'm Hermione Granger." She smiled at Hermione and was given a very confused face. </p><p>"Oh, do you not speak? Well, that's perfectly fine. I find it fascinating that some people can't speak, or choose not to. I, personally, wouldn't last long as a mute, but who knows how long you've been doing it. It would be nice if you have some paper and a quill, that way this wasn't a one sided conversation. Although I have been carrying it very well, I'd like to get your input."</p><p>"Potter, Harry!" Hermione's rambling was cut short as everyone turned and looked at The Boy Who Lived. The girl could tell he was afraid of something as he mumbled to the sorting hat before it made its decision.  </p><p>"GRYFFINDOR!" The hat yelled. Harry smiled and made his way to the table where the two girls he had met on the train were seated. He sat across from the girl. Almost all of Gryffindor was shouting, "We Got Potter!" Harry sat talking to the girls before they heard Ron's name. </p><p>"Weasley, Ronald." The professor called. His new friends smiled at him as he walked up nervously. </p><p>The hat almost immediately shouted, "GRYFFINDOR!" Ron's face turned back to its natural color as he sat down at the Gryffindor table.</p><p>"We're all together!" Harry said. </p><p>Unknowingly, Ron ruined the girl's mood. "Evelyn, what are your parents going to say?" He asked her. She shrugged her shoulders, and began to think about what would happen when her parents found out. She was terrified. Disappointment from her mom would mean she would not try to defend her daughter when her father's anger struck. </p><p>  After dinner, Evelyn was barely listening to the Gryffindor prefect Percy. All she could think about was her fate. Her fathers fury was an evil she was not prepared for. All the excitement had been shoved away by the looming thought of her father. She was finally able to push those thoughts away long enough to get directions on her dormitory. She made her way to the list of names that would tell her who her roommates were. </p><p>  When she found her name she saw she was with Hermione Granger, the talkative girl from dinner, and two other girls; Lavender Brown and Pavarti Patil. Opening the door she saw her trunk placed in front of a four poster bed. Her roommates were already settling in. She received two large squeals from Lavender and Pavarti. </p><p>"Hi! You must be Evelyn Malfoy," The first girl said. "I'm Lavender Brown!"</p><p>"Oh, and I'm Pavarti Patil! We're all gonna have so much fun!" The other girl said. </p><p>"Can you keep your fun down? I won't be able to study if your squeals get any louder." Hermione said from her bed. Evelyn smiled and held her giggle in as she made her way to her trunk. </p><p>"You're not gonna say anything? You're just gonna walk away? You're just as bad her her." Lavender said. </p><p>"She's mute. She doesn't talk." Hermione said while organizing her books. </p><p>   Evelyn opened her trunk up and searched for parchment, her quill, and ink. She finally found them and placed them on her new bed. She found her pajamas and made her way to the bath room to change. She removed her robes and dressed herself in nice silk pajamas her mother had picked out. She walked back out and heard the girl's obsessing over her the silk. She picked up her quill and began her letter to her mother. </p><p>Dear Mother,<br/>
     I thought I should fill you in on the events that occurred when Draco and I reached Hogwarts. I regret to inform you that unlike Draco, I was not put in Slytherin. My house is Gryffindor. I  hope you are not disappointed, like father will be. Though I should have been in Slytherin I shall try to make the best of it. I wait patiently for you response. </p><p>              ~ Evelyn </p><p>  When the girl was satisfied with her letter, she set it next to her bed. She planned on going to the owlery the next day. She fell asleep still thinking about the repercussions of being sorted into Gryffingor. Though she didn't know it in that moment, she was needed in Gryffindor, as the hat said. There would come a day in her life when she would have to choose between her friends and her family. And her decision would affect  everyone.</p>
