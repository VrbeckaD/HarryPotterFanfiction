    <em>I hope this letter finds you as soon as you reach your destination and not handed back to me when they ship your body back to England. You should have known by now that I am a coward, and selfish, and mean. I suppose admitting all these are inane at this point, but I am just reaffirming what we both know.</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Before you left, I thought to myself, if I knew that, and you knew that, why are we fighting over this? I thought you knew what I entailed when you kissed me. </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>I thought you knew, despite my cowardness, how I always felt about you. My poor love, born only after I saw you dead by Voldemort’s feet. It is something I thought would never come to fruition, ground full of it, scattered and unwanted. </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>But it wasn’t unwanted, and you gathered it unknowingly, and I wanted it to stay unknown for some time because — we’ve already established that I am a coward.</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>When you left and came back and told me you took the assignment you said you wouldn’t, and as I stood, once again frozen with fear, and let you leave again, I realize as I realized on that awful day where I saw you die, nothing was scarier than losing you. It was a soft feeling. It was lovely.</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>And as we had too established, I am selfish, and I thought about going home, but I couldn’t find you. I am selfish, Harry, and I want you home. Home. For no other reason than: I lov-</em>

</blockquote><p>Harry turned the corner to the kitchen and saw Draco sitting there. Draco jumped up at the sight of him, flushing and shocked, then scared.</p>
<p>“You’re back,” Draco said, his eyes bright. “You got my letter?”</p>
<p>“I didn’t finish it,” Harry said, angry. He slammed the letter on the table and strode to Draco. “I am not hearing it from a letter.”</p>
<p>Draco didn’t hesitate this time, like he was wont to. He wound his arms around Harry’s neck and held on. “I love you.”</p>
<p>Harry folded Draco into his arms. Closed his eyes. Voice small, he said, “You do?”</p>
<p>“I do. I do,” Draco said. “I’ve always had. I love you.”</p>
<p>The words stuck to something important inside Harry. Sticky and gooey that made Harry hard to breathe. Draco said it again, now silently, against Harry’s cheek. Harry turned his head just so, catching onto the last syllable, and met it with a kiss. </p>
