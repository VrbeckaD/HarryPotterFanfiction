          <div class="userstuff"><p>Lord Voldemort approached Harry, his long black robes flowing like a dark mist around him. The surrounding Death Eaters watched with bated breath as he raised a single skeletal finger to hover over Harry Potter's scar.</p>
<p>"<em>I can touch you now</em>," he breathed, his sibilant voice carrying easily in the silent graveyard. For so long, he had dreamed of this moment, of making the Boy-Who-Lived writhe in pain beneath his hands. Retribution for thirteen long years as a wraith would finally be his this night …</p>
<p>Harry's eyes widened as Voldemort moved in--</p>
<p>"BAKA--!!" he screamed, slamming his head back into the stone.</p>
<p>Voldemort froze, slit eyes flaring wide in surprise.</p>
<p>Harry wriggled furiously in his bonds. "YOU STUPID--!! WHY? WHY WOULD I?? IN YOUR DREAMS! DON'T KISS ME, BAKA!!!"</p>
<p>The Dark Lord drew back, perturbed, and looked at Wormtail as if searching for support, or just confirmation that this was really happening.</p>
<p>Wormtail looked blankly back at him. Master and servant, for once equal partners in bewilderment.</p>
<p>"Kiss you--?" Voldemort began, squinting. Was this a ploy of some kind?</p>
<p>"NOOOOOOoooo!! NO! YOU BULBACIOUS BABBLING BLOB BAKA!! <em>YOU NO KISS!!</em>"</p>
<p>Voldemort let his hand fall.</p>
<p>"P-Perhaps he h-has gone mad with fear, my Lord?" Wormtail simpered.</p>
<p>But upon realising that Voldemort no longer intended to touch him, a most drastic change came over Harry Potter. He avoided their eyes and began to fidget as well as his bonds would allow.</p>
<p>"Okay, no … I didn't mean it …" he spluttered, blushing prettily. "You can touch if you really want, okay? But only … only a little … you may pat --"</p>
<p>He tilted his head forwards, proffering his scalp.</p>
<p>"But only pat, you understand?"</p>
<p>"You would like Lord Voldemort to … pat you?" Voldemort asked, unable to believe his ears. Surely this could not be the child of prophecy?</p>
<p>Although, there had been another one, hadn't there? A *Neville Longbottom* … Voldemort would have to learn more about him … research his life, his accomplishments. Perhaps he had been too hasty in targeting the half-blood; perhaps it was the pureblood who was the true danger…</p>
<p>Harry nodded. "Just a little, okay? And … and only because <em>you </em>want to … not <em>I</em>--"</p>
<p>"I believe playtime is over," Voldemort said, raising his pale wand.</p>
<p>"DON'T TELL ME WHAT TO DO!! YOU NERD! <em>NERD!!</em>" Harry screamed, all his coyness disappearing like water down a drain. "WHO ARE YOU??? PLAYTIME - MEH - WHO ARE YOU CALLING A CHILD, BAKA??"</p>
<p>Lord Voldemort needed a stiff drink after this.</p></div>
