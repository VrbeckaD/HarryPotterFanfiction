          <div class="userstuff"><p>“Celestite,” said Luna, casting her misty blue eyes down at the crystal Draco held in his hands. “<em>Very</em> powerful. Are you interested in accessing the angelic realm? It would aid your meditation-”</p>
<p>“Er…<em>No</em>. Thank you though.” Draco interrupted, carefully placing the aquamarine stone back on the display. </p>
<p>Relaxing enough to meditate seemed highly unlikely, not when he considered the large pile of open cases littering his desk at St. Mungos. As for accessing the <em>angelic realm?</em> Draco wanted to be open-minded about Luna’s eccentricities, he truly did, but his patience with everything unworldly and spiritual was wearing parchment-thin.</p>
<p>~@~</p>
<p>Harry had made the grand announcement that Draco and he would be attending <em>Lovegood’s Mystic CrystalMoon Fayre</em> whilst the pair of the them had lain in bed that very morning. </p>
<p>Draco groaned, pulling the sheets over his head in annoyance. It had seemed a grievous shame to waste a Sunday that could <em>easily</em> be spent in a naked tangle with his beloved in a draughty hall with the more… <em>outlandish</em> members of wizarding society. Harry, it seemed, wouldn't be put off.</p>
<p>“It’ll be a laugh,” Harry had announced, throwing a jumper in Draco’s direction. “You could get your aura read, love. Have your fortune told-”</p>
<p>“I can tell my own fortune, Potter. Got an <em>Outstanding</em> in that bloody OWL.” Draco hitched himself up on an elbow, pulling the jumper over his head. “You told me yourself that all that hippy mumbo-jumbo isn’t real magic. So <em>why</em> exactly are we wasting our Sunday on this?”</p>
<p>“Promised Luna,” Harry admitted, looking sheepish. “Last week in the Leaky… She seemed so chuffed. Sent two tickets over by owl.”</p>
<p>“Doesn’t look like I’ve got a ruddy choice then,” huffed Draco, sulkily. </p>
<p><em>Bloody Potter!</em> He still couldn’t understand how he’d come to be married to the kindest wizard in the whole of England. </p>

<p>“Perhaps the Quartz then?” Luna asked, looking hopeful. “It’s know as the <em>Soulmate</em> Crystal. Wizards who purchase Quartz will have harmony forever.”</p>
<p>Draco sighed, deliberately shutting down the rational part of his brain. </p>
<p>“Two Galleons?” he asked, fishing out his wallet. </p>
<p>“And don’t you <em>dare</em> tell a soul!” Draco hissed at the chortling Harry stood next to him.</p></div>
