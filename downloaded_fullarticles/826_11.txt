    <p>Old Saint Nick came down the chimney in a flash. He was looking at the tree, with quite a few presents. Three stockings full of candy. He looked at his list again.  There should be four. His great, great granddaughter's son was supposed to be here. </p><p>     He heard small crying sounds; like from a nightmare; coming from the cupboard under the stairs. What he found, put his great, great granddaughter's half sister and her husband; on the naughty list, for life.</p><p>Come little one. I'm your real family. We must go. Work to do, but after work, you will learn and have fun, before I retire. He took out some candy that was to go in the stockings of the boys. </p><p>He emptied the other two, put coal in them. Then a paper in each, enchanted to say naughty list, no presents. Any gift for them, disappears and reappears at the local orphanage.</p><p>Harry grew up with Santa and the elves. The elves, Saint Nicks, and X-mas magic destroyed the Horcrux, but left the spell knowledge.</p><p>Harry Turned nine and like all major magicals, hit puberty. He talked to the picture of Missus Claus about the wet dreams, and how he was always hard.</p><p>She talked to the Elves. He was shown by seven female Elves how to relieve himself and them. When he hit ten, he learned how to be an animagus. He was a Stag and cavorted with the deer. Learned to be an Elf and the seven young ones, became his for life. </p><p>By the time he turned eleven, he could become any body or creature he saw, in a blink of an eye. Nick had also had him going over the nice and naughty lists for two years. Nice only at nine, both at ten.</p><p>The letter from Hogwarts was a surprise. Nick and Harry talked about it. Nick decided that Harry had to go, to learn interactions, and to find his Missus. After much thought and research, they realized that by the Wizarding law, he could have several Missuses.</p><p>Missus Claus talked to him, actually more than Nick every did.  The Elves more than both of them. She and the Elves, convinced him to find several girls, as Old Nick had been lonely for more than a few years.</p><p>Nick gave Harry the Present list for the poor magicals, which included Squibs. Harry was shocked to see the books about himself, that were not true. He put the publishers names on the warning list. That list is for people not naughty, but close to being there.</p>
