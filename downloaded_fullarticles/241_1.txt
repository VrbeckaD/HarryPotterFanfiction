    <p>Recently ten year old Harry James Potter was excited, more so than he’d ever been in his life as far as he can remember. When he had first started going to primary school the messy haired boy had foolishly hoped that things would be different for him there than they were at Number 4 Private Drive, that he would make friends and be able to learn to his heart’s content. But now, 5 years later, the green eyed child had long since realized that his relatives would never allow that.</p><p>Dudley had chased away any and all potential friends while Aunt Petunia had gleefully poisoned the staff’s minds with the same tripe she fed the neighbors that they, despite being professionals that should know better, ate up the way the Dursleys gorged themselves on the meals Harry would cook for them. And after the beatings Harry received from Uncle Vernon every time he outdid Dudley mark-wise the spectacled boy quickly learned to keep his intellect hidden away the same way he hid the strange gifts he alone possessed, like the way he could understand and speak to the snakes that always sought him out every time he’d garden for Aunt Petunia to “earn his keep”.</p><p>Harry had thought that this year would be much of the same, if a little more tolerable thanks to the arrangement he’d made with his cousin last year. Harry would do Dudley’s homework for him, freeing up his cousin to have whatever fun he desired, in exchange for the blonde boy pretending that he didn’t exist at all outside of Number 4 and his parents’ scrutiny. A fair trade considering it allowed Harry to leave for the local library all he wished “to ensure his cousin’s work was perfect” so long as he came home in time to cook dinner, leaving him free to enjoy all the calm and information he desired for the majority of every afternoon save weekends; where he cleaned the house and tended the garden.</p><p>But that was before their teacher announced their year’s extra credit assignment.</p><p>This year Harry and Dudley’s class was offered the chance to write to students from another school, which they would gain an automatic boost to their marks for doing, so long as they continued to write for the entire year. And thanks to his agreement with Dudley, and the larger boy’s disinterest with the project beyond the praise his parents gave for how smart it was for him to volunteer for it, Harry would be getting two pen-pals instead of just one! He couldn’t believe his luck!</p><p>Currently the black haired boy was sat in his usual table at the public library - a perpetually untouched corner one near the foreign language and other dictionary shelves that were practically useless in this drearily boring corner of Britain, especially now that everyone could just look up words and the like on the computer at home - and worked on penning out his first letters. He knew he couldn’t give out his name, in no small part because one of his pen-pals was actually supposed to be Dudley’s. But he also knew that both would need to be able to call him <strong><b>something</b></strong> or else they may get upset and stop writing to him.</p><p>As he was pondering what to make his alias, starting to get frustrated, he turned to work on his newest topic of study to try and refresh his mind before trying again. It was halfway through his study of ancient Norse culture, in particular their writing system of Futhark runes, that Harry found his answer in the chart of ancient symbols. Beaming the ten year old finally got to writing, taking particular joy in writing down the rune he’d chosen for his alias.</p><p> </p><p>------ </p><p> </p><p>L sighed as Wammy walked up to him, letter in hand, from his seat at his computer desk. The genius was already regretting his decision to join the local school board’s pen-pal program, but he knew that if he didn’t attempt an effort at socializing with non-Wammy House children then his guardian and surrogate father would never get off his case about overworking himself. Hopefully the child that had been chosen for him would be either smart enough to keep conversation with, or so abysmal a writer that he could make the elder man agree to let him drop the program altogether - at least for a little while.</p><p>As the twelve year old accepted the envelope, dark and tired eyes scanning its contents quickly after opening the nondescript packaging lazily but elegantly, his brows soon rose to disappear behind the wild black bangs that obscured much of his forehead. His pen-pal, this “Sowilo” as he chose to be called, was looking to be along the lines of the former of his hopes rather than the latter. Taking a sip of his tea and popping a sugar cube from the tray it rested on into his mouth the detective smiled.</p><p>Perhaps this socialization effort won’t be such a waste after all, Sowilo seemed to be rather intelligent based on this first letter of his.</p><p>L gently placed the letter down, thumb coming up to rest on his lip as he formulated his response in his head.</p><p>He, much like Sowilo but likely for different reasons, couldn’t just use his name in the letter but had to choose something to be referred to as. L was both his true name and his alias, as most would assume it’s the latter when he gives it anyways due to its unusual nature, and was rather infamous due to his popularity as a detective. He couldn’t risk drawing attention to himself by giving it to a child that may be smart enough to at least guess that L might actually be <strong><b>the</b></strong> L.  </p><p>The detective also had to test his new pen-pal. Sowilo, for as smart as they appeared to be, was probably not a genius on the same level at the raven himself was. And the fact that their letters may be glanced over by third parties like the child’s teacher or classmates made him reluctant to respond with his usual IQ tests or questions, so a change of strategy was in order… But what?</p><p>It was a second glance at the other child’s letter that had the boy’s black eyes gleaming with inspiration. Reaching into the drawer of his desk the genius pulled out a simple lined notebook and pen, popping another cube of sugar in his mouth as he starts writing down his response. This was going to be a perfect test of Sowilo’s resolve to write to him, and L was eager to discover just how intelligent and eager to converse the other was in his response.</p><p>It was likely that he’d need to wait a while for said response however, as the detective seriously doubted that Sowilo had ever heard - much less read - Japanese before and would have quite a challenge translating it.</p><p> </p><p>-------</p><p> </p><p>Brown eyes scanned their first letter from the pen-pal they’d received, wariness replaced with interest as their new acquaintance and hopefully first friend’s alias to ease any nerves and break the ice caught the white haired boy’s attention. Sowilo was a rune, an ancient one associated with protection, light, victory, and good luck. Glancing down at the even more ancient ring resting against his chest the eleven year old smiled weakly, knowing already what alias he had in mind.</p><p>Ryou Bakura had joined his current school’s pen-pal program in the hopes of talking with someone the spirit in the ancient Egyptian pendant his father had gifted him couldn’t frighten away or curse, maybe make a friend for once. Between the deaths of his mother and little sister, his father’s constant travels afterward, and the spirit’s habit of possessing him whenever he takes offense to something his peers at school say or do to him Ryou doesn’t really have any of those. But he wants one.</p><p>Sowilo seems to share his interest with ancient cultures and runes as well, given his alias and what the English-Japanese boy can gleam from the rest of his letter. So it’s with that in mind that the white-haired boy pens his response, feeling a bit of foreign-familiar amusement from the spirit of the ring at his own choice of alias; Ka. The Egyptian hieroglyph, a pair of connected and mirrored arms, was scrawled at the bottom of his letter in place of his signature.</p><p>Hopefully Sowilo took to Egyptian as quickly and fondly as he did Elder Futhark. And if he did, accepting Ryou’s offer of language lessons, their later letters may be even more interesting. It would be nice to speak to someone in one of his other tongues besides English, father was never around enough to spare more than an odd sentence or two and the eleven year old didn’t fancy leaving his skills to grow rusty until he can brush them off in the future… Whenever that would be.</p>
