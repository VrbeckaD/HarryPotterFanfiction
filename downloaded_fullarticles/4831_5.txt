    <p>Every bloke has a 'type.'  Some, including his dad's friend Remus Lupin, used to assume that Harry's 'type' was much the same as his father's: beautiful, outgoing redheads.  As it turned out, Ginny had been Harry's type, but not because of the color of her hair or her personality.  He was drawn to a very particular type of witch: one who played quidditch.  Was it the innate competitiveness of the sport, the fearlessness one had to display to excel on the pitch?  Harry couldn't say.  All he knew was that every witch he'd ever found himself drawn to was just as passionate about playing the sport as he was. </p>
<p>First there had been the embarrassing crush and the awkward, bumbling attempt at a teenaged romance with Cho.  Then the relationship with Ginny, which had been great before the war but had never truly been the same post-Voldemort.  After that had come a brief but passionate fling with Gwenog Jones.  He'd enjoyed all of these in their own way, but none could quite compare to his current lover.</p>
<p>Angelina Johnson was the most assertive, confident woman he'd ever met, let alone slept with.  When she wanted something, she went straight for it.  That had been true on the quidditch pitch.  It had been true at the outset of their relationship: they ran into each other at Quality Quidditch Supplies (where else?), got to talking, and before they parted hours later she asked him to dinner.</p>
<p>Nowhere was her boldness more evident than in the bedroom.  Angelina was passionate, kinky and loved being in control.  Some blokes might be intimidated by such an aggressive lover.  What fools they were!  They'd never get to experience anything close to what Harry was currently enjoying.</p>
<p>Angelina wore a smug smile as she rode him vigorously.  The loud thump that accompanied every collision between her toned arse and his legs was about as erotic a sound as he'd ever heard (well, aside from when she got truly worked up and started grunting like an animal.)  The bed springs were squeaking under the stress of their rough shagging.  They'd have to replace this bed before long.  It'd have to be something cheap though.  No sense in splurging for an expensive bed, because they'd inevitably wear it out.</p>
<p>His lover had worked up a sweat, and it only made her beautiful ebony skin look more appealing to him.  He reached up to cup and squeeze her bouncing breasts, but aside from that was perfectly content to watch his witch at work.  She was breathing heavily at this point, but he knew full well that this night was far from over.  He counted on it, in fact.</p>
<p>Maybe <i>that's</i> why he's drawn to fellow quidditch players: they possess the stamina and perseverance to push their bodies beyond the point of exhaustion in order to win.  And make no mistake, there would be no losers in the Potter flat tonight.</p>
