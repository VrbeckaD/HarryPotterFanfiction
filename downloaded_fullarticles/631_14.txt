</center><p>The spell hit him full in the chest, paralysing him instantly. His wand fell from his hand and rolled away across the dirt. His back cracked against a gravestone.</p><p>The terrible, searing pain down his spine was the only thing that told him he was still alive. The rest of his body felt dull and heavy, the nerves unresponsive, and he couldn’t so much as wriggle a finger or blink an eyelid. It was as if he’d been turned to stone.</p><p>In that moment he knew that Voldemort had won. He was utterly at his mercy, unable to fight back, defend himself or even scream in fear. The death-eaters knew it too. They all cheered with delight to see him sprawled out on the ground, limp as a rag doll. Their cries grew even more raucous when Voldemort bent down to retrieve Harry’s wand and held it up triumphantly.</p><p>He met Harry’s eyes deliberately before taking the thin strip of wood in both hands and splitting it in two. It snapped cleanly, like a common twig, it’s magical core breaking in an instant without so much as a splutter of sparks.</p><p>Voldemort smiled, threw away the pieces carelessly, and took a step toward Harry.</p><p>‘I think,’ he said in a silky voice. ‘You will bow to me now. Won’t you?’</p><p>He brandished his own wand, the twin of Harry’s broken one, and cast another unfamiliar spell. To Harry’s horror, his body started to move of his own accord, legs unfurling from underneath himself and arms stretching out. </p><p>He tried to fight against it, like he had the imperious curse, but this control seemed to come from outside of his body and there was nothing he could do to stop it. It was as if there was someone much larger and stronger than him grabbing at his limbs and pushing them into position. In moments he found himself on his knees before Voldemort, palms flat against the soil.</p><p>‘Good,’ Voldemort purred. ‘That’s much better, isn’t it? You’re an obedient little puppet now.’</p><p>As if to illustrate his point he flicked his wand upwards and Harry felt his head jerk back sharply, as if pulled by an invisible thread. His eyes watered and his back ached but there was nothing he could do but stare and stare with a doll’s glassy open eyes.</p><p>‘I want you to look at me,’ Voldemort advised coldly. ‘I want you to stare into the face of your killer and know just how futile it was to have ever dreamt of fighting.’</p><p>He tilted his head to one side, scarlet eyes narrowing slightly.</p><p>‘Then again,’ he murmured. ‘Perhaps it’s not necessary for you to see quite so clearly.’</p><p>He took a step closer and reached out to pluck the glasses off of Harry’s face. His long, white fingers grazed Harry’s skin as he dragged them down his nose, sending a fresh jolt of pain through Harry’s scar.</p><p>Voldemort held up the glasses for everyone to see, just as he had done with Harry’s wand, and then crushed them in his hand. The glass cracked in his palm and blood trickled down his wrist.</p><p>Harry’s vision was blurred now but he could still see the expression of monstrous satisfaction on the man’s pale face. The sight of him delighting in this childish act was somehow worse than anything that had come before. He was so utterly exultant in his conquest.</p><p>‘I could just as easily pluck out your eyes,’ Voldemort crooned softly, ‘blinding you and leaving you alone in the dark.’</p><p>He opened up his hand slowly, right in front of Harry’s face, and showed him the splinters of glass lodged in his flesh.</p><p>‘But then again,’ he continued, softly. ‘That would mean you’d miss all the fun, wouldn’t you?’</p><p>His skin rippled smoothly, pushing out the broken shards and healing over again in an instant. It was dark, powerful magic, performed effortlessly, like a party trick. It would have made Harry shiver, if only he were capable of doing so.</p><p>‘So I think it’s best if you’re like this,’ Voldemort concluded. ‘Able to see, here and feel everything, but unable to stop it. Utterly helpless.’ He lowered his voice. ‘Just like when you were a baby.’</p><p>He touched Harry’s face again, quite deliberately, tracing the curve of his cheek in a slow caress. Underneath his fingertips Harry’s skin seared with pain, as if he was being burned by a hot iron.</p><p>‘Do you think he’s pretty?’ Voldemort asked suddenly, his voice high and clear. ’He’s very small and soft, really. Still such a podgy pale little boy.’</p><p>There was a murmuring amongst the death-eaters. Harry couldn’t tell whether they were agreeing or disagreeing or just laughing along at the joke. Their voices were too low and deep and their faces were obscured by their masks.</p><p>Voldemort was smiling wide though, clearly enjoying himself. His fingers moved to Harry’s collar, dipping beneath his robes. His nails scraped against the boy’s skin, underlining the burning pain with a fresh sting.</p><p>‘Let’s get a closer look at him,’ he suggested, before ripping open his robes.</p><p>He mostly used magic to undress Harry, apparently tiring of tearing the fabric as soon as he began. With one lazy flick of his wand he was able to peel away all the layers of clothes in an instant, leaving Harry cold and naked.</p><p>‘I wonder what Dumbledore would think if he saw you here like this?’ He mused, jabbing his wand again and rolling Harry onto his back. ‘His precious champion laid out like slaughtered pig!’</p><p>This elicited a clearer response from the gathering of death-eaters, who laughed loudly and spitefully.</p><p>‘He’s not got a lot of hair has he?’ Voldemort commented, rolling Harry back and forth across the dirt and examining his naked body with interest. ‘I thought he’d be darker than he is, but he’s all pale and patchy and there’s barely anything between his legs!’</p><p>‘He looks like a little girl!’ Someone yelled ecstatically, setting the crowd off again.</p><p>‘You should castrate him,’ Another voice suggested, this one deeper and rougher. ‘Cut off his little dick and balls and then send him back to Dumbledore with a stumpy, bleeding cunt!’</p><p>There was another round of laughter, this one and even louder and tinged with a palpable sense of excitement.</p><p>Voldemort did not laugh but he did grin very widely, showing off the pearly whites of his teeth.</p><p>‘That’s not a bad idea, McNair,’ he declared. ‘I wouldn’t have much to fear from a neutered little pup. I could slice him up nicely and send him back naked for everyone to see. That would certainly set the old man in a tizzy, wouldn’t it?’</p><p>He flicked his wand up and down in the air, tracing invisible lines across Harry’s body,</p><p>‘I daresay I could cut off his legs and arms too,’ he continued dreamily. ‘leave him nothing but a torso. Then he’d have to spend the rest of his days on his back, being fed and cleaned by the nurses in St Munro’s. I doubt he’d feel like much of a hero then.’</p><p>He stepped over Harry’s prone body and peered down into his face.</p><p>‘Would you like that, Harry?’ He whispered. ‘Would you like it if I spared your life like that? It really is a very generous offer.’</p><p>Harry was crying silently now. He still couldn’t move or speak but he pleaded with Voldemort with his eyes. If he could have begged out-loud he would have done so. He was too frightened and ashamed to fight.</p><p>Voldemort regraded him thoughtfully, taking in the tears in his eyes and the sweat on his brow.</p><p>‘I don’t think he would like that,’ he said silkily. ‘I think he would rather keep his limp little dick, if he had the chance.’</p><p>There was another rumble of amusement from Voldemort’s audience.</p><p>‘Why?’ Someone asked shrilly. ‘He doesn’t even know what to do with it yet!’</p><p>They all laughed cruelly. A gathering of large, grown men jeering at a feeble little boy, naked on the ground.</p><p>Voldemort frowned a little and touched a hand to Harry’s thighs. The skin stung under his touch, even worse than anywhere else had done, although Harry didn’t know why.</p><p>That was, of course, until Voldemort looked up again with a satisfied smile on his lips.</p><p>‘He’s pissed himself,’ he declared to the onlookers, who all shrieked in response.</p><p>Harry felt his stomach lurch. He hadn’t felt it happen but he knew that Voldemort was telling the truth. His thighs were damp with urine and the ground wet beneath him.</p><p>‘Poor little boy,’ Voldemort crooned, moving his hand up to Harry’s head and combing his fingers through his hair in an imitation of tenderness. ‘We must have really scared him.’</p><p>He paused for a moment, the dark slits of his eyes fixed on Harry’s face.</p><p>‘You know,’ he said thoughtfully. ‘I really do think he is petty, after all. When he’s all weak and helpless anyway. He’s so small and delicate, just like a little doll.’</p><p>He raised his wand again and guided Harry back onto his knees.</p><p>‘Perhaps I will be merciful,’ he mused, ‘for a little while longer. You’ll learn to serve me before you die, Harry. Worship me, even. That’s the greatest gift I can give you.’</p><p>Harry didn’t understand what he meant by this. Even as the man prised open his jaw and slid his fingers inside. It was only when Voldemort started to peel open his robes and expose himself that his intentions became clear.</p><p>Harry still couldn’t fight or struggle. All he could do was kneel there and wait to be used. He wished with all his heart that he could at least close his eyes. He would have given anything not to see what was coming.</p><p>It hurt, just like any other time that Voldemort had touched him, making his mouth burn and blister. It made him choke too, his throat convulsing automatically and his nostrils flaring wide.</p><p>‘Now, now,’ Voldemort murmured, his voice still alarmingly calm. ‘You can do better than that.’</p><p>He pushed Harry’s head back, making the little bones in his neck crack, and cast another spell on him, making his lips and throat all soft and rubbery. After that, there was no more choking or gagging, just the blistering pain and humiliation.</p><p>The death-eaters weren’t laughing or jeering anymore. They had fallen silent and were watching the proceedings grimly, as if it was sort of a play put on for their benefit.</p><p>If they were enjoying what they were seeing they kept their excitement to themselves. Perhaps they thought that any overt displays of appreciation might be met with disapproval. It was impossible to know what Voldemort wanted in this moment and it was dangerous to upset him.</p><p>When it was over, Harry somehow managed to be sick, vomit soaring up from his stomach and dribbling out of his unprotesting lips. In response, Voldemort reached down and slapped him across the face.</p><p>‘You dirty little wretch,’ he hissed, with a genuine disgust that shocked and perplexed Harry. ‘I ought to wash your mouth out with soap.’</p><p>He clearly had other things on his mind though and didn’t use so much as a scouring spell on Harry.</p><p>After a moment’s consideration, he lifted up Harry’s naked body with a levitating spell and draped him over the top of a large tombstone, so that his arms and legs dangled out over either side.</p><p>‘We’re not done yet, Harry,’ he explained calmly. ‘You’ll know when we’re done. When I’m done with you.’</p><p>This time, Harry understood exactly what was coming and felt dread and hopelessness overwhelm him. He couldn’t cringe away, couldn’t even flinch as the man pushed inside him. He wished that he could at least scream, but all that came out of his mouth was a winded little gasp.</p><p>Each thrust was agony, a natural pain coupled with a supernatural one, stretching accompanied by burning. Harry was sure that he was being torn right open, that his body was being broken beyond repair and that he would never be the same again.</p><p>‘Does it hurt?’ Voldemort murmured. ‘Is it too much for you?’ My poor, little lamb.’</p><p>He snaked one hand around Harry’s waist and grasped at his limp penis.</p><p>‘Don’t worry,’ he murmured, ‘I’ll make it feel better.’</p><p>He squeezed hard and sent a sudden pulse of magic straight into him. Harry felt it surge deep into his pelvis, rolling through him like a warm electric current, the sensation so intense that he almost didn’t recognise it. Then he felt the familiar tug and quiver, the heady ache and hunger for more.</p><p>‘That feels good doesn’t it?’ Voldemort crooned. ‘You’re getting nice and hard for me now. You’d like some more wouldn’t you?’</p><p>He sent another bolt of magic into Harry’s body and then another and another, timing each hit to the rhythm of his thrusts. The pain seemed to fade away against the overwhelming tide of pleasure and Harry quickly found himself teetering on the edge of a climax, longing for relief.</p><p>‘You’re enjoying this now,’ Voldemort taunted. ‘You’re enjoying me fucking you.’</p><p>He tilted his head closer, pressing his mouth right up against Harry’s ear.</p><p>‘I’m going to fuck you to death, Harry,’ he panted wetly. ‘The last thing you’ll ever feel is me, inside you, making you come.’</p><p>His wand was at his throat, digging into his skin, and yet somehow Harry still managed to climax, along with his tormenter.</p><p>Voldemort did not cast the killing curse, as he had promised, but instead withdrew to clean himself up and straighten his robes.</p><p>He ignored Harry for quite some time, leaving him draped over the tombstone, before finally coming back and kicking him down to ground.</p><p>‘I’m going to give you one more chance to speak before you die,’ he told him. ‘If you’re wise, you’ll admit that I am the rightful master of this world and beg for a quick, painless death.’</p><p>And he lifted the paralysing spell from Harry, so suddenly that Harry hardly realised what was happening.</p><p>The first thing Harry did once he realised that he had possession of his body, was to try and cover himself up with his hands, even though it was far too late for that.</p><p>‘Would you like your robes back?’ Voldemort asked lazily. ‘I could give them to you, if you want?’</p><p>Harry nodded weakly. ‘Please,’ he croaked. ‘Please.’</p><p>That was all Voldemort needed. He smiled indulgently and waved his wand and Harry found himself dressed in his red and gold robes again.</p><p>‘There you are,’ Voldemort said pleasantly. ‘Now, I would like you to bow before me again, this time of your own free will.’</p><p>Harry understood the role he needed to play now. He moved slowly to his knees and bowed his head down.</p><p>‘Please,’ he said again. ‘Please just kill me. I just want it to be over.’</p><p>He meant it too, and Voldemort could tell, in the way he could always tell whether someone was lying or telling the truth. He smiled serenely, raising his wand up high, and Harry prepared himself for death.</p><p>But then he saw something, just behind Voldemort, a glitter of gold - the Triwizard cup - <em>just there</em>, less than three feet away. Close enough to run to, perhaps, if he could just find the strength. If he could just make one last effort.</p><p>‘Avada - ‘</p>
