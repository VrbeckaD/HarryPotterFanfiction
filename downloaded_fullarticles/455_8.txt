    <p>Hadrian was Draco’s heaven outside of the wizarding world. Though, he was definitely a wizard (and god he hoped he was maybe a half-blood because then he would have half a chance at convincing his father that this was okay). He was still Draco’s.</p><p>Not Malfoy’s. Not the prince of Slytherin. Just Draco.</p><p>The long-haired brunet was smiling up at him with those sweet green eyes that would flash the most brilliant gold as he tumbled deeper into his thoughts. But, he didn’t grab for Draco’s full attention, he only relaxed under the blonde’s arm, smiling into the other’s chest and relaxing.</p><p>Draco had never expected this when they’d met.</p><p>
  <em>It’d been the summer after his first year when he’d visited the small town. The streets were worn down, but people smiled and laughed. Small town indeed. His pale skin and white-blonde hair stuck out like a sore thumb against the varying skin tones and dark hair of the residents. All seemed to share a culture and a heritage in the town. Draco wondered if this was like the famed ‘China Town’ in the Americas.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Then he’d been splayed on the ground with a grinning maniac on top of him. Rich dark brown hair fell like a curtain around him. A lithe body softly crushed him into the sidewalk as the boy on top of him laughed. Green eyes shining bright.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Sorry! Sorry!” The boy pulled himself up and held out a hand. “I’m Hadrian, what’s your name.” </em>
</p><p>He tugged on Hadrian’s ponytail softly, lips pressed to his beloved’s crown. Who knew he would find his Veela mate so early in life and fall so deeply in love with him before even the bond kicked in. Draco’s fingers twitched, it was nearing the end of summer and he hadn’t even gotten to introduce his parents to Hadrian.</p><p>Or the thing… Draco thought back to the ring safely hidden in his bag.</p><p>His waiting game will continue.</p><p>“This school year is going to be hell. That insufferable headmaster is still in charge even though he’s been bedridden. I want to stay here.” Hadrian nuzzled into his arms, making Draco sigh. The warm sun was kissing his skin comfortably as they sat on the beach’s bench.</p><p>“I think I graduated last year seeing as the old coot never showed up to get me for school. Which means I can finally work full time and get the house ready. Actually build up savings for us. No, using your parent’s money is not going to be included in my mind. I need to meet them by the way. We’ve been dating for five years and mates for a year, when will I not be your side hoe?” Draco chuckled into his love’s hair, letting him ramble on and on in the sweet sunlight.</p><p>Summer wasn’t over just yet.</p><p>---</p><p> Draco wishes the summer had stayed forever. His body ached from running, his mother and father were on either side of him. Their lord and his Uncle Severus were running close behind, shouting defensive spells and shields until they were able to get out of the Hogwarts wards to apparate with a loud crack.</p><p> The blonde fell to the ground, panting as the adults followed him. They all crowded into a small dark alley. Uncle Severus was bleeding from a small cut on his forehead, but overall, they were safe. For now.</p><p> “Malfoy Manor is out of bounds. The Prince Manor will probably be under close watch, and our other properties have been sold or destroyed.” His lord sighed softly. “I can’t think of anywhere that would be inconspicuous. An inn could turn us out, anyone have a house, not on the records?”</p><p> The blonde paused, green eyes flashing in his mind. It was April, Hadrian wouldn’t be expecting it, but he also had the landline if he wasn’t at the café. He had a home, technically, it was Hadrian’s home. He’d always said that Draco was always welcome. The key in his pocket felt heavier than lead. His uncle saw his hesitation.</p><p>“Draco? Something to share with the class?” All the adults looked at him. He took a breath.</p><p>“Promise not to tell or make fun of me? Also, I apologize in advance Mom, I was really hoping to introduce you in much better circumstances.” The dark lord looked quizzingly at him as did his mother as he pulled out a small black flip phone from his bag and dialed the first contact. Ignoring the way his father stared at the odd muggle object in his son’s hand. He picked up on the third ring.</p><p>“Draco! I thought you had school?” Draco’s face uncontrollably split into a wide smile. A feral part of his mind purred, <em>mine, mine, mine, my mate, my strength</em>. But he cleared his throat in an attempt to save face and not look like a love-sick fool.</p><p>“Baby, are you home? Something’s up and I promise I’ll explain once I get there and we’re safe, but I really need to take some, associates, of mine to a place we can lay low and not worry about getting blown up.” Draco could feel Hadrian sober up with little to no words, though he kept his upbeat tone.</p><p>“It’s our home Draco, you don’t need permission to bring guests over. Though, I am making dinner, so a headcount might be nice? I hope we have enough chairs…” Draco didn’t even try to stop himself from smiling like a loon. Our home. If he weren’t afraid of getting murdered by the Order the pure domesticity he was feeling might tear him apart. His Uncle Severus looked at him curiously and sharply as he hung up the phone.</p><p>“Come on. Let’s move quickly, the address is 320 St. Dineral Ave.” Immediately, Draco stepped back and let his mother hold his shoulder and apparate them to the spot just outside the property. The street was dark in the night, but the soft glow of fireflies and the occasional street light made Draco smile again as he hopped up the porch with no hesitation. Keys clinking as he hurriedly opened the door and let his family and the dark lord inside.</p><p>Hadrian hadn’t been kidding when he said he was going to use the end of school to spruce up the place.</p><p>Photographs of all their friends and the five years (summers and one holiday technically) they’d spent together. Hadrian’s paintings hung on the wall, with little knick-knacks they’d collects strewn on shelves. The blanket Draco had given Hadrian for Christmas when they were thirteen laid on the living room couch.</p><p>Draco remembered that one Christmas they’d shared. Their first one as mates.</p><p>
  <em>“Hadrian! Hadrian! Open the door!” He felt like a man possessed. Pounding on the door in the dead of night. But he had to come here. The need was like torture, burning in his veins. He’d been suffering from their separation the moment he’d woken up on his sixteenth birthday. Summer had been too far away. That’s why Draco was here, cloak over his pajamas on Christmas Eve, waiting on his mate’s doorstep.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Mate.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Mate.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Mine.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Draco! What are you doing out there? It’s freezing out, get inside!” Draco had frozen the moment Hadrian stepped into his view. Gorgeously tanned skin and the brightest green eyes that crinkled in that special way when he smiled. The way he threw his head back and laughed, loud and with his full body. His small and strong arms, supple thighs, smart lips. Draco surged forward, grabbing Hadrian’s hips and crowding him into the house. Slamming the door shut with his foot and shoving his mate, his, his, his, his, against the wall. Feverishly slotting their mouths together.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>God, it had never felt this good.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>It had always been good, warm with a spark. Like a comfort that kept you stable, a warm cup of tea at the end of a long night.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>This was coming home.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“You’re my mate. My Veela mate, I mean-“ Hadrian just giggled and kissed him against to stop the rambling before it began.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“I know. I’ve always known you were the one I was meant to be with. I just had to wait for you to get your head out of your ass like usual.” Hadrian giggled again, and Draco just melted, awestruck before he grinned feral and wild as his teeth attacked at Hadrian’s exposed throat.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Well, if I’ve gotten my head out of my ass…” Draco dug his teeth in, shuddering at the loud moan that was his reply. Like a man moved, he dropped to his knees, grabbing the waistband of Hadrian’s sweatpants with his teeth, still grinning. “Mind if it gets into yours?” </em>
</p><p>
  <em>The shrieking laugh and consequent moans were the symphony of the night. They were going to be burned into Draco’s mind forever like a favorite CD as he remembered the night he proved his devotion. Over, and over, and over again.</em>
</p><p>Still, nothing, even sweet memories could compare to the soft humming that was coming from the kitchen. Voldemort looked wary, hand at his wand with Severus also at the ready. Nagini curled around both her masters’ feet. Draco stepped forward, letting his school bag drop to the floor noisily.</p><p>“I’m home.” The humming stopped,<em> unfortunately</em>, but Hadrian walked in from the kitchen and any soft disappointment faded away. Hadrian’s long dark hair was held up in his signature high ponytail, bangs and fringe gently curling around those wide cheeks. A short apron tightened his waist to an impossible angle and hid a good portion of his sinfully tight light blue jeans and his maroon V-neck.</p><p>Immediately those pink lips split into a grin and Hadrian was pressed into his side. Draco’s face burrowed into the crown of the smaller’s head. Squeezing him tight until he let go. An arm still wound around his beloved’s shoulders as Hadrian’s nimble fingers gently traced the small of his back, unseen to their guests. Draco could feel the blush on his cheeks as he introduced them.</p><p>“Mother, Father, Uncle Sev, My Lord. This is Hadrian, my boyfriend.” Understandably, seeing as none of them had known he was gay or taken, his father and the dark lord were shocked and still. His Uncle Sev was more reserved, but curiosity was in his dark eyes as he appraised Hadrian with careful eyes. His mother had no such hesitation. Reaching out immediately with a hand.</p><p>“It’s a pleasure to meet you Hadrian.” The crooked grin looked so innocent in that moment that Draco almost laughed hysterically as Hadrian grabbed her hand with both of his.</p><p>“I’ve heard so much about you Lady Malfoy that I feel like I already know you. Please, all of you, come in and make yourselves comfortable. I’ll make some tea and we can chat while I finish dinner. I’m sure a warm meal and a safe roof is a priceless thing.” His green eyes sparkled when Hadrian leaned back towards him. Going on his tiptoes to give Draco a kiss and a pat on the chest.</p><p>“Be a dear and take their coats.” Draco smirked.</p><p>“Or what?” Hadrian smirked back.</p><p>“Or you won’t touch this ass for a month.” For emphasis, Hadrian slapped his own ass and swayed his hips enticingly as the brunet sauntered to the kitchen. Draco gaped quietly before reaching out both his arms.</p><p>“Dining tables in the kitchen, gimme your coats.” His father almost abolished him for his rude abruptness, until their lord laughed. Long and deep, it rumbled in the air.</p><p>“Lucius, be kind on the boy. That reminds me so much of my eighth year at Hogwarts, the way I would drool after my husband. Though he was more subtle with his teasing. Young love in times like these is… refreshing.” A few moments and they were all seated at their dining room table. A warm Cherrywood table that Draco knew Hadrian had seen him ogling when the brunet had jokingly dragged him to an ‘Ikea’.</p><p>It felt like an eternity, but it was really only a few minutes when Draco saw his love turn from the stove. Six mismatched mugs balanced on a tray with a small jug of milk and mason jar of sugar. Draco didn’t even blink when Hadrian plopped his favorite mug onto his placemat, tea already a dark milky color, evidently, Hadrian had made his tea for him. He took a sip and was a little surprised.</p><p>“You made English tea?”</p><p>“I figured your guests might prefer it, seeing as the first time I made you tea from my home you sputtered like a nun at a strip club.” Draco was surprised to see him mother muffle a laugh at the raunchy joke, but the amusement was quick to fade. Uncle Severus was the first to speak.</p><p>“What’s your home then, if not Britain?” Hadrian gave a radiant smile.</p><p>“I’m from Britain and I’m probably English by blood. But my home culture is from a small desert island named Dicai. Blistering sun and spice is our life, though I grew up here and only have been to the homeland a few times, my mentor made sure I was taught all our traditions and immersed in the culture from the second she took me in.” Hadrian paused. “You don’t have to hide your wands or magic by the way. I know and I am.”</p><p>With a blink of Draco’s eye, Hadrian had whipped out his wand. A rather plain, but efficient weapon as with a flick of his wrist and a murmur all the candles in the house flickered to life. An impressive show of magic, Draco had half a mind to swoon. Especially as the tension seemed to relax and dissipate almost immediately once Hadrian’s wand rested innocently on the table. His mother smiled brightly.</p><p>“How long have you and my son been together?” Hadrian peeked at him, a hand squeezing his knee under the table.</p><p>“Are we counting when I thought we were courting or when you got your head out of your ass?”</p><p>“Me, so it was August first.”</p><p>“Yes, after my twelfth birthday. Amazing we’re seventeen now love. So, over five years?” Draco smiled indulgently.</p><p>“Five years.” His mother looked nearly affronted.</p><p>“Five years and I hadn’t heard a word about this?” Draco looked for help but found all three men sipped their tea and avoiding eye contact. Even Hadrian wasn’t paying real attention, instead looking intently at the snake that had slithered just beneath his crossed legs. Hadrian was obsessed with snakes and a Parseltongue, so Draco really wasn’t all surprised.</p><p>“I thought… I didn’t know what was going to happen and I only had precious few months with him in the summer. Things kept getting in the way after fourth year, but I promise I had a plan to tell you once we turned sixteen and I found out…” Draco trailed off thoughtfully, looking at Hadrian with pure awe and reverence when his love pet the dangerous snake with absolutely no fear. His mother eyed him curiously before his unspoken words hit her and she gasped.</p><p>“You are? You are! Oh, my baby!” She cooed, misty eyes as she slapped her husband’s chest excitedly. “Lucius, Lucius! They’re mates! I knew my Veela heritage would bless my son like it did my grandmother.”</p><p>Even his father looked up with surprise before a pleased smile stretched across his face. His Lord and his Uncle stayed quiet as Lucius leaned over to shake Hadrian’s hand. Who looked absolutely delighted at the gesture. Shaking the older’s hand happily.</p><p>“Welcome to the family, Hadrian. I’m glad my son found his one so easily.” Draco swept Hadrian’s long hair off his shoulder absentmindedly when Hadrian sat back down. Which Nagini seemed to take as an invitation to slither up onto Hadrian’s shoulders. His Lord stiffened, hissing.</p><p><em>“Nagini, no, that’s Draco’s mate. He’s to be protected not eaten.” </em>The snake huffed and stayed put, tongue flicking affectionately against Hadrian’s cheek.</p><p><em>“I’m not eating him.” </em>Hadrian giggled and nearly startled the whole table as he hissed back.</p><p><em>“You’re so adorable! And you feel so smooth, I always wanted a snake, but with school and the fact my mentor was terrified of snakes I never got one. I adore you, feel free to hang out with me anytime.” </em>Draco laughed, though he had no clue what his love was saying. His lord was immediately sitting up and leaning in excitedly.</p><p>“<em>A speaker? I thought I was the only one…” </em>Hadrian’s laugh was a guttural hiss.</p><p>“<em>It’s not unusual in my culture, rare, but not unusual. I’m not blood Dician, but I didn’t think about it either. I just assumed there would be other British Parseltongues.” </em>Tom gave a smile and leaned into Severus, Draco pressed a kiss onto Hadrian’s temple as the oven dinged.</p><p>“The hot dish!” Hadrian immediately was out of his seat, uncaring of the human-sized snake curling across his waist and shoulders like a sash. Draco sighed dreamily as the adults eyed the boy warily in the kitchen.</p><p>“He’s also a Metamorphagus to give you a heads up.” The Lord sighed, a hand on his forehead as he leaned against his Uncle Severus’ frame. A smile was on his lips though, betraying the exasperation he tried to put forward.</p><p>“Couldn’t your godson ever do things by halves? He couldn’t just have a wizard as his mate, he needed a Metamorphagus Parseltongue. Had to go big or go home.” His Lord looked younger without Dumbledore’s forced grotesque glamour on him. Soft and spiked brown hair and warm tanned skin, the only thing unnatural about him was the blood-red eyes. He mocked disapproval, but there was a bemused tilt to his lips. Sipping tea and sitting down at the kitchen table so calmly. Draco almost could pretend there wasn’t a war. That this was just his family meeting his partner.</p><p>If Hadrian had shorter, lighter hair, the lord and he might look similar Draco mused. But that’s assumed Hadrian would ever wear his hair short voluntarily. Draco had asked once if Hadrian would even morph his hair to be shorter than his shoulders; but the venomous reply that he was forced into one gender and one short hair-cut for nine months at school was enough even if he didn’t remember anything of school once he came home.</p><p>Soon the brunet was moving back into the room, grinning past the snake vying for his attention as he placed down the big dish in the center of the table. Draco almost drooled, but stuck to look at Hadrian with utter admiration.</p><p>“You didn’t.”</p><p>“I wasn’t going to, I was going to make myself, what did you call it? Melt your dick off chicken, but I went for a safer option again. Tatertot hot dish is more of an American dish… but most people like it just fine.” Severus leaned forward a little bit.</p><p>“I’ve heard you’re a Metamorphagus, is that your effortless or just your preferred appearance?” The words tumbled out of his mouth before he thought of just how rude he was being. He was relieved as instead of being offended by the blunt question the younger man smiled softly, eyes glancing at Draco.</p><p>“Bodies are fluid, so I tweak myself depending on my mood. Kinda like when I’m working out and I get rid of the dick to be more comfortable. As for me now… sort of effortless, my scars are ugly so I smooth them over. But everything else is <em>au natural</em>, unless you want to see me differently?” The very air around him blurred as his dark hair lightened to a smoother honey brown, eyes turning blood red and looking to his lord with a smug smile. His hair was pin straight but still swept down to just above the small of his back.</p><p>The table startled again, Draco included this time. His love had looked like his lord already and now he was basically the man’s (slightly more handsome) clone. His lord, though shocked, looked very amused. Raising a hand and pointing to his partner.</p><p>“Do him next please. I’d pay a handsome sum to see Severus in his younger years again.”</p><p>The air rippled softly again and Hadrian’s dark hair pulled up to just below his shoulder, going just a bit darker than his natural hair color and falling in soft and thin waves. His eyes melted into the dark onyx of his Uncle’s and the smirk Hadrian tilted onto his lips was dead on. Tom nearly roared with laughter as Severus sputtered beside him. Even his mother was laughing and clapping delightedly.</p><p>“Severus! You could have been so adorable! Look at those cheeks! I keep telling you two, once the wars over you should have a child. Mix your devastating good looks and you’d have a drop dead gorgeous son or daughter.” Lucius smiled at his wife’s teasing, but the adults quickly went quiet as both of the men in question stopped smiling. Only Severus managed a softening in his gaze.</p><p>“The war is more important right now. Thank you for your shelter, Hadrian. As well as the meal, it’s delicious.” Hadrian smiled gently, his frame flickering as it went back to honey tan skin and dark brown hair. Working around the snake on his shoulders, Hadrian green eyes didn’t even glance at his hands as he quickly pulled out his ponytail and put it into a messy bun.</p><p>“Think nothing of it. I’ll get your rooms ready. Draco, let’s leave them to relax for a moment. You’re going to be helping me.” Draco went to protest, but Hadrian only had to glance at him with a single brow raised before Draco was standing up. Abandoning his plate.</p><p>“I wanna finish eating after we’re done.”</p><p>“Naturally. Desert will be done soon too. If you’re lucky, I let you keep the extras.”</p><p>Narcissa whistled low and smiled. “He’s as pussy whipped as you were when you and I started courting.” Lucius smiled weakly. Until his Lord also smiled, the look was distant and far away.</p><p>“I had a dream that we had a son once. He had Severus’ hair, and my eyes, the color before I was devoted to the dark arts. I don’t remember his name, but it had felt so real. I could vividly see him playing with Nagini on the floor with a stuffed dragon that had a handkerchief. I almost thought it was real when I’d woken. I think…. If we ever did have a son. I think he’d look a bit like young Hadrian does.” Severus squeezed his bicep, ignoring the twinge that screamed in the back of his head.</p><p>He’d had that exact dream. The dark hair, the wide dark blue eyes. He even knew exactly what stuffed dragon his husband was talking about. It’d been a red dragon because that was the mascot of his mother’s muggle university. He’d had the plushie for years. Severus knew it was in the Prince vault, as it had for many years, but Tom had never seen it to Severus’ memory. He’d wanted to save it, for a child, for a son.</p><p>His mind ticked at him again, his Occlumency shields scratching at each other.</p><p>Severus ignored it.</p><p>Hadrian’s went up the stairs with Draco hot on his heels, meeting the blonde’s parents and Uncles(?) had been nice. Even if it was a little tense and worried. He was glad that he finally got to meet them, seeing as Draco had already met his mentor a few times now. Hadrian grabbed his lover and shoved him into one of the guestrooms, Draco gaped at the fully clean and furnished room.</p><p>“What did you need me for? The rooms perfect!” Hadrian rolled his eyes and shoved Draco to sit on the end on the bed. Plopping down onto Draco’s lap so he couldn’t escape.</p><p>“Of course it is, I have magic too you know. We’re letting the adults work over whatever issue they bumped into, and besides. You promised me an explanation. Not that I’m not delighted to house your relatives, you know I love guests and hosting. Even if my ‘other’ needs fall to the wayside.” Hadrian’s nails dragged down his boyfriend’s chest, he grinned at the shudder his actions elicited. “So. Talk.”</p><p>Draco swallowed heavily, hands finding the brunet’s waist, careful about the snake still wound tightly around his lover’s body. He looked powerful and regal, his smile both made Draco’s heart race and his legs melt to useless jelly. Nagini hissed.</p><p>
  <em>“Please don’t tell me you’re going to sleep with your human while I’m here.”</em>
</p><p><em> “I won’t, but feel free to go back downstairs whenever. I’ll charm a heated blanket wherever you’d like to sleep tonight either way.” </em>Nagini hissed again, pleased, and slithered away back into the kitchen. Draco groaned softly.</p><p>“I didn’t know Parseltongue was a kink.” Hadrian smiled sunnily at him.</p><p> “Now you know how I feel when you whisper in French to me bastard.” Draco laughed before giving a soft sigh.</p><p> “I’ll stick to the basics because you’re more familiar with Dicai Wizarding Traditions, but in the British World. Which, do you remember any of that from school?” Hadrian sighed.</p><p> “I remember the basic governing style. Some goblin wars from history class. Honestly, I barely remember the classes, most of what British wizarding skills I know I taught myself from my school books. I only remember the creepy headmaster really. It’s like from the moment he picks me up to the moment he drops me off is a giant blur.” Draco frowned.</p><p> “Have Uncle Sev try Legilimency on you sometime. The fact you blackout entire school years isn’t normal. Anyway, there’s a war going on. Between Dark and Light, and everyone thinks the Light side is all sunshine, roses, and goodness. But, the dark side is being painted in a demonized light. Tom, our lord, was dragged into this war by the leader of the light side who manipulated him and then tried to kill him after killing a few very well-known wizards under Tom’s name. Now our lord was forced back into the light, people know he still lives and the war has been started all over again and we’re going to die unless we can clear the names of dark witches and wizards before they kill us all.” Hadrian frowned in thought, eyebrows scrunched up.</p><p>“That’s… awful. That’s like Urbosa wanting me dead when I was declared to have a dark affinity. Magic is of the soul and the body, morals of evil and good are of the heart and mind. They have no link besides how you use them together. The most evil king in our history was a light sorcerer, our greatest had no magic at all. Why would he want you dead?”</p><p> “It started with a disagreement about revealing ourselves to the muggle world and it escalated.” Hadrian scrunched his nose.</p><p> “That’s dumb. Of course, staying hidden is better. My aunt and uncle knew what I was growing up until I got away from them. It was awful… there are good people. But terrible things happen when the wrong people know…” Draco rubbed his hands along Hadrian’s sides, he’d never seen the scars. Hadrian always stayed out of his effortless as much as possible, but that didn’t mean Draco couldn’t infer his life before he’d been taken in by his boss and given a home to reside in. His mentor hadn’t been a parent in the strictest sense. Hadrian didn’t need a parent after the trauma he’d survived. But she had given Hadrian a roof, traded work for a living wage and food on the table, gave Hadrian a culture and heritage to call home.</p><p>“C’mon, let’s’ go back down. You promised desert.” Hadrian laughed and they went downstairs and host their guests. Draco was pleased with their desert and for a small while, the war didn’t weigh so heavily on the families.</p>
