    <p>Crowley wasn’t born a snake.</p><p>If we’re being factual about it, he wasn’t born at all. But either way, Crowley began his existence as purely angel. <a href="#footnoteone" rel="nofollow">(1)</a> <a name="returnone" rel="nofollow" id="returnone"></a>After the Fall, the nature of each angel folded and twisted into its new demon shape in its own unique way, like clean pieces of paper folded into grotesque demon-origami. Crowley may never have settled permanently in his “serpent” aspect if not for the events of cosmic import which he influenced while in that shape.</p><p>After that, well. The serpent folded into him, lines deep in the paper of his being which never quite smoothed away, no matter how he unfolded and refolded himself.</p><p>Crowley didn’t mind, exactly. He rather liked snakes. Excellent conversationalists, that lot. It’s why he took the shape in the first place. Crowley was nothing if not inquisitive.</p><p>He had not expected scintillating conversation on the day he slithered into a little suburb in Surrey. He simply sought a brief respite from nannying the Antichrist—a project that, for all its importance, chafed after a while. Crowley was used to wandering the world freely, tying himself in place as he chose and cutting loose as it suited him.</p><p>A little pick-me-up, was what he needed. Leave Aziraphale to Antichrist duty for the afternoon. Visit a neighborhood, sniff out discord—suburbs were <em>rife</em> with discord, bubbling <em>just</em> underneath their bland facades—and encourage it to blossom into temptation or corruption. Or, failing such juicy finds, cause a good bit of mayhem. A place like this could use a good bit of mayhem, in Crowley’s opinion. Even considering the shadow of the looming apocalypse. <a href="#footnotetwo" rel="nofollow">(2)</a> <a name="returntwo" rel="nofollow" id="returntwo"></a></p><p>What Crowley had <em>definitely</em> not expected was to taste a peculiar scent in the air. In all his millennia of scenting scents, with a snake tongue and a human nose and a whole variety of olfactory systems in between, he had never scented a scent quite like it.</p><p>If there was one thing that Crowley couldn’t stand, it was a mystery. He had built his reputation on wiliness. On knowing things that others didn’t know, or convincingly acting as though he did. It just wouldn’t do to be confounded by a… suburban smelly-smell.</p><p>Following the smelly-smell led Crowley to the backyard of a house no different from the other houses on the row. In the backyard, a human hatchling… er, boy. Eh, sod it. A hatchling, spade in hand, dug ferociously at the dirt in front of a row of manicured shrubs as though the dirt offended him.</p><p>Keeping to the shady grass near the fence, Crowley snaked closer. He tasted the air. Yup, definitely the source of the smell. It was like… like a thunderstorm, but trapped, compressed into too small a space and all the more potent for being so concentrated.</p><p>From the house, the patio door slammed open. Crowley froze in sync with the human-hatchling-who-smelled-like-a-thunderstorm.</p><p>“<em>Still</em> turning the earth, are you, boy?”</p><p>The woman who spoke from the doorway was related to the human-hatchling-who-smelled-like-a-thunderstorm—no, too long of a name for such a bitty thing. The stormling. Crowley could sense the kin connection between the stormling and the woman. He could see the adult’s thin, lanky frame reflected in the smaller, still growing child’s. There was something similar about the eyes, too: hers blue and the stormling’s green, but united in their expressions of mutual dislike.</p><p>The stormling half-twisted to speak over his shoulder.</p><p>“The ground’s hard. It hasn’t rained—”</p><p>“Did I <em>ask</em> for excuses for your laziness?” the woman snapped.</p><p>Crowley frowned, inasmuch as a snake could frown. Well, that was hardly fair, was it? The stormling was <em>obviously</em> working hard. He was practically covered in sweat and dirt. And the ground <em>was</em> dry.</p><p>The stormling didn’t protest, though. He directed his gaze back to the ground.</p><p>“No, Aunt Petunia.”</p><p>From inside the house, another child’s voice called.</p><p>“Mummy! It’s <em>hot</em>! Where’s my <em>lemonade</em>?”</p><p>The woman’s sour face sweetened before Crowley's eyes as she called back, “Coming, Duddy-dearest!”</p><p>Before she retreated into the house, she called out, “Those seedlings had better be planted by suppertime, boy, or you’ll not get any!”</p><p>She slid the patio door shut behind her. The stormling looked longingly up at the kitchen window, where what was obviously the woman’s own hatchling sat at the table while his mother fixed up a pitcher of lemonade for him.</p><p>He looked back at the hard earth in front of the hedgerow. It wasn’t even half dug, and the sun was getting on in the afternoon sky. The stormling looked like he might cry.</p><p>Now, technically, Crowley had no business feeling sympathy for upset children. He had no business feeling sympathy of <em>any</em> sort, really, let alone toward <em>children</em>.</p><p>But, well… surely it was <em>his</em> turn for a minor kindness? Hadn’t Aziraphale performed a minor <em>un</em>-kindness last week when, after instructing Warlock in the importance of respecting Brother Slug, he snuck back into the garden after sundown to salt the little pests gunning for his begonias?</p><p>Had to keep the scales balanced, didn’t they? To keep either Upstairs or Downstairs from getting suspicious.</p><p>“Oh, bugger it,” Crowley said.</p><p>The stormling startled. At just that moment, the tiniest breeze stirred the leaves of the tree above them so that the sunlight caught Crowley’s deep green scales. The stormling’s eyes fixed on him. He frowned.</p><p>“You’re not supposed to swear,” he accused.</p><p>“Maybe <em>you’re</em> not,” Crowley retorted, amused. “<em>I</em> do as I please.”</p><p>After a moment’s consideration, the stormling nodded.</p><p>“Uncle Vernon says swears, sometimes. I think different people have different rules.”</p><p>It was at that moment that Crowley realized an important little detail; He had initially spoken in the language of snakes, not in English. (He <em>could</em> speak human languages, even in snake-form. Demonic prerogative.) The stormling had heard him speak snake, and responded in the same language.</p><p>Interesting. It had been a long time since Crowley had met a human gifted with Parseltongue.</p><p>Crowley slithered closer. He stopped about a body-length (his) of distance away from the stormling. The stormling was not at all afraid of him. In fact, his frustrated near-tears had dried, leaving his startlingly green eyes clear and curious. From his close distance, Crowley spotted a new detail to add to his catalogue of Interesting Things about this little human: a lightning-shaped cut, quietly radiating power like a recently switched-off incandescent lightbulb radiates heat, scarred into the center of his forehead.</p><p>The stormling continued, “Like how Dudley gets to stay inside and drink lemonade and play computer games, and I have to dig the garden.”</p><p>“That doesn’t seem fair,” Crowley said disapprovingly.</p><p>Shrugging, the stormling said, “Just how it is when you’re a cousin, I guess.”</p><p>Now at this point, Crowley can be forgiven for not recognizing the wrongness of this statement. Over his millennia on Earth, he had witnessed a vast array of kinship systems and systems of social hierarchy, many of which the modern observer would find bizarre or even cruel. Crowley also contended with the complicated hierarchies of demons on a daily basis—and before them, even worse, <em>angelic</em> hierarchies.</p><p>So, given his lack of context, Crowley replied only, “Still rubbish, though.”</p><p>He stretched his neck to bring himself closer to the stormling’s eye-level. With an emphatic nod, he added, “Right bollocks, it is.”</p><p>Instead of scolding him for his swear, the corners of the stormling’s mouth turned up in a sweet grin, and he giggled.</p><p>Then, from inside, a shriek: “HARRY!”</p><p>Crowley and the stormling—no, Harry. Crowley and Harry turned their heads in unison, freezing in place for the second time at the prospect of Aunt Petunia’s wrath.</p><p>But Aunt Petunia's blue eyes were not narrowed in anger: they were wide with fear.  She came barreling out of the house and down the lawn toward them. Grabbing Harry’s arm, she pulled him up and away from Crowley.</p><p>“Aunt Petunia—” Harry protested.</p><p>At the same time, Aunt Petunia shouted, “COME AWAY FROM THAT THING!”</p><p>“But he’s not dangerous, Aunt Petunia, he’s just a green snake—” <a href="#footnotethree" rel="nofollow">(3)</a> <a name="returnthree" rel="nofollow" id="returnthree"></a></p><p>Aunt Petunia, however, was not listening. She hauled Harry away by his arm, shouting, “DUDLEY, YOU STAY INSIDE OR SO HELP ME GOD I WILL SEND YOUR SEGA BACK TO JAPAN!”</p><p>Dudley stood in the open door, gawping at the scene. At his mother’s threat, he burst into tears and ran back inside.</p><p>“Noooo, Mum, not my Segaaaa!”</p><p>Harry got his feet under him and allowed himself to be hauled. He waved at Crowley in apology. Crowley responded with a serpentine shrug, sort of like a body roll, which Harry seemed to understand.</p><p>The patio door slammed shut.</p><p>Crowley tasted the air. The storm-smell had already begun to dissipate in Harry’s absence. He started slithering back along the fence, the way he’d come.</p><p>Such an interesting little human. He’d have to check back in with the boy in the future—if he and Aziraphale succeeded in ensuring that there <em>was</em> a future.</p><p>For now, though: glancing in through the kitchen window on the other corner of the house as he passed, Crowley saw the stormling alone in the kitchen, his aunt presumably calming her son now that she had ensured her nephew wasn’t about to be bitten by a snake. Harry was sat at the kitchen island, staring at a glass of lemonade in front of him with a stunned expression.</p><p>Crowley crawled up the fence until he drew level with the window. He waved his head back and forth to catch Harry’s attention. When Harry looked up, Crowley winked.</p><p>Harry glanced around himself first, presumably making sure that he was alone. Then, he winked back.</p><p>Crowley stayed to watch him pick up his glass of lemonade before continuing over the fence and into the yard next door.</p><p>While Crowley was pleased with himself, rescuing a child from the hot sun and earning him a cool lemonade might’ve been <em>too</em> much on the angelic side of things. Did frightening Aunt Petunia rebalance the scale?</p><p>Ah, well. He still had time before he was expected back. Even if he took the long way—i.e., slithering—he could still make some trouble along the way if he hurried.</p><p>As he slithered through the yard of 5 Privet Drive, he let his body lengthen and his scales darken to black.</p>
