    <p>Colonnello’s chin was resting on the table, his eyes on the two tickets in his hands. He sighed mournfully, the sound being the only thing that was heard in the house.</p><p>After the Curse had broken, he had hoped to rekindle his romance with Lal Mirch immediately. However, those hopes had been quickly dashed. Lal had wanted to take some time apart. She had explained that she needed the break. She needed time alone, time to sort out her feelings. More importantly, she needed to be away from the reminders of the painful time stuck as children, to finally make her peace with it.</p><p>Understandably, Colonnello was one such reminder. </p><p>Still. Although he understood, it still hurt. After so many years spent waiting for a chance to be together again, he had hoped…</p><p>Another mournful sigh escaped him. Once Lal had rejected him, giving him her decision to take a break, the blond hadn’t known what to do, where to go. Mafia Land was a big <em> No </em> since it would only be full of memories and trouble that he didn’t want to deal with. The CEDEF was obviously a no as well.</p><p>Eventually, he had settled for going back to the old Arcobaleno house, knowing it would probably be empty and that he could spend his time alone, pining. The first few days alone had been nice, quiet, but now- now he found himself kind of lonely.</p><p>A fact that the two tickets in his hands seemed to cruelly remind to him, each time he gazed at them.</p><p>“Yo!” Someone suddenly shouted from outside the house, and Colonnello startled. “Anyone here?”</p><p>The blond raised his head, surprised to hear Skull’s voice. The sound of the front door being kicked open sounded through the whole house, followed by the Cloud’s cheerful humming. The man came into the kitchen, in all his biking-piercing-purple glory, helmet under his arm and Oodako somehow clinging to his shoulder. Realizing he wasn’t alone, he paused.</p><p>“Oh,” Skull blinked at seeing Colonnello. He greeted, still cheerful but clearly a bit wary, “Hey. Didn’t expect to see you there.”</p><p>“Same to you,” Colonnello answered, leaning back a bit in his chair. “What are you doing here?”</p><p>“Hm, I was passing by, needed a place to crash, thought ‘<em> why not </em>’ and here I am,” Skull said, shrugging.</p><p>He put his helmet down on the counter, and glanced into the fridge. Grimacing at the fact that it was pretty much empty, he closed it, and settled for getting a glass of water. Once he had his drink, he hopped on the counter, swinging his legs and looking at the blond curiously. Oodako, from his perch, mimicked the swinging with two tentacles.</p><p>“So. How you doin’?” Skull asked, somehow managing to sound like he both was actually interested in the answer and couldn’t care less.</p><p>Colonnello shrugged, because <em> frankly </em>? He was doing pretty bad. Skull probably had noticed the dark circles under his eyes, despite not being the smartest Arcobaleno, and it wouldn’t take a genius to guess that if he was sulking here all alone, he wasn’t at his best. No way he was going to admit that aloud, though.</p><p>“Okay,” Skull said, nodding as though the shrug had been a whole novel on his feelings. “Want to talk about it, or want me to get my secret stash and get wasted?”</p><p>“You have a secret stash?” Colonnello couldn’t help but ask, disbelieving.</p><p>“Duh,” Skull said, looking a bit amused. “How else do you think I coped all those years with you lot?”</p><p>Colonnello, had he been his usual self, would probably have smacked the other. Or shot him. Or kicked him. Or- well, he would have hurt him for being so cheeky and disrespectful. As it was, he felt like shit, and much more sympathetic than he usually would have been. He probably looked like shit, too, and Skull was – maybe – just trying to help. So the Rain snorted, admitting the point.</p><p>As proved by his train of thoughts, he usually was a dick with Skull, and so were the others. Especially Reborn. And he had pretty much emulated Reborn after being Cursed. So, yeah. Colonello thought that the Cloud was justified in having a stash of alcohol somewhere to deal with it.</p><p>“I didn’t think we pushed you to alcoholism,” he still said, wryly.</p><p>“Please, as if anyone could know you guys and remain sober,” Skull said, just as wry.</p><p>Colonnello couldn’t help the chuckle that escaped him at that because, yeah. He could somewhat relate. Catching the small smile quirking Skull’s lips, the blond wondered once more if the man was actually trying to cheer him up. Apparently so.</p><p>Huh. He didn’t think Skull actually cared enough for any of them, given how terrible they were with him, to try to cheer them up.</p><p>It said something about his state of mind that he was feeling somewhat touched by the gesture, instead of annoyed like he might have been. Empathy came with misery, apparently.</p><p>“Nah,” he eventually said, “keep your stash to yourself. You never know when you might need it.”</p><p>“True, I guess,” Skull said. He seemed to hesitate for a second, before gesturing to the tickets. “You mind me asking what these are for?”</p><p>“I-” Colonnello glanced at the tickets, the ones that he had hoped to use for Lal and him. He had bought them with his own money, for a nice surprise, and now- “I’m not sure you’d know. If I say Quidditch?”</p><p>Skull almost fell off the counter. As it was, he only managed to catch himself and almost choke on his water, coughing harshly. Oodako flailed on his shoulder, panicked. Colonnello stared at the stuntman. He couldn’t help but start to grin a little when Skull started to wheeze, water clearly having gone in the wrong pipe.</p><p>“That’s an extreme reaction,” he commented, amused.</p><p>“Glad you find enjoyment in my misery, as always,” Skull managed to wheeze out, trying, and failing, to glare at him. He rubbed his chest, taking a deep breath, before absently petting his octopus. “Sorry ‘bout that. I was just surprised. I didn’t know you had ties with the magical folk.”</p><p>“From your reaction, I’d say you have some as well,” Colonnello pointed out. Skull shrugged, not denying it, but not saying anything – to be fair, given that he had mentioned them, it was obvious that Skull at least <em> knew </em> of their existence. The blond went on, feeling in the mood to share, “I actually found out about the magical society pretty much by accident and luck. I was searching for ways to break the curse, and well. Found a guy that was a curse-breaker.”</p><p>“Ah,” Skull nodded, grimacing, “Yeah, I searched that way too.”</p><p>Neither of them needed to ask to know that it had yielded no result, only false hope and more disappointment. Skull took a small sip of water, carefully swallowing it before asking.</p><p>“The others are aware of the magical community too, then?” He wondered.</p><p>“Lal is, somewhat,” Colonnello nodded, “I told her about it, while I made my research. Reborn is aware as well- I think he found out the same way I did. No clue about Verde, Fon or Mammon, though.”</p><p>Mammon, now that Colonnello was thinking about it, probably knew as well. If one person out of all the mafia had magical blood, it would probably be the miser. In any case, Mammon was an information broker, and the best at it – if one forgot the price. They probably knew about the magical society that lived in a mutual-secrecy-and-peace-agreement with the mafia. Omerta, Statute of Secrecy… Same thing, if you were feeling lucky.</p><p>Skull though- well, if there was one person he didn’t think would know about it, it was the ex-civilian stuntman. How the hell had he managed that?</p><p>“I’m surprised <em> you </em> know about it,” Colonnello voiced, looking at the Cloud. “Not many in the mafia know.”</p><p>“I know,” Skull said, shrugging. “I guess you can say I’ve got a lot of friends in a lot of places.”</p><p>Which, while vague, was fair enough. Skull wasn’t obligated to give his sources – Colonnello hadn’t, after all. Maybe the Cloud was finally learning the ropes, after all those years. The stuntman turned back to the tickets, now doubly curious.</p><p>“So, Quidditch,” he said. “I take it you like it?”</p><p>“Surprisingly, yeah,” Colonnello admitted, with a slight grin, “Contact of mine was always talking about it, I got fed up, they took me to a match and well-” He shrugged in a <em> what can you do </em> manner- “It’s fun.”</p><p>“It is, isn’t it?” Skull nodded, grinning as well – and Colonnello was a bit taken aback, he hadn’t expected Skull to actually be genuinely interested in the topic. “What’s your favourite team?”</p><p>“Thundelarra Thunderers,” Colonnello immediately replied, “They’re great!”</p><p>“An Aussie? Really?” Skull said, looking mock-offended. “Come on, where’s your national pride? Aren’t you Italian?”</p><p>“Please, the Italian teams <em> suck </em> ,” Colonnello snorted. “Besides <em> you </em>’re not even Italian!”</p><p>“Very true,” Skull snickered.</p><p>“What’s <em> your </em> favourite team, then?” Colonnello asked.</p><p>“Ah, that’s tough,” Skull said, grinning, “I used to be a Chudley Canon supporter-” at Colonnello’s clueless look, he explained- “A tiny, loser team of the UK. A friend of mine was a staunch supporter and I didn’t know enough so...” He shrugged, then went on. “But now, I’m torn between the National Bulgarian and the Holyhead Harpies.”</p><p>“Ah,” Colonnello nodded, remembering the two teams somewhat – he liked the sport, but he didn’t know enough to know more than the basics, really. “The Harpies are an all-female team, right? UK?”</p><p>“That’s the one,” Skull said. He hummed, looking once more at the tickets. “You’re going to a Quidditch match with Lal, then, I guess? Which match?”</p><p>Colonnello didn’t answer immediately. For a moment, simply talking with Skull about Quidditch, he had managed to forget a little about Lal. It had been nice. But now- Somehow sensing his mood, Skull hesitantly said.</p><p>“If you don’t-” he started.</p><p>“No, I’m good,” he said. “Lal just wants some time to think things through. I guess getting back together so soon after the Curse was too much.” He chuckled humourlessly. “I mean, we weren’t even sure I’d get back to my normal size, and I was already talking marriage. I guess it’d scare away anyone.”</p><p>“Oh,” Skull said a bit awkwardly.</p><p>“So I was thinking of throwing those-” he waved the tickets- “away, but with the price I paid to get them from my contact...” He huffed, looking at the offending pieces of paper. “Vratsa Vultures against Toyohashi Tengu. For tonight.”</p><p>He looked over at Skull. Skull, whom he didn’t particularly like, and whom he was certain didn’t like him either. Skull who, for some reason, had stopped in the kitchen to talk to him upon seeing that he wasn’t feeling well. Skull who had made him feel less lonely for the first time in days, and forget Lal as well, if only for a moment.</p><p>In a spur of the moment decision, he asked.</p><p>“You want to come with me, since I’ve got a spare ticket?”</p><p>Skull stared at him, looking genuinely stunned. Then, hesitantly, he stood up, and took the second ticket out of Colonnello’s fingers, inspecting it. Eventually, he turned to the blond, and grinned.</p><p>“Sure,” he said, “The Tengus are a good team.”</p><p>Colonnello grinned back, feeling a weight lift a little from his shoulders – had he really been so lonely? But then, Skull asked, cocking his head.</p><p>“So, your contact gave you a portkey to the stadium too?” He asked.</p><p>Portkey – right, instant transport, the ‘hook behind the navel’ thing that was so uncomfortable. Colonnello blinked. Looked at the ticket, clearly saying the match would start that same evening in Bulgaria. Shit. He stared at the ticket blankly. Then back at Skull – who was looking at him with a slowly growing wry smile on his lips, clearly guessing the answer.</p><p>They were in Italy. The match started in a few hours. He <em> didn’t </em> have a portkey – his contact hadn’t even mentioned the transport, and usually Colonnello tagged along with a wizard contact so he wasn’t in charge. It wasn’t like he even <em> knew </em> how to arrange magical transport.</p><p>Fuck, he <em> knew </em> he had forgotten something. Groaning, he slammed his head on the table.</p><p>Skull, that bastard, burst out laughing.</p><p>“Come on,” the stuntman said cheerfully, clasping Colonnello’s shoulder, “I’ll get us there. You’re providing the tickets, after all, it’s only fair.”</p><p>“And how are you going to do that?” Colonnello asked dubiously.</p><p>“Well,” Skull grinned a tad too widely for it to be reassuring, “Have you ever taken the floo?”</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>The floo, Colonnello had known on some level, was travel between one fireplace to another, via magic powder. It also sounded terribly weird and unpractical, since apparently you would get soot all over yourself.</p><p>The reality of the matter was <em> much </em> worse, in his opinion. It was disorienting, dirty, and <em> terrible </em>. He had stumbled out of the fireplace coughing, and kissed the floor with all the elegance of a new born foal. Skull stumbling out of the fireplace and pretty much tripping on him made it just a tiny bit better. Just a tiny bit.</p><p>“Do I want to know <em> how </em> we had a floo connection in the house?” Colonnello grumbled as he dusted himself.</p><p>Skull chuckled, but didn’t answer. Instead, they both headed out of the National Bulgarian Floo Port – and <em> really </em>, Colonnello thought, he would never get used to those magical things, to the secret society hidden underneath everyone’s nose – and into the streets. The Rain almost didn’t see it, but a nudge from his companion directed his attention to a weirdly painted cab parked nearby. He blinked, feeling a sort of fog lifting from his brain.</p><p>“Mist flames?” He wondered aloud.</p><p>“Don’t think so,” Skull answered, even as he gestured to the driver, who was smoking near the car. “Didn’t your contact explain types of magic? Like wards, privacy charms, notice-me-not, muggle-repelling, that sort of things?”</p><p>“Ah, yeah,” Colonnello nodded slowly. It <em> had </em> been mentioned, but it hadn’t stuck much. “I honestly remember just the basics. It’s just so mind-boggling.”</p><p>“I know,” Skull grinned. “Magic is great.”</p><p>He greeted the cab driver in flawless Bulgarian, and mentioned the Quidditch match and something about a malfunctioning portkey – Colonnello’s Bulgarian was far from being fresh, especially in magical terms, but he <em> thought </em> that was what was being said. The driver nodded his head, accepted the coins that Skull handed him, and soon the Rain and Cloud were sitting at the back of the vehicle.</p><p>“Right,” Skull said, softly, in Italian again. (Colonnello found himself wondering why the Cloud was always accommodating him. Wasn’t Skull Romanian?) “So, if I were you, I’d put the safety belt. Magical transports are <em> never </em> nice and calm. Not even vehicles.”</p><p>Colonnello had just barely the time to do as recommended, when the cab suddenly lurched forward, then sped off – at what felt like light speed. Skull gave a delighted whoop, and the blond suddenly remembered that the man <em> lived </em> for life-threatening stunts in vehicles.</p><p>Damn him, and damn those magicals!</p><p>He might have started cursing or attacking, if he hadn’t been so busy fearing for his life and clinging to his seat with all his might.</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>When they arrived to the stadium, barely thirty minutes later, Colonnello threw himself out of the cab, privately convinced that there had never been a better sight than the open air around him. And the ground. Still, not moving, perfectly stable ground.</p><p>He heard Skull say something to the driver, then the cab disappeared, zooming in the distance. Like a demented chariot of hell. If Colonello never saw it again it would still be too soon. Skull grinned at his companion, clearly greatly amused by his pale face.</p><p>“I’m <em> never </em> doing that again,” Colonnello hissed, glaring at the Cloud. “ <em> Never </em>.”</p><p>“And how are we supposed to get back?” Skull asked, eyes <em> twinkling </em> with mirth. (Screw him. Seriously.)</p><p>“I don’t care, we’ll walk,” Colonnello said, “Hell, we’ll even <em> swim </em> back to Italy if we have to. But I’m <em> not </em> taking another magical way of transport. And I thought portkeys were the worst!”</p><p>“I did warn you,” Skull said, “Every way of transport, except perhaps flying, is terrible the magical way.”</p><p>“That was an <em> understatement </em>,” Colonnello told him.</p><p>Skull, still being a bastard (clearly Colonnello hadn’t been in his right mind when he had invited him to this event, and was now living to see the Cloud take revenge for all the years of mistreatment), laughed.</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>The stadium was set in a dark foggy castle, somehow bigger in the inside than the outside. Colonnello had learned a long time ago that magic didn’t make sense, and simply rolled with it. Skull, it seemed, had the same policy because he didn’t even blink at all the fantastic things around them. The moving pictures and goodies, the floating things, the things that broke at least three laws of nature and then some… Skull didn’t look surprised, or even awed, and Colonnello guessed that this clearly wasn’t his first time at a Quidditch match.</p><p>Although, he should have guessed it from the way the other man knew his way around the magical community. It was kind of impressive, really. Colonnello wasn’t sure he’d ever get used to it, so to see Skull be so at ease… Well, it was a bit embarrassing, given that the man still had trouble navigating the mafia sometimes.</p><p>“Oh, Omnioculars,” Skull said, nudging him to look at a salesperson that was handing out odd binoculars out. “Want one?”</p><p>“I have no clue what they are,” the blond admitted. Even though he wasn’t <em> new </em> at all of this, he was far from an expert, knowing only the basics. He had always been happy letting his contacts guide him around.</p><p>“It’s like binoculars, but that record the whole match, can replay some parts slower, tell you about the moves made, the players, and such… It’s great, especially when the players are far, and later you can rewatch the match at home slowly with break by break account of everything,” the stuntman explained. He grinned at him, “So, want one?”</p><p>“Nah, I’m good,” Colonnello said. He looked around at the stadium, full of groups either in dark blue and white, or red and dark grey, then at his tickets. “Free placement. Where do we go?”</p><p>“We’re supporting the Tengus?” Skull asked, looking around as well.</p><p>“Yeah, I guess,” the Rain nodded.</p><p>“Then let’s go there,” Skull said, pointing to a group of blue and white Tengu fans that looked pretty hyped.</p><p>They wormed their way near the group, who greeted them with enthusiasm, asking in excited japanese if they were Tengu fans. When they replied by the affirmative, the group welcomed them with shouts of delight, and started the introductions. Colonnello soon found himself with a blue and white scarf around his neck, courtesy of one of the fans, and laughed when he saw Skull getting more make-up over his face, as well as a blue hat.</p><p>Skull took to it with grace and enthusiasm, chattering away with the fans while they painted the blue and white on his cheeks. Apparently they all were from Nara, and had come to Bulgaria for the only purpose of seeing their favourite team play.</p><p>How was <em> that </em> for dedication.</p><p>“Ah!” One girl whose hair was flashing between white, blue and black, exclaimed, “It’s starting!”</p><p>And indeed, it was. The two teams flew on the stadium, the commentator shouting their names and positions in Bulgarian and Japanese, and then a big count down appeared in the air, made of golden sparks. 3… 2… 1…</p><p>The balls were released, and the game started immediately. Colonnello found himself swiped into the Tengu fan’s enthusiasm, and cheering when they were, and booing when they were.</p><p>Then, maybe thirty minutes into the play – or maybe three hours, because those things made him lose track of time, Skull suddenly tensed, eyes going to a corner of the stadium. Colonnello followed his gaze, and- was that golden?</p><p>“Oh,” he said, registering what he had just seen – and clearly, from the way Skull’s eyes were darting around, he was following it’s trail as well. “Good eyes!”</p><p>“Same to you,” Skull replied, grinning.</p><p>Soon enough, though, his attention was distracted by one particularly vicious play between the team. The whole group of fans seemed to be holding their breath, when suddenly- one Tengu dropped from his broom, only the quick reflexes of his team keeping him in the air.</p><p>The crowd went wild.</p><p>“Foul!” Skull bellowed, along with the group next to them, “That vicious, cheating bastard! Foul!”</p><p>“What happened?” Colonnello asked, bewildered.</p><p>“A Vulture grabbed his broom by the tail, and broke some twigs, and then gave a kick to the chaser,” another fan replied, outraged, before resuming howling with Skull and the others, “Foul!”</p><p>The referee thankfully stopped the match and gave a warning to the offender, and the play resumed. Somehow, the Tengu fans seemed even more fired up.</p><p>“Come on!” Skull hollered next to him, slinging an arm around his shoulders and pumping his fist in the air, not even looking at Colonnello as he shouted, “Come on, get that Quaffle!”</p><p>Colonnello, despite the manhandling and the shouting in his ears, grinned.</p><p>And when the Tengus managed to score, he was right there with Skull and the others, whooping and screaming in approval.</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>The play ended with 280-120 for the Tengus. The resulting victory party that the Japanese supporters threw was completely insane, in Colonnello’s opinion. Mixing sports fans and alcohol wasn’t a good idea on a normal day. Adding magic to the mix was a whole new level of madness. Why he let Skull and the other fans drag him to the party still eluded him.</p><p>Not that he <em> really </em> regretted it – the party, although crazy, was also hilarious, and great fun. Still, Colonnello vowed there and then to never touch a drop of magical alcohol ever again. Just one cup of Sakusake was enough to make him dizzy.</p><p>“Holy shit,” he breathed, after almost inhaling his first sip of sake wrong. “That stuff is <em> strong </em>!”</p><p>“Well yeah,” Skull laughed, sipping on his own cup as if it wasn’t the equivalent of ten shots of vodka in one tiny cup. “Magicals have an absurdly strong alcohol tolerance, so they need stronger stuff. I never had Sakusake before, though!” He took another sip, and grinned. “I like it!”</p><p>Almost to congratulate him for that opinion, sakura petals started falling around him, and Skull laughed. Colonnello suddenly realized that the same thing was happening all around them – anyone drinking Sakusake was under a soft rain of pink petals. The blond blinked at his own cup, and at the lack of petals above him, wondering if he was deducing the appearance of the petals wrong.</p><p>“Why aren’t there petals for me?” He asked Skull (and no, he wasn’t pouting in disappointment, despite what Skull would later claim), who he had decided was the authority in magical matters between the two of them.</p><p>For some reason, the Cloud was ever patient and explained things clearly when asked. He didn’t make fun of Colonnello for wondering about things, and the blond appreciated it. His contacts were usually a bit – a lot – condescending when he asked questions, and it discouraged him pretty fast from asking things.</p><p>“Is it because I don’t have magic?” He asked, a bit quieter – making sure no one heard that bit.</p><p>“Nah, everyone has <em> some </em> ambient magic. It’s always enough to activate that kind of charms. It’s probably your flames,” Skull said, shaking his head to make the thin layer of pink fall off his hair. He looked at the blond. “Try to control them so that they don’t interact with the spell.”</p><p>Colonnello hummed, understanding. It was true that his magical contacts <em> had </em> told him that flames and magic sometimes mixed badly. Rain flames would slow the magic and sometimes prevent it from making effect. Tightening his hold on his flames, the blond took another sip, just to see- And grinned when sakura petals started falling on him too.</p><p>“Congrats!” Skull grinned at him. He was sipping – was that his <em> fourth </em> cup of sake, holy fuck, “You like the sake?”</p><p>“I like the petals,” Colonnello admitted, still grinning at the somewhat simple but still great display of magic. He then grimaced a little. “But I think I’ll revert to normal alcohol. I can’t handle that stuff too much.” He eyed Skull. “How do <em> you </em> handle it?”</p><p>“I’m used to it,” Skull told him, taking yet another sip – the area around him was getting pinker by the second. As was, in fact, the whole party area. He grinned. “One day, I’ll make you try out firewhiskey! It’s amazing.”</p><p>“Let me guess,” Colonnello said wryly, “It’s whiskey, but ten times stronger and that makes… fire appear?”</p><p>“Makes you <em> breathe </em> fire,” Skull corrected with a grin.</p><p>“Sounds crazy,” Colonnello said.</p><p>“It’s magic,” Skull said back.</p><p>Colonnello snorted, looking at the Japanese fans, who were now dancing in the sakura petals and making fireworks and colourful things appear from seemingly thin air. He could see a few of them waving wands, and others seemed to rely on some kind of jewelry or other things to cast spells. One woman was using a fan (the air-making, paper and wood kind, not the sports supporter one) to make paper dragons appear and dance around in the air.</p><p>Magic, crazy… Same thing.</p><p>Amazing, though.</p><p>Then people started getting a bit naked, and he amended his statement. That was one view of the Tengu fans that he could have lived without.</p><p><br/>
