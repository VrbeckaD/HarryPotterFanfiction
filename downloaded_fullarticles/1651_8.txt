  <em>“But are we all lost stars, trying to light up the dark?”</em>
</p><p align="center">—</p><p>It starts slowly and ends suddenly.</p><p align="center">—</p><p>The day before the incident, Remus laughs. He laughs like the moon-ache isn’t in his bones, like his joints don’t creak, like the hunger isn’t creeping up within him, ready to strike.</p><p>He smiles and he jokes and he threatens to turn James’s hair pink if y<em>ou don’t get that Snitch out of my face, I swear to Merlin, Prongs!</em></p><p>The day before the incident, everything is fine. They are sixteen and on top of the world. Remus has friends, good grades, and a life he can be proud of despite everything.</p><p>There is a war, yes, but it is distant, and young boys are invincible.</p><p><em>We’re not young</em>, James insists. After all, they’re practically seventeen.</p><p>“We’re old enough to fuck, to fight—“</p><p>“To die,” intones Sirius, with the same sulking bitterness he’s had since he ran away from home over the summer. He pretends it doesn’t bother him that his mum blasted him off the family tree, but Remus knows better. He sees the storm brewing behind his grey eyes when he thinks no one’s watching.</p><p>“We’re not going to—ARGGH!”</p><p>Peter’s well-timed Gobstones attack strikes James right between the eyes. Sirius’s lips twitch, and the cloud passes, leaving only twinkling stars in its wake.</p><p align="left">Everything is fine.</p><p align="center">—</p><p align="left">White light blinds Remus as he peels back gritty eyes. His head throbs with the same <em>thump-thud</em> of the rising and falling tide, which ebbs as the light fades into shapes, colors, and finally, faces.</p><p>James hovers above him uncertainly, his eyes crinkling with worry. There are scratches on the side of his face—three shallow slashes that look sickeningly like claw marks. He didn’t have them yesterday. Peter fidgets behind him, half-hidden in the swirls of his disheveled robes. He’s vaguely green as he picks nervously at the hem of his jumper.</p><p>Sirius is nowhere to be seen.</p><p>“Where’s Sirius?”</p><p>His own hoarseness surprises him. It’s been years since he’s howled himself raw, since he’s woken up after a full moon with a blank space for memories and the vague taste of metal in the back of his throat. Back before Hogwarts, his only victim was himself, the hunger driving him to bite and tear at his own tender flesh until deep, dark gashes of blood painted the cellar floor red. He craved the tang of iron and the taste of human meat between his fangs. When the moon-sickness took hold, he wasn’t Remus Lupin, the quiet, slight boy of Number 13 Heol Berwyn anymore; he was a monster.</p><p>But Hogwarts changed that. <em>His friends</em> changed that.</p><p>Instead of being terrified or angry when they discovered his secret, they took it upon themselves to spit in the face of an entire sub-section of wizarding law and every school rule on the book to become illegal Animagi.</p><p>For him, a half-breed.</p><p>As the moon rose and sparkled across the depths of the Black Lake that first month after their transformations, a dog, a stag, and a rat joined him in the Shrieking Shack. Together, they became Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs, purveyors of magical mischief and kings of Hogwarts.</p><p>For the first time since turning, Remus was able to keep his mind—to keep <em>himself</em>.</p><p>For the first time since turning, he didn’t feel like a monster.</p><p>“How much d’you remember, mate?”</p><p>James speaks the words, but he doesn’t sound like himself. There’s something there, lurking just underneath and out of sight, but Remus’s head is too foggy to discover it. The room slides in and out of view like the moment between waking and sleeping, when the world is twilight and shadows move in the dark.</p><p>An old fear rises from these shadows and festers in the pit of his stomach, a curdling sensation he hasn’t felt in over a year:</p><p>“Did I hurt him?”</p><p>James shakes his head wildly so his glasses nearly fall off. “No!”</p><p>“Then—<em>what</em>?”</p><p>“Ah, Mr. Lupin,” speaks a kindly voice behind them. Dumbledore appears from seemingly nowhere, his violet robes brushing the ground as he walks with the agility of a man half his age.</p><p>“Headmaster?" The question quivers out from between his lips.</p><p>“I wonder, perhaps,” says Dumbledore to James and Peter, “if I might have a few moments alone with our injured friend…”</p><p>James opens his mouth to argue, but Dumbledore gives him a look over his half-moon spectacles that has his jaw snapping shut. He slides away from the bed, dragging Peter along with him. They linger anxiously by the entrance until Madam Pomfrey shoos them away and locks the door behind them. Her footsteps echo off the walls until she returns to a stack of precariously piled student charts and disappears behind them.</p><p>Trepidation builds in Remus’s stomach as Dumbledore rummages through his deep pockets, eventually unearthing several small, white, sugary mice.</p><p>“Ice mice?”</p><p>He shakes his head mutely.</p><p>“A wise choice, I think,” says Dumbledore with a hum, stowing them back in his pocket. “Chattering teeth do begin to rattle the brain after awhile.”</p><p>The headmaster pulls up a chair beside Remus’s white-sheeted bed, and now he knows they are getting to the true purpose of Dumbledore’s visit. But as with everything, Dumbledore takes his time, first draping his robes across his legs comfortably, then smoothing his long, white beard with his hand.</p><p>The clock on the wall ticks menacingly.</p><p>“You’ll be pleased to know that no one was injured,” says Dumbledore, his kindly blue eyes surveying Remus through his glasses. “Aside, perhaps, from Severus’s pride, which I’m told has suffered a terrible blow.”</p><p>“Snape…?”</p><p>“Mr. Potter managed to successfully rescue Mr. Snape before he encountered a fully grown werewolf and what would’ve been an excruciatingly painful end; although Mr. Snape seems less grateful than one might expect.”</p><p>
  <em>The moon throbs within his veins.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>And then—the scent—</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Human.</em>
</p><p>Cold creeps along his skin, an icy frost that turns his blood sluggish and constricts his lungs until he thinks he might pass out. He remembers the smell of blood, thick and hot and mouth-watering. It’s been so long since the wolf has fed, since he’s tasted soft skin and dined on juicy marrow.</p><p>
  <em>The wolf is hungry, and dinner has served itself up on a gold platter.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>He paces in front of the door as it draws nearer, opening his jowls eagerly.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The door creaks open; the air ripens with delicious fear and pounding blood. He swipes his claws at the intruders and catches buttery-soft flesh.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>He howls.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Easy, Moony,” soothes a familiar voice.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The blood taint passes, and the wolf is hungry and alone again.</em>
</p><p>“Furthermore,” continues Dumbledore, “I have Mr. Snape’s assurances, however resentful they may be, that he will not reveal the nature of your condition to anyone.”</p><p>“And you really trust him?” he asks in the same coarse voice as before.</p><p>“Yes,” he replies with a simple nod, “for reasons I shan’t explain now. Whatever feud you, young Misters Black, Potter, and Pettigrew have with Mr. Snape, let this be the end of them. For I fear a greater victim than tonight’s should they continue.”</p><p>Bile rises in his throat.</p><p>
  <em>Sirius.</em>
</p><p>“Professor—where’s Sirius? Why isn’t he here?”</p><p>Dumbledore smiles sadly, but it does little to calm him. He rather wishes he hadn’t smiled at all.</p><p align="center">—</p><p>September 1st, 1971: Remus sits on his bed as he unpacks his trunk and tries not to squirm under three curious pairs of eyes.</p><p>“I’m Sirius,” says a haughty boy with a defiant chin tilt. “Sirius Black.”</p><p><em>Sirius</em>, he muses—the brightest star in the sky.</p><p>And he does shine brightest.</p><p>But the brightest stars are the quickest to burn out.</p><p align="center">—</p><p>He smells him before he sees him—a depressing tang of salty tears and stale firewhiskey that reeks from beyond the dormitory door. As if he deserves to drown his pathetic sorrows in a bottle of Ogden’s Finest.</p><p>As if he deserves any sympathy at all.</p><p>He came to see him once while Remus was asleep. The bitter bite of alcohol tainted his fever-dream as the long, silver fingers of the moon reluctantly released their hold over him. He hovered over him conspicuously and whispered “Moony?" But Remus kept his eyes shut and pretended to be asleep even as he sniffled out apology after wet apology.</p><p>He doesn’t want his apology.</p><p>He doesn’t want anything to do with Sirius Black.</p><p>He thought he loved him once, maybe, with the same world-consuming swell of emotion in which all fourteen-year-old boys drown. Sirius was lounging on the sofa in the common room, his long, slender fingers curled in Marlene McKinnon’s mahogany hair (Sirius’s first girlfriend, but most definitely not his last), and suddenly Remus’s weak heart <em>ached</em> to feel his elegant fingers curled in his own blonde locks.</p><p>Would they be tender and supple—the fingers of a reluctant aristocrat? Or would they be sensual and curious, wandering under Remus’s shirt, tracing every pale scar, until they slipped beneath his trousers and—</p><p>He had to excuse himself quickly at that, beating out his hard-on with his own calloused palm as he imagined Sirius’s playful grin and meandering hands.</p><p>Maddeningly, from then on it was as if Sirius could read his mind; he always had some excuse to touch him, whether he was helping him perfect the wand movement for a Bedazzling Hex or carrying him to the hospital wing after a full moon. His hands were always there, hovering along Remus’s skin, driving him to the brink of insanity.</p><p>Remus was drunk on the way his fingers wrapped around his first cigarette in fifth year (“Filthy Muggle habit,” said Sirius gleefully. “Mum’ll hate this!”) and stroked the neck of a butterbeer bottle in the Three Broomsticks, and he’d never been so bollocksed, for when the older boy came back late one Saturday smelling of Ginger Chan’s cheap, glitter-infested perfume, he wanted nothing more than to pin him to the bed and let the wolf take him.</p><p>How long did Remus pray to a god he only casually believed in to relieve him of this curse? How many times had he cried out Sirius’s name in the wet corners of the shower, wishing he could put an end to the madness?</p><p>And now here he is, completely cured of his obsession with Sirius Black, and all he feels is numb.</p><p>He wants to be angry. He wants to shout and scream himself hoarse, to beat his fists on Sirius’s pretty face until he understands the pain he’s caused Remus.</p><p>But <em>Merlin</em>, Remus is tired.</p><p>He’s tired of living and he’s tired of loving and he’s <em>so very tired</em> of Sirius Black.</p><p>“Pomfrey finally let you out, eh?” asks James in a falsely cheery voice when Remus works up the energy to push open the dormitory door.</p><p>James is trying so hard to make everything go back to normal, but he doesn’t understand: it can never be normal again.</p><p>“Would’ve been sooner, but I snapped clean through one of my bones, and it took a bit of mending,” he replies, looking directly at Sirius. And bloody hell, doesn’t he look pathetic, cringing behind his scarlet drapes like he has the right to be upset.</p><p>James seems to be at a loss, caught between two imploding stars, and settles on gently clapping Remus on the back while maintaining his counterfeit smile: “Well, welcome back, mate.”</p><p>“Cheers,” agrees Peter, looking nervously from Remus to Sirius.</p><p>Sirius opens his mouth to speak—perhaps another “I’m so sorry” or “I didn’t know what I was thinking” or a quiet, pleading “<em>Moony</em>”—but Remus, who doesn’t think he’ll be able to control himself if he hears him simper one more time, beats him to it.</p><p>“Guess you’ve finally managed to make your parents proud after all, eh, Padfoot?”</p><p>And without another word, he climbs into his four-poster, shuts the curtains behind him, and doesn’t think about the broken pieces of Sirius he leaves lying on the floor.</p><p align="center">—</p><p>It is the spring of 1971. There is no talk of Voldemort, no worries of war, no whisper of fear. There is only a boy and his mother and a sadness that lingers between them.</p><p>Remus Lupin is eleven years old today.</p><p>But there are no parties or presents, no well-wishes or jolly good fellows—only another year of bright red scars which fade slower than the setting sun.</p><p>Only a kiss from his mother and a soft “<em>fi'n caru ti</em>.”</p><p>No father, who can barely stand to look at his son’s scarred face most days, and no Hogwarts letter.</p><p>Most eleven-year-olds, at least the ones born to wizard-kind, anticipate their eleventh birthday above all the rest. Many spend the day with their noses pressed against dirty window panes, searching the skies for tawny owls that bring them their futures wrapped in parchment and red wax seals.</p><p>But Remus Lupin is not one of them, and he studiously avoids the bright blue sky and glowing sun that glitters on the last vestiges of melting snow. He spends the day with his nose in a book and reads words upon words, though none are the words he desperately wishes to read.</p><p>Remus Lupin is a wizard, but unlike most magical children his age, he will not be attending the prestigious Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.</p><p>Remus Lupin is also a werewolf, and as such, is a danger to anyone and everyone around him.</p><p>He was bitten at the tender age of five, retribution for his father’s tirades against “dangerous monsters,” but Remus barely remembers it. Frightening crimson eyes visit him and his bones shatter into a million tiny pieces in the depths of his nightmares.</p><p>He remembers his mother’s hand on his forehead after, the glistening tears in her amber eyes, and the soft press of lips on his cheek as he drifts into unconsciousness.</p><p>He remembers his father’s disdain, the absence of his touch, and his mother’s hysterical voice as she begs her husband to hug his son.</p><p><em>He doesn’t have the luxury of being a boy, Hope,</em> raves Lyall Lupin. <em>He’s got to know. He’s got to prepare himself. There are a lot meaner things than me out there. He can’t let himself be crushed by them. He’s got to be stronger—better. Or he’ll never survive.</em></p><p>Remus hears every word from the top of the stairs, but when his mother comes to check on him later, he hides under the covers and silently squeezes the tears from his eyes.</p><p>There are more arguments after that, more nights spent with his head resting on damp pillowcases, but like a wolf that has put on its winter coat, the cold words don’t penetrate his flesh. Remus accepts that he is a monster, and therefore, when his father forces them to move because the Muggles begin to ask odd questions about the sickly boy at Number 13, he packs his books quietly and goes without argument.</p><p>When he gets loose one full moon and nearly bites a villager, he lets his father put him in chains the next month and howls at the constellations through the slit of a single, boarded window.</p><p>And so his life is thus; all the misery of their existence belongs to him, and he carries it with the grace of a man much older and and stronger than himself.</p><p>On his eleventh birthday, Remus doesn’t ask his mother about his Hogwarts letter. He already knows the answer.</p><p align="center">—</p><p>“Professor—where’s Sirius? Why isn’t he here?”</p><p>Dumbledore smiles sadly, but it does little to calm him. He rather wishes he hadn’t smiled at all.</p><p>“Forgive me, Remus. I forgot that as you had already begun your transformation, you are unaware of the circumstances which led to tonight’s events. Suffice it to say that Mr. Black is well and unharmed, although like Mr. Snape, he is nursing his injured pride. As I understand it, Mr. Black played a rather unfunny prank on Mr. Snape, which led him to the Shrieking Shack and to you. When Mr. Potter learned what Mr. Black had done, he went after Severus and pulled him back, saving both your lives in the process. I believe now that Mr. Black is currently serving detention with Professor McGonagall, and shall be for some time.</p><p>“With that being said, Madam Pomfrey would have my head if I didn’t instruct you to get some rest. So I bid you pleasant dreams, Remus.”</p><p>Then Dumbledore leaves, as though he hasn’t dismantled Remus’s world in the span of ten minutes.</p><p>Despite years of transformations, despite broken bones, infected wounds, and scars that ache when it rains, Remus has never felt such consuming, life-shattering pain. It’s like flames, licking at his skin—like drinking acid, like dying and coming back a thousand times only to die again more gruesomely than the last.</p><p>Sirius betrayed him. Somewhere deep inside him, in the fears that Remus has never spoken aloud, the whispers that caress him in the dead of night when silvery moonlight streams through the window and dust particles dance in the air like falling stars, Remus knew that this would happen. He knew because he feels the monster in his veins. He can’t escape, no matter where he runs or how hard he pushes himself. The monster is there, lurking, eager to rear its ugly head and do what monsters do best.</p><p>Perhaps once Remus dreamed of a different life; perhaps once he thought he could be normal—that he could have friends, a life outside of lycanthropy—a future.</p><p><em>You must have hope, Remus,</em> said his mother. <em>The future isn’t written in stone.</em></p><p>Perhaps not, he concedes. Perhaps it's written in blood—bright crimson blood that stains Remus’s hands. He can never wash it off; he puts it there with every full moon adventure and with every near miss that leaves them breathless with laughter afterwards.</p><p>He is nothing but a game to them, a thrill for spoiled rich brats. They don’t care that this is his life. If James hadn’t pulled Snape back, Remus would’ve torn him to bits and been executed like a rabid dog. History would’ve remembered him as nothing more than another rogue werewolf that cut short the life of a bright young student.</p><p>Remus’s very life hung in the balance of this so-called prank.</p><p>And Sirius hadn’t given one bloody fuck.</p>
