    <p>He knew as soon as the wand hit his hand it was over.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Over for Riddle, of course, and as he watched the man he’d been fighting for seven years disintegrate before his eyes, all he could comprehend, all that he could <em> feel,</em> was a weary, trembling satisfaction.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As the last remnant of his mortal enemy fell into nonexistence he sagged to the ground, knees bruising from the impact, and he shuddered, his stomach twisting beyond anything that could possibly be considered comfort, before <em> it </em>happened.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And then he realised. It was over for <em> him </em> too.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It began all at once, and seemed to end within that very moment too. A sharp tugging at his naval, reminiscent of portkey travel, accompanied by a white hot pain had him screaming in agony, the tugging spreading as though cold fingers were digging into his flesh and scooping out his insides, pulling and pulling until shards of his body broke away, fraying like the crudely cut edges of fabric. His fingers, arms, legs turning to dust. Even his tears seemed to scatter, vanish, as if they weren’t made of matter to begin with.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“No!” He choked, the word dissolving into ash as quickly as his tongue. “Stop, please!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There was a laugh- or at least he thought there was amidst the hazy throes of pain. A cold, high, rasping laugh, so similar to the one that haunted his nightmares that came hand in hand with ruby eyes and an empty smile that they might as well be one and the same.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A soft voice- the owner of that terrible, terrible laugh said something, and then had to repeat itself because Harry couldn’t hear it over the sounds of his own screams.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It said: “Don’t look, child. Close your eyes.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Why?” He wanted to shout. “Who are you? Why are you hurting me? Why should I trust you?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But he couldn’t speak. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Close your eyes!” The voice sounded more insistent.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He was without choice, in too much pain to bear his own thoughts longer, and he hovered at the edge of consciousness. He let his eyelids flutter- once, twice, before they shut and the final piece of him dissolved into oblivion.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And then the torture ceased.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>From oblivion into the light.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry’s eyes remained closed- his <em> eyes, </em> as though they were actually <em> there. </em> Indeed, he did feel rather more solid, more put together. He was trembling, too, his <em> body- </em> his actual body- shaking, his fingers grasping the ground beneath him- a texture so unlike anything he’d ever felt before but so undoubtedly there <em> . </em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>He opened his eyes, looked down at his body, and sobbed in relief, hands now roving over his torso and limbs. He was whole. He was <em> safe- </em>in a relative sort of way. </p>
<p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p>
<p>He raised his head, taking in his surroundings- or perhaps a better term would be <em> lack </em> of surroundings. Though he felt as though he was on solid ground, the expanse of white nothingness before him said otherwise. A place entirely void of everything. Harry almost laughed in a quiet disbelief, because how could he have expected anything else? He lived for the weird, for the unexplainable, because circumstances such as those seemed to be drawn to him like a moth to a flame. Yet this was different- unlike anything that had happened to him before, he could feel it, in his body, in his bones, thrumming through his veins like this sense of unease he was experiencing had its own, beating heart- and though he didn’t know <em> why- </em> he had an indubitable certainty that unlike the debacle in the forest, this was most definitely <em> not </em>happening inside his head.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There was a familiar chuckle- though Harry could not place where he’d heard it before, and he turned sharply, gripping his wand defensively in front of him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A place entirely void of everything, it seemed, except for the giant stone gate etched with unfamiliar symbols, the humanoid figure that clearly wasn’t human seated cross legged on the non-existent floor, and of course, Harry himself.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Who are you?” He choked out. He felt a vague sort of surprise to hear the words actually leave his mouth, his curiosity indomitably overshadowed by the sheer power that the being in front of him exuded. It wasn’t a <em> frightening </em> aura per se, he wasn’t scared, but silenced in quiet awe.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It wasn’t like the darkness, the shadows that seemed to overcome any room Tom Riddle stood in- no, that was limited. That magic had been human, even wielded by a wizard of Voldemort’s strength. Everything the man had done had been within the confines of humanity, as disgusting, as <em> depraved </em>as those actions had been. They were still human, for Riddle had never ascended to the immortal, God-like status he’d so blatantly craved. He’d been born as a human, and had died as one too, alone and as pitiful as the day he’d been brought into the world.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In truth, Voldemort had been nothing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The creature before him radiated a force far greater, limitless in comparison- superior through the blinding lack of shadows, chilling in the absence of light. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em> There is no good or evil, only power, and those too weak to seek it. </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘<em> This is what you wanted,’ </em> Harry thought bitterly. <em> ‘Wasn’t it, Riddle? You wanted to </em> be <em> this </em>.’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Standing in the scope of such magnificence, he thanked whatever deity it was before him that his foe had ultimately failed. For a man so accomplished in evil to become like the being in front of him- the consequences didn’t bear thinking about.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It took him a moment to realise how violently he was trembling, his arm holding the wand was shaking, as if he were holding up an immense weight. He shifted on his feet, an odd kind of fear coming over him as he realised he may have asked the wrong question- the correct words, of course, being, “What are you?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But then, he wasn’t sure he could handle the answer he’d be given.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The creature, being, <em> whatever </em> it was, grinned in delight- and dear lord, those <em> teeth </em> , white and sharp, in perfect condition- and somehow a smile had never been more terrifying <em> , </em>nor so absolute than in the white, vacant void than seemed to span for eternity. It wasn’t a smile, but a truth, and it felt more real than anything he’d ever experienced before.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Hello Harry.” It spoke as though it had a mouthful of gravel, though every word rang crystal clear. There was no echo in the wide space. The words sounded flat and empty, as though all the emotion had been wrung out of them.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And then, as if his perception had been altered by that empty, empty voice, all he could feel was deep fear, and a sense of utter wrongness.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This <em> wasn’t </em>right. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“What are you?” He gripped the wand ferociously, his heart beating haphazardly. “Tell me,” he ordered, willing his arm to stop shaking so vehemently. “Answer the question!” Cold fear trickling into the pit of his stomach, and sweat trickled down his back. He wasn’t sure if the shock had worn off, or if he just hadn’t noticed until now how deathly afraid he really was, but the magnitude of the being before him struck him hard, and it had scared him. “Answer or I’ll-”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Are you really going to use my own wand against me?” The thing interrupted, shifting it’s head towards the conduit clutched in his hands. There was suddenly a cruel, greedy look on it’s white, fleshy face, and Harry felt himself recoil in a kind of disbelieving horror, taking a shaky step back, feeling for a strange, absurd moment, as though he’d been deceived. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“What do you mean?” He whispered, the grip so hard on his wand that his fingers were turning white. “What do you mean by your<em> wand </em>?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Oh come now, child.” The creature’s tone wasn’t quite dismissive, but there was a pervasive disdain that coated every word. “I know you’re not as dense as you pretend to be. The wand you’re holding- surely you’ve noticed it’s not your <em> regular </em>conduit.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry <em> had </em> noticed, in the back of his mind, but he’d pushed it aside, a little too preoccupied by the events that had just occurred to even think about the fact that he’d technically won the <em> elder wand </em>from Riddle. He’d pulled it out in a panicked haste, leaving his stolen (won, he’d won it and it was rightfully his) hawthorn wand safely stowed in the pocket of his lacerated denims.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The elder wand. The elder wand was- it was-</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A deathly hallow.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em> Are you really going to use my own wand against me? </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>His heartbeat stuttered, and all the breath in his body left him so violently that he almost choked as he registered the damning, ruinous words that shattered everything he thought he knew, because that had been a <em> story book. </em> It wasn’t supposed to be real, wasn’t supposed to be anything more than a cautionary tale, and yet he couldn’t deny the presence of the powerful being before him, nor the magnitude of simple <em> existence </em> it managed to emanate, and finally, in the face of his unnerving revelation he managed to utter the single truth he’d suspected since the moment he’d found himself in this god-forsaken place -</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You’re Death.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The being in front of him slowly smiled, exposing it’s white, shark-like teeth and inclined its head. “That is correct, Harry.” It praised him, as though he were a small child learning how to walk. Perhaps by it’s standards, that was all he appeared to be- all that his short life, troubled and full of strife though it had been, amounted to in the face of this immortal.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A slow kind of anger was seeping through him like a slow acting poison- except that he allowed it, accepted it, as it coiled around his mind, corrupting the fear he’d been nurturing and moulding it into its own, because… because <em> where was the justice? </em> This thing had lifted him from the world, on the cusp of his bloody victory. It had stolen something from him, stolen his life, his love, his <em> future </em> , as though everything he’d built since his pitiful existence in that lonely cupboard meant nothing - and he had no assurance of his return.  He took a slow breath, trying desperately to keep his expression blank, because despite his rage, despite his wrathful, <em> fearful </em> fury that had settled deep within his bones, his only defence against this indomitable, incomprehensible being was apathy. “I just can’t believe it,” was all he eventually whispered, except it wasn’t exactly that he couldn’t- he simply didn’t <em> want </em> to.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This was impossible, it should be impossible. Death wasn’t really real- at least, not in the most corporeal sense. By all realms of logic he should not be talking, let alone be having a conversation, with it. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><em> Why not? </em> His subconscious whispered, betrayal etched into every innocuous word. <em> The presence of souls and spirits is an actuality, you’ve witnessed this yourself. </em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>He had- Riddle’s damaged soul, tattered beyond repair came to mind.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em> Is the existence of Death really such a chasm to cross? </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It should have been, but it wasn’t. Not anymore.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I’ve also gone by Truth.” The creature- thing- <em> whatever </em> added, as though it were blissfully unaware of Harry’s internal struggle. Something the seventeen year old was positively sure was <em> not </em>the case. “Do you have any other names you go by, Harry James Potter?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Then it laughed, hollow and broken, as something that should have been there was just… </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Gone.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry stiffened. “Something funny?” he asked sharply, allowing the rush of anger he’d felt earlier to disguise the fear that gripped his heart, cinching the invisible bands that had coiled, tight and unyielding around his rib cage. He wasn’t about to play the game that the being in front of him was offering- wasn’t about to engage in a battle of bloody <em> wit, </em> when he’d been pulled from a battle of actual blood and sweat, a battle that he’d been forced to <em> abandon, </em> because some immortal saw fit to bloody interfere. His eyes smarted, and he scrubbed a sleeve over them roughly, self-disgust burning like an unquenchable fire. He would not cry. He wouldn’t.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The creature turned its head, its gaze assessing as it stared at him. “Hilarious.” It answered. “I have’ many who come through these doors believing me to be God.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“God.” Harry whispered, his voice cracking. “Right.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Not you though.” It’s voice was grave, but an undercurrent of mirth still ran thickly through its words. “You never even asked, and- I wonder, Harry Potter, if the thought even occurred to you.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It hadn’t. He stayed silent, his throat feeling suddenly and inexplicably tight. He couldn’t have spoken even if he’d wanted to.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Answer my question, Harry.” Death commanded.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There hadn’t been a question, not really, though he understood what the immortal was asking of him. He considered the unfairness of it all, the injustice of how terrifyingly permanent all this felt, and in the end he spoke the damning words. “I don’t believe God would ever be so cruel.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You believe a God must love his creation?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“A God that isn’t loving isn’t a God to me at all!” Harry lashed out, losing the battle he’d been fighting against his fear, rage and exhaustion loosening his tongue. “And you are neither. Voldemort died- I saw it. I gained his wand, which means I won. I didn’t die, and- and it fulfilled the prophecy! <em> Neither one can live while the other survives. </em> I killed him! You’ve no right to take my life too!” He was breathing heavily by then, his brow clammy and chilled, as though he was suffering from sudden fever. “You’ve taken me away from my friends- I don’t even know if they’re still alive.” He was aware how small his voice had become, how childlike- and he hated it. “That <em> is </em> cruel, and you are <em> not </em>a God.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The creature smiled softly, and it seemed almost warm. “You are right, child.” It murmured. “I am not God. There simply isn’t one, loving or otherwise- unfortunate, I know. You humans will just have to put up with me instead.” It laughed again, still frighteningly empty but perhaps a little less hollow- as though it was filled with something other than its previous dull apathy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Aren’t you going to tell me why you brought me here?” The desperation colouring his voice took him by surprise and he swiped a few errant tears from his cheeks. <em> Damn it </em> . He <em> couldn’t </em>look weak. He closed his eyes, as more wretched words fell from his lips, “I need to get back, please. I need to get back to my family.” A sob tore from his throat, and he cringed away, the loss of control over his emotions making his stomach clench. He’d fought the darkest wizard of the age, and yet one meeting with the timeless being in front of him had sent him straight back to the cradle.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Though he supposed, compared to an immortal, they were all infantile, gaping at the world through wide, guileless eyes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Oh, Harry.” That voice, that vacant, colourless voice, sounded overwhelmingly stricken, as though it had just been made aware of a great loss. “Child, I <em> cannot </em> send you back. I’m so sorry.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Then why am I here?” Harry choked on his tears, for the loss was his. He didn’t for a second believe that the callous, unfeeling creature before him was <em> sorry </em>. “Why am I here? Damn it, Death, answer me!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I think you already know that, Harry. You have ownership of all three hallows. Do you remember what happens to those who manage that?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry clenched his fists, unable to speak without feeling like he was going to burst into another round of sobs. “Just say it,” he whispered, throat tightening in fear. “Enough- enough of your bloody words, just say it!” He sucked in quick, sharp breaths that left him more than a little lightheaded as panic seized his muscles. His heart hammering in his chest, he all but glared at the immortal being. “Tell me the truth! That’s what you claim you are, isn’t it?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>An icy calm seemed to settle over its disposition, and it shifted as though it was about to clamber to its feet. “Very well.” The words were cool and dispassionate, detached from any warmth they might have previously possessed. “Though you would do well to know your place.” The creature did stand then, showing Harry the full extent of its body. It was sickening- humanoid in appearance, and yet so unlike anything remotely resembling a <em> person. </em> He couldn’t help but feel the view was deliberate. <em> You are alone here, </em> the creature seemed to be saying. <em> I am </em> not <em> like you. Do not speak to me as though we are equals. </em>It’s gaping mouth opened again, displaying its blinding, sharkish grin, before it spoke once more, a note of admonishment still present in its broken voice, “You hold ownership over my Hallows, Harry Potter. You were told this would lead to your acquisition of the title, ‘Master of Death’, though I doubt that is why you managed to achieve such a thing. You’re not the type to desire power in such a way.” It paused. “Am I correct?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry nodded mutely, faintly aware of the horrified expression he wore. <em> This did </em> not <em> sound good. </em>Not any measurable amount of good, or even of mediocrity-</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Well then,” the immortal started walking slowly towards him, and he unwittingly stumbled backwards, fright etched across his youthful face. It stopped, head cocked to one side in blatant amusement as it chuckled. “Consider the title acquired, Master of Death.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em> Do you have any other names you go by, Harry James Potter? </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It made sense now. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Make no mistake,” it drifted forward, ignoring Harry’s flinch as he forced himself to remain still, even though all he wanted to do in that moment was run, run, run. “You are <em> not </em>my master.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I don’t- don’t understand,” he whispered haltingly. “Please.” It was a plea he couldn’t find the words for- a desire for <em> something, </em> though he couldn’t be sure <em> what. </em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>It seemed to hesitate then, suddenly, oddly, as though it wasn’t entirely sure of itself, which didn’t make any <em> sense, </em> and honestly Harry didn’t need this, because any uncertainty on the part of an immortal being could <em> never </em>be considered favourable, not under any circumstances, and-</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And then the moment passed, and the being- Death- Truth- was smiling blindingly again, pearly, sharpened teeth still perfect and still terrifyingly threatening. “You were always meant to come here, Harry. It would never have been anyone else- it could never have been anyone else. You were the only candidate, and the only one who would ever have been successful in reuniting the Hallows,” it looked at him then, as though it was seeing straight into his soul and a strange sort of kindness seemed to spring into those hollow eyes. It spoke again, its soft tone contrasting with the weight of its own damning words. “I suppose you could call it destiny, if you so wished.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I don’t,” Harry’s voice shook. “I don’t want your destiny. It- it doesn’t have to be me. Anyone could have picked them up. Dumbledore, he-” he broke off, tasting salty tears. He touched his face, flinching when his hand came away wet. “Let it be someone else,” he whispered. “For once, <em> please. </em>”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I can’t do that.” Death was silent for a moment, as though allowing him the space to grieve- to <em> grieve, </em> for what he’d lost, for what he was about to lose, but Harry couldn’t find it in himself to be grateful, not for <em> this. </em> “As for your friend?” Its words were still soft, but so, so damnatory. “He never held all three at once. I believe his record was two. The wand and the cloak- oh and then he obtained the ring, didn’t he? But that was after he returned the cloak to you, it’s rightful owner.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I don’t understand.” Harry choked out, fear and sudden anger pulsing through his veins, like an endless, burning pyre. “I don’t understand any of this, because it <em>doesn’t make sense.</em> Why is it me? Why is it always me? Who am I to you, <em>Death?” </em>He was crying now, harsh sobs that came from a place so deep within him, he hadn’t even known it existed. He was bawling, yelling an immortal being that could probably kill him, <em>would </em>probably kill him without a second thought, and yet he couldn’t bring himself to care. “Is this some kind of cosmic joke?” he wasn’t stupid, but just then he couldn’t help but feel it. Like he had half the story, and even then some of the pages were missing- and it didn’t help that the creature standing before him just <em>kept staring</em>, it’s gaze wide and intense, unwavering. “It could have been anyone,” he whispered. “I don’t care what you have to say about that. I know it could have been, so many came close. So <em>you </em>must have intervened. You<em> wanted</em> me to bring you the hallows. I just don’t understand, and-” a flash of realisation came to him, a memory, and he spoke wildly, accusingly. “You- you saved me!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Death stilled completely, something unidentifiable flitting across its expression, before it was gone in the next instant. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I mean,” Harry murmured, hurriedly. “I heard you. Something was going to happen, wasn’t it? Because you told me not to look, and to close my eyes, and then all the pain stopped. Then I was here. It- it was going to be bad, I could feel it, and you protected me. What did you stop me seeing?” a fresh burst of adrenaline surged through him, and he yelled. “Answer me, damn it!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“That is enough.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He shuddered, a strangled sob escaping, unbidden, at the fire behind those three words. With just three words, his own blaze had been quenched, and he was left helpless, hopeless in the face of something far greater than he. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“The truth, Harry, is sometimes too great a burden to bear. It is not one I believe it wise for you to carry. Not right now.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“What’s that supposed to mean?” His voice broke.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Most things you will learn in time,” It spoke as though Harry were a flighty, injured animal. Perhaps, to someone as old and as powerful as Death, that was what he appeared to be. “Some you will never know, for it is not your place to. Perhaps I will show you in time- or perhaps you will find them out for yourself. I <em> cannot </em> give you answers, Harry. Someday, maybe, but <em> that </em> day will not be today.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry sobbed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Hush now.” It looked sorrowful. “Had I not shielded you from the truth, you would have found a part of yourself to be taken. An equivalent exchange. You are right, Harry. There was a reason I saved you, but I did not have an ulterior motive.” It sighed heavily, it’s tone uncharacteristically solemn. “I simply tried to spare you pain.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Tried to <em> spare </em> him <em> pain </em>?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I don’t believe you.” Harry voiced, coldly. “If you cared about <em> that </em>, you wouldn’t have brought me here in the first place.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Believe it or don’t, it doesn’t matter either way,” was the unsatisfactory response. “You are needed elsewhere, it would not be right to keep you from it any longer.” Its humanoid figure moved fluidly towards him until they were standing side by side, and Harry could not tell if it had even been walking at all. “As for your purpose right now? Simply a delivery service. I believe you have something that belongs to me?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry clutched the elder wand in his hand. It felt heavy, as though it wanted nothing more than to simply be let go. He didn’t know where it would go if he did drop it- if the ground beneath his feet would exist for the wand as well. “If I give them to you,” he whispered, acutely aware of the invisibility cloak and the resurrection stone safely tucked into his pockets. “Will you let me go home?” he felt as though this was the end- his last chance, and so he clung with all his might to the weight of his burden, feeling his spirit fall in tandem with his struggling arms. He felt in that moment as though the wind had been knocked out of him, his sails were down, and his body was struggling.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I cannot.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Why?” He crumbled, his shaking legs finally giving way, curling under him as he fell, dazed, to the floor. “You brought me here, Death. Why can’t you send me home?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“When you united my hallows, a bond formed between us. That was what brought you here.” It was the first true answer he’d been given. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You made it so it was I who ended up doing so.” Harry whispered, a feeling of betrayal twisting his empty stomach. “You chose me for this.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The immortal inclined it’s head. “It was vital it be you.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“But you can’t tell me why?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry shook his head, blinding tears tumbling over his reddened cheeks. “I just want to go home.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“That gate is closed,” a freezing touch nearly had him recoiling, and he gasped as he raised his head, eyes drifting to the paper white fingers that gripped his shaking shoulder. “But there is another open for you, Harry James,” it knelt, brushing its other hand softly across Harry’s cheek. “I cannot send you back. You have somewhere else to be. If you are the bearer of my Hallows, then I am your deliverer. To a world in which you are needed. <em> You, </em> Harry James Potter <em> , are their messiah. </em>”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I don’t want to be,” Harry whispered. “I’m sick of saving people.” He could hear the lies fall from his tongue, the lies he almost desperately wished were true. He’d never be able to sit by and just watch as people were hurt, not when he was able to <em> help </em>them, and he knew that Death knew this, that it was exploiting this inherent piece of him, and he hated it for that.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The immortal laughed, high and freezing, but the joke was lost on Harry, and he looked away- away from that pitying, damning stare. “You’ll do it anyway, child.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“And if I don’t?” Harry felt lost, as though he’d just been dropped into an impenetrable, unsolvable maze, and been told to find the way out. “If I refuse?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Death smiled then, a knowing smile that caused his heart to quake with trepidation. “Only you can choose where your path leads, Harry.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It was then that a strange breeze rushed through him, and for a moment he just shook, uncontrollable shivers wracking through his slight frame. Every muscle in his body seemed to tense, spasming wildly before, in rapid succession, unclenching. The elder wand fell from his grasp and then seamlessly, as though it had never been any other way, the being which called itself Death held all three of its Hallows once more.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Come,” It rose fluidly, grasping Harry’s hand in its own and lifting him to his feet. They walked together, towards the stone door, and even as the teenager tried to dig his heels into the ground, to pull back, he found he couldn’t. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The great stone doors began to shift apart, and even through the gaping hole they left, Harry could only see the same expanse of nothingness. It made little sense, but in this place it didn’t seem as though sense mattered. Any meaning this void held was lost on the young wizard, and he was brutally aware that the immortal being beside him understood this completely.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“It’s time.” Death murmured. “Step through, child.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For once, through fear of some stranger alternative, and plain, exhausting defeat, Harry obeyed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And then he was being pulled apart again, torn by invisible hands, and the pain wasn’t any less than the first time- raw and agonising, like flames licking his flesh, and burning through his veins. He didn’t scream this time though, just closed his eyes and let it wash over him, burning hot and cold at once, turning him to ash once again. A puzzle of cosmic dust for the universe to put back together, and when it finally ceased- only then did he allow himself to cry out.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Then he was falling, falling, falling.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He found himself in sands, soft and gritty, and scorching hot in a way that burned his skin, though the pain was nothing compared to the fiery hands that had torn his very being apart. He wasn’t sure how long he lay there, as he stared at a bright blue sky which looked so like his own and yet he knew it couldn't be. Grit fell into his mouth and ears, and his skin felt blistered under the sun’s scorching rays. He choked as coarse grains of sand threatened to flood his lungs, a harsh hacking cough that would have had him doubled over, had he been able to stand, and he vaguely wondered whether this would be the place he was going to die- if Death had gone to all that trouble, only to find a corpse buried in a mountain of sand.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>His vision started to waver as he gasped for breath in a fearful panic. His head was pounding in tandem with his weakening heart, and his ears, already buried in the sand almost missed the shout- a cry of fear and concern, and the pounding of feet that followed soon after.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Someone took his shoulders and pulled, sitting him up, holding his head high above the dunes that threatened to bury him. His vision blurred, and he reached out, grasping the strong hand that replied to his plea. He tilted his head, determined to see the face of his saviour, if only once before he slipped into the unconsciousness threatening to take him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A pair of bright, crimson eyes burned through his darkening vision, before he tumbled into the soft embrace of sleep.</p>
