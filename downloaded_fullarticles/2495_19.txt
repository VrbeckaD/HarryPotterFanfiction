    <p>Newton Artemis Fido Scamander was a big name for someone who was quite small if you asked Newton himself, he prefered to be called Newt thank you very much. Of course he loved his name, his mother had named him after two of her best Hippogriffs and Newt was forever grateful for the names, he took it as a compliment that he shared names with them. </p><p>Despite Newt’s name being Newt his mother always called him ‘Artemis’, he didn’t mind being called that even if it wasn’t his first name. As beautiful as it is it just seemed to regal for him but he never told his mother about how he felt being called ‘Artemis’ all the time except Newt. If he told her it’d break her heart, she’d constantly tell him how blessed he should be to share the same name as a Hippogriff. </p><p>Theseus actually listened to Newt when he had asked his older brother to call him Newt instead of ‘Newton’ claiming how it was far to professional for him, a young boy and someone who just wanted to travel the world and help creatures. Theseus only smiled and ruffled Newt’s already curly, messy red hair making his squawk like one of mother’s Hippogriff babies if their own mothers had pulled a little too hard on a feather. The eldest still used his endearing names for his younger brother like ‘little one’ (Newt was small for his age but Theseus was also tall for his age) and ‘lizard’ was one of Theseus’ favourite, saying how lizard matched his personality and love for creatures, magic or not. (Newt secretly loved the names that Theseus called him, but you mustn’t tell a soul, said older brother would get a big head)</p><p>Newt’s father was a totally different, Newt was just plain old Newton. Nothing more nothing less. Theseus was the one who had nicknames. Theo and Teddy were favorite of their father but those were only used in the home when Theseus had done something well like for instance, getting accepted into Hogwarts and then being accepted into Gryffindor, their father was ecstatic and their mother was proud of the eldest brother. Newt would do the same two years later but be accepted into Hufflepuff, their father wasn’t proud (his mother was proud, saying how he was a perfect Hufflepuff). If anything, he was mad that Newt was in Hufflepuff- apparently the Scamander family had been in Gryffindor for the longest time and now that meant Newt was just an outlier in the family. </p><p>And that was fine, Newt didn’t care if his father didn’t really like him like he liked Theseus. Newt had the injured beasts that often take up space in his room and the Hippogriffs that bow down even before Newt could look them in the eyes, they were enough for Newt and it helps that he’s better at reading beasts than reading humans.</p><p>He could easily read anyone, part of being a Hufflepuff his mother had said, but reading how beasts were feeling were much easier to Newt, they didn’t force him to talk and force him to look people in their eyes. His creatures were understanding on how he really just couldn’t do those things so they all just let him open up to them all on his own accord. Unlike his father who wanted him to be proper at all times, looking people in the eyes was the hardest. </p><p>At Hogwarts no one really liked him, they weren’t hurtful physically (maybe mentally and verbally but that’s another time) they just tended to ignore Newt at all times until herbology and the third years needed help (read forced Newt to do their homework knowing that Newt wouldn’t say anything about it) with their homework. Anyway, when the world in the common room became far too much for Newt to handle he quickly retreated to an old tower just past the courtyard were flying classes were held. There he read books that Theseus gave him from Hogsmeade about creatures, Newt couldn’t count the hours he had spent reading the books and fixing any mistakes he found in the book. There he rehabilitated any creatures that were injured and sometimes said creatures didn’t want to leave him became his friends like the little baby crow he had found injured and without a mother so Newt became the crow’s (whose name was Pira) mother. </p><p>Either way, Newt made his way through Hogwarts with no one bothering him, he was just a shadow and that was perfectly fine with him until Leta Lestrange wormed her way into his life. The Slytherin that was now in his life wasn’t bad, he sorta missed human interaction but she was like him in a way, she wasn’t really welcomed in her house for being a Lestrange whose family was known for practicing black magic. </p><p>The two had met in the old tower where Newt often hides out in when Leta had put a spell on a boy (Newt couldn’t remember his house) because said his was making fun of Leta’s family, Newt didn’t oppose her being there despite her barging into his safe place with his creatures. </p><p>“What is that?” Leta had asked when he saw him hunched over a box that held Pira. </p><p>“A crow,” Newt said softly, not looking up at the girl but he cupped his hands slightly and Pira jumped into his open hands so that he could show Leta the baby crow. “She was injured and I couldn’t find her mum so I’m healing her until she can make it on her own.”</p><p>Leta was quiet for a moment, she had heard about this boy from other students gossiping with one another during classes and meals. The boy on the floor ahead of her was known for being weird and liking animals, not humans. But who was she to judge, she heard rumors of herself practicing dark magic when no one was looking. </p><p>“Oh- I’m Newt Scamander, but you can just call me Newt,” Newt looked up at Leta with a nervous smile despite how he didn’t look her in the eyes, his eyes were trained on everything but her.</p><p>“I’m Leta,” Leta introduced herself but decided to leave out her last name, Newt didn’t really need to know even though the boy might know who she was. </p><p>Newt nodded and that was the end of that conversation and their friendship had only grown until they were in year three and Leta had put a small curse on a group of girls who were harassing Newt and the creature he was currently sheltering with his body (Leta couldn’t remember it). And stupid, self-sacrificing Newt had taken the blame for what Leta had done to the girls and that had caused Newt getting expelled from Hogwarts. Leta and Newt never talked again and Leta felt like she deserved it.</p><p>When Newt had returned home after being expelled he immediately felt how heavy the air was in their small house and when he entered the formal living room he felt everyone’s eyes on him. Theseus and his mother looked at him with sadness, it was obvious that the two of them had hopes for him but all that hope had been broken when an owl came with the letter delivering the bad news. </p><p>His father was just angry and that scared him, he was scared of what his father might do to him. Father surely wouldn’t hurt him? Right? Newt didn’t even give them a chance to yell at him considering how the boy had ran up to his room without a second glance, his heart pounding when he heard fast footsteps following behind him. </p><p>Newt could feel the panic swallow him up as he emptied his suitcase of books he wouldn’t need anymore like all the textbooks and started to put clothes and his wand despite him not being able to use magic (he was underage) and while he ran he could learn magic on his own, he really only needed to learn small charms and maybe potions but getting the potion ingredients would be hard. In the two minutes of being home he decided to run away, he knew that his father wouldn’t do anything to him but one could never be to sure so Newt shoved his chair on the door knob and prayed that no one would barge in. </p><p>Newt took a deep breath, staring at the door and then at the window before quickly opening it and running out into the forest that was behind their land. Newt would be lying to himself if he said he didn’t look back at his old home.</p><p>And if anyone asked if he missed his home years later and he said ‘no’, he was lying again. That was a common occurrence he realized, Newt always lied to hide how he was really feeling. </p><p>It was just easier but hard at the same time.</p>
