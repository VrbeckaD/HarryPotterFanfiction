    <p align="center"><strong> <em>London, England</em> </strong><br/> <strong> <em>Thursday, September 11, 2003</em></strong></p><hr/><p align="left"><br/> Hermione was ten minutes late.</p><p align="left">This was very unusual for her. However, her first meeting of the day was with someone that she was in no rush to meet. She knew that being one minute late was enough to send her into a frenzied panic. Now ten minutes? She might as well take her time. The war heroine stepped onto the road, as the lights on the poles flashed, her head jumbled with her thoughts. The woman felt the odd leftovers of her hangover drumming at the back of her skull as she kept walking to her destination.</p><p align="left"><br/> It was a bleary Thursday morning; the clouds overhead loomed precariously with the promise of rain. Hermione sighed pulling her cloak tighter around herself. She had already drunk through two bottles of expensive wine her parents had gifted her two years ago. And half a bottle of Firewhiskey that Harry had left the last time he was at her place. Hermione cursed silently at her inability to deal with situations head-on anymore.</p><p align="left"><br/> Where was her Gryffindor spirit?</p><p align="left">Her face contorted with a grimace.<br/> That so-called “spirit” was most likely buried beneath the mess that she would call her life.</p><p align="left">As she weaved through the crowd of muggles, Hermione was still lost in her thoughts. She was faintly surprised that her hangover potion was not as potent as it used to be. Seconds later spotted the red phone booth at the junction of Scotland Place and Great Scotland Yard and made a beeline for it. Hermione just wanted to get the day over and done with. Her flat was near the Ministry’s guest entrance, so most days she preferred to walk than Floo.</p><p align="left"><br/> Hermione arrived at her main office that was on Level 5 of the Ministry of Magic and in the Division of Magical Legal Processes. Sitting outside of her office, looking bored and uninterested was the person that she was to meet. Her employees were all curiously watching as she approached the person. Hermione gave no mind to him and walked over to her secretary's circulation desk where a Lisbet Willoughby sat proudly.</p><p align="left"><br/> Hermione approached Lisbet’s desk with a dim smile. “Hey Lis,” she said. “Any messages?”</p><p align="left"><br/> Lisbet’s eyes shifted from the person outside Hermione’s door to Hermione herself. The blonde looked radiant, her green eyes wide with wonder as she greeted Hermione.</p><p align="left"><br/> “You haven’t got any messages,” Lisbet said, her American drawl evident as she spoke. “Only one meeting so far.”<br/> Hermione shot Lisbet a curious look.</p><p align="left"><br/> “Why do you look as if you’re glowing?” Hermione was frowning.</p><p align="left"><br/> Lisbet shrugged, her wavy hair falling over her shoulders. Hermione’s secretary was an excitable American witch that moved from New York City two years ago. She loved muggle movies and gossip. Though, to be fair, Hermione’s whole office loved to gossip. But that was a different story in itself.</p><p align="left"><br/> “We are all dying to know why, Malfoy, is sitting in front of your office,” Lisbet asked, her eyes sparkling.</p><p align="left"><br/> Hermione shot Lis a scathing look and turned away without answering the witch; who was used to not getting replies from her boss. The curly haired woman strode past Malfoy, who had resigned a look of faint interest as Hermione ignored him and wandlessly unlocked her door.</p><p align="left"><br/> “Come in Malfoy,” Hermione called as she walked through her door.</p><p align="left"><br/> Every eye in the office was on the tall, pale, sharp looking Malfoy. It was also peculiar that he was wearing a muggle suit that was showing underneath an expensive cloak. Malfoys were never shy about showing off their wealth. Hermione waited for Malfoy to take a seat, in a stiff manner, before she waved her hand shutting the door. The air was tense as Malfoy looked. He sat in the chair across from Hermione’s desk rigged as a piece of wood. She wondered, offhandedly, if that’s how he always looked now. Hermione wanted to ask him if he ever relaxed.</p><p align="left"><br/> “So.”</p><p align="left"><br/> Malfoy inclined his head at her. She noticed his faint smirk and glared slightly. Damn the Malfoy prat, he wanted her to ask him why he was her appointment. Hermione wrinkled her nose and narrowed her eyes at him. The two former schoolmates stared at each other, neither relenting in their gazes. Hermione blinked and still frowned.</p><p align="left"><br/> “Alright Malfoy,” said Hermione in a strict tone. “What can I help you with.”</p><p align="left"><br/> It came out more forceful than she intended. He was already crawling under her skin and he hadn’t even said anything. Malfoy reached into his cloak, pulled out a tube of rolled parchment, and placed it on Hermione’s desk. His facial expression shifted to a disinterested one. As if he could care less about being there.</p><p align="left"><br/> “Before you start your tirade of accusing me of anything, have a look at that,” he said.</p><p align="left"><br/> Hermione reached for the parchment and unfurled it; careful to make sure he hadn’t cursed it. It was a foot and a half long and there was a contract written on it. The script on the parchment was very wispy, following the trademark Ministry of Magic handwriting, and Hermione could feel the magic seeping from it.</p><p align="left"><br/> <strong><em>Ministry of Magic</em></strong><br/> <strong> <em>Magical Contract: Department of Mysteries</em></strong></p><p align="left"><br/> Hermione’s eyebrows shot straight up. She raised her wand hand and waved it in the air while her eyes traced the parchment, she had cast a Muffliato Charm. Malfoy eyed her differently at the second use of wandless magic. He had known that Granger was well versed in wandless magic, he just didn’t know to which extent. Wandless magic was only so rare because most wizards did not have excellent control over their magic; many people were sloppy at best. Malfoy was proud of his control, but he shouldn’t have been too surprised that Hermione also had excellent control.</p><p align="left"><br/> Hermione, on the other hand, gripped the contract firmer in her hand. The contract stated that Malfoy was to be the Department of Mysteries’ on call Healer. It also stated that he was to do rounds in the offices twice a week.<br/> Kingsley's magical signature was signed at the bottom, along with Malfoy’s regal signature. There was also space for her to sign next to the title, Head of the Department of Mysteries. Hermione placed the parchment on her desk and looked at Malfoy.</p><p align="left"><br/> “Since when have you been a qualified Healer,” said Hermione, failing to keep her tone non-accusatory. “Especially for the Department of Mysteries?”</p><p align="left">Draco scowled, his eyes narrowing and mouth twisting downward.“I have been studying in Greece for two years with one of the top Healers in the world,” said Draco. Hermione noted the rough tone of annoyance. “I have also been working at St. Mungo’s as of January of last year.”</p><p align="left"><br/> As far as Hermione knew, there hadn’t been any news that Malfoy had been back in the country; much less working at the Wizarding hospital. Interestingly enough Malfoy seemed to understand her facial expression of near disbelief.</p><p align="left"><br/> “Kingsley noticed that I was able to evade any mention in the Daily Prophet,” he continued. “So, he offered me this side job. The Minister said that there were frequent accidents in the department and that his signature was to serve as a witness.”</p><p align="left"><br/> Hermione felt her ears go pink and frowned. “Our research is…” she paused leveling her eyes with Malfoy’s. “Peculiar.”</p><p align="left"><br/> “I’m well aware, Granger,” he drawled. “Just sign the bloody paper and I won’t need to see your tasteless mug until next week.”</p><p align="left"><br/> Hermione clenched her jaw; she narrowed her eyes dangerously at Malfoy. Usually, the Minister never intruded in anything that the Department of Mysteries did since their department was a special case… But Hermione trusted Shacklebolt enough to be able to abide by his appointments.</p><p align="left"><br/> “Have you no manners?” Hermione said. “Here I thought we were almost civil.”</p><p align="left"><br/> Draco shrugged, almost relaxing into the chair. He didn’t reply. Hermione examined him and then the parchment. She knew that if she signed it, it would be binding since it was a magical contract. Chewing on her lip she felt her steely resolve crumble. They really did need a Healer on reserve.</p><p align="left"><br/> “Fine.”</p><p align="left"><br/> Hermione signed her name on the parchment and watched it glow a wispy purple. The parchment rose up from her grasp and popped out of existence, most likely sent to the Ministry’s secret archives in the Department of Mysteries.</p><p align="left"><br/> “If there is nothing else, I’m leaving,” said Malfoy.</p><p align="left"><br/> He stood up and stalked out of her office, her door slamming so hard that her portraits and items in her office shook violently.</p><hr/><p align="center"><br/> <strong><em>Later that evening...</em></strong><br/> <strong> <em>The Leaky Cauldron</em></strong></p><p align="center"> </p><p align="left"><br/> “It’s not like he waltzed in there and cursed you.”</p><p align="left"><br/> Ginny Weasley watched Hermione closely, who was almost through her second glass of Firewhiskey.</p><p align="left"><br/> “Bloody felt like it,” Hermione all but spat out.</p><p align="left"><br/> Ginny’s eyebrow twitched and she waved her wand at Hermione’s Firewhiskey, replacing it with water.</p><p align="left"><br/> “O-kay! I believe it’s time for some water,” the red-headed girl said. “You need to sober up and think rationally.”</p><p align="left"><br/> “Ginny!” There was nearly a whine in Hermione’s voice. “It was so hard keeping my composure.”</p><p align="left"><br/> “I’m sure it wasn’t,” Ginny said dryly. She was well aware of Hermione’s pension for exaggerating things after drinking Firewhiskey and how whiny she got. “It’s not like you will see him every day. You’re also the person that is least likely to get hurt up in you-know-where.” (Ginny was casually mentioning Hermione’s technical side-job.)</p><p align="left"><br/> Hermione covered half of her face with one hand and groaned inwardly. Her familiar alcohol-induced headache was starting. She stood up suddenly; a dizzying feel swept her up, and she grabbed her cloak unceremoniously.</p><p align="left"><br/> “I’m going home,” said Hermione. She dropped a few Sickles and Knuts on the table.</p><p align="left"><br/> Ginny nodded, arms crossed protectively in front of her. “I think it’s best. Go and get some rest ‘Mione.”</p><p align="left"><br/> Hermione managed a grimace of a smile and left the pub.</p><p align="left"><br/> Ginny watched Hermione’s retreating back with a frown. Her friend was always worrying and she had double the work most days. Ginny sighed; she was confused as to why Hermione felt so out of touch. The curly haired girl was not acting her usual self, she seemed more doleful lately and snappish. Ginny place some money on the table and swung on her own cloak. She waved to the bartender and walked out onto the cobblestone path of Diagon Alley.</p><p align="left"><br/> A chilly breeze swept through the nearly deserted alley, as Ginny ventured toward the Apparition point. The breeze held the promise of autumn as it kicked up dry leaves and Ginny’s cloak. Ginny shook her head.</p><p align="left">Hermione was an adult; there was no reason to worry too much. Right?</p><hr/><p align="center"><br/> <strong><em>Hermione’s flat</em></strong></p><p align="left"><br/> Hermione had placed a muggle movie in the DVD player and grabbed another bottle of wine. She had changed into her pajamas after a lukewarm shower and settled onto her sofa. Hermione felt fuzzy headed because she had drunk half of the wine bottle. She could still feel the raging emotions course through her as she thought of Malfoy. Hermione lifted the wine bottle up to her lips again and gulped almost all of it.</p><p align="left">She placed it on the coffee table with force. It wasn’t their conversation that bothered her; it was the fact that he looked unscathed. Malfoy’s porcelain skin glowing healthily and he still was able to carry himself with pride. She felt a surge of bubbled up emotion in her chest that made her stomach do cold flips.</p><p align="left"><br/> Envy.</p><p align="left"><br/> What Hermione was feeling was envy. She cursed and fell back onto her sofa, clutching a pillow tightly. Staring at the ceiling, the world around her seemed to be swimming as she groaned aloud. All the years of taunting, resentment, suspicion, and frustration ate away at Hermione. Her eyes trailed to the nearly empty wine bottle.</p><p align="left"><br/> Her flat was only illuminated by the telly, which was still running the movie. It cast shadows on her face as her thoughts trailed elsewhere. The woman wasn’t sure when her habit of drinking had started. All she knew was that it helped her not dream and didn’t make her feel out of touch with her body. (Unlike if, she drank the Potion for Dreamless Sleep.) She had an inkling the War had triggered it and her work surely did not help.</p><p align="left"><br/> Not wanting to think anymore, Hermione <em>accio’d</em> a soft blanket and stretched out on her sofa. Her cat, Crookshanks noticed Hermione drifting off into a fitful sleep and curled up at her feet.</p><hr/><p align="left"> </p><p align="center"><em> <strong>Saturday, September 13, 2003</strong> </em><br/> <em> <strong> Hermione’s Main Office, MOM Level 5</strong> </em><br/> <em> <strong>Division of Magical Legal Processes</strong> </em></p><p><br/> Hermione sighed for the billionth time.</p><p><br/> Idly, she also wondered when her pension for sighing began. She was working on a case for one of her top clients and she was trying to make sure everything was in order for a small court meeting with a judge or two from the Wizengamot. These were low-level cases but they were important, that’s why Hermione formed the Department of Magical Legal Processes. She knew there were some people she had to fight for because they couldn’t do it themselves.<br/> From the mail slot in her door, a folded up memo whooshed in. It landed swiftly on the desk, unfurling from the paper airplane it resembled. Hermione put down her quill and picked it up.</p><p>
  <em>Ms. Granger,<br/> Please come to Level 9.</em>
</p><p>Hermione drew up her hair and circled it into a bun on the top of her head; she then grabbed her wand, muttered a Sticking Charm, and for flair, secured her bun with her wand. She glanced at her watch as she flicked her hand out to make sure to summon important documents she’d need. It was a bit past 7 o'clock as Hermione’s things floated into her bag and as she made her way to the lift across from her Department. She pressed the button and tapped her foot impatiently as she waited.</p><p><br/> The air was cool it nipped at her bare forearms as Hermione trekked to her actual office. Her robes and cloak billowed out behind her as she turned left from the lift. The candles in the corridors glowed healthy amber, lighting up the doors that lined the walls every few paces. Hermione paused in front of a door with a golden plaque that read <em>H.J.G</em>. and nothing more.</p><p>She placed her hand on the door handle and waited. The door handle glowed a soft red and the door opened and Hermione stepped inside. Hermione’s office was bigger than she had anticipated once Kingsley had assigned it to her. It had a large window that overlooked the city of London, her desk sat in the far left corner with two massive bookshelves that made an L shape behind her desk. Off to the back right was a long table and cupboards and in front of her desk was a sofa with a coffee table. She was also glad that the sofa was across from a large fireplace that gave her precious heat in the cold winter months. Hermione set her bag down at her desk and eyed the parcel suspiciously.</p><p><br/> On the long table was a parcel, it was about 7 centimeters all the way around. It was wrapped in plain brown paper and there was a letter next to it.<br/> Hermione finally ignored the parcel and yanked open the letter.</p><p><em>Ms. Granger,</em><br/> <em>In this parcel, you will find an old Time Turner. Our research is suggesting that it belonged to a Death Eater but they messed with it so much, that it is dangerously cursed. I am advising extreme caution. Please restore it if possible. If not destroy it. Time Turners are now extremely valuable and I am aware that you understand how they work.</em><br/> <em>Please keep me updated.</em><br/> <em>Minister of Magic,</em><br/> <em>Kingsley Shacklebolt</em></p><p>Hermione set down the letter and slowly opened the parcel. She stared at the Time Turner that she had pulled out of the box. It looked like a regular Time Turner, nothing to differentiate itself. Except as soon as Hermione touched it, she knew, that Kingsley wasn’t warning her for laughs. The magic that seeped from it reeked of Dark Magic. She set it down carefully, scrunching up her nose in the process.</p><p><br/> “Of course it would be a Time Turner,” said Hermione grumbling to herself, as she let her index finger run over the spines of books on her towering bookshelf.</p><p><br/> The bookshelves in Hermione’s office reached the ceiling. On these bookshelves were every type of book one could ever dream of. Hermione at one point chuckled thinking that Madam Pince would blanch at the subjects she had on her shelf; half of them were on Dark Magic and ways to extinguish it. She pulled out several books and levitated them to the table in front of her mini sofa.<br/> She threw herself onto the sofa and pulled a dusty old book onto her lap, coughing and waving away the dust that clung to the book like a leech.</p><p><br/> It was going to be a long night.</p>
