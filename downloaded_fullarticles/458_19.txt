          <div class="userstuff"><p>Ginny gasped as Harry finally pushed into her. The push and pull of their combined bodies was heaven, she’d been looking forward to this feeling ever since she stepped off the Hogwarts Express earlier that day. </p><p>She’d had to wait though. She had waited through the long drive home to the Burrow, waited through family dinner, waited until her Mum fell asleep to write a quick letter and then apparate to Grimmauld Place, willing to deal with her Mother’s wrath in the morning. </p><p>Harry made love to her so sweetly that she almost cried. He treated her body like a temple, worshiping her and treating her like a goddess. She felt love for him traveling through her veins, as he thrust into her, she wrapped an arm around his shoulder, and whispered “I love you.” into his ear. He kissed her softly, he was never rough with her, always delicate and caring. </p><p>Harry cried out his release, emptying himself into her. She delighted in the feeling, crying out with him and following him down mere seconds after. He pulled out of her and lay down next to her, she placed her head on his chest and smiled. “Thank you.” she whispered. Harry kissed the top of her head and wrapped his arms around her in response. They fell asleep like that, naked, sated, exhausted and wrapped up in post-coital bliss.</p></div>
