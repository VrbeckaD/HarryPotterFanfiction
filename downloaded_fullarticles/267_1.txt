    <p>Harry brought down the pair of omnioculars from his eyes to get a real time view of the quidditch match going on in front of him. Despite the handiness of the pair of magic binoculars, the fact that they allowed the user to watch what was happening in slow motion meant that the user would not be up to speed with what was going on in the "present". Harry caught a quick glimpse of an Irish chaser netting the quaffle as the sea of green in the crowd of the world cup roared joyously. Ron Weasley, standing beside his best mate was absorbed in every moment of the action, eyes darting from player to player and quaffle to bludger. The second that Ron realized that Ireland had taken a ten point lead, he was grabbing onto Harry's shoulders, shaking them vigorously in joy while jumping up and down.</p><p>"Hell yeah! That's how we bloody do it!" Ron shouted.</p><p>Harry was unperturbed by the shaking and shouting and joined in, cheering his lungs out with Ron and the rest of the Weasley family. The fast paced action continued and it wasn't long before Bulgaria had netted a goal to tie up the score. Harry and the rest of the Weasleys went back to being absorbed by the action unfolding before them, cheering at the success of green while booing anything the Bulgarians managed to pull off against the superior Irish team, though Ron was booing a lot more halfheartedly than the others.</p><p>"Krummy boy's gotta find the snitch soon!" said George with a grin, standing behind both Harry and Ron, resting his weight on their shoulders using his elbows.</p><p>"Are you thick in the head Fred, Ireland's up one hundred and sixty points, they won't win if he catches the snitch now!" stated Ron confidently right before catching a slap on the backside of the head by the other Weasley twin.</p><p>"I'm Fred you twit, merlin knows how you're related to us with that brain of yours Ronny boy" chuckled Fred all the while still keeping an eye on the happenings going on in the air.</p><p>Ron rubbed the back of his head "either way, he can't catch the snitch now, they won't win like that" he said.</p><p>"Well, their chances of winning are negative five hundred anyway, Krum might as well get the snitch highlight and save his team from any more embarrassment" said George confidently.</p><p>"Come on, no way he's gonna do that!" chimed in Harry. As if on queue, Krum was plummeting towards a golden glint towards the corner of the pitch and the crowd held its collective breath.</p><p>"What a match, what a match! Did you see him soar, that man's part eagle I tell you!" Ron exclaimed.</p><p>He was lying on his bed, Krum figurine in hand as he threw it in the air and caught it. Harry was sitting across from him, on the bed opposite. "You know, I think someone's in love" the boys turned to door to see Hermione and Ginny entering the room.</p><p>"You wouldn't understand Hermione, you're not really a quidditch-head" Ron replied, sitting up and smiling.</p><p>"Well I'm a quidditch-head Ronald, and if I didn't know any better I would say everytime you see Krum you get a har- " Ginny was saying before she was interrupted by the sound of singing entering the room.</p><p>"Victor I love you, I'm falling aparttt-'' sang the Weasley twins as they entered the room.</p><p>"You've stolen the snitch, now you've stolen my hearttt" Harry joined in with the Weasley twins' chorus.</p><p>Everyone in the room was now laughing as Fred and George walked up to Harry, fist bumping him before diving on to their beds to lay down after the celebrations. The sounds of the Irish celebrating could still be heard from outside, as firecrackers and celebratory spells were set off. Ron was now explaining the intricacies of the Wronski feint performed by Krum to a bored looking Ginny and Hermione while the twins were now grappling over a piece of candy they had found under one of the beds that came with their magical tent.</p><p>Reminded of the Wronski Feint, Harry decided it would be one hell of a maneuver to add to his repertoire for the upcoming year. Quidditch was always one of Harry's favorite parts about the Hogwarts' school year, after having become the youngest seeker in a century in his first year. Remembering he had recorded the majority of the match on his omniculars, he decided to pull it out to observe the feint in slow motion and really break it down. As he was watching the footage, he realized that he didn't have a good angle of the move at all as his omniculars had been hanging from the strap around his neck at the time. What a shame, he thought to himself as he was about to lower the omnioculars from his eyes. That was when he noticed something in the frame he had not noticed before. There was Lucius Malfoy sitting with his son Draco to the right of where Harry and the Weasleys had been sitting. That however wasn't the part that caught Harry's attention. He had been well aware of the Malfoy family during the match. The interesting part was what Harry was able to glimpse going on behind them. A boy, no older than 15 with blondish-brown hair coming to his ears, and celtic green paint all over his face and shirtless body was concentrated on something, wand in hand and tongue out. As Harry looked closely, he could see the bag of one Lucius Malfoy that had been placed beside him slowly start to shift backwards. The boy grabbed the bag casually, throwing the strap around his shoulder and starting to celebrate as the snitch that had just been caught by Krum, all the while slowly shifting his way out of the box that held the Malfoys and the Weasleys. Soon he was out of frame, with Lucius Malfoy none the wiser about his bag having been stolen in the heat of the quidditch match. Harry had to give it up to the boy, he had managed to pull a heist right under the nose of the Malfoy patriarch while the crowd was absorbed by the happenings of the match. But how had he been able to use magic outside of school, there was no way the boy was seventeen, at least it didn't look like it to Harry. He lowered the omnioculars from his face.</p><p>"Nah but listen, what are we going to school for if they're just gonna tell us to go learn the material at home." Ron explained, trying his best to convince Hermione of the reasoning behind not doing any of the summer homework they had been assigned.</p><p>Ginny was now trying to yank the Weasley twins apart as they continued their scuffle over assumably the piece of candy from earlier.</p><p>"Hey guys!" said Harry as everyone turned to look at him, even the twins freezing mid wrestle.</p><p>"At the match-" Harry tried to explain before someone suddenly burst through the door and everyone turned to see who it was.</p><p>"EVERYONE, FOLLOW ME NOW!" came the voice from Bill Weasley standing at the door, wand in hand and a grim look on his face. Everyone, understanding that something serious was going on, stood up to follow Bill.</p><p>"What's going on Bill?" asked George as he straightened out his shirt and his face hardened into a serious look.</p><p>The two words that came from Bill's mouth brought a look of horror to everyone's faces, well everyone's except Harry's who felt out of the loop about what exactly they was going on.</p><p>"Death Eaters!".</p>
