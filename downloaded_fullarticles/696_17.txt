    <p>Draco Malfoy, heir to all the Malfoy affects, was expected to marry a beautiful pureblood witch and produce a grandchild. This dream of his parents was quickly ended when he admitted an attraction to males; he was figuring out what this would mean to the family before he was sent off to Durmstrang. Our story begins there with Malfoy.<br/>
Draco was just waking up to start his day when Karkaroff, the headmaster, bursted into his room with Krum trailing behind. "Malfoy get up. You and Krum are to be dressed in ten minutes. Once ready gather others, we sail to Hogwarts at noon." Draco nods standing up from the bed and dressing in his formal attire. Krum motions him to follow as he leaves Draco's room. "We grab the older ones. Leave the children here." Draco sighs, "I know Viktor. The kids will be useless to us." Krum laughed rounding the last of them up before leading them to the ship.<br/>
-at Hogwarts around 5pm-<br/>
Harry enters the Great Hall with Hermione and Ron. They sit at their usual seats as Dumbledore steps up to the podium. "We have the greatest honor of holding the Triwizard Tournament here this year. As such let me introduce our first visitors, Durmstrang!" The doors are flung open as Karkaroff storms in, his caped students following quietly behind. Harry watches them enter, this is the first time stormy gray meets avada kedavra green.<br/>
When Draco and Harry's eyes met again its the day the goblet announced the opponents, champions. Krum's name is spit out last out of the three houses, everyone assumes the goblet was finished. They all went silent in shock as another burnt slip of paper flutters out. Dumbledore grasps it in his hand as he reads the slip. His face goes pale as he calls out, "HARRY POTTER!" Harry's eyes widen in fear, his eyes connecting with Draco who is watching him with a gleam of curiosity. Harry cautiously stands going to the front as the Great Hall stays completely silent.<br/>
-after the first task-<br/>
With the Yule Ball only a day away Draco goes to Harry. He walks up to him as Ron is there complaining. With little effort he gains Harry's attention. A blush graces Harry's face as Draco asks "Will you go with me to the ball Harry?" Harry smiles brightly even as Ron scoffs. "Yes Draco, I would love to." Draco smirks looking into Harry's vibrant eyes. "I can't wait to see you on the night Harry." He kisses Harry's lips lightly before walking away.<br/>
The night of the ball was magical for Harry and Draco. They danced and talked the night away never once leaving the others side. Everything was perfect before Ron began having a go at Hermione. Harry rushed over to protect Hermione from Ron's words, "If you wanted to go with her then you should've asked first! It's not her fault you're oblivious!" Ron glares at him doubling back with his own quip "At least I didn't cheat my way into the goblet!" before leaving. Draco came to his crying beautiful Harry and held him in the gryffindor common room all night.<br/>
-two weeks after-<br/>
The day of the second task Harry can't find Draco anywhere. He searches everywhere until it's too late; he gets all but dragged to the lake so as to complete his task. Harry swallows down gillyweed given to him before diving into the lake in search of something taken. He swims until he starts to see people floating in the water. As he gets closer Harry realises that Draco is in the water! He rushes towards him cutting away the seaweed holding him before swimming him up to the surface. As they pop to the top Draco opens his eyes gasping for air. They hold onto each other as they swim to shore. Upon getting there Harry pulls Draco into his lap as the teachers cover them in towels. Draco smiles laying against Harry's chest.<br/>
-after the tournament-<br/>
The last time they see each other for years is when Draco boarded the ship to Durmstrang. Harry won the Tournament but how could he be in the celebrating mood? Cedric had died in front of his eyes. Draco held him from behind, as Harry relaxed in his arms he spoke. "Owl me Harry." Draco got this out before Harry turned too him crashing their lips together. Krum yells for Draco causing them to pull away. Harry watches Draco enter the ship, a tear slipping down his face as the ship leaves.<br/>
-five years later-<br/>
After Hogwarts, Durmstrang, and the Wizard War Harry finally felt safe. He owled Draco again after a year of silence. When Draco got the owl he burst into tears. Not a day later he went to meet his Harry. Walking into Honeydukes Draco's eyes connected with those gorgeous vibrant green before being crashed into. Harry held him close as they both cried at feeling each other again. Draco vowed then never to let go of his Harry. That summer Harry married Draco in the backyard of Hermione Weasley. It was simple, for Harry, and elegant, for Draco. They took the name Potter-Malfoy to keep both lines from dying.<br/>
A month into the marriage Draco found a potion for pregnancy. After showing Harry he took it and nine months later they welcomed two little boys into the world. They named their boys Severus James Potter-Malfoy and Remus Orion Potter-Malfoy.<br/>
Draco Potter-Malfoy proved his parents wrong that day. It wasn't a pureblood female he needed; He was capable to carry an heir and all he needed was his Harry the entire time. </p><p>949 words</p>
