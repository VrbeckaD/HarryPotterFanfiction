    <p>
  <span>Petunia Evans had lived her whole life so far, or at least since age eight or so, with one goal: to be as normal as possible. To blend in with the most neutral of crowds until she would never have to worry about standing out, and the way she walked, the way she talked, the way she existed would come naturally as perfectly average. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>This may have seemed like a strange choice for such a young girl to make, but a view inside the Evans household would make everything clear. Mr. and Mrs. Evans had been perfectly normal for years, with him working a rather good job in sales and her having become a school teacher as soon as her daughters were old enough not to need her constant care. The daughters went to a rather nice school in London, St. Mary’s, and everything went quite normally.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They would rise for school in the morning, Petunia generally taking the initiative of waking her sister so that the younger girl wouldn’t sleep right through first hour, and they would take the school bus at exactly seven-forty-five and get to school at eight o’clock for the eight-fifteen bell. They went through their day, meeting again to eat lunch at the same table, and then ride the same bus home at two-fifteen, where they would watch the telly until Mrs. Evans got home at three-thirty and made them work on their course work.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Petunia had loved it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Then everything changed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Suddenly Lily was making strange things happen. Their teacher’s hair turned blue as soon as Lily was upset at her, toys would float around their house, the strange boy down the street taught her how to make flowers blossom and reverse in her palm. And suddenly, their family was no longer normal.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Mr. and Mrs. Evans, with their deep love all things that were interesting and quirky, latched on to the idea of magic or magical powers, impressed above all that their lovely daughter was blessed with them. Their perfect, gorgeous, magical daughter. In their eyes, the girl could do no wrong. And at first, Petunia had been the same way. She was amazed, if a bit envious, of her sister’s abilities, and was all too ready to help her develop them. She had dreams of helping her sister achieve her dreams while she achieved her own, and when Lily came home from doing whatever her magic thing was, she would hug her older sister and they would sit down with tea to talk about everything.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>All that happened in reality was that, suddenly, the girls’ parents couldn’t give their older child the time of day. It was always Lily, Lily, Lily, no matter what. Hell, the only times they really even talked to Petunia was to tell her about the amazing things Lily had done that day. Things which Petunia already knew about as it was. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>But Lily sucked it all up like a sponge, every ounce of their parents approval and affection and favoritism, even if they would never admit it. She waltzed around like every place was her castle, and, just like all the kings and queens they learned about in history class, forgot about the peasants she left in the dust. And even so, even with everything she had at home, she spent all her time with the boy down the road, because </span>
  <em>
    <span>he</span>
  </em>
  <span> had magic, too- magic Petunia couldn’t have.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When they were at school, Lily was known for the strange things she did, and though some revered her for it, most just found it a bit strange. Lily, too tied up with that boy, was oblivious to it all, as the children who didn’t find her powers god-given were a bit better at subtlety. But Petunia noticed. She noticed that she was known as the sister of the strange girl, and that, as much as she tried to stand up for her sister, over and over, Lily would never do the same for her, not even when that boy had dropped a rather sizeable tree branch on her head. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Petunia didn’t like this new routine one bit. It was unpredictable, unfair, and unrelatable to other children- the furthest thing from normal she could imagine. She never knew what was coming next in this type of life, and the only constant was the rejection from her parents and her classmates. She was overcome with a longing for the </span>
  <em>
    <span>normal</span>
  </em>
  <span>, the common, the type of beauty that everyone saw and the type of ugliness everyone went through together.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>So, with all the certainty of the eight year old girl she was, she decided that she would do something else with her time, something worthwhile. She wasn’t certain enough to give up her own passions or success, but she was certain enough to be average at the strange things, and good at the normal things.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She went to school with a new vigor and got good grades, even better than before- good enough to stand out at a normal thing, but not good enough to be strange. Once she stopped forcing her relationship with her sister, it faded to nearly nonexistent, and she let it. The other children didn’t pick on her anymore, and she found some rather nice and quite smart but overall average friends to do perfectly normal nice things with. They would talk about their lives and school and tell silly jokes and go ice skating in winter and go to the park in the summer and have normal types of fun that she could tell other people about.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She kept up her love of reading, and the friends she had found shared that love, and so, to them, she was still perfectly normal. She got better at riding her bike and swimming in the lake until she was passably average in every normal activity, and when Lily came home from her stupid special school, Petunia would do her best to never be home. Because normal children didn’t just stay home all the time in the summer, and normal children didn’t talk about their sibling’s magic. She had transferred with her friends to St. Margaret’s for girls for secondary school, and it was all too easy to give a vague explanation that she didn’t get along too well with her family, and suddenly she didn’t have to be around as her parents gushed to her about how perfect Lily was, and Lily gushed about her weird school and the weird subjects they took.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Petunia wasn’t weird. She simply didn’t belong with Lily anymore. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She got into quite a few universities and chose the good but average one from which she was offered a scholarship, and split her major between business and English, figuring it was most important to be able to find a job, but almost as important to learn what she loved. When she graduated, she settled in a pretty but average townhouse that looked just like all the others on the street, and decorated it exactly as she saw in her friends’ and neighbors’ houses. She worked a well paying but perfectly average secretarial job at a pleasant company, and she dated the nice but average men she met around town or knew from school.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She knew she would never be </span>
  <em>
    <span>perfect</span>
  </em>
  <span> and </span>
  <em>
    <span>special</span>
  </em>
  <span> like Lily, but she could be normal. She could be perfectly, specially normal, the way Lily would never get to. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>In that way, it was the only thing her sister would never get to have. With her magic, she would always be special, and she would always be- and feel- superior in a world of people without it. In her world, she would still never experience that beautiful anonymity, not when she was drop dead gorgeous, top of her class, and married to a member of the magical one percent.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Petunia had latched onto that feeling of perfect normality, and she still hadn't let go. She had given up a long time ago on trying to one-up her sister- even in such a roundabout way- but that didn't mean she had forgotten her entire childhood.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>So now, when her sister arrived at her door, announcing that her daughter hadn't accomplished as much by age one as her son and therefore had no place in her home, Petunia wished desperately to hate the little girl. Just like her mother, this one was. Another Evans girl with the magic she herself would never have. She’d probably grow up to be as self-centered as her mother, not to mention as beautiful, if the carbon copy of Lily’s eyes were anything to go by. And yet...</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She felt a sort of connection to the child. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>That wasn’t to say she was in any way enthusiastic, however. Petunia didn't want a child. She had never wanted any. That was the one part of her plan that she would never change, even for the sake of normality. Children were just… ugh. They were loud, and they cried all the time and spit up all over everything, and Petunia would have sworn that if she was ever seen near a child that she had been replaced by a government agent.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But her sister was giving the child up. Her little, perfect sister saw this girl and wanted to give her away. She would keep her son, but get rid of her daughter. It was appalling!</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Petunia didn’t quite understand the situation. Lily had given her no prior information- in fact, they hadn’t spoken in years- and what she had told her now was as confusing as it was vague. All she had gotten from Lily and James’s ramblings was that their son, Oliver, had defeated… </span>
  <em>
    <span>someone</span>
  </em>
  <span>, and he was the most famous person in their version of Britain. He was to be hailed as some sort of hero, and this meant that they had no room in their home (or their hearts, thought Petunia bitterly) for their daughter.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was a sort of kinship that came with rejection. When she looked at the baby girl in the little carrier, she couldn't help but see herself. She had to wonder if Lily saw any connection to their own past, but she doubted it. It was hard to see the struggles of others when you were the one on top.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"So…?" came Lily's expectant tone, breaking her from her thoughts.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Petunia shook her head to clear her mind. "Fine," she said finally. "I'll raise her. You'll be back for her when she's thirteen so she can go to </span>
  <em>
    <span>your</span>
  </em>
  <span> school, you say?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lily nodded, James doing the same while adding, "Assuming she is a witch."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Petunia frowned and set her coffee down. "You don't know?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Well, no," Lily admitted, glancing around uncertainly. "I mean, there's no reason to believe she'd be a squib, but obviously there's always a chance. Oliver’s done accidental magic, of course, but she hasn’t, though that’s entirely normal for a child so young."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"So, if she's not?" Petunia asked. "If she's not a witch? When she turns thirteen, will you be here?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James and Lily shared a rather lost look, as though this was something they had never thought of, which stirred a feeling in Petunia that was almost offended. Perhaps she had expected more planning, more details, from someone giving up their child. Perhaps she had expected that such a huge decision would involve consideration of every factor, every thought out hypothetical, every single piece of the puzzle assembled before taking such a huge step. Perhaps she had simply assumed incorrectly. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I suppose we'll have to see how things are in our world," James stumbled over eventually.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Petunia raised a brow slightly toward her sister.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"It would be very dangerous for her if she is a squib," Lily rushed to explain. "Being so close to her brother, what with the reporters, and I'm sure the attacks, and it would be dangerous around Oliver to have that type of liability-"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was only years of hiding her emotions that kept Petunia from flinching as if she had been physically struck. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her own baby, a liability? Sure, she could kind of see why it would be dangerous; apparently there would be very angry, very deadly people coming after Oliver, and she wouldn't have the magic to protect herself. But little Oliver wouldn't be able to protect himself against terrorists either, so what would really be the difference? </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Luckily, it seemed that Lily had also realized she was better off not continuing that line of thought.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Petunia smiled tightly and turned to the baby girl in her little carrier, the safest option in the room as she found herself unable to bear looking at her sister. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Liability</span>
  </em>
  <span>. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Honestly</span>
  </em>
  <span>.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Hello, little one," she said softly. "I'm your Auntie Petunia."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The baby just giggled, reaching out a tiny hand to the sharp woman. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her smile came naturally this time. "You want up?" she asked, holding out her arms. She lifted the little girl onto her hip, wincing as she immediately knotted her tiny fingers into her locks.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James, who had begun fidgeting with his sweater quite some time ago, spoke up. "If that's all…"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Petunia met his gaze. "We haven't yet discussed child support. I'm barely out of university," she added, glancing between their confused and indignant expressions. "Maybe it works differently in your world, but I don't have the money or even the opportunity for the money to raise this child properly. I don't plan to leave her alone all day while I work three jobs."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>That certainly wouldn’t appear normal to her friends and colleagues. Actually, none of this would. She groaned internally. God, how was she ever to explain this?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"No, no, of course not," Lily agreed, sending a sharp glance at her husband. "Five thousand monthly?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"</span>
  <em>
    <span>Galleons</span>
  </em>
  <span>?" James burst, his eyes bugging out.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Pounds," Lily replied, rolling her eyes fondly. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"That's like…?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Four hundred and eighty galleons," she answered after brief calculation. James nodded.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"That works for me. I suppose I won't be receiving a check?" she couldn't help but sneer.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I can set you up a vault at Gringotts- that's our bank," James offered. "I can just transfer five hundred galleons a month to it. You can come by Diagon and get it exchanged. The Goblins don't charge for exchanges."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"It's that </span>
  <em>
    <span>hard</span>
  </em>
  <span> to just send a check?" she sighed, resigned to the wizard’s inevitable answer.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"The Potter estate has enough vaults to manage as it is, I don't need one at a Muggle bank," James sneered back.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Then I want five hundred of your ridiculous coins," she decided. It was nonnegotiable. If he wanted to be as much of a pain her arse as possible, she could at least make sure it cost him. "I'll be visiting your bank within the next few days then; I'll have to set up a nursery and all that," Petunia announced, keeping her tone professional so that she wouldn't snap.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Of course."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Petunia stood, signifying the end of that particular meeting. Her sister and her husband seemed all too grateful to get out of her </span>
  <em>
    <span>normal</span>
  </em>
  <span> house.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Now what to do with you, you little brat?” she murmured, a smile peeking out through her thoughtful frown.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And the baby began to cry.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh goddammit,” she cursed. “I need Yvonne.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The good thing about being perfectly average was that many of her perfectly average friends had taken the traditional route and settled down with husbands and babies in little white picket fence type houses not too far from where she lived. They would know what to do with the baby. At least she had a place to start.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Grabbing her phone off the kitchen counter with her free hand, as the other was attempting to rock a baby to sleep, she dialed her friend. “Yvonne?” she said, as soon as the other woman picked up. “I need you to come over. No, it’s a rather long story. A funny one, too, I’m sure, or it will be in five or ten or a hundred years…”</span>
