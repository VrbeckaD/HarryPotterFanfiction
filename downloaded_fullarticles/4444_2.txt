    <p>Is Dumbledore the Headmaster/Dean here or just a really old guy who make a hobby out getting a new degree every few years?</p><p>McGonagall is a professor, always.</p><p>Ooh, maybe Newt is around somewhere teaching a class or two in between writing a book and going off on expeditions (Charlie and Tonks go with him as students <strike>and maybe Hagrid is an assistant??</strike>) to study creatures.</p><p>Are we talking full on college dorms? Like each House has their own dorm building?</p><p>And someone mentioned everyone lives, so is Harry going to college with his parents also? Because that’d be hilarious if his parents are around trying to be cool and just embarrassing him.</p><p>But the biggest question of all:</p><p><b><i>Is there magic or not?</i></b> Is this a full on No Powers AU or a world where Magic Is Know and has integrated in the muggle world to the point there’s mixed colleges for magical and muggle classes?</p><p>because I vote for the later bc so many more shenanigans can happen with magic!</p><p>I mean just imagine, Padfoot racing across campus because he’s overslept {and there are anti-apparition wards on campus for security reasons} and other students have long since grown used to this either laugh about sleeping in or cheer him on to make it because Professor Grindelwald is notoriously strict about tardiness.</p><p>Or there being rules against flying brooms on campus outside of certain areas/times {such as Quidditch practice} but Harry is like one of the people who just has to ride their skateboard instead of walking, he hasn’t been caught…yet.</p><p>(Basically a college HP au is loads of fun but keeping magic just makes it 100 times better)</p><p>.</p><p>Charlie (and Tonks, who’s in it to be a supportive friend but mostly for the LOLs) waging war against various departments for various reasons - like Biology and dissection - about their treatments of animals. </p><p>Newt is constantly harassed about their antics - because everyone knows who it is but there’s no proof - and is just <i>“I have no idea what you’re talking about, my students are perfectly well behaved.”</i> while his house is full of various rescued creatures the two smuggled there.</p><p>.</p><p>Hermione and Lily meet one time when Lily came over during the weekend to stock up Harry’s fridge while Hermione was over tutoring him.</p><p>They get along <i>fantastically</i>. </p><p>Harry and James are low-key freaking out about this.</p><p>.</p><p>Ron and Harry meeting due to dorm room assignments, where basically the entire Weasley family is fussing over him when Harry stumbles in all alone - because he’s an Adult Now and he can go to college alone. </p><p>(This lasts like barely two weeks before Harry runs out of clean clothes and he calls Lily to ask how to wash clothes; not until later, too late, that he finds out that Ron knows how</p><p>{The reason being thus; <i>Molly has multiple kids in college, by this time she has it down to a <b>science</b> just what kinds of things they need to know before leaving home</i>})</p><p>.</p><p>Harry taking a class Voldemort teaches and. Just. Their hatred for each other is known across campus, Voldemort constantly trying to get Harry expelled while Harry is just “<i>there’s something fish about that guy”</i>and “<i>he’s evil mum! why do I have to be nice?”</i></p><p>.</p><p>Hermione and Lily do some kind of rally or organize a student protest that becomes a legit <i>social movement</i> because these woman <b>cannot</b> be tamed.</p><p>(McGonagall is so proud of her students)</p><p>.</p><p>Lockhart teaches drama, Harry winds up there while lost and accidentally gets a lead in a play - afterwards Harry just low-key swears vengeance against Lockhart.</p><p>.</p><p>Umbridge is a guidance counselor that Harry gets arrested the same year he meets her.</p><p>(whether the same thing happens to Voldemort eventually or Tom is there to eternally be Harry’s sworn enemy until graduation idk yet)</p><p>.</p><p>Remus teaches a class there but Harry only is able to take it for one year and is sad, though they do talk.</p><p>.</p><p>Sirius is the only Marauder actually going to college instead of hanging around for various reasons - he lives off campus though and rides his motorcycle there.</p><p>.</p><p>Peter, Harry swears to his his parents and the other two Maruaders multiple times, is on campus as Voldemort’s minion in Evil. They don’t believe him because they never see him and he’s out of the country for work. </p><p>(Sometimes Peter just sits there, grading papers in a corner during class, and just stares at Harry. </p><p>Harry then runs to Remus or Sirius - depending on who is closer - and tells them about it and how he certain this means Peter and Voldemort are Plotting, then screams when they are all “Harry, Peter isn’t in the country how cane he be on campus <i>Plotting</i> with your math teacher?”)</p><p>

    <b>Are there cameras? With timestamps? Because Harry can get proof Peter is in his class when he is supposed to be out of the country.</b>
  </i>
</p><p>There are but, since I have decided - right now because I am apparently fond of Peter being a low-key villain for the express purpose of trolling Harry - that this au still has magic, Peter makes use of Time-Turners, Polyjuice Potions and Magical Travel to basically be in two places at once. </p><p>So, the one time Harry got photographic proof of Peter being in class, Peter had it dismissed via alibi of him being out of the country <i>at work</i> when the pictures were taken.</p><p>So. No one, except the students living in the same dorm - House? Basically this au’s equivalent to Gryffindor <strike>also I should probably talk about the houses a bit too</strike> - as Harry, i.e. his friends, believe that his father’s friend who works out of country is sitting in his math class grading papers.</p><p>.</p><p>

    <b>Okay, so, I need a huge fic about this, because this is comedy gold. Also Snape keeps getting stuck teaching General Chemistry 1 and 2 and Intro to Potions every semester instead of the higher level courses and he’s Salty™ about it. Though he doesn’t pick on Harry here because Lily would straight up kill his ass and he knows it, Harry still sics his mom on Snape for picking on other students.</b>

</p><p>Snape complains about his classes and then swears to get rid of the other potions professors so he can take over the higher level classes to Professor McGonagall who’s sipping her coffee - she has a lot of early morning classes to teach, <i>alright</i>, and tea is just <i>not enough</i> - like it’s fine wine during this.</p><p>(ofc Harry overhears and decides that Snape must be Voldemort’s minion in Evil also.</p><p>Also, Voldy actually goes by Tom Riddle but back when Sirius was taking his class - along with his cousin Bellatrix who got a really creepy crush on the guy - and decided to give him the nickname Voldemort. <strike>Never will he admit exactly where that name came from, only it involves drunken shenanigans and waking up in a jail cell with a hangover.</strike> </p><p>Sirius commiserates with Harry over Voldemort’s Evilness, he still doesn’t quite believe Peter is there too though.)</p><p>.</p><p>Harry would have been majoring in something like law enforcement when he entered, then he switched to sports - Quidditch - for a while before (tentatively) settling on the idea of becoming a teacher.</p><p>DA is actually a group of people he's tutoring for both pocket money (Harry has zero self control when it comes to groceries and cooking supplies, Ron has an endless stomach also, so they need the money to eat because they're constantly going over their budget) and for the experience.</p><p>.</p><p>Luna specializes in Abstract Art that inevitably involves creatures of some kind, it's also magical art so it <i>moves</i>.</p><p>She also, with her father sending her money and supplies to do so, starts up her own school paper called <i>University of Magic </i>- UM for short (it's also the papers header and everyone who doesn't actually work on it thinks it is actually named <i>Um</i>).</p><p>.</p><p>UM has various recurring topics and writers like;</p><p>Professor Scamander's weekly article about Magical Creatures.</p><p>Neville Longbottom daily gardening tips.</p><p>Harry's bi-monthly segment that is basically him giving tutorials about cooking.</p><p>Sirius' once a month add about the Animagus club along with his daily, well, gossip collum.</p><p>Charlie, who has the most popular collum by far, sparodically writes about whatever expedition he went on with Newt. (Luna took a poll and the most famous story is the one involving the Niffler, Gringotts, a protest and an escaped dragon. It featured on the news, <i>twice</i>, and Charlie got a howler the same day.)</p><p>Ron is basically a food critic who rates the various eateries on/around/near campus.</p><p>.</p><p>Bill is out of country in an exchange student program - where he meets Fleur - and gets to hear all these stories second hand during Harry's first year.</p><p>He's exasperated <strike>(and kinda put out because he got used to the chaos and France is was too fucking <i>calm</i>)</strike></p><p>.</p><p>Percy is over in the corner working for his degree in politics and foreign relations, trying to pretend he doesn't know these crazy people the twelfth time the Chemistry building has to be evacuated because of the twins or the third time he has to post bail for Charlie or the sixth time he has to help Ron get home because he took the wrong bus.</p><p>(he's especially incredulous over that given they don't take a bus home but the <b>train</b> which has a station <i>on campus</i>)</p><p>Basically. Percy is Done™ and just wants to graduate.</p><p>(he's also UM's editor)</p>
