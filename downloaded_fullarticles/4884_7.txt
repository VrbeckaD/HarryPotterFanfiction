    <p>Draco knew Harry Potter's face.</p><p>He knew how it would twist in anger. How his bright green eyes would glare and how his lips opened as he bared his teeth, pulling his skin taut. </p><p>He knew how it would distort and curl into itself as different emotions flashed on his face. He knew right when he was about to throw an insult back. His eyes would shine in malicious glee as he stooped to Draco's level to try to hurt, maim, aim to kill Draco's self-esteem.</p><p>He knew how it would crumple in remorse and regret, moments after he sliced open Draco's chest.</p><p>Draco also had his weak moments. Those moments when Draco stared at his laughing face. His eyes would sometimes crinkle, or they would widen in delight and his smile was full of warmth. Warmth that was never meant for Draco.</p><p>However, Draco had never seen one emotion on Harry Potter's face.</p><p>Fear.</p><p>So, when Draco's father asked him if he recognised Harry Potter, he technically told the truth. He did not recognise him, because he had never seen Potter's face contorted so horribly and not only from fear. (The Stinging Hex must have been Granger's idea, since the idiots who brought the trio in claimed they had nothing to do with it.) His eyes were wide and alight with emotion. Those pale green eyes were begging him not to say anything. Harry Potter never begged. He was biting his bottom lip raw. Harry Potter never bit his lips; it was never one of his nervous gestures. </p><p>It was easy to say "I don't know."</p><p>It was easy to shove the wands at him.</p><p>It's Hell, trying to deal with the aftermath.</p><p>The Dark Lord arrived, only seconds after Harry Potter and Dobby disappeared, the house-elf catching a knife in his chest. </p><p>Aunt Bella was screaming madly. Mother was trying to usher Draco out of the room before the Dark Lord could catch glimpse of them. Alas, he knew immediately what they were doing without even turning to look at them. The door slammed shut with an audible <em>bang!</em> and his voice was full of anger. "Dearest Draco, where do you think you're going? And pretty, narcissistic Narcissa? Leaving so <em>soon</em>?"</p><p>The Dark Lord turned to Draco, ignoring the Stunned bodies of the werewolf and Father. Draco could feel the probing presence of the Dark Lord, invading his mind, but Draco knew Occlumency. He forced his shields up, right beneath the surface, the thoughts: his eyes were too blue, his hair was too long, he was not Potter--</p><p>The Dark Lord laughed maliciously. "Of course it was Potter, Malfoy. Only he would have been able to escape. Where is Wormtail?" Both Draco and his mother blanched. Neither had even thought of Wormtail. The Dark Lord tsked, displeased. "Go to the dungeons and search for him. He would not have gone far."</p><p>Draco ran out of the room, and cringed when he heard Aunt Bella's bellows echoing around the staircase. He didn't register what she was saying; his eyes had caught sight of Wormtail.</p><p>His body was curled up in a fetal position and there were bruises blooming around his neck. His silver hand was disconnected, the magic of the amputation shivering in anticipation. Draco gulped, breathing in heavily.</p><p>He went for his wand, only to realise he had surrendered it to Potter. Figures. He slowly backed away, before noticing that the dungeon was empty. </p><p><em>Fuck</em>.</p><p> </p><p>"Draco Malfoy . . ." the Dark Lord whispered, his voice soft and deceiving, "are you telling me that, not only is Wormtail a traitor once again, but that my prisoners have been taken?"</p><p>Draco was bowed in front of the Dark Lord, on his hands and knees. He only confirmed with a meek, "Yes, my Lord."</p><p>Greyback had been sent to the dungeons, and both of the elder Malfoys were being held in an <em>Incarcerous</em>. Draco could feel Aunt Bella's eyes on his back, burning holes that saw through his soul. She <em>knows</em>.</p><p>"You are in quite the predicament, Draco Malfoy. Both of your parents have already been put under the Cruciatus curse, but I feel that punishment is too . . . tame for you. You've lost not only you wand, but my dear Bella's wand as well. I believe that she should have the honour of torturing you. I shall deal with the other Malfoys myself, as well as Greyback." He paused, Levitating Draco's parents. He looked at Aunt Bella. "Perhaps the muggle methods will be best, since he has lost his power?"</p><p>She pursed her lips thoughtfully. "Maybe a mixture of muggle methods, as well as magic. <em>Accio Cissy's wand</em>!"</p><p>The Dark Lord's laugh filled the room, mocking the Malfoys. Mother struggled in her bounds at last, as her wand came souring through the air into Aunt Bella's hand. She studied it carefully and then smiled, showing her rotting teeth. "Why, I deem this wand worthy of torture!" </p><p>"I shall leave you to it, my lovely, twisted Bella," the Dark Lord proclaimed, banging the Incarcerated forms of Draco's parents into objects as he moved them out of the drawing room. </p><p>The clanging of the door slamming shut forcefully reminded Draco that he was a prisoner, too. Except he didn't get to escape.</p><p> </p><p>"Draco, Draco, what to do with you?" Aunt Bella purred, enunciating every word. Draco forced himself to continue to stare at the floor; he hadn't moved from his bowing position.</p><p>She chuckled darkly to herself. "There's always the good, old fashioned whipping. I think that's how we'll start, hm?"</p><p>Foreign magic spelled away Draco's outer robes and shirt underneath. His arms shook violently as he trembled with fear.</p><p>"Not to worry, Draco! It won't hurt at all!" she exclaimed as the first lash came down.</p><p>Draco let out a shocked gasp and clenched his jaw shut as the end of the whip gripped its' claws into Draco's back and pulled the skin off. He held in a scream as he felt the blood drip down his side. With each lash, Bellatrix began to talk. </p><p>"There is a muggle myth of a man who could perform miracles." <em>Crack</em>! Tears ran silently down his face and he bit his lip so hard, Draco gulped down the tangy, metallic taste of blood after cutting open his lip. "This man was hated by many people, because they were scared of his power." <em>Crack</em>! "They decided, the leaders of some of the muggles-" <em>Crack</em>! "-that they were going to kill him."</p><p>"First, they would publicly humiliate him." <em>Crack</em>! Draco's arm gave way and he fell forward onto his stomach. "They whipped him thirty-" <em>Crack</em>! "-nine-" <em>Crack</em>! "-times!" Blood splattered against the floor and Draco could feel each claw dig into the layers of skin and tendons underneath and pull.</p><p>"They forced him-" <em>Crack</em>! "-into a crown-" <em>Crack</em>! "-made of the thorns!" <em>Crack</em>! Draco started sobbing, blood trickling out of the corner of his mouth. "To mock-" <em>Crack</em>! "-his Holiness!" Her laugh echoed around them, while Draco screamed. </p><p>"Then, they forced-" <em>Crack</em>! "-him to carry-"<em> Crack</em>! "-his own crucifix." </p><p>Draco cried freely, his tears mixing with blood. Bellatrix stood next to Draco, bending down. She grabbed the sides of his face and pulled hard. Draco whimpered as he felt his neck crack and pain exploded in his veins, setting every cell on fire. "They marked him, mocked him, and killed him.</p><p>"It's a pity I can't kill you, but perhaps the Dark Lord could be persuaded if I drive you to insanity." She threw his face away from her and his body collapsed. "<em>Crucio</em>!" </p><p>The pain of Draco's back was nothing compared to that of the Cruciatus curse. Both seemed to complement the other and Draco could feel each pinprick of the Cruciatus curse as his entire back seemed to be engulfed in flame.</p><p>He lost consciousness after forty minutes.</p><p> </p><p>Harry Potter was in front of him. It was the Room of Hidden Things, except everything was white. Every book, every object. </p><p>Even the Vanishing Cabinet.</p><p>Harry Potter was not white, though. He looked a little bit like he did when he was at the Manor, except without the Stinging Hex. His curly, black hair went passed his shoulders and his face was grazed with stubble. His eyes were vivid green behind his glasses, and his dark skin contrasted with the white robes nicely.</p><p>Draco looked down at himself and was quietly surprised to see that he was naked. He ran a hand through his hair and it was gel free and wavy. How it was naturally. He didn't feel modest, though. It felt right.</p><p>"You're losing your sanity," Potter said without preamble. The Vanishing Cabinet door opened. "You can either choose to regain your sanity and wake up, or you can choose not to."</p><p>"Where will I be if I choose not to?" Draco asked.</p><p>"You will be locked inside of your mind. You will most likely create a world in which you will feel most happy and comfortable in, before true reality intrudes. If you choose to lose your sanity, you will most definitely be killed by the Dark Lord."</p><p>Draco's eyes narrowed. "The real Harry Potter would say Vol-" Draco looked away. "The Dark Lord's true name."</p><p>"I cannot," Potter said, not unkindly. "Because I am apart of you, I cannot do something you cannot." Potter paused. "You are a coward, Draco Malfoy. And you know this. You also know that if you wake back up, you must face the reality of what has been done to you. You have been tortured for over an hour, at least. You have been whipped so severely, you will most likely never truly recover. You will also forever bare <em>my</em> mark."</p><p>Draco's brow furrowed in confusion. "What, from the <em>Sectumsempra</em>?"</p><p>"Not only that. Bellatrix is carving a lightning bolt into your forehead as we speak. The Dark Lord has taken over with the Cruciatus curse."</p><p>"How do you know this?"</p><p>"I'm the part of you that's still aware. I'm the part of you that can still think clearly." Potter paused. "I'm the part of you that still cares. Since there are so many barriers to keep me suppressed, I'm the most protected by your Occlumency while you are being tortured. But if you don't wake up, I'll be lost, too."</p><p>The thought of Harry Potter losing chilled Draco to the core and he shuddered. Potter smiled slightly. "If you can be disturbed, then I suppose I already know what you're going to do."</p><p>"I can't leave my parents," Draco said. The situation frightened him, but he will not leave them.</p><p>"Before you go, I must warn you - you will continue to be tortured. Even when you wake up, you may lose consciousness again, but you will no longer be on the brink of insanity. You remember what to do. Live in the pain. Let it flow through you. Do not tense- it will only make it worse." Draco nodded. "After they are done with the physical abuse, they will most likely begin emotional and mental abuse. They will most likely keep you near Dementers. Reiterate this thought to yourself - <em>Potter will win</em>. It isn't a happy thought, nor is it hopeful. It is a statement." The books started disappearing and the Vanishing Cabinet door slammed shut. "They will most likely force you to torture more. Research spell creation. Perhaps you can create a spell that mimics the Cruciatus curse without actually inflicting pain." </p><p>The brightness of the room dimmed until all that was left was Harry Potter.</p><p>"Own your pain, Draco Malfoy. Wear your scars with pride."</p><p>Draco stared at Potter, even as his form began to dissipate. "Why you?"</p><p>His laughter faded away, along with his answer. "You want to make him proud."</p><p>Pain ignited in every pore as Draco opened his eyes.</p>
<hr/><p>The stasis charm put on Draco allowed him to move without pain. He held his chin high, even as Death Eaters laughed at the lightning bolt that ran down his nose, or the "P o t t e r - L o v e r" forever engraved into his cheeks.</p><p>He created a wordless incantation that he cast before whispering, "<em>Cruci</em> . . ." The wand movement was the same as <em>Adsmilo tortus nullum clamor</em>, and the victims' always screamed and shook violently as he held the spell.</p><p>His room was moved next to where they kept the people who were to be Kissed by Dementors. He studied how to become an Animagus during the coldest days and succeeded right before the end of the war. </p><p>It was a dove.</p><p>Before they charged into Hogwarts, Draco put a Glamour on his face.</p>
<hr/><p>The moment the Dark Lord fell, so did Draco. The stasis charm that was able to keep him steady vanished and he collapsed, shaking uncontrollably, his Glamour dissipating as well.</p><p>He did not scream, but he did sob.</p><p>His parents carried him to the Headmaster's office and Flooed back to the Manor.</p><p>The Aurors arrived three days later.</p><p> </p>
