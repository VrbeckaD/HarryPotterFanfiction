    <h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
    <p>The light from the setting sun was slowly peaking through the branches. Filling the air, the cold breeze could be sensed all around the small town of Cluj. Winter was slowly making way for warmer times, even if it was just the beginning of February.<br/>
</p><p>
On Live Oak street, all was quiet. In one house though, stood Eli Bravu, a quaint twenty year old. Coming home from university wasn’t going so well as she thought it would. Being on your own, for an entire semester, without any contact with your parents was something very hard for her. But coming home was no bed of roses either. She always wondered why it was easier to talk to her mum while away. Coming here felt like they would always end up having an argument. She knew she wasn’t perfect, but neither was her mum.<br/>
</p><p>
Eli closed her laptop and made her way to the kitchen. Trying to clear her head from everything was no easy task, but she hoped everything was for the better. She had no idea how to tell her parents that she wanted to quit university.<br/>
</p><p>
She sat down at the table, scrolling mindlessly through her phone while sipping her tea. Sighing, Eli put her cup down and stared outside the window. It was a beautiful chilly day indeed. Maybe going out for a walk was going to do her good.<br/>
</p><p>
Standing up and finishing her cup of tea in the process, a loud crashing noise just came from the window in front of her. Two men on brooms just crashed down in front of her. She heard shouts in a language that she never heard before. She just stood there, scared to even make a move. Eli heard her dad shout from the room above her, making his way on the stairs.<br/>
</p><p>
“Leave! Go” she heard one of the men scream at her while something hit him square in the chest. It was something familiar about it, though, a word she heard somewhere in a time long gone. Glass was shattered around him, small cuts were on his shirt and arms. She could see the man in front of her now, wearing a murderous look on his face. He bared his teeth and muttered “Avada Kedavra” with a hate Eli had yet to witness. She ducked as fast as she could, landing somewhere near the fridge.<br/>
</p><p>
“Eli…” she looked frightened behind her, seeing her dad falling to the ground, all the expression from his face gone. She went straight to him, palming his face, trying to wake him up, screaming at him, but he wouldn’t budge. She looked at the man who had a stick pointing at her face and fear surged though her. She was going to die today. Her breathing increased and could not hear what the man was telling her. She spotted another stick laying on the floor and did the only sensible thing that came to her mind. She grabbed what she presumed was a wand, pointed at the man and shouted “Diffindo”. The man in front of her laughed at her pathetic attempt of making magic. She was getting more and more scared, having no idea what was going on. She was in grave danger. She tried shouting “Reducto” and a red spark emerged from that wand in her hand, but as soon as the spell left her lips, the stick was flying out of her hand as quick as lightning.<br/>
</p><p>
“Well, well, well. We have a mudbood here, don’t we, Black?” asked the brown haired man in from of her, looking down at the unconscious boy and kicking him in the side. She supposed he wasn’t much older than her. The brown haired man came closer and closer to her as she backed down to the wall next to her.<br/>
</p><p>
“That filthy muggle had it easy. You’re going to wish that it was you who was hit by…” but he didn’t get to finish what he was saying.<br/>
</p><p>
A fist came straight to his face and Eli tried to grab the wand from his hands. Fighting for her life raised in her so much adrenaline that she didn’t recognize herself. She heard movement from behind her as the brown haired man shouted at her and tried to get the wands at a safe distance from her to cast a curse. The next thing she knew was the man being thrown to the ground by a blow to the head. In front of her stood now the boy with a broken plate in his hand. He quickly got his wand from the ground and looked at her with worried eyes. He tried opening his mouth but the brown haired man was again on his feet, wand aimed at both of them. She instinctively got behind the boy and looked at the man. He wore black robes, something that she had never seen normal people wear. He yelled “Crucio” at the boy but he ducked quickly and started to throw spell after spell at him. The black robed man looked at both of them and shouted, wand at the ceiling, “Tempus erit vobis in ruinam”. A red bubble appeared, surrounding all three of them. Eli felt like she was sick. Her body felt compressed, her eyes felt like they were being ripped out of her head. She couldn’t hear nor see anything. There was darkness and complete pain for a moment. She thought she was going to die, until she hit the ground.<br/>
</p><p>
She tried getting up, but there was an unbearable pain in her left hand. The once green blouse was now soaking red with blood. She brought her right hand to touch her shoulder but there was so much pain she thought she might pass out. Eli looked around , but only saw the boy laying there. She didn’t know where she was or what brought them here. One thing was certain in her head. She must be going insane. She got up and reached the boy laying in the grass. Wherever this was, it must be a forest and the sun had already set. She wondered if they landed in Hoia Baciu.<br/>
</p><p>
“Trezeste-te!” she said once she was next to him. Eli touched lightly his shoulder and shook him.<br/>
</p><p>
A groan was heard from him and Eli distanced herself from him. She quickly realized that romanian wouldn’t do.<br/>
</p><p>
“Who are you?” she inquired. “What the hell happened?”<br/>
</p><p>
The boy didn’t answer her, but got up his feet, muttering under his breath “Fucking Rookwood!”.<br/>
</p><p>
“Hey! Who the bloody hell are you? Answer me for Christ’s sake!”<br/>
</p><p>
“Shut up, woman!” the boy shouthed. “My head is bloody spinning.”<br/>
</p><p>
Eli took him in. His shirt was reddened by blood, his long dark hair was tangleg and his face looked like it had seen better days, heavy dark circles laying underneath his grey eyes. There was a small clean cut right next to his lips. His jeans were dirty, as well as his boots. His hands were cut from place to place making his skin even whiter in contrast to the red that spread over them from what happened at her house. Her house…<br/>
</p><p>
She suddenly remembered all that happened. Her father, the wand, that man. She looked at the sky and feel to her knees.<br/>
</p><p>
“Nu…” she whispered. “NUUUU!”<br/>
</p><p>
She was hitting the ground with her fists, shouting and crying. Whatever happened took her father, took her life. She didn’t know what to do. She shouldn’t have ducked. She should have tried to make sure her father escaped. She would have been the one who died.  She should have tried save him. Eli ripped blades of grass and continued on hitting her fists against the ground until she couldn’t feel any more pain. Her father was dead.<br/>
</p><p>

Looking up, she saw the boy awkwardly observing her. She ignored the stare, and got up to her feet, approaching him. She was crying hard. Eli went to grab the stick from his hand and threw it as hard as she could in the forest. She looked at the boy in front of her and punched him hard in the chest. She screamed at him and continued on hitting him as hard as she could. Eli held onto the collar oh his shirt while whispering “E mort! E mort!”. She screamed as hard as she felt her knees go weak.<br/>
</p><p>
The long haired wizard steadied her before she would fall. He carefully set her at his feet while kneeling in front of him. He embraced her and held her close, not knowing what to do. For the first time in his life, he didn’t know how to react. He didn’t know what language she was speaking, but he noticed that she knew English. That was a start. He waited for her to calm down a little. When her breath evened out, he looked at her and his look fell on her shoulder. He knew Lily was better than him at healing, but he tried remembering a spell that would stop the bleeding.<br/>
</p><p>
“Wait here.” The boy got up his feet and went further in the forest. He had no idea where they were, but wished they were back in England. Rookwood must have apparated them while they were on their brooms. He remembered the familiar pull, but it didn’t feel quite as apparating. Trying to find his wand in a forest only with the light of the setting sun was going to be an arduous task.<br/>
</p><p>
He hoped that the girl’s throw wasn’t very good because they had no time to waste. Her arm was bleeding heavily. He focused his eyes on the ground. There were no leaves and the trees were all naked. In the air it could be sensed the faint smell of spring, but there was no sign of flowers or warmer weather. The greying view of the forest made him want to go get the girl as fast as he could. He finally found his wand am made his way to her as quickly as possible.<br/>
</p><p>
He found the girl with her blouse torn and her arm carefully bandaged in the cloth she wore moments before his parting. At least she stopped bleeding.<br/>
</p><p>
“I’m Sirius.” He simply said as he reached for her right hand lifting the girl up. “I’m going to take you to some friends of mine to tend your wounds, ok?”<br/>
</p><p>
“What... is your name?” she asked looking terrified.<br/>
</p><p>
“Sirius Black.” The boy in front of her responded. “What’s yours?”<br/>
</p><p>
Eli thought for the second time she was going to be sick. She swallowed hard and met his grey eyes. They looked just like she imagined them. This couldn’t be real. No way in hell this was Sirius Black. She searched his face for any signs of wrinkles, for hardness, for anything that proved her that this was just a figment of her imagination. She found none.<br/>
</p><p>
‘He must be lying to me’ Eli thought.<br/>
</p><p>
“Oi!” Sirius shook her hand, bringing her back to reality. “What’s your name?”<br/>
</p><p>
“Eli.”<br/>
</p><p>
She looked at him as if she had seen a ghost. He ignored her staring and put his hands on her waist, holding her close. She grabbed the front of his shirt, knowing what was coming and closed her eyes. She felt compressed, but it didn’t hurt her as the red bubble did.<br/>
</p><p>
When she opened her eyes they were standing in a dark room. The floor was littered with beer cans and bottles on which she could read “Butterbeer”. The walls were dark red and there was a fireplace in the corner next to her. On the other side was a couch and a little wooden table littered with books, parchments and an old feather quill. Eli could see the directly in the kitchen where were a few chairs and a table in the middle the room.<br/>
</p><p>
“Sit on the couch. I’ll be right back” Sirius told her.<br/>
</p><p>
Eli watched how he disappeared in the fireplace while shouting “Potter Cottage”. She started to hyperventilate. This was not real. Whatever this was, she must have hit her head while sitting in the kitchen. None of this was happening. Sirius was too young, she was hurt and her father dead on the floor of her house. No way in hell any of this was happening. She tried pinching herself, but stopped when the reality of the pain in her left arm hit her. What was the meaning of this? What on earth has caused all of this nonsense to happen? She couldn’t think clearly. Tears threatened to spill out of her eyes at the simple though of her father. She wanted to close her eyes and hope that the next time she opened them, she would be home next to him. She closed them, but the same red room was in front of her the moment she opened them. Eli heard the fireplace crack and from inside came Sirius, followed but a red head girl and a boy with glassed and messy hair.<br/>
</p><p>
“No! Who are you?” Eli shouted.<br/>
</p><p>
“Calm down, Eli! They are friends. Remember? I told you I’m going to bring back friends to heal your shoulder?” Sirius spoke as is he was talking to a small child.<br/>
</p><p>
“Don’t you fucking talk to me like I’m five! Who are they?” Eli asked more and more angry.<br/>
</p><p>
“Ok, don’t shout. We mean no harm. I’m Lily and this is my husband James. We only want to help you, Eli.” the red head spoke.<br/>
</p><p>
Eli felt like she was having a panic attack. She was sweating from all of the pores and watched as the people in the room get closer to her.<br/>
</p><p>
“Immobulus!”<br/>
</p><p>
Eli’s eyes went big and couldn’t move as she watched Sirius pocket his wand in the back of his jeans.<br/>
</p><p>
“Now we can deal with her without her looking at us like we’re going to murder her.”<br/>
</p><p>
“Sirius, what were you thinking? Let her go!”<br/>
</p><p>
“Oh, yeah, Lily? And then what? Watch her getting more and more scared? I won’t have it. I’ll cast a finite once you pour that damned calming draught down her throat. Come on, do it, Lily!” Sirius told the red head as Eli watched lazily from the couch as Lily approached her and opened her mouth while whispering to her that everything will be alright.<br/>
</p><p>
Once the potion was in her system, a sudden feel of calmness surrounded Eli. She felt light and her head stopped spinning. There was no more panic, no more fear. All was somehow better. She didn’t understand how it worked, never being very interested in the potions sections of the book she assumed she was caught in.<br/>
</p><p>
“Finite.”<br/>
</p><p>
“Thank you.” Eli whispered to Lily once the charm was lifted. She looked at the red haired girl with doe eyes and understood that whenever and wherever she was, the situation was hell. “What is the date?”<br/>
</p><p>
“It’s 8th February.” James answered looking at the girl on the couch.<br/>
</p><p>
“What year?” Judging by their muggle clothes, it was somewhere between 1978 and 1981. ‘They must be part of the Order by now’ she thought.<br/>
</p><p>
“Umm… 1980?” James said scratching the back of his head. “Sirius, are you sure she didn’t hit her head as well?” he turned his attention back to his friend who now leaned against the wall, hands crossed over his chest, looking at her.<br/>
</p><p>
“No. Lily please take care oh her arm, it’s pretty nasty. I think Rookwood hit her with some nasty spell while I was out.”<br/>
</p><p>
“What’s your name?” Lily asked her.<br/>
</p><p>
“Eli Bravu.” she responded while Lily carefully discarded the reddened cloth that was covering her arm.<br/>
</p><p>
“So you’re not British.”<br/>
</p><p>
“Romanian” Eli gasped at the sudden pain in her arm.<br/>
</p><p>
“This is going to hurt a little bit.” Lily applied the dittany to her wound while Eli struggled a bit not to make any sounds. “It will heal in time, don’t worry. Now let me see of there are any wounds on your torso as well. James, Sirius, would you mind if you went to the kitchen?”<br/>
</p><p>
The boys nodded and headed off to the other room.<br/>
</p><p>
“Why did she ask about the year, Padfoot?”<br/>
</p><p>
“I don’t know how to explain this, James… While I was fighting Rookwood on the brooms, he took out a thing from under his robes. I assume it was a time-turner since the girl asked about the year. The weird part is this though. He didn’t use a time-turner on the way back. He shouted an incantation at the ceiling. At first, I thought he was going to tear it down, but a red bubble appeared around all of us and we were sent in that forest.”<br/>
</p><p>
“Do you think the girl is from the past?” James inquired curiously.<br/>
</p><p>
“Hardly. She wears simple muggle clothing around these years. Maybe a couple a years back? I don’t know, but I don’t think it’s that much. Once she’s healed, I need to talk to her. Maybe Dumbledore can find a way to send her back home.” Sirius said curtly. “Her father died right in front of her. I think she wants to give him a proper burial.”<br/>
</p><p>
Their names could be heard from the other room. Lily had finished healing as best as she could Eli’s wounds, asking her if she felt better. As the guys entered the room, Eli stood up and looked at them. She wasn’t sure what to ask, what to say because all of it sounded like a pour joke inside her head. Before she got the chance to open her mouth, Sirius spoke.<br/>
</p><p>
“What year are you from? Maybe we could talk to Dumbledore to get a time-turner from the Ministry for you to get back home.”<br/>
</p><p>
“You wouldn’t believe me even if I told you.” Eli peered into his grey eyes. “Besides, I don’t even know if a time-turner can help me go home.”<br/>
</p><p>
“It can send you forward and backwards in time so that is not a problem anyways.” James went to hug his wife, looking at the girl, now dressed in one of Lily’s jumpers.<br/>
</p><p>
“Can it send me in a different dimension? Because I don’t think so!” Eli said with spite. “2020 is not a great year and no, I don’t think any bloody time-turner can get me back home!”<br/>
</p><p>
“You’re from…” Lily said with wide eyes.<br/>
</p><p>
Eli took a seat on the couch, her elbows on her knees. She could not deal with everything right now. Losing her father, being thrown in a different universe from a bloody book, seeing favourite characters in the flesh in front of her, being attacked was too much for a couple of hours. The wounds were as real as it gets, the pain was real. The logical answer was that this was reality, one way or another.<br/>
</p><p>
“What do you mean a different universe?” continued Lily.<br/>
</p><p>
“I mean that you are not fucking real!” Eli spat getting back on her feet and looking intensely at the three of them. “You don’t exist! You can’t exist!”<br/>
</p><p>
“I think I am very much alive, thank you.” James told him irritated. The girl stared to irk him.<br/>
</p><p>
“Yes, you are. In this bloody version of events. In my wold, none of you are. How can someone travel through not only time, but space as well? How? What kind of fucking magic is this? Huh? Give me a break! Fucking magic! It’s only doing bad shit, just like the fucking muggles! Nothing in this world is fucking right! And now I am standing here with people I read from fucking books from another time in another dimension!” Eli grabbed the next thing to her and threw it at a wall.<br/>
</p><p>
“Fucking stop, witch!” Sirius was next to her in one second, stopping her from smashing something else. “Merlin’s beard, just stop or I’ll bind you again!”<br/>
</p><p>
Eli looked at him and simply stopped. She didn’t know if she said too much or if just being here was changing something. She was full of rage. Why was her life ripped apart? But then a thought popped inside her mind. Why was Harry’s life so full of shit for no reason? Why do bad things happen to good people? She looked into Sirius’ eyes and knew what was coming for him. Years and years of sorrow. His two friends from this very room were going to be dead in just a year and a half. He was going to lose everything and feel what she was feeling right now.<br/>
</p><p>
“I thought the calming draught will fucking take effect. Sit down! What do you mean you read about us?”<br/>
</p><p>
“I don’t really think it’s important.”<br/>
</p><p>
“You said we were dead. I think it’s somewhat important.” Lily intervened.<br/>
</p><p>
“Aren’t there rules about time travel? As in the one who travels shouldn’t divulge secrets about the past? And I never said that you were dead.” Eli didn’t know if she ought to tell the truth.<br/>
</p><p>
“Even if there were any, you broke them all.” Sirius said casually. “I’m taking her to Dumbledore.”<br/>
</p><p>
“No, you are not! I don’t want to. Not yet.”<br/>
</p><p>
“Do you know him?” James asked.<br/>
</p><p>
“If I know you, I think I’d know about him.” Eli replied coldly. She didn’t know if she could trust Dumbledore, especially because she didn’t know anymore if she was muggle or a witch. She felt warmth touching Sirius’ wand going through her entire body, but she never manifested magic in her entire life.<br/>
</p><p>
“Why do you know about us?” asked Lily. “What have we done in the future?”<br/>
</p><p>
“I’m going to repeat what I said earlier. Even if I told you, you wouldn’t believe me.”<br/>
</p><p>
“Try us.” Said Sirius piercing her with his eyes. He really was a handsome guy.<br/>
</p><p>
Eli sighed. She didn’t have to make a choice right now, but her life was ruined anyways. Her family was ripped apart. Her friends were gone. The life as she knew it disappeared. Even if there was a possibility of going back, could she ever put a foot in that house? Whatever answer the possibility of going back had, in that moment she made a decision that was going to change everyone’s lives forever.</p>
