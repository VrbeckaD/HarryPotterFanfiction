    <p>Harry was packing his things into his trunk when Vernon stormed in and shouted,"You're not going anywhere freak!"</p><p>"Yes I am and you won't stop me." Harry snapped</p><p>"Oh really!" Vernon roared as he tried to punch Harry but He sidestepped before the punch could hit him. Harry's magic reacted and threw Vernon away and knocked him out, he used that to grab his trunk and Hedwig and exit the house.</p><p>When Harry got outside Dumbledore with several Order members appeared. "Harry calm down." Dumbledore ordered</p><p>"No! You've controlled my life for too long." Harry said</p><p>"Moody stun him." Dumbledore said but as Moody went to stun Harry's eyes started to blaze emerald and Moody was sent back. "Remus I thought you were a friend." Harry said</p><p>"I realise what I have done now, so when you go can we keep in touch?" Remus asked hopefully</p><p>"Of course." Harry replied happily, Remus went to hug Harry when Dumbledore threw a stunning spell towards them. "I'll be going now, Remus i'll send you a letter." Harry said as he glared at Dumbledore</p><p>Harry then apparated to Potter Manor, which he had discovered last year when to goblins were able to contact him. When he arrived he spent an hour exploring the grounds before he went inside.</p><p>As soon as Harry went in a house elf appeared in front of him. "Master Harry I am Grobby the head elf." Grobby announced</p><p>"Grobby can you show me to my room? Don't call me master just Harry." Harry said</p><p>"Ok Mas- Harry, your room is the master bedroom on the second floor,third room to the right." Grobby replied</p><p>"Thanks." Harry said as he went up the stairs to his room. When he arrived he unpacked his things and put them away. He then layed down on his bed to have a nap.</p><p>When he awoke two hours later he wrote and sent a letter to Remus but put a hex on it so only Remus could read it. He then went downstairs to the kitchen to make some lunch.</p><p>As he was making the food Grobby appeared and said aghast,"Master shouldn't be doing that Grobby should."</p><p>"Grobby I will be making my food a few times a week and don't call me Master." Harry said firmly</p><p>"Ok." Grobby whispered before he disappeared. Harry finished making his food and sat down to eat it when a letter arrived. When he opened it he saw it was from Hermione.</p><p>Harry</p><p>Dumbledore was ranting about you disappearing when he went to collect you from Privet Drive. I want you to know that I support you.</p><p>I tried to get Ron and Ginny to support you to but they listen to Dumbledore as they see him as their hero. Please be safe and don't get into any trouble.</p><p>Hermione</p><p>Harry smiled as he knew that he had at least one friend in Hermione he wasn't sure if Nevile or Luna would still be his friends.</p><p>Remus was sitting in a Order meeting listening to Dumbledore talking about making plans to find Harry when an owl with a letter appeared in front of Remus. Just as he was about to open it after he took it from the owl, a hand grabbed it out of his hand.</p><p>Dumbledore fell to the floor as soon as he touched the letter as he began to sprout horns on his head. Remus laughed as he took the letter back. As soon as he read it he felt relieved to know that his cub was safe, he looked up to see Mcgonagall, Tonks and Kingsley glaring at Dumbledore and knew that Harry had several supporters in the Order.</p><p>Remus quickly left the meeting to write a reply and send the memory of the meeting to Harry. So that he could get a laugh out of it.</p><p> </p><p>It was a week after Harry moved to Potter Manor that Nevile and Luna sent him letters saying that they supported him and were still his friends. Harry felt relieved to know he had more than one friend at Hogwarts.</p><p>Remus was reading in the living room of his cottage when he felt someone trying to take down his wards. He quickly summoned several of his irreplaceable belongings into his trunk and was about floo over to Potter Manor when Dumbledore walked into the cottage and announced,"Remus to have to go as to been consorting with a dark wizard."</p><p>Remus dragged his trunk into the fireplace and was saying Potter Manor when he was hit with a cutting curse. Harry was working on his essay for Charms when Remus appeared in the floo bleeding from his arm. "Remus what happened?!" Harry exclaimed</p><p>"Dumbledore attacked me at the cottage." Remus grunted before he fell on the floor. Harry quickly cast a healing spell on Remus' arm and levitated him onto a couch.</p><p>Harry summoned Grobby and told him,"Get a healing potion." Grobby appeared seconds later with several healing potions. Remus slipped into a peaceful sleep.</p><p>Harry went back to working on his essay but he kept an eye on Remus.</p><p> </p><p>Remus woke an hour later to see Harry sleeping on a couch with a blanket over him. He sat up to see himself in a living room that wasn't his but then he remembered what had happened.</p><p>Harry woke a few minutes later and saw Remus sitting up, he asked,"Do you know why Dumbledore attacked you?"</p><p>"Probably because he knew I was in contact with you. The wound is fully healed." Remus replied</p><p>"Yes I used an old healing spell that I learnt a few days ago." Harry answered the question that Remus was about to ask.</p><p>"Thank you." Remus said</p><p>"Well you are my honorary godfather." Harry replied, Remus laughed at that and they spent the rest of the night catching up. They did not end up getting to sleep until 4 in the morning.</p>
