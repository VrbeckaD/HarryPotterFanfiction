    <p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">He is a stranger here, an unknown, face unrecognisable, his identity kept under lock and key. He blends into the crowds with his head low and his hands in his pockets, the leather of his jacket catching onto bags and jewelry as he pushes past sweaty bodies. Cigarette smoke fills the air and his ears ring, so that he barely hears the drone of chatter on the busy streets. </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">His is a stranger here, his face unknown and name unrecognisable, with his identity hidden under lock and key. He blends into the crowds with ease, ducking his head low and tugging his leather jacket from snagging on jewelry and handbags, stifling his coughs from the cigarette smoke in the air with a hand over his mouth. His ears ring a little, hurt a little.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">The buildings to his left are boarded up with rotting wooden planks across the windows, and ain spits on his face, feeling like acid burning his skin. His throat kinda burns from the smoke, too, but he suppresses his grimaces and slips through the crowd.  </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">They are oppressive. Far too, if he is to be honest, made by men who only cry in the dark behind a locked door, and made by women who try to convince themselves that the catcalling is a compliment and that, you can't say that, it’ll ruin their life. Heavy, stagnant air pressing against his chest, and it's all toomuchtoosoontooquick and he tries to breathe to the chimes from the Big Ben that claw at his ears. </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">They are oppressive. Far too, if he is to be honest. Too full of men who have been told to never cry and women who have been told being a women in itself is degrading. Too full of teenagers whose friends are dead with a bullet in their head and others who would never leave their rooms if they could. </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">The streets are crowded, far too, and he pushes past tourists and ducks under outstretched arms. The leather soles of his boots slap against the concrete. Grey clouds gather above. </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">His dark dark eyes are strained forward, looking over shoulders and onto the stretching streets. There is a figure, glowing softly in the dying sunlight, winding through the crowds with a spectral mist around their blurred outline. The ghost is a girl, young, a teenager, he guesses, and her hair falls in gentle waves and a tattered flannel shirt is tied around her waist. She glances behind, and for a second, a fleeting moment he barely notices, their eyes lock and his dark dark irises meet her ghostly silver eyes. </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">Then she smiles, and maybe it means nothing, maybe it's a test, and her head tilts upwards and he can see the long scar along her neck. Maybe it means nothing, maybe it's a test, but nonetheless, his feet move without his mind and he's pushing through the crowd as he breaks into a run. </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">-</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">She looks younger as grows closer, fifteen maybe, like himself. Her boots barely touch the wet pavement as she darts into an alley nearby, and like a shadow he follows, dark, unruly hair spilling from the black beanie on his head. </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">For a second, the ghost keeps her eyes on her feet, fingers entwining and smile quickly dropping. “I know who you are,” she says, and her voice is silvery and sweet and dipped in honey, spilling from her lips as though they are poison disguised with sugar and spices. </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">“I would hope so,” the boy says, and he outstretches a slender hand and looks at her under dark lashes. The ghost shakes her head, eyes finally meeting his.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">“I know who you are,” she repeats, swallowing thickly, but this time her words aren't honeyed and instead broken by fear and anxiety, and his eyes narrow and his outstretched hand drops to his side. “And I -we- need you help.” </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">“What? What are you talking about.” He frowns as he speaks, and a finger reaches up to the girl’s -ghost's- chin, tilting it upwards to search her eyes looking anywhere but at him. “Who are you?” He adds, after a moment, and when she doesn't reply the hand under her chin moves to run through his raven-coloured hair, dislodging his hair from the beanie even further. </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">Eventually, after what could have been a minute, or a second, maybe, it is hard to tell, the ghost speaks. “I’m a...witch. Was, I guess.” She laughs bitterly, hollowly, and the boy’s dark dark eyes focus on her once more. “And there's a man, no not a man, a monster,” she continues, her voice shaking a little, as his eyes widen slightly. “And, he's back, oh god, he's back, and he's going to kill- he's going to kill us all. If you- if you don't do anything!” </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">She grabs fistfulls of her tattered sweater. “We’re scared. All of us, but- but, they have been saying things, the other ghosts.” Her smoky eyes trail over his face and the scars on his skin. “They’ve been talking about you, about this boy that is the son of a god and they’ve been saying things. Saying that you could help and you would and- and. They’ve been saying you can save me, us all. And-” </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">“Excuse me, what?” The boy crosses his arms over his chest. “Who's been saying these? Other wizards?” They aren't a foreign concept, of course. Plenty of them pass through the Underworld, mostly delusional and muttering about a man with glowing red eyes and a snake like nose. Delusional mutterings, of course. But this girl doesn't seem crazy and her fear seems so very real. </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">She nods stiffly. “I know this isn't your problem. I know you aren't one of us. I know I know I know.” She sighs, eyes dropping to her feet again, and the boy stays silent. “But, people are dying. I died because of him.” </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">With a bony finger she points to the scar on her neck. “Slit my throat, you see. Tried to make it seem like suicide. The killing curse doesn't leave a mark. That's suspicious. He needed to cover it up.” She laughs again, bitterly, sounding as though there is a fish bone in her throat and a knife against her tongue. </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">“Why me?” </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">The question is simple. Plain. Short. And the words are spoken fast and bordering on cold. “You could have chosen anyone. Percy. Annabeth. Jason. Even Leo goddamn Valdez. They’re much better heroes than me, don't you get it?” </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">“No,” the ghost says and the tug on her lips looks almost amused. “Don't you get it. You're not like them. You're a little more...let's say, morally grey. You’ve had more experience with the...darker things in life.” She throws her hands into the air. “You’ve dealt with things like this before. You can do it again.” </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">The certainty in her voice is startling, and her eyes seem to glow brighter with each word, silvery and demanding. Hoping. In return, the boy nods. “Okay. Sure, I guess.” He breathes deeply, eyes fluttering shut in defeat. “What do I have to do?” </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">For a second, the ghost looks as though she wants to laugh, maybe cry, maybe scream, and she throws her smoky arms around his neck, burrowing her head into his shoulder. Immediately, he stiffens, eyes widening with panic, heartbeat quickening. But she doesn't seem to notice and when she finally releases him she steps back and in the golden sunlight streaking through the clouds her eyes shimmer with what is unmistakably tears. The golden lights are like glitter on her skin, painting her in little shards of silver glass that reflect the sunlight.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">“Thank you,” she gasps. And then she's talking in such a fast tone that the boy must read her lips to understand what she is saying. “You need to go to The Leaky Cauldron. It's here, in London, just, just concentrate and you should see it. Turn left out of this alley.” </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">“Okay, then-.”</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">“Speak to the bartender, Tom. Ask to send a letter. Just, make up a sad story, then he should let you send it for free. But send it to Dumbledore, headmaster at Hogwarts, but I guess you already know that. Lie. Make up a story. Get enrolled into Hogwarts.” </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">Her eyes search his face, suddenly panicked, suddenly wary. Her form flicker a little, spectral mist dimming, the golden light no longer glitter on her skin. “I'm running out of time. Just, just, read some books, learn a bit so that you don't seem to out of place. You’re technically magical, you’ll do fine.”</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">Then suddenly, she grabs onto his wrist, and her fingers are cold like his own but somehow they don't feel as though they are there at all.“I must go. Remember what you must do, Son of Hades.” </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">And with that, with hastily choked out words, with frantic eyes and even more so words, she grabs tighter onto his wrist, as she fades into nothingness, golden glitter no longer dancing in her skin. As though she was never there at all. </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">And left stood alone in the alleyway, Nico di Angelo feels more confused than ever. </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">-x-</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">Nico walks the streets alone. The darkness falls thick and heavy around him, footsteps silent against the pavements, breath clouding in the cold air. He tilts back his head, pulling the beanie from his hair and stuffing it in his pocket, and letting his eyes roam across the clear skies and constellations of stars. </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">He walks the streets alone, slinking into the shadows and melting into the darkness. His dark dark eyes strain, though seeing almost perfectly through the dark, and his eyelids weigh heavy on his face. </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">Turn left out of this alley.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">He did, turned left from the alley that is littered with dumpsters and polluted with smoke and riddled with rubbish, and then began to tread down the empting streets where the slight rain is illuminated by the orange glow of street-lights. Frustrated, he pushes his palms onto his forehead, breath clouding when he sighs deeply. </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">His eyes narrow, and then, under the glow of the streetlights, he sees it. It doesn't look like much, at first glance, and the anxiety and doubt hits him suddenly, like a tsunami with little warning, harsh emotion like the waves crashing onto the cliffs. </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">The paint is peeling from the walls and the windows are steamed up and grubby, but he suppresses his grimace and stands behind the door, hand hovering over the worn handle.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">But eventually, he pushes open the door and slips through the gap, before shutting it behind himself with a gentle click. He pulls down his black hood. The bartender, Tom, glances up at him. </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">“What can I get you?” He asks, and his voice is gruff and low and Nico finds his lips tightening a little. He steps forward to the bar. “Drink? Food?” </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">“I was wondering, actually,” he says, and he notices that Tom glances down at the silver ring in his finger, then averts his eyes to meet Nico's own. His dark dark eyes seem to startle him. “If I can send a letter, Sir” </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">“Sure -”</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">Nico interrupts with a small, but noticeable sigh. “I'm sorry, Sir, but I’ve come from America, you see, and I have no money. Is there any chance I can earn a little money, just until September when I go to Hogwarts.” He hangs his head, if only to hide the small smirk on his lips.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">He hears Tom grunt noncommittally. “I 'suppose there are a few things you could do for me, until Hogwarts starts.” Nico looks at him through a curtain of raven hair. </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">“Oh, thank you, sir.”</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">Tom chuckles quietly. “No need to call me sir, boy, but I must ask, where are your parents.”</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">Nico scuffs his feet on the dirty floor. “Oh, erm, they died a while back, so my aunt was homeschooling me. She talked about Hogwarts a lot, you know. And then she died.” The words drip from his lips like a leaky faucet. </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">Tom’s eyes burn into his neck, and he hears him shuffle from foot to foot awkwardly. “Tell you what, don’t worry about the letter, I'll get it covered. Go to the top floor, there’s some owls and parchment and quills. Come see me about some work after, yeah?” </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">“Oh, thank you!” Nico curls his lips into a smile, fake, but a smile nonetheless. He turns away, and the floorboards creak underneath his weight when he walks away. Like he had done so so many times before. </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">-</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">The owls are afraid. He doesn't blame them. Of course they are. They can smell death, the scent that lingers around him, the one that makes others anxious when they are around him for reasons even they do not know. He smells of death. Looks like it to.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">He is tired, so very very tired. Tired of the running and talking and lying and watching everyone walk away from him, and exhausted from so many sleepless night where he is too afraid to close his eyes in fear of what he may see in the dark. </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">Funny, isn't it. The son of Hades afraid of the dark. </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">And the owls, they are afraid, and when he writes his letter he can feel amber eyes on him, wide and waiting and wary, as if expecting him to attack. Anytime. Anywhere. </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">He meets their stares with dark dark eyes. </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">The letter is short, plain, simple, built on his tragic past and elegant script. After a short struggle, he manages to attach it to the leg of the largest of the owls, the one that seems the least afraid as it ruffles it flecked feathers and meets his gaze with burning eyes.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">It's eyes are like wildfire. Dangerous. And uncontrollable. Raging flames and smoldering embers. Blackened coals and swirling smoke. It's feathers are similar too, deep red, like the blood in his veins, but somehow more deadly, darker, dangerous. </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">“Thank you,” he says to no one in particular, fingers threading through his hair as he descends the steps to the pub. The air is damp, sticking to his skin like his jacket does his arms.</p><p dir="ltr">He passes old doors and creaking floorboards, and he absentmindedly swipes his finger over the dust on the banister. Tom’s waiting for him when he reaches the bar. </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">“You done?” He asks, and Nico can imagine his gravelly voice scratching the back of his throat the way it scratches his skin. Bloody. Red. Raw. </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">“Yeah.”</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">“'Been thinking,” Tom says, and Nico bites down on his tongue to stop his remark slipping through his dry chapped lips. Bit dangerous, don't you think. “In exchange for a bit 'a cleaning here and there and a few odd jobs, I'll let you stay in a spare room 'til Hogwarts starts.”</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">Nico nods, far too enthusiastically, but Tom doesn't notice and his eyes are on Nico’s silver ring again. His finger slides forward a bit, almost daring, almost challenging, Tom to take it. There is a glint in his eyes, bright, artificial, like lights in a hospital when the outside world is dark. Daring. Challenging. </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">“That's great, thank you sir.” </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">And the moment is gone. Tom’s eyes are back to his face and his own are dark and endless. </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">-</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">He is a stranger here, roaming the streets behind the pub alone, lit only by the glowing flames as darkness descends on the streets. His hands are in his pockets, and his eyes are straight ahead. </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">A woman walks, almost impossibly light hair glinting in the light, with a boy with the same platinum hair, shoulders back and their chins held up and their steps long and purposeful. Even with the distance, he can hear them speaking, their posh, accented voices ringing through his ears. </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">“-and then I said, 'Suzanna, darling, who knows what that son of yours has been up to. Deviant thing, isn't he?” Then she laughs, and her laugh is cold and metallic and dripping through perfectly glossed lips like poison from a snake's fang.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">“Very exciting, mother,” the boy says, and his words spill through privileges and money, a big house, golden chains, silver plates. Like poison dripping from a snake’s fang. </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">Nico's steps speed up, and soon he is only metres behind the woman and her son, and what's that, almost spilling from her snakeskin handbag? Gold. Silver. Bronze. Gleaming in the fire light. So close; if he could just step a little bit closer, hand outstretched, fingers nimble and light, he can snag it. She won't notice, of course. The rings on her fingers probably hold more worth than himself.</p><p dir="ltr"> What's a little less gold when it's piled up at home, an arms length away, blurring the line between rich and filthy rich. </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">He takes his chance, and his slender fingers curl around the bag of money, pulling gently, lifting gently, breathing gently. And then, he's running, the bag cold against his fingertips, footsteps echoing through the streets. </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">-</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">When he steps into the Leaky Cauldron again, sweat beading on his neck, but his face as placid as ever, Tom’s waiting, a letter held between his thick fingers. He takes a seat by the bar, an elegant brow raised. </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">“This is for you, I think,” Tom says. </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">Nico plucks the letter from his fingers and his fingertips brush over the wax seal on the back. Red. Scarlet. Crafted in elegance. </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">“What makes you say that?” He mutters under his breath, staring down at his name written in perfect, cursive golden letters on the front, a small smile dancing on his lips. </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">“Thank you, sir,” he says, and his finger breaks the scarlet wax seal.</p>
