    <p>It was three days after Albus had found the young man on the shores of the Lake that he brought the boy to headquarters. The first day the boy had been unconscious and unresponsive to any of the treatments Poppy had tried, to the point where she'd decided that it would be best to see if he would wake up on his own before trying anything more invasive. She'd had a point, and sure enough, the boy woke up on the following day.</p>
<p>The polite interrogation he'd given the young man had quite possibly been the most fascinating and terrifying discussion he'd ever held with anyone. At first he'd simply assumed that the boy was touched in the head, but he knew of the Muggles' theories of multiple universes, and the young man had given no indications of mental instability bar the fantastical tale he told. Having read several books about Sherlock Holmes, Albus had to agree with the Muggle detective; however impossible young William Kaplan's story seemed, it had to be true.</p>
<p>So now he stood outside number 12 Grimmauld Place, handing a piece of paper to the young witch (and wasn't that amusing, the differences in terminology across universes), who regarded him with amused wariness.</p>
<p>“I can feel the magic here,” said William. “It's something big, isn't it? If you hadn't told me I wouldn't have felt it. It's like it's trying to avoid being noticed.” He took the paper, but didn't read it immediately.</p>
<p>“Indeed it is,” answered Albus with a small chuckle. “Now read that note and you'll find out what it is.”</p>
<p>William raised a dubious eyebrow but unfolded the note. He gasped as he read the short message, undoubtedly feeling the magic taking hold. He looked up to the building and breathed a low “Wow.”</p>
<p>“Precisely,” said Albus. “Now shall we?” He gestured to the door.</p>
<p>“Yeah! Um, I mean, yes,” said William with a slight flush.</p>
<p>“Don't worry about being excited, William,” smiled Albus. “Now remember, no loud noises until we're past the entrance hall.”</p>
<p>“Don't worry.”</p>
<p>“I wasn't.” Albus led them into the dining room, where most of the Order had already gathered. “Good afternoon, everyone,” greeted Albus.</p>
<p>“Professor Dumbledore!” exclaimed Molly, followed by several “Hello”s and “Professor”s from the rest of the crew. “You're early.”</p>
<p>“I thought it best to be early so we could get introductions over with before anything else.” And just like that all eyes were suddenly on young William rather than on Albus himself. To William's credit, he just smiled at them.</p>
<p>“Hi. I'm William Kaplan, call me Billy,” said he. The Order members rather stumbled over each other to introduce themselves, with the rather notable exception of Severus. And Mundungus, though that was probably because the man was snoring beside his glass.</p>
<p>“Doesn't he look a bit young?” whispered Molly to her husband, and Albus smiled. So motherly, and so concerned about others, she was such a sweet woman. Arthur whispered back to her:</p>
<p>“I doubt Dumbledore would've brought him if he were underage.” Molly looked somewhat pacified by that, and soon the rush calmed. Albus looked over the gathered people. Only one was missing.</p>
<p>“Where's Sirius?” asked he.</p>
<p>Molly was quick to answer. “He's up feeding that hippogriff, he ought to be down any moment now.” She wrung her hands. “At least he should be.”</p>
<p>“Well, that's fine,” responded Albus. “We can wait then.”</p>

<p align="left">It was three days after Billy had disappeared that Tommy admitted to himself that he was worried. It wasn't like his sort-of little brother to disappear without warning and definitely not without Teddy (together with Teddy was a different story, but if they were going to be unreachable for long enough that it would be noticed, they usually left a message). The team – or rather the parts of the team they'd been able to get a hold off – had searched <em>everywhere</em> and Teddy had been beside himself with worry the whole time. Poor guy.</p>
<p align="left">Tommy on the other hand had been quite happy to not worry at all. That he did so now… well, that was clearly Teddy's fault. All of it, his worry was contagious. That was it.</p>
<p align="left">Right now, Tommy was running through the French Alps, aiming to pass through Nice for a five-minute-vacation before continuing his search. But really, he was starting to doubt that he would ever find Billy just by running around. After all, running around really fast hadn't done jack when they'd searched for the Scarlet Witch–</p>
<p align="left">Tommy skidded to a halt inches before he would've slammed into a cliff side. He drove a fist into the rock and turned on his heel, vacation plans forgotten. He took off in a different direction, only one thought on his mind.</p>
<p align="left">When he got to Latveria he better not find even a hint that Doom had anything at all to do with Billy's disappearance. For the man's own sake.</p>
<p align="center">,.-~¤O*'*O¤~-.,</p>
<p align="left">It was three days after waking to an empty bed that Teddy heard back from Doctor Strange. The letter, which had appeared right in front of Teddy while he'd been eating lunch, was long, flowery and basically amounted to <em>silly boy, I have better things to do </em><em>right now</em><em>, don't bother me</em><span>, or at least that was what Teddy got from it. It didn't exactly do wonders for his mood.</span></p>
<p align="left">Three days of frenetically searching for Billy had left Teddy nearly sick with worry, but Strange's letter had delivered that push that allowed worry to turn into anger. Grateful for his current surroundings, Teddy proceeded to take that anger out on the vast number of trees around him.</p>
<p align="left">
  <span>It was lucky that Kate's call </span>
  <span>came first after </span>
  <span>he'd channeled the majority of his rage into creating a new clearing in the forest. He probably would've risked crushing the phone before that.</span>
</p>
<p align="left">“<em>Teddy?</em><span>”</span></p>
<p align="left">“Yeah, Kate?”</p>
<p align="left">
  <span>There was a pause before </span>
  <span>Kate continued, more carefully this time. “</span>
  <em>Teddy? Something happen?</em>
  <span>”</span>
</p>
<p align="left">
  <span>Of course she'd heard something in his voice. She was </span>
  <em>Kate</em>
  <span>. “Strange got back to me.”</span>
</p>
<p align="left">“<em>No good news I take it? What did he say?</em><span>”</span></p>
<p align="left">“Buzz off.”</p>
<p align="left">“<em>...what.</em><span>”</span></p>
<p align="left">“In much nicer words, I'll give, but that's basically what I got from his letter.”</p>
<p align="left">
  <span>Teddy could practically see Kate biting back a curse. </span>
  <span>Then she let it out anyway. “</span>
  <em>Damn. That was one of our best chances.</em>
  <span>” She sighed. “</span>
  <em>I suppose it was too much to hope for that both of us would have good news.</em>
  <span>”</span>
</p>
<p align="left">
  <span>Hi</span>
  <span>s heart beat faster. “You have good news?” And okay, that was a pathetically hopeful tone.</span>
</p>
<p align="left">“<em>More like good and I don't really know. You should get back here.</em><span>”</span></p>
<p align="left">“I'm on my way.” He looked back at his half-eaten lunch, which had somehow survived his rage without a scratch. He wasn't that hungry anymore. “Good news first, please.”</p>
<p align="left">“<em>America finally called me. Something about bad reception is why she's not called before. </em><em>She's not found anything, but considering the places she's been looking, I'm counting it as a good thing.</em><span>”</span></p>
<p align="left">Teddy breathed out slowly. “I suppose I can agree with that,” said he. “And the 'you don't know' news?”</p>
<p align="left">“<em>Tommy texted me. He's checking out a lead he hopes won't pan out.</em><span>”</span></p>
<p align="left">“Well that sounds ominous.” Kate didn't respond. “Kate? Kate, where is he?”</p>
<p align="left">
  <span>He was about to ask again when Kate breathed out, “</span>
  <em>Latveria.</em>
  <span>”</span>
</p>
<p align="left">Teddy dropped his phone.</p>
<p align="center">,.-~¤O*'*O¤~-.,</p>
<p align="left">
  <span>It was three days after his arrival in this strange universe that Billy </span>
  <span>first made it out of the bed in Hogwarts' hospital wing. </span>
  <span>According to </span>
  <span>Professor </span>
  <span>“Call me Albus” Dumbledore, he'd spent the first day unconscious and a good part of the second day too tired to do more than have a glass of water. It had been first t</span>
  <span>oward</span>
  <span> the evening of the second day he'd been able to stay awake long enough </span>
  <span>to have a conversation.</span>
</p>
<p align="left">And what a conversation it had been.</p>
<p align="left">
  <span>A school of magic! That was probably the most amazing thing about this universe he'd landed in. It had in fact almost overshadowed the worry that came with the realization that he'd </span>
  <span>l</span>
  <span>anded in a different universe </span>
  <span>with no </span>
  <span>way to get back. Okay, sure, </span>
  <span>if he tried – really tried – </span>
  <span>he could probably </span>
  <span>force down whatever barrier there was between here and home, </span>
  <span>but you didn't have to be a rocket scientist to figure out what a bad idea that was </span>
  <span>(</span>
  <span>t</span>
  <span>hough Billy kind of doubted that the average rocket scientist </span>
  <em>actually</em>
  <span> knew the devastation that could be caused by such an action).</span>
</p>
<p align="left">Then Albus had explained the situation in this world, where a terrorist ran around, calling himself a Lord while the government turned a blind eye to him because they were afraid to lose their own power. So what if the guy had been dead for a while? He was back now so they should be doing something, not just sit around with their thumbs up their asses. But maybe Billy was a bit harsh on them, it seemed like dying and then coming back wasn't as usual in this universe.</p>
<p align="left">Still, there was some heavy duty denial going on.</p>
<p align="left">
  <span>Albus had invited Billy to a meeting of people who were apparently trying to make a stand against this Lord Volde-whatsit, which Billy had been glad to accept, </span>
  <span>even if it was more because he didn't know what else to do here other than try to find a way back home that didn't mean tearing down the dimensional barriers. The house the meeting was held in was concealed by some really interesting and intricate spell work. If Albus hadn't warned him about some 'special charms' on the building Billy wouldn't have noticed it at all. It was as though it had been made specifically to avoid attention.</span>
</p>
<p align="left">
  <span>T</span>
  <span>he people inside were all rather friendly, Billy supposed. </span>
  <span>A bit odd, some of them, but on the whole they were nice. </span>
  <span>He sat a bit awkwardly next to Remus Lupin, a worn-looking man probably in his late thirties or early forties, </span>
  <span>and listened to the man making small-talk with a young woman with pink hair. Tonks, he thought it was.</span>
</p>
<p align="left">The door opened and a man sauntered in. “The dog's in the house,” crowed the man with a grin. “I see everyone's here soo-o-ooh, new face!” He homed in on Billy. “I'm Sirius Black, owner of this delightful little house of horror.”</p>
<p align="left">“<span>Billy Kaplan,” responded Billy, “</span><span>Nice to meet you.”</span></p>
<p align="left">“<span>Bloody hell, you're a yank!” exclaimed Sirius, jerking in surprise. Then he blushed. In the background, Molly Weasley – Wesley? – </span><span>h</span><span>issed “Language!”</span></p>
<p align="left">Billy snorted. “I prefer American, but I suppose that's close enough.”</p>
<p align="left">Sirius coughed in his fist. “Sorry,” muttered he.</p>
<p align="left">“It's fine,” smiled Billy. Sirius sat down.</p>
<p align="left">“Now that we're all here,” said Albus, “I would suggest that we get to business. Dedalus, I seem to recall you had something important...”</p>
<p align="left">
  <span>Billy did his best to follow the discussions, but there was so many new things – names, places, organizations – that he ended up lost before too long. </span>
  <span>Still, he listened attentively </span>
  <span>and, as he could've guessed, after </span>
  <span>all </span>
  <span>the serious subjects had been dealt with, his name entered the </span>
  <span>conversation.</span>
</p>
<p align="left">“<span>So, Kaplan, was it? </span><span>Why did you come here? What reason do you have to fight?” </span><span>It was </span><span>the man named Moody who spoke. </span></p>
<p align="left">
  <span>T</span>
  <span>he questions had Billy pause. </span>
  <span>Albus had wanted him to tell the truth, but he had said he would respect Billy's decision to keep it secret if it came to that. Honestly, Billy didn't want to trust blindly, but </span>
  <span>he didn't have a good lie prepared. </span>
</p>
<p align="left">“<span>Personal reasons.”</span></p>
<p align="left">“<span>Hmph.” Moody frowned, but seemed content with the answer. Albus inclined his head slightly, accepting Billy's choice. Then he stood up.</span></p>
<p align="left">“<span>If there was nothing else…?” prompted he. </span><span>A general </span><em>no</em><span> chorused over the table. </span><span>Billy bit down on a </span><em>“</em><em>y</em><em>ou promised me magic books”</em><span> because that would just be rude. And childish. </span><span>Albus had promised though and h</span><span>e still wanted to get his hands on those books. “</span><span>Then I'll have to take my leave,” continued Albus. “</span><span>Sirius, would you happen to have a room for William? At least for a few months?”</span></p>
<p align="left">
  <span>Sirius bit his lip. “Might have to clean </span>
  <span>'em </span>
  <span>up a bit, but I've </span>
  <span>still </span>
  <span>got a few.”</span>
</p>
<p align="left">“<span>Great! </span><span>William, I hope you'll think on my offer. I'm sure Sirius will be happy to show you the library after you've got a room. Some books may be cursed, so look out.”</span></p>
<p align="left">“<span>I'll have an answer by next week,” smiled Billy, “and </span><span>I think I can handle some books.”</span></p>
<p align="left">“Still, some of those curses are very obscure. Anything you're unsure of would probably be best left alone.”</p>
<p align="left">
  <span>Albus left </span>
  <span>and several people followed in his wake. </span>
  <span>Across from Billy, Sirius stood up.</span>
</p>
<p align="left">“C'mon kid, let's find you a room.”</p>
<p align="left">“<span><span>S</span></span><span><span>ure.” Billy followed Sirius </span></span><span><span>out the door and up the stairs. </span></span><span><span>There stood a number of </span></span><span><span>children</span></span><span><span>, the eldest of them probably only about a year or so younger than Billy. </span></span><span><span>A</span></span><span><span>ll </span></span><span><span>but one</span></span><span><span> ha</span></span><span><span>d</span></span><span><span> red hair </span></span><span><span>and they all looked at Sirius as though he held the answers to the universe. </span></span></p>
<p align="left">“You gonna tell us anything?”</p>
<p align="left">“<span>W</span><span>e didn't hear a </span><span>word</span><span>.”</span></p>
<p align="left">“<span>Who're </span><em>you</em><span>?”</span></p>
<p align="left">
  <span>The last was directed to Billy. </span>
  <span>It was </span>
  <span>the </span>
  <span>red-h</span>
  <span>aired</span>
  <span> girl who asked. </span>
  <span>The other red-heads (her brothers, </span>
  <span>Billy guessed</span>
  <span>) </span>
  <span>threw him a look.</span>
</p>
<p align="left">“<span>Billy Kaplan,” </span><span>said Billy, </span><span>feeling a bit </span><span>repetitive </span><span>with how much he'd already introduced himself</span><span>. “</span><span>You live here?”</span></p>
<p align="left">“<span>Not usually, but yes. Ginny Weasley.”</span></p>
<p align="left">
  <span>B</span>
  <span>illy leaned over the railing a little awkwardly, shaking her hand. Sirius seemed to get the hint and moved away from the top of the stairs, letting Billy come up. The other kids introduced themselves as well. Ron, George and Fred were </span>
  <span>indeed</span>
  <span> Ginny's brothers while Hermione Granger was a friend. </span>
  <span>They seemed set to interrogate Billy but Sirius put a quick stop to that by insisting to show Billy to a room. </span>
</p>
<p align="left">
  <span>The room itself was nothing to boast about. It was messy, dusty and probably not lived in for at least a decade. Billy declined the offer of cleaning-aid; he'd have it fixed in moments so bothering other people wasn't a priority. Sirius still insisted to “get rid of some of the dust at least”, with a wave of a wand and a muttered “Scorugify”. Billy tried not to stare too much at the demonstration of this dimension's magic. Sirius didn't notice, so he counted it as a success.</span>
</p>
<p align="left">
  <span>Sirius left the room, presumably to speak with the kids. Billy waited for half a minute before he murmured a spell and the room shifted to his desires. He breathed out slowly and stumbled over to the bed. Finally alone again, the reality of his situation dawned upon him with renewed severity and he collapsed on the bed in exhausted resignation. </span>
  <span>He hugged the pillow close and shut his eyes, again whispering the spell that had not worked the night before.</span>
