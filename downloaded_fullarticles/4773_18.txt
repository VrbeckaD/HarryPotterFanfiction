    <p>Chapter One</p>
<p>Sirius Black slowly looked around him, trying to find his destination in the rain. The clouds blocked the half moon that was out that night and the street he was on had very few lamps. Sirius figured that may have been on purpose. He reached into his pocket and felt the smooth metal key that he'd been given a few weeks prior. He'd gotten it from an old acquaintance while he was in Monaco along with some very cryptic directions. The wizard insisted that if he was returning to London, this particular entertainment was right up his alley.</p>
<p>Sirius had been living it up since the war ended. He'd spent over a decade in Azkaban for a crime he didn't commit and was only free for what felt like a minute before he was shoved into the Veil. His time in the Veil was better than the prison, but only because he couldn't recall much of it. He did remember his cunt of a cousin Bellatrix shooting an Avada Kedavra at him without hesitation.  As the spell hit him, he felt the mist in the Veil reach out for him.  Sirius wasn’t sure why, but the Veil pulled him in and arrested the progression of the curse, holding him in suspension.  Regardless of why, it was a whole lot of nothing happening to him for years.  When that bitch Bella was killed, the magic of her spell evaporated and the Veil released its hold on him. All of a sudden and without warning, Sirius was spit out. He'd missed the fights, the battles - all of it.  Sirius felt left out and useless.  Not one to dwell on unpleasant feelings, Sirius threw himself into the reconstruction efforts.  Once that was done, Sirius watched all his friends settle back into their lives.  </p>
<p>Sirius wasn’t particularly interested in settling down since he had spent so much time confined.  So he traveled.  In the past four years, he’s circumvented the globe three times.  He lay on beaches, climbed mountains, explored caves, and went diving for lost treasure.  He went to hot new clubs, casinos, and restaurants; making friends where ever he went.  Sirius did try to return home a few times each year. He visited with his friends, though he was never out of touch. Sirius was a surprisingly good correspondent. London still felt like home, no matter where he went. He'd even had Grimmauld Place thoroughly renovated.  Hardly anyone recognized the Black ancestral home anymore. Kreacher didn't survive long after the war ended and Sirius hired a pair of nice free elves to look after the place.  Well, to be fair, a certain Muggle-born witch with a passion for elf rights found them, interviewed them, and brought the pair to his house; but Sirius did hire them.  </p>
<p>Sirius finally noticed a door, such a deep, dark forest green that it initially looked black in the night. A small brass plaque next to the door read Emerald Cabaret. Sirius tried the handle, but it didn't budge. He chuckled at himself as he fished the key out of his pocket.  He was told this place didn't advertise and no one could get in without a key.  How intriguing, he thought as he tapped the key to the handle and watched the door silently glide open.</p>
<p>Sirius stepped into a very small room that was mirrored on both sides. Ahead of him was a very striking, tall blonde witch dressed in a low cut emerald green, sequined evening gown. She stood at a substantial ebony podium and behind her was a dark green velvet curtain. Sirius imagined that his destination was in the other side of the curtain.</p>
<p>"Good evening, sir." The witch smiled politely. "May I have your name?"</p>
<p>"It is a good evening," Sirius responded, flashing his best smile. The witch didn't swoon, which was unusual. "I'm Sirius Black. An acquaintance of mine gave me this in Monaco."</p>
<p>He held up the key, but the witch didn't seem to care about it one way or the other.</p>
<p>"Just a moment, Mr. Black," she said. She lifted her wand and tapped a large silver metal disk. He saw his name flash on it and then disappear as it sank into the metal.</p>
<p>Apparently, the key would just get you in the door. Sirius wondered for the first time who owned this club and if they were in charge of vetting people for admission. After about thirty seconds, the disc glowed green and the witch's smile widened just slightly.</p>
<p>"Welcome to Emerald, Mr. Black."  Sirius felt her smile was genuine now. She stepped to the curtain and drew it aside.</p>
<p>Sirius could feel the excitement welling inside him. He couldn't see into the darkness on the other side, but that was part of what was making him so giddy. He grinned at the hostess with boyish glee and she just nodded knowingly to him.</p>
<p>"Enjoy yourself," he heard her say as he ventured through the curtain.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Sirius turned a corner and barely had a moment to take in his surroundings before a young wizard in black ushered him to a small table. The wizard asked if he would care for refreshment and Sirius got the distinct impression that whatever food or beverage he requested would be provided.</p>
<p>"The best firewhisky you have that’s already open," Sirius replied. It was only after the wizard nodded and left that he wondered if he should've amended his order to something like, the best firewhisky under twenty galleons.  He shrugged and dismissed the thought. He had plenty of money and it would be interesting to see what they had at this particular establishment. It would be another piece of data to help him understand this mystery place.</p>
<p>Sirius turned his attention to the room and the stage. A heavy emerald velvet curtain covered the stage, which seemed like it was a good size for the room.  Sirius focused on the other patrons for a moment.</p>
<p>Tables ranged in size, seating single wizards, couples, and large groups. He wasn't the only wizard there alone, but most people brought company. There were more witches there than he'd anticipated, but that was likely because he hadn't expected any. A number of the patrons were relatively young, about Harry's age he guessed, and those were the larger groups. Sirius grinned to himself thinking what he and his follow Marauders would've made of a place like this in their youth, quickly deciding it was probably better that they'd never been to a gentleman's club. Overall, it was a good mix of magical folks. The common thread throughout the audience was the clear presence of money, old and new. Sirius had a talent for recognizing designer robes and real jewels. There was not a single knock-off garment or glass 'diamond' in the room.</p>
<p>"Our best whisky," an amused female voice said as she slid the glass in front of him.  </p>
<p>"Ginny Weasley!" Sirius could not have been more surprised. He stood and hugged the redhead tightly. "It's been so long! Let me look at you!"</p>
<p>Sirius took a step back and Ginny beamed at him. He'd seen her last year and she looked generally the same, cute and fit. Her long red hair now had noticeable streaks of gold, but the biggest change was her clothing.</p>
<p>"I don't think I've seen you in a dress more than a handful of times," Sirius laughed. "You look stunning!"</p>
<p>Ginny blushed and motioned for him to sit, joining him at the other seat at his table.</p>
<p>"It's nice to swap jeans and trainers or Quidditch gear for a dress once in a while," she smiled. The black cocktail dress with the flared crinoline skirt managed to look sweet and sophisticated, or so Sirius thought.</p>
<p>Sirius nodded in agreement and sipped his firewhisky.</p>
<p>"Damn," he muttered, looking down at his glass. This drink was exceptional; one of the best he'd ever had. There was no way it was going to be cheap. "This is good."</p>
<p>"It better be at thirty five galleons a glass," Ginny laughed. Sirius almost choked on the precious liquid. "Next time don't order the best unless you're prepared for the consequences."</p>
<p>"It is good," Sirius grinned, "But maybe only for special occasions in the future."</p>
<p>"It's on the house," she replied easily. Sirius arched his brow in question. "I work here."</p>
<p>Sirius blanched slightly as he looked between the covered stage and the baby daughter of some of his oldest friends. He didn't know if he would be able to stay for the show.</p>
<p>"Not on stage, Sirius!" Ginny laughed, swatting him on the arm. "I assist with talent scouting and am the primary choreographer for the club."</p>
<p>Sirius felt relieved. All that was fine with him and he very much wanted to see the show, so much so that he considered watching his friends' daughter in a state of undress.</p>
<p>"I thought you worked for the Holyhead Harpies," Sirius said, sipping his drink. Ginny didn't write him often, but Harry wrote very newsy letters on a regular basis.</p>
<p>"Oh I still do," Ginny explained. "During the off season, there isn't too much to do and my assistant coach job is really just part time even in season.  I have time for both really."</p>
<p>"I'm surprised no one mentioned this in letters." Sirius was fishing. Did everyone know of her job?</p>
<p>"The club has only been open for a bit over six months and Mum hasn't decided how she feels about it yet.  She won't let any of the boys come until she decides if this is demeaning or empowering for the ladies in the show," Ginny said, rolling her eyes a bit.</p>
<p>"I'm going to vote for empowering!" Sirius smiled, raising his glass and making Ginny laugh aloud.</p>
<p>"Besides, no one in my family has the cash for this place," Ginny smirked.</p>
<p>"Tell me about this place, would you?" Sirius all but demanded. He was curious when his acquaintance had given him the key, and the curiosity increased for every moment he'd been inside.  From the hostess, who didn't fall for an ounce of his considerable charm, to the best fire whiskey he'd ever had, to the young witch sitting next to him, this place was nothing he was used to.</p>
<p>"The Emerald Cabaret opened earlier this year and is Wizarding Britain's premier establishment for adult entertainment." Ginny looked proud as she gave her spiel, which made Sirius smile.  He already knew he'd tell her it was great even if it were shite. "We are part burlesque, part gentlemen's club, and part variety show.  It'll start in five minutes.  I’ll let you see the acts for yourself, so you can be surprised.  We have shows Friday and Saturday nights each month, but we’re thinking about adding some special shows around holidays."</p>
<p>"You don't charge an entrance fee?"</p>
<p>"Oh no," Ginny shook her head. "This is a member’s only establishment.  Members pay a monthly fee or can pay for the entire year at a five percent reduction.  Members get their own key, four guest passes per month, and three guest keys to give out to others. As you know, the guest key will get you in the door but you still need to be approved by management. If the person you gave a key to goes on to become a member, you get fifty percent off of your dues for the next month."</p>
<p>"Ah," Sirius said, understanding why an acquaintance had given him a key. "That's cunning. What are the monthly membership dues?"</p>
<p>Ginny's grin turned absolutely devilish.</p>
<p>"Just a measly hundred galleons a month."</p>
<p>Sirius nearly choked on his drink again. A hundred galleons was expensive and a hundred a month for a year was more than a top of the line broom. It was five hundred pounds a month in Muggle money!  All for some naked ladies dancing?</p>
<p>"That is steep, Gin!"</p>
<p>"People seem to think it’s worth it," she smirked, gesturing at the full room. The low lights dimmed even further and a spotlight shone on the stage. "We're about to begin. I may have to be up and down a bit, but you can't leave until you tell me what you think about the show. And I want your honest opinion, Sirius!"</p>
<p>Sirius watched Ginny for a moment, practically bouncing in her seat. The fact that the young witch was so proud of her work made his heart swell a bit. Her generation had gone through so much and deserved ever ounce of positive feeling they could get their hands on. He was almost distracted from the beginning of the show. Almost.</p>
<p>** Right Round by Flo Rida**<br/>
A thumping fast paced bass filled the room.  As the singer said, “you spin me right round, baby right round,” the heavy curtain parted.  There were two staircases coming down from the sides to rear center stage. Behind where the steps ended was a platform with a pole on it. There were two more poles near the front of the stage, one on each side.  As a female singer repeated the lyrics, four women began descending the stairs, two on each side. They were scantily clad in nearly sheer, sparkling green mini dresses and all wore astonishingly high silver heels.  They all wore the same chin-length blonde bob that Sirius assumed was charmed to make them look uniform. Their steps were perfectly in sync and they created a line in the center of the stage, rhythmically moving to the song.</p>
<p>Sirius had to admit the dancing was very good. The song was so fast paced that they moved quickly and he didn't want to look away, for fear he'd miss it.  His mind briefly acknowledged that Ginny was the one responsible for the moves, but chose instead to focus on the ladies on a stage bending and twisting in delightful ways that showed off their long legs, round bums, and full cleavage.  All of a sudden the singer said, “from the top of the pole, I watch her go down,” and three very scantily clad witches twisted down the poles on stage. It was very impressive the way they spun and bent, each in an emerald green string bikini. Shortly after the pole dancers appeared, the other four on stage each untied a ribbon that caused their mini dresses to pool at their feet; leaving them in green satin bras and g-strings. Sirius loved it. He chuckled when the singer said something about spending money out of control; this was certainly the place for it. All seven ladies on stage lost their tops and Sirius began to think this place may be worth the membership fee.</p>
<p>When the song ended, the crowd cheered and Sirius was certainly among them. Another song, an instrumental came on and the seven witches came down off the stage and fanned out into the crowd. All they wore were those heels and g-strings at this point. None of them appeared to be self-conscious as they smiled and worked their way through the crowd, running hands over some patrons, flirting and giving little kisses on cheeks or foreheads. One with particularly pert breasts stopped near him, winked, and said, "Welcome."</p>
<p>Sirius grinned and winked back. It would've been rude not to. He was watching the pert witch go, so he missed the wizard coming on stage.</p>
<p>"Welcome to Emerald," the dashing wizard told the crowd, a charm clearly amplifying his voice. The velvet curtain was again closed, but he stood in front of it. "Do not worry ladies and gentleman, the lovely witches of Emerald will return to entertain us.  As always, I am your host for the evening, Blaise Zabini.  I can assure you that we have an outstanding lineup this evening, everything your beautiful hearts can desire as well as some other body parts I'm sure.  Your enjoyment and entertainment are our priority here at Emerald."</p>
<p>The next act was Sammy, the Amazing Magical Squib, which was actually very entertaining.  Ginny explained that Sammy used 'magic' tricks he'd learned from Muggles. The bloke was funny and Sirius really had no idea how he did those tricks. He wasn't the only one either. The crowd was enthralled when he seemed to cut the lovely topless witch in half and then put her back together.</p>
<p>After Sammy was an impressive pair of contortionists.  The fact that they were attractive and scantily clad was a delightful bonus. Zabini came out between each act, talking and making jokes. He kept it classy, but a little lewd. Sirius appreciated the combination.</p>
<p>Zabini announced that it was the birthday of one of their first members, Lucius Malfoy, and that the next number was dedicated to him. Sirius spied the platinum blond at a table close to the stage and wondered why he hadn't noticed the distinctive wizard before. Sirius just shrugged and went back to his drink, which wasn't quite as good as his first drink, but was half the price and still excellent. The Malfoy family did a lot to reform and rebuild after the war. Sirius would never begrudge people second chances and didn't mind being in the same room as the man, but he was not going to be friends with him.</p>
<p>**Cherry Pie by Warrant**<br/>
The curtain opened on the seven Emerald witches who started the evening. This time they wore long candy red pony tails and had on little white dresses covered in a cherry pattern. A bloke singing “she's my cherry pie” about a girl played and Sirius wondered about what were clearly Muggle songs. He really only thought about it for a second, because he was distracted by the dancing, the dresses coming off, the bright red satin lingerie, and then eventually the wonderful nudity. Again, Sirius had to appreciate the dance moves these witches executed so well. At the end of the performance, they again made their way through the crowd, but this time they each stopped at Malfoy's table to plant bright red lipstick kisses on the wizard. Sirius couldn't help but laugh at the generally austere wizard covered in lipstick.  Malfoy turned slightly to speak to his friend, who Sirius believed was a Pucey.  From that angle it almost looked as though the notoriously unflappable Malfoy was blushing, which made Sirius laugh harder.</p>
<p>Ginny had gone off one and a half acts ago, but now rejoined him and demanded his opinion thus far.</p>
<p>"The dancing is great, Gin," Sirius honestly told the young witch. She smiled at the compliment.  "All the acts so far have been great. It's sexy, fun, and exciting."</p>
<p>Sirius didn't know if a membership was worth the money though. It was a lot. Zabini was back on stage talking about how great the ladies had just been.</p>
<p>"Next, what you've all been waiting for," Zabini continued on. Sirius perked up. Hadn't they all been watching what they'd come for?  "The one, the only, Siren!"</p>
<p>The crowd erupted into applause. There were several shouts of excitement as well. The audience had been responsive, laughing and applauding, all along; but now they seemed particularly keyed up.</p>
<p>"Siren?" Sirius asked Ginny.</p>
<p>"You'll see," Ginny grinned. "I can tell you though; most people are on the fence about the membership fee up to this point."</p>
<p>Sirius wondered if Ginny was reading his mind. He just nodded in agreement. An anticipatory hush fell over the crowd. It was like they were holding their collective breath, raptly staring at the stage. Sirius had to turn and look with them. The curtain was parting.</p>
<p>"They always decide it's worth it after they see her," Ginny whispered in his ear.</p>
<p>The stage was dark. It had been reconfigured to have one set of stairs leading down to the center stage. A spotlight swept up the steps and Sirius saw a woman standing at the top, now the only thing illuminated on the dark stage. The audience broke out into applause. Sirius felt transfixed and decided to blame part of that on the showmanship and drama of the moment. He had to admit, drama aside, the woman was stunning with a classic hour-glass figure. The first thing he noticed was that she wore a black leather half mask. It covered the top half of her face and seemed to make her plump, dark red lips more prominent. Long dark hair cascaded smoothly over her shoulders, the nearly black hair changing to a bright candy red at the ends. Her strapless dress was black, sequined, and sheer.  It was tight on top and then draped down to the floor. The way the light hit her, Sirius managed to make out that her strapless bra and very brief pants were the same candy red. The impossibly high heels she wore matched that red as well.</p>
<p>"Thank you so much," the witch murmured, her voice silky and low. "This song is one of my favorites. I do hope you like it."</p>
<p>Sirius felt he'd heard her voice before, but was sure he would've remembered meeting this creature. Music filled the room and she swayed gently.  She closed her eyes and Sirius could hear her hum softly.  He felt like he was watching a private moment and found himself leaning forward slightly.</p>
<p>**I Put a Spell On You by Nina Simone**<br/>
“I put a spell on you,” the witch sang, stepping down one step.  She revealed long slits in the sides of the dress, going all the way up to her hips and flashing the red of her knickers at the very top.  Her legs were encased in black net stockings that went up to her mid-thigh.  “And now you’re mine.”</p>
<p>Her voice was silken and seemed to wrap around him.  Sirius understood why she was called Siren.  Her seductive voice called to him.  </p>
<p>“You better stop the things that you do, now,” she continued. “I ain’t lyin.”</p>
<p>Siren moved with a liquid grace down the steps, her movements entirely in tune with the slow, rolling melody of the song.  Her shapely legs peeked out with each step, teasing him.  Her dress highlighted generous cleavage as well.  Sirius didn’t know where to look.  He got unreasonably excited when he realized that she wasn’t stopping when she got to the main stage.  Siren was continuing down off the low stage and into the audience.  The spotlight trained on her, moved with her into the crowd.</p>
<p>“You know I can’t stand it,” she sang, approaching a table.  Sirius wondered how early he would have to arrive to claim one of those front spots.  The two wizards in front of her appeared ecstatic when she reached out her hands to caress their faces.   “You’re runnin’ around.”</p>
<p>Siren continued on and stopped in front of Lucius Malfoy.  She seemed to smirk at the blond, and then raised her foot.  The shining red stiletto rested right on the edge of his chair, between his slightly parted legs.  Her whole stocking-clad leg was exposed, all the way to the top.</p>
<p>“You know better, daddy,” she seemed to tease. “I can’t stand it ‘cause you put me down.”</p>
<p>Sirius was torn between being amused at the flustered, lustful look on Malfoy’s face and being jealous of the aristocrat’s near contact with the mysterious singer.  Siren moved on, continuing to sing her song.  Sirius slid his eyes back in time to see Malfoy let out the breath he was holding when the singer was near him.  </p>
<p>Siren ran her fingers over an older wizard’s arm, and then went on to stroke the neck of a witch at another table.  She moved hypnotically around the space as if she owned it.  She seemed confident that every eye was on her, focused on her as she sang.  She leaned into the table where the large group of young wizards sat, favoring them with an enviable view down the front of her dress.  Sirius saw her lick her luscious red lips, mesmerizing the wizards.  They just stared; slack jawed as she helped herself to a drink from their table.  None of them moved as she drank the amber liquid.  Sirius idly wondered if it was the same expensive firewhiskey he’d initially ordered.  The wizards she took it from just looked thrilled that she favored them with her presence.  Sirius didn’t blame them in the least.</p>
<p>Slowly, she worked her way back to the stage and sang the end of the song.  Her voice filled the room as she belted out the last few lines of the song.  As the music faded out, she looked to the audience and blew a kiss.  Then the spotlight went dark.  After a moment, some lights came back on the stage, but she was gone.  The room was riotous with cheers and shouts.</p>
<p>“Who was that?”Sirius asked aloud, still staring at the stage.  He turned to Ginny, smirking next to him and repeated this question.  “Who was that?”</p>
<p>“She’s pretty great, isn’t she?”</p>
<p>“Obviously,” Sirius responded, taking a long pull on his drink.  He hadn’t drunk anything during that song.  “You didn’t answer my question.”</p>
<p>“The Emerald Cabaret respects Siren’s desire for privacy,” Ginny just said, sounding as if she’d said that same line a hundred times.  Sirius imagined she may have.</p>
<p>“Is she really a siren?” Sirius pressed.  It was hard to tell if she was using magic during that performance.  He felt entranced, but his mind didn’t have the fuzziness that would’ve been present after a spell that would bewitch him in that way.  “Did she really put a spell on us, like she sang?”</p>
<p>Ginny just laughed and shook her head.</p>
<p>“Siren, ladies and gentlemen!” Zabini waltzed back on stage, still smiling brightly.  The crowd continued to cheer.  “I can tell you that Siren will be performing a second time this evening to close out the show.  The night is still young my friends.  On with the show!”</p>
<p>The well-muscled, shirtless wizard came out next and juggled a variety of objects, including blue bell flames that he’d conjured.  Sirius felt that was impressive.  He was followed by a statuesque witch in a silver sequined sleeveless jumpsuit.  The witch was tall, a bit over two meters Sirius guessed.  She was joined on stage by a lovely assistant, who was of course barely clothed.  The assistant stood against a moveable wall that was put up for this performance and the witch threw knives toward her.  Each knife landed within a finger-width of the witch.  It was all very dramatic.  She brought out a bow and arrow, and then proceeded to shoot items off the assistant's head, out of her hands, and even between her knees.  Sirius loved it!  So many witches and wizards relied on magic and had awful hand-eye coordination without it. </p>
<p>Sirius' drink was replenished efficiently during the performances and he noted that service to everyone was both unobtrusive and impeccable.  He even liked Zabini's prattle in between each of the acts.  He joked, teased the crowd, and flattered them all.  Sirius was having a good time and was a bit eager to see Siren again, if he were being honest.  Her performance was so dramatic and he wanted to find out if she would be just as enthralling a second time, or if it had been the novelty of the mystery singer that was most interesting.  </p>
<p>** Pour Some Sugar On Me by Def Leppard **<br/>
When the curtain parted again, the three poles were back on the stage, one in center stage and the other two forward on the stage, but to each side.  A song began and the singer issued an invitation to "pour some sugar on me," as three witches stepped out onto stage.  They were all dressed in satin silver shorts as well as tight green tops.  Sirius immensely enjoyed watching them dance around the poles and remove those items of clothing, leaving them just in silver g-strings.  When the three witches began to move up the poles and spin around, Sirius appreciated their athleticism.  He doubted he could've done what they did if he practiced for a month!</p>
<p>After that rousing performance, it seemed it was finally time to see her again.  Zabini came out and chatted a bit in front of the curtain, thanking everyone for coming.  </p>
<p>When the curtain parted again, the stage was entirely dark.  This time the spotlight found her in the very center of the stage.  Siren wore the same black half-mask, but her long hair was pulled back in a ponytail high on her head.  She was wearing a black leather corset with tiny black knickers.  Black stiletto leather boots went up to her mid-thigh.  She was standing with her feet shoulder length apart and was twirling a riding crop in her hands.  The crowd erupted and Sirius felt she looked like the perfect dominatrix.  </p>
<p>"Thank you, darlings," she purred.  "I've put together something special in honor of the luscious Lucius for his birthday."</p>
<p>** S&amp;M by Rihanna **<br/>
Music filled the room, a voice singing Na na na na, Come on as the lights on the stage expanded.  Surrounding Siren were four witches, all bound in various positions by thick black rope that hung from the ceiling.  The four witches wore black leather bras and knickers.  Siren sauntered around the stage as the music continued, running the riding crop over the witches.  </p>
<p>"Feels so good being bad," she began to sing.  "There's no way I'm turning back."</p>
<p>Sirius was again enthralled by her as she sang about pain and pleasure, caressing the witches on stage.  The other witches were delightful to look at, but they were her props and Sirius found her capturing his attention.  He moved a bit forward in his seat when she moved to leave the stage again, as she had in her last song.</p>
<p>"Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it," she sang as she approached Lucius. Siren reached out and ran the riding crop down the side of Malfoy's face to his chin, then pushed it up making him tilt his head.  She walked behind him as she sang about sex, chains, and whips.  Sirius regretted that his own birthday and had passed months ago.  Siren held the whip with both hands behind Malfoy, the center of the crop pressed into his neck and pushing his head back into her lush cleavage.  Sirius smirked when the aristocrat's eyes closed in pleasure.  He couldn't hear Malfoy groan over the music, but Sirius was sure it happened.  </p>
<p>Sirius swore he heard a collective sigh from the crowd when Siren returned to the stage, rather than treating others in the crowd to her attentions.  She continued the song on stage, interacting with the trussed witches and dancing so very provocatively.  Even though she didn't take off any clothing, Sirius found her performance more stimulating than the witches that had disrobed.  He liked them too, of course.  Siren, though, she was amazing.  Her voice melted like butter around him and she exuded sex.  Sirius couldn't remember the last time he's been more turned on.</p>
<p>All too soon, the song was over and the curtain closed.  Sirius knew he would be dedicating some time to finding out the identity of this mystery witch.  He had to meet her, to find this captivating witch.  He looked over to Ginny and favored her with this best, most charming smile.  He could make his young friend give him information, he was sure.</p>
