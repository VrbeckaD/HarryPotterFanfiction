  <strong>February 1998.</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>She pressed her face into her palms, a frustrated sigh escaping her lips. “Is there any other way?”</p><p>Hermione sat on the far edge of the couch, her feet crossed at the ankles. The room smelled predominantly of freshly laundered sheets and the stale aroma of antique furniture. It was well-lit and familiar, walls white and clean with a comfortable looking bed—a single king-sized bed, Hermione noted.</p><p>Falling asleep with Lucius Malfoy next to you in bed ought not to be easy. Somehow, however, Hermione was finding it was the only way to get anything close to a good night’s sleep. It was pure exhaustion and necessity. They were on the run, she was a Muggleborn witch and he was a traitor to You-Know-Who’s cause and posing as a couple was the most expedient way of getting a room for the night without anyone questioning them.</p><p>Of course, they’ve tried the family-relative sort of scenario first but they looked nothing alike that the receptionist didn’t believe them, not even bothering to give them the benefit of the doubt. After seeing the couple before them easily booked a hotel room, it was then that Hermione pulled Lucius outside and suggested they pose as a couple which outraged the older wizard.</p><p>
  <em>“Absolutely not!” Lucius crossed his arms across his chest. He looked like a petulant child that was forced to eat his vegetables and Hermione had to bite back the urge to call him out on it.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“You’re the one who wanted to sleep in expensive hotels!” She shrieked. “I was fine with that inn across the street but no, Lucius sodding Malfoy wants to roll over in silk sheets!”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Why you—”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>He was cut off when Hermione pointed her wand at him and Lucius was forced to step back. “Take one more step and I’ll hex you off. I’m the only one with a wand here Mr. Malfoy and if you want to live, I suggest you behave yourself and follow my plan.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Hermione could see him clench and unclench his hands and it was probably taking everything in him not to strangle her. Eventually, the wizard relaxed a bit and said through gritted teeth, “Very well then, Miss Granger. Have it your way.”</em>
</p><p>So the receptionist had, as most hotel receptionists would, given them a single king. They both stared at the single bed until Lucius had offered—albeit begrudgingly—to sleep on the floor pulling the spare pillow and blanket out of the closet. A true gentleman to the core—probably his only redeeming quality—but Hermione’s sense of Gryffindorian chivalry kicked in.</p><p>
  <em>"Honestly, Mr. Malfoy, it’s not like you’ll take advantage of me in the middle of the night. You may be many things but you are most definitely not a rapist.”</em>
</p><p>It wasn’t like some cheap Muggle romance novel her mother used to read. They didn’t end up twined around one another, no morning erection or sleepy admissions of undying affection. They slept. Got up. Left. The next hotel had a suite and a good pull out bed and that was okay. Having him in the same room where she could hear him breathing was still oddly comforting. And it was early weeks—when being alone and on the run, accepting her criminal status was difficult still, before they had made it safely out and away from the reach of the Ministry and You-Know-Who’s followers and every other witch or wizard that was surely looking for them. They never stayed in the same place for more than three days, something they learned the hard way when they nearly got captured by the Carrow siblings.</p><p>“If there was, I wouldn’t be suggesting this to you,” came a sarcastic drawl, drawing Hermione away from the memory. “Believe me, I am appalled as you are with this idea, but we have no choice.”</p><p>A glare that could probably make even You-Know-Who tremble was sent in his direction, but he just pretended to flick an imaginary lint off his immaculate robes. <em>Pompous git.</em> “Yes, we do! We could think of another way to ensure our safety!”</p><p>Lucius started pacing the small room, his shirtsleeves rolled up and cravat loosened, hair a mess from all the times he’d run his hands through it. He was exhausted, but there was still so much to do. There was always so much to do. It never stopped. Sometimes he wondered if this—shifting allegiances, aligning himself with the ‘light’—was all worth it, truly.</p><p>He ran his hands through his platinum locks—<em>again</em>. She'd never seen him so worked up before—well, to be fair, Hermione had never seen the man show any emotion other than mild contempt. “Miss Granger, we are both fugitives hunted by the Ministry—the same Ministry that is now controlled by the Dark Lord.”</p><p>“I know. Harry, Ron, and I narrowly escaped the Ministry a month ago.”</p><p>“You what? How—nevermind. Then you know the law Dolores Umbridge recently passed? You know what happens to Muggleborns like you?” Hermione can’t help but shudder at the memory of her fellow Muggleborn wizards and witches being turned to stone in the middle of the Ministry lobby.</p><p>“Yes, but—”</p><p>“I’m a traitor in the eyes of the Dark Lord,” he interrupted her. “If we get caught, we’ll be both placed on trial and we’ll be both asked to testify against each other in front of the <em>jury</em>.” He said the last word with such disdain that almost made Hermione flinch. She suddenly remembered that he was put on trial after You-Know-Who’s first disappearance, after the first war. "It's a logical solution."</p><p>She had to admit that it had seemed logical, smart even. In the unfortunate event that they get caught, they would never have to testify against one another, never have to worry about rights or visitation or the flow of information or money. It would even help them book hotels more easily, but she can't help but doubt this plan—his plan. Can't help but think that he's acting out of fear, and desperation (<em>plus there’s the matter of his...</em> Hermione was even more hesitant to bring that up). That maybe there's another solution to this problem. To propose a marriage like that had seemed out of character for him—well, everything about this situation they’re both in seemed out of character for him.</p><p>She's reluctant to voice these thoughts out in fear of another argument with him. The last time they fought that bad, his fellow Death Eaters almost caught them. To think that happened only four days ago. Surely there was another solution they both had not yet considered. If only she had a little more time, she was certain that she could have conceived of a plan a tad more reasonable. She wasn’t called the brains of the Golden Trio for nothing, the Brightest Witch of Her Age for nothing.</p><p>Hermione took a deep breath and began. "I don't think—"</p><p>“There’s no time to <em>think</em>," he interrupted her again, not allowing to voice out her concerns. “The more we stand here debating about the faults and merits of this idea, the more likely we would never find my son and your friends. We need to be pragmatic about this.”</p><p>“I am being pragmatic about this!” She said exasperated. “Have you completely thought about the consequences of this plan? What about your son? What if he finds out about this?”</p><p>That got him to stop pacing. “He won’t. I'll file the annulment papers—or divorce, whichever you prefer—discreetly as soon as this is over, as soon as that madman is completely gone forever, and as soon as my son is safe,” he said as he wandered over and sat on the other end of the couch.</p><p>“This isn’t necessary. We’ll just have to be more extra careful, so we’ll never get captured.”</p><p>“Extra careful?” He huffed a laugh. “Says the witch who was caught by the Snatchers not too long ago.”</p><p>“It wasn’t my fault!”</p><p>“And I’m not a Malfoy!”<br/><br/>The silence stretched before them—Hermione staring at the polished marble floor and Lucius staring at the finely decorated walls inside their hotel room. Thank Merlin she placed some silencing charms around, or the Muggle staff of the hotel would be banging on their front door right now.</p><p>“Tell me, Miss Granger, what is it that’s really bothering you hmm?” Hermione felt herself sink under his unrelenting gaze. “You’re a bright witch and I’m fairly positive you’ve weighed out the pros and cons and have already come up a conclusion—a conclusion I’m certain that agrees with what I’m proposing to you."</p><p>“I just think you’re not thinking this through completely. If you have then you wouldn’t be suggesting this.”</p><p>Lucius just raised an eyebrow at her, waiting for her to elaborate further. <em>Here goes nothing...</em></p><p>“Like you just said Mr. Malfoy, I’m Muggleborn. Only a few weeks ago you were part of a cult that seeks to eradicate my kind and now you’re suggesting that we get married. Pardon me if I’m <em>a bit</em> hesitant to accept your, uh, proposal.”</p><p>“And the truth finally comes out,” he leaned back on the couch and stared off on the corner of the hotel room. Lucius Malfoy in a pensive mood is something Hermione never expected to see in her entire existence. “I was part of it but that doesn't mean I wholly believed in it. My motives and my actions have always been for the betterment of the family name. It was a responsibility I was thrust upon since my birth.”</p><p>“That doesn’t answer my question.”</p><p>“I wasn’t aware there was one.”</p><p>She sighed again in frustration. “Stop answering me like that! You're not Dumbledore!”</p><p>“There’s something else bothering you, Miss Granger. Out with it.”</p><p>Of course, he’d know something else was bothering her. Hermione kept wondering if the wizard was a skilled Legilimens and has been invading her mind from the start.</p><p>“I’m sorry to bring this up now, but Mr. Malfoy your wife recently died—murdered by her sister—plus, you and your son got separated. I’m afraid your current emotions are dictating your decisions.”</p><p>He took that in momentarily, and a certain sorrow passed through his features, sinking in and imprinting itself on his bones. Maybe this was the first time he'd allowed himself to realize what had happened, what he had lost that night. This spurned Hermione to continue.</p><p>“Emotions have led people to do all sorts of things they later regret—like, oh, a conservative Pureblood wizard marrying a Muggleborn witch.”</p><p>“Why, Miss Granger,” Lucius placed a hand on his chest in mock surprise. “One might assume you’re <em>concerned</em> for my well-being.”</p><p>“Your decisions directly affect those around you—in this case, me. And should we get captured, this will, in turn, affect my friends and your son as well. So, yes, Mr. Malfoy, I am concerned for your well-being.” And this time his expression was of genuine shock but it only lasted for a second before it reverted to his usual annoyed expression. Hermione was silently pleased to have caught him momentarily off guard.</p><p>“I assure you, Miss Granger, that I’m not distracted by these... <em>emotions</em>,” he leaned forward, resting his elbows on his knees. Lucius turned and face her, arching his eyebrows a bit. “Do you still have any concerns?”</p><p>It was her turn to lay back on the couch and think, eyes focused on anything but the only other person in the room that she missed the heated look he was giving her as she chewed her bottom lip.<br/><br/>She’d tried her best to dissuade the elder Malfoy from putting the plan into motion but he’s as unstoppable as a stream of spell once he’d set his mind onto something. Hermione sighed and decided to concede defeat, letting it fall into the hands of fate—or in this case, Lucius Malfoy.</p><p>"How do you suppose we are going to achieve this goal? We can’t exactly get married here in Britain. And I don’t think a Muggle marriage is equivalent to a Wizarding marriage."</p><p>“Au contraire, Muggle marriages are equally binding as Wizarding marriages and yes, I agree, we can't get married here. The Ministry will get notified immediately so we may have to leave the country,” he stood from the couch and started for the bedroom they reluctantly share (for security purposes, she assured herself). "I'll make the necessary arrangements tomorrow."</p><p>But before he could leave, he was stopped by Hermione's voice.</p><p>“This was not how I imagined my wedding proposal would be.”</p><p>He turned around, and she noticed that he was looking at her oddly.</p><p>“Welcome to my world,” he drawled.</p><p>“Another reason to be thankful for being Muggleborn,” she shrugged at him which earned her an eye-roll.</p><p>“If it makes you feel any better, would you like me to go down on one knee and say the words?” He started to bend his knee to the floor but stopped when a piece of crumpled paper whizzed past his face.</p><p>“Oh, bugger off.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>November 1998.</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>Hermione flicked the lid of the lighter and tipped it towards the corner of the small white parchment. She could’ve used her wand to incinerate it, cast an <em>incendio</em>, and the paper would turn to dust in the blink of an eye. But she’s sitting in a busy cafe in Muggle London and besides, it felt somewhat satisfying burning it the Muggle way.</p><p>Hermione would gladly pay all her money just to see his reaction.</p><p>She watched entranced as the two-letter word written in elegant handwriting was being devoured by the flames slowly, ashes crumbling down onto the empty plate of crème brûlée.</p><p><em>No.</em> It simply said.</p><p>The same old response she would get whenever she’d send an owl asking if he’d signed the damn papers. She’s getting tired of it.</p><p>Hermione stared at the pack of cigarettes resting near the plate—a habit she developed right after the war. She could use one right now but lighting one would only ease her mind and calm her emotions and she didn’t want that. She needed the anger to fuel her in her current quest.</p><p>It’s been almost seven months since the battle had ended and the light had finally triumphed. Voldemort turned to dust by the hands of one Harry Potter.</p><p>Hermione could still vividly remember the final moments of that historic battle as if it had just ended yesterday. How everyone—even the remaining Death Eaters—stood there astonished as the two wizards finally fulfilled the prophecy foretold years ago.</p><p>As Harry and Voldemort each finally cast the last spell that would end it all, Hermione caught a flash of platinum blonde hair across the Great Hall. He was standing there with his son and Hermione couldn’t help but feel a pang of sadness as she noticed the space on the other side of his son—a space a certain family member used to occupy.<br/><br/>Warm brown eyes met cold grey ones and for a moment, everything was at standstill. The distance between them was far greater than the physical separation of a few feet. They stared at each other until a golden flame erupted in the middle of the Great Hall and everyone gasped as Voldemort fell to his knees, his wand—the Elder Wand—was currently being held by none other than Harry Potter, the Boy Who Lived, the Boy Who Survived. The Dark Lord breathes his last and final breath and slowly disintegrated into nothing.</p><p>Cheers erupted from across the hall. The majority of remaining Death Eaters threw down their wands and surrendered to the Aurors while the higher ranks escaped capture and went into hiding.</p><p>Kingsley Shacklebot took over as the Ministry of Magic and immediately started the repairing and rebuilding of the entire Wizarding community which continued to this day.</p><p>The Golden trio was heralded as heroes and was immediately given an opportunity to work in the Auror department but only Hermione accepted the offer (her dreams of becoming a healer long forgotten) on the condition that she finish her N.E.W.T.S. first. Harry, having enough of war and violence, decided to pursue a career in Quidditch instead landing the position of a Seeker for Puddlemere United (he was, after all, the best Seeker Gryffindor ever had) while Ron assumed the role of his late brother Fred and helped George run the Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes.</p><p>The three of them drifted from the path they were supposed to take when they were kids. The two settled for peace, a life outside of politics while the other one decided to climb to the top of the food chain, reforming the system from the inside to prevent another madman from inciting another war.</p><p>Almost seven months went by since the final battle. Roughly 2 million witches and wizards are now living peacefully—all except two.</p><p> </p><p align="center">---</p><p> </p><p>Her apparition landed her in front of the gates of the Manor. Hermione wobbled slightly on her feet, feeling unsure how to proceed now and wondering at the same time if the wards surrounding the property will permit someone like her to enter the place. She didn't survive the war only to die by some Muggleborn hating wards. Dread filled her instantly, but she didn’t need to ponder that long because the gates instantly swung open for her, as if it were expecting her, beckoning her to enter.</p><p>It’s been ten months since the last time she’d been here, and she realized that she’d never seen what the Manor looked like from the outside. It was beautiful and well maintained despite what happened here during the war.<br/><br/>Tentatively, she took a step, and then another, and soon found herself in front of his study. She didn’t know how she got there, it's as if there was an invisible force guiding her, showing her the path. The doors were already open like the gates outside, like the entire property is welcoming her back, recognizing her as the new Lady of the Manor. It infuriated Hermione and she used it to fuel her anger more. She immediately scanned the room in search of the wizard in question and found him sitting behind his huge mahogany desk writing on a piece of parchment. Beside him were a couple of leather-bound books, stacks of parchments and scrolls.</p><p>The last time she'd seen him was the day Voldemort was finally defeated. She wanted to approach him, talk to him, even hug him but he was talking to his son, so Hermione took one last longing look, turned around and joined her friends in celebration.</p><p>He looked better. <em>It's the robes,</em> Hermione mused. To blend with the Muggles, he had to forgo the Wizarding robes and wear Muggle clothing like jeans and a shirt, much to her amusement and his disgust. Now sitting there, he looked regal in a crisp black dress shirt underneath a midnight black robe and an emerald green cravat around his neck. Face cleanly shaven once more and his hair was back to its shining glory. The urge to run her fingers through it as she used to before made her feel bereft.</p><p>Hermione tried to ignore the odd feeling growing in the pit of her stomach, tried to arrange her facial expression to some semblance of anger or at the very least, annoyance.</p><p>“Why haven’t you signed the papers, Lucius?”</p><p>He didn’t look up from his desk. Hermione wondered if he’s ignoring her or he just simply didn’t hear her. <em>Arrogant bastard.</em> Hermione dragged the nearest chair she could find to his desk and sat there waiting patiently for him to acknowledge her presence. After a few minutes which felt like an eternity to her, Lucius finally set down his quill and looked up at her. Their eyes met and she found it hard to maintain her resolve, not when he’s looking at her that way, like that night almost ten months a—<em>no, don’t go there.</em></p><p>“How are you, Hermione?”</p><p>“The war’s over—had been over for almost seven months. Voldemort’s gone, your son is safe, Lucius, and you’re a free man now. There’s no reason to continue this charade anymore so let’s cut to the chase, shall we?” she clasped her together in front of her lap. “The papers. I asked you to sign them and owl them back. It should have been done months ago.”</p><p>“How’s your work at the D.M.L.E.?”</p><p>“If you wanted information, you should have properly answered my owls. Now, I’m here, and I want you to sign the papers and give them to me,” she crossed her legs, prepared to wait. She leaned back on the chair, seemingly relaxed, but they both know the truth, she’s angry with him.</p><p>“How is Draco?”</p><p>“He’s doing fine,” she answered looking down. “Now, the papers. I have a schedule to keep. So, if you don’t mind.” Yes, keep it precise to the point and be casual.</p><p>“Why the hurry,” he drawled, and Hermione was doing her best to combat what she was feeling, what he was conveying. “Marrying someone else?”</p><p>“You know why,” it was almost a whisper and she wondered if he heard her or not.</p><p>“No, I don’t. Please do enlighten me, <em>ma moitié</em>.”</p><p>She felt faint and said a silent thanks to Merlin that she’s sitting or else her she would’ve fallen and crumble onto the floor. The way he said the endearment had finally undone her.</p><p>It started as an inside joke between them when the concierge at a Muggle hotel in Paris mistook him for her father. She immediately corrected him saying that Lucius is her ‘better half’ (she didn’t want to say the word ‘husband’) playing the role of a besotted newlywed. Lucius joked that between the two of them, she’s actually the ‘better’ one. He started calling her that pet name ever since, often out of mock endearment, but sometimes...</p><p>Tears were now pooling in her eyes and Hermione was fighting hard to control her emotions. She sat up straight, summoned her Gryffindor courage, and bravely looked him in the eye—which she instantly regretted because the words that came out of her mouth were not the ones she was going to say.</p><p>“Because this is a business contract, and it is beginning to not feel like one.”</p><p><em>Shit.</em> So much for keeping this as casual as possible.</p><p>Hermione will never know when the line she drew between them disappeared—how they turned from mutual hatred to mutual respect and then eventually to... what? She’s still trying to figure out what they are now and she’s pretty sure he doesn’t have a clue either. But she could feel it whenever they’re both in the same room, the tension between them was so thick she could slice it with a rusted butter knife.</p><p>She had agreed to marry him so no matter what happened they could be near each other, be there for each other, protect each other. So, wasn’t it ironic now that they were safe, they would be separated by choice, that they would live apart, move on from one another, have little to nothing to do with one another—permanently? If Hermione wasn’t so torn on the inside, she would’ve laughed.</p><p>“I don’t know what to tell you, Hermione. I don’t know how to stop you from feeling something.”</p><p>“Yes, you do. You know exactly how you manipulative bastard. And that is part of the problem, isn’t it? You promised me. You told me you would file it as soon as the war was over,” she was furious, her voice rising an octave higher. It’s better than crying, right? “I waited seven goddamn months Lucius! I waited until your trial was over, waited until your house arrest was over, but I sure as hell am not going to wait another month more! Sign the papers!”</p><p>She stood then on shaky legs and made her way to the doors, a desperate need to escape the room, to escape him. But, as she reached the threshold, his voice stopped her.</p><p>“Hermione,” he stood and came around to face her, standing directly in front of her, close enough to touch. “I’m not signing them,” he told her with the same conviction he had that night he proposed the idea to her. “The papers? I’m not signing them. We're not done yet so, you can go ahead and go. Keep your schedule. Because I'm not signing anything.”</p><p>He placed a kiss on her forehead and walked out of the room. Hermione leaned her back against the door, feeling more confused than ever about the wizard’s decision. For someone who entered this... deal as reluctantly as she was, if not more so, she couldn’t comprehend why he wasn’t trying to find a way out the moment an opportunity presented itself—which was a lot.<br/><br/><em>You know why. You just don’t want to admit it to yourself</em>.<br/><br/>“I really need that cigarette right now,” she muttered into the empty room. This was not how she wanted to spend her Saturday afternoon.</p><p> </p><p> </p>
