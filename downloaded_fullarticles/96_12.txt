    <p align="justify">Lots of things changed after the war. Harry now lives in Grimmauld Place with Ron and Kreacher. He kept correspondence with his cousin, Dudley, but not with his Aunt and Uncle. </p><p align="justify">Dudley now lives away from his parents. He became a professional boxer, even won a scholarship from the sport. He even reserved front row seats for whenever Harry liked to watch. Whenever Dudley is in London, Harry offered him to stay in Grimmauld Place.</p><p align="justify">Meanwhile, Hermione removed her parents' memory charm and is now back living under the same roof.</p><p align="justify">Harry still has not purchased an owl. He was still sad about Hedwig, who had been his constant companion for more than seven years. Instead, Hermione taught him how to use his patronus as means of delivering messages. She also managed to bewitched electricity to Hogwarts. During her final year, she managed to smuggle smartphones to make communication easier between the trio. She even invented a spell for quick charging. In turn, Harry taught Ron (and Mr. Weasley) how to use a smartphone. Even Ron had to admit that 'Muggle way is more effective than an owl'.</p><p align="justify">It has been two months since he and Ginny mutually decided to split up. They thought it was better since they've practically detached from one another once they don't have Hogwarts' walls between them. For what it's worth, they were exclusive for two years, well, if you count the off period when Harry looked for horcruxes. In fact, during their off period was when Harry got used to her missing presence. </p><p align="justify">Towards the end there were no fights nor arguments, in fact, they barely spoke to one another. They only saw each other 2 times a week,  and even then Ginny was busy with school and Harry with rounding up Death Eaters.</p><p align="justify">Also, one of the barriers was that since Ginny went back to finish her seventh year, Harry had to visit her in Hogsmeade. Now, he definitely does not enjoy entertaining young students nor rearranging his bangs to cover his scar every two minutes. To make things worse, he got impossibly more popular after Witch Weekly crowned him Most Charming Smile the week they won the war. Ron kept fondly reminding him how he now has one more thing in common with Gilderoy Lockhart.</p><p align="justify">In fact, Harry was worried on whether to end the relationship because of Ron. He confided to Hermione who brushed his woes away, "Harry. He's your best friend. Also, it's <em> your </em> relationship, he does not have a say in this.", she said. </p><p align="justify">As for Ron, he took it well. Harry suspected Ginny might had a hand in Ron's surprising acceptance though, because Harry was certain that at one point, Ron (and Mrs. Weasley) expected them to get married.</p><p align="justify">It was the week of Ginny and Hermione's graduation. Hermione's graduation was a day earlier. She invited her parents, Harry, Ron, and (to all their surprise), Percy. When asked why, she said because Percy was like her mentor, her sole academic correspondence during seventh year because he took twelve N.E.W.T.S and she needed advice.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Harry realized the final straw of his breakup was that he was not invited to Ginny's graduation. Okay, Luna Lovegood who was in the same year as Ginny invited Harry, she said it was a thank you for his invitation to Slugs Club gathering two years back. Harry politely declined, he wanted to respect Ginny's decision to put some distance, otherwise he felt like raining on her parade. Also from Hermione's graduation he learned that he would only be the subject of more pointing and whispers.</p><p align="justify">Through Ron, he found out how Ginny does well for herself. She took five N.E.W.T.S, and her quidditch talent got her scouted to a spot in Holyhead Harpies reserves team. Even as far as Harry knew, Ginny had begun dating someone else, so the chance he got invited is negative. Not that he expected an invitation for the day, or anything.</p><p align="justify">In solidarity to Harry, Hermione declined Ginny's invitation. That day Hermione agreed to accompany Harry to watch quidditch. Due to Harry being so called 'Chosen One', he could land tickets easily. Admittedly, he had to contact his old potions master, Professor Slughorn, for the tickets. </p><p align="justify">After the war, Harry had loads of time between rounding up former Death Eaters to watch Quidditch. He even considered being a professional Quidditch player. Being a former Captain and Star-seeker, he had many offers he turned down. Kingsley, who became the official Minister for Magic also offered him a spot in the Auror's office. At the end, he consulted both Victor Krum and Professor McGonagall. Both mutually suggested that he should take time off for a year. McGonagall reminded Harry that even his father did not immediately took upon a job after he graduated.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The match was a league game between Ginny's future team, The Holyhead Harpies vs Tutshill Tornados. Growing up in the muggle world, Harry learned little of Quidditch through Ron, who supported Chudley Cannons. In turn, he became a (casual) fan of that said team.</p><p align="justify">Harry and Hermione decided to Apparate to the stadium. Harry wore his incognito muggle attire, a grey hoodie covering his head (mostly his forehead) and ripped jeans that once belonged to Dudley. Hermione wore one of Mrs. Weasley's sweater, a S.P.E.W badge, and beige pants. To avoid the hassle of bags, now she hid her belongings inside her socks (trick she learned during the war).</p><p align="justify">The Wizarding World is still in recovery after the war, that there were empty seats in the stadium. Hermione looked mildly interested at the chattering crowd. She said something behind her gloves to Harry who did not hear her.</p><p align="justify">"What??", He half yelled at Hermione, pointing his ear to signal that he could not hear her. Hermione rolled her eyes. "I said, I'm surprised you wanted to watch this match!", she repeated, louder this time.</p><p align="justify">Bewildered, Harry asked loudly, "What?? Why?"</p><p align="justify">Hermione pointed at her match programme, which now featured the starting line up. "Cho is playing, Harry!"</p><p align="justify">Harry raised his eyebrow, "Chang??", he asked dumbly. He watched Hermione impatiently casted a Muffliato charm around them. She tutted loudly.</p><p align="justify">"How many Chos do we know??", she shook her head. Harry got a good slap of her bushy hair.</p><p align="justify">Then, as if by slow motion, Harry watched the giant face of her ex on the screen. With an open mouth, he watched as Cho rounded the pitch on her broom. She smiled at the crowd, and flew higher up than the rest of her teammates. Harry's stomach did that familiar turn.</p><p align="justify">He felt like he was being transported back to his third year. Particularly the match between <em> Gryffindor vs Ravenclaw </em>, when he met Cho for the first time.</p><p align="justify">.</p>
