    <p>Harry stared out the window, his head slumped on his hand. In the distance he could hear Hermione as she furiously scratched away at her paper. Newt preparation was a ball ache and everyday Harry’s focus slipped. He had more important things to think about than tests. Voldemort was back. People were looking to him to find the solution and Harry was crumbling under the pressure. He couldn’t remember the last time he slept well, it was probably the lack of sleep affecting his focus, right? </p><p>He looked up to find McGonagall leant over Parvarti’s desk. She directed Parvati’s wand over the ring in front of her. What were they meant to be learning? His eyes flicked down to his own ring and then to Ron who was staring into space, no help there. He turned to Hermione to find her watching him. Her sharp expression shifted to something softer as she flicked her wand to the textbook. </p><p>“Non-verbal” she whispered.</p><p>Harry paused, that explained how quiet it was. He pulled his textbook closer and began to read. Halfway through the first sentence Harry was noticed by Ron he was watching Hermione. Ron had been doing that a lot recently. Hermione looked up and Ron looked away. Ah, thought Harry it’s happening again. Harry felt like every time they played this game he ended up watching from the side-lines. He really wished Parvati hadn’t sat next to him the other day. She came over and frankly informed him how wonderful it was to see Hermione and Ron’s relationship change, how she couldn’t wait until they were official. Whatever that meant. So, he’d looked across to find them playing the staring game. And now he couldn’t not notice. He was happy for Hermione, really, he was, Ron has finally started to notice her in a different light. But Merlin was it almost as bad as when Lavender took an interest in Ron. Well, maybe not as bad. Nothing could compare for the pain that was Ickle Ronniekins. Harry suppressed a shudder. He thought about how odd it was watching your two best mates do something together that you couldn’t join in. He wasn’t jealous, he had Ginny. And Ginny was great.</p><p>Harry tried to think about his friend’s relationship in a positive light. He was happy for them both. Wasn’t he? They needed something in these messy times, something to help them through. Maybe they needed something more than him? Especially with Voldy being back. Something to distract them from the sadness rolling in… What if this was it? Maybe Voldy wins, maybe this was his final year. Harry didn’t think he could win this year, not again. He’d been lucky all the past years, in fact he was amazed he’d even beaten Quirrell in his first year. Harry didn’t think he would have made it, not without his mates.</p><p>His eyes slid back to Hermione and Ron, still playing their game. Would they be okay without me? Harry was shrugged out of his thoughts as the bell rang. McGonagall clapped her hands together<br/>
“Alright everyone,” Began McGonagall “I expect you to perform this incantation silently next lesson, this should be simple”<br/>
Ron groaned<br/>
“And just a reminder, Apparition lesion will begin next month…” the rest of her sentence was lost in the shuffle of bags.</p><p>Harry head to dining room, he’d been looking forward to dinner all afternoon and planned to do no revision at all. “Blimey, apparition is going to be so amazing” Ron exclaimed enthusiastically he waved his hands as he spoke “I can’t wait to pop everywhere, you remember what Fred and George were like?”<br/>
“But I hear it’s very hard to pass, first time. I hope I do” said Hermione<br/>
“Oh, I’m sure you will” replied Ron.<br/>
Harry rolled his eyes; he could imagine the face Ron was making. They rounded the corner, Harry could feel himself salivating, he just wanted to get to the Dining Hall. He could manage their affection if he had food in his stomach.<br/>
“Ah, Potter” Harry heard his name and his eyes locked with Malfoys sneering face. Malfoy was walking with Zabini and Parkinson flanking him. “How’s your nose?” said Malfoy his own pointed nose was turned up and he eyed Harry. Harry still couldn’t believe the pillock had broken his nose on the tain, what a great start to the year.<br/>
“None of your business” mumbled Harry as he tried to walk away but Ron had stopped to face Malfoy.<br/>
“Leave of Malfoy” Ron straightened his shoulders, as he stood to defend Harry. Since Ron has shot up the last summer, he was an impressive size, taller than even Malfoy. Normally Harry was all in for tackling Malfoys jibes but the incident on the train had changed him. Malfoy seemed so much more violent; his face had an angry sheen to it. And Harry had more important things to worry about. Like Voldemort his minds happily provided him. Harry felt his shoulders sag.<br/>
“What’s that Potter, why the long face? Your ugly looks weighing you down?” Malfoy was practically preening<br/>
“His nose healed perfectly well” interjected Hermione.<br/>
“I wasn’t just talking about his nose” laughed Malfoy. Zabini and Parkinson began to laugh as well. Harry remembered the discussion at hand and faced Malfoy. He thought about comeback, but nothing came to mind. Harry turned and walked towards the Dining hall, his stomach calling for food. What a fine way to end his day.<br/>
“That’s right you run away coward!” called Malfoy. Harry could hear the shuffle of what was probably, Hermione holding Ron back. As Harry sat down to wait for food to appear, his friends arrived.<br/>
“You shouldn’t let him say those things” said Ron<br/>
“He’s just trying to get a rise from me” replied Harry<br/>
Neville leaned around Hermione to face Ron<br/>
“Are we talking about Malfoy?” he asked.<br/>
“How could you guess?” Harry asked sarcastically. At the far end Dumbledore began to talk,<br/>
“it’s either Malfoy or Snape with you three” said Neville “and if I don’t know what happening then it’s not Snape” He shuddered.<br/>
Harry looked over to the teacher’s tables where Snape was sat. So far Snape hadn’t done anything awful, but the term had only just begun.</p><p>5th October</p><p>Harry head jerked from his pillow. He sat up in his bed, as his heart rattled in his chest. As the symptoms of his nightmare began to subside, he tried to deepen his breath. He couldn’t see past the darkness but as he waited for his heartbeat to settle, he recognised Ron’s heavy snoring and the shuffle of Seamus’ limbs. With a few harsh breaths he calmed himself. He knew he was in his room and he knew he was safe. Well, he huffed a laugh, as safe as Hogwarts has ever been. After he untangled his sweaty legs from his sheets he tried to get out of bed. He moaned in frustration as he pushed his way through the heavy darkness, finally finding his bed curtains. </p><p>His feet gently touched the floor and his legs flipped back up in response to the cold. He placed his feet on the ground, and hissed when the cold seeped in. His memory was murky, but he could place a forest of some sort and red eyes that gleefully watched him. It sounded like a Voldemort dream, not an odd occurrence but the frequency of these were beginning to annoy Harry. After a few half-hearted pats on his bedside table, he managed to find his glasses and slipped out of bed. Wand tucked into his sleeve, he shivered over to the bathroom. </p><p>He leant against the sink and rubbed at the mirror to check his reflection, dark smudges framed his eyes and he wondered, not for the first time, when he would get a full night sleep. On that line of though, casting a quick Tempus, Harry discovered it was 3 in the morning.<br/>
“Brilliant” he grumbled.<br/>
There was no way he could get back to sleep if the past week was to be believed. He shuffled back to his room and, as quietly as he good, assembled his quidditch kit. Bloody Ron had left his clothes on the floor, it was a pain finding anything in their combined mess. But once he thought he had mostly his clothes on, he grabbed his boom and left the room.</p><p>Once on the pitch, the cold air helped to clear his head of his his dream and Harry felt his spirits lift. He mounted his broom and pushed of into air. He practised some spins and turns until he felt fully awake. He slowed to rest on his broom and looked over at Hogwarts. The morning sun hadn’t fully risen, and he watched as clouds sleepily moved past. Feeling sentimental, Harry looked around the stadium and remembered some of the best moments. With Newts, Harry wasn’t likely going to have as much time to practice. And with Voldemort back, who knew how long he had to enjoy this. Harry felt his mood plummet and his speed increase. He crouched low on is broom and zipped through the stadium, testing out different moves. The more he thought about Voldy, the faster he went, until he was flying past the stadium and the lake, past Hagrid’s hut and into the forbidden forest. He realised how fast he was going but spurred on by the skill it took not to hit a tree he pushed on harder. Although the sun had now fully risen his vision was difficult in the woods. Considering this is was no surprise Harry hit a tree and passed out instantly.</p><p>*</p><p>Draco sulkily trudged down the path to the forbidden forest.<br/>
“Oh please Mr Malfoy could you get sap from the yew tree” wined Draco “its very easy to find and since its you it should be fine.” Draco was doing a poor impersonation of Professor Sprout. “Why of course professor, anything you say professor” Draco stopped and curtsied. “Merlin, why did I agree to this? What a great plan lets go to the forbidden forest.” As he got closer to the forest Draco slowed down, fear crept into his features.<br/>
“She knew exactly what buttons to push to get me here. How Slytherin, the old hag” Draco stopped on the edge of the forest. He took a deep breath and plunged into the forest. Professor Sprout had informed him that the type of sap they needed was found not by the trees on the outskirt of the forest. But that he would need to head into the forest and find a clearing with a yew tree. </p><p>As Draco waded through the forest, he kept his wand locked in his hand and ridgedly held in front of his face. His eyes darted around for any hint danger. Draco stopped every few minutes to look behind and above him. He’d then chuckle and then take the same stance as before. Draco wasn’t scared, because Malfoy’s weren’t scared of anything, it was unbecoming of a Malfoy.</p><p>When he finally stumbled onto a clearing, he heaved a great sigh, before straightening his uniform and stepping into the light. He looked around the space, noting the herbs and mushrooms growing before inspecting the trees. It didn’t take him long to realise there wasn’t a yew tree. He took a deep breath; he didn’t cry because Malfoy’s don’t cry. But the sooner he got this sap, the sooner he could get back to the bint of a Professor, and the sooner he could work on… more important things. Not caring which way he went he took off in a faster direction to find another clearing. </p><p>It took Draco three more clearings, a large doping of Spiders that were much to big for normal, and a side step from a group of creatures that he did not look too closely at before he found a yew tree. When he found the tree, he locked his insides to prevent the welling of emotion, straightened his back, and pulled out his wand. He made two incisions at the base of the tree and as he pulled out the flask from his robe, he heard the distinct sound of moaning. Nope He thought as he focused back on the task at hand Nope, nope, nope. He filled his flask and turned to find a creature moving towards him. He screamed as any man would scream and proceeded to hex the creature. The creature possessed a wand and shielded the hex. Draco realised that any creature with a wand has some semblance of intelligence, especially if it could cast.<br/>
“Who goes there?” He called aiming his wand at the creature<br/>
“Its me you Dickweed” replied the creature and Potter stepped into the clearing.<br/>
“Potter?” asked Malfoy, decidedly not lowering his wand<br/>
“Yes, that’s what I said” Potter replied. He was wearing his quidditch kit and holding his broom. Malfoy deduced he had probably been playing quidditch. The Idiot. He had no idea why Potter was practising in the forest, but he did not care.<br/>
“Seems moronic to play quidditch in the forest, I know you’re a terrible Seeker but even you must know what’s a pitch and what’s a forest” Draco looked up at Potter to gauge his response only to find him slumping against the tree. Potter groaned, and removed his hand from his head, blood was dripping down his face. Potter looked at his blood covered hand and placed it back over his face. Idiot thought Draco, hopefully he’ll just die out here. He looked away from Potter to fill up a second flask of sap.<br/>
“Do you know the way back to the castle” asked Potter, Draco ignored him. He pulled out a third flask, filled and capped it. As he was pulling out a fourth a shadow blocked his hands, he looked up to find Potter leaning over him. Instinctually he pushed Potter away. The possibility of Potter blood on his robe disgusted Malfoy so much that he kicked Potter for good measure. The train flashed in his mind and he kicked Potter again. Git.</p><p>Potter was curled on his side coughing. Malfoy imagined leaving him again, only this time he would be in the forest and would definitely die. Perfect. Draco filled up the final flask and corked it. He straightened himself and stretched his legs, a small glee filled him. He bent over Potter who was wheezing on the floor.<br/>
“They can trace your wand” whispered Potter.<br/>
“What?”<br/>
“If you leave me” Potter coughed “they can trace your spell”<br/>
“What are you talking about” Draco lent backwards he didn’t want to listen<br/>
“If I die, here and now” Potter began, he unfolded himself and tried to sit up “They’ll trace it back to you, you’re here for a reason, right?” Draco thought about Professor Sprout<br/>
“You’re not going to die” responded Draco<br/>
“I’m in a lot of pain”<br/>
“Good” Draco stood up and brushed his robes off. He turned back to the woods, he placed his wand in his hand and said, “Point me”. His wand turned in his palm but did not stop. It did not show any signs of stopping.<br/>
“I’ve already tried that” laughed Potter “You’re lost” Draco looked down at Potter, he was leaning on his side shaking. Still laughing Potter faced Draco “I have a broom let’s” he paused, grimaced and then finished: “work together”<br/>
“Accio Broom” cried Draco, the broom which lay next to the tree flew to his hands “now you don’t” holding the broom, Draco took off into the forest.</p><p>Draco walked with Potter’s broom in one hand and his wand held tightly in the other. Thinking about it, he should have taken Potter’s wand as well. He could go back to get it but he’d rather head back to the castle before last period finished. He looked at Potter’s broom, there was no point in flying through the forest. One couldn’t manoeuvre through the trees. Potter and his god complex probably thought he could do it. Draco spotted light ahead and followed it until he landed in another clearing. Potter was lying on his side, he turned towards Draco. He looked at Draco questioningly. As Potter opened his mouth to speak, Draco stomped of in the direction he had come. He was sure he hadn’t gone in a circle but maybe he had gotten turned around. He made sure to walk in a straight line. When he next came upon Potter in a clearing. He huffed threw down Potters broom and stomped back off. </p><p>Every time he entered a clearing Potter was sat waiting for him, with a growing smile. Finally, Draco decided not to enter a clearing, he walked for what felt like hours avoiding any sign of light until he was sure some creature would jump him. He stepped over a tree root unable to see his feet. When suddenly he was back in the clearing. Potter looked up and started to cackly.<br/>
“Fucking, shut up! You filthy half-blood!” Shouted Draco he aimed a hex at Potter, but Potter shielded again. Potter was laughing hard now, leaning on his side until he fell further and started coughing. Between coughs he said “You’re lost” and then laughed harder. </p><p>Draco frustration built, he looked up at the sky in defeat. Potters coughing subsided and Malfoy looked up to see Potter holding his broom and leaning on it.<br/>
“I think the woods is telling you not to leave me” said Potter.<br/>
“I’m not bringing you with me” sighed Draco “you’ll slow me down”<br/>
“you’re plenty slow already” laughed Potter. Draco threw him another hex which Potter deflected easily. He stood their looking at Draco. Draco turned back to the woods “are you coming?” he said. Potter didn’t respond, he faced Potter once more.<br/>
“I can’t walk very well” Draco could feel himself spluttering, he did not want to help Potter. Draco grabbed Potter, ignoring his painful hisses, he held him under his armpit and together they shuffled through the woods.</p><p>They passed through a few clearings before Draco decided to burn the grass, as an identifier. He wanted to be sure that they weren’t heading through the same field. Eventually the trees began to change. Although Draco didn’t recognise any of the species, he was just happy to not be stuck in the cycle of lost Potters. Mist was creeping in around them, and Draco felt sure it must be night, he longingly thought of Dinner where he could be far away from Potter. Potter himself was beginning to get slower and slower.<br/>
“Potter at the rate you’re going we’ll miss dinner” Draco said, after Potter tripped, again.<br/>
“What?” Potter replied sluggishly.<br/>
“Hurry up”<br/>
“Dinner? What’s the time?” asked Potter.<br/>
“Nearly Dinner” responded Draco<br/>
“How long have we been in the forest?” asked Potter<br/>
“Well it only been a few hours for me” responded Draco “you’ve been missing all day”<br/>
“What?” said Potter. He stopped to look at Draco. “All day?”<br/>
“Don’t stop”<br/>
“Wait, you said all day what do you mean?”<br/>
“Exactly what I said, frankly I thought you were gone for good” sighed Draco<br/>
They continued to walk, or in Potter case shuffle “Merlin Potter hurry up” said Draco, he was dragging Potter at this point<br/>
“All day” mumbled Potter<br/>
“Yes, yes all day you’re a terrible friend, I’ve never seen Weasel so stressed” a smile crept up Draco’s face, his morning had been good. Suddenly Potter started hobbling.<br/>
“We have to hurry” rushed Potter.<br/>
“That’s what I’ve been saying” huffed Draco. As Potter rushed on, he was pulled out of Draco’s grip.<br/>
“Potter, wait!” called Draco. The Mist was coming in quick, it was harder and harder to see, but still Potter was rushing forward. Until Potter wasn’t visible. Draco scrambled forwards pushing through the mist<br/>
“Potter you Git!” he called. He couldn’t help grumble about having to carry the wanker all this time only for the shit smear to rush ahead.<br/>
“Potter” he shouted one more time. Draco was ingulfed by Mist unable to see anything he fell.</p>
