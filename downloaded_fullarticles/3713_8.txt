<p>Draco’s Choice</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>“Makeup sex?” Harry laughed. “That was barely a fight—”</p>
<p>“Are you saying you don’t care to have sex with me now?” Draco asked, thumbing one of Harry’s nipples. </p>
<p>Harry gasped as sensation shot through him. “No, that’s definitely not what I’m saying.” His hands slid up Draco’s thighs to settle on his hips. </p>
<p>Draco smiled, his eyes sparkling. “That’s what I thought. Now, since I won the fight—”</p>
<p>Harry rolled his eyes.</p>
<p>“—I get to pick what we do.” </p>
<p>“Right. Of course you do.” Shaking his head, Harry said, “Go on then. Tell me.” </p>
<p>“I want you to rim me.” </p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Harry froze.</p>
<p>Draco’s eyes narrowed. “You know what that is, right?” </p>
<p>“You rimmed me…two days ago! Of course I know what it is.” </p>
<p>Leaning down, Draco nibbled Harry’s jaw. “Do you not care for the idea?” </p>
<p>“You want me to eat your arse,” Harry said, smile widening as he heard Draco’s breath hitch. “Trust me, I <i>really</i> want to.” </p>
<p>“Yeah?” Draco caught the lobe of Harry’s ear in his teeth. “Why’s that?”</p>
<p>“Because once I make you fall apart on my tongue, I’ll fuck you back together with my cock.” </p>
<p>“Fuck,” gasped Draco. “What are you waiting for?” </p>
<p>“Nothing.” </p>
