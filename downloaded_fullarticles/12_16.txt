    <p>“My parents weren’t killed in October.” Harry said. He said so in a hushed voice because he didn’t want everyone in Mr Binns history class to turn around and listen in. They had already done a lot of staring at him. This was because they were learning about the end of the last Wizarding War, and the date of Harrys parent’s death came up. The stares were ironically mostly made up of sympathetic looks because Harry was getting the attention they were giving him.</p><p>“They did Harry. That’s in all the History books with them in it.” Hermione said firmly. Harry was slightly annoyed that she believed the books knew more about Harry’s live than he did, but it wasn’t anything out of the usual.“No. I arrived at the Dursleys in April. The Dursleys complain about it every year. It is like the whole mouth is Harry deappreciation month.”</p><p><br/>“Unappreciation month.” Hermione corrected “Maybe you were in the magical version of Child Protective Services for a bit whilst they decided who your guardians would be.”</p><p>“Fat lot of good that did, have you even met the Dursleys Hermione? Because they didn't seem very good guardian material when we were tearing the bars off Harry's windows.”</p><p>“Well the magical world has never done much in terms of keeping children safe from harm, as far as I can tell.” Harry seemed to understand, what with all the almost dying several times in the last year. Ron seemed more sceptical, but the wizarding world was all he knew, maybe it didn’t seem as weird to him for them to constantly be in some kind of magical danger.</p><p>“Well it’s not like the muggle world help him either. What is Child Proactive Sir Vices anyway.”</p><p>“Child Protective Services.” Hermione corrected once again, “Helps to make sure every child grows up in a safe home... and no it’s not always affective.” She admitted.</p><p>“Well in the wizarding world, if you don’t have a family or want to get away from yours you just stay at Hogwarts. And that does work pretty well” Ron proudly said in defence of the magical world.</p><p>“Except you can’t stay over the Summer.” Harry countered. Ron just pulled a face and shrugged as if to say ‘You’ve got a point but is 6 weeks really that long?’.</p><p>“So do you think I was at Hogwarts when I was a baby?” Harry wasn't sure how to feel about that.</p><p>“No way, you ever seen a baby at Hogwarts? The teachers don’t have time to deal with a army of screaming toddlers. Not unless they hired my mum. No you would have gone to your Godparent. Everyone in the wizarding world has a Godparent.” Harry was shocked for a second, he never thought to think that his parents had made provisions for him for if they died. But, then his heart sank. His Godparents must have been the Dursleys “And it wouldn’t have been the Dursleys. Godparents in the wizarding world are always witches or wizards.” Or not.</p><p>“Oh I read something about this. Squibs have protested their exclusion from being able to become Godparents.”</p><p>“Well yer, magical toddlers need someone to teach them about magic.”</p><p>“Me and Harry didn’t grow up around magical people and we do just fine.” Hermione passionately protested.</p><p>“Yer well… I don’t make the rules Hermione!”</p><p>“So who was my magical godparent?”</p><p>“You have to do a spell on your arm. And it should show your godparents name. They become your godparent by making a kind of unbreakable vow to look after the child, so it leaves traces. But you don't die or anything if you break it. It's mostly just for tradition.”</p><p>“Well we can do that later. We should be listening to the rest of the history class.” Hermione clearly having her priorities as fixed as ever.</p><p>…</p><p>Harry Stared down at his arm. They’d done the spell, it was quite simple and Hermione had found the right book in record time. There was a name there, but it looked like it had been scribbled out.</p><p>“I’ve never seen that before.” Ron mussed “Then again I’ve not seen many people do it.”</p><p>“… it was during the war Harry. Maybe they died.” She tried to say it gentle. Harrys heart ached for a godparent he didn’t even know existed and didn’t know the name of. Still knowing his parents might have tried to make it so he didn’t grow up with his Aunt and Uncle did make him feel better, move loved. And he might have had a Godparent that loved him too. And who he may have lived with for six months.</p><p>“I want to know who they were, and what happened to them.”</p><p>“I’m sorry Harry. I did a lot of reading about you after finding out how important you were to the Wizarding World. I didn’t see anything about your godparent is not mentioned in any of the History books. I’ve read pretty much everything on you, and I haven’t found anything. It’s a dead end” Harry would deal with the fact that Hermione had apparently been factually stalking him later. At the minute he was too sad about hitting a dead end before he’d even started walking in the right direction.<br/>Their trio did make some attempts over the year to find the name of Harry’s Godfather. But any teacher they asked was either just as confused as Harry, or very dismissive of him. McGonagall and Dumbledore in particular insisted he just accept he didn’t know his godparent and move on.</p><p>Since that year consisted of voices in the walls, accusations of being the heir of Slytherin and a murderer to boot, kidnappings, and (once again) near death at the hands of Voldemort, the topic of Harrys godparent were not a focus of the year and quickly fell into the background. Eventually it was forgotten.</p><p>But, next year that would all change.</p>
