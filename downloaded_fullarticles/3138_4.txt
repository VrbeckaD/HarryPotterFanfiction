    <p>“I love you.” Andy said.  Ted smiled and kissed her. <br/>“I love you, too.” They were laying on his bed. <br/>“I don’t want to go home.” <br/>“I know. You can stay with me.” <br/>“No. I can’t. My parents won’t let me go so easily.” He held her hand. <br/>“I’m sorry, love. I’ll see you when Easter break ends.” <br/>“I’ll see you then.” And she left his dorm. </p><p>“I am NOT marrying Rodolphus, Bella! That’s final!” Andromeda screeched. Their parents and Cissy were out shopping when Bella informed her that she needs to tell Andy something in Bella’s room. The younger Black was not expecting this. <br/>“It’s what our parents want.” She said as if it made all the sense in the world. <br/>“I don’t care. I’m not marrying that rude fool. I’d rather marry James Potter.” <br/>“Don’t speak that blood traitor’s name.” Andy owes a lot to James. The young boy opened Sirius’ eyes. “You will marry Rodolphus.” <br/>“You can’t make me.” And with that, Andy walked to the door. <br/>“I suppose you are going to tell that mud blood pet of yours about your...pickle.” Bella said slowly, relishing in every word. Andy froze. No. Her and Ted had been careful. There was no way she could’ve found out. Andy took a breath. <br/>“I have no idea what you’re talking about, sis.”<br/>“That Hufflepuff boy. What was his name again? Ned? Anthony?” She laughed cruelly. “Oh. That’s right. Ted. Edward. Dirty Muggle name.” Andy felt her blood boil and turned around to face her crazy sister. <br/>“Leave him out of this.” She told Bellatrix through gritted teeth. Bellatrix smiled greatly, enjoying how this conversation is going. <br/>“I didn’t bring him into this, sister dear. You did. You will marry Rodolphus or I will kill-“ <br/>“What? You’ll kill your own sister?” Andy asked.<br/>“No. Never. If you refuse, I’ll kill him.” Andy saw no love in her older sister’s eyes. <br/>“No.” <br/>“Yes. I won’t do it so fast, though. I’ll torture him a bit. I wonder what his screams sounds like. I’ll let you watch.” <br/>“I’ll marry Rodolphus. Just leave Ted alone.” Bella smirked and touched Andy’s cheek. <br/>“I knew you’d see reason.” </p><p>Dearest Ted, <br/>I am writing this to you because I cannot constantly put you in danger. Which you are every second you are with me. My family will hurt you and I would rather sleep at night knowing you are safe. I am marrying Rodolphus. I’m sorry. I hope you find someone who’s not me. It kills me to say that.  I love you but move on. <br/>Sincerely, <br/>Andromeda.</p>
