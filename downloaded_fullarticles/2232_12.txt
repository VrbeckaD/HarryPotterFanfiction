    <p>When the Yule Ball was announced over dinner that night in the Great Hall, Credence had inwardly cringed. It was compulsory, Professor McGonagall had announced, and she would be running dance lessons during lunch times for those who weren’t familiar with ballroom.</p><p>He saw Newt beside him curl inwards at that. The two were terrible with large crowds, and both gave each other a pained glare when the headmaster mentioned that all students must have a date in order to attend, and if they did not then they could be accompanied by a teacher.</p><p>Credence thought he’d rather die.</p><p>No one could concentrate on their lessons that week, and even a good majority of the teachers joined in, helping students pick outfits and learn polite ballroom etiquette.</p><p>The addition of the Beauxbatons girls and the Durmstrang boys made competition for a date even more unbearable, so Credence and Newt slunk to the back of their classes, and quietly got on with their work.</p><p>He really wasn’t sure what he was going to do. He had no money for dress robes, no sense of rhythm for dancing and no romantic skill whatsoever. Even some of the girls he thought maybe he quite liked the look of, he had no hope of ever plucking up the courage to ask them to be his date. He was lanky, spotty and his voice was uncomfortably breaky – who was he to deserve a good looking girl?</p><p>Newt tried to psych him up enough to risk asking Vinda Rossier, one of the Beauxbatons gymnasts, a few days before the ball while they sat by the river in the shade of the trees, their jackets and jumpers discarded, their shirts without ties.</p><p>“Come on, think about strengths!” Newt was knee deep in the water, his trousers rolled up to his thighs, holding a small frog absentmindedly as he thought. “You’re clever, cleverer than me. You’re top in all your classes!”</p><p>Credence scoffed and let his head fall back against the tree trunk he was sitting against, the book in his lap proving unreadable due to Newt’s distraction.</p><p>“Girls don’t care about that Newt, they care about body, about looks. You’ve got that,” he shook his head, admiring Newt’s thick forearms and broad shoulders. He might’ve been as outcasted as Credence, but Newt really was well built due to his years of wrangling creatures. No wonder one of the Hufflepuff girls he shared a common room with had already mustered up the courage to ask him to go with her.</p><p>Newt could sense his annoyance at that. “Tina’s just a friend, and she only asked me so soon because we’d already planned it. It’s sort of a thing we have, y'know? Like we go together for everything if youre not there..” he trailed off, a blush covering his face as he let the frog go and stooped down to pull at some gilliweed he’d spotted, his bent over position badly disguising his smile.</p><p>Credence snorted. He knew those two had adored each other the second they met in first year. He didn’t know why he’d even bothered worrying about getting a date with Newt, he should’ve kept it to himself. Now it was just annoying – ugly weird Credence, the only boy who couldn’t get a date for the Yule Ball, when even his socially inept friend could.</p><p>“Just go ask her! You could say you’ve gone mad if she says no, and run off. She probably doesn’t even speak English!” Newt chimed in, his gaze focused on the tiny blue shrimps cupped in his shining hands. He lifted his head at the sound of students approaching just as Credence was about to sarcastically retort.</p><p>“Here she comes now!”</p><p>And true enough, there she was. She certainly was beautiful; ebony curls bouncing with every step, lily-white skin gleaming in the sunlight, rosy lips in a constant smile. Credence clung to the bark of the tree, cowering behind it as he watched her pass with a gaggle of Hogwarts and Durmstrang boys trailing after her, even some girls hopelessly following, like Tina’s little sister, <br/>Queenie.</p><p>Credence let her pass without bothering to even catch her eye, slumping against the tree forlornly.<br/>“There’s no point –“ he began, but his voice caught in his throat as his eyes fell upon a group of about four boys, almost men, in the water, shirtless, wrestling each other.</p><p>Newt glanced over carelessly at the splashing and whoops of rough laughter, and turned back to Credence with an eye roll.</p><p>“Durmstrang lot, that Percival Graves is with them as well,” he muttered, adding for good measure, “dickhead.”</p><p>Credence choked out a weak laugh, but couldn’t stop watching the thick muscles flexing as the lads swam closer to the shore, their wrestling over, all laughing breathlessly and hugging each other with their hands clasped to their chests.</p><p>Credence couldn’t deny that at some points in his teenage life he’d seen a guy or two that had piqued his interest, but mostly his attraction had been to pretty girls, which at Hogwarts there were an abundance of, but Percival Graves was something else. To Credence, he surpassed beauty – strong and stocky, the buzz cut and split eyebrow making him the perfect portrait of the fierce warriors Durmstrang was famed to produce, but the pair of earrings and puppy-dog eyes softened him terribly. Though not Russian born (Credence had read in a tabloid that Percival had actually grown up in Ireland, and only moved to join Durmstrang when he was thirteen), he was the most famous quidditch player in Russia, winning for the country every year at the world cup, and Credence had admired him as a sportsman long before he’d turned up at Hogwarts. When he’d first arrived Credence had almost fainted.</p><p>Newt physically bristled when the group walked past them, and Credence hastily shoved his nose down into his book, his face flaming. They were all so toned and hairy, their muscles glistening wet in the speckled sunlight coming through the trees, only wearing their boxers as they accio'd their clothes towards them from the other side of the bank.</p><p>Newt turned his nose up at their display of magic power at such a young age, stroppily turning his back and pretending there was some fascinating weed under the water further away from them. Credence dared to glance over at the group, amazed to see that Percival was actually the shortest, but in no less put off by it. As the boy was pulling his trousers on Credence accidentally lingered on his exposed behind, and had to hastily push the spine of his book into his crotch to will his sudden erection away, his ears burning.</p><p>One of Percival's friends snatched his shirt from his hands and threw it as far as he could, chorused by manly laughter, Percival’s included. It landed by Credence’s feet, and he froze, staring at it. With it came a spicy scent of the boy’s cologne.</p><p>“Fuck off Ivanov, you ginger prick!” Percival yelled with a grin after the lads who ran away playfully after he’d gotten one of them in a jesting headlock, waiting for him at the top of the hill. Percival shook his head fondly and turned to Credence, jogging over to him.</p><p>Credence was sweating, unconsciously trying to flatten his curls down, keeping his gaze fixed painfully on the words in front of him. Oh Merlin, he was coming over! What was he going to say? What if Percival thought he was weird? What if he saw Credence’s boner? Oh fuck it was getting worse as the boy got closer Credence wanted to fucking die-</p><p>“Hey man, mind if you pass me my shirt?”</p><p>Credence slowly, awkwardly, looked up at the boy, the sun blazing through the exact gap in the tree to make him squint hideously upwards, his nose wrinkling.</p><p>“Wh.. what?” Credence stuttered, stupidly, his brain clogging up. He wanted to die, he wanted to die, he wanted to-</p><p>“My shirt? Sorry if it hit you by the way, those guys can be a little careless,” Percival smirked, watching Credence with a cocked brow. Merlin’s beard, he was even more attractive up close. Credence could smell that thick cologne mixed with the faint odour of sweat from his wrestling, see the tight abs on his stomach, the hair leading from his naval down to his-</p><p>“U-uh.. yeah sure, here,” Credence mumbled, his voice breaking embarrassingly high on the last syllable, taking the shirt in his sweaty hand and handing it to Percival. He prayed there wouldn’t be a wet patch from where his hand had been, but even if there had been, Percival didn’t say anything, smiling brightly and pulling it on, doing his buttons up.</p><p>“I’m Percy, by the way,” he held his hand out for Credence to shake, and almost looked embarrassed when Credence shakily said he knew, and that he loved his work as a quidditch player, especially the match against France last season.</p><p>“Yeah.. suppose it’s a bit hard for me to remain anonymous here, huh?” he muttered, smirking a little to himself.</p><p>Credence nodded, still not daring to move his book from his crotch.</p><p>He dared to keep the conversation going when he saw Percival was fidgeting awkwardly. “It.. it's not all that good being anonymous though.”</p><p>Percy quirked his head at him, smiling with an unreadable expression.</p><p>“Oh yeah?”</p><p>Credence nodded.</p><p>“What’s your name?”</p><p>“Credence,” he cringed as soon as he said it. Why couldn’t he have been called Ben?</p><p>“How do you stay invisible which a name like that?” Percy grinned handsomely, and Credence felt his stomach flip. Merlin, he was going to be spending a lot of time in the showers tonight.</p><p>“I-i-“ but Credence didn’t have chance to answer, as Percy’s friends called him impatiently from the top of the hill, and he slapped Credence on the back of the shoulder and jogged off to them.</p><p>Newt bitched about Percy for the rest of the day, saying how self righteous, stupid, annoying and rude he was, but Credence was in a bubble. His shoulder burned where Percy had slapped him.</p><p>That night Credence fucked his pillow so hard it hurt, filthy images of Percy flowing freely through his mind. Percy with his lips stretched over his cock, Percy bouncing on his cock, making Percy cum untouched, holding his thick wrists behind his back, having all that power under him, crying for him –</p><p>When he came it was hard and messy, and he had to bite his knuckles hard to stop the others hearing his high pitched keen. It was at times like these he was thankful for the curtains surrounding each four-poster bed in the Slytherin dorms. He wouldn’t exactly have liked to be found naked and sweating , humping a now cum covered pillow. </p><p>Throughout the night he was plagued by Percy’s body, his mouth, his hands, and Merlin, that round, perfect ass. In the morning he fucked his fist in the shower, cumming into the water, his skin burning, his lips swollen from biting them.</p><p>Credence couldn’t help but stare at him across the tables in the Great Hall during breakfast, absentmindedly grunting in response to Newt’s rants on some damaged raven chick he’d found in the owlery. </p><p>“Credence? Are you even listening?” his friend punched his upper arm hard, and Credence yelped, gripping it. He glared at Newt, who proceeded to begin his story all over again, making Credence roll his eyes playfully, stuffing more egg into his mouth. This mornings exertions had left him hungry enough to eat a bloody horse.</p><p>The Durmstrang headmaster stood up from the head of the table the boys were sitting at, announcing something loudly in Russian, and all of them began finishing their meals quickly and exiting the hall briskly. Girls around them giggled excitedly and followed them out, and Credence frowned in confusion.</p><p>He turned to Newt but his friend seemed equally as confused, shaking his head at the foreign visitors. From the other end of the table Credence heard a girl shout, “They’re training again! Come on I don’t want to miss it, that Solokov is gorgeous!”</p><p>Credence perked up, catching Newt’s eye.<br/>“You’re not seriously going to pander to their self absorbed mating ritual are you? They’re only doing it to get dates for the ball,” Newt scorned him, and Credence watched wistfully as they all left the hall, leaving behind grumbling students angrily finishing their meals.</p><p>Credence sighed heavily. He wished he could’ve been as pretty as Vinda, who had been among the gang who’d excitedly followed them outside. He’d seen Percy hanging around with her multiple times. He suspected they were probably going together for the dance.</p><p>He groaned inwardly at the thought of the ball. It was only two days away now. He knew he was going to end up going with Professor Sprout, or someone as equally unappetising, so, in appropriate Barebone fashion, he decided to go and sulk by himself in the library.</p><p>Credence spent all morning in there, down a little isle where no one else was. He finished his potions homework and had started on his muggle studies assignment – something that wasn’t too difficult considering his muggle family back home.<br/>The one that didn’t want him.</p><p>Credence scowled into his parchment. He’d put himself into such a terrible strop that he didn’t hear someone approaching him.</p><p>“You get one of those jinxed parchments?” a soft Irish voice from the side made him jump, and Credence looked up quickly, his face clearing immediately.</p><p>Percy smiled warmly at him, smelling fresh, his hair still damp. He must’ve had a shower after training. Credence swallowed loudly, his throat suddenly very dry as he though about Percy showering. He wondered if he jerked off like Credence had, what his face would’ve looked like, what he thought about –</p><p>Credence’s face burned as he cut his train of thought short, his trousers tenting under the desk.</p><p>“Um.. what?” he croaked, blinking quickly and sitting up properly.</p><p>“Did your parchment insult you? You were looking at it pretty angrily, the most annoyed I’ve ever seen anyone at a piece of paper,” Percy chuckled cheerily and pulled up a chair beside Credence’s, placing down his pile of books. “I once got one, screamed at me in the middle of the library back at Durmstrang when I first joined. Don’t think I’ve ever been caned so fast.”</p><p>Credence blushed even further. So Percy had seen him pulling that stupid face at his work.</p><p>“They.. uhm.. they cane you at Durmstrang?” he managed to mumble out, keeping his eyes fixed on somewhere near the vicinity of Percy’s head. He couldn’t look him in the eye, not after the filthy situations Credence had imagined him in this morning.</p><p>“Sure, I mean it’s pretty strict, but you learn quick,” Percy grinned dazzlingly, and Credence nodded, eyeing the red marks on Percy’s hands. They were faded, you probably wouldn’t notice them if you didn’t know what to look for. They reminded Credence of his own – long since healed. It had been years since he’d gone home; thank Merlin for Hogwarts' all year round accommodation for students who needed it.</p><p>“What are you working on?” Percy leaned over into Credence’s space, and he panicked, his skin prickling with sweat. What if he smelt bad? What if Percy saw the obvious bulge under the desk? Oh Merlin, he smelt so fucking good, and Credence could feel the warmth radiating off his skin. If he just leaned forward ever so slightly, his lips would brush across the smooth skin under his ear, he could gently take the skin between his teeth –<br/>“Muggle studies? You have to do that here? Fuck, I can’t imagine anything more boring,” Percy laughed gently, pulling back slightly and resting his hand on Credence’s wrist, squeezing gently when he saw his frozen expression, his voice now a touch unsure. “Hey, uh, just kidding yeah?”<br/>Credence shook himself, and smiled boldly back, shaking his head.</p><p>“I-it's fine, I guess it is pretty boring,” he let himself laugh, cringing when his voice cracked noticeably. The gentle contact on his wrist was making his cock throb. He couldn’t think, his mind a buzz of heady need.</p><p>“I was wondering,” Percy began, pulling his hand away to reach for one of the books he’d brought with him instead, and Credence felt his whole body relax. “I’ve seen you round school a lot, and you’re always reading, so I was wondering if you could help with my magical history work? I don’t know if you study it, but if you could if really appreciate it,” the older boy held the book towards him, biting his lip, suddenly seeming much less terrifying.</p><p>Credence took a shaky breath, pushing his curls back out of his face, gingerly taking the book. He nodded, swallowing with a click. He could do this, he was top of his magical history class – finally something he couldn’t make a fool of himself at.</p><p>He flicked to the page Percy had bookmarked, skim reading quickly and immediately seeing his problem with the question the older boy had attempted to answer.</p><p>Credence was amazed at how well Percy actually listened to him, not even making one sarcastic comment or mean jab, and even seemed apologetic when he didn’t understand something, rather than frustrated.</p><p>When they’d finally finished the question, Credence had to go to a lesson, and he inwardly groaned. He’d much rather sit with Percy all day helping him with his homework, just as long as it meant they could sit closely and he could see that slight peek of pink tongue as Percy wrote, or that pretty smile when he got something right.</p><p>When they both stood Credence had to internally fight to keep his prick at bay, the back of his neck burning as he realised he was at least a head taller than Percy, something he’d never actually realised before, as they’d never been stood so close together. Something about the height difference made heat curl in his stomach, and he said goodbye quickly before disappearing into the boy’s toilets, rubbing himself fast with his sweaty forehead pressed against the cool stone wall, uncaring about the strong scent of piss in the cubicle.</p><p>He didn’t see Percy for the rest of the day, not until his last period, which had been cancelled in turn for the students being taken out to watch the quidditch match that had been put on; Durmstrang Vs Hogwarts.</p><p>Percy lived up to his international prowess as Russia’s best and youngest seeker, at only eighteen years old. He caught the snitch within ten minutes of the game starting, almost beating a Hogwarts record from 1672.</p><p>As everyone crowded through the cloakroom to congratulate the players, one of the Durmstrang boys shouted above the noise that there would be an after party down by the river, and everyone should try to bring as much firewhisky, gillywater and spiked pumpkin juice as they could carry without getting caught by teachers. The Durmstrang headmaster shook his head fondly and allowed the proceedings to go ahead. Strict as Durmstrang might be, when celebrating a victory for the school anything went.</p><p>Credence hung back with Newt, his fists clenched tightly in his pockets as he waited for the crowd to dissipate. Newt seemed just as uncomfortable with the throng of people all crammed into such a small place, his jaw clenching tightly.</p><p>The two of them gave up waiting and exited through the side entrance, only usually used by staff, but with no one else present the two of them risked it. Credence heard heavy footsteps behind them and for one stomach dropping second he though it would be the groundskeeper coming to scold them for going out the wrong way, but then Percy appeared next to Credence, still in his quidditch gear, much to the younger boys relief. He smiled warmly at Newt, who gingerly smiled back. As much as the chestnut haired boy didn’t like Percy, he couldn’t help himself feeling overwhelmed by the celebrity’s presence.</p><p>“You two coming to the party tonight?” he asked, almost anxiously, his gaze zeroing in on Credence, who squirmed a little. </p><p>He wasn’t sure he wanted to see all those girls clinging to Percy’s arms, watch him drunkenly kiss them.. maybe even worse..</p><p>Newt’s glare was burning the side of his head, and Credence deflatedly.</p><p>“I don’t think so Percy, we’re not really those kinds of people.”</p><p>Percy seemed a little put out, his face falling momentarily before he quickly smiled again. Credence imagined it was because he wanted them to go. Imagined he thought of Credence in the same way Credence thought of him.</p><p>He internally slapped himself. Don’t think unrealistic thoughts.</p><p>“Oh, sure, that’s too bad,” Percy squeezed Credence’s shoulder, nodding briefly at Newt before jogging back to the way he came. Credence felt himself crumple a little. He tried not to think about the party for the rest of the night.</p><p>It proved difficult. Everyone in the Slytherin common room was rushing about getting bottles of whatever they could steal or hastily brew, some even daring to try their luck at Hogsmeade. Credence thought about just tagging along, but without Newt he’d be a nervous wreck, so he put himself in a jealous sulk, and went to bed instead, burying his head under the pillow to block out the excited chatter.</p><p>Eventually it grew silent as everyone left for the forest, and Credence must’ve slept, because the next thing he knew he was waking up to an annoying tapping sound, like a stone against glass. At first he tried to ignore it, willing himself back to sleep, but it grew louder and more insistent, so he moodily tugged the curtains of his bed back.</p><p>A large grey owl stood at the window, silhouetted by the bright moonlight, his bright yellow beak tapping at the window eagerly. A thin piece of paper fluttered in its talons, and when Credence gingerly opened the window the bird dropped the note onto the tiled floor and took flight, leaving him alone.</p><p>He took the note, recognising the scrawled mess of writing instantly as Percy’s.</p><p>'Walk me back.’</p><p>Credence blinked, shutting the window as a cold breeze sifted through. Walk him back? From the party?</p><p>Credence frowned a little in confusion, but decided to go, in case the older boy had gotten himself into trouble. The forest wasn’t the safest place at night, especially if the centaurs had returned early from their mating season.</p><p>He pulled on his clothes and grabbed his wand, whispering a hushed lumos to light his way as he silently made his way out of the castle. He wasn’t much afraid of the dark, Mary Lou had seen that off for sure when he was barely three, locking him for hours at a time in the broom closet by himself. It didn’t stop the castle from being eerie in itself as he slowly tiptoed down the staircases, willing them not to move and awaken a bad tempered care taker.</p><p>When he finally made it out the air was icy, a slight frost had settled already on the grass. It crunched under his hurried footsteps, and Credence wrapped his jacket tighter around his skinny frame, his breath clouding in front of him.</p><p>It was easy to hear where the party was being held – loud cries and whoops and shouts. Happy sounds, Credence noted, and a part of him relaxed. So there was no trouble, Percy was fine.</p><p>As he drew closer he passed several group of students staggering back to the castle, some sitting on the grass talking, others smoking something that Credence had never smelt before, others drunkenly humping each other like animals, rolling about on the wet grass. Credence blinked quickly and hurried on past.</p><p>He put his wand away as he neared the site of the party. A campfire had been lit, it’s orange embers just enough to light the clearing by the water now, only about thirty people remaining, all sitting calmly or throwing up, some talking loudly and laughing hysterically, but the mad height of the party had long since passed.</p><p>Percy was laid down on the floor with a friend stood over him to make sure he was ok, smoking. Percy reached up and took the cigarette from his friends fingers, taking deep drags, until he saw Credence, and scrambled to his feet.</p><p>He almost fell over, and Credence caught him quickly. Percy’s shirt and pants were soaking wet, and Credence raised an eyebrow when he realised he must’ve fallen into the water.</p><p>“Credence, baby, I’m so glad you got my owl,” Percy slurred, wrapping an arm around Credence’s neck as the younger boy draped his coat over his shoulders to prevent him from catching a chill. His breath smelt strongly of alcohol and smoke, and Credence couldn’t help but wrinkle his nose.</p><p>“Guess you got pretty fucked up at this party hm?” he muttered, helping Percy walk, unable to stop himself finding the boy’s drunken persona to be rather cute. Dependent, like a child, but flirty. Or maybe Credence was imagine the flirting.</p><p>“Mhm, of course, but I wish you were there,” Percy pouted sweetly, gazing up at Credence’s face.</p><p>“I’ve been asleep,” Credence looked down at him, catching his gaze but panicking as he felt the heat between them, looking away quickly, his heart pounding. It was just the drink in Percy’s system, this wasn’t the real him.</p><p>Percy staggered a little and Credence pulled him back to steady him quickly. Percy flung his arms around Credence’s waist, squeezing him tightly as they walked.</p><p>“You’re so cute, helping me like this,” Percy drawled, giggling and letting his head lol onto Credence’s shoulder as they walked up the castle steps to the not so hidden side passage Credence had used to exit a few minutes prior. “I wanna kiss you Credence.”</p><p>Credence inhaled sharply, beginning to sweat again. He held Percy tighter round the waist as they walked down a dark corridor. It was just the drink, he had to remember that.</p><p>Percy absentmindedly casted a wandless lumos that hung above them like a glowing orb, following their movements. Credence swallowed audibly at the display of such magic power even when intoxicated. Wandless magic was supposed to be impossible for wizards under thirty, and even then it was incredibly difficult to master.</p><p>“Come on, it’s just a kiss,” Percy purred in his ear, grinning handsomely. He pulled Credence over to the wall, not quite pushing him against it but leaning into him enough for his back to gently press into the stone.</p><p>Credence held his shoulders tightly, heart hammering in his chest. Merlin , he wanted this so badly, but Percy’s eyes were so glazed, his movements so .. drunk.</p><p>When the older boy pulled him down to kiss him he didn’t pull away, and Percy grinned against his lips. His hands came up and gently cupped Credence’s face, but Credence kept his tightly on Percy’s shoulders, unsure of what he was supposed to do. The kiss was messy, too much tongue far too soon, but Percy had started grinding against him, and the pressure was so heady and so fucking perfect, all he had to do was reach down and grab two handfuls of that perfect round ass – maybe Percy would go on his knees for him, suck his cock right here in the middle of the corridor-</p><p>But Credence couldn’t. Not when the older boy was so out of himself.</p><p>Gently, he pushed Percy away, his own chest heaving. His face was bright red, but under only the white sparkling light of Percy’s lumos it remained undetected. Credence got a good look at Percy himself; the boy was wrecked, his pupils blown wide, basically unseeing, the bags under his eyes showing his exhaustion, and his body shivered due to the wet clothes.</p><p>Then he was sick. Credence rubbed his back, helping him through it. When Percy stood up straight again he looked barely older than Credence – a shuddering, pale creature looking up at him with watery brown eyes.</p><p>Credence sighed, took Percy by the waist again and walked him wordlessly back to the Durmstrang quarters. Percy seemed unsure of himself now, anxiously hooking his little finger with Credence’s as they walked.</p><p>“Thank you, Credence, you didn’t have to come and I really appreciate it,” Percy very quietly slurred, rubbing his eyes with the back of his wrist. Credence hummed in response.</p><p>One of the Durmstrang boys was waiting outside the quarters, probably to collect all the boys who came back late without letting the headmaster know. The boy nodded at Credence in gratitude, slinging his arm under Percy’s shoulders and walking him inside.</p><p>Percy’s lumos dimmed away as the door shut, leaving Credence by himself in the dark. When he got back into his bed the first light of dawn was beginning to break on the horizon. He felt terrible. Should he have pushed Percy away earlier? Should he have let him carry on?</p><p>He couldn’t help but think that was his one chance, and he’d blown it, but maybe he was a terrible person for thinking that.</p><p>He turned over and over in his bed restlessly, his gut churning with uncertainty, until finally he fell asleep again.</p><p>The next morning when Credence was sat eating breakfast with Newt, Percy came and sat beside him. Credence balked, his toast suddenly clumping up in his throat.</p><p>Newt thumped him on the back hard as Credence choked, giving Percy the kind of side eye he gave to the other Slytherins besides Credence’s.</p><p>“Durmstrang students are supposed to stay on their own table for meals,” Newt spoke, as indirectly as possible, whilst Credence learn how to breathe again.</p><p>His face was bright red once he recovered, barely able to look at Percy for more than half a second. The older boy looked worse for wear; his skin paler than usual, his eyes circle with dark rings of exhaustion, but his smile was small and genuine, his touch on Credence’s wrist reassuring.</p><p>“I just wanted to say thanks, for last night. You didn’t have to come, but you did, and looked after me, so thanks,” Percy’s voice was hoarse, but Credence felt the meaning behind it. He blinked rapidly to stop a sudden flow of over tired tears starting up. He hoped Percy didn’t see.</p><p>“Also, I was wondering, if you wanted to,” Percy began, dropping Credence’s gaze and staring at some invisible spot on the dark oak of the table, taking his hand off of Credence’s wrist and wringing his hands together anxiously in his lap. “Do you have a date to the ball tomorrow?”</p><p>Credence’s jaw dropped slightly. His blood roared in his ears.</p><p>“I.. I..” he stammered, not quite comprehending what Percy was about to ask him. Was this really happening?</p><p>“You don’t have to answer, I mean I was just –“</p><p>“No,” Credence interrupted hastily , desperate not to miss this opportunity. “I don’t have a date.”</p><p>Percy swallowed thickly, digging his thumb into the palm of his own hand anxiously.</p><p>“Would you.. do you want to go with me?”</p>
