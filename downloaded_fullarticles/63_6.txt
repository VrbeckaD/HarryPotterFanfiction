    <p>Harry woke with the sun, despite the lack of Aunt Petunia rattling at the door.</p>
<p>Ron’s room was still dark, as he always had his curtains drawn and the fabric was thick enough to smother all but a small, thin line of the sunlight. He laid still for a while, reaching forward to see the strip of light run over his fingers. Eventually, his stomach came knocking, and Harry slinked out the door.</p>
<p>Even after a few weeks at the Burrow, his body was still recovering from the latest lock-in. It wasn’t the first time he had been locked away – Uncle Vernon rather liked <em>that</em> punishment. Harry sighed and softly moved down the stairs, feet automatically avoiding the areas where wood rubbed against the wood. He was always hungry after the summer holidays, and it was because of a crazy house elf that he was this hungry.</p>
<p>The kitchen was empty, but there was a pot over the fire, bubbling away merrily. On the counter, several onions and other vegetables where chopped by a knife held by nobody. Harry would be all for learning charms like those if his uncle and aunt weren’t so allergic to magic.</p>
<p>“Harry! Good morning!” Mrs Weasley smiled down at him as she closed the back door behind her. “I’m afraid I only <em>just</em> started breakfast. Would you like a drink of milk instead? Keep those bones strong!”</p>
<p>Harry accepted the drink with polite thank-yous and sat at the seat which was closest to the kitchen.</p>
<p>“Off to Hogwarts again tomorrow, right? I can’t believe Ginny’s <em>already</em> leaving! And Ron’s in his <em>second</em> year!” Mrs Weasley continued to chatter as she twirled and waved her wand, ingredients and cooking utensils moving at her command. Harry smiled into his cup; magic was always a gift to watch.</p>
<p>Soon though, the preparations were done and Mrs Weasley was bustling off again, vanishing out to the backyard. Harry watched her move around the house through the various windows that were built in the Burrow. Would it be considered a ‘backyard’ if the backyard extended all around the Burrow?</p>
<p>Just as Harry finished his cup of milk he laid eyes on a book that rested at the other end of the table. It was dark, a dirty green, and was balanced so precariously on the edge he was sure it would fall off. Standing, Harry squeezed around the many mismatched chairs that were shoved into the space and picked up the bland book. It lacked a title, and as he opened it, the book showed no writing.</p>
<p>Harry touched the book, feeling the textured pages. It felt like a book made for writing; in his mind, he could see himself crouched at a desk with only an old lantern to see by, quill working furiously as he scribed his thoughts. Harry laughed at the imagery.</p>
<p>“Is that yours, Harry?”</p>
<p>He turned to see Mrs Weasley back in the kitchen, wand trained on the massive pot. It was floating away from the fire now, and a row of plates danced as they lifted themselves out of drawers and onto the table, knives and forks almost tap dancing as they did the same. It looked like it came out of a Walt Disney film.</p>
<p>Mrs Weasley took his silence as confirmation. “Well, when you go up to wake Ron, please put it back in your trunk. Wouldn’t want it getting dirty, after all!” she made a shooing gesture, turning to the pot to watch the stew pour with a critical eye. Harry turned the book over again. Well, it didn’t seem to have <em>any</em> writing in it, so he may as well take it. And if Mrs Weasley didn’t recognise it, then none of her children must own it then.</p>
<p>He ascended the stairs and did as he was told.</p>
