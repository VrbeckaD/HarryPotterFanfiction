    <p>It was the summer before 8th year started. Draco didn't want to return to Hogwarts, but his mother had pleaded with him until he gave in. The war had taken a toll on every one. His father was now in Azkaban. His mother and himself also  both stood trial. His mother was under house arrest for a year and his magic was closely monitored. One mishap and it was either Azkaban or house arrest for him as well. They only got off so lightly because of Potter and Granger. They testified for them and saved them from a much worse fate. Draco wasn't even sure why they would do that. They hated each other their whole childhood and he was a Death Eater after all.</p>
<p>He watched Granger get tortured on his living room floor and so many other unspeakable things happen. But maybe they saw something in him that he didn't. <br/>Everyone else hated him. His Slytherin friend didn't talk to him anymore and called him a traitor and they others despised him anyway.</p>
<p>That's why he found himself in Muggle London one day. People just rushed past him , busy with their own lives and thoughts. He was just one person in the crowd. And he loved it. He explored London on his own. Draco never realized just how beautiful London was. All the markets, shops , sights and parks. And muggles did all of that. They built a whole world of their own. Instead of magic they had technology and science, which he learned quite a lot about in the last weeks. His mother never commented on his daily ventures.  He left in the morning and came back in the late evening. Draco wasn't sure how he could've ever felt superior to muggles. He learned that it was probably the other way around. The wizarding world seemed backwards and set in their old ways now. Their laws and and traditions were misogynistic and discriminating against all races and magical creatures.</p>
<p>Draco was also never more ashamed of himself. As the realisation hit him he was just walking alone the Thames and he never felt more miserable. And just to add to his luck it started raining. He groaned and started looking around for a place to take shelter until the worst of the rain passed.<br/>Draco spotted what looked like to be a coffee shop, judging by the tables and chairs on the street. He rushed trough the door and was immediately hit with a wave of warmth and the smell of coffee. Other people seemed to have the same idea and were already holding mugs of coffee or tea and seated on comfortable looking chairs and sofas. The room was dimly lit and just gave off a cosy feeling.</p>
<p>He made his way around the tables  towards the bar. A girls back was turned to him, her hair flowing over her shoulders and working on the coffee machine. Draco cleared his throat and the girl turned around. She smiled warmly at him and asked: " Hi, what can I get you?" <br/>Draco swore he's never seen a girl as beautiful as her. She wasn't the obvious kind of pretty but the silent kind that captivated him and drew him in.<br/>Dracos eyes flickered above the board  over head. He quickly scanned then names and then settled on a drink. <br/>" Ehm, a chai tea please ?" He asked. The drink was new to him and he wanted to try it.  <br/>" Sure, coming right up.",  the girl said and busied herself making his drink. Draco sat down at the counter and watched her practiced movements. She caught him staring and asked :" Are you from here ?"<br/>He shrugged his shoulders:" I live a bit outside of London, but basically yes. And you?"<br/>Draco fiddled with the napkins on the table. <br/>" London, born and raised. Can't imagine a city more beautiful than this." , she said as she placed the mug down in front of him. Draco could smell the spices in the tea and and enclosed his his hands around the mug.<br/>" It smells amazing. I've never had one before.", he said as he stirred the liquid.<br/>" Oh, it's amazing. Try it. If you'll excuse me.", she said as a new customer asked for her attention. Draco tentatively started sipping his drink. He was pleasantly surprised, it tasted amazing and he would for sure drink it again. A bookshelf at the far end of the wall caught his gaze and he got up to look at them. Draco traced his fingers over the spines of the books and finally choose one titled " Pride and Prejudice" from a Jane Austen. It looked like a romance novel and he usually didn't care much for those kind of books , but this one seemed interesting. He wandered back and started reading the book. From time to time he looked up and watched the girl work. Draco hoped he didn't seem like a creep but she fascinated him. Once he was finished with his drink , he put the book back and then he went to the counter to pay.<br/>Draco walked up to her and said : " I would like to pay please." <br/>"Sure that would be 3.50 pounds.", she said in a friendly voice. He fished a 20 pound bill out of his pocket and said :" Keep the change."<br/>Her eyes went wide: " Are you sure , that's a lot of change?" <br/>" Yes, of course. ", Draco said and gave a small smile.<br/>" Well, then thank you...?", she asked.<br/>" Oh, my name's Draco. And yours?"<br/>The girl laughed:" Oh , what a unique name. My name is Y/N."<br/>" It was a pleasure to meet you, Y/N. Until next time.", Draco grinned and walked out of the coffeshop with a glance back at Y/N.</p>
