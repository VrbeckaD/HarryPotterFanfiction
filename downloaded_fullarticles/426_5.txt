    <h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
    <p>Leta first meets Theseus Scamander during a mid-morning break at a Ministry conference, about a week into her new position as Mr Travers’s assistant.</p><p>The first thing she observes as she looks him over is just how unlike Newt he appears to be. Where Newt would avoid meeting the eyes of anyone except his animals and Leta herself, the new Head Auror shakes her hand firmly, gaze expressionless and lips curved in a polite smile. His confidence is that of an older brother and head of a family, just as Newt used to say (or complain about, in any case).</p><p>“Miss Lestrange,” he greets her. “It’s a pleasure to finally meet you. Congratulations on your new appointment.”</p><p>For a Gryffindor, the elder Scamander makes an excellent liar.</p><p>“You too,” Leta responds politely. “It is well-deserved. I’ve heard so many good things about you.”</p><p>It’s the wrong thing to say, she realises immediately. Though his expression never changes, something like repressed anger glints just for a moment in his eyes (and there he is like Newt). “I don’t doubt it,” he says, and his grip on her hand tightens slightly. “Not for some time though, I would wager, since you lost your informant.”</p><p>It isn’t surprising that he blames her for Newt. It’s only the truth, after all. Still, the slightest hint of disdain from someone who at one point she’d almost fancied would be her brother-in-law makes her flinch. She regrets again her choice of attire, wool-lined in deference to a London October but far too warm for the heated Ministry building and an added heap of anxiousness.</p><p>“Mr Scamander, I…” she begins, and then falters. What can she say? <em>I’m sorry</em>? Too honest. <em>It wasn’t my fault, I didn’t ask him to take the blame? </em>Too Slytherin.</p><p>Whether thankfully or unfortunately, Scamander doesn’t give her the room to finish. “Save your breath, Miss Lestrange,” he interrupts. “While I respect your position and the contact between us that it will no doubt necessitate, I have no desire to communicate with you at all outside those bounds. Do you understand?”</p><p>Not like Newt at all. Not at all like the boy who waved goodbye to her as he walked away from Hogwarts, a final forgiving smile splashing over her like acid as she nodded brusquely in acknowledgement.</p><p>Perhaps she’s finally getting a little bit of what she deserves. Through proxy, but – “Understood, Mr Scamander,” she says quietly, and releases his hand.</p><p>“Theseus!” one of the other Aurors exclaims, approaching them. Leta takes the opportunity to slip away, grateful for once for the darkness of her complexion that hides her burning flush of shame.</p>
<hr/><p> The worst thing about this new position isn’t the fact that Travers is rather a prick. It isn’t the condescending comments he makes towards her, not when she realises that he does the same to <em>everyone </em>regardless of gender. It isn’t the occasional biting allusion to her skin or features that serve as physical and inescapable markers of the horror in which she was conceived. It isn’t even the fact that her role – despite a job description promising a stepping stone to a position that might actually allow her to use her magical skill and sharp mind – mostly involves sitting silently in a corner making the occasional note in Travers’s diary or fetching coffee and tea.</p><p>No. It’s the disdain that her family name attracts, that follow her whenever she leaves a room  of Aurors.</p><p><em>Dark magic, remember what she did in school</em>?</p><p>
  <em>Wasn’t her mother under the Imperius? Rotten to the core.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Crazy. Evil. Think she’s a Grindelwald lover?</em>
</p><p>It’s the fact that the disdain isn’t enough to spare her the resentful lust that swirls around some of them – <em>the crazy ones are the best lays </em>– <em>if she looks anything like her mother, I can almost understand old Lestrange </em>–</p><p>Those are the worst. They subside somewhat after the initial scandal of her existence in the Ministry fades, but even five months later her cursedly-sharp hearing still picks up too many unpleasant whispers.</p><p>Not all of the Aurors are like that, of course. The majority are at least polite to her face. Some of them are actually kind. There are four female Aurors – a paltry amount, and all of whom have been junior Aurors long after their cohorts have moved on – and they will invite her to sit with them for lunch from time to time. She prefers their company to that of the other assistants working on the same floor, most of whom are young and attractive women constantly vying for the affections of eligible men.</p><p>That doesn’t make up for the rest. It does not make up for the wave of guilt and shame that cascades over her whenever Theseus Scamander addresses her with unfailing politeness but otherwise avoids her like she is infected.</p><p>It certainly does not make up for Avery. Avery, who is one of the worst of the whisperers but also the worst of the sexist, lewd chauvinism that plagues the Ministry. Avery, who scoffs disparagingly when news arrives that Seraphina Picquery has been elected as the President of the Magical Congress of the United States of America.</p><p>He’s the person Leta tries most to avoid. It does not work particularly well.</p>
<hr/><p align="left">Leta knows why she’s in the room – to retrieve a file for Travers that he insists cannot wait, though she knows that it can. As Head Auror, Scamander is entitled to use any room he likes for meeting and strategizing. Why it must be the primary archives room,she has no idea; but she’s not an Auror. It is none of her business that Scamander and five Aurors are planning a raid on an old Goyle family mansion that is a suspected Grindelwald hideout, but protected by an almost-impenetrable lock.</p><p>It is none of her business that the plans they are making have one fatal flaw. As Travers delights in informing her whenever she gathers up the nerve to make a tentative suggestion here and there, Leta is a personal assistant.</p><p>So she has absolutely no idea of what possesses her to interrupt Auror Scamander mid-sentence.</p><p>But she does, with a –</p><p>“That won’t work.”</p><p>With no small amount of disbelief (on both her part and the five men in the room) all eyes turn to her. Only Amelia Bones, who is perhaps the closest thing to a friend that Leta has here, looks at all pleased by her interruption.</p><p>“I…beg your pardon?” Scamander sounds about as disbelieving as Leta feels.</p><p>Still – she can hardly back out now. Before she can be interrupted, Leta hurriedly goes on to, say, “the charm provided by your informant, to break the locks on the Goyle mansion. The spell itself will not suffice. It needs to be cast by one of good character.”</p><p>“Good character?” the Head Auror repeats. Unlike the other men in the room, his expression is one of polite interest rather than disdain.</p><p>It gives her the courage to explain, “As you know, Auror Scamander, the Goyle family are blood supremacists. Inbred, paranoid blood supremacists.” Hastily – one can never be sure just who is related to who in the Ministry – she adds, “some of them, at least. For them, good character can only mean-”</p><p>“Someone of their family, presumably.”</p><p>“If not one who bears their name, then someone with at least a grandparent who did. Otherwise, the spell will…backfire.”</p><p>A loud snort. “And how do you know all of this, huh?”</p><p><em>Oh, blast</em>. Avery, of course. “I don’t see how that is relevant,” Leta replies coolly, keeping her gaze focused on Scamander’s expression. “You are of course at liberty to disregard my interruption, Auror Scamander, and I do apologise if it is inappropriate.”</p><p>“<em>Not relevant</em>?” Avery exclaims. She isn’t sure whether it is her refusal to look at him or her tone, but she can practically feel the aggression radiating from him. “I’d say it’s quite relevant that you’re so knowledgeable about Dark magic, wouldn’t you think?”</p><p>“Take it or ignore it,”</p><p>Scamander shifts his gaze to the pile of papers before him, but Leta isn’t offended; he’s clearly thinking, processing this new information.</p><p>“Backfire,” he says finally, not looking at Leta. “In what way?”</p><p>“Oh, come on, Sir,” Avery starts to whine, “you can’t seriously-”</p><p>“Quiet, Avery,” the Head Auror snaps, not raising his voice but with enough harshness that the other man closes his mouth immediately.</p><p>Leta can feel his glare as attention shifts back to her.</p><p>“In my…from what I have heard,” she corrects herself quickly, “rather fatally.”</p><p>The Auror nods, clearly expecting such a response. “Very well,” he says, raising his head to look her in the eye. “Thank you, Miss Lestrange. The information is greatly appreciated.”</p><p>His tone is not warm, not exactly. But it’s warmer than anything he’s ever said to her. As she exits the room, Leta can feel Avery’s glare following her. It does not at all dim the smile that she only forces herself to quell when she is back at her office.</p>
<hr/><p align="left">When the <em>incident </em>occurs, she has been at the Ministry for almost nine months. After news circulated about her assistance in the Goyle mansion matter, Leta has noticed with relief that the rumours and whispers have died down almost completely.</p><p>The only person who continues them with any fervour is Avery. Amelia Bones, the unfortunate soul assigned as his junior partner, passes on the worst. Leta thanks her, though she secretly hopes that the woman will catch onto her disinclination to know just what is being said behind her back.</p><p>Particularly since she has greater concerns regarding the Auror. He begins to throw condescending endearments her way whenever she is forced to interact with him. Her approach of cool indifference begins to lose its effectiveness, particularly when the addition of casual verbal harassment is soon followed by an increasing encroachment upon her physical space.</p><p>Leta does not like endearments. She does not appreciate being touched, particularly when she pours so much energy into making herself seem untouchable. Endearments and touching have not been welcome from anyone since Newt left Hogwarts and she curled up in a hidden corner to cry till she ached. The thought of having those few previous, gleaming memories sullied is unbearable.</p><p>Least of all by Avery. Blasted Avery, who is currently already drunk only a half hour into post-work Friday drinks in the Magical Law Enforcement common area, his raucous laughter attracting annoyed stares from the rest of his colleagues. Even his team – including poor Amelia – with whom he sits are beginning to look uncomfortable. Who flails out a hand just as Leta walks past…</p><p>… coincidentally knocking over his glass. Before it can spill over her robes and shoes, Leta manages to snag it with a hastily outstretched hand. Drops of liquid pepper the pale grey fabric of her robe, to her annoyance. It’s sticky even through the sleeve, and silk is too delicate for a simple <em>Scourgify</em>.</p><p>Avery, the brute, lets out a coarse snort of amusement. “Oops. Thanks for that, sweetheart,” he says insincerely with condescension dripping from his tone, the alcohol meaning that when he looks her up and down, the lust is too obvious to ignore. It’s the most public he’s been with his harassment to date, and she can practically <em>feel </em>the awkwardness radiating from some of the onlookers.</p><p>The temptation to unleash her anger – with her fist, at the very least – is immense. <em>Almost a year</em>, she reminds herself. <em>Almost a year, then perhaps I can tell him where to put his filthy mouth</em>.</p><p>So Leta ignores the words. Turns away with the intention of leaving the glass in the kitchen sink before going home to determine how best to clean her robes.</p><p>Then she hears, “hey, darling! give me my glass back,” and feels the slap on her ass.</p><p>Even the most virulent haters of her family fall silent at that, watching with wide eyes as Leta freezes, then slowly turns back to face the man.</p><p>“Avery, it might be time to lay off the whiskey…” Amelia tells the man with some hesitation.</p><p>“What?” Avery turns away from Leta – dismissive of her, defensive towards his colleagues – to the other Aurors. “Just a bit of harmless fun, isn’t it?” It’s sinking in for him, though, she can tell from the slight tension and increasing awareness that’s breaking through his alcoholic haze.</p><p>“Come on, Avery-”</p><p>“Section 60HA,” Leta says quietly, cutting Auror Bones (though she makes a note to express her gratitude to the woman at a later point) as the attention of the rest of the table turns to her.</p><p>Avery blinks slowly, finally stuttering out a shaky “What?”</p><p>“Section 60HA of the British Ministry of Magic <em>Trespass to Person Act</em>, 1920. Any person who without the consent of another person, and knowing that that the other person does not consent intentionally, sexually touches the person, is guilty of an offence,” Leta recites, proud of herself for her steady voice despite the sweaty palms that she resolutely does not curl into fists.</p><p>It’s not just this table, now. Mr Travers is thankfully long gone, but she has no doubt he’ll hear of this tomorrow. Still, she’s committed to the cause now. Avery’s face is flushed with more than just drunkenness now, brow beginning to twitch with anger.</p><p><em>Wand in my sleeve</em>, Leta reminds herself as her gaze flickers to the belt that Avery’s hand is starting to inch toward.</p><p>“Look, this is-”</p><p>“Is something the matter?”</p><p>Leta doesn’t flinch at the sound of the elder Scamander’s voice, cutting cleanly through Avery’s blustering protestation. It’s a near thing.</p><p>“Just Lestrange being-”</p><p>Once again, Scamander interrupts Avery. “I believe that <em>Miss </em>Lestrange,” and Leta almost balks at the venom in his tone till she realises that the title is being addressed to Avery, a not-too-subtle admonishment for the drunk Auror’s omission, “is perfectly capable of speaking for herself.”</p><p>All eyes turn away from Scamander towards Leta, who realises with some discomfort that the entire room has now fallen silent. Being the centre of attention has never served her well, and while the Aurors are nothing compared to the disdain of a room full of smug Gryffindor girls, it’s still a real effort to keep her hand away from her wand.</p><p>“I was merely providing Auror Avery with a timely reminder of certain aspects of legislation,” Leta says carefully. “I understand that the stress of the practical elements of an Auror’s work may preclude one from revision of legal technicalities, and thought it helpful to provide some assistance in that regard.”</p><p>Is that <em>admiration </em>in the head Auror’s eyes? Reluctant, but still. “My apologies if it was an presumptuous path of action,” Leta adds, with a smile so aggressively polite directed at Avery that he visibly cringes.</p><p>“What do you think, Bones?” Scamander asks, attention flickering away from Leta for only the briefest moment before his gaze returns to her, once again sharp and unreadable. “Presumptuous, was it?”</p><p>From the corner of her eye, Leta spots Amelia shaking her head and obviously holding back a smile. “Not at all, sir. Just a helping hand.”</p><p>“Wonderful,” Scamander says briskly, finally looking away from Leta. “Then I trust that all of you will be receptive should Miss Lestrange – or any other of the fine ladies who work alongside us – feel the need to offer assistance of a similar kind. Is that clear?”</p><p>It’s a command, not a question. And Leta knows that it’s not for her, that it’s because Scamander is both very good at and very dedicated to his job. But it almost makes her feel protected, nonetheless.</p><p>“Yes, sir,” the rest of the Aurors mumble.</p><p>“Good. As you were, then.”</p><p>After a brief, awkward period of silence, the rumble of conversation slowly begins again.</p><p>Scamander returns his gaze to Leta as Bones carefully leads a somewhat-shaken Avery away. “Thank you for your assistance, Miss Lestrange,” he says. Before she can even begin to think of an appropriate response to that – <em>thank you for helping me? What just happened? Why? </em>– he’s walking away from her.</p>
<hr/><p>The best or worst thing to come out of that incident is that Scamander starts talking to her.</p><p>On Monday, Leta happens to arrive at the Ministry at almost the exact same time as the Head Auror. It isn’t unusual by any means, as he shares her propensity to arrive earlier and stay later. What is unusual that rather than stride across the hall to the elevator ahead of her, Scamander turns in Leta’s direction as she adjusts her robes and bag.</p><p>“Miss Lestrange,” he says, inclining his head in a polite acknowledgement.</p><p>“Auror Scamander,” Leta responds warily. <em>Likely because of the incident</em>, she reminds herself. It would be only professional for him to be a little more courteous. “Good morning.”</p><p>Slowly, she begins to walk in the direction of the elevator.</p><p>“The absence of rain is a pleasant surprise.”</p><p><em>Oh, Merlin</em>, she thinks with no small amount of horror, as she realises that he has fallen in step beside her. <em>He’s making small talk</em>.</p><p>Almost on default, her mouth responds with, “a rare occurrence in London, really. But pleasant. Yes.”</p><p>“Yes,” he repeats. “Well. Did you enjoy a satisfactory weekend?”</p><p><em>Please stop</em>, Leta begs silently. “Uneventful.” It’s difficult to keep the awkward tension with which she is burning from spilling into her voice. “But pleasant. Like the weather.” She’s hoping desperately that this is as uncomfortable for the damned Auror as it is for her. “I read. At a tea parlour.” As they reach the elevator, Leta presses the button with a little more vigour than is perhaps necessary.</p><p>“That sounds most enjoyable,” and to her dismay, he actually seems somewhat <em>interested</em>. “I rarely have the luxury of reading – nor, if I am to be honest, the inclination.”</p><p>“Oh?” His frankness surprises her, but she appreciates it more than she thought she might. “I find it provides a wonderful escape.”</p><p>She sneaks a glance at him to see a slight smile on his face. From this angle, she can see the sharpness of his features. His is a face that will age well, that is on the border of too young for authority but holds the promise of it. “So I have heard,” Scamander says, with a hint of wistfulness to his tone. “Perhaps it is worth a return to the habit, though I would scarcely know where to start.”</p><p><em>Would you like some recommendations</em>? The question forms in her mind, when suddenly the elevator opens and brings her right back to earth.</p><p>“Miss Lestrange. Sir.” Amelia nods at the both of them, moving over to make room.</p><p>Leta is resolutely <em>not </em>disappointed that the conversation ends there, before she has a chance to ask.</p>
<hr/><p>Leta starts thinking of Scamander as <em>Theseus </em>about a week before her first anniversary of employment at the Ministry. It’s to differentiate him from Newt, of course. It’s not for the fact that by now she knows that he spends Saturday mornings meticulously recording all his work at home but then becomes wickedly drunk that evening to make up for it. It’s not because every Wednesday morning she spots him purchasing a croissant from the Muggle French bakery just down the road from the entrance to the Ministry. It has nothing to do with their occasional walk together to St James’s Park to eat lunch under the early autumn sun, a comfortable silence punctuated by the sporadic remark about their surroundings.</p><p>“One year,” the Auror says on the day in lieu of greeting her, as she carefully pours Travers’s daily morning coffee. A frankly disgusting drink, and a hallmark of her employer’s year spent working with MACUSA.</p><p>Leta smiles at him. “Good morning to you too, Auror Scamander.”</p><p>“I trust Avery has laid off by now, then?”</p><p>She thinks before answering, finally settling for, “he has done nothing that I cannot take care of.”</p><p>Unsurprisingly, that response does not dissuade him. “What has he done?”</p><p>“It’s really not worth the bother. A few rumours, the occasional – but again, Auror Scamander, it is all perfectly manageable.”</p><p>Theseus doesn’t seem convinced; angry, rather. “That spineless toad,” he almost <em>growls</em> in a way that is absolutely not at all attractive to Leta. “We’ll see what rumours he spreads after-”</p><p>“<em>No</em>,” she says with surprising firmness, which appears to distract the head Auror from his swelling rage. “I am able to handle my own affairs, and I would appreciate it if you were to demonstrate enough respect to accept that.”</p><p>The man deflates somewhat, looking a little bashful. “You’re right,” he admits. “I apologise, Miss Lestrange. A flaw of mine, or so I have been informed, is an overzealous tendency towards being protective of friends and family.”</p><p>“…We’re friends?”</p><p>A little crease appears on Theseus’s brow. “We eat together almost every day. I know that you have a kneazle named Bella, that you have a weakness for French pastries, that you rather despise the resurgence in corseted female wizarding fashion – an opinion with which I concur, as you know. Yes, I would say we’re friends.” He hesitates, then adds, “only if you agree, of course.”</p><p>“Of course I do,” Leta says just a little too quickly, heart fluttering. “Very much so.”</p><p>“I’m glad that we agree.” He smiles down at her, taking his mug in one hand. “Congratulations on your first year, Miss Lestrange.”</p><p><em>Thank you</em>, Leta should probably say.</p><p>Impulsively, she reaches forward to touch her fingers lightly to his clothed forearm. “Call me Leta,” she says, before she can change her mind.</p><p>The Head Auror blinks, something like surprise flashing in his eyes before his smile widens. It sends something aflutter in her stomach. “Theseus,” he replies simply.</p><p>And then he walks away, because apparently allowing her the last word is unacceptable.</p>
