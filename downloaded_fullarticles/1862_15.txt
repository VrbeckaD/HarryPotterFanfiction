    <p>"Gin?"</p><p>"Yeah?"</p><p>"Can I ask you something?"</p><p>"You just did."</p><p>"Funny. Can I?"</p><p>"Sure, as long as you don't wake up Lily. I just got her to sleep."</p><p>"Erm, ok. What's it like, having a brother?"</p><p>"What? Ron, you realise you have five brothers, don't you?"</p><p>"Yeah, but you're a girl."</p><p>"So?"</p><p>"So, I wanted to know what it's like for a girl to have a brother."</p><p>"I wouldn't know what it's like to have a brother. I have six!"</p><p>"Funny. Come on, you know what I mean."</p><p>"Ok, fine. It's like… sheesh, I'm too tired for this discussion. Well, it depends on the kind of brother. In general they're just… loud. And smelly. And they get in the way. They break your stuff, they make endless fun of you and generally think you're some kind of weird alien. And they think you cannot do anything cool, meaning anything that they are into, just because you're a girl."</p><p>"Oh."</p><p>"Yeah. Oh. But…"</p><p>"But what?"</p><p>"But they, brothers I mean, can be really cool too. Funny, even when they don't mean to be. Protective, even when it's not necessary. Kind, usually when you least expect it. And, especially if you have six brothers, like me, there's usually one of them around to help you with all kinds of things. Homework. Chores. Or simply getting something from the top shelf."</p><p>"So, it's good for a girl to have a brother?"</p><p>"I'd say they're a mixed blessing. Both the very best and the very worst thing that can happen to a little girl."</p><p>"Oh, ok. Well. I guess it's good for a brother to have a sister too. Even if they are too smart for their own good."</p><p>"Thanks, I think? Why'd you want to know, anyway?"</p><p>"Oh. Yeah. Well, erm… in a few months' time apparently a brother is going to happen to my little girl."</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Of course Ginny's excited squeals were soon joined by little Lily's much less excited ones. But then, Lily already knew what it was to have a brother.</em>
