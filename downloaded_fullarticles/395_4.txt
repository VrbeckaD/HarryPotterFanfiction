    <p>Hermione</p><p>The whistle of the Hogwarts Express filled the air as I stepped through the brick wall and onto platform nine and three quarters. I scanned the crowd for my two best friends, of course, they’re probably running late as always. I shook my head and smiled.</p><p>I walked toward the train while carrying Crookshanks and towing my large Hogwarts suitcase behind me. As I boarded the train, I searched for an empty compartment; greeting my classmates as I walked by.</p><p>Crookshanks jumped out of my hands and into the seat next to me after I sat down. I pulled out my school bag to grab a textbook; wanting to get a head start on my classes this year.</p><p>The train whistled again signaling it was about to pull out of the station. I looked out the window to see if Ron and Harry were making their way toward the train. As if on cue, the two boys approached my compartment sweaty and out of breath.</p><p>I slammed my textbook shut and sat it next to me on the opposite side of Crookshanks. “It’s about time you two. I was beginning to think you’d miss the train again. When will you ever learn?” I placed my hand on my half kneazle and began stroking his ginger fur.</p><p>“We still found a way to school even when we missed the train.” Ron shrugged as he sat in the seat across from me.</p><p>“Yeah, after stealing your father’s magical flying car, getting spotted by several muggles, landing in the Whomping Willow and nearly getting yourselves expelled.” I raised an eyebrow.</p><p>“Oh, come on Hermione, lighten up. We made it in time didn’t we?” Harry said sat down next to Ron.</p><p>I rolled my eyes "Oh Merlin, Harry. Don’t you two take anything seriously?”</p><p>“Do you ever not take anything seriously?” Ron smirked, “Bloody hell, you’ve been at our throats since first year.” </p><p>I glared at them, “If I didn’t, you two would be killed. Or worse expelled.” </p><p>Harry was about to say something but was promptly cut off by someone new who appeared in the doorway.<br/>
“If it isn’t the annoying trio, Potter, the weasel and the mudblood.” Malfoy spat.</p><p>“Watch your mouth, Malfoy” Harry drew out his wand and pointed it at him.</p><p>“Or what? You’ll hex me?” He laughed, “You and I both know that you’re too much of a bloody goody two shoes to use magic outside school.” His normal scowl appeared on his face.</p><p>“What do you want, Malfoy?” I snapped.</p><p>He turned to me, "Just thought I’d say congratulations on making Head Girl. I guess I’ll be seeing you in our dorm.” He smirked and raised his eyebrows then walked off without waiting for me to respond.</p><p>I was shocked at first, then my anger boiled to a breaking point. “What?! Him?! I have to share a dorm with him?!” I shot up out of my seat, nearly scaring Crookshanks half to death. I already knew I was going to share a room with the head boy, but him?! How could this have happened?</p><p>I started pacing. “There’s no way he’s the smartest boy in our class. I mean, obviously I knew it wouldn’t be you two.” I paused to look at them; Ron and Harry both looked at each other and shrugged. “But him?!” I yelled, “I refuse to share a dorm with that vile, bloody ferret. I will not stand for it. I’m going straight to Professor McGonagall as soon as we arrive.” I sat down in a huff and folded my arms across my chest.</p><p>Harry and Ron exchanged glances.</p><p>“Maybe it’s not so bad. Maybe he’s a different person behind closed doors.” Harry joked.</p><p>I shot him a glare “Don’t you even joke about something like that! We all know how evil Malfoy is. He’s no better than his father who just so happens to be a Death Eater. For all we know, he could be one too.”</p><p>“Sorry Hermione, it’s just so fun to see you all worked up. Are you sure you don’t have some hidden desires for him?” Ron snickered with Harry.</p><p>I could feel my face get hot from anger. I was extremely offended by that comment. But instead of lashing out and giving them what they wanted, I simply sat back down and buried myself back into my book. I didn’t say another word to either of them for the rest of the ride.</p><p> </p><p>Draco</p><p>I made my way to the back of the train. When I got to the compartment where my friends were at, I sat down next to Blaise and Nott, who were sitting across from Crabb and Goyle.</p><p> I could still hear Granger yelling after I left. By the sounds of it, she was upset that she had to share a dorm with me. Her anger, while scary, was very amusing to me. It always had been. You'd think I’d learn after getting punched square in the jaw by her in third year, but it intrigued me even more.</p><p>I had always fancied her, not that I’d admit it to anyone. But it was fun to tease her to see what happened. I never particularly liked the word ‘mudblood'; in fact, I hated it. Blood purity was all nonsense to me anyways. What did it matter? It killed me to see her face when I called her that, but no one could ever know how I truly felt about her. I made that mistake once before.</p><p>My mind went back to my first year at Hogwarts during Christmas break. I came home talking about my little crush on Granger to my mother. She was ecstatic until I revealed who it was. My father found out and was furious. He banished me from associating with ‘her kind' and threatened to kill her if I didn’t obey. My heart was crushed. I was terrified. From that moment on, I vowed to protect her by avoiding her and teasing her to give the illusion that I hated her even though I longed to hold her in my arms; where she would be safe.</p><p>Years had passed and I had assumed my crush would go away after time, but it didn’t. I tried to force myself to stop liking her, but it just wasn’t possible. Some part of me always craved to be around her. My gut wrenched every time I saw her; wishing that I could run up to her and kiss her passionately. </p><p> I wanted to date. In fact, I had tried on numerous occasion but, no matter how much effort I put into it, no girl ever compared to her.</p><p>She may be a know it all and talk everyone's ear off on whatever subject happens to come up; but I always admired that about her. She was passionate about learning. And her intelligence is sexy as hell.</p><p>It was painful for me to know that I’d never be with her. I’d be on the sidelines like I always have been; watching her with other guys and envying them. I wanted more than anything to be with her.</p><p>“Draco? Are you even listening to me?” Crabb asked; pulling me back into the present.</p><p>“Pipe down Crabb. I’ve got more important things to worry about than your bloody problems.” I snapped back.</p><p>He glared back at me but didn’t respond.

</p><p> </p><p>The train finally arrived at Hogwarts. About damn time too. I hurried and got off the train and raced to the horse carriage. I wanted to beat Granger to the head dorm.</p><p>Upon arriving at the castle, I hurried inside to talk to Professor McGonagall to find where my dorm was and the password; after getting the instructions, I rushed to the dorm room almost out of breath. As I got up to the portrait of Dumbledore, I repeated the password McGonagall had told me.</p><p>“Et serpens leo.”</p><p>Dumbledore’s portrait began muttering something, but I cut him off and he opened the door.</p><p>I got inside to look around. I finally made it. There’s no way Granger beat me here.</p><p>As I was checking out the common room, a furry, orange cat appeared from one of the rooms.<br/>
Granger followed closely behind.</p><p>My eyes narrowed at her.</p><p>The bloody witch actually smirked at me. </p><p> </p><p>Hermione</p><p>I found Malfoy’s surprised reaction amusing. I could tell he wanted to get here first and it pleased me that it bothered him. No matter how slightly.</p><p>“How the hell did you get here so bloody fast?” He asked as he glared at me.</p><p>“I have my ways,” I raised my eyebrows at him and turned to my dorm closing the door behind me. I held onto the time turner around my neck and smiled.</p><p> </p><p>After I was finished unpacking, I changed into my Gryffindor robes and opened the door to peer my head into the common room that we shared.</p><p>Malfoy’s bedroom door was closed. I wasn’t sure if he was in there or if he had left. Either way, I didn’t want to run into him.</p><p>I hurried out the portrait entrance and padded down the hall. I wanted to speak to Professor McGonagall about our living arrangements before dinner began.<br/>
I decided she’d most likely be in her transfigurations classroom preparing for tomorrow. I went up to the door and knocked quietly before entering.</p><p>“Professor McGonagall?” I asked while walking inside.</p><p>I spotted a cat sitting on her desk, staring at me before jumping off elegantly and transforming into the gentle, graceful elderly woman “I’ve been expecting you, Miss Granger.”</p><p>Everyone knew she was an Animagus; I had learned that my first year. She was also very smart and knew nearly everything. She had to keep up with what her students were doing; she was the new Headmistress, after all.</p><p>“First of all, I wanted to thank you for the opportunity you’ve given me as Head Girl. I look forward to having the responsibility.”</p><p>She nodded. “Of course. You are the brightest witch in your class and perhaps this whole school has ever seen. You’ve earned your place.” She smiled proudly at me, pausing for a moment before continuing. “But that isn’t why you are here. Is it, Miss Granger?” She raised an eyebrow at me.</p><p>“No, Headmistress. I actually came to speak to you about my living arrangements with Mr. Malfoy.” I tried to say his name neutrally for the sake of being professional.</p><p>“What seems to be the problem? Has he done something to you?” Her facial expression turned serious.</p><p>I pondered that thought. When hadn’t he done something to me? He terrorized me; calling me names and making fun of me for the last seven years. I’ll never forget how he called me mudblood for the first time. It was second year and I had defended Ron while he was tormenting him. He turned to me and called me that foul name. I still cringe every time it escapes his lips.</p><p>“Well, not exactly, Professor. I just wondered if there were any way I could move to another dorm.” I paused to put my thoughts together before continuing. “You see, I’m sure you're aware we don’t get along that well. And while I think we’ll remain professional within our new duties, I’m not so sure we could handle living together.”</p><p>"You are correct. I am  well aware of you two not getting along. I had hoped with this title, you two could put aside your differences and work together. You’re both very bright students.” She waited as if seeing if I would change my mind. “But if it really is difficult for you two, I could try to see if I could fit one of you back into your house dormitories. I will warn you, I don’t know if there will be any room.”</p><p>I respected her, but I wasn’t going to change my mind about this. Being in the same school with Malfoy was bad enough. Now I had to share duties with him as Head Girl/Head Boy. There was no way I was going to be living in the same dorm as that ferret. I had all my hopes relying on her moving one of us rooms. “Thank you, Headmistress. I understand and I really appreciate you trying.” I smiled.</p><p>She smiled back. “You’re welcome, Miss Granger. I shall see you at our opening feast this evening.”</p><p>“Yes, of course. See you this evening.” I bowed my head respectfully and turned on my heel to leave the room.</p><p>I tried not getting my hopes up, but I couldn’t help it. I really wanted this to be a good year. It would most likely be my last, after all. I had planned to complete my N.E.W.T’s this year and graduate early. I wanted to get a job and go to a finishing school for witches and wizards next year. There would be no way that it was going to be a decent year if I had to look at Malfoy’s stupid face day in and day out.</p><p> </p><p>I entered the Great Hall and walked to the Gryffindor table. I took a seat next to Harry, who was in the middle of a conversation with Ron and Neville.</p><p>“Someone’s in a good mood. What did that bloody ferret do to you?” Ron said with a mischievous grin.</p><p>I scowled at him “Very funny, Ron” I said sarcastically, “I actually spoke with Headmistress McGonagall about changing dorms and she’s going to see what she can do about it. I hope she’ll be able to move one of us. I can’t imagine spending my year living with him.” I cringed at the thought.</p><p>“I wouldn’t count on it. The dorms are pretty booked out. Everyone’s got a flat mate.” Neville said sympathetically.</p><p>Luna turned around and looked at me from the Ravenclaw table next to ours “Don’t worry, Hermione. I’m sure it’ll all work out as it should.” She said in her quiet, melodious voice.</p><p>I smiled at her, “I can only hope.”</p><p>She smiled back at me then went back to eating.</p><p>“If it helps, I hope there’s room. I just can’t imagine living with Malfoy. That’d be awful.” Neville said.</p><p>“I hope so too. Otherwise, I’m literally going to go mad.” I agreed.</p><p> </p><p>Draco</p><p>My eyes wandered the Great Hall and I spotted her with her floozy friends. She was smiling brightly when she first sat down. I loved her smile; it was a sight to behold. I had never been the reason for her to smile but at least I got to see it from afar.</p><p>Her smile quickly turned into a frown. My guess was the weasel had said something to make her upset. Stupid red-headed babbling buffoon. I’m surprised she’s put up with him and that useless Potter for so long. Of course, I’m surprised they’ve put up with her too. The constant babbling alone would be enough to drive any sane man mad. Except me, of course. It just made me more crazy about her.</p><p> </p><p>Suddenly, there was the sound of a metal utensil tapping on glass. I turned my head away from the Gryffindor table toward the front of the room to see Professor McGonagall.</p><p>“Can I have your attention please?” McGonagall paused to wait for the chatter to die down then continued. “We are now going to proceed with the sorting of houses for the first years. Following that will be the opening feast.” Her voice rang throughout the Great Hall. She walked over to a wooden stool with the sorting hat in her hands.</p><p>At that moment, I tuned out. This had been the seventh time attending the same ceremony. Of course, the first was exciting because I had been sorted. But after that, it was just annoying to listen to something I had no interest in. I felt myself nodding off, I only woke for a split second when I heard clapping. The room went quiet and I began to drift off again.</p><p>I felt a nudge. I looked up and met Goyle’s eyes.<br/>
I looked away and turned my head to meet Granger’s eyes for a moment. She looked at me for only a  second before turning away.</p><p>I looked back to McGonagall who was finishing up the ceremony and announcing the feast. The meal appeared in front of us and we dug in.</p><p> </p><p>After dinner, I headed back to the dorm. Granger hadn’t gotten there yet. Probably talking to her weird, annoying friends. But we had our first patrol tonight as Head Boy and Head Girl promptly at curfew, which was ten o'clock. I looked at the clock. It was ten minutes until ten. Dinner usually ended at seven thirty but ran later because of the hat ceremony.</p><p>I sat in our common room and listened to the fire crackling as I waited for Granger to arrive. I heard the portrait open a few minutes later.</p><p>“It’s about damn time, Granger.” I grumbled.</p><p>“Let’s go then.” She rolled her eyes and went back out the portrait without waiting for me.</p><p>Naturally being much taller than she was and having longer strides, I caught up in no time.</p><p>We walked the halls silently. It was eerily quiet, so I spoke up.</p><p>“So how do you like being Head Girl and sharing a room with me?” I raised an eyebrow, hoping to get a rise out of her.</p><p>She glared. “We won’t be sharing a room for long. I talked to Headmistress McGonagall about switching rooms.” She said harshly.</p><p>“And here I was looking forward to seeing how hideous you look in the mornings.” I said sarcastically.</p><p>Part of my heart sank. I figured she’d try to switch rooms, but I was hoping she wouldn’t.</p><p>“No one could ever be as hideous as you, Malfoy.” She snapped back and rolled her eyes.</p><p>We continued up the corridor and ran into a few first year Hufflepuffs who were lost. We escorted them back to their house dormitory with a warning of being written up next time.</p><p>We finished our rounds then went back to our dorm without speaking.</p><p>Granger and I entered through the portrait door and walked back into our separate rooms.</p><p> </p><p>I opened my luggage to grab a few items before going to the shower.</p><p>Afterwards, I went back to my room to go to bed. The train ride had been long, so it didn’t take me long to fall asleep.</p><p> </p><p>Suddenly, I heard a creek of the door. My eyes shot open and focused on the doorway. Hermione was creeping in.</p><p>“What in the bloody hell are you doing in my room Granger?” I snapped.</p><p>She didn’t say anything, just kept coming toward me.</p><p>“Granger?! What's wrong with you? I demand you answer me!" I growled.</p><p>Still silence from her.</p><p>As she was walking closer, the light of the moon shining in my window hit her body. She was completely naked. I was shocked and confused. But I could feel my arousal stir within me.</p><p>“Granger?" I swallowed harshly while trying to keep my focus on her face instead of on her perfectly perky breasts and the tiny patch of curly brown hair that was below her stomach.</p><p>She put her finger up to her lips seductively, “shhh.” 

I broke my eye contact with her. My eyes drifted up and down her body. I nearly drooled at how perfect she looked. Her soft skin glowed in the moonlight. I wanted to touch her and run my hands all over her; licking and nipping her gently as I did so.</p><p>She appeared next to me as I was laying down. Before I could react, she was straddling me and kissing me. At first, I fought it. I was scared. But then I gave in. Her lips were soft. Her kiss had urgency and need. I felt my heart racing as she pushed her tongue begged for access into my mouth. My cock was now fully hard. I longed for her touch. This was exactly what I had needed.</p><p>She slowly moved her kisses down my jaw, my neck, my bare chest, my stomach and lingered at the top of my pajama pants. I closed my eyes at the sensation; enjoying every second of it.</p><p> She tugged at my bottoms and I helped her get them off. I could sense her eagerness. She needed me as much as I needed her.</p><p>She kissed in between my thighs below my knees and slowly worked her way up before taking me fully into her mouth. I moaned loudly as she moved her mouth up and down my shaft. She worked her tongue around all the sensitive areas. Sending chills up my spine.</p><p>I was confused at her sudden change in behavior, but it was also very arousing. I didn’t have any plans on stopping her. I leaned toward her to grab her and flip her on her back. I positioned myself on top of her, lining up with her entrance before shoving myself in. </p><p>We both moaned. I thrust deep inside her, pumping faster. After several minutes, I felt the familiar tingling sensation building up.</p><p>“Granger, I’m going to-”</p><p>She cut me off with her finger “Don’t you dare stop.”</p><p>I kept thrusting my pleasure was building quickly. Eventually it came to a peak and I released all of me inside her.</p><p>“Damn, Granger,” I panted then collapsed on top of her and rolled next to her.</p><p>She had a devious smile on her face. That made my cock nearly spring back to life.</p><p> </p><p>Suddenly I awoke sweating and panting. I looked to my side. Granger was gone. I looked down to see my pants were back on, but I was sporting a rather large erection.</p><p>It took me a minute to realize that it had all been a dream. It was another bloody dream about her. I ran a hand through my hair. I had been having dreams about her ever since third year. My crush on her quickly turned into a normal horny teenage dream and I began having sex dreams about her constantly. They were nice to think about, but it didn’t help my craving with her. I was constantly hard around her; never to be satisfied by her.</p><p>I had briefly thought about shagging random girls to get rid of my desire for her, but I never did. I could never bring myself to.</p><p>I looked back down at the large bulge in my pants.</p><p>“Well. I know one thing for sure. I need to take care of that and fast.” I whispered quietly.</p><p> </p><p>Morning came. I jumped out of bed and got ready before disappearing out of the dorm.</p><p>Arriving at the Great Hall, I took my seat amongst my fellow Slytherins and nodded a greeting towards them.<br/>
Of course, I risked glances at her every now and again, but I was careful to be quick. I didn’t want to get caught.</p><p> </p><p>When breakfast was over, I went to the dungeons to attend my first class; potions with Professor Snape.<br/>
I got into the classroom and noticed Granger sitting in the front row.</p><p>“Dammit!” I muttered to myself. It’ll be impossible to not think about the dream I had last night with her sitting right there. </p><p>Normally, I was able to control my feelings for her. I was used to them being caged. The dreams proved a little more difficult for me, but I still managed. But the fact that I was now living with her and had to face her in one of my classes first thing after the dream made it difficult to keep my thoughts under control; not to mention, my cock.</p><p>“Something wrong, Mr. Malfoy?” Snape asked; looking at me with his normal angry glare mixed with a slightly puzzled look on his face.</p><p>Granger turned around and met my eyes once Snape called my name. I quickly looked away and back up to Snape.</p><p>“No, professor.” I took my seat in the back of the classroom.</p><p>Snape went on about the sleeping draught potion. I started taking the notes as he was writing them on the board.</p><p>As much as I tried avoiding it, my eyes wandered over to look at Granger. I started imagining what I had dreamt last night and felt myself start to get aroused. I forced my gaze back to the board. Throughout class, I had to keep my thoughts controlled once they'd start to stray.</p><p>I packed up my things and nearly ran out of potions to my next class.</p><p> </p><p>Shortly after arriving in my charms class, Professor Flitwick began teaching and Granger was nowhere in sight. She’s never late. I sighed in relief. I really needed to focus on my classes if I wanted to graduate early.</p>
