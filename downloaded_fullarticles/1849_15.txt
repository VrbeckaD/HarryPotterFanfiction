          <div class="userstuff"><p dir="ltr">"Come along Scorp, we still have to stop at the <u>apothecary</u> and gran expects us for tea" his father said while striding forward.</p>
<p dir="ltr">He threw one last look at the books by Flourish and Blotts, before slightly running after his father as to catch up.</p>
<p dir="ltr">When they arrived at the shop his father went inside and he waited outside.</p>
<p dir="ltr">After a few minutes he heard a soft whining, it seemed to come from behind the garbage can. Quickly he peeked inside once, seeing his father was still busy.</p>
<p dir="ltr">At another whine this one more insisted, he made way to the sound. When he walked around the can he saw a small crup.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Upon a soft whine from the creature, Scorpius knelt down, carefully moving his hand towards it.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The hand was sniffed a few time, before the head was pushed against the palm, asking for pets.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A smile crept on Scorpius' face, petting it.</p>
<p dir="ltr">"Why hello there. Do you have a boss?" he muttered, searching for a collar with maybe an address or any.</p>
<p dir="ltr">After a few seconds he still found none. The crup was homeless and didn't have a boss. Maybe he could convince his father that the pup could be his?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Making his decision he picked the crup up, and walked back to the front of the shop.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Here his father just stepped outside, a bag full of ingredients and the like.</p>
<p dir="ltr">He walked towards his father, making sure the creature was alright.</p>
<p dir="ltr">"Come on Scorp let's go" at this point his father noticed the bundle in his son's arms.</p>
<p dir="ltr">No words were passed at first. His father looking at the creature, before slowly crossing his arms while a determined look took over Scorpius face.</p>
<p dir="ltr">"We are NOT getting a crup".</p>
<p dir="ltr">"I want to keep him".</p>
<p dir="ltr">They both said at the same time. Both their faces now wearing the same look. One of pure stubbornness.</p>
<p dir="ltr">However Scorpius knew his father was quicker to give in. Something about not being able to handle his eyes and pout.</p>
<p dir="ltr">"But dad, he would make such good company for me."</p>
<p dir="ltr">"We have no time for a pet" his father once more refused.</p>
<p dir="ltr">"But I will take care for it! Promise"</p>
<p dir="ltr">His father once more shook his head as no.</p>
<p dir="ltr">At this Scorpius started to pout, willing his face to display the saddest look he could muster.</p>
<p dir="ltr">"Well.. I suppose I will place him back then" he said, slowly shuffling back to the place "leave him all alone there".</p>
<p dir="ltr">As if on que the crup released a heartaching whine, while letting his head hang.</p>
<p dir="ltr">"Oh for the love" he heard his father.</p>
<p dir="ltr">"Yes?" Scorpius looked up hopefully.</p>
<p dir="ltr">His father seemed to be in debate with himself, shaking his head and muttering before finally looking up.</p>
<p dir="ltr">"You take care of it." his father pointed a finger at him.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Scorpius nodded quickly.</p>
<p dir="ltr">"You will walk it, wash it, feed it and teach" his father continued.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Once more Scorpius nodded, "promise dad".</p>
<p dir="ltr">His father threw him one more look,</p>
<p dir="ltr">"Okay you may keep it than. But you wash it first or it won't even go inside our house."</p>
<p dir="ltr">At these words Scorpius lunged forward, hugging his father with one arm.</p>
<p dir="ltr">"Thank you".</p>
<p dir="ltr">"Anything for you" his father muttered, gently hugging back.</p>
<p dir="ltr">With these words they went by the pet shop, to get a collar, leash, food with bowls and some toys for the crup.</p>
<p dir="ltr">After this they apparated home, in the back garden.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Here Scorpius washed the crup, while his father laughed at them. At the end the crup was clean but Scorpius was dirty.</p>
<p dir="ltr">"You need a shower too" his father exclaimed.</p>
<p dir="ltr">"Yes but first a name for him" Scorpius looked over the crup, it was brown with white and had quite a happy look on his face now.</p>
<p dir="ltr">"I'm going to name him Pads, after the story Albus told me".</p>
<p dir="ltr">A quik wave of his wand and the name was engraved at his collar.</p>
<p dir="ltr">With a slight push of his father with the words shower now, they all went inside.</p>
<p dir="ltr">And if Scorpius returned to his father petting Pads, well it just promised all good things.</p></div>
