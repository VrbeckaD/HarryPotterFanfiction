    <p>Jason was getting really sick of dying. At least this time he died in a cooler way than being beaten to death with a crowbar. Hah, yeah right. Because drowning in blood from an arrow through your lung is such a cool way to die.</p><p>So, with his aforementioned deadness, Jason was extremely confused when he woke up…again. He tried to sit up, but his arms and legs were swaddled to his sides. A short inventory of his condition had Jason even more confused. Why was he a toddler?</p><p>'<em>De-aging? Re-animation via the Lazarus pit had the by-product of enhanced reflexes, senses, and strength, but the only negative side effect was the "pit madness", characterized by bursts of disproportionate anger and an increase in homicidal intent. Maybe I died and someone didn't bring me back properly? What if-'</em></p><p>Jason's deductions were interrupted by a scream. Toddler instincts took over and Jason began to cry. <em>'This is so demeaning.'</em></p><p>The woman, who had screamed, was cradling Jason and cooing to him. Jason's wails quieted to hiccuping sobs.</p><p>The woman fiddled with a paper of some sort before carrying Jason inside.</p><p>"Petunia, dear, what happened?" A large man inquired of the woman.</p><p>"She's dead, Vernon. Lily's dead. Those <em>freaks</em> killed my sister and leave me with the whelp." The woman, Petunia, hissed. The sheer rage coming from the woman set Jason's crying instinct off.</p><p>"Hush, Sweetheart. Harry, dear. Everything's alright. Auntie Petunia won't let those nasty people hurt you." Petunia crooned. Jason calmed his breathing.</p><p>'<em>I swear, if I start crying every time something like this happens, I'm going to kill something.'</em> Jason stewed. '<em>But why did she call me Harry? Theory one: I've been de-aged-negated. Everyone I have seen or interacted with at this current time acknowledges me as a child with no questions or concessions made for the addition or retraction of memories. Theory two: reincarnation-acceptable. The time gap would be explained by the inability to remember the time I spent as an infant. I have retained most, if not all, of my memories from my past life, but have the body and instincts of my current form. Theory three: body-mind swap-bit of a stretch, but a definite possibility. I have swapped bodies with a toddler-one "Harry"- the toddler's mind is in my body and vice versa. Theory four: botched reanimation-acceptable. A ritual/spell/science experiment/Lazarus pit/some combination thereof brought a flawed version of my toddler self back from the dead. Theory five: time travel-acceptable, but by God I hope not. Sent backwards or forwards within either my personal timeline or the collectivity of time- or both. Theory six: dimension travel-acceptable, but unlikely. Temporal resonance shock-waves opened a breach in space-time sending me careening into an alternate past or future</em>.'</p><p>Jason stopped theorizing as a husky toddler walked unsteadily into the room and demanded food. '<em>If I don't get out of here soon, I'm going to go crazy.'</em></p>
