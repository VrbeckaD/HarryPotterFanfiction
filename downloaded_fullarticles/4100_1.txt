    <p>Draco pinned Hermione to the wall with his body, their tongues dueling, lips crashing together.  Hermione’s hands were wrapped around Draco’s neck, pulling him closer.  She rubbed herself against the hard front of his trousers.  His hands kneaded her breasts through her dress, his fingers pinching her sensitive nipples.  She turned her head and inhaled shakily. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Malfoy, I have to go.  My friends will come looking for me if I don’t show up to the grad party soon.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Fuck your friends.  Come with me to the Room of Requirement,” he said, kissing the sensitive juncture between her neck and shoulder.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>She pushed him slightly, ducking out of his arms.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Malfoy, I’m going now.  Don’t make this harder than it has to be.”  She righted her clothes, avoiding his angry, passionate gaze.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“This isn’t over, Mudblood.  I’m not done with you yet.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“It’s over, Malfoy.  But thank you for making it easier for me,” Hermione said, giving him a look of disgust and quickly walking towards Gryffindor Tower.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco kicked the wall, angry that he had resorted to such a hateful epithet.  He felt his eyes burn with frustrated tears.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>During the past school year, they had shared several classes.  There were few students who could keep up with Draco or Hermione, so naturally professors paired them up for several projects.  Hermione had been an excellent partner- hard working, curious, thoughtful.  She never held back compliments about Draco’s equally fastidious work, pleased that she finally had a project partner who could hold their own.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>By December of their final year of school, Draco looked forward to their nightly meetings in the library.  Unlike most students at Hogwarts, even those in his own house, Hermione challenged Draco.  She didn’t care about his fortune or his name.  Draco knew she was giving him a chance to prove to her that he was more than a rich, bigoted wizard.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>By February, Draco was kissing Hermione in dark corners of the castle, leaving purple love bites on her neck.  He loved to muss up her hair before she went back to her dorm for the night.  By April, he was fucking her in empty classrooms or sneaking into her dorm to wake her up with his tongue against her clit.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>In public, Draco acted dismissively of her.  Over time this dichotomy in his behavior bothered Hermione more and more.  Hermione had been hurt and livid when he had asked Astoria Greengrass to the Graduation Ball.  Draco had been bewildered that she was so angry with him for attending the dance with Astoria.  He had assumed she’d go to the ball with one of her Gryffindor flunkies.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>When Hermione realized Draco had chosen to hide their—whatever it was—from everyone she needed to move on.  Her parents encouraged her to attend Muggle university, to round herself out as a person, her mum would say.  She was looking forward to attending uni.  It was the perfect way for her to continue learning and would get her away from the constant judgment of the wizarding world.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Over the summer, Draco dwelled on his past interactions with Hermione.  It would make him chuckle to think of some sarcastic observation she had made or sigh to think of the look of hurt she had the last time they fought.  He regretted calling her a Mudblood during that last fight.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>While he did not value her Muggle heritage, he did think she was brilliant and passionate.  He had been with a few girls during his time at Hogwarts, but it was glaringly clear to him that they had been girls, while Hermione comported herself like a lady.  He had been around pure-bloods his entire life and the behavior of those girls lacked thought and grace.  Hermione, with her beautiful posture and giving nature, made those pure-blood girls seem coarse.  Draco knew this should not be the case, but it was.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>At night, Draco replayed their passionate encounters, masturbating to images of Hermione writhing against him.  She had been so responsive to Draco’s touch.  After Draco would find his release, he found himself longing for her sweet kisses and soft curves.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco accepted a few invitations from his fellow Slytherins.  He attended a summer get-together at the Zabini estate and found himself in an isolated area of the house with Astoria Greengrass.  She tried talking to him about Slytherin gossip, but he couldn’t be arsed to care.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Astoria was pretty, with straight, dark brown hair and even features.  Draco could tell she had spent a significant amount of time making herself look attractive.  Her shiny lips and strong perfume negatively contrasted with his memory of Hermione’s delicious natural scent and full, pink lips.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Despite his neutral feelings about Astoria, he pulled her close and kissed her.  She threw her arms around his neck and eagerly kissed him back.  The longer the kiss went on, the more suffocated Draco felt.  He untangled himself from her, kissed her cheek and wished her a good evening.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>When Draco got back to Malfoy Manor, he lay on his bed, feeling oddly detached.  He had thought he might be able to kindle an interest in someone besides <em>her</em>.  He didn’t feel revulsion from his kiss with Astoria, but he had been able to see a future with her filled with lukewarm physical attraction and insubstantial conversation.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::    </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hermione was in her element at London University.  As a first year student, she had to take several general subject classes.  Her classes were challenging and often occurred in lecture halls with hundreds of other students.  She liked that she could blend in.    </p>
<p> </p>
<p>She worked part time at the Senate House Institute of Classical Studies Library.  Most nights she shelved books or sat at the help desk.  The library, as it had been at Hogwarts, was her place of comfort.  She felt at home amongst the stacks.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Keeping herself engaged kept her from thinking about her last few weeks at Hogwarts.  When her mind would wander, she would feel a stab of betrayal at Draco’s refusal to acknowledge her as anything more than a study partner.  His parting words to her would inevitably make her chest hurt.  She had opened herself up to him and he had never considered her as more than a toy he could enjoy then discard when he tired of it.  She had given him a chance to prove that he was more than a spoiled git.  He was, in fact, worse than she could have imagined.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>But her subconscious disagreed with her on some level, because she woke up frequently having dreamt of Draco.  Her dreams were passionate, engaging, and reminded her of the connection she had developed with him.  Some nights her dreams were so real, she sobbed when she woke and discovered that she was alone in her bed.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hermione acknowledged to herself that she needed closure with Draco, but she would be damned if she sought him out. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::</p>
<p>         </p>
<p>Draco remembered where Hermione went to school and from there it was easy to locate the university library and wait for her to show up.  He wasn’t pleased to be in contact with so many Muggles, but he needed a glimpse of her.  He had charmed his hair a light brown color and wore a ball cap he had pinched from one of the students.  It helped hide his features, which anyone connected with the wizarding world would recognize in an instant.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>On his third night of wandering the massive library, he finally found her.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>What the fuck did she do to her hair? </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He sat a few meters away from the front desk where she was assisting students.  Now that he could study her, he saw that her pixie cut highlighted her big eyes and full lips.  He had grown to love her crazy mane, loved to feel it tickling his skin as she had kissed his body.  With her shorn hair, her graceful neck and shoulders were clearly displayed.  She wore a pink ballet wrap sweater with a pink tank underneath.  Draco thought she looked edgier, but still beautiful.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Her face had that same open quality that he had always found so arresting.  The women of Slytherin never truly showed their emotions, so Hermione’s straightforward reactions were a breath of fresh air.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco had thought about her anger at him over the last few weeks of school and had figured out that she had been ready for them to be a real couple, while he was reluctant to be romantically linked to her in public.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>His intense feelings for her confused him.  On the one hand, he wasn’t ready to encounter pure-blood ridicule for dating a Muggle-born.  His parents, who had chosen to live abroad for the past two years, would certainly disapprove of Hermione.  But on the other hand, the idea of her seeing someone else made him feel sick.  He saw the way the male students reacted to her, asking her a ridiculous amount of questions to keep her attention.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco followed her as she left the library.  It was almost midnight when she stopped in front of a building a few blocks from the university.  She entered a code into an electronic pad near the door, then entered the building.  Not wanting to be seen, Draco found an isolated alley and Apparated back to the manor.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco paced back and forth before the fire in his bedroom, trying to understand why Hermione would endanger herself by walking home alone at night.  He would have to follow her back to her apartment after her shifts.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Over the next month, Draco figured out her schedule.  She worked evenings Monday through Friday at the library and studied there on Saturday afternoon.  Sometimes she sat at a table with other students while she studied, but usually she sat alone, her books creating a barrier around her.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>It was during these isolated study sessions that Draco could see that she seemed somewhat unhappy.  She would stare into space for minutes at a time before she would shake herself out of her stupor to continue studying.  Having studied with her intensely the past year, Draco knew she was not quite herself.  Was it possible that she was thinking of him?</p>
