    <p>Chap 1 - Discovering Sex Magic. </p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>If there was one thing Charlie was certain of in his crazy life, it was that Magic always provided. Amendment to that thought, Magic always provided him with what he needed on his birthday. He really hoped this year wouldn’t be any different. </p><p>What was it he needed this year, you might ask? Honestly? Sex! He had everything else.</p><p>On December 12th, Charlie woke up anxious and excited. There was always the possibility for this year to be the exception. But mostly, he wondered who Magic would bring to his bed. </p><p>He didn’t have long to wait to find the answer. Someone knocked at his door as he was getting ready to go to breakfast in the mess hall. It wasn’t just any someone either. Though he wondered if maybe Magic got his wish wrong, he would not deny this was intriguing him. </p><p>It was awkward and not the gift he was hoping for. </p><p>“I was not expecting you,” Charlie said. </p><p>She smiled and kissed his cheek. “I came bearing gifts,” she said and took his hand to drag him away from his hut. </p><p>“Where are we going,” Charlie asked. </p><p>“The gift was too big to get to your house,” she said, “I called ahead and your boss rented the biggest guest house you have in the reserve.” </p><p>Charlie followed her to the least used place in the reserve, the house that was usually meant for people his boss was trying to convince to donate money and looked around as she closed the door behind him. </p><p>“They’ve been whining about never seeing you again,” She explained. </p><p>“We let them play together, and all they can talk about is ‘Dragon boy’,” Charlie heard another feminine voice coming from his left side. “So, they are all yours for a week.” </p><p>“A week?” Charlie asked Natasha surprised. </p><p>“We’ll handle the world-saving gig just fine between us,” she explained gesturing to the other women in the room. Including, who he recognized as Pepper Potts, Wanda Maximoff, and Darcy Lewis, whom he met when he was sent to the Avengers to find an escaped Dragon before the Muggles killed it. </p><p>“Last time, I had a month,” Charlie countered, “I can’t do that in a week. I’ll never walk straight again. There is no amount of magic out there that could heal me in time for family Christmas.”</p><p>When he saw the men’s defeated look he turned to Natasha with a smirk. </p><p>“Can I call for reinforcements,” he asked. </p><p>“No female,” Pepper objected. </p><p>“I remember the rules,” He told her with a grin. “I’ve got five brothers and a Savior of the Wizarding World who also need some relaxation time,” he offered. </p><p>“There are five of you,” Darcy asked looking interested. </p><p>“Sorry, Doll, same rules apply to them, they are only allowed to play with other boys,” Charlie told her. </p><p>“Boys get to have all the fun,” she pouted. </p><p>“Call whoever you need, just make sure they are alive and can walk for our Christmas Party on the 21st,” Natasha told him. </p><p>“Are they getting punished,” Charlie asked when he saw her grin, “Or rewarded?” </p><p>“Oh, no, the punishment for acting like little boys is done with,” Pepper explained. “They have been in a cock cage for a month.” At Charlie’s raised eyebrow, she explained, “They were being stubborn. Now that they finally signed a clever, respectful, and smart action accord they can be rewarded like adults.”   </p><p>Pepper and Natasha came to kiss his cheek and walked out without a glance at the Avengers. </p><p>Charlie nodded to himself and went to the floo in the other room. Only to come back with his brothers and one person who was hiding under a black cloak. </p><p>“Merlin, Charlie, you always get the best presents,” Bill said walking around the assembled Avengers with a predatory grin. </p><p>“Now, since Harry is playing,” Percy said passing around vials of a purple liquid. “Drink up.” </p><p>“What is it,” Tony Stark asked. </p><p>“Contraceptive Potion,” Percy said with a shrug. “Audrey will cut my balls off if I come back pregnant again.” </p><p>“Fleur likes it,” Bill said with a shrug pocketing the potion vial. </p><p>“Veelas don’t care who bear the kits, as long as there are kits in the household,” Percy argued.</p><p>“Mom’s okay with it too,” Fred said. </p><p>“Mom doesn’t care as long as we keep popping out Grandchildren,” Charlie said with a smile. </p><p>“Well, Audrey needs a male to inherit her father’s title, and we’ve only managed girls out of these little parties,” Percy said after drinking his potion. </p><p>“Wait, you’re serious,” Steve stated and drank his own vial, giving Bucky a look until he drank his. </p><p>“With Harry in the mix, nothing is impossible,” Charlie agreed. </p><p>“Now, who’s a strict top,” Bill asked. </p><p>Charlie raised an eyebrow at him, “did you write a list of questions?”</p><p>“Nope, but I know how he is, and we might as well try and avoid another Krum incident,” Bill explained. “That put a serious damper on our Quidditch World Cup fun.” </p><p>Seeing the looks on the Avengers’ face Charlie explained: “Harry was the victim of a potion accident. Well, it’s no accident when she tried to force-feed it to him, but the potion was done wrong.” </p><p>“Everyone knows you don’t mix Amorentia and Lust Potion,” Percy argued. </p><p>“I’m not saying she didn’t get what she deserved, I am just saying the result wasn’t on purpose,” Charlie said patiently. They were having the same argument every time. “Anyhow,” he moved on, “Harry is now an incubus.”</p><p>“Aren’t they supposed to be into females,” Tony asked. </p><p>“Harry lives to break the rules,” George teased. </p><p>“Incubus in the magical world designates anyone who feeds off sexual energy,” Bill explained, “But George is right, Harry lives to break the rules. Instead of feeding him it feeds his magic. His Sex Magic is potentially limitless.” </p><p>“So,” Clint said after the Avengers thought about it. “I thought you said you had 5 brothers.” </p><p>“Oh, yeah,” Charlie agreed. “Ron can’t come. Hermione wasn’t letting him off for a week when they have a teething baby at home.” </p><p>“We told her to come to the shack in case of emergency, Audrey arrived before you even called me,” Bill said with a resigned sigh. </p><p>“Can we get a move on,” Bucky called out. “We only have a week.” </p><p>Charlie smirked. </p><p>“Sure we can.” </p><p>“No,” Bill interrupted him. “Strict tops, first.” </p><p>A shy Bruce Banner raised his hand. </p><p>“While I don’t care either way,” he said, “the Hulk is a strict top.” </p><p>“Anyone ever bottom for him,” a pleasant, deep and smoky voice came out from under the cloak. </p><p>Thor and Loki raised their hands.</p><p>“Someday,” Strange said, “You’ve got to tell us what happened in space.” </p><p>“Perfect,” the person purred and walked to Bruce dragging him into a deep kiss. “This won’t hurt one bit.” </p><p>The cloaked man opened Bruce’s shirt and traced a rune over his heart with his tongue causing  Bruce’s voice to catch when he tried to ask what he was doing. Then the man took a step back and pushed some of his magic onto the rune. Only Strange wasn’t surprised to see the Astral projection of the Hulk surging out of Bruce’s body. </p><p>“Hulk, lean down please,” the man asked and Hulk obeyed. </p><p>The man drew a second rune on his forehead before kissing it tenderly. Hulk’s astral form solidified until he was as tangible as the rest of them. </p><p>“Hulk Smash?” </p><p>“No,” everyone cried out, but the Cloaked man just laughed. </p><p>“This is strictly for pleasure, Big Green,” he explained. </p><p>“Where pretties,” Hulk asked looking around and everyone laughed. </p><p>“I know we don’t smell as good as women,” Fred admitted. </p><p>“But we have good qualities too,” George added, hugging his twin tightly. </p><p>“You same,” Hulk said surprised. </p><p>“We’re twins,” they told him. </p><p>“You pretties,” Hulk told them and went to lay down on his stomach next to them as he watched them. </p><p>The twins shrugged and kissed his cheeks. </p><p>“Well, now that this is done,” the cloaked figure said before jumping into Charlie’s waiting arms. </p><p>“Happy Birthday, Charlie!” He cried out happily, before shoving his tongue in his mouth. </p><p>Not that Charlie was complaining far from it. He loved kissing Harry. It was a new experience every time. Keeping him on his toes. Today, Harry seemed in a playful mood and he teased his tongue over Charlie’s in little kitten licks, only caressing Charlie’s tongue hard enough for him to feel it before it retreated to lick his lips. </p><p>“Thank You, Harry,” Charlie said with a large grin as he kissed the tip of his nose then his forehead. “You always give me the best gifts.” </p><p>“Harry,” Bill called out. “Do your thing.” </p><p>Harry was about to unclasp his cloak when Charlie stopped him, kissing his knuckles in apology. </p><p>“The room, Harry,” he pointed out. </p><p>Harry grinned and looked around them, then he released his magic and every part of the floor became as soft as high thread-count sheets, and as cushioned as the best mattress money can buy. </p><p>“Kreacher and Dobby will wait on us,” he affirmed. </p><p>“Where are your parents,” Charlie asked, shivering as he remembered the last time they forgot to chase the spirits away before sharing Harry. He did not want to be interrupted by the Marauders and Lily Potter again. </p><p>“Chasing their own tail,” Harry said with a giggle. </p><p>“Severus is still being stubborn I take it,” George asked. </p><p>“I think he likes the chase,” Harry agreed. </p><p>“Are we going to have sex anytime soon,” A man Charlie had never seen before asked. His skin was dark, darker than Sam’s and his rich voice held an accent he didn’t recognize. </p><p>“I am with T’Challa on this one,” Clint agreed. </p><p>“Impatient little mortals,” Harry laughed at them, and with a sigh, he hopped off Charlie to ponce on Bill. </p><p>“Make it soundproof too this time,” Bill reminded him. </p><p>Harry’s magic covered everything and everyone around the house until it was locked tight, soundproofed and he had perfect control of everyone’s pleasure, not that the Avengers knew that and Charlie wasn’t going to spoil the surprise. </p><p>As Harry finished his warding, Bill cried out in pleasure, as Harry used him to ground the wards. </p><p>“You know I hate coming in my pants,” Bill told Harry with a growl. </p><p>“And I’ve asked you,” Harry said, “why are you wearing clothes,” he asked as he unclasped his cloak letting it pool at his feet showing his naked body to his captive audience. </p><p>Charlie loved Harry’s body. That expense of milk-white skin, covering lean muscles. His long black hair falling down narrow hips, and a peach-shaped ass. His pink lips. His emerald green eyes, which were glowing eerily with lust and power. </p><p>He walked back to Charlie and crawled onto his lap. </p><p>“Prep me,” he ordered. </p><p>As if Charlie would ever say no. </p><p>“Lube,” Charlie asked, and soon his fingers were dripping with it. </p><p>Charlie hesitated, not knowing how he wanted to play this. Harry put his arms around his neck, his fingers playing with his hair and he leaned in to say: “I love you” before kissing the pulse point on his neck. </p><p>“I love you too,” Charlie told him and forgetting his hesitation did what he knew his husband liked the best. </p><p>Keeping Harry in his lap, Charlie kissed him, gently at first, coaxing little frustrated noises out of Harry, then when the people around the room started to settle for the show, he licked Harry’s lips getting them to open immediately to his questing tongue. He loved the taste of Harry. It was sweet and spicy all in one, pepper dipped in rich dark chocolate. </p><p>As Harry got lost in the kiss, Charlie trailed his hand over the smaller man’s body, caressing every inch he had access to. When he felt as if someone would complain, (usually one of the twins) he ran his thumbs over Harry’s nipples and grinned against Harry’s lips as the simple gesture elicited a groan for the rest of the men.  </p><p>“What the F…” was interrupted by “Merlin, I love Harry’s power.” </p><p>“Oh, this is going to be interesting,” Tony said with a breathy laugh. </p><p>“Pretties kiss,” Hulk laughed, Charlie knew this meant the twins were trying to suck each other’s tongue out already. </p><p>“Your brothers are worthy,” Thor boomed.</p><p>“You’ve seen nothing yet,” Bill answer. </p><p>And to prove Bill’s point Charlie moved his lube covered fingers to Harry’s hole, he simply massaged it at first, swallowing Harry’s greedy moans dutifully. It’s when he pushed the tip of his pointer finger in that things became interesting. </p><p>“This should not be possible,” Charlie heard coming from where Loki was standing. </p><p>“Oh, God,” came from every direction, as well as deep happy sighs from his brothers. </p><p>“If this is a dream,” Clint said, “I don’t want to wake up.” </p><p>“We could die,” Bruce pointed out. </p><p>“But what a way to go,” Tony argued. </p><p>“It won’t kill us,” Steve said. “We can…”</p><p>“Do this all day,” they collectively finished, “We know.”</p><p>Bill and Percy burst out laughing. </p><p>“If you think you can outlast Harry, you are seriously overestimating yourself,” Percy told them. </p><p>“We are super-soldiers, our refractory period is next to nothing,” Bucky growled as Charlie pushed his finger deeper into Harry. </p><p>“Refractory period means nothing when Harry can make you come non-stop for three hours from one single orgasm,” Bill explained.</p><p>Charlie could hear the smug grin on Bill’s face. Wanting to shut them all up and enjoy his husband’s warm body he pushed his finger deeper and brushed against his prostate. Harry groaned, biting his lips gently pushing his hips down on his finger to chase the feeling, enticing him to do it again. </p><p>Though Harry burst out laughing when his groans were mimicked by everyone around them. </p><p>“We need to buy Natasha a mountain of shoes when we go back,” Tony said and Charlie could finally hear the first zipper getting undone, “This was her best idea to date.” </p><p>The Avengers all agreed.</p>
