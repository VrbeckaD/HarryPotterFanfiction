  <span>They hadn't been expecting it. Well,  they had been expecting him, he mused, but they had not been expecting the betrayal or that he’d be visiting this night. If they truly hadn’t been expecting him, it wouldn’t have been so difficult to find the couple. No doubt Dumbledore had warned them of the prophecy, so they’d prepared. It was rather amusing, they had been so prepared, so sure that they wouldn't have to deal with it. And yet, the thing they had warded off so fiercely had come. He had triumphed over the simpletons, and now, he would have his ultimate victory.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The prophecy couldn’t stop him. Nothing could stop him—after all, Voldemort had come, despite their prior attempts to stop him. And now, those who had so foolishly tried to hide would pay the price for trying to circumvent fate itself.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A small, imperceptible creak. The door swung open, allowing the cold air to come rushing into the house. With that air, he came. Dark, cold, imposing, Death in the flesh came striding into the house. Two words and the babysitter fell where she stood. He laughed, high and cruel. The parents were so arrogant in their defiance of Death that they had left their little hidey-hole. Voldemort stepped over the rapidly cooling body, not even stopping for an instant to ponder the futility of her resistance. He started up the stairs, towards his prey.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>What a pity that the parents weren’t here to beg for the lives of their offspring.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>James Potter was an Auror, so he should be used to death. He confronted it every day, and it stalked his every step, even when he wasn’t on the job. But when he stepped into the living room of the cottage in Godric's Hollow alongside his wife, bile rose in his throat. They were returning from an Order meeting, and they had appointed one of Lily's cousins to watch over the twins.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She lay dead on the floor in front of him now, face set in a rictus grin, fear in her eyes. Not a mark marred her body, and she lay on the floor like a puppet with its strings cut. He tore his eyes from the body, hoping that the twins had not seen it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nick. Rowena. At the thought of his children, his pulse quickened, and he leaped over the body and dashed up the stairs. Lily had the same thought, as she followed quickly after her husband, leaving the babysitter on the floor, with her look of paralyzed fright frozen on her face forever.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Upon reaching the nursery, the pair flung open the door, already dreading what they would find, subconsciously preparing for heartbreak. After all, who could survive Death? Who could fly on feet faster than his? The best you could do was hide, and that final recourse had failed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> Hearing the crying of the babies made James and Lily sag with relief, even as they darted through the shattered nursery. Rubble filled the room, chunks taken out of the walls, dust on every surface. The room looked on the verge of collapse. Once they reached the cradles, they stopped. Their little darlings were alright, they had survived! The relief swirled through the room like smoke, hiding and concealing. The true questions of the night were hidden for the time being-- if they had survived, then why? How had two defenseless children done what hundreds of others had failed to do? How had they survived the Dark Lord?</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>Albus Dumbledore stepped through the broken doorway of the Potter cottage. His best people, not hard with all of the deaths, had suddenly left the order meeting, and he knew why. The Prophecy had finally come to fruition. The night heralded the arrival of the hero that would conquer Tom Riddle once and for all. Now, for the final question. Which of the twins was it?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As he climbed the stairs, little Rowena Potter sat in the corner of her crib. Her parents had come in, gazing at the destruction with wide eyes, wondering how powerful their child would have been to have caused it. After reaching the cradles, they immediately latched onto Nick as the cause. Nick did indeed have a nasty looking cut over his heart, and a deep V-shaped scar on his cheek. However, they had failed to observe the quiet girl in the corner, looking around with her large, inquisitive green eyes. She had a cut too, less impressive, and maybe less symbolic to the unobservant parents. It was trickling blood still, not nearly as deep as the cut on Nick. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The shape of the scar was a zig-zag, a lightning bolt. One might say that it looked like the rune Sowilō if they were a professor of ancient runes, and muse about the portents of a child with the sun rune stamped on their head in these dark times. However, the runic symbology of the scar aside, if one had been fighting this war long enough, with enough experience, rather like the old man stumping his way to the nursery, they may have noticed that the scar takes on the wand movement of the Killing Curse. But to the two who were there, who had little knowledge of ancient runes, and comparatively little experience with life under a shadow, the wound bore little significance.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Just before Dumbledore entered the room, the Potter parents had managed to convince themselves that Nick had single-handedly defeated Voldemort. It wasn’t as though they cast a diagnostic on the child, like anyone with a modicum of sense would have, it was their assumptions and biases that had decided for them. As soon as Dumbledore was sighted, Lily had rushed over to him with the bundled baby. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Professor! Nick has defeated Voldemort!” Lily spoke rapidly, without a single pause in her words. She rushed on babbling about the V, and how that must have meant Voldemort marked him as an equal. It did have merit, but Dumbledore supposed he’d better check. He cast the spell—and came up with nothing. He couldn’t get a single read on the boy. By everything he had, the boy was normal. Wait, not quite normal. There was something like a residue, a foreign presence to the boy. But that wasn’t very conclusive, he was a twin after all. He was running low on energy, clearly having done something strenuous, however, and that must be good enough. Dumbledore forgot to check the other child completely. Without a second thought to the baby in the corner, he held Nick high and proclaimed him the chosen one, the boy-hero of the prophecy.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rowena began to cry. She had been ignored long enough, and she was tired, hungry, and still bleeding. Everyone turned to look at her, including her brother, still held aloft by the old man. Unlike the girl, Nick had the typical blue eyes of a baby. Just like her, he began to cry, displeased with being held by a stranger. Lily hurriedly took the boy from Dumbledore.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If Nick is the chosen one, what should we do with her?” James spoke softly, almost as if he was ashamed of himself. James had always wanted a boy and had always pictured having one child, rather like his parents had. The Potters had never had many children, as the family had been relatively infertile in the last few generations, and he hadn’t expected twins. One infant was a great deal of work, and one of James’ biggest flaws was that he could be very lazy. And so he pointed out the obvious.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Dumbledore fumbled. This was most definitely not something he was prepared for. It was true of course, that James and Lily wouldn’t be able to take care of the girl, to better focus on the boy-hero, but to have James bring it up in such a manner? Unpredictable, even by the wise old man, that a father would be so eager to be rid of his child.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He spoke, “Well, I doubt you’ll be able to take care of her as you ought to, seeing as you will be focused on training and raising Nick. It would be best to leave her to people that could take the time to tend to her, raise her well. This way, she will be out of danger. It's for the best, James, the two of you will be doing right by her. That being said, the bonds of family stretch far—do either of you have any relatives?”</span>
