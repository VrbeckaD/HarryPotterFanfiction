You're the one who told me to let the student get to know me better, to relax a bit." </p><p>"Severus, just be you." </p><p>Severus nodded his head in agreement. He knew it would work. Now he didn't have to be so nice to everyone. He took a sip of his tea.</p><p>Harry leaned in closer. "I know why you did that but one of my Christmas gifts to you is that I won't put any pressure on you to be nicer."</p><p>Severus squeezed Harry's leg in thanks.</p></div>
