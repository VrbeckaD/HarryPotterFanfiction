    <p>
  <span>Harry was </span>
  <em>
    <span>tired</span>
  </em>
  <span>. No, scratch that, he was </span>
  <em>
    <span>exhausted</span>
  </em>
  <span>. He couldn’t even walk straight. He was sure he couldn’t even do a simple spell. Cedric’s death, a month with the Dursleys, and Voldemort's reincarnation really left a tool on his body. And he felt a weird… hunger… or maybe even a thirst. It left Harry empty, cold, and pale with no magic. He honestly just wanted a break, sit on his swing deep in thoughts, about how everything had changed. He had performed a Patronus and now the Ministry wanted a hearing. He just wanted to save his life and his cousins from the Dementors. One would have thought that Hermione and Ron would have started writing to him afterwards, but they didn’t. It left Harry confused and angry; he wanted answers, but he also knew they weren’t good enough. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry walked home slowly, head bent down, when he heard a ruckus. Looking up, he saw the Dursleys throw suitcases in their car. Harry honestly just wanted to go home unnoticed, but Petunia saw him. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Not surprising, considering her long neck,</span>
  </em>
  <span> Harry thought. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Stay in your room and make </span>
  <em>
    <span>no </span>
  </em>
  <span>sound,” she sneered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes, aunt Petunia.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>-.-</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He was sleeping when he heard them enter. Harry didn’t know who they were, but he was ready to fight, or at least die fighting. Wand in hand, he began sneaking around, ready to kill the intruder. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Harry, it’s us! Your friends! Or soon to be,” a female voice shouted. </span>
  <em>
    <span>who the hell? </span>
  </em>
  <span>Harry thought. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Does she actually think I’ll fall for that?</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Nymphadora, the boy won’t fall for that,” Harry could recognize that voice anywhere; it was Moody. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Don’t call me Nymphadora!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry lowered his wand and walked towards the voices. He looked at them, there were</span>
  <em>
    <span> a lot</span>
  </em>
  <span> he couldn’t recognize, but, like he had heard, Moody was there and so was Remus. Harry smiled at them; “What are you doing here.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ha, a better question is why your hair is changing colour,” Moody said looking at Harry’s hair. Harry touched his hair self consciously. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Does it look bad?” Harry asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Of course not, pup,” Remus said.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You hesitated,” a young woman with bubblegum pink hair said. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I did not.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You totally did.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, you did,” Harry said, smirking.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Not you too,” Remus whined. Harry and Nymphadora laughed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m Nymphadora Tonks,” she said. “But call me Tonks, all my friends do.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m Harry.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We all know who you are, Potter,” Moody said. “Now, focus we have a mission!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes, sir,” Tonks saluted. Harry already loved her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>-.-</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They were flying to their the Order of the Phoenix’s secret Headquarter. Harry had always loved flying, but now all he felt was a suffocating feeling up in the thin air. He felt dizzy, ready to throw up and </span>
  <em>
    <span>thirsty</span>
  </em>
  <span>. Before he knew it, he was falling. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>-.-</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Is he… dead?” Harry couldn’t recognize the voice, it was familiar, yet not. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Of course not, Ron!” Harry gasped, sitting upright, and clutched his head in his hands.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Harry!” He didn’t know if it was one, two or twenty that shouted his name. It echoed, stretched out, became some of remix in his head. He knew people were fusing around him, shouting and he was mentally begging them to just “</span>
  <em>
    <span>shut up!”</span>
  </em>
  <span> Then there was silence and a tense atmosphere, the only audible thing was his raspy breathing. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Harry,” it was Sirius. Harry removed his hands from his ears, looking up from were his head was squashed between his knees. He was probably a mess. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Don’t come near the boy Sirius!” Harry literally hissed at the woman, Mrs Weasley he realised. She gasped, her eyes big.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Harry, what’s wrong with your teeth!” Hermione shouted, and he just wanted to know why they couldn’t realise that it hurt when they rose their voices. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“He’s been turned into a vampire!” Ron screamed, making Harry groan in pain. “Everyone run before he eats you.” No one moved. Except for Ron. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Someone, get Dumbledore, he’ll know what to do!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“SILENCE!” Harry whimpered, hiding his face in his hands. He felt a pair of hands, that were slightly rough, join his hands. Another pair was playing with his hair. “Harry, are you okay?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No,” he sobbed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What can we do for you, pup?” Remus asked in a soft voice. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I want… silence,” he looked up, seeing Sirius sitting in front of him, both hands on his. Remus was still playing with his hair. The other people in the room were just staring at him. “My ears hurt.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“They’re sensitiv,” Remus whispered, it didn’t feel like a question, but Harry nodded. “Mhm, do you want to sleep?” He nodded again. “Do you want us to stay till you fall asleep?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Just you and Siri,” Harry said.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“But, Harr-” Hermione started, she stopped when she noticed Remus and Sirius glaring at her. “I’m sorry I shouted.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>That isn’t the only thing you should be sorry for,</span>
  </em>
  <span> Harry thought. By the hurt look Hermione sent him, his thoughts weren’t as silent as he liked to believe. She closed the door gently behind her. It left a hollow feeling in Harry’s chest. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>-.-</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So, Harry did you get bitten?” Remus asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Of course he did, Moony,” Sirius said.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What?” Remus began. “He doesn’t smell like one.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“How- what?” Harry said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You smell like death and sickness,” Remus said.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Even </span>
  <em>
    <span>I </span>
  </em>
  <span>can smell that,” Sirius said, wrinkling his nose.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Do I really smell that bad?” Harry asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, of course not, pup,” Remus said.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You hesitated,” Sirius said.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Why?” Remus said exasperate. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Do you guys think I’m dying?” Harry asked before they could fight like an old married couple. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>There was a tense silence before Remus said; “Did anything happen to you? Did someone bite you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, I-” Harry stopped, remembering Voldemort’s reincarnation. “Voldemort took my blood.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Dumbledore said-” Remus began.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It is alright Harry, I’m here” Dumbledore interrupted, gaining a not so subtle glare from Sirius. Harry needed to ask him about that later. “Now tell me everything.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>There was an awkward silence. “Um, I don’t really know what to say?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“When did you get bitten?” Dumbledore said, sitting on an awful looking pink chair he had conjured.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry looked at Sirius, wondering whether or not he should tell Dumbledore. Sirius signed, then nodded. “I think it was when Voldemort took my blood.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Dumbledore signed; “Harry, why didn’t you tell me this earlier?”</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
  <span>“I… don’t know,” Harry said, looking downcasted. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“My boy, becoming a Vampire is hardly as big a problem as what Voldemort could do with your blood” Dumbledore had lost that twinkle in his eyes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I didn’t know! Everything been like hell ever since Cedric died! I mean do you think I </span>
  <em>
    <span>like </span>
  </em>
  <span>being tor-” They stared at him, openly gawking. “What?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Harry your eyes,” Remus said. “They turned… red.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I-” Harry began looking at Dumbledore, he suddenly felt like a huge weight had been casted upon him, making him tense and ready to fight, kill even. “Get. Out. Off. My. Mind.” Harry sneered, glaring at Dumbledore, pulling his lips back to make sure he had a good view at his sharp teeth. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Professor, let Sirius and I talk with Harry,” Remus said, standing up, and opened the door for Dumbledore. Harry briefly saw members of the Order standing near the door, they were quick to hide. “We’ll give you a… raport… later.” Harry was sure that they wouldn’t. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Harry,” Dumbledore paused, making sure he had the boys attention. “I apologize, that was out of line.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Promise you won’t do it again!” Harry snapped. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I promise.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Remus closed the door, while Sirius put up a bunch of spells, to make sure no one heard anything. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We should take an inheritance and blood test tomorrow,” Sirius said, while looking at Remus, then at Harry. “The tests shows inheritance, magical and blood illness’, and a lot more. It was how we found out-” Harry didn’t hear what they found out; He fell asleep to the sound of their voices. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>-.-</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Pup wake up,” Harry groaned and slapped his hand over his eyes; he just wanted to sleep. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“He’s just like Lily,” he heard Remus laugh. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wha,” Harry said, his voice slurring. He sat up, rubbing his eyes. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Your mother used to be tired all the time when she was pregnant with you,” Remus said while smiling. “Prongs always used to fuss, making sure she was comfortable.”</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius laughed; “I remember her calling Prongs a ‘Mother hen who had no chill’.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That was when her water broke,” Remus said, laughing. “You cried, Padfoot.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ha! We all cried,” Sirius said, looking fondly at Harry. “Well, pick some clothes, pup, you’re going out with Moody today.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Where are we going?” Harry asked, standing up. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“To pick up some clothes for the trial,” Remus said. “And to Gringotts.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What should I do about the trial?” Harry asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’ll teach you, pup,” Sirius said. “Purebloods make up the Wizengamot, so we’ll have a lot of learning ahead of us.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>-.-</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry had always loved Gringotts, the magic was ancient and somehow familiar to him. Seeing Remus nod to the guards standing by the entrance made Harry realise how disrespecting he and other Wizards and Witches were towards them; So, he also greeted the Goblins. It seemed to surprise them, which only made Harry feel worse and more determined. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hello, we’re here to ask for a inheritance and blood test,” Remus said, looking serious, and for some reason holding Harry’s arm like he was going to run away. Harry needed to ask him about that later. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wait,” the goblin said signaling for another employee to come over. “Get Griphook.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>There was an awkward silence while they waited. The Goblin glared at Remus, while Remus looked at everything except from the Goblin. Harry also needed to ask him about that. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Excuse me sir, what is your name?” Harry asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The Goblin looked shocked; “My name is Bogrod, Mr Potter.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry nodded; “Well, I was wondering, Bogrod, and I hope this isn’t disrespecting, but why is it that Wizards think that Goblins are lesser beings, but still trust them with their money?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Because you Wizards are morons,” Harry and Remus turned around to look at the new Goblin, Griphook, Harry remembered. “Let’s go to my office.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They walked to the office when Harry said; “Hello Griphook, it has been a long time since we last spoke.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“One must say you’ve been busy, Mr Potter,” Griphook said, after sending him a (terrifying) smile. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Please call me Harry,” Harry was scared he had said something stupid, because Griphook wiped his head around to stare at him. “Did I say something wrong?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, M- Harry,” Griphook said, though Griphook still stared at him like he was a puzzle that  needed to be solved. “Asking a Goblin to call a Wizard by their given name means you admit we are equals.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well, we </span>
  <em>
    <span>are</span>
  </em>
  <span> equals,” Harry frowned.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Griphook grimaced; “Not many of your kind think the same.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry frowned at that comment.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We’re here now,” Griphook said while opening the door. The room was huge, there was a desk with three chairs, there were old magical artifacts and scattered around the room on shelves that were alongside the walls except for the big window behind the lone chair by the desk. It was overall very luxurious, but also business like. “I have requested for an inheritance and blood test, so it should be here any minute. Make yourselves comfortable.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They sat down, then Remus said; “Griphook, can I be here when he takes the test?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes, if you have M-Harry’s permission.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“He has,” Harry quickly said. “I’m a little nervous. What should I do?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Just let three drops of blood fall on the parchment and let magic do the rest,” Griphook said. “You can also tap at your properties with your wand to see where they are.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Don’t be nervous, pup,” Remus said, even though he himself looked nervous.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The door opened up and a Goblin walked in with two parchment, a knife, and a little box, with something light blue in it, the kind Malfoy used for his lips after that one time Hermione had punched him in the face.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What is your name?” Harry said, again the Goblin looked shocked at Harry’s display of human decency. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s Nagnok,” The Goblin, Nagnok, said, still surprised.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Thank you, Nagnok,” Harry smiled. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nagnok still looked surprised when Griphook said; “My reaction was the same, my friend.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nagnok nodded, bowed, which made Remus gasp, and left the room. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Let’s get down to business, Harry” Griphook said, ignoring what had just occurred, Harry did the same. “If the illness you have shows on the paper then we won’t need the blood test, but if you want then you can also purchase it, just to be on the safe side. The inheritance test is 80 gallons and the blood test is 60, both of them are 130.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“If I get answers that surprises you then I want both of them for 110,” Harry smirked, Remus looked at him like he was possessed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Only if the answers visibly surprise me,” Griphook smirked back. Harry took the knife, picked his middle finger, and made sure only three drops fell on the parchment he assumed was the inheritance one. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Now we wait a couple of seconds,” Griphook said. “The answers are appearing. Due to law; I need to see it first, Harry afterwards, and you last Mr Lupin.” Griphook took the paper, quickly reading it. Harry was terrified of what the Goblin saw, because his mouth dropped to the floor. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What? Is there something wrong with him?” Remus said, pale as a sheet. Griphook gave Harry the parchment. </span>
