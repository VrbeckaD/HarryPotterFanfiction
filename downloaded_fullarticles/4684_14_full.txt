    <p>Neville hastily looked down at the table, pretending to be entranced by the half-drunk cup of coffee in front of him. He could still hear the poorly muffled whispers and giggles though, and this alone made his face flush uncontrollably. Even now, over three years since the battle, he'd not yet gotten used to the hoards of female admirers he somehow attracted. It was ridiculous. How they'd not realised he was just boring old Neville Longbottom, apprentice herbology lecturer and long time plant-enthusiast, he'd never know. </p><p>He'd like to be able to say that his reluctant status as some kind of sex symbol (he had even stolen the coveted ‘Most Eligible Bachelor’ title from Harry last year, and was tipped to win again this year much to his dismay) was the most surprising thing that had happened since the defeat of Voldemort, but that accolade would probably have to go to Harry and Draco who had announced their engagement in the Prophet just last week, to everyone's shock.</p><p>Which brought him back to why he was waiting in the Banshee’s Nipple, a bar on Diagon Alley that had recently become popular with the hip and fashionable set amongst wizarding society; a set which Neville resolutely discounted himself from. Oh, how he wished he was back in his favourite greenhouse with nothing but the murmuring of the Cannibalistic Honey Suckler bush for company. But no, for some reason unbeknownst to anyone but the great Harry Potter, he'd been picked as the aforementioned wizard's best man so now he was forced to wait for the other best man, one Blaise Zabini, so they could discuss best man things. He had no idea why Harry hadn't chosen Ron. Well, no, that's a lie, he had some idea - Ron had never gotten on board with Harry and Draco’s relationship - but he hadn't wanted to press for details. He wasn't salty about being asked; it was an honour, truly. But had he known being best man would involve sitting in a trendy bar by himself while witches all around him dared each other to approach him, he might have reconsidered. Why couldn't Blaise have agreed to meet in the Leaky Cauldron or, better yet, in his small office at the back of Greenhouse 7?</p><p>“Longbottom! Sorry to keep you. Meeting overran. You know how it is.”</p><p>Neville smiled, relief coursing through him. At least with Blaise finally here, some of the female attention would be diverted. Blaise had a tendency to draw all the eyes in the room and he positively thrived off the attention. Neville stood up to greet Blaise with a handshake but the other man gripped his hand and yanked him in for a suffocating hug. Neville startled, his arms dangling uselessly at his side.</p><p>“How’ve you been? I can't believe my boy Draco finally tamed the saviour! Crazy, eh?” Blaise said as he drew back from the hug.</p><p>This wasn't the first time they'd seen each other since school; thanks to Harry and Draco, there'd been several nights out where the different friendship groups had crossed over, but this was the first time Neville had spent any time one-on-one with the self-confessed playboy of Slytherin. It was nerve-wracking to say the least. He'd always found Blaise to be quite intimidating; he was so brash, so confident. He entered a room like he owned the place and he never seemed to be without a gorgeous witch, or occasionally a wizard, dangling off his arm. If anyone should have won Witch Weekly’s ‘Most Eligible Bachelor’ award, it was him. </p><p>Neville watched as Blaise summoned a staff member with a wave of one perfectly manicured hand.</p><p>“I, er, I'm not sure they do table service here,” Neville said quietly, leaning across the table towards Blaise.</p><p>“Nonsense! They can't expect people like us to fetch our own drinks.”</p><p>A youngish woman with a nametag that read Elinor Grimblehawk approached their table with a polite smile. “Good afternoon Mr Zabini, Mr Longbottom. What may we get for you?”</p><p>“I'll have a double espresso, and my good friend here will have another one of those, ah, Lattes, is it?” Blaise gestured to Neville’s mostly-finished latte and Neville nodded. He didn't particularly want another one, but he got swept up in the moment. “We’ll also have a fire whiskey each, top shelf mind. Thank you.” Blaise shot her a broad smile so dashingly radiant that even Neville’s knees felt a little weak. The waitress, or whatever she was, blushed and stifled a giggle.</p><p>“Right away, sir.” She turned to Neville and he froze as he suddenly became the centre of attention. “Can I just say, it's an honour to have you here, Mr Longbottom. Thank you for what you did in the war.” She inclined her head and bustled off to the counter before he could respond. Neville felt the ever familiar heat of a blush creeping up his neck and settling on his cheeks. He risked a glance at Blaise and was astonished to see a very un-Blaise like soft smile on his face. It was quickly replaced by his typical cocky smirk though, so thinking back on it, Neville wasn't even convinced he'd seen it.</p><p>“Let's get down to business then,” Blaise said, with a clap of his hands. He produced a large folder from a bag at his feet that Neville hadn't even noticed. “Now, firstly, we need to find out whether there will be two separate Stag parties, or will they want a combined one? One would be more simple, but I can't see Draco allowing Harry to participate in any of the traditional stag activities if he's there, so maybe two separate parties is preferable? And would the guest list be the same for both? There'll obviously be some crossover so parties would have to be on different nights. And then there's the entertainment! Now, I've gathered together a list of….”</p><p>Blaise continued to talk at Neville for the next hour, pausing every so often when he needed a yes or no, or when he needed badger the staff for more preferential treatment. Neville just listened and nodded when required; he had no clue what went into organising a stag party, or any party for that matter, but Blaise was clearly in his element so he let him get on with it.</p><p>-------------------</p><p>The next time Neville saw Blaise, it was thankfully on more neutral ground. He took a tentative sip from his takeaway coffee cup (nope, still too hot) and looked around the grand hall he was currently standing in. Okay, so maybe ‘neutral ground’ was a bit strong— it wasn’t exactly a usual setting for him, but at least it wasn’t open to the public.</p><p>“Oh, it’s absolutely beautiful. What do you think, Neville?” Hermione gushed, her hands clasped to her chest. He watched her spin around, trying to take in everything at once, grateful that he wasn’t standing there like Nobby No-Mates again. Now they just needed Pansy and Blaise to show up.</p><p>“Yeah, it’s alright, I guess.” He replied. To be honest, he couldn’t really see Harry being comfortable with it, but what did he know. Maybe this was the sort of place people had engagement parties in. Blaise had found it, and he seemed to know a lot about parties.</p><p>“Hmm, I guess you’re right, it doesn’t really scream Harry,” Hermione said after a moment’s more reflection, as if reading Neville’s mind. “But, it’s certainly very ‘Draco’, so I’m sure Harry will love it for that.”</p><p>Pansy was the next to show up. She was firmly in the ‘pro’ camp for the venue, unsurprisingly, and enthused over the shape and size of the sconces for a solid ten minutes. Not for the first time, Neville found himself wondering why on earth these people insisted on involving him in this strange practice. He thought wistfully about the purple blooms on his Drooping Ninnies and started mentally planning his pruning schedule for the next week.</p><p>“Ladies! Glad you could make it. You’re both looking divine. And Neville,” Neville spun around in time to see Blaise striding towards him with intent, “you look positively dashing.” His voice dropped down a register to a seductive purr which, when combined with the arrogant smirk, did all sorts of funny things to Neville’s insides.</p><p>“Alright, Blaise.” He said weakly, as the man engulfed him in another suffocating hug. Blaise’s hugs were like nothing on this earth, Neville decided, mid-squeeze. Maybe it was because they were of an equal height and build. Neville didn’t often get hugged by other men— usually it was small, dainty women (being a tall, well-built, man, nearly every woman was dainty by comparison), like Luna, or Hermione, or Ginny who hugged him. Harry was also fairly small and dainty, comparatively (not that Neville would ever call him that to his face), and Ron was more of a back-patter than a bear-hugger. Most people Neville knew, however, stuck to handshakes or shoulder slaps. No one had ever hugged him like Blaise had. Now that it wasn’t so unexpected, he could enjoy it for what it was; strangely comforting, warm, and reassuring. Neville slowly raised his hitherto limp noodle arms and hugged Blaise back.</p><p>“Okay boys, break it up. There’ll be plenty of time for <i>that</i> after we’ve sorted out the venue. We’ve still got another five to view today, remember.” Pansy shouted from the other side of the hall. Startled, Neville stumbled back from the embrace and hurried over to where Hermione and Pansy were firing questions at a terrified looking wizard, who either worked here or had taken a wrong turn and was now suffering the consequences. Neville shook his head to dislodge the strange feeling that had crept over him. What did Pansy mean? And why did he feel like his grandmother had walked in on him with his hand down his pants? He risked a glance back at Blaise and once again caught that strange, soft, smile on his face, before it was quickly replaced by a more Blaise-ish expression. Neville’s stomach did a little flip for absolutely no reason he could fathom.</p><p>------------</p><p>The day of ‘the search for the perfect engagement party venue’ would go down in history (if Neville had any say in the matter) as the longest, and most pointless day of his life. They had spent hours apparating between venues, pouring over leaflets, terrorising stewards, and generally arguing about everything from the colour of the drapes to the size of the door handles and Neville was officially DONE with the whole fucking palaver. What grated the most was that Blaise, Pansy, and Hermione had decided, at long last, that the first venue was the best (dependent on Harry and Draco’s approval), so Neville couldn’t find it in himself to view the day as ‘well spent’. If this was how nightmarish it was to sort a venue for the engagement party, into how many more levels of hell would they have to descend to sort out a venue for the actual wedding? With any luck, Harry and Draco would be able to tear themselves away from each other for long enough to help out. Or Drooping Ninnies might fly (and you didn’t need to be a herbologist to know that would never happen).</p><p>----------</p><p>Neville clung to the bar as it were a lifeline in a sea of drunk Hogwarts alumni, Ministry employees, and generally important people. He was happy for Harry and Draco, really he was, and he felt enormously honoured to be such an important part of the wedding party, but seriously, was an engagement party strictly necessary? The happy couple looked radiant with joy as they danced, their bodies in constant contact, like neither could survive without the touch of the other. It was both beautiful, and yet thoroughly vomit-inducing, how the former enemies completed each other.</p><p>Neville sighed and sought out something else to watch; he’d had enough of being reminded just how far removed he was from his own engagement party. He hadn’t had a proper girlfriend for almost two years, and had only had a handful of dates since then. It’s not that he didn’t get offers. As much as it sickened him to acknowledge it, he could probably have his pick of the witches that fawned over him whenever he stepped out in public, but he didn’t want someone who only liked him because of what they’d read in the Prophet or Witch Weekly. He wanted someone who saw past the fame, someone who didn’t care he was the ‘Most Eligible Bachelor’, maybe someone who shared his love of plants, and wouldn’t mind when he spent all his time in the garden or in a greenhouse. He didn’t think it was a big ask, but his empty bed and his string of failed relationships and first dates, seemed to suggest otherwise. He’d thought he was onto a winner with Hannah; he had even been able to imagine them growing old and grey together, but she had eventually grown tired of fighting for attention against his plants. She was here tonight, actually. He’d seen her waltzing past with her husband— an ox of a man who wouldn’t know the difference between an apple and an onion —and she looked really happy. She had never looked like that with him.</p><p>The barman topped up Neville’s glass without him asking. He must have sensed his dark mood. Getting drunk would be a BAD IDEA, but he was three, maybe four, drinks down so it was looking like the decision would soon be out of his hands. He scanned the room again from the safety of his barstool and found his eyes drawn to Blaise. The man was in his element, working the room like he’d been born to it; shaking hands, kissing faces, smiling broadly. Every person he spoke to was made to feel like the centre of his world and it was mesmerizing to watch him work his charms on everyone. Neville knew exactly what it felt like; Blaise was the same with him. He would look at Neville like no other person existed in the room, and it felt good. So good. </p><p>Neville frowned as a pretty, young, witch pressed herself against Blaise’s body. She was clearly not shy about going after what she wanted; it was embarrassing to watch. Surely Blaise wouldn’t fall for such an obvious attempt at seduction? </p><p>“She doesn’t stand a chance.” Pansy drawled, following Neville’s line of sight as she slipped onto the stool beside him. “Blaise has always preferred the chase. He likes a challenge.”</p><p>“Yeah? But he could have anyone he wanted, where’s the challenge in that?”</p><p>“Really? Anyone? Hmmm. He’s actually mid-chase at the moment. The current object of his affection is completely oblivious so it’s proving to be quite a monumental challenge. Call me an old romantic, but I think this person might be quite special to him, if only they’d realise.”</p><p>“Oh.” For some reason, this news weighed heavily on him. He felt like a light had gone off inside of him, like a tiny flicker of hope, of desire, had been extinguished before he’d even acknowledged its existence. “Do, ah, do you know who it is? The girl he likes?” Neville asked, not entirely sure he wanted to know the answer.</p><p>“Of course I know them, sweetie. It’s not for me to say though. You’ll find out in good time. Blaise always gets what he wants, one way or another.” She smirked and patted him on the cheek with a hand made cold from the drink she’d held. She slid off the stool and weaved her way through the crowd, soon disappearing from sight.</p><p>Neville’s eyes locked on to Blaise again. The girl was nowhere to be seen, but she’d been replaced by three others and Neville fought to keep the frown off his face. He knocked back his drink and grimaced.</p><p>“Another?” The barman asked, gesturing with the bottle.</p><p>“Nah, you know what, I think I’m going to try get laid instead,” Neville replied. If Blaise didn’t want those girls, maybe he could pick up one of his rejects, just for the night. He was the right amount of drunk for casual sex with a stranger to sound like the perfect solution to his loneliness. Perhaps he could even talk Blaise into teaching him some of his tricks. Merlin knows he needed all the help he could get.</p><p>------</p><p>Neville pushed open the door to the Banshee’s Nipple. Somehow, this ridiculously overpriced bar had become the meeting point for all official Harry and Draco wedding preparation meetings so Neville found himself frequenting the place far more regularly than he wanted. However, tonight was not supposed to be about wedding talk. Blaise had decided the wedding party needed to bond and apparently consuming poncey drinks in an overcrowded, trendy, nightspot was the way to go about it.</p><p>It was Friday night and the place was heaving. The bar was several people deep and all the tables, which were actually quite pleasant to sit at during the day, were hidden by the sheer mass of people gathered around them. Neville searched in vain for a familiar face, but it was near impossible to see anyone in the low lighting. He decided the best thing to do would be to get a drink, then maybe he could stake out a patch of real estate by the bar and keep a look out for Blaise or the girls. Before he could squeeze through the masses, however, he felt a familiar weight across his shoulders, and smelt that cedar-infused cologne favoured by Blaise. He turned his head, just in time to catch a big, wet kiss on the side of his mouth. </p><p>“Nevvie! Nevvie Nevvie Nev Nev!” Blaise crowed in his ear. “You made it!”</p><p>“I didn’t think I had a choice.” He replied, leaning in towards Blaise so his voice could be heard over the music.</p><p>“There’s always a choice, my beautiful man. Always.” He grinned and patted Neville’s face with his free hand. </p><p>Neville pulled back fractionally, both so he could see Blaise’s face properly and also to protect his eyeballs from being melted by the alcohol on Blaise’s breath. “So, ah, where are the girls? Are they here yet?” He asked, craning his neck slightly to scan the crowd.</p><p>“Um, yeah, about that. This isn’t really an ‘official’—” Blaise lifted his hands to do air quotes, miraculously managing to not spill any of his drink “—Harry and DrayDray meet-up. I just said that to get you here. Actually, this is more of an apology night out to make up for being a shitty wingman at the engagement party the other week and not getting you laid. So, yeah, no girls tonight, Nevviekins, just us guys. Thought we could bond, or, you know, whatever.” Blaise still had his arm hooked around Neville’s neck, and his face was so close, Neville could feel his lips tickling his ear as he spoke. His voice was a low rumble that sent shivers down Neville’s spine. He wished one of the tables would free up; he didn’t trust his legs one bit. He reached out to steady himself on a nearby pillar. It wasn’t that Blaise’s voice playing across his ear turned his knees to jelly, it was just that the other boy was half cut and was leaning his full weight against him. Yes, that was it.</p><p>Neville smiled weakly. “Sounds good.” He wasn’t about to disagree with Blaise when the other boy was draped over him so closely that their noses would rub together if Neville turned his head any further. He drew in a shaky breath as Blaise withdrew, causing a sudden pang of emptiness; a desperate yearning for contact appeared from nowhere, shocking Neville with its intensity. Before he could panic or whimper, Blaise curled a hand around his wrist and tugged him through a door he hadn’t spotted to the left of the bar.</p><p>The room in which Neville now found himself in was almost as busy as the one they’d left behind, but the music was quieter and the conversations between patrons appeared to be more subdued. Blaise led him to an empty booth and pulled Neville onto the bench beside him. A bottle of wine and two glasses were already on the table, and Blaise reached over and poured them each a drink. Neville was speechless. He had so many questions, but he was incapable of forming words so they just queued up in his head. How did Blaise find a table so easily? Where did that wine come from? Why was Blaise looking at him like that? </p><p>Blaise spent the evening regaling Neville with stories about his day to day adventures, and asking question upon question, probing Neville about every aspect of his life; it was more than a little unnerving. As the night wore on, Neville found himself drinking just to give his hands something to do and to distract himself from staring at Blaise. For some reason, no matter how many sips he took, his glass never emptied— though whether this was down to Blaise surreptitiously refilling his glass, or an illegal <i>never-run-dry</i> charm, he wasn’t sure. All he knew was that he was slowly losing his grip on sobriety.</p><p>Was Blaise like this with everyone? It’s no wonder the man never had any trouble picking up girls; his voice rumbled at the exact frequency required to turn Neville’s insides into mush, and that cologne surely had some kind of amortentia-like potion mixed in considering the effect it was having on him right now. Before Neville knew what was happening, he found himself leaning in, nuzzling his nose into the crook of Blaise’s neck to get closer to the source of the delicious aroma. He was vaguely aware of Blaise tensing beside him, but then he seemed to relax and Neville felt a hand travel up his arm and come to rest on the back of his neck. A tiny part of him was screaming ABORT ABORT ABORT STOP THIS NONSENSE IMMEDIATELY before he did something ridiculous but drunk-Neville squashed it down until it became a tiny blip in his consciousness and wasn’t loud enough to hassle him anymore. </p><p>Neville slowly became aware of Blaise’s fingers moving delicately across the skin on his neck, teasing the hairs at his nape. He released a shuddering breath and pushed his face further into Blaise’s neck. He felt Blaise tilt his head. Was he inviting Neville to get closer? What exactly was going on? Neville’s brain felt sluggish and unresponsive. He was vaguely aware that what they were doing, (whatever it actually was) was probably a BAD IDEA but the message got twisted up and lost before he could act upon it.</p><p>Blaise’s fingers left the back of his neck, lightly trailed along his jaw, touch as soft as silk, and gently pressed on Neville’s chin to tilt his head up. He followed the movement, unresisting. Blaise’s breath fanned across his face— when had they gotten this close? Neville could see every little detail of his face; the way his dark eyelashes perfectly framed his deep brown eyes, a little mole on his cheek only just visible on his dark skin, a small scar on his chin, those full, perfect lips, moistened by his perfect pink tongue— why was he staring at Blaise’s mouth? Was it getting closer?</p><p>Before Neville knew what was happening, he felt Blaise’s lips against his. Those perfect, perfect lips. Neville pushed back, increasing the pressure, and opened his mouth, inviting Blaise in. Suddenly he couldn’t think of anything but tasting Blaise, taking everything he was willing to give. This was insane. He was kissing Blaise fucking Zabini, playboy of Hogwarts. Him! Clumsy, shy, Neville Longbottom! What on earth was he thinking!?</p><p>Wait. He was kissing Blaise Zabini.</p><p>Neville’s brain suddenly caught up with events and he leapt back as if burnt. One hand flew to his mouth, the other gripped his hair. What. The. Fuck. He drew in a shaky breath and chanced a look at Blaise. The man looked as shocked as Neville felt, his hands held up in a placatory gesture. Neither of them moved for a few terrible, awkward moments. Neville slowly backed away and got up from the table. His legs felt like jelly— was that the booze or the mortification? Blaise watched him cautiously, and looked like he might try and speak, but Neville didn’t need to hear his accusations of impropriety to add to his shame.</p><p>“I’m sorry. So sorry. I don’t know what happened. Please, please, forgive me. I have to go. Sorry.” Neville blurted, the words tumbling over themselves to get out. He turned away from Blaise and dashed out of the private room before the other man could say anything. </p><p>------</p><p>Following ‘the incident’ Neville couldn’t even bring himself to speak to Blaise over floo or reply to his owls, let alone meet with him face to face, so he begged off the next few wedding meetings. Luckily Hermione kept him up to speed with all the important decisions, such as Draco’s demand for napkin rings decorated with precious stones that exactly matched the tone of the drapes and flowers— should they match the stones with the flowers, and drapes, or match the drapes with the flowers and stones, or… Well, Neville really could not care less so he excused himself from that particular discussion after saying he would find flowers to match whatever colour they wanted if they gave him enough time.</p><p>Then Hermione showed up to Hogwarts in person one weekend, without warning Neville so he’d been unable to pretend he was too busy to see her (coming up with convincing lies was not one of his strong points). She claimed she was concerned about him following his string of no-shows, and he actually felt a bit guilty, but there was no way he could tell her about drunkenly assaulting Blaise; she’d lose all respect for him.</p><p>“The engagement party is next week, in case you’d forgotten. You will be there, won’t you?” Hermione asked pointedly as they settled down for tea and biscuits in his office. </p><p>Neville cursed under his breath. He hadn’t forgotten, how could he? But he’d put a great deal of effort into pretending that it wasn’t actually happening, and he had almost believed himself.</p><p>“Blaise said he tried to talk to you about what you need to bring, but you’ve not been responding to his owls. I assume that means you already know your responsibilities for the evening?” She eyed him over the top of her tea and Neville felt the colour rise in his cheeks. He had no bloody clue what his responsibilities were— every single one of Blaise’s letters ended up unopened in the bottom drawer of his desk. He quickly pretended to be interested in the sickly looking plant that was sat on the work table. Maybe if he was lucky Hermione wouldn’t notice his guilt-stricken face.</p><p>“Er, sure, yeah, I know.” He mumbled at the plant. Merlin, there was no way Hermione couldn’t see right through his crappy excuse for a lie. He chanced a glance over his shoulder and there was no missing her narrowed eyes and pursed lips, but thankfully she hastily schooled her expression into something less...knowing and changed the subject. Had Blaise told her anything? No, surely he hadn’t or she would be yelling at him right now rather than chatting amiably about how much the school had changed since they attended. But maybe this was all a ruse? Maybe she was lulling him into a false sense of security and would call him out in front of everyone at the party? Neville felt sick. He could barely hear her over the sounds of his churning stomach and racing thoughts. He hoped he didn’t look as pale and clammy as he felt.</p><p>“Well, anyway, I should be going. I promised Pansy I’d meet her for lunch.” She stood up, dusted a few stray biscuit crumbs off her top, and leaned in to hug Neville. “You should drop Blaise a note or something. He’s not said anything, but I can tell he’s worried about you.”</p><p>“Sure, I’ll, er, do that. Yeah.” He said, feeling the fresh guilt of that little lie settle down on top of the mountain of all his other guilt. </p><p>“Oh, one more thing before I forget. Here.” Hermione held out an envelope and watched Neville expectantly. Well, here it was, the big ‘call out’. This was obviously a court summons or an arrest warrant or something. <i>Neville Longbottom, you are wanted for the crime of throwing yourself at Blaise Zabini and generally being a drunken sex pest</i> it would say. They’d send him to Azkaban. He couldn’t go to Azkaban! They’d eat him alive there! He nervously reached out and clasped the envelope in a clammy hand.</p><p>“Honestly Neville, anyone would think I was handing you your death warrant,” she laughed, unaware of how close to his line of thought she’d come. “It’s the schedule for the party next week, annotated with everyone’s duties, just in case you misplaced Blaise’s letter.” </p><p>“Oh! Oh, right. Thanks!” He sagged with relief and offered her a shaky smile. She might not know what happened between him and Blaise, but she definitely suspected something. The woman was too clever by far. </p><p>After having said their goodbyes, again, Neville sat down and smacked his head against his desk; once, twice, and then a third time for good measure. With all the stress of worrying about Hermione finding out he was a sexual predator, he’d completely forgotten just who would be at the engagement party. There was no way he’d be able to avoid the man for the whole night, and Harry would kill him if he sacked off the party. There was no more putting off the apology— he’d just have to hope that Blaise wasn’t too mad at him and wouldn’t demand the Aurors take him away in chains. He smacked his head down for a fourth time. </p><p>“Steady on dear, you’ll damage the table!” Professor Sprout’s cheerful voice carried in through the open door as she bustled past, chuckling to herself. Neville groaned and smacked his head down once more, just because. Life was so much more simple before this stupid wedding.</p>
