  <b>1996 - summer</b>
</p><p>The sharp knock at the door stirred Tonks from something which resembled sleep and she mumbled, “Come in.”</p><p>Snape walked in, closing the door behind him and casting simple wards and silencing charms. This was the third day of his visits to work on curses she sustained during her latest mission for the Order. He put more potions on the table beside the bed and in the sunlight which filtered through the half-closed curtains, she watched him stand, arms crossed, while she woke fully.</p><p>She knew hours had passed. The sun had set and risen. Recovery was nothing new. Recovering without Sirius was. Each injury brought a hangover drenched in remembering he wasn’t there when she came around.</p><p>Remus returned to Lupin Cottage with Tonks once she was able to leave St Mungos after the attack on the Ministry. Tonks lost her cousin. Remus lost his other half. And when neither were working or on missions for the Order, their hours together were disproportionately quieter. Sirius was one person but both lost him. Different versions of him no longer treading the floorboards in the dead of night to jump on her bed and ask about gossip at the Ministry or to be led to bed by a blushing Remus. The Sirius who yelled at Kreacher was missing along with the Sirius who ran to save Harry from Voldemort. Remus still functioned. Still did as the Order asked. Survived two transformations since the Battle of the Department of Mysteries. Tonks was cursed twice and survived. They survived together. A friendship which didn’t need strengthening was forged anew by Sirius’s death.</p><p>Tonks stretched and winced. Rolling onto her back, she rubbed her face and stared at the ceiling. Since she joined the Order of the Phoenix, Snape was called upon with increasing frequency to put her back together. An Auror and a metamorphmagus, she knew she could do what many couldn’t. She wanted to be useful and did as requested. Snape healed Tonks’s wounds caused by Dark Magic and the Order sent her out again. The cycle repeated itself and she collected scars with a vigour which only increased in the wake of Sirius’s death. Even when they were all alive and in Grimmauld Place, Remus would try to have conversations with Snape outside Tonks’s bedroom door, everyone knowing she could hear. All but her hoping she might change course on her desire to collect obscure scars as she attempted to do everything in her power then more. She wondered if Remus would try again when Snape was done with her for the day. In his visits to heal the curse which left deep purple lines across her belly, only once had he mentioned that she might choose to be more careful in future. She knew then his fellow Death Eaters had managed to hit her with something worse than usual.</p><p>Turning her head, she saw him standing, arms crossed, a few feet from the bed. He arched an eyebrow. She pushed her hair from her face then pulled her top up over her belly and her pyjamas down to her hips. He sat on the edge of the bed and ran his fingers over the marks still crisscrossing her skin. His touch was light and a moment later his wand was barely an inch from her as he murmured words too softly for her to catch.</p><p>When she winced, he looked up at her and she shook her head. Potions to ease the pain and discomfort would only inhibit her healing and, regardless, the work he needed to do wasn’t going to be quick. She wouldn’t draw it out longer and she had refused so often he had stopped offering. He raised his wand when she forced herself to take deeper breaths. Screwing up her eyes, she knew the worst was yet to come as he drew the Dark Magic out of her. Though she didn’t recognise the words, she already knew the pattern of his voice when it came to dealing with this curse, knew he was about to hit the - </p><p>Yelping in pain, she pulled up her knees. His arm was firm against her legs and held them back. The first time it happened, he stopped and let her curl up on herself, which meant starting over from the beginning. She told him to stop her if she did it again. Panting from the waves of pain surging through her body, her legs strained against his arm though he was unmoved and his concentration didn’t waver. Her hands entangled in her hair, fingers digging into her head, she tried to swallow the cry which threatened to spill from her lips.</p><p>Then his arm was no longer against her legs and his hand was on her belly. Opening her eyes, she saw him watching her, the curiosity in his gaze as he no doubt waited to see if she would have a delayed reaction. He’d once commented on her tendency towards encores. She had sworn at him then apologised when she threw up a few minutes later. Slowly her legs sank back to the bed and her arms fell against the pillow. A shiver raced through her and she groaned. Beneath his hand she felt her breathing begin to steady.</p><p>“You did well,” he said.</p><p>She managed a weak smile and more tension left her. “How much longer?” </p><p>“A few days,” he said, with the flash of an apologetic smile. They both knew she ought to have been at St Mungos. They both knew the Order’s reasons for keeping her at Lupin Cottage. “Same potions as yesterday. Take them all.” </p><p>His hand barely moved from her belly when she stopped him.</p><p>In amongst the chaos, his gentle touch was an unexpected relief. Never firmer than need be when at her request he held her back. He didn’t condemn her when she threw up as he drew Dark Magic from her. He waited patiently when she was rendered slower by pain and repeated questions without sneering when he tried to find out how she ended up on the wrong end of another Death Eater’s wand.</p><p>She traced the topography of his hand with her fingertips. His expression was indecipherable and she knew she risked losing herself in his dark eyes. His hand anchoring her to the bed, he didn’t resist when she took his wrist and guided his hand further up her body. Inch by inch, her soft skin being touched in a way it hadn’t been for too long. She tried not to think about how she had never really known a touch which was patient and gentle from someone who -</p><p>She swallowed and bit her lip but didn’t stop.</p><p>Years of throwing up, crying, kicking, and still he healed her with kindness in his touch. Her plan for what she was doing started when her fingers touched his wrist. She didn’t know what his reaction would be. She just knew she wanted to keep his hand on her for a little longer. And still not a word between them or a suggestion of stopping. Gazes fixed on each other. Bringing his hand up to her breast, her breathing finally faltered when he brushed his thumb across her nipple. He turned and pulled away the moment she let go of him and she rushed to grab him, to pull him closer again, only to lose her grip and gasp in pain. </p><p>“Be careful,” he said, quietly. </p><p>“Help me up,” she said, reaching out with aching arms.</p><p>His arm around her waist, he helped her up as she moved to sit beside him. Against each other, holding each other, making no moves to find distance.</p><p>“Snape, I - ”</p><p>“Severus.” The side of his mouth pulled up with the hint of a smile.</p><p>“Severus.” She searched his face as she tried to adjust to the feel of his name on her lips. “Severus.”</p><p>“Tonks - ”</p><p>“I - I'm Nymphadora.” She winced, then said in a rush, “Please don’t call me Nymphadora.” </p><p>His low laugh was intoxicating and she laughed with him. A thrill tearing through her, she leaned closer and caught his amusements with her lips. A moment’s hesitation and he responded in kind. Her hands grasping his robes, she pulled herself closer still. His free hand tangled in her hair and he deepened the kiss. They broke apart when she began to wince from pain.</p><p>“You’re still healing,” he murmured, his lips by her ear, and she moaned for a reason that was distinctly not about pain.</p><p>“You want to,” she braved, when he didn’t stop her hand drifting down his body.</p><p>“I will see you tomorrow.” Turning away, he got up, found his things, and left the room without a backward glance. </p><p>She watched him leave, her hands in her lap, and no words eager to leap from her lips. He was efficient in his departure and once the door was closed behind him, she crawled back under the blankets. Curling up, she watched the doorway until sleep took her. </p><p>When Remus checked on Tonks, he gave her each vial and rubbed her back when she downed the potions, tucking her up in bed again when she was done. Too tired to talk, when he stroked her cheek, she kissed his hand.</p><p>When Snape returned the next day, Tonks was curled up under the blankets again. She measured time in pain. Pain which undulated as potions took effect and wore off. Pain which eased with glacial speed now a little more Dark Magic had been wrought from her body. Drifting in and out of daydreams, she replayed the fight which landed her back in bed, and knew she wouldn’t have made different decisions a second time round.</p><p>The closest either of them came to acknowledging what occurred the previous day was when Tonks’s hand lingered a moment too long on Snape when she reached out to steady herself.</p><p>Before she could consider his words were edging closer to the moment which would cause a surge of pain, she was overwhelmed by a wave of queasiness. He stopped when she grabbed for his hand, her wide-eyed panic and the sudden clamminess all the suggestion he needed to summon the basin which sat on a nearby chair. Leaning against him, she clutched the basin to her body while he stroked her back and she brought up what little was in her stomach.</p><p>“Do you want me to get Remus?” he asked, quietly.</p><p>She shook her head then vomited again.</p><p>“You can go if you want,” she said, a few minutes later, her voice rough. Her head was splitting and the room was close to spinning. She groaned and continued to retch until her body conceded defeat and eased up its rebellion.</p><p>“There’s your healing to continue.” He conjured a glass of water and handed it to her before vanishing the contents of the basin. “It will be worse tomorrow if you delay though I can appreciate why you might desire a break.”</p><p>Tonks sipped at the water and put the basin on the floor, mumbling thanks to Snape when he stopped her toppling to the floor. Resting her head on his shoulder, she made slow progress with the water, ignoring how her stomach ached at the cool intrusion. She handed him the glass then carefully lowered herself back on the bed. He put the glass on the floor and rolled his wand in both hands.</p><p>“I’m ready,” she said, shifting her pyjamas away from her belly and bringing her arms above her head.</p><p>She closed her eyes, heard him sigh, and tried to lose herself in his words. When the moment came, as she knew it would, for the pain to surge through her, she screwed her eyes up as her legs slammed against his arm. A whimper slipped from her lips and she kept her arms over her face, not wanting to see the way he looked at her as his murmured incantations crept closer to the end. When he was done, she lowered her arms. His hand still on her belly, thumb stroking back and forth, he waited for her to meet his gaze before taking his hand from her.</p><p>“Wait a couple of hours before taking the potions.” He stood up and lifted the blankets back over her. “They’ll do little good if you throw them up.”</p><p>“Thank you,” she said, softly, when he was about to open the door.</p><p>He turned back to look at her and his mouth pulled up in a sad smile. “Take all the potions.” Then he was gone. </p><p>Remus knocked on the door a few minutes later and she told him to come in. He crouched down beside the bed and stroked her cheek. </p><p>“I’m fine,” she said. “Another day or two and I’ll be back out there.”</p><p>“That’s what worries me,” said Remus.</p><p>Tonks patted the mattress beside her and Remus kicked off his shoes then climbed into bed. Her head on his chest, he stroked her hair and she gave herself over to the clawing need to sleep, happy to be lulled by the sound of his heartbeat.</p><p>She knew Snape’s visits were coming to an end when the pain was little more than discomfort and a need to breathe deeply. On the last day, she heard the change in his words, knew her body responded differently, ached with relief when the last of the Dark Magic was banished. No matter the curse, the feeling of being free was the same.</p><p>His hand didn’t linger on her. They both knew there was no more damage to assess, no recovery to observe. He rose from the bed and she scrambled up from where she lay, stumbling in her haste to follow him. He caught her and she leant against him.</p><p>“I’m healed,” she said.</p><p>“Barely,” he said, as if begging her to reconsider. He brushed loose strands of hair from her face. She pressed her lips to his and he indulged her for a moment before pulling away. “How strong do you feel?”</p><p>“Strong enough for this,” she said. She pressed her lips to his jaw. “You know they throw me back into the field as soon as you’re done with me.”</p><p>He rested his forehead against hers. “You would suffer less if you had any sense of self-preservation.”</p><p>She stepped back and took his hand in hers. When the bed was against the back of her legs, she stopped, and he came to a halt inches from her. She pulled off her top and threw it on a chair, then pushed her pyjama bottoms down and kicked them aside. She took his hands in hers again and placed them on her waist. The whole time she had been undressing, he hadn’t taken his eyes from her and when she met his dark gaze, she closed her eyes and pressed her lips to his. </p><p>“Patience,” he said, his lips brushing hers.</p><p>“No.”</p><p>She sat on the bed, moving back until she was in the middle. A glance at the door and she stretched to grab her wand. Wards and silencing charms strengthened, she put her wand back. He knelt between her legs and she undid his robes, pushing them aside before her fingers made quick work of his belt. When she freed him from his trousers, she lay back, her hand on his shirt pulling him towards her. Her feet slipped beneath his robes and she wrapped her legs around him, ignoring the heavy fabric which rubbed against her.</p><p>He kissed her collarbone, then her neck, eliciting small moans from her as she ran her fingers through his hair. When he deigned to kiss her again, she was whimpering in anticipation of him, of how he was keeping himself just out of reach until she deepened the kiss and he closed the distance.</p><p>She knew better than to expect him to stay longer than it took him to sort his clothing, though he conceded to letting her hold onto him while she pulled her pyjamas back on. Conceded to her request of one more kiss. Then he was gone and she climbed back into bed. Curling up as tightly as she could, her thoughts strayed back to him. The next day she would be on another mission for the Order. How long until she was injured again? She wanted to see him. She didn’t want Dark Magic to be the reason. </p><p>When Remus knocked on the door and Tonks invited him in, she saw him work to hide his confusion, the slight uncertainty as he took her in. He closed the door behind himself and crossed the room, his gaze drifting around the bed while a soft frown played on his features.</p><p>“I’m back out tomorrow, aren’t I?” she said.</p><p>“Yes.” He sighed. “Yes, and I will be, too.” </p><p>He tried to smile and rubbed his jaw. </p><p>“Get into bed, Remus.”</p><p>He didn’t hesitate and after shuffling around of pillows, blankets, and themselves, they settled down against each other. His hesitation came in the deep breaths which tripped over at each attempt to make words. She knew he was trying to give his usual speech about being careful when she went on her mission. She wriggled so that her head was comfortable on his shoulder. He sighed deeply and moved so that he could get his arms around her properly. He was undeniably alive and she fell asleep unable to shake the feeling that they would both be better off going into hiding and not coming out until the war was over. She knew they would both leave come the morning, knew they wouldn’t let their goodbyes admit to the possibility they might not be coming home again.</p>
