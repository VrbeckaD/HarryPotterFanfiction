    <p align="justify">Newt wasn’t supposed to be here. He was supposed to be on an ocean charter halfway across the Atlantic by now. But yet, somehow he still found himself in New York – well, not <em>somehow</em>. He knew exactly how. Because Tina had asked him, that’s how. Painfully worried and nearly frantic and wholly desperate, she had come to him just as he was about to board the boat; and what should have been a wistful goodbye between newfound friends turned into a sad affair indeed. Just sad in a nature wholly different than what he had been anticipating.</p><p align="justify">
  <em>It was raining, but Tina had an umbrella. So when he noticed that her face was wet, his stomach had lurched with the understanding that something was wrong – and he could tell from her expression that it was not because she would miss him, although she would.</em>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em>“Newt,” she gasped, out of breath from trying to catch him before he boarded. “I need your help.”</em>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em>“Oh- o-of course,” he stammered, blinking rapidly as he tried to keep up with this sudden twist in reality. “What do you need?”</em>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em>“It’s Graves,” she had said, and when she looked up at him, Newt felt his stomach sink even further. “We found him. He’s… he’s not well.”</em>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em>“I imagine not,” Newt had said before he could catch himself, and flinched when he saw the way it hurt Tina. “I apologize… How can I help?”</em>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em>“I don’t know,” she whispered, “but I can’t think of anyone else who can.”</em>
</p><p align="justify">That was how he found himself at the doorstep of one Percival Graves, Director of Magical Security and former prisoner of the dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald. It was a nice building that Graves lived in. His neighbors seemed kind enough, although completely oblivious to the dark happenings that had been occurring in his flat for these many months. Which was sad in its own right, Newt imagined. He shuddered to think of a world in which he could be replaced and no one would notice. His heart stung fiercely when he wondered if his creatures would know the difference. He hoped they would.</p><p align="justify">But he promptly closed the door on that thought before it could overwhelm him. There was a task to be done. What it was, he wasn’t sure… but he would try and help all the same.</p><p align="justify">“It took a lot longer than we would’ve liked to track him down,” Tina said, staring at the door leading to Graves’ flat with a distant, hurt look to her eyes. Guilt, Newt realized. Guilt hung like a heavy blanket over the usual sparkle he had become accustomed to seeing from Tina. Dark and smothering.</p><p align="justify">“Whatever happened… it was not your fault. You know that, right?”</p><p align="justify">Tina took a deep, shaky breath and looked at him with wet eyes. “I know. It’s just… If we had just…”</p><p align="justify">
  <em>If we had just noticed, maybe things would be different.</em>
</p><p align="justify">Whatever had happened, whatever was holding Tina back from opening the door... It was bad. Very bad.</p><p align="justify">“Tina,” he said gently, grabbing her gaze without actually holding it himself. “What happened to Mr. Graves?”</p><p align="justify">Tina swallowed with a dry, audible click before finally reaching for the door knob and twirling her wand with a deft little spell to unlock it. “I think it’s best if you see for yourself.”</p><p align="justify">The moment the door opened, Newt felt it. A thick aura of magic both past and present, hanging thick on the air like a heady gout of smelly perfume. It was thick and dark and pungent in a way that made it hard to think, and even as a man not extremely skilled in the art of magic of the mind, he knew instantly what would cause such a vivid and overwhelming mark. Dark magic. Old magic. Grindelwald.</p><p align="justify">He gagged and raised his sleeve to his nose and mouth to mask himself from some of it. His eyes stung. A quick glance to Tina confirmed that she was not fairing much better. Her hands were trembling.</p><p align="justify">“This way,” she said after a moment.</p><p align="justify">Newt followed her through the quaint flat. It was a nice flat. Sparsely decorated, but richly and deliberately so. It matched Graves, or at least, the image of Graves that Grindelwald had stolen. He followed her down a hallway to a door that had a rather cold looking Auror standing guard before it. He seemed tired down to his very bones, face creased in places no man his age had a right to be creasing in already. Whatever had happened to Mr. Graves, his team was taking it very hardly.</p><p align="justify">“Some did notice,” she said finally, startling Newt.</p><p align="justify">“Excuse me?”</p><p align="justify">“Some of us did notice. A clerk. Two of the senior Aurors. His secretary… Grindelwald manipulated their memories once he found out. Our medical staff found scarring in their minds. Nothing too severe. Just enough to dissuade them from noticing anything else,” she said, stopping. “I know it may not look it, based off your experience from the past few days, but… Director Graves was – <em>is</em> a good man. He was well respected on the team. Now that Grindelwald is gone and the team is back to themselves, well…”</p><p align="justify">“President Picquery should have fucking <em>murdered</em> that demented bastard,” the Auror outside the door suddenly spat, his mouth twisted with hate – all teeth and fury.</p><p align="justify">Tina looked at him with strange eyes and said, “Justice must be upheld. That’s what Director Graves would want.”</p><p align="justify">“Justice ain’t going to fix him.”</p><p align="justify">That drew Newt’s attention. He looked at the door and noticed for the first time the small sigil that had been carved into its wood, old and powerful. A locking charm, long since dead. Newt frowned and pointed at it.</p><p align="justify">“Grindelwald?”</p><p align="justify">The Auror looked over his shoulder and scowled when he noticed what Newt was pointing at.</p><p align="justify">“Yeah,” he said, turning away. “Best as we can tell, he used it before,” he swallowed, “Before he <em>changed</em> him. The Director must’ve been one surly prisoner, it’s a powerful charm.” The little nod he gave at that was a proud one. “Must’ve gave Grindelwald hell.”</p><p align="justify">“I’m sure he did,” Newt said softly, his mind on other things – namely, what he’d find behind the door. A thick, cold dread was beginning to slide down his spine. He had a bad feeling. A familiar feeling. “May I?”</p><p align="justify">The Auror gave him an assessing look, but Tina stepped forward.</p><p align="justify">“I think he can help,” she said. Newt was beginning to think that his presence wasn’t strictly sanctioned. But whatever was wrong must have outweighed that, because the Auror gave him a small nod and moved to open the door for them.</p><p align="justify">“Just… be careful.”</p><p align="justify">Newt blinked, but walked in all the same.</p><p align="justify">The aura was worse here, thick and clingy and greasy like slime. He could feel it on his skin, pressing in on him; overbearing and disgusting and sick. He shuddered.</p><p align="justify">The room, however, was a normal bedroom. It contained nice, plush carpets and bookshelves and a night stand. There were trinkets and a mirror. A painting charmed with subtle movement; wolves stalking beautifully through snowy woods. A closet of immaculate clothing, and finally, a lush four poster bed – and at its end on the floor, a large pillow oddly reminiscent of a dog’s bed beside two upturned gold bowl. A puddle was slowly leaking from beneath it. Water.</p><p align="justify">Newt almost thought the room to be empty and nearly looked at Tina to ask why they were there when a rattle and a soft whine emitted from the closet. There he saw the clothing sway.</p><p align="justify">He took a step forward, but stopped when that whine turned into a rumbling growl. Tina’s fingers brushed his forearm.</p><p align="justify">“He... He’s frightened. Nothing we say helps. He… He <em>bit </em>the last Auror that tried to grab him. I’m sure he doesn’t mean it, he just… He’s confused,” she trailed off, but Newt suddenly understood why Tina had thought of him.</p><p align="justify">“I see,” Newt said, then reached for a confident smile – if only to comfort her. “I understand. Let me see what I can do.”</p><p align="justify">She nodded.</p><p align="justify">“Stay here.”</p><p align="justify">A pause and she nodded again, her eyes drawn to the closet once more. “Ok.”</p><p align="justify">“Ok.”</p><p align="justify">Silently and slowly, he placed his suitcase by the door and turned to address the closet. He took another step closer, his body automatically hunching and folding in on himself in order to appear smaller and less threatening. He held out his hands, but even so, another growl emerged angrily from the closet. </p><p align="justify">A simple warning if Newt had ever heard one. <em>I’m afraid. I’m confused. Back the fuck off.</em></p><p align="justify">“Mr. Graves,” he said softly, soothingly, “We’ve never met but my name is Newt. I’m here to help.”</p><p align="justify">When Newt finally found Graves’ dark eyes within the shadows of the closet, he averted his gaze – instead watching the concealed figure of the man out of his peripherals – and squatted lower to the floor. But he stopped there, giving the man his space. The growling lessened, but didn’t stop. It did, however, intermittently fall into a whimper. Newt’s lips twitched into a frown, concerned.</p><p align="justify">“Mr. Graves? Can you hear me?” He asked as he slowly extended one hand out, giving the man the choice to meet him halfway. As he did, he gently extended out a wordless spell. Soothing and gentle, it emitted slowly from his hand and crept across the room until finally – after a minute of silent waiting – Graves shifted in the closet.</p><p align="justify">Newt saw a glimpse of pale skin and smiled.</p><p align="justify">“There we are,” he praised softly. Behind him, he heard more than saw the way the Auror at the door clearly disliked how he was treating Graves. But Newt was not the only one to catch onto the man’s agitation, and Graves pale face peeked out hesitantly for no more than a second before he caught the man’s body language and huddled back into the closet once more, snarling.</p><p align="justify">Newt sighed.</p><p align="justify">“Tina, could you?” He asked and nodded in the Auror’s direction.</p><p align="justify">“This is ridiculous,” the Auror spat, eyes flicking to Tina even as she made her way toward him.</p><p align="justify">“Nothing else has worked,” she said, clearly cross as she guided him from the room.</p><p align="justify">“You too, Tina,” Newt said, making her stop in the doorway. He clenched down on the guilty feeling that arose when she sent him a hurt look. “He’s afraid. The less people in the room to overwhelm him, the better. Please.”</p><p align="justify">She glanced to the closet, clearly unwilling to leave.</p><p align="justify">“But what if he-?”</p><p align="justify">“I can handle it, Tina,” Newt said gently, giving her a look that said <em>‘do you remember what I have in my suitcase?’</em>. “Just keep an eye on the case for me while I help Mr. Graves calm down, if you don’t mind.”</p><p align="justify">Tina took a deep breath, but finally nodded, grabbed the case, and moved to close the door.</p><p align="justify">“Don’t,” Newt said, catching her off guard. “He’ll just feel trapped. Leave it open.”</p><p align="justify">And so she did, and disappeared down the hallway with his case.</p><p align="justify">“Better?” He asked the closet.</p><p align="justify">And those curious eyes were back, watching him. Growling, but softly.</p><p align="justify">“I’m sorry if they scared you,” Newt said. “They’re just worried. They’ve missed you.”</p><p align="justify">A whine.</p><p align="justify">“It’s alright,” he said and began to extend his spell again, gently trying to soothe the man. “I won’t hurt you.”</p><p align="justify">The clothing shifted and out peeked a familiar face – clean shaven, surprisingly. A messy yet silky fringe of hair trembling in front of dark, simple eyes. Graves looked from Newt to the door and back again, as if assessing an escape. He looked younger than the man Newt had fought in the subway tunnels mere days ago. He wondered if it was the eyes.</p><p align="justify">“Where?” Graves asked, startling Newt.</p><p align="justify">“We’re in your flat,” he said.</p><p align="justify">Graves shook his head and furrowed his brow, searching for the words.</p><p align="justify">“Master didn’t come home. Where?”</p><p align="justify">Newt felt his stomach <em>twist</em>. He opened his mouth, but didn’t really know what to say. He was suddenly fiercely glad Tina had left the room.</p><p align="justify">“You mean Grindelwald?”</p><p align="justify">Graves narrowed his eyes, but said nothing. Did he not recognize the name?</p><p align="justify">Words of comfort and affirmation bubbled to his tongue – <em>He’s caught, we have him. Don’t worry. He’s at MACUSA, he’ll never hurt you again. </em></p><p align="justify">But one look and Newt realized that the context of Graves’ question was not <em>please say he’s not here. </em>It was <em>please say he’s coming home soon.</em></p><p align="justify">“He’s… away,” Newt said lamely, eyes flickering to glance at Graves now that the man felt confident enough to speak with him. Graves was leaning far enough forward now that his shoulders were visible, pale and naked. Newt felt his cheeks begin to burn at the implication, and even more so when he caught sight of the thick leather collar that hung snuggly around Graves’ throat – Grindelwald’s symbol hanging delicately next to a small gold tag that read simply: ‘<em>Pretty’.</em></p><p align="justify">Newt grimaced, but quickly shoved the negative body language down.</p><p align="justify">“Away,” Graves said, eyes distant as he looked at the door. His face crumbled slowly and he began to back himself into the closet again.</p><p align="justify">“No,” Newt said a little too quickly, making Graves flinch. He instantly smoothed out his voice into a calm, hushed tone and said, “It’s okay. Grindel—your master asked for me to watch over you while he’s gone. Would you like that?”</p><p align="justify">Graves narrowed his eyes, but clearly didn’t know what to do with that information. He whined, at war with himself about something, before finally looking at Newt with large brown eyes. So strange on a face that had sentenced him to execution mere days ago.</p><p align="justify">“You’ll touch?”</p><p align="justify"><em>Touch? </em>Newt tried to link the implication to whatever Graves was really asking for, but shuddered at the thought of… certain avenues.</p><p align="justify">“I… I can,” he said, reaching his hand out again. “If you come out.”</p><p align="justify">When Graves finally came out, it was on all fours – his hands curled up like paws as he hesitantly crawled out of the closet, revealing more and more of his lithe and <em>very naked</em> form. He was hairless, although Newt couldn’t tell if that was from magic or grooming. His skin was milk white from lack of sunlight, and it contrasted so prettily against the raven’s black of his hair. With a twist of disgust for having thought it himself, Newt suddenly understood why the tag on his neck read ‘Pretty’. Regardless, Newt remained completely still, one hand extended, while Graves approached him like a wary dog.</p><p align="justify">When the man actually reached out to <em>sniff</em> his fingers, Newt felt the gravity of what Grindelwald had done fall down on him. A feeling he did not think could be outdone until a spark of shock exploded into life inside his chest at the sight of two large, wolfish ears suddenly perking up from where they had been laying flat against Graves’ head. Black as they were, Newt had not even noticed them, nor did he think the other Aurors had. But there they were, perked and curious atop Graves’ head and most certainly <em>not </em>adorable.</p><p align="justify">But the unnatural ears atop his head were not the only things Newt noticed. Graves was in fact flushed in the cheeks, eyes glassy – feverish. Now that he was so close, Newt could practically feel the heat burning off the man like a furnace.</p><p align="justify">Graves stopped just a hair’s breadth from Newt’s hand and looked up at him.</p><p align="justify">“You’ll touch?” He asked again.</p><p align="justify">“Do you want me to?” Newt asked.</p><p align="justify">“Yes,” Graves said with a whine, but did not move.</p><p align="justify">And so, Newt slowly reached out – eyes wary of Graves’ body language until finally his was cradling the man’s jaw. He blew out a breath he hadn’t realized he had been holding with Graves suddenly pressed into his palm and keened, his arse slightly swaying in what Newt realized would have been a wagging tail, were the man the dog that Grindelwald had made him believe himself to be.</p><p align="justify"><em>Oh Tina,</em> he thought, <em>I’m so sorry.</em></p><p align="justify">The tears made sense, now. Asking Newt of all people for help made sense now.</p><p align="justify">He was pulled from his thoughts when he noticed that those large, brown eyes – once closed from bliss – were staring at him hopefully. Graves took one step forward, then another and whined.</p><p align="justify">“Oh!” Newt said, catching on and promptly, but slowly, eased himself into a cross-legged position. No sooner than he did he found himself with a tentative lap-full of eager Graves. Newt was torn between the normal ecstatic feeling he always got from charming a scared creature into trusting him and a sick wrench of dread as he slowly began to understand exactly what Grindelwald had done.</p><p align="justify">Now that he had hands on the man, he could feel the fever burning beneath his skin. It worried him, but even as Newt touched him, he could feel it slowly begin to cool. Something he took note of. He wasn’t sure how long he sat like that, with Graves curled into his lap, but it was long enough that he didn’t notice they weren’t alone anymore until Graves suddenly stiffened and began to growl.</p><p align="justify">Newt looked up to see Tina in the doorway, eyes wide.</p><p align="justify">And what a sight they must make, Newt realized.</p><p align="justify">“Y-you,” Tina stuttered, then visibly composed herself with a dry swallow. “You coaxed him out.”</p><p align="justify">Newt nodded before gently stroking Graves again, compelling magic into the motion to soothe him; warmth and safety and a little bit of compulsion to help him begin to doze. He watched as Graves’ eyelids began to grow heavy, dark lashes fluttering.</p><p align="justify">“This is Tina,” Newt said, voice thick as he realized his next words would hurt Tina all the more. “She’s also a friend of your Master’s.”</p><p align="justify">Tina jerked, but didn't correct him.</p><p align="justify">Graves looked at her, his growling long since ceased, but there was no light of recognition within his sleepy gaze.</p><p align="justify">“Tina,” he repeated.</p><p align="justify">“Y-yes, Director,” she said, hopeful at the sound of her own name from his lips. “Do you remember me?”</p><p align="justify">Graves frowned and looked to Newt.</p><p align="justify">“It’s okay,” he said.</p><p align="justify">Graves shook his head, then sought out Newt’s hand once more. Newt kept his gaze pointedly on Graves, unwilling to watch Tina’s face fall.</p><p align="justify">“That’s okay,” she said. Newt flinched. It was not okay. “Newt, is there… is there anything I can do to help?”</p><p align="justify">“Perhaps bring my case?”</p><p align="justify">Tina promptly turned to retrieve it, no doubt left in the other room. Newt had a moment of anger flare at the thought that Tina might have left it unsupervised, if only for a second, but reminded himself of the situation Tina was in. He couldn’t hold a momentary lapse like this against her. Not when he had her very well respected boss curled naked in his lap and falling asleep.</p><p align="justify">“Oh Mr. Graves,” Newt sighed, his hands deep into Graves’ hair as he pet the man in his lap. “What did he do to you?”</p><p align="justify">Graves merely burrowed deeper into Newt’s lap and asked, “Who is Mr. Graves?”</p>
