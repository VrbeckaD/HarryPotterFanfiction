    <p>“So, would you like me to do it?”</p><p> </p><p>Severus Snape looked up from his desk, turning his head to where you sat across from him. Your face was teased with a smile, your eyes darting across an article in the Daily Prophet that you were obviously only pretending to be remotely interested in.</p><p> </p><p>Severus raised an eyebrow. What was he missing. Had he zoned out again? “Do … it?”</p><p> </p><p>“Your epic biography, of course,” You elaborated, folding the newspaper in your lap and facing him. “Because of course there <em> will </em> be one, Sev. Whether we survive this or not, and I was hoping I’d be the one to tell your story.”</p><p> </p><p>“And why on Earth would you want to do that?”</p><p> </p><p>“Because you’re remarkable, Sev,” You replied, standing. You made your way over to him, and gave him a soft bop on the nose, and his expression changed to something of indignation and guarded affection. “And plus, if you don’t leave it to <em> me</em>, by default you’ll be leaving the responsibility of your biography to <em> Rita Skeeter</em>, and I really don’t think —”</p><p> </p><p>“Fine,” he said, and you knew him well enough to know that he was fighting a small smile. “If those are indeed my options, I will go with you.”</p><p> </p><p>“Just think about it,” You went on, resting your head on his shoulder. “The heroic tale of Severus Snape, the courageous, sly double agent battling the odds stacked against him, all while being <em>devilishly</em> handsome.”</p><p> </p><p>“Courageous … devilishly handsome,” Severus repeated, clearly mulling over the words in his head with a slight smirk. “That’s nice … but who would possibly believe your depiction of me? Certainly not those who knew me.”</p><p> </p><p>“They’ll have to deal with me,” You said with finality, snuggling into him tighter.</p><p> </p><p>Severus seemed satisfied with that answer, and he grasped your hand. You purred into his neck, feeling the strands of his onyx hair brush against your nose when —</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t do it.”</p><p> </p><p>“What?” You said, lifting your head.</p><p> </p><p>You could see his expression now; solemn, his eyes looking off into a distance.</p><p> </p><p>“<em>Lie</em>,” Severus clarified. “If you are serious about this, don’t lie. Paint me as I <em>am</em>, (Y/n). It is the only way.”</p><p> </p><p>And long after you had had that conversation with him, you still didn’t pretend to know why he had told you to be authentic. After you stood over his grave, planting it with flowers, cleaning off the dust and debris, for you were his only visitor these days, you knew what you had do to.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Of course, Sev. As you were. I promise. </em>
