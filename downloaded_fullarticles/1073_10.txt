    <p dir="ltr">He was frozen in time, his mind still active while he was trapped in the secret chamber below the imposter’s coffin. </p><p dir="ltr">The imposter who stole away his legend of goodwill, intelligence, and renaissance within the Egyptian lands. </p><p dir="ltr">The imposter was the one who had cursed him in the walls of his grave, his unplottable grave. </p><p dir="ltr">It seemed fitting the first hundred or more years knowing that the imposter had suffered from the worst of all deaths. However, with his death the last promise of being encountered was lost as the land of the dead sealed them both away for good. </p><p dir="ltr">He could only hope that the Medjai had received his message before he had been captured. Hope, that they knew that with the awakening of the false Imhotep there would be a chance for them to be all saved when he was awoken as well. However, he knew that fate could be cruel.</p><p dir="ltr">After all the only one who could unlock his curse was his soulmate, who he’d been told wouldn’t arrive for more than a hundred centuries.</p><p dir="ltr">------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p dir="ltr">The revolution had ended with a treaty between the muggle-born and purebloods. The Ministry had fallen long ago, and the Riddles’ reign had long since come about, however, several stragglers who did not like change had formed groups which sought to rebel against each other. </p><p dir="ltr">One such a rebel group had been the ones to destroy her family while the so-called “Light” side’s leader sought to manipulate her into his own secret weapon. Perhaps if she hadn’t connected with Hermione when they were young she would have been swayed. Perhaps if she had not imprinted on Hermione, she would have stayed abused and controlled. However, that was not what had happened and once they reached school and joined with their third sister Akasuki they became an unstoppable force that took over Hogwarts by storm. They were nicknamed the Silver Trio after their house colors of navy and silver.</p><p dir="ltr">It was upon one of their many early studies that Hermione discovered the letters of one high-priest Imhotep to his love and soulmate, his queen. They had started to be written strangely enough in the early 20th century when the Magical Realm of Egypt was being rebuilt. </p><p dir="ltr">They were all written to: “<em>My Queen…</em>” </p><p dir="ltr">The girls had fawned over the intelligent writings of the legendary genius as he spoke to the soulmate that he knew would come from the future. </p><p dir="ltr">It was Hermione who first suggested that Imhotep was Hera’s soulmate. No matter how much Miss Potter tried to deny it she felt drawn to the words on the page and sometimes when she couldn’t sleep, due to bad memories from the Dursleys, she thought she could hear a deep voice calming her and humming her to sleep. </p><p dir="ltr">Luna who the girls met their second year always seemed to know of everything before it happened. The day after the re-opening of Hogwarts she bequeathed a message and a gift to each of the Silver Trio.</p><p dir="ltr">The next morning the Daily Prophet would read: “<b>The Silver Trio has disappeared without a trace!</b>”</p>
