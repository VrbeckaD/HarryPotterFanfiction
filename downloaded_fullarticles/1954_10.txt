  <span>The weather in Southaires was normally fair that time of year. Relatively temperate, though on the cool side. Occasional rains. Rarely was there snow, or frost, or wind, or sleet. This year, however, a cold front had hit the coast, and the few year-round residents prepared for a grumpier off-season than usual. They weren’t, generally, a grumpy people, and often enjoyed the winters free of tourists and holidaymakers, when the streets were wet and quiet, and the shops down the high street stood solitary and steadfast. The roofs weren’t equipped to handle a blizzard, and half the houses stood empty in November. Some of the residents wondered who would clear them if there was heavy snowfall; the answer, in each of their minds, seemed to be </span>
  <em>
    <span>“not me.” </span>

  <span>It was odd, but not unheard of, for tourists to come in the late fall. Not families, usually, but lone visitors—writers, maybe, strange little men who hole up in their rented bungalows all day and only make appearances in town to eat alone at the cafes and counters there. The barren beaches were ideal for one inclined to that sort of melancholy mood. This year, however, the windchill on the beach was below freezing, due to the fact that the town lay directly on the coast of the sea, rather than being nestled in a cove or bay. The waters from the north were brutal. The low-lying areas near the small river flooded. The farmland became inundated, and then promptly froze over. The residents became grumpier and grumpier. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>No, this year was not a pleasant off-season for the year-round residents. But those touristing hermits, whoever they were—it seemed not to be totally unpleasant for them. </span>
