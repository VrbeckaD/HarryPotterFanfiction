  <em>March 16, 1986</em>
</p><p>Harry's wrist had been broken by his cousin Dudley one hour ago. Dudley, Petunia, and Vernon left Harry at home to go to the amusement park.<br/>He knew it wouldn't be treated and that his cousin wouldn't be punished.  </p><p>Outside on the doorstep of 4 Privet Drive, there were three people dressed differently. There was an elderly man whose beard was almost silver who was dressed in a dark red color. A man who had greasy long black hair who was dressed in black. And an elderly woman dressed in dark green.<br/>The man who was dressed in black ringed the doorbell.</p><p>But, when Harry heard the doorbell ring, he didn't answer. His aunt always said to him: "If someone rings the doorbell or knocks on the door, do not answer the door as it could be someone decent." Even if he wasn't told that he couldn't open the door because whenever he was left home by himself, his uncle would always lock him in the cupboard.</p><p>"<em>Oh boy. I'm probably going to be punished for being a freak again. Uncle Vernon probably sent someone to punish me.</em>" Harry thought to himself.</p><p>The three adults then came is the living room.</p><p>"Harry?" The man with the silver beard said.</p><p>None of the adults heard a response.</p><p>The three adults then started to look for Harry.</p><p>When the man that was wearing black heard breathing from the cupboard that he passed by, he went back to the cupboard and saw a lock. He got out his wand, pointed it at the key socket and said "Alhomora." The lock then started to turn left and then unlocked. He then opened the door and saw Harry in the cupboard. "Albus, Minerva. I found the boy."</p><p>Harry was even more nervous because there were three people in the house.</p><p>"<em>Oh boy three people to punish me for being a freak.</em>" Harry thought to himself.</p><p>"Come with me," The man that was wearing black said.</p><p>Harry was nervous about what was going to happen but knew if he didn't come when called, the punishment would be even worse. </p><p>So, Harry followed the man that was wearing black to the living room.</p><p>The man with the silver beard walked up to Harry and said: "You probably don't remember do you?"</p><p>"No sir," Harry said.</p><p>"I didn't expect you to." The man with the silver beard said. "I haven't seen you since you were a baby."</p><p>The man with the silver beard then held out his hand and when Harry held out his hand to shake his hand, the man with the silver beard said: "My name is Albus Dumbledore. This lady is Minerva McGonagall and this gentleman is Severus Snape. I am the headmaster of a special school, while these two are teachers at the special school which you will attend at age eleven."</p><p>"H-Hello," Harry said.</p><p>Severus then walked up to Harry and said: "Would you like for me to heal the broken wrist?"</p><p>"Y-Yes sir," Harry said.</p><p>Severus then got out his wand and mended the broken wrist.</p><p>"Now, with your permission, would you like for me to erase your memory of this event? And when you come to the special school, I will show you the memory." Dumbledore said.</p><p>"Y-Yes sir," Harry said.</p><p>Dumbledore then got out his wand and said: "Oblivate,"</p><p>"I wish he could live somewhere else. But he can sadly because of that law." Severus said.</p><p>"I hate it too Severus," Dumbledore said.</p><p>The three adults then left the house and then left Privet Drive.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>
