    <p>-Monday<br/>
Harry tugged at the bag that ached into his shoulders, his schoolbooks weighing down his back and forcing him to walk at a very slow pace. He didn’t quite mind, although he was nearly late for his fourth and final class of the day, History of Magic. This class bored him the most, after all what kind of student would want to learn about some old witches and wizards when they could learn how to turn someone’s hair purple, or make their ears grow three times their size? It was obvious that even in his third year at Hogwarts, Harry was still fascinated by magic.</p><p>	As he walked across the open area to pass the fountain, Harry thought he heard a shuffle come from behind the arch he’d just passed (he was sure he was alone). His shoulders tensed and he turned his head slightly to look out of the corner of his eye, but nobody was there. He settled for placing his bag down on the edge of the fountain and pretended to look for something. Silently ruffling through his books, he heard nothing. Perhaps it was just his imagination; but he swore it was clear as the sky. He picked up his bag and turned to leave before he heard it; a small, hesitant voice that sounded like it belonged to a small child. Sure enough, a young first-year was clutching onto the arch, his hair neat and slick. “Harry Potter,” he said again, in a clearer voice. Harry decided this must be a “fan” and gave him a quick smile and a wave before turning to leave once more. “Wait,” the voice called out again, this time more urgent. This would take a bit longer than Harry would have liked (he couldn’t be late again or he’d get a week of detention and miss Quidditch practice).</p><p>	“Yes, what is it?” Harry said. He noted the loose tie that bore the Hufflepuff colors hanging around the young boy’s neck. Harry tapped his foot impatiently as the boy searched for words in the sky.</p><p>	“Well, I have a petition I’d like you to sign.” This got Harry’s attention. There were not many petitions at Hogwarts anymore, besides the one last trimester protesting the ban on the Weasley twins selling their homemade products. Of course he had signed that; those things had gotten him out of many homework assignments and a talk with Neville about how his wand seemed to not like him very much (which was ridiculous; any sensible witch or wizard knew that).</p><p>	“Well, what’s it for?”</p><p>	“Well, my friends and I all agree that the music in this school is a bit limited. I am very gifted on the guitar, and some of my friends are quite well at it, too. We’d like lessons here at the school, but we can’t go to the headmaster without enough people rooting for us.” Harry thought this was a fair decision, and why wouldn’t he sign it? He was about to say exactly that when the boy spoke again. “But we also promised that anyone who signs the petition would enroll in the class.” Now this was a problem. Harry had no interest whatsoever in music. Plus, he was very clumsy and had limited attention span. Learning to play an instrument would be a very hard task for Harry. The large bell chimed in the distance, noting that Harry was definitely late for class this time. The young boy didn’t seem to care at all.</p><p>	“Ah, I’ll think about it. What’s your name?”</p><p>	“Leo Parks,” the boy smiled, and Harry waved before sprinting up the concrete stairs to class.</p><p> </p><p>	After walking in late and earning a very stern glare from his professor and a promise for detention, Harry plopped down next to Ron and began taking out his book, along with some parchment. He sloppily wrote down a question before slipping it to Ron, who read it under the table.</p><p>	‘What kind of instrument do you think I would play if I decided to?’</p><p>	‘Not sure.. Why?’ Ron replied.</p><p>	‘Some first year wants me to sign a petition for music lessons at Hogwarts. But if I sign it, I have to enroll in the class.’</p><p>	‘So don’t sign it. Unless you want to learn how to play an instrument.’</p><p>	‘Not exactly.’ Harry wrote back. ‘But there’s no reason not to. Plus, it wouldn’t matter if I failed the class, right? I do fine in all my other classes and the music lessons would just be an extracurricular.’</p><p>	‘Unless they’re not. Tell you what; if you sign it, I’ll sign it. We’ll learn the same instrument and just have a free period during that class or whatever.’ Ron finished the note with a large smiley face so Harry couldn’t write anything else and gave him a small grin. It was then that Hermione turned around and gave them a glare, probably hearing Ron fold the paper. She held out her hand expectantly and Harry and Ron shared a look before giving it up. There wasn’t really anything to hide after all, right? Hermione read for a few moments before turning back around and sliding the paper under Harry’s book, a happy look on her face.</p><p>	‘I’ll sign it as well. I’ve been dying to learn how to play the flute.’ Two small X’s accompanied Hermione’s neat handwriting under Ron’s large smiley face. Oh well, at least they weren’t in trouble for not paying attention.</p><p> </p><p>	Later that evening, while the trio sat at Gryffindor table and ate their dinners, Leo Parks walked up to Harry with an expected look and some parchment perched onto a book.”Well?” he asked. Harry had forgotten all about it after HoM, but decided he would sign the petition anyway. He abandoned his homework and began writing his name, before another caught his eye. ‘Draco Malfoy’ was written in thin and cursive handwriting. Harry sneered at the name, but wrote anyway. Hopefully enough people signed that there would be multiple periods, and Harry wouldn’t be stuck with the Slytherin. Ron and Hermione signed as well, appearing to not notice Malfoy’s name. Leo stood very excitedly, nearly bouncing on his feet as they all signed.</p><p>	“I can’t believe we basically just signed up to learn how to play musical instruments,” Ron said. “It’s kind of ridiculous. I mean, I can expect it from Hermione; but you and I, Harry?” Harry shrugged, and Hermione elbowed Ron slightly, before peering over his paper.</p><p>	“Uh, Ron? That answer’s wrong, you have to cut the dragon scales into halves, not crush them into powder. Otherwise, you’d technically be making.. A bomb, I suppose.” Hermione looked puzzled at that, and began writing something down while Ron scratched out his answer in exasperation. Harry watched as Leo began walking around Gryffindor table, asking for signatures. He noted that Neville Longbottom wrote his name down, as well as Dean and Seamus, but when Lavender Brown was asked, she turned her nose up at him (she explained she had better things to do with her time, like flirt with boys and make up her own spells to make lasting makeup).</p><p>	“Anyway, if Leo does end up getting music lessons at Hogwarts, Ron and I have to figure out what we want to play.” Ron looked up at Harry with a puzzled look.</p><p>	“Uh, Harry.. Leo isn’t going to get those lessons. Headmaster Dumbledore may allow a lot, but he wouldn’t just add classes on because some first-year wanted them.” Hermione and Harry shared a doubtful look, but decided Ron must be right. There was no way Dumbledore would do such a thing.</p><p> </p><p>-Tuesday<br/>
A week later, everyone in the Gryffindor common room surrounded a single piece of parchment hung up above the fireplace. In large bold letters bore the words “Music Lessons.” If that weren’t obvious enough, there were names written down underneath with a single paragraph of explanation.</p><p>	“‘Thanks to Leonardo Parks, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry are proud to announce new music lessons being offered. The students below have promised to sign up for these lessons and will do so for an entire year. Otherwise, these lessons will secede for everyone involved.’ And there’s Dumbledore’s name signed at the bottom.” Ron groaned and sat back in the love chair he was resting on. Hermione began counting the names for Gryffindor house.</p><p>	“Only seven of us signed up. I’ll go get the forms from McGonagall. Everyone, decide what instruments you’ll be playing,” she ordered. As she left the room, there was silence.</p><p>	“We’re all screwed,” Ron said in a low voice.</p><p>	“Actually, I think it’s quite exciting,” said Dean. “I’d love to learn to play, and Seamus and I,” he patted Seamus on the back, “are going to be learning the same instruments so we can practice together.”</p><p>	“If that’s what you want to call it,” someone said. Dean quickly removed his arm from Seamus’ shoulder, blushing and laughing uncomfortably.</p><p>	“Anyway,” Harry said, changing the subject. “I think I’ll be playing the violin. I’ve always favored the strings, and it’s easy to carry, so why not?” A few people nodded in agreement, and Harry turned to his best friend. “Well?”</p><p>	“Well, what?”</p><p>	“Well, you said you’d learn the same instrument as me. Have fun on the violin,” he said with a grin. Ron was not pleased by the idea; he was sure these lessons wouldn’t happen.</p><p>	“Why did I sign it?” Harry laughed, and found himself looking at the list again. Draco Malfoy’s name was a few lines above Harry’s; he found himself wondering what Malfoy would choose to play. “Well,” Ron announced. “I’m going to bed before Hermione comes back with those forms.” And at that, he stood up and walked out of the room. More people began filing out and Harry decided he would go to bed as well. It’s been an unusual week, he thought.</p><p>He went to bed that night imagining himself on a stage. He had a violin in hand, and many faceless people were there. The only people he recognized where Ron, Hermione, and Malfoy. His friends smiled encouragingly at him, but Malfoy only stared straight at Harry. Every time he played, no noise would come out. He saw Malfoy smirk before the rest of his night was spent dreamless.</p>
