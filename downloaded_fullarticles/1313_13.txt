    <p>"What are you doing out here, Snivellus?"</p>
<p>The smaller boy flinched at the voice behind him, knowing exactly who that smirky, rich timbre belonged to.  Trying not to give away the speed of his heart and the fight or flight instinct that was warring inside of him, he turned around slowly to face Sirius Black.</p>
<p>"I could ask you the same question." He said calmly and quietly, leaning his back against the tree he had been peering around, his eyes narrowing as they rested on Sirius' face.</p>
<p>"None of your business." Sirius said with a frown.</p>
<p>"Then same.  None of your business."  Snape smiled, a particularly poisonous smile as he could see even in the clear bright moonlight that Sirius, though full of bravado, was uncomfortable.</p>
<p>"Fine."  The larger boy, spoke the one word, turning and walking along the edge of the Forbidden Forest, trying to appear nonchalant as he went, looking into the trees every few moments.</p>
<p>"Lose something?" Snape asked casually, moving along behind Sirius, keeping a few paces behind him.</p>
<p>"No.  Bugger off, Snape."  Sirius shot a nasty look over his shoulder at the smaller boy, walking faster along the edge of the trees.</p>
<p>Snape paused in his steps for a moment, then quirked one side of his mouth up in a faint smile.  "Since when do you actually call me Snape?"</p>
<p>"Since you're bothering me and I want you to go away?"  Sirius was getting a little antsy then, stepping past the treeline and into the forest itself.</p>
<p>"What are you doing!?"  Snape closed the distance between them, grabbing for Sirius' arm and trying to pull him back.  "Are you completely mad?"  He hissed the words, grappling with Sirius' arm with both of his hands, pulling hard to try and drag the other boy back to the open.</p>
<p>"Bugger OFF, Snape! What do you think, that the moment you step FOOT past the trees some internal alarm goes off to everything inside of it?"  He shook at the grip the other boy had on him, trying to free his arm.</p>
<p>"That is, actually, EXACTLY what I think, and EXACTLY what happens."  Snape, yanked harder but one hard wrench freed Sirius' arm from his grip.  "You must be mental."</p>
<p>"No YOU must be mental." Sirius said, straightening the cloak he had on, moving further into the trees.  "It's just a forest."</p>
<p>Snape scoffed, hanging back as Sirius moved in further, half of him wanting to run back to the open where it was safer but the other half not wanting Sirius to go off alone in the woods when he was clearly so underprepared.</p>
<p>He could still see him, the full moon shone bright even in the dense trees, turning everything silvery and unreal.  The Forbidden Forest was deadly at the best of times, but everything got even worse during the full moon.</p>
<p>"Sirius, wait!' He called, fighting his inner voice that screamed at him that it was Sirius' business if he wanted to go get himself killed.  He jogged through the trees to catch up with him.  "Please go back.  Whatever you're doing can't be that important."</p>
<p>"You have no idea." Sirius said, looking down to Snape's face, huffing a breath of air that fluttered his long bangs out of his eyes before he looked away and kept walking.</p>
<p>Snape continued walking with him silently for a few moments, peering around as best he could in the surreal silvery black woods.  "Is it Remus?" He asked, trying to keep his voice casual, but that alone was enough to alert the other boy who stopped dead in his tracks and wheeled around to glare at him. </p>
<p>"What do you mean, is it Remus?" He spat the words out angrily, his eyes practically boring holes into Snape's skull with the intensity of his gaze.</p>
<p>"It's a full moon." Snape said, then cowered in reflex as Sirius took two large steps abruptly and closed the space between them.  He held his arms up to shield any potential blows that came from the larger boy.  "Don't!  I'm not telling anyone about it!"</p>
<p>"How do you KNOW?" Sirius asked, his voice far more calm than Snape expected, almost more curious and not really accusatory.</p>
<p>"I'm not stupid, I figured it out."  Snape lowered one arm to look up at Sirius, then the other, then he stood up again instead of cowering against the forest floor.  "I was looking for him too.  I wanted to catch him before the transformation."</p>
<p>Sirius loomed up again, his shoulders squared as he looked accusingly at Snape.  "Why?  So you could catch him at it and tell the whole school?  Get him kicked out?"</p>
<p>"No!  No..." Snape waved his hands a bit, then reached into his cloak, pulling out a large stoppered vial.  He held it out, wishing that his hands weren't slightly trembling at the intensity of the other boy.  "I made him this.  It's supposed to make it easier...  So he can think straight when he..."</p>
<p>Snape trailed off as Sirius plucked the vial from his palm and looked at it carefully.  "This is Wolfsbane Potion."  He said, his brow furrowing as he tipped the vial back and forth to look at the liquid inside.  "Right?  I've only seen drawings of it and written descriptions in the books we've read."</p>
<p>"Yes."  Snape nodded, watching Sirius carefully.  "I was reading one of the advanced potions books and it was in there.  Handwritten on the page and it just said it was to keep a human mind in the wolf."</p>
<p>"He'd have to take it for the full week before the full moon for it to work right." Sirius said, still holding the potion but looking at Snape with interest.  "You made this?"</p>
<p>Snape nodded again, feeling a little crestfallen that what he'd made wouldn't have been of any use anyways.  "It didn't say anything about him having to take it in advance."</p>
<p>"But you MADE this.  You did.  For him?"  Sirius raised both eyebrows, something in him softening slightly.  </p>
<p>"Well.  Yes.  I can't imagine it's fun what he goes through.  He looks dreadful after the full moon and he has so many scars already." </p>
<p> He rubbed one hand against his opposite arm, looking down at the forest floor.  Which made him completely unprepared to be seized by Sirius in a strong hug, enough to squeeze the air out of him and make his head spin.</p>
<p>"None of us could do it.  None of us.  And Remus wouldn't ever ever ever agree to drink anything so complicated that we made for him anyways.  But YOU can make it."  Sirius squeezed the smaller boy tighter, then released him, looking slight apologetic as Snape coughed and wheezed once released.  "Sorry.."</p>
<p>Snape waved a hand in dismissal to the apology, straightening up after a moment and pushing his hair out of his eyes.  "It's fine, you just surprised me."</p>
<p>"Would you make it again?  We could get you the ingredients, I know it's not easy to come by the stuff you'd need and in the amount you'd probably need it."</p>
<p>Again Snape waved his hand a bit.  "I can make it again and I have... sources for ingredients.  No one would think twice about me having them.  If you ever got caught with it all..."</p>
<p>Sirius couldn't help but smirk a bit, looking at the vial in his hands.  "One of the perks of Slytherin maybe."</p>
<p>"Partially.  Mostly just because I spend the better part of my free time in the potions classroom anyways.  Trying new things...  Professor Slughorn doesn't think twice about it anymore.  He thinks I make things and throw them away, that's what a good student would do anyways."</p>
<p>Sirius smiled a little more, tilting his head as he looked at Snape, really looked at him for a few moments.  "But you don't?"</p>
<p>"Not when it's something good or really useful.  Why waste it?"  Snape couldn't help but smile then, seeing the look on Sirius' face turn into an incredulous grin.  "What??"</p>
<p>"You're just kind of surprising, that's all."  Sirius lifted one shoulder in a small shrug as he looked down at the smaller boy.  "You seem like a total boot licker."</p>
<p>"You get away with more if on the surface you seem like a dutiful well behaved student." Snape said, shrugging one shoulder as well.  "You behave like a model pupil, no one thinks they have to watch you, you get away with whatever you want."</p>
<p>"Like making totally not for students potions." Sirius said, holding the vial out to Snape again.</p>
<p>"That's a start." Snape replied, then shook his head, pushing Sirius' hand back towards him.  "Keep it.  It's a start for next month."</p>
<p>Sirius smiled a bit, nodding as he put the potion into his pocket.  "Thanks..."</p>
<p>Snape shrugged again, twisting a bit from side to side, making his cloak swish around his legs.  "We really shouldn't be in the forest...  I know you don't believe me but stepping past the trees really does make a difference."</p>
<p>"But Remus is in here." Sirius said, pausing for a moment then sighing softly.  "Although I suppose at this time he does belong here."</p>
<p>"He does...  The forest will look after him, he belongs to it right now." Snape said, reaching out and tugging lightly on Sirius' arm.  "It's kind of an agreement with the things that live here.  Nothing living here can come through the trees, the forest is theirs.  But anyone who steps into it is fair game.  Please.."</p>
<p>Sirius moved then, much to Snape's relief.  They trudged back through the trees and he didn't notice until they were out in the open, in the much brighter moonlight that his hand was still on Sirius' arm.   He looked at it, then up to Sirius' face, then away again, his cheeks going red as he slid his hand back down again.</p>
<p>"Happy now?" Sirius asked, a slight teasing tone coming back into his voice, unable to help himself when he saw how embarrassed the smaller boy was just from keeping a hand on his arm for awhile.</p>
<p>Snape nodded, biting his lip without saying anything.  "Just stay out of the trees.  I don't care if you go back to the castle or not but don't go into the trees.  Remus can handle himself in there.  You know he can."</p>
<p>Sirius nodded to Snape, and the smaller boy could feel the weight of his eyes on him even as he didn't meet his gaze.  He turned without saying anything else to walk back towards the castle.</p>
<p>"Hey, Severus!'  </p>
<p>Snape startled slightly at the use of his actual name, turning to look at Sirius again in surprise.  "....Yes?"</p>
<p>"Thanks.  For looking out for Remus.  And for looking out for me."</p>
<p>Snape smiled a bit, raising one hand in a slight wave, then turned again to keep walking.</p>
