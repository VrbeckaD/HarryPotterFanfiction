    <p>May 1924.</p><p>Newt Scamander had been working for the American Government as a consultant for six weeks when the real Percival Graves was finally discovered. He’d been badly beaten and left near starving, and a bite wound on his shin suggested he had been attacked by a werewolf at some point. It was terribly infected since it had not been treated properly, but the Healers at St. Sebastian’s Hospital for Magical Afflictions were certain they could handle it without much trouble.</p><p>Newt, however, was more concerned about the changes undoubtedly coming about in Mr. Graves’ body at present. If he <em>had </em>been bitten by a werewolf, he would likely change soon and depending on the biology of the werewolf in question, he might even present with certain characteristics. It was rare these days that a <em>pure </em>werewolf would attack, thus creating the alpha/beta/omega dynamics in their individual sire. <em>It was all terribly fascinating</em>, Newt thought, and he was eager to explore the science behind it more thoroughly. It was difficult to predict which side would present itself in any given wolf sire. Given Mr. Graves’ current position, and from what Newt had seen of his figure when Grindelwald had been posing as him, Newt suspected he would likely be an alpha. Alpha’s were more commonly broad and powerful, but omegas, though often considered less powerful based on sheer body size, had the unique ability to wield the alpha as a weapon against their enemies. Not to mention the fact that almost every alpha would be made harmless at the hands of their omega. Newt <em>needed </em>to study him more closely.</p><p>“Absolutely not, out of the question,” Madam Picquery said. “You have no idea what he could do to you.”,</p><p>“With all due respect Madam Picquery,” Newt said in that usual quiet demeanor of his. “I dealt with Grindelwald wearing Mr. Graves’ form for quite a while. Not to mention, I deal with magical creatures for a living. I’m well aware of the dangers associated with werewolves, I have bottled omega pheromones to ensure he won’t attack me if I need them, and I know how to handle myself around creatures far more dangerous than Mr. Graves,” he was bluffing about the pheromones bit, but he hardly needed them, he was hardly a novice at dealing with magical creatures after all.</p><p>Madam Picquery sighed, she knew better than to try and fight Newt when it came to anything he had set his mind too. He was, very much like Percival in that way. She may have been the President of MACUSA, but Newt worked in a world all his own, and she knew there would be no convincing him. “Very well,” she said. “But on your own head be it. If you get hurt, MACUSA will not be held responsible.”</p><p>Newt nodded, barely concealing a smile, “Understood,” he replied. He knew Seraphina would be devastated if something happened to him, though she would never admit it. She found him “delightfully infuriating”, a description he had overheard himself when the President had thought Newt wasn’t able to hear her. Newt didn’t mind however, he was more than happy to be considered as much.</p><p>He made his way towards the lift, and out the front doors, hoping to apparate out of MACUSA before Madam Picquery could change her mind.</p><p>St. Sebastian’s Hospital for Magical Afflictions was located right in the heart of uptown Manhattan, Newt appeared at the reception desk on the first floor with a crack. The medi-witch barely looked up from the papers on her desk at Newt’s arrival. “Can I help you?” she said.</p><p>“I’d like to see Mr. Percival Graves please,” Newt replied. The woman opened her mouth, a protest already on her lips about family, and he quickly added. “I’m with MACUSA.”</p><p>The medi-witch looked nervous at that, “I will go find his doctor right away Mr…” she trailed off.</p><p>“Scamander,” he said, the witch nodded, hurrying off as fast as she could. Given the opportunity, Newt didn’t care for using his influence to get his way, especially not as he had, but he had no time for formalities. Percival Graves did not (as far as Newt was aware) <em>have </em>any other family, and the likelihood anyone outside of MACUSA would visit him struck him as rather low. Newt <em>needed </em>to see him, sooner rather than later. Madam Picquery may have allowed Newt to see him, but it was only a matter of time before the rest of MACUSA decided that Mr. Graves was far too dangerous for his own good. He knew too much, and with the added danger of his newfound power, he could be a deadly asset for someone like Grindelwald. </p><p>Newt had seen first hand how willing MACUSA had been to jump to killing himself and his friends, even if it <em>had </em>been under Grindelwald’s orders, no one involved had stopped once to consider <em>not </em>doing it.</p><p>The medi-witch reappeared several moments later, with a healer beside her.</p><p>“Hello, I’m Healer Matthews,” said a kindly looking redheaded woman. Newt smiled kindly at her.</p><p>“I’d like to see Mr. Graves if I might,” he said.</p><p>“I’m afraid that’s quite impossible, he’s not up to seeing visitors at the moment,” Healer Matthews said.</p><p>Newt frowned at that, taking a step closer so that only she could hear him as he spoke. “Healer Matthews, I’m afraid it is rather urgent that I see Mr. Graves. As I’m sure you are aware, he was attacked by a werewolf while in captivity by Grindelwald and I’m concerned that MACUSA might come in and try to exterminate him.”</p><p>“I thought you said you were with MACUSA?” Healer Matthews said, with a puzzled look.</p><p>“Yes well, technically I’m a free agent. I’m a magizoologist,” he held out his hand to the woman. “Newt Scamander. I’m currently in America working with MACUSA on a temporary basis― but politically I have no stake in their operations. More, I’m concerned with magical creatures you see.”</p><p>“You’re English?” she said.</p><p>“Yes…”</p><p>“Scamander, isn’t your brother…”</p><p>“Theseus, the great war hero, yes.”</p><p>“I was going to say he works for the Ministry of Magic, right?”</p><p>“Yes but I don’t see…”</p><p>“So what’s to stop you from trying to take my patient to England to have the Ministry deal with him?” Healer Matthews asked.</p><p>“Again, politically I don’t really align myself with either MACUSA or the Ministry. I’m concerned with magical creatures,” Newt explained.</p><p>“Well Mr. Scamander it may have missed your notice, but werewolf bite or not, Mr. Graves is not a magical creature and therefore, very much not your jurisdiction.”</p><p>“I’ve been trying to study humanoid magical creatures, werewolves, veela, for years, trying to get an idea on how they differ from traditional magical creatures.”</p><p>“Well he’s human first and foremost I can tell you that.”</p><p>“We have a full moon in a few days, do you expect he’ll turn?” Newt asked.</p><p>“That’s not really any of your business.”</p><p>“Please,” Newt sighed. “May I be frank with you Healer Matthews?”</p><p>The healer sighed, folding her arms across her chest, but gestured for him to continue. “Over my time here in the States, I first met the man I thought was Percival Graves and I found myself well… surprisingly attracted to him.” The healer raised an eyebrow at this. Newt had been surprised he was saying all of this out loud himself. But the moment the words left his lips he realized how true they were. It wasn’t about the werewolf inside of Percival Graves. It was the man himself, that Newt was fascinated by. “Of course he tried to have me killed, and that sort of put a damper on that, but… I just need to see if… any of that was real. I mean he won’t remember me of course, but…” Newt trailed off. The realization that Percival wouldn’t remember him made him inexplicably sad. He had never <em>met </em>the real Percival Graves, but something about him had struck Newt in a way he couldn’t possibly hope to explain. </p><p>Healer Matthews looked moved by Newt’s words. “You said your name was Newt?” she said.</p><p>“Yes,” he replied.</p><p>“Mr. Graves’ has been calling out your name for a few weeks now,” she said.</p><p>Newt’s eyes widened. “I… how would he even know my name?”</p><p>“Beats me. We’ve done a few brain scans, tried to extract some memories… my guess is Grindelwald must have shared some of his memories with Mr. Graves in order to torture him or something.</p><p>“Well now I absolutely <em>must </em>see him,” Newt said.</p><p>Healer Matthews gave him a look, “Mr. Scamander, as much as I appreciate your concern, I’m afraid it just isn’t possible. Mr. Graves isn’t well enough to have visitors.”</p><p>Newt frowned. “When?”</p><p>Healer Matthews pursed her lips, “I don’t know.”</p><p>“If he turns come the full moon, and he doesn’t have someone to help him you’re going to be in trouble, and MACUSA will take him out.”</p><p>“Mr. Scamander I assure you, St. Sebastian’s is more than capable of handling a werewolf.”</p><p>“Are you?” Newt asked, challengingly.</p><p>Healer Matthews sighed, and leaned in towards Newt, “Come back on Saturday,” she said quietly.</p><p>Newt nodded, “Thank you,” he said quietly, and with that, he turned on his heel and left St. Sabastian’s.</p>
