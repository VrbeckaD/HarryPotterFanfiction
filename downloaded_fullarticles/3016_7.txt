    <p>Her sixth year of magical education began fairly uneventfully for Hermione. Now that Umbridge had been sacked and Dumbledore had returned to the castle, life at Hogwarts felt much more like it had always done, and after her harrowing experience at the Ministry of Magic the previous year, she was happy to once again be able to throw herself into her schoolwork - to be able to forget the dangers that loomed outside of the castle. Despite her relief at life returning to normal, however, she could not shake the feeling that something was missing. She tried to ignore it, to push the feeling away, spending more and more of her free time focusing on her school work, but the feeling persisted. In every quiet moment, every lull in inactivity - during meals, laying it bed at night, even during trips to the bathroom. Any time her mind was unoccupied, an unwelcome emptiness seemed to fill her. It had begun affecting her sleep as well. Countless nights she had spent laying awake, staring at the ceiling of her fourposter bed, waiting, hoping, praying for sleep to finally take her. It had gotten bad enough that by now, in mid October, she had resorted to taking a sleeping draft before bed each night. It was the only way she was able to rest. She felt flat, empty.</p><p>And now, she realized as she stared out the window of Gryffindor tower at the dark and rainy grounds, even her school work was beginning to lose its interest. She had decided, in a fit of bitter resentment, to try to sleep without the sleeping draft. After an hour of laying awake, she had jumped out of bed and stormed silently down to the common room, figuring that, if she couldn't sleep, she could at least get some work done. She stared down at the parchment in front of her, on which she had managed to write only a meager three lines. <em>The principals of complex transfiguration with regards to living beings are as follows... </em>She wrote out a couple more perfunctory sentences before throwing down her quill, crumpling the parchment into a little ball and tossing it into the fire. She watched with slight satisfaction as the sides of the parchment curled up and began to burn. Pushing herself away from the table, she stood, and headed in the direction of the portrait hole. She knew she would get in trouble if she was caught out of her common room this late, but she needed to do <em>something. Anything. </em></p><p>Reckless frustration coursing through her body, she lit her wand, and began to walk, unsure of her destination, but compelled to <em>move, to escape this new and unfamiliar </em><em>emptiness</em>. It was nearly ten minutes of walking briskly through the dimly lit corridors before she felt her breathing begin to level out, and a slight sense of calm began to return to her. She slowed her pace and looked around. She was on the sixth floor, directly, she thought, below the Room of Requirement. She briefly considered going up to the room in hopes that it could provide something that would help her, but before she could take a step, she heard the sound of voices coming from a room on her right. Heart suddenly beating out of her chest, she pressed herself against the wall and inched slowly closer to the entrance, which she now realized belonged to a bathroom. But who would be in such a relatively remote bathroom at this time of night? Filch perhaps? Or Peeves? She inched further still and cautiously peered around the corner into the bathroom. It was dark, but she could just barely make out at the back of the room, a pair of feet poking out from one of the open stalls. <br/> <br/> "...help you relax, is all. I can tell you're under so much stress. Won't you let me help you?" came a cooing, hopeful sounding voice. It sounded distinctly familiar to Hermione, but she could not immediately place it.</p><p>"But, you can't touch me. How do you intend to help?" came another familiar voice, and this time Hermione recognized it at once. It was Draco Malfoy.<br/> <br/> "I can watch you, talk to you. Wouldn't you like an audience?" said the first voice, and Hermione realized, with a small gasp, which she did her best to stifle, that the voice belonged to none other than Moaning Myrtle. What on Earth was going on in there?</p><p>"Fine. But don't you dare think of trying to touch me. You'll freeze my balls off." came Draco's voice.<br/> <br/> "Promise." said Myrtle, excitedly. <br/> <br/> Then she heard the sound of rustling cloth and Myrtle let out an excited giggle, which was so unlike her, that Hermione's curiosity overrode her caution. She quietly cast a disillusionment charm over herself and slowly began to creep into the bathroom, trying to get a glimpse of Malfoy.<br/> <br/> "It's so big. I've never really seen one before, not like this." said Myrtle.</p><p>Heart pounding in her chest, Hermione edged further into the room, back pressed against the opposite wall, and soon came level with Malfoy's stall. He was sat on the toilet, leaning back, a legs splayed, and robes open, revealing his hard, and, Hermione reluctantly admitted to herself, rather impressive cock. He was stroking it slowly as Moaning Myrtle watched from below, her torso poking halfway out of the floor. A deep, crimson flush crept over Hermione's face as she watched this, and her heart began to beat even faster. She could feel her blood pumping, and the flush upon her face was soon mirrored between her legs. Unable to help herself as she watched Malfoy stroke his cock, she shoved her hand down her robes and began to rub her pussy. It was wet, wetter than it had been in ages, and the physical stimulation felt incredible. Something about the wrongness of the situation - of Malfoy's rock hard cock as he jerked himself off, with Myrtle staring with glee, and Hermione secretly, feet away, playing herself right in front of them, while they had no idea - was deeply arousing to Hermione. Satisfying her desire for reckless abandonment, she began to sink into a haze of pleasure and excitement, all conscious thought seeming to ebb away. And now she began to feel the excitement rise. She curled her toes and tried not to make a sound as she approached the edge, but the pleasure was too much, and to her horror, as the orgasm took her, she could not help but let out a soft moan of pleasure. Her vision blurred and she was briefly divorced entirely from reality, as intense waves of pleasure rocked her body. But through her orgasmic fever, she was able to register two things. First, was the immediate stiffening of Malfoy's form as he heard the noise. And second, was that Moaning Myrtle had let out a quiet shriek, and vanished into the floor below.</p><p>"Whose there?" Malfoy hissed sharply, wrenching his robes back around himself.</p><p>Hermione stood as still as she could, silently cursing her own stupidity. <em>What the hell had she been thinking? Why had she even come into the bathroom in the first place? Why hadn't she simply gone back to her Gryffindor Tower? </em></p><p>Getting to his feet, Malfoy lit his wand, and began to scan the room. Hermione glanced down, and realized a moment too late that there was a puddle of liquid pooling at her feet. Malfoy's spell hit her in the chest and she let out a cry of surprise as she was wrenched into the air by her leg. Her robes fell down over her face and she felt her wand clatter to the floor. </p><p>"A disillusionment spell, is it?" growled Malfoy, "Let's see who decided to come and spy on me. <em>Finite Incantatem!</em>"</p><p>Hermione felt the disillusionment spell fade and she hurriedly tried to cover her face with her robes, but it was too late. Malfoy had seen her face.<br/> <br/> With a tone of utter disbelief, Malfoy said, "Granger? What the- What are you doing out of bed at this hour?"<br/> <br/> "Nothing! It's none of your business, Malfoy. Let me down this instant!"<br/> <br/> "I don't think so, Granger. Did Potter put you up to this? Sent you to spy on me, has he? How did you know I was here, though?"<br/> <br/> "I don't know what you're talking about, Malfoy. Now let me down!"<br/> <br/> "No. I don't think I will." he took a step towards her. "Seems you let Potter down, though, eh? A bit distracted, it seems. I must say I never pegged you as being such a little whore, Granger." he gestured to the puddle of cum beneath her. <br/> <br/> Indignant rage exploded in Hermione and she snatched up her wand from where it had fallen on the floor. Before she could cast the curse she had planned for Malfoy, however, a second spell struck her in the chest. She felt her wand fly out of her hand and over to Malfoy, who caught it. Speechless with fury, Hermione could not find the words to express what she thought of Malfoy in that moment, so she simply glared.<br/> <br/> "None of that, now, Granger. It was you who was spying on me, after all. I think you're the one who needs to be punished." </p><p>He was now mere inches away from her, and to her utter horror and outrage, he reached out and rubbed a finger along her exposed panties, still wet with cum. Even though her rage and humiliation, however, Hermione felt a thrill of excitement as he touched her. Slowly he slid her panties up, and over her legs. Hermione felt her face burning once again, a strange excitement welling up inside her. Next, Malfoy threw open her robes, and unhooked her bra, dropping it to the floor. He stood back to admire her, and then pulled his still hard cock out of his own robes. In spite of herself, Hermione could not help the excitement she felt. She knew she should <em>not</em> be enjoying this, should <em>not</em> want this, but she could not deny that there was a part of her that did, part of her that felt more alive than she had done in ages. <br/> <br/> "I- I am <em>head girl</em>, Malfoy!" she hissed with outrage, trying to ignore how turned on she was, "When I tell-"<br/> <br/> "You're not going to tell anyone, Granger. Not unless you want to get detention yourself. Don't forget you're out of bounds as well. Besides, I think you're quite enjoying this. Don't pretend you don't want it."<br/> <br/> "I-I.." began Hermione, breathlessly, but her train of thought was interrupted as Malfoy slid a finger inside her scarlet pussy. She whimpered, fighting back a moan. It felt amazing, having his finger inside her, far better than anything she had tried before. He slowly began to rub, his other hand reaching down to caress her tits. A second finger joined the first and now Hermione moaned in earnest, unable to keep up any pretenses of displeasure. <br/> <br/> "I thought so." sneered Malfoy. <br/> <br/> The fog of pleasure was returning, clouding Hermione's thoughts with heady images, blurring her sense of caution, eroding her inhibitions. As the pleasure mounted, Malfoy's erect cock hung tauntingly in front of her, inches away from her face, so close, she could smell it. The masculine scent was intoxicating, alluring, almost begging her to reach out and take it. She tried to resist, to ground herself in some sensible part of her being, but in that moment, with her mind so full of heat and desire, there was no room for reason. Her resolve finally failing, she reached out and grabbed Malfoy's cock, pulling him closer and taking it into her open mouth. She felt him stiffen as she did so, felt his rock hard member twitch in her mouth, and then she felt Malfoy's tongue upon her, stroking her, and she felt his lips close around her cunt, sucking, licking, stimulating her clit in ways she had never experiences before. She returned the favor, sucking his cock with renewed fervor, and after a moment, she felt him jerk, his cock stiffening, and hot, salty cum filling her mouth. It was too much for her, and she felt herself briefly detach from reality once more as waves of molten pleasure washed over her. As she returned to herself, she felt her own cum streaming down her stomach from her swollen pussy, just as Malfoy's was dripping from her open mouth. </p><p>Breathing hard, she glanced up at Malfoy, who had stepped back, and was now doing up his robes once more.<br/> <br/> "Well. See you around, Granger." he said, somewhat hoarsely.</p><p>He lifted the spell keeping her in the air and she collapsed in a heap on the floor in the puddle of her cum. Malfoy swept from the room, tossing her wand in her direction as he left. For a time, Hermione simply lay there, her mind a whirl of conflicting thoughts and feelings. She could not believe what had just happened. She had sucked Malfoy's cock. He had eaten her out, had cum in her mouth, in the middle of the night, in a public bathroom. At this point, as she slowly rose to her feet, cleaned herself up, and began to sneak back to Gryffindor tower, she had no idea what to think. Malfoy had been right about one thing, however, she would not be telling anyone what had happened. And when she finally arrived back to her common room, and sunk into bed, she found, much to her surprise, that sleep came easily that night, and she woke the next morning, feeling unusually well rested. </p><p> </p>
