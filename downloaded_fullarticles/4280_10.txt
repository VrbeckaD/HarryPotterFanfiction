    <p>WATER</p>
<p>(An excerpt from the journals of Rishala Pwate'er)</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Still, Quiet, Calm.</p>
<p>Burbling, Wandering, Whispering.</p>
<p>Roaring, Crashing, Breaking.</p>
<p>All these and more are the properties of Water.</p>
<p>It sings as it ripples over rocks in the river,</p>
<p>Growling as it pounds the shore in a storm.</p>
<p>Calm, yet Chaotic.</p>
<p>Beautiful, yet Terrible.</p>
<p>Whether glistening in a calm lake,</p>
<p>Or churning in a turbulent sea,</p>
<p>Water represents that which is in all of us.</p>
<p>Anger and Love,</p>
<p>Passion and Tenderness,</p>
<p>Stubborn, Patient.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It can take years to change the landscape,</p>
<p>Can destroy a city in a matter of minutes.</p>
<p>Whether the deafening roar as it pours over a cliff,</p>
<p>Or a soothing pattering under a light summer's rain,</p>
<p>Whether the unbridled destruction of the water, disturbed into a tsunami,</p>
<p>Or the gentle caresses of a healing soak in the silence,</p>
<p>Water is one of the most versatile of the elements,</p>
<p>Full of the power for destruction, also the well-spring for all life.</p>
