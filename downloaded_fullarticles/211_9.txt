    <p>
  <span>Three sharp knocks sounded at the front door. Minerva McGonagall had been turning off the living room lights before heading to bed; she wasn’t expecting visitors.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She drew her wand; who could possibly be on her doorstep on a night like this? </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The rain lashed down outside, thunder clapped… it was a tension-breaking storm after another hot summer.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Minerva made her way over slowly, but her visitor did not knock again.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The older witch carefully pulled the door open, but there was no one out there.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She checked the surroundings, and there was only a piece of parchment lodged in the door’s letterbox.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Minerva snatched it up and shut her door quickly, locking it behind her. She unravelled it and took in the damp, hastily scrawled message.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>‘Meet me in the The Armed Crow tonight at 11pm. I am desperate for your help.’</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She turned the parchment over but there was nothing else, no sender, no hint of who had left this for her.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Despite the Muggle-ish delivery, she knew this mysterious person was a witch or wizard; The Armed Crow was Minerva’s most local wizarding pub, in the next town over.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She looked up at the clock hanging on her living room wall, it was already 10.30pm. Minerva replaced her wand in her sleeve and moved into her bedroom. She dug through her bedside drawers and found a small drawstring purse she kept for emergencies, for moments just like this.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It contained several small phials, some of explosives to distract enemies in battle, others to help her regain stamina if she needed. Minerva was nothing if not prepared should this be some sort of ambush.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>A blonde woman around Minerva’s age stepped out of the en-suite bathroom. “What are you doing?” She asked, seeing the Professor taking off her nightie and changing back into robes. “Where are you going?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’ve received a message,” she explained. “I’m to be at the Armed Crow by eleven.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“A message from who?” her wife asked.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Minerva gave her a slightly worried look. “I don’t know. It said they needed my help,” she fastened a waterproof cloak over her shoulders. The blonde looked ready to argue. “I know, I know it could be a trap,” she said, “But it might not be. The handwriting, it looked familiar. I can’t place who.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The other woman followed Minerva to the front door, and took hold of her hand as she opened it. “Be careful.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I will.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Come home to me.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Always,” she promised. She gave her wife a loving kiss and stepped out into the night, disapparating.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Just a fraction of a second later, she landed in the apparition point in the nearby wizarding town of Edgeville.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Minerva started to make her way through the dimly lit streets, towards the only building with any sign of life. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It was a Friday night, after all, and it was no surprise the pub would be busy. Perhaps that was what her mysterious summoner was counting on - so much activity that they wouldn’t be noticed.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She stepped inside, immediately appreciating the warmth of the establishment.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Minerva headed to the bar and ordered a double firewhiskey. She looked around as she was being served, scanning for familiar faces - Dumbledore!</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Her friend and boss was sitting in a quiet corner, nursing a large Butterbeer.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Once she’d paid for her drink she took a sip and made her way over. “Albus,” she said, sitting down next to him. “Did you leave that note?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He frowned at her. “I was quite ready to ask you the same, Minerva. It appears we’ve </span>
  <em>
    <span>both</span>
  </em>
  <span> been summoned.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Minerva kept looking around the quaint little pub, keeping an eye out for whoever their stranger would be.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Ygraine didn’t want me to come.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Understandable,” the Headmaster nodded. “A mysterious summons in the dead of night, your wife must be worried sick.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I shan’t think she’ll sleep tonight until I’m home.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Just then a small, cloaked figure slunk into the bar. In their efforts to appear so nonchalant, it only drew the Professors'’ attention to them more.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“This must be them,” Albus muttered, averting his gaze and taking a sip of his drink. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Minerva followed suit. “I fear I should have gone for something weaker.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The Headmaster laughed slightly.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The cloaked person made their way to the bar where they ordered a glass of water. They then made their way over to the professors, a cloaking charm shielding the top half of their face underneath their hood.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Headmaster… Professor,” came a small, feminine voice. “Thank you for coming, I would be eternally grateful for your assistance.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Minerva knew that voice, from many years ago.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Albus, it seemed, didn’t.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What do you want, Mrs Lestrange?” Minerva asked bluntly. Albus looked at her in surprise, then back at their summoner.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She took a seat, and waved her wand in front of her face to remove the cloaking charm - but she didn’t look like the Bellatrix Lestrange they had come to know in recent years.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Of course, her skin was pale and face thin from Azkaban, but there was something in her eyes that seemed completely different.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I seek asylum, to put it bluntly.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Minerva scoffed. “Asylum? From whom?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“The Dark Lord,” she whispered.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The Professor let out a sharp laugh. “Likely story.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Dumbledore held out a hand toward Minerva. “We must hear her, Minerva.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Bellatrix nodded at her old Headmaster in thanks. From inside her cloak, she pulled out a small vial of clear liquid and pulled out the stopper. She held it out toward Albus, and Minerva’s hand went straight to her wand. “Veritaserum, Professor. To ensure my honesty.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Albus took a small sniff, then nodded toward Minerva, prompting her to do the same. They both agreed the potion was as it seemed, and Bellatrix threw it back before launching at once into her tale of woe.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“During my time in Azkaban, the Dementors bore away at my mind. I had been suffering from a… a mind fog, if you will, since graduating Hogwarts, the same day I was made to marry.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Albus nodded, urging her to continue.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“They ground away at this fog, allowing me to see the truth of my life. It disgusts me,” she said bluntly. “After the Dark Lord freed us from Azkaban, I naturally went first to the Lestrange Manor. I hadn’t bathed for, what, twelve? Fourteen years? My priority was cleanliness. There, I of course found my husband, Rodolphus.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Minerva was listening intently, but didn’t look as though she believed a word coming out of the Dark Witch’s mouth - despite the truth-telling potion she’d consumed.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“He drew his wand on me as soon as he saw me, and I heard him mutter </span>
  <em>
    <span>imperio</span>
  </em>
  <span>. And there it was again, the mind fog, the strange, airy, mad feeling I had become so accustomed to so many years ago. I knew then that this was what had happened, that he had cursed me since our wedding day to do his and the Dark Lord’s bidding.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Minerva raised an eyebrow in slight disbelief. "I'm sure," she muttered. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Bellatrix looked over at her. "I'm sorry, professor, if you find my plight to be insincere. Would you perhaps have preferred if I'd asked one of you to bring your own veritaserum?" </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>McGonagall pursed her lips for a moment. "I believe the potion was legitimate. But I also believe that you are a witch of exceptional skill. It would not surprise me if you could have concocted a potion that merely appears to be veritaserum."</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Dumbledore shook his head slightly. "Minerva, if need be, we will provide her with another potion and we can do this all over again. For now, however, we will simply listen and help in whatever way we can."</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Bellatrix looked at him, grateful as always for his wisdom. "Thank you again, Professor."</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She took a sip of her water and continued on. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"I fought harder than I'd ever fought anything, I pushed back against his magic as much as was possible. His wand sparked and he dropped it. My mind fog cleared once again." She hesitated. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"I'm here to turn myself over to the side of the good," she said softly, staring at the damp coaster under her glass. "I know things about the Dark Lord you could only dream of knowing, Professors. I know things that can bring him to an end. Please do not ask me to state them here, it is incredibly sensitive information."</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Dumbledore nodded slowly, but McGonagall had noticed a small hole in the story. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"What happened to Rodolphus?" she asked, then took another swig of her drink. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Bellatrix hesitated, opening and closing her mouth a couple of times. The potion made her want to answer straight away, but her mind did not want her to confess. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Bellatrix," Minerva said quietly. "What happened?" </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The dark witch took a breath. "I killed him," she admitted. "I took out the years of anger I had kept inside me, the rage Azkaban instilled in me. I didn't even use my magic in him. I killed him with my bare hands for the years of control he inflicted on me."</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Now she glanced up, looking briefly into each of their eyes from under her hood. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"While I seek the side of good, I seek no forgiveness for this, as I have no regrets for his death." </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Minerva, who had first hand experience of being controlled by someone else, finally relented. She moved her hand from her glass and held it open palmed towards Bellatrix.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"I believe you," she muttered. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Bellatrix hesitantly took her hand, pursing her lips in a small smile. Minerva watched her eyes, seeing the effects of the potion starting to slip away. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"What did you do with his body?” She asked.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Bellatrix, after so many years of committing murder and torturing people, couldn’t help the slight smile. “It’s still there. He rots in our bedroom, on our bed. He’s been there for nearly a whole pregnancy,” she said hollowly, staring off into space, past the two teachers.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“And where, exactly, does the Dark Lord think he is?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Bellatrix snapped back to reality. The Veritaserum had worn off now, her emotions were now able to come through in her (still honest) replies. “The Dark Lord knows of his demise. He came to check on the house, as he’d sent Rodolphus there to meet me, to control me again,” she said bitterly. “I was watching. I’ve been staying in a decrepit muggle house nearby - the Lestrange mansion is still my home. I’ve been waiting for the opportunity to move back in, but the Dark Lord returns regularly. I expect he’s waiting for me, he knows how much I loved that house.”  </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Albus and Minerva regarded her for a few moments, then shared a look. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Dumbledore was the first to speak. “It’s clear to me, Bellatrix, that while you truly wish to join the light side, I fear you retain your bloodlust. You’ve been corrupted by the Dark so deeply…” Bellatrix looked down at the table, almost in shame.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I feel it would be unwise for you to remain unsupervised. There’s nowhere better for you to be than at Hogwarts.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Both Bellatrix and Minerva looked up at him in surprise. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Tonight,” he continued, “You will return with me to the school while I make preparations for the new school year. Do you have everything with you that you need?” He asked, and she nodded enthusiastically. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Professor, I can’t thank you enough, I’m so grateful.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He lifted his glass of Butterbeer and threw the rest of it back, then stood. “We’ll apparate together, but I’ll require your wand.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Minerva and Bellatrix both stood as the dark witch pulled her wand from her sleeve and handed it to the old man.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Minerva, I’ll see you in a few days for the start of term. Give Ygraine my best.”</span>
</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>
  <span>On the other side of the country, an altogether different meeting was taking place - Harry, Ron and Hermione were sitting in Ron’s room, Hermione carefully turning a floating piece of the Daily Prophet with her wand, watching with curiosity as it burned.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You look like you’re doing that with your mind, Hermione,” Harry joked, prodding her. She jumped, waking from her deep focus. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Sorry,” she muttered. “Got a bit lost in my thoughts there.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What you thinkin’ about?” Ron asked.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She pursed her lips in thought for a moment. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I had this dream, last week. Only, it didn’t feel like a dream, it felt like I was watching something real, and I was involved in the scene, only I was someone different.” Harry sat up a little straighter. “There was this guy, an older man, I recognised him. I think he was a death eater. And we were in a bedroom.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Ron raised an eyebrow. “Do we actually want to hear this?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione ignored him. “I walked in, and I felt my blood start to boil with anger. I’d never been so… </span>
  <em>
    <span>irate</span>
  </em>
  <span>. And, I started to draw my wand, only he beat me to it, and he cast the Imperius Curse on me. And I felt this, like, fog descend on me. And something clicked, like I realised I’d been Imperiused all my life. And…” she hesitated, and gulped. “I broke the fog, and I killed him - no, I didn’t kill him,” she let out a breath of a laugh. “I slaughtered him. Without magic. It was </span>
  <em>
    <span>awful</span>
  </em>
  <span>.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry reached out and placed his hand on hers. “It wasn’t really you, Hermione. It was just a dream - or maybe a vision, we can’t be sure - but it wasn’t you. I know you’d never do that.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She nodded. “I know. But… It’s like I can still feel what it felt like in the dream. To kill someone. And this guy, whoever he was, he deserved it. And I didn’t hate it. It feels like I killed someone, Harry, and I don’t hate myself for it.”</span>
