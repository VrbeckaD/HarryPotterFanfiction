    <p>I can still remember my very first day at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Remember when I very first traced the lip of my Hogwarts acceptance letter at the age of eleven. I really tried to be excited, really, but what with my curse plaguing my every move…</p><p>“Elsa, we are so proud of you.”</p><p>My father smiled to me, my mother closely behind wearing a similar expression. As they drew nearer to congratulate me, they thought better of it as I automatically flinched away I bowed my head as I swallowed the lump in my throat, avoiding eye-contact.</p><p>“Thank you, Father. I will miss you both dearly.”</p><p>I said quietly. I peered up for a moment long enough to see their eyes tainted with sorrow at what I’d become – what my curse had made me be. I’d prayed and prayed that at the very least should something happen at the school because of me that Anna would never be there to find out. I’d asked with good grace if my parents would not tell her and that I could leave the kingdom of Arendelle without her knowing until I was gone. I wanted nothing but the best for my crazy, fun-loving sister and sadly, that meant absolutely having nothing to do with me.</p><p>“Please give this to Anna, won’t you?”</p><p>I’d told my father that I’d planned to stay at Hogwarts even during the breaks where the students went home for Christmases and Easter – I even wanted to stay for summer, but that wasn’t going to happen. I handed to him a letter that took me so long to write I thought it’d be a blank page to stare at me forever. He met my eyes sadly and nodded infinitesimally.</p><p>“And remember, Elsa, No matter what house you are placed in, it cannot define who you are. The hat listens and respects your choices.”</p><p>My mother says kindly to me. She should know, the hat wanted to place her in Slytherin for her intelligence and ambition but the hat changed it’s mind with her sheer discomfort that followed, then being placed in Ravenclaw. My Father was placed in Hufflepuff the moment the hat sat on his head, ‘so quickly it was comical,’ for his modesty, fairness and hardworking dedication.</p><p>“Yes, Mother. I love you both, goodbye.”</p><p>I almost choked the last word as the finality of truly being alone in this threatened to consume me in my fears. Another misfortune brought by my curse. As I watched their faces grow small under the moonlight being whisked away by the carriage to the train station at Kings Cross, I allowed myself to ponder upon which house I would be placed. Which house did I want to be placed in?</p><p>“Do you have everything you need, Miss Agnarr?”</p><p>The driver Sven, one of our most trusted employees, asked me over his shoulder.</p><p>“Yes – Ooh wait, I am just missing one item.”</p><p>He was referring to the items required found Diagon Alley. I’d had the Snowy Owl my mother had bought me, my books, my robes (sans house colours of course) – everything bar my wand. He was one of the kindest and by far my favourite servant, and he even came with me to get my wand without question. Oh, I forgot to mention, I’m Elsa Agnarr – the future Queen of Arendelle. Of course I’m not planning on telling anyone at Hogwarts that fact. There’s no need to add that to the list of reasons why I’ll ostracize myself from the crowds – I’d rather subdue mumblings of a pure-blood witch becoming The Queen of a muggle kingdom.</p><p>“Would you like me to walk you to the train, your highness?”</p><p>He crouched to my level whilst we were outside the station the following morning. Whilst I didn’t really want to be alone – my reasoning for pretending he was my father as we stayed at the leaky cauldron last night – I would much rather pretend to be just a witch, not a Princess with a curse.</p><p>“No thank you, Sven. How many times must I tell you to call me Elsa?”</p><p>I said with the smallest of smiles, reserved for few. He returned it warmly, still careful not to touch me. Good.</p><p>“At least once more.”</p><p>I giggled and waved goodbye as I made my way to platform 9 ¾… 9 ¾? Huh… Then and there I’d remembered, running through a wall… that’s how you get there… I gulped as I readied myself to push my trolley of belongings at the wall between platforms 9 and 10.</p><p>“It’s not a race, ya know. You can just <em>walk</em> through.”</p><p>A boy with chestnut hair and steely eyes sneered at me. I flushed with embarrassment and looked away in silence.</p><p>“Lay off Hans, she’s a first year.”</p><p>I looked behind me to see a girl, also the year above I’d assumed, with blonde bangs and a friendly smile despite the obvious cunning edge I imagined she would use against you should she be crossed. Hans rolled his eyes and strolled through the wall. The girl dipped her head to me, demanding my attention. When I’d finally peered up at her she extended a hand,</p><p>“Name’s Astrid. Third year. Just ignore him.”</p><p>I looked at her hand as if it were a venomous snake and remembered my gloved hands… it may be safe, it’s only a moment, right? She noticed my hesitation and was seemingly moments from giving up when I voiced quietly,</p><p>“Elsa. Elsa Agnarr.”</p><p>Whilst limply shaking her hand once and stepping away.</p><p>“Well, Elsa Agnarr, you don’t need to run but it’s a better idea to if you’re a little nervous. I did last year. This is my brother, Kristoff. He’s a first year too.”</p><p>I peered behind her shoulders to see a boy with shaggy blonde hair clumsily making his way over with his trolley. We greeted each other bashfully before Astrid guided us to the platform. We broke into a run and the expected pain of hitting a wall didn’t follow. We were on the platform.</p><p>“I’ll see ya there, lil’ bro. Nice to meet you, Elsa.”</p><p>Astrid waved us off as she found a group of people her age. We stood awkwardly for a few moments until we just silently made our way onto the train, my bag was too heavy to carry with my owl and he’d quietly offered to help me. I was started to think if these silences became comfortable, I’d happily be friends with this strange boy.</p><p>“All the compartments are full…”</p><p>He’d noted as we searched the train. Finally, at the very end was a compartment only occupied by two boys, one with slick chocolate locks and olive skin and the other opposite with hair whiter than mine and somehow, skin paler than mine. I silently thanked Kristoff for speaking up for me,</p><p>“Can we sit here? The compartments are full…”</p><p>“Sure, take a seat, Blondies.”</p><p>The brunette spoke flippantly and whilst his demeanour was casual and witty, I couldn’t help but feel uncomfortable with the remark. Unfortunately, Kristoff was already seated next to the other boy, so I had to sit with snarky.</p><p>“Name’s Flynn, Flynn Rider. My Uncle’s the most famous Chaser in the world, currently upholds that title.”</p><p>Flynn smiled at the white haired boy, who returned it impishly,</p><p>“No way! That’s awesome! I’m Jack Frost, I'm gonna be a seeker someday.”</p><p>And so most of the journey was filled with Quidditch talk between Jack and Flynn, holding little interest for Kristoff and me. I was started to like that Kristoff already, he would be easy to be friends with for me. But then, could I afford to make friends anyway?</p><p>“So what’s your name?”</p><p>Flynn asked me with a casual smirk that still made me uncomfortable. I’d repeated my name for the umpteenth time this morning and he wore a frown that seemed horribly familiar.</p><p>“Agnarr huh? That sounds familiar…”</p><p>No, no. NO! <em>Please</em> don’t recognise me in any way! I thought it was supposed to be an advantage that I was least brought up royalty in a <em>muggle</em> kingdom. But then I was curious as to how this Flynn Rider with a world famous Quidditch player uncle would have any knowledge of this… thankfully he shrugged it off.</p><p>“How ‘bout you?”</p><p>Jack asked Kristoff who’d said his name.</p><p>“Woah, Bjorgman? So your sister is Astrid? The youngest beater of the Slytherin Quidditch team?! Who got in her first year?!”</p><p>He nodded, seemingly exasperated. I couldn’t help but smile at the sheer wonder in this boys eyes that alight when he spoke of Quidditch, his cool blue eyes were surprisingly warm. I was also surprised to learn that Jack <em>wanted</em> to be in Slytherin. He figured what I was thinking with my raised brow and said indignantly,</p><p>“Slytherin could take me to greatness. What’s it to you, anyway?”</p><p>I was mildly taken aback but was snapped out of my thoughts at the sound of the train whistle signalling our arrival. When we’d disembarked we were led to a series of emergent boats upon the black lake outside the perimeter of the grand Castle by a woman named Professor Gothel, who I’d learned was the potions master. I avoided a boat with the two boys I’d met on the train and took a seat opposite Kristoff on another, accompanied by a scrawny freckled boy who quietly said his name to be Hiccup. How unfortunate, I thought. But luckily, our train companions weren’t here or I’m sure he’d have been ripped to shreds. Another person I wouldn’t mind having to spend time with, I thought absently. Astrid was nice, but she wasn’t in my year so I wasn’t sure how I would see her unless I was in Slytherin…</p><p>When we were in the great hall, I immediately noticed the warm eyes and outstretched arms of the headmaster, Professor North, welcoming us first years to Hogwarts. I could feel my anxiety rising as the list of students continued to be sorted in their houses. Why was I so nervous? Conceal, don’t feel, conceal, don’t feel…</p><p>“Elsa Agnarr.”</p><p>I stepped anxiously, but surely to the front, aware of the prying eyes. I sat upon the stool and heard the hat whisper to me strange mumblings as it debated on where to put me.</p><p>“Very clever, I see… shy, but full of greatness - not bad for Slytherin?”</p><p>I shrivelled in my seat.</p><p>“No? Hmm… well I could see a great deal of courage buried within that just needs to be challenged… perhaps Gryiffindor…”</p><p>Courage?! I had to refain from yelping it aloud, terrified I would have to show bravery when my curse holds me back…</p><p>“No…? Better be… RAVENCLAW!”</p><p>The shouts and cheers from the Ravenclaw table were deafening and I couldn’t help but smile. Ravenclaw. Just like my mother. I sat between some other random first years now in my house and listened curiously to the people I’d met today being sorted. So Jack was Slytherin after all… So was Flynn – what a surprise – Why did Kristoff just flinch? Huh, Hufflepuff – yea that probably makes sense, can see that happening. I was pleasantly surprised when Hiccup wasn’t ridiculed as he stood up to be sorted and even more so when he was placed in Ravenclaw with me. He sat beside me which I didn’t mind because he kept his distance thankfully. We’d feasted and feasted until we were all stuffed as turkeys at Christmas and we were led to the Ravenclaw common room. I quickly made my way to the girl’s dormitory, wanting to avoid everyone. Today was good, no one came too close, hopefully haven’t made any enemies and I don’t think I was recognised… Thought I'd noticed Professor North giving me a knowing smile, but if he knew surely he wouldn’t say, would he?</p><p>“Hope you’re all settled in alright, here’s a newsletter of the events coming in the next few years at Hogwarts, for the next years events just tap the back page with your wand…”</p><p>Belle, our head girl, continued and informed us of breakfast times exedra before we went to bed...</p><p>SMASH! My eyes flew open to my window which was now a gaping hole with shards jutting this way and that as the frosty air blew in through the window.</p><p>“Lumos!”</p><p>Belle had cast to her wand as she approached the scene, furiously.</p><p>“Goddamn Slytherins.”</p><p>She spat under her breath as she picked up the rock that was thrown through my window, which was tainted green with a serpent that moved and hissed as if it were alive within the rock.</p><p>“Sorry, Elsa. Would you like me to try and find you somewhere else to sleep?”</p><p>She said tiredly as she wiped the back of her hand across her forehead.</p><p>“It’s ok, - “ I said as I pulled over the heavy, navy curtains, “The cold never bothered me anyway.”</p><p>She smiled curiously and kindly simultaneously and after a short moment of hesitation, agreed and walked away, her anger already being ebbed. I tried to ignore the stares – even glares – coming from the girls in the Ravenclaw dormitory. Great. Did they really think this was my fault?!</p><p>Over the coming weeks I came to know that Hiccup was in herbology with me and we had potions class with Kristoff, who I’d had almost every class with, both him and Jack Frost – the Slytherin boy who apparently can’t help but play pranks and be sarcastic to the point of rudeness to nearly all the students and can apparently get away with it from Professor Black’s prejudices for his house (He was the head of Slytherin) much to our annoyance. He was often collaborating with that Flynn Rider.</p><p>It became apparent to the Ravenclaw’s just how intelligent I am, much to their dismay, as they are seemingly in a constant competition with not only the other houses but with themselves on their intellect. I winced, I really didn’t need another reason to stand out. But what annoyed me the most was when Jack Frost approached me, teasing and pranking on his mind. A sly grin was etched upon his features in Defence against the dark arts,</p><p>“Think you could hit a death eater with a book to kill it, Miss Perfect?”</p><p>Earning him a guffaw from Flynn and even some other boys who I didn’t care to notice. I just ignored him and continued to make my meticulous notes in my book as Professor Black continued to teach anyway.</p><p>“Leave her alone, Frost.”</p><p>Kristoff said from the other side of me, I smiled at him and continued my notes. Jack and Flynn among some others started ‘hooting and whooping’ and I shut my eyes as if that were to block it out.</p><p>“Protective of your girl, huh Kristoff?”</p><p>“I’m no one’s <em>girl</em>, Frost. Now if you'll excuse me.”</p><p>I don’t know where that came from! I was nearly shaking and could feel the surge of my powers through me. I’d left my seat with my book and sat on an empty desk furiously writing out notes with my quill, refusing to look up. The air was silent only a moment but Professor Black continued and I just noticed his raised brow but he refused to entertain the situation, apparently.</p><p>After class, I walked to my already favourite tree by the black lake that I used as my reading area when the common room became too crowded, and I saw Hiccup ankle deep in the lake, studying the weeds with such a funny expression I had to refrain from laughing at him.</p><p>“Oh Hey, Elsa!”</p><p>He said sweetly. As anticipated, I became fast friends with Kristoff and Hiccup, both sharing the contentment with solitude, peace and quiet – situations I prefer to keep myself in. My greeting was just reaching my lips when I’d heard his already annoying voice from behind me,</p><p>“Woah, Miss Perfect! Are you a two timing player? Or do you just move on fast?”</p><p>Hiccups smile dropped and he remained quiet. I knew if he wasn’t shy around others, and if it wasn’t Jack Frost, Hiccup would have made a sarcastic, witty remark to defend me. I turned slowly to see Jack making his way casually, his green and black robes flailing around behind him. Who does this boy think he is?! We’re <em>eleven</em> for crying out loud.</p><p>“Are you following me or something? It’s like you’re everywhere.”</p><p>What am I doing?! Conceal, don’t feel – don’t let them see! This incessant boy got under my skin so much so that I have to keep myself in check even more so! He laughed of course, and I could feel my powers surge through my very core and spread through my veins. Oh no, conceal don’t feel, Elsa! Suddenly a small snowflake landed upon my nose. I gasped, horrified, but the other two failed to notice.</p><p>“Maybe I’m everywhere because I’m all you ever see.”</p><p>He said with a wink, is he… flirting with me? I thought, almost repulsed. I apparently reacted before thinking because before I could respond, Hiccup yelped and fell onto his behind upon ice, his ankles jammed within. I gasped as I saw the icy tendrils spiralling around me and across the floor to the lake which was now half frozen. I gaped in horror, where Jack’s eyes widened in wonder,</p><p>“Woah… What - ?”</p><p>Thankfully neither seemed to realise it was me… until I started silently crying and ran away. God only knows what they thought then. But I couldn’t take it, couldn’t bare it. How was I going to do this?</p>
