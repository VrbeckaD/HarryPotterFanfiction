    <p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Potter would be his. He would find him and protect him. Though the boy was a permanent thorn in his side, he would not kill him. He was his last horcrux. He could not allow the boy to come to harm, from his hand or not. Not anymore. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Voldemort was leaning back in his chair, nail tapping on the desk in a constant rhythm. He could not shake how very similar yet starkly <em>different</em> and more horrid a childhood Harry was having compared to his. He couldn’t get the images of abuse to leave his mind, no amount of Occluding was helping either. He had to get his horcrux out of his relatives hands and safe with him, close to him, in his-</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He stood so fast he startled Nagini, he dearest friend, awake. Since when did he care for the boy’s safety, and since when did he want to <em>coddle him</em>? The boy had been a thorn in his side for so long. If anything all he should only want to keep the boy secure enough to keep himself alive possibly test new spells on him, now though that thought made a strange feeling settle in the pit of his stomach, and all he wanted was the boy living, not surviving. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">-Master- Voldemort turned sharply to look at his familiar, -You’re thinking far to loudly, and you woke me up, but if it is of any help to you I would never personally deny myself my mate.- He spluttered, but before he could get a word out Nagini spoke again, -It is obvious that is what he is! We both know he’s powerful, you marked him as your equal the night and, based on what I could interpret from you racing thoughts, he isn’t living only surviving. Very much like yourself, might I add.- Voldemort sighed.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">-I suppose it could just be a likeness I see between us that is making me want to protect him. That and the horcrux.- The snake shook her head and slithered towards him. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">-Whatever you say, Tom.- She said as she made her way to settle on his shoulders. He glared at her, but let the subject drop. He needed to do something to save Harry and soon, if what he saw in the boy’s head was true. Unsure of who else to go to, he made his way to Severus’s potion lab. The times where he had to check on the man were the only times he wished head quarters was smaller. He put that thought to the back of his head as he knocked on the Potion Masters door.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Whoever you are, conceal you magic before you enter.” He called. He must have been completing the potions he’d asked for, both of which being highly reactive to magic. He conceal his magic carefully before entering. He saw Severus leaning over a cauldron, carefully adding another ingredient. Once it was done, he immediately turned his back to him and continued. From what he could see of what potion it was, it was a very delicate stage, so the Dark Lord busied himself with looking at the other 5 potions on stasis. They all looked near completion, 3 healing potions that were all different colours and obviously still in the testing phase, and 2 other versions of a kind of controlling potion that should work similar to how the Imperious curse does without being traceable. He felt the magic shift in the room and heard a sharp intake of breath.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“My Lord! I apologize, I was not able to leave that potion without it-” He bowed low</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“It is quite alright, Severus, I do not want those potions made incorrectly. It would be disastrous.” Severus nodded. “How long before they will be ready?” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I do not have an exact date yet, my Lord, but I will ensure it is soon and that they are brewed correctly.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“That is quite alright, Severus. Just ensure they are done to the right standard.” The man nodded, “As for why I am here in the first place, I must ask what you know about Harry Potter’s current living situation.” Severus looked confused for all of a second before answering.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“From what I am told, he lives like a prince, is given everything he asks for on a silver platter and is far to arrogant a brat to act like he doesn’t.” Severus sneered, his hate obvious. He nearly lost his composure, but managed to conceal his anger at the snide, hate filled comment. He had no idea why it bothered him but, Gods above, did it bother him.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“And do you know where he currently resides?” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I do not, my Lord. It is under Fidelius and I do not know the Secret Keeper. I apologize, my Lord.” Voldemort lifted his hand to silence him.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“No matter, no matter. I will need you to find out where he is. At least the general area, is that understood?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Yes, my Lord.” The potions master bowed low. He nodded and swept from the room, waiting to hear the door close before letting his magic free. Before he could get far, however, Severus appeared out from behind the door. “I may know the area he is, actually.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Then speak, Severus.” The man nodded, leaving the room.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Albus has not told me explicitly, but I believe he lives somewhere in Surrey, based on what others in the Order have let slip. He believes me deaf, I suppose.” Voldemort allowed himself to smirk. “I may be able to follow one of the chickens to the Apparition point outside of the wards. It may take some time, however, as not many, if any, trust me enough to allow me to join them in patrols. I do believe Dumbledore plans to have him stay the last week with the Weasley clan.” He nodded. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“If you can, find a way to approach him. I doubt he’s been in anything like the household you explained, nor do i think he’s has been told as much as you think about his place in the war. I believe it would be more beneficial if we can coerce him to my side, rather than kill him.” Severus nodded,</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He had finally come to the conclusion that the only reason he cared was because he could feel the same pain from his own past in the young man. Nothing more. By his side, his blasted familiar let out a snake laugh.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">-Fucking snake…- He muttered, earning a offended hiss. He snorted slightly before continuing on his way to his office, putting his Potter-shaped problem to the back of his mind. He had a meeting to prepare.</span>
