    <i>NO ONE MOURNS THE WICKED -- MANY YEARS AFTER HOGWARTS</i>

</p><p>"Do you admit to having a relationship with Dark Lord Potter?" Georgina Puckle, the current Question Master, asked.</p><p>"What does that have to do with the Swearing In?" Draco asked.</p><p>Georgina leaned forward slightly. "First, we get all of the skeletons, for lack of a better phrase, out of the closet. Then, Religious Minister Thropp-Potter will hold the Swearing In Ceremony. After that, Miss Moon will give you the tour and you'll have time to settle in. This is the way the process works, Lord Malfoy."</p><p>Draco took a moment to collect himself. As he settled against the back of the chair, he nodded. "That depends on what you mean by relationship. We were friends, in school. We became friends during our third year at Hogwarts."</p><p>"And when did your relationship turn romantic?" Georgina asked.</p><p>"Who said it did?" Draco countered.</p><p>"It's been widely reported that Dark Lord Potter is who you saved from the bottom of the Lake, during the second task of the TriWizard Tournament. Clearly, he was very important to you," Georgina replied cattily.</p><p>"He wasn't a Dark Wizard then, and of course he was important to me. By our fourth year, we were best friends. We were also roommates. And let's not forget -- I didn't choose who Deputy Headmistress McGonagall put at the bottom of that lake," Draco said.</p><p>"And are you relieved and glad, as much of the magickal world is, that Dark Lord Potter is dead?" Georgina asked.</p><p>"As far as I know, he's a shut-in, a recluse...he's not dead. I mean, the magickal world hasn't heard from him in years, but the Potter Estate holds, and his interests in India are well kept, the Black Castle still stands as does Savitri House in Southland. I think we'd have heard, conclusively, if he was dead," Draco replied.</p><p>"Yes, but that doesn't answer the question. Everyone else seems happy that he's dead, or left us, or what have you. Are you?" Georgina asked.</p><p>"That's complicated, Miss Puckle. It's complicated because, as I said, we were friends. Dear friends, during our Hogwarts years," Draco responded. "No. I wouldn't be happy if he died. No, I'm not happy that the world hasn't seen him in years and years. But, there's nothing I can do about that and the only thing I really can do is to move on with my life and be the best Prime Minister that I know how to be. Surely, our world deserves that, right?"</p><p>Georgina smiled. "Of course. We'll move on."</p><p>Draco shifted uneasily. "For the record, he wasn't born wicked. Wicked isn't born, it's made. He had a mother, once -- by all accounts, a beautiful woman who sacrificed herself to save him and who defeated Dark Lord Voldemort. He had a father, regardless of that relationship. A brother, a sister, a stepmother. A godfather, though that ended tragically. My point is...he had a family. People who loved him. Wicked isn't born, it's made. Something happened to him, along the way...and he chose not to turn back from the dark. That's different. It isn't Dark Lord Potter that I was friends with -- that I was close to. Harry was different, back then. Good, even. He saved other people before himself. He was doted on by a grandmother who loved him more than her own life. Whatever happened...it happened to him, and we need to remember that, lest we repeat past events."</p><p>Georgina sighed. "Regardless, here we are now -- so, let's continue with the questions..."</p><p>Draco answered more questions, but in his mind he kept returning to his Hogwarts days and to the stories and events that even he didn't know the full truth of. No matter what, he mourned the loss of his friend; even if no one else did.</p><p>************************</p>
