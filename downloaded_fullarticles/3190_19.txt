    <p>February, 2013</p><p>Hermione,</p><p>I'm so sorry,<br/>
I need to go<br/>
I'm so bloody confused and I need some space to figure things out<br/>
I'm leaving for Italy as you read this note<br/>
Go back to London with your parents, Hermione</p><p>Please, forgive me,<br/>
Blaise</p><p>Hermione read the note in her hand for the third time. Tears slowly descended to her cheeks as the words registered in her mind. It wasn't that she was in love with him. They weren't together for that long yet. But she did care about him. And now, she just couldn't believe the cheek of the bastard. How dare he?! After a month of seeing each other, he left her without any apparent reason. And it wasn't just the month they spent dating either, it was also three months of pure friendship after they met the first time and five months of wooing until she finally gave in and agreed to go out with him. And he didn't even have the decency of talking about it to her directly. He didn't even give her a call. Oh no, he left her a note; one measly note saying that he needed to figure things out. Well, he better left this country already, before she figured out how to track him down and castrated him.<br/></p><p>*----------------------------------------------------------------------------*</p><p>Hermione had been in Australia for the last two years. She left England right after she finished university. Her father had gotten a transfer offer from the company he worked at to one of the countries available for two years. Her parents immediately chose Australia; it's been on their wish list for as long as she remembered: to visit Australia. And now, they would live there for two years. Hermione was offered the choice of staying there, in London, or moving with her parents. They wanted her to go of course, but she was an adult, hardly needed her parents to make a decision. She thought long and hard about what she wanted, but ultimately, she decided to join her parents. She's got her parents' thirst to experience new things. Besides, there wasn't much left here. She had Harry and Ron, her best friends, but that's as far as it went. No job yet, and no boyfriend. She could still communicate with Harry and Ron (and the Weasleys!), technology was a wonderful thing, and she could still visit London if she wanted. So she packed her suitcase and said goodbye to Harry and the Weasleys.</p><p>She settled in Australia, still in her parents' new house, and looked for information on university around the city. She wanted to further her study. Hermione just loved to learn. She read any and everything. It would be a waste to just sit around doing nothing for two years or doing underrated jobs because of the lack of qualified degree and/or experience. Eventually, she decided to go to one of the universities in Brisbane and took mastery in Human Resource (HR) Management. The course would last for two years if she wasn't lazy. And Hermione Granger certainly wasn't what you called lazy. So, she could go back with her parents when her father's contract ended if she chose to.</p><p>*----------------------------------------------------------------------------*</p><p>Hermione met Blaise nine months ago. She was enjoying her meal at the little café near her flat when someone came and went down under her table. She nearly shrieked out of mortification because she was wearing a skirt. She quickly clamped her legs shut and glared at the man. He was holding a finger to his mouth. Right then, a man with arms the size of her thighs came in the café and looked around. She figured he was the one looking for the git under table. She could call him out and let him get crushed by the very pissed off looking bloke, or she could let him be. She was in a good mood, though, so she just continued to eat without a care in the world. Not long after, the man with bulky muscles left the café in a huff. The git then went out from under the table and took a seat before her. She took a good at him and noticed that he was a handsome man with dark eyes and hair, olive skin and broad shoulder. He looked to be her age too.</p><p>"Thank you, Miss-?" he looked at her quizzically.</p><p>"Granger" She said simply.</p><p>He smiled. "I'm Blaise Zabini. Thank you Miss Granger, you saved me from a black eye… or a damaged kidney. Did you see his arm?" He joked. From his accent, she figured he was British too.</p><p>"I did. What did you do to him anyway?"</p><p>"Ah, a fellow British" he said, smiling. "I flirted with his girlfriend. She was very pretty, you see. I might or might not almost kiss said girlfriend too. In my defense, if I knew she had a boyfriend looking like that, I wouldn't go after her" he said.</p><p>"Did you know if she had a boyfriend at all?"</p><p>"Well, she did say she was with someone, but she didn't protest much. So I thought, why not? And then the human bulldozer came out of nowhere and next thing I knew, I ran for my life" he said, grinning. Why not indeed, she thought wryly.</p><p>Hermione just rolled her eyes. She knew this type of guy. She had been a victim of one herself.</p><p>"To express my gratitude, how about I pay for the meal?" He asked, nodding at my nearly empty plate and cup of coffee.</p><p>She declined of course. She didn't know him. She just wanted to go home and read the new novel she just bought at the bookstore near the café. But he insisted. As he said, she saved him from a damaged kidney. He then ordered a light meal for himself and ate while talking to her. He asked which part of England she came from, what she was doing in Australia, and such.</p><p>Since that day, they met regularly at least once a week. At first, he just randomly turned up when Hermione was at the café or the bookstore. He claimed he just saw Hermione and decided to join her. But after the fourth time, they made an appointment for lunch the next day. They usually had lunch at the café. Hermione didn't mind, he was fun to be around, if a little flirtatious. Well, he was a womanizer. He flirted with every woman he met and had a date with different women every few days.</p><p>They were eating lunch as usual when Blaise looked at her seriously and said, "Go on a date with me."</p><p>She didn't know what to make of it. She thought he was joking for sure. But he looked quite serious and she blushed under his intense stare.</p><p>"What?" she asked.</p><p>"Go out with me, Hermione. Let me take you to dinner. I like you. I'd like to see if we work just as well in a romantic sense" he said, still staring at her.</p><p>Hermione didn't know what to make of it. He liked to flirt, yes, but it was in his nature. He flirted with everyone with skirt.</p><p>When he assured her that he was serious, she gave a flat no. Just a couple of weeks ago, he went on a date with a busty redhead he met at a bar. A week before that, a tall blonde. And so the list went on and on. They even needed to reschedule their meeting a few times because Blaise stupidly promised the women a lunch date on their assigned get together. So of course Hermione didn't want to be on the long list of Blaise Zabini's love trap victim.</p><p>Although if she thought about it, he seemed a bit off this past few weeks. His date was far in between and hadn't even mention any woman in two about two weeks. A few times she caught him looking at her strangely. She didn't pay it any mind, just chalked it up as his usual Blaise Zabini's oddness.</p><p>She certainly wasn't the kind of woman Blaise went to a date with. Sure, she knew she was pretty. She wasn't vain, but she wasn't insecure either.</p><p>She didn't have the hourglass figure, but she was no board either. She had the right proportion in every body part. Her breasts and arse weren't overly large, but they certainly weren't lacking. She was petite, but with a pair of toned and long, slender legs. Her curly brown hair that in her early years looked wild and had a life of its own, now after the intense treatment she took and extra care she was still taking, it became beautiful, gentle waves that reached her hip. Her chocolate eyes gave her an innocent look. She had a cute button nose and slightly pouty lips. There was a small splattering of freckles on the bridge of her nose. Her friends often said she was beautiful, but still, she didn't see herself as Blaise's kind of girl. She was just a bookworm, didn't wear tight and minimal clothing, couldn't flirt to save her life, and didn't do casual dating. She was a virgin for Heaven's sake. She wasn't a prude by any means, and didn't mean to wait for marriage either. She just wanted to be completely and utterly in love with the man she eventually gave all of herself to. She didn't want to repeat the last incident where she got her heart broken by some arsehole who only was after her knickers. Luckily, she caught him before it was too late. But the damage was done. It was hard for her to trust men after that. Especially this kind of man.</p><p>After that afternoon though, he proved to be very persistent indeed. He stopped going on dates with every women he met, completely. He still met Hermione regularly and was constantly asking her for a date. She was flattered; Blaise Zabini was surely what they considered a catch. But she always said no, she just didn't want to pick up pieces after he inevitably broke her heart.</p><p>Eventually though, it was his persistence and determination that won Hermione over. He stopped his womanizing ways, was being a complete gentleman, and she couldn't say she didn't enjoy the attention he gave her. All this time, she held him at arms length because she didn't want to fall for him. But her guards were slowly broken down by him and she knew it.</p><p>"Go on a date with me," he said one day. Always the same sentence every day.</p><p>"Why?"</p><p>"Why what?" He asked, confused. Usually Hermione just said no or changed the subject.</p><p>"Why Blaise, why do you want to go on a date with a bookworm like me? Why are you so determined? Why don't you just go back chasing those bimbos who are so desperate for your attention they want to kill me with their eyes every time they see me with you? Just why?"</p><p>He snickered a little and after considering the question, he said "Hermione, I was always serious when I asked you for a date. I've been attracted to you since our earlier meetings. You are different from those bimbos you were talking about. Just like a breath of fresh air for a guy like me. Please Hermione, give me chance. I'd like to see where this goes. I'll prove to you that we can be good together", he explained patiently and then looked at her expectantly.</p><p>The truth was, Hermione respected him more for his determination on asking her out. And it didn't hurt that he was very good looking. Maybe, liked him a bit. So finally after many deliberations, or call it temporary insanity, Hermione said yes. She just hoped this one didn't end up in disaster.</p><p>They went on their first date three days later. It was the standard date, they had a dinner at a restaurant; a very grand restaurant. It was nice. Just nice. Truthfully, she was a little disappointed. It was like he didn't know her at all. Those bimbos might be a little too happy with dinner in an upscale restaurant, but not her. Everyone who knew her would know that Hermione Granger didn't like anything excessive. She preferred their favorite little café to a massive restaurant. Not to mention she felt inadequate about her appearance even though Blaise assured her that she looked pretty. But she was patient. She didn't want to write him off because of one "just nice" date. Thankfully though, the quality increased each date. Last week, they went to the beach where they first met and had a simple picnic in a secluded corner watching sunset. It was great, and Hermione started to think that it was good they gave it a go, because she liked him. If given enough time, she could fall in love with him.</p><p>But when she really thought about it, there were clearly some cracks in the wall. He would do something sweet, and then froze and got closed off a little, like he was emotionally stopping himself from being too close to her. She knew from what he told her that he had never been in a serious relationship before. Because of his mother, who liked to play with men's heart and didn't give Blaise enough love, he always thought all women were the same and he had to guard himself from them. Until he met her. Like he said, she was different. Now she just hoped she wasn't used as his lab rat at his relationship attempt.</p><p>They were looking at little girl playing hide and seek with her father at the park. Her father obviously didn't try that hard, and Hermione smiled the girl found her father and then he swung her around before putting her on his shoulder, making the little girl laughed. The scene was very sweet.</p><p>"Aren't they just adorable, Blaise? Nothing is quite as precious as a baby girl and their daddy" Hermione said, still smiling.</p><p>"Yes," he answered simply, smiling too, and looked at her strangely. He then kissed her on the forehead and then froze, like he didn't mean to, and didn't quite know what to do next. She wouldn't be surprised if this was the first time he did things like this with a woman. He kissed, he snogged, he had sex. He didn't smile and kissed a girl's forehead in an innocent way. She decided to set his nerves at ease and just smiled at him.</p><p>Again:</p><p>"Blaise, do you want to meet my parents?"</p><p>He immediately tensed up, "What? Why?"</p><p>"As my boyfriend, of course. You are, aren't you?" she asked hesitantly. It only made him tensed up some more.</p><p>"Yes.. Uh, yes of course. But I don't know why I should be meeting your parents now. Isn't it a little early?"</p><p>"Well, we've known each other long enough. And you certainly pursued me for a while before I gave you an okay," she said, still hesitant. "Besides, we're moving back to England in two weeks Blaise, why wouldn't my parents want to meet the guy their daughter brought back home?"</p><p>"I don't know, Hermione. Maybe we should wait for a bit before meeting your parents. I still think it's too early is all."</p><p>"Okay," she said simply, and then went to busy herself tidying her files on the table to mask her disappointment.</p><p>It wasn't that different from the topic of his mother. Whenever she asked about her to Blaise, he immediately changed the subject. He never talked about her. She just knew her as a cold mother toward Blaise and was given the title the Black Widow. Her husbands from every marriages were mysteriously mixed up in accidents and left her with mountains of money.</p><p>She thought he was just nervous about the idea that was so foreign for a serial womanizer like himself but they would still be okay. In hindsight, she knew it should have given her a warning about his trepidation about this relationship.</p><p>*----------------------------------------------------------------------------*</p><p>Last night, they ordered a take out and had a quiet night-in in her flat. It was the first time Blaise came into her flat. Usually he just picked her up for a date or drove her home. They had been talking about moving back to England the past few weeks. Before Hermione said yes to the date offer, she told Blaise that she probably would be moving back to England with parents shortly. Her father's contract here was ending and she just finished her mastery. He said it was okay. He said he was going back with her since England was his home too and it wasn't like he had a job here. He was just travelling when he met her and decided to pursue her so he decided to stay a few more months. This was the fifth country he visited. His mother were so loaded from her many marriages, he didn't need to work a day in his life.</p><p>The night was perfect, she thought. They ate dinner and were talking about their plan to go back to London in just a few days. The atmosphere was intimate, meaning warm and comfortable. They talked well into 1 a.m, and then fell asleep on the couch.</p><p>Hermione was happy when she woke up in the morning. When she saw that Blaise wasn't with her, she thought nothing of it. When she called his name and he didn't come or even answer, she was confused, why he didn't stay for breakfast. But when she saw the note on the coffee table she initially overlooked and then quickly read it, the confusion turned into a mix of anger and sadness. Italy, she thought over and over. Italy, his mother's home.</p><p>She didn't know what to think. She thought they were good together, she thought he was sure of his feelings for her. It was him who excessively chasing her, after all, not the other way around. You are different, he said. Different my arse. He was just sore that she was actively rejecting him, she thought viciously. Ugh, she felt so stupid. And what she hated the most was people making her feel stupid. He better made himself scarce from now on, or he would know why you just didn't mess with Hermione Granger's heart. God, she was glad they hadn't gone all the way in their relationship yet, she could dance on the dinner table right now. At least it was a victory for her. Not that she was thinking about it, because she certainly didn't feel love for him yet. She was just happy to avoid the complete heartbreak and regret on her part.</p><p>Now she just couldn't stop crying either. Again, it wasn't just him. It was every failed relationship she had with men in general. She just couldn't find the right man for herself. It was always something or the other. In high school, Hermione and Ron tried their hands on relationship. It was working for a while. They were content. A couple of months later, they noticed that they lacked something. What it was, they didn't know. Not to mention they were fighting a lot lately. Eventually though, Hermione noticed what Ginny and Nevile had but wasn't present in her own relationship. It was passion. They acted more like best friends they had always been, than as lovers. They were comfortable, yes, too comfortable, but they weren't passionate. They weren't even passionate when they were shouting angry things about each other. Those were just a bunch hurtful words they knew best which to use to hit home. So, after she felt that her relationship with Ron had dwindled into nothing and got too mundane, she decided she needed to end things before their years of friendship became unsalvageable. After only five months of dating, she finally up and told him she wanted a breakup. She was relieved when he said that he felt the same way. She thought she was going to lose Ron, but apparently, they stayed the best of friends (when she wasn't nagging him about this or that and he wasn't being an insensitive prat).</p><p>In university, she met Viktor Krum, a transfer student from Bulgaria. He was handsome, had a stocky build and played rugby. He was sweet enough, but it was anything but serious between them. He was just there for three months. They parted ways and promised to keep communication. Now though, there weren't any communication either. They just grew distant.</p><p>The third was a year after Viktor. Still in university, he was her senior. His name was David. He was a good looking guy with blue eyes and dark hair. Popular too. She didn't know what he saw in her. Usually she was just a bookworm and a nerd for the guys in school and college, she wasn't exciting enough. But somehow, this popular guy gave her his attention. He sat with her in the library and walked her to class. She was flattered of course. And her innocent mind rejected it when Ginny said he was a bad news. After only four months of dating him, she fancied herself falling in love with him and decided to give him something. Not her virginity, she still wasn't sure and wasn't confident enough for that, but maybe a second base. She decided to go to his flat and surprise him, wearing a little black dress and a pair of black, five inches stiletto she bought for the speacial occasion. Because it would be special, at least for her. She had never done anything like this before.</p><p>It was him who made her speechless, though. When she was in front of his flat, she heard moaning. Maybe they were in the living room sofa, because you could hear them from the outside. She decided to knock, even when her heart felt like breaking, because who knew, it could be his friends, coming over and decided to do the dirty deed there. They didn't open the door, maybe they didn't hear it over their own moaning and groaning, or they just didn't care. She then tried to grab the handle and open it, and it worked. Apparently they were in such a hurry, they didn't lock the door. The sight that greeted her was horrid. She couldn't remember it without feeling ill. Her boyfriend was naked and wrapped around an equally naked, leggy blonde.</p><p>The fight after that was not pretty. He was mocking her because she thought he was going to hold back when she didn't give him any. The blonde wowan looking awkward in just her lingerie, not sure what to do. There were a lot of tears on her part. After that, she ran back home and cried herself to sleep. The next day, Ginny came with ice cream and a stack of comedy movies. She was grateful Ginny didn't say I told you so. She should have listened to Ginny.</p><p>After all of this she thought she was going to stop dating, just waiting for Mr. Right. And it sort of worked, until Blaise came at least. She resisted, she really did. But he was so determined until she finally gave in. And now this, this utter bullshite about figuring things out. She couldn't help feeling like a failure, the girl no man wanted.</p><p>But no, she couldn't think like that. If Ginny and Harry, or even Ron, heard she said something like that about herself, they would smack her upside the head for sure. She smiled, remembering her best friends. God, she missed them. She quickly dried her tears and checked the flat for some important things that couldn't be left. She was packed, ready to leave the next day. Initially, she was going to take a different flight from her parents because she was going with Blaise who hadn't met her parents yet. Now though, it seemed like she needed to book the same flight as her parents'. Damn him!</p>
