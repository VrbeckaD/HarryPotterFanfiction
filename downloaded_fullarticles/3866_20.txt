    <p>It was dark. The single window covered by thin curtains let little moonlight in. Snape listened to the sounds from the corridor. Sometimes he could hear whispered conversations, sometimes hurried footsteps, and sometimes soft giggling from the interns. He waited until it was finally quiet, before he struggled to sit up and lean back against the headboard. He cast a Muffliato and closed the curtains around his bed with a flick of his wand. Still cautious, he reached for the bedside table, until he felt the smooth paper of yesterday’s Daily Prophet. He lifted it up and placed it on his lap. In the scant light that came from the corridor and the window, he transfigured it into a bowl.</p>
<p>Pathetic as he was, that meagre action already had him breathing heavily. He sagged down and closed his eyes. When his breathing returned to normal again, he opened them. He gripped the bowl and bent down until his face was right over it. Then he pointed his wand towards his stomach and muttered a spell. He was retching immediately. The bitter taste that flooded his mouth made tears stream from his eyes and snot drip from his nose. He heaved and threw up, again and again, until his stomach was emptied. </p>
<p>He collapsed in his bed in an undignified slump. He was tired. So very tired. He barely managed to lift his wand to cast a cleaning spell and transfigure the bowl back before he promptly fell asleep.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>“Is he ready yet?” A rough voice asked the next morning. </p>
<p>Snape woke with a groan when his bed curtains suddenly parted open and more light streamed in. He felt as if he hadn’t slept in weeks. His limbs were so heavy, he could barely move. With some effort he opened one bleary eye. When the light hit, he closed it immediately, but it was enough to spot a red uniform. Of course. If he'd had any energy, he would have snorted.</p>
<p>“Let me have a look.” That was the voice of Mr. Smethwyck, Healer-in-charge of the <i>Dai Llewellyn Ward for Serious Bites</i> at St Mungo’s, where Snape was currently located.</p>
<p>Snape opened his eyes again, just in time to see the diagnostic spell hit him. Smethwyck, a man in his late-forties with short, brown curls, reached out for the scroll that appeared in mid-air and read it with a frown.</p>
<p>“Strange,” he said. “No improvements in the past few days.”</p>
<p>“But he's been here for weeks!” The Auror exclaimed. Then added, suspicious, “You are not neglecting your duties, are you?”</p>
<p>“Certainly not.” The Healer raised an eyebrow. “This is, after all, my job.”</p>
<p>The Auror tapped his lips. “Very well,” he said. “Let us know as soon as he is stable. The Minister, and the public, would like to see him tried sooner rather than later.”</p>
<p>“Naturally,” Smethwyck said calmly.</p>
<p>“Unless I hear from you earlier, I'll return in a week to check on him again.” The Auror nodded at Smethwyck and strode out.</p>
<p>Snape closed his eyes and sighed in relief. So the trial had been delayed for another week. He would not have to suffer Azkaban just yet. Or worse, being freed of all charges and having to decide what to do next. He knew very well that there were no employers that would hire him, no clients that would want his services. No, for now, being in hospital was the better option.</p>
<p>Healer Smethwyck closed the door behind the Auror and approached Snape’s bed. “I have breakfast for you.”</p>
<p>The smell of porridge wafted past his nostrils. Snape’s stomach rumbled, but he stared at the tray floating above his bed in distaste. “I don’t want it,” he rasped and coughed. His throat felt as if it had been lined with sandpaper.</p>
<p>Smethwyck ignored that. “Can you sit?”</p>
<p>Snape tried to move, but he could only lift his head a few inches before the surroundings danced before his eyes. He dropped it back with a groan.</p>
<p>“Let me.” Smethwyck placed his hands under Snape’s arms and hoisted him up. With one quick movement, Snape found himself upright, supported by the headboard, his head falling back against the wall. He allowed the unwanted attention with gritted teeth. Not that he could have done anything to stop it.</p>
<p>The Healer sat down on the chair next to his bed and stirred the porridge. Snape glared at it. He knew it had been laced with potions. He wanted to refuse, but then Smethwyck would find another way to get the potions in him. Possibly via injection. That would work faster than swallowing and, as a result, require more ingenuity to be rid of. Something Snape didn’t have the energy for right now.</p>
<p>Smethwyck placed one hand on the back of Snape’s head to lift it and held the spoon in front of him. Snape fisted the sheets, but opened his mouth obediently. He hated this. Hated being spoonfed. Hated being propped up like a doll, but he had no choice. It was the price he had to pay for refusing to heal, and pay he would. Considering the alternative, it was hardly a high price anyway.</p>
<p>The Healer fed him another spoonful and waited patiently until he had chewed and swallowed. When he was done, Snape dropped his head back and panted from the exertion. Merlin, he was pathetic. “I don’t know how you can put up with this,” he rasped once he had caught his breathing back under control.</p>
<p>“It’s my job,” Smethwyck said calmly.</p>
<p>Snape stayed silent. He allowed the Healer to lift his head back up and opened his mouth for the next spoonful.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>“Professor.”</p>
<p>It was right after dinner. As usual, Snape had tried to avoid eating it, spilling as much as he could on the sheets, but his Healer had smiled calmly and forced it down his throat anyway. Afterwards, he had cleaned the wound on Snape's neck and refreshed the bandages. Now, with his stomach filled with blood-replenishers and other unwelcome substances, Snape was feeling somewhat less tired and lightheaded and was sitting up in his bed with a book. He didn’t need to look up to see who had entered. There was only one person who called him by his old title here.</p>
<p>Potter stumbled into his room almost every day. Why, Snape had no idea. The first day the boy had graced the room with his presence, he had fidgeted for half an hour, and then suddenly blurted out a long, incoherent monologue, which Snape had eventually understood as an expression of gratitude. When Potter was finished, Snape had asked how the he had survived. Then, satisfied with the answer, he had gone back to his reading. He had said everything he had wanted to say and had assumed that Potter had done the same. Nevertheless, the boy kept visiting. He usually settled somewhere in the room while Snape ignored him, until Smethwyck shooed him out.</p>
<p>This time, Potter walked unsteadily to his bedside, in a mint-green hospital tunic that Snape himself was intimately familiar with. Potter dropped down into the chair, as heavily as if he was carrying the weight of the world on his shoulders. Knowing the boy, he probably thought he did.</p>
<p>Snape turned the page, to the sound of Potter’s soft breathing. He could feel his stare prickle on his neck. It made him self-conscious about his own raspy breath, his bandaged throat and shabby nightshirt. He gripped the book harder and tried to ignore it, but after a few minutes, he slammed the book down. </p>
<p>“Stop staring!” Those few words were immediately followed by a coughing fit.</p>
<p>Potter, knowing better than to pat his back, waited until Snape was finished and smiled sadly. “I had a nightmare.”</p>
<p>Snape took a sip of water from the glass on his bedside table. “We all do. Don’t bother me with it,” he rasped, and coughed again.</p>
<p>“It was about you dying,” Potter continued obliviously.</p>
<p>“Is that all? I have nightmares about everybody else dying. Now leave.”</p>
<p>“May I look into your eyes?”</p>
<p>“What?” Snape blinked and turned his head in Potter’s direction. He had large circles under his eyes and his face was pale, but his expression looked sincere.</p>
<p>“I know it’s strange.” Potter was blushing. “But I keep having nightmares about you and that moment in the Shack. All the blood and... well. It’s probably driving my Healers mad to find me screaming every night. They keep telling me that you aren't dead, but it’s not helping. So we thought that maybe, if I, you know, look into your eyes again and see you are alive, up close, the nightmares will go away.”</p>
<p>Snape snapped the book closed. “That’s the most ridiculous...” He coughed again. “Most ridiculous thing I’ve ever heard.”</p>
<p>Potter shrugged. “It seemed to help you when you were dying, so I thought it might help us both if we did it again.”</p>
<p>“Those were different circumstances. As it is, I have no wish to stare lovingly into your eyes,” Snape rasped.</p>
<p>“Not lovingly!”</p>
<p>Smethwyck chose exactly that moment to enter the room. “Healer Smethwyck,” Snape said as he walked past his bed, “I am tired. Do escort Mr. Potter out.”</p>
<p>Potter stood up with a sigh when Smethwyck approached him and practically stumbled out of the door. He was clearly exaggerating his displeasure: Potter, the poor victim. Some things never changed. Snape scowled after him.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Potter returned the next evening, dressed once more in the formless hospital tunic. “I need you to look at me,” he said before he had even sat down.</p>
<p>Snape lifted an eyebrow and continued his reading.</p>
<p>“Dammit, Snape.” Snape blinked when Potter slammed his fist down on his nightstand. “I know you don’t like me, but all you have to do is look at me!”</p>
<p>“Calm down, Mr. Potter,” Smethwyck said and came to stand behind him. “This is a hospital and my patient needs his rest. If you can’t behave, I will have to ask you to leave.”</p>
<p>“Sorry,” Potter said with a look that was anything but sorry. “It's bloody frustrating. All I'm asking for is for him to look at me, but he’s refusing.”</p>
<p>“Ah,” Smethwyck said. “Your Healers suggested you to try eye contact therapy, didn’t they? I heard about that. I think it’s a marvellous idea. You should try it, Mr. Snape.”</p>
<p>Snape glared at the man. “I thought you were my Healer, not his.”</p>
<p>“I am,” Smethwyck said, “but I wouldn’t have encouraged Mr. Potter if I didn’t think it could be beneficial for you. My colleagues on the continent have been experimenting with it and have seen very promising results. It helps patients deal better with their emotions after trauma or during illness. In fact,” Smethwyck’ brown eyes bored into Snape’s, “I insist that you do it. I’m inclined to believe that your unexpected lack of progress toward recovery might stem from a mental issue. Mr. Potter's suggestion might help you.”</p>
<p>“I thought Healers weren’t allowed to force patients into treatment.” Snape snapped.</p>
<p>A muscle in Smethwyck’s jaw twitched. “Not usually, no, but your case is different, as you well know. I’ve been ordered to heal you, so you are well enough to stand trial. And I will do it.”</p>
<p>Just his luck that he had been assigned an overly enthusiastic Healer. Snape crossed his arms over his chest. “I’m lightheaded.”</p>
<p>Smethwyck merely pointed his wand at him and cast the diagnostic spell. He plucked a scroll out of thin air and read it. “No, you aren't.”</p>
<p>Snape scowled at the man. “I do not wish to waste my time looking at Potter. In fact, I’m certain our complicated past will negatively impact my healing.”</p>
<p>Smethwyck pocketed the scroll. “I disagree. Either way, we won't know unless we try.”</p>
<p>When Snape was still glaring at him, Smethwyck narrowed his eyes. “Is there another reason you do not wish to cooperate?”</p>
<p>Damn. Snape hid his face behind his hair. If Smethwyck suspected something and started to monitor him more closely, he wouldn’t be able to get rid of the potions. Perhaps he had better play along for now, until Potter's attention wandered. That wouldn’t take long anyway. “Fine,” he spat, “but I want him to leave immediately afterwards.”</p>
<p>He waited until Potter nodded before he put his book away. Smethwyck drew the curtains around his bed closed halfway. When that was done, Snape stared at Potter. He had looked into his eyes many times before, during those ill-fated Occlumency lessons. How difficult could it be to do so again? Surely he could manage a few scant seconds of eye gazing. After all, no one had stated how long this absurdity had to last</p>
<p>Potter leaned forward, so close he was almost invading Snape's personal space. Snape tightened his jaw and fought to stay still. He was not going to back away from a seventeen year-old. Why would he even need to get so close? He could see him perfectly well from the other side of the room.</p>
<p>Snape glared at Potter. His eyes were unnaturally widened, as if he was determined not to blink. Stupid boy.</p>
<p>Snape looked past the smudges on Potter's lenses at his right eye, the one that was the farthest away. It was green, so similar to another pair of eyes he had once known. Except for a few dark dots, right under the pupil.</p>
<p>He chanced a glance at Potter's left eye. It was close to him. Much closer than any other green eye had ever been. It looked so vivid. Despite himself, he looked deeper. Potter seemed to welcome him. Snape probably wouldn’t even need his wand to push further, but it would be overwhelming. Even like this it felt as if he could lose himself in the boy’s emotions. He winced and averted his gaze.</p>
<p>Potter blinked, finally, and leant away from him. Good. He wondered what Potter had seen in his stare. Probably not much. His Occlumency shields were an afterthought by now, albeit much weaker as a result of his current condition. Nevertheless, he felt… naked. He draped his arm over himself and moved slightly further away from the boy.</p>
<p>“How was it?”</p>
<p>“Get out,” Snape rasped.</p>
<p>Potter nodded, looking slightly dejected, and stumbled away.</p>
<p>Smethwyck opened his mouth to say something, but one glare silenced him, and he, too, left. He forgot to open the curtains, but Snape didn’t mind. It was the only privacy he had in this blasted hospital.</p>
<p>Snape felt exhausted. He lifted a heavy hand to shove the book off his bed and drew the blankets around him. He fell asleep immediately and almost didn’t wake up in time to go through his vomiting routine.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Potter did not visit the next day. Snape sulked all evening. If the boy went through all the trouble to force him into a staring contest, he could at least take the time tell him if it had helped with the nightmares. It was only polite.</p>
<p>Potter returned the day after. Snape watched him as he walked unsteadily to the chair next to the bed and sat down. He looked paler than he had done two days ago. Snape focused on his book and hated himself for noticing.</p>
<p>“Hello?”</p>
<p>Snape lifted an eyebrow and continued reading.</p>
<p>Potter fidgeted. Snape looked up and glared at him.</p>
<p>“Sorry,” Potter said before Snape had even opened his mouth to berate the boy. “What we did really helped. No nightmares. Well, not about you anyway.” He smiled wistfully.</p>
<p>Snape didn’t know why his toes suddenly curled and his throat constricted. He coughed and took a sip of water, to get rid of the uncomfortable sensation. “Fantastic,” he said hoarsely. “Go away.”</p>
<p>“Oh,” Potter shifted uncomfortably. “I was hoping we could do it again actually.”</p>
<p>Snape snorted. “Why? You just told me it worked.”</p>
<p>“Only for one night.” Potter said.</p>
<p>“I see,” Snape said and looked down at his book again.</p>
<p>“Did it help you? Anything at all?”</p>
<p>Other than giving him the best night sleep he had had in weeks? “No,” Snape said brusquely, turning a page. His sleep may have been good, but it had made him wake up almost too late to be able to remove the potions from his body without a Healer noticing. He would never have forgiven Potter if that happened.</p>
<p>“Oh,” Potter said again. He was so eloquent. “So, er…”</p>
<p>“Potter,” Snape rasped, just so he wouldn’t have to suffer through Potter searching for his words. “Why did you come here?”</p>
<p>Potter's smile was sad. “Company,” he said. “I also have a room to myself, but I hate being alone.”</p>
<p>Snape scowled. Of course. Potter surely had admirers all over St Mungo’s and only came to see him when there was no one else available. He wondered why he even visited him at all. The boy had to be really desperate for company. “I see, unlike the rest of us, you cannot be content with some peace and quiet.”</p>
<p>“I suppose.” Potter stared at his hands. “I wish I had a roommate, but they place patients with the same problems together and there’s no one else like me.”</p>
<p>Snape hmphed. Potter was surely exaggerating. He had a private room because he was the bloody Saviour of the Wizarding World. Unlike Snape, who only had once because nobody wanted to share a room with him. Well, at least his role in the war had one benefit. “Why are you really here? Ran out of adoring fans to keep you company?”</p>
<p>Potter glared at him. “They’re called friends. And yeah, they visit a lot, but only during visiting hours. One hour a day isn’t much.”</p>
<p>Snape snorted. He thought Potter had very little to complain about. One would be lucky to have company for just an hour a day. Preferably less. But no, he had to put up with Smethwyck striding in and out whenever he pleased, and all the smothering that came with it.” </p>
<p>“So can I look at you again?” Potter asked. “It would really help me.”</p>
<p>Smethwyck chose that exact moment to walk in. Snape was certain it had not been an accident. He glared at the man. “Very well,” he said.</p>
<p>Potter leant forwards. Snape crossed his arms over his chest and turned his head.</p>
<p>He stared into Potter's eyes. Potter’s gaze was direct, unguarded. The boy had stared at him many times before, but never like this, as if he could look into his very soul. Snape's arms tightened over his body and he looked away. Unfortunately in the direction of Smethwyck, who raised a stern eyebrow. Snape gritted his teeth and looked back at Potter.</p>
<p>He stared into the right eye. The black dots under the pupil seemed to have grown in size. Snape frowned. Unless you were the Dark Lord, eyes usually didn't change their appearance. He looked a little closer. Yes, they really did seem to be bigger. How odd.</p>
<p>He looked at the other eye. That one also had the dark dots, although in different places. Very odd. He studied Potter intently. His eyes were so green. The exact same shade as Lily’s. He had that same determined look that Lily’s sometimes had. And right now, his gaze was softening, just as Lily’s had often done. His heart clenched painfully. It had been a long time since he had seen green eyes looking back with anything other than contempt. His throat constricted and he tried to swallow. It was almost like looking at Lily again, from before that moment. A long time ago.</p>
<p>He averted his gaze and reached for the glass of water next to him. He heard Potter sigh and lean back.</p>
<p>“Enough,” Snape said, his voice sounding harsh even to his own ears. He picked up his book and did not watch Potter leave.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Of course, the staring match had not been enough for Potter. He returned the next day, stumbling, but slightly less pale.</p>
<p>“I take it that helped,” Snape rasped before Potter had opened his mouth.</p>
<p>“It did.” Potter said. “What about you?”</p>
<p>Snape had not slept so well that night. Potter’s gaze had kept flashing before his mind’s eye. Though when he finally had fallen asleep, he did not have as many nightmares. Luckily he had been clear headed enough to cast the alarm spell, so he had woken up in time for his night routine. "Acceptable,” he said hoarsely.</p>
<p>“Good,” Potter said, almost smiling. “Can we do it again?”</p>
<p>Smethwyck wasn’t around, so Snape could easily refuse. It was not as if he particularly cared about Potter and his nightmares, but then Potter would probably run to Smethwyck first chance he had and Snape would never hear the end of it. So, he nodded.</p>
<p>Potter was definitely smiling now and leant forward. Snape draped one arm over himself and turned his head so he could face his visitor.</p>
<p>Potter was more relaxed this time. He blinked normally. Snape examined the right eye. The dark spots appeared to be the same size as yesterday. Maybe Snape had imagined it after all.</p>
<p>Potter’s gaze was still determined, but also warm. Snape looked. The boy was so open and his gaze was getting warmer still. If Snape didn’t know any better, he would have called it kind. Not many people had ever looked at him like that. Snape swallowed, but kept on looking. He turned so he was now facing Potter. That way he could focus on both eyes. It would be so easy to let himself be swept up by that kind, green gaze, but he would not. He was only here to do Potter a service. Still, the eyes were so much like Lily’s, it was disconcerting. Snape looked, mesmerised by that warm, green gaze. He did not notice his arm falling to his lap, his hand opening. Only when he felt a prickle in his leg did he look down. His leg had fallen asleep. He quickly turned his head away and stared at the wall until he could hear Potter leave.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Potter came back daily after that and Snape found himself almost looking forwards to the evening visits, it was a welcome change from staring at the ceiling or reading the news. They barely spoke. Potter would walk in, somewhat unsteadily, they would proceed with the 'therapy' and he would leave again.</p>
<p>One evening, when he was expecting Potter, Smethwyck entered with a middle-aged woman. She had a stern face and was dressed in a white Healer’s robe. Smethwyck closed the curtains around Snape’s bed and cast a privacy spell around them. </p>
<p>“Mr. Snape?” He asked. “This is Claire Baker, head of the research department of this wing and currently working on Mr. Potter's case. She wants to talk to you.”</p>
<p>Snape raised an eyebrow and put his book aside. Baker shook his hand and drew back almost immediately. She dragged the chair towards her, as far away from him as possible, and sat down. Snape was intimately familiar with her kind. He narrowed his eyes and straightened his back as much as he was able, trying to look down his nose at her.</p>
<p>“I…” The woman gulped and looked away, seemingly at war with herself. After a few moments, she looked back at him with determination. “We need help.”</p>
<p>Snape regarded her blankly. Why she had gone through all the trouble to tell him this, he did not understand. “Indeed?”</p>
<p>Baker pursed her lips, giving her face an even sterner expression, and folded her hands tightly in her lap. “As you may know, we conduct magical research and brew our own medicines. However, with the recent increase of patients and the loss of many qualified brewers as a direct result of the war, we simply cannot meet the demand. I’m working days and nights on researching Mr. Potter’s unique predicament and do not have the time for brewing. Simply put: we are desperate for help.”</p>
<p>Snape was fairly certain he knew where this was heading and he did not like it one bit. “Are there no suppliers available?” He coughed and reached for his glass.</p>
<p>“There are,” Baker said stiffly when he had taken a sip, “but we don’t have the time nor the means to make sure their products meet our standards.”</p>
<p>Snape crossed his arms over his chest. “Why did you come here?”</p>
<p>Baker glared. “We need your help.”</p>
<p>“What for?”</p>
<p>“We need someone who can brew the basic potions our patients need, so that we can address the more time-consuming tasks.”</p>
<p>In summary, he would be the one to do all menial work. Snape scowled. They had to be really desperate to ask someone who could barely eat without assistance. “I am a patient here, Ms. Baker.”</p>
<p>“I know,” Baker said coolly. “Believe me, if there had been anyone else available, I would have never have asked a patient.”</p>
<p>Who is also a murderer and a Death Eater, she did not say. She didn’t need to. Snape could see it in her guarded expression, hear it in her clipped voice.</p>
<p>“However,” she continued, “you are a certified and reliable brewer, as I’ve understood from various sources. Loathe as I am to admit it, we are unable to do our job without help. And I cannot, will not, have patients suffer due to a lack of staff.”</p>
<p>Snape scowled. “I am not well enough to brew.” He coughed, to emphasise the point.</p>
<p>Baker snorted and nodded at Smethwyck. “I have your Healer's permission. You are well enough in the evenings.”</p>
<p>“She is correct,” Smethwyck said. “Bed rest isn't doing you any favours. A change of scenery and something to occupy your time will do you a world of good.”</p>
<p>So Smethwyck was talking about him behind his back. Hippocratic oath be damned. Snape glared. “I cannot leave the bed yet.” The words prompted a coughing fit.</p>
<p>“Hovering chairs exist, Mr. Snape." Baker informed him cheerfully. "Healer Smethwyck will direct you to our lab tomorrow evening. Good night.”</p>
<p>She stood up and walked away before Snape's coughing subsided.</p>
<p>Snape scowled at her swift exit. He snapped at Smethwyck and when Potter entered later, he sent him out of his room after just a few seconds of eye contact, ignoring his hurt stare.</p>
