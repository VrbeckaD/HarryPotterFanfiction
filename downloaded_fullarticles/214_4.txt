    <p align="justify">Over time, Albus Dumbledore had learnt that fooling oneself was hardly ever advantageous. Thus, the moment it became clear that Severus had failed to report back as agreed —rather than be merely late—, the old wizard did not attempt to ignore the nagging suspicion that prompted him to investigate the reason of such disappearance. And yet, he was well aware of the number of possibilities that would have prevented a spy from sending word without necessarily implying betrayal. He resolved to wait a couple of days, but nothing changed.</p><p align="justify">After conceiving something alike an escape plan in case the situation went awry, Albus Apparated in the desolated area of Cokeworth known as Spinner’s End. Not a light remained in the street, so there was no need for his Deluminator in the dead of the night. He allowed himself a pensive look round and, then, he marched without any further hesitation towards one of the decrepit little houses.</p><p align="justify">He had been there only once before, shortly after Severus had started spying for him. He had insisted on adding his own wards, so that the young man could be protected if he were ever discovered... and so that Albus could better control who entered the place. At the moment, when he approached the porch, he could not detect anything amiss with the protective spells. The likelihood that Severus was not home increased.</p><p align="justify">He muttered the appropriate counter-charms and stepped into the property. A wandless <em>Alohomora</em> opened the front door and granted him access. The shabby interior reflected the sorry state of the entire building. Once again, he wondered how someone as proud as a Prince had ended up her days in that sad little corner of the world. And, not for the first time, either, Albus thought whether the Hogwarts faculty could have done more to avoid seeing their own students, just fresh out of school, joining Tom.</p><p align="justify">Turning away from those fruitless thoughts, he crossed the hall. Everything was covered by a dense layer of dust as well as surrounded by stale air, but numerous footprints betrayed its apparent abandonment. He stepped through the only door to his right, leading into the living room. There were a few bookcases that looked somewhat better kept than the inherited threadbare furniture. He perused the book collection, finding concealing charms on some of the darkest volumes. It was nothing unexpected and Albus crossed the door leading to the kitchen. Some empty food boxes and dirty bowls on the old wooden table confirmed someone had been there, but not when. He stopped, straining to hear something other than deadly silence, but it seemed like he was truly alone in the house. Undoubtedly, Severus would have sensed the wards letting him through if he had been inside and so, Albus’s mind reeled with possible scenarios.</p><p align="justify">He tried to think objectively whether it was more likely that he had been double-crossed or that the dark-haired man had encountered trouble. Love was a powerful reason to walk the hard path of self-betterment, but the Headmaster doubted the commitment that such a selfish love could bring. He was afraid that, if Voldemort open acceptance and acknowledgement had worked once, it could happen again. And, even though Severus did not know everything that happened in the Order —no one did, except perhaps for its leader—, he had still learnt information that Tom would find extremely interesting. On the other hand, if they had uncovered his role in Peter Pettigrew’s arrest, his young spy was dead. However, there was no one who could have disclosed this piece of information, since not even other Order members knew that Severus had been the one to reveal Peter as a Death Eater. It was one of the many precautions Albus had taken, as well as keeping Severus’s change of heart a secret.</p><p align="justify">Neither option was particularly pleasant and the old wizard strode out of the kitchen, forsaking for a moment his usual calm demeanour and returning to the hall. He was tempted to finish his search at that point, but he considered that he might find a clue about his former pupil’s disappearance in one of the upper rooms. Slightly sceptical, he started to climb up the stairs, ignoring the constant creaking under his boots. If there was anyone waiting to ambush him inside the house, they would have heard the front door screech earlier.</p><p align="justify">The first door on the first floor led to what looked like a child’s bedroom. It was bare but for a small single bed and a wardrobe. The bedcovers sported faded colours and several little holes, likely eaten by moths. Yet, they were rumpled at the foot of the bed, as if someone still slept there. Suddenly, Albus froze as his senses put him on full alert. He could clearly feel another magical presence in the room. Very slowly, he looked around, seeing no one. A discreet non-verbal spell was enough to show that a person was hiding in the wardrobe, though, and he readied his wand. Even so, there was no fear in his stance —the furniture was hardly an ideal location from which an adult could attack and any competent wizard or witch would have chosen to face Albus earlier and try to escape.</p><p align="justify">With another wave of his wand, the wardrobe doors burst open, revealing nothing at first. Then, there was movement at the back and he cast a <em>Lumos</em> to scatter the shadows. A sharp intake of breath followed and he came closer, bending over to take a better look. A young child was curled up in a ball at the bottom of the wardrobe, barely daring peek up between his fingers. Black strands of hair covered his face, but Albus could distinguish plain terror in his equally black eyes.</p><p align="justify">Of all scenarios he had envisioned, coming face to face with a much younger Severus Snape had never crossed his mind. Even in the semi-darkness, his striking features were distinctive enough that there should not be doubt about his identity. In truth, there were only two possibilities: either the child was really young Severus —regressed in body and mind to a time where they had not met yet— or it was a trap set by Tom to infiltrate one of his own followers among the Order. After a few seconds in deep thought, the Headmaster decided to act as he would with an unknown child in order to attempt to shed light on the situation.</p><p align="justify">“Hello?” he whispered softly.</p><p align="justify">There was no answer and the child seemed to tighten his hold on his knees.</p><p align="justify">“What are you doing here, little one?” He was met with silence once again, but Albus thought the young eyes were currently staring at him with a hint of contempt. It had indeed been a familiar emotion for Severus throughout his school years and it relaxed the old wizard. He tried a different approach. “Allow me to guess, you are about six years old?” he asked, reckoning he had missed the mark by a year or two.</p><p align="justify">Effectively, the boy uncurled a little, outrage running through his small body.</p><p align="justify">“I’m eight!”</p><p align="justify">Albus nodded, straightening up. He left plenty of room for Severus to get out.</p><p align="justify">“I am afraid that is still much too young to be on your own. Why don’t you come out and we see what can be done about it?”</p><p align="justify">The boy remained where he was, eyeing him warily. His ‘grandpa voice,’ as Minerva called it, usually managed to make him look completely trustworthy —then again, Severus had never had the easiest time putting his trust in anybody. He waited patiently for the child to make up his mind or say something else.</p><p align="justify">“Are you a wizard?” he finally chose to ask in a whisper.</p><p align="justify">“I am,” answered Albus pleasantly. “My name is Albus Dumbledore. I am the He—”</p><p align="justify">“I know! You’re the Headmaster at Hogwarts. My mum told me about it.”</p><p align="justify">Losing his grip on his knees completely, he assessed the old man with his characteristic intent gaze, as if that bit of information changed everything. Albus did not react to the interruption and, instead, focused on the child’s obvious enthusiasm.</p><p align="justify">“That is correct. Would you like to come out and tell me how you ended up here by yourself?”</p><p align="justify">At some point during the conversation, he had rejected the idea that the situation could be a trap. The boy was acting just like any scared eight-year-old would in such bizarre circumstances. Yet, no one who had met Severus later in life would have dreamt of impersonating him in such a candid way. Severus himself would have come clean about what had happened, embarrassing as it could have been, rather than expose his fears so freely.</p><p align="justify">Reluctantly, the child jumped out of the wardrobe and, in the glow of the wand-lighting charm, Albus could see the deplorable state he was in. Thin as a rail, he was also visibly dirty and sporting two ugly bruises —one around his neck and another one on his left cheek. The Headmaster could not help it when a slight frown showed up on his face. He had known that Severus’s home life had been far from ideal, but he had not been aware of the extent to which that was an understatement. The boy seemed to become self-conscious at the thorough examination conducted by pale blue eyes and looked down at the floor, fidgeting with his hands nervously.</p><p align="justify">“Would you care for a sweet?” Albus offered, producing several Muggle boiled sweets he always carried with him. He hoped to put the child at ease, although adult Severus had never indulged in such things in front of him.</p><p align="justify">Young Severus looked at the palm of his hand avidly, but did not make a move to take anything. Little by little, distrust filled his dark eyes again.</p><p align="justify">“Where are my parents?”</p><p align="justify">“Regretfully, I cannot answer that,” explained Albus, not once losing his perky tone. “Suffice it to say that they are unavailable for the moment. Now, child, what is the last thing you remember?”</p><p align="justify">Severus’s gaze went from his outstretched hand to his clear blue eyes a couple of times before offering any reply.</p><p align="justify">“Dunno. I just woke up and the house was different.”</p><p align="justify">“You may take one.” However, his insistence achieved the opposite goal, making the boy withdraw further. Biting back a sigh, the Headmaster returned the tasty sweets to his pocket.</p><p align="justify">“Where did you wake up?”</p><p align="justify">He was not an easy man to surprise, but the unwavering dark gaze did not suit its starving, childish frame. In any case, his silent wait was eventually rewarded with a curt question.</p><p align="justify">“Why d’you wanna know?”</p><p align="justify">“Perhaps we’ll find a clue that will help us understand what happened,” he answered truthfully.</p><p align="justify">After another quiet deliberation with himself, the boy nodded —albeit grudgingly. He led the older wizard downstairs, back to the dark hall. There, he opened a concealed door that hid another set of stairs.</p><p align="justify">“I woke up in the cellar,” Severus muttered. He had his eyes fixed on the darkness below them.</p><p align="justify">“It must have been quite a frightening experience,” Albus said, strengthening his lighting charm and starting to descend the stairs. The boy followed him without a word.</p><p align="justify">The cellar was covered by shelves filled with glass jars and old books. He could sense the heavy feeling of dark magic in the room and he guessed it was in there where Severus brewed the potions requested by Lord Voldemort. When his young spy had confessed that his role as a Death Eater involved this type of brewing, his voice had held a hint of haughtiness, as if he were trying very hard to convey how unapologetic he felt about it. His younger version, however, looked very anxious, giving the impression of wishing to be anywhere but in the cellar. Albus looked down at him, lifting a single white eyebrow, which seemed to obtain better results than asking actual questions.</p><p align="justify">“Mum’s never got so many things lying round. I wanted to clean it up, but she doesn’t let me touch her potions.”</p><p align="justify">Albus ignored the boy’s worries —utterly irrelevant at the time— and came closer to the cauldron he had failed to notice right away. Fortunately, the fire under it had been extinguished, although the semi-solid mass inside did not look very useful any more. He was no expert in the subject, but he collected a sample nevertheless to see whether he could find out Severus’s latest project through Horace.</p><p align="justify">“You never shared who you or your mother might be, child,” Albus commented offhandedly as he put the glass vial in another pocket. As he had intended, the boy looked bewildered by the sudden change of subject. Thus, it did not take as long to have an answer that time.</p><p align="justify">“Severus Snape. Sir.” The honorific was added belatedly, as if on second thoughts. However, there was no longer defiance in his young expression. He might have understood that he would not be allowed to remain in his home unsupervised. “My mum’s a witch. Before marrying my dad, her name was Eileen Prince.”</p><p align="justify">Albus pretended to be considering that information. It was not going to be easy to choose a suitable placement where he could leave the child while a solution was found. Severus was eight years old and utterly vulnerable in his current circumstances. He needed someone who would be willing to look past his joining the Dark Lord —and so, willing to protect him. Who would step up and take on such a task, though? No one knew about his role as a spy for the Order, only about his allegiance as a Death Eater. No one even knew about his greatest sin or his greatest accomplishment, either. And yet, only the former needed to remain a secret.</p><p align="justify">A plan started to take shape in Albus’s sharp mind.</p><p align="justify">“Well, Severus, I know of a nice couple that would not mind taking you in while this situation clears up.”</p><p align="justify">The boy did not bother to hide his apprehension and the old man’s smiles proved to be useless to set his mind at rest. Alas, it could not be helped. There was only one safe place for young Severus with the war raging on. It was very fortunate, indeed, that they had agreed to choose Albus as their Secret Keeper after learning of Pettigrew’s betrayal. This way, paying them a visit would be easy enough.</p>
