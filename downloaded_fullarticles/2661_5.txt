  <em>
    <span>Hermione</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>For all the reading she had done about Hogwarts Hermione was nervous as she waited to enter the Great Hall for the first time with all her fellow first years. Neville was beside her, he seemed nice, she’d met him on the train earlier, and he soothed her nerves more than she cared to let on. She had vowed then that she would do her best to keep him as a friend over the years, she could do with kind friends. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The black haired boy and the ginger one were up ahead on the stairs, she hoped that she could keep away from them as much as possible… especially that ginger one, she didn’t know what it was about him, but he made all the short hairs on the back of her neck raise up and all she wanted to do was roll her eyes at him over and over again. Her eyes found the silver blonde hair of another boy, and there was a flutter in her stomach, his hair was beautiful, the way it caught and reflected the light. He was stood tall, holding himself so upright it looked like he had a rod up his back. He looked proud of himself, he probably was. That didn’t stop Hermione from wanting to get closer to him. She gently pushed her way closer. She heard him introduce himself to the other two boys, Draco Malfoy… that was going to be a name she just knew she would remember. Latin for Dragon, hopefully, he wasn’t as fierce as the creatures he was named after. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Before she could get any closer they were ushered into the Great Hall to be sorted in front of the others, they were guided into the Great Hall and up the front as Professor McGonagall placed a stool and an old hat in front of them. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She half-walked, half-skipped to the Gryffindor table when she was sorted. Surrounded by a sea of black, red and gold she watched for the four boys she had met to be sorted. Her heart soared when Neville was sorted into Gryffindor with her, she hugged him close to her as he joined her at their new house table. By the end of the sorting Malfoy had been placed into Slytherin, which made him grin like a Cheshire cat as he strutted his way over to his house table. Hermione’s heart sank, even she had heard about the rivalry between Gryffindor and Slytherin and knew that meant it didn’t matter how she felt about the Malfoy boy nothing could happen now. The black haired boy and the ginger one were both sorted into Gryffindor too, much to Hermione’s dismay. The ginger one was hugged by three older ginger boys… probably some relations of his Hermione thought. </span>
</p>

  <em>
    <span>Draco</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco knew he’d be in Slytherin, he couldn’t help but grin at the fact the hat took such a short amount of time to come to that conclusion. He didn’t even think that Professor McGonagall had even put that hat on his head properly before it roared out “SLYTHERIN” to the rest of the student body. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>His eyes roamed around the room as he stood up before he moved towards his table. That was when he saw her. She was sat there at the Gryffindor table, her bushy brown hair was a cloud around of her head. She was looking down at the table, but she seemed sad for some reason. All Draco knew was he had a knot form in his stomach and an aching need to see that sadness disappear. He would do everything he could too or everything in his power. Even though she was a Gryffindor, and he was a Slytherin. He’d never felt like this, never expected to. And he never wanted to feel like it again, if he could help it. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Later on that night, in the Slytherin dungeons Draco still couldn’t take his mind off the girl. Hermione Granger. That was a nice name, to suit a nice-looking girl. He needed to stop thinking about her. Merlin knew what any of his fellow Slytherin’s would say if they found out his mind was on a girl, let alone a Gryffindor. He just couldn’t stop himself wanting to see her again, and often. However silly that sounded. </span>
