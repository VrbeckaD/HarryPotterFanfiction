    <p>“No.” </p>
<p>“Remy, please.”</p>
<p>Remus flinched at the nickname. “No. I said I don’t want to go.”</p>
<p>“And I don’t want to go alone, Remus. Please. I know that you don’t like crowds, and I asked Peter and he told me that it’s just going to be a couple of people. Lowkey, you know? That kind of party.” A pause. Then: “I just don’t want to go alone.”</p>
<p>Remus stared at Dorcas, his jaw moving to the left a little in uncertainty. His brain was turning out scenarios that all ended badly. The only good ending was the one where he stayed in the comforts of his own apartment. </p>
<p>But Dorcas was asking him, and as much as he hated parties and just about every other form of social interaction outside of his very small friend group, Remus didn’t want to make Dorcas go to a party alone when she was asking him to go with her. In fact, Remus didn’t think she had ever asked him anything of the sort, besides the first time they met, and that was because she didn’t know how hermit-like he was. (And he actually wouldn’t mind getting to meet this so called Peter that she had been raving to him about for the past couple of months. He just wished it was over tea or something.)</p>
<p>He avoided looking into her eyes and gave a defeated nod. “Fine. But I’m not drinking. I’ve class in the morning.”</p>
<p>Her face lit up in her apparent surprise. Remus thought for a split second that maybe Dorcas didn’t expect him to actually say yes that quickly, if at all. “Yeah! Yeah, no! Of course you don’t have to drink. Ooh, this is going to be so much fun! Thank you so much, Remus!” Dorcas gave Remus a squeeze and her face did that thing where it scrunched up just a little bit when she was excited about something. “It starts at seven tonight, but I don’t get off until seven-thirty, so we’ll be a little bit late-“ Remus tensed at the word late, so Dorcas put out her hands in what was supposed to be a calming gesture, almost like calming a wild dog. Remus did not like being late to anything and Dorcas knew that. He would much rather be anxiously early than fashionably late any day, thank you very much. “-but that’s how it is with parties, anyways, so it works out perfectly. I’ll come straight back here after and we’ll leave. Make sure you’re ready to go when I get here, Rem.” </p>
<p>“When am I not, love?” He answered back, trying to humor her. “Now go. Your shift starts in-“ Remus checked his phone. “-twenty eight minutes. Run.” </p>
<p>Dorcas only laughed and sauntered out of Remus’s apartment. The last thing he saw of her was her braided black hair trailing out the door before she shut it behind her. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>XXX</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Remus was ready a good hour before the party even started, and, true to her word, Dorcas showed back up at his apartment after her shift at the convenience store by her flat was over and done with. She wasn’t wearing the same pair of jeans and t-shirt that she was earlier, and she definitely wasn’t in work clothes. Remus figured that she brought an extra outfit with her and changed after her shift was done. (If Remus was thankful for anything that day, it was Dorcas’s careful planning.) She has on a pair of black ripped jeans that were so shredded you could see the pocket linings and a red off-the-shoulder blouse that really complemented her smooth, brown skin and faint traces of collar bones hidden behind baby fat that still desperately clung to her in some places. </p>
<p>She opened the door to his flat, yelled, “Get in loser, we’re going shopping!” before sauntering back out to her car, Remus following after her, only stopping to  lock his flat door and tell his fat cat bye. </p>
<p>“I thought you said we were going to a party.” Remus smiled and piled into her 2007 silver Honda Accord that she kept relatively clean. If you pressed your nose to the seats, you could still smell the cigarette smoke from the previous owner. </p>
<p>“Oh, shut up. I didn’t want to ruin the quote. It’s iconic.” Dorcas grinned at him. </p>
<p>“You say that every single time you pick me up, Dorcas.” </p>
<p>“Why are you calling me out like this? I thought you loved me.” She looked at Remus and back at the road with her hand over her heart as if hurt. </p>
<p>Remus only chuckled and Dorcas turned up the radio at a stop light. The drive to the party was filled with her singing along to whatever Hits 1 was playing, Remus humming to the few he recognized from his time spent with Dorcas. (Remus learned that she studied better with pop music playing softly in the background. She said it helped her remember the material during tests.) (Remus couldn’t study with music on, but he didn’t tell her that. He had some suspicions that Dorcas only studied when they studied together, so he let her play music without complaint if that’s what helped her.) </p>
<p>She turned onto a street with tall flat buildings on both sides that looked humongous and new and never had dripping pipe problems like what Remus’ flat had. She parked under a row on trees in front of a building marked E 218 and she and Remus undid their seat belts and got out. </p>
<p>“They’re the third floor. Let’s go.” Dorcas said and walked towards the glass doors with pretty white wood frames, shoes hardly making a sound on the pavement even though she was incredibly heavy-footed. </p>
<p>Remus did not mention how nice the building was. But he did, however, self-consciously pull on his jumper a little and fiddle with the bottom of it. (A bad habit he had ten years in the making.) He felt underdressed just gazing up at the building. He followed Dorcas inside and into the elevator that didn’t shudder when the doors closed like the one at Remus’ flat so often did. (The doors had once gotten stuck and he had a panic attack. The elevator only moved when someone on the floor two above him clicked the button to call for it. Needless to say, he takes the stairs now.) </p>
<p>Remus could hear the music already when the doors opened. Dorcas led him to the end of the hallway on their left and knocked on the door using the knocker. It swung open and revealed a guy Remus assumed was about his age. He quite possibly has the messiest hair that Remus had ever seen in his entire life. “Dorcas! Come on in. I think Peter’s on the couch.” The boy didn’t stand around long enough to give Remus his name, as there was loud cheering behind him and he looked over his shoulder before turning and running to the heart of the loud noise. </p>
<p>The party was, by no means, small. Remus wanted to throttle Dorcas and ask her how in God’s name she thought this counted as small. The front room was packed and Remus was willing to bet that it got more populated the further in you went. </p>
<p>“Remus?” He heard Dorcas say. She waved him inside. “Are you coming?” </p>
<p>He looked at her, met her eyes with a nervous smile that she mistook as genuine, then nodded and surged into the flat. He felt his fate for the evening seal with the click of the door shutting behind him. </p>
<p>There was no getting out of it now.</p>
