<p>Chapter One: Don't Look Now</p>
<p>Harry was totally bored, which was nothing new. It was Potions after all. But this class period seemed to be lagging more than usual. It didn't help that it was Monday. Mondays always seemed to be the longest days of the week, the clocks ticked by slower, the sun rose and set slower. The day was going by at an impossibly slow rate.</p>
<p>The class was split into groups of three,at the beginning of class. Harry partnered with Hermione and Neville while Professor Snape explained the potion they'd be making today. Harry paid absolutely no attention. It wasn't like he was going to be able to do anything anyway. Hermione was just going to take over the entire assignment while he and Neville sat there twiddling their thumbs for the entire hour.</p>
<p>It was hitting the half-hour mark when Harry looked behind him to see how Ron was getting on with his group. He was paired with Dean Thomas and one of the Slytherin boys, Crabbe Goyle. It seemed like Ron was having as much fun as he was.</p>
<p>Harry couldn't help but, let his mind wander to the DA. He had a week of lessons planned out, but he knew that the week would go by quicker than he wanted. He still couldn't believe he let Hermione talk him into this, the only upside was that people stopped looking at him as if he was about to snap.</p>
<p>"NEVILLE, NO" Hermione shrieked ,but it was too late….Neville already added in the wrong ingredient, just as Harry turn back around.</p>
<p>It happened in what seemed like slow-motion. Neville adding in the wrong ingredient, Harry turning back around just as the potion exploded into a puff of smoke,knocking Hermione and Neville off balance...Harry took the brunt of the explosive material.</p>
<p>Harry howled in pain as soon as the potion came into contact with his skin. His knees buckled,and he fell to the floor. The potion seeped into Harry's robes,causing damage to the cloth. Blisters started to appear on his arms. The air suddenly gave off a slightly rancid smell as the liquid did its damage. Writhing in pain,he flailed about in an attempt to get the liquid off him.</p>
<p>Hermione quickly froze him when she realized the gravity of the situation.</p>
<p>Snape was sat at his desk grading ,when the explosion happened. As soon as he realized what was going on and swiftly jumped into action. His black cloak billowing as he came into view. He quickly sent off a patronus.</p>
<p>"Tell Poppy we have a magical burn, with draught of living death, action will need to be taken immediately"</p>
<p>The silvery doe wisped away to deliver the message, causing students throughout the classroom to speak in hushed voices</p>
<p>"Silence,all of you...Malfoy,Nott that is enough. Mr Potter was seriously injured,this is no joking matter." The professor admonished</p>
<p>Severus pulled out his wand and quickly vanished the mess, not wanting anyone else to be injured. He then transfigured an unused desk into a stretcher and levitated Harry's still body onto it. "Granger, Weasley, come with me this instant. Longbottom you as well" Snape barked as he levitated Harry out and into the hall.</p>
<p>Severus ran with Harry, taking all the secret passages he knew from his days of trying to outrun James and his crew. If Harry died because of his class…he would never be able to serve his penance, he would never be able to salvage what little he thought was left of his broken soul. He had to save Lily's son...Whatever the cost.</p>
<p>Harry was in an unbelievable amount of pain. He imagined this was how the cruciatus curse felt. He wanted so desperately to cry out but was unable to.</p>
<p>The team made their way to the hospital wing. The only sound that could be heard was their breathing. As soon as they arrived,Severus gently laid Harry down onto the bed as Madame Pomfrey rushed over.</p>
<p>Professor Dumbledore had been notified of the incident immediately and upon hearing of the situation,left for the Hospital Wing. He arrived just as Harry was being brought in...his stomach dropped at the sight.</p>
<p>"Headmaster"Severus approached the old man,snapping him out of his trace. The matron looked at both men "Help me keep him still,so I can remove his clothing." Severus complied.</p>
<p>Hermione's eyes filled with tears. Resting her head into Ron's chest, she was trying not to loose it,to no avail. Seeing the person she saw as her big brother, in such pain, more than she could ever imagine,</p>
<p>"Can't you give him something?" Ron shouted over the commotion,as he wrapped his arms around Hermione and held her close.</p>
<p>Neville averted his eyes, unable to watch what was happening…..unable to watch what he had done.</p>
<p>Madam Pomfrey sighed as she carefully removed Harry's clothing, before summoning the strongest pain potion she had, and quickly administered it.</p>
<p>"Third-degree burns on the face, neck, shoulder, chest, and back," the Matron called out. She looked over the damage that was done. Harry whimpered softly..then went limp</p>
<p>Harry felt like he was floating on a cloud. There was no more pain...there was nothing. He couldn't move,couldn't even think. But he didn't mind as long as the pain was gone. Harry sluggishly turned to see his friends standing next to the bed but he was unable to call out to them.</p>
<p>Hermione slowly turned back around as soon as Harry screams stopped, tears running down her face as she took his hand in hers. " You're alright Harry, you going to be ok." Hermione spoke as she did her best to keep her tears to herself.</p>
<p>Neville was on the verge of tears. "I...I'm just as bad as Bellatrix" he whispered.</p>
<p>"Shhh, don't try to talk ,Harry," Hermione whispered gently,noticing that Harry was trying to move his mouth. "Try to relax," Hermione said running her hand through his hair,staying far away from the burns as Madame Pomfrey did her scans.</p>
<p>Harry was having an increasingly difficult time breathing,to a point where it was becoming noticeable.</p>
<p>"Harry!" Hermione cried in desperation. Ron gently pulled her from the scene,as the matron sat Harry up in attempts to alleviate the pressure off his lungs.</p>
<p>"You three need to leave,NOW" Madam said sternly.</p>
<p>"We're not leaving." Ron and Hermione said simultaneously.</p>
<p>Severus didn't realize the gravity of the situation this was, not until Madam Pomfrey removed Harry's shirt to reveal the burns and the respiratory distress he showed, frightened the Potions Master to no end.</p>
<p>"As much as I admire your loyalty to your friend,Harry would not want you to see him like this. Go back to class. I shall personally see that you receive updates as they come." The Headmaster said calmly</p>
<p>Hermione sighed before giving a small nod. She took Ron's hand and left the hospital wing;giving Harry one last glance,as Neville trailed behind.</p>
<p>Ron squeezed Hermione's hand as the doors to the infirmary were shut. "He'll be okay Mione..I know he will"</p>
