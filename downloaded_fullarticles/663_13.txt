  <p> </p>
</center><p>“Hermione.” </p><p><br/>
<br/>
Her name was spun sugar melting on his tongue.</p><p><br/>
<br/>
He heard the clatter of her feet; counting the steps that she took, and the ones that she didn’t, knowing how she counted and skipped every oddly numbered stair. She’d scrunched her nose when he’d asked why and flicked his cheek: “<em>Because they creak.” </em></p><p><br/>
<br/>
“<em>Do they?”</em></p><p><br/>
<br/>
Once, he’d dreamed of immortality; the world prostrating itself by his feet, and gold dripping from his hands. Now, this was his dream: having inane conversations with a little girl, something his followers had come to accept; if not believe, for once agreeing with Skeeter and the Daily Prophet (“Who <strong>was</strong> the Minister’s ward?”).</p><p><br/>
<br/>
“<em>Yes, they do, especially seven and nine</em>.” she’d nodded primly. “<em>You should fix them Tom; someone could get hurt - they sound like someone’s put a tripping charm on them.” </em></p><p><br/>
<br/>
Little Hermione; so, <em>caring</em> for others.</p><p><br/>
<br/>
“<em>I don’t want </em>you<em> to get hurt. Or anyone else,” </em>Hermione added, considering<em>. “Except Bellatrix. She can step on seven and nine.” </em> </p><p><br/>
<br/>
His lips quirked. </p><p><br/>
<br/>
“<em>And eleven and thirteen</em>?” he’d suggested, coiling one of her curls about his finger. He smirked as her gaze dropped, and hazel eyes darkened. She was predictable; a trait he found <em>terribly</em> precious, in her. “<em>Careful Hermione, someone might assume you cared for me.”</em></p><p><br/>
<br/>
“<em>But I do</em>.”</p><p><br/>
<br/>
Her head shook, and rolling eyes met his again. “<em>You’re not afraid of me, are you?</em>” Tom murmured softly. He was filled with equal longing to hold and caress her, as he was to Crucio her. Somehow, he’d never drawn his wand against her.</p><p><br/>
<br/>
His hands soothed the grooves of her shoulders instead; kneading her taut muscles.</p><p><br/>
<br/>
“<em>Why should I be?</em>” her lips pursed in a terribly haughty way (terribly <em>Hermione</em> way) and she replied matter-of-factly. “<em>You’re my friend</em>.”</p><p><br/>
<br/>
His smirk faltered then, as it did now.</p><p><br/>
<br/>
“Friend,” Tom scoffed. What they had between them was without need of a name; ever more than the <em>friendship </em>the Malfoys, Notts, and other pure-blooded families assumed to have with him. With<em> them</em>, if Tom allowed it.</p><p><br/>
<br/>
He didn’t.</p><p><br/>
<br/>
His fingers drummed against the brocade arm of the chair. She was <em>his</em> Hermione; with green and white ribbons streaming from her hair, and laughter spilling from her lips; a vision he was loath to share. And he was hers, as silly of a girl as she was.</p><p><br/>
<br/>
The girl in question came around the corner, her cheeks rosy, and mass of curls bouncing. “Tom!” she cried, throwing herself into his arms. He supported her nimble body easily; pretending to wince as her elbow smacked his ribs. “Are you going to show me-“</p><p><br/>
<br/>
“Ah, ah” he chided. “Manners.”</p><p><br/>
<br/>
He trailed his finger across her wrist, before resting it against her skin. “Was someone out of bed last night?”</p><p><br/>
<br/>
Her cheeks flushed brighter, as she situated in his lap.  “Sorry-“ Hermione had her back against his chest and tugged his arms around her waist. She’d never been able to lie, not well. Her earnestness made him laugh; his fingers caressing her side. “I couldn’t sleep last night and wanted- wanted something to read,” she hurried, tripping over her words. “I know you don’t like me in your rooms without you- but the door was open, so I…” her hair hung across the sides of her face as she looked down. “I saw the papers on your desk and read one-“</p><p><br/>
<br/>
“Just one?” he teased, both knowing her penchant for reading.  If he’d allowed her to attend Hogwarts (he assumed she would have been sorted into Ravenclaw, or horrid Gryffindor), she would have lived in the library; her face continually buried in a book. As it was, she devoured the books he gave her; rarely seen without one tucked under her arm, or open and beneath her head while she slept.</p><p><br/>
<br/>
“Three,” she amended. “I read your theory about wandless magic-“ she peeped back up at him; her wild curls tickling his chin. “Did you really conjure a patronus without a wand? In fourth year, Tom?”</p><p><br/>
<br/>
Tom smirked.</p><p><br/>
<br/>
“Mhm. A marvelously furious ape,” he drawled. “It swung from the chandeliers in the Great Hall before crashing down next to Dumbledore’s plate and stood on his back legs, beating his chest.” he chuckled. “Its roar shattered every glass in the hall.”</p><p><br/>
<br/>
“Really?” her brow furrowed. “I thought the Hall would have wards against things like that. Hogwarts: A History says that- “</p><p><br/>
<br/>
She stopped, feeling his chest shake.</p><p><br/>
<br/>
“Oh! You git!” she chided, and he rolled his eyes; an uncharacteristic thing for him to do. Still, she sounded utterly too much like Draco, except her mouth lacked the trademark Malfoy sneer. “You didn’t summon a patronus at all, did you?”</p><p><br/>
<br/>
His smile, one that showed the barest traces of teeth, widened. “Doubting me, Hermione?” he teased, a dark edge to his voice. “I did summon a patronus; a sweet, chattering mouse that wanted nothing more than to hide away in my pocket. Rather, I think, like you.”</p><p><br/>
<br/>
“I like spending time with Winky too,” she argued, ignoring his sneer. She’d adored their household elves; knitting them clothing (that they staunchly refused to wear) and countless socks, when they relented and wore them. “And Draco, though he set a newt free in my hair last time- he said my curls were like the underside of a decrepit log which makes no sense. How can my hair be like that?” she chewed on her bottom lip. “Theo and Blaise too. They’re nicer than Draco but-“ </p><p><br/>
<br/>
“Oh?”</p><p><br/>
<br/>
His brow rose. He hadn’t known she’d been spending time with the pure-blood boys; something that made his jaw tick. He didn’t pause to examine why.</p><p><br/>
<br/>
“Would you go to them, clutching Hogwarts: A History, and ask them to read it to you, pet? “</p><p><br/>
<br/>
“What? No!” her cheeks reddened; her emotions always displayed on her face. It was a pity, as she would have made a horrible Slytherin, Tom thought. They would have eaten her alive. “Tom-“</p><p><br/>
<br/>
“Would you curl next to them on their bed?” he continued smoothly. “Every time a thunderstorm rages outside, and lightning cracks outside the window?” It’d taken only once for him to know her fear; noting the way her hands burrowed in his shirt, and how she kept her gaze away from the window.</p><p><br/>
<br/>
Hermione huffed, blowing warm air against his collarbone. “It isn’t like that with them- you know that Tom,” she insisted. “They’re my friends, and you’re - you’re you, Tom. I like it when <em>you </em>read it to me.”</p><p><br/>
<br/>
“Hm.” Tom studied her; his tone airy, looking rather like the cat that’d caught a canary. “Lucius?”</p><p><br/>
<br/>
Relaxing against him, she giggled at the thought. “A muggle-born? Asking Lucius to read to them? I think he’d rather kiss a house-elf!” Tom grimaced, feeling vaguely ill at the idea of anyone kissing a house-elf - knowing that Hermione hugged Winky (and Dobby when they visited the Malfoy household) was enough.</p><p><br/>
<br/>
And her ideas regarding starting <em>S.P.E.W.</em> -</p><p><br/>
<br/>
He’d rather thought she was joking; after she stormed into the library and searched the shelves for a book regarding the rights of house elves, after seeing Dobby ironing his ears (a creative, if rather vulgar punishment created by Lucius) and had been outraged to find none. The next day, he’d found his office filled with buttons and posters for S.P.E.W. and found himself invited to be the first member.</p><p><br/>
<br/>
An invitation, he’d bemusedly accepted.</p><p><br/>
<br/>
“He would, you know, Lucius.” he murmured, resting his cheek against the top of her head. The Malfoys knew well enough that his ward (‘What a precocious girl,” Narcissa cooed, as Hermione invited her to join S.P.E.W.; an invitation she’d graciously accepted) was allowed in their precious library - the whole of their gardens where she read by the babbling fountain - and any room that she wanted, down to the depths of their dungeons where she explored hand-in-hand with Dobby, and the kitchens where the other house-elves gave her petit fours and anything else she asked for. “The Malfoys are a terribly loyal family.”</p><p><br/>
<br/>
Amusement was stark in his tone; both knowing how afraid the Malfoys, and other pureblood families were of Tom. He’d made his mark during his school years; his mark burned on to the arm of many heirs. His dabble in the Dark Arts had proved fruitful; though he’d stopped his pursuit of horcruxes after the first, when he’d keenly felt something <em>lacking</em>; as if the magic he’d mastered, thought to master <em>him</em> in turn.</p><p><br/>
<br/>
What was the use of immortality if he were a slave to insanity?</p><p><br/>
<br/>
No, he’d decided, horcruxes wouldn’t do at all.</p><p><br/>
<br/>
He’d kept his Knights and his mark; Death Eaters prolific throughout society. They’d placed themselves where he’d suggested; in the Treasury and various, influential positions in the Ministry, allowing his voice to filter through wizarding world. Tom had quickly risen among the political ranks; becoming an influential, powerful man; one originally without official title, and sponsored by the obscenely rich Malfoys. Now, as the Minister for Magic, he was undeniably and ghastly important.</p><p>Twisting in his hold, Hermione tapped his nose. “They’re loyal to you Tom, but you’re loyal to me.”</p><p><br/>
<br/>
“Am I?” his brow rose.</p><p><br/>
<br/>
“Yes,” she nodded, her curls springing. “I think I may be the only one you’re loyal to,” She thought, her brow furrowing. Her earnestness made him smile; certain she would have been sorted into Gryffindor. “Just as you know I’m loyal to you, more than any other.”</p><p><br/>
<br/>
“Why is that?” Tom asked, resting his hand against the small of her back.</p><p><br/>
<br/>
“Besides you adopting me as your ward, despite being muggle-born?” Hermione replied, “Though I cast better charms than Draco or Blaise can, I don’t know why you adopted me; I would have aged out eventually. I’m thankful for that, and your library; I couldn’t dislike you with the library you have.” she teased, fluttering her eyelashes. He chuckled, knowing she was imitating Bellatrix; one of his followers he held at a chilly arm’s length. “You’ve taught me more than anyone could and listen when I recite from A Hogwarts’s History. You’re intelligent, Tom.” she tapped his nose. “You listen, and you’re well - you’re you, Tom. I like you.”</p><p><br/>
<br/>
“So eloquent,” he laughed, ignoring the warmth in his chest. It was the same as when he’d met her; on one of his necessary tours to an orphanage similar to the one he’d grown up in, before his invitation to Hogwarts came. His life had changed as the heir of Slytherin; his importance established. It’d lasted through post-graduation, where he’d spread his influence over the Ministry until he held Kingsley’s ear. Still, Kingsley had faltered on the latest bill; one the old families wanted pushed through, and Tom had toyed with the idea of opposing him publicly; beginning with cultivating his own image of good will. He was the boy from an orphanage turned powerful heir; prompting him to tour the sole orphanage of the wizarding world; one that housed half-bloods and muggle born. And toured the ammonia-soaked facility he had; walking past children in their beds, until magic had tangled around his; tiny, lapping flames embracing the roaring flames of his magic. He’d jerked; shocked at the feeling.</p><p><br/>
<br/>
<em>Nothing</em> penetrated the shields around him.</p><p><br/>
<br/>
But she had.</p><p><br/>
<br/>
Hermione, his curious, sweet girl.</p><p><br/>
<br/>
She was a toddler; one left in her crib and ignored by the others. He’d stalked to her crib and looked down at her sleeping form; before her eyes had opened, and honeyed irises had met his. He couldn’t remember the last time someone else had looked him in the eyes; not without fear, or reservation. She was a child, a simple child yet - She was brimming with magic; power crackling about her, and him as he reached down to stroke her cheek.</p><p><br/>
<br/>
She’d raised her hand, her slim fingers curling about his wrist.</p><p><br/>
<br/>
Warmth crept beneath his skin; trickling into his veins the feeling the same as when he’d first tried fire whiskey (stolen from his Uncle’s locked cabinet). It was warmth that made him shiver, and his heart beat faster. It was warmth that welcomed him; warmth that urged him closer to the crib, until he leaned his face down towards hers; and she laughed in wonder.</p><p><br/>
<br/>
As if she wanted him near.</p><p><br/>
<br/>
<em>why?</em>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
“Curious, little girl.” Tom murmured; impossibly, his finger entwining about hers. “One day, the world will fear you too.”</p><p><br/>
<br/>
He’d taken her as his own ward; choosing to raise her himself. It was Tom who taught Hermione her first words (‘T-Tom’ she’d babbled. ‘Tom!’) and watched her toddle toward him, before grabbing ahold of his offered hand. He was the first one she saw as he took her from her bed (instead of having her locked away in an undersized crib), cleaning and dressing her before feeding her by hand, and the last one she saw as he tucked her into bed, crooning to her in parseltongue, while she made noises back at him. </p><p><br/>
<br/>
He’d waved the house elves away after one had made her burst into tears (she’d never seen one before; her eyes widening, before she’d whimpered as it reached for her); and warded her room from them for weeks, before they’d begged him for forgiveness.  He’d been keen to cast the Crucio before Hermione had wobbled into the room, hearing the sounds; and babbled at the elf, before plopping on the ground. The elf had played patty cake with her, and Tom -</p><p><br/>
<br/>
He hadn’t cast Crucio after all.</p><p><br/>
<br/>
Hermione had lived knowing only him, her hand searching for his alone, her lips crooking, and pink tongue exposed as she laughed at things he said, that only she knew he meant as jokes. She was utterly unafraid of him; his followers marveling at the sight of her teasing him during dinner and interrupting him with facts he’d gotten wrong. He never raised a hand toward her; merely inclining his head, and a smile tugging at his lips as he listened, before commenting on what she’d said, or wrapped his arm about her waist and pulled her against his side.</p><p><br/>
<br/>
No one knew him as she did, and no one would. He kept the society women at arm’s length, the same as Bellatrix, despite their offers to ‘mother’ Hermione while clinging to his arm. He had no interest in others, the only nightly company he had was when Hermione slipped into his bed; her cheeks damp with tears. She had nightmares; simple legilimency showing him impossible dreams of him dying and leaving her behind.</p><p><br/>
<br/>
‘<em>We’ll live forever</em>,’ he whispered. ‘<em>Together, forever</em>.’</p><p><br/>
<br/>
‘<em>Together</em>,’ she echoed, tucking his hand against her chest; where he felt her pulse beat beneath his palm.  </p><p><br/>
<br/>
As she came of age, he would share the entirety of his world with her. Sweet, fiery Hermione would find that they were entangled; their magic weaved into one so thoroughly it couldn’t be undone.</p><p><br/>
<br/>
For now, he enjoyed her youth, and her innocence. She raised her hand, silently casting a spell: butterflies fluttered around them, their wings tickling his hair before they faded away. He was pleased she’d been practicing wandless magic, though he knew she was demonstrating for a reason.</p><p><br/>
<br/>
“What do you want, Hermione?” he murmured softly.</p><p><br/>
<br/>
Hermione yawned, resting her head against his shoulder. She often fell asleep while in his hold; listening to the radio, a muggle invention he allowed to hide just out of sight. “Will you read to me, Tom?” she asked, readjusting in his lap to face forward. “Please?”</p><p><br/>
<br/>
He smiled; a crooked, genuine twitch of his lips. His poppet was a genuine sort; perhaps the only one who had no fear of him. Certainly, she was the only one asking him, Tom Riddle, Minister for Magic, to<em> read</em> to them. Silently he raised his hand; a heavy tome flying into it.</p><p><br/>
<br/>
Hermione clapped her hands together, realizing what it was.</p><p><br/>
<br/>
“Oh! Can we start at the beginning? This is my- “</p><p><br/>
<br/>
“Favorite muggle story,” he finished, laying the open book in her lap. Illustrations danced on the page; a charcoal drawing of a boy with a bowl in-hand, begging for more, coming to life alongside a hastily scribbled, yawning cat. “Out of thousands and thousands. Did you think I’d forget?” he mused.</p><p><br/>
<br/>
“No,” she replied, her fingers trailing beneath the printed words. The pages were still pristine, despite its age; he’d always taken perfect care of his things. “I <em>know </em>your memory is flawless,” she emphasized the word. “The Daily Prophet says so too.”  </p><p><br/>
<br/>
His brow cocked. He should have known she read the paper; despite her vehemence for Skeeter, after she’d splashed a picture of them across the front (one taken when he’d brought her to Diagon Alley for the first time; pure joy on her face as she’d tugged on his hand, wanting him to hurry with her to Ollivander’s.) and refused to make a retraction. “It scares people.” Hermione added, kicking her legs. “Unsettles them, really; like when I told Theo that I read through a tome in a night that took him weeks to. He wouldn’t listen to me when I <em>told </em>him it was easy; he wouldn’t listen at <em>all</em>,” She pouted, irritation flitting across her face. “I doubt he understands it.”</p><p><br/>
<br/>
“Does it?” Tom nuzzled the back of her head. “I can’t imagine why.” She snorted; and he knew she was smiling, hearing the sarcasm in his tone. They were the same; both talented <em>with</em> magic, and not because of it. They thirsted for knowledge and relentlessly pursued it. It was a thirst he’d recognized as she’d aged, and why he chose to teach her himself. She flourished as she poured over his books and papers, trusting him without thought as he adjusted her wrist and whispered instructions into her ear. He taught her without limits and forced morality.</p><p><br/>
<br/>
He taught her to be free.</p><p><br/>
<br/>
And she? Impossibly, she taught him things; how laughter felt when it bubbled in his chest, before climbing up his throat and poured warmly from his lips when she cast her own patronus; a fluffy, baby otter that squeaked and bounded about the room, causing his own patronus; a svelte, haughty panther to give chase. How her fingers felt when entwined in his, and her head rested against his shoulder. And how it felt to have someone trust him without conditions; wanting nothing more from him than his trust in turn. His fingers joined hers, following the words across the page, and he soon whispered the words: “Oh, you must not talk about dying yet…”</p><p><br/>
<br/>
He kept his chin atop her head, horribly content. </p><p><br/>
<br/>
He’d never been one to share his things, not when he could have them entirely to himself.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>
