  <u>1989</u>
</p>
<p>The stars in the bewitched sky glittered dramatically, like everything else to do with Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore. The ageing headmaster sat merrily at the head of the high table, taking a sip from his already filled goblet of wine surveying the students below him. The first years stood clustered nervously at the bottom of the steps, eyes darting around, trying to take everything. His twinkling gaze moved toward the Gryfindor table, students clad in red and gold, chatting loudly. A smile stretched across his wrinkled mouth as his eyes rested on Charlie Weasley, a sixth year and Quidditch captain, looking for his siblings. His stare was soon directed towards the Slytherin table where with relief he witnessed talk and laughter, albeit it was quiet and collected. The Hufflepuffs were busy exchanging stories, , not a single unhappy face on the table of yellow and black. The Ravenclaws poured over books, exchanged facts and friendly quizes, or god forbid finishing up on their summer homework. And the teachers of course making bets discreetly up and down the table. </p>
<p> "Davies, Roger"</p>
<p>A tall young lad stepped forward nervously and put the hat on.</p>
<p>The wizened wizard turned to the Astronomy teacher - Sirius Black - who was taking the bets and murmured "Seeker", the marauder grinned and as both Professor McGonagall and Professor Flitwick challenged against the idea.</p>
<p>"Ravenclaw!"</p>
<p>The small charms master clapped loudly.</p>
<p>"Diggory, Cedric"</p>
<p>Dumbledore smiled remembering his parents from their school years.</p>
<p>"Hufflepuff!"</p>
<p>Pomona giggled, "So like his mother".</p>
<p>"Greengrass, Daphne"</p>
<p>The pureblood swept forward with carefully concealed emotions, yet if one looked into her eyes they would find excitement.</p>
<p>"Slytherin!"</p>
<p>The table burst into calm claps.</p>
<p>"Johnson, Angelina"</p>
<p>The excitable girl hurried forward and hopped upon the stool, the hat immediately shouting</p>
<p>"Gryffindor!"</p>
<p>She laughed, grinning brightly, and joined the students of red and gold.</p>
<p>"Jordan, Lee"</p>
<p>A small boy with dreadlocks stepped forwards with a smirk</p>
<p>"Gryffindor!"</p>
<p>He jumped down with a mischevious grin.</p>
<p>"Montauge, Austin"</p>
<p>A tanned, tall kid stepped forwards.</p>
<p>"Slytherin!"</p>
<p>The tall kid jumped down with a smirk.</p>
<p>"Nott, Theodore"</p>
<p>Some teachers tensed, watching the young lad suspiciously.  Yet the tension eased when they saw he was nothing like his fat, middle aged father.</p>
<p>"Slytherin!"</p>
<p>He let a small smile cross his lips before departing for the snakes, sliding into a seat.</p>
<p>"Potter Harlan"</p>
<p>The said boy grimaced momentarily before taking a seat upon the stool, he sat with his back straight and head held high, almost regal. A few murmurs followed his name, his step mother well known for her role as godmother to the boy-who-lived and his father known as Lord Potter.</p>
<p>"Slytherin!"</p>
<p>The table of green raised their eyebrows, some looked amused, others looked a mixture of confusion and irritation. Most forget his mother wasn't Rubella Foskey, a posh muggleborn witch that gave birth to his younger siblings. He moved without hesitation, sliding into a seat at the end of the table, leaving a small gap between himself and the other first years. Albus watched as Theodore Nott rolled his eyes and slid down next to him, a faint smile grew on the eldest Potter's lips.</p>
<p>"Pucey, Adrian"</p>
<p>A rather unusually muscular first year pulled the hat on, everyone could see he would be an excellent keeper or beater.</p>
<p>"Slytherin!"</p>
<p>He grinned and jumped down, fist bumping Austin Montauge as he sat down.</p>
<p>"Spinnet, Alicia" </p>
<p>The old headmaster zoned out, gently unsticking a sherbet lemon underneath the table, ignoring his colleagues disapproving glares. He saw the Lions cheer out of his peripheral vision yet his mind was on something else. Already the ministry were planing for the Tri-Wizard tournament in six years. They wanted to follow traditional ways of making the tasks really dangerous but this time putting an age restriction on so nobody died. However, an idea had just formed in his head.</p>
<p>" Weasley, Fred"</p>
<p>The multiple groans that echoed from the teachers jerked him back to reality as the last three students were sorted. A grinning red head bounded up towars the hat, his eyes twinkling mischievously and he held the same look that was nearly always plastered on James Potter and Sirus Black when they were kids.</p>
<p>"Gryffindor!"</p>
<p>Albus held back a chuckle as his identical twin brother joined him in the house of lions and Professor Sinstra looked close to crying.</p>
<p>"Wright, Kenneth"</p>
<p>A smug pureblood swaggered forwards, obviously proud of being last, and placed the hat elegantly on his gelled blonde hair.</p>
<p>"Ravenclaw!"</p>
<p>The boys smirk grew even bigger and his swagger became even more prominent. Filius Flitwick did not look pleased.</p>

  <u>1990</u>
</p>
<p>Excitement radiated off everyone - minus the Slytherins because they're awesome - even the teachers. This was the year the Boy-Who-Lived came to Hogwarts!</p>
<p>Neville Longbottom grimaced, his hazel eyes almost glaring at the fan girls. Beside him his best friends, Draco, Blaise, Luna and Maddy snickered. </p>
<p>"You sure we aren't allowed to hex anyone? By lion! They are so annoying"</p>
<p>He groaned, whispering, hoping Mcgonagall would hurry up. Madeline "Maddy" Vulchanova rolled her eyes yet felt a pang of sympathy for her friend. Draco Malfoy however, didn't feel the same.</p>
<p>"Watch how you talk Marcus!"</p>
<p>He snapped before freezing and glancing around, Blaise Zabini smirked.</p>
<p>"You were saying Draco?"</p>
<p>Before the frustrated blonde could reply they were being lead into the hall. These five students were very good actors however even they couldn't suppress the flicker of boredom that crossed their faces as everyone else slowed down to stare at the ceiling. They shared an exasperated look.</p>
<p>"Longbottom, Neville"</p>
<p>They all jumped, having zoned out completely as their friends name was called. He rolled his eyes as gasps echoed around the chamber and slid the hat on.</p>
<p>"Gryffindor!"</p>
<p>Yet again he rolled his eyes and murmured "that was anticlimactic" as he passed his friends.</p>
<p>"Lovegood, Luna"</p>
<p>They smiled after her already knowing where she would go.</p>
<p>"Ravenclaw!"</p>
<p>They grinned and clapped as she floated away.</p>
<p>"Malfoy, Draco"</p>
<p>The young pureblood -who-simply-couldn't-be-bothered-with-the-mask-his-father-taught-him walked forward with a small smile.</p>
<p>"Ravenclaw!"</p>
<p>He looked completely unfazed with the shocked whispers heading his way and grinned joining the seer.</p>
<p>"Vulchanova, Madeline"</p>
<p>Her brother, Dominic, whooped comically from the Hufflepuff table making even the teachers laugh.</p>
<p>"Gryffindor!"</p>
<p>She smirked watching Cedric Diggory hand Dominic five galleons.</p>
<p>"Zabini, Blaise"</p>
<p>The son of a prestigious neutral family - his father remarried - walked confidently yet calmly up the steps with no arrogance unlike the year before and placed the hat on.</p>
<p>"Slytherin!"</p>
<p>He quickly joined his older sister Roxanne at the snake table.</p>

  <u> 1991</u>
</p>
<p>The sorting passed in a blur for the group of third years sat at the Slytherin table, quietly commentating with lots of eye rolls and "predicable's". Their interest was spiked halfway through with the name</p>
<p>"Granger, Hermione"</p>
<p>They knew to be the muggleborn best friend of Scarlet Potter and Ginny Weasley.</p>
<p>"Gryffindor!"</p>
<p>They shared exasperated looks watching her as she begged the hat, her face lighting up in glee as he yelled out the house.</p>
<p>"Potter, Cecil"</p>
<p>Slytherin robes straightened as he watched his brother wander up to the stool, unlike their youngest sister he Cecil had no care for fame - only pranks.</p>
<p>"Ravenclaw!"</p>
<p>Harry snickered watching McGonagalls face fall in disappointment for the second time, with a slight smirk he turned to Theodore Nott and muttered "3 galleons please"</p>
<p>"Prince, Quinton"</p>
<p>Only the Slytherins knew that the boy walking up was Severus Snape's son, Severus only used the surname Snape in school, he was legally married to Lily Evans-Prince as Severus Prince. Their head of house straightened slightly. Up and down the table a silent message was passed between the house of snakes - protect him.</p>
<p>"Slytherin!"</p>
<p>They all relaxed slightly, this making him easier to protect.</p>
<p>"Weasley, Ron"</p>
<p>The red head was the last child to be sorted and after some deliberation, made Gryffindor.</p>

  <u>1992</u>
</p>
<p>Cecil Potter sighed, catching his brothers eyes from across the hall and rolled his eyes. It seemed their sister was incapable of going anywhere without, foundation, eyeliner and lip gloss - Minimum. As much as he loved his mum, she did a bad job with Scarlet, of course it would never be said out loud just like he would never tell her he prefers spending time with is 'Aunt' Lily. But that was a different matter. His best friends Chester and Natalia Davies and Thomas Abbott nudged him out of his thoughts with fond sighs of exasperation. </p>
<p>"Potter, Scarlet"</p>
<p>She strutted forwards making Cecil groan and bury his head in has hands much to the amusement of the upper years.</p>
<p>"Gryffindor!"</p>
<p>Which followed the exclamation of "Thank Merlin!" form both sides of the hall, yet neither were heard except by those close by as cheers erupted.</p>
<p>Cecil zoned out once more, thoughts now turning to his mothers proclamation she had sprung upon them two days before they left - she was pregnant. Scarlet was ecstatic, but that was expected. Harry simply raised an eyebrow, muttered something that resembled a sarcastic "Joy" but he couldn't be sure.  He himself had mixed feeling, sure he would love another sibling, but after how Scarlet turned out he really didn't want another repeat of her.</p>
<p>"Weasley, Ginerva"</p>
<p>The youngest red head looked ready to scream bloody murder at the use of her full name but wisely chose to stay silent.</p>
<p>"Gryffindor!"</p>
<p>Cecil sighed in relief, a small smile crossing his face at the sight of the Weasley twins, they looked mortified, and with good reason.</p>

  <u>1994 - present day</u>
</p>
<p>The sorting had passed without a glitch and the feast was almost finished when the headmaster stood up with a smile.</p>
<p>"I'm sure some of you have heard despite trying to keep it a secret, that this year Hogwarts will host the Tri-Wizard Tournament!"</p>
<p>Cheers erupted all around and the Weasley twins created a storm of confetti much to the students amusement and the teachers disaprovement - not including Sirus Black of course.</p>
<p>"However, we shall not be doing it the traditional way. We, Hogwarts, Durmstrang and Beaubaxtons have decided previous attempts has ended disastrously, so we made a few changes. Now there will be an age limit of 4th years and above, but the biggest change is....instead of having just three champion, a two groups will be picked to represent the school. There are two parts to the tournament - one of them is Qudditch, the other is a more traditional method of challenges. ow you can put yourself down for both but don't expect to be chosen for both. As previously, the goblet of fire will choose these groups however the contract is different, people may back out of the challenge if necessary, we shall not force you to compete. However the last challenge - there are seven - will allow only three people from each school to compete. And for The Quidditch Tournament, the gobleet will select a larger group to split into three, they will be our three quidditch teams, but all the points add up for our school total."</p>
<p>There followed silence as the school digested this information. </p>
<p>"Off to bed now"</p>
<p>Dumbledore finished cheerily, amusement twinkling in his eyes.</p>
<p>Many students went to bed with grins, dreaming of being chosen. Six however were awake. Sat in a circle in the room of requirement, watching the flames flicker in the fireplace.</p>
<p>Neville Longbottom - also known as Marcus Fallon, Luna Lovegood, Alex Casella, Dominic and Maddy Vulchanova and Harry Potter had only one thought in mind. To find their loved ones.</p>
