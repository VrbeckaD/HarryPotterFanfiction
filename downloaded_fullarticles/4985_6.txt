    <p align="justify">          The icy silence in the backseat of their small Honda Civic was a stark contrast to the cheerful, sunny weather outside. Modesty glared at the blur of trees zipping past the window, the tinny sound of music audible through her earphones. Credence had tried to engage her in conversation a few times, but she couldn’t hear him over the sound of whatever angsty pop-rock act was wailing into her ears, and when he did manage to catch her attention, she just turned away from him and cranked up the volume even more. She would probably go deaf before she turned twenty. Kids these days. Back when he was her age, he didn’t even <em>have </em>a phone, let alone one with enough storage to hold all the albums and songs he had helped her transfer into the device when she first got it. Their foster parents had made a few half-hearted attempts to get her to turn down the music and listen to what Credence had to say, but she ignored them just as thoroughly as she was ignoring Credence, and he could tell they didn’t think it was worth pushing the issue. Besides, they were too happy to let her mood affect them.</p>
<p align="justify">        With any other set of foster parents, a more cynical person might have assumed they were happy that one of their foster kids was finally leaving for a prestigious private college, taking a huge burden off their backs. But Credence knew they were genuinely happy that he had managed to beat the odds and become more than just another ominous statistic of juvenile delinquency among foster children. He was (relatively) emotionally well-adjusted and (relatively) intelligent, or at least intelligent enough to enroll in the game design course at Ilvermorny University. Of course, it was hard to get into drugs or whatever constituted juvenile delinquency when he spent his weekends holed up in his room tinkering away at his own video game and watching playthroughs of other games, rolling his eyes at the commentary from time to time. He might not be particularly sociable, but game designers in general weren’t known for being the life of the party. He’d leave the gloss and sparkle to the marketing team.</p>
<p align="justify">           No, the only blip in the horizon was having to share a dorm with a complete stranger. His scholarship didn’t cover single rooms, and while his foster parents had assured him that they didn’t mind him living at home even though he was technically already eighteen, it had felt weird to be taking up space in the house when they might have to take in another foster child. He also didn’t want to waste time that could otherwise be spent on his games. This was Modesty’s main gripe with him— that he was choosing to live on campus when he could otherwise live at home.</p>
<p align="justify">          <em>“Our house is one and a half hours away from the school. That’s three hours of time spent travelling per day. If I have classes four days a week, it adds up to twelve hours of wasted time. And think how much money I’d have to spend on gas. If I lived on campus, I could save time and money. Besides, living away from home is part of the whole college experience.”</em></p>
<p align="justify">
  <em>          “Like you care about college experience!” Modesty was usually calm and good-natured, but when she got angry, she was a force to behold. Her temperament was remarkably similar to his, except in his case, he stayed quiet mostly because he didn’t know how to talk to people and most of the time, it just wasn’t worth getting angry about things. Credence didn’t know anything his real parentage—he’d been in the foster care system for as long as he could remember and Modesty had been transferred over to their current family when he was twelve and she was three—but he sometimes wondered if they were related. If his real parents, whoever they were, had somehow managed to have another child that was taken away from them and in a bizarre twist of fate, the system had placed two biological siblings under the same roof without knowing they were related. “You just want to spend more time in your room making models of fictional girls on your computer and jacking off to them!” </em>
</p>
<p align="justify"><em>        "Where did you hear such a thing?!” Credence had looked at her in horror. Since when did words like “jacking off” become a part of the vocabulary of nine-year-olds instead of things like “princess costume party”? What were they teaching in schools these days? Besides, he did </em>not <em>jack off to fictional girls. Most of the protagonists of his stories were male.</em></p>
<p align="justify">
  <em>         "You can jack off at home too, you know.”</em>
</p>
<p align="justify"><em>        “I </em>don’t<em> jack off to fictional girls! And I’m serious, I’ll save a lot of time and money if I live on campus. When it’s your turn to go to college, you’ll want to live on campus so you can have more money to spend on other activities, like…”</em></p>
<p align="justify">
  <em>        “Like?”</em>
</p>
<p align="justify">
  <em>       “Uh.” Credence had been about to say something like “drinking and clubbing”, but he didn’t want to corrupt his sister, who was already much too worldly for her own good. He didn’t think he would be doing a lot of those things anyway, so it would just become more weapons for her arsenal. “Like saving up for things you really, really want to buy.”</em>
</p>
<p align="justify">
  <em>       “You’re not gonna be around for my birthday.” Suddenly, Modesty looked and sounded like the nine-year-old she was. “You probably aren’t even gonna buy me a present.”</em>
</p>
<p align="justify">
  <em>        “I can come home from campus, you know… I’m not moving to another planet.”</em>
</p>
<p align="justify">
  <em>       “But you said you wanted to save money.”</em>
</p>
<p align="justify">
  <em>       “Of course I can come back for special occasions.” </em>
</p>
<p align="justify">
  <em>       “I’m moving my stuff into your room.”</em>
</p>
<p align="justify">
  <em>       “Don’t you dare.”</em>
</p>
<p align="justify"><em>      </em>She’d stuck out her tongue at him, and that night, he’d found half of the clothes in his wardrobe missing, replaced by her skirts and dresses. They hadn’t discussed the issue since, and he had hoped that she would manage to come to terms with his leaving on her own. Obviously, she hadn’t, and now they were going to be parting on bad terms. Wonderful.</p>
<p align="justify">     An imposing-looking sign labelled with the school name and crest loomed into view. Beyond that, quaint, ivy-covered buildings sat along grassy verges. Credence tried to pick out the School of Computing but failed to find it. They continued down the road, passing some buildings that looked like faculty residences before finally reaching a sign that said WAMPUS HALL with an arrow pointing to the left. This would be his home for at least the next year.</p>
<p align="justify">      The dorms lacked the quiet beauty of the school buildings, but it wasn’t surprising that they were designed with practicality in mind, especially since hundreds of rambunctious undergraduates would be descending upon it in the upcoming days. The blocks were grouped around another huge grass plain overlooking a lake, which Credence supposed made for a better view than looking into someone’s window. A short distance away was a one-storey building with a sign that read HOUSING OFFICE/RECEPTION in front of it. He would have to pick up the keys to his room there.</p>
<p align="justify">      They got out of the car and started moving Credence’s luggage and boxes out of the trunk. He declined his foster mother’s offer to accompany him to pick up his keys and unpack, not wanting to leave a bad impression on his new roommate. Instead, they exchanged hugs. By the time Credence was released from his foster father’s arms and hesitatingly looking over at Modesty, unsure if she would punch him for trying, she had already wrapped her arms around his waist and was bawling into his shirt.</p>
<p align="justify">      “Hey,” he whispered. “I’m not dead, you know.”</p>
<p align="justify">      “B-but I’m going to m-miss you so much!”</p>
<p align="justify">     “You can text me anytime. We can even Skype. If I’d gone to college in…” he racked his brain for a far-off place, “Hawaii, we would have to work around time differences and it would be a lot harder for me to come home, even for holidays. But Ilvermorny’s just a short drive away. And you’re so busy and popular in school, you won’t even notice I’m gone.”</p>
<p align="justify">      She pulled back from him. “Make sure you make friends and talk to actual human beings.”</p>
<p align="justify">      Normally, Credence would have sniped that he had plenty of online friends and unless Modesty didn’t count herself as an actual human being, he got more than enough practice talking to her, but this message was delivered in such a serious tone that he knew she was genuinely concerned about his well-being. “I have a roommate, so I’ll definitely be talking to him.”</p>
<p align="justify">    “I hope he’s nice.”</p>
<p align="justify">    “Me too.”</p><hr/>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">    “You need to leave. We’re closing up.”</p>
<p align="justify">    It took a while for Percival to focus on the face hovering over him. The librarian was scowling down at him, hands folded across her chest, and he could practically read her thoughts—<em>damn kids, the only time the library isn’t open twenty-four hours a day is during term break but the nerdy ones just refuse to leave and I can’t go home unless they leave too</em>. He didn’t want to spend what was left of the term break (about five days, if he remembered correctly) among shelves of musty books, but he had decided to take a special term over the break to do some independent study modules, and he really needed to finish his research paper. If he couldn’t finish it before term resumed, it would drag on through the semester and make it even harder for him to focus on his classes. In retrospect, he probably shouldn’t have taken a special term since it wasn’t like he was in danger of failing, but he had thought some independent study modules would look good on a law school application. That might have been the case, but now school was starting again and he hadn’t even had a proper break. He slid the books and laptop into his bag, moving as slowly as possible just to spite the librarian.</p>
<p align="justify">    On his way back to the dorms, his feet carried him past the frat house and he instinctively sped up, not wanting anyone to spot him. Most students had gone home over the term break, including most of the guys in the fraternity, and he had taken advantage of the quiet to crash at the house while doing his special term. That was the only time the place was ever quiet—it was usually nonstop partying and waking up to find the kitchen in a mess because someone had passed out while trying to cook something to satisfy their three a.m. cravings, as he had learned the hard way. He had liked the alcohol, found to his surprise that his thoughts flowed more smoothly, making it easier to write when he was slightly buzzed, but he wasn’t a fan of frat culture and had only joined because his father had been a member when he was in Ilvermorny. Percival had decided to take a chance with the dorms this semester, even though they were mostly occupied by freshmen. Freshmen generally fell into three categories—the type that was so ecstatic to be away from home for the first time in their lives they went absolutely crazy and ended up behaving like the frat boys, the type that had been coddled and spoiled their whole lives and as such were unused to being away from home, and the studious, scholarship type that probably didn’t enjoy sharing a room either. His roommate in freshman year had been Type #2, or so he’d thought because the guy was so bad at taking care of himself Percival had often found himself behaving like a fussy mother, nagging at Newt to get something to eat or to do his laundry because he’d been wearing the same pair of pants for a week and it was starting to stink up the room. But it turned out Newt was just odd that way and if Percival had to put him in one of those categories, it would be Type #3. Newt’s passion for animals was unrivalled, and apart from working really hard on his zoology major, he volunteered at animal shelters on weekends. Percival had spent a few weekends helping out at Newt’s insistence (for someone who was usually so meek, Newt could be very persistent when animals were involved) and actually managed to get a dog that had bitten every single handler that approached it to eat out of his hand. Overall, Newt had been an interesting experience, but Percival was done with sharing a room. He had applied for a single room and picked up the keys that morning. Most of his things were still over at the frat house, but he figured he could spend the night in the peace and quiet of his new room—the frat house was starting to fill up again with returning members—and he was so drained from spending the day poring over indecipherable books he didn’t mind sleeping on a sheetless bed for the night.</p>
<p align="justify">    The dorm he was living in this year was different from the one he had shared with Newt back in freshman year, but the layout was similar. Percival squinted at the number printed on his key in the dim light, decided that it wasn’t worth taking the stairs, and headed for the elevators. When it reached the eleventh floor with a small <em>ding, </em>he strode towards the door labelled 11037 and let himself in, prepared to collapse onto the bed.</p>
<p align="justify">     But there were two beds, and there was already someone in one of them.</p>
<p align="justify">    <em>What the fuck?</em></p>
