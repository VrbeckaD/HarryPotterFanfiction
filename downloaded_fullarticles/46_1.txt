    <p>
  <span>Regulus Arcturus Black was dying alone in a cave, surrounded by the undead, and if that wasn’t some twisted metaphor for his life, he didn’t know what was. Fire was holding off the Inferi, but barely. His vision was growing dark. Whatever foul things were in that potion, Regulus knew it would be the end of him.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>What a Gryffindor way to die. Still, there was something to be said for bravery when it wasn’t precluded by idiocy. He knew this would most likely be a death knell. Part of him that he had buried deep within himself, a part that had lingered on since childhood, hoped that Sirius would be proud of the choice he made in the end. The right choice. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Defeating Voldemort had little to do with nobility and more to do with the deep seated desire for vengeance, to strike down the man that had the wizarding world enthralled with his lies. And that was a very Slytherin thing to do.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The fire dwindled with his consciousness, clammy hands grabbed at him, darkness pulled him in. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>I’m sorry brother.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The most surprising thing about Regulus waking was in fact the action itself. His eyes opened briefly to harsh light before shutting with a vengeance. If he was dead, would he truly be in so much pain? Perhaps it was penance for all the anguish he contributed in by taking the Mark.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Voices wafted over him, drifting on the edge of familiarity. Where and how were punctuated by images of a lake on fire, inferi clawing and grasping. Before he could manage the valiant effort of opening his eyes again, the void took him once more. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>This happened several times, differentiating by potions poured down his throat and soothing words and hands on his forehead. Until, finally, finally, he was able to keep his eyes open and take stock of his surroundings. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He quickly wished he was still unconscious. There was no mistaking the beds of the Hogwarts hospital wing. Confirming his suspicions, Albus Dumbledore batted away the privacy curtain with Madame Pomfrey pursing her lips.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Just because he’s awake for more than two seconds doesn’t mean you can waltz in here and disturb my patient.” The irate mediwitch was a healer first, a concerned citizen second. Any man, woman or child deserved her help, regardless of what side they fell on.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I am sorry, my dear. But these matters cannot wait with the war.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>His stomach churned unpleasantly, even as the healer pushed a potion into his hands, “Three questions and then you leave him be.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“As you wish,” he said with a serene smile, then turned to him. He didn’t look like the most powerful wizard in all of Britain. He simply looked tired to Regulus. Tired and old and heartbroken. “Now, Mr. Black, as you can imagine-”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“How’d I get here?” he croaked out. He needed to know a few things before being interrogated by the proclaimed leader of the Light.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“A house elf somehow managed to break through our wards to send you here. He did not remain long enough for us to know why.” Kreacher. At least the house elf was alive. And somehow had enough wits to not bring him home. There were worse places to end up at, namely anywhere Sirius was. That was one family reunion that could wait. Preferably after his death. Unless Dumbledore informed him. He eyed the headmaster. No, he wouldn't have told his brother until he was certain it would benefit him.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Perhaps you could explain the why?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>His gaze drifted from the bed to the bandage that wrapped around his forearm, as if there was an injury and not a permanent reminder of his mistakes. He did not meet the headmaster’s piercing look, knowing he was a master of Occlumency, something Regulus could fight if he was in better form. How much should he tell? While the Light claimed Albus Dumbledore could do no wrong, he had his doubts. He knew the old wizard’s thirst for power, he knew the mistakes he made that cost lives just as the Dark Lord cost lives.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>But he had defected. There were only so many options left. Retreat or fight. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I was wrong,” he started, sipping at the pain potion he was given, “Something my brother would relish in hearing, I’m sure. The Dark Lord does not want to rebuild our society into something great, he wants to destroy and burn.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“And you fought with him?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He offered a smirk that bordered on a sneer, “Something like that.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Dumbledore bowed his head for a moment, clearly thinking through his last question, most likely hoping Regulus would have been more forthcoming. Exhaustion and effects of the blasted potion weighed down on him, but he would not faint in this man’s presence.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Finally he smiled, a familiar twinkle in his eye as he asked his third question, “What will you do now?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Regulus frowned as he thought through his options. He couldn’t return home. His mother would drag him back to the Dark Lord faster than he could blink. Approaching Sirius wasn’t a choice. He loved his brother, despite the rift between them, but he was entirely too brash and light. If he could even fathom taking his Death Eater brother back, Sirius would expect him to join the fight.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>And he didn’t want to fight. Didn’t want to die in a war that he wasn’t sure where he stood anymore. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Go into hiding,” he finally managed, keeping any details as to what that looked like to himself.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Dumbledore was less than pleased, but did offer a carrot instead of a stick, “If you are interested, my potions professor is due for retirement soon. He could use an apprentice to take over in the next few years. And we could use a man of your abilities and connections, fighting for what’s right.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>There was no disguising his sneer now, “I am not going to be your pet spy, falling into good graces by virtue of your noble character.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Of course not,” he nodded, standing and straightening his lilac robes, “But the offer still stands, should you need employment.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Albus Dumbledore inclined his head as way of goodbye and left before the stern healer could reprimand him for harassing her patient. Regulus waited until he was certain the old wizard was out of the wing before tossing aside the covers and testing his strength. There was a certain weakness about his knees, but he didn’t pass out at the attempt; he counted that as a win. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Of course the drated mediwitch caught him.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What do you think you’re doing, young man?” She demanded, about to force him back into bed. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Can’t stay here.” The pain relief potion kept him on his feet, but he knew he had to get to safety before it wore off. Fainting was still a distinct possibility. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Madame Pomfrey’s fierce gaze softened a touch, “You’re safe here.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He threw her a doubtful glance. There was relative safety for the majority of people at Hogwarts. But this place was never safe for him. The castle was a reminder of how his family fell apart. This is where it all went wrong. And as a Death Eater who has no qualms about disagreeing with the headmaster, Regulus would only find obligation and manipulation here. He might as well go home for that. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Seeing his resolution to leave, she sighed and offered a vial, “Take it twice a day until gone. I don’t know how you ended up in the state that you are, but this room is neutral. As long as you don’t hurt my students, you can find healing here.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He nodded to her, wishing he could simply apparate away like any sensible pureblooded lord would do to make a statement. Instead, he walked out, casting concealment charms before entering the main halls. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Had it really only been a year since his graduation? It felt like a lifetime. What a foolish child he had been, starved for attention, desperate to prove himself. Perhaps not much had changed in that regard. His childish faith in his elders was gone. His disillusionment of his parents knowing best, that the Dark Lord wanted to make the world better, that somehow the Light were the ones forcing the war.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He stopped at the lake, just inside the boundary line, debating on which house to hole up in. He could not go to Grimmauld Place, which would be a return to slavery. Finding Sirius was out of the question, even if he somehow believed his change of mind. There were numerous Black holdings, but it would be risky. His grandfather, Arcturus Black, would certainly feel the wards admit him in as head of house. While he had yet to declare a side, he certainly hadn’t stopped his family from following the mass-murdering nutcase. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He let out a huff in annoyance, then stepped out of the wards and apparated before he spent all night in the cold. </span>
