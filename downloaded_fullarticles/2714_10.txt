  <span>Vernon Dursley was about to open the front door to go on his morning run. Each morning at  5 am he went running. Ever since he joined Grunnings’s Health and Fitness program he and his beloved wife Petunia had started to eat healthier and exercise more. Vernon had quickly realised he actually quite liked running, it helped him clear his head before going to work and he wished he had gotten into the habit much earlier. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Of all the things Vernon expected to see on his morning run, a baby on his doorstep was not one of them. The small child was crying and shivering. Vernon wondered what kind of idiot left a child outside in November and was immediately worried for the kid’s health. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Vernon picked up the boy and the letter that was with him and called his wife’s name. He turned up the heating a little bit and grabbed one of Dudley’s spare blankets from the cupboard underneath the stairs. He wrapped it around the cold child. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Petunia looked at him in shock when he saw him with a child that was most definitely not Dudley. No, their own son was sleeping soundly upstairs and hopefully having the sweetest dreams. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Found him on the doorstep, Pet.” Vernon said, shaking his head a little, “There was a letter with him. Might give us an idea of what lunatic leaves a toddler outside in this weather.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“People these days,” Petunia said disapprovingly, “some should never be allowed near children.” She sighed and opened the envelope. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She noticed the seal on the letter and frowned. Hogwarts. She remembered it from when Lily went to that school. Lily, her sweet sister. She wondered how she was doing, all of Petunia’s letters had gone unanswered for nearly a year. She had no idea what happened. One day they were mending their relationship and the next Lily stopped replying. The last thing she had heard was a story about Harry, Lily’s son. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s from Lily’s school,” Petunia said sadly, “very odd.” She frowned and took the letter out of the envelope and began to read. </span>

  <em>
    <span>Dear Mrs P. Dursley</span>
  </em>
</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">
  <em>
    <span>With great regret I must inform you your sister Lily J. Potter and her husband James H. Potter died on the 31st of October. You need not worry about their funeral as this has already been taken care of. They were buried this morning at Godric’s Hollow.</span>
  </em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>
    <span>The child is your sister’s son Harry James Potter and it is my expectation that you will proceed to take great care of him. He must not be spoiled. I would advise against informing of magic, at least before he turns 11. People will surely try to hurt him.</span>
  </em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>
    <span>You may not contact me or any magical person you may know before his Hogwarts letter is send. I strongly advise you hide the child very well, even from your neighbours.</span>
  </em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>
    <span>Harry and Lily are thought to be responsible for vanquishing the Dark Lord Voldemort. Lily did not survive his attack. Miraculously Harry did. This Dark Lord’s followers are still out there and would surely attempt to harm the Boy-Who-Lived. It’s is of the utmost importance that no one discovers his whereabouts or your entire family will be in danger.</span>
  </em>
</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">
  <em>
    <span>I hope I have informed you enough.</span>

  <span>Petunia let out a sob. She couldn’t believe it, her baby sister gone! She hadn’t even been able to say goodbye. Oh how she wished she could see Lily one more time and hold her tightly. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>And how she wanted to curse Dumbledore. What was that disastrous man thinking?! Leaving Harry, poor Harry, outside in the middle of the night. How dare he do that to Lily’s child. She wanted to curse him. She hoped someone would. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Vernon wrapped his arms around his crying wife. He knew how much she already missed her sister, how she had longed to talk to her again. To learn it was never going to be possible again was heartbreaking. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I am so sorry, my darling.” Vernon said sadly. “We’ll care for her boy. Not because that man ordered it, but because he is your sister’s son and he is family.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Petunia smiled sadly, “We’ll love him as we love Dudley.” She said. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We will, my dearest.” Vernon replied and kissed her gently. “Let’s change this little one and put him to bed for a few hours. He must be tired.” As if on cue, Harry yawned. “I’ll call the company and tell them I need to take a personal day. We’ll take him and Dudley for a check up and inform the authorities.” He said. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Alright, love.” Petunia nodded, “Can we buy Lilies tomorrow? For my sister?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course, sweetest.” Vernon said and he knew it would be the start of a new tradition. He would make sure to give his wife lilies every week for as long as she wanted. </span>
