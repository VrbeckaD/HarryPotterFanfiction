    <p>
  <b>Vanessa Adams was perfectly happy to say she was completely abnormal thank you very much, she tended to lean towards all things strange.</b>
  <span> Not everyone up and left their home to travel the world, exploring all of the hidden secrets that every place held and to take pictures of them for her books; which had quite the following if she did say so herself. Even with a toddler tagging along, she was quite content to show her daughter Winny off to anyone they came along to and her daughter was just as excited to babble in what she thought was their language. After a few weeks, Winny would know a few sentences and would actually be able to communicate. “Déplacer un peu vers la gauche? Merci, c'est parfait.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Maman, elles drôles!” Winny was very bright for her age and loved to learn about the pictures her mother was taking. She would make hilarious comments in a multitude of different languages, sometimes switching between two that sounded similar, like French and Spanish. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mon petit chou,” her mother sighed dramatically like she couldn’t believe what was coming out of the child's mouth, “they will look wonderful when I take the picture. I will show it to you when I’m done, oui?” Vanessa beamed when giggles rang through the air and she went back to arranging her models, shouting random phrases for them to react to. “Shakespearean lovers!” One couple pretended to fight each other and the other burst out laughing, so she quickly took shots of both. At the end of the day she had a multitude of photos to go through and new contacts in Dinan. It was a long drive back to where they were staying in Nantes, but she had taken all the pictures she could with the city background. Besides, she was bored with her friend off at work. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>As soon as the door opened to the apartment, the two travelers were met with the smell of freshly made pizza which warmed them to their cores. “Oh, I’m so glad you’re back! Dinner is on the table and I was going to start eating without you. I worked hard for this.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You mean you ordered from Nota Bene again.” Vanessa hung up their coats by the door and made sure to catch her daughter before she ran off with her shoes still on, smirking as Vanessa noticed the disappointed look on their hosts face. “Oh you know I will never say no to take out, I just thought that there were more home cooked meals in places like this.” She barely had time to duck when a fork was thrown her way, glad Winny was curled up on the couch and out of the danger zone.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Camille Lafon was a short woman who made up for it in teased curls and large hats that would cover Winny for the night. “You are a terrible friend, I would kick you out if you weren’t paying me...” That was a lie and both of them knew it, the only thing that Vanessa paid for was gas and a little bit for groceries. When she had tried offering rent, the french woman had chased her around the house with a pillow to hit her with. Under no terms would Camille accept money to house a friend...at least one with a cute daughter who thought she was the coolest person alive. “So where are you going next? I hear Dubai is wonderful this time of year.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>An unladylike snort erupted from across the table and was quickly swallowed by childish howls of laughter from all three occupants. “You think Dubai is wonderful all times of the year. No, I think we’re going to leave Europe again. I’m starting to feel antsy being this close, like something bad is going to happen.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Nothing</span>
  </em>
  <span> is going to hurt you here, I swear it. I will protect you with my life.” As retired engineer for the air force, Camille took her oath seriously. “I know you don’t like to look back on what happened to you, but I think it’s time you explain why you run away from where you’re from like it’s hell. You haven’t even stepped a toe over the border of Britain, you spend only days in Europe and you only spend a couple weeks with me because you don’t see me enough.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>There wasn’t an elephant in the room to discuss because in this case, Vanessa had no idea what the elephant was. She knew there was a reason she ran from where she was born and she knew that the thought of going back caused her to wake up feeling like she was laying on hot coals, but for the life of her she had no idea what </span>
  <em>
    <span>actually</span>
  </em>
  <span> happened. The therapist Vanessa talked to online suggested that it was blanked out of her memory to protect herself, but that was hard to judge the truth on. “You know I can’t talk about this and I would tell you first if I understood it myself. But I...it’s like a gut feeling I have, trying to cross that bridge knowing the other end is enemy territory even if it’s not common knowledge.” She tucked a blanket around her daughter quietly, kissing her cheek lightly before moving back to the kitchen to help clean dishes. “You won’t understand because </span>
  <em>
    <span>I</span>
  </em>
  <span> don…” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>To say Vanessa threw up was an understatement. Camille would later joke that her plumbing up and left after having to suffer such tortue, which was why her sink had such bad pressure. “Are you okay?” All she got was a groan and some unsavory words.</span>
</p><hr/><p>It was a bit of a struggle to move around with one child but it was impossible when Vanessa realized there was only one of her and suddenly there were two children. After much deliberation on her part and a lot of arguing on the phone with her contacts, the two women were relieved to hear that she could have a stay at home job as an editor for the company Vanessa published her works through. The only problem? They were based in Surrey, England. “You aren’t seriously thinking of taking this?”</p><p>
  <span>“What are my other options, Cami? Continue traveling the world while pregnant and with an almost three year old, take pictures with a baby strapped to my chest and a four year old screaming for attention? Become unemployed and leech off you while I search for something better?” The arguing wasn’t angry so with the tv on, the child was none the wiser. “I have to do this for them, there isn’t another way.” Any passerby would think that the mother at the kitchen table was brave and ready to dive head first into a new adventure. All Cami saw was a scared woman who was walking into her own nightmare to provide for the only people she truly loved. </span>
</p><hr/><p>
  <b>People didn’t move to Privet Drive unless they were a white married couple that drive a subaru with their 1.5 children in tow, usually an older boy and the mother being pregnant with a daughter.</b>
  <span> So when the for sale sign was removed for number 3, all of the neighbors were prepared for moving trucks and a party that would be hosted by the new family. They were not prepared for the Adams family.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Come along, mon petit chou. We have a new house to explore.” Although her job set her up with the house (or at least told her they would put a down payment on it to cover her overtime), Vanessa had been forced to find a car. Luckily, station wagons were always a good deal and her’s currently sat in her new driveway filled with everything they owned. She could feel the eyes of the neighborhood on her, the walker that had paused too long to let the dog sniff the mail boxes and the couple next door who were staring at her like she walked out of a garbage patch. So what if there was nothing to explore in the house? Her daughter didn’t deserve what she was getting. “Good afternoon.” Vanessa waved to the woman in Number 4 who had put six clothespins on a dishcloth, chuckling to herself as soon as she was in the safety of her living room and away from more prying eyes. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was not a surprise when a few days later she was met with Number 4’s judgement as she stopped to say hello on a walk while Vanessa tried to fix the flower gardens. “It seems I never got your name and I haven’t seen your husband around.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I have no one around here’s name so it seemed fair. I’m Vanessa Adams and this is my daughter Winny.” A light had pushed back sticky curls as the child clung to her leg. She refused to acknowledge the husband comment, choosing instead to focus on the two little ones in front of her. “Are these your boys? They’re darling. What are their names?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Vanessa and Winny are lovely names,” </span>
  <em>
    <span>for horses maybe if you were being honest</span>
  </em>
  <span>, “mine is Petunia and </span>
  <em>
    <span>my</span>
  </em>
  <span> husband is Vernon. This is my Dudleykins and my nephew…” the sound she made was like she was trying to keep her teeth from falling out, “Harry.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>As the other woman continued on her route, Vanessa quickly decided that she despised the Dursley’s. The older boy was conciderably chubby for a child his age and it was going to wreak havoc on his bones when he started...if he started to walk. She wouldn’t put it past someone like Petunia to never put down her child. His eyes were small like he was used to squinting, his cheeks flushed from all of the blankets piled around him. He looked miserable. On the other hand, Harry was dwarfed by his cousin with only a what looked like year between them. He blended in with the white lining of the carrier Petunia was pushing them around in, but his dirty onsie did not. It was stiff and disgusting, like she hadn’t washed it since the first time he was dressed in their home. As such, Vanessa had quickly offered up her services to babysit. “I work from home and already have everything set up for a child.” Though it looked like she would never get the chance if the disgust hidden in Petunia’s eyes, like a tree in the ocean, had anything to say about it.</span>
</p><hr/><p>“The babysitter canceled last minute, like a legitimate minute ago and the car is already ready. Can you watch them?” Desperation outweighed whatever opinion the Dursley’s had created of her, so Vanessa took the three children inside. Dudley immediately started screeching for his mother so she took off the blankets but left him in the carrier for the time being. Harry was her main concern and Winny just went upstairs when the screaming got too much. When Harry was curled up in freshly washed clothes and a blanket on the playmat she had spread over the floor, she turned her eyes to Dudley. “I always did enjoy a challenge.”</p><p>
  <span>And a challenge it was. He refused to eat anything she gave him, threw it around and screamed endlessly. Her daughter was older than both boys by almost a year and the difference between the three was astounding. She had finally gotten that Harry was a year and a half, having been with the Dursley’s for three months as she moved in his first week. Dudley was only a month older than his cousin but didn’t act like it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He refused to walk to the things he wanted even though she knew he could by now, after an hour he was still sitting in the chair pouting while refusing water to ease his throat. When he finally realized she wasn’t going to pay attention to him this way, he started following her around. “W’as tha’?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Happy to pay attention to him now that he was behaving like a normal child, Vanessa explained everything she was working on to him and let him help. Dudley’s tentative behavior turned to excitement as he washed up then sat down on the counter to help her mash up the potatoes, following Winny’s lead as she worked on the carrots. It was simple but fun for them, Harry was happy to babble chatter at her while she worked, electing gasps and sassy remarks to things that made no sense. “Alright darlings, it’s time to eat. I’m so proud of you three for helping with dinner, I couldn’t have done it without you.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>When they had finished eating and the kids were getting sleepy, she curled up with them on the couch and put some cartoon on while they fell fast asleep in her lap. Yes it was hard for her, but that day with the kids made her realize that she could do this. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Vanessa was actually disappointed when she woke up to the doorbell ringing, picking Dudley out of her lap and onto her hip so he could cling to her shirt. As soon as the door was open, she realized how stressed Petunia must have been to leave him alone. Her hair was falling out of it’s perfect updo and her dress was rumpled. If she didn’t know any better, Vanessa would say that she wasn’t trusted. “Oh my Dudleykins, I’m so happy to see you.” She reached out immediately but the boy refused to let go of Vanessa’s shirt and started wailing when he got yanked into his mother's arms. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Vanessa grabbed a toy off the table quickly, one of Winny’s old ones that she decided she didn’t like anymore so she gave to Dudley. “Here darling, just curl up with your stuffie.” As soon as he had the toy curled against his body, Dudley was out like a candle in a windstorm. “He was wonderful, helped me with dinner and toddled after Winny.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The look on her neighbor’s face was torn between the excitement of knowing that her son was being praised and the horror of her son’s new friend and him doing chores. “Thank you for watching him, I’ll let you know if the babysitter ever qu...cancels on us again.” Against Vanessa’s better judgement, she reminded Petunia about Harry who looked very grumpy about being woken up from his nap. That at least seemed to cheer the other woman up as she walked over to number 4. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, that was quite the interesting night wasn’t it mon petit chou?” A hand flew to her growing belly which was cleverly hidden from the neighbors, Vanessa’s eyes dropping as she realized how tired she was. “Let’s get you to bed then I’ll try to sleep...if I can sleep.” </span>
</p><hr/><p>
  <b>Winny Adams was going to be the fastest girl in the neighborhood and soon the whole school.</b>
  <span> It wasn’t actually that hard to be the fastest in her neighborhood, because the only other girl who wasn’t off acting silly with older boys was her little sister. And Annie was the type to be perfectly content to do cartwheels and flips in the backyard. “Dudley, come play with us!” Her long time friend was not exactly the nicest person there was, he would tease her and pull on her hair but he knew she’d just hit right back. Even though he acted in front of his parents, Dudley really liked Harry and when they came over they’d goof off together.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He waved back with a wide smile before noticing his mother in the window and forced his shoulders to relax, pointing at her with his hands raised like, “what can you do?” His mother would see her son easily avoiding the bad children in a polite way, but all Winny saw was her friend stuck at home. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Come on Winny, he doesn’t want to play with us.” No one should have that much venom in their voice when they talked, not even fake, but Harry seemed to manage it. After informing Mr. Dursley that Vanessa was getting concerned about Harry being cooped up in that house all day, they had been forced to let him out to run around with her children. Harry was a stick even with his small growth spurt, but Mum gave him all the food he needed when he came over so he just looked like he had a fast metabolism. That was what the boy the next street over had, he would always complain about his stomach with how much food his parents fed him. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Liar</span>
  </em>
  <span>. “Yes he does but your aunt has to stick her witch nose into our fun.” Winny huffed and stomped her foot, glaring at the house as she waited for the inevitable call for her to be put under control. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Before the screeching could start, she was pulled into a jog next to the other boys. “Come on Whiney, catch up.” She was just as tall as her friends so she easily matched stride with them and was laughing as the world blurred around her. Winny’s twelfth birthday was approaching, but first it was the boys next door who would be celebrating. Next week, she would get to tag along on a trip to the zoo!</span>
