    <p>"Jamesie this looks like it's going to be quite the wedding, do you and Sirius have appropriate robes for it that still actually fit you?" Euphemia Potter asked from James' doorway holding the fancy wedding invitation in hand.</p>
<p>Himself and Sirius were on the bed, a chessboard between them and a dozen or so empty sweet packets surrounding them.</p>
<p>"Yeah mine are fine mum." James said dismissively not looking away from the chessboard.</p>
<p>"Mine still fit Euphemia, though I don't grow every two weeks like your darling Jamsie." Sirius said mockingly.</p>
<p>"You're only being petty because you're losing." James told him.</p>
<p>"Well boys, not too late to bed please, you'll have to be up and away handy in the morning if you're helping Alice and Loraine out with the flowers." Euphemia told them a soft smile on her lips as she watched the two boys, both wearing ragged t-shirts and flannel pyjama bottoms just like they had when they were 13.</p>
<p>"Mum, we're 17!" James groaned his head falling back dramatically.</p>
<p>"Well, I'm just saying, she wants you at the house for 9:00am sharp. And we know how Sirius struggles in the morning." She said dotingly.</p>
<p>"Yep, James will have the delight of getting me up and out of the house though Euphemia so there's no need for you to get up early tomorrow, you can have a lie in!"</p>
<p>Euphemia laughed at this strode into the room and gave each boy a kiss on the cheek. "Goodnight boys. Have a lovely day tomorrow, and wish Alice all the best."</p>
<p>"Will do Mum, night." James muttered moving his knight on the board.</p>
<p>"Goodnight!" Sirius replied before turning back to the board. "What time does the wedding actually start though?" He asked looking at the board.</p>
<p>"No way Sirius! We promised Alice we'd help set up and anyway, Remus and Peter are going that early too. We'll have the whole day together!"</p>
<p>"But we saw them like a week ago!" Sirius groaned moving a piece at random, bored and knowing that his chances of winning were slim to none.</p>
<p>"What happened at the lake Sirius? Huh? You've been so against meeting up with the other two. Why?" He asked concerned hoping against hope that whatever it was that was going on between Sirius and Remus hadn't ruined their friendship.</p>
<p>"Oh nothing…it just…whatever I don't want to talk about it." Sirius scambled, watching as James moved his castle across the board. "You know what I'm going to bed. Like your mum said we have to be up early." He slid off the bed gracefully, pulling his hair up and away from his face and tying it back. "Night." He mutterd and James watched cautiously as Sirius left his bedroom, closing the door behind him rather aggressively.</p>
<p>All James could do was hope that whatever it was, Sirius and Remus would sort it out between themselves tomorrow.</p>
<p>"Sirius! Wake up!" James said louder, shaking the prone figure who's hair had fallen from the hair band and was now spread all over his pillow. "Come on! You said you had to shower this morning as well! Well I'm done, just got to get dressed so now you have to get in the shower! It's 8:00am and you take at least half an hour!" James insisted still shaking Sirius' shoulder back and forth until he saw soft blue eyes glaring up at him from the blue pillow cases.</p>
<p>"Alright!" James pulled away, hands in the air as he backed from the bed, watching as Sirius sat up and got out of bed. "One hour." James warned before leaving Sirius' bedroom and heading toward his own once more.</p>
<p>His suit was hung up on the outside of his wardrobe, black pants, white shirt, slim black tie, and blazer jacket, pocket square already neatly slotted into the breast pocket by his mum. His shoes were polishing themselves neatly by his bed, again thanks to his mum who was fishing around his sock drawer for a matching pair.</p>
<p>"Mum just leave it! No one will see them anyway!" James told her.</p>
<p>"James! This is a big deal! Your first proper wedding! You have to look smart!" She told him sternly continuing to dig through the top drawer of his dresser.</p>
<p>"I thought you were going to have a lie in?" He asked her, shaking his head as she pulled out another pair of socks that were mismatched and shook her head.</p>
<p>"I'll go back to bed once you've both gone." She told him.</p>
<p>"You mean once you know we're both dressed properly?" He asked a grin on his face as his mother turned to face him, hands on her hips.</p>
<p>"Well…yes that is why I'm up! I know you two too well."</p>
<p>"Don't you trust us?" He asked, widening his eyes purposefully at her.</p>
<p>"Oh Jamesie, you know I do! Fine, I'll leave you too it! Hopefully you haven't grown since my last alterations to those trousers." She muttered as she crossed the room and left muttering all the way down the hall.</p>
<p>James sighed, it was true his mum had only altered his trousers a few weeks ago for some ministry ball he'd had to attend with his parents, and before that they had been brand new.</p>
<p>Taking off his jeans he quickly switched into the black pants and checked in the mirror, there might be the slightest view of his socks, but he really didn't care all that much, it would jazz up the outfit a bit, he thought. Dressing in the rest of his wedding outfit he ventured out and back into Sirius' room where the owner of the room was pulling on his boxers giving James a glimpse of a pale behind.</p>
<p>"Not exactly the arse I wanted to see first thing in a morning." James commented with a laugh as Sirius spun quickly, his wet hair sticking to his face comically.</p>
<p>"Well I'm sorry that this arse was not the shapely behind of Miss Evans…" He said and James laughed loudly causing Sirius to smile as he pulled on his dark blue trousers and white shirt.</p>
<p>"What time is it?" Sirius asked as he placed his cufflinks in.</p>
<p>"Uh...8:45am." James told him with a glance at his wristwatch.</p>
<p>"Just enough time for a coffee and some breakfast!" Sirius said delighted, before bouncing his way out of the room, wet hair swinging as he did.</p>
<p>"Be good boys! And do try and be helpful and not a hindrance to Florean and Loraine!" Euphemia Potter told them from the front doorstep still wrapped in her dressing gown.</p>
<p>"Will do Euphemia! Don't wait up for us!" Sirius called over his shoulder as he shrugged into the matching dark blue jacket that he had almost forgotten, the reason why Euphemia ended up waving them off from the doorstep.</p>
<p>"Bye!" James called before taking out his wand and disapparating into nothing and arriving seconds later in the small Wizarding village of Ilkley in the Yorkshire Dales.</p>
<p>It was mid July and the morning promised a beautiful day, the sun was shining out from between white fluffy clouds and there was only a slight wind that blew a soft summer breeze through the small village.</p>
<p>James and Sirius had apparated into the Fortescue's back garden that sat just on the outskirts of the village, from the garden the noise from the large georgian house already suggested that a great number of people were inside.</p>
<p>Entering through the open back door James and Sirius looked about the busy room noting that they knew no one else in there and stood there lost as to where they should be going.</p>
<p>"Ah James and Sirius! Lovely to see you boys!" Florean Fortescue announced coming into the room, his pink cheeks as flushed as ever but instead of his usual bright shirt and patterned trouser combination that was so beloved by all customers at Florean Fortescue's Ice cream Parlour, he was wearing exceedingly fancy wizards robes that were a dark green, lighting up his eyes that shone with pride.</p>
<p>"Mr Fortescue!" They both greeted, they had always been frequent customers at the family run business, as well as being close friends of Alice's. "How's everything holding up?" James asked as he looked about at the chaos reigning.</p>
<p>"Oh brilliant! Absolutely perfect! The girls are all upstairs getting ready, Alice looks beautiful! And well Remus and Peter are just through the front carrying the flowers from here to the Reception in the town hall down the road. You don't mind do you?" He asked after his excited chatter.</p>
<p>"Not at all!" Sirius announced patting Florean on the shoulder. "More than happy to help out for Alice's big day!"</p>
<p>"This way then, the others shouldn't have set off yet, they were helping the florists son bring the flowers in off his broom."</p>
<p>Making their way through the bustling house and out the front door Sirius and James found Peter and Remus helping a handsome young man count the flowers, Remus was laughing gently at something the young man had said only to stop when he caught sight of them, a blush colouring his cheeks.</p>
<p>James just rolled his eyes and bounced down the steps and began picking up bunches of flowers that were laid out on the grass.</p>
<p>"Where are we taking them then?" He asked to the garden in general.</p>
<p>"Just down the street James. Follow me." Peter said proudly, grabbing two bunches in his hands before walking out of the gate.</p>
<p>It took the four marauders four trips to take the flowers to the town hall and hand them over to the decorators there. Remus and Sirius stayed behind James Peter the whole time, talking quietly all the while.</p>
<p>"I just can't believe that Alice is getting married!" Peter declared as they returned to the house.</p>
<p>"Me neither Pete! Mental! Can you imagine getting married this young?" He asked shaking his head.</p>
<p>"But Frank's two years older and I mean…they've been going out for a while." Remus interjected moving into the living room and taking a seat on the sofa.</p>
<p>"Yeah but it's still crazy." Sirius said with a shrug of his shoulders.</p>
<p>The boys were quiet for a moment, lost in thought, only to be interrupted by the arrival of Alice and her entourage of ladies.</p>
<p>"Well hello boys!" Alice said grinning madly at all four of them. She looked beautiful, her white dress was sleek and simple, flaring out from her waist, her hair was curled about her pretty face.</p>
<p>All four boys stood at her entrance and began praising her beauty to which she blushed and told the lot of them to shut up.</p>
<p>"You'll want to get to the church. I'll be there soon!" She said raising her eyebrows in excitement.</p>
<p>"Yep we'll get gone. We'll let Frank know that you've run off." James said with a grin then gave Alice a quick hug and left, the other's following suit.</p>
<p>The church of Ilkley village was jam packed full of people and it was filled with excited chatter as 12:00pm rolled ever closer. The four marauders spent the half an hour they had left to wait till the ceremony discussing all of the things they had yet to sort out for the Canewdon music festival. At 11:53am the church doors flew open and the crowd inside fell silent, only to laugh when in stumbled three young girls who giggled at all the eyes on them.</p>
<p>James had stopped whatever it was he had been talking about as he saw the oh so familiar red head of Lily Evans enter the church. She was stumbling slightly as she entered and had to lean down to pull a strap of her heeled shoes back onto her foot. She was wearing a cream and floral dress that hit her mid calf, the material was thin and fitting, with a low plunging neckline, her hair was soft and wavy about her face falling below her shoulders blades. James watched as she, Dorcas and Marlene shuffled in giggling and took a seat in the last pew left at the back of the church. They were just sitting down when James caught Lily's eye and she grinned at him and gave him a quick wave before taking her seat turning toward Dorcas on her left.</p>
<p>"Evans' looking pretty." Sirius murmured into James ear as music started up from the front of the church.</p>
<p>"Yes…she is." Was all James replied as he replayed that grin she gave him.</p>
