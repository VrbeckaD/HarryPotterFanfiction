    <p>I am the teller of this story, yet I am not a person who was involved in it. I am merely the wind, which carries this set of tales into the grand expanses of the minds of those who read it. The one who has fashioned this tale from various thoughts and ideas, some of their own, some borrowed, wishes to impress upon you nine things for you to keep in mind as you read this.</p><p>First, Joanne Kathleen Rowling created this literary world, and it is she who must be given the credit, approbation and appreciation for the ideas that she has poured into it.</p><p>Second, the author lays claim to their own ideas, along with recognising some of their points of inspiration. White Hound Fan Fiction is one such person who has stirred the author’s thoughts about these stories.</p><p>Third, this story takes place in a time that you may not be expecting it to, this is because a certain raven-haired, green-eyed, bespectacled young man with a lightning bolt scar, was born in 1991 rather than 1980.</p><p>Forth, the one who has seen fit to write this story, has written in their own characters, all of whom are simply ordinary people who possess real strengths and weaknesses. One of these originals is a very close and careful examination of themselves, with all their many and occasionally confronting flaws, plus their talents and strengths.</p><p>Fifth, Jo’s canon will be treated as somewhat of a guide to these tales but is not as binding on this series as it is on others. Jo’s epilogue and her work: <em>The Cursed Child</em>, will not have any bearing on the outcome of this series.</p><p>Sixth, although those who write things like this owe the ability to play around in this world to Jo, she is not exhaustive in her descriptions about the world which she created. As such the author wants me to tell you that, they feel that this leaves plenty of room of reimagining a few things.</p><p>Seventh, there will probably be some “reading of the books” about the place, although what form that will take is something which I, the humble wind, shall not dare to spoil.</p><p>Eighth, some of the original characters are, well… shall we say, survivors of a rather terrible run in some of those who seek to play God and care not for the consequences.</p><p>And Ninth, this series is rated as being for a mature audience due to the author’s somewhat Australian proclivity for rather colourful and illustrative swearing or invective.</p><p>Now I must let you get on with hopefully enjoying the fruits of the author’s labours. You, dear reader shall, most likely, not hear me speak directly to you again in this series.</p>
<h3 align="center">*~*~*</h3><p>It was the 1<sup>st</sup> of November 1992, and John Major was sitting in the Cabinet Room going through some paperwork shortly after a meeting had broken up, when a rather over-excited Downing Street staffer burst into the room, calling after the Prime Minister rather breathlessly. It was evident that the young female civil servant had been running through the rooms and corridors, to find her boss with something obviously very important to tell him. She skidded to a halt and managed in a just a few seconds to catch her breath enough to tell her Prime Minister what was going on.</p><p>‘Prime Minister, there’s a very odd woman outside. She says she needs to see you, she’s rather insistent,’ she said, still huffing and puffing.</p><p>‘Right, I suppose you had better send her in then,’ the Prime Minister said, as gently as he could. ‘Thank you, Emily.’</p><p>Emily ducked out of the room quickly, likely in the hopes of off-loading someone who could be considered a bit of a problem visitor onto the Prime Minister, and then get them out of Number Ten. A few minutes after Emily left the room, the door to the cabinet room was opened to admit a rather austere looking woman dressed in a style of clothing best described as very odd. To Major she seemed to be wearing clothes more suited to the 17<sup>th</sup> or 18<sup>th</sup> centuries. Yet, the Minister of Magic Millicent Bagnold was already known to the Prime Minister, they had met at least twice before, and each time had caused a similar amount of consternation amongst the staff in Downing Street.</p><p>‘Good afternoon, Prime Minister,’ she greeted smoothly.</p><p>‘Good afternoon, Millicent,’ Major replied. ‘What did you need to discuss with me today?’</p><p>Minister Bagnold sat down at the Cabinet Table across from the Prime Minister.</p><p>‘Lord Voldemort has been defeated, and he has disappeared,’ Minister Bagnold began. ‘We currently believe that he may have been killed, but we have not been able to confirm this.’</p><p>The Prime Minister leaned back in his chair and blew out a breath.</p><p>‘Was anyone killed or injured?’</p><p>Bagnold hesitated a moment.</p><p>‘Yes, James and Lily Potter were murdered, leaving their son Harry as an orphan. And a man by the name of Peter Pettigrew.’</p><p>The Prime Minister looked a little shaken by this news.</p><p>‘I expect that I’ll get an official report on this later, sent through the striped box,’ Major began cautiously. ‘But is there anything that you need help with?’</p><p>‘Thank you, Prime Minister. But, no, there is nothing that we need Whitehall’s assistance with.’</p><p>Minister Bagnold decided to turn to some other topics which required a short discussion, however that only took up a few minutes before both politicians had to prepare themselves for a meeting they would attend together. They would be travelling together from Downing Street to Buckingham Palace, to tell The Queen about what had just happened. The Prime Minister earnestly hoped that the violence that the magical community of the United Kingdom and Ireland had suffered would now calm down for a while, giving the ordinary people a break from the tension and fear that had marked the last few years.</p>
<h3 align="center">*~*~*</h3><p>Cain Joseph Blackthorne despaired of himself, he had been working at his great project for since 1988 and achieved very little success. Even though he had managed to establish several laboratory bases around the world, to reduce the risk of being discovered and having his work halted, he still didn’t have any more than a handful of successes, nowhere near enough for his original purposes. He was now doubting his intentions for this project, it had all become far too complicated compared to when he started out.</p><p>And the biggest complicating factor that had arrived in late 1992, the little orphaned baby girl he had found still clutched in her dead mother’s arms. Her mother had been attacked, with either spells, guns or knives, based on the deep wounds etched into her flesh. No doubt she was hoping to find a little shelter, and maybe some help. The two of them were laid out across his doorstep, the mother was probably trying to find a place to hide, not quite realising that she so gravely wounded and thinking only of the safety of her child. He would come to realise that he couldn’t keep on like this, in many ways, for her sake.</p><p>He had taken her in, and at the time had thought that she was a perfect “candidate” for his great project of experiments, he used her in his most powerful experiment, along with a little boy his network had kidnapped in Australia, only a year older than her. But he’d never counted on Bastet, as he’d named her, to come to love him as a daughter would love her father. He never expected Bastet to become his daughter, for him to fall so helplessly in love with her, for him to feel that sacred bond with her that only a parent can feel. She became Bastet Alexia Blackthorne, simply because she was the bearer of an untainted heart which glowed with kindness and love, and he was losing the will to continue with his grand project.</p><p>Eventually, Bastet would be old enough to understand what the man she considered to be her father was doing with his life, and she would hate him for it. He’d never intended to become a parent, but now that he had a daughter, he couldn’t bear the thought of losing her, even if that meant turning away from what he had thought was the most important thing in his life. He would gladly give up his life’s work, if he could keep her with him, if he could be honest with her and show her how he’d come to embrace what he had felt was an all-consuming darkness work on those experiments, and how she had been the one to lead him back into the light.</p><p>He hoped that she would understand but couldn’t blame her if she hated everything about his very existence once she learned the truth. He had now come to loathe and hate what he had once been, and all it had taken to change him was the complete and unconditional love of a perfect little heart. Others might say he’d gone soft, but he knew the truth, she had given him the strength and courage to begin to stand up to his demons and he was going to grab this opportunity with both hands.</p>
<h3 align="center">*~*~*</h3><p>Prime Minister John Major was taking some time to relax a little in the wake of what had been a somewhat bitter and damaging row in the Conservative Party, which he had sought to resolve by demanding that the Party “put up or shut up”, otherwise known as the “back me or sack me” approach or “manoeuvre”. As far as he could tell, his re-election as Leader of the Conservative Party had not dealt with the problems that continued to dog his Premiership.</p><p>It was in this frame of mind that the Prime Minister read the latest of a series of reports, all contained in purple folders and transmitted to him through the box known as “Old Stripey”, a despatch box in blue leather with a red horizontal stripe across its middle. They laid out a series of problems and criminal activities, that he could see would become a huge scandal, especially the abductions of young children under three years of age.</p><p>The Prime Minister was simply aghast at what was going on, but he was reassured slightly because the perpetrators were being hunted down by the appropriate authorities who would no doubt, throw the book at whoever was responsible. In the meantime, this was a continuing source of fear and panic for the public, as some of the horrors of these cases became more publicly known.</p><p>It was these details which continued to frighten and shock the public, as it became evident that a group of scientists and alchemists, led by a rather nasty megalomaniac, had decided that they had the right to play God with the lives, minds, and bodies of a number of small children. Cain Blackthorne wanted an army of scientifically and alchemically enhanced super soldiers, to serve his purpose of global conquest. However, Blackthorne himself seemed to be losing his enthusiasm for his project, some speculated that this was because he had effectively gained an adopted daughter.</p><p>John Major thought of how his own experiences of fatherhood had changed him irreversibly and wondered what that might do to someone like Blackthorne. It seemed from some of the reports that the presence of this child was leading the alchemist away from the darkness he had so readily embraced. The Prime Minister earnestly hoped that whatever light was leading him away from his dark path, would succeed in bringing him towards his own redemption.</p>
<h3 align="center">*~*~*</h3><p>Escaping had been a mistake, he was certain that Voldemort’s sympathisers had deliberately let him know that they had his daughter, in East Timor, just to lure him out. They were gambling on his ability to get out of the prison facilities used by his Australian hosts and using the ongoing crisis around the independence referendum in East Timor as a shield for their own violent activities.</p><p> Blackthorne knew he had to raise what was left of his network of associates and contacts to be able to rescue Bastet, he needed a loyal gang at his back if was going to pull his daughter free of the Death Eaters clutches. He knew what they wanted, could his methods be used to bring their master back. He’d spent two years sitting in prison contemplating what precisely it was that he had done, in that time Bastet had been placed with a foster family in the UK. Apparently, they had not been capable of protecting the most precious jewel ever to enter his life, as the Death Eaters had found and kidnapped her. He felt as though he was being treated to a very healthy dose of poetic justice, that he was now being given a very good idea of what he and his associates had put the families of those they kidnapped through.</p><p>He had planned his confrontation with Voldemort’s sycophants as meticulously as possible, but he knew he might still have to watch them kill his daughter if he screwed this up. He had exhausted his network in raising his rescue force, and some had made it clear that this would be the last favour they would ever give him, especially in the wake of the dismantling of his project network and how that was done. He’d put a great many noses out of joint, however the fruits of his project if they could be called that were now securely hidden away, and he’d thrown many associates under the bus, to reduce his own sentence.</p><p>Most of the people he had taken into his organisation were not really anyone he could really consider either as friends or loyal associates. This was mostly since he had favoured the idea of scouring orphanages for “candidates” for the project, but those who were asked to find “candidates” often simply resorted to kidnappings. He had expressed his displeasure with this forcefully, but still made use of a small number of the abducted “candidates”, which meant they took it as a tacit acceptance of their methods. He made it clear when he surrendered to the Australian Federal Police, that he had not ordered or organised any abductions, and he tried to dissuade his associates from carrying them out. The Police were not at all sympathetic to his assertions but warmed to his defence as the others he turned over to them were captured and interviewed.</p><p>When it had become clear that certain members of his organisation were going to continue to experiment on abductees, Blackthorne called it quits. He had sunk eight years of all-out effort, from 1988 to 1996, into this enterprise. He had emptied the two vaults full of gold he had spent fourteen years carefully building up to fund this endeavour, but then twenty-two years after he left Hogwarts and Ravenclaw Tower to prove to the world that he was the greatest master of the magical arts, sciences and alchemy the world would ever see, he had abandoned his grand project.</p><p>And now he was in East Timor to face a ragtag collection of Death Eaters, their hangers on, and many of those formerly part of his organisation he had burned. As he and his small posse of allies moved through the jungle only one thought crystallised in his mind, his daughter is getting out of here alive, even if he doesn’t.</p><p>Bastet. Will. Be. Safe.</p>
<h3 align="center">*~*~*</h3><p>Senior Auror Alan Buckland had large and very grave doubts about the operation his superiors in the Australian Federal Police had assigned him to. The whole scheme seemed completely hair-brained, allow Cain Blackthorne to escape to rescue his daughter, so that they could catch the really nasty bastards who had been involved in his “project”. It sounded to him like a very good way of getting people killed, including Bastet. He also understood that if Bastet dies, Cain will lose all rational faculties and likely descend into a madness so complete and consuming that no-one will be able to stop him from taking whatever revenge he would feel he is owed.</p><p>Buckland had always opposed any operation plan which relied on a parent trying to protect their child, because if the shit hits the fan, that parent will lose all ability to be reasoned with and may lash out in their moment of pain or grief. Alan knew exactly why, he had a young family of his own, he knew that parents were capable of anything when protecting and defending their children. And he knew that when a parent lashes out in despair, no target is off limits except their young. Buckland knew one thing for certain about this op, Bastet must be kept safe and alive, without injury, or Cain would lose his rag permanently.</p><p>The squad of AFP Aurors deployed for this operation were preparing for the confrontation, hoping that the whole meeting wouldn’t be stumbled on by any INTERFET forces, as to their minds that was going to be a sure-fire way of getting people killed. They were ready and in place, now all they could do was wait, execute the plan and hope that would be enough to ensure their success.</p>
<h3 align="center">*~*~*</h3><p>Prime Minister John Howard sat in his study at Kirribilli House carefully reading and re-reading the purple bound reports on what was now referred to as Operation Rosewood, the affairs relating to capturing and prosecuting Cain Blackthorne and his associates. The Prime Minister found himself in an invidious position, two diggers lay dead and several others had been wounded in the wake of the final confrontation of the operation, and the AFP team had suffered some serious injuries. But Cain and Bastet Blackthorne were alive and Cain’s secrets were going to stay exactly where the alchemist had buried them, plus the authorities had finally captured the real masterminds behind the kidnappings and had ripped the guts out of the remnants of Lord Voldemort’s support network, especially the international arms.</p><p>The recommendations of several agencies that had reported their views to both himself and his counterpart Prime Minister Tony Blair had been handed to him to consider. The Attorney-General’s Department, Department of Magical Affairs, the Home Office, and the Ministry of Magic had all been arguing their piece with none of them able to agree on any course of action for the Blackthorne case. Only a recommendation from Australian Federal Police Senior Auror Alan Buckland dealt with all the critical dangers whilst remaining coherent, instead to devolving into various adventures in planning attempts at witness protection or a completely new identity for Bastet.</p><p> The major hitch in any plans to hide her using a new identity being that Bastet was extremely easy to identify, even if you were to artificially alter the most readily changeable aspects of her physical appearance, just where do you hide a young girl like that? Especially one who would not be of any genetic relation to the family she would have to be placed with. And then there was the problem that in order to make any story like that stick, various government agencies would have to illegally falsify or alter official records.</p><p>No, far better in Auror Buckland’s opinion, to go with the plan proposed by Cain Blackthorne himself: to let Bastet go with her father to some remote spot in the United Kingdom; straighten out the official records so that legally she is Bastet Alexia Blackthorne, adopted daughter of Cain; let Cain’s convictions stand whilst waiving the sentences, so he can personally protect his daughter; support the scholarship fund Cain had begun to set up to allow victims of his experiments to get a magical education, they would be offered the opportunity to go to Hogwarts if they wanted; use the confiscated resources of everyone captured to compensate victims and their families and provide funds for scholarships; and leaving the vault set up as a trust fund for Bastet and another containing some limited resources for Cain to support himself and his daughter unconfiscated.</p><p>Both Prime Ministers were inclined to accept the basics of this plan with some additions, principally, that the Ministry of Magic would be deemed negligent of their responsibilities and would effectively be charged with this if the Ministry or its officials did anything to interfere with the terms of the agreement. And to make this more complicated for the Ministry, Albus Dumbledore the headmaster of Hogwarts stated that he would not eject any students who came to his school as a result of the scholarship, unless the Minister for Magic gave the order personally. It was then also decided that giving such an order would break the agreement. The Prime Ministers also decided that the authorities should be keeping tabs on the Blackthornes, ensuring their safety and protection against anyone seeking retribution, but otherwise leave them alone. Any moves by the Ministry to arrest or incarcerate him, or any attempt to manipulate him through his daughter would break the agreement, and any failures to protect them would also break the agreement.</p><p>Now two months after the confrontation, John Howard had to give his governments final approval for this plan. He had strong objections from all the departments involved, they favoured prosecuting and hopefully banging up all the guilty parties, without fear or favour. But that would leave a very traumatised and frightened child vulnerable to serious harm. Try as they might to argue that the law and justice demanded that Cain Blackthorne go back to prison, they could not guarantee the safety and wellbeing of Bastet with Cain banged up. In the end all the agencies agreed, although reluctantly, that they had to put Bastet’s interests first, they had a vulnerable child who needed protection and that trumped all other considerations. John Howard, Tony Blair, and Millicent Bagnold signed the agreement, and began to put this whole business behind them.</p>
<h3 align="center">*~*~*</h3><p>The mountains of England’s Peak District have provided good cover for the Blackthornes for the past four years, and no-one really suspected that Cain had kept his secrets as close to hand as he had done, or that he and Bastet were holed up somewhere well away from the magical community. Bastet was seen as nothing more than the local victim of those terrible people who abducted and experimented on children, thankfully the name Blackthorne had passed out of the public memory of muggles, obscured by the names of the scientists who could be firmly identified.</p><p>To Cain, Bastet seemed to be taking everything in her stride, she was doing well at primary school despite the occasional bullying incident, and her apparent lack of many close friends. But he was starting to suspect that she was, well, haunted by the differences she could so starkly see between herself and the other children. She had begun to ask questions about her birth parents and wondered what they had planned to name her. He couldn’t answer much; all he could say is that her birth mother had died protecting her and that she had tried to get to his door before she succumbed to her grievous injuries.</p><p>He also told Bastet that he had kept her mother’s things in a box, so that when Bastet was ready, she could try to find the answers he couldn’t give her. He also told her that the locket she wore all the time, everywhere, contained a brilliant golden pearl. This pearl was the result of all he could do to save the memories of the woman who had died on his doorstep, it contained all the intact memories of Bastet’s mother from mere minutes after she had died. It was as though he had taken the complete imprint of her soul and put it into that pearl, not enough to make a horcrux, or create a means of resurrection. But enough so that Bastet might one day have a chance to know a little of her mother.</p><p>The other two questions that Bastet had become fond of lately were:</p><p>‘How did I do that, Daddy?’ after a classic manifestation of accidental magic.</p><p>And, ‘Where will I go after primary school, Daddy?’</p><p>Magic and Hogwarts were clearly calling her to begin her own adventures, but Cain felt that she would be very isolated in the magical community. There was a lot of guilt attached to that, because he felt she would struggle because she carried his name. Her failure might be because of him. He just had to hope she would always be strong.</p><p>But at least he had one more year to think of a way to help her cope with that. He wasn’t sure that either of them would have been ready for Bastet to go to Hogwarts in 2002, thank goodness she was going in 2003.</p>
