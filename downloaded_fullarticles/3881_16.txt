          <div class="userstuff"><p>Teddy Lupin, eleven years old, bright-eyed and rosy-cheeked. He looked up at his godfather. “Harry, who was my father?”</p><p>That was right. Sometimes he forgot the little boy had never known Remus. Harry smiled, though it was a sad smile too.</p><p>“Remus Lupin,” he said slowly, “Was one of the bravest men I’ve ever known. A werewolf, a marauder, and Order of the Pheonix member.”</p><p>Teddy smiled. “That’s cool.”</p><p>“Almost as cool as Professor Longbottom,” Harry added.</p><p>Teddy’s eyes widened. “Whoa! That cool, really?”</p><p>Remus would’ve been proud.</p></div>
