    <p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry stares at the letter in his hands dumbly. The words themselves are simple enough to understand. It’s their implications he is struggling with. They are written on a single sheet of blank parchment, thick and creamy, the kind Andromeda always writes on. The handwriting is slightly shaky and there is a large inkdrop in the corner, spidery lines spreading through the grains of the paper.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Harry, </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>I’ve been having some memory problems lately. I’ve been getting horribly confused. I saw a healer and it was more serious than I first thought. I am to be taken into full time care at St Mungo’s for the foreseeable future. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Will you take care of Teddy for me? I know Dora and Remus would want that more than anything else. I can’t bear for him to go into care. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>I am so sorry, </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Yours, </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Andromeda. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Andromeda and illness are two incongruent images. They go together about as well as brussel sprouts and peanut butter (a combination Ron tried once when they hadn’t been shopping in awhile.) She’s always been so strong and stoic that the idea of her lying in a hospital bed is difficult to picture. What is wrong with her? The letter is so vague. Is it treatable? Fatal? A horrible practical joke?</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Teddy</span>
  </em>
  <span>. Harry loves Teddy more than he thought he could love anyone, fiercely and without reserve. But he is 22 years old, fresh out of Auror training, battle scarred and barely able to do his own laundry without Hermione reminding him. He’s just moved in with Ginny. His life is starting. Kids weren’t part of that picture. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He sits down heavily, wondering what the hell to do next. Hermione, he thinks. Hermione will probably know. She probably has a book. “Stepping up: How to take your role as godfather seriously” or some other nice, easy 101 kind of introduction to parenting. Or not. But she knows things. Things he doesn’t know. Like how the fuck to carry out a nighttime raid when you have to read a bed time story to your four year old adoptive son. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He gets up and goes to throw a handful of floo powder into the grate. But the fire isn’t lit and he’s all run out anyway.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry looks around his tiny apartment gloomily, seeing it for the first time with the eyes of a prospective parent. A tower of unwashed dishes rise from the sink - this is the first full day he’s been home in a week, life consumed by a case involving a string of magical drug overdoses from a powerful hallucinogenic made from some very illegal fermented mushrooms. The coffee table has a patchwork of rings left from glasses and cups. Three unwashed coffee mugs sit in a line. His laundry basket is overflowing and his fridge is empty, his bed unmade and his socks strewn across the floor. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He  will probably get food poisoning soon, he thinks with resignation. He picks up his wand (the one thing that he never loses and actually cares for) and gets to work with some cleaning charms. They have never been a strong-point of his though, and he ends up washing the dishes by hand and stacking them up to dry.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>When the clock reaches 12, he apparates to the coffee-shop where Hermione refuels on her lunch break. It’s a small place in muggle London, not too far from the entrance to the Ministry. They make excellent hot chocolate, thick and creamy and just sweet enough to be nice, but not so sweet it makes your stomach turn when you stand up after finishing it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry sits down in a seat by the window. It’s late November, and far too cold to wait outside, even with a warming charm cast on his coat. Sinking into a squashy sofa, he looks around, drinking in the comforting atmosphere and the Hermione-ness of the place. Several large bookshelves line the walls, filled with muggle paperbacks of all genres. Hermione likes to read them when she gets the chance - her and Ron’s apartment is crammed with books, everything from muggle fantasies with laughable magic systems, to tomes on the history of magical ailments. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Harry?” a concerned voice asks, and he looks up into Hermione’s eyes. Her hair has escaped the bun she has vainly tried to wrestle it into, and it frizzes out like a halo around her head. This either means something exciting has been happening, or she is horribly stressed. Or both. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey,” Harry says, trying to smile and failing. She sits down beside him, dropping her small bag with a heavy clunk that belies its true contents. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What’s wrong?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He hands her the letter wordlessly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well,” she says finally. “That’s a bit vague.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Not the bit about Teddy.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, Harry,” she says, putting a warm hand on his shoulder. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I love him, Hermione. I really do. But I’m not sure I’m cut out to be a father.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Harry,” Hermione says, and her tone of voice forces him to turn and look into her eyes. “You defeated the most evil wizard in recent history. You are capable of anything.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry laughs weakly. “Something tells me that will seem easy compared to parenthood.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Look,” Hermione says practically. “It might not be forever. And you have lots of support - me and Ron will help, of course, and you know Molly would be delighted to help as well - I think she’s getting broody - and there are plenty of support groups for single wizarding parents, you know, after the war a lot of them sprang up.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry nods, knowing that Hermione speaks the truth. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“How will I keep working though?” he says. “Aurors don’t exactly have nine to five jobs, and it’s dangerous work. I can’t do something like that while caring for a four year old.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Take a few weeks off to get settled with Teddy, and then once you have arrangements in place, go back. You are one of their best Auror’s - you could take a year off and still have a job when you get back.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Perks of being the chosen one, huh?” Harry says, a little bitter. He hates to be given things because of his name.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Perk of being good at your job, Harry,” Hermione says, with the patience of someone who knows all of his worries and insecurities. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I had better go and see Andromeda,” Harry says. “I really don’t know what is wrong with her.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Have you noticed anything different lately?” Hermione asks. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry shakes his head. “Nothing that stands out. I haven’t seen them for two weeks though.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Floo me later?” Hermione says. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’ll come over. There is no food in my house,” Harry says. Hermione shakes her head despairingly. Harry holds up his hands in defence. “I’ve hardly been there because of this case. You should know - Ron’s been on it too.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’ve got to go,” she says. “I’ve got a meeting with my publisher this afternoon. I’ll see you later though,” she kisses him on the cheek and gets into the queue. Harry can’t be sure, but he thinks she Confunds the people in the queue in order to skip to the front. She only loses her ethics for coffee. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Andromeda?” Harry calls, unlocking the door with his wand. Teddy’s laughter drifts out from the living room and he can hear the sound of a teaspoon stirring tea. Ordinarily he’d go straight to Teddy and pick him up and tickle him till their shrieks of laughter drew Andromeda into the room, frowning at the racket they made. But today he walks quietly into the kitchen so that he can speak to Andromeda without Teddy hanging onto his leg. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Harry?” she says, turning to face him. There are bags under her eyes and Harry can see the worry hanging over her, a heavy grey shadow pressing her shoulders into a slump. She makes him a mug of tea and they sit at the table. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What happened?” he asks. Andromeda shakes her head. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“They aren’t sure. They think… they think it’s side effects from one of the curses used when me and Ted were tortured. Some kind of a snowball effect, hardly noticeable at first but now it’s speeding up.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Can they fix it?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She just shrugs. “They don’t even know what it is. Doing magic on the mind is dangerous when done by the most skilled of wizards. That death eater who hit me was a bloody buffoon.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Andromeda doesn’t swear often. When she does it reminds him suddenly, painfully, of Tonks. The war fills the room, the oppressive memories seeming to dim the winter sunlight, casting everything in shadow. Moving on is impossible. Every time you think you are fine, dare to believe your wounds are closed, that the pain is going to remain a dull, bearable ache, something else surfaces. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“They are going to run more tests,” she says. “But they aren’t hopeful.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Except for the worry, Harry can’t see any change in Andromeda. She sips her tea carefully, little finger poking out, a throwback to her upbringing. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>But then her eyes glaze over and her mouth goes slack. She mumbles something incoherent. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Andromeda?” Harry says urgently. She doesn’t respond. Her eyes are moving around with wild fear yet the subject of her terror is not in the room. She is somewhere else entirely. Her hand goes slack and the teacup falls before Harry can stop it, lukewarm tea pooling on the wooden table. Andromeda falls quiet and Harry can hear the steady drip as drops of tea splash onto the tiles. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He doesn’t know what to do. That is all he can think about, in that moment. How utterly helpless he is, how powerless he is against this. He clenches his fists, digging his nails into the soft skin of his palms until the pain calms him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And then she is back. She looks at him, a little dazed, and carries on talking about St Mungo’s. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>No wonder she can’t care for Teddy. Harry hopes he has never seen his grandmother like that. But Andromeda doesn’t seem to be completely aware of what is going on. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“They are worried I’ll become dangerous,” she says, matter of factly. It’s only the tightness at the corners of her mouth that show the emotion she feels beneath.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry puts an arm around her and her shoulders shake as she leans on him. He can feel how frail she is beside him, can feel the points of her elbows beneath the loose robes she is wearing. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s OK to be scared,” he says. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m not scared,” she replies, voice hard. “I’m angry.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We’ll fix it.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She looks at him sternly. “You will take care of my grandson and let the healers fix it. Don’t you go anywhere near my head with that wild magic of yours.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry opens his mouth in outrage. She raises a finger to shush him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Do you want me to take Teddy today?” he asks, instead of defending himself. Andromeda slumps. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes. I think that will be best.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“He’s going to be fine,” Harry promises. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“And you?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry takes a deep breath. “And I’ll be fine too. We’ll all be fine, OK?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Denial is a wonderful thing, Harry thinks, as he heads into the living room to try and explain the situation to Teddy. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“A kid?” Ginny says, wrinkling her nose. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Not “a kid”” Harry says, making quotation marks with his fingers and failing to disguise his irritation. “Teddy Lupin. My godson. Who needs me to care for him.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m only 21,” she says. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“And?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ginny shakes her head. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m not up for kids, Harry.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m not proposing we have children, Ginny. I’m telling you that Teddy is my responsibility. I’m asking for your help.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ginny looks down at her hands, twisted together in her lap, and Harry knows the answer before she says it. He knew it when he read the letter, really. But he hoped maybe it would be different. He looks at her before she says the words, with his last hope heavy in his mouth in the form of a million sentences asking her to change her mind. The sun is setting and her hair burns, the way it did when the light caught it in Gryffindor tower on the day of their first kiss. She is beautiful and wild and absolutely not ready for motherhood. And, unlike him, she has a choice. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m sorry, Harry. It’s my first season with the Harpies. My career is taking off. I can’t be tied down like that. There’s so much I want to do, want to see…” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry bites his lip, swapping emotion for pain.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“…I always thought it would be you,” she said. “I imagined it.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You can have that,” he says. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Our own kids, Harry. When we were ready.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I can’t wait for you to be ready,” Harry says. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ginny nods, and a tear slides down her cheek. Harry clenches his fist to stop himself from brushing it away. He doesn’t know how he is going to get used to looking at Ginny differently. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Goodbye, Harry,” she whispers, leaning across the table to give him one last, lingering kiss. Harry closes his eyes and when he opens them he is alone in the room, lit with blue twilight. </span>
</p><p><br/>
<span>Time to go and collect Teddy. </span>
