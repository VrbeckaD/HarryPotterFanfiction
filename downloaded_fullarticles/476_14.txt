    <p>Chiron sighed as he looked at the demigods assembled in front of him.  </p>
<p>“You want us to what?” Percy demanded, “We’ve had two wars recently and we are still recovering from them and you want us to dive right back into one with a bunch of wizards/witches who are pretty much stuck in the Middle Ages and the majority don’t believe their opponent exists?”</p>
<p>Privately, you thought that Percy had summed it up perfectly – on your right, Annabeth looked like she agreed with Percy.  Not that she’d ever admit that.</p>
<p>Chiron rubbed his temples as his tail swished back and forth. “Essentially that is true, Percy and the only reason I am asking this of you is because an old friend of mine sounded pretty desperate when he contacted me asking for help.”</p>
<p>“Is that the only reason, Chiron?” Clarisse demanded.</p>
<p>Chiron looked uneasy, “The other part of the reason is that there are some demigods at Hogwarts.”</p>
<p>“What?!” Everyone present echoed.</p>
<p>“Haven’t their godly parents claimed them yet?” You asked.</p>
<p>Chiron looked at you evenly, “Some have and they are being protected.  There are a few who don’t know who they are.  The demigods that do know who their godly parent is come here in their holidays.”</p>
<p>“What’s our cover?” Annabeth asked.</p>
<p>“You will be student teachers however, you will need to be Sorted into Hogwarts’ houses so you can better connect with the students.”</p>
<p>“I’m in.” Annabeth said.</p>
<p>“Annabeth!” Percy exclaimed.</p>
<p>“Count me in! You and Clarisse replied at the same time.</p>
<p>“(NAME)!” Percy yelled.</p>
<p>“I suppose I can come along as well.” Nico commented.</p>
<p>Piper grinned, “I’d love to go.”</p>
<p>“Do you want me to say it?  Fine, I’m in.” Percy grumbled.</p>
<p>“Excellent.  I shall inform Professor Dumbledore of your arrival.  You will leave in the morning.”</p>
<p>You all walked out of the Big House with Percy grumbling right behind you, “Who names a school Hogwarts anyway?  Did they see a hog with warts and decide that was a good name for a school?  I wonder if they were high.”</p>
<p>You hung back and punched Percy on the shoulder, “For your information, demigods created that school with the blessing of my mother and no, none of them were high.”</p>
<p>Percy looked sheepish, “I keep forgetting that your mother is Hecate.”</p>
<p>“Shellfish face.” You muttered as you ran to catch up to Annabeth.</p>
<p>“HEY THAT’S OFFENSIVE TO SHELLFISH!” Percy yelled after you.</p>
