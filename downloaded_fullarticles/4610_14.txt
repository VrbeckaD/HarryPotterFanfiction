    <p>Some people were mean drunks.  Some people were clumsy drunks.  Some people were violent when inebriated.  Some were happy.  Some were maudlin.  Some could be an exhausting mix of all of the above.  Some were chatty.  Some clammed up.  Some were hyperactive.  Others fell asleep.  No matter the result, Hermione found it a fascinating phenomenon.  Observing someone while they drank and slowly – or quickly, depending on the rate of consumption – transformed into their “alcoholic alter ego” as she referred to it.  </p>
<p>Ultimately, some dominant or recessive aspect of their psyche would come to the drunken fore and she was fixated on watching the process.  Loved deducing the clues it gave about their inner thoughts.  Figuring out how this new information factored in and changed her overall perception of the person.  But, she was a magical psychologist, after all.  It was a new field and she was a bit of a pioneer in it, really.  Part of the vanguard.  Hard work but very rewarding, etc.  But - casually observing her friends, former classmates and teachers, strangers and fellow Order members celebrate New Year’s Eve during a party beginning to slide from polite chit chat whilst sipping wine to raucous laughter while throwing back shots – this was sublimely engrossing.</p>
<p>Minerva’s pinched, stoic expression bloomed into a mischievous grin to match sparkling eyes as she began making cutting, passive-aggressive (and hilarious) remarks to whomever she was speaking thanks to the aid of sherry.  Helped along by elf-made wine, Fleur Delacour, veela-extraordinaire, morphed into a clingy, needy, and unfortunately, shrill, woman-child who repelled all men but her husband.  Who, in turn, became a docile enabler by drinking too much dark ale.  Firewhiskey made Ron, Harry, Seamus, and Ginny regress into pubescent and loud rough-housing kids.  Emboldened by magical mead, Arthur became a bit of a lech, only interested in goosing and groping a giggling Molly as she led him on a merry chase around the room.  Well, that explained their large brood.</p>
<p>Luna was a particularly interesting case in that the more she drank, the more downright lucid she became.  Hermione wondered if Luna might let her examine some of that fermented flower wine she insisted on drinking to discover what kind of properties it possessed.  Maybe it could cure Alzheimer’s.  Lucid Luna, who knew it was even possible?  Flitwick pranced around and giggled at everything even when inappropriate.  Kingsley stumbled up to one group after another, looking for approval for his newest initiative and constantly second-guessing himself.  Others flowed in and out of the library at Grimauld Place, arguing, canoodling, whispering, and flirting.  Hermione sat in a darkened corner sipping gin, taking it all in with a thoroughly satisfied expression on her face.</p>
<p>And then there was Severus Snape, former professor and now founder/owner of Versus Ventures, a multi-national conglomerate currently revolutionizing the world of health potions by melding Muggle science and Magic.  She’d heard there were divisions other than Health.  Rumors that he was was working with the Ministry to develop “things.”  She wished she could ask him about his work.  It promised to be absolutely fascinating but she would not admit that to him.  He had enough money, sycophants, and self-confidence as it was.  He didn’t need her input.  They’d not been in contact much since the war.  They were often at the same gatherings and events but rarely interacted one on one and their group discussions were perfunctory at best.</p>
<p>She had saved him from certain death in the Shrieking Shack that day and had no desire to plumb the depths of his resentment towards her.  Though his life seemed perfect and prosperous now, she wasn’t foolish enough to think he didn’t harbor some anger at her intervention.  He was a man who liked control, due to his relative lack of it over his own life for so long, and he did not care to be beholden to anyone anymore.  She could respect that, so she acted as if it had never happened.  She was also a little wary of him.  He’d always possessed an air of intellectual danger about him – the worst kind – and she didn’t relish becoming the object of his ire.  And there was something magnetic about his presence that was unnerving.  An undefinable charisma.  Better to view him from afar, like now.  </p>
<p>He was holding an unknown quaff and moving elegantly about the room, never staying in one place too long.  Eventually, he sat down on the far side of the room and began observing the group just as she was.  She wondered why he was alone tonight.  He usually escorted some lovely bit of eye-candy, though never the same one twice.  It was strange to think of the perpetual loner, Snape, now a sought after bon-vivant.  Well, maybe bon-vivant was a little much, she thought with a smile as she continued to watch him sip his drink.  Dark and mysterious man-about-town suited him better.  </p>
<p>She was softly giggling to herself at her musings when Harry and Ron stumbled over pleading with her to play a game of Strip Exploding Snaps with what seemed to be more than half of the guests.  She laughed out loud at the thought of so much revealed flesh by so many, wished them the best of luck, and promised to play later after she’d had more liquid courage.  Like there was a chance in hell of that happening.  Mollified by her words, they made their way around the room trying to gather any stragglers to play.  </p>
<p>She’d just freshened up her drink and retaken her seat in anticipation of what promised to be an unforgettably embarrassing game when her vision was blocked by a wall of unrelenting black.  Raising her eyes, she was unsurprised to see Severus Snape hovering over her with a calculated sneer on his face.  What was his purpose, she thought lazily.  He never willfully sought her out at these events.  Well, if it got too tedious or tense, she could always excuse herself to move closer to the game.  </p>
<p>“May I have the honor of sitting with you, Dr. Granger?”  The sarcastic emphasis on honor almost made her snort aloud.  She bit back a smile and tipped her head to the other armchair in invitation.  He sat with a flourish of dark robes swirling.  And said nothing.  Just pinned her with a calculating look.  Just how drunk was he and, more importantly, what kind of drunk was he?  She supposed she was about to find out.  With an internal smirk, she realized he was probably about to find out what kind of drunk she was, too.</p>
<p>While she retained some of her dominant traits when drinking, other rather unexpected ones rose to the surface as well.  While she tended to be moderately pleasant, quiet and detached with an internal monologue whirring in analytical mode non-stop, her usual curiosity ratcheted up to an insatiable level, she tended to lose her ‘filter’ when pressed and could be ruthlessly uncaring about what other people thought.  A definite change from the norm.  And she cursed.  A lot.  Oh well.  Fuck it.</p>
<p>He was still just staring at her as if daring her to speak.  How odd, had she done something to offend him?  No matter, she could mutely watch him all night.  He had approached her, after all.  He could spit it out or continue to sit there like a statue; it didn’t really matter to her.  He was a very interesting subject so she began studying him.  Shiny black, pointy boots beneath perfectly tailored wool pants.  The fabric looked so soft she was tempted to run her hand along his leg just to feel it.  He seemed so tense she thought he might explode if she did.  Better not then.  Buttons.  So damn many buttons, glinting from his shoes, ankles, legs, arms, neck, and chest.  What did they symbolize for him?  He’d changed his hair, it was shorter with layers.  Nice.  He seemed younger than when she had started Hogwarts but maybe that was the lack of daily, bone-crushing stress.  Or maybe it was one of his wonder potions.  She really needed to try them out if this was the result.  He looked good she thought nodding to herself with a half-grin.  After her languid perusal of him, she finally lifted her eyes to his to find him looking somewhat perplexed and offended.  What?  It wasn’t like she was checking him out...much.  His generation of wizards could be so prudish and she couldn’t resist an eye-roll.</p>
<p>“What do you think you’re doing, Dr. Granger?”  He was plainly primed for some kind of confrontation.  Itching for it really.  Alright, she was amenable.  It seemed an amusing way to pass the time for now.</p>
<p>“Hmmm, I *think*, Mr. Snape, that I’m sitting here waiting for you to let loose whatever it is on the tip of your tongue.  If you have something you feel compelled to say, pleaasssee, don’t let me stop you.”  She practically simpered as she drawled that last bit and knew it would quicken his temper.  Let the games begin.</p>
<p>He drew in a sharp breath and continued, “the great Hermione Granger, perched on her throne, viewing us as if we’re your subjects or, more accurately, your patients.  Judging us.  Cataloguing us.  You think you are superior, don’t you?”</p>
<p>She just stared at him with a knowing, half-smile, silently goading him to continue.</p>
<p>“No great diagnosis for them?”, as he swept his arm towards the room of oblivious revelers.  “No ground-breaking insight to share?”</p>
<p>She giggled at that.  He was practically worked up into a froth.  What was he drinking?  Probably water; being cantankerous had been his default state since she’d known him.  But the glass held a green liquid.  She stared at it wondering on its contents.</p>
<p>“Miss Granger, I am trying to speak with you.  Kindly do me the honor of paying attention.”</p>
<p>“Now why would I do that?”, she practically purred at him.  </p>
<p>This response left him speechless for a split second before he was off again.  “So, playing more games are we?  I’ve come over here to converse and you are willfully ignoring me.  The arrogance!”</p>
<p>“Oh, is that what you were doing”, she replied with a sly smile.  “Please continue.  You have my full attention.”</p>
<p>He almost seemed unsure now, though he fought to hide it with a sour downturn of his mouth.  Clearly, her responses were not what he was expecting.</p>
<p>“No, I implore you, Mr. Snape, I’m overcome with curiosity on what subject you want to converse with me on.  You know...seeing as how we’ve never really conversed before.  It must be something rather pressing and important.”</p>
<p>Her reply being delivered with a mock obsequiousness, his eyes narrowed to slits.  It was almost comical and she barely suppressed a laugh.</p>
<p>“Do you think this is funny, Granger?”  He was seething now.  How delightful.  He so rarely showed honest, uncalculated emotions.</p>
<p>“Funny?”  She turned the word over on her slightly thickened tongue.  “Hmm, tell me more and I’ll let you know.”  She took a drink of her gin and then reached in the glass to remove the lime, squeezing its juices into her mouth as a nice chaser.  She licked her lips of the tangy residue and queried him, “What?  Cat got your tongue?  Come on, get it all out of your system.  Unload, if you like.  It won’t bother me.”</p>
<p>His eyes were now round with possible shock.  She never knew he was capable of this emotion and broke into a wide grin at the realization.  Watching him try to gain control over himself was deeply intriguing.  As if a robot were being rigorously reprogrammed.</p>
<p>Finally, his face wrestled back into an emotionless state, he was settled enough to speak.  “I believe we need to discuss what happened that day...”. </p>
<p>He gave her a look full of some somber meaning which she promptly returned with a “pffft, what about it?  I saved your life.  Lots of people saved lots of lives that day.  You’re either angry or grateful.  To that I can only say, ‘oops, sorry’ or ‘you’re welcome.’ Anything else you wanted to ‘converse’ about?”</p>
<p>She’d shocked him again.  This little game was addicting!  She could lose herself in flummoxing him on a regular basis.  She also had a strong sense of deja vu.  Maybe she’d dreamt about this.  Such a shame she couldn’t remember.</p>
<p>He leaned in closer with an almost pained expression on his face and floored her with his words.  “I am not speaking of that day, Hermione.  I am referring to Halloween.”</p>
<p>Halloween?  Her mind raced back to that night quickly going over what she could remember.  Certainly nothing in particular about him.  There had been a masked costume gala at the Ministry.    She had been doing some research into female archetypes for a paper and had dressed as Lilith on a whim.  Draped in a nude colored body suit, her entire figure encircled by a writhing snake (just a charmed cord), a set of gigantic black wings sprouting from her shoulder blades and her hair transfigured to fall down to her knees, she could see how her choice of costume could have been interpreted as an affront to him but it was nothing personal.  Was he even there?  </p>
<p>“Are you not a fan of Lilith?,” she asked, hoping he’d explain.</p>
<p>“Your costume, though an inspired choice if you wanted to capture my attention, is not the issue.”</p>
<p>“Then, pray tell, what is?!”  She was beginning to feel like she was the object of some prank.  What was he on about?</p>
<p>He leaned in even closer and whispered, “do you really not remember? You’d been drinking but you weren’t drunk.  If you are ashamed of it, tell me now and I’ll never bother you again.  But don’t act as if it never happened.”</p>
<p>A slight panic was rising within her now.  She could tell he was in earnest which meant she was missing something.  Something major.</p>
<p>“What the hell happened!”, she blurted out, louder than she meant to.  They both quickly looked around to see if they were overheard but the game was now in full swing.  </p>
<p>He rose and held a hand out to her.  “Would you accompany me to the parlor?  I believe we have things to discuss that require privacy.”</p>
<p>A tad dazed, she took him up on his invitation as he escorted her out of the loud library and down the hall.  Each step her mind turned over Halloween in her head.  She didn’t remember much.  Costumes, people, laughing, dancing.  She wasn’t sure how it ended.  Her memories just seemed to fade into a swirling mix of music and laughter, drinks and gaiety.  And a hint of a scent, something warm and lush, with undertones of bergamot and orange, maybe.  She breathed deeper.  Sandalwood and musk too.  It was like she could smell the intoxicating scent now and suddenly realized that she was.  It was his scent.  It was wrapped around her now and she knew innately that it had wrapped around her that night too.  What was going on?</p>
