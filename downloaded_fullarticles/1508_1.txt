    <p>The team had been called to the mission room at Mount Justice, why? Dick had no clue other than that it was a mission and that they were needed there urgently. So of course the six teenagers that make up the Young Justice team showed up as soon as they were able and finding the Dark Knight standing in front of the holographic monitors scowling like always. Zatara was surprisingly there as well, and even more surprisingly with Zatanna who greeted them with a feminine wave. They figured Zatanna wouldn’t ever be returning to the cave, let alone for a mission, whatever was being assigned to them was absurd. </p><p>“Soooo… What’s our mission? Or are we just gonna stand here in silence?” Kid Flash asked, though he did receive a batglare on account of the sass. </p><p>“If you had waited you would’ve got your answer about a minute earlier.” He chastised, “You are being assigned onto another reconnaissance mission, infiltration, undercover, and guard. You are to protect an eleven year old boy by the name of Harry Potter while he attends Hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry,” Robin had to hold back snickers at the sight of Wally gaping at that, “located in the United Kingdom and will overall need assist him in any way possible during his first year at Hogwarts.”</p><p>“And why are we needed for this?” Artemis asked, “I mean, why would he need protection?”</p><p>“The headmaster of Hogwarts, Albus Dumbledore, requested it. Harry is being targeted by a dark lord by the name of Voldemort, though more commonly referred to as He Who Must Not Be Named, who is supposedly will be attempting on the boy’s life.”</p><p>“Dark lord? Like Klarion?” Superboy asked quizzically, triggering mutterings around the idea of ‘This guy better not be like Klarion’, which Robin found completely reasonable because that kid was awful.</p><p>“Are we to go undercover as students?” Kalur asked, ever the voice of reason.</p><p>“In a way, but Klarion is a Lord of Chaos not a dark lord. Yes, you will be, which is why Zatara and Zatanna are here. Zatara will be guiding us through the British wizarding world and performing a deaging spell and Zatanna will be accompanying you to make up for the team’s lack of magical ability.”</p><p>“B, what about our civilian lives?” Dick asked his mentor, “We can’t exactly disappear off the face of the Earth.”</p><p>“The League will be taking care of your civilian lives, Robin we’ll discuss your coverup once we get back to the cave.” </p><p>“But how will we be able to protect Harry without using our abilities?” Dick’s focus switched to M’gann as she spoke.</p><p>“You can use your abilities, you just have to be stealthy about it.” Batman sighed, “Are there anymore questions?”</p><p>“The actual mission will begin on September 1st, but we’ll leave tomorrow to get the supplies we’ll need for the mission. You’ll all be going under the guise of being from an American wizarding school by the name of Zatara’s Academy for Alternative Magics, thus avoiding having to abide by the uniform at Hogwarts that way your uniforms will allow you to fight and use your powers and abilities.” Batman continued when there was only silence, Dick watched Bruce as he pulled seven letters from God knows where and handed them the young heroes, Zatanna taking up the space by Megan.</p><p>“You are being warned now that we have yet to make technology usable in the walls of Hogwarts, so you’ll either have to wait until you are out of the barrier or contact us by other means for the time being.” Robin’s face fell at this, and he would be talking to his mentor about this. Technology was kind of his whole thing other than acrobatics and his impeccable ability to butcher the English language.<br/>“Anything else that we need to know?” Asked Wally, his arms crossed over his chest, causing Dick to snicker and earn a glare in return.</p><p>“Actually, yes. You’ll have two weeks to prepare before you are enrolled into Hogwarts, and we expect all of you to do well academically.” Wally fumed at this, causing Robin to have to put a hand over his mouth to muffle his laughter.</p><p>“I don’t even believe in magic, how am I supposed to learn it? It doesn’t exist!” </p><p>“Then you’ll adapt.” Batman glared, “Dismissed. Robin, we’ll be returning to the cave now.” He said beckoned forth the little bird who waved to his fellow heroes as he was herded out via Zeta. The only thought Robin had while he beamed out of Mount Justice, a smile on his face, was that this was going to be one hell of a year.</p>
