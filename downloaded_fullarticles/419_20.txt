  <em>15 December 2006</em>
</p><p>Hermione slammed the door to Harry's flat. He hadn't invited her, but she knew she'd be welcome. She always was.</p><p>She stormed into his sitting room, where she could hear the Wizarding Wireless playing, and found Harry sprawled on the sofa. He stood up immediately, going to her and placing his hands lightly on her arms. "How can I help?"</p><p>Her expression was a mixture of furious and frantic. Harry had been dying to help her for the duration of the trial, but it had been closed to protect her privacy and she hadn't told him much. She'd been hoping to get the issue taken care of without involving him - he would help her, he always would, she knew, but she didn't want to trap him in a situation like this. She couldn't bring herself to do this with anyone else, though. </p><p><em>He </em>had shattered her trust, and opening herself up to anyone at all was difficult. She'd thought she might be able to have a one-off with a stranger in a club - somewhere muggle - and whoever it was would never have to know, but she couldn't bring herself to be in an intimate situation with a stranger right now. Harry, however, with his heart of gold and his savior complex, she could always trust.</p><p>"I'm sorry, Harry," she said desperately. "I need you to fuck me - probably more than once - or I am going to die."</p><p>She watched the emotions flicker across his face. Shock first, confusion next, and - blessedly - hint of arousal. If he hadn't been at least a little intrigued by the thought of having sex with her, she might have chosen to die. She <em>really </em>didn't want to do this to him.</p><p>Gently, Harry guided her to his sofa and urged her to sit down. "Explain it to me?"</p><p>"He cursed me, Harry. A <em>breeder's </em>curse. It's a curse placed on a woman that essentially forces her to become pregnant, over and over again. After each pregnancy there is a sort of refractory period, which becomes slightly longer each time, before the symptoms set in again. Once they do, the target of the curse has about one month to become pregnant before dying of organ failure." Despite the topic, and its immediacy, telling Harry about the details of the curse calmed her. Academic pursuits always did. "The curse can only be removed if it's found within twenty-four hours, and the Healers estimated I'd been cursed a week prior when they discovered it."</p><p>"Is it- permanent, then?" Harry asked hesitantly. Hermione doubted herself for a moment - Harry probably didn't even want this - but she'd let him decide.</p><p>"No, the curse loses power each time. That's why the refractory periods lengthen. The amount of power the healers detected in my curse- they've estimated that it will take six to eight pregnancies for it to burn out. If you don't want to do this, Harry, I won't force you. I'll find a way, I always do." Hermione's voice was more reluctant than she wanted as she offered him a way out, but she still had to say it.</p><p>"I'll help you, Hermione," Harry said earnestly. "You know I would do <em>anything </em>for you. I just want to understand the situation. Can you take fertility potions, to help things along?"</p><p>Hermione shook her head. "I'm allergic to the primary ingredient in the legal ones. That's how I ended up at St. Mungo's and found out about the curse in the first place. I just need to- have a lot of sex."</p><p>"Okay," Harry said evenly, nodding. "Let's get you a bit more relaxed, though. The situation is the furthest thing from ideal, but I want to make this good for you."</p><p>Hermione smiled a bit, and sagged against Harry's side. This was why she knew she could trust him. He'd always take care of her.</p><p>"If he weren't already in Azkaban..." Harry said with a bit of a growl.</p><p>"I know," Hermione said warmly. "You'd probably kill him for me. That's why I waited to tell you."</p><p> </p><p>Harry spent the next half hour or so giving Hermione a full-body massage, to help her unwind. His hands were like <em>magic</em>. Come to think of it, she wasn't entirely sure he wasn't using a wandless warming charm to relax her muscles as he worked. When she was boneless on the sofa, he picked her up in a bridal carry and took her to the bedroom. Seven years as an Auror after the war had done wonders for his strength, she mused.</p><p>He deposited her gently on his bed, and kissed the column of her next below her ear. Hermione sighed.</p><p>"You'll tell me what you like." It wasn't a question. Hermione was always assertive, and she was sure Harry knew that her own pleasure wouldn't be where that assertiveness ended.</p><p>"My neck," she told him, "is always a wonderful place to touch. My breasts aren't as sensitive, so touches to my nipples will need to be rougher. Pinches, or gentle bites. I like a little pain mixed with my pleasure. Hair pulling, scratching. I need clitoral stimulation to finish, but it becomes oversensitive quickly."</p><p>Harry kissed slowly down her neck as she spoke, causing her voice to hitch more than once. "Good," he said with his lips against her collarbone. "I'll make this good for you."</p><p>The shirt she wore was a button-down. Harry must have popped open the first few buttons while she spoke to have access to her collarbones, and he continued now. He moved quickly, but didn't fumble. His movements were confident and sure as he undressed her, even when he found the clasp of her bra. Her trousers followed, and then her knickers, and suddenly she was completely bare before him while he was still fully dressed. "You too," she told him, tugging the hem of his t-shirt upwards. </p><p>Harry knelt over her and made short work of his own clothes before lowering himself over her again. His cock, slightly above average in size but thankfully not intimidating, nestled against the neatly trimmed hair on her mound. He kissed her neck again, gently sucking at a spot just by her jaw. "Do you want to be kissed?" </p><p>"Yes," Hermione breathed. She was glad he'd asked - she hadn't listed it as something she enjoyed, after all, and they weren't typical lovers - but right now she was dying to feel his lips on hers.</p><p>The press of his lips was firm. They were dry, but soft. Slowly, he worked his mouth against hers until she parted her lips to invite his tongue. He licked into her mouth, pressing his tongue to hers and running it along the insides of her teeth. No one had done exactly that to her before, but she liked it. While Harry kissed her, his left hand found her nipple. He traced it with a thumb until it hardened, then pinched lightly.</p><p>Hermione moaned into his mouth. Harry was perfect. Her sex was aching, and he'd barely started. He twisted her nipple back and forth between his thumb and pointer finger, then shifted his weight onto his left hand to give the same attention to her other breast.</p><p>Hermione arched her hips into Harry, pressing her clitoris against his cock and drawing a groan from his mouth. "Please, Harry," she mumbled lowly against his lips, "I'm ready. Please."</p><p>Harry's hand left her breast and gripped his cock, guiding the head into the wet folds between her labia. In one smooth slide, he was fully seated inside of her. Both of them moaned at the sensation. "Gods, Hermione, you're amazing."</p><p>"Move," she begged him.</p><p>Slowly - almost too slowly - he dragged his cock out of her and pressed back in. Gradually, his pace built. It was so gradual, it almost wasn't a noticeable change, but soon enough he was fucking into her at a steady pace. His mouth latched onto her right breast, suckling there and peppering in gentle bites. Hermione moaned, and wrapped her legs around Harry's back. Her heels pressed into his firm arse, urging him on.</p><p>This continued, Harry's mouth traveling over her body to give attention to each of her sweet spots in the most delicious ways. After a few minutes, Harry braced himself on one arm again so that he could bring a hand to her clitoris. The angle must have been awkward, but he rubbed her exposed nub with a thumb while snapping his hips against hers. She was glad he'd waited so that they could finish around the same time without her becoming painfully oversensitive. Harry was a wonderful listener, it turned out, when it came to sex.</p><p>Hermione's orgasm crashed over her in a wave, the muscles of her vagina clenching automatically around Harry's cock as she called out a high-pitched whine. Harry fucked her through it, and just as she started to come down he pressed deep inside of her and groaned out his own release. She felt the warmth of his seed spread inside her, and <em>that </em>was what nearly made her blush. </p><p>Ever considerate, Harry collapsed to the side instead of directly on top of her. He'd never grown overly tall, but she was even more petite, and he was muscled enough to carry her. His weight on top of her would have been uncomfortable. </p><p>Breathing heavily, Hermione groped for her wand and cast a silent spell. It was one she'd cast a hundred times before, but with just a <em>tweak-</em></p><p>Harry gave her a quizzical look, breathing too heavily to ask with words. Hermione took another moment to catch her own breath before speaking. "To help things along. I can't take any potions, but this will keep your semen inside me as I move about. It's technically a contraceptive charm - it creates a barrier that semen can't pass - but I've positioned it lower in my vaginal channel instead of its proper place at the cervix."</p><p>"You're brilliant," he told her quietly as he wrapped an arm around her waist. Hermione cast a gentle cleaning charm for the sweat covering their bodies, and the wet spot beneath her. Harry was a cuddler - she'd expected that, given how tactile he was in any and <em>every</em> situation - and there was no reason for them to be uncomfortable when they had magic.</p><p>In moments, he was asleep, and Hermione allowed herself to be pulled under as well. Typically, she'd be energized after good sex, but she hadn't been sleeping well for the worry, and she was <em>so </em>relaxed.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>16 December 2006</em>
</p><p>Hermione woke in the darkness, a firm body against her back and a hand running up and down her thigh. She was alarmed for just half a second before she remembered that she'd fallen asleep, naked, in Harry's bed. "You're awake?" he asked her. He must have noticed the change in her breathing.</p><p>"Yeah. I see you are, too."</p><p>Harry chuckled, which Hermione felt as a rumble in his chest rather than truly hearing. "I'd like to fuck you again, if you'd like that too."</p><p>Hermione nodded, pressing back against him slightly. Not only did she <em>need </em>to sleep with him again - the chances she was pregnant after only one time were very low, and with only two weeks she wasn't taking any chances - but Harry was a wonderful lover. If he was amenable to it, she wouldn't mind having him again even after her specific needs were met.</p><p>Harry's hand found its way between her legs, and she realized as he touched her that she was already wet. That happened sometimes, when she slept, and at the moment she was glad for it. She could feel the tension in Harry's body that suggested this would be a more vigorous round, and she was eager for it. </p><p>From behind, Harry hitched his elbow under her knee and lifted her leg before sliding his cock inside her. It took a few moments' maneuvering - he couldn't use his hand to position her leg and his own cock at the same time, after all - but he slid inside her just as neatly as before. His cock was a perfect fit inside her, stretching and filling her without becoming painful. </p><p>He didn't start slowly, this time. Harry's hips snapped against hers fiercely, and she cried out as he hit a spot deep inside her with breathtaking force. "Hold your leg here for me," he told her roughly, and she complied.</p><p>Harry's freed hand ran up her back, over the back of her neck, and he threaded his fingers through her hair with a deceptive gentleness. He formed a fist, gathering her hair by her scalp, and yanked back towards him. The sharp tug pulled her head backwards violently, a sharp pain in her scalp, and caused her to cry out in ecstasy. Harry's grip on her hair had also pulled it away from her neck, and his teeth sunk into the flesh there.</p><p>The position Harry had put her in didn't allow her the same level of control she had had on her back - all Hermione could do was hold her leg up and enjoy the ride as Harry gave her pleasure and pain in a cocktail that never failed to drive her out of her head. Her free hand - her only source of control - went to her clitoris and rubbed furiously. This would be a quick fuck, and she was determined to get off with Harry pulling at her curly locks. </p><p>Harry came first, emptying another load of his semen deep into her body, then quickly pulled out and pushed her onto her back. As he lowered his head to her sex, she was about to remind him not to lick away any of his own cum when he latched his mouth onto her clitoris and <em>sucked</em>.</p><p>It was almost too much, and Hermione came with a scream in seconds. </p><p>Harry gentled his mouth until her shuddering subsided, then came up with a cocky grin. "Good?" he asked her smugly.</p><p>"It was great, you bastard," she shot back playfully. </p><p>Hermione grabbed her wand again from the bedside table and recast her modified contraceptive charm. It only lasted about eight hours per casting, and she had no clue how long they'd slept. She could check the time, but she hadn't looked before falling asleep so it would only be a rough estimate anyways.</p><p>Harry looked well-rested, and Hermione felt the same, so they must have slept at least most of the night. "Stay here," he told her, "I'll bring in breakfast."</p><p> </p><p>It had been Friday when Hermione had gone to Harry, and neither of them were working weekend shifts this week or had anyone to see urgently, so they spent the weekend in. For nearly three days, they stayed in Harry's flat and fucked at every opportunity. They fucked in every position they could imagine, hard and fast or slow and tender, and Harry ensured that Hermione came at least once every time.</p><p>Hermione recast her charm every time they had sex, trapping Harry's semen inside of her. She didn't think they'd gone eight hours without yet, except possibly while sleeping, and they could both tell. There was no visible bulging - that would have taken a truly immense amount of cum - but she could feel the excess fluids inside of her as she moved. Harry could feel it too, each time he entered her. It didn't feel exactly like her wetness, he said - there was a thicker consistency, and a bit of pressure back on him when he thrust in - and it was extremely erotic.</p><p>Sometimes he would warm her up or finish her off with his mouth, but he insisted she didn't suck him. "I might come too quickly, with that wonderful mouth I can tell you've got, and we don't want to waste a load when I'm the one who needs to recover between rounds."</p><p>"Maybe I'll give you a 'thank you' blowjob once I'm pregnant, then," Hermione had told him in return.</p><p>Between rounds of sex, Harry seemed to delight in taking care of Hermione. Typically she would want more independence, but the ordeal with this curse and the trial had taken a lot out of her physically and emotionally, and for now it was nice to have Harry cooking for her and drawing her baths. She wouldn't be able to stand this level of care-taking long term, but for the three days Hermione spent in Harry's flat it was a sweet indulgence.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>18 December 2006</em>
</p><p>On Monday morning, both had to return to work. Harry had his regular shifts at the Aurors, and Hermione was working in prosecution with the DMLE. Each day when they finished at the Ministry, they'd find each other again in his flat. Hermione still slept there at nights, after Harry had asked Kreacher to be in charge of fetching her clothes and toiletries.</p><p>On Wednesday, Hermione was feeling daring, and invited Harry to her office for a lunchtime shag. If they were caught, she could probably get out of trouble claiming medical necessity. Her direct boss, the head prosecutor, had handled <em>his </em>trial and therefore knew all about the situation with her curse.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>23 December 2006</em>
</p><p>As anxious as she was, Hermione waited to perform a pregnancy test until Friday, a full week after she'd gone to Harry for help. It took five to six days for a fertilized egg to implant and begin a pregnancy, she knew, so any earlier would only be wishful thinking. The healers had taught her the appropriate charm, so she'd be able to test herself without coming in, and had her practice it on the charmed training mannequins until she could determine a pregnancy with 100% accuracy. It wouldn't do, after all, for her to die because of a false positive.</p><p>Despite waiting until Friday to confirm, however, Hermione was fairly certain the symptoms of the curse began to alleviate on Thursday. Progressively worsening muscle weakness, chills, and aches had been plaguing her for three weeks now, and Thursday was the first day she was able to get out of bed without groaning in pain.</p><p>Harry was there with her when she cast the charm, and her abdomen glowed with a strong blue light. She looked at him with an odd expression. "It's positive."</p>
