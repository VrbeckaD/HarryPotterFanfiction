    <p> </p><p> </p><p>They had turned on him. Again. Really by now he should have expected it. At the slightest thought that he was going Dark, that he was learning magic they didn’t approve of, they turned on him. He’d been lax, letting his guard down. Trusting them again, how it was biting him now. He stood behind his bars, staring out into the black of the prison with grim eyes and a cold, depreciating smile. His green eyes were nearly black now, hair in matted tangles that fell past his waist. The guards had taken his glasses away, an attempt to break him by reducing him to fuzzy vision.</p><p>They had tried so hard to break him, these guards. Really, it was quite pitiful. <em>He</em> had been pitiful at the beginning, screaming in agony as they broke his bones and cast endless rounds of the Cruciatus Curse upon his malnourished body. And then one of the guards had decided to get <em>physical, </em>wanting to contact of breaking bone and marking his skin with his fists. He’d been fourteen the first time one of them had extended the physical punishment to include rape.</p><p>He was seventeen now, a legal adult if he’d been in the wizarding world. Sentenced to Azkaban prison at twelve, he’d not bothered to watch the passage of time more than Cornelius Fudge’s yearly review. Every time the cowardly little man in his bowler hat came by, he’d promised himself someday he would see that man screaming on the floor as he had been. Sentenced with life in medium security for murder at twelve, he’d spent the entire time in maximum security.</p><p>At first the Dementors had been hell, reducing him to a sobbing ball on the floor every time they went by. Soon though, the prisoner next to him had realized who he was and wriggled through his bars as a skinny, emaciated dog, curling up at his side. His name was Sirius Black and he was his godfather, illegally imprisoned for betraying Harry’s parents to the Dark Lord in November of 1981.</p><p>Because of course, his name was Harry James Potter. Boy-Who-Lived, Savior, yada yada. Most recently his title had been <em>murderer, traitor, scum</em> or to the guards, <em>whore.</em> They hadn’t touched him in two years, ever since he’d used ‘accidental’ magic to render one man permanently impotent. Harry laughed darkly remembering the man’s terrified, enraged face when he realized what had happened. The beating he’d gotten had been worth it.</p><p>Of course his magic wasn’t accidental at all. When some of his fellow inmates had realized how strong his magic was, they had teamed up to teach him wandless magic, how to focus his will to make his magic do what he wanted it to. They had also taught him Occlumency and when they realized he was doing it unconsciously, Legilimency. He was a natural at the latter, which made learning the former just that much harder. He’d persevered, forcing himself to learn how to control his mind and lock away his thoughts.</p><p>Oh the horror Dumbledore would feel now, knowing that he’d been taught wandless magic and mind magic as well as others by convicted Death Eaters and the man who had supposedly betrayed his parents. The shock might just kill him. <em>We could only hope,</em> Harry thought darkly.</p><p>The atmosphere had been electric in the prison for the past several weeks, ever since the Death Eater’s marks had grown dark and fresh-looking, meaning that Voldemort was once again amongst them. Harry wasn’t nearly as conflicted as he thought he would feel. Yes, the man had killed his parents. Yes he had tried to kill Harry. But quite frankly, it was war.</p><p>Harry’s parents had made their choice, choosing to fight instead of worrying about their new family. They hadn’t even gone into hiding until after he was born, both actively fighting until Lily’s pregnancy was too far gone for her to use magic. Bitterly Harry realized that if they had cared about him just a bit more, they wouldn’t have risked their lives fighting in the first place. Their sheer lack of planning made him angry as well, because of them Sirius had suffered because no one had known about the switch.</p><p>Harry was certain that Sirius’ viewpoint had shifted as well, as soon as he had appeared in the prison. It had been hard enough for the man being tossed aside when he’d done everything he could to protect his brother in all but blood. Seeing his twelve-year-old godson dragged in like a piece of filth and tossed into a cell to rot had to have broken any last remnants of his restraint. He knew the man had been plotting for years what he was going to do to the guards that had hurt Harry. Harry let him plot, it kept him occupied and a bored Sirius Black was a dangerous thing.</p><p>Night fell, the day shift guards left and the night ones started their rounds. These were Harry’s tormentors, the ones who had made his life even more miserable for five years. He licked his dry, chapped lips and retreated to the back wall of his cell, under the tiny barred window that looked out into the perpetual storms that seemed to surround Azkaban prison thanks to the Dementors’ presence. One of the creatures floated by his cell and Harry stared at it from underneath long, sooty lashes with narrowed eyes.</p><p>They had long since stopped affecting him. Sure they made him bitterly cold as they floated by, but he hadn’t been affected by them in years, ever since he’d perfected his Occlumency barriers. He could vaguely hear his mother screaming if he concentrated, otherwise they were an inconvenience more than anything.</p><p>The night passed in its slow, dismal fashion, someone in another cell occasionally shrieking in their sleep as a Dementor passed. Harry remained awake, sitting in the back of his cell. He’d started sleeping in the day and remaining awake at night, he wasn’t as concerned with the daylight guards as these <em>people.</em> No, turning his back on them was like trusting a wild animal to sleep in your bed.</p><p>There was a terrifically loud <em>boom,</em> the floor under Harry’s feet shaking. He shot to his feet, staying against the wall. Soon screaming reached his ears and flashes of spells lit the dark walls. Raising his fingers, he sent a little <em>zap</em> of his magic into the next cell to wake Sirius, the man could sleep like the dead.</p><p>“I’m awake,” Sirius grunted, “what the hell was that noise?”</p><p>“Don’t know,” Harry whispered, voice hoarse. “Doesn’t sound like it’s good for the guards though.”</p><p>Sirius practically growled. “Don’t care about them, most of them deserve it.”</p><p>Harry snorted; the sound painful on his dry throat. They hadn’t had water in days aside from what dribbled down the stone walls of their cells from the biting rain.</p><p>Silence fell, eerie in the sheer completeness of the sound. Even the rain had fallen silent, the perpetual pounding on the outside walls ceasing. Straining his ears, he heard the soft sound of voices, a creaking sound of rusted iron swinging open. He extended his magic out cautiously, sending it seeking for the cause. It hit a thing of smothering <em>darkness,</em> something that was swallowing the light around it and absorbing magic in infinite amounts.</p><p>Retracting his magic, Harry said quietly, “I think the Dark Lord is here. I haven't met him before, but that presence is unlike anything I’ve ever felt.”</p><p>Sirius was quiet next to him, but he heard the hitch of the man’s breath.</p><p>Harry cautiously gathered his magic around him, pushing away from the wall. He extended his aura a bit, readying his mental shields. His magic became visible, lazily swirling around his hands and body in swirling ribbons of acid green and gold. It was mere moments before he sensed movement in the dark, the whisper of fabric against stone.</p><p>Voldemort stood in front of him, staring at him through the bars with piercing crimson eyes. His skin was milky pale, his fingers long and thin. His wand of yew looked like an extension of his arm, held loosely in an almost relaxed manner.</p><p>“Voldemort,” Harry said, coolly.</p><p>The man blinked his strange eyes in annoyance, but didn’t react otherwise.</p><p>“Potter.”</p><p>“Hello Potter, cousin,” Bella chirped. Dear Bella, who had taught him so much about the Dark Arts.</p><p>“Bellatrix,” Harry replied, a small smile working its way onto his face.</p><p>“How’ve you been holding up, Potter?” Grunted another voice, one that was almost a growl.</p><p>“Not bad, Fenrir. None of those idiots have tried to touch me since poor Darrell. I feel so <em>bad</em> for giving him what he deserved,” Harry said, his voice dripping with sarcasm.</p><p>Fenrir and several of the others chuckled darkly, remembering Darrell’s incapacitated rage after he’d realized what Harry had done to him. Voldemort was watching him interact with his Death Eaters, the majority being in his Inner Circle. He hadn’t said anything yet so Harry was ignoring him, speaking in turn with Rookwood and the two Lestrange brothers. Antonin Dolohov slinked near the back, staring at Harry with resentment. He’d never understood why so many pureblood wizards and witches had been ‘<em>wasting their time and energy’</em> on him, a half-blood.</p><p>“You know, Potter,” Voldemort finally spoke, “I should just end your miserable existence. Stuck here in this cell for five years you’d probably be thankful for the mercy. Or,” he said thoughtfully, tapping his wand lightly against one of the bars of his cell, “I could just <em>leave </em>you here, if I wasn’t feeling merciful. I’ve seen some of your experience here in Azkaban through my followers’ memories, it would be a far better way to defeat you, to leave you rotting in a cell.”</p><p>Dolohov smirked in amusement, only for the expression to fall off his face at the lack of reaction from Harry to Voldemort’s words. Harry barely resisted rolling his eyes, Dolohov was <em>so</em> unsuitable to being a member of the Inner Circle it wasn’t even funny. The man didn’t have a subtle bone in his body.</p><p>“You could,” Harry answered conversationally, “I mean, you have the power at the moment. Either one would no doubt be a rich reward to you, especially since eventually the <em>idiots</em> who put me here are going to realize I didn’t kill the Weasley chit. They’ll come here crying buckets about how they’ve wronged me and how they don’t deserve to be forgiven, expecting me to fall back in line like some obedient little puppy.”</p><p>Voldemort’s lips twisted in a cruel smile, anticipating Harry’s words. “But you wouldn’t fall back in line, would you Potter?”</p><p>Harry snorted, stepped forward and put his thin arms through his cell, crossing them outside the bars and leaning against the cell like it was a banister. “You want to know something? When I first was Sorted, I was a shoo-in for Slytherin. I’d lived with abusive relatives for eleven years and then I found out about magic. I was <em>expected</em> to look like my father with my mother’s eyes, I was <em>expected</em> to be good at nothing really except Defense Against the Dark Arts and flying. The last thing they <em>expected,</em> was for me to be more concerned about <em>moi</em> than anyone else and to consider cunning and ambition to be good things.”</p><p>His eyes hardened. “If they were to walk into this prison tomorrow and free me, begging forgiveness and telling me I needed to fight for them because I was their precious Boy-Who-Lived, I’d tell them to stick their demands where the sun doesn’t shine, after giving a certain few people a bit more <em>thanks.</em>”</p><p>“My Lord,” Bellatrix said softly, cringing a little when crimson eyes swung to focus on her, “my cousin and Potter are powerful wizards, Potter is extraordinary even for a half-blood. We have taught him wandless magic and Occlumency. He is also an Animagus thanks to my cousin’s teachings and a natural Legilimens.”</p><p>“Yup,” Harry said dryly. “made my Inheritance a bitch, I can tell you that. Couldn’t move for days afterwards.”</p><p>“We heard your screaming when your Inheritance hit, you worried us lil’ bit,” Rabastan said, grinning.</p><p>“Glad to know you care,” Harry deadpanned.</p><p>“One thing Voldemort,” Harry said, enjoying the small twitch near the man’s eyes at his name being spoken aloud, “if you decide I’m worth the trouble, <em>he’s </em>non-negotiable.” And he loosened his right hand to point at the cell next to him, where Sirius was.</p><p>“The last I knew, Black,” Voldemort said, eyes narrow, “you were a firm part of Dumbledore’s precious Order. I was surprised by you honestly; I wasn’t expecting you to last long in the war.”</p><p>“Yeah well, there’s a reason why none of your guys ever came out of fights against me alive, Voldemort.”</p><p>Ignoring the use of his name, Voldemort gave a dark laugh, staring at Black. “You tried so hard to get away from your family and where did that land you?”</p><p>“Oh believe me, the irony of it bit hard in the past sixteen years,” Sirius said bitterly. “As for being part of the Order, I kissed them goodbye the moment they threw me in here without a backward glance or even a trial. And Dumbledore got onto the lead of my personal shit list the moment my twelve-year-old godson was dragged into this black hole.”</p><p>“So you would both join my cause? I would mark you both, be well aware of that,” Voldemort warned.</p><p>“We’re aware. One condition? Don’t go curse-happy on us if we use your name on occasion? We’re kinda used to it by now,” Sirius grinned cheekily.</p><p>Voldemort actually sighed. It was such a defeated sound it almost made Harry laugh. Odd, he hadn’t laughed in years.</p><p>“Very well, but don’t abuse the privilege,” he warned.</p><p>“We won’t,” Harry promised.</p><p>“Step back,” Voldemort warned him.</p><p>Harry backed up a few paces and his eyebrow arched when in response Voldemort blasted the locking mechanism on his cell to slivers with an overpowered <em>bombarda.</em> He stepped out of his cell and promptly got wrapped up in a hug by an exuberant Bellatrix. By the time he’d wriggled out of her hold Sirius was out of his cell. He wrapped an arm around his godfather’s waist, feeling the man give a slight sigh into his hair.</p><p>“Let us leave, the Ministry will be here anytime now to reinforce the guards.”</p><p>Spotting a pair of guards that were unconscious but alive, Harry gave a feral grin. “Can we bring them along?”</p><p>Voldemort looked at him for a long moment and then nodded. He bound the pair with ropes and watched in silence as Harry wandlessly levitated them, dragging them along like a pair of macabre marionettes.</p><p>The rain pelted his skin like tiny sharp teeth, but it was a sensation he hadn’t felt in years. Harry turned his face into the rain and laughed, delighted. He was soaked to the bone in a matter of seconds, but he didn’t care. Eventually Sirius walked over and wrapped an arm around his too-skinny waist, leading him over to where Voldemort and the Death Eaters had assembled.</p><p>He held out a rope, which Harry took with one hand.</p><p>“<em>Portus,”</em> Voldemort said and they were gone.</p><p>Wherever they were going, it had to be better than what he’d left behind.</p>
