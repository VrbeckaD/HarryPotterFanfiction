    <p>A/N: Omg its been forever and instead of updating my other WIP this dribble attacked me. The idea was brought on by a meme, and continued by my good friend Chakahlah (go look at her stuff guys…she's much better than I ) and I kinda just went where the muse took me. Its kinda stiff cause I had to stop and go so much ( my youngest has this mischief streak a mile wide and I end up running after him and exhausted lol) but Exhibit A is almost finished with a new chapter, Death's Sacrifice is slowly slowly slowly going. I have another chapter of Daddy Tom in the works and Queen is knocking on my brain for another go as well. I will try to not go so long before updates guys… thanks for being so supportive!!! I love you all!!!<br/>
=========================</p>
<p>Blaise Zabini and Theodore Nott stared at their plates, twin moues of sadness gracing their features. Hogwarts had just begun the day before, each of them sorted into their respective houses and as demanded of them being in Slytherin, an outward veneer of calm and poise projected to the masses. Even now, you had to be intensely observant before garnering a bit of their melancholy. They missed home. They had heard a rumour that each Slytherin with a problem would just need to contact Marcus Flint and he would help them, but the young man was big. Like, really really big.</p>
<p>Admittedly, both first years were intimidated by the third year and so had opted out of asking for assistance. They had managed to muddle through the first day, however they were unsure if they could manage tonight.</p>
<p>"Blaise, we need to contact Flint. Supposedly , according to Professor Snape, he knows what to do." Theo whispered, pushing his eggs around on his plate; eyes bagged with lack of proper sleep. Blaise simply nodded, finally laying down his fork and giving up his meal for staring down the table at the brutish third year.</p>
<p>Feeling eyes on him, the older male searched until his eyes rested on the two firsties. Seeing that they were giving him  pleading looks, the Flint heir visibly struggled not to roll his eyes before inclining his head and returning to his meal.<br/>
With a sigh of relief, the boys stood and left the Great Hall to get to their first classes of the day. It wasn’t until Potions that they were able to get Marcus alone and when they did they informed him of their problem. The older male did give into his urge to roll his eyes. </p>
<p>"Next time come to me, firsties.  I could have helped from the very first night. All of us have had to ask at one point." with that he informed the professor what he was going to do and then reached his hand out where a portal appeared. He reached inside and rummaged around before clicking his tongue and pulling out a small boy with Hufflepuff colours. </p>
<p>The wide eyed boy was curled up like a cat being scruffed by its mother and looking around excitedly before  his eyes settled on Theo and Blaise. Flint cleared his throat, bringing the small Hufflepuff's attention to himself. Something unidentifiable passed through the older male's gaze before it became warm and protective.</p>
<p>"These littles are feeling a bit homesick. I need you to work your magic, little one." the gruff voice of the older Slytherin was barely heard over the sound of the busy hallway as all the children when  about their business. </p>
<p>The little Hufflepuff grinned brightly before giving a nod, straightening out so his legs dangled and Marcus knew to set him down. Still, he only came to the chins of the two first years and they felt the sudden urge to spirit him away. Seeing their look, Marcus snorted, understanding all too well. When he had first seen the boy sorted he had felt a dragon roar in his chest.</p>
<p>"Harry Potter, meet Theodore Nott and Blaise Zabini. Boys, this is Harry. He will be your Assigned Hufflepuff. Protect him and he will make sure you two don’t feel so homesick."</p>
<p>Blaise and Theo were astonished that The Harry Potter was the Assigned Companion but even more surprising was that he was a Hufflepuff. They all heard stories as children of the Gryffindor Parents that were killed by their Lord. To see supposed defeater of Lord Voldemort, not  only sorted into Hufflepuff but willing to be used as one of the Assigned, was a little overwhelming.</p>
<p>Marcus smirked, seeming to understand their thoughts, making them wonder who had been their assigned Hufflepuff. After all, Assigned wasn’t a new practice. It had been reinstated a couple of years previous because a certain Potions Master had found evidence of it. Apparently back in the time of the Founder's, Hufflepuff had become Slytherin's companion to help him stay encouraged while Ravenclaw had been the same for Gryffindor to keep the hot headed founder calm and using his brain instead of rushing into things like a fool.<br/>
However, when the man had confronted the Headmaster about this becoming a practice again he had received a condescending look and told if the Gryffindors needed such a thing he would gladly initiate it for them too. They both knew he wouldn’t.</p>
<p>Theo and Blaise were suitably startled (again) when Harry grabbed their hands in a firm but kind grip. His green eyes alight with a gentle fire, his smile bright. A large paw of a hand softly descended onto the mop of unruly hair causing the grin to be flashed on his taller friend. Onyx eyes fondly traced every inch of the younger child's face before the Slytherin cleared his throat and resumed his rather formidable demeanor. </p>
<p>" I'll see you tonight in the Common Room. I'll let Professor Sprout know you've been Assigned again." Marcus instructed.</p>
<p>The smaller male nodded and the trio of first years went on their way to their next classes. Over the next few weeks the boys bonded and Theo and Blaise felt like being away from their parents, surrounded by the overwhelming amount of Gryffindor supporters and Slytherin haters, wasn’t so bad as long as their new friend was there.<br/>
They soon discovered that they weren't the only Slytherin Firsties who had need of their own Hufflepuff Companion. As they entered the room, after all classes had finished for the day, they spotted some more Badgers dotted amongst the other first years. Even Malfoy had one, for once not trying to Lord himself over the other.<br/>
Of course that might have been partially due to the fact that his father and godfather had expressed how it was a tradition that had been performed even by their Founder and therefore should be honoured with the respect due his station as both a Malfoy and a Slytherin.</p>
<p>The three boys shuffled off to the dorm that Theo and Blaise shared, with a brief stop by Marcus so the youngest of them could give the older male a hug, and then they snuggled under the covers as had become routine.</p>
<p>"Goodnight, Blaise, Theo." Harry whispered in containment and with echoed murmurs, the trio fell to sleep.</p>
<p>…to be continued</p>
