    <p>This was going to make school a whole lot crappier. I was raised in the muggle world, I didn't need to learn Muggle Studies. I spend time around a toaster every summer, I don't need to learn about its properties in stupid details. And now it's placed in our free time like some kind of club. 'Living Muggle Studies Club'. What a stupid name too. I already live with fucking muggles. The was just more obvious torment from the bitch-toad, Umbridge.</p><p>"Okay everybody, I want to ask you all to take a seat." The new professor smiled, "but the twist is, you can't be next to a member of your house on either side. So find somebody with a different colour on their tie and take a seat."</p><p>She was certainly bubbly. She reminded me of Professor Trelawney a little by how she looked. Same kind of hippy clothes, but it seemed like she wore them for comfort. She didn't have Trelawney's constant sense of doom and gloom, her cheery personality shone through every word like sunshine in a window. I worried the Slytherin's were going to chew her up and spit her back out. She didn't seem the kind of woman that could handle a classroom, too gentle to command students. And that was gonna get her in loads of stress. The poor woman had no idea. I guess it wasn't just the students Umbridge was tormenting.</p><p>"I know the name of this says 'Club', but I think we all figured out that this is just like a subject. Including homework." She smiled at our groans of displeasure. "But I've arranged to have the year's homework to be a special project so it works out to be more fun. Taking inspiration from the Muggle concept of Pen Pals, you will write anonymous letters to another member of the class to try and build a friendship outside your house."</p><p>Nobody reacted, too surprised by how happily she said that to verbalise our shock. She launched into a lecture on how important it was to integrate among each other. She had attended Hogwarts in her childhood, and despite her sunny disposition had been placed in Slytherin. Everyone was enraptured in her speech about her time as a Slytherin distrusted by all the other houses, yet not trusted by her own house for not fitting into the mould society had set.</p><p>"It isn't commonly acknowledged that most of You-Know-Who's followers came from the Slytherin house, but that fact has sparked the stigma that my house is evil. Yet it's also relevant to consider that people are closest to members of their house. Harry Potter is famously known to have Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger as dear friends, and they remain so close because they share a house. So they share a dormitory, share lessons, eat together, study together. It's easier access to gain followers in your house than attempt to lure in others."</p><p>She giggled an apology as she warned that she gets into little rants about human psychology, and prejudice was always a hot topic for her. She explained the ins and outs of the project. Individually, we had to create a pseudonym to go by and place them all in a box to be drawn into pairs randomly. From there, Professor Benylin would create enchanted notebooks that were linked so we could write to each other. Similar to the new email craze, but slightly quicker. The aim of the project was to create a bond with someone without knowing who they were, so there would be no prejudice.</p><p>"If you could now write down your alias name on these strips of paper," Benylin waved her wand and paper appeared in front of everyone. "Then I'll collect them for the draw and prepare your books for the end of the class."</p><p>Only Hermione picked up her quill. Like me, it seemed nobody else had any idea what to call themselves. I caught Ron's eye and made a confused face, which he just smiled at. He mouthed something, though I only understood 'bit of fun'. So I guessed he wasn't taking it as seriously as we were meant to. I looked back at the little white strip as I picked up my quill. I didn't want to go obvious since this was a shot to make an ally without being Harry Potter, the crazy boy saying Voldemort was back from the dead, but I could be anyone. It was like Professor Benylin said, I could just get to know somebody without prejudice. So I scrawled my first idea down. <em>GreenLion31</em>.</p><p>The paper flew across the room, placed on a pile from students who had already come up with a name. I was one of the last, but once everyone finished our professor clapped excitedly. She set an activity to group up with friends and discuss what sort of topics we thought would be fun to learn about muggles, since this was taking up our free time, so she could start bewitching. A snigger came from behind me, and I didn't need to look to know it came from Malfoy or one of the other Slytherin's. Whatever she was saying about Slytherin's didn't apply to him what so ever.</p><p>"I like the psychology stuff she was talking about, and it might be fun to learn politics or history, or both." Hermione grinned. How she could be so excited about learning was a mystery to me. Especially since she was actually a muggle-born and raised.</p><p>We let her go on, none of us wanting to know anything this 'club' would teach us. Ron only wanted to talk about our names, but nobody was willing to own up to theirs. He just laughed, thinking he was hilarious using the pseudonym <em>GingerNinja69</em>, which to his credit Seamus enjoyed. His honesty opened up the other boys a little. Dean went with <em>WestHam06</em>, for his favourite football team, and Seamus stuck to his Irish roots with <em>BaileysCoffee</em>. He'd only had it once at Christmas, but his dad enjoyed having Baileys in his coffee at dinner parties. Neville wouldn't own up, and neither would I. Just in case any of them were my soon-to-be pen pal.</p><p>Benylin gestured for us to prepare to leave and a notebook floated off her desk directed over to each of us. It was tied closed by a ribbon, so I assumed something important was written in its pages. Like my fake name, and the fake name of whoever I was about to start talking to. I faked needing the bathroom to take a private look inside, which it seemed the other boys wanted to do as well. The cover was blank, but like an ordinary journal it had <em>'This book belongs to... GreenLion31'</em>, but also contained another name. <em>ClassicGemini</em>. No numbers, no extra hints to who they were like I had done. No clue if they were a boy or girl. I guess I was wrong, this class will be strangely exciting if it's anything like the homework.</p>
