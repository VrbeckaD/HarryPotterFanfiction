    <p>I was in the middle of a dream when suddenly I heard a tapping on my bedroom’s window. I knew it was Hedwig coming back from her nightly hunt. It’s the second week of June. School at Hogwarts has ended for another year. Why does my life suck so much? I should get up to let her in before uncle Vernon doesn’t allow her to fly at night anymore.</p><p>I got out of bed, went to my window, and let her into my room. She flew into her cage, and went to sleep.</p><p>I went to sit on my bed and think. My life royally sucks for being the so-call Boy Who Lived. I wish it wasn’t me. I wish my parents were still alive. I wish I could live anywhere but here. Why is it every time I come back, he always seems to hit me? I still have bruises from last week. How much worse can it get? How much more can I survive? Before I end up using accidental magic again? If I end up using accidental magic, I would finally be away from here. Hell, Azkaban would be a better place than my life here, or I could live with Draco. Where the hell did that come from? Wow, my life must really suck if I’m thinking of living with Draco.</p><p> </p><p>All of a sudden, I heard 3 loud bangs on my bedroom door. Time to be a house elf, again.</p><p>. . . . . .</p><p>“Wake the fuck up, freak!”</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>“Time to cook our breakfast!”</p><p>“You have 2 hands that work...”</p><p>“It doesn’t matter, freak! Do it now!”</p><p>“Go and fuck yourself...”</p><p> </p><p>Fuck! I shouldn’t have said that. I’m going to get a worse beating than usual. I’m so screwed, and not in the nice way.</p><p> </p><p>“Want to run that by me again, freak?”</p><p>“Um, no. I’ll be a good little slave...”</p><p>“Whatever. I don’t have time for this. You’re making me late for work.”</p><p> </p><p>I flung myself off of my bed and out the bedroom door. I ran downstairs to begin cooking for the fat people that don’t appreciate quality food. It took me an hour to make their breakfast. I would’ve been done faster, would Dudley not have pushed me into the stove when he went past me to get to the fridge.</p><p> </p><p>After the people were done eating, Petunia went with uncle Vernon to work. I was set a long list of chores, again. I had to do the chores with very little food in my stomach. But it isn’t the first time this has happened. I’m used to it by now, which says allot.</p><p> </p><p>Today, I looked at the long list of chores that my wonderful aunt gave me. I had to weed the back yard, though I did that a few days ago. Does someone up there hate me? There are always weeds popping up from nowhere. I have to do their clothes and bed sheets. That’s gross. Why can’t they do this themselves? I’m so glad that they don’t fuck each other all that often. Or else it would be worse. There would be cum stains all over the... Bad images, Harry. Dammit! I’m going to have nightmares of what they do to get themselves off at... Fuck! As for my cousin, the less said about him, the better. I know he jacks off. I know where he keeps his porn collection, and I don’t just mean magazines. I’ve heard him blasting his damned DVDs. Does he not know of something called wearing headphones? I don’t need to hear any of the damn kinky fuckery in whatever he gets from his friends!</p><p> </p><p>I’m positive he’s fucking and getting fucked by the neighbor kids. How young he likes them I don’t happen to care. At least he sticks to kids between 11 and 12 at the youngest. He’s not into really young kids, thank god... I’m going to have to go back to school and obliviate myself of today... I’m just glad I’ve never heard him get fucked or fuck someone, either boy or girl. His DVDs are scary enough to listen to. Damn you thin walls... I can’t wait until he tells Petunia and Vernon that he’s a dad...</p><p> </p><p>Dammit! Someone kill me now! Why must I think of my family’s sex lives in such excruciating detail? I must be either really bored or one hell of a masochist, take your pick. I wonder if Ron or Hermione’s lives are as interesting as mine. I hope not.</p><p> </p><p>After a few hours, I was done weeding the garden. I stripped the 2 beds and put the sheets to wash. While this was happening, I cleaned the living room floor, couch cushions, and vacuumed the rug. After the washer was done, I put the stuff to dry. I put the family’s underwear and other clothes into the wash next. While it was drying and the second load was being done, I cleaned the kitchen floor and washed the dishes. How many dishes do 3 people need to use? God damn, do they just wait for me to do their work for them? Meh, this is my life. There’s not much I can do about it.</p><p> </p><p>After the dryer was done, I took the sheets out and quickly made the 2 beds. I washed my own sheets. They’re probably much cleaner than the stuff I washed. I don’t get any sort of action in this house. If I did, I’d be beaten. Thank god they don’t know about my sexual preferences. They’re homophobes and hypocrites. Dudley’s bisexual. I know because I’ve heard his porn. It isn’t all straight. At least he isn’t into animals or dead people...</p><p> </p><p>After a few minutes, I noticed that the house was done. Interesting, all this monologueing in my head makes my time go faster. Though the next time, I have to stop thinking about my family’s sex lives in so much detail.</p><p> </p><p>Before I got to my room, I picked the lock to the cupboard under the stairs with some lock picks that Fred and George gave me for my last birthday. That place was my home for 8 years of my life; my first 3 years were spent under the kitchen sink. I dragged my trunk out of the cupboard and up to my room.</p><p> </p><p>I did something which I’d been wanting to do for some time. I took 2 hours to actually go through it and throw away all the useless shit that I no longer needed. This included the fantasy books by Gilderoy Lockhart. I knew I could get no money for them. I didn’t care. What mattered to me was that I’d have more room for useful books. I shoved the books along with broken quills and unneeded parchment into a bag and went to throw it away in a dumpster down the street. I took the trunk and put it back into the cupboard. I was in my room when Petunia came back from work with Vernon.</p><p> </p><p>Dudley was off playing or fucking his friends, I didn’t care which. It must’ve been the second. He smelled like sex. Thank god I couldn’t be blamed for it.</p><p>. . . . . .</p><p>The boy actually did a good job in cleaning the house. Petunia and I didn’t want him here. The only reason that we brought him into our lives was because of the money we got each month. We also got a free housekeeper, and I got something to punch when I got angry.</p><p>. . . . . .</p><p>I got home from a threesome with 2 of my friends. One was a guy, the other was a girl. I went upstairs, put my clothes into my hamper and got a quick shower. What my mom and dad don’t know about won’t make this family look bad to the rest of the neighborhood. After my shower, I was called downstairs. We left to dinner. The freak could fend for himself tonight.</p><p>. . . . . .</p><p>As soon as the family took off, I went downstairs and raided the fridge. I took enough to satisfy my appetite, but not enough so that it would be noticed. After 45 minutes, I was done.</p><p> </p><p>Since I was tired from working all day, I decided to call it an early night. I wonder if there’s a way to have them go out like this more often, or if there’s a way for me to get removed from this house by either the Muggle or Magical police. I don’t have any other place to go to, so I have no choice but to stay here with my loving family.</p><p>. . . . . .</p><p>We got back after a delicious and filling dinner. If the boy ate anything, it wasn’t much. It didn’t matter. What mattered to us is that no one knew that he lived with us unless we felt it was convenient for them to know, or if we could get something out of it. We decided to leave the boy alone for tonight and went to sleep.</p><p>. . . . . .</p><p>It was after midnight. I was in an interesting and scary dream. I saw my aunt and uncle getting it on. That was scary enough to make me wake up screaming in terror. And that says allot. How I wish Voldemort could see my dreams involving the interesting kinky fuckery my family might get up to. I think the snake faced bastard might enjoy it. Or maybe not...</p><p> </p><p>I heard a tapping on my window. It wasn’t Hedwig, I knew it for sure. When I let the owl in, it was too tiny; Hedwig was sleeping in her cage. She didn’t go off to hunt tonight. It was Pig, the small owl that Ron owned. I fed him some owl treats after I untied the letter from his leg. I let him sleep in Hedwig’s cage. She didn’t care because he’s so small, and he was tired enough where he fell asleep as soon as he flew into it. After I made sure that the 2 owls were sleeping comfortably, I went back to sleep. Hopefully my previous dream wouldn’t come back.</p><p>. . . . . .</p><p>I got up early the next morning. Thank god last night’s dream didn’t come back. I sat up, put on my glasses, opened the letter, and began to read.</p><p>. . . . . .</p><p align="center">
  <strong>Hey mate,</strong>
</p><p align="center">
  <strong>I’m owling you early. Hermione sent a letter to your family through the Muggle post which is slow. My dad’s going to come and get you the second week of July. Don’t worry; we’re not saying we’re wizards. She had to write the letter for my dad. Hope you can come, there’s no need to send a reply if you don’t want to. Cheers, Ron. Ps. Don’t let Pig come back in the middle of the night. I might find a dead owl.</strong>
</p><p>. . . . . .</p><p>Nothing else happened for the next few weeks besides chores, cooking and more chores. I don’t have much time for myself while I’m here. I got beaten a few times for stuff that I didn’t do or was a part of. I think this is uncle Vernon’s way to remind me that he loves me. He had Dudley watch, but not get involved.</p><p> </p><p>A week later, the letter from Hermione came to us in the post in the morning, while I was doing my chores. I picked it up, but didn’t read it. I would tell the family what it said after we had dinner. Hopefully I’d be allowed to leave this hellhole to stay with people that actually care for me.</p><p>. . . . . .</p><p>It was after dinner. The boy told us that he got a letter for us in the post. He let Vernon and I read it. Before Vernon could snap out at the boy, I told him that we’d talk after the 2 left the dining room. I told Vernon I’d take care of this. His threats weren’t necessary. Not for now at least. After dinner, the 2 left the dining room.</p><p>. . . . . .</p><p>“Harry? I read the letter from your friends. I don’t care if you leave. It will keep you out of our hair for a few weeks.”</p><p>“But you hate me, aunt...”</p><p>“That doesn’t matter, Harry. I hated my sister for having what I could not. I may regret what was done to you, but I could do nothing to stop it...”</p><p>“But uncle Vernon hates me.”</p><p>“This is true, as does Dudley.”</p><p>“You can get him to understand?”</p><p>“I think so, but I make no promises.”</p><p>“I understand. Thanks for letting me go with my friends.”</p><p>“Its fine, boy. Leave!”</p><p> </p><p>I nodded at her and took off to my room. I dodged the firing squad for tonight. I would sleep well knowing this fact.</p><p>. . . . . .</p><p>It was the next day after I was finished doing my chores. Uncle Vernon got home. His day at work must’ve sucked. He was seriously pissed off. Before any of us could ask him what was wrong, he took his left fist and slammed it into the side of my face breaking my jaw. I was able to dodge his next 3 hits. His fifth punch slammed into my ribs and broke them. My aunt tried to get involved, but he looked at her, and she ran. Dudley ran as well.</p><p> </p><p>For the next few minutes, I was beaten as much as I usually was before I went off to Hogwarts. I felt my nose break because of one of his punches. I felt my right leg be kicked until the bone broke. I fell onto the floor. He kept kicking me. I tried to wrap my arms around myself, but in doing so, I felt my wrist break. One of his kicks landed onto my head with enough force to knock me out. Before I blacked out, my last thoughts were,</p><p> </p><p>I wonder if I’ll die this time. I wonder what old snake face will think if I do so. I wonder if he’s going to get angry that a Muggle killed the famous Harry Potter.</p>
