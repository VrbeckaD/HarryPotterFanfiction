  <em>September 1,1914</em>
</p><p>”Turpin,Henry!”</p><p>The Hat tensed silently as the blonde boy approached. <em>Athletic potential is always a plus. And he has good arms. But he’s a Turpin. Their pursuits have always,in my memory,tended towards the academic. </em></p><p>As soon as it touched his head,however,the Hat knew it was wrong.</p><p>
  <em>Are you what I think you are?</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Yes,I’m a Hat.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I knew that! But you seem like something more. A Legilimens?</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Almost. There’s much potential for academic achievement,but I think you will score athletically as well. Does it really matter to you where you go?</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Not really.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Since you’ve got more than enough friendliness in you,better be HUFFLEPUFF!</em>
</p><p>———-</p><p>Henry walked over to the table beneath the black and gold. Almost as soon as he sat down,a black girl reached over and shook his hand. “Welcome to Hufflepuff. I’m Barbara Mackenzie,sixth year Prefect. And you are?”</p><p>”Henry Turpin. Nice to meet you.”</p><p>Just half an hour later,he’d chatted with five of his new fellow Hufflepuffs,including two giggly twin sisters. <em>That Hat was right! </em></p>
