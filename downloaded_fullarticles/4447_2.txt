    <p>Harry Potter sat at the massive desk in the quarters attached to the Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom, grading a particularly bad foot of parchment on how to produce a Patronus charm. Sometimes he despaired of these students making their way through his course, although even he could admit he was a much tougher instructor than most of his own Dark Arts teachers had been. One of his sixth year students had even come up with a clever title for him: Harry Potter, the DADA Rotter. Ron thought it was hilarious, and told him he was in danger of turning into a right old stick in the mud. At nearing thirty three, Harry didn’t find jokes about his being a ‘right old’ anything very amusing. </p>
<p>He had enough aches and pains left over from the war to be aware of every one of those thirty three years. In fact, he’d been bent over the stack of essays for – he looked up at the clock over the fireplace – Merlin, nearly three hours, and he was scheduled to meet Ron for drinks in a little under forty five minutes. He still had the walk into town to accomplish it, and that took nearly half an hour. Pushing back his chair he rose, arching his back until there was a loud pop that caused a twinge low in his spine. Grimacing, he straightened and crossed the room to take his outer robes off a hook near the door. They were black, and Ron said if he wasn’t careful he was going to turn into Snape. The portrait of their old Potions Master that hung in the hallway outside of the Great Hall probably wouldn’t agree, if the way he looked down that long nose at Harry was anything to go by. Of course, Harry liked to stick his tongue out at him when no one was looking. It was somewhat disturbing to know the old bastard had once lusted after his mother. </p>
<p>He was turning down all of the lights in his quarters but for the one nearest the door when he heard the murmur of voices coming from the large classroom at the base of the short set of stairs outside of his door. He rolled his eyes, buttoning his robes and heading for the door. It wasn’t the first time he’d caught students using the DADA room for something other than study after hours; for some reason the little twits seemed to forget his apartment was right up the stairs. He opened the heavy oak door and looked into the shadowy classroom beyond.</p>
<p>Just as he’d thought. There were two figures near the rear of the room, the taller, more masculine shaped one leaning against a heavy wooden desk, the shorter, curvier one leaning in against him. The boy had removed his shirt and Harry frowned when he recognized the pale shoulders and the thick head of russet curls.</p>
<p>“Art…Uhm,Mr. Weasley?” He remembered to address the student by his surname at the last moment. His deep voice carried and the bare shoulders stiffened. The boy turned his head. The room echoed with the heavy silence that followed.</p>
<p>Seventeen year old Arthur Lorenzo Weasley blinked his wide grey eyes, clearly surprised to find his ‘Uncle’ Harry in the private quarters of his classroom. </p>
<p>“What exactly are you and Ms. Hereford doing in my classroom?” Harry’s voice echoed menacingly off of the stones in the walls and floor. He’d discovered that little trick barely a week in residence. It made him sound much more imposing than he was.</p>
<p>“I thought… I mean, we thought… I mean…” His voice stammered to a halt, the deep red blush on his cheeks visible even in the dim room. He looked at the ceiling. “Gods, I’m buggered.”</p>
<p>Charlie Weasley and his lover Antonio Bellagio had adopted Artie when he was three, right after the war. His parents had disappeared in a Death Eater raid and the terrified toddler had been found cowering in a cupboard in the kitchen. He told Charlie his Mummy had put him there and told him to be a good boy, and he’d asked Charlie if he’d been good. Charlie’s heart was both broken, and became Artie’s, forever after that moment. Molly considered it providential that Artie was both a ginger, and named Arthur.</p>
<p>Harry came down the stairs slowly, his eyes going from his mortified adopted nephew to the girl, who seemed frozen in place in horror.</p>
<p>“Would you care to tell me why you’re in my classroom, after hours, without your shirt?”</p>
<p>“It’s not what it looks like, sir,” Artie said quickly. </p>
<p>“No, it really isn’t, Professor,” Candy Hereford said, twisting her hands in front of her. “We weren’t doing anything. He was just showing me his new tattoo.”</p>
<p>Harry’s eyes narrowed as Artie moaned softly. “His new <i>what</i>?”</p>
<p>Neither of them would answer, attempting to look anywhere but at Harry. Finally, Harry snapped his fingers. “Front and center, Weasley.” </p>
<p>Artie lurched into motion. He came to Harry, his arms crossed uncomfortably over his pale chest. Harry waited just long enough for the boy to start squirming. </p>
<p>“Show me, Arthur,” Harry ordered finally. “Now.”</p>
<p>Artie hesitated and Harry narrowed his eyes. Apparently realizing that hacking off his uncle, especially when said uncle was Harry Potter, was probably a very bad idea, Artie thrust out his arm. From his wrist to the bend of his elbow was a beautifully rendered griffin. Harry bent to study it more carefully, admiring it in spite of himself. As he stared, the griffin turned his regal head and pinned Harry with a baleful stare. A magical tattoo, then. Harry sighed.</p>
<p>“Oh, for Merlin’s sakes, Artie. What the hell were you thinking?”</p>
<p>“I… I just…”</p>
<p>“Wasn’t.” Harry shook his head. “Clearly. And what exactly do you plan to tell your father’s?”</p>
<p>Artie’s chin went up. “I’m seventeen, sir. I can do what I want.”</p>
<p>Harry pinned him with a sardonic look. “And you plan to tell Angelo that, do you? To his face?” Angelo could be ferocious when he was angry, so much so that Harry avoided pissing him off. The pink in Artie’s cheeks faded abruptly, and his Adam’s apple bobbed as he swallowed. “Just thought of that, did you? You do understand that as your Head of House, I’m supposed to be responsible for you. Which means that not only do you have to discuss this with Angelo, I get to try to explain to him how it managed to happen on my watch.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, Uncle Harry. I’ll tell him, and I’ll explain you didn’t have anything to do with it.” Artie looked like he might vomit, and Harry rolled his eyes.</p>
<p>“Oh, put your shirt on,” he said as sternly as he could manage in the face of such self-sacrifice. “And Miss Hereford, you’re dismissed to your house. Now.”</p>
<p>The girl scuttled away, disappearing out the door with one wistful look back. Harry shook head. </p>
<p>“So, this was about a girl?”</p>
<p>“No,” Artie said with as much determination as a just seventeen year old with goose pimples on his skinny shoulders could manage. “I got it because I thought it was cool.” He gave Harry a pleading look. “You think it’s cool, don’t you?”</p>
<p>Harry couldn’t bear to burst that tentative bubble. “Yes, Artie. I do think it’s cool. It’s an extremely well done tattoo. You only have one problem.” His eyes wide, Artie pulled his uniform shirt over his shoulders and it suddenly dawned on Harry that he could have shown Hereford the tattoo by rolling up his sleeve. Cleary, he was going to have to keep a closer eye on these two.</p>
<p>“What’s that, Uncle Harry?”</p>
<p>“Angelo was a Slytherin, Art, and I doubt he’s going to be much impressed with your griffin. My advice?” He patted Artie on his shoulder as he pulled his gray house sweater over his head. “Hide behind Charlie when you show him the tattoo. As for me?” he shoved his hands into his pockets as he and Artie headed out of the classroom. “I intend to avoid him for the next oh… ten years or so.”</p>
<p>“You won’t tell him, then?” Artie asked hopefully.</p>
<p>“Oh, hell no, Art. I won’t tell him.” He gave the boy a sideways grin. “But I anticipate hearing the explosion from Romania when you do.”</p>
<p>Art looked a bit green around the edges. “You aren’t funny, Uncle Harry.”</p>
<p>Harry shook his head ruefully. “I wasn’t trying to be.”</p>
<p>TBC</p>
