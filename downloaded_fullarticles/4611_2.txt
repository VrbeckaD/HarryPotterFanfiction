</p><p>Dragon fire in the sky<br/>
Scorch marks in his dreams<br/>
Temptation in his veins<br/>
Scarred hands grabbing at air</p><p>Bluebell fire in the jar<br/>
Ink marks her dreams<br/>
Seduction in her hands<br/>
Scarred heart grasping at strings</p><p>“One day you’ll learn.”<br/>
Echoes haunt his memories<br/>
Regret in his veins<br/>
Ancient eyes search for signs</p><p>“Learn what?”<br/>
Echoes haunt her memories<br/>
Regret in her hands<br/>
Ancient soul searching for peace</p><p>Knights on a chessboard<br/>
Challenges lay in his path<br/>
Ice  in his veins<br/>
Cold fingers reach for her warmth</p><p>Quills on parchment<br/>
Words lay in her path<br/>
Ice in her hands<br/>
Cold heart reaches for his fire</p><p>“Someone like me…”<br/>
Truths form on his tongue<br/>
Stones in his veins<br/>
Broken hands grabbing at hope</p><p>“ … doesn’t get happy endings.”<br/>
Truths die on her lips<br/>
Stones in her hands<br/>
Broken heart grasping at faith</p><p>Burns on rough skin<br/>
Tremors lay bare fear<br/>
Bubbles in his veins<br/>
Mended eyes drifting to hers</p><p>Scars on soft skin<br/>
Stillness lays bare love<br/>
Bubbles in her hands<br/>
Mended soul drifting to his</p><p>“Those are reserved …”<br/>
Hopes echo in his breath<br/>
Fire in his veins<br/>
Steady fingers reach for possibilities</p><p>“ … for people like you.”<br/>
Hopes settles in her grasp<br/>
Fire in her hands<br/>
Steady heart reaches for forever</p></div>
