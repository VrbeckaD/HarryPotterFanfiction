    <p>With their bright flame coloured hair, eyes of varying shades of brown and blue, and old clothing, the Weasleys stood out. Like a spot of black paint on a all white wall. </p><p> </p><p>But that’s not the only reason they stood out.

This ought to teach you a lesson on letting go of your pet!” </p><p> </p><p>Blaire Weasley frowned as Fabian tugged at his wavy orange locks in frustration, his blue eyes stormy. “Molly, are you sure you don’t know where his kitten is?

Evaporating and leaving her with her rampant thoughts. </p><p> </p><p>Blaire sighed, giving up and decided to let her mind wander with imagination, playing with her braid and watching the scenery pass in a blur. </p><p> </p><p>*knock*</p><p> </p><p>Blaire looked up as the thick mahogany door slid open to reveal a tall pale boy with hair the colour of snow and eyes the colour of a storm. </p><p> </p><p>“Hello! Is this seat taken?”</p>
