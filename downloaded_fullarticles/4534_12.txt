          <div class="userstuff"><p>Fenrir Greyback, Bellatrix Lestrange, and Dolores Umbridge were all sitting in the Sahara Desert when Dolores decided they should have a tea party.</p><p>"A tea party? I haven't had one of those since I was seven!" said Bellatrix.</p><p>"Nonsense, Bella, we can dress like people's great-grandparents!" said Dolores excitedly. She randomly pulled out a great-grandma dress and offered one to Bellatrix.</p><p>"I'm not getting out of this, am I?"</p><p>Fenrir was already holding her down while Dolores pulled the dress over her head.</p><p>Bellatrix put Fenrir in a moth-eaten vest and a bow tie and he stopped laughing.</p><p>Dolores conjured a table and some puffy armchairs and forced Bellatrix and Fenrir to sit down.</p><p>"So, what flavor tea do you want?" asked Dolores. "I think I'll have some lemon tea."</p><p>"I like raspberry tea." said Fenrir.</p><p>"Death flavored." said Bellatrix.</p><p>Dolores conjured some tea in those flavors and handed them out.</p><p>"Yum!" said Fenrir. He wiped his mouth on his moth-eaten vest and licked the side of Dolores's face. Why be a werewolf if you exhibit good table manners?</p><p>"Yuck! This tastes like...death!" whined Bellatrix. She threw it over her shoulder and demanded Dolores make her a new cup.</p><p>"No, no, Bella, I don't feel like it at the moment, but I'll get you more tea later." said Dolores, sipping her own tea with her pinky in the air.</p><p>"I want more tea! NOW!" whined Bellatrix. She stomped her foot at Dolores like she was a three-year-old.</p><p>"No need to get feisty, dear." said Dolores. Bellatrix started crying because she thought Dolores was yelling at her.</p><p>Fenrir finished his tea and decided Bellatrix crying was really annoying. "If I let you torture me, would you stop crying?"</p><p>"NO!"</p><p>"What if I bought you a pet Chihuahua?" asked Fenrir.</p><p>"What if I wanted 1,000 Galleons?" asked Bellatrix.</p><p>"What if I gave you 750 Galleons and let you torture me until I feel like I'm on fire?"</p><p>"What if I said it's a deal?"</p><p>Fenrir handed Bellatrix the Galleons and said, "How about you torture me later?"</p><p>"How about I do it now?"</p><p>"GUYS!" screamed Dolores. "I want you to hold one of my hands and come and sit down and I'll read you a bedtime story."</p><p>Fenrir turned forward rolls over to Dolores, and Bellatrix did some pirouettes.</p><p>Dolores read them a story about a talking tea kettle. It was easier than having children of her own.</p><p>By the time the story was over Bellatrix and Fenrir were asleep and dreaming, respectively, of warm mittens and mashed potatoes. Dolores thought she'd take them to the Sahara and have a tea party more often.</p></div>
