    <p>Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter were married.</p><p>Well, that was what The Quibbler was reporting. That outlandish rag owned by Xenophilius Lovegood and his daughter; often churning out weird stories about fantastical creatures even the wizarding world had never heard about.</p><p>Although... Harry Potter did go to Hogwarts around the same time as Lovegood's daughter... And the two still ran in the same circles... Still... Draco Malfoy- the boy who would kill Dumbledore... Voldemort's chief henchman, Lucius Malfoy's son...</p><p>Didn't Voldemort live in their house for the last three years or so his before he was finally killed by the-boy-who-lived-twice? Yes, Harry Potter spoke up for young Malfoy and his mother at the trials but that was only because he was Harry Potter: he had a good heart.</p><p>But to marry a man who still carried the mark of his former nemesis - that would be taking it too far, wouldn't it?</p><p>Yes, everyone knew the Saviour was gay. He dated the Weasley girl for a few years after the war. They even got engaged but then broke it off so she could focus on her career with the Harpies while he hooked up with what seemed like every other eligible gay wizard in Britain - and a few from abroad. The Daily Prophet, Witch Weekly and the rest had had a field day reporting about his conquests. Then just around the time he turned thirty and became Head Auror he had either stopped dating completely or became more discreet. Stories of his love interests grew rare, and when available, were often reported as rumours.</p><p>Which made the Quibbler story rather intriguing since it was framed as a personal ad.</p><p><strong>Married</strong>: <em>Harry James Potter, son of James and Lily Potter (both deceased) to Draco Lucius Malfoy, son of Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy.</em></p><p>There was no date or location but a drab photo of Malfoy and Potter standing near each other at, probably, a Ministry event was included.</p><p>Malfoy, hands in his pockets, his signature haughty look on his face, was glancing away from the camera to stare off at something or someone off-frame to his right. Potter, who stood a foot or two away to the blonde's left, gazed into the camera with a small smile on his face. From their body language, the two subjects of the photo did not appear to be aware of each other. Except for the brocade covered wall behind them, the photo may have been coupled together from two separate ones.</p><p>Following the war, there had been no overt public interactions between the two rivals even though both worked at the Ministry and were often seen at the same events - usually, fundraisers.</p><p>Malfoy was Head of Repairs and Restoration at the Department for the Repair, Restoration and Preservation of Magical Artefacts. His office was on Level 4, which had once mostly housed the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures. (Thanks to a vigorous campaign by war hero Hermione Granger, who now headed the entire department, the DRCMC's purview had been greatly narrowed as it sought to humanely integrate the more humanoid creatures into the wizarding world.)</p><p>The Auror Office, which was under the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, was on Level 2, which would prevent the two men from easily crossing paths. If they did carry on an affair at work inspire of that, it would have been right obvious, wouldn't it?</p><p>"Which is why the ad makes no sense," Septimus Bode, a junior secretary in the Minister's office lamented to his best friend, Chadwick Fawley, a clerk in the Auror Office. "It's Malfoy and Potter; any interaction between them would attract a lot of attention."</p><p>Chadwick snorted. "Trust me, you're overthinking this. Harry would never date or marry a Malfoy. I guess The Quibbler is tired of being mostly unread and wishes to gain some notoriety. Harry is probably not making a big deal about it because of his relationship with the crazy Lovegood woman."</p><p>He gave a pompous laugh as he washed his hands in the sink. For security reasons, whenever the best friends wished to chat about sensitive issues within their departments, they did so on other floors but their's to avoid being fingered in case of a leak.</p><p>This strategy was seemingly logical and failproof to two young wizards who left Hogwarts four years ago with as much Poors as Acceptables on their NEWTS.</p><p>They had chosen the same floor where Malfoy's department was located, hoping to run into an employee willing to throw more light on the shocking story. But they had been there almost all through lunch, and had the place all to themselves the entire time.</p><p>Septimus sighed. "It would be disappointing if it were true. But then, it's Harry Potter. I read somewhere he can throw off an Imperius. Would be hard to coerce him into something he didn't want, wouldn't it? He's the Head Auror for heck sake."</p><p>Septimus voice was infused with anxiety to which Chadwick responded with a reassuring laugh, once again affirming the implausibility of the story.</p><p>"Well, it <em>is</em> Harry Potter," Septimus sounded resigned now. "If he did marry Malfoy, he would have a good reason to, won't he? Probably as part of a high-profile hush hush case or to protect the bastard."</p><p>Chadwick's laughter was uproarious as the two gossips finally walked out of the toilets.</p><p>Draco waited for a long minute before stepping out of the stall. He had itched to set off a noxious gas spell to get the two nattering idiots to leave but the thought of the Aurors probably getting involved, had stopped him.</p><p>He glared at his face in the mirror over the sink as he washed his hands. Silly Luna Lovegood and her stupid personal ad.</p><p>He had come into the toilet for some privacy after a morning spent ignoring furtive glances from his staff. Of course, no one dared ask him outrightly; although, he had caught one or two people trying to catch a glimpse of his ring finger.</p><p>As if he would wear a wedding ring to a job that involved intricate charms and ancient spells that could be set off by emotional and familial bonds and magic.</p><p>He needed a stiff drink. Fuck it if it was the middle of the day. He called up his Patronus and sent a message to Pansy.</p>
