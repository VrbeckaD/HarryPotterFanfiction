    <p>Harry had stopped paying attention to where he was going, in fact, he didn’t even know if Dudley was still coming after him, he doubted it, he had been running for a while and Dudley was never one for exercise plus he couldn’t hear him or any of his cronies behind him.</p><p>                Just to make sure he quickly turned his head to look behind him and see if Dudley was there, he hadn’t noticed that he had been heading straight for someone until he was lying flat on the ground from having run into them.</p><p>“Sorry,” he said as he got up and dusted himself all while keeping his head down, hoping that the person he had run into wasn’t anyone who would mention it to the Dursley’s, he didn’t want to get in trouble with his relatives for ‘bothering’ the neighbours. Though he was almost sure the attempt was futile as his hair and clothes tended to give him away whenever he was near trouble.</p><p>                “Are you alright young man,” said the person straightening out their clothes, It wasn’t a voice he recognized so he quickly looked up to see it was an old man with short grey hair, and he was wearing a dress shirt and pants with a mildly dirty lab coat.</p><p>“Yeah, sorry.” Harry mumbled again, still keeping his head down, the man didn’t seem to know who he was and he was hoping that he wouldn’t figure it out, “I should have been looking where I was going.”</p><p>“Well, no harm was done,” the old man said smiling genially. “Now tell me are you here for your first Pokémon, I haven’t seen you around before.”</p><p>                “Poke…?” Harry wondered what the man was talking about before deciding that it probably wasn’t anything too important,” ah, no I live on privet drive”</p><p>“Privet Drive, I can’t say I’ve heard of it.”</p><p>“Really?” blurted out in surprise looking up at the man once again, “Well, it’s not too far from here just down…um…it’s.” Having been keeping his head down and not be spotted by anyone who might get him in trouble Harry hadn’t realized that he no longer seemed to be in Little Whinging. “Umm...”</p><p>“Are you perhaps lost, child?”</p><p>“I think so,” he was back to mumbling, “Do you happen to know the way back to Little Whinging from here?”</p><p>“Haven’t heard of that either,” the old man frowned</p><p>“What about Surrey?” Harry was getting worried he hoped he hadn’t gone too far, he should have been paying attention to where he was going.</p><p>“Nope, can’t say I have,” The old man had this odd questioning look on his face, but Harry couldn’t focus on that right now he needed to figure out how to get back.</p><p>“London, am I anywhere near London?”</p><p>“I’ve never heard of London, do you need my help getting in touch with your parents, young man.”</p><p>“What do mean you haven’t Heard of London, who hasn’t heard of London?” Harry was now a bit suspicious, he didn’t think it was possible for anyone to have not heard of London, but maybe he was foreign he had an odd accent unlike any Harry had heard before.</p><p>“You know what, young man why don’t you come with me and we’ll see what we can do about getting you home,” Oak asking, holding his hand out to Harry.</p><p>Harry had never been in this situation before but he knew he wasn’t supposed to go anywhere with strangers and something told him that rule was doubly true for strange foreign old men who didn’t know what London was. He took one more look at the old man before deciding, no matter how nice he seemed it was probably best not to go with him, so Harry turned around and quickly ran in the other direction far from the old man who he could hear calling out after him.</p><p>                After getting away from the old man Harry wondered the town just now noticing how unlike Privet drive it was and wondered how he could have possibly mistaken it, there weren’t as many people and houses around and while the houses all looked similar they were in no way identical and could clearly be told from one another without using the house number. The houses were also spread far apart and the road wasn’t paved at all it was just a dusty old dirt road, the inside of his shoes were now filled with rocks and dirt like he had gone to the park and played in the sandpit.</p><p>                Harry kept wondering around passing by people who would occasionally throw him an odd look before continuing on there way and children his age and younger who ran into the streets without a care in the world, it was clear to Harry that people around here didn’t seem to have cars, he’d passed one or two parked in people’s driveway but not once had he seen any driving on the road. He eventually came across a grocery store it was rather small and there didn’t seem to be any carts outside like the local Tesco’s he went to with his aunt.</p><p>                He had found a whole five pound in one of his pockets last week and had been holding on to it as neither Uncle Vernon or Aunt Petunia ever gave him money and he never knew when he’d end up needing it. The coin had most likely been left in the pocket by Dudley when he had still owned the pants, but now they were Harry’s both the pants and the coin. He grabbed the coin in his hand and walked through the door, he refused to let go of the coin until he was at the register and had what he had come to buy, He’d be able to get a bag of crisps and a drink with this and still have a bit left over for later.</p><p>                He kept his head up when went in no matter how much he’d rather curl into himself he knew he must already look suspicious, with Dudley’s old castoffs making look like he was wearing a sack and his shoes, practically falling apart, every time Aunt Petunia saw them she’d sneer and mutter about how she needed to get him new shoes, but that still hadn’t happened and it’d been over a month since she had started saying that. She was probably going to have to buy him new shoes when he got back as they’d probably be in absolute pieces by the time he got back.</p><p> Sighing, Harry shook himself off and headed straight for cashier as he didn’t have time to be hanging around the store if he wanted to make it back by nightfall.</p><p>                There was a single bag of crisp among all the candy, it was a bag of <em>Sunflora Chips </em>Harry grabbed the bag and quickly going to the fridge so that he could grab a bottle of water, before he had even opened the fridge he noticed that the Price on all the drinks was odd, they were all really expensive; there wasn’t anything there for less than a hundred and another thing instead the sign for euros coming after the numbers there was this odd p with two dashed going through the stem in front, it wasn’t anything he’d seen before, Harry knew that sometimes different countries had different money signs, had somehow ended up in another country while he had been running from Dudley? But that didn’t make any sense even if he had that old man still should have heard of London and how had he managed to leave England he didn’t think Surrey was close to any kind of border, but it must have been for him to have to end up here…but then…</p><p>“Yo, kid! You okay?” The cashier quickly snapped Harry out of his thoughts.</p><p>“Yeah…” was muttered as he slowly shuffled his way over to the register sans drink. “I was wondering, do you take euros.”</p><p>“Euros?” the man questioned, “sorry kid got no clue what that is, and anyway we only take poké here.”</p><p>“Oh, ”he muttered and took one more look at the bag of crisps before putting it down on the counter, “Thanks anyway,” he said forcing a smile on his face before running out the store.</p><p>Harry ran until he reached the lake, he was hungry and thirsty and strangely tired plus he had no idea how he was going to get back to privet drive as it seemed no one around here even knew what England was which just didn’t make any sense all, he had done something like this before when he had once again been running from Dudley he had somehow managed to end up on the roof but he had noticed that time this time he hadn’t noticed anything until he’d run into that man. Harry sat down by the lake and looked around, he had gotten in a lot of trouble for being on the roof as no one believed him when he said he hadn’t climbed up and had no idea how he got there Uncle Vernon hadn’t pleased and had locked him in his cupboard for 3 whole days, Harry didn’t even want to imagine the amount of trouble he would be in once he finally managed to make it back to the Dursley’s.</p><p>He looked around quickly making sure that no one was around before taking a drink of a couple handfuls of water and looking for a way out of town, he might not know where he was but maybe if he continued on he’d find his way back.</p>
