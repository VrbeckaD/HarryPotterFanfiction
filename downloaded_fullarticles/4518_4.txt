    <u>Prologue</u>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>Hermione Granger was supposed to have been his. She was supposed to have been his, not Draco <em>sodding </em>Malfoy’s. She couldn’t be soul-bound to the ferret for the rest of eternity. This wasn’t the way it was meant to have happened; they said she would have been his. He had done everything they had told him to, it should have worked. She would be his; no matter what he had to do, he would make sure of that.</p>
