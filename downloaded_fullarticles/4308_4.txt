<p>At the feeling of being watched Lily opened her eyes, sat up in bed and look around the room. Her heart began to beat frantically until she spied the dark figure standing near the opened window. </p>
<p>“What are you doing up?”</p>
<p>He shook his head. “It’s okay go back to sleep.”</p>
<p>But Lily was having none of it. She slipped out of bed and walked towards him. “Come back to bed, Severus.” She reached for his hand.</p>
<p>With a smile on his face Severus placed his hand in hers and allowed her to lead him back to bed.</p></div>
