  <strong>BOY WHO LIVED VANISHES</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>BOY WHO LIVED, WHERE IS HE NOW?</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>HARRY POTTER, MISSING IN CRISIS</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A man with dark hair stood next to the corkboard, reminiscent of a muggle detective caseboard, and sighed angrily, running his hands through his hair. He looked much like a normal man, albeit a handsome one, but his eyes ruined the image. They were as red as blood and had catlike slits where the pupils should have been.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Voldemort sighed again. It had been two years since the fight at the Ministry. Two years since Harry Potter, the boy who lived, vanished into thin air. Voldemort suspected the death of the boy’s godfather might have had something to do with it. Voldemort stared ruefully at the board, as he did most nights in his private study, adjacent to the alpha’s bedroom. Voldemort growled. He knew he was spending far too much time looking for the brat, but he couldn’t help but be… intrigued by the brat’s near misses with death at his hand. Voldemort knew, logically, that he should be looking for a mate to breed his heirs, as he couldn’t get away with the untouchable alpha persona forever. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He was already having troubles with the forces under his command for it. Bellatrix, a beta, kept throwing herself at him, but somehow, despite her pedigree of pureblood, he just wasn’t interested. He regretted this, sometimes late at night, but he knew that Bellatrix just wasn’t the mate for him. He hoped she would find someone worthy of her, rather than the dolt of a husband she married to get herself through her lonely nights. She deserved someone who could challenge, perhaps even surpass her in skill. He smirked, then ran a hand through his hair again.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span><em>It seems I’m getting sentimental.</em> He thought to himself.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He knew he couldn’t do what Bellatrix had done, and married for less. No. His mate would be the first and only one he would marry. He just hadn’t found them yet. It was… inconvenient to say the least, but thank Merlin for Severus inventing the rut-suppressing potion that he’d been on for years now. It made sure he didn’t waste time being unfocused. It did make him more bloodthirsty, but he learned to work that to his advantage.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Speaking of Severus, there was a knock at his door. Voldemort considered hexing Severus through the door, but decided against it. The potions master would be hard to replace.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Come in, Severus.” Voldemort purred.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Severus entered, wearing a microexpression that deemed he was about to deliver bad news.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Severus, what is it?” Voldemort asked impatiently, but softly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We may have found a lead.” Severus said.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“And the bad news?” Voldemort asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“... I tracked the lead myself, but the trace of power that I was following seemed… off.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What do you mean, off, Severus?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I mean, it is undoubtedly Potter’s power, but it seemed… stronger than I have ever felt it.” Severus seemed uneasy.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“How much stronger?” Voldemort knew Potter was an average wizard with extraordinary luck, but he had felt potential in the boy. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...Almost as strong as yours, my lord.” Severus flinched subtly, as though expecting a curse. Voldemort considered it, then decided against it. Again.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“There is more, my lord.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Go on, Severus.” Voldemort said, in a slightly more patient tone. The tone of a predator about to strike.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“The power… Vanished into a muggle strip club.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Voldemort considered the information given. If Potter had visited the club, he would have put precautions in place, and if he was as powerful as Severus said he was now, it might take his own power to break whatever memory charms Potter had put in place. Distasteful as it may be…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Good work, Severus, I will investigate this myself.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He didn’t add that he was going also to feel less… lonely.</span>
