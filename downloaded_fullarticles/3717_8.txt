    <p><span class="veryhardreadability">The hustle and bustle of Diagon Alley during the weeks before Hogwarts always caused Grace to groan out of frustration, especially during the rush hours of mid afternoon </span> . <span class="veryhardreadability"> The streets were always packed with wizards and witches, but after lunch they were even more so, to the point where Grace could reach out with her arm in any direction and hit at least one witch, wizard, or muggle parent of the muggleborn students </span> . <span class="hardreadability"> As a result of the </span> <span class="adverb"> overly </span> <span class="hardreadability"> crowded streets, Grace had a hard time focusing on finding the right shop she was trying to visit </span> . <span class="veryhardreadability"> It was so hard in fact, that she had felt tempted to wait in the last store she visited until the roads cleared, but she didn’t know how long that would take and she needed to meet up with her aunt </span>.</p><p></p><div class="">

    <p> <span class="hardreadability">She scanned the shops around her on both sides of the street, intent on spotting the wand shop Ollivanders, so she could get her wand </span> . <span class="hardreadability"> The shop itself was a few stores down on the left hand side of the road, situated between two larger, and much newer shops </span> . Its two barreled windows that flanked its door and its <span class="complexword"> overall </span> dull color made it easy to spot. Grace hurried to slip inside.</p>

    <p><span class="veryhardreadability">As the door closed behind her, she heard a faint sigh from the back and a scruffy old man with wispy white hair, whom she assumed was Mr. Ollivander, stepped out to meet her </span> . <span class="hardreadability"> His shoulders curved forward the slightest bit as he stood and his robes were by no means fancy, but he gave off a quirky, but </span> <span class="adverb"> grandfatherly </span> <span class="hardreadability"> feel </span>.</p>

    <p>“How many I help you, Young Lady?” He asked kindly, although his expression was knowing. <span class="hardreadability"> After all, this was a wand shop, and all he sold was wands, no one would her age would come here for any other purpose than to buy a wand for Hogwarts </span> . He <span class="qualifier"> just </span> wants to be polite, she told herself and flashed a warm smile towards the old man. <span class="veryhardreadability"> She wasn’t there against her will, in fact, she wanted to be there, so she might as well get it over with and not act like a little child </span> <span class="qualifier"> just </span> <span class="veryhardreadability"> because her aunt wasn't there with her </span>.</p>

    <p>“I’m here to get my wand,” She replied. <span class="veryhardreadability"> Mr. Ollivander nodded and several enchanted measuring tapes flew out of his pockets and took note of the weirdest measurements </span> . <span class="hardreadability"> She didn’t know why the distance between her knee and ankle was necessary for choosing her wand, but she didn’t object to his methods </span> . <span class="veryhardreadability"> After all, the Ollivander family owned the oldest and most popular wand shop in Great Britain, and his wands were always effective, reliable, and of a fine quality </span>.</p>

    <p>“Hold out your wand-arm,” He instructed moments later and Grace held out her right hand. <span class="hardreadability"> He removed a wand from one of the many boxes that filled the room from floor to ceiling and placed it </span> <span class="adverb"> gingerly </span> <span class="hardreadability"> in her open hand </span>.</p>

    <p><span class="hardreadability"> “Maple, phoenix feather core, quite pliable,” He described the wand and Grace closed her hand around it </span>. When she tried it out, a bright flash of sparks jumped from the tip of the wand. It sent an odd feeling jolting up her arm, and she knew that she didn’t want it. Mr. Ollivander proceeded to take the wand from her hand and handed her another.</p>

  <div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr">
    <p>Like the first one, the reaction was small and didn’t seem right. She tried wand after wand, getting a small response from most, but none from others. I seemed as though she wouldn’t find the right wand. Even Mr. Ollivander mused to himself about having to go back to some of his older wands that he had in storage.</p>

    <p>He disappeared into the back of his shop for a few moments and returned with a couple of wand boxes. <span class="hardreadability"> The first one he had her try, which he described as cherry with a dragon heartstring core, glowed </span> <span class="adverb"> brightly </span> <span class="hardreadability"> when placed in her hand </span> . <span class="complexword"> However </span>, it grew very hot to the touch and she dropped it out of fear of burning the inside of her hand.</p>

  <div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr">
    <p><span class="hardreadability"> This earned an intrigued look from the wand maker and he shuffled through the boxes he had brought from the back </span> . He settled on an old and dusty box and pulled out the wand that <span class="passivevoice"> was kept </span> inside.</p>

  <p></p>
  <div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr">
    <p>This wand grabbed Grace’s attention as it was <span class="adverb"> elegantly </span> crafted. The tan-brown wood appeared to be an off shade of red and a <span class="adverb"> lightly </span> carved, cobweb design adorned the base of the wand. <span class="hardreadability"> It struck Grace as antique, something that she might read about in medieval stories or what she might catch a glimpse of inside of an old family’s home </span> . <span class="hardreadability"> Other than its old fashioned design, the wand was straight, smooth, and well polished, appearing to be of high quality </span>.</p>

  <div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr">
    <p><span class="adverb"> Carefully </span> , she held out her hand and when he placed it in her hand, she gasped.

    <p><span class="complexword"> On the contrary </span> <span class="hardreadability"> to what she expected, Mr. Ollivander said nothing and fixed the damage with a quick spell as Grace muttered her apologies </span> .

    <p><span class="veryhardreadability"> “Ah, cherry, twelve and a half inches long, phoenix feather core, and unyielding flexibility,” He retailed as Grace got a feel for the wand after the display of magic that it gave </span>. “Quite rare, that wand is, and capable of powerful magic.”</p>

    <p>“I love it,” Grace commented and adjusted her grip.

    <p><span class="hardreadability"> Mr. Ollivander smiled, “My grandfather made that wand many years ago, but it never sold despite its high quality </span> .

    <p><span class="hardreadability"> He watched her wrist movements with a careful eye as she gripped her wand a little tighter and admired its design </span> . She didn’t hesitate to try out different wand movements, ones her aunt had drilled into her head from a young age. <span class="veryhardreadability"> Most of the wand movements were mere exercises that loosened up the wrist for more precise spell work, but a few flicks of the wand were for some of the trickier spells that she was trying to master </span> . <span class="adverb"> Suddenly </span> <span class="veryhardreadability"> the tip of her wand gave a bright flash of white light and she raised her hands to shield her eyes, she hadn't felt any magic coming from herself, at had been the wand </span>.</p>

    <p>“The Phoenix feather core,” He answered her silent questioning look with a smile. “Capable of acting on their own accord, not the most desirable trait, I must admit, but the core is of a very high quality.”</p>

</div><div class="">
  <p> </p>

  <div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr">
    <p>She gave a half hearted smile out of embarrassment and didn’t hesitate to ask for the price of the wand.</p>

  <div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr">
    <p>“That will be twelve galleons.” Ollivander named the price. Grace saw it fitting, for such a rare combination. He even said it himself that he had never sold that pairing before. She fished her silk coin purse out of the many folds of her robes and counted out the correct amount of galleons.</p>

  <div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr">
    <p>There was a soft creaking as the door to the shop opened. Grace turn to spot a very well dressed woman in expensive robes stride into the shop with purposed steps. <span class="hardreadability"> The woman was very pale in complexion with flawless appearing skin and light blonde hair that was very </span> <span class="adverb"> elegantly </span> <span class="hardreadability"> styled </span> . <span class="veryhardreadability"> She was beautiful without a shadow of a doubt and Grace found it safe so assume that she was from one of the old pure-blooded wizarding families that had earned rather large fortunes over the years </span>.</p>

  <p> </p>
  <p></p>
  <div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr">
    <p>The woman paid Grace no attention and strode up to Mr. Ollivander and demanded to see his finest wands. <span class="veryhardreadability"> Grace stood memorized by the woman's actions for a few moments as the woman sifted through several wand boxes, dismissing those that she deemed unworthy for her son, whom Grace assumed she was getting the wand for </span>. Feeling a bit intimidated by her presence, Grace turned back to her task.</p>

  <p></p>
  <div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr">
    <p>She finished paying in a hurry and scampered out of the shop, stepping back into Diagon Alley. The hustle of the road still bothered her, but at least she had a clear mind about her next destination. <span class="veryhardreadability"> She headed towards the Leaky Cauldron where she had promised to meet up with her aunt, holding onto her wand out of fear that it would fall out of her pocket should she put it there </span> . <span class="veryhardreadability"> As she walked along the cobblestone road, weaving </span> <span class="complexword"> in between </span> <span class="veryhardreadability"> the crowds of people who were also shopping for Hogwarts supplies, she toyed with the wand, casting a few, harmless jinxes on random items in the street such as an owl cage, or feather </span> . <span class="veryhardreadability"> She wasn't supposed to know magic before Hogwarts, but nobody had stopped her so far so she figured that is nobody found out that she knew magic, nobody could pin it to her </span>.</p>

  <div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr">
    <p><span class="veryhardreadability"> Almost immediately after stepping foot into the Leaky Cauldron, Grace spotted her aunt Olivia sitting at a table in the far corner of the pub with a cup of tea in her hand </span> . <span class="veryhardreadability"> Her aunt’s dark raven hair was almost impossible to miss amongst the many heads around her that consisted of various shades of browns, blonds and reds </span> . <span class="hardreadability"> Her aunt also appeared to be in deep conversation with a rather handsome young man with the same dark raven hair </span> . <span class="hardreadability"> It looked as though they were old friends which was a bit odd as her aunt hardly mentioned knowing anyone well enough to even call them a friend </span>.</p>

She got nothing. She shared a glance with her aunt who <span class="adverb"> merely </span> smiled and hinted back at the man sitting across from them. <span class="veryhardreadability"> Grace took another look at the man and noticed the color of his eyes, not that they were odd or weird, but rather because they were a comforting shade of hazel that emphasized her familiarity of him </span> . <span class="veryhardreadability"> She was certain that she had seen his eyes somewhere else before, but she could not remember for the life of her and her aunt wasn't being very helpful either </span>.</p>
