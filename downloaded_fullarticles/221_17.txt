  <em>This couldn’t be happening.</em>
</p><p>It was a mantra Severus Snape repeated to himself, half blind with panic, racing up the stairs to Godric’s Hollow, tripping over the last step that wasn’t there.</p><p>
  <em>This couldn’t be happening.</em>
</p><p>He kept repeating it to himself even as he saw the still-warm corpse of James Potter, glasses askew and eyes unseeing, lying in the doorway like he was a puppet with its strings cut.</p><p>
  <em>This couldn’t be happening.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>But it was.</em>
</p><p>A mantra three times repeated did not mean it was true. The truth did not care for the whims and wishes of a mortal man. A wizard or not, all the power Severus spent years gathering meant absolutely nothing in the face of the scene that greeted him when he entered the nursery.</p><p>There she was.</p><p>It was a feeling not unlike trying to step on that last stair only to realize he was on flat ground. His entire worldview shifted and he was scrambling and failing to adjust.</p><p>And just like on that last stair, he tripped and fell on his knees, next to the warm body of the woman he loved. He felt a curious sensation of his fingers going numb, like his bleeding heart was drawing the blood back from them in an effort to keep beating. </p><p>Lily Evans. Lily Potter. A Lily by any different name, yet dead just the same.</p><p>Severus wondered if the world outside was ending as well, or if it was just his own. </p><p>He was clutching her in his arms before he fully realized he was doing it. Beautiful, warm Lily, so bright the flower ought to have been named after her instead of the other way around. The one ray of sunshine in his cruel, dark world. The Light he wished more than anything was his, yet was self-aware enough to know that the Dark of his own soul would have suffocated her.</p><p>That Light he knew could never be his, yet the threat of it extinguishing had been enough to win against his fear of the Dark Lord. It was enough to send him to his former headmaster, knowing the man cared not for Severus’ life but still willing to hand it over to him in exchange for Lily’s.</p><p>And it was all for nothing. She was dead. The Dark Lord had won.</p><p>
  <em>It was over.</em>
</p><p>In his grief it took him far longer than he would ever admit to notice that the wails he was hearing weren’t solely his own.</p><p>Slowly, as if he were a boy afraid of the dark, he turned around towards the crib and the child inside that Lily had given her life protecting. And in it, Severus saw the impossible.</p><p>
  <em>The boy was alive.</em>
</p><p>For a few seconds Severus was frozen in disbelief. Harry Potter, the babe Voldemort had been so adamant to kill, was alive. How? His parents were dead, so the Dark Lord must have been here. But why would he kill them and leave the boy alive when the whole purpose of coming was to kill him?</p><p>Something was wrong.</p><p>Severus gently laid Lily back down and staggered towards the boy. He was crying from all the commotion the adults were causing but he quieted momentarily when Severus loomed over his crib. He had blood on his forehead, Severus noticed, dripping into his eye from a strangely lightning-shaped wound. </p><p><em>No… That’s not lightning</em>, Severus thought with a horrifying realization as he recognised the spell that required that wand movement. He had watched Voldemort himself demonstrating it to his newly minted Death Eaters, the quick, jagged lines matching the erratic movements of the Dark Lord’s wand as he cast the Killing Curse on a random Muggle he’d caught for just that occasion. Severus remembered how the man had begged, then collapsed dead in a flash of light, no trace of violence left on him.</p><p>The Killing Curse was supposed to leave no marks on its victims… Unless, apparently, it <em>rebound.</em></p><p>That meant… The Dark Lord had cast the curse on Harry Potter, and it rebound <em>back at him. </em>It meant that Voldemort had been hit with the Killing Curse. It meant Voldemort was <em>dead</em>.</p><p>Feeling like he was going to faint from all the shocks that just kept happening tonight Severus held onto the edge of the crib and turned towards the dark shape on the floor which he had previously dismissed as a discarded cloak. It was a cloak, yes, but last he checked the Potters were not the kind of people to fill their cloaks with burnt ash.</p><p>He recognised that cloak. He had seen Voldemort putting on that exact cloak scant hours ago, when he had begged him to spare the life of a woman Severus loved. Voldemort had agreed, if only Lily agreed to step aside and give up the one life Voldemort was required he take.</p><p>Severus, knowing full well that Lily would never step aside if she ever found herself in between a murderer and her child, had collared the first Death Eater that could tell him where the Dark Lord had gone and then raced after him.</p><p>But he was too late. </p><p>The prophecy was fulfilled. Not the way Voldemort had wanted it to, but fulfilled nonetheless. Albus Dumbledore would be satisfied. The war would be declared over. The Light had won.</p><p>So where did that leave Severus, who had just lost everything he had been fighting that war for?</p><p>“Mama?” He was interrupted from his melancholy thoughts by a high wobbly voice, struggling to force words through tears.</p><p>“Mama!” Harry Potter called again and flailed a tiny hand through the bars towards his mother’s corpse. He turned to Severus, begging him with his eyes to help. “Mama!”</p><p>He understood the boy’s grief, but he didn’t know how to help him. He couldn’t. For all the power Severus had been told he had, that would one day make him great, he could not bring back the one person both he and this boy loved. It was perhaps because of their shared pain that Severus did it. Or perhaps because the boy had her eyes. Or for no reason at all, save that he might still, despite everything, be in possession of a heart.</p><p>Severus reached into the crib and hefted the baby onto his hip, just as Narcissa had shown him before handing him Draco. Harry wasn’t very happy to have a stranger handling him, he made that abundantly clear, and he wasted no time in leaning sideways abruptly, almost falling out of Severus’ arms. “Mama!”</p><p>“Your mum can’t hold you now,” Severus said as gently as he could, deliberately not looking at Lily’s corpse, “She’s… Very tired. She needs to sleep for a while.”</p><p>He wasn’t quite sure how much the boy could comprehend, but he apparently did understand what Severus was telling him. Harry turned to Severus with his teary eyes, exactly like Lily’s, and without a shred of remorse grabbed a fistful of Severus’ hair and yanked on it hard enough that the spy let out a pained hiss.</p><p>“I see you’re already turning out to be like your father,” Severus grumbled as he tried in vain to free the hair young Potter gleefully held hostage. </p><p>At least he wasn’t crying anymore. Severus would take his silver linings where he could get them.</p><p>There was also the problem of <em>what to bloody well do now</em>? Just because the Dark Lord was dead it didn’t mean that the war would end overnight. The Death Eaters would be like rats abandoning a sinking ship the moment the news of their Lord’s death reached them. There would be witch hunts, quite literally.</p><p>Suddenly Severus went cold. He was holding Voldemort’s vanquisher in his arms. The entire Wizarding World would be up in arms about the young Potter. There would be Dark wizards and witches howling for his blood, Bellatrix chief among them. Without his parents to protect him, it was very likely the boy would not survive to see Christmas.</p><p>This was Lily’s son. He couldn’t let that happen. If it was the last thing he ever did, if he couldn’t save Lily, then he could at least save someone whose life she valued above even her own.</p><p>And then Severus was hit with an idea. </p><p>The Wizarding World would be looking for Harry Potter, the boy who essentially saved them from the Dark. They would vie for him like starving wolves after a piece of meat. </p><p>Nobody would be looking for an ordinary baby. But for that to happen, Harry Potter had to die. </p><p>It wasn’t even that hard to do, in retrospect. He took the baby blanket from the crib and pressed the edge of it to Harry’s forehead, letting it absorb the blood and retain rather conspicuous stains. Then, with a baby still securely on his arm, he grabbed a handful of Voldemort’s ashes and left them in a pile on the mattress next to the bloodied blanket.</p><p>Let the Aurors make of that what they will.</p><p>It was almost perfect, even in hindsight when Severus was in possession of a clearer mind, and it would have probably had the intended effect if it hadn’t been for Rubeus Hagrid barging in on him at the last second. </p><p>Luckily for Severus, a man of Hagrid’s stature did not approach quietly. He had ample time to cast a sleeping charm on the boy and pull his Death Eater mask over his face. By the time Hagrid entered the nursery, nearly screaming for James and Lily, Severus had both Harry and his face well-hidden with his mask and cloak.</p><p>And thus, when Hagrid ran into the nursery, all he saw was Lily’s body dead on the floor, an empty crib and a Death Eater waving an ebony wand a second before the CRACK of Apparition signalled their disappearance.</p><p>It was a scene that would haunt Hagrid’s nightmares for years to come, seared into his mind as clearly as his own name. </p><p>And it was that story, that sealed Sirius Black’s fate.</p>
