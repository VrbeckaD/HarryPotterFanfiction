    <p>Death, I would like to point out, is actually rather comforting and painless. I don't quite remember when and how it happened, but I died. That's not important, what is important is /after/ I died. The first thing I really became aware of after death was this weird tingling in my chest, near my heart. It wasn't a painful tingle, just different.</p>
<p>            The second thing I was aware of was three people standing over me, well I say people, it was more like people shaped blobs. Apparently not even dying can correct my vision. Anyway, back to the people, they were cooing at me like I was some kind of- 'wait, really, AM I A SNOT NOSED BRAT?' A quick semi stable glance at myself reveals that yes, I am in fact an infant. So in typical baby fashion I flail like the damned.</p>
<p>             The higher voiced blob, who I assume is my mother, picks me up shushing me "Hush Harry, Mum's here, hush little Harry." 'Harry, Harry who? Wait isn't Harry a boys name? AM I A BOY?' My thoughts race, slightly disjointedly. But due to my baby body and constitution, I quickly am lulled into a dreamless sleep.</p>
