    <p>The incessant droning drew Severus Snape mad. For the fifth day that week, it seemed no one else could detect the mystifying noise but him. Scowling, he studied each student with an inscrutable intensity. Contempt arose as seconds passed, and the students proceeded to appear unfazed. He must be going mental! Sighing, he glowered at the ungraded 6th-year essays, dully noting to himself that torturing students with workloads of essays, assignments, and quizzes eventually backfired in the end. He tossed them to the side after setting the quill back in its holder. No worries. The class period was nearly over. He'd find out where the source-</p><p>Snape's fist clenched in irritation as the droning crescendoed in volume as he walked through the rows, checking potions. He eyed Weasely's potion, halting abruptly. The color and texture were completely wrong! This somehow aggravated him on a level it should not have been capable of.</p><p>"Weasely," he drawled, his arms crossing over his chest, "how did you manage to turn what was supposed to be a <em> pinkish pearl </em> color into...what one would daresay...resembles mud?" He raised an eyebrow.</p><p>Snickering erupted from the Slytherin side of the room.</p><p>"Silence," Snape uncharacteristically snapped at his house. His brain was unable to handle any more unnecessary clamor.  </p><p>With a flick of his wand, Ron Weasely's botched potion disappeared. "Zero for today. Don't bother restarting. If I were you, I'd learn how to follow simple directions, Weasely." The red head's face reddened in anger.</p><p>The last of the fifteen minutes were coming to an end, and unsurprisingly, for the majority of the class, Slytherins took the brunt of Snape's wrath as they had all week. They all knew Professor Snape was more aggravated than usual.</p><p>The class resumed stirring and adding their final touches to their potions. Snape caught a weird scent from the mid-section of cauldrons. His eyes settled on Longbottom who was gazing wide-eyed around the room. The idiotic boy had the audacity to idly stir a potion- his small brain absent- after Snape had shouted at him for the past couple of days about! The potions professor strode over to him as the boy picked up a small cutting knife. </p><p>"Longbottom!" Snape venomously barked. He took pleasure in seeing the cowardly Gryffindor nearly jump out of his skin. The boy dropped the potions knife and flinched as it fell suddenly, tightly clenching his left hand. "Care to explain why- for the fourth time this week- you have been daydreaming and have been careless to pay attention in my class! If you botch one more potion, I will-"  </p><p>Longbottom raised his arm as if he was possessed, hand hovering over the potion. A bead of blood fell into the cauldron, rippling the surface of its content like ocean waves.</p><p>The potion in Longbottom's cauldron scent wafted into his nostrils.</p><p>Snape became rigid, stuck in some sort of trance. Heat radiated, racing and intertwining through his veins. His breathing slowed tremendously. Blood rushed south, his skin flushing. The droning became a vibration strumming through his body, starting from the crown of his head ceasing at his groin to spread throughout. Snape would be lying if he said it wasn't pleasurable.</p><p>Finally, he regained control of his motor skills. Gripping the edge of the table he forced his legs to cease its quivering and attempted to compose. It was humiliating how he was being ogled by students in such a state.</p><p>"C-class-" he swallowed-"Class dismissed..."</p><p>Miss. Know-It-All-Granger stood up in alarm. "But, sir-"</p><p>"Now!"</p><p>Chairs scraped against the dungeon floor as they gathered their things and fled the room. "L-Longbottom, stay!" Snape growled out through gritted teeth. He forced Neville Longbottom to reveal the list of steps and ingredients of the botched potion on parchment before assigning detention.</p>
<hr/><p> "Arggh!"</p><p>Snape groaned. The potion shared similar properties to the Amorentia potion, except with more aphrodisiac qualities. It puzzled him how Longbottom managed to get sap-a key ingredient- from the Devil's Snare. An antidote for his current condition would be nearly impossible to find! </p><p> His office was dark and cool. It sent chills racing down his spine. At that moment, the potions master wanted nothing more than to grind himself against the chair until the humming in his prostate area and the contractions of his sphincter muscles relaxed. Snape adjusted himself in his trousers. He had work to do. <em>Yes, work...</em>he thought to himself. He strenuously gulped. The quill wobbled in his tight grip. He placed the tip on the paper and begun grading, but only got halfway done when he felt the mystifying vibrations increased. He jerked violently, ink spilling over the parchments and off the corner of his desk. Snape gasped. His spine rolled with ecstasy and he dropped his head, dark hair spilling over his face. He couldn't help but dig his nails in the wood of desk for support.</p><p>"Severus?"</p><p>Startled, Snape jerked his head around to see Professor McGonagall's stern eyes on him. He could see her upper body in the green flames, arms crossed over her chest. "You're on night patrol today. You might want to take precautions on the East Towers. Someone-which I believe is a student- has been procuring the entrance of the Devil's Snare."</p><p>Snape blinked as she disappeared.</p><p>
  <em>Longbottom...But how? And Why?</em>
</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>"Lum-" </p><p>A brownish-green tentacle wrapped around his wrist. His wand ripped from his grip. There was that wretched sound again, deafening as ever. But there was something different about it. There was a melodious quality to it, he had not heard before. Singing to him. Calling to him.</p><p>It was the Devil's Snare that had been calling him earlier, he realized-though he had not much time to dwell upon it due to his clothing dissolving from his pale skin. He was covered in some substance of the sort. </p><p>Severus had, at many points in his life, wished for numerous deaths. Being stripped bare and then crushed to death didn't quite make it to his long list. Well, beggars weren't choosers. He stopped his pitiless attempts at maneuvering his way out of its tight clutches and succumbed, going completely still. When the Devil's Snare almost entirely relinquished its hold on him, Snape felt like a fool. Of course! The more you resist the Devil's Snare, its tentacles squeezed around you-like a boa constrictor around its prey. </p><p>The Devil's Snare scoured his body, the mystifying substance still covering him. His senses heightened as a vine slithered across his chest, nipples taught and erection hard. More vines ran across his tailbone, his feet, and the underside of his penis where the skin of gland connected to his shaft. He shuddered as one slipped between the cleft of his arse and delved deep inside of him, exploring him as one took his throbbing length into its hot, lubricated caverns. Snape's head rolled back onto his shoulders, his hips snapping up.</p><p>"Trevor?" a voice strained out.</p><p>The Snare stopped its ministrations abruptly, freezing in mid-air. </p><p>  "Trevor? Where are you?"</p><p>If Snape had the capacity to know that the situation at hand was ignominious, he'd be the same shade as the ungainly boy who was now trying to walk back out unnoticed. Of course, Snare was quicker, a vine wrapping around Longottom's waist and hauling him into the air. The boy was covered in the same substance as he was, his clothes shedding from his body, stark naked, arse nearly as white as snow. Snape only had a moment to revel in Longottom's features before both of them were then discarded on the floor with their ankles and wrists bound, stretched to their limbs were sore. Snape's heart sped, fearing he'd be pulled apart.</p><p>Shluccck...Schlucsh...Shluccck...Schlucsh</p><p>Strands of his disheveled hair fell into his face as he raised his head.</p><p>He swallowed.</p><p>"Don't worry, Professor. It won't hurt if you relax."</p><p>Snape looked over at Longbottom and then back at the thick, voluptuous tentacle gliding towards his entrance. Closing his eyes, he released the tension in his lower muscles and waited.</p><p>And waited. </p><p>Suddenly, he gasped. The sphincter muscles stretched to accommodate the lubricated girth inches at a time. The vines released his ankles. His own heavy girth throbbed painfully.</p><p>"Ugghhh..." he moaned, toes digging into the ground. Pleasure racked through his every cell until his knees wobbled at the sensation of the Snare sliding in and out of him. In and out.  </p><p>In and out...</p><p>His thighs clamped together as the Devil's Snare rasped against a bundle of nerves that made him lose his mind. Vines wrapped around his the base of his thighs and pried them apart. Only his toes touched the ground, his hips in the air. Snape's fingers wrapped around the restraints of his wrists as if they'd give him support. </p><p>A sharp inhale left his throat as the Devil's Snare seemed to expand inside of him. It was an unbearable pleasure that bordered sharp pain. Severus Snape couldn't recount many sexual experiences in his morbid life and he feared that when all was done...would he want it to end? For the first time in decades, his mind was off of war, protecting others, and maintaining facades because no one truly knew where his loyalties reposed. </p><p> His stomach knotted. </p><p>Snape was gasping at this point, a wanton whore meeting the friction of each deep thrust of the Snare, and aroused at the prospect of his abdomen swelling as he was penetrated and deflating as Snare removed itself just to repeat the process. Any attempt at preserving his dignity in front of Longbottom was pointless-let alone futile. </p><p>Then he felt the gush of hot liquid seep inside of him. The tentacle flattened as it pumped its seed inside of Snape, then exited him to recoil into the dark recesses of the intimidating plant.</p><p>Blinking rapidly, Snape moaned in discontent as he stared at his jutting sex. It was absolute torture! </p><p>Severus then remembered Longbottom was in the room-no doubt suffering as he was.</p><p>His dark eyes skimmed over the boy's glistening and flushed body. What caught his attention was the rippling of Longbottom's swollen abdominal region. The longer he gawked at it, the more prominent it became. Almost as it was growing. As more seconds passed, Longbottom appeared to look like a pregnant woman in her third trimester and bordering on fourth. He looked as if he would 'pop'. Snape's eyes greedily watched as the young man's eyes squeezed closed and whimpered, his legs spreading apart, and chest falling rapidly. Rolling his hips, the boy cried out as he had never before writhing in...pleasure? </p><p>Snape had been so distracted at the spectacular sight that he didn't acknowledge the gradual expanding of his belly until he could feel the slight burn of his stretching skin. More curious than anything, he observed the transformation of the egg forming to completion. Suddenly, the vines around his ankles and thighs vanished, and he took no time into feeling up his swollen torso; firm and incredibly large. The palms of his hands gently caressed the bulging underside of his belly. Nothing could prepare for the contraction rippling its way through his every muscle. It left him shaking and heaving for air and his cock immensely throbbing. There was no doubt that whatever was inside him wanted to be born. "Ooohhhh-" The tentacles inside him moved around before making its descent downward, causing the potions professor to engage in pushing. How was he going to catch his breath when-</p><p>The creature inside of him brushed his prostate. It drove him mad at the feel of each individual tentacle grazing his sensitive nerves.</p><p>He couldn't take it anymore!</p><p>Snape grounded into the ground and the body of the young snare peeked out of his stretched pink hole. Snape's eyes rolled in his sockets and his milky, white thighs were spread as far as was physically possible. His hips abruptly raised from the floor, legs quivering and breath stuttering. Severus rocked against the propelled movements of the Snare. It felt as if he was being f#cked from the inside and his mouth parted at another contraction.</p><p>"Uuuggghhh!" </p><p>Indescribable bliss rolled through him. His panting was lewd and uncontrollable. His moaning grew louder as he grew closer and cock twitched. He caught his bottom lip, bearing down and spreading his arse as wide as possible and pushed for the last time. Severus' hips rolled through each wave of orgasm as the Snare pushed against his prostate and through his stretched hole. Of their own accord, his vocal cords produced a scream, his body jerking, chest heaving, and his hot semen spilling onto his ribs.</p><p>The Devil's Snare slid out of him and found its progenitor. </p><p>When his high dissipated, he noticed Longbottom giving him a knowing look. </p><p>"How long will that blasted potion's effects last?" Snape grumbled out, more aroused than ever. </p><p>"Until the mating season is over for the Snare," Longbottom replied, casually examining the new snares produced.</p><p>Snape gritted his teeth, but it slowly morphed into a smirk the more he scrutinized the young man. </p><p>Piercing dark eyes latching on to Neville Longbottom, Severus then raised his pointer finger in a come-hithering motion, dragging his tongue across his bottom lip.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>
