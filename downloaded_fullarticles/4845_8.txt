    <p>CHAPTER I</p>
<p>	 “SIRIUS!” Harry cries, ripping his arms from Remus’ grip as his magic sends a Stinging Hex to the werewolf. He pitches himself forward, after Sirius. He couldn’t be dead, he only fell into a piece of fabric. There is a way to get him back. <br/>
As Remus futilely attempts to grasp his arm, to hold him back, Harry runs into the veil, a wave of cold washing over him, an arm reaching out for his fallen godfather. <br/>
The next thing he knows, he’s falling through the air, and then colliding with the ground. </p>

<p>	To say the Avengers were surprised to have a boy fall onto the lawn of their new base was an understatement. Steve was shocked when Falcon had called him on the comms, saying that their security had been breached from above, and now a young man was lying in the markings that were left where Thor had taken off not even a week ago.<br/>
A junior agent gives him a quick rundown of the boy. “He appears to be a teenager, 17 at the most. The kid has a strange cloth on him, and a strangely carved stick on his person, sir.”<br/>
Steve gives a nod, dismissing the agent. <br/>
“How is this guy still alive? The footage shows him falling from almost a mile up. Maybe an Asgardian?” Steve asked Sam , standing near the kid’s prone forms with his wings on.<br/>
“I don't know, he looks like he’s down for the count Cap,” he shrugged. “Aren't Asgardians a little more resilient? And not dropped from about a mile up?”<br/>
“We should get him to the infirmary, then.” Steve tilts his head, considering. “We can call in Tony and SHIELD and ask him,” he nods to the men, “about how he got here when he’s conscious.” he motions for the med team to cart the teen off to the infirmary. <br/>
Turning away from the scene at hand, Steve pulls out his phone. “Hey Stark. We have a problem.”<br/>
“Please tell me it's not aliens.” Tony jokes through the phone.<br/>
“Uh, yeah, we think it of is. We had a teen, looks 17 at the oldest  fall from over a mile up, he’s unconscious in the infirmary now.”<br/>
“What do you want me to do Capsicle? We're on vacation,” Tony whines.<br/>
“Nothing yet, but he’s a potential threat especially since he breached headquarters and we didn’t know until after it happened when we looked at the footage,” Steve explains. Suddenly, there's a tap on his shoulder. <br/>
“He’s waking, sir,” one of the new recruits says. <br/>
“Thank you, I'll be there in a moment.” he nods, turning back to his call with Tony. “I'll have Jarvis update you later. Bye Tony.”<br/>
“Later, Cap,” Tony hangs up.<br/>
Steve slides his phone into a pocket of his training clothes, striding to the infirmary. Since his threat level was unknown, he was placed in secure rooms that only high level clearances had access to. Steve opened the door to the teen’s room first, since he looked to be in a slightly better condition, stepping in. Immediately, a bright green gaze pierced his own and a flurry of questions spouted out the kid’s mouth.<br/>
“Where am I? How did I get here? Who are you? Where's Sirius? Is he alive?” he demanded, stopping when Captain America held up a hand. <br/>
“You're in a secure facility in New York. I’m not sure who Sirius is, but we found you alone. My name’s Steve Rogers. As for how you got here, I was hoping you could tell us that. Can you tell me your name, son?”<br/>
The teen looked slightly panicked with this knowledge, and a bit shocked. “My name’s Harry Potter. Are you sure there was no one else? About this tall,” he gestures vaguely with his hand, “Black hair to his shoulders, stubble?” <br/>
“Sorry Harry, we didn’t find anyone else in a five mile radius of you.” Steve says apologetically, watching the teen visibly deflate.<br/>
“No, no, no. That's not how it was supposed to happen. I was supposed to save him and I wasn’t going to have to stay at the Dursley’s ever again,” Harry looks about ready to cry, so Steve lays a comforting hand on his shoulder, ignoring the small flinch that accompanies it. <br/>
“Okay, maybe if you tell me how you got here we can figure out where your friend went,” Steve suggests.<br/>
“He’s my godfather,” Harry mumbles, running his hands through his hair. “And I don't think I can tell you, you're a Mu-” he freezes, his hands darting down to search his emptied pockets. <br/>
Steve looks at him, confused. “I’m a what? And what are you looking for?”<br/>
Bright green eyes shoot up to meet his blue nervously. “Ah-um- would you have found a stick and a weird silver cloth by any chance?”<br/>
“That depends. What are they?” Steve asks, raising an eyebrow.<br/>
Harry leans forward, his hands resting on his forehead. Making a decision, he sits back again, shocking green eyes meeting bright blue. “They're a wand and Invisibility Cloak, respectively. They're mine, and I'm a wizard.”</p>

<p>	No one really knew much about Tony Stark. Not even his girlfriend Pepper Potts. Sure, the press thought they knew about the billionaire- he was a playboy and frequently drunk. Of course, no one really knew that Tony Stark was never actually born. Tony Stark was just an idea put into people's heads by magic. Tony Stark was a persona, made by himself and Howard Stark in 1990, just a year before Howard died, the year “Tony” had appeared. <br/>
See, the secret was, Sirius Black did make it through the Veil. He just didn't go the same place, ahem, time, as Harry.<br/>
So here Sirius Black was, posing as the son of the late Howard Stark, oblivious of his follower through the Veil. He'd Transfigured his appearance slightly, only using magic to change his eyes from their usual silver to a dark brown that matched Howard's, and cutting his hair. He stayed drunk to forget the world he left behind, his pup, his family, the war he left behind, throwing himself into the technology of this time, trying to find a way to get back.<br/>
Then, the Avengers happened, and the Tesseract was found and the Bifrost discovered. The Tesseract had the power and the potential to get him back. Of course, S.H.I.E.L.D. had gotten the Tesseract first, and then it’d been taken back to Asgard with Thor and Loki. The Bifrost also held potential, but Asgardians wouldn’t stoop so low as to transport a mortal  such as him. Jane Foster’s work, of course was unparalleled, the only issue being that the portal required another portal in the location you would be travelling. <br/>
So here he was, alone, holed up in hhis lab, trying to find a way home, when he was interrupted by the good Captain with some trivial matter or another that really didn’t concern him. Until he saw the kid.</p>
