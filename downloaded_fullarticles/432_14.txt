    <p>
  <span>Thoros Nott was an old, bigoted wizard with a good head of hair, all his own teeth, a vast fortune and a son who seemed utterly disinterested in producing grandchildren.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>His son rarely spoke to him anymore, not that he’d been a particularly verbose adolescent – the boy had a gift for succinct statements that hinted at </span>
  <em>
    <span>something</span>
  </em>
  <span> – but Thoros had known the boy since infancy and could read his son’s body language, not exactly like a book, but the metaphor worked for Thoros’ purposes.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>And Theodore’s body language said that </span>
  <em>
    <span>something</span>
  </em>
  <span> had changed recently, but without the accompanying words Thoros couldn’t say what, precisely, had changed.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Thoros decided that the day his house arrest ended he would find out.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Because he would not tolerate having to wait any longer for his grandchildren, and he would do his best to ensure those grandchildren had the most potential for magical greatness.</span>

  <span> </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Lunchtime on the Saturday after Thoros’ house arrest ended found the man somewhat amusedly watching his son twist his signet ring and glance at the clock.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Who are you escorting to this event tonight?” Thoros finally asked, watching his son carefully.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Nobody,” the boy replied.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“So, they didn’t give you a plus one? That’s quite the faux pas, what </span>
  <em>
    <span>is</span>
  </em>
  <span> the world coming to?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“No, they did, father,” the boy replied somewhat hurriedly, “It’s a fundraising ball sponsored by the firm and there was no one of my acquaintance whom I could bring who wasn’t already invited.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Thoros saw the unintentional opening and took it.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Wonderful, </span>
  <em>
    <span>I</span>
  </em>
  <span> wasn’t invited, I will patronize this event and attend with you,” he said, hiding a grin as his son blinked deliberately for a moment, before adding, “My invitation must’ve got lost in the mail. What is the dress code for such an event, Black Tie Robes I assume?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He watched as his son swallowed and then answered in the affirmative.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Later, as they waited for the invitational portkey to activate, Thoros questioned the garish orange boutonniere adorning his son’s robes.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>What</span>
  </em>
  <span> is that?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>His son looked down at his chest before replying, with perfect unconcern.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“It’s a flower.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Thoros snorted as the portkey activated and whisked them away.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>-~-</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Thoros was pleasantly surprised by the décor and entertainment as he stood at the top of the stairs that lead to the bar in </span>
  <em>
    <span>L’Abeille’s</span>
  </em>
  <span> ballroom. His son, standing stiffly beside him, responded in monosyllables as he made comments about the guests, the canapes, the specialty cocktail and the overall ambiance.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The boy appeared to be doing his best to </span>
  <em>
    <span>not</span>
  </em>
  <span> look like he was looking for someone.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Theo, you’re here!” Came a feminine voice and Thoros watched his boy pale and then colour before greeting their guest.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Hello Granger, good to see you,” the young woman – </span>
  <em>
    <span>Granger</span>
  </em>
  <span> – smiled at Theodore before catching sight of his lapel.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh, Theo, a marigold,” she exclaimed, grinning, “Did you know that that’s my favourite flower?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Thoros smirked as his son made a non-committal noise.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“And look,” she continued, “We match!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Granger pointed at a flower that was nestled somewhat precariously amongst a nest of artfully arranged curls.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“A happy coincidence,” Theodore replied. Thoros decided that he needed an introduction with this woman.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Ahem,” he said, causing Theodore to stiffen in muted surprise, “Aren’t you going to introduce us?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Of course, Father, may I present Miss Hermione Granger,” came the wooden reply, “Miss Granger, my father, Thoros Nott.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“A pleasure to meet you, sir,” The girl held a hand out.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“The pleasure is mine,” Thoros replied, taking her hand and bowing over it, “Tell me, Miss Granger, how do you know Theodore?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh, Theo has been so helpful in helping me navigate the Ministry’s politics and get the requirement for mandatory representation by an advocate for those standing in front of the Wizengamot. Did you know that they just sent people to Azkaban when they are awaiting trial? That’s not conducive to good mental or physical health – especially in the event of their innocence. And the ministry was set to persecute some </span>
  <em>
    <span>underage</span>
  </em>
  <span> Slytherins as though the whole war was their fault, you know, and some of their family representatives just left them hung out to dry. Didn’t want to ‘fight a losing battle’, one told me. He won’t be getting hired by any of the purebloods </span>
  <em>
    <span>now</span>
  </em>
  <span>, will he? Either you’re a defense lawyer or you are not, you don’t get to be choosy. I couldn’t let that go on, muggles have had some form of court appointed defense for ages - there is no reason why wizards and witches shouldn’t!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You seem very passionate about this, Miss Granger,” Thoros noted.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Well, injustice just </span>
  <em>
    <span>bothers me</span>
  </em>
  <span>, it always has, and I won’t let the Ministry rest on its laurels and go back to bad habits where it just throws people into prison without a trial and forgets about them. Also, deliberately turning prisoners insane and threatening their very souls is barbaric and probably against the Geneva Convention…” She trailed off, “Theo does the ICW prosecute war crimes? My understanding is that they are similar to the United Nations, do they have a version of The Hague?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’d have to look into it Granger, maybe it could be our next project.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I could also help you, Miss Granger,” Thoros noted his son’s sudden furrowed brow and decided that he wanted to get to know this ‘Granger’ person in more detail, “I will ask Theodore to set up a meeting.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Theo interrupted cleanly, “Granger, would you do me the honour of joining me for the first set?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Miss Granger smiled and took his hand but not before Thoros was able to cut in with “The </span>
  <em>
    <span>first</span>
  </em>
  <span> set, Theodore?” to which his son stonily replied, “Of course.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>A chat with Lucius Malfoy as the two young people danced and socialized (well, she did the socializing,) illuminated Thoros to specifically </span>
  <em>
    <span>who</span>
  </em>
  <span> Hermione Granger was to a certain dark lord.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yes,” the blonde dandy continued, “and the girl has an almost ridiculous sense of justice – this little project of hers is just the tip of the iceberg. Not that I am complaining, mind you, Draco came out of that unpleasantness </span>
  <em>
    <span>quite</span>
  </em>
  <span> well due to her and her little friends, let me tell you. And it is fun watching her tear into the so-called light families even as she berates and scolds the dark ones. The girl is loyal to a fault, you know, I think if Dumbledore hadn’t planned for, ahem, </span>
  <em>
    <span>you know</span>
  </em>
  <span>, to kill the boy then she would have stayed unendingly aligned to the light.” A sigh. “She </span>
  <em>
    <span>is</span>
  </em>
  <span> undeniably a Gryffindor, though, disgustingly so, but she does have a remarkable aptitude for blackmail and revenge. It’s a shame about her… heritage. We could have molded her into a useful ally. Oh well, the wheel turns, and we will be on top again.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Thoros didn’t think so, too many half-bloods were marrying into the old families, too many old families with unacceptable or worse, </span>
  <em>
    <span>unremarkable</span>
  </em>
  <span> heirs.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Thoros was determined that his family would be apart from the wheel, always above, always at an advantage.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>-~-</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Join me for a nightcap, Theodore.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It was not a request and the two men made their way into the master’s study and sampled an old brandy.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You want her, Potter’s muggleborn,” Thoros said, eyeing his son whose head shot up in surprise, “Oh don’t look so surprised, you danced the first </span>
  <em>
    <span>and</span>
  </em>
  <span> the supper set with the girl. You </span>
  <em>
    <span>want</span>
  </em>
  <span> her. I’ll help you get her.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“She’s not a thing, father, you can’t just pick her out of a crowd and take her home,” the boy was emoting, </span>
  <em>
    <span>interesting</span>
  </em>
  <span>, “And she’s not </span>
  <em>
    <span>Potter’s</span>
  </em>
  <span> anything. She is her own person who -”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yes, yes,” Thoros interrupted, having made up his mind, “But you can’t just gaze forlornly at a woman or spend time in her general proximity and have her fall in love with you.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What would you know?” Theodore mumbled into his glass.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“As much as those romantic writers would like to believe, bottling up your feelings until they explode in a sudden confession of adoration is not attractive,” Thoros continued, and then narrowed his eyes, “And I know, because I am observant and have female relations. That and your mother thought it was terribly amusing to have eavesdropping charms linking her parlor to my study when her sisters and acquaintances came to visit.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Mother did that?” Theodore perked up with interest.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yes, she hated her relatives, why do you think she married me? I was her father’s rival in the Wizengamot and she pursued me relentlessly. She wanted to marry someone more powerful than your grandfather, someone who wouldn’t care that she was not a ‘proper lady’ as she termed it.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Her</span>
  </em>
  <span> grandmother was a Greengrass and they have some peculiarly restrictive views on how witches should behave. She took perverse joy in making her parents uncomfortable and she found most of the women of her age and status tedious. She made me listen to their conversations so that I knew what she was laughing at later. She especially hated the talk of their babies,” Thoros sighed, “Until you came along, that is, she was in </span>
  <em>
    <span>awe</span>
  </em>
  <span> of you when you were born. And she was so proud when you cut your first tooth before the Malfoy boy. She gloated for weeks.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>There was silence for a few moments.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“But, back to your Miss Granger, you are in danger of vomiting your feelings all over her and she will think that your entire acquaintance has been a ploy to get under her skirts.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Thoros noted the boy’s cheeks redden slightly.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I am going to give you some honest advice, you may choose to take it or not. Granted my ideas haven’t always panned out in the grand scheme of things, but this is based upon several decades of investigation, so to speak.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Theodore nodded.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“The next time you see Miss Granger, say ‘Miss Granger, I quite enjoyed working with you over the past year - or however long it has been – and I find that my feelings have evolved beyond that of just colleagues,’” Thoros paused, “This shows that you haven’t been deceiving her, which Gryffindors loathe by the way, and then add ‘If you think you might feel the same way, I would like to meet up with you in a non-work environment, are you free this Saturday for dinner?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Theodore was clearly paying attention.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“There are a few responses she may have,” the older man continued, “One, most ideally, she says ‘Yes’, you take her to dinner, have good conversation, organize another and begin courting her with the aim of marriage. Two, she says no, but it is </span>
  <em>
    <span>how</span>
  </em>
  <span> she says no that counts. If she says No, it is, regrettably, a no, however, she may say, ‘No, I can’t do Saturday’ </span>
  <em>
    <span>and then suggests another time.</span>
  </em>
  <span> This is why you have to provide a particular day, it stops the muddying of the whole suggestion of courtship. Either way, she will continue thinking you are a gentleman and will not provide the experience as fodder for the society pages.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Theodore looked thoughtful.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Of course, you’ll have to make the words sound like you and not your father.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Theodore sniffed and rose, “If I may be excused, father, I’ve had a rather long day.”</span>
</p>
<p>
