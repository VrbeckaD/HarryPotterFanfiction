    <p>Marinette arrived at the station exactly half an hour before the train was supposed to leave. Her parents thought it would be a good idea to get there early so that they could see friends and make sure their daughter was ready. Her mom was wearing a blue scarf with bronze stripes and her dad was wearing a yellow scarf with black stripes, both proudly representing their houses from when they were in school. Marinette felt rather embarrassed by this, but she loved seeing her parents so excited, especially when their excitement matched her own.</p><p>Today, September 1st, would be Marinette Dupain-Cheng’s first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and she couldn’t be more thrilled. Hogwarts was, afterall, the place where she would learn to harness and use her magic. The place that she would be sorted into her own house, meet her lifelong friends, and if she’s as lucky as her parents, she may meet her future husband. The possibilities were endless for Marinette, all she had to do was run through the wall between platforms nine and ten..</p><p>Marinette is only eleven, but she’s always been good with situations that would make most others nervous. She’s never afraid to step up to a challenge. She pushes the tendrils of her shoulder length black hair behind her ears. Her bluebell eyes shine bright and make her whole face seem to light up with joy and eagerness.</p><p>“Don’t be scared sweetie, you won’t feel a thing,” her dad reassures her.</p><p>“Don’t worry, Papa. I’m not scared.”</p><p>And on that note she pushes her cart through the wall and follows it into what appears to be nothingness. Colors swirl all around her until she emerges at a busy platform full of people. Witches and WIzards everywhere, she can’t help but watch in awe. She looks up to see a sign that reads “Platform 9 3/4 “</p><p>“Marinette,” Mrs. Dupain-Cheng’s voice pulls Marinette away from the awestruck feeling she was having. “Look, it’s the Lahiffe’s! Let’s go say hello.” And on that note, Marinette follows her parents to go say hello to her neighbors. A young boy with glasses walks up to her and smiles. “Yo, Marinette, how’s it going?” The boy is Nino Lahiffe, and the two of them have been neighbors all their lives. Nino has dark skin, dark brown eyes with glasses and short brown hair, which he normally puts a hat over.</p><p>“Nino! I’m so glad I found you, I was scared I’d have to sit alone.”</p><p>They both laughed together and talked for a while, that is until someone new catches her eye.</p><p>He looks her age, with golden locks on his head, not a single hair out of place. And when he turns, she’s met with eyes that light up the whole room, a vibrant green that stands out against his pale skin. She didn’t even realize that he had made eye contact with her. She could hear her heart pounding from within her chest. He’s gorgeous, Marinette finds herself thinking. I wonder who he is.</p><p>The boy simply smiled at her, but he wasn’t the only one who noticed her staring.</p><p>“Well if it isn’t Marinette Dupain-Cheng.”</p><p>Oh no, she thinks when a voice breaks her out of her trace. For when she turns, it’s none other than Chloe Bourgeois standing behind her. Chloe keeps her blonde hair high up in a ponytail, and she has icy blue eyes that seem to chill people to the bone. Chloe comes from a very rich pure-blood family and has always hated Marinette, ever since they were children. Nino tries to ignore the fact that she didn’t acknowledge him by making conversation.</p><p>“Hey Chl-”</p><p>“Don’t even try to talk to Adrien” Chloe declares toward Marinette, completely ignoring Nino’s greeting. “He is mine, and we don’t talk to losers like you.” Marinette could only stare back at her, confusion all over her face. “Who’s Adrien?” Chloe laughs just as her father walks over and interrupts.</p><p>“Chloe, Darling, let’s go see your friend Sabrina, she’s right over there,” he suggests. Chloe lets out an exasperated sigh.</p><p>“Fineee Dad,” she exhaled as she flipped her hair around and stalked away without another word.</p><p>Only when Chloe is out of earshot does NIno ask aloud, “What was she talking about? Who’s Adrien?”</p><p>His question was quickly answered from an unseen source. “Adrien Agreste. She’s talking about Adrien Agreste.”</p><p>Marinette and Nino snap their heads around to see where the disembodied voice came from only to be reassured that it wasn’t disembodied at all. Standing behind them was a lanky boy who looked like he should be a few years older because of his height but his baby face begged to differ. His tomato red hair falls into his dark green eyes, and something about his demeanor tells Marinette he’s just as surprised to have said anything.</p><p>Now with two sets of eyes on him, he looks down and continues, a bit more nervously, and with much less conviction.</p><p>“He’s the blonde boy over there.” He points out the boy that Marinette had been staring at and her cheeks turn a light said of pink. The color immediately fades when the boy opens his mouth to continue speaking. “I would stay away from him if I were you, comes from a long line of Slytherins, the Agreste’s have always been particularly into dark magic. Death Eaters, back when Voldemort was in power like fifty years ago.” He immediately stops talking and looks up as though he realized he said too much. He immediately starts blushing when he makes eye contact with Marinette. “Oh, I’m uh Nathaniel. Nathaniel Kurtzburg.”</p><p>Marinette is quick to smile warmly at him and introduce herself. “I’m Marinette Dupain-Cheng,” she proudly proclaims. “And this is Nino Lahiffe,” Nino grins at Nathaniel and patted him on the shoulder. “Nice to meet you, dude,” he cheerily says, making Nathaniel smile.</p><p>When It’s time to board, Marinette and Nino say goodbye to their families and board the train at last. When they find an empty compartment, they claim it for their own and sit across from each other. Before the train leaves Marinette notices someone in the hall looking a bit lost. She was tan, and had long red wavy hair, much darker than Nathaniel’s had been, and light brown eyes framed with a pair of glasses. Marinette doesn’t know why, but she gets a really good feeling about her.</p><p>Marinette got up, slid the door open and stuck her head out.</p><p>“Hello, I’m Marinette. Why don’t you come sit in here with us?”</p><p>The girl looks beyond relieved. “I would love that,” she breaths. “I’m Alya.”</p><p>Alya enters the compartment and sits down next to Marinette and then turns to Nino, seeming a lot more confident now that she’s found a place to go. “Hi, I’m Alya Cessaire,” she said to him, at which he starts to blush and tries to hide it with his hat. “I-um-I’m N-nino,” he managed to get out. Marinette gave him a knowing look and he pretended not to see it.</p><p>The three of them became quite comfortable talking and laughing with one another. Alya tells them how she was muggle-born, and Marinette and Nino quickly began telling her all they knew about the Wizarding World. Alya drank in every word, beyond fascinated with all they were telling her.</p><p>After about an hour into the ride, they were in the middle of discussing different classes at Hogwarts when the doors slide open again, and to Nino and Marinette’s amazement, the boy with blond hair and green eyes steps into the compartment.</p>
