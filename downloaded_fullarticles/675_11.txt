<p>Why did they hurt him? No one wanted him. No one! Even when he tried to control his quirk. When he started wearing the bands, the schools required of him. Not that his quirk couldn't destroy them or anything. Like it had destroyed any chance of anyone wanting him. He was a-a monster... but weren't they too? At least he hadn't wanted to hurt anyone. Not like the people that he was forced to stay with. Even his own parents didn't want him. Abandoning him. Shinsou... he was no longer with him. Moved to another foster home again. Closer to UA, where Harry knew he wanted to go to school, Always abandoned for a hero, by a hero, visions of grandeur.</p>
<p>He couldn't understand... How could he do that to him? Where was his hero? That's right, they walked right on by. He didn't remember much about when he was tiny. Just the utter disappointment his parents showed in him. He wasn't what they had wanted. Him, being an omega, had been absolutely forgivable... lots of great heroes were Omegas! His mother, who had been an elite ranking hero, was an omega!... But his temperament and progressively more vicious quirk had not been. Too passive, gentle, shy, unsure... <em><strong>unheroic</strong></em>. These things. They could <em><strong>not</strong></em> be forgiven.</p>
<p>Harrison had been the result... of a quirk marriage. His parents were not hateful towards each other, like most individuals to enter such a marriage... Truthfully they had been very much in love, but their end goal in a child wasn't such a good thing at all. It was selfish and some could even call it a bit villainous, to be honest. To force all of their ambitions on a child... even if in the end that wasn't what the child would want. He was made for one purpose. To be the number one hero. He had no other purpose and wasn't allowed his own hopes and dreams. That was what he had been taught from the moment he could understand speech and it stuck with him.</p>
<p>Once they realized they had failed in making what they had been trying to. A child with an amazing flashy quirk to allow their family once again to rule the heroes. The more they pushed the more out of control his quirk became. The more dangerous it became... The more power it showed. They had called it potential even as it lashed out and tore apart everything around it over and over again once he was unable to handle their 'tough love' anymore. Until eventually the quirk he once had so little trouble with became a lashing burning monstrous wall against the world... Against <em><strong>them</strong></em>. They figured out soon after that he wasn't going to be able to be molded into what they needed and left him, a no older than 4 or 5 year old Harry near a local hospital.</p>
<p>Everyone just walked on by. Even as Harry did his best to try to get their attention. Anyone's, for nearly 3 days. Glances. Murmurs, pointing, but no one stopped. Everyone assured each other that a hero would show up... But... Harry's hero never came. No matter how much he hoped and wished and begged for one there was no hero for him. They<em><strong> didn't</strong></em> have to be anyone special, he hadn't asked for someone like All Might or Endeavor... No, they were busy people and they were surely saving lots and lots of people that needed it more... Hurt people! But... a Hero, anyone if they had just held out their hand and actually stopped to ask him what was wrong. If he was hungry and scared that's all he asked for. He would have been overjoyed to have that sort of hero... But... He was a defective child and no one wanted someone like him. No one wanted to become <em><strong>his</strong></em> hero...</p>
<p>No, a young man walking from the building in dark clothes after being released from its psych ward, of all places, had to run him into the hospital nearly dead from low blood sugar. Unwilling to leave until he was rushed into care. The very same doctor that had pointedly, disgustedly, pulled himself away from and told Harry to go home the last two days was also his attending doctor for the time he was in the hospital.</p>
<p>Harry had been confused. Scared, when he woke. He did his best to explain that his Mommy and Daddy didn't want him anymore. He couldn't do what they wanted him to do. So they took him there. At night a young man with black hair and strange facial features visit him. He told him all about how he found him. He asked about how Harry ended up there and Harry, of course, explained how he made his parents unhappy with him. How he couldn't be what they wanted like a good boy would and how his quirk was very very bad. The man had a strange look on his face when he asked who Harry's parents were. Harry, of course, told him that they were super awesome heroes! After that, the man smiled and talked to him nicely for a long time. Harry hadn't remembered anyone being that nice to him for so long. He even petted Harry's curly black hair and told him stories until he fell asleep! For once, Harry felt safe.</p>
<p>The next day consisted of mostly being alone until some policemen came. They demanded... though a bit nicer, to know where he came from and what happened. Then they asked about his parents too. The plain looking black haired man that visited looked... uncomfortable. Though Harry wasn't sure why. Harry never thought to tell them about the nice man that had visited him either.</p>
<p>That night, once everyone was gone again and Harry was made to sit all alone... again... the man came back, all smiles. Harry smiled back at the man. The man that was kind to him and smelled so safe even if he smelled strongly of metal for some reason. Harry couldn't help but light up when the man pulled a familiar stuffed animal from his jacket and plopped him right next to Harry. Paddy! He had been the only toy he had been left with once his quirk began to act up. A family heirloom. The last few weeks before dumping him off even he had been taken away and put up on a tall shelf that Harry had no hope of getting to. Harry couldn't have been happier at that moment.</p>
<p>The man spoke to Harry all nice like again. Harry wished that the man had been his daddy instead of his own. Harry had been told that day that they would be trying to get into contact with his parents and even though he insisted it wasn't that he hadn't run away like they kept saying, they kept insisting that he was going to be returned. He knew that good boys shouldn't.. <em><strong>not</strong></em> want to go home but-but... he-he didn't think his parents liked him that much to be honest. He loved them lots and lots but... he got the distinct impression that they didn't feel the same and that... even at his young age hurt more than anything else they could have and had already done to him.</p>
<p>Harry couldn't help but let out a little purr when the man petted his hair again and tucked him in with the heated blanket. His quirk didn't get all weird when the man touched him like when other people even looked at him. Harry watched with half-hooded eyes as the man looked at the clipboard full of papers he snatched from the end of the bed, starting near the middle, he began copying things down. He was so happy when he told him that he would be coming the next night to bring him to his house and to not tell anyone because he wasn't technically allowed there.</p>
<p>Harry's parents were dead. The number 3 and number 7 heroes were gone, murdered in their estate. They had died terrible deaths. One drowned in his own blood from horrifically precise cuts to his lungs while the other's spine had been cracked all the way up the middle like a lobster shell and before that, his ribs had been splayed.</p>
<p>Harry was discharged by 3. Drug to some lady's home by 5. She was an older woman, severe, with claws for hands. She looked him up and down with a satisfied smile, approving when she saw his beautiful black curls and striking green eyes. He quickly learned she liked things, animals and people of good breeding. Treating most of the children under her care more like trophies than like living beings. A boy close to Harry's age had been her favorite before he showed up. A boy named Hitoshi, a boy like him who knew how to behave well and to stay out of the way despite his slightly younger age. He already knew how to charm the people around him even as much as he seemed to despise doing so. She didn't like Harry so much after his quirk began acting up again though. His horrible, horrible evil quirk... and when Hitoshi's quirk became noticeable... it became too much for her. She had gotten rid of the both of them. This was the start of a pattern for the pair. No one wanted them and none of the other children wanted anything to do with them.</p>
<p>Hitoshi was the son of an underground hero that never wanted to be a parent. The mother had dumped him on the man at only a couple days old so in turn, he dumped him at children's services at 6 months old. Tired of trying to parent a child that he had no emotional connection to and the guilt of being unable to connect slowly getting worse as time went by. The man was rearing to get back to his job full time and hoped that by giving him up, he would end up finding a family that would actually want him. He, at the very least, had signed Hitoshi over to Children's services instead of full out abandoning him somewhere. This is why Hitoshi, like Harrison, was treated with more care. Given to upper middle-class homes a lot. Once children's services had realized separating he and Harry was an ill-advised idea they did their best to keep them together... at first things weren't... horrible... just.. Not great. That didn't last forever, though, as they began running out of options.</p>
<p>Harry's quirk began to act worse. Hitoshi was more sullen. But... Hitoshi.. He began to dream. To follow his dreams. Harry didn't have dreams. He hadn't been allowed to want anything for himself when he was younger. He was defective. A nobody with a terrible quirk. The betrayal stung. Hitoshi wanted to be a hero. A hero? Didn't he get it? He already was a hero! <em><strong>His</strong></em> hero! His best friend in the whole world his protector his-his-. Harry wanted to die there and then when the purple haired boy announced that he had managed to convince his social worker that being in the environment he was in was holding him back in school and that he needed to go somewhere else!</p>
<p>Hitoshi... had. <em><strong>Abandoned </strong></em>him. His only everything... he was left all alone again! The strange muted apathy Harry had been feeling so long faded the very moment the other boy walked through the door, a smile on his face as he followed <em><strong>that </strong></em>woman. He <em><strong>knew </strong></em>how bad it was there. Hitoshi knew how <em><strong>abusive</strong></em> they were! Just because Harry refused to become a hero with him, he had been abandoned. Telling him, he needed to come to his senses.. Gone gone gone. <em><strong>GONE</strong></em>!</p>
<p>
  <strong>00000000000000</strong>
</p>
<p>A month after the other boy left, the social workers were asking if he wanted to talk with him. Pretending they didn't see how much thinner he was becoming or notice the bruises on his face were in the shape of his current/new foster father's meaty hand. They didn't even ease that fake smiling when they saw how his hands shook. He swore the newer one looked relieved even. They probably were just happy that he '<em><strong>wouldn't</strong></em>' be able to use his quirk that way. These people knew nothing of him or his quirk. Acting like nothing was wrong, like nothing had happened... No, he refused to talk to the other boy. Harry wouldn't let him hurt him like that too! Not after all those hurtful things he said after he <em><strong>ABANDONED</strong></em> him! They tried forcing it and sparks ran across Harry's skin, even with the bands on. The pair jumped fearfully and laugh uncomfortably. He was tired. Just so tired of them and everything at that point.</p>
<p>The social workers left after that. Clearly unnerved, one muttering about quirk counseling the other reassured the newer worker and said that it was children being children. He held back a snort. He had only visited a quirk councilor once and they hardly had him in the office for more than 5 minutes. His current caseworker had immediately intervened. He was her golden goose being the son of two elite pro-heroes and having such a quirk even if it was out of control. Fixing him would be in determent to her. Harry felt like the life had been rung out of him as his thoughts fixated on such things. He knew and yet it hurt. No matter how terrible people had been to him in the past... he remembered how much he wanted to believe in others. Now. He... he had no one.</p>
<p>Harry felt like his sorrow was eating him bit by bit. His absolute misery. Harry... he… was beginning to hate what he was turning into. But... bad children like him... they didn't have heroes to save them... Not even from themselves. Especially from themselves... It's something Hitoshi didn't yet get... Though... Harry didn't think the purple haired boy was broken... not like him. He wasn't born broken like Harry was... Born so broken his own parents couldn't even love him.</p>
<p>Hitoshi had a couple of years that someone loved him to try to justify his hero worship even if the one that had loved him had just been some crotchety old retired hero with a dozen or so cats. But like everyone, the pair seemed to touch... something bad eventually did happen that forced Hitoshi from his house full of cats and the only adult that ever loved him. The man had died on the way to the hospital after protecting Hitoshi from a home invader. Hitoshi had clung to the image of a hero. <em><strong>His</strong></em> hero... his hope stronger than Harry thought. The moment Shinsou told him about his... dreams.. What.. he planned to do. Harrison had known that he had lost him. His hero. His <em><strong>only</strong></em> friend.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>One day, late at night, the man Harrison had been forced to be fostered by was far worse than usual... so much worse. Harry could feel his quirk writhing angrily. Bitter. Under his skin. He wasn't sure what it was that day, but he had felt the boiling for days. The pain of what was essentially cuffs restraining him. They didn't know that he could use his quirk other ways. Though... in that moment it didn't matter. Even as weak as his body was in that very moment, something snapped in him. Not the kind when you absolutely lose your mind or anything like that but more like whatever had kept him beaten down, weak, his quirk had fed off of and ripped to tiny pieces. The last bits he had left of himself finally shattered. He wasn't safe. Never safe.</p>
<p>Green energy ripped through his restraints effortlessly burning and bubbling it away and tore apart everything around it with more ferocity then it had ever shown. It tore the house apart smashing, burning, it would not be restrained by such a flimsy box! Not while that man was anywhere near him, not while he-he could hit him again. Harry felt vaguely sick but that was easily ignored and overshadowed by the endorphic pleasure of no longer being suffocated even as terror was all consuming. Everything was twisted and melty like rotting flesh and heated candle wax as his twisting vision was overloaded.</p>
<p>Harry bolted from the rubble on instinct when it finally registered that, Hojo, was laying in a puddle of blood. Burns on every part of his body and one of the coffee table's splintered legs sticking out of his chest. There was no house left to speak of. He could hardly even think. He just wanted to be far far away from there!</p>
<p>Harry ran and ran and ran until his body just couldn't take it anymore and instead of being in the familiar rundown neighborhood full of tall narrow ticky tacky houses with tiny, dying yellow yards he was somehow fully in the city-city, even so, he recognized the place, bad news. It was what would normally be a nearly hour walk from the house. Harry gripped his chest as severe pain and dizziness kicked in. He panted as it seared through him. The sound of sirens not far off. Harry stumbled into a nearby alley panic filling him. Someone was there not far away. He could hear splashing. Even as scared as Harry was he decided to check out what was going on.</p>
<p>Harry's eyes widened a man with a knife and a strip of fabric for a mask threw, what Harry knew to be some dangerous murderer from tv, down into a puddle and stabbed him in the throat. He tried his best not to get noticed but another sudden stab of pain to his chest had him crying out and dropping to his knees. Vision going all spotted and bottle glassed. A sense of peace fell over Harrison. At least he wouldn't be able to be forced back.</p>

<p>Harry had found himself wrapped up, twitching almost violently, as he woke with swimmy vision. Harry's foggy head couldn't comprehend anything at that point.</p>
<p>The next time he woke he felt a lot better.. More himself. He still was too weak to even lift his own head though. It took a few minutes for him to realize what tasted like really strong apple juice was being dripped into his mouth.</p>
<p>The third time he woke to the smell of soup and gentle petting to his hair. When Harry met eyes with that man... he just knew before the man even held out Paddy. This man. This smell. This was the very same one from the hospital all those years ago. The man smiled ever so slightly and sat the stuffed dog next to Harry. Then made a point to silently feed him.</p>

<p>Harry found happiness with the man that had found him all those years ago. It hurt so much that the man, his dad, hadn't been able to have him from the beginning. Over a year had passed and even though they moved a lot Harry was content. Chizome was nothing but kind and loving and patient with him. Harry never thought he would have a hero. A true hero ever again! Not after Shinsou abandoned him but he now understood it was for a reason. So he could find his dad and now neither of them would ever be lonely again! He was so nice to him and never hurt him and they did nice things together all the time! He felt nothing but safe with him and he couldn't remember feeling that way for a very long time.</p>
<p>Harry would do the homework Chizome would have ready for him while he hunted down all of the filthy fake heroes after nothing but fame and money... Not caring what really happened to anyone and after he got home. Dad would get cleaned up and they would have dinner where he would tell him all about his nightly hunts and then they would do dishes and Dad would help him with the parts of his homework that he was confused about! Sometimes they would watch a movie or wait until dawn and take a walk then go to bed. Harry loved those days the most!</p>
<p>Chizome taught Harry all about the world and how most heroes were filthy fakes! How the population was brainwashed into believing in all heroes when all but a very small handful were disgusting takers and users and how they wanted nothing more than money.. To be famous and how they would thoughtlessly leave those that wouldn't be able to provide such things to them to rot in the dirt... Like-like they had done to him! To the both of them! The heroes were monsters, the true villains! Why were they allowed to live when there was so much suffering that they could prevent and didn't? Harry hated them! The very sight of them merrily waving at people as they patrolled, waving at him. Made him feel the need to retch.</p>
<p>Harry couldn't have been more thrilled when his father had done his best to help him learn how to control and train his quirk. Gently. Not like before, hurting him and beating him and starving him like his parents had done. Nor strangling it like everyone else forced him to do. Actually carefully worked with it. Harry had nearly burst out in tears when he would praise him.</p>
<p>It took a lot of work and time, but eventually, he had gained quite a bit of control of it. But it was so much more than that. His father had taught him his purpose in the world... or at least what it would soon be.</p>
<p>
  <strong>00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000</strong>
</p>
<p>One day or well night a few years later, Chizome told Harrison that a man demanded an audience with the hero killer. With Stain.. His father. Harrison hadn't come with, but it was clear the meeting hadn't gone well when he got back. It hadn't really mattered though because Harry was still able to lure the fraud into their trap. His father didn't want him to fight unless necessary, though. Harry was alright with that, for his father's peace of mind. He was the planner, the analytical one. The sweet syrup to drown the rat. He tried not to think about what would happen to those that fell into the traps he set. Out of sight out of mind after all… And he was helping people in the long run… right?</p>
<p>Harrison had bid his father goodbye once Stain had the fake hero under his control with his Blood Curdling quirk. Their cupboards had gotten quite bare after all and this would be the last kill before they left for another city so, as tradition dictated, they would have a nice meal before leaving. For that, Harry would have to go to a grocery store. He had done this dozens of times while his dad was finishing his hunts and it had gone on since he had hit an age that Chizome felt comfortable letting him wonder out on his own. Harry never even gave their odd 'barbaric feast' a second thought.</p>
<p>Harry left the grocery store with a smile, even as the person behind the register looked at him strangely. Probably because of his age, he suspected. That didn't matter though all that mattered was that he had actually managed to get a pack of steaks! They were one thing he always really loved. Most of the little all-night grocery stores he found usually marked all of the food that they would otherwise throw out at the end of the day ridiculously cheap a few hours before regular customers came in and they were forced to throw those things away. He saved so much on them that he was even able to buy a package of fresh fruit! He and his father were cautious with money as they could have to go into deep hiding at any time.</p>
<p>Harry hummed happily to himself, he couldn't wait to show his father the treat he had managed to get! It was rare to find really good fruit in one of the little locally(Probably criminally in that area) owned overnight grocery stores. Especially in areas like the one he was currently walking through.</p>
<p>Harry walked back towards the better area, nearby, that his father was probably still located. A numbness surged through Harrison when he saw fire. Everywhere... and heroes fighting some sort of giant monsters. Harry swallowed hard but forced himself to relax, calmly walking through the chaos with his bags of groceries. The weight of the scarf around his neck and the knife concealed beneath it helped to ground him. Fakes-frauds-abominations! Monster, vile beasts his brain hissed and refused to listen to his pleas to calm, unlike his body. Playing such things over and over again as he eyed them. Completely focused on the creatures.</p>
<p>Harry couldn't help but snort as the <em><strong>heroes</strong></em> played it up for the cameras he was sure were being pointed at them from the helicopters he could hear and see circling the area. It <em><strong>sickened</strong></em> him. But it wasn't like it mattered though. All this did was make it even easier for his father to pick them all off. He was sure Native was already…. Dea-extinguished, maybe he could help his dad find a few more to pick off? That thought immediately had Harry grinning from ear to ear again... And then. He wasn't.</p>
<p>Harry couldn't help but choke when he saw a handful of teens dragging his father's unconscious body from the very alley that they had entered a couple hours beforehand. Fury and hurt filled Harry burning and colder than ice. Harry hardly even noticed when the bags of groceries hit the ground, though no one else did either. No one even seemed to notice, out of all of the heroes that showed up... that he was standing right there. Stain's adoring accomplice.</p>
<p>Harry wanted to-to <em><strong>HURT</strong></em> them for hurting his father. Monsters, frauds, filthy fakes! They were <em><strong>EVIL</strong></em>! All they did was hurt, people! Good people! The <em><strong>REAL</strong></em> <em><strong>HEROES</strong></em>! Then suddenly one of those monster things he had seen earlier swooped down and even as beat up as he was his father stopped it and saved the boy grabbed by it. Harrison's father gave him a desperate look. "Leave." He told him. Begging with his eyes before turning. Harry forced his feet to move, to do as he was asked, even though everything told him to go back. He felt broken again. His happiness shattering bit by bit as the words from his father's familiar speech rattled through his brain of heroes and frauds and what a true hero was, comforting him one last time.</p>
<p>Harry didn't think it was possible to cry that much and live, but Harrison survived the following weeks. Tired and more miserable than he thought possible for a person to live through. Rage and hopelessness filled Harry as Endeavor's smirking face stared back at him through his computer screen. Smug as he spoke to the woman about the injuries his father had sustained and how he personally had already helped escort him to Turdus. Which was the supermax prison for only the worst of criminals. They took his hero! Hero hero heroes, Harry was alone <em><strong>ALL</strong></em> alone again. His only hero! The only person that cared. Filth! Disgusting, evil flith. Villains! Didn't they see that he was making the world a <em><strong>BETTER</strong></em> PLACE? Harry gripped his hair and clawed at his skelp.</p>
<p>Harry shook with the effort it took to control his quirk. Gritting his teeth from the boiling bitterness that stabbed through him like liquid ice in his veins. Then suddenly, he knew. Knew what to do! Harry grinned, glassy eyes gleaming as he saw the video of two people standing on a building far from the commotion... Watching. His hands twitched in excitement... The league of villains? Harry smiled and snatched up his father's contact book and cell phone, careful to avoid damaging the later with his quirk, he swiped through it frantically looking for the number that had called rather frantically the week beforehand. It was the number of the very same man that his father had commissioned, though grudgingly, for his weapons and Harrison's own scarf. A filthy parasite. A useful one though.</p>
<p>"Hello, Giran? What do you know about... The league of Villains? Oh? A meeting?"</p>
