    <p>Dear Albus,</p><p>I hope you are well. The start of this letter has proven to be one of the more difficult decisions of recent weeks; I hope, however, that the impression I left of myself has not faded in the long year I have spent travelling abroad. I would like to first extend to you my deepest and most profound condolences for the loss of your sister – Ariana was loved by you and your brother dearly, and before my departure I saw her loss had already profoundly affected you. As to the nature of my departure, I would like to make that my second apology – to leave you, my first and most dear friend, in such a position is perhaps my greatest regret to date. It is partly for that reason I extend to you these three things: a token, a gift, and a request.</p><p>The request is that of a return to our days of correspondence and mutual consultation; now, more than ever, I am in need of a mind like yours. As you may have heard, though I need not remind you to remain sceptical of all you hear, my cause has already taken root in the hearts and minds of many across Europe – and, I recently learned, beyond. This was made known to me during my most recent sojourn – a consultation with the alchemists of Alexandria. However, no sooner had I acclimatised myself to the Egyptian heat before I was greeted by the brothers Ehab and Sayed Daoud; the latter of whom hopes you remember him from your time in Cairo during the 639th International Alchemical Conference. With their endorsement, I was granted an audience with my now-tutor, Moustafa el Shafei, whose reputation no doubt precedes him.</p><p>And now we come to the gift – that gift being the creature no doubt preening before you. Once the prized companion my mentor, the mu’allim proved enamoured enough with either my wit or my skill – the latter of which I feel I still lack – to entrust me with such a rare honour. He noted how since leaving Dumstrang and attending these studies with such diligence, I had exchanged my scarlet plumage for gold – and that a phoenix would best demonstrate that transition. This is my gift. Upon seeing its dance of gold and red, I felt reminded so much more of your espousing of Gryffindor than of my dalliance with Durmstrang. If it had a name, I have not been told it - as such, feel free to christen him whatever name you see fit. Now, I need not explain a phoenix’s most incredible quality, but I hope that this letter might serve as a similar rebirth of our friendship – or, at least, of our correspondences.</p><p>Or, like the phoenix, you may just as possibly burn it. But to stay your hand, or perhaps to seal the compact I have now formed with you, I would present you with a token: a quill, as unique and valuable as I believe you yourself to be. This quill, hopefully found within the same envelope as this letter, is taken from the same phoenix you now own – it is unique, bar its one twin: the plume adoring the quill I use now to write this letter. I know of no innate magic associated with the plumage of phoenixes, but I feel the connection it forms between us needs no accoutrements.</p><p>I heard it said by Gregorovitch that no two phoenix feathers are alike, and for my purposes I hope that is true. If you accept my offer for renewed correspondency and correspondence, I wish for you to know that your words are written and presented to me in a manner more personal and unique than any signature. But I would not presume to guide your actions – once again, I extend my apologies and my offer of reparation.<br/>
<br/>
I cannot stress my sincerity, Albus, and I hope you consider this letter carefully.</p><p>Sincerely yours,</p><p>Gellert</p>
