  <span>Draco looked up when he heard the front door closing.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>“What the hell is that, Harry?” The look of excitement on the bespectacled git didn’t seem promising.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>“It’s a chameleon!” </span>
</p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>He raised a brow expecting for a longer explanation, as none was forthcoming he sighed dramatically. “And you brought it home because…?”</span>
</p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>“It fell on me from a window and when I tried to return it the owner begged me to keep it. As it seems her cat throws its terrarium every now and then.”</span>
</p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>“It fell on you.”</span>
</p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>“Uh-huh.”</span>
</p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>“Because of a homicidal cat?”</span>
</p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>“Seems so. Look! Aren’t its eyes hilarious?”</span>
</p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>Draco looked at the thing with disgust.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>“I think they’re creepy. Hmm, It kind of reminds me of my great uncle Alphard.”</span>
</p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>“We can call it that.”</span>
</p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>“What? No, we’re not keeping it.”</span>
</p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>The look on Harry’s face was one of exaggerated hurt and betrayal. “Why not?” he whined.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>“Because it’s...preposterous…and it creeps me out.”</span>
</p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>Draco watched as Harry stared down at the ugly thing, now moving leisurely on the table, the slight swaying motion unnerving. He raised both eyebrows, waiting for the counterattack.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>“I want to keep it.”</span>
</p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>“What?”</span>
</p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>Harry raised his head and looked him in the eye. Those big green eyes were dangerous even behind the (not so) ugly glasses.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>“I want to keep Alphard.”</span>
</p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>“Don’t call it that.”</span>
</p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>“I never had a pet as a child, and this one needs a home. So I’m going to keep him and take care of him, you won’t have to do anything.”</span>
</p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>Draco maintained the staring contest as long as he could, but he knew it was useless.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>“OK. Keep it, but if I have to…where is the blasted beast?”</span>
</p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>“Uh, did I tell you that chameleons can camouflage themselves in the environment?”</span>
</p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>“Shut up Potter, and for the love of Merlin, find it! Or I swear that both of you will sleep on the street tonight!”</span>
