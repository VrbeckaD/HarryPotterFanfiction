    <p>Prologue</p><p>"Severus! Severus, wake up! Sev…" She could see his body lying on the ground in front of her but she felt like she could do nothing. She was stuck. Then came in another figure, a boy with a devilishly handsome face, and pointed a wand at the body as if about to cast a spell. Somewhere in the back, someone was shouting obscenities but the boy didn't hear them. He muttered a spell. A light started coming out of his wand and—that's not possible, thought Lily. This has happened before…. She has gone through all of this before…. It has haunted her dreams before… Was this a dream? No—it felt more real like she was there again.</p><p>Lily tried opening her eyes not once, not twice, but five times before giving up. She was stuck in her worst memory, a memory which she had tried so hard to forget. She could do nothing but give up and wonder how things would be if she survived. But a small part of her didn't want to give up. It was trying to tell her something like it knew something the other part of her didn't. And then it clicked.</p><p>The scene around her changed. Now, the body of Severus was no more on the ground. It was replaced by the body of that irritating boy with that irritating smile that she had fallen in love with. He lay there, still, surrounded by dementors. A small, white, shining ball of light started escaping his mouth. "The dementor's kiss," Lily thought aloud. This couldn't possibly be a memory. This had never happened before. It couldn't be a dream, it felt too real.</p><p>Real.</p><p>This was real. James Potter was dying.</p>
