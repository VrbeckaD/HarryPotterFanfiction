    <p>When Lily Potter saw her children for the very first time, her first thought was that it may have actually been worth the almost thirty hour labor. Her second thought was to remind herself what a ridiculous thought the first one was. Even through her pain, however, Lily couldn’t help but smile. “He’s perfect,” she breathed, looking at the child she held, brushing her fingers across his wisps of red hair- red just like hers. </p><p>James moved from his chair to the edge of the bed beside her to see his son. “He really is,” the new father agreed, kissing his son, then his wife. </p><p>Sirius couldn’t help but agree. “They’re beautiful, Lils,” he said honestly, staying a step away so as not to intrude on the family scene.</p><p>Remus, on the other hand, had practically backed out of the room after the midwife. His back was pressed to the doorframe and his hand rested on the knob, ready to bolt at any moment.</p><p>“Moony?” James called. “You’re being pretty quiet. Come say hi to the new additions!”</p><p>Remus smiled tightly. “I wouldn’t want to intrude.”</p><p>James’s eyes could have reached back into his brain if such a thing were possible. “You’re family, too, Remus. Get your arse over here.”</p><p>Still, he hesitated. “I don’t know if it’s best that I’m around children,” he said carefully.</p><p><em> Ah. </em> Lily understood. “If this is about your furry little problem, you can get over it, Remus Lupin,” she fake scolded her friend. “You are not a danger to my children, and you will not treat yourself as such.”</p><p>His smile was real that time, at least. But it wasn’t enough to convince him. “Lily, I really don’t think-”</p><p>But James interrupted him this time, catching on to the real issue. “I trust you around my children one-hundred percent, Moony,” he announced. “In fact,” he added, jumping up from the bed, “I’m going to prove that to you by making you the godfather to my firstborn son."</p><p>The werewolf’s eyes were the size of saucers. “I- I won’t let you down,” he promised. “You or, erm…”</p><p>“Alexander,” Lily supplied suddenly. “Alexander James Potter.”</p><p>James, his face about to split in half from his smile, leaned over and kissed his wife smack on the lips. “I love it,” he said hoarsely. “I love it and him and you.” She grinned. “But generally everyone here has two middle names,” he added. “One stays a bit more private, you see. The second one. Only trusted family and friends would ever know it.”</p><p>Lily tilted her head. “Another name…. What do you think, Remus? It’s your godson after all."</p><p>Remus finally approached the happy family and got his first look at his godson. He could have cast the strongest patronus of his life in that moment. “Felix,” he said, not a hint of uncertainty in his tone. “Means luck and success. Exactly what we’d want for our little boy.” <em> And exactly how I feel. So bloody lucky. </em> </p><p>“If Moony gets Alex, I want the other one,” Sirius declared, his eyes glittering. “What do ya say, Prongs? Can I be this one’s godfather?”</p><p>“Of course,” Lily replied for him. “I’d love nothing more, Siri.”</p><p>Sirius shot her a grateful smile. “Can I hold her, James?” he asked his best friend, holding out his arms.</p><p>“Yeah, yeah, of course, Pads,” James agreed, still enthralled by his wife and son, handing over the carefully swaddled baby girl.</p><p>“Now what to call you?” Sirius cooed, holding her up before him.</p><p>Lily looked over. “I have no clue,” she laughed honestly. “No name is really <em> coming </em> to me, like it did with Alex. What do you think, Padfoot?”</p><p>His jaw dropped, his eyes lighting up. “I can name her?” he asked, awestruck, bouncing slightly on his feet at the idea.</p><p>“<em> If </em> I approve,” Lily warned, pointing an accusing finger at her friend. “You will not name my daughter something ridiculous.”</p><p>“I would never!” he exclaimed, and the women slapped his arm playfully in reply.</p><p>Sirius stared deep into the emerald eyes of the baby girl as he held her. She just stared right back up at him with her big eyes, a harsh contrast to Alex, who had just barely stopped crying as he had fallen asleep in his mother’s arms.</p><p>“How about… Anastasia?” he murmured. “Would that fit you, little one?”</p><p>She just cooed up at him, and he felt as though his heart was about to melt at the adorable sight.</p><p>“Anastasia,” he repeated a little louder, letting his inflection make it a question for Lily.</p><p>“It's pretty, Pads,” James told him, turning around. He frowned. “A bit… pretentious, though, don’t you think?”</p><p>“Not pretentious,” Sirius argued indignantly. “Proper. Elegant.”</p><p>Lily smiled fondly at the men. “Well, I can’t argue with that. Anastasia,” she repeated, testing out the name. “I think it’s perfect. And they both have ‘A’ names. It’s positively adorable.”</p><p>“And middle names, too,” Sirius mused, as James and Lily turned their attention back to Alex. He wasn’t usually a sucker for the Olde Ways, but traditions had meaning. And family, even if he hated his immediate relatives, was important. “Valeria?” he tested. “Anastasia Valeria Potter? No, not quite right. Pandora, maybe?” he tried, thinking through the traditional Black names. “Anastasia Pandora Potter.” He loved the sound of it. “Lils?” he called over.</p><p>She liked the name, and saw his clear desire for her to be named such, but she hesitated. “The women in my family are all named after flowers,” she explained. “Have been for generations. My sister is Petunia, my mother is Rose, my grandmother is Heather, her sister is Daisy. I’d love for that to carry over,” she said hopefully.</p><p>And who was he to deny her.</p><p>“Flowers, flowers, why don’t I know more flowers,” he muttered. It took him several more minutes of muttering to find one he liked. “Artemisia,” he decided. “Anastasia Artemisia Pandora Potter.”</p><p>“That’s quite the mouthful,” James argued, his nose crinkling slightly. </p><p>Sirius shrugged. “Names are important,” he said simply in reply. “You know that.”</p><p>“Fine,” the father replied, rolling his eyes, but his smile gave him away.</p><p>So they had their children. Alexander James Felix Potter and Anastasia Artemisia Pandora Potter. (Though obviously the second middle names wouldn’t be public knowledge.) The new parents couldn’t be happier.</p><p> </p><p>_______</p><p> </p><p>He might not have admitted it to the Potters, but Sirius had something of an ulterior motive.</p><p>It was about a fortnight before he could carry out his plan, but he finally had an opening. Lily and James were bringing Alex to the Longbottoms’ to play with Neville, and Sirius had offered to babysit Anastasia. </p><p>Holding the baby in one arm, he carefully chalked out the circles and lines that he had practiced so many times. Elder Futhark runes were the only ones taught at Hogwarts, and thus were the only ones he had any real experience with. This ritual, however, required Marcomannic runes, and he felt a bit out of his depth. </p><p>The alphabets were almost the same, so he wasn’t too worried about the actual circle, but, regardless, he had drawn the ritual circle hundreds of times, making sure every last line was perfect before he would dare let his little Anastasia anywhere near it. </p><p>“Othala, Jera, Othala,” he muttered under his breath, reciting the runes in the order he was to draw them. The rather bothersome thing about Marcomannic runes was that they had to be drawn in a very specific order, and it varied from ritual to ritual. There were some general rules- for example, like in this ritual, when there were individual circles for each person, the single runes within would be drawn first, left to right if applicable, and in order of the alphabet if not. But other than a few basics, one simply had to be extremely careful.</p><p>He drew on the last rune, Ingwaz, in the center of the circle. Ingwaz, though it symbolized beginnings, was always drawn last. Every time.</p><p>“Now, sweetheart,” he whispered to Anastasia, “I need you to be really good for a little bit, okay? I need you to lie right here”- he placed her in her circle, over the Gebo rune- “and be very still and quiet, alright?”</p><p>She, being an infant, had no idea what he was saying, but she did what he asked regardless, as it was her nature already to be almost eerily still.</p><p>Sirius then took his own place kneeling over the Cen rune, holding her hand in the intersection of their circles over Ingwaz. </p><p>Closing his eyes, he recited the ritual he knew so well.  </p><p>“<em> Mater Supera </em> ,” he began, “ <em> benedictiones precamor de adoptione </em>…”</p><p><em> Soon </em>, he thought to himself as he spoke. Soon, she would be his daughter, his blood, his heiress.</p><p>The ritual ended with a glowing strand of magic snaking around their joined hands, and he could sense that their burning blood merged. </p><p>He had never cared much for runes, and most of the rituals in the books at home were Dark. Well, technically, the adoption ritual was as well, but that wasn’t the point. However, no matter how long he went, he would never stop craving the feeling at the end of a properly performed ritual, when his magic seemed to have found a home within him, rather than fighting for freedom as it usually did. The feeling of perfect release and connection to magic- nothing could compare.</p><p>Sirius sighed and cleared the ritual chalk with a wave of his wand. The Blacks would be proud of him, proud for getting the family back to what it used to be, back where it belonged. Morgana, even his mother would be proud of him for it, and what a disconcerting realization that was. The Potters, however, could never know.</p><p> </p><p>_______</p><p> </p><p>Lily and James considered themselves very lucky as their son got older. </p><p>Alex had grown into hair as untameable as his, but in the exact same shade of red as hers. Bright hazel eyes, tan skin, and freckles gave him a happy-go-lucky air. At only two, he was already strong-willed and stubborn, spending his spare time pranking with his father and riding around on his toy broom. All their friends agreed and spoiled the little boy.</p><p>Anastasia, on the other hand, was… odd. That was the only word they could think of to describe her. She was almost the exact opposite of her brother, but, in their minds at least, she had gotten all the negative qualities. Her skin was pale as milk and she was so thin that you could see right through it. She had black hair like James, but had gotten curls from Merlin-knows-where. She was tiny, which only made her huge eyes stand out more, giving her a waif-like appearance. </p><p>But the worst differences were in her personality. Anastasia was bothersomely reserved. They had only heard her say a few words, <em> ever. </em> She seemed to be everywhere, just watching, observing, learning everything about everything. They weren't particularly worried about what she could learn; they didn't discuss anything important without wards, and they had yet to give their children the talk about magic and how it worked. So, it wasn’t bad per se, but it was rather off-putting.</p><p>She would spend hours looking at books, or at least flipping through the pictures. She would go for walks, which was surprising enough on its own, but she would disappear for hours and hours at a time. They simply had no idea what to do with her.</p><p>Then came the night when everything would change. </p><p>They knew about the prophecy, of course. It could apply to Alex or to Neville Longbottom. Or to Ana, but Dumbledore had expressed his doubts about that option. So, under Dumbledore's orders, they went into lockdown and made Peter their secret keeper. But even that couldn’t truly prepare them.</p><p>“James!” Lily hissed, her heart pounding in her chest as the emergency wards kicked in. “James, it's him!”</p><p>James bolted upright and tried to calm his breathing. “Alright. It's alright. We prepared for this. Take the twins upstairs and hide. I'll try to hold him off until you get a message to Dumbledore.”</p><p>Lily nodded, her eyes wide, and rushed up the creaking stairs two at a time, desperate to hide her babies. She had barely reached the top of the landing when she heard the door slam open and a voice that could only be assumed to be You-Know-Who.</p><p>“Stand aside,” the cold voice intoned.</p><p>“Never!” James announced with all his Gryffindor courage. “You're never going to hurt my family!”</p><p>“<em> Stupefy </em>,” he said absently.</p><p>James threw up a shaky shield just in time, stumbling back and almost falling onto the couch.</p><p>“You’re not going to take me that easily,” he grunted.</p><p>“<em>Prohibite </em>.”</p><p>And James fell to the ground motionless. </p><p>He headed up the stairs silently, twirling his wand between his fingers. When he reached the nursery, Lily was already there, blocking the crib with her own body. </p><p>“Stand aside,” he said again. After all, he did not kill without reason. That was simply a waste of magic.</p><p>“Please,” she begged. “Not my babies. Don't hurt Alex, please.”</p><p><em> How odd, to only mention one child. </em> “Stand aside, you stupid girl,” he tried again.</p><p>“Take me instead!” she tried.</p><p>He sneered. “Do you not realize how pointless that would be? <em> Stupefy</em>,” he said, waving his wand at the woman. </p><p>He then turned his attention to the babies in the crib. At first he only saw the boy, crying loudly and jumping up and down on the mattress. He grimaced. There was no way <em> that </em> was the child who could defeat him.</p><p>He looked around for the other child before realizing that she was in the crib as well. She was sitting in the back corner, making no noise at all. She held what looked like a muggle pen, and was doodling small patterns, black ink against her pale skin. She looked up at him with an odd expression on her face.</p><p>“Hello, sir,” she said politely.</p><p>He raised an eyebrow. So not all Potter's were insufferable.</p><p>“Hello,” he replied, unsure why he did so.</p><p>“Is everything alright?” she asked then. “Lily's on the floor. Are you going to be on the floor?”</p><p><em> Lily? </em> he thought. She was two- shouldn’t it be mummy or mama?</p><p>He raised his arm to point his wand at her, his red eyes narrowing. Yes, he thought, this could very well be the child of the prophecy. She seemed intelligent, sure, but moreover he could feel her magic from where he stood. <em> Still a child, </em> his mind reminded him.</p><p>“I wish I did not have to do this,” he murmured. </p><p>“<em> Avada kedavra.” </em></p><p>And she… didn't die? The curse hit her directly, engulfing her in a light the same shade of green as her eyes. She was pushed backward against the back of the crib by a wind only she could feel. Her eyes went wide, and she let out a little gasp.</p><p>But the the curse seemed to rebound. It almost <em> bounced </em> off of her and came right back at him. </p><p>However, one doesn’t become a dark lord without basic duelling skills. He knew how to dodge a curse. He threw himself to the side and to the ground, letting the curse hit the wall behind him. </p><p><em> But what to do now? </em> he thought. The child had just survived the killing curse. That simply wasn’t done. If he hadn’t gotten out of the way so quickly, it would have rebounded to kill him instead. </p><p><em> Perhaps… </em> he wondered. <em> Perhaps if he could make them think it had killed him…. </em> </p><p>“Sir?” cut in a small voice. “What was that?”</p><p>“I don’t know, child,” he breathed, still in shock.</p><p>“Are you alright?” she asked then. “And I’m not a child! I’m two!”</p><p>His rumbling laugh surprised them both. Then he grew somber. <em> Are you alright? </em> A simple, childish question. He had just tried to kill her for Merlin’s sake! But he couldn’t remember the last time anyone asked him that. Honestly, anyway. He wasn’t quite sure how he felt about that.</p><p>“Then what is your name, little one? You cannot be angry if you have not given me anything else to call you.”</p><p>“I’m Ana,” she told him. “Anastasia.”</p><p>Like the last Russian Grand Duchess. So young, so much potential, but still <em> dead. </em>How fitting.</p><p>“What a lovely name,” he told her. She smiled at him. He smiled back. <em> What was he doing? Dark Lords don’t smile at babies! </em> “I am… Marvolo.”</p><p>“Will I see you again?” she asked.</p><p>“Yes,” he murmured. “Yes, I do believe you will.”</p><p>With that, he left the room and then the house, leaving a small pile of ash on the floor where he would have been had the rebounding curse hit its mark. <em> Let’s see what the great Dumbledore makes of that. </em></p><p>____________</p><p> </p><p>“Yes,” Albus announced, after they’d all settled themselves in James’s study with tea. “I do believe Tom has been defeated. And all due to your child.”</p><p>“Which one?” Lily asked tentatively.</p><p>“Well-” Albus began.</p><p>James cut in. “Well, it’s gotta be our little Alex, right? It takes a Gryffindor to beat a slimy Slytherin, and Alex is a perfect Gryffindor if I’ve ever seen one.”</p><p>Lily nodded grudgingly. “He does seem a better fit for the prophecy child,” she admitted. “He’s very sweet and stubborn, just like his father.”</p><p>“I would agree with you on that analysis,” Albus told them. “It is also likely that Tom would choose the half-blood boy like himself. He always did have a flair for symbolism,” he said almost fondly.</p><p>“So what happened exactly, Albus?” James asked. “How did he die?”</p><p>Albus adjusted his half-moon glasses. “All evidence shows that the killing curse was indeed performed.”</p><p>Lily gasped. Alex could have truly died that night! </p><p>“However, it appears that, while he did send the curse at Alex, it rebounded. This could have been because he is the prophecy child, and therefore very powerful, or because or your willingness to sacrifice yourselves for him. But either way, Alex is the only person to survive the killing curse, and is now Voldemort’s defeater.”</p><p>James puffed up. “That’s my boy!” he crowed. “Surviving the killing curse itself! And killing You-Know-Who in the process! He’s a hero to this world.”</p><p>“He is indeed,” Albus said seriously. “And you will have to understand what that will mean for him. He will be famous in our world.”</p><p>“Just as he deserves!”</p><p>“But what about the Death Eaters?” Lily asked, worried. “Will they target him?”</p><p>“I doubt they will appreciate losing their leader. But he will be fine in Potter Manor, and his safety will be of the utmost priority. And without Tom, I believe it will be far easier to catch those who remain loyal to his cause.”</p><p>“Alright,” Lily said, appeased.</p><p>Albus took a deep breath, steadying himself on the large oak desk. “I do not believe Tom is truly gone.”</p><p>
  <em> “What?” </em>
</p><p>He nodded gravely. “He has taken measures to ensure his immortality,” he explained. “He is gone for now; Alex has certainly saved our world. We would not have survived much more war without time to prepare. However, Alex will need to be trained as the prophecy child.”</p><p>“Well…” James glanced at Lily. “That should be fine. It’s nothing our son can’t handle, I’m sure.”</p><p>“Now as for for Anastasia. What will you do with her?” Albus asked, folding his hands in front of himself.</p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p>“It may be better to… send her away,” Albus said carefully.</p><p>“To <em> what?” </em> Lily shrieked.</p><p>“Not forever,” he assured her. “Nothing like that. But you know Alex will need training, and he will get a lot of press. It may prove difficult to raise them in a way that would not leave her a bit… bitter.”</p><p>“We are not sending our child away just because the other is more famous,” Lily insisted.</p><p>“And she’d be far more bitter than we could ever make her if she grew up away from us and found out it was because we loved her famous brother more,” James added. “She’s smart; her rebellious phase wouldn’t be good for anyone.”</p><p>“Alright,” Albus gave in, resigned. “Be prepared for a lot of press for Alex, however. The wizarding world needs a hero right now. He will have to be prepared to take that place.”</p><p>“He will be,” they promised. “We’ll make sure of it.”</p>
