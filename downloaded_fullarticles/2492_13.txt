    <p>“Hello, my name is Hannah Abbott and I’m an alcoholic,” the five foot four woman with honey-colored hair spoke. Pansy rolled her eyes as everyone half-heartedly chanted a greeting. This whole exercise of showing up to this meeting was Draco’s idea, of course. And, because it was Draco’s idea, Draco was sitting beside her in the school gym with the red, plastic chairs. And, because it was Draco’s idea and he was sitting beside her in the school gym with the red, plastic chairs, Pansy couldn’t actually talk about her real-life feelings. Not that she would have if she weren’t with him, just that now it was even worse. </p><p>“It’s just so hard, you know, because I own a bar and so the alcohol is always right there. And then some old, drunk guy yells at me and I just need a little bit of tequila so I don’t start crying and then the next thing I know I’ve had a whole bottle and I’m letting people do free body shots off of me in my own bar,” Hannah continued. Hannah fucking Abbott gets drunk and lets people do body shots off of her? Pansy snorted. On her left, Draco glared. He had to know that she wasn’t going to take this seriously. She liked that he was annoyed with her… she was annoyed with him, so it was really only fair. </p><p>“Great job, Hannah. We can all imagine that struggle,” their chapter leader, a plump older woman named Pomona said. “Okay, who’s next? Pansy? What about you,” she prompted. This was the moment Pansy had been dreading. Being forced to talk in front of all these losers. Pansy sunk lower in her chair. It was dreadfully uncomfortable, but so was the room. After a minute of everyone staring at her and Pomona gesturing for her to go, Pansy took a deep breath and decided to just wing it.</p><p>“My name is Pansy and I am not an alcoholic,” she gruffly stated. Everyone in the room groaned. Pansy shrugged her shoulders as she looked at all of the disappointed faces before settling on Draco’s. Disappointed wasn’t the right word. His crestfallen face and pitying eyes made her angry.</p><p>“It’s just,” she trailed off before finding the words and starting over, “I like going to the bar, okay?” She received blank stares and a few knowing ones. They didn’t know her. They didn’t understand her.</p><p>“Every time I drink, it’s because I want to,” Pansy said, almost emphatically. She was well aware that she came here on her own volition, but she also felt a weird urge for them to tell her to leave. That she didn’t belong in Alcoholic’s Anonymous. That she was a polar bear among grizzlies. She realized then that they believed her to be in denial. </p><p>“That’s all well and good, Pansy, but if that’s the case then why are you here?” Pomona asked the million dollar question. Of course she did. Pansy’s shoulders sank as exasperation sunk in. </p><p>“To be perfectly frank, it’s because he made me,” she flung her arm to point in Draco’s ferrety direction. He openly gaped at her.</p><p>“Me? You think you’re here because of me? No, Pansy, you’re here because you showed up at my fucking house at six in the morning on a Tuesday,” he shouted, “Who gets shitface drunk on a Monday?” Now they were both standing, facing each other, red in the face. They had always fought as toddlers, as children, as teenagers, and now as adults. Nothing was new here. </p><p>“If you want me to stop coming to your house that’s fine I just won’t come anymore. I don’t care. It’s just that I stupidly thought that you were my best friend.”<br/>
“Don’t play that card with me. If you were my best friend you would stop trying to give yourself liver failure five days a week.”<br/>
“You’re just jealous, Draco. You’re jealous because we used to hang out and get drunk and have fun. Now you’ve decided to settle down into some stupid house that’s close to a Volvo dealership or whatever it is that boring people care about.”<br/>
“Pansy, that doesn’t even make any sense.”<br/>
“Oh, I’m not making sense? Look in the mirror Mr. I’m In Love and I Want to Get Married and Have Two Point Five Kids.”<br/>
They mirrored each other. Both scowling with their hands on their hips.<br/>
“Um, okay. I think we’ve had a very productive meeting today and I look forward to seeing everyone next week,” Pomona said quietly.</p><p>Pansy huffed and grabbed her jacket and purse from underneath the chair. Giving Draco one more angry glance, she fled the gymnasium. She couldn’t believe that she had taken the morning off of work for this. If that wasn’t bad enough, Draco has driven her which meant that she was without a ride. She also couldn’t stand there because then Draco would come out and try to talk to her.</p><p>It was all really quite unfair because Draco used to be just like her. He used to avoid his feelings, drink himself stupid, and never try to make her talk about what was bothering her. Where was that Draco now? Probably in the garbage alongside that dragon statue that used to be a centerpiece in his flat. All of her friends were settling down. Getting engaged and then married. Having babies and buying houses. Leaving her behind. </p><p>This thought was punctuated by her black ankle boots sinking into the mud. Pansy groaned and decided to give in to her love of not walking four miles in her work clothes. She dialed for a car to pick her up and brought the phone to her ear. As they asked her for an address, she decided to go home. Getting straight to the office would probably be ideal now, but then she wouldn’t have her car at the end of the day and would need to call again to be driven back to her house. And if she had to call to get back to her house, she might as well just ask to be taken to the bar. And if she asked to be taken to the bar, then she would be proving Draco right… Obviously, it would be her choice to be taken to the bar, but Draco is too daft to understand the complexities of the human conscious. </p><p>At this point, she was at a great enough distance from the building that Draco wouldn’t be able to see her as she waited. So stood in place and tapped her foot. A red car pulled up in front of her and she swung the door open and got inside. </p><p>“Hi, ma’am,” the driver said, “how has your day been?” Pansy just hummed. After a few seconds, he would understand that she wasn’t here for small talk or companionship. She just needed a ride home. As long as he didn’t annoy her too much, or try to kill her, she would give him a handsome tip and be on her way. </p><p>Seven minutes later, they pulled up at Pansy’s destination. She handed him a wad of bills and wordlessly got out of the car. Coming up to her door, she shoved it with her shoulder while twisting the brass key. Everything looked the same as she left it so she dropped her things on the linen sofa and proceeded to her bedroom to change shoes. </p><p>Despite living here for nearing on two years, Pansy had done a lackluster job of furnishing the flat. It wasn’t empty by any means. She was safe in the sweet spot between it a home and a hovel. Furniture, but no decorations. Unless you counted the ficus in the corner and the tiny cactus on her windowsill. Pansy had always wanted to get more but didn’t want to fool herself into believing that she was a functioning human being capable of mothering plants. </p><p>Stepping into her bedroom she froze upon seeing her messy sheets still surrounding a person. First, she checked for breathing. For two very practical reasons: 1.) him being dead would be a very practical excuse for why he had the audacity to still be here rather than literally anywhere else and 2.) if he wasn’t already dead, he would be soon. </p><p>Reaching out her arm, she took two fingers and shoved them in between his ribs. Abruptly he pushed himself up and squirmed away from her.</p><p>“What the fuck was that for?”</p><p>A moronic question from her moronic companion. How he survived this long in life without being murdered was beyond her. </p><p>“Why are you still here?”<br/>
“Because I was sleeping you maniac. Are you physically incapable of taking a chill pill?”<br/>
“A what?”<br/>
“Oh my God, why can’t you just be normal for one day, Pansy?”<br/>
“Why can’t you get out of my flat?”<br/>
“You know what? Fine. I’ll leave.”<br/>
As he got up, he pulled the sheet off of her bed.<br/>
“That isn’t yours,” she yelled after him. “Take your ugly clothes and leave my Egyptian cotton!” Pansy decided that men would never, ever learn. They were damned to be stupid and a pain. It was too bad that this one was so good in bed. </p><p>Intoxicating, really. Practically addicting. That would probably explain why she got drunk and fucked him approximately five nights a week.</p>
