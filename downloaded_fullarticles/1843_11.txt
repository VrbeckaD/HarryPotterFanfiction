"You're probably right, let's do this together."</p><p>They walked into the classroom and sat down in their usual seats.</p><p>The rest of the class arrived, but Professor Silverton was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>Hugo smirked. "Maybe he got lost."</p><p>Lily giggled. "I hope so."</p><p>To everyone's surprise, none other than Lily's dad Harry Potter entered the room with Draco Malfoy.</p><p>Hugo gasped.
