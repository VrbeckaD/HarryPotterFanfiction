          <div class="userstuff"><p>“Did you miss me?” Percy asked.</p>
<p>“I mean, yeah, but…” Ginny stopped.</p>
<p>Percy grabbed her waist and kissed her on the lips. He tightened his grip as she tried to struggle.</p>
<p>“You’re not getting away from me again,” Percy said, “You used to give yourself to me, remember?”</p>
<p>“I’m with Harry,” she said.</p>
<p>“He doesn’t have to know,” Percy placed his hand on her back, “You’re not wearing a bra.”</p>
<p>He cupped her breasts, feeling her sensitive nipples.</p>
<p>“Percy, don’t…”</p>
<p>“Don’t tell me you don’t miss what we had.”</p>
<p>“We had nothing!” she said, “For Merlin sake, it was TWO times!”</p>
<p>“Three,” he corrected.</p>
<p>“You left us. I owe you nothing.”</p>
<p>He lowered her onto her bed.</p>
<p>“Let me make it up to you,” he pushed her head back against the pillow.</p>
<p>“Get OFF!”</p>
<p>“See, you say that,” Percy caressed her hip, “But I don’t think you mean it.”</p>
<p>His hand moved down to her pajama bottoms.</p>
<p>“Don’t.”</p>
<p>“You’re not fighting me,” he commented.</p>
<p>She began to shove him away as if the thought had just occurred to her, but he grabbed her arms and magically bound them carefully above her head.</p>
<p>“Bastard!” she spat.</p>
<p>“I’m not going to hurt you, Ginny,” Percy removed her pajama bottoms, “I would never hurt you.”</p>
<p>“Stop,” she demanded.</p>
<p>“You don’t mean that,” he grabbed the elastic of her panties, “Turquoise. That’s my favorite color. But you knew that.”</p>
<p>“They’re not for YOU!”</p>
<p>“Doubt it,” he removed her pajama shirt, slowly lifting it above her head, “Does Harry know you’re not a virgin?”</p>
<p>“He’s never asked!”</p>
<p>“Right,” he carefully touched her breasts, then ran his hands over her stomach, “You’re perfect.”</p>
<p>“Get off of me,” she repeated, more pleadingly.</p>
<p>“Have I EVER hurt you, Gin?” he pulled down the edges of her panties, revealing her bush, “Have I ever caused you pain?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Then, don’t be afraid,” he removed her panties entirely and threw them aside.</p>
<p>“I’ve missed you, too.”</p>
<p>Percy’s fingers found her clit, and she began to moan softly. His other hand reached his zipper, and Ginny looked worried.</p>
<p>“Not yet,” he put one of his fingers inside her, “You’re too tight. It’ll hurt.”</p>
<p>“Perce,” she moaned a bit louder, “Please…”</p>
<p>She was wet, and so warm. He wouldn’t last much longer and still had his trousers on.</p>
<p>“Ready, Gin?” he removed his trousers, his erect cock now on display.</p>
<p>“Yes,” she moaned.</p>
<p>He carefully parted her legs so he could enter more easily, then parted the fleshy lips to avoid extra friction.</p>
<p>“Gin, I love you,” he finally entered her, savoring her moans as he slowly pushed deeper, and watching her breasts bounce slightly with each thrust.</p>
<p>“Let me…touch,” she pleaded.</p>
<p>He unbound her hands, which she quickly wrapped around him, nails digging into his back.</p>
<p>“Touch me, Gin,” he quickened his thrusting motions as she clenched around his cock.</p>
<p>Her hands explored his body, squeezing and touching, grabbing in all the right places.</p>
<p>“Don’t stop,” she gasped, so close, so damn close and he knew it.</p>
<p>“Tell me you love me.”</p>
<p>“I love you, Perce.”</p>
<p>“You’re mine, Gin,” he said as he began to climax.</p>
<p>“I know,” she agreed as he finished, her head rested against the pillow.</p>
<p>“I’m going to pull out now, Gin,” he warned, “It might hurt.”</p>
<p>She nodded. Percy carefully pulled out, then lied next to her.</p>
<p>“I really do love you,” he said.</p>
<p>“Harry will be back soon,” she informed him.</p>
<p>“See you, Gin,” he got up and got dressed.</p></div>
