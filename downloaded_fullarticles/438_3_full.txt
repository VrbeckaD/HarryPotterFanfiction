    <p>Her eyes fluttered open, revealing the dark wood canopy above the bed she was laying in. It reminded her so heavily of the room in the Leaky Cauldron she had stayed in as a child in her third year. She sat up, seeing the familiar yellow blanket fall into her lap. Hariel glanced around the room, taking note of the bedside table and the chair that rested under the large bay windows, which let the morning sunshine flood the room. Across the room was a dresser and a love couch, completing all of the furniture in the room besides the fireplace that was across from the bed she lay in.</p><p>Hariel furrowed her brows, feeling confused. <em>‘Death, where am I? Am… Am I in the Leaky Cauldron?’</em></p><p>Death appeared in the middle of the room, the dark cloak flowing over his form, while his face this time resembled that of a middle aged man with sandy-brown hair and freckles across his cheeks. He grinned, which looked oddly charming yet disturbing at the same time. His face seemed to fit not quite right, stretching just a little too much on the skin. It was obvious that there was something <em>inhuman</em> about him, especially because the skin didn't seem to fit the body he was wearing. Harry shuddered at the view before deciding to just ignore it, probably better for her sanity.</p><p><em>‘Yes, this time, you are in the Leaky Cauldron, room 11, in 1944.’</em> The Entity smiled sharply at her alarmed look, <em>‘I hope this time, you have a better reaction to Tom Riddle.’</em></p><p><em>‘Why would you put me here?’</em> She asked angrily, hands clenched in her lap.</p><p><em>‘In this timeline, Harry Potter, would not live past the age of four. The Dursley’s would starve him to death.’</em> His face deepened, showing a anger that went farther and deeper than just rage. <em>‘Nasty, nasty creatures, harming my childe. To fix this, I have a job for you, here, in this timeline. I want you to set Riddle straight, to give him the path he should have taken, without Dumbledore’s interference.’</em></p><p><em>‘How exactly am I supposed to do that?’</em> the witch asked, face full of skepticism.</p><p><em>‘I shall give you one hint, my darling Master, talk to Ragnok in Gringotts. Show him my mark on your palm, he will take care of everything.’</em> With that said, with a simple twist, he simply disappeared as quietly as he had come, leaving the witch alone in the room.</p><p>She blinked at his sudden disappearance before sighing in annoyance. He always seemed to leave her with more questions than answers. Harry rolled out of the bed, pushing the blanket off of her and placed her naked feet on the wooden floor, a slight shiver going up her spine at the cold that seemed to immediately soak into her skin. Another sigh left her lips before she reached for her Holly wand, which rested right next to the Elder wand on the bedside table before transfiguring the set of pajamas she wore into the customary ladies robes.</p><p>Harry stretched as she stood up, her arms raised above her head as she rolled her head around, sighing in satisfaction at the loud pop that echoed in the quiet room. Summoning a mirror, she gazed at her reflection. Despite the fact that she had been twenty-eight when Death had swept her away. She didn't know exactly how long she had been traveling for, several years at least. And once again, she didn't look above the age of twenty two, if she was lucky. The witch quickly gathered her few things, sliding the Elder wand into her robe pocket before gazing around the room. Her lips pursed in thought before she decided that she didn't need anything else in the room. She kept her Holly wand clutched in her left hand as she exited the room before making her way downstairs to the lobby. She waved a hand at Tom, who stood behind the bar, cleaning glasses. Her eyes narrowed in thought, making her pause in step. He looked the exact same age he had when she was a child, even Dumbledore had aged from the memories she had seen and yet, he seemed ageless. She blinked at the thought, resolving to talk to Death about other possible immortals later. Tom smiled at her as she walked to the doorway where the entrance to Diagon Alley laid.</p><p>She waved her wand over the stones, watching as they slowly disappeared, revealing the shopping area to her. She smiled at the sight, surprised by how much she had missed it in her travels. It only took her several minutes to make it to the entrance doors to the Goblin bank, considering how early it was, hardly anyone was on the street, only those heading to their shops to open. It meant that crowds didn't hinder her progress of walking through the shopping district.</p><p>She nodded briefly at the Goblin guards stationed at the door before heading inside, noting only one wizard talking to a teller. Harry walked into the large atrium, walking up to a Goblin who sat at his desk counting some knuts. “I request an audience with Ragnok.” She spoke distinctly, staring him straight in the face, remembering Griphook’s lessons of Goblin etiquette, back in her seventh year at Shell Cottage. </p><p>The Goblin stared at her in surprise, before giving a smile full of teeth, “Very well.” He snapped his fingers, “Gornuk will escort you.”</p><p> A door opened behind the goblin teller, revealing another with longer arms that seemed to almost drag on the ground as he walked over to them. His face had more wrinkles than the teller and his uniform showed that he was a simple assistant rather than someone higher up. He raised one long fingered hand to beckon her to follow him once he was halfway from the doorway to where she stood waiting.</p><p>Raising an eyebrow in bemusement, Harry did as ask, following the Goblin through the doorway, which shut quickly before the doorway melted away, effectively locking her inside. She supposed it was a good defense against any invaders, being unable to exit once inside. The Goblin lead her down the hallway, passing many ornate open doorways, where all held large desks covered in scrolls with a Goblin reading through them. She supposed they were all the accountants to the many numerous vaults located in the bank. It took only a few minutes longer, and the floor slightly tilting downward enough that she almost didn't realize that they'd probably traveled farther than she suspected.</p><p>The long-limbed Goblin stopped in front of the only door of the entire hallway, a large, dark wood that seemed more intimidating than what she had expected. Gornuk raised a hand, sliding a finger along the middle of the door, which had no door handle, reminding her of what Griphook had done, all those years ago. Within seconds, the door melted away and the Goblin stood back to allow the witch to enter. Harry made sure to give him one sure nod of thanks before stepping into the office. The door melted behind her, effectively locking her in, once more.</p><p>It was significantly different than the offices they had passed, with two chairs for guests opposite of the Goblin that sat at the desk. In the room, it also contained a bookshelf with room just for scrolls to rest without worrying about any being damaged. On the wall behind the goblin sat a large battleaxe, mounted with a small plaque with Gobbledygook written on it. The goblins desk also held less paperwork than his counterparts, his seemed more organized as well. Harry raised her right hand, curled into a fist, to her left shoulder in greeting before she took a seat across from the goblin. The creature stared at her for a long moment, as if deciding whether the meeting should happen or if he should just send her away.</p><p>“Lord Ragnok, I was told that you may be the answer to my… predicament here.” Harry started off the conversation, having the feeling that if she didn't, she'd be sitting in that chair for hours waiting for him to talk.</p><p>“Oh? Do tell me why I should entertain the thought of giving you my undivided attention.” The haughty look and attitude had her narrowing her eyes in annoyance. “I have much more important matters to attend to, little witch, than sitting here with you wasting my time.”</p><p>Harry raised her left palm, the one with the Deathly Hallows symbol magically tattooed on it, watching in mute satisfaction as the goblin leaned back in surprise, his hands clasping together in front of him as he stared at the surprising witch in front of him. “Is <em>His</em> mark a good enough reason for this meeting?”</p><p>Ragnok smiled toothily at her, as if his earlier distemper had never happened “Why certainly, Lady. What is it that Gringotts can do to better serve the Master of Death?”</p><p>Harry gazed at him for a moment, “Death has sent me here on a mission to guide a wayward young wizard who will change the fate of the Wizarding World. I will need your aid in accomplishing this task.” She paused, “I know that there are several vaults of which I am the direct descendant of, that I wish to claim.”</p><p>The Master Goblin waved his hand, and from the empty wall another goblin, much younger than the assistant from before (and if Harry didn't know any better, she'd almost assume it was a teenager), entered the office with a rolled up scroll and a goblet. After placing it on the desk, the goblin bowed once to the other before departing the same way it had come.</p><p>“A bit of blood into the goblet and Magic herself shall tell you of what is yours.” Ragnok spoke, leaning back into his chair with a grin that promised that he viewed the entire interaction between them with amusement.</p><p>Harry raised the Elder wand from her pocket, watching as the goblin finally had a reaction other than amusement on her behalf. He flinched and yet couldn't take his eyes off of the wand as she raised it to her right palm, silently cutting into the skin enough that blood dripped into the goblet. With a quietly muttered, Episkey, she healed the cut and watched as runes began to glow on the goblet before the scroll unrolled in front of her, revealing a list.</p>

</blockquote><p>Harry looked over the scroll, feeling conflicted about the knowledge of just what was rightfully hers and what had been stolen from her by the denial of her heritage. “Ragnok, as far as I know, the Black and Potter families have still a large family. What exactly can I claim?”</p><p>He smiled darkly, fingers perched together, “You have the chance of reviving the House of Peverell, one of the oldest and most important families in Wizarding England history.”</p><p>“What do I have to do to claim it?”</p><p>“If you have the strongest claim to it, the Lord ring will resize to fit you perfectly, if magic denies your claim, it will appear back in the ring box.” he snapped his fingers and the same attendant from earlier appeared, carrying a little wooden box with runes engraved on it. Once Ragnok held it in his hands, he leaned forward, presenting the box to her. “All you have to do is put it on.”</p><p>Harry glanced at him warily before lifting the lid, revealing three rings resting in the box. The first had her eyes widening, it was the Resurrection Ring with the Peverell family coat of arms imprinted in the stone. The second, which she presumed was the Heir ring was similar but smaller and the third was a Betrothal ring, intent for the partner of the Head of House. The Master of Death reached out, claiming the Lord ring and sliding it onto her finger, feeling it adjust immediately on to it. </p><p>“Well, Lady Peverell, we have some paperwork to go over.” The goblin grinned, making Harry feel like she had fallen into a trap. When the Head Goblin of Gringotts snapped his fingers for the third time since their meeting, a stack of scrolls appeared on his desk. Harry groaned, knowing there was so much to read through.</p><p>It took her four hours and fifty two minutes to sign, date, initial, read and argue over the impossibly large amount of parchment. There was summaries of the vaults, investment gains and losses, familial debts that needed to be paid and collected, insurance, a drafting of a wall in place, collecting and crafting vault keys, and so much more.</p><p>By mid afternoon, she had a bank key that for any large purchases, she simply had to place the key on the sales parchment to authorise the purchase. Much easier than counting out each galleon, sickle and knut.</p><p>She had also spent a hefty fine on a bloodline changing ritual so that her new magical family tree would read that she was now the descendent of Antioch Peverell, rather than Ignotus Peverell which meant that over The Gaunts and Potter’s, she held the highest claim on the family name. Harry had had to pay Ragnok for his services as goblin magic made it easier to complete than taking the time to research and complete the blood ritual. Her new inheritance now read:</p>

</blockquote><p>Harry glanced it over before nodding in approval. While it felt weird not having the truth printed, it did make her job easier with the task that Death had given her. The Witch left the bank shortly after, intent on doing some shopping.</p><p>Diagon Alley was similar but different from what she remembered. There were different stores in place, she counted three robes stores, two apothecaries, four bookstores, a pet store, letter office, a building which looked like it contained several small businesses, the broom store, and quite a bit more than she ever remembered being there. Perhaps with the first War with Voldemort, a lot of places were closed down or the owners murdered or jailed. She took several minutes to wander around the alley before coming upon a small business that read, <em>O’Shay Property Management</em> in gold lettering on a plaque above the store. Raising an eyebrow in curiosity, Harry wandered into the store. It was simple and small, with two small desks on each side of the business where two young, probably just out of Hogwarts, men sat writing. In the middle of the room was a larger desk where an older wizard sat, on the other side of the desk were two seats she presumed for customers. A bell dinged as she walked in, alerting the wizard to her entrance. He stood up, revealing an older but still attractive face with a greying but still dark goatee, sharp features. A smile graced his lips at her before giving a short bow, “Greetings, I'm Henry O’Shay, proprietor, how many I assist you today?”</p><p>“Hello, I wish to look at what listings you have available.” Harry replied, sitting in one of the guest chairs at the man's insistence. </p><p>“Domestic or International?” he asked, pulling a series of parchment scrolls out and placing them on the desk.</p><p>“How about both, we will see what gathers my attention.”</p><p>He smiled as he nodded, feeling like a big commission was coming his way. “We have twenty six magical and thirteen muggle properties available within England, and over forty available in different countries.” He handed over a scroll, similar in the appearance to a binder which had a section  magical photograph of each property. Harry took her time looking over each one, passing over the apartments and looking at homes with a large enough property and space. She finally narrowed the domestic properties available to three: a decent sized home in Godric’s Hallow, a little cottage by the sea and a medium-sized home located a bit away from any town, muggle or magical. Living in Godric’s Hallow just felt wrong after knowing her parents died - would die there. The cottage was pleasant sized but if she planned on gaining attention in society, it would be better having guests over at a larger home instead of a small cottage and the manor would typically only be for large parties hosted by herself. “For domestic, I find I'm partial to the Sheffield House. Allow me a moment to go over the international homes.”</p><p>It took her over forty minutes to decide on two vacation properties, a chateau winery in southern France and an art studio located in the center of the shopping area in Italy. After that, it was merely a matter of signing documents and pressing her key to the paper. Mr. O’Shay beamed the entire time as each property was worth well over a hundred thousand galleons and his commission was going to be tremendous.</p><p>Harry walked away from the business, feeling proud at her first purchase. Despite how long every thing had taken, she learned the hard way to always have multiple hideouts available in the event that something ever happened and she needed to flee the country, it would be good having different options.</p><p>The Witch wandered the alley for a while, window shopping before coming upon a curious store. On the window, a painted House Elf bowed to every person who walked by, even if no one acknowledged it. Her head tilted to the side as she realized that this store sold House Elves. She frowned, remembering all of Hermione’s years of work getting them better living conditions and ensuring that any abuse resulted in the immediately loss and punitive pay for any damages. Here, in 1944, there was nothing that ensured their protection. Harry frowned as she decided to enter the store to see what the inside looked like.</p><p>The inside was cramped. Various cages all crammed together surrounded the inside with House Elves in each one. Harry closed her eyes, feeling rage course through her at their obvious mistreatment. She blew the air through her nose, and counted backwards from ten in an attempt to calm herself before she cursed the wizard behind the counter. When she finally felt calm enough to talk without yelling, she marched over to the wizard, who was flipping casually through a tabloid. The Witch cleared her throat loudly, watching as the wizard looked up tiredly and apathetic to his surroundings, “Yeah?”</p><p>She bristled at his lack of concern, “How much for adults and children?” When he didn't answer, just staring at her slightly confused she snapped her fingers in his face, watching as whatever had been cloudy faded away. “What. Is. The. Cost. For. Adults. And. Children.” Each word was spoken sharply to let him know exactly how displeased she was with him.</p><p>“Um, it's 75 galleons for each adult and 45 galleons and three sickles for a kid.” He answered hesitantly, watching with wide eyes as she turned around sharply. Harry counted out the math to take every single one home. 1,005 galleons and 12 sickles for all 11 adults and four kids. Converted to muggle pounds, it would come out to £3030.64. She could afford that, as long as she didn't splurge anymore until she had the investments paying off.</p><p>“I will take all of them.” Harry stated as she turned back around, watching as the wizard’s eyes bugged out, looking shocked.</p><p>“Let… let me go get the manager.” The young wizard stayed before scurrying through a doorway behind him. Harry crossed her arms over her chest, tapping one foot impatiently as she waited for the manager to emerge. She wanted nothing more than to wring their necks and stick them in a cage. The next wizard that stepped out from further inside the shop was something of a surprise and yet, not. The wizard looked like an older version of one of her classmates, a Zechariah Smith. She wasn't that surprised to find that his grandfather sold House Elves considering how slimy he was.</p><p>“Hello miss, my assistant said you wished to buy all of the elves?” He smiled patronizingly as if she couldn't possible afford it.</p><p>“It's actually Lady Peverell, and yes, I wish to buy every one available.” She took great pleasure as the smile dropped from his face and his skin turned an ashen color as he realized that he had just insulted one of the few “Purebred” ladies that while the family had not been prominent in society for the last hundred years, they were still above most other families. They were on par with the Sacred Twenty-Eight considering that the Peverell’s had direct lineage to both Gryffindor and Slytherin. </p><p>“Of, of course. Let me get some parchment.” He quickly disappeared back behind the doorway, returning only moments later. The wizard placed the parchment down on the counter, tapping his wand on it as a receipt appeared, each house elf was listed following by the price. At the bottom, the subtotal was added together: 1,005 galleons and 12 sickles.</p><p>Harry pulled her key out of her pocket, pressing it against the parchment and watching as an imprint stayed when she moved away the Gringotts key away. The imprint glowed gold for a second before flashing green and fading to a normal imprint, signaling that the order had been accepted. “Here are the paperwork to turn into the Ministry department of Creature Regulations. Have this turned in before the end of the week.”</p><p>The witch raised an eyebrow as a small smirk settled on her face before she took the stack of paperwork from his outreached hand. She turned to the House Elves who all stood watching her. “Take yourselves to Sheffield House. I shall meet you there to take your vows.” The Elves quickly left, snapping their fingers and disappearing. Turning back to face the wizard, the witch gazed at the man before leaving his store without saying a word.</p><p>The door closed behind her, and she closed her eyes, taking a moment to stop herself from going back in and just cursing him stupid. Harry stalked through Diagon Alley as she made her way to the apparition point and floo network were located not far from the Leaky Cauldron. Picking up a bit of Floo powder from a small jar sitting on top of the fireplace, she threw the powder down before calling out, “Sheffield House.” Harry stepped through the Floo, appearing inside of a foyer that was a large empty room with only a large area rug and paintings on the walls for decorations. Harry walked out of the room, gazing at the large entrance way. From the foyer, the large front entrance was elaborate with double redwood doors. Across from the doors laid an interesting wide spiral staircase that split in the middle to form two separate staircases that lead to the second story.</p><p>Across from the foyer laid an open doorway which looked like a formal sitting room. Harry wandered through the room, taking note of the matching settees and the coffee table between them. Apart from that, there was more paintings, typical decoration stuff and another doorway though smaller in size. It lead to a less formal sitting room with comfy looking seating. She wandered out of the room and down the hall, she passed by several different rooms, a study, a formal and informal dining room. At the back of the house was a large kitchen, one with state of the art equipment that had her eyes lighting up.</p><p>She made her way back the way she'd come, only to find all of the House Elves she had bought - though she preferred the term rescued - stood, huddled together and waiting. Harry smiled, hoping to put them at ease, “Hello there.” The Elves all gazed at her with wide eyes. “I am Lady Hariel Peverell. All of you have been picked to be the personal Elves of the Peverell Family. Though at the moment, it is only I. I shall give you two options, right here, right now. The first, you may choose to be a free Elf, with your family with no consequences.” She paused as their pleading grew overwhelming before she raised a hand and they all silenced. “The second is that you and your descendants become the Elves of the Peverell Family.” Here whispers broke out among them. “In a few months time, I hope to have another family member join the Peverell Family. If you wish to be a House Elf for us, you must follow several different rules. The first, your demeanor and appearance reflect my family. As such, everyone will wear a uniform with the Peverell House crest on the front of it. The second, I require that the children do not work. They may, however, learn different crafts. I wish for them to also study so that they may better provide aid for if I am in need of it. Thirdly, if you feel you must punish yourself, you are NOT to do it with physical harm. I would very much prefer you to do a chore that is unpleasant rather than harming yourself.”</p><p>The Elves looked at each other in mild shock, taking in the seriousness of her expression. “It is most important to me that you are healthy and happy. To receive such a result, I am implementing a few more rules. One of you will be designated a healer, to both myself and to you as well. I wish for you all to be healthy for that would please me most. Another one, each of you shall be paid a galleon every two weeks and you will all receive two consecutive days off.” she waited for their shock to die down before continuing, “When it comes to duties, I know everyone is typically well-versed in almost everything however, is there certain jobs you enjoy that you'd prefer having?”</p><p>A male house elf, older than the rest, stepped forward with a bow, “Mistress, I is Tully. I has daughter Tilly, her bondmate Guffy and baby Tuffy.” He waved a hand, making the family step forward a little and wave. “I is good at being Head Elf. Tilly is fixer on robes. Guffy is very good with animals.”</p><p>Harry smiled brightly, “It’s wonderful to meet you Tully, Tilly, Guffy and Tuffy. That would be simply wonderful if you wouldn't mind taking those jobs. Tully, that would mean that you would be in charge of making sure that any needs that an Elf has are taken care of and if any shopping needs to be done, you would take care of it.” Tully nodded before bowing in agreement. “Tilly, I would like, after we make the vows, for you to make the uniforms for everyone. At first, one outfit for everyone and afterward, just make sure that everyone has informal and formal tunics and clothing.”</p><p>“Hokey and Pokey is good at cleanings!” A twin pair of Elves stepped forward, both held hands and looked exactly like a carbon copy of the other. </p><p>“Well, I would certainly appreciate both of your hard work in cleaning this home and the other estates.” Harry replied.</p><p>Another house elf holding the hand of an elfling, stepped forward. “I is Homby and this is Harky. I is good at cooking, Mistress.”</p><p>“Me too! Me too!” Another house elf lept forward, looking far more excited than any of the others, “I is Hinpey.”</p><p>“Well, that sounds like a wonderful idea Homby and Hinpey, I would love to have you be the cooks for me.” Harry smiled in delight, “Would anyone care to be the personal Elves? I'll need two, one for myself and one for the new family member I hope to add.”</p><p>A House Elf with floppy ears walked forward, pulling another one with large green eyes, “I is Sipsy, Mistress and Dimsy here too. May we be your elves pleases?”</p><p>Harry couldn't help the coo she had, “Of course! Of course! Dimsy if you wouldn't mind being the personal elf to my future family, I'd greatly appreciate it. Sipsy, I will happily accept you as my personal elf.”</p><p>“I is good at flowers and outdoorsy, I is.” A House Elf chirped up from the group, whose face was wrinkly and leathery from hard work in the sun. </p><p>“What is your name?” Harry asked, crouched down to be on the same level as everyone.</p><p>“Forry, Mistress. I is called Forry.”</p><p>“Well, that sounds like a splendid idea, Forry, thank you.”</p><p>The last adult elf stepped forward with a bow, “I is Yumbo and I is doing anything Mistress asks.” </p><p>Harry smiled at him gently, “Well, we do need a healer. Perhaps you would be willing to study up on it.”</p><p>Yumbo bowed, “Yes Mistress.”</p><p>Harry turned her eyes to the last two elflings without any parents. Her gaze slightly sad, “What are your names darlings?”</p><p>“Loopey and Weely, Mistress.” Loopey, a little Elfling with large blue eyes answered.</p><p>“May I ask where your parents are?”</p><p>This time Weely, the smallest Elfling of the whole bunch, answered. “Misters took them away. Weely and Loopey was left behind.”</p><p>“Oh sweeties.” Harry sighed sadly, “Tully, If you wouldn't mind, would you please track down their parents and see whom took them. I wish to bring their parents here so that they aren't without them.”</p><p>Tully, with eyes shining with unshed years, bowed deeply, “Tully be doing so after vows, Mistress.”</p><p>Harry stood up, clasping her hands together. “Very well, since I believe we have discussed everything to our mutual satisfaction, we shall begin.” She paused for a moment, drawing her Holly wand and placing it above her heart. “I, Hariel Lilian Peverell, do hereby swear to Magic herself, that I will, to my upmost abilities shall care for, nourish and protect those who swear to take care of, assist and honor the House of Peverell. I shall do my best to ensure that all needs are cared for and that they shall want for nothing. So mote it be.”</p><p>The Elves gathered together, holding hands so that everyone was somehow connected before they spoke in unison. “We swears on our magics to honor the House of Peverell. We shall bes good Elves and Elfings and nots be getting into trouble. We’s accept Mistress Hariel as our master and shall serve her forevermore.”</p><p>A gold band of magic wove around the group of elf and witch, binding them together. Harry smiled at them, “I believe that many great things shall come as we work together. Let us do our best as a team!”</p><p>--</p><p>Tully, the Head Elf, considered him a lucky one. He and his family had been taken in by a kind witch, one who treated them with more respect and kindness than any had shown him before in his long life. While most elves typically were passed down through the family, Tully’s previous master had died without any heirs and he and his family had been taken to the shop. He had expected them to be taken to different homes, never to see each other again. And yes, Mistress Hariel was so unique and unlike anything he had ever expected.</p><p>She wanted one meal a day with all of the Elves, typically lunch. Mistress Hariel, or Harry, “Just Harry, If you please.” was always polite and did her best to ensure that everyone was happy. She also seemed to have a soft spot for those who were hurt, wronged or bullied. In the few weeks of being her Elf, Tully had watched as she had confronted the two Wizarding families who had adopted the Elfings parents. In a matter of hours, she had brought them back home to their child. She had found a lost, abused Kneazle, caring for it until it was healed. A two-feet long runespoor soon followed, who Mistress Harry kept on her person at all times and could randomly be seen talking to all three heads. Somehow, late one night, she had appeared on the property with a injured Re’em, whom was quickly settled in the stables on the land, which until that incident had only had horses inside. Not long after the Re’em, did she appear with a baby Graphorn that she had rescued from poachers. It seemed that she would bring home any stray she would find and Tully loved her all the more for it.</p><p>It wasn't often that Tully felt he had been blessed in his life, three times so far. When he had met his life mate, Hinky, when his daughter had been born and when Mistress Harry took them in. The House Elf gazed at the witch, who was currently entertaining the four Elflings with a story. She had a future. One that would change the world for the better.</p><p>--</p><p>Harry sat at her desk, lips pursed as she gazed at the empty parchment paper in front of her. After bringing the graphorn back home, she realized that the Re’em and it couldn't stay. They had to be somewhere where they could properly be looked after. And she knew just the person. Her problem, how did she apologize for leaving so suddenly.</p><p>It had been an interesting talk with Death she had had that caused her to feel the need to write the wizard a letter.</p><p>
  <em>‘Death, am I in the same timeline from when I met Newt Scamander?’</em>
</p><p>Death had answered, though he hadn't appeared like before, likely either being too busy or too lazy to manifest a body. <em>‘Indeed you are, little one.’</em></p><p><em>‘Thank you, Death.’</em> He hadn't replied and she hasn't expected one.</p><p>
  <em>
Newt</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I hope this letter reaches you in good health. You might or might not remember but several years ago, I visited with you to your mother's estate. It was quite an invigorating trip, one that I have cherished. I have recently come upon an inheritance and as such, I find myself in a bit of a predicament. I have recently rescued a Re’em and Graphorn. I worry for them as the Re’em was taken by a insolent individual who cared not for its health. The Graphorn, a baby, was taken from poachers and I worry about its survival. If you are available, I would greatly appreciate your advice and visitation in this manner. Enclosed, I have added a portkey, the password is Goldenbeak, simply speak it when and if you are able to come and it shall deposit you in my foyer.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I do hope that Goldenbeak is well, I do miss her and think of her fondly. Is Pickett still with you? I do hope I didn't worry you with my abrupt disappearance. I'm afraid that I didn't know it would happen until it did.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I hope to hear, or see from you soon.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Lady Hariel Peverell</em>
</p><p>Satisfied at her letter, she placed the portkey, a quill, in the letter before rolling it up and sealing it shut with a wax seal with the crest of the House of Peverell. It took only a moment to tie it around the leg of a Pharaoh Eagle Owl, by the name of Hatshepsut, the owl was almost as bossy as Hedwig used to be. It had been with a heavy heart that she had brought Hat (for short) home, but she didn't regret her decision. Hat was a completely different owl, one that hated every human but her.</p><p>Hat hooted once before taking off of her perch, that was right next to the desk in her study. Harry always kept the window there open so that Hat could come and go as she pleased.</p><p>It only took a day and a half before the sound of someone being portkeyed to her foyer gathered her attention away from the family grimoire she had been studying. Harry placed the book in a drawer in her desk, quickly locking it before making her way to the foyer, where Tully was greeting her guests. Newt Scamander stood in the middle of her foyer, escorting a witch, whose hand was in the crook of his elbow. Harry smiled watching as the surprise covered Newt’s face at her appearance. Despite the years, he hasn't changed much in the past eighteen years, simply gaining a few wrinkles that he hadn't had before. “Hello Newt, welcome to my home.”</p><p>Newt’s eyes had widened considerably, “Harry, you look like you haven't aged at all!”</p><p>Harry laughed, watching as his companion turned to stare at her. “It is so wonderful to see you again. I hope all is well with you.”</p><p>“Harry, so good to see you. Allow me to introduce my wife to you, Porpentina. Tina, this is Harry, I met her after coming home. I believe I have told you about her.” Newt introduced them, a happy smile on his face.</p><p>“It's wonderful to meet you Tina. Welcome to my home.” Harry stepped forward, shaking her hand.</p><p>“Thank you Harry. It is a beautiful home.” Tina smiled softly, dressed in soft purple robes with a dark suit on underneath.</p><p>“Ah, may I see the creatures? We came as soon as your owl arrived with your letter.” Newt asked, smile disappearing at the worry evident on his face.</p><p>“Of course, follow me.” Harry led them through the front doors, revealing the beautiful front of the property. A paved pathway lead from the front door and around to a gate at the beginnings of the land. To the left lay a beautiful garden, with blooming trees and plants. To the right was a sectioned off pasture and a large barn which she lead her guests too. “I've gotten the Graphorn to eat but I am worried. I know they are an endangered species and my friend, whom alerted me to the poor dear, didn't have the resources or knowledge to care for it. He was obviously taken by poachers but I'm afraid he won't last long without his parents.” She opened one of the barn doors, revealing multiple stables that for the most part were empty. Near the back of the barn the Re’em stood eating while nearer to the front, Harry had the Graphorn stay. Newt immediately made his way to the magical creature, taking in the malnourished body and how young it was.</p><p>“Has it eaten?” He asked, waving his wand over it as he read through the report his examination spell gave him.</p><p>“Once, but it's been crying. Poor dear.” Harry replied, standing outside of the stall with Tina.</p><p>The two witches watched Newt enter the stall before sitting down, waiting for the creature to trust him enough to get curious. Harry turned to the witch beside her, “I'm quite glad Newt found someone, he seems like the type that would forget his own health to help another.”</p><p>“Yes, he is the type to completely forget to eat unless someone reminds him and yet, he never misses to feed his babies.” Tina answered, arms crossed over her chest as they watched Newt.</p><p>“I am ever so glad that you arrived as quickly as you did. While Gully has been doing phenomenal with them, he isn't as experienced with magical creatures as he is with non-magical animals but he has done a splendid job so far. He even managed to make the little one eat a small meal.”</p><p>“Gully?” Tina, looking confused.</p><p>“Gully, please come here at your earliest convenience.” Harry called out into the air.</p><p>Within seconds, Gully appeared. He was taller than the other Elves, with the same large eyes that all elves seemed to naturally have. His tunic, a pure black color had the Peverell House crest in gold sown in perfect detail on the front of it. “Gully comes when Mistress asks.” He said with a bow.</p><p>“Gully, this is Mrs. Tina Scamander and her husband, Mr. Newt Scamander, they are here to look over the Re’em and Graphorn.” Harry told him, looking far too pleased with herself.</p><p>“I is thanking you for coming, Mistress’ guests. Gully tries and tries but baby won't eat.” His ears drooped down in sadness.</p><p>Newt finally spoke up from where he was carefully letting the Graphorn eat from the palm of his hand. “You did a wonderful job Gully. You probably saved this little one's life with your care. How is the Re’em?”</p><p>Gully visibly perked up, eager to share, “Re’em had hurt leg but Gully fixed him right up!”</p><p>Newt glanced over at Harry who described the situation in more detail, “The poor dear had a broken front leg, the wizard whom it was removed from had it locked in a cramped little crate, barely large enough for it to stand in. I was alerted by a friend in the Ministry before they came to raid the home, so that it wouldn't be put down for potions parts.” And wasn't Harry lucky that she had run into Lucian Lovegood, Luna’s grandfather who was exactly like his granddaughter. He seemed to know exactly who she was without them ever talking and had instantly befriended her. She hasn't cared, simply because she had missed the funny girl who had become a dear friend to her.</p><p>Newt scowled, “I hate bureaucrats sometimes.” He turned his attention back to the Graphorn, who tried to huddle against him as hard as it could, in an effort for protection. “Are you alright with me taking both? I have helped set up the Graphorn sanctuary and I know of a Re’em herd I can introduce this one too.”</p><p>“Of course, I did call for you, didn't I? Who else to take them home than Britain's most famous Magizoologist.”</p><p>Tina laughed in delight as Newt blushed heavily under the praise. “I never tire of his humbleness.”</p><p>Harry smiled, “Will you both be spending the night? Shall I ask Hokey and Pokey to prepare a guest room for you?”</p><p>Tina glanced over at Newt, “I feel like he will put them in the suitcase  and then we shall probably head home, he has changed half of our house to match the suitcase as a better environment for magical creatures to stay in now. He'll want to get it in its natural environment and try and nurse it back to health.”</p><p>Harry smiled, “I understand.”</p><p>It took several hours for Newt to coax the Graphorn into the suitcase and the Re’em only needed to follow a carrot before being led inside. After they were settled, the couple said goodbye to the time traveler before flooing away, leaving the woman alone once more.</p><p>--</p><p>Tom Riddle had been having an interesting morning. He had woken early like usual, showered and had his appearance pristine before heading down to the common room to read until the rest of his cronies: Levi Lestrange, Eli Mulciber, Chi Wray, Abraxas Malfoy and Franklin Campton. With the exception of Malfoy, the other boys shared the same dorm as him. While his followers all feared and obeyed his command, he hadn't yet revealed his public face to others.</p><p>It took another hour before the rest of his dorm mates dragged themselves downstairs. The group headed out as one to breakfast, though Tom simply listened with half-heartedly to the discussion between them over which witch of their year had filled out the most during summer vacation. When they entered the Great Hall, Tom was quick to sit down at the end of the Slytherin table. Although many still hadn't yet gone to their tables for breakfast, it was quickly starting to fill with students and faculty. The wizard began putting bacon, eggs, toast and biscuits on his plate before eating as politely as he could. It wouldn't do for anyone to believe that he was a slob with no manners.</p><p>Halfway through the breakfast, the windows opened, allowing the owls to arrive with the mail for the day. Tom watched as a peculiar looking owl made its way towards him before landing neatly to his side. His eyebrows raised in curiosity as he hadn't been expecting a letter from anyone, anytime soon. He quickly took the letter marked Tom Riddle, noting a second letter underneath marked Horace Slughorn. The owl quickly flew into the air before making its way to the Potions Professor and Slytherin Head of House, who was conversing with the Runes Professor, Gibbon.</p><p>The Slytherin sixth year, turned the letter over, noting the wax seal with a House Crest on it. Unable to place the name of the house, Tom opened the letter carefully, making sure not to damage the crest so that he could have Abraxas or Levi look it over later. The letter was long, several pages of it and in an interesting smooth, fluid feminine handwriting. Thoroughly curious and ignoring the looks he was receiving from his fellow yearmates, he read through the letter.</p><p>
  <em>Mr. Riddle</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I hope this letter reaches you in good health. While the abruptness of this letter might alarm you, it is something that I have pondered how to explain without insulting you and I decided that blunt truth may be a better example than hiding it behind flattering words of subtly. I presume that you are curious as to whom I am and why I am writing to you. My name is Lady Hariel Peverell, and I am the Head of the Ancient and Royal House of Peverell, one of the oldest bloodlines in Britain. Several months ago, when I claimed Ladyship, I began the search of others who carried the Blood of Peverell in their veins as I believed that I was all that remained.</em>
</p><p><em>You, Mr. Riddle, are the only other direct descendant of the Peverell family. I was quite astonished and elated by the idea of another of whom I could call family. I have lived most of my life, knowing that our family had all but died out a hundred years ago and mourned the idea of the family dying out if I do not bear children.</em> </p><p>
  <em>I do not wish to presume your thoughts, for we haven't met yet, and that would be so utterly rude of me to do so. If you wish to meet, to discuss your involvement in the family, such as claiming an inheritance and taking the Peverell name, please do not hesitate to write back. Or, if you find yourself more agreeable, I have sent a letter to the Head of the Slytherin house so that I may floo to Hogwarts and we may have a meeting to discuss in person. Simply ask your head of house and he shall make an appointment for us to meet. I can also provide proof of your blood ties in the Peverell family. Included in this, I have added a miniature copy of the Peverell family tree so that you may see the truth of my word. I hope to hear back from you at your earliest convenience. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Best wishes,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Lady Hariel Peverell</em>
</p><p>It took two times for him to read through the letter before the words finally hit him. If what she was saying was true, then the possibilities were endless. He could have somewhere to stay during summer vacation other than that awful orphanage. He would have the prestige he wanted, needed, craved. The future Dark Lord turned sharply to Malfoy who sat next to him on the the right, talking quietly to Levi Lestrange next to him. “What can you tell me about the Peverell family?”</p><p>Malfoy turned towards him instantly, brows furrowed together as he mentally gathered all of the information he knew. “One of the oldest families, they were here even back in the Founders days. They were Muggle royalty for a while, though a lot of that information was destroyed during rebellions.” He paused, “The last person who held the name Peverell until quite recently was Tiberius Peverell, who specialized in rituals and I believe the name has passed to a new Lady, who only claimed it several months ago.” He paused, trying to recollect the name before ruefully shaking his head, “I'm afraid her name escapes me at the moment. Though I do remember that it caused quite a stir as she is unmarried and has turned down several betrothal contracts while claiming the Peverell seat in the Wizgamot.”</p><p>Tom smiled tightly, “Thank you, Abraxas, I find that I will be busy after dinner should anyone require my presence.”</p><p>Malfoy raised a blond eyebrow before nodding, “Of course Tom, I'll be sure to inform any admirers.”</p><p>Across the table, Walburga Black, Rosalyn Greengrass and Rhonda Dunbar sat, chatting quietly about news from Lady Black, who had written Walburga earlier. After relaying the information to them, the eldest Black daughter turned to the Prince of Slytherin. “Mother just informed me that Lady Peverell invited her and father to tea. Something about renewing an old alliance between the families. So it seems that the Peverell family is coming back.” She paused for dramatic effect, “Which is quite an excellent idea considering how many unworthy people keep flooding and infecting our ministry. Having an old family back in play will change things up quite considerably.”</p><p>“Oh yes, the sooner we get rid of those nasty mudbloods, the quicker we will be able to host our festivals again.” Rhonda quickly replied back, flipping a lock of her blonde hair back.</p><p>Tom gazed at the three girls for a moment, expressionless before a small smile appeared. “Of course, and I believe that if we can, we must do the best we can to preserve our traditions, after all, without them, how else are we to rejoice in our magic?”</p><p>Rosalyn sighed softly, staring at the wizard with infatuated eyes, “I do so love how much you wish to keep our traditions alive, Tom, it's simply courageous.”</p><p>The half-bloods smile grew tight at her affections. He gazed around the room, noting that everyone had begun dispersing and heading to classes, Professor Slughorn being one of them before he turned to Abraxas and quietly informed him, “I will be going now.” He didn't wait for a reply, simply grabbing his book bag and stepping away from the bench. With his long legs, he caught up with Professor Slughorn who was headed to the Potions classroom in a matter of minutes despite the headstart he had.</p><p>“Professor, a moment of your time?” Tom called out, watching the older man turn in his direction before a cautious smile appeared on his face.</p><p>“Y..yes, Tom?” Slughorn stuttered out, making Tom mentally curse. Ever since that conversation about Horcrux, the man hadn't wanted anything to do with him. He probably would have stopped inviting him to Slug Meetings except that it would raise too many questions, after all, he was a Prefect and the obvious choice for Head Boy next year.</p><p>“I wanted to say that I decided to stop searching for information about that topic. I found that even for I, it is far too powerful and I would hate to allow my magic to be corrupted in such a way.” He paused, noting the widening of surprise in the others face. “After all, I hope to be a teacher here one day, and it wouldn't do for the Dark magic to stop my dreams.” He lied through his teeth, he never planned on stopping studying dark magic, “I mean, you are the one who inspired me to be a professor, it wouldn't do for me to become known as someone who went wayward.” He shook his head almost ruefully, “Though I do appreciate you trying to help satisfy my curiosity, sometimes, I'm afraid, it gets the best of me.”</p><p>Slughorn seemed shocked at first before his entire body relaxed, “Of course Tom! You are much more mature than others your age. It is good of you to know your limits! That is some of the darkest magic there is.” He shook his head, any doubts disappearing at his reassurance and complement. “You are one of the brightest wizards of your age, so I shan't say I'm surprised you came to the realization quicker than others but I am happy all the same.”</p><p>“Thank you Professor for caring where others have not, I find that it Is most rare to find such a man who cares about the safety of his students like you do.” Tom flattered.</p><p>Horace Slughorn flushed under the praise, “Well, you have always been one of my favorite students. You'll definitely be going places, my boy! I've told you so many times. A bright future ahead of you.” He started walking back towards his rooms, with Tom following next to him. “Interestingly enough, I received a letter earlier of a young Lady who actually requested a meeting with you. I'm not sure if you've heard of the family name before, they're a most prominent family in our history though I believe that they have been busy in other countries with trade for the last hundred years. Peverell, a very reputable family. The current Lady said she had an inheritance to talk to you about, most rare indeed! It isn't often that the Peverell’s occupy themselves in England. I believe the late Peverell Lord spent a good majority of his life in the America’s.” He leaned to whisper conspiratorially, “Rumor is, is that the Peverell’s have a long history of being Unspeakables, which is why they often are out of the country.”</p><p>At the surprised look that flashed over Tom’s face, the Potion’s Professor chuckled, “Of course that is all just rumors. Nothing has ever been confirmed - or denied.”</p><p>“I would like to meet her then, Professor, if you wouldn't mind contacting her and letting her know.” Tom asked.</p><p>“Of course, my boy! It would be simply shameful to hide the heritage from a young magical, simply shameful.” He shook his head, “That said, I'll go send a reply letter and let you know when it will be arranged so that you can meet.”</p><p>“Thank you Professor, I appreciate you taking the time to assist me in this manner.” Tom said graciously, his handsome face stretched in a smile.</p><p>“Not at all, my boy. Simply don’t forget about little old me when you get older.” The man joked.</p><p>“Of course not, Professor.” He smiled genially. “I should head to the common room, I have an essay for Charms to finish. Thank you again, Professor.” He turned around and began making his way to the common room, the older man missing the sly smirk on the prefect’s face at not only successfully convincing him that everything was normal but to also contact the mysterious woman. Everything was falling into place and if it all worked out like he planned, then this little addition of being included in the Peverell Family would only speed up his plans.</p>
