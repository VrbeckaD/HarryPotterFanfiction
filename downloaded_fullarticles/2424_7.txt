    <p>It was fitting that he was dying under the stars, Draco thought. He had forgotten how brightly they shined. Forgotten the smell of grass, the cool, fresh breeze that carassed his face gently. How easy it was to get swept up in silly, human things and to forget the simple beauty of nature. He should have looked at the stars more. He should have.</p><p>“Daddy?” A moment later, his view of the glorious night sky was blocked by two wide-eyed faces. “What are you doing here?”</p><p>“Get away from me, children,” Draco raised a hand to push them away, only to let it fall back to his side. “I’m contagious.”</p><p>“Kon-tay-gus?” Asked Scorpius in a puzzled voice.</p><p>“It means he will give us his sickness, silly,” said Rose, red hair bouncing as she sat up on the balls of her feet.</p><p>“Are you sick, Daddy?” Scorpius leaned over him again.</p><p>“I am,” replied Draco. “Don’t get too close to me. The two of you should go back to the tent.”</p><p>“Are you going to be okay?”</p><p>At that, Draco felt his calmness start to fracture. He had resigned himself to death, but now, with the two children looking at him with their wide, curious eyes, Draco felt sad.</p><p>“No,” he told them, swallowing a lump in hid throat, “ I’m afraid I might not make it.”</p><p>He watched as his son’s eyes start to fill with tears, and wondered whether it had been a wise thing to say. Probably not. But in his feverish haze, it had seemed better than lying.</p><p>“Mummy!” He heard Rose yell as her footfalls faded. She had gotten up from beside him and run towards the tent. “Malfoy’s out in the grass mummy! He’s dying!”</p><p>Next to him, Scorpius had started crying in earnest.</p><p>“You have to be strong, Scorpius,” he told his son sombrely. “Your mum and Hermione will take good care of you.”</p><p>“I d-don w-w-want you t-to di-iie!” Scorpius sniffed through his tears.</p><p>“He’s not going to die, love,” he heard Granger’s voice say a moment before she dropped beside Scorpius and wrapped her arms around him. “Your daddy just has a little fever, and a penchant for the dramatic. He’ll be fine.” She wiped away Scorpius’s tears and glared at Draco. Rose stood at Granger’s shoulders, biting her lips.</p><p>“Is Malfoy really going to be okay, mummy?” She asked.</p><p>“He’s fine love,” said Granger, “Just a bit of flu, just like you and Scorpius had a few weeks back. Now, go back to the tent and take Scorpius with you before the two of you catch a chill.”</p><p>Rose Weasley looked at Granger, then at Draco, her mouth a grim line. But she seemed to believe her mother, because she took Scorpius by the shoulder and ushered him away, whispering in his ears about how her mummy was always right.</p><p>“Really, Malfoy?” Granger did not look happy. “You told the kids you were dying?”</p><p>“But I <em>am</em> dying,” Draco said sadly.</p><p>“You’re not dying. Stop being so melodramatic,” Granger rolled her eyes.</p><p>“I’m not being dramatic, Granger, I have ebola. The google said so.”</p><p>“The google?” Granger asked incredulously. “The google, Malfoy? Have you been googling your symptoms on the internet?”</p><p>“I just asked The Google on your plastic thing-”</p><p>Granger groaned. “You can’t believe everything you find on google, Malfoy, especially not about your health.”</p><p>“<em>You</em> are the one who insists on asking The google everything!”</p><p>“That is different.”</p><p>“How is it different? If The Google can magically tell you how to get from one place to another, then how can it be wrong about me?”</p><p>“Honestly, Malfoy!”</p><p>“You tell me, Granger. You swear by The Google.”</p><p>“You don’t have ebola, Malfoy. And you aren’t dying.”</p><p>“You will be sorry when I do. You will be so sorry, Granger, when you find out I have ebola and I died with you refusing to believe me.”</p><p>Granger rolled her eyes. “The only thing you are going to have if you keep lying here, Malfoy, is pneumonia.” She got up. “Come back to the tent Malfoy. The kids and I are going to drink hot chocolate and sleep.”</p><p>“New more near?” Draco repeated. What did she mean by that? “GRANGER! YOU CAN’T JUST LEAVE ME HERE!”</p><p>He was going to have to ask The Google.</p>
