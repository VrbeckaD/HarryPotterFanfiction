          <div class="userstuff"><p>In her laugh, claws;<br/>A fifty foot drop from a dangling cliff.<br/>She drips ruby words from lips stained<br/>black-cherry, taking them down,<br/>one by one.<br/><i>Us.</i><br/>Taking us down, Hermione thinks<br/>as she observes Parkinson’s wit,<br/>a train through an unlit tunnel,<br/>all sound and exhaust,<br/>forward thrust; no parry<br/>in her attack; only slice, gouge;<br/>Only the blood of her wine sloshing<br/>in her glass, her eyes wobbly with drink,<br/>her words cut from sackcloth, <br/>black as pearls.</p><p>The bottle spins,<br/>a whirligig, a Time Turner<br/>bringing her back to before<br/>she made her parents forget,<br/>wiping the mantelpiece clean<br/>of her own dust;<br/>They never had a daughter <br/>so bright she made Venus shrink<br/>and Athena cower<br/>and monsters shred like parchment,<br/>and sometimes with only her words too.<br/>They have that in common:<br/>Words like wands, a chorus<br/>of incantations delivered cold,<br/>indiscriminate, like an avalanche<br/>bearing down, obliterating into blank white<br/>everything objectionable.</p><p>They have this in common: the feathered cut.</p><p>The bottle stops on Neville.<br/>Pansy is the first to cite his every shortcoming,<br/>his utter incompatibility with Padma,<br/>the spinner, the one whom he’s meant to kiss.<br/>Pansy tears him asunder, laughs<br/>into her wine glass:<br/><i>Wouldn’t know how to kiss a girl<br/>if there’d been a NEWT on it.<br/>Fucking Troll out, he would have.</i><br/>How many glasses now?<br/>She's deep into it, Hermione thinks.<br/>Pour after pour, like tonic down her throat;<br/>Her top has slithered off her shoulder,<br/>a snakeskin sloughing.<br/>Underneath, she shines. <br/>That shoulder, pink,<br/>Angelic dirty flower, iris,<br/>Petals taking rain like lips.</p><p>No one should look so pretty<br/>while being so vile.</p><p>Eighth year, supposed to be their salvation<br/>yet Parkinson’s had more detentions than not.<br/>She fucked a boy <br/>in the restricted section of the library,<br/>or so the rumour goes.<br/>No word on the boy<br/>though names have flown<br/>around corners, through chimneys,<br/>behind hands, eyes flitting over to her<br/>even as later it’s <i>Oh Pansy, your hair looks LOVELY, darling!</i><br/>She’s no one’s darling now.<br/>Hermione’s seen her: alone, book open, lip bit.<br/>Curled into a chair like a child,<br/>twirling a quill, looking lost.<br/><i>What the bloody hell are YOU looking at?</i><br/>Flung, like fishing line, looking for bait<br/>across empty water,<br/>empty rooms,<br/>singing a note like <i>please</i>,<br/>Like a hallelujah in rewind,<br/>like <i>save me</i>: Em Evas.</p><p>Hermione sees it now, that look,<br/>disguised as a Fury, come to slay you<br/>for being mortal:<br/>The bottle has stilled.</p><p>‘Of course. Bloody Granger.’<br/>But this seems all she’s capable of.<br/>Hardly worthy, this fool of a foe.<br/>This girl in plaid socks,<br/>This… parting of lips,<br/>A tiny lick of them.<br/>Almost imperceptible.</p><p><i>She’s vile,</i> Hermione tells herself—<br/>as she crosses the space,<br/>sinks her hand into that bob of black hair,<br/>Egyptian silk, mad dreams’ worth, <br/>curling against her knuckles.</p><p>Their mouths meet,<br/>and Pansy doesn’t breathe.<br/>Flashing rose neon,<br/>this pulse between them,<br/>all bloodborne and toxic and golden<br/>like a violin string vibrating against the air.<br/>It goes beyond kissing:<br/>They unleash <i>demons</i>.<br/>They move secrets and make words flesh.<br/>They speak in tongues, over balconies,<br/>Waterfalls, everything steep and fraught.<br/>They bridge one another,<br/>hands gripping tighterthantight,<br/>swept through with halting breaths,<br/>breathed in unison, counterpoint,<br/>unison again.</p><p>They part regretfully,<br/>magic unfurled between them<br/>lying in pools of weak light,<br/>one undone by the other.</p><p>Pansy’s not supposed to taste like ambrosia,<br/>like the swift hand of forgiveness<br/>rushing her body, the fade of time<br/>corroding the rules between them.<br/>Vertigo isn’t supposed to be sweet like this,<br/>like tilting—harsh and ecstatic—into chaos.</p><p>She just wanted to shut her up for fuck’s sake.</p><p>Watching Pansy blink—the black of her eyes<br/>all sooty and soft—<br/>shouldn’t feel like Apparition,<br/>a side-along into new territory,<br/>no cliffs in sight,<br/>or at least the kind<br/>you run at<br/>with wings opening at your back:</p><p>Falling up.</p></div>
