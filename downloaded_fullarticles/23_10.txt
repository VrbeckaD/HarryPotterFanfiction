  <b>Godric’s Hollow</b>
</p><p>Harry Potter was not a 'normal' girl. </p><p>Pretty, sweet, polite, and kind maybe... but never 'normal'.</p><p>Oh, she knew this all too well- she had ever since she was set down carefully in the wooden cradle as the elder Potters were distracted, the other small crying baby she was meant to look like being carried off by a man with pointed ears.</p><p>She never cried in fear- as she found it demeaning and otherwise a waste of time- so when the man with the pale skin and gleaming red eyes stood over her, she didn’t cry. Not even when the warm splatters of blood hit her small onesie from the woman that she assumed was the other baby’s mother. Not even as the Dark Lord raised his wand at her with a serpentine hiss. Green eyes the color of fresh grass just watched the wizard in front of her. </p><p>Did the man not realize that this was what she was destined for?</p><p>The Killing Curse arched, before hitting her, and she let her eyes slip closed.</p><p>That curse was fatal to <em>wizards</em>. A magic that had been made by <em>wizards</em>, to kill <em>wizards</em>. It held no power over all that was made from magic itself, a child of the Immortal Ones that governed every existing part of the world around them. Instead, with a shockwave, a green light exploded through the house, vaporising the red-eyed man with a horrible scream.</p><p>Still, every action has a consequence and the girl with the brilliant green eyes slumped in the wooden cradle as the use of the ancient protection had worn out her small body, a bloody gash in the shape of a lightning bolt scar etched in blood on her forehead.</p><p>But before we start the story of one Harry-Potter-that-was-not-really-Harry-Potter, we have to go back to a time long forgotten.</p><p> </p><p>
  <b> <em>The Enchanted Halls of the Faerie Courts</em> </b>
</p><p>
  <em> It was some time after the Fey had left the management of magic to the humans- the small fleshy creatures’ greed driving away the old race after multiple wars with the wizards (that were always started over the littlest things).  </em>
</p><p>
  <em> The Summer Queen and the Winter King sat on the opposite sides of a massive marble hall, their respective courts surrounding them. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> “My Queen.” The King’s voice was like the harsh wind and the chill of ice. “You called this conclave?” A thin layer of frost spread across the floor from the throne made of jagged ice, reaching towards the summer court. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> With a smile that was as blinding as the hot sun, the frost was swiftly melted, creating a line in the room- one side frost and the other heated stone. “I apologize for the call, My King, but the oracle has spoken and she believes that we both must be in accordance with this.” </em>
</p><p>
  <em> The hard grey eyes of the Winter King widened just a bit, before he dipped his head. “Very well. I will join the conclave of my own will to hear her out.” </em>
</p><p>
  <em> With those words spoken, a section of stone slid away right where the line of the two courts met, a girl with unfocused silver eyes and a long walking stick moving out slowly. “I see you two are just as petty as usual.” The girl seemed to not notice the similar piercing glares sent her way, just stopping to sit down on a small wooden stool. “Bring out the Princess please.” </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Both courts froze. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> The Summer Queen, hair seeming to glow as if with the fire of the sun, rose from her throne of brambles and wide palm leaves. “What does the Princess have to do with any prophecy of yours!” </em>
</p><p>
  <em> “Mother.” A girl stepped from the crowd of the summer court, waving off the warriors that started to follow her. With the green eyes of Summer and the long midnight hair of Winter, this girl was undoubtedly Spring, her presence all of Winter’s strength without his emotionless heart of ice and Summer’s warmth without her fiery temper. “I am called forward, so I will answer to the conclave willingly.” </em>
</p><p>
  <em> The Oracle looked at the girl that stood on the line between the courts, beloved by both, and found herself wishing there was some other way. “Magic will soon tip out of balance- and if not fixed it will die.” There were sounds of outrage and cries of horror, but she waited patiently until the crowd calmed. “And only you, Spring, can restore the balance.” </em>
</p><p>
  <em> At this there was upheaval- both courts breaking into yelling. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> “SILENCE!” Winter’s voice cut through the courts like a cutting gust of icy wind. Emotionless steel grey eyes turned on the Oracle. “And what is required of the Princess?” </em>
</p><p>
  <em> There was only pity in the silver eyes. “Spring must be placed as a changeling, the boy named Harry James Potter taken and raised in secret. From there, she must then dismantle the web of lies the false Light Lord has woven over everyone and restore the Light and Dark Lords to equal power.” </em>
</p><p>
  <em> The bright green eyes of the one beloved by so many dimmed a bit, but even with both courts trying to plead some other way, the girl moved to kneel in front of the Oracle with her head bowed. “I understand... and will do everything in my power to restore this balance.”  </em>
</p><p>
  <em> The promise rang through the room and both courts fell silent. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> The Princess had chosen her fate. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <b>Godric’s Hollow</b>
</p><p>Albus Dumbledore apparated to Godric's Hollow, blood running cold as he looked at the decimated house, it’s wards lying in ruins and the top floor seeming to have collapsed. Hagrid instantly started to dig through the rubble, sobbing louder at finding both Lily and James’ bodies.</p><p>
  <em> Harry was supposed to survive. Supposed to be his pawn in reining Tom back in. Now what would he d- </em>
</p><p>“ALBUS!” Hagrid bounded out of the house, the ground shaking, a bundle in his arms. “Harry! He’s alive!”</p><p>Just then the sound of a familiar motorbike reached the old Headmaster’s ears and he wanted to scowl. <em> Just as he was thinking out a plan to make the boy his perfect little Light soldier- of course the mutt would show up… </em> Turning around, he made his face mournful for Sirius Black, who was looking at the destroyed house in horror and disbelief. “Sirius, my boy… Look away. It’s not a sight anyone should have to see.”</p><p>Sirius whipped around, eyes finding the bundle in Hagrid's arms and the Auror let out a breath of relief. “Harry! Thank Merlin… I should get him somewhere- somewhere safe in case-”</p><p>Albus interrupted that train of thought quickly. “Voldemort is defeated.” The other two men looked at him with wide eyes. “Harry must be placed in a safe place, but do not worry, I will take care of that.”</p><p>
  <em> He had the perfect place for the brat to learn to be subservient.  </em>
</p><p>The Auror opened his mouth to object, eyebrows furrowing.</p><p>“Sirius, we both know Pettegrew will go free if he is not found. You must find the traitor before he can hide away and hurt Harry again.”</p><p>
  <em> And by the time you come for the boy, he will be far away from you, in a household that will make sure he is a good soldier. </em>
</p><p>Grey eyes turned cold. “Fine. Take my bike Hagrid. I’m out for that rat’s blood.”</p><p> </p><p>So like that, the baby everyone <em>thought</em> was Harry Potter was given to Hagrid before being left on a cold doorstep in the beginning of a November snow with nothing but a blanket and a web of curses sinking into her magical core. </p><p>And in the morning, when she was found, the horse-faced woman would forever swear the girl was the devil just by the way the snow had perfectly surrounded the baby, not even a flake having landed on her. </p><p>Let it never be said that Winter does not take care of it’s own.</p>
