    <p>          Draco raised the heart of a dragon up to his eye.  Well, to be more exact, Draco examined a dragon’s left ventricle under a magnifying glass.  It was important to check for impurities before using any part of a dragon in potions.  Verifying its quality, Draco sliced the ventricle into strips and dumped them into his cauldron, turning the broiling mixture inside a pleasant shade of plum.</p><p>          Rubbing his hands together, Draco reached for a stirring rod when the arrival of a paper airplane interrupted him.  The avian memo stopped in front of Draco’s nose.  Eyes crossing, Draco swiped the memo from the air and opened it.  </p><p>      <em>    3 pepperup potions please!</em></p><p>
  <em>                                            -Meryl</em>
</p><p>          Draco smirked at the sender.  Only Meryl, the 60-something secretary at St. Mungos, would have the humor to send a memo that demanded attention so incessantly.  Draco penned a quick response and went to work. </p><p>          Draco moved his current cauldron over and pulled out a new one, rolling up his sleeves and revealing a large tattoo on his left forearm.  At nine a.m., St. Mungos was already running at full throttle, and the current flu and cold season made the number of patients increase exponentially.  Draco would never understand why there was only one magical hospital in the entirety of the United Kingdom, but it wasn’t his job to question things.  His job was to brew solutions.</p><p>          Five pepperup potions later—Draco brewed a couple extra for good measure—and back out came Draco’s earlier concoction.  The plum color had shifted to an uneasy violet, so Draco decided to pull out a few prunes and plop them in.  He smiled at the change in color.  Potion making was certainly an exact “science” of sorts, but the amount of freedom experimentation allowed was exciting. </p><p>          It was not long before another memo came in.  Draco put his cauldron back up and began working on the new request.  And then another one came.  And then another and another.  Quickly, the hours slid together, Draco in a frenzy of work.  Potions made sense to Draco in a way that people did not.  With a potion, as long as Draco added the right ingredients and stirred his concoction the correct number of times, things would remain stable.  But people were unpredictable.  No matter how close Draco was to a person, there was always the chance that they would turn on him.  Maybe that was Draco’s fault, but with potions, Draco knew he had the burden of blame.</p><p>         As Draco was placing a flask of stinksap over a burner for distillation, there was the sound of clicking heels coming down his hallways, a distracting noise to say the least.  Healers wore sensible shoes at St. Mungos, so who could this be?  Draco did not get to look until she was right in the doorway</p><p>        And there she was.  Unwavering. Perfect.  Just like he had remembered her.  </p><p>        “Astoria,” Draco breathed. </p><p>        Astoria grinned, pushing a lock of jet-black hair behind her ear.  “Hey, Draco.”</p><p>        Draco wiped a filthy hand on his robes and held it out for Astoria to shake.  Though she scrunched her nose slightly, Astoria came up and heartily shook her old friend’s hand, ever the lady.  “What are you doing here?”</p><p>        “Oh, just visiting my aunt.  She’s spent the past couple days in the ‘magical bug’ wing, and I thought she could use some company.”</p><p>        “Yes, but what are you doing here?” Draco asked.  St Mungo’s never listed the potion-making basement on the public floorplans.  Even if it did, Draco had kept his employment at St. Mungos a quiet affair.  Most wizards that Draco knew assumed he lived a frivolous life, spending family money in self-imposed isolation.</p><p>        “What?  Am I not allowed to come visit a friend?”  Astoria crossed her arms and pouted in her ever-familiar manner.</p><p>        “First off, patients and visitors actually aren’t allowed down here,” Draco said, “but you know that’s not what I’m asking.”</p><p>        Astoria relaxed her arms.  “If you must know, I heard one of the healers say the word ‘Draco,’ and I knew there was only one wizard unfortunate enough to have that name—”</p><p>        “—Your name is literally Astori—”</p><p>        “—so I asked her, and she sent me here.  The nametag said Lor...?”</p><p>        “Lorraine, but call her Lori if you want to get on her good side,” Draco said.  </p><p>        Astoria laughed, but did not say anything else.  Draco was content drinking in the presence of Astoria.  He knew that his special potion was quickly curdling as it’s stable bubbling turned into a rolling boil, but in that moment, he did not care.</p><p>        “It’s been a while,” Astoria said. </p><p>        “Five years.”  Draco did not mean to sound bitter.  He had no justification.  No concrete history between him and Astoria.  There had never been romance.  Just conversations.  A friendship.  Yet Astoria had been a presence unlike any other at Hogwarts.  A girl who noticed and valued the gentler things in Draco back when everyone praised his cunning.  And when everything in Draco’s life had gone downhill so drastically all those years ago, Astoria’s absence had hurt more than he anticipated.</p><p>        “I only got back a few months ago.  It’s a lame excuse, but after avoiding the terror everyone went through, it felt unfair to come back, unaffected by the war.”</p><p>        “Why did you come back then?” Draco asked.</p><p>        Astoria sighed, looked around Draco’s dingy lab with its elaborate walls of tubing so Draco could instantly deliver potions across the hospital and its cluttered shelves full of questionable substances.  “Did you hear that my mother died?”</p><p>        Draco blinked.  “No.  I-um, I’m sorry.” </p><p>        “It’s alright,” Astoria said. “She died around a year and a half ago actually.  Daphne and I tried staying away from here, but with Mom gone, I guess Korea wasn’t home.”</p><p>        Draco nodded his head.  He put a stirring rod in the cauldron to appear busy.</p><p>        “But who wants to talk about stuff like that?  If you don’t mind me asking, what are you working on?” Astoria asked, leaning to look into Draco’s cauldron.</p><p>        “You’re leaning over noxious fumes” Draco said, pulling her gently away from the cauldron. “And I’m experimenting.”</p><p>        “Oh fun, does St. Mungos like that you’re brewing poison in their dungeon?” Astoria teased.</p><p>        Draco chuckled.  “It’s a basement, and in potion making, it normally takes a couple tries to brew something that won’t kill you.”</p><p>        “What are you trying to brew then?” Astoria asked, holding herself back from putting her head back over the mysterious concoction.</p><p>        “That’s for me to know,” Draco said with a slight smirk.  He could never resist the urge to mess with her.</p><p>        Astoria rolled her eyes.  “Still the same Draco I see.”</p><p>        “You know it.” Draco continued smiling despite the dull pang in his chest.</p><p>        Astoria approached a shelve full of full and empty bottles and vials.  She picked up one vial with an amber liquid suspended in glycerin, her curved nails clinking against the glass.  “I didn’t see you at the Flint’s party last Friday.”</p><p>        “It’s been a while since I’ve been to any parties,” Draco said.  He took Astoria’s vial, and uncorked it, swishing the substance around three times before dumping it in the cauldron. </p><p>        “That’s what they told me when I asked, which still surprises me.  I remembered you loving those things, enchanting the room without fail.  Not that there was much competition back then though,” Astoria said.</p><p>        Draco threw a towel over his shoulders.  “I’m just not like that anymore.  Although I distinctly remembered you sulking in the corner at all those parties, so why choose to go to one?”</p><p>        Astoria pouted, able to detect the hint of judgement.  “I mainly went to see Phoebe, Marcus’ sister.  She was one of the nice ones.”</p><p>        “You’re right.”  Draco hummed a long tone and bounced on the balls of his feet, tapping his wand periodically on the cauldron.  He caught Astoria’s pout slipping a little bit at his silly behavior.  In all honesty, potion making never needed such strange wandwork, but Astoria had been horrid at potions in Hogwarts.  Draco knew he could get away with being silly in the name of magic.  “Mother kept a good friendship with Mrs. Flint in case there was a future with me and Phoebe.”</p><p>        “Oh really?” Astoria questioned.  “Sorry to inform you then, but Phoebe’s engaged to a shiny new wizard from Switzerland.”</p><p>        “As heartbroken as that news leaves me, I think I’ll make it.  I never really had a thing for girls with curly hair.”</p><p>        Astoria swatted Draco’s arm.  “Rude.”</p><p>        “Oh come on, I’m kidding!” Draco held out his arms in surrender.</p><p>        Astoria raised an eyebrow.</p><p>        “Seriously!  I have grown from my old ways.  The person before you is a new man, Miss Greengrass,” Draco insisted.  The cauldron beside them was beginning to shake.  Draco eyed it uncertainly.  Maybe adding that purified venom wasn’t the smartest choice. </p><p>        Unaware of the unstable mixture, Astoria continued with their banter.  “Oh really?  Well then—”</p><p>        Draco pointed his wand at the cauldron.  “Protego Maxima!”  A blue force field encompassed the cauldron right as its contents began to boil over in a rather corrosive manner, eating away at the edges of the cauldron it was spilling over.</p><p>        Astoria stared at the failed experiment.  “Can you promise me you’re not brewing poison?”</p><p>        “I can promise you I’m not brewing poison on purpose,” Draco said, “Can you vanish what’s inside the field for me?”</p><p>        Nodding her head, Astoria slipped her wand out of her robe pockets and easily erased the mess before Draco’s spell broke. </p><p>        “Thank you.” Draco opened up a cabinet and pulled out an extra cauldron, leaving ten more waiting for him. </p><p>        “No problem, but is this a common occurrence?” Astoria asked, pointing her wand at a spot where some of the escaped mixture had burned a hole through the table.</p><p>        Draco shrugged.  “Do you count weekly as common?”</p><p>        Astoria shook her head and smiled.  Draco walked over to his many shelves of ingredients and pulled out a few staples.  Through his research, he knew at least the base three ingredients to start the potion off with.  Walking back to his worktable, Draco stole a look at Astoria.  Since last seeing her when she was 15, Astoria had grown a lot.  She had always been beautiful.   One of the main reasons Jacob Greengrass courted Astoria’s mother was for her beauty.  But this was different.  Like… like her appearance was finally worthy of her personality. </p><p>        “I count that as a sign you need to get out more,” Astoria said.</p><p>        “I’m fine here in my basement,” Draco said.</p><p>        Astoria tilted her head to the side.  “Seriously, what happened?  I’m glad you’re doing work you actually care about now, but this one-eighty in sociability is strange.”</p><p>        “A lot changed after you and your sister left.”  Astoria’s eyes flickered down Draco’s arms where his sleeves were rolled up from work.   Draco yanked the sleeves down, pulling the left down before the right. </p><p>        “You’re right.” Astoria’s wrist twitched.  “I don’t have a right to expect everything to be the same.”</p><p>        A memo flew into the room.  Draco plucked it from the air and read its contents.  Again, he switched cauldrons and began the new potion.  He cleared his throat.  “Don’t hold it against yourself.  If I could have left, I would have too.”</p><p>        Astoria smiled.  “It’s so good to see you again.”</p><p>        “It’s good to see you too.”</p>
