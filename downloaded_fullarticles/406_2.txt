    <p>“These brownies are to die for,” she said while indulging the finest chocolatey desert. </p>
<p>“Camp.”</p>
<p>“Coming from you.”</p>
<p>“Beg you pardon, I’m not camp!”</p>
<p>No one say a friendship was easy, especially between rivals. One, was the most annoying git in the history of their school, an ex-Death Eater, a still foul-mouth bully, but surely easy in the eyes. While the other was the nicest girl in school, that is if your kind of nice was the proper and posh one, certainly the smartest girl, that was pretty and sexy in her own way.</p>
<p>But here they were, Draco Malfoy and Hermione Granger, ‘trapped’ in their odd-friendship that blossomed since their last year of Hogwarts. After the war, they were all invited to finish their education and to take their N.E.W.T. Hermione naturally accepted the offer, while politely decline the House Girl position. While Draco was among the few Slytherin who were obliged to attend the re-educational program by the Ministry. The tutoring rumour was right, Hermione was often seen tutored Draco outside their classes. The other gossips, though some were true, often exaggerated. Like, that they were dating. They were indeed rather chummy indeed, but their trips to the Muggles side of the world were platonic between friends. And certainly Hermione dated the Head Boy Theo Nott at the time and until now, actually, where they were in the on-again-off-again relationship that most of the time left Draco frustrated.</p>
<p>After the war, the some of the Pureblood families with old money were stripped off their wealth because of their allegiance to Voldemort. They have to ‘start all over again’ even though their fortune were somewhat still bigger than the common people. Including Draco, who was struggling financially as Malfoy was one of the families that have to pay for war reparation and fines on top of that. He lived at the Hermione’s flat for free and gaining money from running her business. The second year after the war, there was a big gala to honour the fallen and to formally award the war hero. She got her War Hero reward along with monthly war pension that she used to pay the loan to buy her flat. And the shop bellow.</p>
<p>While Hermione, she successfully ‘fix’ her parent’s memory with the help of St. Mungos Memory Healer, Healer Abrnee and dr. Whitehall, a doctor who was also a wizard. However her parents decided to stay in Australia. Her encounter with wizard-doctor though, inspired her to pursue her dream to study in University. With her parent’s blessing, she took the gap year to prepare her test for education certification so that she could apply to study Law and Politics in proper University.</p>
<p>“Please, Malfoy, we did argue when bought the new paint. I remembered you asked for certain shade of white. You still hold it against me for getting ‘the wrong one’,” she put the quote in the air.</p>
<p>“Well don’t blame me for your limited knowledge of colour, Granger. How on earth a person who claimed to be from the Muggle world didn’t know the difference between the old lace and the antique white.” </p>
<p>“Not everyone is as ostentatious as you, Malf. I still remember you said ‘I had to had this’ while pointing at a pair of ugly overprice snake skin shoes in hideous colour.”</p>
<p>“Ugly? Really, Hermione? The pair were fine dress shoes. No, they were designed to impress and in perfect shade of green.”</p>
<p>“Fine dress shoes, you say? Elongated square toe shoes, Malfoy. Just eww. I’m glad you broke. I don’t want to walk together with a snob in ridiculous shoes. And don’t let me start with the socks.”</p>
<p>“Now, now, expensive is a relative concept. They’re comfortable with these cushions inside so I can walk on them the whole day. Snake skin is pretty durable, too, you know.”</p>
<p>“I checked the label, you bastard. It was almost the price of all our book collections combine.”</p>
<p>“Noted. But I won’t apologise, Granger. I like the shoes and will buy them someday.”</p>
<p>“What happened to your current one? I think your dragon hide shoes are fine. And proper Oxford.”</p>
<p>“I wear them since Hogwarts!” he whined.</p>
<p>“So? That what the rest of us do.”</p>
<p>“No. I know at least one person who don't. It's you,” he said pointing at her new flat shoes. “I just have one pair. That, and just another pair, actually, the sporty one with the stupid white three ridiculous stripes we bought at the Muggle shop per your insistence.”</p>
<p>“Those are nice pairs, Draco, I promise. And they’re more than enough, at least for now. Set your priority!”</p>
<p>“Yes, Mum.”</p>
<p>“Ugh, don’t call me that,” she grimaced. “I hate that she always come unannounced, flailing around my shop like she owns it. Only to pester you about how the daughters of her socialite friends are ‘beautiful and available’ making them sounded like prostitutes who you can call anytime.”</p>
<p>“Oh, come on, Mi. At least she brought us brownies this time.”</p>
<p>“I forgive her this time, solely because of the brownies.”</p>
<p>“Funny, because I don’t remember your boyfriend ever bring us anything nice,” he dramatically put his finger at his temple, “sorry, that's not accurate. He never bring anything full stop.”</p>
<p>“Oh… Your attempt to free load on Theo is dully noted, Draco.”</p>
<p>“Oh please, I just –” </p>
<p>“I’ll notify him some time.”</p>
<p>“How long have you been with Nott this time?”</p>
<p>“Not sure. Twooo… months?” she shrugged, “And why the emphasis on ‘this time’, you git?”</p>
<p>“We both know you and him won’t last until next month. Did he really buy that antique shop round the corner, by the way?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Said he’s talented with trading. Just in the market for two weeks, that shop. He bought it with all the antiques.”</p>
<p>“I thought he’s a curse breaker.”</p>
<p>“He still is. Do the nine to five and still manage the business afterward. What a lovely money he’d make. Not that he’d need to. You know exactly his non-involvement to the Vold-squad made him one of the riches bachelor in the country. He do these for passion. How inspirational.”</p>
<p>“Thanks very much, because I always need to be reminded that I’m here at your mercy. You’re my landlord AND my employer. Fantastic.”</p>
<p>“Oh Draco, I’m sorry… not to offend you but that’s exactly what I’m trying to say.”</p>
<p>“Ugh Whatever. By the way, what’s with that open hour?”</p>
<p>“Part of promotion, I guess. ‘we open only at night, you plebs, come and see’ kind of promotion. I said to him it was ridiculous when he told me the first time. Fortunately, he didn’t listen to my opinion because then, it works. That what makes his shop kind of quirky, I guess, so well-suited with the shop image.”</p>
<p>“Would we try that sometimes?”</p>
<p>“Sure, so that you can run along all day chasing knickers.”</p>
<p>“Come on, you know it’s the opposite.”</p>
<p>“Yeah… I still don't understand, though.”</p>
<p>“Rude.”</p>
<p>“Not sorry,” she smiled. “By the way, don’t wait for me. I’ll be late.”</p>
<p>“Date with Nott?”</p>
<p>“Nope. Why the tone, though? You almost sound like Harry, you know.”</p>
<p>“Granger, no!”</p>
<p>“Oh, Malfoy … Just if you could see yourself right now. Right. Off to go!”</p>
<p>“Ah, ah! You’ll be late cause?”</p>
<p>“Library, Mum.”</p>
<p>“Don’t work yourself too hard, Sweetheart.”</p>
<p>“Eww… stop it Malf, you sound awfully like your Mum now. Bye.”</p>
