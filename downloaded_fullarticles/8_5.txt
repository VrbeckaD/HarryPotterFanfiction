    <p>3rd of September 1999</p><p>It was around noon when the unconscious woman suddenly appeared in the middle of Diagon Alley, right in front of Fortescue’s ice cream shop. Nobody had seen, were she came from and later people swore, that the young woman suddenly appeared in some kind of blue light, when she materialized from thin air. But as such a form of magical transport was totally unheard of, the authorities put it off and decided to ask the woman instead, as soon as she regained consciousness. Nobody could say though, how long that would take, as she seemed to be in very bad shape. And so she was transported to St. Mungos immediately and placed in a private ward where she would be kept, as long as her identity and therefore the fact if she was in some way dangerous remained unknown. Apart from some old scars on her body, the stranger bled from several curse wounds and there were burns and wounds on her body, where it was simply impossible to tell the origin. Where could she have gained such injuries in such peaceful times as these? Who was this bushy-haired woman anyway? Did she travel to wizarding Britain from abroad? Or did she work with dragons or other dangerous creatures? Nobody seemed to know the answers and so the authorities and the hospital staff would have to wait until the stranger finally woke up. But how long that would take, nobody could tell.</p><p>++++++++</p><p>5th of September 1999</p><p>Hermione awoke with a pounding headache and a soreness in her limbs, that reminded her of the days she had spent at shell cottage after being tortured by Bellatrix Lestrange. Had she been tortured again? And if so by whom? The Dark Lord was dead for some time now and as far as she knew, all his marked followers were out of the picture as well. Did she stumble into some kind of accident? The last thing she remembered was visiting George after the festivities for the end of the battle of Hogwarts and then… nothing. That was … unsettling.<br/>
She opened her eyes only to be overwhelmed by the bright light that fell into her room and she closed them again with a pained groan. But the noise must have been enough to alert whoever was in the room with her.<br/>
“Ah, you’re awake, Miss. Very good,” a foreign voice greeted her politely and she nodded, before blinking her eyes open again. The room was still too bright, but at least she was now able to make out her surroundings. It appeared she was in some kind of hospital, as her bed definitely looked like a hospital bed and the walls and the beddings were all in a pristine white. But the tell-tale sign was the beautiful platin haired woman in green healer robes that walked towards her with a polite smile on her lips. “How do you feel, Miss…. Ah…” The woman smiled an apologizing smile. ”I’m sorry but nobody could tell us your name. Would you mind helping us out here?”<br/>
Hermione nodded confusedly. Nobody could identify her? Not that she minded, but that was odd. After the end of the war, she had been stalked by the press for months and it didn’t take long until she was as famous as Harry Potter himself. Was she in such bad shape that nobody had recognized her? "My name is Hermione Granger," she said politely and waited for a gasp or any other sign of recognition, but nothing happened. The healer just nodded at her politely and noted something on a scroll that floated next to her in the air.<br/>
“Alright Miss Granger. Now, how do you feel?”<br/>
Hermione paused and took a moment to think about the question before she answered: "Quite frankly, I feel terrible. Everything is sore and I have a pounding headache. My limbs feel like they are aflame, probably the Cruciatus curse, but I am not sure as I don’t exactly remember what happened to me.”<br/>
The healer looked at her with wide eyes and hastily took some more notes. “That is bad… you say you can’t remember what happened?”<br/>
Hermione shook her head confusedly. “Sadly no. The last thing I remember was visiting George… that is George Weasley.”<br/>
“The shop owner?”<br/>
“That’s the one,” Hermione confirmed. “I can’t even remember leaving his place again. Maybe there was an attack or something? Is he here, too?”<br/>
The healer shook her head. “I have no knowledge of an attack or anything similar. Maybe it would help if we called him? He can probably help us to find out, what happened to you.”<br/>
Hermione released a relieved sigh. Calling George was a great idea. Even if he didn’t know what happened to her, she would still be glad to see him again and make sure, he was alright. The last time she saw him, he was anything but in good shape. “That would be great. Could you also call my friends Ron Weasley and Harry Potter?” Hermione waited for a gasp when saying Harry’s name but she was disappointed again.<br/>
"That shouldn't be a problem, Miss. I'll send a message as soon as I'm finished with your examination," the green-robed woman replied in a polite tone.<br/>
“Thank you, healer. I can imagine they’re quite worried by now. I don’t even know how long they haven’t seen me. Could you tell me what date it is, please?"<br/>
“It’s Sunday the 5th of September,” the woman said politely and lifted her wand for some more analyses. Hermione couldn’t help but swear, before looking at the healer with wide eyes. That was bad, really bad, because it meant that she was missing the last four months of her memory.</p><p>+++++++++</p><p>24th of August 1998</p><p>It was never a question for Hermione if she would return to Hogwarts to finish her education there. Going back was her kind of reward for fighting along Harry and finally finishing off the Dark Lord and his band of racist followers. Hermione loved studying and learning new things and she loved Hogwarts. The place had become something like a second home to her, a home where she could embrace her true nature as a witch and bookworm. Harry and Ron hadn't really understood, as education was never at the forefront of their minds, but they didn’t begrudge her the decision either.<br/>
“We’ll just join the Auror trainee program from the ministry,” Ron had explained while holding her hand in the backyard of the Burrow. “That’s what Harry and I wanted to do anyway. And if the ministry’s falling over their feet to appraise the war heroes by letting us join without our NEWTS - all the better.” With that, he stuffed one of his mum's homemade pastries into his mouth and grinned happily. Hermione sighed. She wasn’t surprised by his decision of course, but she still wished, that her friends would return to Hogwarts together with her if only to have at least one normal, carefree year together.<br/>
“I still wish you would come back with me,” she finally admitted and pressed his hand to her cheek. “I know it’s selfish, but we’ll barely be able to see each other once I’m back at school. And I know you’re no big writer so I’m not expecting more than an owl per week.”<br/>
He grinned sheepishly at her. “I’ll come to Hogsmead, Mione. We could even go to Madame Puddifoots if you like.”<br/>
Hermione couldn’t help but snort. “And then what? We drink punsh and eat pink sugary cakes? Can you see us doing this?”<br/>
He laughed before kissing her happily on the mouth. “Probably not. That isn’t really us, huh?"<br/>
Hermione shook her head with a gentle smile. "Not really, no."  She also knew the other reason why Ron wouldn’t come back with her. The sad truth was that his family simply needed him. George had taken the death of his twin very badly and as days went by, he got worse and worse. There was nothing left of the fearless prankster, the boy had been a year ago. Not even losing his ear had dampened his mood and he had still been able to joke about the situation. But losing his twin had broken George and Hermione wasn’t sure if her friend would ever be the same again. But he wasn’t the only one that was affected by the family tragedy.<br/>
"How's your mum today?" Hermione asked and gently stroked her boyfriend's hand with her thumb. Since the end of the battle, Hermione had barely seen the witch that hid herself inside her home and fretted over her children even more, than she had before.<br/>
Ron shrugged helplessly. "She isn't well. None of us really is since… Fred. But with her, it's even worse. You know, she's got the feeling, that it's always our family paying the price. In the first war, there were her uncles. I don't know if you've heard about them. They were twins and her younger brothers. Fabian and Gideon were in the Order too and they were fearless, a bit like Fred and George I guess. It took five Death Eaters to take them down but in the end, it was a bloodbath. She never talked about them very much, but the last year and what happened to Fred must have brought the memories back."<br/>
Hermione nodded sadly. “Is there anything I can do, Ron? I want to help, you know? Your parents have always been good to me. They have taken me in like one of their own. I want to give something back to them, to all of you, in fact, you know?”<br/>
“I know, Mione,” her boyfriend replied and pulled her into his strong arms. “But there’s not much you can do at the moment. Mum just needs time. And she needs all her children with her to realize, that none of us is going anywhere.” He kissed her again. This time it was a gentle, slow kiss and Hermione enjoyed the soft feeling of his lips on her mouth.<br/>
"Alright, Ron," she finally said after she rested her head on his shoulder. "But let me know if anything comes up and you need my help. No matter what, okay?”<br/>
He grinned, before playing with her hair. “Don’t worry, Mione. Everything will be fine. You just go back to Hogwarts and enjoy yourself in the library. The year will be over faster than you think and by the time you’re back…”<br/>
He left the sentence unfinished, but her fantasy readily supplied her with possible endings. And she liked them all.</p><p>++++++++</p><p>6th of September 1999</p><p>Hermione waited all of the day for Harry and Ron to visit her, but nobody came. When evening finally arrived, her head had found enough excuses for them, why they couldn't see her right away and she had resigned herself that she would have to wait until the following day. But morning came and instead of Harry and Ron another unexpected guest came into her room.<br/>
“Malfoy?” she asked in a voice that couldn’t conceal her shock. “I’m sorry, but what are you doing here?”<br/>
The pale blond wizard looked at her with curious grey eyes. “Healer Malfoy, if you please,” he replied politely and pointed on his green healer robes. “I’ve been assigned your case, Miss Granger. May I ask how you are aware of my name?”<br/>
Hermione looked at him with open mouth and wide, confused eyes. “Excuse me?” she said before shaking her head. “Well, I’m sorry… I wasn’t aware you’re a healer now.”<br/>
He nodded with furrowed brows, before noting something on the scroll, floating at his right side. “That’s alright, Miss Granger. But excuse my curiosity; I get the impression that you somehow know me. Have we met before?”<br/>
Hermione couldn’t help but furrow her brows. “We… we went to school together. Don’t you remember? I was in Gryffindor, you were in Slytherin. We weren’t exactly friends, but…”<br/>
The man interrupted her with a rise of his hand. “Actually I was in Ravenclaw, Miss. All Malfoys before me were in Slytherin, but I was the first one breaking that tradition." At that, he puffed his chest proudly. But Hermione just gaped at him and shook her head confusedly.<br/>
“I… I don’t understand…” she said and kept shaking her head. But he cast her a calming smile, before making another note.<br/>
“No, but I start to get, why I was assigned your case. It’s truly an interesting one. You see, I am specialized in the healing of mental issues. That’s why I wondered about being assigned your case as there seemed to be mostly curse damage and other issues. But now I see…”<br/>
Hermione gaped at him. “You think I’m crazy?” she asked and looked at him with wide eyes. But he shook his head and cast her an empathic smile.<br/>
"No, Miss Granger. It's obvious, that some terrible things must have happened to you. You see, yesterday the healer that was assigned to your care looked up your name after you filled her in about your identity. But here’s the thing. There was only one Hermione Granger known to wizarding history. And she died in 1981."<br/>
Hermione didn’t say anything after that and instead kept staring into space. It wasn’t possible. Because she definitely hasn’t died as a toddler. But why didn't Malfoy remember her, then? Hermione definitely remembered him and she was sure, that he hadn't been a Ravenclaw. There was no way she would mix up something like that. But the longer she thought about it, the more doubtful she got. Because even if the man that was her healer now looked like the Draco Malfoy she had known, he definitely didn’t behave like him. The man was all politeness and smiles and there was nothing left of the arrogant prick, she had known from her school days. And that realization scared her more than the knowledge that she couldn’t remember the last four months of her life. Losing memories was bad, but having the wrong ones was downright scary. But were they really wrong? Or was she just trapped in some kind of nightmare?<br/>
Her thoughts were interrupted by a knock on the door and before she could reply, Ron and Harry peeked through the door.<br/>
"Hey Malfoy," Harry greeted the blond-haired healer that was still in the room with her. The blond wizard nodded politely in their direction any waved them in. “Potter! Weasley! Great that you could arrange to come over. Do come in!”<br/>
Both of the boys smiled, before stepping into the room and shaking Malfoys hand. It was the most bizarre thing to watch. There was not a bit of animosity between them and it looked more, like the three of them had gotten on quite nicely in school, which they definitely hadn’t.<br/>
"We got your owl yesterday and came as soon as we could," Ron said and looked towards her doubtingly. "You said this was about a patient of yours. Is it about her?" Ron motioned his head towards Hermione but didn't even bother to look in her direction. Malfoy nodded.<br/>
“Yeah, this is Hermione Granger, guys.” Malfoy turned towards her and smiled politely. “She was found in the middle of Diagon Alley with some very serious injuries. She doesn't know what happened to her, as she is lacking her memory of the last four months."<br/>
Hermione nodded miserably and studied her friend’s reaction. Ron looked almost bored and studied the room. It almost seemed he was avoiding to look at her. And Hermione realized that it hurt. Merlin, Ron was her boyfriend! They had been through hell and back together. So why didn't he remember her? Harry, on the other hand, looked worried and studied her with something like pity. And for Hermione that wasn’t much better. Never in her life had she pitied him, not when she learned about his miserable childhood, not at Sirius’ death or when she learned about the prophecy. She had been there for him, supported him, helped him, held him – but never pitied. She had the feeling that he would have hated it because Hermione most certainly did.<br/>
“That’s horrible, Miss Granger,” Harry finally replied, before turning back to Malfoy. “Do you want me to investigate the case?”<br/>
Malfoy shook his head with a smile. “No Potter, don’t worry. I haven’t called you here in your function as an Auror. You see, the thing is: Miss Granger has asked for you to come. She said you’re friends.”<br/>
Hermione swallowed because she anticipated their reaction before one of them even said a word.<br/>
“She what?” Ron said bewildered and looked at her for the first time. His eyes raked over her body, her wild hair and her white nightgown, before looking away again. “I most certainly don’t know her. You’re sure she’s not some kind of crazy fangirl? You know, since I’ve made keeper for Puddlemere I’ve had some of those.” It was like receiving a blow in the chest and Hermione couldn’t help but gasp, before staring wide-eyed at the three of them. Harry looked back at her calmly and studied her with green, sad eyes.<br/>
“I’m sorry, Miss… Granger. But I am quite sure we have never met before. Where do you think we met again?”<br/>
She swallowed heavily. "At school…" she said silently before staring in her lap and clasping her blanked. "But I see I've been mistaken. I'm sorry I've bothered you." She took a deep breath in the hope that it would help her to calm down before she forced herself to look back at him again. “Just one more thing, please. Mr Potter…,” it hurt calling him by his family name, but she felt it was more appropriate that way. “Do you by any chance have a scar on your forehead?”<br/>
He saw Harry furrow his brows confusedly, before carefully stepping closer to her. It looked like he was approaching some kind of wild animal and Hermione wondered, what he must think of her. Finally, he stopped right next to her bed, before looking her into the eyes. "I don't have a scar, Miss Granger. Do you want to take a look, to convince yourself?"<br/>
Hermione swallowed but nodded. “That would be very much appreciated, yes. I’m sorry if this sounds barmy to you, but the Harry Potter I knew, most definitely had a scar.”<br/>
Her former friend smiled at her, before lowering himself down to her and brushing his hair from his face. And he hadn't lied. There wasn't the tiniest scar in sight or any other mark for that matter. She blinked confusedly.<br/>
“There’s no scar,” she murmured absentmindedly and stared at the three of them. Malfoy studied her with something like academic interest, whereas Ron just looked somewhat annoyed. Hermione shook her head confusedly, before sinking into deep thoughts. She didn't even register when the boys said their hasty goodbyes and left the room with Malfoy in tow. Because she seriously didn’t care. She felt like Alice in Wonderland after falling down the rabbit hole. The question was now: how did she find her way back again?</p>
