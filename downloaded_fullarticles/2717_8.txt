  <strong>Chapter 1</strong>
</p><p>It was just another summer day for the Elementals. Samantha, Bethany, and Jimmy were training, just like they have been for the majority of the summer. Chelsea and Amelia were walking back from the grocery store. Since the others were training more than them, they have been running most of the errands.</p><p>"I still can't believe that we have these abilities," Chelsea said.</p><p>"I know," Amelia replied. "We're getting stronger every day though, just like Grandpa said."</p><p>"Yeah, I mean I can't feel movement from a far enough distance yet, but I can still feel every movement you guys make," Chelsea stated.</p><p>"Doesn't it ever get too much for you?" Amelia asked.</p><p>"Sometimes," Chelsea admitted. "Grandpa's training is helping a lot though. What about the super senses; doesn't the hearing ever get too much for you?"</p><p>"At first it was, " Amelia declared. "Grandpa's training has helped me too though. I'm learning to focus on where I want to hear and see, and what I want to taste, feel, and smell. I think I see Samantha coming this way right now."</p><p>On cue Samantha fell on the ground, rolling a few feet in front of them before getting right back on her feet and speeding back toward the beach.</p><p>"Man she's fast," Chelsea stated.</p><p>"How long do you think they've been going at it?" Amelia asked.</p><p>"I think an hour, that's how long we were gone," Chelsea replied.</p><p>"Was it?" Amelia asked.</p><p>"Yeah, " Chelsea said. "We spent like ten minutes arguing over what kind of meat to get, remember?"</p><p>"Oh, come on that's not fair," Amelia said. "You know I don't eat meat."</p><p>"Well the rest of us are not going to just stop eating meat," Chelsea replied.</p><p>"Well you should," Amelia interjected. "Samantha's a damn carnivore!"</p><p>"I'm not saying she isn't," Chelsea said defensively. "She'll never be a vegetarian though."</p><p>Once Amelia and Chelsea got back to the house they unpacked the groceries and went outside where the others were.</p><p>"Haven't you guys had enough?" Chelsea asked.</p><p>"No, we've never had enough," Bethany stated. "You should know that by now."</p><p>Chelsea and Amelia just rolled their eyes.</p><p>"Oh yeah, while you guys were gone we got a letter from Ron," Samantha said.</p><p>"What did it say?" Amelia asked.</p><p>"It said that he wants us to meet him at the Burrow tomorrow morning," Jimmy declared. "His dad's got some sort of surprise for all of us."</p><p>"You know, I hate surprises," Samantha replied.</p><p>"It's already late in the afternoon," Bethany stated. Plus, we're all out of floo powder. It will take us longer to get to the Burrow without magic."</p><p>"She's right. We should probably get going now." Amelia replied.</p><p>"Alright, come on, we have to pack up and tell the familiars," Samantha said.</p>
