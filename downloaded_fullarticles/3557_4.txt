<p align="center">Make it Double</p>
<p>The sounds of laughter and whizzing, wiring, clacking filtered in through the syrupy distance of sleep. Kim opened her eyes to see the foggy light of morning spilling through the half draped windows. <em>Fred really needs to get thicker curtains,</em> she groaned internally, rolling over and stuffing her face in the pillow. But the damage was already done; she was awake and, judging by the cool sheets and the lack of depression in the mattress beside her, Fred had already gotten up.</p>
<p>She pulled herself upright after morning the end of sleep and stretched. She scanned the small room with its minimal floor space and lush, bright chartreuse carpet that didn’t match a thing. There were still a few boxes from where Fred had yet to fully unpack, clothes most likely, and odds and ends. But the majority of his things were fairly organized already, for having only been moved into the space for a month and a half.</p>
<p>Kim padded to the door, the sounds from the joke shop beneath still audible through the thin floor. There was an explosion of laughter and the sound of something tearing. She opened the door a creek to peek out into the shared kitchen and living room area. It was empty, thankfully, because lying at the foot of the couch was her trunk with all her clothes. She scurried across the linoleum and onto the carpet of the living room, opening her trunk hurriedly. She was only wearing Fred’s T-shirt at the moment, and a pair of underwear. She got changed hastily and went into the ice box, digging around for something to eat. There wasn’t much, and if she was lousy cook, she was even <em>worse </em>when dealing with magical appliances. She was waiting for the day that wizard’s caught on to the invention of the microwave.</p>
<p>Deciding nothing was going to materialize itself in the kitchen she turned to face the empty living room with a sigh. It was a simple and small abode. The living room was open and rectangular, with orangey wooden paneling along the back wall, meeting with a faded yellow paint on the other walls. The furniture was plain, except for the throw pillows which George had found in a thrift store somewhere in Diagon Ally. They were knitted and made of a brilliant array of purples, greens, and yellows, forming a knotted pattern that was mostly indistinguishable. The curtains were the same thin ones that let all the light in, though now that she was awake, she quite appreciated how sunny they made everything.</p>
<p>With another sigh she headed out the door to the left side of the living room. It led into a short hallway with nothing but a storage closet and a broom stand. The stairs led down to the ample noise of the shop. Kim stepped into the large first floor, decked from top to bottom with joke supplies. Fred and George had made fast work of the place, not wasting any time to move in. Each corner of the shop was filled with odds and ends of a light hearted nature. Though, they <em>did </em>sometimes tend to go too far with some of their products, like the Belching Blood Burners that made the victim vomit blood for twenty minutes strait which would then ignite the moment it had left one’s mouth, starting a chemical fire that was near to impossible to put out. Luckily they had her to tell them when their ‘joke’ items were more likely to land them in a law suit then pulling in laughs and cash.</p>
<p>“Awake, sleepy head,” came Fred’s familiar, chiding voice as he hopped up the stairs to the balcony where she stood.</p>
<p>She smiled and kissed him, saying, “Busy for this hour.” The shop was pocked with gaggles of young shoppers testing out new products, laughing and pointing at the many odd displays.</p>
<p>“Bus load of vacationers,” Fred said, nodding. “They’re on their way to the Slimy Nickers concert.”</p>
<p>Kim made a face, unaware of this musical group, and not all that interested in finding out what they sang about. He sighed and looked her up and down.</p>
<p>“You’re already dressed,” he said. “You’re not leaving now are you?”</p>
<p>“Not <em>now </em>now. But I have to leave today.”</p>
<p>“You only just <em>got </em>here!”</p>
<p>Kim had arrived at Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes only two days ago, and she couldn’t deny that leaving already was torture. Being there with Fred and George, with nothing to fill their days but lounging around, jokes in the joke shop, pranking customers with products they would later <em>buy </em>after seeing them demonstrated so expertly. They ate out on Diagon Ally and walked the streets at evening, seeing the sights and just enjoying one another’s company. It was better than Kim ever could have imagined. But she <em>had </em>to see her mother and sister. She couldn’t just ignore them forever, and she’d feel guilty if she said she wanted to, no matter how tempting the offer might be. </p>
<p>“I know,” Kim said, wrapping her arms around Fred’s neck and peering at him where he stood, at eye level due to his lower position on the stars. “And I don’t want to leave, but you know I have to.”</p>
<p>“I know, I know,” he was already saying, looking away from her and over the shop.</p>
<p>“And…” She was hoping he would finish her sentence for him, but he didn’t seem eager. “And you need to come and meet my mother.”</p>
<p>“Okay, let’s do it!” he said, but Kim could already tell from the high tenor in his voice that there was more he wanted to add on. “I just… well I feel bad leaving George behind,” he added matter-of-factly, but he was faking it.</p>
<p>“Oh, uh-hu,” she taunted with a smile. “You just don’t want to be stuck with me and my family all by yourself.”</p>
<p>“What? No, look, it’s not like I wouldn’t love to be with you alone,” he said, stepping up the stair so they were on level ground, lifting his eye level to well above hers. “But-…”</p>
<p>“But you don’t want to be alone with me <em>without George</em>,” she added, still mocking him with a smile as his negotiation face cracked and turned slightly guilty. She laughed and said, “Look, I don’t care. Bring him. Just, who’s going to watch the shop?”</p>
<p>Fred shrugged. “Verity can watch it,” he said, referring to their only employee that they’d hired a few weeks ago. She graduated in Fred and George’s year, though they hadn’t known her at all until she’d applied for their job opening at the beginning to the summer.</p>
<p>“Isn’t it a bit soon?” Kim said, and then George bounded up behind her suddenly.</p>
<p>“Too soon? Don’t tell me you’re getting married,” he said jokingly. Kim turned blankly to face him, and Fred didn’t say anything either, though Kim was sure it was quite by accident. George didn’t know this, of course, so his eyes widened with terror, taking their silence as confirmation. “Oh, great Merlin’s- you’re not—”</p>
<p>Kim’s snickering cut him off, Fred’s smile simultaneously hinting to him that he’d gotten the wrong idea.</p>
<p>“No,” Kim finally said. “We were talking about leaving Verity behind to watch the shop while you two come with me to meet my Mom.”</p>
<p>“Oh,” George said with a relief. “Well… I’m always up for an adventure, when do we leave?”</p>
<p>Kim chuckled. “You’re not worried about leaving her in charge?” Kim asked them both.</p>
<p>They looked at each other and made a face with their mouths turned down dramatically as they both said, “Nah,” and shrugged.</p>
<p>“Well, all right. Guess we can leave anytime then.”</p>
<p>“Oh! But before we go,” George said, pointing at Fred, “we should have her test the Lush-Your-Locks stuff!”</p>
<p>“What?” Kim said flatly.</p>
<p>“Oh! You’re right!”</p>
<p>“What <em>now</em>?” she moaned.</p>
<p>“Come on, we need your opinion on it, being a girl and all,” Fred said, leading her down the stairs and into the shop. They weaved through a group of laughing boys before they pushed through the swinging door into the back room. There was a small sitting area beside a desk with a filing cabinet. Fred, however, was leading her to the wide washing basin and the faucet across the room while George dove into a box in the storage room.</p>
<p>“What is this exactly?” Kim asked, arms crossed over her chest.</p>
<p>“Hair products, to get girls interested in the shop.”</p>
<p>“You know, there are plenty of girls that worry about other things <em>besides </em>hair and love potion.”</p>
<p>“I know,” Fred said, putting his hand on the small of her back. “But there not all like you, love,” he said with a wink, making Kim smile despite herself.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” George agreed as he reemerged from the storage room. “Not all girls like digging around in the dirt for fairy eggs and centaur droppings and what not.”</p>
<p>“I have <em>never </em>dug in the dirt for- well, not for centaur droppings, and the fairy eggs were because of <em>you</em>!” But they were both making sounds of joy, as if they’d caught her red handed. She rolled her eyes and laughed at them.</p>
<p>“Alright, put this on your head,” George said, handing her a velvet mahogany hat. It was very long and round, fully covering her entire scalp and leaving a helmet shaped hole for her face.</p>
<p>“Is this supposed to be a hat?” she asked, putting it on.</p>
<p>“Nope.” They both said, and their peevish smiles were making Kim nervous. She probably should have inspected this more closely before putting it on her head.</p>
<p>“What is it supposed to do?” she asked cautiously.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry,” Fred assured her, “we can undo it if you don’t like it.”</p>
<p>“Don’t like what?” she demanded, but then she felt a tingling sensation on her head. The hat was seemingly vibrating her head just slightly, sending numbing little tingles through her scalp. She looked down at her collar to where a few strands of her hair were visible, and it was <em>changing color</em>.</p>
<p>“What!” She grabbed the ends of her hair and watched as the blond vanished behind a very dark reddish brown. “Holly hell,” she breathed.</p>
<p>“It works!” said George.</p>
<p>Then suddenly the hat made a sneezing sound, and a sticky substance was splattered all down Kim’s back. She made a face of disgust and looked over her shoulder.</p>
<p>“Oh…” Fred said unfortunately. There was a great reddish-brown blob of slime dripping down her shirt. “Well, that wasn’t intended.”</p>
<p>“No, you think!”</p>
<p>“I really thought we’d worked out that bug,” George said, frowning and putting his hand on his mouth as if in thought, shaking his head.</p>
<p>“We better get this off, quick,” Fed said, lifting the hat from Kim’s head and setting it hastily into the water basin.</p>
<p>“Take off the shirt, quick, quick,” Fred urged.</p>
<p>“What? Why?” she said, not moving to take anything off.</p>
<p>“It’s going to get on everything!”</p>
<p>“I thought you said you could get it off!”</p>
<p>“On your hair,” George explained, making a pained face. “On other things…”</p>
<p>“Not so much,” Fred said, mimicking his brother’s expression. She growled in aggravation.</p>
<p>“Well, go get me another shirt. And a towel or something!” Kim snapped.</p>
<p>“Right,” Fred said, and dashed from the room.</p>
<p>“Turn around,” Kim muttered as she attempted to take the ends of her shirt in such a way that the sludge wouldn’t touch her skin. After much wriggling she managed to remove the shirt with only smearing a small amount on her shoulder. She dumped the shirt in the basin, assuming it was gone to her forever. <em>Ah well, </em>she thought, staring at it, <em>such is the price of company like Fred and George. </em></p>
<p>“What is that?” George said blankly. There was something unexpectedly solemn in his tone that made Kim look over her shoulder at him. His eyes were boring into her back, and after a moment she realized he was staring at the ugly rippling gashes of mangled skin that formed the scars across her spine, from where Professor Umbridge had demonstrated her reign of terror. Kim turned, feeling exposed, so her front faced George, and then realized it wasn’t any better, wrapping her arms around her chest. He turned his head so he was staring of at nothing and swallowed.</p>
<p>“Did you always have those?” he continued. Kim hesitated. Fred of course already knew about the marks. He had found out soon after she’d arrived in much the same way George was finding out, though in a much more <em>intimate </em>setting. Nothing kills a mood like having to explain to your boyfriend why your back is a mutilated mess. So she had been forced to tell Fred the whole story, but George was still completely unaware of just how dark things got after he and Fred left.</p>
<p>“No…” she finally said, and there was more silence. Kim could see the tenseness in George’s features from his profile. “It was Umbridge.” His eyes went wide.</p>
<p>“Sh- she… she did that to you?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. 15 lashes, though I don’t think she got through them all.”</p>
<p>George turned the rest of the way away from Kim, folding his arms and pressing a fist against his lips. He looked angrier then Kim had seen him in a long time. Perhaps since Malfoy had slung slurs about his mother, or the time Kim had been attacked by Miles Bletchley in her fourth year.</p>
<p>“What happened?” he finally asked, still staring at the wall his back turned to Kim. “What were you being punished for?” He said it like it was a question he already knew the answer to.</p>
<p>In this matter, Kim hadn’t given Fred the whole truth. She’d told him it was for hexing Malfoy, which was partially true. For some reason she felt a sudden urge to tell George the rest of it.</p>
<p>“For not giving you two up. It was the same day you both escaped…She wanted me to confess that you were the ones to set the fireworks,” she said, voice sullen. George tensed and punched the plushy chair, making Kim jump. “Don’t tell Fred, please. He thinks it was for hexing Malfoy. I don’t want him to…” But Kim couldn’t finish because she suddenly felt guilty for telling George either. It surprised her that he was clearly as effected by this news as Fred would be.</p>
<p>“We never should have left you,” he said. Kim wasn’t exactly sure what to say right away. She hadn’t been prepared for him to act this way.</p>
<p>“You didn’t have a choice… I wasn’t going to come with you.”</p>
<p>“But we could have stayed.”</p>
<p>“I-I couldn’t ask you guys to do that, I couldn’t ask Fred to—”</p>
<p>“But you shouldn’t’ve had to,” George said, turning to face Kim with his fists balled on either side of him. Kim stared at him, too shocked by the unrest in his tone to even be embarrassed for her half nakedness. His eyes searched hers, and in them Kim saw things she didn’t expect and yet somehow remembered... Longing, desperation, and as he bit down hard, his jaw tensing, twinges of pain as if something was hurting him. As if <em>she </em>was hurting him.</p>
<p>Fred walked in then, brandishing Kim’s new shirt and a towel in hand.</p>
<p>“Uh…” he said, catching the intense looks the two were sharing before George broke away and turned to look at the wall. “I got the-… stuff, is everything… never mind,” he said, shaking his head as the moment passed. He handed Kim the shirt, which she took, feeling a bit shaken and confused.</p>
<p>“Okay, magic can’t get this stuff off, so,” Fred said, wiping her shoulder free of the gunk with the towel. It left behind a mahogany stain on her shoulder. Kim glowered at it and then shifted her heated gaze to Fred.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry! We’ll get it off, it’ll just take… some figuring… right George?” Fred asked, as if feeling the sucking void of George’s absence already, even though he stood in the same room but was merely not present. Not himself.</p>
<p>“Right,” George agreed, but it had none of the proper vigor to it. Still he turned back to face them, seeming as though he wanted to pull himself from his thoughts. Kim put her new shirt on as Fred eyed George with a bent brow.</p>
<p>“Anyway,” he said, “sorry about your shirt.”</p>
<p>“It’s fine, just trash it,” Kim said, tossing the towel into the basin with everything else. “Can we leave soon?” she said abruptly. “I’m getting hungry and there’s no food in your house.” It was true, but it wasn’t the only reason she felt in a rush to get going. She wanted to be on the move. She wanted things to go back to how they had felt a moment ago, and she was sure that the process of changing scenery would do that.</p>
<p>“Sure,” Fred said, almost managing to sound completely light. “Sure, let’s go get ready.”</p>
<p>They went upstairs and Kim packed the rest of her things. They took their time because with the time difference, it was still early morning in North Carolina. Kim looked in the mirror before they left and examined the dark reddish sheen of her hair. Strix flew over to Kim’s shoulder, also peering at their reflections in the mirror curiously.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, we can undo that, George get the—”</p>
<p>“Well, wait a second,” Kim said, drawing her hands through the lengths of her wavy locks. The dark color made her pale skin seem robust and her eyes gleam.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know… I kind of like it…” Something about the dark shine of it went nicely with her black nails. She’d stopped with the dark eye liner since the end of the semester, but the black nails she’d decided to keep.</p>
<p>“You like it? Well keep it! It’ll be good to test the fade, it should last you a long time with no lessening in luster and shine!” he said like a salesman. Kim rolled her eyes and batted him away from the mirror, ready to begin gathering her things to leave.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“Well, she’s certainly going to get double what she bargained for,” Kim remarked with a smirk. She was staring at the doorway that would lead her and the twins from her Aunt Brit’s house in England all the way to her mother’s in America.</p>
<p>“Toil and trouble,” Fred said.</p>
<p>“Make it double,” George finished. Kim smiled and reached out her hand to tap the proper pattern on the doorway.</p>
<p>“So that’s it, that’s all you have to do?” Fred said in bewilderment. They didn’t have Bellhop in England, and Kim felt quite special showing them something advanced and new to them.</p>
<p>“That’s it. And viola!” She opened the front door to her aunt’s house, but on the other side was not the outside stoop they’d just come in from. It was a large hallway that didn’t make sense to fit inside the tiny apartment.</p>
<p>“Knock knock,” Kim said, stepping into the hall with Fred and George lugging her things behind her. “We’re here.”</p>
<p>“Oh!” came her mother’s excited voice from in the kitchen. Kim heard her stand and hurry into the hallway, eyes landing on the gathering. The twins stood up from setting down Kim’s luggage, raising to their full height. Her mother’s eyes followed them up, up, up…</p>
<p>“Well… I was only expecting <em>one</em>,” she said with a chuckle that broke into a full laugh as she added, “and here you’ve brought <em>two</em>!”</p>
<p>The twins laughed good naturedly in return, though Kim was sure they were well used to these kinds of jokes by now.</p>
<p>“Yes, yes,” Kim said, moving farther into the house toward her mother and opening her arms for a hug. “Only one of them is my boyfriend though,” she added with a laugh.</p>
<p>“Yeah, well that’s good,” she responded, eyeing the boys as Kim released her. “You’re hair!” She ran her hand down Kim’s locks.</p>
<p>“It’s easy to undo, don’t worry. It’s magic.”</p>
<p>“No, I like it!”</p>
<p>“Oh, well thank you.”</p>
<p>“Fred Weasley,” Fred said, jutting out his hand for her to shake. “Pleased to meet you.”</p>
<p>“Pleased to meet you too,” Mrs. Shimmers said, sounding impressed.</p>
<p>“George Weasley,” he mirrored the moment she had finished shaking Fred’s hand. “Equally pleased to meet you.”</p>
<p>“Well, you two really look exactly alike,” said Mrs. Shimmers.</p>
<p>“You’re looking at the proud owners of Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes. Would you like to try a sample?” Fred asked, a twinkle in his eye.</p>
<p>“Uh, su—”</p>
<p>“Maybe not the best idea,” Kim said, eyeing Fred venomously.</p>
<p>“What? It was just a bit of fun,” he defended as Kim pulled her mother along down the hall and into the kitchen, the twins following.</p>
<p>“Well, what is it?” Mrs. Shimmers asked her daughter.</p>
<p>“Nothing good,” Kim said confidentially from the corner of her mouth.</p>
<p>“She’s always painting us in a bad light,” George said, their charming natures already getting them away with far more than they should be allowed.</p>
<p>“Don’t listen to her,” Fred agreed. “Bit of a stick in the mud, you’re daughter. She never does anything dangerous or puts a single toe out of line.”</p>
<p>Kim snorted at this, though her mother seemed pleasantly convinced. She chuckled like a person who didn’t quite get a joke and said, “Yes… that’s good.”</p>
<p>Kim cleared her throat, not wanting it to become any more obvious that Fred’s little joke was heavily implying Kim was, in reality, the <em>opposite </em>of someone who never puts a single toe out of line. Her mother didn’t know anything about the dangers she’d faced, and she barley understood Kim’s ability to see the future, and Kim intended it to stay that way. If her mother knew even a portion of the true danger that awaited in London, she would certainly never let Kim out of cozy North Carolina again.</p>
<p>By dinner that evening Fred and George had her mother and sister laughing so much Kim knew they were a success, regardless of their mischievousness. Night came too soon, and before long it was time for the twins to return to London.</p>
<p>“Well, now that you know the door code, you can visit me at any time,” Kim reasoned to both of them as she walked them to the door.</p>
<p>“Just, uh… knock first, would you? After the knock code, I mean,” Mrs. Shimmer’s said with a faint grimace. Kim supposed something about having a portal to another country in the middle of her hallway made her slightly uncomfortable, which Kim supposed was understandable.</p>
<p>“Of course,” said Fred. “We can always write before we visit, though seems a bit cruel to the post owl.” Kim’s mother said something in return, but Kim wasn’t listening anymore. She was looking at George who was eyeing her meaningfully.</p>
<p>“Be safe Kim,” he said in a low voice.</p>
<p>“W-wha-… well, yeah, of course…” She didn’t quite understand where this was coming from.</p>
<p>“I mean, with whatever trip you’re taking with Dumbledore,” he explained. Kim had told the both of them about her vision and her vow to help Harry in whatever way she was capable.</p>
<p>“Oh, right…”</p>
<p>“Just be safe. You’ll be with him so…” he said, as if reminding himself. He put his arms around Kim, pulling her tight against his chest as Fred said his last goodbyes to Mrs. Shimmers and turned to join them.</p>
<p>“You will visit, won’t you?” Kim asked, looking from George as he released her to Fred.</p>
<p>“Of course,” Fred said, hugging her next and kissing the top of her head. “Couldn’t stay away for that long. Besides, I like it here. Has an <em>exotic </em>feel to it.”</p>
<p>Kim snorted. Her home was about as exotic as a muggle sitcom. She kissed Fred on the lips and bid them both one last farewell. With the door shut firmly behind them, the silence that rang through the house was loud and lonely feeling. She thought longingly of the day when she could just be with the twins full time and never have to leave.</p>
<p>“Well, they were nice,” her mother said, hands on her hips as she looked down at Kim from farther up the hallway. Kim pulled her gaze from the door.</p>
<p>“Yeah, they are.”</p>
<p>“So wait, which one was your boyfriend?” she asked, frowning in thought. Kim smiled and shook her head. “It was kind of hard to tell… how long have you known these boys?”</p>
<p>“It was hard to tell?” Kim said, voice a little high, almost defensive though she wasn’t quite sure why.</p>
<p>“Well yeah… It’s not a bad thing, I just meant that it seemed… I don’ know, like you’re close with both of them.”</p>
<p>“Well, we <em>have </em>been friends since I started going to Hogwarts… four years ago?” she counted in her head. “Three years. Yeah.”</p>
<p>“Well, it shows… I get the impression that they’re very protective of you,” she said with a knowing look as they went to sit in the kitchen.</p>
<p>“Really?” Kim asked, voice high again. A bashful smile crept up on her face despite herself.</p>
<p>“Yeah. It’s good to think that you’ve had someone looking out for you all this time while you’re away from home,” she said.</p>
<p>Kim let out a breath of air in a sort of laugh. She supposed it was true that Fred and George <em>did </em>look out for her, but if only her mother knew how much more trouble they’d gotten her in by comparison. She sometimes wondered what her life would be like if she had never met them, how much less detention she would’ve had. The idea was unbearably dull.</p>
