</p><p align="center"> o0o0o0o</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center"> </p><p> In the arid and fathomless depths of space, silence reigned.</p><p> </p><p>Never was this more true than in the orbit of the massive world that hung upon the unseen thread of the universe; a crimson tinted warning to all who were brave...or foolish enough to venture towards this distant quadrant.</p><p> </p><p>For it was a dead quandrant; the planet and its surrounding satellites completely devoid of life.</p><p> </p><p>This particular quadrant was considered taboo. A place that even the most hardened criminals fleeing intergalactic justice, would never dare to seek shelter in.</p><p> </p><p>After all, only one being dared to linger around these parts.</p><p> </p><p>And the only chance you had to survive passing through this piece of desolate space, was if you were with <em><strong>him</strong></em>.</p><p> </p><p>Luckily for the approaching vessel, the being on board most certainly was. </p><p> </p><p>The Q-ship lowered its thrusters and adopted cruising speed as it approached the behemoth space vessel orbiting the ruined planet. </p><p> </p><p>The massive warship known as the Sanctuary II was universally known and feared as the deadliest ship, as well as among the largest ships in the known universe. It loomed over the comparatively miniscule Q-ship, like a dragon looming over a witless bovine creature. </p><p> </p><p>As it neared the massive warship, one of the Sanctuary II's many docking bays opened, granting the Q-ship entrance.</p><p> </p><p>In due time, the Q-ship was docked among thousands of similarly designed craft, and the main passenger disembarked and made his way swiftly towards the main audience chamber.</p><p> </p><p>As he stalked through the massive structure, the various beings that served as part of the Master's troops, or were lucky enough to survive as his slaves hastened to clear a path for the hooded figure who swept past without acknowledgement. </p><p> </p><p>For he was one of the Chosen, who gave absolute loyalty and devoted their considerable talents to the Master. Accounted as the highest and deadliest among his many servants, and among the very few privileged enough to speak face to face with him like an equal. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The figure eventually arrived before massive blast doors. Stretching forth a thin and pasty grey hand, the hooded figure registered his biometric signature and was granted access. As the metallic doors hissed open, the hooded figure suppressed a shiver of anticipation.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>He was acutely aware that his Master and God would be very much interested in the news he had gleaned and actions he had set in motion for his Master's Great Work.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Deferentially, the hooded being stepped into his Master's inner sanctum. His boots rang across the metallic flooring as he bypassed the massive throne that sat in the center of the circular room and went to the force field generated viewing gallery behind it, and stopped. Silently, he lowered himself into the ritual position of absolute surrender and abasement. He remained in that position for some time until the massive figure staring out onto the crimson planet below, stirred. </p><p> </p><p>"My son," whispered the gravelly and haunting voice of the most powerful being in the cosmos. "Report."</p><p> </p><p><br/>
The hooded being rose from his position of submission and rose to his feet. His long fingers pulled back his cloak, revealing a face that was humanoid in appearance, but a pale grey. If he were to appear before one of the Terran cows, such a one would probably mistake him at first glance to be a extremely aged elder. The thin strands of hair that rested upon his head were as white as that of the feeblest of mortals. His face was wrinkled and creased with many folds of skin. His cheeks were hollow and his eyes glittered with subtle malice.</p><p> </p><p><br/>
He was, to mortal reckoning quite old. However in the presence of the massive, gold-plated armored being standing before him, he was but a child. His mere handful of millennia paled in comparison to the untold eons his Lord and Master had roamed the cosmos, correcting the cosmic balance, one world at a time.</p><p> </p><p><br/>
Venomous glee bubbling in his heart, the pale, angular being began to speak.</p><p> </p><p><br/>
"As you commanded me to do Master, I have infiltrated the accursed Protectorate known as the Nine Realms. In my efforts to ascertain the Enemy's forces and military capabilities, I discovered the most delightful news. It appears that the High King of Asgard, the Aesir known as Odin is no longer resident within his domain. Another sits upon his throne."</p><p> </p><p><br/>
At that, the massive being turned his head slightly, dim light falling upon his ancient, battle scarred face.</p><p> </p><p><br/>
"Odin is banished?" he asked. "He is a powerful adversary, and has ruled those quadrants for nearly ten thousand years. His power and ruthlessness rivals even mine. Who could have torn him from his throne?"</p><p> </p><p><br/>
"Oh my Lord, the identity of the usurper will delight you," giggled his scout and herald. "It is the traitor. The would-be king who squandered the most precious resources that you graciously lent to his use, costing you not only the Tesseract, but also the scepter. The jotunn whelp, Loki."</p><p> </p><p><br/>
Silence reigned for a moment after the scout's bald announcement. Then the silence was cut by the quiet, bone-chilling chuckle of the purple hued warlord.</p><p> </p><p><br/>
"<em>Loki</em>. Now that makes things much more interesting, and a great deal more satisfying. And the Tesseract?"</p><p> </p><p><br/>
"It lies, secure in Odin's vault," replied the younger being. "Unfortunately, it can not be retrieved without expending a great deal of your forces. Even with an incompetent fool like Loki at the helm of power, the Asgardians still boast some of the deadliest warriors that exist in that sector of the universe. It will not be overrun easily."</p><p> </p><p>But the armored being waved one of his hands negligently.</p><p> </p><p><br/>
"That will not pose an insurmountable obstacle," he murmured. "I'm certain that you have already taken appropriate steps to ensure our success. What of the other four?"</p><p> </p><p><br/>
"My news becomes even more interesting," said the scout, a twisted smile breaking across his face. "I was able to glean the most interesting details from three of the chief warriors among the Asgardian menace. The stone that they refer to as the Aether, has been claimed by none other than the Collector, Taneleer Tivan."</p><p> </p><p><br/>
At that, his Master growled low in his throat in irritation.</p><p> </p><p><br/>
"Tivan. The one who seduced my precious Gamora with foolish lies and false promises. I should have known that filthy charlatan was somehow involved. And the others?"</p><p> </p><p><br/>
"As you are well aware, the Power Stone lies with another of our enemies, the so called Nova Corps of Xandar. They have secured the stone withheld by the fool, Ronan in an undisclosed location. Presumably, somewhere in close proximity to their Nova Prime," continued the Herald, "as they would not be foolish enough to store it somewhere offworld, beyond their reach. The location of the last two Stones is most interesting. That traitorous Asgardian allowed the Scepter to fall into the hands of the Terrans, where it is now fueling the lifecycle of a synthetic simulacrum, made of a fusion of synthetic materials. You might be interested to know that among the materials utilized is G'yji'gath alloy."</p><p> </p><p>"That is a rare compound," remarked the towering being.</p><p> </p><p>"Indeed," said his Herald. "It appears that Terra possesses a large quantity of the alloy, though I have not ascertained the exact location or amount yet. As for the last stone, once again it seems that Terra possesses many surprises. It seems that the Time Stone has been present on that planet for some time. It is in the keeping of an order of their mystics, their leader known as the Sorcerer Supreme of Terra. It would explain that most curious diversion of the Chitauri platoons that absconded to the uninhabited wastes of that world during the attack."</p><p> </p><p><br/>
Falling silent, the Herald watched the gargantuan being stare silently at the ruined world below. When he spoke, his tone was contemplative.</p><p> </p><p><br/>
"You know what the unenlightened masses call me. They call me murderer; despot; a tyrant. They accuse me of war-mongering. They name me <em>monster</em>.</p><p> </p><p><br/>
Why don't they see the universe for what it truly is? It is rotting at its core, and losing the ability to sustain us; soon it will implode, wiping out all of existence with it. For eons, I have watched the universe hurtle towards its inevitable demise, despite all of my efforts to halt its decline. I have traveled throughout the inhabited universe, culling the diseased and rotten strains of sentience to allow the healthy ones to survive. And yet those in power reveal their unwillingness to do what must be done to ensure an optimal outcome, just like the Elders of this world; <em>my</em> world."</p><p> </p><p><br/>
Stretched forth an armored hand, he caressed the air just in front of the force field generated observatory.</p><p> </p><p><br/>
"Once, I endeavored to ensure the survival of this planet. I urged the leadership of our planet to take the drastic steps necessary to ensure that our dwindling resources would last for future generations. All it would take was a sacrifice of millions, to save millions more.</p><p> </p><p><br/>
They reviled me. They condemned and banished me from my people. I was forced to watch my entire civilization perish because they lacked vision; they allowed their petty morals to constrain them from making the logical and sensible decisions necessary for the greater good.</p><p><br/>
"But now—" and here, the giant figure slowly smiled, "my moment of Destiny has arrived. After eons of searching, centuries of planning, of trial and error, the Power of the Infinity Stones lies within my grasp. I will do what my elders lacked the courage to do. I will correct the course of this universe, and ensure that balance is attained. With the vessel of salvation, I will bring an end to the ills of the cosmos with just one...<em>snap</em>."</p><p> </p><p>The Herald shuddered, not with fear or loathing, but with anticipation, with longing. For years, it had been his pleasure along with that of his siblings to aid their father and Master in his goal of bringing enlightenment to the countless worlds polluting the universe.</p><p> </p><p><br/>
They had used their carefully honed talents to scour the universe in their search for the illusive Stones. To finally ride on the cusp of victory...</p><p> </p><p><br/>
He smiled, viciously.</p><p> </p><p><br/>
The universe wouldn't know what hit it.</p><p> </p><p><br/>
"Do you wish us to cleanse Asgard of the traitorous filth, and seize the Tesseract?"</p><p> </p><p>His master pondered that proposal for a moment, but shook his head slightly.</p><p> </p><p><br/>
"No," he drawled. "Loki has no ambition. He will focus on his spoils and revel in finally being acknowledged as a king. Fool! His ambition is minuscule, and will lead to his destruction. No, the Tesseract will remain there for now. After all, I'm sure you've already prepared a suitable coronation gift for our young king?"</p><p> </p><p><br/>
"Of course," assured the Herald. "I took the liberty of visiting Muselpheim, a delightful realm of flame and death. The ruler of that realm, Sutur has an ancient score to settle with the Asgardians. I merely informed him of his enemy's untimely departure, and he jumped at the chance to revenge himself on his hated foes. Even now, he gathers his forces. At the opportune time, he will strike Asgard and burn it to the ground."</p><p> </p><p><br/>
"Sparing me the trouble of sending in an invading force to capture the Tesseract for me," concluded the Titan. "Inspired. That will give me time to ensure the maximum output of Outriders are prepared to be deployed."</p><p> </p><p><br/>
Turning from the viewport, the Titan stepped off of the main platform and began to make his way to his private vault, beckoning imperiously to his Herald to accompany him.</p><p> </p><p><br/>
Together they approached the most securely reinforced vault in the universe. It was accessible only through the throne room of the Sanctuary, and it could only be open by a willing command sequence given by the Mad Titan himself. The Herald looked on in awe as his Lord activated the sequence and the doors parted, exposing a completely white, sterile room, empty save for the spherical chamber wherein the Titan's most valuable weapon was stored. The Herald's hearts started to beat faster.</p><p> </p><p><br/>
Did his Master mean to do what he thought he intended?</p><p> </p><p><br/>
He snapped to attention as the massive Titan halted just before the vault.</p><p> </p><p><br/>
"Maw," he said quietly. "Summon the rest of your siblings. It is time we stepped in personally to ensure that no more mistakes are made. I made the error of entrusting such an important mission to shortsighted and weakwilled fools like Ronan and the jotunn. They were craven, and lacked conviction. They were children at play. But playtime is over. By their weak natures, precious time has been wasted, time that has emboldened our enemies. But if they and others like them prove too base to do as I ask..."</p><p> </p><p><br/>
Swiftly, he activated the final sequence to release the priceless relic that lay inside. As the bindings were released, Ebony Maw's breath caught as the being universally acknowledged as the strongest force in the universe sheathed his hand within the bronze-colored glove and clenched his hand into a fist, a smile teasing widespread destruction and death slowly forming on his face.</p><p> </p><p><br/>
"Fine," drawled Thanos. "<em>I'll do it myself</em>."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>
