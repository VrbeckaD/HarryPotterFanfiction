  <b>The Fate of Fear and Hate</b>
</h1><p> </p><p>
  <em>Love.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Happiness.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Home.</em>
</p><p>Those were the most common words written on people’s bodies. For a large part of humankind, their one word never changed, the fundamental feeling their soulmate had about them never wavering from the first moment they met to the last breath they took together.</p><p>A smaller part - those whose soulmate was somewhat wary about meeting their other half - showed less profound words, the color not as intense as it would be once the <em>real</em> and profound emotion would come to light. Some were prophesied that the other one would be <em>excited</em> or <em>nervous</em> when they first met them. Some even <em>annoyed</em> - a word that almost always promised an accidental meeting, like literally running into each other.</p><p>These words, however, would change very quickly, turning into a vibrant color to replace the almost fading grey. As soon as the more profound feeling would set in, they would read <em>love</em> or <em>happiness</em> or <em>home</em> or really, any of these feelings that proved that two parts had become one.</p><p>For Hermione Granger, however, the word revealing itself on her eighth birthday was none of the above.</p><p>When her parents found her crying in her room, they gasped at what they saw written on her wrist but quickly enveloped her in tight hugs, telling her again how they had first met. How Jean had grown up with the word <em>annoyed</em> and Hugh even had to live with <em>angry</em>, only to find out that it would turn out to be one of the worst meet-uglies possible.</p><p>They had met in a café, Jean on her way to a job interview, Hugh in a rush to get to work himself, not watching where he was going with his coffee-to-go. He had crashed into Jean so hard, his coffee had spilled all over her blouse.</p><p>Of course, <em>he </em>had been <em>annoyed</em> about the woman standing in his way.</p><p>Of course, <em>she</em> had been <em>angry</em> with the man for ruining her appearance.</p><p>They had parted ways in a hurry - only to meet again in Hugh’s dental office, where Jean had her job interview. It didn’t take them long then to realise that there was a connection between them, much less time for Hugh to pull up his sleeve and ask Jean if, by chance, this was what she had felt just about half an hour earlier.</p><p>Hermione, of course, had never gotten to see the shadowy words <em>annoyed</em> or <em>angry</em> on her parents’ wrists. Long before she had been born, the writing had changed, replaced by the vibrant and typical <em>love</em>.</p><p>In all rationality, Hermione <em>did know</em> that feelings could change. She knew that as long as the words were of a pale nature, they only described the feeling your soulmate had about you at the very moment you first met. She knew that not everybody was so lucky to have a vibrant love declaration written on their skin right away. </p><p>And just like every young girl waiting for her word to show, she had dreamed of it showing something that would never change. Something that would promise that her soulmate would love her from the moment he set eyes on her. And if she could not have that, then at least something that would warrant such a cute story like her parents shared, unique to most others but still with a promise of a happy ending.</p><p>On her eighth birthday, however, she only got one of those many wishes fulfilled.</p><p>For her tattoo was of a rather vibrant nature, showing that her soulmate’s feeling was strong, a profound emotion, not a fleeting impression upon their first meeting.</p><p>It was vibrant - but more than anything, Hermione now wished for it to one day change. </p><p>But it wouldn’t, not now. Not until she met her soulmate and he got to know her.</p><p>Given the word though, it might not ever change.</p><p>That was how Hermione learned to cover up her wrist. How she learned to never show anyone the writing there. How she tried to not look at it for too long herself.</p><p>Only at night would she lie awake, brushing her fingers over the four dark letters.</p><p>
  <em>H</em>
</p><p>Tracing one after the other.</p><p>
  <em>A</em>
</p><p>Wondering what she had done to warrant such emotions in her soulmate.</p><p>
  <em>T</em>
</p><p>Not caring for the falling tears soaking her pillow.</p><p>
  <em>E</em>
</p><p>Until she finally fell asleep.</p><p> </p>
