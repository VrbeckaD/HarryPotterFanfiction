    <p>"What do you want, Potter?"<br/>
"You called me a faggot." It rolled off his tongue as if it fit perfectly in his mouth, his eyes however, were positively murderous.<br/>
James was so easy about the situation. It was irritating. And-oh god. He strode towards Severus with a purpose.<br/>
"Suppose your not, either way you're doing a shit job of getting in Evan's knickers." Severus let his mouth curl into a half smile.<br/>
"Who said I was trying anymore, half-breed."<br/>
Snape's whisper was almost inaudible. "So you've given up?"<br/>
Snape instantly recoiled, trying to put as much space between himself and Potter as possible.  A fire exploded through James, starting at his heart, running through his veins at an almost alarming rate.<br/>
James instinctively grabbed his tie, pulling the slightly startled Slytherin closer. "Oh no you don't..."</p><p> James had never seen him like this before. Maybe it was just the way the light hit him, or how his breath smelt like cherryade.<br/>
Before he could think about any sort of repercussions, he lost it. He spun Severus around to lean out over the schoolyard, down at his peers while James got to work on his belt. Pulling him away from the view of the schoolyard, James settled himself on his knees in front of Sev's clothed crotch.<br/>
Fingers fumbled over buttons and zips as Severus rutted into James' hand.<br/>
His head was spinning and he didn't have time to process what was happening before James' mouth enveloped his cock.<br/>
"Please." He'd mouthed the words around Severus' prick, hoping he didn't notice how desperate it had sounded.<br/>
"Fuck." The curse was soft, swallowed up by the sounds of panting and low groans.<br/>
James pulled off him before he had a chance to come. His hazel eyes made dark under black lashes.<br/>
"You want more?" The question wasn't difficult to answer but it had forced Severus to look down into James' face. The angle made him look soft and fragile, the hard lines of his face replaced by something more genuine.<br/>
He found himself nodding, almost eagerly.<br/>
Hands raked down his sides, nails digging into his thighs as he rutted unashamedly into James' open mouth.<br/>
Severus grasped the nape of his neck, forcing him deeper. His orgasm started in the pit of his stomach and he allowed it to be wrenched out of him, watching James with hooded eyes as if he was the only being on Earth.<br/>
He came in minutes and James took it. He looked as though he needed Severus' come, as if his orgasm was oxygen and he couldn't breathe.<br/>
James' cheeks were ruddy and pink. His face streaked with come and saliva, he sat up on his haunches.<br/>
His eyes had cleared and he was staring at Snape again. The beautiful piece of artwork he'd witnessed come undone moments before had vanished. Whatever had taken it's place in front of him now was unrecognisable. James attempted to make a dignified exit before the full extent of what he'd done hit him.<br/>
"Wait." Severus' voice cracked as the high from his orgasm fully cleared. A haze descended over him like a blanket as he let his head fall back against cold stone.<br/>
For just a moment, there was a flicker of Snape's aforementioned beauty. But it was gone as quickly as it came.<br/>
The door slammed shut, leaving Severus alone in the Astronomy tower, staring at the decrepit stonework.</p>
