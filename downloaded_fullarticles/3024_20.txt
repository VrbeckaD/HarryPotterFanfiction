    <p>"GET HER!" The voices behind you screamed, thunder rumbled through the forest, shaking the earth along side the rapid footsteps of your followers, rain and wind hit you in the face like a cold slap, the sensation of the drops like thousand pin pricks against your skin but you wouldn't stop, you couldn't. You knew that you should have been more careful, you knew that it was risky to change outside of your house or the forest but you had no choice, the hunters were getting too close to your tracks. You hid in an alley as you transformed your body but unfortunately one of the villagers saw your shift and word spread fast of the demon hiding in their midst. You were an animagus, a beautiful wolf with a (h/c) fur coat, it was convenient for collecting herbs that you needed for your potions,, you knew the forest like your left hand and could find any desired plant without difficulty but your animal form apperantly got the attention from local hunters which lead to you being in the situation you were currently in. Your paws hurt from the pebbles and thorns that dug into them as you ran into the wilder and deeper parts of the forest, the footsteps were drifting farther away and you already felt a sense of relief that was until you felt the sharp pain going through your shoulder, blood immediately ran down your front leg and you fell down, howling in distress. The bullet went straight through your body and you forced yourself back up, gritting your teeth at the pain, ignoring the black spots in your vision as you limbed forward, your secret den was near, you could smell it, you were so close to safety! "She's wounded! Hand me the gun, quick!".</p><p> </p><p>A cold shiver wrecked through you as you heard the gun go off again, this time it only grazed your snout and you hurried your pace, the metallic scent of your blood drifted into your sensetive nose, it was almost painful but it gave you a boost of energy, your legs and lungs ached terribly, how long could you keep this up for? "<em>Oh dear, you poor little one.</em>" A deep voice echoed through your head, it was so sudden that you tumbled over a thick root, hitting your injured leg and ribcage against a tree, a pained whine left you, panting heavily you tried to scramble back up but couldn't find the strength in you to do so, tears burned in your (e/c) orbs as the footsteps came closer. You couldn't hold back the whimpers of fear and pain anymore, all strength had left you and the pain was too great. A lightning strike illuminated the forest briefly, giving you an oversight of your soroundings, the thick bushes and trees almost formed a wall around you. Tears streamed down your fuzzy soaked cheeks, this was it, this was how you'd die. "<em>Hush now little one</em>". The voice in your head whispered again, almost as if disagreeing with your defeat, and that's when you realized the bushes growing around you, engulfing your form in complete darkness, for a moment there was cold silence until you felt the familiar sensation of being teleported,your body tingled, then the wave of sickness hit you before everything settled again.</p><p> </p><p>The soroundings you found yourself in were warm, comfortably warm and quiet, your ear twitched at the cracking of fire behind you, orange flames cast a gentle flickering light across the room. Tentatively you sniffed the air around you, sensing nothing that could be of danger towards you, you shifted back, the black dress you had worn previously had torn in places but still covered you from any possible hungry eyes. Slowly you looked at your injured arm, the blood had continued to trickle down your limb, peeling around your palm onto the floor. "Oh you poor thing, these filthy muggles should be punished for hurting a pure creature as yourself." Flinching you turned around to the source of the voice, it was the same that you had heard during your chase and he was probably the same person that teleported you to this place. The man that faced you was surprisingly attractive, his tall frame was hugged by the perfectly tailored dark suit, contrasting starkly to his pale complexion and hair but what stood out most were his eyes, one a silvery striking blue and a deep rich brown. He unfolded his arms from his chest, putting them behind his back as he slowly walked towards you, making you back up with each step. "W-Who are you and why did you help me?" Yes true the man had helped you but that did not make him a friend.</p><p> </p><p>A gentle smile tugged at the corners of his pale lips. "Of course, how silly of me, my name is Gellert Grindelwald". It was as if someone switched a switch in your mind, articles and murmurs about the famous dark wizard flooded your memory, fear panged in your heart as the realization of your situation settled in, you were alone in a room with the most dangerous magician with no way of defending yourself, you were utterly lost.</p><p> </p><p>Grindelwald P.O.V</p><p> </p><p>He had known about her existence for a while now, he had his eyes everywhere and a talented witch such as her wouldn't go under his radar, a talent in potions and transfigurations, he was certain that she must have been the top student since she even became an Animagus, such high potential couldn't be wasted. Infiltrating her was the next step, she was rather timid, not engulfed with the other villagers, no friends or family to keep her company, she was lonely. He figured that she was the outcast of her family, the outcast from her old school probably too, a bit of coaxing and sweet words would make her open up to him quickly. Grindelwald watched her for weeks, studying her behavior, traits and antics, she was interesting he had to admit that. Setting up the fake hunter was easy, it was only a matter of time until she'd accidentally expose herself. The village was small and frowned upon every hint of magic, seeing a young woman transform into a wolf was more than enough for them. And now was the time for him to work his charm.</p><p> </p><p>End of P.O.V</p><p> </p><p>"Now please don't worry my dear, I'm not here to harm you". He pulled his wand out and placed it on the nightstand before walking towards you again, his hands visibly held next to his face, you watched him warily, clenching your wound tightly, it was beginning to heal slowly, the spell you practiced working as you mumbled it under your breath. "I can't see why anyone would want to hurt you my pet". You looked him up and down, he stood a few feet away from you, his arms still raised. "Would you perhaps join me for a tea? I can imagine that you are rather cold". He hold his hand out to you, glaring at the wardrobe on the other side of the room, a neatly folded woolen blanket flew out of it and softly wrapped itself around your shaking form, even though the fire was emitting a cozy warmth your skin still felt like ice.</p><p> </p><p>Carefully you watched his hand, he was holding it out perfectly still, focusing on setting up a cozy place near the fire and tentatively you grasped his calloused but warm hand. He glanced at you with a fond smile, pulling you up to your feet with ease, gesturing to the couch in front of the fireplace. "Please do sit down, warm yourself, we have so much to talk about". Confused by your lack of fear you nodded and shuffled to the rich looking furniture, the leather sofa felt extremely comfortable as you huddled yourself onto it, watching as Grindelwald prepared tea. "T-Thank you Mr. Grindelwald..for everything..". Your voice was quiet but you could clearly see the mismatched eyes flicker in delight. "There is no need to thank me, we magicians must hold together, must we not?". You nodded in response and watched the man walk to the singular seat opposite of you, a tea kettle and cups lazily floating after him to settle on the table between the two of you. The kettle filled a cup for you and Grindelwald, the cup floating in your open palms. Curiously you smelled the steam and sighed in content, this felt strangely homey and natural. Out of the corner of your eye you saw the magician sip on his own cup, licking the remaining drop of tea off his mustache. A sudden quietness settled upon the room except the fire cackling and the soft raindrops patting on the roof. You sipped on your tea, smiling at the naturally bitter after taste, the warm liquid soothing both your aching throat and nerves, for a moment you felt at peace but then a question nagged at the back of your mind. "Mr. Grindelwald, if you don't mind me asking.. How..How did you know that I was an animagus?". The wizard gulped down the tea before facing you, a mischievous glint in his blue eye that almost seemed to glow in the light of the fire. "It's a long story". He leaned forward and began</p>
