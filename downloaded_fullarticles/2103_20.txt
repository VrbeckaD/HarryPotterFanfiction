"I want to read your future."</p><p>Sybill gasped. "Y-You do?"</p><p>Septima nodded and took Sybill's hand. She closed her eyes and dreamily said, "I can see a white church near the sea, it's very pretty. Inside the church is you in a stunning white gown and a golden tiara. The wedding march is playing and that's it, I can't see anything else."</p><p>Sybill smiled. "A wedding is in my future, I just hope it's you I'm marrying." She added, "By the way, how did you do that?"</p><p>Septima stated, "I've been practising."</p><p>Sybill beamed, "Practise makes perfect as the saying goes."</p><p>Septima told her, "It was right though, the vision I mean."</p><p>Sybill inquired, "How do you know that?"</p><p>Septima replied, "I've been meaning to ask you for a while now."</p><p>Sybill insisted, "Go ahead, this vision proves I'll say yes."</p><p>Septima took a deep breath and queried, "Will you do me the honour of becoming my wife, Sybby?"</p><p>Sybill nodded and pulled her into a hug.</p><p>She whispered, "You took your time, I had the same vision in a dream weeks ago."</p></div>
