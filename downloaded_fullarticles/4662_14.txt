    <p>When he contemplates death, there’s nobody there that would miss him. Oh, there are people who would miss him–his mother certainly and probably even his father, but the thing is that there’s nobody he really cares about who would miss him.</p>
<p>The problem isn’t that he’s thinking about death at all. The problem is that when he does, there’s nobody who would miss him–not really. The problem is that there’s nobody for him to stick around for. There’s no name or face that pushes him back from the precipice. </p>
<p>He doesn’t care about hurting his mother or father; the choices they’ve made his entire life have only made him miserable, and no matter how he picks it up and turns it over in his mind, his future can only be darkened by the name, his association, his very being. If his actions weren’t enough, his very existence would be spiteful to the world at large. In his future there can only be iron bars and locked doors.</p>
<p>He’s sure his life is just barely dangling at the tip of a hook somewhere in The Dark Lord’s mind. Maybe buried, but there. All that’s needed to push him over that precarious lip is for His attention to be brought to it. Every day that passes brings him closer and closer, especially with every report of his failure to make progress on both of his tasks.</p>
<p>It’s almost sweet, the idea of it–death. His own little revenge. He’s angry, but more than that, he’s exhausted.</p>
<p>He stares into his face in the mirror. He’s so sallow now–from fear and illness, and drained. There really isn’t anything worth going on for. He’d cry if his wretched body would allow him.</p>
<p>Death runs rampant through his mind as he fiddles listlessly with his wand at the sink. The wood is shiny and dark against his skin.</p>
<p>It would be easy to do it. Simple. He doesn’t want the drama of it, the fuss. He doesn’t care about his mortal body; they can feed his corpse to the dogs for all he cares. There’s little enough dignity for him in life, and none in death.</p>
<p>It’s tempting. All it would take is two little words. He has the intent, the desire. He wants to. He doesn’t want to be anymore. If he could just blink out of reality, completely cease to exist, he might be happy.</p>
<p>He tries a feeble smile, but it looks like his face is breaking, pulling apart at strategic seams, and he can’t help the helpless hopelessness that envelops him.</p>
<p>He raises his wand, just to see how it would feel. The wood of it is cool against his temple, his eyes are steady where they’re reflected back at him. He could do it. It wouldn’t take anything at all. The thought scares him as much as it thrills him, makes something tight and dense in his stomach twist and relax at the same time.</p>
<p>Avada kedava he thinks. Imagines his body slumping over. Wonders whether he’d see his eyes go lifeless or whether that would just be it–over just like that. His throat tightens with the desire and fear. He wants it. He wants it so badly, his body is fixed in place with this terrifying hunger for silence.</p>
<p>When he contemplates death, the only thing he can feel is ready.</p>
<p>When he contemplates death, he thinks of freedom.</p>
<p>When he contemplates death, there’s nothing and no one to hold him back from taking the step.</p>
<p>When he contemplates death, it’s easy.</p>
<p>He draws in breath–his last. It’s sweet, almost beautiful. He’s not scared anymore. Even the Malfoy that looks steadily back at him is at peace.</p>
<p>His reflection smiles at him.</p>
<p>“Malfoy!” Potter shouts.</p>
