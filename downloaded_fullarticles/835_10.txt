  <strong>QUEEN OF THE YULE SEASON</strong>
</p><p>By: tweety-src-clt9</p><p> </p><p>
  <u>Chapter One</u>
</p><p> </p><p align="justify">Hermione Granger, the twenty-three-year-old ultimate nerd, has always been at odds with her cousins, Ophelia Rose and Elizabeth Ann. They are the two daughters of her Uncle Henry, her father's older brother. While Daniel and Henry are very close to each other, Hermione and her cousins are polar opposites.</p><p align="justify">Lia and Lizzy enjoy all things girl – boys, hair, makeup, and fashion. On the other hand, while she occasionally enjoys girly topics, she is more focused on politics, philosophy, and well, changing the world little by little. Hence, they are bound to clash. As little girls, they compete about the silliest things. They used to show off to each other by comparing who had better grades, who performed better in ballet and piano, things like that… Since the two sisters share the same interests, it had always been a Lia and Lizzy versus nerdy Hermione show. If the contest is related to academics, then the two sisters never stand a chance against her. However, if it's a battle about who had more boys fancying them, who had better hair, who had better clothes, then her dorky awkward self loses to her drop-dead gorgeous cousins.</p><p align="justify">When she got accepted into Hogwarts, she was so relieved that she no longer had to be in the same school as them. However, the mystery of her school had always been used as ammunition against her. Since they say that they haven't heard of her school at all, then maybe, she's not as smart as she claims to be. Because of that, even in the summer, she continues to study courses in the non-magical world just so she could get a perfect balance of magical and muggle knowledge. She even managed to sit her A-levels and after restoring her parents' memories, she got into a prestigious law school. She actually had a smug look on her face when she told her annoying cousins that she got a scholarship to study law in Oxford.</p><p align="justify">And now, her cousins have been using another way to make her feel bad about herself. Since she is the clear winner in terms of career and academic success, they're now going on and on about the blokes they are dating just to emphasize her lack of a boyfriend. During family gatherings, they constantly brag about the blokes they are dating while hinting that she must be so lonely since she's been single for so long.</p><p align="justify">Last Christmas, she made the mistake of bringing Harry to her family's favorite restaurant where they ran into Lia and Lizzy. Since she couldn't lie to their faces, what with her parents there, she introduced Harry as her best friend from school. And well, Harry being, er, <em>Harry</em>, her cousins immediately bothered her about the hot bloke with the perfectly tousled hair and the most gorgeous pair of green eyes.</p><p align="justify">Growing up, she could always remember a horrid Yule tradition she shares with her cousins. Well, they started it. And given that Hermione Granger never backs down from a challenge, she became an unwilling participant. Every December, her cousins would always try to best her as the family's princess of the Christmas season. Sometimes it's about who is the most applauded while performing for their families and friends, sometimes it's simpler, like who wore the better dress. She usually loses in the looks department but if the challenge is about the performing arts, especially in music, she usually wins.</p><p align="justify">This year, her cousins want to up the ante. This year the stakes are so high that Lia and Lizzy are calling the winner, the Queen of the Yule Season given they're too old to be princesses (according to them). Pretty dramatic, yes! But her cousins always did have a flair for sensationalized drama.</p><p align="justify">Anyway, long story short, her cousins wanted Harry. As a courtesy to her (since they claim that she saw Harry first), they will be giving her until the 31st of December to change her status as Harry's best friend into his lover, girlfriend, whatever... Just as long as she becomes romantically involved with him, she wins. If she succeeds, she'll be the <em>Queen of the Yule Season. </em>If not, she would help her cousin (whoever amongst the two, she didn't know) score a date with the handsome green-eyed bloke.</p><p align="justify">When she asked her cousins why they want to bet on Harry of all people, they simply rolled their eyes and huffed. Lia said it's rather obvious that she's head over heels in love with Harry. While Lizzy said that they are just helping her move things along with her relationship. Should Harry decide he's not romantically interested in her, then she could move on to someone else. <em>Like it's so easy to face Harry's rejection, </em>she sighed. Since her cousins are unaware of her being a witch, they do not know about her long history with Harry and the war. So, they cannot understand how heartbreaking it would be should Harry decide to remain best friends despite her efforts to catch his eye.</p><p align="justify">Thinking about her cousins' proposition along with their admittedly valid point, she begrudgingly agreed. It's not because she can't stand the fact that her cousins would be winning something against her. Nor is she a person who simply cannot back out of a challenge, she thinks she's above that sort of pettiness. But the real reason why she said yes is the fact that she cannot bear to see Harry with any of her cousins. She's loved the bloke for so long. While it pained her to see him pining over Cho and then Ginny in their Hogwarts days, at least those two beauties made him happy in some way. Her cousins were just after Harry because he's some sort of flavor of the month. He's just something that Hermione wants, so they must have him instead. She cannot understand why her cousins could be such, well, mean bitches to her. But well, that's her family drama...</p><p align="justify">Lia and Lizzy called her up for dinner on the 1st of December. It was at that dinner that they told her about their bet. Looking at her calendar, it's now the 16th of December. Time is running out and she still has no plans on how she'll get Harry to notice her as something more than a friend. She cannot allow herself to lose. It would break her heart to see him with her manipulative, '<em>we're so pretty we could have any bloke we want', </em>and downright bitchy cousins.</p><p align="justify">"I need back-up!" She exclaimed as she paced her bedroom at 12 Grimmauld Place. She's been reading <em>Cosmo</em> magazines, books about flirting and seduction, and all sorts of information she could find true to her nerdy self.</p><p align="justify">After reading article after article, she still could not bring herself to do the things she learned. It's like the article makes it so simple but her socially awkward dorky self just can't muster enough courage to act on it.</p><p align="justify"><em>Who to call…who to call… </em>She mused. Since her best friends were blokes, Ron and Harry, she obviously cannot go to them for help. Given it's Harry she plans to er, <em>seduce, </em>then it will be a very stupid idea if she talks to him or Ron about it. Of course, she could always ask her girls, Luna, Ginny, and Fleur but it would be a little awkward. Ginny dated Harry in their sixth year, Luna is too honest that she may unknowingly spill about her plan in the most inopportune time, and Fleur is a quarter-veela who never needed help in attracting a bloke.</p><p align="justify">
  <em>Well, it's either Harry or Ron, which is out of the question... or I could just talk to my girls...</em>
</p><p align="justify">"Whatever! I'm out of ideas!" She stormed out of her bedroom with a determined look on her face. Since the renovated Black Manor is very quiet at eleven in the evening, she did not have a care in the world if she's only walking in a sleeveless tank top and a pair of boy shorts, her go-to sleepwear. Despite the cold weather outside, the entire manor feels warm and comfortable due to the heating charms maintained by Kreacher and Winky.</p><p align="justify">After the war, Harry had been an early sleeper because, for the first seventeen years of his life, he had low quality sleep from his nightmares or from staying under a cupboard in his childhood. Given that Harry took an unexpected turn in his career choices, instead of going to the Auror Academy, he decided to focus on building a charity for orphans and investing the vast wealth he inherited from his parents and Sirius in various businesses and startups, he has complete control of his schedule. Because of the control he had on his time, he has taken to getting quality <em>zzzs</em> ever since.</p><p align="justify">Now, it was only her and Harry living in this house because Ron married Luna last year. And so, since she's certain he's already asleep, she just feels so at ease walking around in her sleepwear.</p><p align="justify">Thinking about how she could ask her friends for seduction tips and flirting advice, she was lost in her thoughts that she did not notice a muscular body going up the stairs at the same time she's going down.</p><p align="justify">"Oomph!" She thought she was going to fall but her face hit a solid chest and a pair of strong arms immediately wrapped around her waist to steady her. Looking up, she gulped as she saw Harry's emerald green eyes sparkling with amusement.</p><p align="justify">"What's got you so energized at this time of the night, Hermione?" Harry smirked.</p><p align="justify">"Er, sorry. I was lost in thought – "</p><p align="justify">"Yeah, I reckon that's the case," he grinned.</p><p align="justify">"Right, so, er, excuse me," she hurriedly removed her palms that were pressed on his bare chest as if burned.</p><p align="justify">"You sure you're alright?" He leaned closer so he could see her better. Her eyes widened as she felt herself getting lost in the concern radiating from his beautiful expressive eyes.</p><p align="justify">"I – I, uh, yes I'm fine. I just need to floo er, Luna, Ginny – "</p><p align="justify">"Of course. Just don't stay up too late. Goodnight," he whispered before lightly kissing her forehead.</p><p align="justify">"Goodnight," she murmured as her eyes closed when his lips touched her skin. When her eyes opened, Harry already sidestepped on the stairs and continued his way up.</p><p align="justify">Since she hurriedly ran towards the fireplace, she did not notice Harry stopping by the top tier of the stairs so he could catch one last look at her…</p>
