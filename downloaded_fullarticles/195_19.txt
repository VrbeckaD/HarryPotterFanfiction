    <p>Harry sat down at the Gryffindor table for breakfast between his two best friends. It was Ron’s 16th birthday and they were celebrating. Fred and George wandered over to wish Ron a Happy Birthday clapping him firmly on the back and singing Happy Birthday at the top of their lungs while Harry slid another pastry onto his own plate smiling at the twin’s antics. </p><p>Fred and George moved down the table to Lee after finishing their duet, smiling and winking at the other students as they passed.</p><p>Harry took a large bite of his pastry as he turned to ask Ron how he would like to spend his day. Before the words could make their way out though he felt a piece of pastry slide down his throat as he began to cough and choke. Gasping for breath and eyes watering as he tried to dislodge the errant breakfast food.</p><p>“Blimey Harry are you OK?” Ron asked as he realised his best friend was in trouble. Casting his eyes around the table he grabbed his own goblet of pumpkin juice, handing it to Harry.</p><p>“Here, drink this, it will help wash it down” Ron explained, handing over the goblet which Harry gratefully guzzled down.</p><p>“Better?” Ron asked as Hermione rubbed soothing circles on his back.</p><p>“Much, thanks, mate.”</p><p>“No worries couldn’t have you spending my birthday in the hospital wing now could we” Ron replied with a cheeky grin.</p><p>Before Harry could retort his stomach clenched and he leant over, groaning in pain as he felt his body begin to heat up.</p><p>He heard voices around him, but they faded to a dull buzzing noise as his whole being focused on the burning feeling and the magic swirling around him.</p><p>Harry wasn’t sure how long he was sitting there hunched over the table before the pain began to gradually fade to nothing.</p><p>He sat up and blinked his green eyes a few times taking a few seconds for his eyes to focus again on the people around him. When he did, however, he was met with shocked and horrified gazes.</p><p>He glanced sideways at Hermione as he heard her gasp.</p><p>“What is it, Hermione?” Harry asked in confusion, looking around to see half the hall looking at him in stunned silence.</p><p>“Ah” Hermione muttered unable to form a coherent sentence.</p><p>“Ron?” Harry said turning to his other side to face his red-haired friend, catching the eyes of the twins further down the table who were looking decidedly nervous and guilty. Harry’s eyes narrowed in suspicion at their expressions.</p><p>“Umm, look down” Ron spluttered face turning red as he waved his hand vaguely at Harry’s body.</p><p>Harry looked down and felt his horror grow.</p><p>“WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU DO FRED AND GEORGE!” he shouted as he saw what had happened to him.</p><p>Gone was his normal clothes replaced with a soft blue lace dress, it had a scoop neck revealing a large section of Harry’s toned chest. </p><p>Harry stood up from the table in anger, making his way around the table slowly as Fred and George began to back away. As he walked, he noticed how short the dress was, sitting well above his knees, feeling himself blush as he felt ridiculously self-conscious with so much of his body on display.</p><p>“What did you do?” Harry asked again in a deadly whisper, green eyes narrowing in anger.</p><p>Fred and George continued to back away, hands raised in front of them in surrender. </p><p>“Now Harry, that little surprise was actually a birthday treat for Ron. How were we to know you were going to drink his pumpkin juice.”</p><p>“Oi” Ron squawked indignantly behind him.</p><p>“But don’t worry” the other twin started, “it should only last a few days, a week at most.”</p><p>“A week! You expect me to get around in this for a week!? I’m going to go change” He said decisively already turning to head towards Gryffindor tower.</p><p>“Ah sorry Harry but that won’t help, the potion will change whatever you put on into women’s clothing until it wears off.”</p><p>“What am I going to do? I can’t get around the castle in this, I look bloody ridiculous” Harry said his anger starting to give way to dismay as he ran his fingers discontentedly through his dark locks, a hand trailing nervously down his side to pull at the soft material.</p><p>“Harry you look anything but ridiculous” Fred said earnestly.</p><p>“In fact, you look absolutely gorgeous,” said George running his eyes appreciatively over Harry's lithe form, while Fred nodded eagerly beside him.</p><p>“Completely delectable,” Fred said earnestly, and Harry blushed brightly under the intense gaze.</p><p>Rolling his eyes Harry sat back down, “you both owe me big time” he huffed and both twins nodded eagerly.</p><p>To Harry’s great surprise it turned out that others seemed to agree with Fred and George’s assessment of Harry’s new attire.</p><p>Harry was making his way out of the great hall with Ron and Hermione when he felt a hand reach out and squeeze his arse. He spun around quickly eyes flashing but all he was met with was innocent gazes, he narrowed his eyes suspiciously but couldn’t work out who had touched him. He hurried to catch up to Ron and Hermione who were already exiting the hall. As he went to rush out the doors he collided with a firm chest, falling backward and landing awkwardly on the hard-stone floor.</p><p>He laid there dazed for a moment before a concerned face swam into his vision. Rich dark skin and deep brown eyes let him know that he was looking at none other than Blaise Zabini. Harry groaned and shifted on the floor a little as he tried to regain his senses. </p><p>At the movement, Blaise’s eyes moved down his body seeming to take in his unusual attire for the first time. </p><p>Blaise stared in shock at Harry Potter sprawled out on the floor in front of him. He had been running late for breakfast so hadn’t been paying attention to where he was going when he felt a warm firm body collide with his own. Looking down he had realised he had run into Harry Potter, but it had taken him a moment to realise just what Harry was wearing. Harry had always been smaller and more delicate than most of the boys in their year but there was something about seeing him clad in the light blue lace dress that made Blaise’s heart freeze in his chest. His mouth went dry and his hands clenched at his sides in an effort not to reach out and touch as he realised that Harry’s dress had ridden up and revealed a pair of black lace panties, the outline of a cock clearly visible through the sheer material.</p><p>It took all of Blaise’s will power not to simply climb on Harry and take him right there in the great hall in front of everyone. Dark eyes narrowed as he looked around the hall and noticed all the eyes trained on Harry, many blown wide with lust as they took in the sight of the small Gryffindor spread before them. A small growl erupted from his chest at the idea of anyone else seeing Harry in such a position. </p><p>He leaned down and gripped Harry under his arms and pulled him to his feet, promptly fixing his dress, to several groans of disappointment from the other inhabitants in the hall. Harry blinked in confusion for a moment, wobbling a bit as Blaise pulled him into his chest, a strong arm slipping around his waist and holding him possessively.</p><p>“Are you OK Harry?” Blaise asked, concern colouring his tone.</p><p>Harry looked up at Blaise in bemusement, “Zabini?” he asked in confusion. “Since when do you call me Harry?”'</p><p>“Since right now, if that’s OK with you of course?”</p><p>Harry just nodded, not opposed to the idea of befriending the tall Slytherin.</p><p>“It would please me greatly if you would call me Blaise” the Slytherin continued staring at Harry so intently that Harry felt a light blush overtake his cheeks, though he wasn’t exactly sure why. </p><p>“Ok, I can do that” Harry replied only then realising that he was still ensconced in Blaise’s warm arms. He tried to pull away but Blaise didn’t seem keen to let him go at the moment. Harry looked at him in confusion for a moment before Blaise reluctantly released his hold on Harry, his hand gently brushing the soft material at Harry’s waist. Blaise had to bite his lip to stop a small groan escaping him.</p><p>Harry gave him an uncertain smile before hurrying out the door after Ron and Hermione, Blaise’s dark eyes following him as he went.</p>
