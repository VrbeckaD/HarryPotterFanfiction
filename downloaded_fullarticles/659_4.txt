    <h3>Too Late</h3><h4>Draco's POV</h4><h5>January 6, very early morning</h5><p> </p><p>I wake up to screams. Bolting up in the bed, I look at my lover laying next to me in bed. (Since it's Yule break and most of our housemates are gone, we can spend the night in the Room of Requirements without anyone realizing we aren't in our respective dorms.) What I see nearly stops my heart.
Blood. Blood everywhere. Pouring from his ears. Crying from his eyes. Trickling from his nose.
He told me the visions had been getting worse, more painful. Even with the occlumency I taught him early in our relationship. (With the people we encounter, keeping our affair secret could literally be life and death.)
We knew we'd likely need to use Dark mind magics eventually, but I made him promise me it was only a last resort.
 
It looks like today was that day.
 
I quickly pull down the black magic book we had found the ritual in and flip to the page. We had prepared for this day months ago. The Dark Lord had been haunting Harry's dreams more and more. Trying to coax him to defect from the Light and join the Dark Forces. Harry's emotions are both his strength and his greatest weakness. The Dark Lord plays on his guilt, wearing him down hoping to break him. Playing Ginny Weasley's death in second year over and over in his head. The resulting abandonment by the Weasley family and Granger, as if it was Harry's fault that he didn't find the Chamber of Secrets before her death was projected in his mind. Calling up any and all of Harry's worst memories.
And I suspected there's more than what Harry tells me but I'm not sure.
As all of the Dark Lord's manipulations were based in Harry's emotions, we had decided that a spell to remove the finer of said emotions would be the most effective way to stop him. It would still leave base emotions, but guilt and regret, among other finer emotions would be gone. The only problem was, the magic was black. So very black. And it required me, as the caster, to make a sacrifice. So once this ritual was done, both of us would be sociopaths at best, if not psychopaths. It depends on if we end up with an addiction to the dark magic.
Before I could second guess myself too much, I leveled my wand at my beautiful lover and started chanting.

<h4>Harry's POV: in the visions</h4>
<h5>January 6, very early morning</h5><p>"Oh, Harry," Voldemort greeted, sneering,  as he started dragging all of my worst and most painful memories through my mind. My mental shields were destroyed all the way through and he had me mentally tied down. "I do wish you'd stop being so stubborn. You have so much potential, I could teach you how to use it. You would no longer be treated like a child, the way Dumbledore's pathetic little Order likes to do."<br/>I'm hoping Draco has realized what was happening and started the ritual. He's terrified of a Dark addiction, those with Black blood are highly susceptible to it. His Aunt Bellatrix was a prime example of the madness the addiction can trigger in his family, so his concern was perfectly valid.<br/>As Voldemort pulls up the memories of the Order's treatment of me. I'm flooded with the anger at having information withheld under pretense of only being a child but still being expected to fight and win a war. I know now that there was a prophecy, Draco had overheard his father being ordered to find it and get the full wording. Apparently, iit foretold of the Dark Lord's defeat at my hands.<br/>As the memories of the Order faded out, Voldemort started in on playing on my guilt, the usual stream of memories and emotions flood me.<br/>After a little while I'm sobbing and Voldemort starts something different. I should have expected it really, with all of my shields shattered down to my innermost thoughts.<br/>"Harry, you know if you yield to me, I will spare Draco."<br/>My breath hitched. Draco. My precious lover. My sanity. Even while still schoolyard enemies during the TriWizard Tournament, his name was magically selected as my most important person. When I had no one, his taunting was the one constant. Somehow he started meaning more to me. After I rescued him from the lake, we had a good few arguments but then behind closed doors and hidden in shadows those arguments became laced with a tension that eventually morphed into heavy snogging and petting. I fell hard and fast for Draco, the thought of losing him was more than I could bare.<br/>I felt the last of my resistance and feeble sanity breaking as Voldemort started projecting images of Draco dying in various horrid ways if he stayed with me, but just as awful, him turning back to his dark family if I asked the one question I could never bring myself to ask him. Where he'd never forsake them if he had to choose between me and them. Where he never truly loved me.<br/>Watching the horrid images I broke... I could feel my sanity finally crack. I pledged my loyalty to him there in my mind before I breakdown into whimpering giggles at the relief in my mental torment being over and the realization that I could hear the last of Draco's chant and the last of any of my finer emotions faded.<br/>As I felt my new Lord's presence leave my mind, I opened my eyes to see silver eyes and blond hair looking down at me. As I giggled in my brokenness I could see he was high on the dark magic I could feel in the room.<br/>"Hello, beautiful, we have an appointment with the Dark Lord tomorrow," I tell him and he grins at me.</p><p> </p>
