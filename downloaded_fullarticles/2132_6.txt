          <div class="userstuff"><p>Harry entered the living room, nervous. He told himself that he could do this. It was only Draco. And his question wasn’t that wild… but it was Draco. One never knew with Draco. </p><p>“What are you doing standing there like an idiot, Harry?” Draco asked. He was reading, comfortably curled in one of the sofas, with his cat lying lazily on his feet. </p><p>“I wanted to ask you something.” Harry could feel his mouth drying, his hands sweating. </p><p>“What?” Draco raised an eyebrow. </p><p>“I wanted to ask you, I mean, if you think it’s okay…” he rambled. </p><p>“Yes…?”</p><p>“Ron has—” he interrupted himself. He couldn’t do it.  </p><p>“You look more nervous than when I had to tell my mother that I’d broken a heirloom. Just say it!”</p><p>“Iwonderedifyou’reokaywithmegoingtoaquidditchmatchinNorwaywithRon,” he said, looking everywhere but at Draco. </p><p>“Can you repeat that but slower this time?”</p><p>“I was wondering if you’re okay with me going to a quidditch match in Norway with Ron,” he looked at the cat this time. He hadn’t realised how cute he was. </p><p>“Yes, I’m okay with it. You don’t need to ask my permission, you know?” Draco smirked. </p><p>“I’m not asking for permission! It’s just that you… you’re dramatic!” Harry exploded. “I didn’t know if you were going to say I was leaving you for good or something!”</p><p>“I’m only dramatic when I have to be, Potter!” Draco’s face was the picture of indignation. </p><p>“Like when I went to the supermarket and you called the Aurors because you thought I was being kidnapped?”</p><p>“Nobody spends so much time shopping for groceries!”</p><p>“Yeah, sure.”</p><p>“Whatever. You can go, by the way.”</p><p>“Thanks!” Harry said in relief. </p><p>“I thought you weren’t asking for permission,” the git smirked. </p><p>Harry stuck his tongue out at him.</p></div>
