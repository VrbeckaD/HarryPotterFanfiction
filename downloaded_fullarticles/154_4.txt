    <p>00000000000000000000000000000000000000</p><p>It’s inexplicable really, how much life can change in a handful of hours, years even. People can fall in love, get married, have children, grow apart, divorce, move away, grow old together, or die alone. In seemingly a blink of an eye, everything can distort, and warp; like ripples intermingling on a dark pool of water’s surface.</p><p>You can’t ever see or tell where they go, but you can catch the after images and echoes of their existence like dancing will-o'-the-wisp trailing paths to the underworld. His life was very much like that, except while everyone else’ ripples connected and faded away to be reborn into the next life, his stayed frozen, forever permanent. </p><p>No wrinkles or lines framed his face, no age spots or pained bones plagued him. They were all just recycled loops of time, magick, energy, souls, whatever you deemed to call it. They were endless in their ways. Maybe that was why he wasn’t afraid to finally let go. Hermione had realized it first, as she always seemed to. </p><p>They were all turning thirty, and here he still stood, looking barely at the threshold of eighteen. They’d all vehemently denied it at first, of course, Ginny especially was distraught and in denial over it. But after the years kept passing it became too unavoidable not to acknowledge, that he was frozen in time; and perhaps in a way, he always had been. First in name, then later in the body. Daily glamours were damn near necessary by their mid to late thirties. </p><p>His children had long since grown and had children of their own. His wife, best friends, and everyone he’d ever really known aged and watched his sorrowful eyes, each of them donning identical with pitying forced smiles. </p><p>Though Luna surprisingly never gave him such glances, and he’d soon find out why. On her death bed, she told him that this was just a new path about to unfold and that he would find love and kinship again in a different time and place, and very soon. </p><p>Today he was one hundred and seventy-two years old, and it was time. After all, shouldn’t he know when his story was over? Or maybe it was just beginning? He was always fuzzy on what proper endings meant to him. The cool December air was biting as his breath frosted the air. </p><p>Godric’s Hollow was lovely even in the dead of winter, covered in crisp freshly fallen snow. Going back to the start, where it all began felt fitting in a way that no other end truly could feel. Fingering the frayed Holly wood of his wand he smiled a melancholic smile as he pressed the very tip against his carotid artery. </p><p>He briefly toyed with the idea of bleeding out against his parent's graves, leaving the halo of a bloody snow angel in his wake. But no, he was not so melodramatic as a pureblood would have been. </p><p>The killing curse hung loosely against his lips as he uttered them almost inaudibly, and then as if a shadowy hangman’s noose had snaked around his neck like a dog dollar his body crumpled to the powdered snow beneath him. The snow now looked more like falling ash, as the street lamps one by one went out as if giving a final moment of silence. </p><p>0000000000000000000000000</p><p>“So when did you realize that you wanted to die?” Came a silky whisper next to his ear. The voice sent goose-flesh down his neck, as a cold assault of sweat beaded all over his body in dread. No, this was supposed to be it. This was supposed to be his ending! Emerald orbs snapped open blazing like two twin pools of fire. </p><p>His surroundings manifested with a hiss of silvery smoke and mist like a memory just plucked and pulled from a Pensieve. An old courtyard came into view, in the full dying thrall of Demeter’s last blessings, splashes of orange, red and gold glittering in the trees sparsely. </p><p>The air was frigid, promising of the snow to come. Odd statues littered the grounds, like frozen dancers caught in midst of feasting for a Samhain harvest. But one figure stood out, whether or not it was a manner of man or beast Harry could not tell. </p><p>The being was wrapped in moving shadow, an ethereal glowing alabaster face poking through the opening of the deep billow of a hood. Set into the sharply angled face, were two cat-like golden eyes which were both amused but detached. </p><p>“You’re confused, it’s understandable if not a tad annoying.” Chided the inhuman man as it glided closer to him like a cross between a fae and a dementor. </p><p>Two long clawed hands came to cup his face, “You were never like them, surely you know that? You cannot hope to achieve the same afterlife.” </p><p>Harry let out a growl of breath and pulled away from the icy talons of the beast before him, “So, what are you? Death or something? Come to reap my soul personally? What splendor, that’s the Potter luck at it’s finest. I suppose I shouldn’t be surprised.”</p><p>Chuckling in a hissing wispy sort of way newly dubbed Death smirked, “No, my little Master nothing could ever be so easy. Not for you at least.” “If it’s not my soul that you want...what is it? The Hallows? You can have them, they are of no use to me, not anymore.” </p><p>Death circles him for a moment before picking a dying dark purple rose that turns darker and more feeble upon the god touching it, “As much as I’d love to ‘reap’ your soul as you put it, I cannot do so. For two reasons. One being your soul is incomplete, and two being you are my current Master. Without bestowing the three Hallow talisman onto another you will remain to be so.” </p><p>“I bloody well just told you, that you can have them back! Isn’t that what you want? And what is the nonsense about my soul being incomplete?” He frowned. </p><p>“Dawn, May 2nd of 1998. Tom Marvolo Riddle, otherly known as Lord Voldemort died, thus taking the other half of your soul with him.” Death droned out in a bored tone, “I do not make the rules, but the day he made you his Horcrux, soul-bound you as soulmates.” </p><p>Harry blinked once, then he blinked twice before he burst into a fit of roaring laughter that brought tears to his eyes. It took him a few minutes to calm himself, wiping his eyes of excess water he sobered and stared blankly at Death, “You mean to tell me, that goddamn Tom fucking Riddle jr. is my soulmate? The same mass-murdering sociopath, who attacked an infant over a shitty prophecy that a drunk off her ass on cooking sherry, Sybill Trelawney projectile vomited into Albus Dumbledore’s ear? The same idiot Dark lord of the century, Lord bloody Voldemort?” </p><p>“Seems you have a lot to say about him, it’s good to know every part of yourself, Mister Potter. Even the darkest, disgusting, damnable parts you hate remembering.” “Why am I here? Is this a nightmare? Is Snape gonna come back to life and give me detention in his underwear?” He snarked back as he looked around for figments of his past to suddenly spring forward out of thin air. </p><p>The clouds overhead crackled some in warning, darkening, and thickening like an over bubbled cauldron ready to burst. Death merely loomed ever closer, a patient and pitying look taking on in his golden eyes, “Oh poor little Master, you were never loved enough, were you? Despite all the supposed happiness your wife and children brought about. You always felt halved, didn’t you? I can fix that if you so choose.” </p><p>“And how would you bring that about hmm? You already told me that I can’t see them again. So what's the damned point in anything anymore? Or did you not realize I killed myself on purpose dumbass?” He glared.</p><p> A Cheshire-grin of jagged rows of fangs was his reply, “Oh Master, on second thought perhaps I'll just send you without explaining. Oh and do say hello to Tommy boy, would you? I’ll be in touch.” And with an ominous snap of his claws, the cobbled stone courtyard beneath Harry’s feet gave way to inky black nothingness.</p>
