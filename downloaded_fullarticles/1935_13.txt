    <p>It had been a rough two weeks but the day Seamus had been dreading finally came, the day of the memorial, the day Seamus finally forced himself to change out of the ratty t-shirt he had been wearing since that day-. <em>His</em> last day. Seamus shook his head, now is not the time to grieve, he thought angrily as his vision blurred, wiping away tears Seamus stood in his room buttoning up his nicest dress shirt as the early morning sunshine turned into golden afternoon rays on the bedroom wall.</p><p>-</p><p>Seamus spun around when he heard a soft knock, as the door slowly swung open; his heart skipped a beat hoping that maybe just maybe it would be <em>him</em>, the tall, skinny, black boy he had been in love with since third year. "Neville what are you doing here?" Seamus croaked his voice husky and rough from disuse.</p><p>-</p><p>"I came to check up on you, nobody's seen you since-" the sandy-haired boy murmured trailing off when he caught Seamus's eye, his own blue ones eyes clouded with grief and worry as he stood in the doorway.</p><p>-</p><p>"I'm fine, just lost my best friend that's all" Seamus spat sitting on the bed that hadn't been made in at least a week after Neville had forced him to go home and get some sleep rather than stay and help with repairs around the school.</p><p>-</p><p>Neville's gaze softened, he knew Seamus had taken Dean's death badly but he hadn't realized how bad until he saw the anger in Seamus's eyes, sighing softly Neville entered the bedroom. "You don't have to go you know it's just a ceremony the-" Neville trailed off as Seamus shot him a look.</p><p>-</p><p>"I know the bloody funeral is on Friday, but this is just as important it's to remember everyone who died fighting at the Battle of Hogwarts, Colin, Professor Lupin- Dean." Seamus's voice cracked at the last name and fresh tears formed as he buried his head in his hands.</p><p>-</p><p>"I know, I know, I miss him too" Neville sighed as he joined the sobbing Irishman on the bed, laying a hand on a shaking shoulder.</p><p>-</p><p>"I- I don't think I can do this" Seamus whispered hoarsely his body tensed at the sudden touch, taking a long shuddering breath his muscles relaxed before breaking into another fit of sobs.</p><p>-</p><p>"Sea if you can defy the Carrows you can definitely put on trousers" Neville joked forcing a smile as he gave Seamus a gentle push.</p><p>-</p><p>"I didn't mean going to the memorial- I meant living in general, I can't stand the thought of living without him, it just isn't fair" Seamus croaked tears still streaming down his cheeks as he tried to calm himself down. Tearing himself away from Neville, Seamus slowly rose from the bed and made his way to the bathroom to finish changing.</p><p>-</p><p>"Well Seamus, I just want you to know I'm here for you anytime, anywhere, and Luna is expecting to hear from you soon, she's worried about you" Neville called from the bedroom</p><p>-</p><p>"Ah so did you finally tell her about how you feel?" Seamus teased voice cracking a little at the effort to be cheerful and a small smile danced across his lips as he pressed a dry towel to his newly washed face. Everyone knew Neville had no interest in the Loony DA attendee but it was still fun to tease him about it.</p><p>-</p><p>Neville gave a half laugh "as if- You know I'm not interested in anyone" Neville lied thinking about the beautiful blonde woman waiting downstairs talking to Mrs. Finnigan.</p><p>-</p><p>Seamus walked out of the bathroom his tie hanging around his neck, "Nev please I was only joking, I know all about Hannah, You two were inseparable last year and she nearly kissed you to death when she found you after the battle." Seamus said remembering the moment fondly. It was probably the last time he had felt truly happy since the end of the war before he found out what the cost of war was.</p><p>-</p><p>Neville blushed before walking over to Seamus, fixing Seamus's tie Neville gave the small Irishman a tight hug "It's going to be alright, Sea and if you ever need to get out of here you can always crash at my place."</p><p>-</p><p>Seamus looked up at the slightly taller boy his eyes glimmering with fresh tears, "Thanks mate that means a lot, really" Seamus breathed giving Neville a tight squeeze</p><p>-</p><p>"Boys we got to go, the Portkey will be leaving soon and Luna will have my skin if we aren't on time" Hannah Abbott shouted from downstairs. The sudden sound broke the silence and the two boys sprang apart, giving each other a final nod the two boys made their way downstairs.</p>
