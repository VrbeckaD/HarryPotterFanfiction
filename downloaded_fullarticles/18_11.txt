          <div class="userstuff"><p>It felt so natural when Neville began holding Seamus’s hand. </p><p>They’d always been close, of course. They’d shared a bedroom since they were eleven. Shared lessons. Shared secrets. They’d changed together after pick-up Quidditch and lain together, sleepy on the Gryffindor settee, after one-too-many Butterbeers.  </p><p>“This is new,” Neville said, glancing down their knotted fingers. </p><p>“I’m sorry,” Seamus replied. His freckled face flushed pink. He dropped Neville’s hand, quick as a hex. </p><p>Neville shook his head. “I didn’t say it wasn’t welcome,” he smiled. “This is what I’ve wanted for years. I’ve just been waiting for you to realise, lovely.”</p></div>
