    <p>Messrs Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs were in different places at different times on a particular Sunday in October, and maybe the issue at hand could have been avoided entirely had this not been the case.</p>
<p>Someone----</p>
<p>“Not naming any names, Wormtail,” Padfoot would later spit snidely across a table in the farthest corner of the library. </p>
<p>---- had been distracted by a girl, of all things, a girl, with chestnut hair who dared to flutter her eyelashes in his direction.</p>
<p>“Did she want something?” Padfoot would ask, and Moony would sigh and clap a hand to his forehead. “What the hell did she want with you?”</p>
<p>Because of this betrayal, this breach in security, this unforgivable action, the Marauders (so they called themselves and were thus called), found themselves in quite the predicament. Padfoot could assume no responsibility as he had been faithfully serving a detention scrubbing out cauldrons with not a lick of magic. He drummed his fingers, rubbed raw, on the table with his eyes fixed on Wormtail. The absolute traitor, how could he? </p>
<p>Moony had been up in the common room, curled in an armchair recovering from a bout of sickness by the fire, simultaneously attempting to finish several scrolls of a Transfiguration assignment he had fallen behind on as a result of this. He had been excluded from the plan entirely because the Marauders had hearts, contrary to popular belief, and therefore he could not shoulder the blame this time around, which left Wormtail red handed: flirting with the Hufflepuff outside the Room of Requirement, with the candlestick.  </p>
<p>This led to the present.</p>
<p>Mainly, three out of four Marauders around a table with steam rising off the tops of their heads.</p>
<p>“But Prongs---”</p>
<p>“Prongs told you to keep watch.”</p>
<p>Padfoot was the least likely to have any of Wormtail’s bullshit, for lack of a better term.</p>
<p>Prongs, if he had been present as opposed to trapped in the Room of Requirement with Mrs. Norris prowling the hall contently, would have been patient and fair. But the proverbial ball did not rest in his democratic court, and The Noble and Most Ancient House of Black had a tendency to be a bit….</p>
<p>“I told you to keep watch.”</p>
<p>…. Tyrannical.</p>
<p>Wormtail, flustered, resisted the urge to respectfully remind Padfoot how many times he had been distracted by the fairer sex and foiled their plans because of it. He decided that maybe this was not the time nor place, not now with the fury in his eyes and the malicious curl of his lip and Moony too weak to defend him.</p>
<p>“We’ve got Quidditch in an hour,” Padfoot hissed, slamming his hands on the table. Madam Pince, the librarian, looked over harshly and he sighed, running his hand through his hair. </p>
<p>“How’re we going to get him out in time?”</p>
<p>Padfoot glared and opened his mouth to slice Wormtail from top to toe before Moony’s careful interruption.</p>
<p>“Arguing won’t help any.”</p>
<p>There was a steady silence Moony took as agreement, and so he proceeded.</p>
<p>“We distract the cat and get him out. Simple.”</p>
<p>“Distract the cat and she goes back to Filch and Prongs gets caught out of bounds again---”</p>
<p>“---it’s his own fault he was banned from the seventh floor---”</p>
<p>“---because of the last time we had to distract the cat!”</p>
<p>Moony groaned, chin resting in his elbow.</p>
<p>“Have you ever considered that maybe it was the way we distracted the cat and not the fact that we distracted her?”</p>
<p>Padfoot leaned back on the legs of his chair and fondly remembered blasting Mrs. Norris down the hall. “Never crossed my mind.”</p>
<p>“Oy!”</p>
<p>The fourth voice, joining them with a laugh, slid into the empty seat beside Padfoot and kicked a foot up. “What’re we talking about in such hushed tones?”</p>
<p>Wormtail, dumbstruck, took Prongs in with a dropped jaw. Moony snorted.</p>
<p>“You, you ass,” Padfoot seethed. “How’d you get out without getting caught?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Oh that’s neither here nor there,” Prongs grinned. “I got out unscathed, didn’t I?”</p>
<p>The boys mumbled in agreement.</p>
<p>“Without any help, right Wormtail?”</p>
<p>The boy in question stumbled over several nonsense words before being interrupted.</p>
<p>“Astonishing. I’ve still got it.”</p>
<p>“Very impressive,” Moony said dryly.</p>
<p>“A miraculous escape!” Prongs continued with a wave of his hand. Padfoot rolled his eyes. “Now you see him, now you don’t…”</p>
<p>“Are you planning on telling us what you’ve been up to yet?” </p>
<p>The question came from Moony and brought a second hush to the table. Prongs adjusted his glasses carefully. It was true, this was one of several Sundays he had taken up residence on the seventh floor with the request of a guard. It was true he’d been caught frolicking out of bounds and had been banned from said seventh floor. It was also true that he had been hiding a simple truth under the guise of mischief and was not quite ready to reveal this, even to his closest friends.</p>
<p>“That’s…” Prongs began, and Padfoot slowly finished.</p>
<p>“....neither here nor there.”</p>
<p>And Prongs eyed his best friend carefully, noting the masked concern. “Cheers.”</p>
<p>………………..</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As sixth years, the Brothers Marauders held a certain prowess over their fellow classmates. While not the top of the proverbial food chain, they came very close, and their reputations had a tendency to precede them. Therefore, it was common knowledge that Prongs (alias James Potter) had a habit of skulking around the seventh floor, though nobody was quite sure why. It was assumed that Padfoot (The Notorious Sirius Black) had a semblance of awareness that he must have shared with Moony (i.e. Remus Lupin), who may have told Wormtail (Peter Pettigrew, reluctantly) out of sympathy. But these presumptions were inaccurate, as even this storied friendship seemed to have bounds. </p>
<p>When the Marauders took to the Great Hall for dinner that evening, it was with the arrogance they typically strode with, in height order, with a secret in their wake. James Potter held said secret, and it smelled like a love potion. Its potency seeped through his robes and strung Sirius Black along behind him with narrowed eyes and arms folded across his chest. They took their typical seats at the back of the Gryffindor table and tucked in, two out of four drenched with sweat from Quidditch practice, the other two watching tiredly as they discussed tactic and form. </p>
<p>“When you swing your bat you have to turn your body---”</p>
<p>“Why don’t I just pirouette off the broom?” Sirius grumbled, reaching for the pumpkin juice that had just appeared on the table. The chatter around them escalated as students continued to pour in for their evening meal. “Would that satisfy you, Captain?”</p>
<p>James rolled his eyes. “Rather dramatic, don’t you think?”</p>
<p>Sirius Black, of The Noble and Most Ancient House of Black, gasped with a hand to his chest. “Moi?”</p>
<p>James opened his mouth to deliver a scathing reply but was momentarily distracted by a group of girls moving past them to the front of the table. At the head of the pack, a blonde and a redhead with linked arms. At the back, a flock of brunettes involved in what looked like an intense discussion of nothing in particular. The blonde glanced over at the Marauders, peering down her ski slope nose with a sneer. The redhead followed her stare with lesser intent; a simple grimace would suffice.</p>
<p>“Captain,” she greeted James in a rasp. </p>
<p>“McKinnon,” he grinned back. Then he moved slightly to the side, as if to peer around McKinnon, to her redheaded counterpart. “Evans.”</p>
<p>And Evans said, with the semblance of a sigh, “Potter.”</p>
<p>“Carry on,” Sirius said with a wave of his hand. McKinnon scoffed.</p>
<p>“How <i>is</i> your arm, Black?” she asked, raising a brow. “That was quite the swing, before.”</p>
<p>McKinnon and Black were a team of beaters whose sheer passive aggressivity powered them to victory, though they lacked the standard of communication held by most. They spoke predominantly in snide remarks, side swipes, and carefully crafted insults. </p>
<p>“Just fine, thank you for your concern,” Black started as he rested his chin in his palm, bored. “And your face? Looking a little tight.”</p>
<p>“We’ve got to be going,” Evans said quickly, tugging on McKinnon’s arm as she moved to snarl. Black raised an eyebrow in amusement. Potter seemed to glance apologetically between his friends, though he couldn’t find much to say. And then there was a sound, a gratifying sound to some, which caused the lot of them to turn and stare in the direction of the Slytherin table on the opposite end of the Great Hall. The sound itself was loud enough to quiet the entirety of the hall, as all eyes seemed fixed on the display: in the aisle with their wands raised stood two Slytherins, facing each other with violent intensity. </p>
<p>“Enough!” shouted Horace Slughorn, potions master and Head of Slytherin House as he rose from his position at the teacher’s table. “Dolohov! Knott!”</p>
<p>Knott moved her eyes in the direction of Slughorn’s voice without lowering her wand. </p>
<p>“You first,” she said, cold. Dolohov sneered at her. Every student in the hall looked on eagerly. Slughorn stood and moved to the front of the teachers table where he was carefully watched by his peers, who seemed content leaving him to handle his house accordingly. </p>
<p>“Knott,” he boomed. “Lower your wand.”</p>
<p>“Flipendo!” she cried, sending Dolohov crashing to the floor. The hall erupted into a flurry of sound, mingled shock, amusement and disarray. Slughorn flew down the aisle as the Slytherin table shot up in arms. Knott, smug, maintained her composure even as her head of house took her by the arm and yanked her away from the scene. As he pulled her to the corridor, steaming red and fuming, she shot a glance at a certain collective of Gryffindor boys. Some of them didn’t see it, so caught up in recounting the action. What a joy it was when their enemy house attacked themselves. But some of them did. </p>
<p>James Potter pushed his glasses up the bridge of his nose.</p>
<p>Ainsley Knott smiled softly.</p>
<p>And Sirius Black, glancing between them, knew.</p>
