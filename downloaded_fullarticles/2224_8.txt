    <p>Hermione Granger was the first of us to really recover from the effects of the war. Well, of course she was. Brightest witch yadda yadda. She knew she was broken, but she sure as hell wasn't going to stay that way. As soon as the wave of war wounded were dealt with, and Healers were no longer working around the clock, she went to see Madam Pomphrey. She knew she had malnutrition. She suspected she also had PTSD. Well, that's the muggle term. <em>Core Strain</em> it's often called in the Wix World, since it's often seen in Hit Wizards or Healers who use too many spells, day in and day out. But that's inaccurate since the same symptoms can be caused by getting hit by spells over and over. Or running for your life.</p><p>(Or trying to protect younger students from sadistic Death Eaters like the Carrows, running amok in our school.)</p><p>So... yeah. We all have PTSD. But Granger went and got diagnosed with it first. Went to a Mind Healer. Then when she realised that Wix Mind Healing was less advanced than Muggle methods, she questioned everyone she knew until she found a Squib therapist so she could go to them and talk about the Dark Lord and the War.</p><p>By the time Eighth Year started back up again in Hogwarts, Granger was full of praise for her therapist and was pushing the idea on everyone, as well as terms that most of us hadn't heard before, like 'Survivor's Guilt' and 'Institutional Betrayal'. Eventually Potter and Weasley got so fed up with her trying to goad them into therapy that the three of them had a blazing row, and McGonagall actually made Granger write lines: 'I am not a qualified Mind Healer.' and 'My friends will make their own medical decisions.'</p><p>(I think Potter and Weasley had to do their detention at St Mungos in the Chronic Core Strain ward. If it was supposed to make them decide on their own to get Mind Healing, it didn't work. At least not then.)</p><p>Â </p>
