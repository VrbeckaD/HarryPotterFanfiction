<p>Retained Memories</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>“My earliest memory’s of my mum,” says Luna dreamily. “I’m warm, surrounded by her hair, and she smells good. Like a spring garden.” </p>
<p>Neville squeezes her hand. “I have no similar memories.” He sighs. “And you’ve seen how my parents are now.” </p>
<p>Rolling onto her side, Luna blinks at him. “I’ve seen them with you.” She smiles, and even with grass in her hair she’s never been more beautiful. “They love you.”</p>
<p>Neville inhales, his chest tight. “I suppose. There’s no way to prove it, though.”</p>
<p>“Of course there is.” Sitting up, Luna tugs his hand. “Come, I’ll show you.” </p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Alice’s staring straight ahead when they arrive. </p>
<p>“See?” Neville runs a hand through his hair. “Somewhere inside she may have a remembrance of me, but it’s buried too deep.”</p>
<p>Luna raises up on her tiptoes, kisses his cheek, then approaches Alice. “Hello,” she says, perching on the edge of the cot. “I’m Luna and I love Neville, too. I think you remember him, but he’s not sure.” </p>
<p>Alice doesn’t respond. </p>
<p>Luna leans closer. “I know it’s difficult, but it would be lovely if you could come back before the baby’s here.”</p>
<p>Neville freezes. “Baby?” he wheezes. “We’re pregnant?”</p>
<p>Luna smiles.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Once the baby arrives, Luna takes him to visit his grandparents. Neville thinks it’s a bad idea, but Luna won’t be dissuaded, so he goes, watches, blinking moisture from his eyes as Alice stares blankly while her grandson coos in her lap.</p>
<p>Frank doesn’t react either, but Luna takes it in stride, kissing them before leaving. </p>
<p>She returns often, and Neville doesn’t have the heart to tell her it’s useless. If it makes her feel better, what’s the harm?</p>
<p>When the hospital owls to remind him disruptions, such as dancing, are against their rules, however, Neville has to do something.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Neville arrives, finding baby Frank playing on Alice’s bed, Alice watching him. </p>
<p>Frank watches them both, his expression peaceful. </p>
<p>Luna’s dancing, and Neville’s heart spasms. Her hair and dress float about her. She’s spring in the form of a woman. </p>
<p>Spotting him, Luna claps. “Look, everyone, Neville’s here!” </p>
<p>Baby Frank gurgles, reaching his hands for Neville. “Da!” </p>
<p>Alice looks up, as does Frank, and Neville gasps. “Dad?” he whispers. “Mum?”</p>
<p>Moving closer, Neville scoops Frank into his arms, then sits beside Alice. “Do…you remember me?”</p>
<p>Alice offers him a wrapper. </p>
<p>Luna rests her hands on his shoulders as Neville cries. </p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Neville smiles, watching Frank playing in his grandfather’s lap by the fire. </p>
<p>Alice, in another chair, watches them, eyes alight. </p>
<p>His parents don’t speak, but the love that shines from their eyes says enough. </p>
<p>“Do you think they’ll talk one day?” Luna asks softly, coming up beside him. </p>
<p>“Maybe.” Neville slips an arm around her waist. “This is good enough for me, though. Frank will remember growing up with his parents and grandparents.” </p>
<p>“Yes.” Luna rests her head on Neville’s shoulder. “And so will she.” </p>
<p>Neville freezes. “<i>She</i>?”</p>
<p>“The new baby.” Luna hums. “Let’s tell them.” </p>
<p>Neville laughs. “Yes, let’s.”</p>
