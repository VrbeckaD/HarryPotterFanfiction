    <p align="justify">     Diffused sunlight stained Hogwarts’ Great Hall crimson, touching the faces of students and teachers alike and giving them an ethereal glow. They looked both sinister and wise, the lot of them standing with solemnity and purpose in the setting sun’s light. Hot as though the late June’s day had been, the sinking sun no longer warmed the Earth; several students pulled their cloaks tighter around their shoulders, shivering in response to either the aura of magic or to the cold--but quite possibly both.</p>
<p align="justify">     A dark hand reached up to tousle even darker, messy hair near the front of the room; a red-headed girl grabbed it with her own and smiled playfully at its owner, eyes shining radiantly. Beside them, a taller boy with sandy hair tugged on his shirt absent-mindedly, grinning at this exchange. His eyes periodically slid to a devastatingly handsome boy with long, gleaming hair; the expression on his face was unthinkingly haughty, but he smiled slightly when the other looked at him. Their hands rested beside each other, not quite touching. Though held loosely, hidden tension was making both wrists ache.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">     “Sirius Orion Black,” read out a rather intimidating witch from the front of the room, a long piece of parchment trailing at her feet.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">      The long-haired boy shook back his glistening locks and, with an excited glance back at his group of friends, made his final journey to the front of the Great Hall.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">     A small boy gasped, his watery eyes wetter than usual. He stood uncomfortably close to the sandy-haired one, who did not step away, despite being all but clung to, as if the smaller was afraid of getting lost in the unmoving crowd.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">     Sirius reached the front amid hearty whoops and clapping. He dipped his head at the witch in front of him, who actually smiled.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">     “Thank you, Professor McGonagall,” he said sincerely, accepting the sealed letter she handed him, marked with the ancient school’s crest of arms. “I hate to say it, but I will miss Hogwarts. Stay sweet.”</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">     Her apathetic expression did not change, but her eyes did roll good-naturedly. She shook out her parchment and read the next name.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">     When “Lily Jean Evans” was called, the gingery mane made its way up to the front. Lily shook Professor McGonagall’s hand, then gave up pretense and pulled her into a hug, which was gently returned.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">     The rest of the students filtered up slowly, each receiving a wax-sealed letter. Professor McGonagall had a polite smile for everybody and words for a few, said low enough to only reach the intended ears.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">     Once a letter resided in each student’s hand, the low chattering that had filled the Hall died; Professor McGonagall lifted her wand, and there was a flurry as everybody else followed suit.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">     “Thank you for allowing us--” she gestured toward the staff table, where many moist eyes were hastily dried, “--to oversee your education. You’ve already heard your Headmaster speak; I will hold you no longer. We all wish the very best of luck to every one of you. May all of your practices make us proud.”</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">      As one, the young witches and wizards brought their wands down upon their letter, breaking open the seal.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">     Most people pulled out the contained parchment, scanning quickly over it; Lily glanced at the tall man to her side and exclaimed, “Seven N.E.W.T.S., Remus?”</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">     He stuffed his letter back into its envelope hastily, turning red; Sirius barked with laughter. The five of them allowed the now-moving crowd to carry them out the great doors; they walked along the darkening grounds as one for the last time. Everybody grew quiet, the crowd much more silent than one that size should be; Remus glanced down at his tiny friend and briefly clasped a hand to his shoulder.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">     “Don’t worry, Peter,” he said gently. “We’re all the best of mates. Leaving Hogwarts doesn’t change that one bit.”</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">     Avoiding Remus’ eyes, Peter slowly nodded. Perhaps it had been the use of his birth name, replaced so often by ‘Wormtail’ over the years he sometimes forgot it, or perhaps it was the others’ gentle nods--or maybe it was neither and simply trust in Remus that made him relax and say, “I know.”</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">     They walked towards the lake’s edge, where many boats were bobbing in the water--the same vessels they’d arrived in their first year.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">     “Peter, why don’t you ride with me?” Lily put an arm around his shoulders and whisked him to a nearby boat before he could protest.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">     Sirius bumped James’ shoulder with his own. “I suppose that mean Wormtail’s taking Lily’s hand, eh?”</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">     He grinned at him, rolling his eyes and ruffling his hair automatically. “Good thing I’ve still got other options...right, Padfoot?”</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">     “Well, you’ve got the ring at the ready. Moony can be best man.” Sirius winked at him.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">     Remus gave them a long-suffering sigh. “Only if I can pick your colors. I can’t have Sirius’ big day clash, and I don’t trust either of your senses of style.”</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">     “That’s the spirit!” James held out a fist. Remus bumped it wearily with his own, grinning nonetheless. He shuffled his feet a bit, then said,</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">     “Well, we can’t all three fit in one. We’re quite larger than we were seven years ago. We would drown.”</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">     “Yeah, I’ve heard they’ve put in a giant squid. I don’t fancy a tangle with one, even if it is a baby.” James’ tone was serious, but his eyes were squinting, a familiar expression meaning he was holding back a grin.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">     “I don’t know, I reckon you’d be able to take one. Have you ever heard of a baby winning any battles? Besides, you wouldn’t even need to swim; your big head would keep you afloat.”</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">     Sirius dodged James’ good-natured punch, laughing. Remus watched him fondly, then said, “I suppose I’m off to find somebody, then.” He turned away.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">     “Ah, Moony, don’t worry about it. I’m curious to see if they’ll let me have one of my own...or if they’ll notice, for that matter.” James took off, casting back a furtive look at Sirius.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">     Remus shrugged and turned to Sirius. “D’you reckon we should find ourselves one, then?”</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">     He nodded, his silky black falling into his face as he stepped over the nearest boat’s lip. Remus tried to not watch as his robes pressed against his lean body, but he was fighting a lost battle. He clambered in after him, settling in a bit too close for comfort. His stomach clenched as his pants tightened a bit.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">     Curious, he looked around to Lily to see how she felt being so close to Peter, but they were much smaller than Sirius and himself, therefore fitting quite comfortably.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">     Everybody finally in their boats, including, Remus noted with amusement, James, stretching out on his back to occupy the entire boat, hands grasped backwards over the lip, they started across the vast, black water. The moon had not yet risen. Though Remus knew, without having to think about it, that tonight’s moon would be in its last quarter and that he was relatively safe, the darkening sky filled him with a sense of dread. It brought to the front of his mind problems he did not want to consider, but had to now, leaving the protection of Albus Dumbledore…. He mentally shook himself and instead focused on how the fading light touched Sirius’ face and made his sharp cheekbones soft and less foreboding. His hand ached with the longing to brush his cheek, but he held himself back. The sun had sunk behind the mountains, and the temperature was steadily becoming colder. It made for a peaceful but simultaneously mournful atmosphere.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">     In the distance, Remus could see his willow, its branches waving softly, though there was no breeze. Had Sirius not been there, he would have waved his own hand in goodbye, but instead he settled for a slight nod. As always, the small but sturdy tree sent a pang through him, set him immediately to thinking about the awful night he’d almost killed Sev--</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">     “It’s a bit pointless, wouldn’t you say?” Sirius’ tone was casual and he met Remus’ startled eyes calmly. If Remus hadn’t known him so well, he would have thought he was bored--yet, beneath the cool exterior, Remus saw intensive heat building. It distracted him; he understood, and was grateful.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">      “Er...what’s pointless?”</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">      “You know, sailing to the train when we could just Apparate there.”</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">     Remus shrugged. “Not everyone can do it; Wormtail still hasn’t passed his test. Besides, it’s symbolic; water as a cleansing tool is used everywhere from Whi--”</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">     “Moony, we <em> just </em>graduated. No more learning for awhile, okay?”</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">     He grinned, leaning back. “Alright, have it your way. I’ll give you two weeks, but then I expect a full twelve inches on the symbolism and importance of this tradition.”</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">     “Oh, I’ll give you twelve inches,” Sirius growled, so low Remus could hardly hear it, even with his improved hearing.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">     Remus flushed red, grateful at once for the still-darkening sky. He could not think of how to verify if he had heard him right, and did not trust his own voice in any case. Instead, he dipped his hand into the lake, looking down at it in order to hide his face from Sirius.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">     He let the silence stretch between them, enjoying the feeling of the cold water. After his hand was numb, he said hesitantly, “Hey, Pads?”</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">     Sirius straightened subconsciously at the change in his tone. “What’s up, Moony?”</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">     “I...I don’t know if I should stick around you, now that we’ve graduated.”</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">     Sirius’ expression hardened, silvery eyes turning to cold flint.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">     “I’ve told you. You aren’t leaving m--us.”</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">     Remus extracted his hand, shaking it slightly to dry it. He entwined his fingers together, looking at his feet, and said, “I’m dangerous.”</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">     “And I’m a hippogriff. You are not a danger to me, Remus.”</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">     He glanced up at his name. Sirius’ eyes bored into his own, full of intensity and stubbornness and something else, something that made Remus’ thighs tighten, but thinking about that made this even harder--</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">     “But I’m dangerous to others! I can’t have flatmates, I can’t even have <em> neighbors </em>, I--”</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">    “Remus.” Sirius leaned forward, grasping his hands around Remus’. He gently touched his forehead with his own, his black hair falling across Remus’ eyes. His hands were warm and reassuring, and Remus hated himself for craving the contact. “Moony. You don’t need to worry about this. I was waiting until we were sure to tell you, but...one of Dumbledore’s contacts has been experimenting and he thinks he’s discovered...well, not a cure, you’ll still transform, but...a help. You keep your head.”</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">     His eyes danced back and forth between Sirius’, as though to catch either one of them lying to him. Heavy bags still sat beneath his hazel eyes, a remnant of the last moon cycle.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">     “It’s still in the very early testing stages, but it looks hopeful. In the meantime, I’ve--”</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">     But Remus dropped his head into his hands again, wrenching them from Sirius’ grasp.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">     “I’m sick of being a burden to everybody around me.”</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">     “What are you talking about?! You are <em> not </em> a burden, Remus John Lupin. You’re--”</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">     The ship’s edge slid onto sand, and the grating noise cut him off. Remus made to stand up, slipping as the boat rocked beneath his shifting weight. Sirius grasped his hands again, more firmly than before, as Remus fell the few inches back onto his seat.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">     “This conversation is not over,” he promised. “I want you to stick around.”</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">     “I’d love to, but I’m worried about killing you.”</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">     “You are so melodramatic, Moony. I’d almost say you’re worse than I am. Come on, let’s go to the train; I can see Prongs up there.”</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">     The two made their way toward the dark figure, who was bouncing excitedly. As soon as they reached him, he started going into detail about how he <em> swore </em> he’d seen a Quaffle-sized eye looking up at him, how he’d waved and a tentacle had pushed him along (“How else could I have gotten here before you did? I left the shore later!”). Sirius was laughing, telling him to come off it. Remus accepted this distraction readily, relieved he had a few hours to recoup before Sirius attacked him with reality again. It hurt him to deny Sirius anything, but he couldn’t imagine if something happened, if he hurt Sirius, if he had to live in a world without him….</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">      Lily and Peter caught up to them and the five began walking towards the steaming scarlet engine.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">     They found an empty compartment and settled down, James automatically lying his head in Lily’s lap; she smiled lovingly and started playing with his messy hair. Remus sat by Peter, staring out the window to avoid Sirius’ occasional, pointed stare. He watched as Hogsmeade Village sped by--The Three Broomsticks, where he had his first drink third year and realized that he had a crush on Sirius--he thought he saw the vague outline of the shack, his prison the villagers now avoided--the buildings were gone now, the pointed black towers of the castle all that was left to see--</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">     He watched until there was nothing but countryside, until it was dark enough that only his reflection was visible. He’d never liked seeing himself, pale and sickly, with his lips permanently turned down. He turned from the window, looking automatically to Sirius, who returned his gaze with a surprisingly soft one. He grinned at him nervously and again leaned back, opening a book instead of joining in their conversation about the planned graduation party, and settled in for a long ride.</p>
