    <p>New York City in the grand year of 1885 is a city on the turn of a decade, the forward-thinking city of the future. The stars glitter on Broadway, the newly-opened Brooklyn Bridge connects Manhattan to Brooklyn, the new airship docking tower stands tall and proud over the city skyline, and the eyes of the world watch as the greatest city leads the charge toward the millennium. In New York, it is said, you can be a new man.</p><p>Credence Barebone dearly hopes that this is true.</p><p>He watches the city skyline approach from the bow of the airship carrying him to what is supposed to be his home. New York glitters and gleams, a diamond on the edge of the Atlantic, impossible and beautiful. It seems like something out of a dream.</p><p>Though the summer sun is hot, the breeze remains chill at this altitude, and that is a reminder that Credence really is awake. Still, he doubts. It isn’t possible, is it? Can this really be happening?</p><p>“My dear boy,” Mr. Grindelwald says, stepping up beside him as if he’d heard Credence thinking, “this is really happening. You may be ascending from the very bottom of society, but I do believe that the world will never be the same when you are finished with this city.”</p><p>“Thank you, sir,” Credence says, glancing at the man, ducking his head a little.</p><p>Mr. Grindelwald claps him on the shoulder. “I’m not a ‘sir’ anymore,” he says with a dazzling and confident smile. “Never forget, Credence, that you are the equal of any man in the world.”</p><p>Credence doesn’t reply, looking forward instead. They’re flying over the harbor, now, sailing forward toward the docking tower. The ships below, the ships they might have taken if Credence weren’t suddenly so wealthy, seem small. When they dock, he’ll be headed to claim his fortune, to take his place in the great pageant of New York City, at long last.</p><p>***</p><p>It’s not every day that a lost heir to a fortune comes to New York City. Indeed, it’s quite exceptional, but even so, a police presence shouldn’t have been necessary. That doesn’t mean Graves has a choice about being there; when John Kelly asks you to jump, you only ask how high. This doesn’t, however, mean that Graves has to be happy about it. His opinion on the matter is that a young man with a new fortune should be able to take care of himself. But no one asked him anyway.</p><p>“Sir, I don’t understand why I’m here,” Tina says, breaking Graves from his reverie.</p><p>Graves looks at her. Tall and thin, dressed in unstylishly old but well-kept clothes, hat modest and bangs gradually straightening out of their attempt at a more stylish frizz, Porpentina Goldstein looks nothing like a police officer despite the badge on her jacket. Looks don’t signify: Tina is a matron, working at headquarters with prisoners of a female persuasion.</p><p>Though some people sneer, Graves never does. It takes a great deal of skill and courage to work on the police force, even for a matron. For instance, following the example of Britain, they <em>do </em>use Dementors for prisoner escort to larger penitentiaries, which means that every official has to be able to cast a Patronus Charm. It’s a difficult spell, one that many patrolmen can’t cast, and Tina can do it with aplomb. In another time, Tina might have been a patrolwoman: Graves hasn’t quite managed to overcome bureaucracy to make that happen yet.</p><p>“You’re here because I need someone watching my back,” Graves says, returning his gaze to the entrance of the bank.</p><p>“Why not bring a regular constable?” Tina persists. “You know what people say about me, Mr. Graves. The sort of person always turning up where I’m not wanted.”</p><p>He’s not particularly comfortable with this conversation, but it seems he’ll have to have it anyway, with Tina insisting. Graves looks at her again, this time with sympathy, and smiles. “Right now, Miss Goldstein, that is <em>exactly </em>the kind of person I need.”</p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p>“I mean that you’ve proven yourself trustworthy,” Graves says. He sighs. He’s very bad at this sort of conversation, but the moment has come to be honest. “You’ve stopped two jailbreaks, fought off three Dementors, and handle twice an ordinary patrolman’s workload, all on half the regular salary. There are patrolmen of thirty years who I wouldn’t trust to light a cigarette, but I’d bet on you to chase down the worst outlaw any day.”</p><p>She objects: “But—”</p><p>He can’t have her thinking like this when they’re on an assignment, so he cuts her off. “I don’t know why you stay with us, Goldstein, with all you put up with. But I’m damn grateful.”</p><p>Tina looks like she’s choked on whatever she was going to say, and doesn’t say it.</p><p>Just as if she were one of his regular patrolmen, Graves claps her on the shoulder. She doesn’t need the other part—the part that knows for a fact that Tina isn’t on anyone else’s payroll, and that she’s therefore more trustworthy than anyone else. He’s just glad that she’s here.</p><p>With a sigh, wondering what kind of person this missing heir will turn out to be, Graves turns back to the entrance, and waits.</p><p>***</p><p>The arrival at the docking tower leaves Credence with a harum-scarum impression of the city right from the start. There are porters to carry bags, wealthy people going up and down the elevators, all kinds of chaos. It’s golden and glittering and beautiful. Credence can barely believe that he’s here, that he’s in New York, soon to be one of the rich men of the city. Mr. Grindelwald seems perfectly at home, his manner impeccable, his speech cultured as he brushes shoulders with all the city. Though his clothes are all new, Credence feels small and shabby by the man’s side.</p><p>From the docking tower, they take a cab to the bank. It’s in the middle of Manhattan Island, and Credence can’t stop gaping. The streets are glorious, a rush of people like he’s never seen. Streetcars clang away; people of every size and sort dash to and fro. He even spots a pair of well-dressed centaurs, courteously staying on the street as they make their way through the city.</p><p>“Here we are at last,” Mr. Grindelwald says, as the cab slows before the steps of a great marble edifice. This is a branch of the Gringotts Bank, founded in England and run by goblins. Though there are many other banks, run by ordinary people, it’s well-known that the best and brightest of the world keep their money in the hands of Gringotts.</p><p>Credence ascends the steps beside Mr. Grindelwald, feeling frighteningly like a thief. They enter the bank side by side to be greeted by two police, a man and—of all things—a woman. Credence might be inexperienced in the ways of the world, but a woman in the police is unheard-of. She wears a police badge, a dress of navy worsted serge that’s unstylishly narrow and lacks a significant bustle, and a plain flat-topped felt hat. And she’s not carrying a reticule. Next to the policeman, she looks about as uncomfortable as Credence feels right now. Looking at her thin, tense face and wide eyes, Credence instantly feels a kinship with her.</p><p>But she isn’t the one to greet them. The policeman steps forward, offering a hand. “Police Superintendent Percival Graves,” he says. Mr. Grindelwald shakes his hand and they exchange stilted pleasantries, but Credence misses the details. He’s too busy staring.</p><p>The Superintendent is, by any standards, an incredibly handsome man. He’s shorter than the woman with him, but broad of shoulder and deep of chest. Clean-shaven and already beginning to go just a little gray at the temples, he presents a perfect picture of late-middle-age manliness. His clothes are sharp and obviously expensive and beautifully made, though Credence has never seen anything like his dramatic coat before in his life. There’s a look of honesty in his eyes. He has an air of total command and, when he looks at Credence, a stunning smile.</p><p>All in all, he may quite possibly be the most beautiful man Credence has ever seen.</p><p>***</p><p>Graves is astounded by the young man. This Grindelwald man, apparently one of Kelly’s acquaintances, a generous supporter of Tammany Hall, is uncomfortable to look at. His eyes are unsettling. But his young charge is stunning. He’s perhaps as tall as Tina, taller than Graves, or he would be if he stood up straight. In form he looks reasonably athletic, and by any standard he’s well-proportioned. He’s only just, as Grindelwald informs Graves, of the age of majority, but something about his dark eyes suggests hard experience. His shy manner doesn’t hide his keen gazes, and he can’t possibly hide his lovely face. His hair is unstylishly long, but Graves thinks he looks magnificent with it.</p><p>Where on Earth did someone like Grindelwald turn up this young Adonis?</p><p>“Percival Graves,” Graves says, doing his best to be charming and actually smile. “And you are—?”</p><p>“Credence Barebone,” the young man says in a soft voice. He’s acting a bit like a deer among the hounds—and quite rightly, considering exactly what goes on in New York society. “It’s a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Graves.”</p><p>Graves introduces Tina, and though he sees some disdain in Grindelwald’s eyes the man still greets her charmingly. Barebone gifts her a genuine smile, really a dazzler, and Graves sees Tina’s eyes light up for the first time in weeks. It looks like they’ve hit it off already.</p><p>All of them are impatient, so little more time is wasted on pleasantries. When the greetings are over, Grindelwald goes straight up to a well-dressed goblin and informs him that this young man is the heir to the Faris family fortune.</p><p>The goblins are alarmed at Barebone’s appearance, although their alarm looks more like a profusion of whispers and a great battery of tests designed to confirm Credence’s identity than actual shock. His magical signature is tested, his memories are analyzed, and so on. After an hour or so, Barebone is declared to be exactly who he says he is, and is allowed to lay claim to his fortune.</p><p>One might expect it to be an occasion of joy, but Barebone looks more frightened than delighted. Graves has a great deal of sympathy for the young man: he looks utterly stunned by the windfall. Given the hints of his background that Graves has heard or guessed, he’s never had more than perhaps a dollar at a time in his whole life.</p><p>“Nearly forty-two million dollars,” Grindelwald says, clapping Barebone on the shoulder where he sits at a desk, signing page after page of paperwork. “A fortune! If wisely invested or donated to the appropriate philanthropies…”</p><p>“I believe it’s up to Mr. Barebone,” Graves cuts in mildly. Something about this Grindelwald character disturbs him, though he can’t put his finger on what.</p><p>Grindelwald smiles, though it doesn’t reach his eyes. “Quite right,” he says.</p><p>Barebone looks up at Graves and smiles, and at the sight Graves gets the distinct feeling that this is not the end of his dealings with the young man.</p><p>***</p><p>Mr. Graves and Mr. Grindelwald both head off in separate directions shortly after Credence has signed the papers. Mr. Grindelwald suggests that Credence perhaps look into acquiring new clothes, things a little more refined than he currently possesses; Mr. Graves, after a moment’s consideration, leaves Miss Goldstein with him. “Not as an escort,” he assures, “but you look like you need a guide.”</p><p>And then they’re gone, off on their own business, and Credence and Miss Goldstein are left staring at each other in blank astonishment.</p><p>“This has been the strangest day,” Miss Goldstein says, just as Credence says, “I’ve never had a day like this before—”</p><p>She laughs when he stops, flummoxed, and nudges him with her elbow in a companionable kind of way. “We’re both a bit out of our depth,” she says. “I like the suggestion of shopping. Shall we?”</p><p>“We shall,” Credence says, relieved by her confidence, and offers his arm to her. She takes it with a faint blush and off they go.</p><p>New York is <em>terrific.</em> The streets bustle, the buildings rise high. On street corners are newspaper boys, some not too much younger than Credence, hawking the latest papers. Even the shabbiest women seem to shine with some inner glamor, some understanding that this is a great city and they are part of all of it. Or maybe that’s just the stars in his eyes.</p><p>They’re near enough to the “Ladies’ Mile”, that great block of department stores, that it’s not too bad of a walk. Tina carries herself boldly, but Credence can tell she’s as nervous as he is. Her shoulders are set high and her gaze flicks about constantly. And with good reason: the people here are incredibly grand and dashing. Handsome women in day dresses of all colors with beautiful hats, gentlemen engaged in business or so wealthy they’re simply at their leisure. Everyone going somewhere. No one ever stopping.</p><p>Tina suggests Lord &amp; Taylor’s and Credence agrees. It’s a chaos of shopping, and he hardly knows what to buy, but there are people to help and he accepts their offers gratefully. All the assistants are able hands with tailoring magic, and in short order Credence has perfectly suitable clothes.</p><p>Only once does he deviate from “necessary” spending—he sees Tina looking rather wistfully at a dove-gray jacket with two rows of steel buttons; he quietly slips it into their purchases and decides to give it to her later. There’s a certain thrill in being able to simply give her something like this. He likes her, even though they were only acquainted this morning.</p><p>After some discussion on the sidewalk, they decide that they ought to go to Tiffany &amp; Company to look for a good watch. Credence has their bag—everything fits because of the Undetectable Extension Charm cast upon it—on one arm and Tina’s arm in his other.</p><p>He’s not really paying attention to anything but the orderly chaos of the streets when Tina shouts, pushes him aside, flings up her wand, and casts a Shield Charm. A spell ricochets off the shield, cast out of nowhere. People are screaming in panic and Tina is yelling at him, telling him to hang on, and turning in place as they Apparate right out of the middle of the street.</p>
