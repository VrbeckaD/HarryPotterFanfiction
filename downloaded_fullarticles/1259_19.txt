The friend group are in their dormitory and James isn't very happy.</p><p>Sirius asked, "What's up, Prongs?"</p><p>James muttered, "It's nothing."</p><p>Peter said, "We know you better than anybody, something is up today."</p><p>James turned to Remus and told him, "I realised that what you said was right, I am arrogant; Moony. That's why Lily doesn't want to go out with me."</p><p>Remus sighed. "I never meant to make you sad, Prongs. I just wanted you to know that your attitude isn't always the best."</p><p>James frowned. "How can I change? I want to be with Lily, but I'll never have a chance."</p><p>Sirius disagreed, "That's not true, you just need to be less... You."</p><p>Peter shook his head and replied, "Just be yourself."</p><p>Remus shouted, "No, no, no! Listen to me, Prongs. You need to be less arrogant, but still be you."</p><p>James inquired, "How do I do that?"</p><p>Remus smiled. "I can help you, we all can." He smirked. "Yes, even Padfoot."</p></div>
