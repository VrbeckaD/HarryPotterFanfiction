    <p>It was a hot summer night. Althought all the windows were open in the claustrophobic apartament, there was no breeze to cool the two men inside - that didn’t seem to bother either, however.</p><p>    The first, a tall and dark-haired man, was sitting in a slim old bed, a handful of letters next to him waiting for their turns to be read. In the other side of the room, in a worn out chair, there sat another blond, joyfull man; he was entertained, flipping carelessly  throught the pages of an ancient book resting on an equally ancient table.</p><p>    “Abraxas, could you please be careful  with this book? I merely borrowed it from Borgin &amp; Burkes, so if you damage it…” The dark-haired man didn’t end, instead closed the letter he had been reading and reached for the next one.</p><p>    “Then I'll buy it, Tom. Such a simple solution to a seemingly horrible problem, no?” The blond man, Abraxas, answered with a smile playing in the corners of his lips. However, he started to turn the pages more slowly.</p><p>    “Oh, Dolohov will remain in Russia for another week.” Tom spoke after a moment, sighing heavily. “How hard can it be to convince Khrushchov to hand him the Globe?”</p><p>    “I imagine it must be pretty hard. You know how that old comunist can be, when he wants,” Abraxas stopped mid-page, tilting his head slightly. Suddenly, a smile broke in his face. “Ah! Finally, I found it! Tom, I found it!”</p><p>    Tom immediatly jumped to his feet, the previous letter rushing to the ground, now forgotten.</p><p>    “About time!” He approached the other in a couple of steps. He hovered over him for a moment, reading the page over Abraxas’s shoulder. “Bla bla bla, where is it? Oh, there” He mumbled to himself. In a quick move, he lifted the book with one hand. A few pages detached from the worn out cover and fell to the ground. </p><p>    “Well, who is the careless now?” Abraxas wondered aloud, resting his cheek on his hand as he watched Tom closely. The other man ignored him, instead chosing to read from the paper in his hands.</p><p>    <i>“Near Korab Mountain, in the Dibër District, there are numerous small villages. The locals have been passing legends and histories about their cultures from generation after generation. One of them is about a spirit who lived in the forests for many years. The spirit, who they have called Raven, presented itself as young girl who had been murdered by her promissed lover after she ran way, and now is doomed to live among the living, as a way to pay for the crime she commited against her family. This history is told likely to stop local girls from fleeing the marriages arranged by their families. Some of the more ancient habitants say that the spirit’s lover also ghost around Korab Mountain, where he penitences himself for the murder.”</i> Tom quoted. He looked up from the book to his friend, and then back to the book. “Brax, this is it! What I’ve been looking for so long! The location of where Helena hid the Diadem.”</p><p>    It was Abraxas’ turn to jump to his feet, standing next to Tom with a forced laugh.</p><p>    “Wow, there. The book merely states the spirit of a girl, who could or could not be Helena, has once upon a time lived near Korab Mountain, which, althought a great improvement from the ‘somewhere in Albania’, is still a pretty wide area to look for a specif tree.”</p><p>    Tom was still reading the page, his eyes flying throught the words, seemingly deaf to the man’s reasoning.</p><p>    “Well, I can cut out the higher parts of the Korab, because no tree can survive those conditions, which leaves me with less ground to search…” Tom whispered, bitting his lips. Abraxas rolled his eyes and pulled the book from the other’s hands.</p><p>    Tom jerked his head up and looked to his friend between narrow eyes.</p><p>    “What the fuck are you doing?”</p><p>    “Uh, I don’t know, trying to force some sense inside your big head?” He answered, tapping Tom’s head with a finger. “You can’t just decide to travel to Albania with no warning. You need to prepare yourself! Know your ground. You also need to leave things sorted with the Death Eaters, create ways to talk and meet you, even with us continents apart.”</p><p>    Tom opened his mouth, but no sound came out. He closed it again, blinking repeatly. Eventualy, he sighed, going back to the bed, steping on the letters on the ground.</p><p>    “Of course, you’re right.” He sat, his hands on his face. “I got carried away. Our project’s too importanto to leave it unattended for what could take years.”</p><p>    “Exactly,” Abraxas agreed, shaking his head. He ignored Tom had just said he could be away for longer tham some months. The man crossed the space between them, kneeling in from of Tom. “Don’t worry, you’ll have plenty of time to find the Diadem, but you have to be a responsible leader here.”</p><p>    Tom looked up from his hands, a smile in the corner of his lips. He leaned closer to Abraxas, kissing his forehead gently.</p><p>    “Who would’ve thought that you, of all people, would be the voice of reason?” At this, Abraxas laughed.</p><p>    “Well, someone has to be the rational part of the relationship, I suppose.” He answered, pulling his face up just enough so his lips would meet Tom’s.</p><p>    They didn’t speak for another hour.</p>
