    <p>Snape preferred to work in solitude, which was completely expected of someone like him. Hermione, who has finished her detention work long ago, watched the professor work from the front row of the classroom, twirling her quill in one hand and resting her chin on the other. She let out a short yawn, hoping the professor would catch on and realize he had already kept her an extra 15 minutes late after class.</p>
<p>Small pops and sizzles escaped the cauldron as Snape poured yet another strange brightly colored liquid inside. None of the flasks were labeled, which she assumed had been intentional, making it impossible to guess what he was working on. She wondered if she dared to speak up and risk him take house points away for 'obstinacy' or whatever other stupid reason he came up with. Rolling her eyes she cleared her throat and finally spoke up, "um, excuse me. Professor?"</p>
<p>He paused in place, hovering above his work for the slightest second, then quickly went back to what he was working on before.</p>
<p>Again, she noted, it was very very like him to clearly be so uninterested in what she had to say, or anyone for that matter. Not bothering to hide the irritation in her voice this time she spoke up again, "Professor Snape, if I don't leave her now I won't make it to the Quidditch game. It's beginning in—"</p>
<p>"I guess you'll have to miss it then Miss Granger if you cannot keep your mouth shut during detention."</p>
<p>She quickly closed her mouth and exhaled loudly through her nostrils. "Yes, professor."</p>
<p>A few silent minutes passed of Snape working alone and Hermione desperately trying to keep herself awake before he spoke up again. Hermione jumped back in her chair, surprised at the sudden request. "But, I suppose if you want to make yourself useful in the meanwhile you can go fetch me a bag from my supply closet down the hall."</p>
<p>Hermione mindlessly stood up from her chair slowly pacing herself forward to retrieve the supply close keys from him, not really thinking a proper response to his request. She blamed her obedience on her tiredness, but in the end decided it wasn't like she had much of a choice to begin with. Upon receiving the key her hand lightly brushed across his, it being rougher and warmer then she had imagine. Professor Snape was a very stiff, cold-blooded person. Was it silly of her to assume his body was as cold as he came off? Realizing the awkwardness of the thought she quickly shook her head and hurried down to the supply closet.</p>
<p>As everything else in Hogwarts was, the door to the supply closet was ancient. The wood was splitting in in random places and dark rot could be seen peeking through the splits. Hesitant, she stuck the key in the large bold lock and opened the door.</p>
<p>The room itself wasn't that big, it was about the size of the average walk-in closet. She thought back on what the professor had instructed her on finding. Biting her lip, she searched around the small space looking for the alleged 'bag'. She really wished she had been awake enough to ask him to specify. In the back of the middle shelf she spotted a small cloth bag. It being to only bag in the room she assumed it was the one. There being no space to move anything out of the way she carefully stuck her hand past more of Snape's notorious unlabeled jars and pulled it out.</p>
<p>Her heart skipped a beat and in a flash she was stumbling back, tripping on something that was just out of eyesight. She caught herself on one of the shelves before she fell. She was surprised Snape hadn't already come rushing in to deduct points with all the noise she made knocking things over. In a daze she quickly gathered everything together and shoved it back on the shelf. She grabbed the rest of the stuff that had fallen out of the bag, threw it back in and rushed back to the classroom.</p>
<p>She desperately wanted to turn back around and do a better job of cleaning, what she just did was something she would scold the hell out of the boys for doing, but she was already standing in the doorway.</p>
<p>"Well, do you have it? What are you waiting for?"</p>
<p>She handed over the bag and looked toward her desk, hanging her head in shame and preparing to head back over.</p>
<p>"You're not done yet, I require your assistance." He handed her back the bag and turned back to his work. "I need you to pull a few things out for me that I have neither the time nor patience to look for myself. The things are listed above on the chalkboard."</p>
<p>Hermione did as she was told, refusing to look up at him. She tried to concentrate at the task at hand and began fishing her arm in the bag. She managed to find the first few items by trial and error. Pulling things back in and out, over and over again. She had gotten use to the familiar shapes of everything in the bag until she came across something odd. She couldn't quite piece what she felt together, and her curiosity getting the best of her, she pulled it out.</p>
<p>"What's taking so—" He stopped mid-sentence. His expression just as shocked as Hermione's. She didn't know why she could properly identify such an object but it appeared to be some kind of flogger. She gasped, holding it a second to long before throwing it back into the back</p>
<p>"I-I—" she stammered, awkwardly meeting his gaze.</p>
<p>"It-it's for those damned beasts Hagrid's loves to parade around." He sounded so uncharacteristically nervous, it was unnerving.</p>
<p>"Y-yes, of course."</p>
<p>He cleared his throat before snatching the bag out of her hands. "Wrong bag Miss Granger, but I'm somehow not surprised."</p>
<p>"I've had enough of your help today. Please come back tomorrow to finish your detention."</p>
<p>She nodded, finding herself at a complete loss of words. She quickly gathered her stuff together and dashed out of the classroom.</p>
