          <div class="userstuff"><p>Remus rushes home to find Sirius sitting on the sofa, the curtains drawn, a glass in his hand, a bottle at his feet. He already knows, then. Remus takes a deep breath.</p><p>
“Do you want to talk about it?”
</p><p>
Sirius shakes his head.
</p><p>
“Say, do you want a glass of this?” he asks, in a conversational tone. “I broke into the really good stuff. It seemed, you know, appropriate.”
</p><p>
“Go on, then,” says Remus, joining him on the sofa. Sirius conjures a second glass, fills it with a generous amount of liquor, hands it to Remus with a flourish. 
</p><p>
“To my brother!” he toasts, in mock solemnity. “The idiot. May he rest in peace.”
</p><p>

</p><p>
Later, once the sun has set and they have drunk the last of the liquor, Remus gets up and draws a bath for Sirius. 
</p><p>
“You don't have to do this,” says Sirius, leaning against the doorway. “I'm fine, really.”
</p><p>
“I know,” says Remus. “But I want to. C'mere.”
</p><p>
Sirius steps into the bathroom, kisses Remus briefly on the lips, and takes his t-shirt off. There's a slightly acrid note to his usually very pleasant scent. Remus puts his arms around him and holds him tightly, despite Sirius' half-hearted protests. They hug for a long time.

“We had a toy Giant Squid,” says Sirius, bending forward to let Remus scrub his back. “When we were really small, for our bathtime. Brilliant little thing, lots of fun. I <i>think</i> I remember my father getting it for us, but that can't be right. It must have been my aunt. Funny how it just popped up in my mind, I hadn't thought about it for at least fifteen years.”
</p><p>
Remus hums, rinses the washcloth, sets it down on the rim of the bathtub, rinses Sirius' soapy back.
</p><p>
“Do you want me to wash your hair for you?”
</p><p>
Sirius looks up, his eyes red – but then again, they always get a bit irritated when he bathes. He smiles at Remus. There's a tangible shift in the cloudy atmosphere of the bathroom.
</p><p>
“Yes, please,” he says, tilting his head back, his eyes closed. “Say, what do you want to do for dinner? I could go for Chinese.”</p></div>
