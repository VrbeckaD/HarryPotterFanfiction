  <span>Chapter 1: A Chance Meeting</span>

  <em>
    <span>“I was never really insane except upon occasions when my heart was touched.” – Edgar Allan Poe</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Had anyone told him that one day he, Draco Lucius Malfoy, would be trapped under a sprig of enchanted mistletoe with none other than the so-called Brightest Witch of her Age, swotty saviour and mudblood third of Gryffindor’s ‘Golden Trio’ Hermione Granger, he would have thought them mad. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>After all, he and Granger had long hated each other. He’d called her a ‘filthy little mudblood’ at school, and she’d punched him in the face, daring to strike the heir to two of Britain’s Sacred 28 magical families. How he’d hated her for that! He’d spent months fantasizing about enacting some form of revenge, some sort of public humiliation to punish her. Somewhere along the line, in his hormone-ridden teenage brain, thoughts of revenge morphed into increasingly dark fantasies in which Gryffindor’s mudblood princess was on her knees in the Hogwarts dungeons, tears streaming down her face as he finally shut her up by shoving his cock down her throat. His father would have punished him severely for even thinking of sullying himself with a mudblood, but Draco consoled himself with the idea that if he was going to inflict his sadistic desires on a witch, better a mudblood than a proper pureblooded girl who was entitled to his respect and courteous treatment.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Then the Dark Lord returned, and survival moved to the forefront of his mind, displacing thoughts of dominating a certain bushy-haired know-it-all. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He’d spent time in Azkaban after the war and then on house arrest at his family’s ancestral home in Wiltshire after Aurors had stripped it of dark objects and more than a couple of benign but priceless antiques, although he’d never been able to get the Department of Magical Law Enforcement to even investigate </span>
  <em>
    <span>that</span>
  </em>
  <span> thievery. It had been open season on the Malfoy family after the war, and newly appointed Minister for Magic Kingsley Shacklebolt had been all too happy to raid the Malfoy coffers as “reparations.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Once house arrest ended, he’d not been especially welcomed by post-war magical Britain, and so he’d kept to himself, quietly rebuilding the Malfoy family’s businesses and investments through a mix of legal and illegal means. It wasn’t easy, but he’d learned from Lucius Malfoy how to lie, cheat, and steal and how to bribe even the most seemingly ethical of Ministry officials and members of the Wizengamot. Everyone had a price, and everyone had a weakness. That was a lesson his father taught him long before his last kiss from a dementor following the war.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Thurlby Wiggenworth’s price was pods from the rare Prigger’s Porritch plant. The lumpy blue pods were poisonous and volatile and used in a minute handful of obscure potions, most of them illegal. What the head of the Department of International Magical Cooperation wanted with the three precious pods, Draco neither knew nor cared. It was fortuitous then that the forest on the grounds of Malfoy Manor held some of the only known Prigger’s Porritch plants in all of Great Britain. Regulation of such a dangerous plant was strict, and the Ministry had made it all but impossible for Draco to even consider cultivating the plants for sale, but that was a problem for some other time. For now he was content to use the pods as payment for Wiggenworth to sign off on a series of documents that would allow him to import rare potions ingredients unavailable in Britain and export the resulting potions without arousing suspicion or incurring steep tariffs. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It was late when he left Wiggenworth’s office with a stack of signed import and export certificates tucked safely in his robe pocket. Unlike some of his more openly nefarious contacts, Wiggenworth had a sterling reputation he didn’t want besmirched should anyone see him meeting with a former Death Eater. The old codger stupidly thought it was safer to meet at the Ministry after hours, as if Draco didn’t already know exactly where the wizard lived. Knowledge was power, knowledge and Galleons, and Draco had plenty of both of those. And one day, one day he would have the power to reclaim the Malfoy family’s place at the pinnacle of power in magical Britain, and he would pay them all back in kind, everyone who’d wronged him or his family. </span>
</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="center">
  <span>~oOo~</span>
</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p>
  <span>He traversed the Ministry’s empty halls in silence, the normal clacking of his dragonhide shoes on the marble floors muffled by a spell, his bribe delivered and next steps on his mind. He’d not been able to get close enough to Shackelbolt to bribe him, which was a pity because having the Minister in his pocket was a natural fit for a Malfoy. Wiggleworth and the lone security guard who was easily bribed with a small bag of Galleons each time Draco needed to slip into the building undetected were the only people Draco had seen in the Ministry this late at night, so he allowed himself the rare luxury of getting lost in his thoughts as he walked. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It was for this reason that he didn’t notice the witch coming down the hallway toward him, carrying a stack of books, files, and parchments so high it obscured her vision, until they literally collided with one another. The load she carried tumbled from her arms upon impact. Instinctively, he grabbed her upper arm to steady her and prevent her from falling backwards onto the cold marble floor, even as he barked out a harsh “Watch where you’re going!” at her.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh my god! I’m so sorry!” the witch pushed out in a soft but breathy voice, her tone deeply apologetic. “I didn’t expect to see anyone here this… Malfoy? Is that you? What are you doing here?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco blinked and finally looked at the witch whose arm he still held in his grasp. She was dressed in plain, shapeless camel-coloured robes, and her brown hair was pulled back in what might have been some sort of style, were it not for the quill sticking out of her hair in the back. A few curls escaped from her haphazard hairstyle, framing a bare face that would never be classically beautiful. But her eyes… her eyes were oddly captivating. Deep brown, framed by long, dark lashes. Her eyes sparked with life, and to his surprise he found himself almost entranced.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Malfoy? Did you hear me? Let go of me!” she hissed, jerking her arm from his grasp.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>And then he recognised her. Like a torrential wave crashing down heavily upon him, he recognised her and realised that for the first time in years, Hermione Granger stood before him with an irritated look on her face. In that moment, memories rushed to the forefront of his mind of her sharp tongue - and just how he’d once dreamed of putting it to good use. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Well?” she snapped. “Only employees are allowed in the building after hours. Does security know you’re here?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He pulled himself from a momentary stupor at her ire. “I had a meeting that ran late. Nothing to concern </span>
  <em>
    <span>you</span>
  </em>
  <span>,” he said snidely, resisting the urge to throw in a ‘mudblood’ at her for old time’s sake. It was a new world, and such terms were verboten now, which was a pity because he had fond memories of how that single word made her eyes flash like lightning and her hair spark with magic in a way that was strangely appealing.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She was standing abnormally close to him, which he thought odd. He folded his arms across his chest, inadvertently brushing his forearm lightly against her breast, making her gasp and lean away from him. Curiously enough, she didn’t step back from him as he’d expected. If she wasn’t going to get out of his personal space, then he’d move back. It wasn’t exactly a power move, stepping back from a witch like that, but he figured he could always call her a mudblood to make up for it. Except that when he tried to move, he found himself somehow rooted to the ground, unable to lift his feet.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>A spell of some kind at play, then, he thought.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What are YOU doing here at this late hour, and why in the name of Merlin are you in my personal space?” he said imperiously. “I realise I am significantly more attractive than that inbred Weasel who sniffs after you, but if you desire that sort of… </span>
  <em>
    <span>personal attention</span>
  </em>
  <span>… you’re going to have to make a better effort of it.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He gazed down at her with a hard stare, and something inside of him sparked when she caught his innuendo and glared up at him. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“If I </span>
  <em>
    <span>what</span>
  </em>
  <span>? Don’t kid yourself Malfoy. I want nothing to do with your ‘personal attention’ or anything else related to you or your twisted family!” she fumed. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She reached up with both hands and shoved him, a pointless muggle attempt to push him away from her. This, he thought to himself, was why mudbloods were pathetic and weak - they always automatically went for a muggle solution.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Release me from your curse then,” he said loftily.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Her brow wrinkled in confusion. “I didn’t curse you. Don’t be daft.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He raised a pale eyebrow at her and then mimicked her movement: touching the front of her shoulders with his fingertips and pushing her backward with more force than she’d used with him. He was rewarded by her obvious struggle to maintain her balance, as well as a shriek of outrage at both his action and the realisation that she couldn’t lift her feet from the ground to step away from him. She ranted at him then for running into her and for shoving her, and probably for various and sundry other things, although he quickly lost interest in whatever she was saying and instead chose to glance at their surroundings. Her books, files, and sheets of parchment had scattered in all directions on the floor. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Typical mudblood, he thought, forgetting that she could shrink all that down and put it in her robe pocket. Had she done so, she would not have run into him and he wouldn’t be here, stuck to the floor, listening to her bitch about Merlin only knew what. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The hall was deserted. No one else was there at nearly midnight. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco sighed deeply and tilted his head upward as she continued to whinge about… honestly, he’d stopped listening and had no idea what her problem was.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Then he saw it. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Mistletoe.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>A small sprig of it hung from the ceiling, directly over them. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He’d noticed the beginnings of holiday decor going up in the Ministry lobby when he arrived this evening. Someone was clearly ahead of schedule if they were already stringing up mistletoe around the building.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Fuck,” he breathed out. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It was enough to distract Granger, and she followed his gaze upward. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Is that...</span>
  <em>
    <span>NO</span>
  </em>
  <span>!” she shrieked, making Draco wince at the shrill sound so close to his ear. “I told them last year - I told </span>
  <em>
    <span>all of them</span>
  </em>
  <span>! It’s sexual harassment! It’s utter tripe holding people hostage until they kiss just because they happened to walk underneath it! I am filing another complaint with Kingsley over this!” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He wondered if her outrage was based on the principle of enchanted mistletoe, or if she’d been trapped by it elsewhere in the building and forced to kiss some smarmy old wizard. If it was the latter, he couldn’t blame her. Magical mistletoe could be either a blessing or a dreadful curse, depending on who was trapped with you or who came to your rescue. A simple </span>
  <em>
    <span>finite incantatem</span>
  </em>
  <span> wasn’t enough to force the plant to release its captives. Without an appropriately passionate kiss, the spell would hold its victims in place for hours on end before eventually dissipating. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco did not especially want to kiss the swottiest of all mudbloods - despite being a war hero, he still thought her beneath him, not to mention so absurdly uptight he doubted she could inspire much in the way of passion - but he also had no intention of standing there all night. Simply being in the Ministry hall in the morning would arouse too many suspicions and might lead to questions from Aurors or yet another investigation into his business dealings. For better or worse though, standing there so close to her with his level of irritation rising was bringing back a few of his memories and twisted fantasies from school. It was definitely for the best, he decided, to just kiss her and be on his way before he was tempted to hex her.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I suppose it’s your lucky day, mudblood,” he sneered. “I have better things to do than stand here all night waiting for someone else to come round in the morning. Pucker up, Granger, and use your tongue. I like it better that way.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He reached for her then, hoping to kiss her before she could react. From the shocked look on her face, it was clear standing there all night would have been her preferred choice. She shoved at him, trying to push away his hands and turn her face from him, but he was bigger and stronger. He gripped the back of her head and tangled his fingers in her hair. With his other hand, he tried to grab her wrists as she attempted to push him away. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Her lips were clenched tightly together, and she made angry mumbling noises as he pressed his lips to hers. They were pink and plump and softer than he expected, and he found himself annoyed that Granger was too much of a prude to welcome his kiss. She ought to be on her knees thanking him for the privilege! Besides, a mere peck on the lips was not nearly enough to release them.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He bit down hard on her bottom lip, and her resulting shriek of pain went straight to his groin.  He was able to thrust his tongue into her mouth then, crushing her much smaller body against his. He wasn’t sure what he expected of her physique beneath the baggy robes, so he was pleasantly surprised to discover a slender figure with firm breasts. He’d initially kissed her with the thought of breaking the spell - with the added perk of annoying her as well - but as his tongue ruthlessly plumbed the depths of her mouth, his dick responded accordingly, turned on by the thrill of subduing her, hurting her, and taking what he wanted. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>To his immense surprise, she responded to his kiss, even as she struggled in his hold, unaware that her movement and the way her body rubbed against his was only making the kiss more thrilling to him. His hand slid down her lower back to cup her arse, pushing her into him. Granger had a surprisingly fantastic arse, and he couldn’t help but wonder what she’d look like naked. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The spell had long-since released them, but he wasn’t keen on releasing her. Instead, he moved with her, slipping out from under the enchanted plant to press her up against the cold, hard wall and trap her there. He reached for the hem of her robes and shoved them up slender thighs. To his surprise, Granger was wearing stockings instead of the modest tights he’d expected. Clearly he’d misjudged her at least in part - she wasn’t quite the prude he’d expected. He groaned and dug his nails into her soft skin before finally releasing her lips so he could bite at her earlobe and neck. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He’d intended to kiss her and briefly indulge in a bit of his childhood fantasy, but now he couldn’t stop. Something within him spurred him on, encouraging him to take what he wanted from her. No one else was around, and she’d quit fighting him. He could fuck her hard and fast up against the wall in the middle of a Ministry hallway, and no one was there to stop him. She was </span>
  <em>
    <span>his</span>
  </em>
  <span>. The very thought was intoxicating. He knew he normally had more self-control than this, but something spurred him on, reluctant to give up the filthy mudblood in his arms.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“STOP IT! Stop!” she cried out, panic clear in her voice as she shoved against him. “Malfoy, let go of me!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He bit her earlobe and felt her shudder. “You like it, Granger. You kissed me back.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“No! I don’t!” It was a gasp. Breathy. He liked the way it sounded.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He forced her legs apart and ground against her. She might be saying no, but if the heat between her legs was anything to go by, she was far more turned on than she wanted to admit. He palmed a full breast and felt her nipple pebble beneath her clothes. Yes, she was definitely turned on, even if she didn’t want to admit it. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He shamelessly rutted against her like a man possessed, desperate to have her in a way he rarely desired a woman. She was still protesting, even as she arched into his touch. Somewhere in the back of his mind, it occurred to him that his reaction to Granger was abnormal, but he couldn’t be arsed to care. He’d think about it later. For now he was too distracted by the idea of fucking her into the wall.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He didn’t see her attack coming. One moment he had his hand on her breast and another up under her skirt and sliding up her thigh, and the next moment, he was blasted across the hall until he stumbled into the opposite wall.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Granger had her wand out, pointed at him as she panted and straightened her clothes.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“What the hell are you doing?”</span>
  </em>
  <span> she hissed at him.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He felt oddly pained at her rejection, but a Malfoy did not show weakness. He smoothed his own clothes, his posture rigid. “I freed us both from a miserable night stuck under enchanted mistletoe. Surely you’re smart enough to realise I did us both a favour,” he sneered.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She </span>
  <em>
    <span>accio</span>
  </em>
  <span>’d her stack of parchments and books and finally realised she was a witch and could shrink said items. The tiny bundle disappeared into her robe pocket. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You… you </span>
  <em>
    <span>groped</span>
  </em>
  <span> me! That was </span>
  <em>
    <span>wholly</span>
  </em>
  <span> unnecessary to release the spell, and you know it! You had no right to touch me like that!” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She had a wild-eyed look of fear and fury about her, but she was still breathless. He could see a red mark forming on the slender column of her neck where he’d sucked the sensitive skin. Her robe was still slightly askew, and he was certain that if he’d been able to get his hand into her knickers, he would have found her wet and wanting. He had to bite back a groan at the thought of touching her so intimately.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Instead, he smirked and casually strolled back toward her, pausing to look her up and down lasciviously. “You know what your problem is, Granger?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I really don’t care what you think my </span>
  <em>
    <span>problem</span>
  </em>
  <span> is, Malfoy,” she said, raising her chin defiantly at him.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He reached out and stroked a fingertip down her cheek, ignoring the way she flinched away from him. Then he leaned in toward her so he could whisper in her ear. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Your problem is that you </span>
  <em>
    <span>liked </span>
  </em>
  <span>it. You want me, and we both know it.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She stiffened in response, obviously offended by his observation.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Then she slapped him across the face - hard - and stomped off, leaving him smirking at her retreating form. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>This wasn’t over. Not by a long shot.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
