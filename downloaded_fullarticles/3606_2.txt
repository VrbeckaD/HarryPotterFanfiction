    <p>Hermione sat on the train with Ginny on her way back to Hogwarts to finish her education. Both Harry and Ron accepted the Ministry’s employment solicitation. She wanted to be happy for them, but she was still annoyed that they had opted out of graduating properly, not to mention how much they had all grown to hate the Ministry. She pulled out her copy of that morning’s Daily Prophet while Ginny went off to find a few of her friends. The second page contained an article that caught her eye.  </p><p>“A Journalist’s Journey to Becoming an Animagus” By Rita Skeeter:<br/>
After nearly a year of hard work and determination, I am proud to announce that I have earned my spot on the animagus registry.</p><p>Hermione immediately gawked at the article. What a filthy liar, she thought. Someone must have forced her to out herself. Hermione shook her head and went on to page three.</p><p>	“Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry Hires First Fit Defense Against the Dark Arts Teacher in Over a Decade” By Rita Skeeter:<br/>
Current Headmistress, Minerva McGonagall, will be welcoming Darvin Brown to the staff tomorrow. Mr. Brown has a firm understanding of the art of self defense and plans to utilize a hands-on approach to educating our community’s youth. When asked how he felt about the previous instructors appointed to the position, he explained, “I’m appalled at how this class has been handled in the past. Had the students been more prepared, more would have survived the attack on the school this past May. Many perished who didn’t have to and not just because the Headmaster failed to secure the school properly. I find it a great relief that Minerva has stepped up to take over as Headmaster of the school. I’m sure many parent had doubts about allowing their children to return to Hogwarts until they learned they would be safe under the protection of a fierce Gryffindor once again.</p><p>“Wow,” Hermione said aloud to no one. She couldn’t believe this Darvin would come across as so hostile before he’d even taught his first class. Then again, who knows what he really told Skeeter. </p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>Severus Snape begrudgingly returned to Hogwarts to resume the post of potions master after the war ended upon Minerva Mcgonagall’s request. Truth be told, he really didn’t know what else to do with his life. He had expected not to survive the downfall of the Dark Lord. He should have died. He should have been left to be at peace, but no! That insufferable bloody Granger girl had slowed his exsanguinations in spite of believing him to be a ruthless murdering Death Eater. Only Hermione bleeding-heart Granger, founder of SPEW, would have had the gall to help him, and she was there when he was supposed to have died! Infuriating girl! </p><p>It took a few weeks to get settled back in to the relaxed position of only being a professor. He knew he had it easy this time around. There was no Longbottom constantly on the verge of blowing up his classroom, and there wasn’t a Potter in sight. Hermione Granger was the only one of the troublesome three to return to Hogwarts to finish her seventh year apparently. Aside from occasionally seeing Granger with the Weasley girl, she mostly kept to herself. Even during class, she showed little enthusiasm. Her work was as diligent as ever, but something had changed about her. Perhaps it was because she’d lost her other cohorts. Although, it could be that war had changed her, as it had changed them all. </p><p>Severus had rounds the first Thursday evening of term, and he was exhausted by the time he was done.  Unsure if he still had it in him to continue teaching, he questioned his decision to remain at the school. He knew Minerva had gotten several letters requesting his resignation before term even started. That new twat monkey, Darvin, seemed to really have it out for him. He had apparently been a Gryffindor who graduated just a few years before Severus started at Hogwarts. Minerva was on his side, and that was really all that mattered to him. Thinking about how hard the last school year had been with her loathing him was starting to give him a migraine. Hoping to ease his aching muscles, he headed toward the staff bathroom on the second floor. It had an ancient hot tub in it that he had never taken advantage of before, even though he had been tempted many times. Normally, no one used it for lack of privacy, but it was after midnight. </p><p>Severus entered the bathroom rubbing his neck and walked up to the tub. He turned and cast a locking charm on the door to ensure no unwanted visitors interrupted him.  The room was quite a luxury actually. It looked more like a locker-room with a spacious steam room off to the side ready for anyone in need of it. He bent down to take off his boots when he noticed a small amount of water on the floor. That’s curious, he thought. His eyes followed the almost elusive trail of water into the steam room. </p><p>Hominum Revielo, he silently cast. He was not alone. He slowly stood, wand clenched tight in hand. His eyes swept the room but found no one. What he did find, however, was a small pile of clothing up against the wall on the other side of the hot tub. His eyes lingered on them but only momentarily. Hogwarts robes, Gryffindor Head girl badge, must be Granger, he snarled to himself. She was still there in the bathroom. He set his wand on the bench next to him, not fearing the girl. Sitting back down, he returned to removing his shoes to allow himself time to consider the situation without acting. He didn’t want her to know she had been caught yet.</p><p>Take points from Gryffindor? belittle her? No. It’s hardly even fun anymore, he admitted to himself. A smirk came across his face as he decided the best way to teach the damn chit a lesson. Gryffindors always think they are above the rules. He almost laughed aloud as he decided how best to punish the girl</p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>Hermione stood behind the small wall at the entrance of the steam room in a towel with only her wand. She was nearly paralyzed with fear as her alarm charm had sounded while she was relaxing in the hot tub. She barely had time to grab a towel before she hid from the incoming teacher. After several minutes of silence, she relaxed just enough to take a few deep breaths at not having been caught yet. She dared peek to see who was in the room with her. Crouching down, she hoping the steam was enough to conceal her form. She covered her mouth in surprise as she looked over to the bench. Of all the Hogwarts Professor, the worst possible one to be in this conundrum with was sitting on the bench taking off his shoes. Professor Snape. Fuck! This couldn’t possibly be worse, she thought. She knew there was no way out unnoticed and would have to wait him out to leave. She hadn’t actually spoken to him since that night in the Shieking Shack, and this was the worst possible time to have a conversation with him. She was wearing only a towel, out of bed after curfew, and in the staff bathroom. Hermione threw a silent temper tantrum at her own foolishness.</p><p>She was looking at him plucking away at his laces with his long agile fingers. Those hands had found hers when she was applying pressure to his bleeding neck in the shrieking shack. She knew he was in pain as he kept trying to pull her hands away from his throat. They were softer than she had expected. Horrible as his actions had been, or so she believed them to be at the time, she had always respected him. Perhaps that is why she felt compelled to help him. It didn’t matter though. She was a good person, and no one, including him, was going to make doubt that.</p><p>His feet were long, thin, and pale just like his hands. His hair hung in front of his face while he was bent over just as it did when he was grading papers at his desk. Professor Snape’s hands came up to the collar of his robes to free the top button. She had unbuttoned the top three buttons the night he had almost died. He had a light dusting of chest hair, which she smeared blood on as she clumsily grabbed at his throat. Her hands were too shaky from fear to move with the swiftness he always had. He was done with the buttons on his shirt and was undoing the cuffs now. She watched him roll his stiff neck as he slowly removed his shirt. Severus Snape was pale, scarred, and had almost no fat on him, leaving every muscle clearly defined on his slender frame. Silky black hair circled his belly button and trailed down disappearing into the waist of his pants. The dark mark on his arm stood out against his milky complexion like a blazing plane crash on a snowy mountainside. </p><p>Biting her lip, Hermione realized she had been staring. She quickly ducked back behind the wall. What is wrong with me, she scolded herself, you cannot watch him undress. Bloody hell. It’s just wrong. My heart is pounding. It’s just fear. It’s just fear of being caught. Curiosity got the better of her as she crouched down to peer around the corner at him again. Gods it hot. Damn steam. It’s just the steam. She soothed herself as she watched him remove his pants revealing long lean legs. She felt her stomach flutter as his hands tugged at the waistband of his boxers. She had to bite down on her hand to keep the squeak she felt coming from within her. She just couldn’t bring herself to look away. His manhood was larger than she expected. She only had to go on the one teen boy she had seen naked, and Snape wasn’t even erect. She had lost her virginity to Ron after the war, but it was not what she had expected. They were too close. It gave her that ‘kissing her brother’ feeling and ultimately led her to break up with him soon after they had gotten together. She cringed at realizing how silly she was being staring at him in awe. Severus Snape was obviously not a teenage boy. </p><p>She was becoming very thirsty, and sweat was beading around her forehead. Her heart was pounding; her knees were shaky. One more symptom and she would no longer be able to deny her arousal. She watched him slip into the water and heard a groan that sounded just as much like a growl. The noise made her insides squirm. She ducked back behind the wall and covered her ears. No! No! No, she told the ache that appeared in her lower belly. I must stop thinking it can’t get worse because clearly the Gods think it’s funny to prove me wrong, she whined to herself.</p>
