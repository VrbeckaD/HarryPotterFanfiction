  <span>Down by the prairie where the thestrals prance,</span>
  <span></span>
    <br/>
  
  <span>joyful music drifts through chapel doors,</span>
  <span></span>
    <br/>
  
  <span>children sit in pews in a wide-eyed trance,</span>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>and rose petals dot the stone floors.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The bride wears gold like a unicorn foal;</span>
  <span></span>
    <br/>
  
  <span>her grey eyes sparkle like silver seas.</span>
  <span></span>
    <br/>
  
  <span>The groom’s in black, both hair and slacks;</span>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>his heart is feather-light and free.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>They make their vows in front of the crowd:</span>
  <span></span>
    <br/>
  
  <span>to love, honour, trust and be true.</span>
  <span></span>
    <br/>
  
  <span>Happiness spreads like seeds on the breeze</span>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>that carries them through endless blue.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The organ plays as they come barrelling out</span>
  <span></span>
    <br/>
  
  <span>and into the rest of their lives.</span>
  <span></span>
    <br/>
  
  <span>They’ll stand together through flood and drought,</span>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>and any other disaster that arrives.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Oh, how they dance in the fields of chance;</span>
  <span></span>
    <br/>
  
  <span>how they move as the pine leaves sway.</span>
  <span></span>
    <br/>
  
  <span>Sunshine warms their skin as they start to spin,</span>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>and they’ll continue, come what may.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The music’s as soft as the finest of cloth,</span>
  <span></span>
    <br/>
  
  <span>and their hearts won’t ever go astray.</span>
  <span></span>
    <br/>
  
  <span>Oh, how they dance in the fields of chance;</span>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>they’ll continue each and ev’ry day.</span>
