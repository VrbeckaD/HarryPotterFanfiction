    <p>Hermione chuckled, “Draco love, I have to pee.”</p>
<p>He tightened his grip on her bare waist, “I don’t care he mumbled into his pillow. You Promised.”</p>
<p>Hermione rolled her eyes and turned over to face him. “You do know that I can’t leave you now right? Even if I wanted to?”</p>
<p>Draco opened his eyes and glared at her. “Ha ha,” he grouched, lifting her hand and placing gentle kisses along her knuckles, carefully avoiding her engagement <em>and </em>the wedding ring that he’d slipped on earlier that day, “like you’d ever want to leave me Mrs. Malfoy. I know you’re eternally happy to have bound our souls together, you can protest all you want.”</p>
<p>Hermione grinned and dropped a kiss on the corner of his mouth before she slipped out of his arms and scampered, naked, across their room to the bathroom.</p>
