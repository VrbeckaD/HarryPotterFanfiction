    <p>“Parkinson’s.” Draco read dryly, wondering why Pansy wanted him to approve the new letterhead. Pansy rolled her eyes and pointed a manicured finger at the line below it.</p><p> </p><p>“An affiliate of Malfoy Holdings.” She grinned before snatching it back. “If you’re going to pour that much money into my company Draco, you might as well get to put your name on it.” Waving her hands matter-of-factly she turned a corner and began the walkthrough of the morning. </p><p> </p><p>“You say this like you gave me any choice in the matter Pansy. If I <em>have</em> to put this much money into something then I’m going to <em>ensure </em>it doesn’t burn to the ground.” Adjusting the buttons on the vest of the three-piece grey suit he decided to wear for day one, he walked through the doors of Parkinson’s, Luxury Fashion House for the modern business witch.</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>**************</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Six months.” Draco stared at the suspension sheet. It’s glowing red indicator script seemingly taunting him of how long he would be banned from all ministry cases. “ Potter, you’re not serious.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Malf-Draco, I didn’t set the stipulations, but you know what you pulled out there was dangerous. I just got the position of Head Auror. If I didn’t file your report and schedule you for a psych eval they would’ve had my head in.” He groaned, ruffling the already messy blop of ebony hair. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’ll still be on retainer for the potions you make and it’s a paid suspension, not that it would affect you, but it looks nicer on your record that way.” Harry tried to soften the blow of the whole ordeal.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“But someone will have to pick up my handcrafted potions because </span>
  <em>
    <span>all suspended individuals are banned from Ministry offices.</span>
  </em>
  <span>” He barked back reading the terms of his suspension to Harry. "The shit you pulled at 16, Potter and they’re suspending me for this crap?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Steeling his grey eyes Draco took a moment to stare at the clock on the wall behind Harry’s desk. Draco controlled  his breathing in time with the second hand until he could trust himself to return to a state capable of conversation.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Pausing to clean his glasses,  Harry continued. “Which is why I didn’t do the recommended twelve months. Psych gave you six and I have zero control over what they say. Honestly, after what you had to go through, they’re right. Take some time. Relax. Look, as soon as your time’s up I’ll find the best case for you and put you on it no matter who’s currently on the docket.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The weariness was evident on Draco’s face as he ignored decades of etiquette lessons and slumped in the chair. Perking up slightly at his last statement, Draco grabbed his coat and moved to head out of Harry’s office. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That’s a Slytherin offer Potter, and you bet your arse I’m holding you to it as soon as my time is up.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>**************</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hermione was running through the atrium, trying not to be late to her meeting with Shacklebolt. They were set to have her Elf Resident Identification Bill up to court next week and this was one of their final comb through of it. Shuffling the rather large stack of papers in her hands, she didn’t notice the warpath Malfoy was on to leave the Ministry until it was too late. Hermione Granger  had just bumped into him with a very unladylike “humph!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m so sorry.” She murmured as she picked herself up off the ground and finally noticed who she ran into.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Granger?” Draco practically roared as the papers flew around the floor. Smoothing out any wrinkles that appeared in his suit Draco pertly pulled out his wand and cast a charm over the papers to stop their flurrying.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“For all of Salazar’s wit will this day not end?! Will the bloody Weasel come up to me and tell me that my flat has caught on fire so I can get the entire golden trio to ruin my day?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I said I was sorry Draco. You don’t need to be so rude.” Hermione huffed while she began to pick up the papers and arrange them in their correct order.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Furthermore, why on earth are you carrying a paper stack the size of a house-elf? You’re a witch Granger, I’m sure you have at least one bag with an expandable charm in it.” He groaned and walked off to the departing floos.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What an overblown albino peacock. Where does he get off?” She hissed to the space he left. Taking a deep breath to cool herself, she deemed the papers appropriate. As she walked towards the lifts Hermione attempted to  plan an apology for why she was taking up even more of the Minister’s time by being late.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>**************</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Harry! Merlin, sorry I’m so late but I did pick up some lasagna from the little Italian spot by the flower shop, so you can’t be too mad at me on my turn for dinner night.” Hermione chattered on as she stepped into 12 Grimmauld Place. “Also I had the most vile run in today with everyone’s favorite Auror.” She started but paused as she came into the kitchen and took a hold of the sight before her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry looked a right wreck. His Auror robes were haphazardly thrown on the spare kitchen chair and he looked befuddled and honestly haggard. He had a bottle of fire whiskey and a glass in his hand while he seemed to be filtering through case files like he was playing a game of solitaire.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well I was going to complain about my day at work, but you clearly have me beat.” She joked lightly, sitting the food down on the table as she moved to grab a couple of plates for them and a glass herself.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>When she set a plate of food down in front of him, Harry finally awoke from whatever slump made him bring work home on a Tuesday. “Uh, oh. Hey, Hermione, this looks great. Yeah sorry, today is one for the dogs. I basically just had to suspend Malfoy for six months. He was supposed to take on my role as number two, and honestly no one else is even close to trained for it. I might have to just go back out into the field and beg Alcott to stay on for six more months.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Placing case files away in a corner of the table and pouring herself a glass of the whiskey, Hermione attempted to understand things. “Well that does explain his blow up this afternoon.” She paused, digging into the dinner before adding,“that’s wretched Harry, you were so excited to get the job of Head Auror. What happened?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Godrick Hermione, I wish I could tell you. Malfoy had the mother of all cases. A dozen Aurors below him would’ve come out dead, and they didn’t have to deal with half the shite that… never mind. If I spill any more </span>
  <em>
    <span>I’ll </span>
  </em>
  <span>get suspended and Dean Thomas sure as shite can’t take over.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ignoring the shocking fact that Dead Thomas and Seamus Finnegan were the top team after Harry and Malfoy, she placed a delicate hand on Harry's back; rubbing soothing circles into it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’ll figure it out Harry, you always do.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I know, I just feel like shite doing this to Malfoy. He’s a great fucking Auror and he had to work like a dog just to get them to accept him in the position, despite the fact I barely got the N.E.W.T.S to qualify and Draco exceeded them with flying colors; not to mention he blew my potions practical scores out of the water..”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Chuckling at the reminder of Harry’s joy in passing by the slimmest margin she added. “Well, you were The-Boy-Who-Lived.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Don’t you start ‘Mione. Or every time you get another bill passed I’ll give you the Golden Girl speech. Malfoy got great marks all through school and even beat you as number one when you were being a time turner idiot 3rd year.” Harry went to continue but blanched up at the glare he received.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Why are you talking about Malfoy like he’s your best mate?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Because he’s not that bad. He finished the mission when he was really outnumbered. Plus I’m pissed that I’m shot a partner. Malfoy and I have been fighting in the same vicinity for over a decade off and on. Do you know how easy that is translated into being Auror partners?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Not so when you two hate each other.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“He’s different now ‘Mione, honest.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I find that hard to believe when he still looks like we’re not worth the ground beneath his designer wearing feet.” She bristled and Harry tried not to bark back too much.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I promise Hermione, he’s a decent guy now. Yeah he’s still all posh and he’s an arrogant twat at times, but he can be really funny, and witty. And Hermione, he’s damned good at his job.”</span>
</p><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p>
  <span>“Harry he’s a prat. He bullied us for years. Why are you defending him?” She asked and watched as Harry seemed to unravel. Running a hair through his locks and letting out an exhausted breath.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Because I feel like I got him suspended. Yes, I should’ve filed the report, but I thought he’d get a slap on the wrist. I know I certainly did a lot worse on my first run at Auror when everyone was scurrying after the war ended.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So why do you think he got suspended?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Because he’s a Malfoy. People who supported us don’t like his family because they supported Voldemort, and people who supported Voldemort don’t like his family because they turned on Voldemort in the end. He’s out there alone and everything he does has to be perfect to be tolerated. I’m certainly not half as neat as him in most of my cases.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So why was this case so different?” She probed, curious now to see what was so special about it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Can’t tell you ‘Mione. Not till the case is finished or the press finds out. With Malfoy’s suspension, it’ll be six months on our end at the earliest.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sighing at the lack of information she would be given she set to start eating. “Listen Harry, don’t beat yourself up. You did the proper thing, and Malfoy will turn out alright. He has more money than Satan and friends that know how to spend it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>**************</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Bloody do-good bleeding heart Saint Potter got you sacked?” Blaise Zabini questioned as the three of them relaxed in Theodore Nott’s card room. Theo was strumming a mandolin as Blaise and Draco threw darts.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Not sacked, Zabini. Suspended.” Each word was accented by a sharply thrown dart. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh the woes of our majesty the great. Shall I craft you a sonnet, no, a ballad of your trials?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Shut it, Nott, before the next one is aimed at your face.” Draco commented with a glare. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You wouldn’t hit a guy with glasses, now would you?” Theo gasped; adjusting the gold-rimmed frames that sat upon his angular features.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Have you met me?” Draco sneered over his shoulder.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Nevermind, Potter ruined that for me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Nice to know he’s ruining other people’s lives…” Draco grumbled and went to grab the delicious aged Scotch that Theo swiped from Nott Sr.’s study. </span>
  <em>
    <span>What he can’t drink in Azkaban will quench my thirst. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Why do you work at the bloody ministry anyway?” Blaise asked as they switched to have Blaise attempt to match Draco’s shots.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Zabini, we told you many times. Not all of us can spend all our time burning holes through our inheritances.” Theo chided like a mother reminding her child to chew with their mouth closed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“And what exactly do you fucking do?” Blaise questioned as he finished his last shot and hissed. Draco beating him for the third time.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I am a scholar, my dear boy. Why even this lovely mandolin was a little trinket I picked up during my studies of Chinese music.” He explained, strumming chords to some Shanghai Shanty he had learned. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Last I checked getting your dick wet through the musicians and dancers of Shanghai does not count as studying music.” Blaise bit back and Draco just barely pulled out a chuckle. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah you wound me Blaise, but I will forgive you. Because this bloke has been moping about for a bloody fortnight without so much as a smirk and I think your insult of my studies has finally brought him to acceptance.” Theo applauded Blaise by way of some enthusiastic strumming.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know Nott, he seems still at anger to me?” Blaise questioned as he placed a hand on the scruff of his beard. He’d been gone for three weeks in Cairo and was attempting to sport a more rugged facade. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Are you two idiots really trying to gauge what stage of grief I am on?”  Draco questioned, moving to sit at the card table, bored with the game of darts.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes, of course my dear, you know we only care about your happiness.” Theo cooed. Blaise roared in laughter as he moved to join Draco at the table.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Nott you’re so bloody weird, you know I don’t like it when you get all mother hen.” Draco scoffed before seeing a flash of green flames and standing. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s about fucking time. Pansy, why the hell are you so late?” Draco chided while pulling out her seat for her. His upbringing outweighing his frustration.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I was bringing Daphne.” She gestured to the elder of the Greengrass sisters; as Blaise pulled out the other chair and Theo moved to join them.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well let’s get on with this then. Welcome back to Britain Daphne, how was France?” Draco asked lightly as he dealt chips and Theo opened up the box for the self-shuffling cards.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, it was lovely. I even ran into your Great Aunt Celestia. She was a hoot and said to give you her best.” She chuckled as Draco rolled his eyes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I take that as code for ‘she’s still batshit and tried to get me to propose to someone in your family’.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, you know your mother still wants you to pick Astoria. She never did like me.” Daphne giggled lightly at their long-lived joke.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“She met you and she knows I enjoy your company. Therefore you’re not good enough to marry.” He sighed as Pansy waved around her arms to call attention to herself.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Enough. I refuse to have poker night be tarnished with any Sacred 28 chatter. I’m here to take money from you dolts like I’m your first wife.” Looking at Blaise whose mother had a distinct penchant for being widowed and left with incredible fortunes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Pansy go easy on me, I'm hosting this time.” Theo batted his eyelashes and tried to play on the more boyish features he had compared to the other men.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We’ll see about negotiations.” She responded to Theo.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It was about two hours later. The dinner jackets had all been removed, the table had pilfered through two bottles of Scotch old enough to buy itself a drink, and more money had been tossed around than most people saw in their lifetime.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I told you, Pansy, I’m not betting the Rivera cottage.” Draco groaned, sharply turning his hand face down to accent his point.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“But you know the rules. Final round is assets only. No pussyfooting around, ok?” Pansy was notoriously good at poker and it was only with Theo and Draco’s combined intellect that they occasionally beat her. Theo was knocked out last round and so it was down to Draco to stop her winning streak.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What </span>
  <em>
    <span>else</span>
  </em>
  <span> do you want Pansy, not my homes.” Draco strained.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Pausing a moment to consider her options, she gained a glimmer in her eye.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“How about an investment?” She asked and leaned back as if 5 people in their twenties drunk off their socks were suddenly in a boardroom.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What, for your little fashion house?” He questioned, raising an eyebrow and flicking his wrist in that elegant and nonchalant way that only people with excessive amounts of money seemed to do.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes, unfortunately my family doesn’t seem to care about my dreams of becoming a fashion mogul and has stopped funding it. But you, prince charming, and your lovely post-inherited self could certainly see to my happiness.” She charmed in that commanding yet polished way that only Pansy Parkinson could pull off.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“How much?” He probed, knowing the value of their final rounds tended to be steep.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“200,000 galleons.” She responded simply, only for Blaise to nearly spit out the drink he just took.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“If I win?” He countered, needing to make sure it was worth betting that much at all if what he would win wasn’t worth the risk. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Pansy pursed her lips, considering what would be a fitting trade. “The Ibiza penthouse… and the rights to the Spring Festival with it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The group were stunned still at her offer. They all had their little get-togethers and parties throughout the year. Draco’s were still majorly run by his mother and were the most formal. Theo liked to coin himself a Dionysus of the day and his ragers were always something you lived to not remember you went to the next morning. But Pansy’s Spring Festival was her baby. She sometimes planned for the party a full year in advance. It routinely was the favorite of the under 30 crowds and the rest of their soirees simply attempted to keep up.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Take it fucker, take the deal before I make you do myself.” Theo hissed at Draco in hurried whispers.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Fine then, on three.” He nodded, lifting a thumb under his hand.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“One…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Two…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Three.” And as they both turned their cards over there was a resounding cheer of “fuck” in various levels of joy and regret.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We all at Parkinson’s are so happy for your very generous donation Mr. Malfoy.” Pansy grinned and turned to Daphne with silent squeals.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Will my torture never end?” Draco moaned as he placed a hand over his face in frustration and defeat.</span>
</p><p>
