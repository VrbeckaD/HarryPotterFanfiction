    <p>
  <span>“No,” Harry said. “You have to be joking.” He awkwardly shifted in the optometrist chair while glancing over at one of his dads. “I’m only seventeen! I’m supposed to be graduating this year!” His breathing started to pick up; he was clearly beginning to panic. Sirius and Remus shared a look, and Remus reached out to put a hand on his son’s knee.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Calm down, cub,” Remus said softly. “Let’s hear what else the doctor has to say.” He glanced at the man seated on the stool, who was still holding Harry’s chart.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Unfortunately, the disease doesn’t cause blindness right away; it could be a period of between three and six months.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“Six months?” </span>
  </em>
  <span>Harry blurted.</span>
  <em>
    <span> “That’s not nearly long enough!”</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I know, Harry,” the optometrist said. “It never is. I’m so sorry to have to give you gentlemen this news, but there is just nothing we can do medically.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Harry slumped in the chair, defeated.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“However,” the doctor continued, handing Sirius and Remus a fairly thick manilla envelope, “in there is all the information you will need to send Harry to a school for the blind. It will teach him how to live with his condition and usually takes from six months to a year, depending on how Harry reacts to treatment.” He stood, closed Harry’s chart, and walked to the door. “I’d like to see you back in a month, sooner if anything changes before then. Again, I’m sorry.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He left the room and Harry stared blankly after him. Remus helped him out of the chair and out of the exam room. While Sirius went to the desk to make the next appointment, Remus took Harry to the car.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Harry got in without a word. He was numb. In the few minutes he had been in the doctor’s office, his whole world had been shattered. Three words echoed in his head:</span>
  <em>
    <span> I’m going blind. </span>
  </em>
  <span>All the tests he had been through were for nothing. There had always been trouble with his eyes, before and after Remus and Sirius had adopted him. But he never thought anything like this would happen. His mind refused to process it.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>When they returned home, Harry went straight to his room and closed the door. He sat on his bed and looked around the room. The curtains were open, letting the afternoon rays of sunlight flood the space. His desk sat under them, with his laptop and schoolbooks on top. One of his hoodies hung on the back of the chair. Everything was so colorful, from his shelf of books to his open closet, showing the mess on the floor inside. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>There was no life for him now, he thought to himself. Everything would be ruined. He was supposed to graduate in three weeks’ time, but now he wondered if he even would be able to make it.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>After a while, there was a hesitant knock on his door, followed by Sirius’ quiet voice. “Can I come in?”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Harry remained silent. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius slowly opened the door and walked in, sitting next to his son on the bed. “Harry,” he said, “it’s going to be okay.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“How?!” Harry suddenly spat, furious. He stood and started pacing. “How the fuck is it going to be okay? I’m supposed to be doing all sorts of stuff with my life and, pretty soon, I won’t be able to do anything! No graduation, no summer off before I look at colleges, no friends, much less trying to meet anyone. I’m going to be an invalid, lonely and useless, for the rest of my life!”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius stood and stopped Harry from pacing. “No you’re not. There are lots of sightless people out there who live perfectly normal lives. That’s what schools like the doc was talking about are for.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Harry’s shoulders sagged. His anger left him just as quickly as it had come. He felt heavy, like a huge weight had been put upon his shoulders, and he was ready to collapse from the effort of trying to hold it up. Before he knew what was happening, he was overcome by a sadness so great he just couldn’t hold it in anymore. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Sinking slowly to his knees, Harry covered his face with his hands and started to cry. Sirius was on the floor in a flash, gathering Harry into his arms and holding him close. Remus heard Harry from outside his bedroom door and joined his family, wrapping his arms around the both of them.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Harry clutched onto his parents while deep, heart wrenching sobs shook him. Sirius and Remus murmured words of comfort against their son’s hair, both of their own hearts breaking. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>After a while, Harry’s weeping slowed then stopped altogether. Sirius and Remus realized he had cried himself to sleep. Carefully, Remus lifted the teen into his arms and carried him over to his bed.  He pulled off Harry’s shoes, covered him with the blanket, then brushed the hair out of his tear stained face. They left the room, pulling the door almost shut.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Fucking hell, what a day,” Sirius said with a huff, leaning against the wall outside Harry’s room.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“You’re telling me,” Remus replied, joining his husband. “I wish there were more we could do for him. It kills me to see him so upset.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius took Remus’ hand. “I know. We’ve done all we can for tonight,  I’m afraid. He just needs time to process.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Remus sighed and nodded. “Hopefully, for both Harry’s and our sake, each day will get a little easier.”</span>
