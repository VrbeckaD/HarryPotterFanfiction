  <strong>1991</strong>
</p><p align="center"><em>"Maybe if I tell myself enough. Maybe if I do. I'll get over you." </em>- Over You, Ingrid Michaelson</p><p align="center"> </p><p>Hermione Granger had snuck away, to explore what could only be described as paradise. She found herself surrounded by seemingly endless shelves, full of books that contained the secrets and knowledge of the magical society. A society, that had remained undetected for centuries. And Hermione was now one of the few outsiders, that were privy to their world.</p><p>Five days ago, she had been a perfectly ordinary girl. Until finding a jolly looking and rather small man on her doorstep. He had intruduced himself as Professor Flitwick of the Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry. After making her mothers pot plants waltz with a swing of his wand, he declared Hermione a witch.</p><p>In many ways, she had always known that she was a bit different from all her schoolmates. When they went outside to play hide and seek, she preferred to stick her nose into every big book she could find. Perfect marks were more important to her than anything. The others sometimes made fun of that and called her names for it, but Hermione never bothered to be hurt by their childish behavior. At least she pretended not to be. Success and education were more important than playing with dolls and making friends. The logic part of her brain knew that. Still she sometimes caught herself thinking, how nice it would be to have someone to talk, that wasn't her parents.</p><p>Grimly she remembered Bethany Payne laughing about her neatly stacked and carefully marked notes. Now that Hermione was a witch, she was never going to see her and the rest of the mean girls in that class again. She was going to have a very exiting life, and meet other magic people that were smart and interesting and finally belong. It had already started.</p><p>The Professor was helping her buy everything she would need to attend the best wizarding school in the whole country. And that in a fantastic alley full of impossible things. Including the most amazing bookshop Hermione had ever seen.</p><p>Of course the required books on the Hogwarts list, weren't enough for Hermione. She already had an disantvantage, because she had to learn everrything about magic, that her future  classmates had grown up with. It was important that she absorbed as much knowledge as possible before reaching the school. So she had disappeared between the high shelves, while Professor Flitwick was distracted, bargaining with the shop owner.</p><p>Deeper and deeper she wandered into the labyrinth of treasures. Her fingertips were stroking the backs of the old books. Now and then she inspected one more closely. Strangly, some of them seemed to be alive. She could have sworn she saw one breathing. And another one was emitting slowly swirling, lilac fumes. At the thought of entient, magical books her heart began beating even faster.<br/> She passed an encyclopedia with the title <em>'enchanting chants and spells for beginners'</em> that seemed to be whispering. Astonished she halted and carefully grabbed the beautiful specimen wrapped in smooth, dark green leather.</p><p>“I wouldn't, if I were you”, a snarky voice said from behind her, just as Hermoine opened the heavy covers.</p><p>Before she could read a single letter, the pages started to screech loudly. And with the most inadequate singing voice. She yelped in horror and pressed it shut with unnecessary force. This might have been the first time she didn't enjoy unfolding a book.</p><p>“Told you so”, the voice said, sounding smug. Hermoine whirled around, looking at the pale boy that had spoken. He was about her own age. And staring at her full of curiosity, as if she were a strange animal. Self consciously she tried to push her bushy locks behind her ears.</p><p>Something about his pristine blonde hair and perfectly tailored clothes made him look life a life sized doll, that had been dressed up. It made her feel inadequate in her grandmas self-knitted sweater.</p><p>“How did you know it would do that?” Hermione asked baffled and still a bit shaken from the unwanted musical performance. If one could call it that.</p><p>“My father has one one these in his library,” he said shrugging, ”it's a more valuable copy of course. Still an incredibly annoying piece of garbage though.”</p><p>Normally Hermoine would frown upon calling any literature garbage, but in the case of this particular sample an exception could be made. She told the boy as much and than added without being able to disguise a twinge of jealousy in her words: “You have a whole library at home?”</p><p>She imagined how great it would be to own hundreds of book about the unknown depth of magic. She would probably never stop reading. Not even to sleep</p><p>“Of course. It's the biggest and most expensive private collection in the country, says my father.” The boy boasted. Hermoine stared at him, her envy growing. “That sounds amazing.”</p><p>“I know.” He grinned, cheeks glowing and appearently so encouraged by her reaction, he forgot to sound infalted and even smiled. “It has everything! Books about the most insane curses, that made people grow three heads, and how to make people do whatever you want – and I even found one, that explains how to turn yourself into anyone else with a crazy potion!”</p><p>Hermoine couldn't believe that the first magical person she had met in her age, was actually interested in reading. It proved her theory that the other magical kids<b> </b>weren't as silly as the ones in her old class. Even though the boys taste in spells was a bit creepy. Growing three heads defnitly wasn't one Hermione's list, but nevertheless. She had been right. Young wizards and witches really were her people, and she would fit in for the first time in her life.</p><p>“I wish there was a library like that at my house. It sounds amazing.” She said honestly, looking up the endless walls of books.</p><p>“Yes, it's marvelous.” The boy said, his cheeks a bit pink. Hermoine noticed that he tended to talk somewhat pompously for an eleven year old. He looked at his feet when he mumbled: “I just wish I was allowed to go inside. I always have to sneak in.” But suddenly smirked again, pointing at the book that was still jittering in Hermione's hands. “And that talentless piece of shit has almost gotten be caught once.”</p><p>“Well, Professor Flitwick told me that the library in Hogwarts is enormous. I am sure students will be allowed in whenever they want. I am so exited. It's going to be my first year, and I can't wait to get there.” She was rambling, but what else was new.</p><p>“This is my first year too.” He said proudly. “And I will be a Slytherin."</p><p>Confused about his certainly, she tried to remember every word the Professor had told her. Hermione disliked not being correctly informed.<br/> “I thought there is a ceremony on the first evening, were everyone will be assigned a house", she said with forrowed brows.</p><p>“I am sure already,” he laughed a bit condescending, as if it was embaressing that she didnt. “My whole family was in Slytherin. Where were yours ?” Than he haltet, looking up and down on her. “Please don't say Hufflepuff.”</p><p>Hermione crossed her arm, slowly getting annoyed. Why was he acting as if Hufflepuff was less valuable than the other equally important houses? Wasn't the whole point that they each had different, good qualities?</p><p>“I really wouldn't know, seeing as they never went to Hogwarts”, she snapped not even knowing, why she wanted this pretentious boy to approve of her. Maybe it was because he liked reading enough to sneak into his father library and open screeching books.</p><p>“Are they-... you aren't a muggle, are you ?” The boy asked concerned. The way he said it, it sounded like an insult. Hermione begun to wonder, if it was even worth wanting him to like her. He seemed a bit snobby and elitest.</p><p>“No!” She hissed, now really irritated. “I am a witch. But my parents are.”<br/> “Oh. That means that you are a-...”<br/> “A what?” She felt indignation, as the boy walked backwards. He was mustering her now very irritated. As if she had betrayed him and turned into a very disgusting slug without his permission.</p><p>“Draco, where are you?” A women called. It sounded like she was coming closer.</p><p>The boy – Draco most likely – turned around and fled, without saying so much as goodbye.</p><p align="center">*****</p><p>The Hogwarts Express was noisy, full, chaotic and Hermione's seatmate had lost his toad. He was currently trying to climb underneath her legs to look for it, while moaning loudly about his grandmother's rage. Mostly to get away, she promised to help look for his pet and left.</p><p>In her search for the escaped toad, she visited almost every compartment in the whole train.</p><p>Most were filled with older students caching up with their friends. In one some sort of prefect meeting was held. And in another one, a couple of teenagers were hosting a wrestling match with two moving chess pieces that seemed to be fighting to the death, cheered on by almost twenty students that were pressed to together very tightly on the six seats. But the most exiting one had Harry Potter in it. Hermoine had read about him. She couldn't believe, that she was actually going visit classes together with someone, that had already made it into history books. The redhead he was sitting next to seemed a bit dim though.</p><p>Hermione had almost given up on getting back 'Trevor', when she opened the last door next to her own. She found herself face to face with the pale boy from the bookshop. Draco. He was surrounded by five other guys, that were rowdily playing with exploding cards and throwing sweets at each others heads. They interrupted their antics to stare at her.</p><p>“I am looking for a toad, has anyone seen it?” She asked bravely. None of them said anything.</p><p>The eyes of the pale boy were mustering her coldly, without any of the curiosity she remembered from the bookshop. There was just blankness.<br/> Some of the others started to giggle. Hermoine cleared her throat: “It's not mine … I'm just helping it's owner to look for it.”</p><p>It was Draco who finally deigened to answer her, smirking utterly charmeless: “You can tell that fat oaf Longbottom, that if he want's his sad excuse for a croaking piece of snot back-”,he sneered accompanied by the amused grunting of his friends, “he should come himself and not send some muggle girl.”</p><p>Hermoine felt her cheeks heat up. After their first meeting she had thought, he might have some redeeming qualities, but now she was sure she had been mistaken.<br/> “You took it?” She asked outraged, crossing her arms. He just shrugged, the others laughed. What an arse.</p><p>“As I said, if he want's it – he can come and get it.” At that two very big, gorilla like guys next to them were clenching their giant fists. How charming.</p><p>“And now bugger of, we're busy.” He ended with a small wave of his wrist and they all continued playing their pointless game. Hermione slammed the door so hard, she was afraid the glass was going to break. So this Draco was a giant prick. Good to know.</p><p align="center">*****</p><p>It was late and most of the other students had already left the library to go to their dorms. But Hermione was still scouring for every bit of information she could find about Nicolas Flamel. Harry and Ron had proven themselves worthless when it came to researching, so she had taken on the task alone. Her eyes were already hurting from all the dusty pages, but she knew that she wouldn't find any sleep, if she didn't finish what she had intended to do tonight.</p><p>“You come here a lot”, a familiar voice said behind her. She was so startled that she almost pushed over her ink pot.<br/> “Are you crazy sneaking up on me like that, Malfoy? ”, she hissed as she turned around to him. He was smirking obnoxiously. As always.</p><p>Of course she came to the library a lot. But she could say the same about him. Especially late in the evenings when only a few students were still working, she had noticed that Draco Malfoy of all people was lurking around. From their first encounter she deducted that he might be a bigger fan of reading than he wanted to let on, not that made him any less of an unlikable snob.<br/> Her disapproval of him had only grown since his show of nastiness in the Hogwarts Express. It wasn't helping that he had apparently made it his sole purpose to provoke and insult Harry and Ron, whenever he saw them. He had turned out to be an arrogant, mean little tyrant that strutted around Hogwarts like he owned the place.<br/> They never really talked, he mostly focused his insult on the boys, but she sometimes noticed him staring at her angrily in class, or watching her through the bookshelves in the library. She guessed he was jealous of all the points she kept getting. It would fit his foul personality.</p><p>“What are you doing ?” He asked after a short while, dropping down on the chair next to her without any permission. Hermoine wanted him gone, so she could continue looking into her research about Flamel.</p><p>“What does it look like ? I am studying.” She said annoyed, sliding away from him and burying her nose back in her transformations book. She had already read it three times, before she had even set foot into Hogwarts.</p><p>“Don't you have any friends to hang out with instead?” Draco jeered, “is that why your always studying ? Or is it because you enjoy being an intrusiv wisenheimer ?”</p><p>Hermoine sighed but didn't look up. A couple of weeks ago, that comment would have hurt. But after the whole troll in girls toilet incident, she did have friends. For the first time in her life. And she had been called a know-it-all so many times in her life. It had lost it's touch.</p><p>“If you think I am so annoying, what are you doing here?” she asked calmly. There was a long, very untypical silence. When she finally raised her her eyes from the page, he was staring at her. But not in his usual pained and angry way. He looked sort of nervous.</p><p>“What?” She asked irritated. Somehow he had become even paler.</p><p>“I don't think your annoying”, he whispered. And before she could even open her mouth to respond, he jumped up and fled. That was the last time he talked to her until the end of the school year.</p><p> </p><p align="center">

</p><p>Gilderoy Lockart had the most perfect blonde curls. But that was even that important considering how brave he was, and what great dangers he had successfully withstood. Hermoine felt her heart flutter a bit, as he beamed into the crowd in Flourish and Blotts and their eyes seemed to meet. He was just so good looking and worldly. Not like Ron, who was currently picking his nose next to her.</p><p>Not even the encounter with Draco and his less than pleasant father could dampen her good mood, after Gilderoy Lockart had signed all her books elegantly. When Mr Malfoy insulted her parents and got into a fist fight with Mr Weasley, Hermoine understood were Draco had got his charms.</p><p>She remembered the first time they had met, almost a year ago in the exact same bookshop. He had been a arrogant jerk even back than. But with a father like that who wouldn't be ? Mr Malfoy definitely seemed like the kind of man, that would forbid his son from visiting his precious library.</p><p>Later Harry told her and Ron about eavesdropping on the Malfoy's, while they were shopping in Borgin and Borks. He reported how Draco had been giving a talking to, because he was second best after a muggelborn – Hermione – in class. She didn't tell her friends, but she felt a bit sorry for him at that, when she thought about her own parents supporting her no matter what. But as she was laying awake in her bed that night the Malfoy's weren't on her mind.</p><p>She was busy dreaming about her new Professor for Defense Against the Dark Arts. Hermione still couldn't believe she was going to see Gilderoy Lockart almost everyday in school, that she was going to be able to impress him with her knowledge.</p><p>He was going to appreciate her intellectual curiosity. Because contrary to the boys that surrounded her – he was a man. She fell asleep fantasizing about him telling her every little thing about his many adventures, while smiling brightly.</p><p align="center">*****</p><p>The Quidditch teams of Gryffindor and Slytherin had were facing each other on the field, and it looked like they were about to fight.</p><p>So Ron and Hermione ran down from the ranks were they had watched their team practice. As they came closer, they realized that the Slytherins were showing off their new brooms. Sponsored by Lucius Malfoy. And their new Seeker, that had probably come with that deal.</p><p>Hermione said what everyone was thinking, that their player were at least chosen for their talents and not bribed their way in like Draco had. At that he stared at her with so much hatred, she almost flinched.</p><p>“No one asked for your opinion, you filthy little mudblood”, he spat.</p><p>Hermoine had no idea what that word meant, but it must be bad – considering the reaction of the others. Ron even pulled out his broken wand. After his curse had backfired, Hermione didn't acknowledge Draco with so much as a glance and helped Harry take care of Ron.</p><p>But if she had, she would have seen the expression of regret and shame on the Draco's face.</p><p>After learning what 'Mudblood' really meant, she decided he wasn't even worth pitying. No matter how horrible his father was, it turned out the rotten apple didn't fall far from the tree.</p><p align="center">*****</p><p>Since they had found the petrified Mrs Norris, everyone especially the muggelborn students had become tense.</p><p>And after the disaster of duel club, where Harry had revealed that he was a parselmouth, the whole school thought he was the heir of Slytherin, while Harry and Ron suspected Draco Malfoy. Especially after he had threatened all <em>mudbloods</em> on the night of Halloween, looking directly at Hermione.</p><p>Still she wasn't sure about their theory, but helped nonetheless. Who except her, could brew the polyjuice potion for them ? Even if he probably wasn't guilty, maybe Draco knew something about the chamber of secrets that could be useful. And Hermione had secretly always wanted to brew a potion, that was this level of complicated, just to prove she could.</p><p>After another brilliant lesson in Defense Against the Dark Arts, Hermione planned to linger to get a chance to talk to Professor Lockart about his encounter with the Glastonbury Vampire, so she took extra long to pack her stuff. Almost everyone had already left, only Draco Malfoy was still loitering. She glared at him, but all that archived, was him glaring back. He didn't show the slightest inclination to leave.</p><p>When Professor Lockart disappeared into his rooms into the back, he was still leaning against the door, arms crossed. Hermoine could honestly hit him in that moment. With her reason to dawdle gone, she gathered all her things quickly and wanted to storm out, but Draco still didn't move, blocking the door.</p><p>“You fancy him don't you?” He asked, sounding more snotty than ever.</p><p>“I don't know what you are talking about”, she responded defensively, mirroring his crossed arms.</p><p>“Please, I am not as dumb as your moron friends. You obviously fancy that sad excuse for a teacher and his stupid fake laugh. It's pathetic.”</p><p>“His laugh is not fake”, she snapped at him, not caring that she gave away her crush with that. To her surprise he didn't exploit her slip up. He just sniffed. “So you do actually like him.”</p><p>“It's really none of your business, Malfoy.” Her voice was full of disdain. It made him deflate, until he looked tired and desolate. A flash of guilt hit her, even though she didn't know what she could have possibly done to him.</p><p>“I am gonna go now.” Hermione stated, but she wasn't sure if he even listened. So she just pushed by him and tried to forget all about it.</p><p align="center">*****</p><p>It was a Basilisk. It had had to be. Hermoine had read the page, describing the monster again and again. Everything fit. Only Harry could hear it, since it was a snake. An animal that not so coincidentally also represented the house Slytherin. Because Salazar Slytherin – just like his heir, would have been able to control it with parsel. It all made sense. Even the petrifications. Looking into the Basilisk eyes directly meant instant death, but all victims had seen it through something. And that was why there had been no killings. Yet.<br/> She only wondered how a giant snake was able to move around Hogwarts undetected and attack students. But then it hid her. Harry had heard an invisible voice, because it had been crawling in the walls and ceiling. Exited she ripped out the page, and scribbled the word<em> pipes</em> on it. When she looked up, she found herself in front of a very pale and slightly manic seeming Draco.</p><p>“That's very unlike you.” He said, pointing at the torn out page in her hand.<br/> “I don't have time for one of our weird little talks right now. This is important.” She waved the paper in front of his face, without giving him a chance to actually read it.</p><p>Draco sighed, as if she was the unreasonable one. “My thing is too”, he instited but was not able to form a coherent sentence after that. “Important I mean. I have to- … I have to warn you”, he began stuttering.</p><p>“I really have to go.” She felt her palms getting sweaty, thinking about a giant  reptile killing students this very moment, when she could have warned them.</p><p>Pushing past him, he grabbed her elbow. “Let go of me!” She squealed, surprised.</p><p>The look in his blue eyes was torn between hesitant and worried. All in all, he was acting very strange. If Hermione's thoughts hadn't been occupied otherwise, she might have wondered.</p><p>“Just stay away from Ginny Weasley, okay ?” he said so quickly, he almost tripped over his tongue.</p><p>Hermione freed herself and left, without even reacting to that weird comment. Malfoy's games didn't have priority in the moment.</p><p>She was running, and almost crashed into a girl with big, blonde curls. Thinking about the Basilisk she asked: “Do you have a mirror ?”</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <strong>1993</strong>
</p><p>Harry had fainted when the Dementor had searched their compartment for Sirius Black. Hermione was still worried, when they reached the entrance hall. Therefore she didn't find Malfoy's reenactment of the incident for his snickering friends, very funny. She was about to go over and tell him as much, when Professor McGonagall called her and Harry into her office.</p><p>When they got send back to the banquet a few minutes later, her heart was fluttering. She had been given a Time Turner. Not only was this year going to feature many interesting new classes, she was going to be able to visit them by <em>turning back time</em>. After being petrified for weeks, she had felt as if she had missed out on so much – but now it seemed she had been handed all the time she needed.</p><p>She was still reveling in her joy about the possibilities, that she barley noticed Malfoy staring at her from the Slytherin table. Just like everyone else, he had been hit by a growth spurt. Loosing all the baby fat made his face looked sharper.</p><p>But his character clearly hadn't grown together with his body. He had proven that by the short and unnecessary visit to their compartment in the train and his behavior after hearing about Harry's accident. During the holidays, Hermione had spent more time than she wanted to admit, thinking about him.</p><p><em>Why had wanted her to stay away Ginny ?</em> Of course he had known that his father had given her Tom Riddle's Diary, but why warn <em>her</em> of all people ?</p><p>She hadn't told the others about it, because she wanted to understand it first. At least that was what she tried to convince herself of. Maybe it also felt,<em> private</em> somehow. And she just didn't want to endure Ron's surly dumbfounded and Harry's predictable angry expressions at that story. Hermione just couldn't make sense of Malfoy's behavior. It had almost seemed like he had been scared for her back then. But now when Harry and Ron had pretended to be Crabbe and Goyle a couple of weeks earlier, he had told them that he wished the monster would kill her.</p><p>And now he was acting like the same prick he always had.</p><p>That didn't change the next day. In their first lesson with Hagrid – that was going well contrary to her worst expectations – Malfoy manged to get attacked by insulting an Hippogriff. Just because he didn't listen, when they were told to not do that exact thing.</p><p>Hermoine was seething with anger and begrudgingly worried, when she used her Time Turner to go the the hospital wing, while simultaneously sitting in Ancient Runes.</p><p>She was going to tell Draco Malfoy exactly what she thought of irresponsible idiots like him. And also use that opportunity to confront him about the warning, that still made head hurt. While being there, she could also check if he was ok – but that was just coincidental.</p><p>When Madam Pomfrey spotted Hermione rushing into the hospital wing, she oddly didn't seem very surprised.</p><p>“He is sleeping I am afraid. You are here to see Mr Malfoy, are you not ?” The nurse asked with the hint of a smile. Hermoine felt like a deer, caught in the headlights.<br/> “I- well, I am just here to bring him some homework”, she mumbled cheeks heating up.</p><p>“On the very first day of school, how considerate of you.” There was a knowing twinkle in her eye, when she continued. “Almost as considerate, as Mr Malfoy bringing notes to a petrified patient of mine, a couple of month ago.”</p><p>Hermione felt her jaw drop. He had visited her when she had been petrified ? That certainly was strange. As was the warm feeling, that spread in her stomach at that thought.</p><p>“Err, that's – did he say-...”, she began just as the door opened, and Pansy Parkinson came strutting in, with what looked like a <em>Get Well Soon</em> Card and a truly hideous collection of pink flowers in her hands. Hermione doubted that they would be Draco's taste.</p><p>“What are <em>you</em> doing here, Granger ?” she asked with a vicious glint in her eyes. Hermoine squared her shoulders and gave her the most condescending glare she could muster up.</p><p>“Not that it concerns you, <em>Parkinson</em> – but I was picking up a Pepper-Up-Potion for my cold”, she said calmly. Than she turned around to the slightly bemused Madam Pomfrey: “Thanks again for all your help, I'll be sure to use it once a day until I feel better. Goodbye.”</p><p>With that she left the hospital wing, carefully making sure it didn't look like fleeing.</p><p align="center">*****</p><p>Confronting Malfoy about his contradicting actions seemed more vital, after learning that he had also visited her.</p><p>The embarrassing 'warm feelings' she had felt thinking – however impossible that was – he may care about her a little, had vanished due to his petty milking of the accident to get Hagrid in trouble. So talking to him would at least not be awkward.</p><p>Hermione just had to find a way to corner him. The library had proven to be a good spot. It was the only time he left his entourage behind, likely because Crabbe and Goyle thought books were only used as doorstoppers and were possibly unable to even read.</p><p>Sadly no opportunity presented itself in the following weeks.</p><p>The only class they both visted without Harry and Ron was Arithmancy, together with only three Rawenclaws and an arrogant looking Slytherin called Blaise Zabini. But Hermione wasn't going to jeopardize a good performance in her most difficult class, to talk to Draco Malfoy.</p><p>No matter how much unwelcome time she spent thinking about him.</p><p>One Sunday morning, when Harry had Quidditch training and Ron was still sleeping, Hermione went downstairs quickly grab herself a toast and than dive into the her pile of homework. Sometimes even she wasn't able to finish all off them without turning back time a couple of hours on the weekends. Not that she was bothered, she loved working and she wanted to prove that she could handle it.</p><p>Hermione was feverishly thinking about her astrology maps, when she heard a familiar snarky voice behind the next corner. Draco, flanked by his two gorilla friends were facing a scared looking Hufflepuff, named Ernie. Hermione knew that, because he had come over to her, Harry and Ron at breakfast a couple of days ago and greeted the boys in a rather pompous manner. When she had tried to talk to him though, his face tarnished in a very unflattering crimson and he started stuttering about some utter nonsense.</p><p>“...- wouldn't suggest that, McMillan – or I'll ask Crabbe and Goyle to teach you a little lesson on what happens to people that cross me.” Malfoy snarled as vicious as ever. Hermione felt her muscles clench. Why did he feel the need to be such an utter prick all of the time ?</p><p>“I don't even know what you mean!” Ernie squealed, throwing Goyle's balled fist a panicked look.</p><p>“All right, you asked for it.” Malfoy grinned, taking a step back, as if to clear the way for his goons. Hermoine decided it was time to intervene.</p><p>“What's going on ?” She asked loudly, and all four boys turned to around her. Ernie strangely looked even more miserable at her sight, and Malfoy raised an eyebrow.</p><p>“Nothing to see here Granger, move along. I am sure you have some homework to do, or something equally fascinating. Better leave that self righteous hero act to Potter, it suits you even less.”</p><p>“Well what would suit me in your opinion ?” She asked slowly pulling her wand, “hexing you a real injury so you can actually put that fake bandage to good use ?”</p><p>“Tss, tss.” Malfoy smirked, “no need for violent threats, beaver-face.”</p><p>Hermoine sharply raised her wand, ready to make him crawl back to the hospital wing. To Malfoys luck, Professor Lupin chose that exact moment to appear. Almost as sudden, as if he had materialized out of thin air.</p><p>“Is there a problem here ?” He calmly asked, eyeing the strange scene infront of him with mild amusement. Hermoine still aiming at Malfoy's face, Ernie almost crying and Crabbe and Goyle gawking - not sure how to react to a wand, as if they had never seen one before in three years of Hogwarts. No one said anything. Ernie quietly whimpered. Neither Hermione nor Malfoy interrupted their glaring match.</p><p>Lupin sighed. “Well. Than I suggest that you put away your wand Miss Granger. And you all go downstairs and have some breakfast.”</p><p>Out of the corner of her eye Hermione saw Ernie quickly grab his back from the ground and scurry away. After another cough from the Professor she lowered her wand, not breaking eye contact with Malfoy. They fixated each other angrily for another seemingly endless while, until he finally looked down.</p><p>“Crabbe, Goyle!” He snapped, and with them in towing behind him, he left as well. When they were alone, Lupin raised a questioning eyebrow at Hermione.</p><p>“It was nothing, Professor. Just a misunderstanding. I should go down as well, I have a lot of work to catch up too.”</p><p>“Very well Miss Granger. Just promise I will never see you ready hex someone in the corridors again, or I won't be able to let it slip this easily.”</p><p>“Of course, Professor. It won't happen again.” She promised, really meaning it. Because on the rest of her way to the library, her plan to get a toast first long forgotten, she realized that she had no interest in talking to a tyrant, no matter how confusing he was. She had to much on her plate already to also wonder about someone like Malfoy. Even if he had visited and warned her last year – he was still a foul bully and she wanted nothing to do with him.</p><p align="center">*****</p><p>Hermione wasn't focusing on her essay. It was infuriating. She kept thinking about Hagrid misery. His hippogriff had been ordered to a official hearing and she couldn't do anything to help him. Also it was hard to shake her anger about Ron making her cat responsible for his useless rat, that had probably just crawled somewhere to die of old age. As a result of his stupid accusation, he wasn't even talking to her. It was so immature and unnecessary.</p><p>On top of all that, she was absolutely exhausted. All her different classes taking a heavy toll on her, even if she would never admit that aloud. After twenty minutes of staring at her parchment and not writing a single word, she gave up and packed her things. Maybe it would help to just go to sleep. Her watch told her, that the library would close soon anyway. Just as she stood up to stretch her sore muscles, no other than Malfoy appeared behind a shelf and headed directly for her.</p><p>“Go away”, she said defensivly - sounding just as tired as she felt. Malfoy didn't seem to mind her hostile demenaor. He just kept advancing, until there were only an arm's length apart.</p><p>“Why should I?” He grinned, annoyingly chipper. “This is a public library you know.”</p><p>Hermione felt her already taxed nerves shaking. “I don't want you around me, okay ?” She snapped, “I am sick and tired of our little talks.”<br/> With that she tried to get past him, but Malfoy just smiled innocently. “Not sure I know what you mean.”</p><p>Back when she had planned to confront him, she had already though of a perfect speech. But now she was exhausted and blindsided and words just escaped her in an unplanned, embarrassingly hysteric fashion: “Oh please. Like this is the first time you cornered me in the past years. A few times it actually happened in this very library. Remember for example that time you told me 'you didn't think I was annoying' only to ignore my existence for a whole year ?” She felt her pulse raising, slowly becoming more agitated. <em>“Or maybe warning me about Ginny Weasley, has that also slipped your mind ?”</em></p><p>Malfoy finally looked a bit uncomfortable, so she continued mercilessly.</p><p>“What about the countless times you insulted me and my friends, called me a mudblood ?” Hermione noticed her words getting louder, but she was unable to stop now.<br/> “And if I am such a horrible – but not annoying – mudblood, WHY DID YOU VISIT MY WHEN I WAS PETRIFIED?” The last part was almost a scream, and he visibly flinched at that.</p><p>“How did you know I – … where you conscious ? Did you hear what I said to you ?” Malfoy had blanched, looking horrified. Hermione realized that if she kept yelling, Mrs Pierce would probably show up and kick both of them out. So she tried to clam down.<br/> “No. Of course not. I was basically a statue.” Almost whispering, she added: “But I wish I had. Maybe than I would now why you are acting so … bloody confusing.”</p><p>To her surprise, Malfoy made a step closer – suddenly smiling mildly. It was a unusual sight, and also his close proximity made her a bit breathless.</p><p>“I thought you were smart. One should think you would have figured it out by now”, he mumbled still with that very concerning smile. Hermoine couldn't even form a coherent thought, so it wasn't sure if the word 'smart' applied to her anymore, as Draco slowly pushed one of her stray curls aside.</p><p>His long, jittery fingers awkwardly halted on her cheek. And before she could even process what was happening, he had leaned in and their lips brushed together.</p><p>After a few seconds he recoiled, as if had burned himself. Without another word he turned and quickly dissappeared.</p><p>He had left Hermione with a pounding heart, jittering knees and more confused than she had ever been before. She had been holding her breath, so she tried to get oxygen back into her frozen brain. To calm herself, she tried to collect all the facts: Draco Malfoy had just kissed her. It had been her first kiss. She had not disliked it.</p><p>The world didn't make sense anymore.</p><p align="center">*****</p><p>The next time Hermoine found herself face to face with Draco was three weeks later in the company of Harry and Ron, as he laughed over Hagrid's grief.</p><p>“Have you ever seen anything quite as pathetic?” he said smirking so horribly smug, it made Hermione sick. “And he’s supposed to be our teacher!”</p><p>Both Harry and Ron moved towards him, but Hermione was faster then them.</p><p>With a very satisfying smack, her hand collided with his cheek. She slapped him for being a gloating asshole. And for getting Hagrid's Hippogriff executed in the first place. For three years of insulting and pestering her best friends. For being confusing.</p><p>And most of all for for kissing her. Specifically for kissing her and than running away, avoiding her for three bloody weeks like the coward that he was.</p><p>Hermione wanted to scream all that into his face, but she didn't. As his incredulous eyes met her fiery glare, she knew that he understood.</p><p>That she wanted him to stay away. For good this time.</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <strong>1994</strong>
</p><p>Hermione felt bile raise up in her throat when she saw Draco. He was leaning against a tree, seeming very relaxed. While only a hundred meters away, a muggle family was being terrorized, floating over the heads of a few drunk wizards, that missed the glory days.</p><p>Most of the campers that had come for the Quidditch world cup were fleeing into the forrest. Including Harry, Hermione and the younger Weasley siblings.</p><p>But they had lost Fred, George and Ginny and found Draco Malfoy instead. Harry and Ron were exchanging insults with him, only Hermione avoided looking his way.</p><p>Just as he had done, when they had met earlier that day. In the dignitaries' box were they had both watched the game, Draco had been sitting between his parents, not deigning her with single glance. It kind of made her miss his usual staring.</p><p>Not that she wanted that scumbag to pay attention to her, but being ignored like a piece of furniture hadn't been a blast either. Now however he was acknowledging her presence, looking directly at her. In the dim light she was momentarily convinced to see worry in his expression. But his words didn't match.</p><p>"Granger, they’re after Muggles. Do you want to be showing off your knickers in midair ? Because if you do, hang around…they’re moving this way, and it would give us all a laugh." He mocked and she felt her face burn. She wanted to throw a witty comeback at his head, but her brain was numb and useless.</p><p>"Hermione’s a witch." Harry said heated, while she was busy trying not look hurt.</p><p>Why did his words even bother her anyway ? It was bloody foolish to think he would be nicer than usal.<em> Just because he had been the first boy that had ever kissed her ? </em></p><p>Clearly that hadn't been a big deal to him. And really, calling that a kiss was probably exaggerating. It had just been a very short pushing together of closed lips and he had acted like a prick ever since, and really what else should she have expected. Still, it wasn't a great feeling. She didn't even know why she cared. It wasn't, as if she even liked him. He was cruel and evil and she just wanted him to leave her alone.</p><p>"Have it your own way, Potter. If you think they can’t spot a Mudblood, stay where you are."</p><p>That was enough. Hermione grabbed both her friends that were ready to attack and tried to drag them away. She gave Malfoy a last deadly glare.</p><p>“Keep that big bushy head done, Granger!” Draco sneered at her, but there it was. That look of worry. Like he was warning her. Again. But Hermione just turned around and left, Harry and Ron in tow. He had no right to be worried, just as he had no right to kiss, insult or ignore her.</p><p>She still had to blink to suppress a few angry tears, advancing into the darkness of the forrest.</p><p align="center">*****</p><p>“That is correct, Mrs Granger. Five points for Gryffindor”, Professor Vektor praised.</p><p>Seeing as the only other students that had Arithmancy were in Slytherin and Rawenclaw, none of them really enjoyed Hermione's reward. Draco even leaned over to his seatmate and loudly whispered something unmistakably mocking her.</p><p>“Mr Malfoy, is there something you want to share with the class ?” The Professor barked at him. It wasn't the first time he had interrupted with his constant need to communicate, so naturally she was already a bit displeased.</p><p>“This has been going on long enough. I'm afraid I must separate you from Mr Zabini. Please switch places with Miss Turpin, before we begin with the partner work.”<br/> Hermione was gloating at Malfoy finally getting told off until she realized, that she was seated next to Lisa Turpin. The Rawenclaw girl had already picked up her things and walked to the front, were she took Malfoy's seat.</p><p>He looked furious, when he dropped his heavy notes a bit to forcefully as the Professor continued: “Very well. Now please open your books at page one hundred and twenty four and start working so solve the first five problems of continuity with your seatmate. You have thirty minutes.”</p><p>It turned out that they were actually really good at working together, as long as they talked about nothing else Arithmancy.</p><p>But of course, that didn't last very long. “Hey Granger, remember when you slapped me in the face for no reason and never apologized ?” Draco smirked, using the general noise of the others working to provoke her.</p><p>“Hey Malfoy, remember when you were being a total prick that deserved it?” she snapped and as Professor Vektor walked past them, continued through clenched teeth. “I guess it's a bit like with the third rule of continuity. Your actions have consequences. You had it coming.”</p><p>Malfoy chuckled: “I would argue against that. With the fifth rule, paradoxically stating that consequences are the symptom of chance and actions are always arbitrary and subjective.”</p><p>Hermione didn't want to be impressed, so she was angry instead. “Quit jabbering nonsense, Malfoy and let's keep working, I want to get this done as quickly as possible, so I'll be rid of you”, she hissed, forcefully stuffing her stubborn locks behind her ears.</p><p>“Your pretty when your pissed at me,” he said lowly, clearly hoping to make her uncomfortable. Hermione tried to ignore him by staring at her book, but her cheeks were burning and he didn't look away.</p><p>“Stop it", she muttered with none of the authority she wished for. He slided a little closer, grinning with fake innocence: “Stop what?”</p><p>Hermione was saved from answering, by Professor Vektor rushing over to them, to inspect their notes. “Mr Malfoy, Miss Granger – are you making any progress ?”</p><p align="center">*****</p><p>The gaggle of girls giggled at Viktor Krum and Hermione sighed. She was trying to work. But it was made impossible, because of Krum's fan club that was very noisily drooling over him.</p><p>She would inform them that this was a library, not a mating ground – but she didn't think that would help much. It wasn't the first time she had seen Krum lurking around between the shelves. He was probably working on solving that riddle to complete the second round of the triwizard tournament, in contrast to Harry who was content resting on his laurels from succeeding the first task. It made Hermione worry endlessly, but Harry didn't listen to her and Ron - reckless as ever - encouraged him to enjoy his break.</p><p>Suddenly she was pulled out of pondering the idiocy of her friends by the looming shadow of Viktor Krum. He had come over, to awkwardly stand in front of her table. Behind him she could see his fan club trowing her scornful looks.</p><p>“Erm, can I help you ?” She asked after a ten seconds of painful silence.<br/> “My name is Viktor Krum”, he unnecessarily and somewhat shyly introduced himself. It made her smile involuntarily and she extended a hand to him: “Hermione Granger.” He returned her smile and after a short hesitation sat down next to her, eying his hands.</p><p>“I am sorry, if this seems forvard Hermowninny – but I vonted to ask you, if you vould like to come to the Yule Ball.” He made a small, self-conscious pause and looked up. “Vith me, I mean.”</p><p>A warm, fuzzy feeling spread in her stomach and she felt herself blush a bit.<br/> “I-... yes. Yes, that would be lovely.”</p><p>It was than that she noticed someone glare at her, that wasn't making moony eyes at Viktor Krum all day.</p><p>Draco Malfoy was sitting across from her, half hidden behind about twenty books and appearing to be ready to murder. She just raised an condescending eyebrow at him and brightly smiled at her Yule Ball date.</p><p align="center">*****</p><p>Ron was acting like a crude buffoon. Just because he had not managed to ask her to go with him to the ball, he seemed determined to ruin the whole night for her. Harry was no help, seeing as he was too busy staring at Cho Chang.</p><p>Thankfully Viktor was a restrained but charming date, that made it easy to forget all about Ron's childish antics and they had a great time.</p><p>It been a beautiful night, not even Ron's bad manners and Draco Malfoy's very obnoxiously public drool swapping with Pansy Parkinson had been able to ruin it. After she and Viktor had grown tired of dancing, he offered to go outside to cool down and get some fresh air. Hermione gladly agreed.</p><p>They wandered through a labyrinth of glowing rosebushes, that seemed somewhat impossible considering that it was December. But the fairies nesting between the flowers gave away the magical nature of the garden. Sitting on a small stone bench next to a increasingly nervous Viktor, Hermoine broke the silence. “I had a great time tonight.” She said quietly not able to hide her smile, as Viktor carefully took her hand. Her heart began to pound a faster and she hoped her palms weren't sweaty.</p><p>“You are very beautiful, Harmowniny.” Hermione refrained from interrupting him to explain the correct pronunciation of her name again. It just wasn't the moment. And she kind of wanted him to go on. “And very smart, ve can talk. It's not like vith all the others.”</p><p>She beamed, to flustered to say something. Somehow she knew he was going to kiss her.</p><p>He was nervously looking from her eyes to her lips. Than he slowly cupped her face with his free hand, the other one still intertwined with hers between them. It was very soft and gentle. His lips felt warm and inviting.</p><p>After a while, they carefully opened up to each other until they were full on making out. But still the kiss felt very chaste and sweet.</p><p>When they separated they were both grinning. A fairy flying over their heads giggled, and through some glitter at them. Somehow it wasn't corny – just perfect.</p><p>They separated at the castle door with a second, shorter kiss. Hermione watched him disappear in the direction of the lake, to the ship were the Durmstrang students slept. When he was no longer visible in the dark, she allowed herself a little girly twirl.</p><p>Hermione still felt warm and giddy inside. It was new, so – so nice. She had been on a real date!<br/> With a nice, smart and interesting guy that fancied her and wasn't afraid to show it. Nothing and no one would be able to taint this memory for her now.</p><p>But a few steps later, as if the universe was determined to prove her wrong, she stumbled upon a certain blonde Slytherin.</p><p>He was leaning against the corridor wall – staring dead ahead, a bottle filled with suspicious brown liquid in his fist. Draco hadn't noticed her yet, so she shortly contemplated sneaking away. But something about his disheveled appearance made her halt. He looked so forlorn, downright miserable. Maybe if their positions were switched he would act differently, but Hermoine just couldn't turn her back on him in this state.</p><p>“Are you alright ?”, she cautiously asked, advancing. At that his head snapped up and he fixated her with alarmingly bloodshot eyes.<br/> “Where is your new boyfriend ?” he slurred viciously, clearly having consumend more than butterbeer. “Got sick of you already ?”</p><p>Hermione tried hard to remember her good intentions and took a deep breath. “Your drunk. Maybe you should go to your chambers.” The careful consideration in her tone didn't seem to work.</p><p>“Fuck you, Granger.” Draco suddenly spat, abruptly rounding in on her. “<em>Fuck you.</em> Fuck your pity, and fuck your stupid eyes and your face, looking at me like I'm a-... <em>just,</em> just fuck you.”</p><p>“I don't have to put up with this.” She hissed, forgetting all about helping. He was clearly a lost cause. So she whirled around and marched away. But he leaped after her, holding onto her arm.</p><p>When she threw him a angry look over her shoulder, his expression had changed. His eyes were wide and pleading. “Don't go. I- didn't mean … just”, he whispered desperately hiccuping. Hermione tore aways her arm to push her index finger into his chest.</p><p>“Listen carefully, Draco Malfoy.” She scolded, picking at him again. “I am not yours to insult, nor am I obliged to help you. We are not friends. All you ever do, is mock and ridicule me, as soon as there are other people around. I am sick and tried of you whole goddamn arrogant act. So turn around, go to bed and sleep off your inebriation. Before you something you'll regret.”</p><p>“Like kiss you?” He said, staring at her lips. Something in her knotted uncomfortably.</p><p>“Don't.” She gasped, as he crowded her against a wall. She didn't want this. Now that she knew how a nice, normal kiss should go down, Draco drunkenly advancing made her wary. Still her heart was pounding and her stomach clenching.</p><p>But then he suddenly started to laugh – loud and cruel. “As if I were interested in snogging a <em>mudblood</em> like you.”</p><p>She wanted to push him away face heating up, but he only swayed a little and just kept on talking.</p><p>“Although, you would probably let me. Since you put out for everyone now.” She gasped again, this time rage boiling in her veins, as Draco continued mercilessly. “Saw you basically eating his face in the bushes, that was horrifying. You should really work on your technique, Granger.”</p><p>“Go to hell.” She responded, attempting push him again. He was being a hypocrite, considering his sloppy shows of affection with that Parkinson cow, but Hermione was not going to stoop to his level and remind him.</p><p>“I would rather stay right here”, he mumbled, dropping his heavy head on her shoulder. All while still keeping her prisoner between his body, the wall and his arms. He smelt like sweat and liquor.</p><p>“Stop it, okay ?” She tried to wiggle away, but he was stronger. Than he slowly started mouthing along her neck and then jawline. His fingers roughly digging into her waist, wandering downwards.</p><p>Malfoy was actually trying to kiss her, but with more force and none of the consent than Viktor had.</p><p>“GET OFF ME!” She repeated, this time screaming. She tried to free herself with new energy. Finally he let go, but still blocked the way out with his slightly shaking body.</p><p>Hot tears were running down her cheeks, surely smearing her elaborate make-up.</p><p>“You disgusting prick”, she spat, hitting every bit of his chest she could aim at with her uncontrollable fist. “YOU TOTAL ASSHOLE! Like I would ever want you to –“, at a loss of what she didn't want him to do, she interrupted herself and stumbled backwards.</p><p>He hadn't moved, just stared lifelessly at his feet. After a few calming breath she saw, he was still suspicious limp and unresponsive. With a last repulsed glare in his direction, she pushed past him and hurried up to her common room.</p><p>Right into the arms of a grumpy Ron, looking for another fight.</p><p align="center">*****</p><p>The gossip hit it's peak right after Viktor had saved her from the lake in the second task and Rita Skeeter published an article painting Hermione as a calculating maneater. Somehow she had nothing else to report, so she liked to slut-shame fifteen year old girls. It was crystal clear that that women was a sad, pathetic individual. </p><p>Still Hermione would give anything to know how exactly Skeeter found out, that Viktor had invited her to come visit him over the summer. If she could only prove that that horrible person was doing something illegal.</p><p>She had also started to avoid all Slytherins at all coast, seeing as they tended to gleefully read her articles aloud whenever they saw her. It wasn't that it  bothered her that much, seeing herself above their childish taunting. But she still went out of their way in order of sparing her poor nerves. Most of all, Draco Malfoy. Although she didn't want to see him for a different reason.</p><p>After what had happened in the night of the Yule Ball, he had very obviously atemptted to talk to her a couple of times, but she had always turned on her heels and walked away, whenever he had approached her in an empty corridor.</p><p>Sadly they were still sitting next to each other in Arithmancy. She tended to pretend he wasn't there. Her unwillingness to talk to him, didn't stop him of course.</p><p>As everyone else was busy working, he leaned over: “Look, I just want to-...”</p><p>“Save it Malfoy, I don't care.” Hermione interrupted him as muted as her temper allowed.<br/> “Hear me out, for Merlins sake!” he hissed. <em>“I want to apologize.”</em></p><p>Startled, Hermione interrupted her scribbling. She hadn't expected that.<br/> “Honestly ? I didn't know that word was even in your vocabulary.”</p><p>“Well,” he chuckled bitterly, “you don't have a very high opinion of me, do you ?”</p><p>“Can you blame me ?” She shot back. He just shrugged. They continued working in silence.</p>
