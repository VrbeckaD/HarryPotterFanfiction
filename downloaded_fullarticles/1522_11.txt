    <p>“Thomas,” their coach called, and Dean ran up to collect his jersey. It was a dollar-store brand; made of cotton that stained his skin with its neon green dye. The team’s fingers, sticky from their cherry ice pops, were dotted with fuzz, and their backs-- which were sweaty from the Summer-- clung to their new shirts.<br/>
Dean fixes his, trying to pull the hem down far enough to cover his waist, which is longer than the other boys. Sometimes they call him a beanstalk for it.<br/>
One, whose skin is soft and pink like peaches, smiles at him. “Lucky jersey, mate,” he says, “Number nine.” There, on the front, it has been scribbled in sharpie, just under their team name: the Green Team. The ink bleeds into the material, so it cobwebs, and becomes blurred. “Since we’re nine years old, your jersey is lucky. I got a lousy twelve. That won’t be good for another three years, and there’s no way I’m playing football for another three years.” The boy is still smoothening his ice pop, pushing the melted flavor to the top, like you might do with toothpaste. His mouth is dyed red, and his eyes are bright blue, looking up at Dean like he expects something. When he finally walks away, he turns back curiously, but only for a second.<br/>
It starts raining later. It always rains in England, so grass becomes slick, and the kids can wash the sugar off their hands in the parking-lot-puddles. Dean’s cleats were damp with it, and his skin was so cold it raised into goose eggs.<br/>
Their game started when the thunder did, quiet enough that it only distracted the players, but the parents weren’t concerned. They were sitting in lawn chairs, and when Dean waved to his mum-- an umbrella in the crook of her armpit and a disposable camera protected under the hem of her blouse-- she shook her head “no.”<br/>
A boy, who Dean knows from cookouts and block parties but does not remember the name of, has his hands cupped around his mouth like a megaphone. “Hey, Thomas!” It’s the same volume he used last week, when Dean had been sitting on the curb to draw, and the boy was trying to kick a ball around with his friends. “Sod off, you wanker,” he smiled around his pb&amp;j, so his friends broke into hushed little giggles. That’s what the rain sounded, like, too. Whispering secrets during class, gossip, snickers covered with hands. It was so thick, that when the boy yelled for Dean to “Bloody do something,” his words were smothered by it.<br/>
Dean stares at the peach boy, who is no longer smiling. Even he, who does not like football, is bent at the knees. His hair is pinned to his forehead by rain, and his mouth is also open. Probably to yell at Dean to move, to get the ball, but Dean only hears his mother’s voice.  “I’m signing you up for football, Deanny. And I’m paying good money to do it. You need to make friends. You’ve got to promise me you’re gonna make friends.”<br/>
The ball was coming at him, slow, like everything was floating — last summer, when his Aunt Kelly let them swim in her pool, he remembered feeling this way— he couldn’t hear; it was slow, white-noise, heavy but soft. When he pumped his legs, it was like he wasn’t moving. Just running in place, slowing down the harder he tried. He couldn’t breathe.<br/>
Under him, the ball lands, sending rainwater onto the soles of his trainers; the edge of his kneecaps. In this great, chlorine-filled swimming pool, Dean kicks his leg just to float. Only this time, something acidic washes through him, rivers through his veins, running into each bone like watercolor. He feels the ball against the side of his foot, feels his energy crumple up through it, feels a rubber band inside of him stretch and release; sees it go flying.<br/>
The goal is on the other side of the field. Dean pictures the ball collapsing into that net, but it goes farther. Over the parents lined up in lawn chairs, their feet rested on coolers; over the chain fence, past the first row of blooming Spring trees.<br/>
Two years later, he gets a letter.<br/>
The mail delivery boy— it was that boy, that mean boy, riding around on his blue bicycle— throws it at him, along with a newspaper and one of his mom’s gardening magazines. “Seems like you’ve got a secret admirer, Thomas,” he says, beginning to ride off. He looks back to finish, “They’re fancy, too.”<br/>
Dean fumbles through the mail, leafing through his mother’s things until he reaches something he knows is different. An envelope, but not the thin, flimsy kind you can tear through. This is tough; it’s texture like the pores in skin, but gritty. The water color paper he’d been given last Christmas, or a cut that’s scabbed over. It’s the color of the coffee stains his Mum leaves on tables, except for the seal in the middle— a crayon-like, waxy circle-- which is a deep, burgundy red. Turning it over, Dean reads the address. First, his name, which he has never seen in such elegant scrawl before, nevermind printed on the back of a letter— as though he is an adult, who deserves to know things. Then, his home address, and finally, “The pretty room with all the paintings”.<br/>
He unlatches the little wooden fence to their back garden, his fingers stumbling around it as his other hand prys at the seal. He doesn’t say anything to his mom, only stands there, waiting for her to hear him puttering around and turn away from the rosemary she’s tampering with. She has the stereo on, playing one of those 50s hits she likes. It sounds tinny coming from there;  grating. Like it’s playing from the inside a drainage pipe.<br/>
She hums along to it, whispering “do you believe in magic”, the toes of her boots digging into the ground. When she turns around to take a sip of her lemonade, she only lifts her eyebrows in surprise. “Deanny? What’ch’ya doing there, love?”<br/>
He shifts, moving the rest of the mail so it’s tucked under his armpit, and hands her the letter. She reads the back, her eyebrows closing in together like knitting needles, the little wrinkle forming there a string of yarn. She takes off her thick gardening gloves and drops them in the grass next to her; slides the paper out gently. Dean stands with his legs crossed, nervously blinking, his lips pressing into his teeth.<br/>
She breathes. Looks up, her irises like the rising moon, and the pores in her skin caught with sweat and light. “You’re a wizard.”<br/>
The song playing from the stereo becomes suddenly clearer, as if it had rolled out onto open ground.</p><p> </p><p>    Steven O’Brien’s hair is a thick, curly stack. It is the color of a grocery-store orange, the kind that costs you a little extra because of how ripe it is. He haloes in the sun; gold in his fly-away strands, rings of light in his brown eyes. A lot of him exists that way, as though he was built by God to live in the outdoors. His hands are tough looking for an eleven year old’s: crusted around the edges and packed with dirt. His eyes bulge out of his head like a mosquito. That’s what Shay sees him as: a big, overgrown mosquito at the ear. His cheeks are red, and in this idea they’re like that from the blood he sucks out of you when he talks. But even though he has this annoying, buzzing quality, Seamus waits for him at the bus stop. It’s 2 p.m., when he normally returns from elementary school, stepping off that yellow bus Seamus has never gotten to see the innards of.

“Why don’t you ever go to school, Seamus?” he says on their walk home, kicking a stone the size of a golf ball back and forth between them. The sky is cloudy and dark, but the sun creeps through in places, lighting up the world like a flashlight might do under the palm of your hand. Steven kicks the stone. It skips on the tar like it’s lake water and tumbles into a drain.<br/>
Seamus feels his face go bright red, like that flashlight is in the inside of his brain, heating his whole face up. “Don’t know, Ste, why don’t you ever kick that stone within fifty feckin’ feet of me?”<br/>
“Sorry, mate. Just curious is all. Y’know the kids at school think I’m lying about ye’. T’ink you’re my imaginary friend or some shite like tha’. It’s not fair. Why’s it that I have ta’ go t’school every day, and your parents let ye’ stay home? It ain’t right, mate.”<br/>
“I told you. I go t’school. It’s just… y’know, private, like. Real elite. Ye’ve probably never heard of it,” Seamus shrugs. He always thought Steven was annoying and repetitive, like when a CD gets all scratched up; he keeps jumping from song to song, or looping over the same part again and again.<br/>
His mam and da used to say the same thing about him. “Ye’ talk too much, Seamus. People don’t like it when ye’ talk too much. It drives em mad— it drives me mad, actually. Part of growing up is realizing that other people don’t want to hear your thoughts all the time. They don’t want ta’ hear what ye’ t’ink about every little thing. Now that’s enough.”<br/>
Steven drops his backpack on the side of the curb and stalks into the woods. They live in South Eire, the rich side; one of those cornered off neighborhoods in an already small city. When his parents asked why he was so desperate not to go to an Irish Wizarding School, Seamus told them, “then I’d have ta’ keep living ‘ere. Ta’ only good the about Kenmare are the feckin’ Kestrals. I wish we lived in Dublin, like. Somewhere busier. More people. More ta’ do.”<br/>
His da didn’t like that. He’s all about Irish pride. “Wha’, and ye’ t’ink yer’ gonna get more ah’ dat in England, d’you? Listen ‘ere: t’ere’s only one t’ing those Brits are good for and it’s goddamn yuppy accents. Hogwarts ‘r whatever t’fuck don’t got a goddamn thing on Eire.”<br/>
Seamus looked to his mam, over his dad’s shoulder. She took a sip from her wine glass and shook her head.<br/>
Hogwarts is a yuppy school. Public, sure, not like the one his parents plan on sending him off to, but nice. It has Dumbledore. Even has its own yippity, successful quidditch team. And if Seamus likes anything, it’s quidditch.<br/>
Growing up in a muggle town just so your mom can lie about her identity for years means you have little to no time to enjoy being a wizard, aside from discovering that you can give wedgies to little arse holes just through sheer will, or that you can be the smallest yet the scariest boy around the block.<br/>
Seamus didn’t know he was a wizard until he was five. Which, yeah, he supposes isn’t too shabby compared to the rotten deal muggleborns are handed. But still, being a kid and watching your dad have a mental breakdown in the middle of a family dinner is a pretty life changing experience.<br/>
“You’re not a witch, you feckin’ crazy satanic cunt—“ is what he said before Seamus’ mam pulled out her wand and gave him a big tattoo of a lady’s No-No-Zone on his forehead. He dropped his fork and knife.<br/>
She rolled up her sleeves, stood up from the table, and started panting, real heavy like. “Who’s the cunt now, huh?”<br/>
Then of course, his dad started screaming, and then she started yelling back, even louder, like she had magicked an invisible megaphone— “Oh, yeah? That scare yer’ little Catholic heart, does it? Well guess feckin’ what— your son’s a fecking witch too! And I’ll be raisin’ him as one!”<br/>
Seamus got his extensive vocabulary from his parents’ rows, which were shockingly less frequent now that they’re separated. They live in the same house, of course; divorce is a sin, a sin against God. Seamus can’t really make sense of that, seeing as they were wizards n’ all anyhow, but his mam says: “Just cause we were born witches don’t mean we have ta’ be sinners, now does it? Yer’ da and I don’t love each other anymore, but that doesn’t mean we revoke t’promise we made to t’Lord.”<br/>
Cursing is also a sin, then. Swearing means soap in your mouth, or a rotten smack on the shoulder, or cleaning up even though Seamus’ mam knows perfectly well she can do it ten times faster.<br/>
“But ye’ swear all’t feckin’ time,” Seamus said, his hair wet from running through the sprinklers, Ste sprawled out in the grass behind him. They were seven, and his mam had just had another fight with his da, this one so loud they could hear it under the spray.<br/>
“When you get middle aged and have a runty, devilish boy and a good-for-nothing man following ye’ around, ye’ tell me how easy it is not t’feckin’ swear— now shut yer’ mouth before I make ye’ say that in front of yer’ grandmo’ter, how’s that sound?”<br/>
She gave him a hard pat on his cheek, one that made his raw skin turn white under her palm. As she turned to go to her car, he kicked into the dirt and tried to yell. He couldn’t. He swallowed his voice and looked down to his shoes, at first shyly, then in horror. The toes of his new sneakers were lit up in a fire as orange as Ste’s hair, heating up his feet and blackening the rubber. He felt pieces of them pop like popcorn, burn his shins and knees, rest ash on his skin so it blended in with all the freckles there. He fell back on his arse, screaming and yelling, kicking his feet into the grass. Ste ran over to help him, but before he could get a word out, his mom had extinguished the flames with nothing but her eyes. She shook her head at Seamus. He fell back into the grass and didn’t talk the rest of the evening.</p>
