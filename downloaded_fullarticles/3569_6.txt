  <em> Potter, </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> This letter had better find you in good health. Merlin knows I wouldn’t usually be doing this but you quite literally handed me another chance at life <strike> that I didn’t ask for. </strike> I’m quite grateful to have been given another opportunity; thank you for that. If you hadn’t testified, I wouldn’t have received this second shot, <strike> though I don’t deserve it (but it beats rotting in Azkaban). </strike> </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> I plan on returning to Hogwarts to make up our seventh year and heard Granger is going back, along with Longbottom and Chang. Haven’t heard anything about you or Weasley, though. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> Also, I’m sorry to hear about your owl Hedwig. She was quite beautiful. </em>
</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Malfoy,</p>
<p>Thanks. And it wasn’t a problem. I meant what I said; you didn’t (and don’t) deserve to go to Azkaban. We were kids. We still are, actually. And I don’t know what I’m going to do, if I’m being honest. At first I thought I’d join the Aurors straight after the war. I don’t really know what I want, though; I’ve spent my whole life just trying to stay alive. Hermione thinks I should go back and take the year to figure out what I want and who I am without having someone trying to kill me once a year. <strike> Why did I just tell you all that? </strike></p>
<p>Just curious, why are you writing to me? <strike> Not that I mind or anything. </strike></p>
<p align="right">Potter</p>
<p> </p><hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em> Potter, </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> Are you really that dim? I was thanking you for speaking at my trial. No wonder you weren’t in Ravenclaw. <strike> Though I’m sure you would’ve done well in any house. </strike> </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> I simply figured you’d be bored out of your mind and missed my presence. I am great company, after all. I’m sure you know this already, but I’ve been sending letters to those I’ve wronged, including Granger and the Weasleys. <strike> I hope they can see I am genuinely ashamed of my actions. </strike> </em>
</p>

  <em> Cordially, </em>

<p align="right">
  <em>Malfoy</em>
</p>
<p align="right"> </p><hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>Malfoy,</p>
<p>I was there when they got the letters; I’ve been staying with the Weasleys all summer. Ron’s parents basically adopted me as soon as I became friends with him in first year. <strike> I also don’t have a home to go back to, so… </strike></p>
<p>They were pretty surprised you apologized at all. They appreciated it, though. I’m sure you’ve received their owls by now.</p>
<p>I’m kind of touched you thought about me at all. Something you want to tell me? Sounds more like you missed me.</p>
<p align="right">Potter</p>
<p> </p><hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>Potter,</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> I forgot to mention– I think a year at Hogwarts before you decide on anything would do you good. That’s smart of Granger, and I have to agree <strike>(not that you care or anything)</strike>.  We both have been pushed into roles we probably would not have otherwise chosen. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> Granger’s quick forgiveness was… surprising. My family (and myself, of course) did her more harm than we did others. Granger and I have been corresponding since the trials ended, and she seems to care for you. <strike> It’s no wonder there’s a rumor that you’re together. </strike> You have a great friend in Granger; she’s quite strong and compassionate. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> And, please, Potter. The world doesn’t revolve around you. I did <strong>not</strong> miss you. Contrary to popular belief, you are not as special as people say you are. There’s nothing extraordinary about you <strike> (except your stupid skills and stupid scar and stupid good looks and stupid luck). </strike> </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> The Weasleys are rather kind, I will admit. </em>
</p>
<p align="right">
  <em> Respectfully, </em>
</p>
<p align="right">
  <em>Malfoy</em>
</p>
<p align="right"> </p><hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>Malfoy,</p>
<p>Maybe. I try not to think about it. Saving people has kind of been ingrained into me… I don’t think I would have chosen not to save them. <strong>But</strong> I would have liked to know I was being raised to inevitably die before that day arrived. I suppose I have Dumbledore and his obsession with the “greater good” to thank for that.</p>
<p>I don’t know what you’ve heard, but Hermione and I aren’t dating. <strike> She’s with Ron, and they can be annoying sometimes. </strike> She is brilliant though. Definitely wouldn’t have gotten through Hogwarts without her.</p>
<p>Are you sure about that, Malfoy? Some say I’m pretty good at Defence and Quidditch. I did manage to beat you every time, remember?  Or are you still a sore loser?</p>
<p>It’s scribbled out rather aggressively, but did you just write “and stupid good looks”? Sounds like a back-handed compliment to me.</p>
<p>How come you decided to return to Hogwarts, anyway?</p>
<p align="right">Potter</p>
<p> </p><hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em> Potter, </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> If you must know, <strike>which you should since you were at my trial and heard my sentencing,</strike> it’s part of my probation. However, I think I would have chosen to return to Hogwarts regardless. Mother believes a completed education is more beneficial than one left unfinished. Additionally, I need as much in my favour as I can get, and an Outstanding on my Potions N.E.W.T.s will help me become a potions master much quicker. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> The only reason I didn’t win at Quidditch was because of you distracting me. You may be good at Defence, but you’re useless at Potions. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> I don’t know what you’re insinuating, Potter, but you are not <strong>that</strong> attractive. Get over yourself. </em>
</p>
<p align="right">
  <em> Reluctantly, </em>
</p>
<p align="right">
  <em>Malfoy</em>
</p>
<p> </p><hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>Malfoy,</p>
<p>Relax, I’m just joking.</p>
<p>I remember that you have to stay in the country for a few years, report to the Ministry monthly, and that you have to visit the Muggle world weekly, but that’s about it. I’m quite forgetful. Sorry about that.</p>
<p>You want to become a potions master? Would you ever teach at Hogwarts? Anyway, you’ll definitely get that Outstanding. From what I remember, you were talented at Potions, <strike> though that could have been because of Snape. That sounds mean, never mind. </strike></p>
<p>So you <b> <em>are</em> </b> admitting I’m attractive then?</p>
<p>Don’t worry, I won’t tell unless you want me to. <strike>I think you’re handsome too.</strike> I’m also into blokes. Haven’t told that many people though.</p>
<p align="right">Harry</p>
<p> </p><hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em> Potter, </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> It seems you remember more than you let on. Is there something you want to tell <strong>me</strong>? Maybe you’d like to accompany me to the Muggle world sometime; <strike>it’s absolutely terrifying.</strike> </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> Yes, I want to become a potions master. Didn’t I just mention that? While I would enjoy working at Hogwarts, I am sure the parents wouldn’t want a former Death Eater teaching their children. Maybe in another lifetime. And I’m quite good at potions without Snape, <strong>thank you.</strong> </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> I– Yes, I guess I am. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> The Savior is into blokes? I’m sure all your fans will be devastated. </em>
</p>
<p align="right">
  <em> Warmly, </em>
</p>
<p align="right">
  <em> Malfoy </em>
</p>
<p> </p><hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco,</p>
<p><strike>I’ve always found you attractive and it drove Ron and Hermione mad.</strike> I don’t know, Draco. There seems to be something on your mind. Are you asking me on a date to the Muggle world, or are you just scared of going by yourself?</p>
<p>I think you’d make a decent professor. Don’t let your past decide your future. You’re the one in control now. And I’m sure you’re quite skilled at potions without Snape.</p>
<p>I’m into the person, if that helps you put it together.</p>
<p>If you do ask, the answer is yes, by the way.</p>
<p align="right">Harry</p>
<p> </p><hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em> Harry, </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> Fine. Will you go to dinner with me at St. John (it’s a Muggle restaurant) in two days time (this Tuesday night), 8 p.m.? </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> And thank you for the kind words. </em>
</p>
<p align="right">
  <em> Kindly, </em>
</p>
<p align="right">
  <em> Draco </em>
</p>
<p> </p><hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco,</p>
<p>That’s on my birthday...</p>
<p align="right">Harry</p>
<p> </p><hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em> Scared, Potter? </em>
</p>
<p align="right">
  <em> Draco </em>
</p>
<p> </p><hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>You wish.</p>
<p align="right">See you then,</p>
<p align="right">Harry</p>
<p> </p><hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em> Harry, </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> I had a <strike>decent</strike> great time yesterday. I’m glad you didn’t hide me from the Weasleys; I know how important they are to you. <strike> I thought you’d be ashamed of being seen with me. </strike> </em>
</p>
<p align="right">
  <em> Yours, </em>
</p>
<p align="right">
  <em> Draco </em>
</p>
<p> </p><hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco,</p>
<p>I had a really great time too. And of course I wasn’t going to hide you. They’re my family. They liked you, in case you were wondering.</p>
<p align="right">See you at Sunday brunch,</p>
<p align="right">Harry</p></div>
