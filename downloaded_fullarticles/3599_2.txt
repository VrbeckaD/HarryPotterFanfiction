<strong>These prayers ain't working anymore</strong><br/>
<strong>Every word shot down in flames</strong><br/>
<strong>What's left to do with these broken pieces on the floor?</strong><br/>
<strong>I'm losing my voice calling on you</strong><br/>
<strong>'Cause I've been shaking</strong><br/>
<strong>I've been bending backwards till I'm broke</strong><br/>
<strong>Watching all these dreams go up in smoke</strong><br/>
<strong>Let beauty come out of ashes</strong><br/>
<strong>Let beauty come out of ashes</strong><br/>
<strong>And when I pray to God all I ask is</strong><br/>
<strong>Can beauty come out of ashes?</strong><br/>
<strong>Can you use these tears to put out the fires in my soul?</strong><br/>
<strong>'Cause I need you here, woah</strong><br/>
<strong>'Cause I've been shaking</strong><br/>
<strong>I've been bending backwards till I'm broke</strong><br/>
<strong>Watching all these dreams go up in smoke</strong><br/>
<strong>Let beauty come out of ashes</strong><br/>

It wasn’t like he planned on having a future with Draco Malfoy. Nope. Never. Not in a billion years. This was purely an apology-based dinner invitation from him to Draco.</p><p> </p><p>His brain just scoffed, <em>So why is your heart pounding away, and your stomach filled with butterflies?</em></p><p> </p><p>Okay, okay so maybe Harry had a thing for the blond ever since his eleven-year-old self and Draco met on the stairs of Hogwarts. He had hidden it well over the years and just channeled it into anger at the annoying prat. But anger is just a different form of passion, and his cock got hard whether he was longing for Draco or yelling at him.</p><p> </p><p>Tonight's dinner date…well, apology dinner was the result of what had happened two weeks ago. Harry’s hand shook at the mere memory of that horrible night. His stomach was sick, and he felt excess moisture pooling in his eyes as he remembered.</p><p> </p><p>
  <b>Two Weeks Prior</b>
</p><p> </p><p>Harry hadn’t planned on hurting Draco. He had only followed Malfoy when the distraught man had walked out of the Great Hall after seeing Katie Bell was back from St. Mungo's Hospital.</p><p> </p><p>As he had walked to the bathroom door and heard Draco’s sobs, it had ripped Harry to shreds. His feet had propelled him forward into the room. It was so hard when that beautiful pale face was lifted up, and the sink's mirror reflected those tear-stained cheeks back to Harry.</p><p> </p><p>He wanted to hug the guy, but that wasn’t in the cards. Instead, he heard himself saying, “I know what you did, Malfoy. You hexed her, didn’t you?”</p><p> </p><p>Draco’s sorrowful face instantly transformed into an angry sneer as the guy turned and tried to hex Harry. Well, fuck if that didn’t get the fire burning in him and Harry suddenly had his wand raised and was fighting back. It had been scary and yet oddly invigorating to chase the prat…almost like an intense version of foreplay.</p><p> </p><p>Harry’s cock had been rock hard as they used their burgeoning skills to the test. And hell if seeing Draco almost maim him didn’t make him want to shove the guy against the stone wall and kiss the shit out of the fucker.</p><p> </p><p>They had been in a bubble of angry, fiery, and passionate fighting when THAT word had escaped from Harry’s mouth.</p><p> </p><p>He had heard Malfoy’s footsteps coming closer as he turned the corner and they were facing each other. Before he could think about what he was doing his wand was raised, and his mouth said, “Sectumsempra!”</p><p> </p><p>Draco gasped and fell backward…only the guy’s feet showed past the block of stalls. Harry didn’t know what he had expected, but it was at least to have the man moving…</p><p> </p><p>But nothing…Not one damn thing!</p><p> </p><p>As he moved closer Harry’s heart was thumping, and dread filled every strand of his DNA. He was half afraid to see what had happened.</p><p> </p><p>When he turned past the last stall and saw Draco’s body lying in the puddle of water, Harry couldn’t breathe. Even still he had a slight hope it wasn’t as bad as it seemed…so he kept moving forward.</p><p> </p><p>But what he saw was much worse. As he got right up to Draco, the water was turning red from the massive amount of blood pouring from the deep slashes all over the guy’s body. Harry didn’t know what to do.</p><p> </p><p>He had done this!</p><p> </p><p>Draco might be dying and all because of him. He wanted to kneel down and beg forgiveness to make things better. But he was frozen to the spot.</p><p> </p><p>And that was when a rush of black robes moved past his right arm as Snape ran over to Draco and knelt down accessing the damage. Harry felt even worse seeing the look of accusation in those black eyes. It was too much between that stare and the self-loathing already inside…Harry raced out of the bathroom and ran back to the safety of the Gryffindor common room.</p><p> </p><p>But as much as the place normally made him feel at home, he couldn't relax. He had no clue if Snape was able to help Draco or if the beautiful blond was now dead. Harry’s soul was tormented even beyond what any Dementor could have tried. That was why when Ron and Hermione came to check up on him they found him huddled by the fireplace.</p><p> </p><p>Ginny came in then which just made Harry feel worse. He had settled for her when he had given up on changing things between him and Draco. And when she took him to the room of requirements, to hide the potion book and kissed him…Harry had known, once and for all, it was Draco or no one.</p><p> </p><p>When he hadn't responded to the kiss, Ginny sighed. “It's Malfoy isn't it?”</p><p> </p><p>That shocked him, “I…what do you mean?”</p><p> </p><p>“Harry, I've always seen the way you look at him. Maybe other people don't notice because they never stared at you as much as I did, but still, it was pretty obvious.”</p><p> </p><p>Like Harry needed to feel even worse, “I'm sorry, Ginny. I never meant to hurt you.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hurt me? I knew what I was getting into when I agreed to go out with you. I'm here for whatever you want to share with me. I simply enjoy your company, Mr. Potter.”</p><p> </p><p>This had him moving into her arms and letting her warm hug soothe him. “Why couldn't it have been you? Why did my heart fall for Draco?”</p><p> </p><p>Ginny softly laughed, “Because you're both so alike.”</p><p> </p><p>“What? How?”</p><p> </p><p>Her fingers stroked gently through his dark hair, “You're both essentially good, but at the same time have this wicked side. You both love to banter and argue. You both are fiercely loyal even when you shouldn't be and willing to do whatever it takes when you put your mind to it.”</p><p> </p><p>“I'm screwed, aren't I?”</p><p> </p><p>A kiss was pressed to the top of Harry's head, “Very much.”</p><p> </p><p>“What if…what if I killed him, Ginny?”</p><p> </p><p>She felt tears dripping down her neck. “How about I go find out what happened before we go there…okay?”</p><p> </p><p>Harry moved back and nodded, “Thank you, Ginny.”</p><p> </p><p>He waited for her return with hope and dread. As he moved around in a haze not really taking anything in, his brain only slightly registered the dusty vanishing cabinet, or the wooden box resting on the table that seemed to be calling out to him. All that was background noise as Harry just begged the universe that somehow Snape had been able to save Draco.</p><p> </p><p>Five minutes later he heard the sound of a door forming and then disappearing. “Harry?”</p><p> </p><p>He raced back and tried to gauge what Ginny had found out by the look on her face. “Well?”</p><p> </p><p>A big grin spread across her face, “He's fine, Harry. Snape knew the counter-spell and was able to reverse the damage. Draco's down in the infirmary for observation.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry hugged her and spun her around as such joy flooded his soul. “Thank the universe! I…I need to go see him…I have to let him know how I feel.”</p><p> </p><p>Ginny shook her head, “I don't think that's wise, Harry.”</p><p> </p><p>“But he almost died, Ginny. I don't want to waste any more time.”</p><p><br/>
“I understand that, but not today. Yes, Draco is not dead, but he isn't himself yet. Give him some time to recover.”</p><p>  </p><p>Running fingers through his tousled hair, Harry sighed, “Fine but don't let me chicken out when the time is right.”</p><p> </p><p>Ginny held out her pinkie, “I promise.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry entwined his pinkie with hers, “Thank you.”</p><p> </p><p>As the started to walk to the entrance way, Ginny turned and smiled over to him, “How about we sneak out of the castle and go to Hogsmeade. We can get Madame Rosmerta to give us a private room, and she can make us an ooey-gooey cheese pizza.”</p><p> </p><p>“As much as I'd enjoy that, I'm sure Dumbledore is going to be calling for me soon.”</p><p> </p><p>Ginny placed an arm around Harry's shoulder, “My point exactly. Pizza or talk to Dumbledore.”</p><p> </p><p>Her wisdom sunk in, and Harry said, “Let's do it.”</p><p> </p><p>So they used the Marauder's map and snuck out of one of the secret tunnels. Harry and Ginny's friendship only strengthened as they shared the pizza and spent the night just enjoying each other's company.</p><p> </p>
