    <h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
    <p>Hogwarts, with its many turrets and towers and numerous hallways, was as much a historical landmark as a stronghold for wizarding knowledge. Through countless centuries it had housed and nurtured generations of witches and wizards.</p>
<p>But, on this day, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry was burning.</p>
<p>Sending their small group to their knees, a thunderous explosion shook the entire foundation of the castle. Two second-year Slytherins who had been clinging tightly to Namjoon were tossed flat on their backs. Seokjin Kim quickly scrambled forward. He paused long enough to help the first-year Hufflepuff who was struggling to find her footing in the tattered remains of her school robes. They had barely moved when large chunks of the damaged wall came crashing down on the spot they had been in.</p>
<p>"Namjoon!" Seokjin called, eyes watering against the dust storm from the debris. "Namjoon-ah!"</p>
<p>He could hear the poor girl coughing heavily as he crouched over her small form. He tightened his grip on her shoulders and blindly pushed forward, making sure to shield the younger student as they stumbled through the crumbling hallway.<br/>
<br/>
It seemed almost no time had passed since the student body was assembled in the Great Hall and Voldemort's ultimatum was made. Turn in one Harry Potter or they will all suffer.</p>
<p>Rather than conceding, Professor McGonagall made the call for the students' evacuation, and the hall had emptied quickly. It had been stupid, but his body had reacted before he had even had the chance to really digest the news that the castle would soon be under attack. Before he had realized what he was doing, his feet were already at a full sprint down the familiar path toward the Slytherin common room. As a seventh-year Hufflepuff, the speed with which he made the trip, dodging down hidden hallways and skipping over trick stairways, should be an anomaly, but when dating the Slytherin Head Boy, one quickly learns all the best ways to and from the area for their midnight rendezvous. This served him well as he made his mad dash.</p>
<p>Then again, he couldn't really regret his actions. As he had rounded the dungeon corner, he was greeted by the sight of Namjoon directing the prefects to take the younger students to the evacuation passage for Hog's Head Inn. Seokjin felt a pang of guilt that he hadn't stayed back to do the same for the students in his own house, despite not being in a position that obligated him to do so. Yoongi had always been the more responsible one. However, as Namjoon turned around and their eyes met, whatever reservations he had quickly disappeared.<br/>
<br/>
Seokjin quickly ran to Namjoon's side and was relieved to see the Head Boy meet him halfway. It was a short hug, but Seokjin imagined he could hear his ribs cracking under the pressure of Namjoon's arms. He wasn’t about to complain. Besides, he was sure holding onto Namjoon just as tightly, if not more so. Taking a deep breath where his face was pressed into the crook of Namjoon's neck, he felt himself calming at the familiar scent of parchment and ink that clung to his boyfriend like cologne.<br/>
<br/>
However, like all good things, the hug ended and Namjoon pulled away. Seokjin couldn't help but feel disconcerted by the blank look on Namjoon’s face, something he only ever wore when under extreme duress.<br/>
<br/>
"Two of the second years are missing. Baddock says they were probably in the library," Namjoon said before Seokjin could voice his question. "I don't think they heard the announcements."<br/>
<br/>
"Oh, no," he felt his stomach drop at the thought of the younger students lost in the mess of the incoming battle. "We have to go get them!"<br/>
<br/>
"No, Seokjin, <em> we </em> don't have to do anything. You need to head back up to your house. I'll go look for them. I'm the Head Boy."<br/>
<br/>
"And you're also crazy if you think I'm letting you go by yourself, Joonie."<br/>
<br/>
"Just this once, can you not argue with me. Not about this, please. I would feel much better if I knew you were — "<br/>
<br/>
"You can waste time arguing with me, or we could go grab the kids and get the hell out of here."<br/>
<br/>
"Jin, you can't just — "<br/>
<br/>
"No."<br/>
<br/>
"Ji — "<br/>
<br/>
"No."<br/>
<br/>
"Stop — "<br/>
<br/>
"Nope."<br/>
<br/>
"Gods damn it, Jin!" Namjoon finally exploded.<br/>
<br/>
Seokjin was quick to yell right back, "No, I'm not leaving, and that's final! What happened to you, Joonie? You used to listen so well!"<br/>
<br/>
It could have been fairly amusing, but given the circumstances, Namjoon's bulging eyes and opened-mouth glare of speechless rage would simply have to be saved in Seokjin's mind bank for later perusal. He knew he won, anyway. He generally did. Namjoon might have the brains, being the smartest Slytherin in seventh year, but there was little logic could do in the face of pure obstinate stubbornness. Something that Seokjin had in abundance and was forced to harness after years of dealing with the other members of their small group of friends.<br/>
<br/>
Seokjin spared a moment and sent a quick prayer to whichever deity was listening for the others to make it out okay.<br/>
<br/>
His musing ended abruptly when a pulse of magic rumbled through the entire castle.<br/>
<br/>
"They're sending up the barrier,” Namjoon said.<br/>
<br/>
They shared a wide eyed glance before taking off down the corridor, Namjoon's hand automatically reaching out and grasping Seokjin's.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, their search for the missing second years took longer than either of them anticipated. They had assumed the boys would be easily found in the library, but it was empty when they arrived. The only good thing to come from their frantic hunt was finding the small first year Hufflepuff who had also been absent during the announcements and had been lost in the subsequent mess.<br/>
<br/>
Namjoon still refused to leave until they were sure of the boys' whereabout. It was fortunately not much later that they were finally able to find the boys huddling behind a column as the old statues of the knights lining the halls were summoned to the school entrance.<br/>
<br/>
"Birtwistle! Plaskitt!" Namjoon barked as they dodged around the marching knights. "Where the fuck were you? We're evacuating, come on!"<br/>
<br/>
It wasn't a moment too soon. Namjoon grabbed both boys by the hood of their robes and tugged them after him. Seokjin internally winced at the rough treatment but uncharacteristically kept his opinion to himself.</p>
<p>They had barely managed a few steps when it seemed like the entire world around them was consumed by a loud hissing screech. Moving as one, their group stopped to look out the nearby window. The young Hufflepuff girl — Humphreys was her name, if Seokjin was remembering correctly — gave a shuddering gasp as bits and pieces of the sky began to glow red and appeared to be burning away in patches. </p>
<p><br/>
"Well, that's not good,” he couldn't help but say.<br/>
<br/>
"They're getting through the shield,” Namjoon said.<br/>
<br/>
Seokjin saw the Head Boy's knuckles turn white as he tightened his grip on the younger boys.<br/>
<br/>
"We have to hurry. The professors said the passage is on the seventh floor."<br/>
<br/>
That was all urging they needed to jump into action. As they ran, Seokjin could make out the last of the red glow dying, signaling the complete failure of the shield. He thought he could hear the distant sound of disapparation and discordant but eerily human-like howls.<br/>
<br/>
It was a good thing that compartmentalizing panic was an old trick he had plenty of practice with, particularly during the summer of fifth year when he gave himself the suicidal quest of teaching Namjoon how to cook. </p>
<p>Now here they were, stumbling through the broken halls while ushering three lower year students through the maze of falling stone and wood. From the moment the shields fell, all hell broke loose inside the castle. The beauty and horror of the situation all boiled down to the instantaneous effects of magic. Disapparation brought the enemy to them that much quicker, flashes of sickly but vibrant green brought death that much closer, and as they ignored the burning in their lungs to power forward through the chaos, Seokjin could fully appreciate the double edged sword that was the gift of magic.</p>
<p>From the perspective of a half-blood, Seokjin secretly knew that this irony was something that he could never fully share with Namjoon.</p>
<p>Namjoon, who with his old and very magical lineage, could never fully understand the often wild temptation of falling back into the safety and comfort of the mundane. Namjoon, whose mind was so often lost in the convoluted theories pertaining to the mystical realm of magical research, would never fully appreciate the charm of a simple properly prepared meal. Namjoon, who despite having all the possibilities of magic open to him, could not have possibly shown Seokjin, a simple half-blooded Hufflepuff, any more love and affection than he had in all the time they've known one another.</p>
<p>And all these thoughts rushed through his mind when he looked up.</p>
<p>Pure, unadulterated panic consumed him as the dust cleared, and he could clearly see. Namjoon, his foundation and eternal source of happiness, was standing stock still, across from him were a pair of Snatchers, both sporting identical malicious grins.</p>
<p>The students watched as the eyes of the men roamed over them. It wasn’t hard to see what the men were thinking: this was easy pickings.</p>
<p>No one dared to breathe.</p>
<p>Time slowed down to a crawl, and even the settling dust appeared frozen in the air as the entirety of Seokjin’s focus zeroed in on the scene before him.</p>
<p>Then, probably driven by a sudden rush of adrenaline, and a protective streak the size of the Atlantic, Seokjin decided to fuck it.</p>
<p>These Snatchers were looking for a kill and would rather gleefully see to it that they all met their grisly end. Maybe it was from living in what was essentially a wartime institution for the past year, but he was done with fear.</p>
<p>Suddenly, all he had was anger.</p>
<p>One year’s worth of stress was bubbling through him, desperately needing an outlet and these two fools in front of him were prime targets. Let them know the wrath of House Hufflepuff.</p>
<p>The ugly shit-face standing in front of Namjoon was just opening his mouth for what Seokjin could only assume was useless, villainy trash talk, but no one would ever know.</p>
<p>Seokjin took a note right out of Han Solo’s book of criminal dealings and fucking shot first.</p>
<p>He sent a powerful<em> confringo </em>, viciously aimed at the head of the Snatcher standing farther away. The trajectory of the spell also forced the closer man to duck to the side to avoid harm. Both men were taken by surprise, and the less fortunate of the two Snatchers only manage to avoid a head on collision with the blasting spell but took the brunt of it to his shoulder.</p>
<p>A large spray of blood erupted from the tattered remains of what was once the man’s biceps while his forearm was sent flying into the castle wall with a horrifying <em> splat </em>.</p>
<p>As the man let out a hair raising scream, Namjoon thankfully only spared a second to take in the sight before tossing up a <em> protego </em> and grabbing both shell-shocked younger years back toward Jin and the Hufflepuff girl. The shield came up none too soon as the uninjured Snatcher was quick to ignore the plight of his fellow wizard and occupied himself with tossing a few <em> crucio </em> their way.</p>
<p>Right before the shield collapsed, they all ducked behind a statue, Namjoon and Jin making sure to keep the younger students behind them. They both shared a meaningful look. This was possibly the worst case scenario for them. The men were in between them and their destination, and they were sitting ducks.</p>
<p>While the wounded man continued to holler in pain, punctuated by a series of slurs and curses that made Seokjin really wish he could throw a silencer at him, the other Snatcher also took the opportunity to take cover behind one of the many statues decorating the hallway as well.</p>
<p>Namjoon peeked around the side as they all took the moment to calm their racing hearts.</p>
<p>“There's one behind Morgana the Mad on the right. I think you got the other one’s wand arm so we might be alright there,” Namjoon whispered.</p>
<p>Seokjin nodded, ignoring the nausea bubbling up at the memory.</p>
<p>Instead, he spared the younger students a quick glance before asking, “So what do we do? That's the only way to go. I don't think they’re just going to let us go back the way we came.”</p>
<p>There was a moment of silence as they let the situation sink in.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a raspy call came from the other end of the hall, “Now, kiddies! That wasn't a very nice thing you did there to my friend here.”</p>
<p>This was punctuated by more semi-incoherent curses from the bleeding man.</p>
<p>“How about you make this easy for me and my friend and just come out. I promise we can make this quick.”</p>
<p>“Like fuck we are,” the one still twisting around on the ground chose that moment to join the conversation, “I'm gonna fucking kill you, you little bitch! Fucking blood-traitor whore, I'm going to fuck you up. Magic is too good for your kind! I'm going to tear that fucker apart with my bare hands!”</p>
<p>“Ah, shut your whining trap, Abney,” Raspy yelled, then cleared his throat and continued addressing them, “like I said, quick. I can be an understanding man. There's nowhere to run, kiddies, so why waste any of our time?”</p>
<p>Humphreys, the young Hufflepuff, was shivering and sobbing, while both Slytherin boys’ faces had lost all color.</p>
<p>Namjoon’s face hardened, and he whispered, “Okay, here’s what we’re going to do. I hold a shield while you lot run for cover. Go toward the Morgana the Mad statue; it's the only one big enough to cover all of you.”</p>
<p>“But that's where the Snatcher is,” Plaskitt, the wiry Slytherin, finally spoke up.</p>
<p>“Yes, but he would have to run out and reach all the way around to get to you. And you will have Seokjin to keep you safe.”</p>
<p>“What about the other one,” Birtwistle asked.</p>
<p>This time Seokjin answered, “His wand arm is gone. The most he can do is growl at us. What about you, Namjoon?”</p>
<p>“I'll drop the shield once you're safe, and you can cover me. I think I can get behind the armor across from all of you, and I can try to get him from there.”</p>
<p>“Joonie! No.”</p>
<p>“Why? We don't have another choice. Besides,” he smiled and those blasted dimples were on full display, “you wouldn't let anything happen to me. I trust you, hyung.”</p>
<p>Damn him! Namjoon knew what he was doing. Seokjin could only sputter a bit, but he knew the battle was over; Namjoon had already won. It was unfair of the asshole to use his gift (mainly the dimples) for evil, but he did, and Seokjin had to reluctantly go along and hoped this shit didn't blow up in all their faces.</p>
<p>“Fine. But if you get us all killed, no one is going to stop me from saying I told you so.”</p>
<p>“Please, don't get us all killed,” Birtwistle pleaded.</p>
<p>Right then, a red streak of light hit the edge of the column they were hidden behind, raining bits of stone and wood over them. Humphreys and Plaskitt both let out a scream.</p>
<p>“Oy, kiddies! I don't have all day. You wouldn't want to see what I'm capable of when I'm angry,” the Snatcher called again.</p>
<p>“Okay. Let’s do this. Anyone have any questions?” Namjoon coughed out.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Seokjin didn't know what came over him, but he had to. “What do you get when you cross a snowman and a vampire?”</p>
<p>“Oh, sweet Merlin, Jin!”</p>
<p>The three younger years stared at him in utter confusion.</p>
<p>He looked them all in the eye for a moment, and then, completely serious, he answered his own question, “Frostbite.”</p>
<p>“I cannot believe you.” Namjoon sighed as Seokjin snickered quietly at his own joke.</p>
<p>At least they were momentarily distracted from their panic. Seokjin’s job here was done.</p>
<p>“We’re going to die, aren't we?” Birtwistle asked, sounding rather hopeless.</p>
<p>Ignoring the boy, Namjoon continued, “Alright, then, now that Seokjin’s got that out of his system. On, the count of three. One…”</p>
<p>Seokjin tugged the boys closer to him and reached for Humphreys’ hand.</p>
<p>“Two…”</p>
<p>He glanced at Namjoon and nodded. They can do this.</p>
<p>“Three! <em> Protego </em>!”</p>
<p>They ran forward; Seokjin had to push them for a second to get them going, but once they were moving he made sure to keep in front of them. It took the Snatcher a second to realize what they were doing, but once he did, a volley of spells came barreling straight at them.</p>
<p>It was unnerving, given the invisible nature of the shielding spell, to be seemingly running directly at oncoming spells. This was the main reason for the split.</p>
<p>While they were both relatively proficient at the <em> protego </em> charm, neither had enough practical experience, particularly under these circumstances, to guarantee the focus required to maintain it. Holding the spell while moving was basically enough of a challenge without someone tossing a crapload of offensive spells at the shield.</p>
<p>They slammed into the statue, and Namjoon immediately dropped the spell.</p>
<p>“<em> Protego </em>!” Seokjin shouted, this time holding the spell in line with their location to prevent the Snatcher from coming forward.</p>
<p>Namjoon made a beeline for the suit of armor across from them, and even as he reached it, Seokjin maintained the spell, well aware that the wizard on the other side had long given up his cover and was viciously attacking the shield both magically and physically.</p>
<p>Both Namjoon and Seokjin were aware that each spell the man was throwing at the shield which ricocheted off was not helping the stability of the hallway around them. It couldn't be helped, since the Snatcher seemed completely unaware of the danger his actions were causing. It was best to make this quick.</p>
<p>From the corner of eye, Seokjin could see Namjoon taking aim. The Snatcher was too consumed with bringing down the shield to notice. By an unspoken agreement, the moment the tip of Namjoon’s wand began to glow, Seokjin dropped the <em> protego </em> , taking the man by surprise. The Snatcher stumbled forward from the barrier’s sudden disappearance, which proved to be his undoing. Before he could recover, Namjoon’s <em> expelliarmus </em> sent both man and wand flying.</p>
<p>He slammed into the side of the statue, taking Morgana the Mad’s arm with him as he fell. Seokjin felt his heart tighten when the crumbling stone and lack of wand barely slowed the man down. With a wild scream of rage, the man sprung forward from where he fell and charged at Namjoon, who was frozen in shock by the man’s recovery.</p>
<p>The thing was, the Snatcher had all but forgotten about the group of students behind him. And Seokjin had forgotten all spells except the one that he swore to never personally use.</p>
<p>The man’s back was to him and his proximity made the shot all the easier. Seokjin has never been successful with the spell before, but he felt a cold surety this was it.</p>
<p>He took aim and spoke the word, “<em> Sectumsemspra. </em>”</p>
<p>The spell was meant to cut victims from a distance, and deeply. However, the wizard was almost directly in front of Seokjin when the spell was cast.</p>
<p>The way the man’s head tumbling from his shoulders, while his body continued to stumble forward a step or two before collapsing, was a truly nightmarish surprise.</p>
<p>It was a few seconds of pure shocked horror, as Seokjin remained wide-eyed and frozen, wand outstretched, while Namjoon and the students continued to stare at the corpse and the quickly spreading puddle of blood. Then, the castle gave a dangerous lurch.</p>
<p>Mostly operating on autopilot, Seokjin bodily shoved the younger students back toward the wall, away from the falling debris. He noted Namjoon taking cover as well, and they all waited out the tremors, hoping that all the struggles earlier wouldn’t be in vain. When the shaking finally stopped, they allowed themselves a few seconds to breathe.</p>
<p>Seokjin didn't realize he was trembling until Namjoon came crashing into him and the taller boy’s arms came up and wrapped tightly around him. In fact, he didn't realize how shaken he was, until he fully registered that Namjoon was stroking the back of his head with one hand and holding onto him tightly with the other, all the while babbling comforting nonsense into his ear, “It’s okay, Jinnie. Just breathe, that's right, you're doing good. You did good, hyung. You saved me. Just keep breathing, and listen to me. Okay?”</p>
<p>Oh, so that's what a panic attack felt like.</p>
<p>He tried to match his breathing to Namjoon's and just let his voice wash over him.</p>
<p>“It’s okay, it's okay,” he kept repeating into Seokjin’s hair.</p>
<p>He wanted to stay like this for a while longer, but the crumbling around them had increased, and Seokjin felt bad enough about taking as much time as he did already, the shock notwithstanding. They had to keep moving.</p>
<p>It was with great reluctance that he pushed away from Namjoon and said, “I'm okay. Let's get going.”</p>
<p>The skeptical but worried look Namjoon gave him was completely warranted, considering how much his voice shook when he spoke. But he just nodded and motioned for the younger students to follow him. Poor Humphreys was beyond tears and stumbling so badly, Seokjin made sure Namjoon had a firm hold on her before helping the two boys navigate through the debris.</p>
<p>As they moved forward, the castle was thankfully still. Even the injured Snatcher, Seokjin was sure the other man had called him Abney, was quiet for the first time in the whole encounter. He ended up taking up the rear, since Namjoon was leading their group, and he wanted to supervise the younger boys.</p>
<p>Maybe it was wanting a sense of closure, but Seokjin felt the urge to take a last look at what he had done. The Hufflepuff glanced back and while the sight of the headless corpse was hard to miss, what caught his attention was Abney struggling across the floor, his single arm outstretched and reaching toward something. He stopped, confused. It took a moment of straining to see, when it hit him.</p>
<p>The other Snatcher’s wand was just barely out of Abney’s reach.</p>
<p>His eyes widened, and before he could do anything, the man’s hand wrapped around the base of the wand.</p>
<p>Seokjin whirled around, “Namjoon, run!”</p>
<p>All of them turned, and it was easy to see when they saw the reason for his call. They immediately began to run.</p>
<p>Being the closest, Seokjin made an effort to throw up some kind of barrier, but the combination of shock and fatigue meant his concentration was shot. Every spell that made contact meant the immediate collapse of the shield. Thankfully, the injured man was relying on his non-dominant hand and only a few spells actually ended up going where he was aiming. The downside to this was that he was wreaking havoc on their surroundings.</p>
<p>“Seokjin!”</p>
<p>Namjoon’s voice rose over the rumble and he turned slightly to see they were some distance away. However, they were all staring in horror at the ceiling, where a large fissure was growing above them. It wasn't even a matter of choice on his part when he dropped the shield and immediately casted an <em> exumai </em> on the group, blasting them back just as the entirety of the ceiling came crumbling down.</p>
<p>That was unfortunately where his luck ended that day. Before he could recast the shield, a dark orange streak struck him in the stomach, sending him crashing into the fallen stones.</p>
<p>Without taking a breath or even trying to get up from his position, Seokjin threw a <em> confringo </em>at the stone column beside the man.</p>
<p>The smirk on Abney’s face fell almost as fast as the broken pieces of the column. His terrified scream was cut short when a large piece of stone dropped on his head with a sickening squish.</p>
<p>Seokjin let his wand arm fall and sat back against the stones, panting, for a moment.</p>
<p>But a sudden twinge from his stomach sent him scrambling to rip off his cloak and untuck his shirt.</p>
<p>He couldn't help the sudden sense of terror that rose.</p>
<p>Seokjin continued to stare in shocked amazement at his own abdomen and the slowly spreading darkness on his flesh. It was as if seeing the wound cemented its reality, and all at once the pain hit him.  A pained sob escaped before he could stop himself. His hands immediately flew up to grip his own mouth in an effort to stifle any more unwanted sounds from escaping.</p>
<p>“Jinnie!” Namjoon’s muffled voice came from the other side of the rubble. “Jinnie-ah, are you okay? What is it? What's wrong? Are you crying?”</p>
<p>Denial. He was ready with it. He could do it. Namjoon had the kids, he could do it for them.</p>
<p>But then he realized his face was already soaked and tears were already flowing freely over his hands, cupping his mouth. And he just couldn't stop it. And had no real desire to stop any time soon.</p>
<p>Fuck it, he’ll just go a different route with this.</p>
<p>“Of course I'm fucking crying, Namjoon! It's been a fucking shitty fucking day! People were just trying to kill us, people are still trying to kill us. The kids are bloody crying, and I just killed the fucking people that were fucking trying to kill us! That was a bloody fucking stupid question, Namjoon-ah!” His voice had progressively gotten higher throughout that little tirade and fueled by the sudden anger he flailed along with his tantrum.</p>
<p>He was shocked silent when, of all things, he heard the familiar squawk of Namjoon’s laugh.</p>
<p>“Namjoon Kim. Are you seriously laughing right now?”</p>
<p>Okay. Seokjin had to give it to Namjoon, there was a pretty hysterical quality to his laughter, but really?</p>
<p>“I’m just glad you're alright, Jinnie.” Namjoon said once he caught his breath. “I've never been so glad to hear your bitching.”</p>
<p>Oops. And there goes his heart, diving down to the depths of his stomach, probably where the curse was wreaking havoc on his body. Ouch, fuck. Stupid thought, he didn't need that reminder — stop thinking, Seokjin.</p>
<p>“Fuck you, Namjoon. Don't even talk to me, anymore. Are the kids alright?”</p>
<p>“Do you want me not to talk or answer that, ’cause talking is necessary to answer, you know.”</p>
<p>“Namjoon-ah,” Seokjin whined, “stop it. How is everyone? Are you okay?”</p>
<p>Seokjin heard a thump and a chuckle and he could almost imagine Namjoon pressing his forehead against the rubble behind him.</p>
<p>“Yeah, we’re all okay. Plaskitt got a little banged up but nothing serious. You sit still for a second, okay? I think I can get through.”</p>
<p>“No! Don't!”</p>
<p>There was silence. Seokjin took the moment to calm his thundering heart. On one hand, he would give anything just to see Namjoon; on the other, he realized that if Namjoon were to see him then, it would take more than a Dark Lord to get him to leave his side and there was little enough time as it was to get everyone to the Hog’s Head Inn. And while there wasn't much he wouldn't give for Namjoon right now, the one thing he could never risk was Namjoon’s safety and that of the children.</p>
<p>“Namjoon, listen. If you don't want to bring the roof down on all of us, then don't touch anything. I'm pretty sure this pile of rubble is all that’s keeping it up as it is.”</p>
<p>“What are you saying? I don't like where you're going with this because I'm not leaving you here if that's what you're getting at.”</p>
<p>Damn it, Namjoon, stop making it more difficult than it has to be! Seokjin had been able to hold back his sobs up until now, but having his stupid, loyal, idiot boyfriend remind him exactly why he loved him was just too much. Taking a moment, he bit down on his hand to keep his sobs silent, before breathing in deeply and continuing to speak. By some miracle, his voice was steady, and he even managed to insert a bit of levity.</p>
<p>“You're not leaving me, dummy.” He forced a laugh to cover a hiccup. “It's only collapsed on this side. I can make my way around. I'll come up after you.”</p>
<p>“But that's twice as far! What if you run into more Snatchers or Death Eaters, Jin! What then? It's better if we stick together.”</p>
<p>“And how do you propose we do that, huh? I know you think I'm beautiful, but even I don't think I can pull off the pancake look if you pull down the roof on us.”</p>
<p>With perfect timing, an explosion from the battle below sent a violent lurch through their surroundings.</p>
<p>Seokjin closed his eyes and ducked his head as the shaking sent a cascade of dust down on him. He tried blinking away the dust once everything settled, but it stubbornly clung to the wetness of his face.</p>
<p>Wincing in discomfort from the mess and the pain from the spreading decay of the curse, he tried again, “Joonie, if you have a better idea I'll be glad to hear it, but if we sit around any longer, this place is coming down with or without your help. Just take the kids and go. I'll meet you at the evacuation point, okay?”</p>
<p>There was silence again, and Seokjin didn't breathe as he waited.</p>
<p>“Fuck this! Fuck this entire bloody war!”</p>
<p>“Joonie—”</p>
<p>“I don't like it, Jin.”</p>
<p>“I know. You've made that point very clear.”</p>
<p>“I don't like the thought of leaving you to go alone.”</p>
<p>Seokjin couldn't help but smile. He loved his idiot, he really, really did.</p>
<p>“You're not leaving me, Joonie. I'm telling you to go.” He swallowed another sob before continuing, “I'll see you soon. Don't worry.”</p>
<p>“Jin…”</p>
<p>“Come on. How old are you? I'll be right behind you.”</p>
<p>How Namjoon made silence sound stubborn, Seokjin didn't know.</p>
<p>“Please, Joonie. You've got the kids. You have to get them out. It’s not just the two of us.”</p>
<p>The following series of expletives from Namjoon’s mouth was admittedly impressive, and Seokjin was pretty sure the younger students were leaving with a infinitely more colorful vocabulary.</p>
<p>“You done there?” Seokjin asked when there was an ebb in the flow of words.</p>
<p>“I hate this, I hate this, I hate this!”</p>
<p>“I guess not.”</p>
<p>“Seokjin-ah! You better get your arse there fast or I'll… I'll…”</p>
<p>“I see. It's only my arse you want,” Seokjin said, eyes watering in relief.</p>
<p>“I'm serious, Seokjin.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, yeah,” he breathed. “You take care of yourself, okay? Don't do anything stupid.”</p>
<p>“You too. I'll see you in a bit, alright?”</p>
<p>Seokjin really had to struggle to swallow the lump in his throat, “Yeah. I'll see you.”</p>
<p>There was a strange rustling noise and tapping.</p>
<p>“What are you doing, Namjoon?” He had to ask.</p>
<p>“I'm sending you the flying kiss. Tapping to let you know it's coming.”</p>
<p>“You are so stupid.”</p>
<p>“Nope. Still a genius. Got the papers to prove it.”</p>
<p>Why did it have to be like this? Seokjin hurt. The curse was spreading, and with every passing second he could feel it working its way to his heart, burning and withering the flesh as it inched upwards. And yet, the worst pain was the realization that this was it for him.</p>
<p>No more meaningless squabbles, no more gentle, or not so gentle, reminders to bloody eat when Namjoon gets caught in a new project, no more seeing those damned dimples that made him fall in the first place. They were young, who knew what anyone really wanted. But Seokjin was pretty sure he was ready for all of that, for the rest of his life.</p>
<p>Just maybe not so literally.</p>
<p>“Shut up already and go. You're still stupid.”</p>
<p>“I don't know about that, but Birtwistle says we're disgusting.”</p>
<p>“Your face is disgusting.”</p>
<p>“Real mature, Jin… Hey.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Can I get one, too? For good luck?”</p>
<p>“Get what?”</p>
<p>“One of your flying kisses. You do it better.”</p>
<p>Oh, Joonie…</p>
<p>It hurt to move. Merlin, did it hurt, but Seokjin twisted himself until he was all but curled against the rubble. He pressed his hand to his lips then tapped the stones, wishing more than anything that he could touch Namjoon’s face instead.</p>
<p>He didn't dare breathe to keep his sobs silent and gripped the stones until his fingers bled.</p>
<p>It was fine, though. Because Namjoon would be fine. It was fine.</p>
<p>“Thanks, Jinnie! I'll see you soon. Be safe, okay?”</p>
<p>Seokjin’s entire body shook with the effort it took to keep his voice steady, “See you soon.”</p>
<p>He could hear the shuffling as Namjoon stepped away and called the younger students to him. He continued to hold his breath until the sound of running faded into silence, and just a little longer to be sure.</p>
<p>Funnily enough, it took him a few seconds after to realize that the low, keening whimpers he started to hear were his own. Slowly, he forced himself to let go of the stones and huddle down.</p>
<p>He wanted to scream, to give voice to the rage bubbling inside at the unfairness of it all. He was planning on it actually. But the moment the sounds of footsteps faded, Seokjin felt as if a bit of reality faded along with it. Everything was slightly muted, and he just felt cold. It was probably shock. Then again, the world always felt a little cold without Namjoon.</p>
<p>Stupid Namjoon.</p>
<p>As he huddled there beside the rocks, he tried to ignore the spreading, burning ache. The icy numbness left behind in the wake of the burn was so much worse.</p>
<p>He didn't know what to do. There wasn't really anything he could do.</p>
<p>And as he huddled there, sobbing quietly, he couldn't help but smile wryly at the familiarity of it all.</p>
<p>Wasn't this how everything started for them?</p>
<p>His mind couldn't help but drift to another moment when he found himself in a very similar position, just maybe in less dire circumstances…</p>
