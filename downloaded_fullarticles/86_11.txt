    <p>"Get in there, you slut!" The menacing Chinese man ordered before throwing a woman covered in dirt, badly bruised and blood dripping from her nose and coming out from her mouth into a cell. Checking that there was nobody around or near, a man who was already locked in the cell moved towards the woman to inspect her wounds.</p>
<p>"Fucking morons, wait until I get out of here." The wounded woman spit some blood and leaned against the wall with difficulty. Seeing someone approaching her, she tensed though that only made her wounds worse going by the wince on her face.</p>
<p>The man, noticing, chided her. "Don't move! You might think they are some simple wounds but the Triads are very fond of using all sorts of poisons to make a person suffer more." He forced the woman to remain where she was while he checked out her wounds. They were not deep and most likely they were a warning. What she had to worry about was what would come next. "They are fine, just don't move too much." He concluded wrapping the cuts with some makeshift bandages torn from his clothes.</p>
<p>"Thanks." She softly said.</p>
<p>Done with his job, he returned to the corner he was in. While checking at her wounds, he saw that  under that garish robe, she wore clothes very much like a uniform and that told him that she most likely was someone from the law. Considering her English and the accent, he could tell she was British. Now, what was a British policewoman doing in the deepest part of Hong Kong and in Triad territory? It wouldn't be the first time that the Chinese government joined hands with other countries to fight the criminal organization and it wouldn't be the first time that those deployed elements lost their lives in the cells of the Triads.</p>
<p>But he didn't ask and neither tried to do small talk. He decided to ignore her though it became impossible when she jumped to her feet and walked around the cell inspecting the walls and door. Then she squatted in the middle of the cell and started to use her blood to make some weird squiggles. After she was done, she muttered something in what he recognized as Latin.</p>
<p>"You, what are you doing?" Her weird actions caught his attention and by consequence his interest.</p>
<p>"Providing a location." She plainly explained.</p>
<p>"Providing a location?" He echoed with disbelief.</p>
<p>"Yes, for back-up." Her eyes moved to the door and seeing that there was no movement, she leaned again against the wall.</p>
<p>"Back-up... Do you even know where you are? Not even the local Chinese police department can find this place much less a foreigner like you. Many cannot even enter this place." His interest dwindled and a gentle smile perched on his face. </p>
<p>The woman's grin looked terrifying with all the blood. "I got in, didn't I?"</p>
<p>The man startled and thought that she was right. However, she was mad by using this method just to get into a Triad compound; if the back-up doesn't come on time, then she would be tortured to death. The risk she took just to accomplish a minor goal was madness and it wasn't in his nature to associate with this kind of people so he kept silent. But again that wasn't going to be when she started a new conversation.</p>
<p>"Why are you here?"</p>
<p>"Extortion." He simply replied.</p>
<p>She scoffed. "As if I would believe that."</p>
<p>The smile on didn't leave his face and calmly looking at her, he asked. "Then, why are you here?"</p>
<p>"Trafficking."</p>
<p>"Human trafficking, drugs trafficking or arms trafficking?"</p>
<p>"All the above plus parts trafficking."</p>
<p>Huh, that was new for the Triads. Though if they could commit fraud using the Health Care System then selling and buying parts is not so farfetched. Well, it seemed our dear member of the law side was very honest. Didn't she stop to consider that maybe he was part of the Triads to get information out of her? Or that he, too, would be a criminal in the same caliber as the ones who put her in that cell? Very courageous woman but perhaps not the brightest out there.</p>
<p>His thoughts halted when he felt a tremor.</p>
<p>"Alright, it seems back-up has arrived." She cheered jumping to her feet. "Are you staying here or are you coming?" She asked turning to look at him.</p>
<p>"Uh, I..." But he didn't know what to say.</p>
<p>"Well, it's not like you couldn't have left already." She said with another bloodied grin making him stiffen.</p>
<p>"How did you know?"</p>
<p>"Pfft," she laughed unrestrainedly. "The man who threw me in this cell was afraid of you, though he looked more surprised seeing you here; that means either you weren't supposed to be here or you weren't supposed to be anymore. Next, your clothes are clean, that tells me that nobody laid a hand upon you so they very likely don't dare to do it because they need something from you or the consequences of doing it are very severe. I lean towards the second option since you don't look nervous, anxious or afraid being locked up here; you even took your sweet time tending to my wounds. You are used to being locked up in cells. That's a weird hobby if you don't mind me saying it. And finally, there is something about you that screams danger. Conclusion, you were here by your own volition, nobody was forcing you."</p>
<p>The man stood stunned for a couple of seconds before calming down. Well, he retracted his words, she was very clever after all. Another tremor shook the place.</p>
<p>"Well, time to go. It was nice meeting you!" She bid her farewell before literally blowing up the door together with the wall using a stick she took out from nowhere and running out to join with her backup.</p>
<p>The man took a while to steady himself due to what he had just witnessed and it took a while for the tremors to subside. Only then he also made his way out. Arriving at the entrance, there was a multitude of people, from police officers to members of the Triads to those people the Triads held captive. He looked around and finally found the person he was looking for. That woman was seriously talking pointing here and there to a Chinese middle-aged man that looked like a detective from the Hong Kong Police Division and a tall red-haired man.</p>
<p>After she was done talking with both men, she consciously sought medical assistance in a secluded place where a jittery young woman took care of her. He decided to approach her.</p>
<p>"... seriously, Head Auror Potter, please refrain from doing such dangerous activities, there is only so much I can do for you."</p>
<p>"That's why I chose you as my personal Healer, Susan. You are the best."</p>
<p>Head Auror Potter? Just what kind of title was that? The man stopped a few meters from both women and the one called Head Auror Potter quickly noticed him.</p>
<p>"Oh, it's you. Decided to come out and breath some fresh air?" She teased, her grin no longer bloodied.</p>
<p>"I didn't get the name of my savior." That unrestrained laugh of hers came out again.</p>
<p>"Henrietta Potter."</p>
<p>"Nice meeting you, Henrietta, my name is Fon."</p>
