"Now is the perfect time, Dora."</p><p>Nymphadora smiled. "I love you, Kings. More than I've ever loved any man before." She noticed Kingsley's raised eyebrow and assured him. "Yes, even Remus."</p><p>Kingsley beamed, "That's sweet. I love you too."</p><p>Nymphadora smirked. "More than any other woman?"</p><p>Kingsley nodded and stated, "You're important to me, Dora. I have loved you since the day we met, even when you never reciprocated those feelings. Now that we've been married six years and you're pregnant with our first child, I'm the happiest any man could ever be."</p><p>Nymphadora told him, "Teddy is more your child than Remus's, King."</p><p>Kingsley responded, "I suppose so, just not by blood."</p><p>Nymphadora reassured him, "Teddy thinks of you as more of a father figure than his own dad and that's the truth."</p><p>Kingsley smiled. "Teddy will make a good big brother."</p><p>Nymphadora concurred, "He sure will."</p></div>
