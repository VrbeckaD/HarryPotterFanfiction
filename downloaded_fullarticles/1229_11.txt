    <p>They didn't have any new arrivals in months. Right now, it was only James, Lily, the Peverell brothers, the Gaunt family and Death himself.</p>
<p>Of course, this had its problems.</p>
<p>"Filthy Mudblood!" Morfin roared</p>
<p>His father and sister were both trying to hold him back, to no avail. He wrestled himself free and he pointed his wand at Lily. She stared at him cooly. Then she shook her head.</p>
<p>"Men." she muttered under her breath "Come on, Merope, lest we get infected by their insanity."</p>
<p>Merope followed after her quietly, casting fearful looks at her father and brother. She sought to escape their noxious influence, to no avail. They followed her even in death. Lily, who knew the woes of dysfunctional family thanks to Snape, understood her plight and sympathized with her. Even if she brought their enemy into the world. </p>
<p>"Want to talk about it?" Lily asked her gently</p>
<p>"You're the first one who cares.....who actually cares." Merope choked out "And I only met you long after I died, so no one really cared about me while I was alive."</p>
<p>Lily ran her hands down Merope's back, and the other woman relaxed.</p>
<p>"My father and brother treated me like a slave." Merope continued, bolstered by Lily's kindness "To them, it was all I was good for. My father planned for me to marry Morfin someday, to continue my family legacy.....to keep our family pure...."</p>
<p>"Your father was going to force you to partake in an incestuous relationship?" Lily asked, horrified</p>
<p>"That was his plan, yes." Merope confirmed "Fortunately, I left before he could make it happen."</p>
<p>"That's wrong." Lily shook her head "That's barbaric."</p>
<p>"I know." Merope said softly </p>
<p>"We'll take care of you." Lily promised "We'll be a family you've never had."</p>
<p>"Why are you so nice to me anyway?" Merope raised her head "It was my son who killed you and your husband."</p>
<p>"It's because you remind me of an old friend of mine whose family situation was similar to yours." Lily admitted</p>
<p>And Snape's face appeared in her mind, however briefly.</p>
<p>"Will you introduce me to this old friend of yours when he or she comes here?" Merope asked "I'd love to meet him or her."</p>
<p>"I will." Lily promised "Hopefully, not for a long time, but I will."</p>
