    <p dir="ltr">01. Choices Made</p>
<p dir="ltr"> </p>
<p dir="ltr">Albus Dumbledore was rarely wrong. That was just the fact of life. You could never find someone more right than Albus Dumbledore, and, as he got older, this remained to be true. Sure, he was cocky. More cocky than he’d been as a teenager, but at least now he could back it up and everyone knew it. That’s why the minister trusted him. That’s why his Order of the Phoenix followed him, and that’s why the Dark Lord Voldemort feared him.</p>
<p dir="ltr">So when the great Albus Dumbledore sent the Longbottoms and the Potters into hiding, of course Voldemort fully believed in the prophecy of which his spies had spoken. And when they said he would mark someone as his equal, he fully believed that meant he would get to choose his downfall. Both families had faced him thrice and gotten away, but there was something about James and Lily Potter. The Longbottoms were kind in their defiance. He couldn’t explain it. He almost respected them more. They had a quiet power about them, and if he ever truly wanted to recruit them, they would never come with him if he’d killed their son.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It was convenient then that Pettigrew had been made the Potters’ secret keeper. The Potters were loud, braggy. They bantered on the battlefield. They had no focus. Yet they had defied him viciously each time. Pawns of Dumbledore. Powerful they were, but so bloody obnoxious. It would be an incredible joy to kill even one of their children, so...</p>
<p dir="ltr">He’d kill them both.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Pettigrew spilled the secret immediately. Like he didn’t even wait a week. Seriously, they made him secret keeper, and that kiss ass sent him a patronus with the information not even twenty minutes after they left.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Voldemort rolled his eyes just thinking about it as he walked easily through the gate. Pettigrew had suggested Black throw a Halloween party to get the Potter parents out of the house, so Doria Potter was babysitting.</p>
<p dir="ltr">He opened the door easily. It wasn’t even locked locked. Seriously, did these people even care about their children? He was the Dark Lord, and even he locked the doors whenever Lucius brought his brat over.<br/>He heard Doria singing softly as he made his way up the stairs. She was sitting in a rocking chair half asleep as the boys lay in their cribs. He quirked an eyebrow and fired a quick killing curse at her just as she noticed him. Then he stared between the cribs.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The redheaded baby in the crib labeled Ryan had started crying immediately. The other baby, Harry, was staring him down, killing curse green eyes fierce and focused. He sent a silencing charm at Ryan.</p>
<p dir="ltr">He cast a spell to analyze Harry’s magical core. Bottlenecked. His core was bottlenecked meaning his magic would come from a large pool at the bottom while the top would remain with him. His control would be amazing. Frightening even.</p>
<p dir="ltr">He cast the same spell on Ryan just to be sure. Twins rarely had the same core, and Harry would absolutely be more of a threat, making his decision on who would be the first to die easier. </p>
<p dir="ltr">Ryan’s core was shaped like a tube, meaning his magic would run out if he magically exhausted himself. It would come back, but he’d likely have to be hospitalized until it did. He’d probably even pass out.</p>
<p dir="ltr">He turned back to Harry. The black haired boy continued staring him down. He didn’t even make a sound. Green eyes bore into red. <em>I dare you.</em> They seemed to say. He raised his wand. “I do regret having to do this. Clearly, you’re the one. Very clearly. The focus, the power. You’ll only get better as you get older. You could have been a formidable foe, Harry Potter, and for that, I’m sorry. Avada Kedavra.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Green light flew out of his wand in slow motion. Green eyes never stopped looking at red. Harry’s tiny hand came up, a gold light flowing out of it consuming the killing curse and slamming right into Voldemort’s face. The man screamed, his magic reveled against its masters death, flying out to defend him from the onslaught of pure magic of a one year old. Harry was sent back as the twisted dark magic flooded his senses. His own golden magic forced it out, carving a lightning bolt on his forehead as it flooded out.</p>
<p dir="ltr"> </p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>They were dancing when they felt the wards collapse. Just one night. One night to ignore all the danger. That’s all they wanted. Sirius felt the godfather bond tug harshly almost sending him to his knees. Harry. Not Harry.</p>
<p>He looked for Peter, but he was already gone. Remus, feeling the small tug on his own godfather bond, growled at him and tackled him to the ground before he could even try to find Peter. Sirius enacted the family wards sending away everyone but James, Lily, and Dumbledore as he hit the ground and fell unconscious.</p>
<p>James pulled Remus off of Sirius. “Peter was the secret keeper!”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Dumbledore looked at them in shock. “Then Peter has betrayed us. Come. We must go.” He put his hands on James’s and Lily’s shoulders. “Remus, take Sirius to St. Mungos. Let them know he is not the secret keeper.”</p>
<p>Then he apparated them away. They arrived in the hallway outside the nursery, wands out. There were small fires throughout the room. A beam had fallen in front of Harry’s crib, but he was asleep. Ryan was crying loudly. A small cut in the shape of a heart could be seen on his collar bone. The rocking chair had been blown to pieces. Doria Potter’s body had been thrown down in front of Ryan’s crib.</p>
<p>Dumbledore took in the scene as James ran to Ryan’s crib. He noticed Doria on the ground and the heart on the baby’s collar bone. He looked at Lily as she levitated the beam away from Harry’s bed and picked him up. The black haired boy was unharmed but for a lighting bolt cut on his forehead, but that could from the debris. After all, a beam had nearly fallen on him.</p>
<p>James had calmed Ryan and was staring at his mother’s body. “Albus?”</p>
<p>Dumbledore’s attention was on the yew wand on the ground, the scraps of a cloak, and ash. This was all that was left of Voldemort’s body, but he was sure... Years ago, there’d been whispers about... There was no way this was over. He looked up at James. “It appears Voldemort tried to kill the children, but one of them caused the spell to backfire.”</p>
<p>Lily kissed the cut on Harry’s forehead. He was still asleep, and it didn’t look like the cut was a big deal. “Which one?”</p>
<p>“Let me do some quick tests.”</p>
<p>He’d never been good at looking at magical cores, so he wouldn’t bother with that one. They were young. Their cores were still developing. However, he could determine whether their magic was more dark or light inclined. Surely, the child surrounded in light magic would be the one who survived what he assumed was a killing curse.</p>
<p>Harry was covered in dark magic. It was like it had been thrown at his face, and he was dripping in it. His magical incline, though, was surprisingly grey. Ryan, however, was covered the purest magic he’d ever seen, and his results showed that he was inclined to light magic.</p>
<p dir="rtl">
  <em>Albus Dumbledore was rarely wrong</em>
</p>
<p>He looked between the two boys. One sleeping, one whimpering.</p>
<p dir="rtl">Albus Dumbledore was rarely wrong</p>
<p>Harry or Ryan? Light or Gray?</p>
<p dir="rtl">
  <strong>Albus Dumbledore was rarely wrong</strong>
</p>
<p>He smiled at Ryan. “Ryan Potter... is the savior of the wizarding world. He shall be known as the Boy Who Lived.”</p>
<p>James and Lily shared a look of pride. Lily set Harry down in his barely standing crib so that she could cuddle her child with her husband, mourning the loss of her mother-in-law. Doria Potter who had stood strong in front of Voldemort to protect their child, the Savior of the Wizarding World.</p>
<p>Albus Dumbledore was rarely wrong, but rarely still means he can be. Of course, it would be years before he even realized how wrong he had been.</p>
