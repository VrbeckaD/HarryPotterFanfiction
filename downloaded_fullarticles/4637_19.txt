    <p>"English Oak," Mr. Ollivander said, offering the wand. "Unicorn Hair, ten and three-fourths inches - slightly springy...go on, give it a wave." the man urged.</p><p>Merlin Faulkner, although wary after the last wand had nearly set his mother on fire (Professor McGonagall, whom was accompanying them as an escort, saved his mother from injury with a hastily erected shield charm), obediently took the offered wand and, after a beat, gave it a wave. Silvery sparks flew out of it, almost looking as if shooting stars were emerging from the wand.</p><p>"Oh, yes, that's the one." the wizard declared to the professor's polite clapping - his mother belatedly following suite.</p><p>He started to smile, the glee of being an actual <em>wizard</em> with a real <em>wand</em> hitting him all at once, when loud, booming bells rang and the world went through a sudden rush of colors before bleaching to grayscale save for one thing. A single golden box floated before him, at eye level, with writing that reminded Merlin of the <em>verdana </em>text font that was itself copper in coloring.</p><p>

</p><p>Merlin glanced at his mother, who was frozen and colorless like an old black and white picture, before, with lack of any better idea, pressed the [Close] at the bottom of the golden box. The box disappeared, with a <em>fwip!</em> noise that vaguely reminded him of a message alert system, only for three more to take it's place.</p><p>Idly, he wondered if there was a way to change the coloring of the thing - the copper and gold theme <em>hurt</em> to look at.</p><p>

"That was <em>fantastic!</em> Absolutely beautiful - as if you created your very own meteor shower!

</p><p>Bemused and a bit dismayed over the question marks, Merlin sighed before pressing the [H?] button and reading the box only to open four more boxes when he pressed [Kindness], [Faithful], [Honesty] and [Hardwork].</p><p>"<em>Kindness</em>, the measure of how nice you are - this is a trait of H. This special stat allows a plus twenty percent bond xp gain, plus fifteen percent reputation xp gain, plus 10 percent loyalty xp gain, plus ten percent luck and plus five percent charisma." He read aloud, finding he could move the boxes if he just grabbed a corner and pulled. He moved the <em>Kindness</em> box so that it was above the next one. "<em>Faithful,</em> the measure of how reliable you are - this is a trait of H. This special stat allows fifteen percent loyalty xp gain, fifty percent boost to all stats on you if a person with a bond of ally or higher is in distress, fifty percent boost to all stats on a person with a bond of ally or higher when you are in distress and a plus two percent multiplied by teamwork level xp gain while in a party."</p><p>"Whoa. That one's really a team player." He blinked at the <em>Faithful</em> stat then continued after he moved that box so it was to the left of <em>Kindness</em>. "<em>Honesty</em>, the measure of how truthful you are - this is a trait of H. This special stat allows plus twenty percent bond xp gain, plus fifteen percent reputation xp gain, plus ten percent loyalty xp gain, plus five percent luck and plus five percent charisma but it is also minus twenty-five percent xp gain for the skill class Ninja."</p><p>Merlin stopped. Blinked, re-read the last bit then burst, "<em>THERE IS A NINJA SKILL CLASS?</em>"</p><p><em>Whelp. Goodbye honesty.</em> He thought as he went on to the next once <em>Honesty</em> was placed to the right of <em>Kindness</em>. "<em>Hardwork,</em> the measure of how diligent you are - this is a trait of H. This special stat allows plus fifty percent xp gain, plus five percent points, plus five percent ability points, plus one percent skill slots, plus fifteen percent health, plus fifteen percent magic and plus twenty-five percent stamina."</p><p>With dismay, Merlin realized he was going to have to read <em>all</em> of the special stats then grimly moved things so that he cloud click the [G?], [R?] and [S?] before following with each individual stat in a series of button pushing. Once the boxes stopped appearing, he tugged and arranged them until he could see <em>all</em> twenty of them - they made a wall of boxes before him.</p><p>He looked at the wall for a moment before sighing and starting to read them, "<em>Courage,</em> the measure of your valor - this is a trait of G. This special stat allows plus fifteen percent reputation xp gain, plus two percent charisma, plus twenty-five percent will, plus twenty-five percent vitality, plus five percent luck and plus twenty-five percent multiplied by charisma xp gain for motivation.</p><p><em>Bravery</em>, the measure of your daring - this is a trait of G.

"Horrible, that was <em>horrible</em>. Why did I decide to read them aloud, it was a terrible idea."</p><p>Rudely, neither his room nor the boxes gave an answer.</p><p>"Alright. So. I have twelve points to spend." He said, thinking aloud. "I've got no idea what a ninja skill class is but <em>I want it</em> so I'll dump Honesty. I don't care for Leadership or any of the G stats really so I can go without them. Or, wait, will I have an ability check for Courage?" No answer. "Right...I guess I can put a point there but uh..."</p><p><em>I can live with being a coward,</em> Merlin decided. "I definitely want Faithful, along with Cunning, Resourcefulness and Learning since I'm going to school soon. Mm, I should put a point to Creativity if only for the Survivalist skill class xp gain since I'll have the other three already. Then Wit, Intelligence, Kindness and Hardwork."</p><p>"Let's do three to Cunning, two to Resourcefulness, two to Learning, two to Faithful, one to Hardwork, one to Creativity, one-" he paused and mentally counted it and said, "-to Courage then." Nodding to himself he proceeded to demolish the wall of boxes before distributing his stat points as he had said.</p><p>
