    <p>“You’re a nice guy Newt. A really good guy but buddy, I’m not gay” </p>
<p>Jacob scrambled backward, wanting to put space between himself and Newt. His eyes are wide and he shakes his head violently when Newt tried to step towards him again “Jacob I-”the wizard doesn’t get a chance to reply before Jacob cuts him off. “ No! No, no no. I don’t want to hear it” he all but yells. “I’m sorry but I just- dammit Newt you can’t just kiss someone like that!” he sighs and runs a hand over his face.  Christ, he doesn’t have the energy to deal with this. No words even come to his mind to handle the situation that is quickly spiraling out of control. </p>
<p>“I don’t understand,” Newt says softly, and Jacobs finds that he can’t bring himself to face the wounded look on Newts face. “You’ve shown a clear interest in me, Jacob. In my creatures, my company. Even Pickett noticed!” Newt tries once more to step closer to his friend. “I thought perhaps-” he stops himself and shakes his head. Jacob can see the confusion on the wizard’s face, and to be fair he can’t really blame him. Jacob did enjoy the time he spent with Newt. The way his friend lit up with his creatures, the way he looked when he laughed or got the chance to show Jacob something simply marvelous. “Look, buddy,” Jacob says as calmly as he is able, though he’s aware of how defensive he sounds. “ You’re an amazing guy, but that’s the problem.” He looks up at Newt and shakes his head “ Don’t you dare look at me like that” he pleads and shifts a little. This entire conversation was making him horribly uncomfortable. “I do like you, Newt,” he says finally. There isn’t a point in denying it, not when they both know it’s true. “ But I shouldn’t. Neither should you. You should be pulling this stunt on Tina, not on me.” The moment of silence that passed between them seemed to stretch for an eternity. </p>
<p>“If I was a woman, you wouldn’t reject me?” Newt asks, his voice softer than Jacob had ever heard it. God, he knows that this is a horrible thing to say but it’s true isn’t it? “No, I probably wouldn’t,” he said softly. He hadn’t thought that Newts face could fall any further but it did, and it twisted something in Jacobs very core. Something he chose to ignore. “Look, buddy, I think you should go check on your animals. We- We need time apart to think.” He sighed and turned his back to Newt. It wasn’t until he heard the door to his bakery close that he finally let himself sink into a chair with his head in his hands. God, what had he just done? </p>
<p>It had been a few weeks since that day in his bakery, and Jacob hadn’t seen Newt at all. Not even the man’s case was in his apartment anymore. Though it was a relief when Tina had informed him Newt was with them, it also felt like someone stuck a knife in his stomach. He hadn’t felt his uneasy since his time in the army. Hell, at this point he’d take being stuck in a trench over this stupid fight. Why couldn’t Newt be happy with their friendship? Sure the man was a bit..quirky but even he had to know this was something that could get you arrested! At least in the non-magical world that is. </p>
<p>Jacob was pulled from his thoughts when he heard the bell on the bakery door ring. He looked up to be lock eyes with a fucking beautiful red-haired woman. Jacobs breath caught in his throat as he searched for something to say. “ Uh- W-welcome to my Bakery” he stuttered and bit his lip gently. “ Thank you” the woman practically purrs. There is something familiar about the accent she has. The soft English accent that rolls off her lips as she speaks to him. After a moment, the woman shifts and holds her hand out “ I’m Ne-Nacy” she says a touch too quickly. “Nancy.. Smith” she said after an awkward pause. It should have been suspicious really. It was like she didn’t even know her own name. The thought briefly passed through the man's head gently. Not that he pays much mind to it, not with the smoking hot beauty standing in front of him. “ It’s a pleasure to meet you” he hums and flashing the woman a flirtatious grin. Jacob could have fainted as the woman rewarded his efforts with a small blush and a tentative smile. God, she seemed familiar, but Jacob couldn’t put his finger on it. “ I’m sorry Ma’am but.. have we meet before?” he asked. He still struggled with parts of his memory after the events with Macusa.</p>
<p>The woman flashed him a small smile and nodded. “ I come here quite regularly” she smiled “ I’m a bit plain so I tend to blend into the background” she explained and hummed as she bit her lip shyly “ I was actually hoping you wouldn’t mind if we got dinner?” Her eyes were landing on everything but Jacob as he began to shift out of nervousness. </p>
<p>“I’d love to!” Jacob agreed before he could realize that the woman's behavior was entire to similar to Newts for his comfort. “ We can meet at Angelo’s, the Italian restaurant on the corner if you don’t mind? Say 7 o’clock tonight?” he hummed and almost squealed with joy when the woman agreed.  </p>
<p>It would be nice to get out, take his mind off of Newt. The man's crestfallen expression had been burned into Jacobs mind the past few weeks. He’d never wanted to hurt Newt like that. He hadn’t seen the man lose the light in his eyes. He hated it more than anything but this was for the better. Jacob pushed all thoughts of Newt aside and gets ready for his date. After all, it wasn’t every day that a woman asked him out and not vice versa. Yes, Jacob was looking forward to this.</p>
