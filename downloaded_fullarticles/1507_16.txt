          <div class="userstuff"><p>It’s Friday night. His match is in fifteen minutes but he’s stalling in the locker rooms, listening to his sister’s—sorry, <em>stepsister</em>, semantics are important— horrendously cheery voicemail for the third time:</p><p>
  <em>If you’re hearing this I’m probably in the lab where I don’t get reception— or in the bathroom … so just leave a message, and I’ll get right back to you when I can!</em>
</p><p>Fingers curl at his sides.</p><p>“It’s me. Hope you’re alright… I know you’re busy but I was hoping we could talk. Call me when you get this, ok? Miss you.”</p><p><em>Miss you</em>—it sounds ludicrous leaving his mouth. It should’ve been a joke. All it needs is a <em>sweetie</em> at the end for eye-rolling incredulity. He should’ve just said <em>answer your goddamn phone</em>. But it’s too late to take it back, so he hangs up and focuses on wrapping gauze around his quivering fingers. The air stinks of booze and a musky egg odor while the single fluorescent light overhead wavers, an opaque sun beating against his sleepless eyes. The sounds are just as cliché: buzzing gnats, a painstakingly slow faucet drip, copulating pants from the streaming porno on his miniature TV. He stands and raises his arms over his head to pull on the muscles of his abdomen. Pops a few punches in the air.</p><p>He’s out of pills. Ran out just this morning and there’s a <em>tick-tick-tick</em> beneath his skin, a frenetic energy—hunger’s not the right word for it, neither is lust. It’s an alive thing that bulges from his thoughts like an uncomfortable mass of flesh <strike>either tumor or erection he isn’t sure</strike> It makes words ram into the cage of his jaw, makes him feel ineloquent. Eloquence is a gentleman’s tranquilizer, Father used to say Pacification can be made criminally easy with pretty words—People are more likely to follow an eloquent man than a savage <strike>though every man must know how to be both.</strike></p><p>‘Tom Riddle’ is a believable character, designed with the customary tensions of a young man navigating the modern world. He enjoys football, video games, and some third conventional male thing. He is twenty-five years old. He has a girlfriend named Bella who is a decent lay. He is a semi-professional boxer neither poor nor good enough to be distinguished. Being excellent at something is risky. Father said that people preferred their idols—barring Jesus—flawed and undivine. Distinctly Human. Since conception Tom has strived to incorporate these words into his personality with little success. Books, movies, pornos: He has found there is no comfort in the media that he consumes voraciously, because there is no narrative which suits him, from which he can steal.</p><p>For most of his life, Tom has been religiously careful about his substance intake. During his brief stint at Yale, he went through a stream of reckless doctors who provided him with all sorts of unusual-sounding candies: Zyprexa, Seroquel, Risperdal, Fluoxetine. Ruined his sleep, killed his libido, made the days without their centers. Following his expulsion for reasons that are still unclear to him, and are far too clear to his sister, he was given more and more until he stopped taking them altogether. All except for one.</p><p align="center">-</p><p>He’s out of pills. Flash forward and eyes stare down at between the lines, avoiding the obscenities, the triggers. Big-tittied blondes with painted faces, holding gaudy posters plastered with his name. Flanked by guards, he is secured safely through the crowd, hoodie pulled over his face to prevent the lights blinking from all directions from dizzying him.</p><p>“What took so long?” Coach says. Tom climbs into the ring, slinking onto his stool. “Pre-match jitters? You don’t get those anymore.”</p><p>“Headache,” he lies.</p><p>A look crosses Coach’s face as he moves to kneel. He plants two hands on Tom’s knees, leaning in real close, about to drop a platitude, one of those <em>‘you’ve got nothing to be nervous about, kid’.</em> He pauses. “Check out your next paycheck.” Instead, he nods toward the bald, tattooed fighter climbing into the ring from the opposite side. “Now say <em>Thank you, Coach.</em>”</p><p>Mordred “Dread” Patti. Not the most skilled boxer but great for drawing a crowd. Unlike Tom who the network has branded a <em>fragile white boy,</em> Dread looks the part of a scummy fighter: fissured mouth, beady eyes, a face dusted over with a cragged beard. Outside this, he’s a set of limbs attached to a body made of flesh and steroids. He is Goliath. People cheer for him, bet on him. Bet against him. They yearn to see him fall.</p><p>“Thanks Coach.”</p><p>“You’re welcome. Now stop kissing my ass.” Coach shoves his shoulder in a way that Tom has learned through keen observation means camaraderie. “Watch for his uppercuts. He’s got a new plate installed in his knuckles. It’ll hurt like a bitch.”</p><p>Speaking of. “Seen Hermione around tonight?”</p><p>“Nah. Knew you’d ask though. Sent my boys looking for her earlier.”</p><p>“You—” Coach shoves the mouthpiece into his mouth before he can finish hissing. He spits it out, sputtering angrily, and watches Coach act too busy drawing heavy gloves onto his taped hands to pay his temper any attention. This isn’t the first time he’s treated Tom like a petulant child.</p><p>“Don’t sweat it—probably forgot you were fighting tonight. Sisters, you know?”</p><p>“Hermione doesn’t forget things.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Forget it.” Standing, yanking the towel off his neck, Tom hurls it at the stool in muted fury.</p><p>“Good talk.” Coach nods, eyes glazed. “Now get out there—” a shove “and keep it smart with that left jab, alright? It’ll set off all your other moves.”</p><p>Staggering forward two steps, Tom turns and sends one last glower. Coach flips a finger —another endearment— before ducking out of the ring and out of sight. Already.</p><p>Tom’s hands are twitching inside his gloves—It's a mistake for him to be here tonight. He knew this before he left his apartment. He is out of pills.</p><p>Dread swaggers over, so that they’re standing face to face: His eyes are bright, face wide in a manic grin. Tom cannot manage a single facial expression in retaliation. Dread is one of the stupid few who innately believes in this brawling performance, whereas Tom has always understood that they are playing roles. He is much smaller than Dread. His body, in its delicate, visually uninspiring form, serves as a spectacle—food and circus for the masses.</p><p align="center">_</p><p align="left"><br/>
Without his pills, the match feels like a psychedelic dream. His blood is pulsing. His head is throbbing. White flashes like strobe lights as imaginary wires shoot from the ends of the ring, rising to startling length all around him and Dread, curling together to trap them a cage-like construction. The ceiling dissolves, inky black bleeding into the steely portrait of grey. His muscles cramp with exhaustion but he doesn’t care. He feels so high even if his face is arranged to not give away any inkling of excitement— he cannot show that he enjoys this as much as he does.</p><p align="left">The match is over and Tom is still bouncing around like he needs to piss. He stares down at the beaten man, at the beads of sweat rolling off Mordred’s skin, bloodied face, the vague expression of – what, dread? – in the swollen eyes. There’s something poetic about instilling dread in Dread. It scratches an itch. The violent flash of a second passes and he is ruminating over what it’d be like to go the whole way. All it would take is one screwdriver punch into the chest, really, really hard, straight into Dread’s heart. He would be dead in five, ten seconds max. This is not the first time Tom has thought about killing someone.</p><p align="left">The voice of the announcer snaps him from this macabre fantasy. He finds Coach standing in the ring, lifting his arm in the air, making the crowd cheer harder. It’s white noise. It means nothing, much like everything else. He blinks and stares blankly, breathing hard, staring at himself in the golden reflective gleam of his trophy, his body glistening with sweat under the bright lights. He cannot remember what happened or feel happy that he won, all he can do is admonish that his sister didn’t come to see his match.</p><p align="left">It’s a pity, because he would’ve loved to rub his victory in her face.</p></div>
