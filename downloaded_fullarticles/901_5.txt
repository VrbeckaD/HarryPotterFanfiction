    <p>“Mother said not to talk to you.” Millicent looked up to see the old bats latest daughter staring at her from the trees. Millicent had told Flemmy that she had warded against the precious offspring entering her part of the wilds. Millicent had also lied. </p>
<p>“Well if mother said not to…” Millicent rolled her eyes. She’d long since given up trying to hide behind polite platitudes with the numerous daughters. If they sought out Millicent’s company it was because they had as much respect as Millicent did for their mother.</p>
<p>“What are you doing?” the small female was leaning forward, not getting close enough to be caught just yet.</p>
<p>“What does it look like I’m doing?” Millicent was intrigued to see if she got it right. Millicent was currently playing with the latest samples from the wardens. Remus was off playing tour guide with the latest reject from a different dimension, and Neville was in the greenhouse.</p>
<p>“It looks like you are eating rotten flesh, are you a ghoul?” </p>
<p>“And what is a ghoul?” Millicent was now marginally entertained, the chit had some sense to keep out of range.</p>
<p>“Mother said that you would catch me and eat me.” The girl was now hanging off a branch, swinging like a monkey.</p>
<p>“She wasn’t wrong.” Millicent might lie to Flemmy when she felt like it, but some things she was happy to be honest and open about. There was a reason after all why Flemmy had warned all the daughters not to stray into Millicent’s territory. </p>
<p>“Did you really eat the others?” Now that was a harder question to answer. Millicent hadn’t eaten all of them, and Flemmy was as much of a menace to the children as Millicent. The difference was that Millicent didn’t pretend otherwise.</p>
<p>“I still see a couple of them when I go off on my grand tours.” There, that was a noncommittal answer. </p>
<p>“What is a grand tour?” Millicent was starting to see why the old bat might not have such an issue with farming her own children. </p>
<p>“Where I go and remind certain people that I’m still here. I get given lots of gifts from all the people that suddenly remember they like me. Always best to just turn up, keeps them on their toes.” Millicent purred at that. Tevinter needed reminding every now and again, normally once a century as the regime tumbled ever forward.</p>
<p>“Mother says you are like an old god.” Millicent had to hand it to the girl, she wasn’t giving up.</p>
<p>“That’s nice.” </p>
<p>“You don’t look old.” Millicent didn’t feel old either, she felt the same as she always did. </p>
<p>“Are you bored?” It felt like the girl was bored, and Millicent was sort of busy. Only sort of because she hadn’t promised anything to the wardens, but she did enjoy a challenge. Remus got funny when she did her experimenting around the rejects, said they were too fragile. </p>
<p>“Are you an old god?” </p>
<p>“I can hear your mother calling for you.” The girl looked suspiciously at Millicent, it had been worth a try. </p>
<p>“I can’t hear her, she’s busy with some men.” Fucking old bat, they had a deal, Millicent would ward against the daughters stumbling into her territory and the old bat would send any interlopers to Millicent to play with. It was the only deal they had. </p>
<p>“You have to the count of ten to leave my sight.” Millicent used her best no-nonsense tone. The same one she used with Neville when he tried to talk about how good Potter was at stuff. It hadn’t worked, though the girl had fled when Millicent had stood up. Flemmy had at least instilled some sense into the child, maybe next time or the time after she’d be in range to be caught.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I heard you have something of mine…” Millicent greeted the old bag who was busy ensnaring the latest lot of metal clad men. </p>
<p>“These are my guests, they are not for you.” There was no love lost between the two women. Millicent had been in the wilds first, before even Flemmy’s parasite, and she was not about to be intimidated.</p>
<p>“They are mine and you know it, or are you breaking the terms of our deal?” They stared at each other as the three men wavered on the brink of coherence.</p>
<p>“How did you know?” Flemmeth blinked first, she always did. Millicent cheated, she had a glamour on to make it look like she didn’t need to blink. It proved very useful around the old bat who had eyes drier than sand.</p>
<p>“Heard it from a monkey.” Close enough to the truth.</p>
<p>“You keep those wardens out of my territory and I will give you the men.” Millicent bared her teeth at the parasite ridden bat.</p>
<p>“You are here only because I don’t want this bit of swamp. The wardens go where they want because they can. You stole from me, don’t make me steal from you.” There was a slight rustling behind Millicent, and the old bat shifted.</p>
<p>“You play with things you do not know.” Millicent had to hand it to the bat, she was persistent.</p>
<p>“Yes yes, I upset the natural order. Yet I’m not the one carrying around a relic of an age passed long ago am I… Now hand over the pretties, or I’ll take your latest.” Millicent crooked a finger at the rustling bush and the small child peered out.</p>
<p>“The Dread Wolf wakens, you’ll change your tune.” </p>
<p>“I already have a wolf thank you very much.” Fucking old bat, always with the dire warnings.</p>
