    <p>When Sirius Black was sixteen years old, he ran away from home. He’s almost twenty-six now, and he hasn’t stopped running since.</p><p>“Look,” Sirius says, letting his hand fall a little too hard on the café table. He’s agreed to meet Dumbledore here, and they’ve made awkward small talk over tea and scones for the better part of an hour, skirting around any topics of import. Sirius is getting antsy. “We’ve been at a stalemate for months, and the lady’s driving me barmy. I need a fucking edge on these guys.”</p><p>Dumbledore takes a quiet sip of his tea. “I’d suggest you keep a close watch on that temper, Mr. Black,” he says slowly. “One of these days it’s going to get you into trouble.”</p><p>Sirius watches as he rises from the table. “I think we’re due for a bit of trouble,” he says, kicking his own chair back and standing up, not ready to leave without some new intel, or a mission, or really any task at all to take his mind off the unrelenting helplessness he’s been drowning under.</p><p>Dumbledore smiles faintly. “Take care, Sirius,” he says, and reaches out to shake his hand.</p><p>Sirius takes it, and doesn’t flinch when the skin on his palm begins to sizzle.</p><p>Dumbledore drops his hand a second later, reaching up to pat him on the cheek in a way that makes Sirius cringe, and then he’s gone, melding into the crowds outside the café.</p><p>When Sirius opens up his stinging hand, he finds Dumbledore’s spindly handwriting etched in embers on his skin.</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <em>3618 Adler St</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>He’ll know what you’re looking for</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Sirius spares a moment to roll his eyes skyward and curse Dumbledore’s incessant need to speak in riddles. He quickly commits the information to memory and shakes his arm slightly, letting his wand drop from his sleeve to rest subtly against the point where his wrist meets his palm. He murmurs a quick word under his breath and the text on his skin goes up like flash paper, leaving a small pile of ash in its place. He tips his hand over, letting the ash disperse into the busy air of the café, and wipes it on his trousers. Looks like he has a task after all.</p><p>Adler Street is unusually busy for this time of day, and no one notices the man popping into existence behind a dumpster. Sirius brushes some dirt off his sleeve and steps out of the alley onto the sidewalk, weaving between single-minded Muggles with practiced ease. He stops at the door marked 3618, numbers painted in fading gold on the glass, crescent moon hanging from the window. Sirius shoulders his way inside and is nearly knocked down by the scent. The rich, warm aroma of chocolate is overwhelming, and Sirius takes a moment to bask. For all that he didn’t mind the wealth he’d lost in his disinheritance, there is something to be said for these small, worldly pleasures he can no longer afford. His eyes fall on the long glass case in front of him. Chocolates in every conceivable shape and flavor are laid out, beautiful truffles and carefully constructed cordials, delicate design work atop each one. They remind him of the chocolates his mother used to favor, the ones that sometimes, if he was very good, she would share with him. They used to melt on his tongue slowly, with precision, the way that only quality chocolate ever seemed to. Sirius glances at a price tag and winces.</p><p>“Can I help you?”</p><p>Looking up quickly from the display case, Sirius backs up a step when he sees the man in front of him. He is, Sirius supposes, rather plain. His features are nondescript, his hair a mousy brown, but there’s a patchwork map of scars across his face that seems peculiar for a mere chocolatier. “Is this all your work?” Sirius asks casually, gesturing to the display case.</p><p>There’s a plain black apron tied around the man’s waist, and he wipes his hands on it before extending one to Sirius. More scars wind their way around his fingers.</p><p>“Remus Lupin,” the man says, and his voice is rougher than Sirius might have expected. “Maker of fine chocolates and purveyor of this establishment.”</p><p>Sirius shakes his hand, firm and practiced. “William Lourde, one-time eater of fine chocolates.”</p><p>Remus’s eyebrows lift a fraction. “Lourde, you say? Are you some kind of nobleman, then?”</p><p>“Once, perhaps. These days I’m anything but,” Sirius admits, then adds with a grin, “That legacy now belongs to my baby brother, bless his black and shriveled heart.”</p><p>It is not quite a joke, and Remus does not laugh. Instead he cocks his head to the side, gaze studying and slightly unsettling.</p><p>“So,” he says, finally. “What can I do for you, Mr. Lourde?”</p><p>Sirius blinks. His charm is usually more effective. He glances back at the case, but he’s still not sure what he’s looking for. “A few chocolate orange ones, then,” Sirius said, casual. “If you’ve got ‘em.” He grins meaningfully up at Remus. “They came highly recommended.”</p><p>Remus does not so much smile, as twitch one side of his mouth up a fraction. “An interesting choice.” He taps one long finger against the counter. “Are you sure that’s what you want?”</p><p>Sirius wants a lot of things at this moment, and none of them are chocolate. “Positive.”</p><p>“Hm,” Remus says, as if considering. “Just a moment.” He disappears into the back, leaving Sirius alone, once again, with the truffles.</p><p>Sighing, Sirius shifts to lean against the display case. He lets his eyes wander, taking in worn wallpaper and battered tables, the handwritten menu board hanging next to the kitchen door. It seems to be your basic rundown, cocoa percentages and flavor options, laid out in neat, chalked lines. Sirius wonders whose handwriting it is. He also imagines what else those scarred fingers may have done. He’s pulled out of his own thoughts when the words on the board, clear a moment ago, go suddenly blurry under observation. Sirius scrubs at his eyes, but the letters get no clearer. Frowning, he lets his wand slip from his sleeve. He flicks it once towards the board, and watches as the letters rearrange themselves to form an entirely different menu.</p><p> </p><p>

</p><p>Sirius blinks at the menu board, at the sure, graceful handwriting, and thinks, <em>oh. </em></p><p>Remus comes back out from the kitchen, small box in hand, and Sirius stands up straight. Remus sets the box down on the counter in front of Sirius, who takes the lid off, curious. He is fairly certain it is not what he’d ordered.</p><p>“This isn’t what I asked for,” Sirius says.</p><p>“No,” Remus agrees. “But you’ll like it better. Trust me.”</p><p>“I don’t trust you,” Sirius says easily, putting the lid back on the box and giving it a little shove back towards Remus. “And I know what I want.”</p><p>Remus’s mouth does that little quirk again, and Sirius resists the urge to return it. “Do you?” Remus asks.</p><p>Before he can reply, Remus has pushed the box into Sirius’s hands, skin rough and warm against his own. “Just try it,” he insists.</p><p>Sirius swallows. The image of those hands tracing careful letters onto the board, chalk dust on his fingers, flashes unbidden into his mind, and he quickly squashes it. “This is not very good customer service, you know.”</p><p>Another quirk. “Will you be paying with pounds or sickles today?”</p><p>Sirius arches an eyebrow. “You expect me to pay for something I didn’t order?”</p><p>“And to think I was offering you the friends and family discount.” Remus sighs, punches the price into the till, and holds out a hand. “If you’re not entirely satisfied with your purchase, you are free to return and demand a refund. Does that sound reasonable, Mr. Lourde?”</p><p>It is, in every way, unreasonable to expect someone to pay for a product they did not ask for. And yet, Sirius finds himself reaching into a linty trouser pocket and fishing out the coins. He makes sure to place them in Remus’s palm without touching. The register opens with a small ding, and Remus drops the money inside, drawer clacking shut afterwards.</p><p>“Enjoy,” Remus says, and with a small wave he’s gone, back into the kitchen, leaving Sirius standing with a small box and considerably more questions than he’d had when he entered. Eyeing the magical menu board one last time, Sirius grabs the box and pushes his way back out onto Adler street, sunlight blinding him momentarily as his pupils adjust. After he’s safely apparated back to his apartment and taken off the cosmetic concealment charms that turn him into William Lourde, he runs every conceivable diagnostic on the chocolate, looking for spells or potions or curses or anything that a nefarious character might lace into an innocent looking confection. He finds nothing. He steeples his fingers together on the kitchen table and regards the chocolate. It’s dark, almost black, he thinks with amusement, with an intricate pattern of spirals on top. It will hardly last him two bites. Carefully, he picks it out of its paper lining and brings it to his mouth. The chocolate is smooth against his fingertips, withstanding the warmth of his hands as he holds it. The scent is a small reminder of the richness of the shop, the memory of his mother’s strategically offered treats, and he brings it to his lips, intoxicated. Luxurious chocolate hits his tongue and he almost moans, then the dark, cocoa flavor is interrupted by warm notes of ginger, lighting up in his mouth. He lets that first, miraculous bite melt away and then takes another, and another, and too soon it’s gone, fading to sweet aftertaste and the spice of ginger in his throat. It is, undoubtedly, the best chocolate he’s ever eaten. He is suddenly heartbroken he’d only purchased one, a sentiment quickly followed by anger as he realizes his weekly, self-rewarded tube of Smarties will never be able to compare.</p><p>He’s still sulking in his chocolate induced stupor when a familiar owl taps at the kitchen window. Sirius waves a hand and the window unlocks itself, the owl flapping its way over to the table. Sirius detaches the letter from its leg, but it sits, waiting for a response. Once he’s read the message, Sirius snorts, and summons a pen from a kitchen drawer to scribble his answer underneath.</p><p>In Dumbledore’s spindly handwriting it says: <em>Have you found yourself a lead?</em></p><p>Then, added in Sirius’s manicured script: <em>Tell your source I owe him a pint. And he owes me 3 pounds. </em></p><p>
  <em> </em>

  <em> </em>
</p><p>Sirius spends the next two weeks scoping out the chocolate shop, keeping track of who enters and who exits, and what they carry with them when they do. At least two people with shaky ties to Death Eaters go in, stay no longer than five minutes, and leave carrying neatly wrapped, unexciting parcels. Sirius is spending nearly every day watching the goings on, and every evening poring over notes and flipping through the photos of the missing. Sirius can’t quite remember when his work for the Order had gone from an occasional obligation to a full time job, but then again everything had changed when the Ministry fell. Ministry bureaucracy, a joke at the best of times, is practically nonexistent under the new regime. The potions trade, once highly regulated, is now open to any shmoe with a cauldron and a working knowledge of chemical reactions. Everyday influence draughts like love potions or aphrodisiacs have always been easy enough to come by, but truth serums were highly regulated. Now they are being sold by the dozen in the middle of Muggle London by a not unattractive shopkeeper who is proving impervious to Sirius’s aristocratic charm. Information is their greatest weapon, and it is being pried from the lips of Order members by chocolate truffles.</p><p>His head jerks up from his notes at the sound of retching from the bathroom. Sighing, he pushes the paper aside and levers himself off the sofa to amble towards the loo. Lily is sitting on the bare linoleum, pajama shirt slipping off one shoulder, red-faced and coughing.</p><p>“Hullo, darling,” he says, squatting down next to her. “How’s my best girl?”</p><p>Lily’s eyes go narrow and dangerous, and she directs all the fury she can muster at Sirius. “Fuck you.”</p><p>“That’s the spirit,” Sirius says, patting her on the back as she leans over the toilet bowl again. Sirius quickly reaches around to grab her hair, holding it back above her shoulder as she vomits. Afterwards, she leans down to let her forehead rest against the ceramic.</p><p>“If James ever comes back I’ll kill him myself.”</p><p>Sirius gives her another pat, twisting her hair more firmly behind her head as another wave of nausea overtakes her.</p><p>They both look up when a sleepy Harry pads into the bathroom. He blinks at them both, eyes wide and unfocused without his glasses, and crosses his legs. “I gotta pee,” he tells them.</p><p>Sirius moves to the side, helping Lily to scoot a few inches across the tile. “Right this way, your highness,” Sirius says, and gestures regally to the toilet.</p><p>Harry quickly crosses the room, tugging down his pajamas as he goes, and Sirius respectfully averts his gaze from his godson. When he’s done, Sirius directs Harry to the sink to wash his hands, and sends him back to bed, smiling at the sound of small feet thwacking down the hall to his bedroom.</p><p>Lily groans again, and Sirius moves quickly, clearing a path back to the toilet.</p><p>“Just think,” he says, rubbing what he hopes are soothing circles into her back. “Five years on and this nightmare of a fetus will be just another myopic sprog in golden snitch pajamas.”</p><p>Lily vomits again in response.</p><p>A thrilling half hour later, Sirius and Lily are back on the sofa, matching mugs of herbal tea in hand (Sirius’s with a healthy dose of firewhiskey), watching late night television and eating wine gums by the handful. Sirius wrinkles his nose around a mouthful.</p><p>“If we’re going to keep doing this, we really should invest in some better sweets.”</p><p>Lily snorts. “Afraid we don’t have a ‘sweets’ subsection in our monthly budget, love.”</p><p>Sirius regards the misshaped gummy in his hand for a moment, then flicks it at Lily. It hits her cheek with a dull smack and bounces off. “Surely we can do better than this,” he says when she turns to glare.</p><p>“I would kill a man for a real chocolate bar,” she admits. “At the very least one we didn’t buy at Tesco.”</p><p>Sirius pauses with a wine gum halfway to his mouth. He’s been putting off going back to the chocolate shop, making excuses about the necessity of further reconnaissance and not wanting to admit that he was nervous about seeing one Remus Lupin again. But Lily is still flushed from being ill in the bathroom, and braving a crush was, comparatively, small potatoes. “You know, Lils, I think I have just the thing.”</p><p> </p><p>*</p><p> </p><p>The chocolate shop is unchanged when Sirius steps inside the next afternoon. Two thirty, he had learned over the past several weeks, seemed to be the peak potion selling hour, with wizarding traffic picking up dramatically until the end of the work day. He has barely made it up to the display case when Remus emerges from the kitchen, and Sirius wonders if he’s spelled the door to notify him when someone enters. Remus is sporting a soft looking long-sleeve shirt and that not-quite-smile that made something hot start to flutter in Sirius’s stomach.</p><p>“Come for your refund, Mr. Lourde?”</p><p>“Not quite,” Sirius replies, tapping a hand on the chocolate case. “I’ve come to make a purchase, in fact.”</p><p>“Oh, lovely.” Remus leans so one hip is resting against the counter. “You were pleased with your last one, I take it?” He asks like he already knows the answer, and Sirius imagines he probably did.</p><p>“It was bloody marvelous, as I’m sure you’re aware,” Sirius says, only a little grumpiness creeping into his tone. “I’d have never thought about ginger and chocolate together, but it was…” he struggles to put into words the experience of eating that first piece, before settling on, “rather nice.”</p><p>Remus lifts an eyebrow. “Rather nice? Oh my word, no. We’ll have to do better than that.”</p><p>Sirius gets the feeling he’s being picked on. He clears his throat. “You got anything herbal?”</p><p>“Certainly,” Remus says, pushing off the counter to walk around the case. “I’ve a lovely basil number in here somewhere. And I think a chamomile, as well.”</p><p>“Chamomile’d be great,” Sirius says. He looks down at where nimble fingers are picking efficiently through the chocolates. “Make it two.”</p><p>Remus lays the candies in a small box identical to the one he’d given Sirius weeks before. “I must say I’m surprised. I’d not pegged you as a chamomile man.”</p><p>“I’m not,” Sirius says quickly, suddenly defensive. “It’s for the pregnant hag I’m living with. She’s got a thing for the teas.” He waves a hand in what he hopes is an illustrative gesture.</p><p>Remus’s eyes widen slightly. “Of course,” he says amiably. “I hadn’t realized you were married. How far along is your wife?”</p><p>Sirius realizes his error before Remus has even finished his sentence. <em>Shite buggering fuck stop talking. </em>“Bout six months,” Sirius replies carefully, ignoring the married comment. <em>We’ll have to figure out the delivery soon, </em>he thinks.</p><p>Remus nods. “Is she still feeling nauseous?”</p><p>Sirius snorts at that. “Why do they call it morning sickness if they’re ill all the bloody time?”</p><p>“A true mystery,” Remus agrees. While Sirius has been floundering, Remus has added two more chocolates to the box.</p><p>“Again, Lupin? I didn’t order those.” Sirius points to the extra truffles.</p><p>“Consider them a gift, Mr. Lourde,” Remus says, placing the lid on the box and sliding it across the counter. “For the missus.”</p><p>Sirius sputters.</p><p>“They’ll help with the nausea,” Remus explains, saving Sirius from formulating a response.</p><p>Which is kind of him. He is kind, Sirius is learning. And maybe it’s the attraction speaking, but he does not seem the sort of man to be smuggling illegal potions out the back door. Which leaves Sirius at a quandary.</p><p>He hands over his coins. “Where’d you become such a dab hand at potions?”</p><p>Remus rings up the purchase without looking, register familiar under his fingers. “Oh, here and there.”</p><p>“I don’t remember seeing you at school,” Sirius says. “What year did you graduate?”</p><p>Remus looks up at that. “I didn’t attend Hogwarts.”</p><p>Sirius blinks. Was it possible he had misread the man?</p><p>“I’m not a squib,” Remus says lightly, as if Sirius had asked the thought out loud. “But due to an unfortunate medical condition, I was unable to attend school with any regularity.”</p><p>“I’m sorry,” Sirius says, adding <em>medical condition</em> to the mental file folder he’s been compiling. </p><p>Remus shrugs. “I am far from uneducated. My parents made sure I received an excellent home education.”</p><p>“Right. And you’re well, now?”</p><p>Remus looks surprised at that, to have been asked, and Sirius smiles.</p><p>“I mean, you’re not about to die on me, right, Lupin?”</p><p>Remus’s lips tug up just slightly. He pushes the box of chocolates into Sirius’s palm. “Not just yet, Mr. Lourde. Good day.”</p><p>Sirius’s hand tingles the entire way home.</p><p> </p><p>*</p><p> </p><p>That night, after Harry has been put to bed and Lily has thrown-up six times into the newly cleaned toilet bowl, they find themselves once again on the sofa, Lily fishing around in the coffee table drawers for a fresh bag of candy.</p><p>“Put that trash away, you vomiting wench,” he says, slapping the wine gums out of her hands.</p><p>“Hey!” Lily protests. “I was gonna eat those!”</p><p>“This is for your own good,” Sirius says, kicking the candies further across the floor, out of reach.</p><p>“This is a dangerous game you’re playing, Black,” Lily says darkly.</p><p>He scoffs. “Like taking candy from a baby.”</p><p>“Yes. You are literally taking candy from a baby. An unborn baby who is trying to murder me from the inside out and will not stand for any sustenance that’s not ketchup crisps or wine gums!”</p><p>Sirius blanches.</p><p>“Give me my fucking candy back.” Lily reaches for her wand, and Sirius springs into action, tripping over the bag of wine gums and flailing into the kitchen.</p><p>“Stop!” Sirius says, dodging a hex. “Wait, wait, Lils, darling, love of my best mate’s life, PUT THE WAND DOWN FOR MERLIN’S SAKE!”</p><p>“CANDY,” Lily shouts. “NOW.”</p><p>Sirius throws the box of chocolates at her and dives behind the kitchen table, another hex shooting past where his head had just been. “Bloody madwoman,” he mutters into the linoleum.</p><p>“What is this?” Lily asks, wand forgotten so she can pry the lid off the box. “Did you buy me chocolates?” she asks, disbelieving.</p><p>“Technically?” Sirius says from beneath the table. “Yes.”</p><p>“Sirius!”</p><p>“Don’t let it go to your head,” he says stubbornly. “I only paid for half of them anyway.”</p><p>Lily has popped one of the chamomile candies in her mouth, and Sirius can hear her groan even from his fortified position. “Oh ma gawf,” she says, mouth still full of melting chocolate.</p><p>Sirius snorts.</p><p>Lily picks up another, one of the two Remus had said would help the nausea, and takes a small bite. She turns around to lean over the couch and stare at Sirius, incredulous. “This is literally the best chocolate I have ever tasted.”</p><p>“Right?”</p><p>“You’re telling me someone gave you half of this for free?”</p><p>“Technically?” Sirius chews at his lip for a second, remembering. “Yes.”</p><p>Lily narrows her eyes, and Sirius shrinks away. “Why?” she asks.</p><p>“Honestly,” Sirius replies, laughing, “I have no idea.”</p><p> </p><p>*</p><p> </p><p>The next time he sees Remus Lupin, he’s in a Tesco, of all places.</p><p>“You wound me, Mr. Lourde,” says a rough, familiar voice behind him.</p><p>Sirius drops the marked down chocolate bar he’s been holding, and whips around.</p><p>“Not even name brand?” Remus tsks. “Shameful.”</p><p>“Yeah, well.” Sirius picks up the chocolate bar and puts it pointedly in his basket, grateful that he’d at least remembered to put his glamours on before this pathetic shopping trip.</p><p>“And here I thought we had something special.”</p><p>Sirius looks up at that. Remus’s lips are pressed together as if he’s containing his smile.</p><p>“Special’s a bit out of my price range, at the moment,” Sirius tells him.</p><p>Remus at least has the good grace to look mildly embarrassed.</p><p>“It’s not for me, though,” Sirius explains, waving a hand at his basket. “You went and spoiled the woman forever with your fancy candy. She won’t even touch the wine gums now.”</p><p>“A tragedy,” Remus says dryly.</p><p>Sirius rolls his eyes, and grabs another bar off the sale shelf with a flourish. “It’s Tesco brand chocolate for us, now. Less than a quid,” he says to Remus. “I’m sure it tastes basically the same.”</p><p>Remus makes a horrified sort of noise. “Take that back.”</p><p>“Make me,” Sirius replies, unthinking. And the playful atmosphere of a moment ago shatters, replaced with something altogether more charged. Sirius resists a shiver.</p><p>Remus inhales sharply through his nose, and Sirius makes a valiant attempt to ignore the shift in tone.</p><p>“I really ought to have a word with your employer,” Remus says with forced lightness. “He could clearly stand to up your salary.”</p><p>Sirius can’t help it. He barks out a laugh.</p><p>“Something comical?” Remus asks.</p><p>“My employer is not someone who’s easily persuaded,” Sirius explains, smirking.</p><p>Remus lifts a shoulder in a shrug. “Surely even Dumbledore can see the benefit of the occasional truffle.”</p><p>Sirius freezes. He can feel the blood draining from his face, is sure he looks a ghostly sight under the fluorescent lights of the supermarket.</p><p>It is at this moment though that a Muggle woman, apparently unaware of the tense, menacing cloud hovering over the candy aisle, scoffs and grumbles and glares at Sirius, reaching around him to grab a jumbo package of Maltesers. She spares a glare for Remus too, as she walks by, before disappearing into the neighboring aisle.</p><p>And while the odd mood in the candy aisle is broken, Sirius is left unsure of where he stands. He smirks over at Remus anyway, who is covering his own smile with his hand. It is fun, he remembers, the flirting. There is something casual and easy about it that makes him forget. He needs to remember. “Someone told you,” he says.</p><p>Remus drops his hand from his mouth, and tilts his head a fraction, not a nod, not a no. “Perhaps you are just not as mysterious as you’d like to believe.”</p><p>“Maybe that’s the point,” Sirius says, unflinching.</p><p>Remus’s surprise is betrayed by his raised eyebrows, a reflex, but one that is quickly counteracted. He shifts a little on his feet, shaking it off. “What is it you do for Dumbledore, then, that requires such-,“ he pauses for a second, as if searching for the words. “Crafted subterfuge?”</p><p>Sirius doesn’t blink. “Whatever he asks me to.”</p><p>Once again, Remus’s eyes widen in reaction, but this time it’s intentional. “My word,” he says dramatically. “And what did dear, old Albus do to win such unwavering loyalty?" </p><p>“More than you can afford, I’m sure,” Sirius says.</p><p>Something flashes across Remus’s face, but it’s an unfamiliar emotion on those features, and Sirius can’t place it. He thinks maybe it’s hurt.</p><p>“I don’t intend to buy your trust, Mr. Lourde,” Remus reaches a hand into his jacket pocket. “But if you’ll let me,” he says quietly, placing a small box into Sirius’s basket, “I should very much like to earn it.” His eyes meet Sirius’s one last time, and then he’s gone. He hadn’t bought anything, Sirius realizes. Hadn’t even been carrying a basket. Sirius looks down at the familiar box in his own, and lets out a shaky breath he wasn’t aware he’d been holding in.</p><p>“Fuck,” Sirius says, and it seems to echo around the empty candy aisle, ringing in his ears as he walks towards the checkout.</p><p> </p><p>*</p><p> </p><p>Over the next month, small boxes of chocolate keep appearing where Sirius will find them, and Order members with useful secrets keep finding truth serums left benignly on their desks, mixed into their cocoa, or in one alarming instance, baked into a batch of brownies their child brought home from school. Sirius has been running every test required by the Order, as well as some Black family originals, and can still find no trace of anything untoward in the candy he’s receiving. Aside from the feeling in his gut and the continuous stream of suspicious patrons entering the chocolate shop, there is no concrete evidence tying Remus Lupin to any crimes. Sirius wants to tear his hair out.</p><p>When he barges into the chocolate shop the next day, he’s carrying the most recent box, one which had been handed to him along with his coffee that morning at his favorite café.</p><p>“Lupin!” He shouts, slapping a palm loudly on top of the display case, making it rattle. “What the hell do you think you’re playing at?”</p><p>An unfamiliar head pokes out from the kitchen, eyes narrowed behind thick-rimmed spectacles. “Sorry, what?”</p><p>Sirius stares at the boy. “Where’s Lupin?”</p><p>The kid sniffs, pushing his glasses up when they threaten to slip off his nose. “He’s not here.”</p><p>“I need to speak with him,” Sirius says, with forced calm.</p><p>“Like I said, he’s not here.”</p><p>Sirius grinds his teeth together and takes a steadying breath. “Know when he’ll be back?”</p><p>The boy, to his credit, does not seem in the least intimidated by Sirius’s scowl. Sirius makes a mental note to work on that. </p><p>“He’ll be back on Thursday,” the boy says, peering disconcertingly at Sirius.</p><p>“What’s your problem, kid?”</p><p>“Mr. Lupin doesn’t like shouting.”</p><p>Sirius rolls his eyes, because of course he doesn’t. “Whatever.” He points a finger at the boy. “Tell Lupin I wanna talk with him, kay?”</p><p>“Sure,” the kid says, and stares, owl-eyed, at Sirius until he’s left.</p><p>It’s only Monday. The box of chocolates sits heavy in Sirius’s pocket.</p><p> </p><p>*</p><p> </p><p>“’Dear Daisy,’” Lily says that evening, stack of letters in her lap. “’I’ve just discovered that my son is a pouf.’”</p><p>Sirius guffaws into his tea as Lily continues.</p><p>“’I found him necking a neighbor boy in the basement. I’ve tried to reason with him, but he says he won’t stop being gay.’”</p><p>Sirius chokes on a sip, and Lily whacks him on the arm, grinning. “Wait, oh my god, Sirius, it gets better. ‘I’m very worried about what will happen when the garden club finds out.’”</p><p>“Are you sure this isn’t your sister?” Sirius asks, and Lily punches him in the shoulder.</p><p>“Dudley is only five,” she points out. “I should hope he’s not snogging <em>anyone</em> yet. ‘How do I convince my son to make the right choice and stop kissing boys in the basement?’”</p><p>“Ah, yes,” Sirius says sagely. “The age old question.”</p><p>Lily snorts. “’Any advice much appreciated. Sincerely, Deeply Concerned.’”</p><p>“She’s not the only one,” Sirius says, and Lily sniggers next to him, reaching for her pen.</p><p>“Oh, this is going to be fun.”</p><p>Sirius watches as she scribbles out her response. He flips aimlessly through some field reports, pausing occasionally to refill their tea. The coffee table is covered in paper, between Sirius’s notes, Lily’s “Dear Daisy” letters, and the scattered artwork of five-year-old Harry, who is sitting on the floor with a box of crayons and a long forgotten plate of fish fingers. Sirius spares a moment to wonder how he’d gotten so domestic.</p><p>“Alright, listen to this,” Lily says, straightening the paper in her hand with a crack. “’Dear Concerned, you could help to illustrate an important lesson to your son by changing your own sexuality, maybe just for a year or so, to show him how very easy it is. Help him to see that your sexuality is a choice – one influenced, of course, by concerned parents and garden club members – and is easily corrected if you just put your mind to it.’”</p><p>Sirius presses his head back into the sofa cushions, giggling uncontrollably. </p><p>“If you’re sitting there certain that this task is impossible, I commend you on your perceptive nature and encourage you not to force such impossible standards on your son. He is who he is, and if you cannot accept that, it is most likely not in his best interests to stay in your home. As he has gone to the trouble of hiding his dalliances in arguably the least romantic room in your home, I imagine you’ve already done a considerable amount in creating an uncomfortable and unhealthy living environment. I encourage you to seek out resources that can help with these matters, such as PFLAG, which has a central office here in London, the address of which you will find at the bottom of this column. Love is love, my dear Concerned. Be grateful for the gifts you have, and tell your garden club ladies to mind their own damn business.’” Lily grins wickedly. “’Sincerely, Daisy.’”</p><p>“You,” Sirius says, clutching a hand to his heart, “are my all-time, absolute, favorite person.”</p><p>Lily winks. “I try.” She separates the answered letter from the rest of the stack, and sets both down neatly on the coffee table. “Speaking of favorite people, any sign of my new best friend, the mysterious chocolatier?”</p><p>Sirius’s face darkens, and he scowls at Lily. “Jacob handed me another box this morning.”</p><p>“He sent them to the coffee shop?” Lily asks, and winces when Sirius nods. “This may be getting slightly out of hand.”</p><p>“Slightly,” Sirius agrees.</p><p>There’s a beat of silence, which features Lily chewing on her lip in thought, then making grabby hands at Sirius. “Gimme.”</p><p>“Incorrigible,” Sirius mutters, but passes the box over nonetheless. </p><p>“They’re just so damn good,” Lily says, prying the lid off with glee. “You’ve checked these, though? Just in case?”</p><p>“Of course. Extensively,” Sirius confirms. “Nothing.”</p><p>“Well, at least he’s not trying to poison you,” Lily says cheerfully.</p><p>“Yet,” Sirius replies darkly, and Lily rolls her eyes. “I’m serious – shut up!” He says when she opens her mouth to interject, smirking. “I’m serious, Lils. I don’t trust him.”</p><p>Lily takes a bite of chocolate and groans. “Because he’s stalking you?” she asks casually.</p><p>“He wasn’t at the shop today,” Sirius says.</p><p>“And you missed him?” Lily teases.</p><p>Sirius glares.</p><p>“Besides the fact that he’s clearly a little… overeager in his affections, is there a reason you’re so-“ she makes a gesture at Sirius meant to encompass the crossed arms, the deep frown, the narrowed eyes. “Suspicious?”</p><p>Sirius’s notes on the case were sitting next to Lily’s letters on the coffee table. He’s charmed them all confidential. If Lily or Harry picks one up, they’ll see nothing of import, but Sirius still looks intently elsewhere. “No,” he says, half-shrugging. “I guess not.”</p><p> </p><p>*</p><p> </p><p>Thursday morning, Sirius goes to get his daily cup at the café six tube stops and a fifteen minute walk from their apartment. Jacob the barista smiles when he comes in, and Sirius glowers at him. There are no chocolates handed across the counter with his coffee. He gives a brusque nod to Jacob in thanks. He’s fixing it the way he always does (one cream, five sugars), when a low, mischievous voice says behind him, “I heard you’ve been harassing my shop boy.”</p><p>Sirius leaves his coffee on the counter and whirls around, diatribe about personal space and boundaries on the tip of his tongue, when he sees Lupin. He looks a mess. There are deep, dark circles under his eyes. His face is wan and pale, and the recognized constellations of scars on his skin, normally faded, seem fresh in a way they hadn’t the last time Sirius had seen them.</p><p>“The fuck happened to you?” Sirius asks, because higher brain function comes with coffee, and he is being prevented from drinking his by the sickly, still stupidly attractive, sometimes-stalker standing in front of him.</p><p>Remus cocks his head at him in question. “I did tell you I have a medical condition.”</p><p>And that’s right, he had told Sirius, and Sirius had made a mental note, and then all that information had been replaced in his mind by the lines of Remus’s hands in the light of the shop, the shape of well-known chocolate boxes in his pockets. Sirius reaches behind him and takes a long pull of coffee, too bitter; his sugaring had been interrupted. But he feels the first rush of caffeine firing through his brain, and shrugs. “Could have been asthma,” he tells Remus. Sirius gets a not-quite-smile at that, and his heart rate kicks up. He makes up his mind to blame it on the caffeine. “It’s not, though, is it?”</p><p>Remus shakes his head. “It’s not.”</p><p>“Stop following me,” Sirius says.</p><p>“You started it,”</p><p>“I did not!” Sirius protests.</p><p>“Did too,” Remus replies, and Sirius throws up his hands.</p><p>“I’m not doing this with you.”</p><p>“Then what are you doing?”</p><p>“I’m fighting a goddamn war!” Sirius yells, temper snapping.</p><p>Remus does not recoil an inch. He gazes intently at Sirius, head still tilted, studying, unsettling. “Are you?” he asks.</p><p>Sirius blinks, rage still simmering just there, under his skin. He turns around. “Yeah,” he says lowly. “Why aren’t you?”</p><p>Remus does draw back a little at that. He glances around quickly, but for the most part the curious Muggles that had turned to look at Sirius’s outburst have gone back to what they’d been doing. He drops his voice to match Sirius’s. “I’m fighting to stay alive, just like everyone else.”</p><p>Sirius snaps a lid on his coffee cup with force. “Fuck that,” he says. “I’m not fighting for my life, Lupin.” He turns around in time to see Remus take two steps forward, so that they’re just inches apart. The scars on his face stand out in drastic relief.</p><p>“Then what, pray tell, <em>are</em> you fighting for, Mr. Lourde?”</p><p>Unflinching, unwavering, Sirius stands his ground. “The greater good.”</p><p>Remus narrows his eyes at him. “And who decides which good is greatest?” He asks icily. “You? Your precious Albus?”</p><p>“Better him than your lot,” Sirius grows.</p><p>“My lot?” Remus says, quirking an eyebrow, all innocence. “Have you got something against chocolatiers now?”</p><p>Sirius grits his teeth, shoving past Remus towards the door. “Got to hell,” he mutters as he passes, and Remus’s hushed voice chases him out.</p><p>“I’ve already been, thanks.”</p><p> </p><p>*</p><p> </p><p>Dorcas Meadowes goes missing the following Tuesday. Her body is recovered less than a day later, after two unsuspecting Muggle trash collectors open the wrong dumpster lid. They, along with the police officers who arrived at the scene, are obliviated in quick succession, and Dorcas is taken back to the makeshift Order headquarters, which consists of a table, some conjured folding chairs, and a battered sofa Sirius and Gideon had levitated in from the alley.</p><p>“Do we have a cause of death?” Dumbledore asks upon arrival.</p><p>Hestia Jones, their only registered mediwitch, shakes her head. “It wasn’t any kind of curse I’m familiar with.”</p><p>Dumbledore strokes his beard in thought. “Where was she stationed?”</p><p>Gideon glances at the schedule board floating in the corner. “Patrolling Knockturn and Haymarket. Last I heard she was chasing down a suspect in the potions case.”</p><p>Sirius looks up from where he’d been staring at his shoelaces, not wanting to see Dorcas’s corpse cold and still on the table. “Veritaserum,” he says softly, almost to himself, but Gideon hears.</p><p>“Veritaserum’s not fatal.”</p><p>“No,” Sirius agrees. “But her abduction fits the pattern.” He taps, unsettled, at his forehead, thought forming just there beneath the surface.</p><p>“Why would they kill her?” Gideon is asking, and Sirius thumps harder.</p><p>Hestia shrugs. “Sent us a message.”</p><p>“But they didn’t send it,” Gideon argues. “They pitched her in a dumpster.”</p><p>Sirius shakes his head, trying to clear the image of Dorcas, only twenty-six, wide-eyed and tossed in with the garbage.</p><p>“Maybe it was an accident then,” Hestia suggests.</p><p>Dumbledore is quiet, watching Sirius become more and more agitated across the room.</p><p>“How do you accidentally kill someone?” Gideon asks, and Sirius shoots to his feet.</p><p>“Allergies,” he says, pointing frantically at Hestia, who turns back to the body and wrinkles her nose in confusion.</p><p>“I guess the results could be indicative of anaphylactic shock,” she says, waving her wand gently over Dorcas, the tip glowing a faint blue. “But it still doesn’t make any sense. The only thing she was allergic to was chocolate.”</p><p>Sirius’s brain is going a mile a minute, and he throws wild eyes to Dumbledore. “Sir, permission to-“</p><p>“Go,” Dumbledore says quickly, and Sirius is gone.</p>
