          <div class="userstuff"><p>James Potter was going on a date. With Lily Evans of all people, the girl he had loved for like, practically his entire life! Well, for five years, but same thing. Seems legit. He was a little nervous though, and that was understandable. </p><p>Right now he was in the dorms with his best friend. They were chilling. He was getting ready. </p><p>"Hey Pads, do you have any cologne? I think Evans would be impressed by that." And if Remus Lupin was here, he'd say something about how James shouldn't call her by her last name since they were going out. </p><p>Sirius looked up. "No, Remus said I’m not allowed to wear cologne again until I prove I can be responsible with it."</p><p>...okay then, whatever that means. Ominous. </p></div>
