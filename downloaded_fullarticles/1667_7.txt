    <span>“Severus… Give it to me.” </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“Yes, my lord.” A pale hand, reaching out expectantly. A twisting crystal, placed into a palm. A circle, detailed and intricate on the floor. Triangles and shapes and grooves carved into the smooth grey surface. .</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“Excellent.” Holding the stone up to his eyes, he examined it, watching the torchlight play off the strange curves and jagged edges. “And you are sure this is it?” </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“Yes, my lord.” </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>He laughs, high pitched and cold. “Then let us perform the ritual without delay. The warrior awaits.”</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Magic, surging through his veins. The crystal dropping to the floor and shattering as magic poured into it, the circle starting to glow. Chanting. Foreign and dangerous. It surged up to the boiling point, gleeful, as a shape started twisting into existence, dark shadows and burning, piercing green eyes, wide and demented. A being staggering to its feet, eyes fixed on his own, soon the most powerful warrior through all of time would be </span>

<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Harry surged awake, his scar burning, a shout trapped in his throat. His hands shook, palms damp as he scrambled out of bed, fumbling for his glasses. Like all visions, it was immediately starting to slide away from him, dripping through his fingers like sand. He shoved his glasses on, blinking into the dark of his room for a moment, illuminated only by the streetlamps outside, before squeezing his eyes shut, trying to catch the remainder of the dream.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Voldemort had been pleased. No, he had been </span>
  <em>
    <span>ecstatic</span>
  </em>
  <span>. Something was happening- something that he had been working towards. Something dangerous. A weapon, or- or- </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>A </span>
  <em>
    <span>warrior. </span>
  </em>
  <span>Voldemort had been trying to summon a warrior. Harry all but threw himself across his room to his rickety desk, scrambling for a piece of parchment. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Snuffles- </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He paused, ink dripping from his quill. How on earth was he supposed to word this? He had to be careful with his words, the letters from his friends all summer oozing with the need to press the need for secrecy onto him. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Snuffles-</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>I’m dreaming again, you know about who. He was happy. It hurt. In the dream, he was almost trying to… I don’t know, summon something I guess. Some kind of ultimate fighter or warrior or great person. It’s fading, but it felt… dangerous. I can’t remember too much. Nightmares always go fast, right? This one feels like it’s going to linger. Like it’ll have a real lasting effect, if you know what I mean.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>But I guess it was just a dream. It doesn’t really matter that much in the end, right? Hopefully it’s not some kind of bad omen.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Wish you were here. The Dursleys are being horrible as usual, so nothing new on that front. </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>-Harry</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He set it aside for a moment to dry. Hedwig had perked up the moment she saw he was writing a letter and he rose to his feet.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Hey girl.” He said softly, holding out a finger to her. She nipped it affectionately and he slowly ran his fingers down her back, over her soft feathers. “Got a letter for Sirius for you. Wait for a reply, okay?” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>She hooted softly in affirmation. He bundled up the now-dry letter and tied it to her leg, offering her his arm. She hopped onto it and preened his hair as he brought her over to the window. He opened it and let her fly out. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Harry watched her vanish into the night sky. He felt too awake, too wired to fall back asleep, so instead he reached for his textbook, intent on getting a little work done. His scar prickled and he rubbed at it, wincing slightly. It felt like it was going to be a long night.</span>
