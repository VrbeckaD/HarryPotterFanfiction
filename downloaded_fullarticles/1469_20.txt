<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>It has been two turbulent years since the Second Wizarding War. Voldemort, the Dark Lord died at the hands of the Boy Who Lived and the world thanked him for his sacrifice. Death Eaters and Voldemort sympathisers either turned each other in or scattered like cockroaches, seeking dark crevices to hide. Those who sought repentance could serve as Ministry fugitive hunters, to track and capture the elusive criminals they once called their peers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Britain and Europe had made attempts to rebuild their magical societies. Hundreds of thousands of witches and wizards can live and work safely without fear of their blood statuses. However hard the Ministries tried though, money and work became scarce. Homeless and weary witches and wizards were often found wandering through Diagon Alley, begging from shop to shop. For food, money or work. The fortunate visitors of the district kept their gaze down or would drop a sympathetic knut into a grubby pleading hand. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Amongst the throngs on the streets worked a healer, who shared her talents with the sick and homeless. She cared for the unwashed and the hungry with the same loving kindness as she did for her private patients at St Mungo's. Even the busy shopkeepers, who had plenty of other things to do, stood to watch and extoll her virtues.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Merlin, how wonderful she is!” An owl keeper said.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Merlin bless this witch! For she has cured my Dragon Pox.” A teary vagabond cried.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So loved and admired on the streets, the witches and wizards called her The Nightingale. For she was as powerful and kind as the famous nurse of years gone by.</p>
<p> </p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>Far away from the meandering filth of Diagon Alley, in the heart of the Wiltshire greens stood Malfoy Manor. It was, without any doubt, the most beautiful estate in the country. It was made of fine sandstone that glimmered gold in the sunset. There were delicate white peacocks that sauntered through the magical gardens. The rarest and most exquisite flowers, known only to keen herbologists flourished on the grounds. The finest of all the flowers were enchanted to ring silver bells hung around them. So that one could not pass without looking at them.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The elaborate iron-wrought gate to the grand Manor twisted and contorted to allow a young man of platinum blond hair to pass. His face was distinct with eyes that glinted as hardened steel, hard enough to pierce another’s soul. But those eyes never twinkled with joy, for he had seen too much darkness in his youth. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>His usual easy stride was hindered by a limp, his fine robes were sooted with grime and dirt. An amethyst bruise covered the right side of his jaw. Any onlooker could see the golden Master of the Manor had yet another skirmish with Death himself.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Draco, my son.” An elegant woman of fair hair greeted him at the front door of his home. Narcissa Malfoy held her only son firmly, her heart cracked and aching at his dishevelled appearance.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Mother, I am in need of a bath and some Dittany.” Gently prising himself from her loving arms, worried to get dirt on her sophisticated robes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Of course, I’ll send some to your rooms now.” The Master thanked her as he climbed the grand staircase of marble.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“My darling, before I forget. Your friends will arrive in about an hour.” He hid his displeasure and nodded with understanding.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Once bathed, soothed with salves and potions. The blond wizard donned clean clothes before he journeyed to the evening sitting room, one of many rooms the Malfoys used to entertain their guests. Within the room, underneath a glittering chandelier sat a group of young men like himself, Pureblooded and former Slytherins from Hogwarts.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Good evening boys.” The Master of the Manor said. He poured a glass of fairie wine, which is the finest wines in the land. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Why Theo. It’s good to see you. We thought death had taken you after your last mission.”</p>
<p>The fellow fugitive hunter, Theo Nott was a chestnut-haired young man with rabbit-like features. He wore an eyepatch which leant him a jaunty look.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I would have been cradled by death’s bosom, was it not by luck that I was healed by the Nightingale.” The room of Slytherins stared in puzzlement.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Who is the Nightingale?”</p>
<p>“Her identity is a secret. For she wears a grey drab cloak over her face. Her presence on the streets can stir even the most hopeless men to rise with optimism. Her healing abilities isn’t limited to spells and potions but she incorporates muggle healing practices that allow a wizard on the brink of life to return  to his full vitality.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Curious as ever, Draco Malfoy wanted to know more about the mysterious healer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Where did you find her?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I didn’t, she found me.” Theo replied, much to Draco’s surprise. “I collapsed in the gutter, waiting for eternal sleep. My wounds were deep and I would not have been able to survive, had she not appeared by my side. She transported me to her clinic while I lay unconscious. There she treated my injuries and prescribed a healing program for my pre-existing health problems.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Fascinated by such a talented healer, the Master of the Manor reminded himself to seek her out. For he too has sustained ongoing injuries from his work as a Death Eater hunter. Right now the men in the room drank heavily, smoked their pipes and bragged of their triumphs – fugitives and women – until the oil lamps burned brightly and the stars twinkle in the night sky.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Long after the owls have flown and hunted. Only the moon remained awake to sing its waning song, did Draco went to sleep. His head swirled with drunkenness and lips murmured incoherent utterances. The early morning had long past, many hours after rosy-cheeked dawn had drawn her chariot across the sky, and forward marched linear time. The beautiful and troubled master slept on in disturbed sleep.</p>
<p> </p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>It was late afternoon, when Draco Malfoy finally ventured from the golden Manor to the jungle of St Mungo’s hospital. Despite the patients’ need for tranquillity to heal their ailing bodies, St Mungo’s was a cacophony of frantic healers, mumbling cleaners and caterers. A chorus of patients’ wails, beeps and sirens from healing machinery; a far cry from the paradise of the Manor’s gardens.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Wiggenweld wanted now!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Take a deep breath in and out.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You’ll be fixed up in a jiffy.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The voices echoed from the wards and down the corridor towards Draco. A cloying smell of potion fumes, cleaning substances and sickliness clung to his being that brought the urge to wretch. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Can I help you, Sir?” His steel-hardened eyes stared down at the inquisitive receptionist at her desk. </p>
<p>“I’m here for the healer they call The Nightingale.” He commanded.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry but there’s no Healer Nightingale here.” She replied in puzzlement.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You are the only magical hospital in the country,” Draco complained. “Surely the famous healer known as The Nightingale is under employment here.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The receptionist shifted uncomfortably in her seat. “Sir, I do not know who you are referring to.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The platinum blond man stood to his full height, sneering down at the lowly-paid employee of the hospital.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Find me the nearest available healer then.”</p>
<p>At his command, the terrified employee leapt from behind her desk and hurried down the corridor into the labyrinth of the hospital. The impatient blond visitor waited as the deafening chorus of hospital noises enveloped him. His left wrist twinged with pain from a hard fall he’d taken, just last week. He can’t run like he used to, for his knees may burn in agony with each step. The scattering of scars across his body flares from time to time, each like a bloom of stinging nettles all over him. But worst of all, there was the issue of the uncomfortable pain deeply embedded in his chest. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Eventually, the more flustered receptionist returned to her desk, panting out of breath.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You need to go down this corridor, turn right after the Capricorn Ward, climb up the stairs to the first floor. Then immediately turn left, past the Jupiter Ward, the Callisto Wardm, and the Europa ward. The office will be on your right with the olive door.” She uttered all in one raspy breath. Draco didn’t bother to thank her as he walked away with purpose.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And so he went down the corridor, where he sidestepped the cleaners mopping. He turned right after the Capricorn ward, and avoided contact with a patient who had escaped the Janet Thickey ward. He rapted the office with the olive door and strode in without waiting for a response. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The small box room of an office was solely occupied by an individual. Her white healer robes were clean but crinkled. She sat at a desk, which strained under mountains of books and hills of parchment scrolls. Her ink-stained right hand scratched words with mechanical precision using a worn down quill. The feathered tip was as bald as the plucked bird it came from. The healer’s mottled brown hair was held back with a thick band into a bushy tail.</p>
<p>Draco was most struck by the healer’s face, her features were more delicate than he remembered. Thick brows were crossed in a concentrated frown. She finished her sentence before turning to greet him, with the air of someone who’s reluctant about being interrupted.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“How can I help you today Malfoy?” An ink-stained hand gestured for him to sit at the medical table which occupied most of the room.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Granger. I didn’t realise you are a healer.” He stated as he sat on the sterilised table.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“It’s because it’s of no concern to you.” She replied as she stood in front of him. Their eyes level, he noted how her brown ones studied him with curiosity. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Well, I’m looking for the healer called the Nightingale. Do you know who she is?” He said frankly, knowing Granger wasn’t a woman who tolerated lies.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Why are you looking for her? I hear she only treats the poor and the destitute. From your appearance, you look like neither.” Her tone was harsh and suspicious.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“In my line of work, I have suffered from several health complications.” He explained delicately.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“What kind of work do you do? I assume you don’t do it for money.” Granger quipped, her tongue was as sharp and mind as inquisitive as he remembered.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I’m a fugitive hunter for wanted Death Eaters. So you can imagine, I can get into a fair amount of skirmishes.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The witch before him pursed her lips in thought and Draco wondered if she wore lipstick for their rosy colour. Finally, she spoke after a moment of contemplation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I can’t help you find The Nightingale. However, I will offer to treat you as my patient.” She offered kindly, but it wasn’t the offer Draco wanted to receive. He stood to leave and glanced down at her puzzled face.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Thank you for your offer, but I’ll take my search elsewhere.” Without another word, he stepped out of the cramped box office and left behind the hospital. He found his way out of the labyrinth of wards and sickness, into the open air. Leaving the hospital, he began to plan how he could use his hunting skills to find The Nightingale.</p>
<p> </p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>The moon hid behind the clouds of onyx and she dared not show her face in Knockturn Alley. Only a few windows glowed with a faint tint of burnished amber. The crooked street contorted and gave little room for idle pedestrians. The blond hunter knew his path well and didn’t require additional light as he darted from shadow to shadow. </p>
<p>He concealed his gleaning platinum hair under a hooded cloak and wore a mask to not draw notice to his bright steel-hardened eyes. At first sight there appeared to be a pile of rags discarded between old broken barrels, but upon closer inspection, the rags were a lowly beggar. His age was unidentifiable due to the wrinkled grime upon his face, and his mouth was lined with jagged coal coloured molars. Draco knelt down to this beggar, close enough to whisper into his ear and to be overwhelmed by the vagabond’s stench.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“What do you want this time?” The voice was raspier than a forest in a storm.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Information on the Nightingale.” Draco whispered.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The beggar gave a spluttering laughing cough. “She should be of no concern of yours.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The golden hunter produced a shimmering sickle and presented it in front of a pair of dark glassy eyes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I want to know who she heals and how does she find them.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The beggar longingly gazed at the pristine silver coin and shook his head furiously, as if to shake himself out of his reverie.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I cannot betray her! She has saved my life before and gave me nourishment after a heartless monster mocked, spat, and hexed me while his breath reeked of beer and his face flushed with drunkenness. His friends laughed at his torture of me. Then in a flash, she stunned the vile wizard and brought me to her clinic.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The golden hunter tucked away the silver sickle which proved unconvincing in its persuasion, only to replace it before the beggar’s face a glimmering galleon.</p>
<p>“I’m not going to hurt her. I just need to speak to her.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Those glassy eyes could no longer stray from temptation and sooted, twig-like fingers, snatched at the golden galleon. The beggar placed it between his rotted teeth  and bit hard to check its authenticity. The beggar coughed as he clutched his new, and only, possession.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“She won’t come to you dressed as the fine toff you are now. She will only approach the very destitute or if you were in grave danger on these very streets. It’s hard to know what time she patrols for new patients. Sometimes in the darkest of nights and other times under the glaring high sun.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The blond nodded, having all the information he required. In a swift motion, he struck the grime-covered man on the head and caught him before his dirty face was broken on the jutting pavings. The glimmering galleon rolled in an attempted escape from its new owner and Draco carefully tucked it away amongst the folds of the beggar’s pockets. With a grimace, the hunter wrenched a handful of greasy, crinkled hair from the beggar’s thinning scalp and left him completely unaware and unconscious. </p>
<p> </p>
<hr/>
<p>The drizzling rain pelted down upon him as Draco sat in a crevice between two shops in Diagon Alley. The wetness seeped through the rags he procured, his dirtied up skin, and into his very bones. He allowed himself to visibly shiver and shake to stay warm, as well as enhance the pitiful sight of himself. Occasionally, the golden hunter sipped at the mud-like polyjuice potion, kept wrapped up in old strips of cloth, gagging each time. All his joints in this unfamiliar body ached, his legs suffered from pins and needles, caused by the crouched position in which he sat.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It had been a few hours since he arrived that morning. From time to time he would beg passing walkers for a spare knut. They offered half-hearted muffled apologies before shuffling away or ignoring him as if an invisibility cloak covered him completely. A limping hag approached him with a filthy cup, filled with water. He swore and shouted at her until she scuttled away in terror. News would travel fast that this particular vagabond was to be left well alone.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mid-day welcomed the luncheon crowd as throngs of workers and shopkeepers congregated at the Leaky Cauldron or the small food stalls that opened on Diagon Alley to feed the hungry masses. Wafts of wholesome soups, sizzling sausages and piping hot pies floated on the air with the calls from the vendors. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Freshly made sandwiches! Homemade lemonade!” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Eight knuts for the lunch deal! Hurry before they’re gone!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Best pies in all of London! Grab them while they’re hot!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The sounds of hawkers, the perfumed smells of sumptuous warm food, and the sight of workers laden with boxes of their lunch had caused an uproar of protests in Draco’s stomach. The disguised hunter watched the comings and goings of people with an attentive eye. Amongst the crowd of preoccupied shoppers and busy shopkeepers, perhaps the Nightingale would patrol the streets.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A sympathetic soul dropped a paper bag in his lap, inside was a hastily wrapped but comfortingly warm sausage roll. The generous donor didn’t hang about as Draco coughed a raspy thanks to him and devoured the food in quick bites. The crackle of the layered pastry and the tender salty filling placated his protesting stomach with satisfying nourishment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Eventually, the clouds of drizzle parted to reveal  the sun making its journey home, casting a warm orange-purple hue over the wizarding street. Shopkeepers started to usher out their last customers and locked their doors for the night. Workers headed down to Leaky Cauldron, for a cheeky pint or ready to put their feet up at home. Draco found some fresh dry cardboard nearby and lined the floor of his location. It would insulate him from the cold damp pavement for the long night ahead of him. He stuffed discarded Daily Prophet pages between his cold skin and damp rags to warm himself. His stomach complained vocally now that the sausage roll had been digested so many hours ago. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Very few people were left around Diagon Alley. An elderly witch hobbled down to Leaky Cauldron, her robes were covered in cats’ hair and she had a fluffy white kitten perched on her hunched shoulders. A group of Ministry employees, still wearing their badges walked past. They chatted and gossiped whilst idly making their way to a restaurant further down. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>A vagabond begged the group for some spare change and a few knuts were dropped into his grateful hands. A homeless witch with holes in her shoes, pulled out a sleeping bag, a few sheets of cardboard and a thick woollen hat from a small drawstring bag she carried and made camp in an alcove near Flourish &amp; Blotts.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A pebble rolled towards Draco, knocking into his foot, catching his attention and causing him to lookup. A wizard in his autumnal years glared down at him whilst walking in his direction. His robes were of pristine moss velvet, his features were stern. The wizard was smoking a pipe and just as he passed by, dumped the hot ashes into the disguised hunter’s lap.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Fucking Twat!” Draco cursed loudly at the man as he quickly brushed burning ashes off himself.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The man whipped around, his nostrils flared in anger growling,“What did you say to me?” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I said,” wrapping his hand around his concealed wand. “FUCKING TWAT!” Every enunciated word echoed down the alley. The homeless witch huddled in her sleeping bag nearby turned towards them to watch the spectacle. Draco was ready to protect himself as the man strode towards him with his wand raised.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You little scumbag hobo!” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Petrificus Totalus!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Invisible ropes bound the man suddenly and he dropped flat on his face. The disguised hunter was confused. Who cast that spell?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A figure appeared from the shadows, their identity completely hidden by a grey hooded cloak. The Nightingale! She stepped towards the bound man whose face was planted into the dirt of the cobbled street.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“That should teach you a lesson.” Her voice was melodic but firm. Draco recognised the tone, the cadence, that special quality in her voice, but he couldn’t quite place his finger on where he had heard it before. She healed the fallen wizard’s bleeding face and expulsed him far down the alley towards the Leaky Cauldron. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco released his wand and thumbed a small gem-like object in his pocket as he watched his target with great intrigue; waiting for the right moment to carry out his plan.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Nightingale turned and made her way towards him. Her face completely disguised under those grey drab robes. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Merlin bless you -” he started a coughing fit and covered his mouth. A pretence for the slight of hand where he proceeded to slip a Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes Skiving Snackbox Fainting Fancies in his mouth and sucked hard on the sweet. Her warm hands clasp his shoulders before his world turned black. </p>
<p> </p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>Someone prised one of his eyes open and burned his retina with a blazing brightness. Draco flinched in discomfort and sat up.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Oh good. You’re awake.” A melodic voice chimed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He rubbed his eyes and adjusted to his surroundings. A cramped room, surrounded by cabinets filled with vials and jars of ingredients, and a bookcase overflowing with books, it’s crevices stuffed with rolls of parchment. A handful of candle stubs floated near the ceiling to bask the small space in their soft glow. The bright light he felt on his eye came from the grey figure’s wand pointed directly at him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You’re the Nightingale.” He said as he reached for his wand. His voice was back to normal and his wand was missing. There was only one explanation, she  knew who he was and taken his wand from him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Why are you searching for me, Draco Malfoy?” She asked from underneath her grey hood. Her wand hadn’t moved an inch. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Slowly the golden hunter raised his hands. “I mean no harm to you. I’m only seeking your help.” He pleaded. Nerves causing his heart to beat an unsteady rhythm.</p>
<p>“You turned down an offer of help from Healer Granger. I won’t accept a patient who has declined her talents.” She dismissed his plea and in that moment of desperation, Draco tore open the ragged shirt he wore to reveal his lean chest. While he couldn’t see her face, he knew she could see clearly what was happening to him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Dark inky veins clustered around his heart and spread their bluish tendrils across his chest. Large, ridged, pinkish scars layered underneath the dark web on his chest. He held his breath as he waited for her to observe his broken body. Slowly she lowered her wand and raised a small pale hand towards him. She stepped forward, cool fingertips brushed against his heart, traced the rivers of dark veins. Goose pimples spread across his arms and he shivered from her delicate touch. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Let me ask a favour of you and this is the only time I will ask.” Her breath blew onto him like clean cool mint.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Ask me anything Nightingale. I am at your mercy. If you want gold, treasures, prized ingredients. Anything you want and I shall give it to you.” He begged. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Her fingers traced along one of the longer ridged scars that he acquired in Hogwarts from the Boy who Lived. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“My only favour is this: Please ask Healer Granger to heal you.” Draco was astounded by the request. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“How can you ask me for such a favour? When I want you and only you, Nightingale to heal me. Nobody, not even Healer Granger can save me. Please.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Nightingale stepped away from him to reach for an item in one of the cabinets and closed her fist around it. Reaching her fist towards him, he offered her his open palm. Opening her fist, a small bronze pocket watch fell into his hand. The glass face was cracked and the marching of time had frozen. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I’m sorry Draco, I cannot heal a man who has refused my help twice.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The golden hunter felt confused from the rejection and watched a small delicate hand pull back the grey hood. A glorious honey brown crown of curls blossomed from underneath the fabric. Draco stared in disbelief as Hermione Granger’s face came into view, her brown eyes filled with sadness.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Goodbye Draco Malfoy. Don’t come looking for me again.” Hermione swished her wand and before Draco had a chance to apologise for his grievances, he felt a familiar pull in his belly and was gone.</p>
<p> </p>
