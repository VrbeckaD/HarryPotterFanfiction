    <p>The house that he knew so well, that he had spent the preceding fifty years of his life in, had never seemed do dark, so alien, to him. Never had he been so frightened in his own home, but now his heart was threatening to explode out of his chest with every beat that was meant to sustain his life. Not even the threat posed by the Death Eaters and Lord Voldemort had frightened him as much as this did.</p><p>This time he was very certain that there would be no reprieve, no close escape, this time he was going to die!</p><p>He fervently wished that he had not dropped his wand in his attempt to escape his own bedroom. The rattle of it tumbling down the stairs, stairs that he did not dare use because of what waited at the bottom, had seemed like the wild staccato of Death approaching on swift wings to claim him.</p><p>Not even managing to escape the building offered much hope to him. Apparation might save him, but only for a short time until he was found again. That was the damnable lot of it all for he was being pursued by a ruthless killer who would have no trouble in locating him, no matter where he went or how well he hid. He had known that he was as good as dead from the moment that his home had been invaded.</p><p>It had only been by providence that he had awakened in time to prevent being a victim that was found in his bed. More than a few other witches and wizards had been found in this state and a hunt was being conducted by the Ministry of Magic and the Aurors to catch the culprit or culprits before more magical blood was spilled.</p><p><em>‘The Aurors,’</em> he thought with derision. <em>‘They are naught but lapdogs for the rich and powerful in our world. Not even the renowned Harry Potter is much more than a puppet who’s strings are held taut by the Minister and his every move controlled by an egotistical despot and fool  They had much more honor when I served them all of those years.’</em></p><p>He was brought out of thought by the appearance of an unfamiliar shadow in the corridor. Terrified, he turned and raced away from this menace only to slam into the railing and nearly hurl himself over this barrier. The three story tumble, as well as assorted likely impacts with other objects on the way down promised almost certain death. A person thinking more clearly might have found this end quick and preferable to the one that he faced otherwise.</p><p>He was nearly down this hall when he remembered the cupboard. The cupboard and what lay within it might actually save him if he could get there before fate caught up with him.</p><p>As he tried to slip from shadow to shadow to get to the cupboard and salvation he became uncomfortably aware that the darkness that he was using for concealment might also hide his killer. They relied on darkness to gain access to their victim and now he might actually have played right into their blood stained hands. A terrifying chill ran through him as he understood what he might have inadvertently done.</p><p>
  <em>‘What in the name of Merlin was I thinking?’</em>
</p><p>He was about to leave the shadows in which he was hiding when he realized that by stepping out of them he would reveal himself. There was no way around it, either way that he chose held the potential for disaster. He could die no matter what decision he made and this was not a pleasant prospect.</p><p>Taking in a deep breath, which seemed to him to be as loud as a clap of thunder, he left the shadows and hurried towards his objective. He faltered for a moment as he heard a whisper of a sound to his left but did not bother to look in that direction.</p><p>What he might see if he looked that way frightened him.</p><p>Nothing appeared to molest him or hinder his progress and he knew that only a few meters lay between him and the wooden barrier. If he could get there, open the door and then find what he was looking for he had at least a chance of surviving this night.</p><p>The wand, his father’s wand, lay safely cushioned inside the box that it had been in when it had been purchased from Ollivander’s so many years ago. While he would have preferred his own hemlock wand, his father’s walnut wand would do. He grimaced as he thought about the unpleasant response that the wand would give him for merely holding it. It would be even worse when he attempted to wield it. He could still see the scar in the palm of his hand that the wand had left some thirty years before when he had tried to use it.</p><p>The memory of the searing sensation was as indelibly seared into his mind as the physical reminder was present in his flesh.</p><p>The doorknob was finally in his hand and he jerked the door open to enter the space when he recoiled suddenly. The dark, draped form that waited within the cupboard advanced as he whirled to flee.</p><p>His heart raced faster as he saw a second figure moving to intercept him and the tinge of cold fear raced through him. Clearly they were herding him towards an area where there was no escape from. Once he was there they would, once he was outnumbered and cornered, have their way with him.</p><p>
  <em>‘The stairs, the servant’s stairs, I have to get to them!’</em>
</p><p>He pelted towards this one possibility of safety. The stairs, meant for the use of servants of a Muggle nature centuries before, had not been used in a very long time.</p><p>They were steep and winding and treacherous in the daytime, but to try to negotiate them in the darkness was madness or desperation or both. If one fell down them serious injury or death was likely as both had happened to unfortunates in the past. But considering what pursued him he felt that the risk was warranted.</p><p>As he ran, as fast as his aged legs could manage, he imagined that he felt the fetid breath of one of his antagonists on the back of his neck and did not dare to look behind him. A small table that stood along the wall was sent flying into the path of his enemies and he did not wait to hear any reaction from them. Only the crash of the table against the floor and the sound of glass shattering reached his ears as a vase which had been in his family for centuries met its end.</p><p>The stairs that he sought were close and he could only hope that the way was not blocked by one of them. Chills of terror flooded through him as he hurried through the darkness.</p><p><em>‘Perhaps,’</em> he thought,<em> ‘if I can get down the stairs safely I can get to my wand at the bottom of the main stairs.’</em></p><p>The railing at the top of the stairs appeared before him and he hurried to go around this barrier to begin his descent. He did not bother to look behind him because he knew what was there, because he was more concerned about what waited at the bottom and what he might find there. There was a door that was likely swollen with dampness, age and disuse. If it foiled his attempts to open it then all hope had fled him.</p><p>Almost halfway down the stairs he slipped and then began the dreaded head over heels tumble downward. Each step, each hard contact with the walls hurt more than the one before it and he had time to wonder if, when he reached the door, he would even be of use to those who pursued him.</p><p>He hoped not, for those who were after him had terrible ways of getting what they wanted.</p><p>A loud sound of impact occurred as he hit the door and actually burst THROUGH it. Somehow he managed to come to his feet and senses in time to flee the figures that were coming through the door as well. He grimaced as he cradled his obviously broken arm, the arm that he normally wielded his wand with.</p><p>Still, he hoped, he would be able to reach the wand that he had dropped earlier and somewhat even the odds against him. They were toying with him; he knew that for a fact, because they had passed up several chances to finish him. It had become a cat and mouse game with him playing the part of an unfortunate rodent. As grateful as he was for this fact, the fact that he still lived, he knew that sooner or later they would tire of this amusement and put a terrible end to him.</p><p>As he passed it he reached out to topple a large, freestanding bookshelf. It crashed to the floor with tremendous noise and he held out a feeble hope that he had at least stopped one of them. It was not likely but at least he had this to cheer him.</p><p>He rounded the corner and came into the main hall where the foot of the main staircase was. Now, if he could only find his wand. There had been no time to visually track it as it fell and the fact that it was extremely dark in the house had not helped.</p><p>As he entered the foyer his heart nearly came to a stop. This was both from excitement and fear at what he saw.</p><p>His wand lay delicately balanced on the newel post at the bottom of the bannister. He knew that it had not landed there by chance. It had been deliberately placed there.</p><p>A low laughter brought chills to his spine and then the voice finished the job of ending his hopes.</p><p>“It is right there, Jonas! You want your wand, don’t you? I mean, you have taken my associates on a wild game of hide and seek around your home so do you not want to play some more?”</p><p>It<em> was</em> there, right there in front of him and within easy reach if he took only a few more steps, but could he use it in time to defeat his adversaries and save his life.</p><p>“Well, Jonas, we are all waiting! Go ahead, Jonas, go ahead, leap forward, take your wand and try to carry out the plan that I know must be forming in your mind. Go ahead we will not try to stop you!”</p><p>The tone in the voice mocked him and also set his hair on end. There was no way to get the wand into his hand and survive the night. He might get the wand into his grasp but they would all surge forward at once. There was no a shadow of a doubt that he might get at least one of them but he could not defeat all of them.</p><p>An insane plan, insane for it meant his own death as well, entered his mind and he wondered if the owner of the taunting voice had considered what he was thinking. Surely he could have it in his possession long enough to do as he planned because he had no other course of action available. He was encircled by them and they waited only for the command of their leader to attack. Perhaps, if he was successful, he could destroy this evil and rid the Wizarding World of it once and for all.</p><p>“Come now, Jonas, please do not keep them waiting. They are such useful and patient servants but that patience lasts only so long. I am afraid that sooner or later they will decide to ignore what I have instructed them to do and do what they wish to do. We would not want that, now would we?”</p><p>This final plea, thick with sarcasm, was all that he needed. He, like the others, many of who had been his lifelong friends, had been targeted for this and he knew why. The person who was speaking to him, would never forget or forgive the long, lonely years spent in a cell in Azkaban Prison.</p><p>Wishing his remaining friends a silent goodbye, he leapt forward for the wand. His good hand closed around the wood and, as he pulled it to his chest to carry out his plan two things happened.</p><p>The first was that his pursuers rushed forward to seize him in their deadly grasps. The other thing was the he realized that he did not hold his wand. The thin piece of wood that he held so tightly was not a wand at all. It was merely a piece of wooded trim torn from somewhere in his home and then left there to deceive him.</p><p>As the screams echoed through his home a hand held up his true wand before his pain filled eyes so that he could see it. Helpless to act he could only watch as that hand’s mate grasped the other end of the wand and then the wand was snapped in half before being tucked into a pocket.</p><p>“Take all of the time that you want with him!”</p><p>The POP of disapparation sounded in the foyer.</p><p>The remainder of his life, only minutes actually, dragged on like hours and the faint spark of his consciousness that he still possessed managed to feel the tear that departed his left eye to make its way down his cheek.</p><p>When his attackers left his home the only sound that remained at all was the slow ticking of the large clock in his library. The time that it kept, like all time, gave this mortal passing not thought at all.</p><p>It had other lives to measure.</p>
