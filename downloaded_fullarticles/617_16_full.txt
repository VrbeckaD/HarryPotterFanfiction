    <p>It was Harry's last month with the Dursley's and, to be honest, he didn't really mind as much. He knew he'd be saying goodbye to them soon and so he was constantly filled with excitement. Nothing they said or did truly brought him down. </p>
<p>When he got back from Diagon Alley with Hagrid, they were all wound up and annoyed with him. Uncle Vernon was red faced with anger and yelling at him, telling him to throw away his stupid bird or he'd cook it, of all things. She squealed angrily at him. </p>
<p>Aunt Petunia obviously knew that this would be the situation as she didn't look surprised by the owl at all. She just rolled her eyes and scoffed. It wasn't until Harry impulsively decided to bring out his wand and threaten to use a spell on uncle Vernon that her eyes went wide. </p>
<p>"Just put that down, right now." She warned. "You know you can't use magic outside of school." </p>
<p>"That still won't stop me from turning you into a shoe." Harry glared hatefully at uncle Vernon, who was slowly backing up in fear.</p>
<p>"You don't know any spells, at all." Uncle Vernon grinned at him.</p>
<p>Harry decided to bluff. "Of course I do. I'm a wizard, I was born to know spells. They're all here in my head." He glared. Uncle Vernon seemed to believe him because he just gulped. </p>
<p>"What do you want from us?" Aunt Petunia snapped at him. "Do you want us to bend to your every command?" </p>
<p><i>’Well, as nice as that would be, considering it would be fitting revenge, I'm not that kind of person.'</i> Harry thought to himself.</p>
<p>"No. I want you to leave me alone, I'm going to school and that's final." He said, putting his foot down. "I want you to leave my owl alone and don't go through my things or I will use a spell on you." Again, he was bluffing. He didn't want to get expelled before he even got there, but the fear on their stupid faces was worth it.</p>
<p>"Fine." Aunt Petunia snapped. "Anything else?" She asked sarcastically.</p>
<p>"Yes." He grinned at her shocked face. "I want out of the cupboard. I can’t stay in there anymore, it's too cramped and it smells bad. Plus, my owl and trunk have nowhere to go." </p>
<p>Aunt Petunia looked to uncle Vernon for a second before they both reluctantly nodded. "Fine then, you can have Dudley's spare room."</p>
<p>"But, mummy!" Dudley whines from where he was standing off to the side, listening in. "I need that room for all my stuff." </p>
<p>"Well, clearly Harry here needs it more." She scoffed. </p>
<p>Harry just glared at her and walked away upstairs, ignoring Dudley's irritated cries. He stormed into the spare bedroom and winced at the smell. He sighed and decided it was better than downstairs. He'd move some stuff around and spray it with an entire bottle of air freshener by the end of the night and then he could relax, get tucked up into an actual bed which was in the corner and ride out the awful storm that was coming. </p>
<p>He shoved Dudley's toys and old birthday presents that he's broken into the cupboard and drawers, moved the rest into the corners and kicked some stuff under the bed. Then he went downstairs to get the air freshener and did as he promised he would. Sprayed it everywhere, starting with the bed. Then he moved onto the floor, inside the cupboard, the walls, cabinets and curtains on the windows.</p>
<p>By the time he'd finished, the place smelled relatively nice and he decided he could manage it in here. </p>
<p>He threw the bottle away and went downstairs to the cupboard to fetch his last vial of potion he'd need for tonight. He hid it under his pillow and sat back on the bed, trying to relax, rubbing his tired eyes.</p>
<p>Once he'd caught his breath, he decided to open his trunk up and look through some of his books. He found some potions books and looked through the ingredients. They all had fancy names like aconite and boomslang skin. </p>
<p>He didn't know what that was but he kept reading it all until he started to figure some of it out, with a smile on his face. </p>
<p>He didn't know if he'd be any good at potions but he just figured he'd pick it up as he practiced. Practise makes perfect, as they say.</p>
<p><i>'Now that I think about it, it's a little bit like cooking. The cauldron is the pot and then you have the ingredients. I might be good at it, after all.'</i> He thought happily. </p>
<p>He found History of Magic and decided to try and educate himself a little bit on this. He didn't want to go into the wizarding world and school not knowing anything. It would be an embarrassment, plus he might say something offensive and have no idea.</p>
<p>It mentions Hogwarts houses at school and their founders, which he already heard a little bit about from Hagrid. He was still a little bit upset at his prejudice against this Slytherin House. After all, it talks about ambition and cleverness. That's something that should definitely be appreciated in school children. </p>
<p>But because of stigma around it, that makes people hate it, which is so stupid, Harry thinks. It does not make you evil because some bad people came from a house. You're evil because you choose to be evil, that's all. </p>
<p>These people just so happen to come from this house, that's all. Nothing more or less. </p>
<p>He bets there's tons of other witches and wizards that have came from other houses, too, but people just don't talk about it or don't know about it. He rolls his eyes at all these dramatics.</p>
<p>What if he gets placed into Slytherin House? Will that make people hate him? Oh well, it's not like he cares. He's already hated enough in the world, what's a few more people? He shakes his head and sighs. Whatever. </p>
<p>He continued reading the book until it talks about magical creatures. This makes him sit up straighter. It doesn't give too much detail but it just gives a slight description of each magical being that exists in their world, like what Dumbledore told him. Although he did say he'll learn more about it in a couple of years. </p>
<p>It talks about unicorns and how they're sacred beings, giants and how people fear them. <i>’I really do wonder if Hagrid is a giant. If he is, there's nothing to be scared of.'</i> It talks about vampires and how they hide in forests away from civilians, only coming out to drink blood. They're pretty unsociable. It talks about centaurs, half humans and half horse like creatures who can read the stars. And then it talks about werewolves, people who transform into wolf like states once a month under the full moon without any control, unless they take Wolfsbane Potion. </p>
<p>Well, he's definitely educated on that part. He continues reading the book, anyway. </p>
<p>It talks about stuff to do with blood status and offensive terms. He makes a mental note of what not to call someone, a horrible word that starts with 'm'. Did people call his mother words like that? He hopes not! </p>
<p>When he was skimming over some pages, he came across the name Hedwig and decided that would be a pretty good name for his owl. There was just something pretty about it.</p>
<p>"Do you like that name, girl?" He asked her with a raised eyebrow.</p>
<p>She tilted her head then nodded, cooing softly. She then tucked her head into her wing and went to sleep. Harry smiled at her. </p>
<p>He read the book, keeping an eye out on the sky through the open window, which was now beginning to darken and decided to take his potion now that he felt his bones and muscles begin to throb. He chugged it back and grimaced, dumping the vial into the bin beside the bed. </p>
<p>He put his books back into his trunk and shut the blinds, the moonlight was beginning to appear through some clouds and it was making his skin itch when the light touched him. </p>
<p>He wrapped the blankets around himself and shuddered in pain, trembles beginning to wrack through his body. He bit down on his pillow hard and started taking deep breaths to calm himself down. His skin felt like it was going to split open and his nails dug into his palms making them bleed. He bit into his cheeks and tongue, mouth filling with blood which he swallowed regrettably, and tears filled his eyes. His belly and chest hurt, it was painful to breath.</p>
<p>He got the fear that he was actually going to change back into the wolf like state he faintly remembers from last time, the horrible pain of his clothes tearing away and then hearing his growl and howling. But he still stayed in bed. </p>
<p>He supposed the potion really was working in stopping him from changing but that doesn't stop the pain. He started crying into the pillow, he seriously thought his back was going to break and his internal organs were going to burst. He thought his brain was going to turn to mush and dribble out his nose and ears and  his eyeballs were going to explode. </p>
<p>He wanted it all to end. He wanted to die. </p>
<p>The worst part of it was that it went on for <i>hours.</i> He tried to go to sleep, tried to forget about it if he was unconscious. But sleep never came. Every time he closed his eyes, they'd shoot open as another wave of pain wracked through his body making him writhe. He was clawing at his arms and leaving cuts that he just knew would scar horribly. Well, that's what long sleeves are for. </p>
<p>His body didn't even have the courtesy of letting him pass out. He stayed fully conscious the entire bloody night. It was unbearable. He never wants to go through this again. But he knows he'll have to, for the rest of his life. This time next month it'll be the same thing again. Why can't he just catch a break?</p>
<p>Eventually, after several hours of writhing and crying and bleeding and pain, he felt himself pass out, only when he looked out the window and saw the sky begin to lighten. Must be the sun rising then. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>When he woke up later that day, he didn't know what time it was. Only that he was the most exhausted he'd ever been in his entire life. And that's saying something. </p>
<p>His whole body hurt and when he looked down at himself, he was covered in scratches. </p>
<p>He remembers it all, though. He wishes he didn't, that was horrific. But he remembers every last detail. He stands up slowly and sees Hedwig glancing at him worriedly. He goes over to her and lets her out her cage, giving her some food and stroking her feathers. She gently nips at his fingers and coos at him. </p>
<p>"I'm alright, girl. I promise." He smiles. She eyes him before giving a nod. </p>
<p>He opens the window and she goes flying out, stretching her wings and going for a hunt.</p>
<p>He quietly heads for the bathroom to get cleaned up and takes a quick shower, surprised to find the house so quiet. </p>
<p>When he finally gets dressed, he heads downstairs and sees aunt Petunia and Dudley enjoying each other's company, sitting watching tv together. He looks at the time on the clock in the living room and it reads three thirty pm. </p>
<p><i>'Whoa! I slept right in...'</i> Harry thought to himself with wide eyes.</p>
<p>He doesn’t let them know he’s here, he doesn’t want to deal with them, so he heads to the kitchen and makes himself some toast, rebelliously deciding to steal some of Dudley’s strawberry jam. He sighs as the hunger pains go away and drinks a giant glass of water with some painkillers he stole from the cupboard. </p>
<p>He then heads back upstairs and decides to stay out the way. He now has his own place he can properly sit and rest, he has his own belongings to keep himself occupied. He just wants to lay back in bed and feel better. So, that’s what he does. </p>
<p>He collapses on the bed, shuts his eyes and immediately falls straight back to sleep.</p><hr/>
<p>As the month went by, he started to feel a little better. The only thing that truly kept his spirits up was the fact that he knew he’d be going to Hogwarts soon. </p>
<p>He grinned mischievously every time aunt Petunia caught his eye and she scoffed, storming off. </p>
<p>Both Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon decided to leave him alone, obviously realising he wasn't worth the bother. He was thankful for that.</p>
<p>Dudley also stayed clear of him, only glaring at him or banging into his shoulder before quickly taking off to another room. Prat.</p>
<p>He was actually quite lucky that they never came into his room, otherwise they'd see all the dead mice that Hedwig kept bringing in. He kept having to throw them out the window with a cringe.</p>
<p>He just kept to himself for a few weeks, only coming downstairs when necessary. He had plenty to entertain himself with. </p><hr/>
<p>Harry was reading a transfiguration book when Dudley ran past his room and slammed on the door. </p>
<p>“Go answer the door, cousin! I’m going in a bubble bath.” He yelled childishly.</p>
<p>Harry scoffed and got up, heading downstairs to see who was there. He was rubbing at his tired eyes. It was just the mail as usual, so he picked it up and threw aunt Petunia’s rubbish on the dining room table where she’d find it and noticed another letter with his name on it.</p>
<p>He raised his eyebrows and opened it. Inside, yet again, he received another three vials of the Wolfsbane Potion. He sighed with relief. He expected it to come. If it didn’t, he wouldn’t know what to do...</p>
<p>He’d mail Hagrid, probably.</p>
<p>There was also a note inside. It had no name or signature but it was clearly addressed to him. </p>
<p>
  <i></i>
</p>
<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <i>Mr. Potter,</i>
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>Drink up. I understand that it must taste horrible, yet you should be fully aware of that by now</i>
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>Do not forget, unless you want everyone to see your furry little problem. I assume you know the rules. But in case you don’t, I shall repeat them to you</i>
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>Take one vial a day, for three days, counting up to the moon. Not that difficult a concept, I’m sure your pre adolescent brain can understand</i>
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>Good luck</i>
  </p>
</blockquote><p>What the heck? Who was this? They were so rude. A little funny, though, he must admit. But that could be because he grew up with the Dursley’s so he’s developed a dark sense of humour. </p>
<p>This person was clearly trying to sound hostile, as if they didn’t like him very much, and to be honest, it kind of offended him considering he didn’t even know who it was. But the “furry little problem” comment had him snorting, he’s not going to lie. He’ll have to remember that one. </p>
<p>Whoever thought that would be an insult was clearly mistaken.</p>
<p>He grinned and shook his head, crumpling up the paper and tossing it in the bin. He then took the vials upstairs to his room and hid them under his pillow, saving one of them for tonight.</p>
<p>It seemed as if the month went by so quickly, but that’s just because he was constantly on his feet, jumping around with excitement. These next three days will be hell but he’ll deal with it just like he did last time. Then he’ll be able to fix himself up and finally head off to Hogwarts! </p>
<p>Thank God the full moon night didn’t fall exactly on the day he was supposed to go. That would have been the worst. It’s a couple days before, and he’ll surely look rubbish but he doesn’t care about that.</p>
<p>It was late at night and Harry did his usual routine, chugged the vial back, cringed and went to bed. This was how it went on for the next couple of days. </p>
<p>He was of course, in pain, tears and covered in blood. But once it was over, he simply got up, washed himself off, took some pain medicine, ate breakfast, hydrated, and held his head up high. </p>
<p>Once he mustered up enough energy, he went up to uncle Vernon who was lounging about on the sofa watching tv. </p>
<p>“I need you to drop me off at the train station tomorrow.” Harry said bluntly. Seeing his eyebrows raise, he continued. “King’s Cross, tomorrow morning. I can’t miss my train.” </p>
<p>Uncle Vernon eyed him before grunting. “Fine...” he mumbled, obviously still wary of him using magic on him. “But don’t you talk to me about magic carpets or anything like that!”</p>
<p>Harry smiled sarcastically. “Of course not, uncle Vernon.” He walked back to his room to put all his things back together in his trunk, making sure not to leave anything behind. </p>
<p>He made sure to go to bed extra early that night, both exhausted from the past few days of his stupid transformation episodes and wanting to catch up on sleep, plus he wanted to make sure he’d wake up super early in the morning. </p>
<p>He set an alarm for five am and woke up, jumping out of bed, grinning. He ran downstairs after getting himself ready and made himself a decent breakfast for once. He didn’t care about getting in trouble by the Dursley’s. It’s not like they could ground him or anything, he wouldn’t be here.</p>
<p>After a couple of hours, they finally woke up and Harry pestered uncle Vernon to hurry up, wanting to get to the platform as quickly as possible. </p>
<p>He eventually relented with a glare, saying how he wanted the little tyke out of their way already, because he was being a menace. </p>
<p>He drove him to the train station and they both looked around. </p>
<p>“What are we looking for, boy?” uncle Vernon’s grumpy voice spoke up.</p>
<p>“It says here I’ve to look for platform nine and three quarters. What does that mean?” Harry asked with raised eyebrows.</p>
<p>Uncle Vernon smirked at Harry. “Well, take a look around. There’s platform nine, there’s platform ten.” He pointed to them. “It doesn’t look like they’ve built your magical one yet, does it?” </p>
<p>“But-“ Harry was cut short by uncle Vernon’s loud laugh as he took off towards his car, driving off and leaving Harry there, gaping at him. Well, what to do now? Harry sighed and went up to a guard who was standing nearby and asked him about platform nine and three quarters, but he just laughed at him. “Well, what about the train that leaves at eleven?”</p>
<p>“There is none.” The man rolled his eyes and walked off. “Bloody time waster...” he mumbled rudely under his breath.</p>
<p>Harry didn’t know what to do. He wasn’t given any other instructions. Does he write to Hagrid? People were now starting to look at him funny, considering he’s standing in the middle of a train station with a trunk and an owl. </p>
<p>He shifted nervously on the spot until his ears picked up a distant voice. </p>
<p>“This place is packed with muggles.” A woman’s voice spoke.</p>
<p>Harry’s eyes went wide, <i>muggles.</i> That’s a wizard term. She must be one, he has to follow her, she’ll know something. He looks around and spots her off to a wall, standing with a bunch of kids, all with red hair like hers. </p>
<p>They’re talking to a little girl named Ginny who apparently wants to go somewhere but isn’t old enough. Where does she want to go?</p>
<p>“Percy, you go first.” Harry watched intently to see what was going on when suddenly his eyes went wide. The boy ran full speed at the wall but instead of slamming into it, he ran through it. Nobody else around them seemed to notice, either.</p>
<p>“Fred, you next.” The woman told a tall looking boy. </p>
<p>“I’m not Fred, I’m George!” </p>
<p>Another boy who was his double, spoke up. “Honestly woman, you call yourself our mother?” He shook his head.</p>
<p>The woman looked sad. “Oh, I’m sorry George.” </p>
<p>Suddenly the boy grinned at her and ran at the wall, disappearing. “Only kidding, I am Fred!” </p>
<p>She scoffed and glared at him. Then his twin, who must be the real George, grinned at her and ran after him through the wall. </p>
<p>Harry was staring in shock the entire time. How were they doing that?</p>
<p>He shook himself out of his thoughts and went up to her. “Excuse me? How did you-“ He pointed to the wall.</p>
<p>She smiled at him sweetly. “First time at Hogwarts, dear?” Seeing his nod, she looked to the boy standing next to her. “It’s Ron’s first time going, too.” The boy smiled at him and Harry nervously smiled back. They seemed friendly enough, he supposed. “You want to know how to get onto the platform?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I’ve never done it before.” Harry said awkwardly.</p>
<p>“Not to worry.” She told him with a smile. “All you have to do is walk straight at the barrier between platforms nine and ten. Don't stop and don't be scared you'll crash into it, that's very important. Best do it at a bit of a run if you’re nervous.” She nodded to him. “Go on, don’t be shy.”</p>
<p>Harry took in a deep breath and looked at the wall. It looked very solid, but seeing everyone else do it, he had faith that he would go through it instead of cracking his head open. </p>
<p>He ran as fast as he could with his eyes closed and when he opened them, he was standing on another platform surrounded by a bunch of people. They were wearing robes and colourful jumpers with stripes on them, holding brooms, some people had animals like cats or birds like him, all the kids had trunks too, and the most noticeable thing was the gigantic red steam train.</p>
<p>He grinned widely and walked around people, heading for the train. When he got onboard, he looked for an empty compartment. He overheard snippets of conversations from lots of people. </p>
<p>There was a boy hanging out a window looking upset. “Gran, I’ve lost my toad again.”</p>
<p>An old woman who was talking to him from outside sighed. “Oh dear, Neville.” She shook her head.</p>
<p>Harry just walked on. </p>
<p>There was a kid with dreadlocks who was gathering a crowd. “Look what I have!”</p>
<p>“Let us see, Lee!” People we’re asking excitedly.</p>
<p>The kid was holding a giant hairy tarantula in his hands. Surely that wasn’t on the approved list for Hogwarts animals. </p>
<p>He shuddered and continued walking.</p>
<p>He finally found an empty compartment and sighed. He tried to put away his cage and trunk but couldn’t reach the shelves above the doors, dropping the trunk on his foot. “Ow!” He winced.</p>
<p>Suddenly, two pairs of feet were in front of him. “Want a hand?” A familiar voice spoke up. It was one of the twins.</p>
<p>“Yes, thanks.” He said relieved.</p>
<p>The guy smiled and yelled. “Oi, Fred! Come here and help!” So this must be George. The other twin came over and they both took the trunk and cage from him, putting it away. He smiled thankfully.</p>
<p>“What’s that?” One of the twins who’s name he’s now forgotten spoke up, pointing to the scar on his forehead.</p>
<p>“Blimey! No way.” The other twin gasped. “Are you-“ </p>
<p>“He is.” The other twin finished for him. “Aren’t you?” </p>
<p>“You’re Harry Potter.” The other one grinned. </p>
<p>Harry turned bright red and just nodded. </p>
<p>The boys both looked to each other and smirked. “Well, nice to meet you.” They chorused and took off. </p>
<p><i>‘They’re kinda weird... but that’s not so bad.’</i> He thought funnily to himself.</p>
<p>When he looked back out the window, he saw the Ron boy getting fussed over by his mum who kept wiping at his nose with a tissue. “Stay still, Ron! There’s something on your nose.” </p>
<p>“Gerroff!” Ron growled and Harry couldn’t help but snort.</p>
<p>He saw the twins suddenly appear and start to mock him. </p>
<p>“Aw, has little ickle Ronniekins got something on his nosie?” One of the twins asked and Ron went beet red.</p>
<p>“Shut up!” He snapped.</p>
<p>Suddenly one of the boys from before came up to them. He was now dressed in fancy robes which had a shiny pin on them. </p>
<p>“Percy, there you are.” Their mum exclaimed relieved. </p>
<p>“I can’t stay long, mother. I have to go be with the other prefects. We have compartments to ourselves.” Percy said smugly.</p>
<p>One of the twins acted shocked. “Oh my goodness, are you a prefect, Percy? You should have told us!” </p>
<p>“Wait, I think I remember him saying something about it. Maybe once-“</p>
<p>“Or twice-“</p>
<p>“A minute-“</p>
<p>“All summer-“</p>
<p>“Just shut up, both of you!” Percy snapped at the twins. </p>
<p>Their mother just rolled her eyes, obviously used to this behaviour. “On you go dear, have a good term.” Once he left, she turned on the twins. “Now, you two behave! I don’t want any letters home saying you’ve blown up toilets or something.”</p>
<p>“We’ve never blown up a toilet.” One of the twins said shocked.</p>
<p>“Great idea though, thanks mum.” The other one grinned.</p>
<p>Harry let out a snort hearing this. Heaven help him if he ends up in the same house as them and has to see them every day.</p>
<p>“Not funny.” She glared. “Look after Ron.” </p>
<p>“Don’t worry. Ickle Ronniekins is safe with us.” They both smirked as he went pale.</p>
<p>“Hey mum, guess what?” The other twin suddenly spoke up with a grin. “You know that boy who was on the platform? You’ll never guess who it was.” </p>
<p>Seeing her eyebrow raise, both boys chorused excitedly. “Harry Potter!”</p>
<p>Harry’s eyes went wide from where he was sitting. He didn’t like people talking about him, good thing he has super sensitive hearing now. He’ll be able to find out whoever’s talking about him behind his back. He listened in carefully.</p>
<p>“Are you sure?” The woman asked with wide eyes.</p>
<p>“Yup. We saw his scar, it was in the same shape of lightening like people said it would be.” One of the twins spoke up enthusiastically. “Although he does have a bunch of other scars on his face. What’s that from?” </p>
<p>“Enough of that!” The woman scolded. “That boy isn’t something you should be staring at like he belongs in a zoo, he’s just a boy.” She snapped, defending him. Harry was grateful for that. “The poor thing, no wonder he was alone, I wondered. He was ever so polite when he asked how to get onto the platform.”</p>
<p>“Never mind that, do you think he remembers what You-Know-Who looks like?" One of the twins asked with raised eyebrows.</p>
<p>Harry gulped nervously.</p>
<p>Their mother suddenly became very stern. </p>
<p>"I forbid you to ask him, Fred.” She snapped. “Don't you dare think about it. As though he needs reminding of that on his first day at school.”</p>
<p>"All right, it was just a question.” Fred spoke up.</p>
<p>“One you won’t ask.” She glared. Fred just nodded.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a whistle sounded. </p>
<p>She told the three of them to quickly get on the train after hugging them goodbye. After about a minute, there was a massive jerk. The train started moving slowly at first before picking up speed, driving by houses and buildings, leaving behind everything. Harry’s stomach was swooshing excitedly.</p>
<p>He was rubbing at his still tired eyes when the compartment door slid open and the boy named Ron stood there nervously.</p>
<p>“Hi, can I sit here? Everywhere else is full.” He asked.</p>
<p>“Sure, go ahead.” Harry shrugged and he jumped into the seat across from him. He pretended he didn’t notice the red haired boy quickly glancing at his forehead every now and then.</p>
<p>There was a laugh from the doorway. “Hey Ronniekins.” One of the twins from before spoke up.</p>
<p>“Lee Jordan has a giant spider and we’re gonna go see it, want to come?” The other one asked with a grin.</p>
<p>“You know I don’t!” Ron snapped and gave a shudder. </p>
<p>The twins giggled to themselves and turned to Harry. </p>
<p>“Harry, we didn’t properly introduce ourselves earlier, did we? Fred and George Weasley.” They smiled. “And this is our little brother Ron.”</p>
<p>“See you round, then.” The other spoke up and they both left.</p>
<p>After a minute of silence, the boy across from him cleared his throat and decided to speak. “Are you really Harry Potter?”</p>
<p>Harry just nodded.</p>
<p>“Oh. I thought it might be one of Fred and George's jokes.” Ron mumbled. “And have you really got the... you know..." he asked, looking towards his forehead.</p>
<p>Harry just sighed and lifted up his fringe covering the scar. Ron stared, mouth agape.</p>
<p>"So that's where You-Know-Who...” he trailed off.</p>
<p>"Yes," said Harry, "but I can't remember it.” </p>
<p>"Nothing?" said Ron eagerly.</p>
<p>"Well, I remember a lot of green light and then nothing.” Harry shrugged. “Like in my dreams sometimes. But that’s only happened a few times.” He tried to act casual, he doesn’t like talking about things like this.</p>
<p>“Oh.” Ron mumbled. </p>
<p>“Are all your family wizards?” Harry asked as to not have any awkward silence.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I believe so.” Ron said with a thoughtful expression. </p>
<p>“So you must know loads of magic already then.” Harry raised an eyebrow.</p>
<p>“My mum and dad do. My dad loves muggle things. You lived with muggles, right?” Ron asked. “What are they like?”</p>
<p>Harry cringed. “Horrible.” Ron gaped. “Well, not all of them. But my aunt, uncle and cousin are. I wish I had three wizard brothers.”</p>
<p>“Five.” Ron said gloomily. “I’m the sixth in my family. And then there’s Ginny, my little sister. I feel like I have loads to live up to.” He sighed. </p>
<p>Harry just smiled sympathetically at him. Suddenly he heard a squeak. “What’s that?” He said, looking around.</p>
<p>Ron reached into his pocket and pulled out a grey rat which <i>stank.</i> “This is Scabbers, he’s the family pet. He’s completely useless and doesn’t wake up unless it’s to eat.” </p>
<p>Harry pinched his nose and turned his head away. Stupid nose, picking things up. He doesn’t want to seem rude, but this rat just smells so bad. “When do you give him baths?”</p>
<p>“Uh...” Ron’s ears went pink. “We assume he cleans himself. Like cats.” Seeing Harry cringe, he nods. “I’ll be sure to give him a bath.” </p>
<p>Harry nodded, thankfully.</p>
<p>Ron gave Scabbers some pieces of food which he had in his pockets and put him back, then the stupid thing went back to sleep. Thank God.</p>
<p>The boys continued to talk about all different kinds of things, like what it was like growing up in different worlds.</p>
<p>Harry told Ron about what it was like growing up in the muggle world, not knowing about magic.</p>
<p>“I didn’t even know I was a wizard until recently.” Harry said seriously. Ron looked shocked. “My aunt Petunia wasn’t happy when she knew I’d found out. Then Dumbledore and Hagrid has to come and explain so much to me.” He laughed, leaving out <i>certain</i> parts. “It was mental.” </p>
<p>“It sounds like it.” Ron giggled. </p>
<p>“I didn’t even know about my parents or Voldemort.” Harry shrugged.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Ron gasped. “You said You-Know-Who’s name!” </p>
<p>“So?” Harry raised an eyebrow.</p>
<p>“I just thought... out of all the people, you wouldn’t want to, because of, well...” He stammered. </p>
<p>“It’s just a name, Ron. It can’t hurt me. And I’m not scared of this man.” He said seriously.</p>
<p>“Okay, good. I wouldn’t want you to be.” Ron smiled. “Does the scar hurt?” He asked nervously.</p>
<p>“No, it’s just ugly.” Harry shrugged. “Like the rest.” He mumbled, pointing to his face.</p>
<p>“That’s not true. I mean, I don’t know what happened but it’s not ugly.” Ron said suportively . “You look like you’ve been in battle like a soldier!” He grinned.</p>
<p>Harry laughed. “Thanks, I suppose. But it’s not that cool.” He sighed. “I was just attacked by a stupid dog.” He bluffed again. If he had to go with something, he’d always go with that. He likes Ron, they could be good friends. But he doesn’t want to scare him away by telling him what he is.</p>
<p>Ron just smiled sympathetically at him. Harry appreciated it.</p>
<p>Eventually conversation switched up to classes. </p>
<p>“What classes do you think you’ll be good at?” Ron asked.</p>
<p>“Well, I read up on a bunch of books before coming here. I think I’ll be good at potions, who knows.” Harry shrugged. </p>
<p>Ron raised his eyebrows. “Really?”</p>
<p>“Yeah.” He said with some confidence. “I’m good at cooking considering I did it all the time for my relatives, and potion making seems as if it’s a little bit like cooking.” He said with a grin. “So, I might not suck.” </p>
<p>Ron just snorted at him.</p>
<p>Soon enough, when they were way out of London and saw some sheep and cows in fields, a lady with a trolley came by. “Anything from the trolley, dears?” She asked with a smile.</p>
<p>Ron just held up a squashed sandwich and shook his head. “I’m all set, thanks.” He looked and sounded miserable.</p>
<p>Harry took pity on him, he’s been there. He got out the money he had in his pocket and grinned at the lady. “We’ll take as much as we can pay for.” She looked shocked for a second before laughing. </p>
<p>She handed him over a whole bunch of sweets of different kinds, sitting them on the chair next to him. He thanked her and she left. He then told Ron to dig in.</p>
<p>“Wait, you did that for me?” He asked with raised eyebrows.</p>
<p>“Of course I did. You’re my friend.” He said with a smile, then halted. Were they? Was he being too forward? “I mean, that’s if-“</p>
<p>“Friends!” Ron stuck his hand out with a smile and Harry let out a relieved breath, shaking his hand. His first human friend. Not counting the serpent one back in Surrey. </p>
<p>They both laughed as they got the giggles from eating too much sugar. </p>
<p>Harry picked up something he saw someone in the Leaky Cauldron eating when he was there with Hagrid, a weird looking frog.</p>
<p>“Ron, what is this?” He asked confused.</p>
<p>“Those are chocolate frogs.” He grinned. Harry grimaced and put it down, scooting far away from it. Ron laughed. “They’re not real frogs, Harry. It’s just chocolate that’s charmed to move like that.”</p>
<p>Harry nodded, acting as if that was what’s bothering him when actually it was the chocolate itself. <i>‘The smell is revolting.’</i> He holds in a gag. He notices the box has a card on the front though and quickly goes to snatch it up. </p>
<p>On the front of the card is a picture of Albus Dumbledore. The man who came to see him at his home. He’s smiling at him in the picture.</p>
<p>He flips the card over and on the back it reads,</p>

    <b>CURRENTLY HEADMASTER OF HOGWARTS</b>
  </p>
  <p>Considered by many the greatest wizard of modern times, Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon's blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel. Professor Dumbledore enjoys chamber music and tenpin bowling</p>
</center>Harry snorts and turns the card back over. He frowns, noticing that he’s gone from the picture.<p>“Where did he go?” He asks.</p>
<p>“He’s gone. You can’t expect him to stick around all day, can you?” Ron asked whilst munching on some pasties.</p>
<p>They took turns trying out some Bertie Bott’s Every Flavour Beans, sometimes smiling at a flavour and other times gagging.</p>
<p>“I swear, George reckon he ended up with a bogey flavoured one, once.” Ron grimaced. </p>
<p>The train took them into darkness, where there were forests and rivers. It was a spooky but beautiful sight.</p>
<p>Soon enough, there was a knock at their door. The boy that Harry saw earlier talking to his gran was standing there, tearful. </p>
<p>“Have either of you seen a toad, at all?” When they both shook their heads he wailed. “I’ve lost him! He keeps getting away from me.”</p>
<p>“He’ll show up.” Harry said, trying to sound supportive.</p>
<p>The boy nodded and walked off. </p>
<p>“I don’t know why he’s so upset over a toad, I’d try and lose it as quickly as possible.” Ron shrugged. He then glanced at Scabbers and placed him back on his lap gently. “But sometimes I wish I could get rid of this thing, too.” He cringed. “I tried turning him yellow yesterday but nothing happened, look.” He sighed. </p>
<p>He got out his wand and was about to cast a spell when the door opened again, a bushy haired girl entering. “Have either of you seen a toad? A boy named Neville’s lost one.” She asked in a bossy sort of voice.</p>
<p>“We already told him no.” Ron said and went back to his spell. He was interrupted by the girl, though.</p>
<p>“Are you doing magic? Let’s see, then.” She grinned and sat down. Ron looked shocked. </p>
<p>He turned back to Scabbers and raised his wand. </p>
<p>“Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow, turn this stupid, fat rat yellow.” He waved his wand but nothing happened.</p>
<p>He sighed in disappointment.</p>
<p>“Are you sure that's a real spell?" She said with a smirk. "Well, it's not very good, is it? I've tried a few simple spells just for practice and it's all worked for me. Nobody in my family's magic at all, it was ever such a surprise when I got my letter, but I was ever so pleased, of course, I mean, it's the very best school of witchcraft there is, I've heard.” She rambled on. “I've learned all our course books by heart, of course, I just hope it will be enough. I'm Hermione Granger, by the way, who are you?"</p>
<p>She spoke so quickly it was hard to keep up.</p>
<p>“I’m Ron Weasley.” Ron mumbled.</p>
<p>“Harry Potter.” Harry nodded.</p>
<p>“Are you really?" She asked with wide eyes. “I know all about you, of course. I got a few extra books, for background reading, and you're in Modern Magical History and The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts and Great Wizarding Events of the Twentieth Century.”</p>
<p>"Am I?" Harry asked with wide eyes.</p>
<p>"Goodness, didn't you know? I'd have found out everything I could if it was me.” She said. “Do either of you know what house you'll be in? I've been asking around, and I hope I'm in Gryffindor, it sounds by far the best. I hear Dumbledore himself was in it, but I suppose Ravenclaw wouldn't be too bad...” she said thoughtfully. “Anyway, we'd better go and look for Neville's toad. You two had better change, you know, I expect we'll be there soon.”</p>
<p>She walked off, leaving both boys gaping after her. </p>
<p>“I do not want to end up in a house with her.” Ron exclaimed loudly.</p>
<p>“Hmm.” Harry said absentmindedly. He didn’t want to make too many judgements, too quickly. </p>
<p>“Did you hear about Gringotts?” Ron spoke up with wide eyes.</p>
<p>“What?” </p>
<p>“Someone tried to rob a high security vault. It was all over the Daily Prophet.” Ron said shocked.</p>
<p>Harry’s eyes went wide. “What happened to them?”</p>
<p>“They haven’t been caught! That’s why it’s such big news.” Ron said fidgeting. “They say it must have been a really powerful dark wizard to pull something like this off, if you’re able to break into Gringotts. People freak out thinking it’s You-Know-Who.” </p>
<p>Harry sighed and decided to change topic of conversation. He didn’t like talking about Voldermort, he was a madman who doesn’t deserve his time or energy.</p>
<p>They started talking about quidditch, Ron going into deeper details of explaining the rules than Hagrid did and telling him about all the different teams. Harry actually thought it sounded interesting and decided he might find himself becoming a fan or player in the future. </p>
<p>Suddenly, there was yet another bang on the door. <i>‘Who is it now?’</i></p>
<p>Three boys stood there and Harry immediately recognised the skinny, pale, blonde one from Madam Malkin’s. He was looking Harry up and down with extreme interest.</p>
<p>“So it’s true?” He asked with a raised eyebrow. “They’re all saying on the train that Harry Potter has come to Hogwarts. It’s you, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“One and only.” Harry narrowed his eyes at him. He still didn’t like this boy.</p>
<p>“This is Crabbe and Goyle.” He gestured to his two bodyguards standing either side of him. “And I’m Malfoy. Draco Malfoy.” He said snootily. </p>
<p>Ron let out a cough which may have been to hide a chuckle but Malfoy clearly caught him. </p>
<p>“Think my name's funny, do you? No need to ask who you are. My father told me all the Weasleys have red hair, freckles, and more children than they can afford.” He spat at him. Then he turned back to Harry. "You'll soon find out some wizarding families are much better than others, Potter. You don't want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there.” He said, holding out his hand.</p>
<p>Harry looked down at his hand and up into his eyes, glaring. “I think I can tell the wrong sort for myself, thanks.” </p>
<p>“I'd be careful if I were you, Potter.” Malfoy said bitterly. “Unless you're a bit politer, you'll go the same way as your parents. They didn't know what was good for them, either. You hang around with riffraff like the Weasleys and that Hagrid, and it'll rub off on you.” He smirked.</p>
<p>Both Harry and Ron stood up, furious.</p>
<p>"Say that again, Malfoy!” Ron yelled, his face as red as his hair. </p>
<p>"Oh, you're going to fight us, are you?" Malfoy sneered. </p>
<p>"Unless you get out now.” Harry growled, feeling the beginning sparks of anger starting to rise up in him. He was still recovering from his full moon night, he doesn’t need this. He didn’t care that Crabbe and Goyle were a lot bigger than him or Ron, he’d gladly tear them apart. </p>
<p>Calm down, deep breaths. </p>
<p>"But we don't feet like leaving, do we, boys?” Malfoy said cockily.</p>
<p>Harry cracked his neck and took deep breaths. This prat had to go or he’d put his head through a wall. “Get out, Malfoy.” He whispered dangerously. “Now.” He spat. </p>
<p>Something must have spooked him because Malfoy’s demeanour changed. He went from cocky aristocrat to scared kitty cat, backing up out of the compartment and down the hall, his bodyguards following him. </p>
<p>Ron slammed the door shut behind them and after a few seconds of silence, burst out laughing. </p>
<p>“That was bloody brilliant!”</p>
<p>“What?” Harry asked confused.  </p>
<p>“You nearly made Malfoy wet himself!” Ron grinned. “You got this, like, dangerous look in your eye and I seriously thought you were gonna jump on him.” Ron said, holding his chest dramatically. </p>
<p>“So did I.” Harry mumbled. He sat back down and rested his head against the window, taking calming breaths. Ron sat across from him and was still giggling, loving every second.</p>
<p>After five minutes, they decided to change into their school robes. Harry’s were brand new and clean where Ron’s looked like hand-me-downs and they were a little on the short side, as you could see his shoes. </p>
<p>Soon, they heard a voice above:</p>
<p>
  <i>“We will be reaching Hogwarts in five minutes time. Please leave your luggage on the train, it will be taken to the school separately.”</i>
</p>
<p>They shrugged and left their stuff, heading down the hallways and towards the doors when the train eventually stopped. Harry’s nerves were running wild, his stomach was churning. But Ron stayed by his side the entire time which made him happy.</p>
<p>They were on the platform outside, in the freezing cold, when suddenly he heard a familiar booming voice. </p>
<p>“Firs’ years! Firs’ years, over here! All right there, Harry!” Hagrid smiled at him, holding a lamp, big bushy beard flapping in the wind.</p>
<p>“Hi, Hagrid.” He smiled back, waving.</p>
<p>“C'mon, follow me, any more firs' years? Mind yer step, now! Firs' years follow me!"</p>
<p>Nearly slipping on their backsides, they followed Hagrid down what seemed to be a steep, narrow path. It was so dark, nobody could see anything. The only source of light was from the lamp Hagrid was carrying. Nobody spoke much. Neville, the boy who kept losing his toad, whimpered every now and again.</p>
<p>"Yeh'll get yer firs' sight o' Hogwarts in a sec!” Hagrid called over his shoulder. “Jus' round this bend here.” </p>
<p>Suddenly everyone gasped.</p>
<p>The path had finally opened onto the edge of the great black lake. Perched on top of a high mountain on the other side, the windows sparkling in the starry sky, towers pointing upwards, was a giant castle. Hogwarts. </p>
<p>"No more'n four to a boat!" Hagrid yelled out, pointing to all the little boats sitting in the water by the shore. Harry and Ron were followed into their boat by Neville and Hermione. </p>
<p>Ron rolled his eyes.</p>
<p>"Everyone in?" shouted Hagrid, who obviously had a boat to himself. Seeing everyone nod, he clapped his hands. “Right then. Forward!” </p>
<p>Suddenly, the boats starting moving towards the direction of the castle, everyone giggling and shrieking excitedly at what was going on.</p>
<p>They reached a cliff and Hagrid yelled at them to duck, so they wouldn’t crack their heads open. They all swam inside what looked like a tunnel which was taking them underneath the castle, everyone’s voices bouncing off the walls.</p>
<p>Eventually they got off the boats, everyone trying to steady themselves. </p>
<p>Hagrid then let out a loud yelp. “Oi, you there! Is this yer toad?” He pointed to the boy named Neville and back at the little toad who was laying on the pebbles, croaking happily. </p>
<p>“Trevor!” Neville yelled happily, running forward and grabbing him gently. “Where’ve you been?” </p>
<p>“He didn’ get very far, now did ‘e?” Hagrid said with a smile. “Nearly stepped on the wee bugger, mind ye.” Hagrid said with a frown. </p>
<p>“Well, thanks.” Neville said, putting Trevor in his pocket for safety. Hagrid nodded and led them indoors, where they took a bunch of different turns until they walked up a giant staircase, stopping outside a room. </p>
<p>“Everyone ‘ere?” He asked, looking around. He then turned towards the doors and knocked.</p>
