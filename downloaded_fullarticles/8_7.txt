    <p>Harry startled when Fawkes landed in his lap. “Hi there,” he said gently, running his hands down his majestic feathers.</p><p>Dumbledore chucked. “I’d be jealous of how much my familiar has taken to you, if I wasn’t just as impressed these past few months.”</p><p>“Thanks, Professor,” Harry said softly, touched.</p><p>“Albus, please, you know that I was never your Professor, as much as I resemble the man who was like a mentor to you,” Albus said, his ice-blue eyes sharp. “Now, have you given any more thought to my offer? I think you’d make a brilliant professor, and I've quite selfishly grown quite accustomed to your company.”</p><p>Harry nodded, staring at Fawkes instead of Albus, not wanting look him in the eyes. “Yes---and I don’t think it’s a good idea. The people who could be my parents and their friends in this universe should enjoy their final year at Hogwarts without me being a distraction to them, especially now that Voldemort’s gone.”</p><p>Albus sat up a little straighter in his armchair. “Do you know why I’ve stayed at Hogwarts, even on the rare occasion where I wanted to leave?”</p><p>Harry shook his head.</p><p>“Because after my father went to Azkaban, it was truly the only place that ever felt like home to me. I loved Hogwarts and it loved me, and I feel like you have the same true affection for the inside of this castle’s walls as I do,” Dumbledore said.</p><p>“It was my home too,” Harry confirmed, meeting his eyes.</p><p>“I can tell, you learn a thing or two after your first century,” Dumbledore said, winking at him. “Of course I'm here because Hogwarts is my home, but I'm also blessed that Ariana and Aberforth chose to set up The Hogs Head so close to here as well, I can be close to their complementary magic whenever I need it. That's helped me stay here for so long too.”</p><p>“Sir,” Harry said, instead of telling Dumbledore that Ariana was dead where he came from, he asked another question instead. “In my universe, I don’t think complementary magic is a thing.”</p><p>“No? It tends to run in families, muggleborns can find it with their dearest friends, romantic partners or if they decide to have them, their children. You’ve never felt you magic sing when you’re near another person?” Dumbledore asked, stroking his beard.</p><p>Harry thought of Ron and Hermione, but friendship was its own kind of magic. “I don’t think so.”</p><p>“It’s a gift,” Albus said. “And as we don’t know if the Unspeakables or myself will ever be able to find a way to get you back to your universe, I don’t want you discounting the gift magic gave us, I want you to have all the gifts available to you.”</p><p>Harry read between the lines. “What, so I should befriend my teenage parents so my magic feels more settled?”</p><p>“Or you could change your mind about meeting Euphemia and Fleamont Potter and settle in with your grandparents, but I won’t force you to do anything you don’t want to do, Harry,” Albus said kindly.</p><p>Harry snorted, that’d be a first. Fawkes startled at his snort, and flew back to his perch, giving him an offended look that made him laugh at the absolute absurdity of it all.</p><p>“You’re barely a quarter-century, and brilliant and brave, and I don’t like to think of you being alone,” Albus carried on. “Stay, Harry.”</p><p>“Alright,” he agreed, as if he was ever able to tell him no and mean it. “How have I been here for three months and not been told about complementary magic?”</p><p>“I imagine the same way no one has told you how to hold a wand or ride a broom or find the north star in the sky, I assume,” Dumbledore replied, eyes twinkling.</p><p>“Do you die without it?”</p><p>“No, Harry, but it’s very lonely,” Albus said. “Not that he cared about such a thing, but I think Tom marked his Death Eaters so he could have constant access both to their location as their lord and also twisting their magic so it was more complementary to his.”</p><p>“Or he was just psychopathic,” Harry muttered, reminded of his first encounter with this universe’s Voldemort. He was still in St. Mungo’s after his accident, just readying to leave, when he heard shrieks of terror and the distinctive green light of the killing curse. The war and Voldemort had found him again, even in this strange universe with complementary magics and a Dumbledore much less burdened with guilty.</p><p>“As you say,” Albus replied, and conjured him up a beautiful crystal wineglass, pouring him an ice-cold glass of butterbeer.</p><p>“Albus, is our magic complementary?”</p><p>“Dear boy, I value our friendship and your kindness to me, but it isn’t. You didn’t trust your universe’s version of me enough, and who can blame you, he set you on a path that led to you sacrificing your life,” Albus said, his voice low.</p><p>“I forgave you,” Harry replied, suddenly embarrassed by the force of Dumbledore’s stare.</p><p>“Ah, but did I ever forgive myself?” Albus asked.</p><p>“I don’t know sir,” Harry replied, lost in thought.</p><p>“Our magic isn’t complementary, you’ll know when you find it,” Dumbledore said kindly after a moment, and Harry wished he had any idea what he was talking about.</p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p> </p><p>The next week, at the Welcoming Feast, Harry’s eyes scanned over the Gryffindor table. This universe’s James Potter was laughing about something with Lily Evans, her red hair shining brightly, lit by the candles over the Great Hall.</p><p>She was so beautiful and alive that it hurt, his heart beating too fast in his chest. Mum, a long-dead part of him wanted to cry out.</p><p>Next to James was Remus, looking tired but happy. Wormtail was next to him, looking very young and innocent. Harry still couldn’t stand to look at his face.</p><p>He couldn’t spot Sirius though, and felt his heart sink for a moment. Was this universe devoid of his godfather in the same way Ariana Dumbledore lived?</p><p>He felt some hostile stares coming from the Slytherin table, and turned to look.</p><p>A terribly young Severus Snape turned his head away from him, not wanting to get caught, probably wanting his own look at the man who vanquished Voldemort along with Dumbledore.</p><p>But two seats over, a familiar face stole all his attention. Seated toward the end of the table, looking very alone in green-and-silver was Sirius Black. His brother was seated next to him, the pair of them looking distinctly unhappy.</p><p>He supposed Sirius was trying to project a haughty sort of aloofness, but Harry could see the loneliness behind the mask.</p><p>“Sirius Black is in Slytherin?” he whispered to Dumbledore.</p><p>Albus turned his sharp blue eyes on him. “The whole lot of them, for centuries, yes.”</p><p>“He wasn’t a Death Eater, was he? I didn’t see him, in our raid on Malfoy Manor, I would have recognised his magic,” Harry said quietly. It would have stung like the Cruciatus to have to fight on opposing sides to his godfather, alternate-universe and all.</p><p>“I’m quite sure he wasn’t a Death Eater. He doesn’t associate with them, and we’ve never seen him loudly espouse pureblood ideology. Young Mr. Black mostly keeps to himself,” Dumbledore replied.</p><p>“That sounds lonely,” Harry said, his mind drifting to a photo he saw of his parents wedding. Sirius was best man, the two of them were like brothers, Sirius so proud as he helped fix James’s wedding robes. “Is he a good student?”</p><p>Minerva McGonagall chimed in. “Top of the class in transfiguration, him and James Potter compete for the best marks. They’re some of the most brilliantly gifted and creative students I’ve seen in all my years of teaching.”</p><p>“Do they get along?” Harry asked, afraid to hear the answer.</p><p>“Their rivalry is cordial, but like Albus said, Mr. Black keeps to himself,” Minerva said.</p><p>“No man is an island,” Harry said, quoting something Hermione had told him once.</p><p>“Every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main,” Dumbledore replied, a farway look in his eyes. “Poetry is its own magic!”</p><p>Harry nodded, and met Dumbledore’s eyes.</p><p>
  <em>“Harry, I don’t have to be a genius to realise that Sirius was important to you in your world?” Dumbledore asked, using legilmency to speak directly into his mind.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Harry nodded, rifling through his memories to show Dumbledore some of it. He picked Christmas of his Fifth year, Sirius in good spirits, ruffling his hair, singing Christmas carols and drinking mulled wine, making him feel the most cherished person in the room and feeling like he had a family, even just for a day.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“I see,” Dumbledore said. “Be careful, Harry?”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Careful, how?”</em>
</p><p><em>“I may be old now, but trust that I know all about handsome young men from Dark Families,</em>” Dumbledore said, before closing off his mind from Harry.</p><p>He flushed, and went back to his meal, and tried to not stare at any of the students. He didn’t know how he could make it through a full year of this.</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Sirius felt his baby brother elbow him. “What is it, Reggie?”</p><p>“The new Defense professor is staring at you,” Regulus whispered, tearing into his roast with his usual nervous energy.</p><p>Sirius whipped his head around toward the staff table, Professor Potter turned away a little too quickly. “Maybe he’s trying to decide if we’re Dark Lords in training, and take us out next,” he suggested.</p><p>“Sirius!” Regulus moaned, his tone long-suffering as usual. “He’s powerful, you shouldn’t talk about him like that.”</p><p>“Unless he has an eavesdrop jinx on the Slytherin table, I’ll say what I like,” he muttered, feeling bold, stabbing viciously at a roast potato with his knife before spearing it into his mouth.</p><p>“Maybe he does. I heard he’s one of Potter’s ancestors from Merlin’s time, and Mulciber told me on the train that he’s absorbed the Dark Lord’s powers,” Regulus whispered, his face only passing a little judgement at his poor table manners.</p><p>“I’m sure that’s rubbish, and Mulciber is a little creep whom you should stay well clear of,” Sirius replied, turning his head to glare at Mulciber.</p><p>Sirius’s shoulder ached, a phantom pain of the bone-breaker hex Mulciber sent his way last year after denying another invitation from Bellatrix to come meet Voldemort.</p><p>He didn’t know how many more invitations he could turn down before getting killed, now he would never have to know that. Thanks to Dumbledore and their Defense Against the Dark Arts Professor.</p><p>Severus caught his eye instead, in one of his brief respites from staring forlornly at a particular ginger over at the Gryffindor table. “Your brother is right, this…new Potter isn’t an enemy you’d want to make if he was powerful enough to defeat the Dark Lord.”</p><p>Sirius sighed, and took another sip of his pumpkin juice. “Evans isn’t going to forgive you just because Voldemort’s gone, and you won’t convince her with your pathetic little looks at her.”</p><p>Severus turned an even more unattractive shade of pale. “Mind your business, Black.”</p><p>“How can I when you’re putting me off my meal with your pining?” Sirius snipped, shutting Severus up—at least for the moment.</p><p>Severus had a look on his face that promised revenge, and Sirius reminded himself to double-check the wards on his bed before going to sleep that night. One could never be too careful in the dungeons. The Black name could only protect him to a small extent, and he hated everything it stood for.</p><p>Sirius turned to look back at the Head Table. Professor Potter wasn’t old, mid-twenties if he had to guess, with a messy head of black hair that did look quite like James Potter’s.</p><p>His back was ramrod straight, as if he was holding himself so tightly that if he exhaled too hard he might fall apart.</p><p>There was a lighting-bolt shaped scar on his forehead that told of some dark magic, like he’d seen action, but of course he had. Vanquisher of Voldemort and all.</p><p>Professor Potter looked over and caught his eye, but he didn’t look away.</p><p>He actually smiled at him, a clear, open gaze with something like affection in his vivid green eyes. He looked at him like he knew him, and Sirius finally turned away. No one knew him.</p><p>“He is staring at you!” Regulus said again, his gray eyes very wide, making him look younger than fifteen.</p><p>“You’re right,” Sirius conceded, and waved cheekily to the professor, making his face colour in a way that….wasn’t unattractive. It would be an interesting year.</p>
