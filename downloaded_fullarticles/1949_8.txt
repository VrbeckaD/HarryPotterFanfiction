    <p>Some would have you believe Albus Dumbledore was as mad as a hatter. After all, have you seen his robes? The patterns? The colours? Others would shake their heads and proclaim the wizard to be the Great Manipulator, the one true Dark Lord hiding behind a silver veneer.</p>
<p>The truth was neither here nor there - never could be as clear cut as opponents and fans would like. Albus Dumbledore was a bright and gifted man. A man who had his flaws, yet was not ashamed to acknowledge them (when confronted of course, coming out still wasn’t a thing for centenarians). Early confrontation with his inner depths, early tragedy, had made him a proponent of change - in every aspect where it counted.</p>
<p>He liked mismatched socks, Flavour Beans, his tea without the milk, yet most of all he liked the way Fawkes’ plumage would subtly shift from one birth cycle to another. <em>Even time weathers down the endless</em>, the red-orange-golden feathers would whisper.</p>
<p>It wasn’t thus a surprise that - having veered off the greater good - young Albus would master the art of transfiguration and venture into the abstracts of alchemy in cahoots with that other illustrative figure: Nicholas Flamel.</p>
<p>It wasn’t also such a surprise for Albus when, years after having last seen him, his preference for change would clash with people’s natural xenophobia. That this resistance happened to be the vanguard of a darker figure, well, who could have guessed? For every no Albus had ever given, there had been quite an equal amounts of yes. In the grand scheme of things (not the greater good, but the bigger painting), what is one negligent prejudice?</p>
<p>The obliviation of hope, it turned out to be.</p>
<p>Thus, heavy-hearted, Albus buried promise after promise, sought an answer to a conflict that shouldn't exist. (“Why can’t people,” he would sometimes lament to himself, “just fight it out in the bowling lane?”) Then the Potter couple were killed, something transpired and the veil of darkness lifted over the world, leaving behind yet another orphan to be raised by strangers.</p>
<p>At least the boy had family. At least Albus knew - entirely by coincidence, by her own actions even - of the older sister, Begonia Dursley. (Something niggled in the back of his mind every time he thought of the lass, as if he’d not quite remembered something right.)</p>
<p>Suffice to say, because he knew of the person, because he was curious, because he felt as if young Lily and James deserved their fate as much as dear Ariana deserved hers, because you never <em>know</em> with these things, he happened to be there when the child was handed over.</p>
<p>He never told Minerva why he’d decided on a letter instead of knocking on the door. Daren’t utter what he suspected when he saw the toddler laying in Hagrid’s basket. Tried for the best to ignore his observation for the better part of nine years.</p>
<p>Then one night he went bowling with some friends and he found himself drinking a pint too much.</p>
<p>He looked at the pins down the lane and then looked at the ball in his hand. His eyes grew moist as he felt the weight of the ball and thought of that young boy laying in his basket. The magic and presence concentrated around the boy’s forehead.</p>
<p>He tried to do a perfect throw, he really did. But the ball went off not even three feet after it hit the deck.</p>
<p>“How unusual, Brian,” his friend Nicolas told him as the man was about to pick up his own ball. (His turn.)</p>
<p>Albus sat down and stared at his half full glass of beer.</p>
<p>“What is on your mind, mon petit?” Perenelle asked, sitting next to him.</p>
<p>“I don’t know how to save him,” he finally dared admit.</p>
<p>Nicolas of course scored a perfect strike. “Save who?” he asked. You’d think six centuries would render you deaf, but that wasn’t the case at all.</p>
<p>Albus heaved a sigh. “The Potter boy.”</p>
<p>“Le bébé that survived that Voldemort figure?” Perenelle inquired.</p>
<p>Nicolas nodded as if something started to make sense. “Only Dark magic would vanish a body like that. The Killing Curse is too light-handed to do so.”</p>
<p>The downside of hanging around with people who’d gained longevity in the 14th century is that it's rather difficult to hold things close to one's vest.</p>
<p>“I suspect soul magic,” Albus shared. “Dark, foul, soul magic. I don’t know whether the boy actually survived the night. I don’t know whether the boy can be cured without dying.”</p>
<p>Nicolas had then clapped his hand on Albus’ shoulder and said: “You’ll figure something out. You always do.”</p>
<p>Perenelle shrugged and stood up, ready to play her turn. “I’ll have a look at our experiments, see whether there’s anything worthwhile in them.”</p>
<p>It did help Albus regain his confidence, though that one round did define the rest of his game: he ended up last!</p>
