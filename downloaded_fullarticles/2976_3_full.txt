    <p>Gawain Robards pushes a sheet of parchment across the table. He takes a sip of tea and watches Draco as grey eyes scan the list of names of new Auror recruits that have just started their training. The Head Auror waits for him to look up before putting his cup down and speaking.</p><p>"Jonathan McAllister. Very... feisty, like what you said."</p><p>Which Draco translates to <i>hot-tempered, with a blatant disregard for discipline</i>.</p><p>The name conjures a memory of a tall redhead in Gryffindor robes, scowling in concentration as he advances towards Draco, his wand snapping in the air and incantations rolling off his tongue as he deflects a volley of N.E.W.T-level curses during Draco’s Duelling Club session.</p><p>Draco puts down the parchment. "I stand by my recommendations. He will need a firm hand to guide him, but he was one of my top students last year, excelling in both theory and practical. The Auror Corps would benefit greatly from his talents and instinct." He glances at the names again. Roughly two-thirds of them are his former students. "I trust the others have not given you as much trouble?" </p><p>"Still too early to say yet, they're barely one month into the Academy." Robards cracks a rare smile. "No need to sound so defensive over McAllister. I have learnt to trust your recommendations.” </p><p>Draco looks at a name on the parchment — Ellie Barker. He can't help the small beam of pride tugging on his lips as he remembers Ellie, a shy, petite Slytherin (one of his own!) — <i>"I... I'd really like to be an Auror, Professor Malfoy, but I don't think I can do it..."</i> — blooming into a confident dueller. He received an owl from her days ago, and her excitement about her admission and gratitude for his tutelage lifted his spirits for the entire day. </p><p>"More tea?" he offers. At Robards's nod, he flicks his wand to refresh his cup. They spend some time in Draco’s office discussing the recruits, along with fine-tuning some aspects of this partnership with Robards and the DMLE.</p><p>The collaboration is Draco's brainchild, implemented at the start of his second year teaching Defence Against the Dark Arts in Hogwarts. There are two objectives: to reduce the dropout rate of new Aurors in the Academy, and to decrease the amount of training time needed for fresh recruits. To accomplish this, Draco tailors the contents of the sixth- and seventh-year syllabus to reflect some of the topics covered in the Academy, but he has to strike a balance not to exclude those students with no interest in being Aurors. Also, as Head of Slytherin House, he dispenses career advice for the fifth years, so this helps him to take note of students keen on a job in the DMLE. </p><p>When he first broached this idea to the rest of the teachers, Charlie Weasley (Professor of Care of Magical Creatures, Head of Gryffindor), who was a new addition to the faculty, frowned and said, "That won't be fair to the other Houses."</p><p>Draco was prepared for that. "I am aware of this, so if this project is to take flight, I would welcome suggestions regarding promising Auror recruits from the Heads of the other Houses. Such students would naturally be in my N.E.W.T. classes, and I will gauge their potential and capabilities with equal favour." </p><p>For the next two years, Draco would appraise the students, noticing their technique, leadership skills and character, along with their ability to handle pressure and conflict. After their final exams, he would send Robards a list of names that he recommends, along with reference letters for students that requested it from him.</p><p>The partnership is a win for all parties involved: the DMLE clearly benefits, Hogwarts enjoys a raise in her profile, and as for Draco...</p><p>It’s nine years after the War, but he knows that no matter how many glowing reviews he receives, there will still be parents displeased with having a Death Eater as a teacher. This collaboration would present him in a better light, increasing his job security. Also, it’s always useful having connections to the DMLE, and by extension, the Ministry. </p><p>After all, Draco would never invest so much time and energy into something that wouldn't directly benefit him.</p><p>"I think we're finished here." Robards packs up his notes. He drains his tea, stands up, and both men shake hands. </p><p>"I shall see you this time next year, then," Draco says. This is their first meeting at Draco's office in Hogwarts, just before the start-of-term feast. </p><p>"Have a good year ahead. What is it, your fourth year here?" Robards says, shaking his head as he runs his fingers through his salt-and-pepper hair. "Time sure passes fast." He puts on his coat, and then looks at Draco. "Seems like yesterday that you were in the Academy yourself. Shame about your hasty departure, but your reasons were sound." </p><p>Draco stiffens. "Thank you for keeping my reasons secret." </p><p>He follows Robards to the door, and at the threshold, Robards turns back. "I'm sure you know this, but Potter's now teaching at Hogwarts. Strange how he switched from professional Quidditch to teaching." His gaze sharpens. "And what's even stranger is how he quit the Academy after you left." </p><p>Draco's smile feels plastered on, and he's saved from answering when Charlie Weasley barrels into the room, narrowly missing Robards. </p><p>"Whoa, sorry!" Charlie exclaims, stepping back at once.  </p><p>"No harm done," Robards says. He asks after the Weasleys, especially Arthur Weasley, who is retired. </p><p>“Oh, Dad's doing great! He helps George out with the shop sometimes, and he spends way too much time tinkering with his Muggle things, driving Mum absolutely spare,” Charlie says.</p><p>Eventually, Robards nods at them and bids goodbye. Charlie closes the door after Robards leaves. He follows Draco to his table, plopping down on the chair that Robards vacated minutes ago. "So how many of mine made it into the Academy this year?" </p><p>Draco tells him, and he whoops. "All right! That's... six more than yours!" </p><p>Draco sniffs. "I'm sure mine count for more since being an Auror is such a Gryffindor profession."</p><p>"Nope, that's not how it works." Charlie grins. "And you should talk, being one yourself, years ago. Does it actually count if you didn’t finish the Academy proper?" He pauses, then dismisses the question. "Well, you're here now, and you're gonna do your usual terrorising of the first-years." </p><p>"I won't be terrorising anyone if this new cohort isn't the usual pack of dunderheads I have to teach," Draco replies, his voice muffled as he pokes his head into the cupboard to unpack his things. </p><p>"Usual dunderheads," Charlie echoes, laughing. "Channelling your inner Snape now, are we? Isn't it enough that you swirl your robes around like a giant bat like him? At least you wash your hair more often." </p><p>Draco takes out his textbooks and places them on the table. "I won't have you talking about my late mentor like that." </p><p>"C'mon, you know it's all in good fun. I'm fun, unlike you," Charlie says, grinning. He stands up, draws himself up to his full height (which is still a head shorter than Draco), fixes him with a haughty, formal expression that Draco supposes is an imitation of himself, and sticks his hand out towards Draco. He intones in a flat voice, "Good morning, Mr Charles Weasley, my name is Draco Malfoy. It is a pleasure to meet you, and I wish that we will have a pleasant working relationship."  </p><p>Charlie drops his facade. "No one, not even my parents, calls me Charles." He sits down. "Took you months to finally start calling me Charlie." </p><p>"Charles is your given name, isn't it? Why would your parents name you that if they aren't going to call you that?" </p><p>"It's a nickname! If I called you Drake—" </p><p>"Call me that, and I will hex you all the way back to Romania," Draco warns. He drops his gaze down Charlie's body — he might be in robes, but Draco knows how defined his muscles are, thanks to his work at the dragon sanctuary over summer hols. He’s fit (even with all the freckles), there's no doubt about it, but Draco will never see him in that way. </p><p>"What happened?" He gestures to a healing burn visible on Charlie's forearm when Charlie pushes up a sleeve. "One of the dragons get you?" </p><p>Charlie looks at the injury and winces at the memory. "Yeah. She's a right fighter, that one. She and I go a long way back, and... " He sighs, rubbing the back of his neck. "She's not doing too well at the moment." His expression of concern morphs into irritation when his fingers catch on air instead of his usual ponytail. </p><p>"Your mother chopped it off again?" Draco asks, raising an eyebrow at the uneven cut of Charlie's hair.     </p><p>"Oh, you know how it is. I go home for summer, she cuts it, I go to Romania and then back home, she cuts it again, I grow it out during school term, and there it goes again." He huffs in exasperation. "You'd think she'd lay off, seeing that I'm already thirty-five." He looks at Draco. "Speaking of mothers, how's yours?" </p><p>"She's doing very well, thank you for asking." Draco rummages in his knapsack, pulling out two tins of biscuits. "Here you go." </p><p>Charlie brightens at once. He pries open a tin and pours out a handful of butter biscuits on the table (Draco wrinkles his nose at the crumbs). "Oh, brilliant," he says, gazing starry-eyed at the dragon-shaped biscuits before popping two into his mouth. "So good!" he declares in delight. </p><p>Draco smiles at his friend's blissful expression. These dragon biscuits are sold only in France, and he always buys some back for Charlie when he returns home every year. He knew right from the start that Charlie loves dragons, but when they first met, he just didn't know how much. </p><p>
  <i>"Are you seeing anyone, Charles? Or is this too inappropriate a question to ask this early into our friendship?" </i>
</p><p>
  <i>"Merlin, Draco, no need to be so formal all the time. No, it's alright. I'm not seeing anyone. I'm just more comfortable around animals, especially dragons. I really love dragons." </i>
</p><p><i>"My apologies, but I think I would have to clarify. Love as in... love dragons or love</i> love <i>dragons?"</i></p><p><i>"What?! No, not in that way, bloody hell, Draco! I just haven't found anyone, bird or bloke, who loves dragons as much as I do, and who would be suitable for me as a partner."</i> </p><p>During the past two years (Charlie joined the faculty a year after Draco), Draco has grown to be rather fond of him. Things started out awkward and stiff between them, but it gradually developed into acquaintanceship, and finally, friendship. Also, as far as Weasleys went, Charlie is probably the best one out of the lot — Draco had the least contact with him. </p><p>The minute Charlie got wind of the Care of Magical Creatures vacancy, he took the first Portkey out of Romania into London, Flooed to Hogsmeade and flew to Hogwarts, before charging wildly into one of Minerva's Transfiguration lessons and waving his resume like a madman.   </p><p>Draco was surprised he didn't come roaring in on a bloody dragon. </p><p>It was a refreshing change having Charlie around. Sure, Draco got on well enough with the other teachers, but they were so much older. Although, it appears that the average age of the faculty would be dropping again, with the addition of— </p><p>"Harry's here already, I ran into Horace on the way here and he told me." Charlie looks at him, his words hesitant when Draco’s lips thin at the mention of Potter. "You'll be alright, yeah? You've always had a... history with him, and more recently, with the whole... Auror thing..." he trails off uncertainly. </p><p>Draco hasn't even seen the man himself in seven years, yet he has sat through three separate conversations about him; two from Robards and Charlie, and one from Minerva. The Headmistress sought him out soon after he returned, breaking the news that Harry Potter is replacing Madam Hooch as Flying Instructor, although he requested for the name of his classes to be changed to "Quidditch and Muggle Games" to "better reflect the scope" of his lessons.</p><p>What does <i>Muggle Games</i> mean, anyway? </p><p>Minerva used sentences like "colourful, turbulent history, as I should know, having seen your fighting when you attended Hogwarts yourself, Professor Malfoy," and "grown out of such things," and "no longer a student now, but a very distinguished and competent member of our faculty," all the while peering at him over her spectacles, making him feel very much like a student. </p><p>After Draco recovered from the sheer shock of it all, he said to her, in a calm that he most definitely did not feel, "I'm certain that I will not let our history hamper my professionalism in any way." </p><p>And then he returned to his chambers and promptly drowned himself in copious amounts of tea. </p><p>When Charlie mutters his name, Draco pulls himself back to the present. He's not sure what the other man means by <i>the whole Auror thing</i>, because he most certainly did not tell Charlie what happened between them during their time in the Academy. Besides, who knows what Potter told Charlie... after that... <i>that</i>—</p><p>Draco tells Charlie what he told Minerva. Intent on avoiding the subject, he glances at his watch and pulls on his robes. "The students would be arriving soon. We should be going.”</p><p>They head to the Great Hall, with Charlie prattling on about the Weasleys' recent family holiday to Spain. As they walk, Draco basks in the peace of these hallowed halls minutes before the hordes of students, both old and new, descend into Hogwarts for yet another school year. </p><p>When they're steps away from the Hall, a bright shot of laughter rings out in the air. </p><p>Draco freezes. </p><p>He'd know that laugh anywhere.   </p><p>Charlie stops beside him, shooting him a look of concern. </p><p>Draco schools his features into an expression of aloof detachment and enters the Hall. He's going to play it cool, show that he's not as affected as everyone thinks he is— </p><p>"Harry, mate!" Charlie yells, waving madly. "Good to see you!" </p><p>Draco makes a note never to bring along over-exuberant Gryffindors when planning a quiet entrance. </p><p>Potter shouts back a greeting, and Draco's heart thuds — out of tension or desire, he doesn't know and doesn't want to know. Nevertheless, Draco resolutely doesn't look at the staff table as he makes his way there, instead letting his gaze flicker everywhere else, from the decorations of the Hall to the long tables. </p><p>Despite that, he knows Potter is looking at him. </p><p>He always knows when Potter's eyes are on him. </p><p>He takes his usual seat between Filius Flitwick and Aurora Sinistra — they’re not here yet — busying himself with smoothing out his napkin and shifting his cutlery and goblet to his preferred positions. He looks up only when Charlie has engaged Potter in conversation. </p><p>He is not prepared for this onslaught of Potter-related emotions. </p><p>He thought he'd left it all behind him, yet he drinks in Potter's appearance like a castaway in the desert devouring a goblet of water: dark hair — still messy but much shorter, like their fifth year in Hogwarts, highlighting the strong line of his jaw. He's clean-shaven now, which is a change from the perpetual stubble that he used to sport in the Academy. Same heavyset brows and round glasses (Draco used to tease him about the style being so last century) framing vibrant green eyes that crinkle at the corners whenever Potter smiles. </p><p>Potter is wearing robes, which hide his frame, but Draco would bet every last Galleon to his name that under those robes, his physique is still as fit as he remembers. </p><p>Draco's breath hitches when he spots the twin black stud earrings on Potter's left earlobe. </p><p>Those piercings are completely new, and it's fucking sexy. </p><p>Potter laughs, and Draco is instantly transported to that pub night with their fellow Auror trainees in the Leaky — Potter pushing him up against the wall of the loo, arms snaking their way around Draco's waist, hands going down to squeeze his arse as he swept him into a kiss so intense that Draco's toes curled in his boots. Shock and disbelief pounding through him that it was Potter kissing him like this, holding him like this, Draco's hands trailing up Potter's abdomen, gasping at his taut stomach and warm skin. The taste of alcohol on Potter’s breath, but the lucidity in green eyes told Draco that they were both sober enough, what this meant— </p><p>—<i>what they could have been.</i></p><p>Draco wanked himself raw for days after that kiss. </p><p>He was twenty years old, hormonal and lust-filled. Seven years have passed, and he would like to think he's above that now. </p><p>Filius and Aurora reach the table, and Draco hurriedly looks away from Potter to engage the Charms and Astronomy professors in polite conversation about their hols. When there's a lull in the conversation, Draco casually glances back at Potter, only to see the other man frowning at him. </p><p>It's a force of habit when Draco matches Potter's scowl with equal intensity, easing only when Potter's frown morphs into a puzzled expression, before he looks away. </p><p>Draco's hands curl in his lap.  </p><p>
  <i>Well, if you want to play it that way, bring it on.</i>
</p><p>There's a familiar rumble of footsteps and the low, muffled hum of excited chatter, and the majestic doors of the Hall swing open. </p><p>The students have arrived.</p><hr/><p>Harry adds his cheers to the mix when the Sorting concludes, with Charlie's whoops being the loudest when Anthony Zabelle is sorted into Gryffindor. A surge of nostalgia overwhelms Harry when Anthony goes to an empty seat at the Gryffindor table — that was Harry, Hermione and Ron's usual spot. He misses his two best friends back in London so much; Ron is working with George at Wheezes, while Hermione is a Healer at Mungo's. </p><p>When McGonagall (he'll need some time getting used to calling her by her given name) takes the owl lectern for the usual start-of-term speech, Harry grins as he scans the bright, eager faces turned towards her. This is so different from his last memory of the Great Hall; he can still remember the fresh blood glistening on the stone floor, cries of grief piercing the air as survivors of the war cradled the lifeless bodies of their loved ones. </p><p>Harry's smile fades.  </p><p>After his victory over Voldemort, he remembers the great chunks torn from the marble staircases of the castle, the gaping holes in the ruined walls, the rubble and bodies scattered on the floor. The Quidditch pitch was on fire, and through his screams and sobs, he tried to put it out, even though he knew it was no use — the fire was too big, and as it ripped through the pitch, it felt like his happiest memories of flying were burnt into cinders.</p><p>That's all in the past now. </p><p>Ron and he skipped eighth year, with only Hermione returning to obtain her necessary qualifications for Healing. When Harry reached Hogwarts that afternoon, he spent some time getting re-acquainted with the castle. Equipped with the Marauders' Map, he wandered around the castle, which is now restored to its former glory. He let himself fall into the bittersweet fog of nostalgia, lingering at places he used to frequent as a student. You wouldn't even know a battle had occurred here, except for the war memorial on the seventh floor. His last stop was the White Tomb, Dumbledore's grave on the shores of the Great Lake. He spent a peaceful time there, simply sitting and watching the rippling water. He even laughed when the Giant Squid popped out a tentacle and waved it in his direction, as if welcoming him back. </p><p>This is how he wants to remember Hogwarts: of magic and wonder, of rebirth and renewal... </p><p>...of <i>home.</i></p><p>Even though little appears to have changed, Harry is thankful for the Map, for half of the bloody staircases have changed their destinations, some doors that he was familiar with are locked now, and the locations of some portraits (along with their corresponding hidden passages) have been moved. </p><p>The faculty has mostly remained the same, except for one marked difference.</p><p>Harry slants his head to the left, edging a glance at Draco Malfoy, who is looking straight at him. It's been years, and he's even more gorgeous now— </p><p> </p><p>Already flustered, Harry yelps particularly loudly when Charlie elbows him hard in the ribs. </p><p>"Get up, Minerva's talking about you," he hisses.</p><p>Harry looks at McGonagall, who does not appear to be amused. His face heating at the expectant faces turned towards him, he stands, waving when McGonagall introduces him as "Mr Harry Potter, Instructor of Quidditch and Muggle Games". Whispers break out like wildfire among the students, and he catches phrases like, "the Harry Potter", "our Saviour and Seeker for the Magpies", "won the Quidditch World Cup", and "what are Muggle games, anyway". </p><p>Silence falls when McGonagall clears her throat. She ends her speech by wishing the students a fruitful term ahead, and when she claps her hands, food appears on their plates. She steps down from the lectern and returns to her seat at the middle of the table, raising her eyebrows at Harry on the way there.</p><p>Dinner passes uneventfully, with Harry talking mostly to Charlie and Pomona Sprout, although he does find his gaze wandering to Malfoy often. His mannerisms are still familiar — cutting his food with precise strokes, his goblet always on his right side, and when he talks to Sinistra and Flitwick, there's a slight pause before he speaks, as if he's considering an issue from all angles.</p><p>When he locked eyes with Malfoy earlier, he probably shouldn't have glared at him like that, but it's hard to suppress his frustration at their... <i>unfinished business</i> years ago. </p><p>Damn, it sounds so bloody sordid when he puts it like that. </p><p>And what the hell, why is Malfoy ignoring him? Not even a glance, as if they're complete strangers! </p><p>Harry munches grumpily on his bread and butter pudding. </p><p>Soon, Malfoy makes his excuses, stands up, nods — his eyes lingering on Harry — and leaves. Harry watches as he walks away, controlling the urge to chase him and shake some answers out of him. Vexed, he sighs and tears his attention away from Malfoy, only to see the rest of the faculty staring at him. </p><p>"What?" he squawks. </p><p>His new colleagues dissolve into a chorus of "Nothing, Harry!", clearing of throats and polite laughter. He casts a suspicious look at them, especially at a grinning Charlie, but returns to his pudding.</p><p>He spends some time catching up with McGonagall and the other professors, and when he's ready to retire for the night, most of the school population — both students and teachers — have left. Upon spotting the leftover pork chops at the table, Harry perks up. He transfigures a napkin into a bag, and stuffs a few chops into it — Pork Chop hasn't tasted pork chops cooked the Hogwarts way, and he's sure she'll love it. </p><p>Harry wishes everyone a good night, and leaves the Hall, heading towards the direction of his room. </p><p>Or so he would've, but at every turn of the corner and descent of each staircase, Harry gets the feeling that he's going in circles. It doesn't help that he isn’t very familiar with his destination — Madam Hooch's old room. Some students are still milling about the halls, but Harry's pride and embarrassment stops him from asking for directions. And he left his Map in the room, having falsely thought that he was going to be late for the Sorting. Harry sighs, looking at the grease of the pork chops seeping through the bag. He wanders down another corridor, and when he sees a shadow around the corner, he makes up his mind to ask this person for help. </p><p>Of course, it has to be Draco sodding Malfoy.  </p><p>Malfoy's walk is purposeful and sure, but he slows down when he approaches Harry. His brows pull together in a slight frown. "Are you alright, Potter? You look particularly..." he gestures to Harry's face. "Confused." </p><p>"Er." Harry peers at both ends of the corridor. "I think I'm lost," he says, feeling very much like a first-year.  </p><p>This is hardly the suave and sophisticated greeting that he is hoping for after seven years. </p><p>To Harry's surprise, Malfoy doesn't laugh right in his face.</p><p>"Are you staying at Rolanda Hooch's old quarters?" he asks. At Harry's nod, Malfoy leads him back the way he came. Harry follows him, passing through corridors and climbing a staircase. Malfoy sniffs the air, and then looks at Harry's bag. "You know the elves can make you something if you get hungry later at night." </p><p>"No, it's not for me. It's pork chops, for my pet," Harry explains, holding up the bag.</p><p>"You brought a pet to Hogwarts?" </p><p>"Yep, an Ashwinder." Harry smiles at the thought of Pork Chop.  </p><p>"An Ashwinder?" Malfoy yelps, stopping in his tracks. "Have you gone completely mad? The eggs of those snakes can burn down the school! There are students here, Potter, if you haven't noticed—" </p><p>"Hey, hey," Harry cuts him off; he knows how hard it is to stop Malfoy when he's in full ranting mode. "She might be an Ashwinder, but she can't lay any more eggs. Plus, McGonagall says it's okay." A hot spike of irritation surges in him, and he treads alongside Malfoy when Malfoy resumes walking. "Give me some damn credit. You wouldn't really think I'd bring a dangerous creature to school without thinking it through." </p><p>"I wouldn't know. You don't really have a reputation for thinking things through." </p><p>Harry would take offence at that, except for Malfoy's tone — not combative like the words themselves, but rather… wistful, as if he's lost in some memory.   </p><p>They walk in strained silence, and when they turn down another corridor, Harry recognises the furnishings of the area. He knows his way back, but he keeps quiet, wanting this private moment with Malfoy. The question, bubbling and simmering inside him for years, is poised at the tip of his tongue. He knows it's way too early for this landmine of a conversation, but he can't bear it anymore. </p><p>"Why did you leave Auror training?" he blurts out. </p><p>Malfoy freezes, and then hurries ahead. </p><p>Harry blinks at his rapidly retreating figure. "Damn it, Malfoy. Stop running!" He catches up to the other man and whirls him around by the arm. "We were one week away from finishing, and everything was alright, but you just upped and left without any warning! One day you were there, and the next, you weren't. Robards said you left, and... and my owls to you kept returning unread. Where did you go, and why? Why couldn't you tell me?" </p><p>Grey eyes flash as Malfoy shakes his arm free. A coil of heat flares deep in the pit of Harry's belly. It's been years, and it's amazing how Malfoy can still trigger this visceral passion in him. </p><p>"It's in the past, Potter—" </p><p>But Harry's mind is buzzing with the possible reasons for Malfoy's sudden departure, reasons that he turned over repeatedly throughout the years. He wants answers, and he wants them now. "Was it because you were scared of being an Auror? Or did you finally have enough of the gossip and dirty looks that some of the trainees gave you?" His voice drops, and he remembers how foolish he felt, so damn embarrassed and rejected when Malfoy ran off four days after that night at the pub. "Was it me? Was it because... because I kissed you? Was it that bad that you had to flee the damn country?"</p><p>Malfoy stares at him for a long moment, his head shaking in disbelief and his mouth opening and closing, at an utter loss of what to say. He eventually lets out a cold, hard laugh that curls viciously at the corners, and Harry glares at him. It’s clear that Malfoy is controlling his temper — the ramrod tightness of his body, paired with his flinty stare. "Not everything revolves around you, Potter. I shall escort you to your quarters and we will never speak of this again." </p><p>"You know what?" Harry says, his anger quickly matching Malfoy's. "I think I can find my way back from here, thanks." </p><p>"Good," Malfoy bites out, his tone indicating anything but that. He narrows his eyes at Harry, and a sudden pang of sadness hits Harry — it seems like they're back to square one, that their growing friendship (or maybe even something more, but he doesn't dare think about that) during their time at the Academy is well and truly destroyed. </p><p>"Stay out of my way, and I'll stay out of yours." Malfoy growls, and in a dramatic swish of his robes, he stalks away, leaving Harry staring after him. </p><p>"Wanker," Harry mutters and stomps to his room. He slams the door shut behind him and aims a hard kick at it. </p><p>"My, someone's in a right snit tonight." </p><p>He spins around, his mood lifting at the sight of Pork Chop, her long, pale-grey body uncoiling as she slithers out of her basket to greet him. Her body is as thick as Harry's forearm, and when she winds herself around his chest, she's long enough to coil around him three times. She regards him with glowing, red eyes. Her tongue flicks out, and the corners of her mouth hike up into a faint smile. "You have something for me." </p><p>"Hey, Porks," Harry greets, toeing off his shoes and socks. He places the bag in front of her, and there's a rustling of paper as Pork Chop noses into the bag. "I cast a warming charm on it, so it should still be alright." He shrugs off his robe, jumper and his shirt, and grabs the comfortable, baggy AC/DC T-shirt on his bed. </p><p>"It’s bloody tiring, trying to figure him out." Harry pulls the T-shirt over his head. "Porks?" he says when he shakes his head free from the shirt. </p><p>Pork Chop withdraws her head from the bag, flashing Harry an unnaturally wide grin as her jaws flex and unhinge for her to swallow the pork chop; this means she can't talk for a while. She waggles her tail at him, urging him to go on. He slumps down on the floor beside her, tipping his head back on the wall. "I've mentioned him a few times before, you know, Draco Malfoy." </p><p>Pork Chop gives him an unamused look. </p><p>"Okay, fine, maybe a lot more than a few times. I saw him tonight." Harry tells her about their antagonistic interactions. "It clearly meant nothing to him, and I feel so silly about it all, after what I told him that night..." </p><p><i>I've wanted this for so long, you have no idea</i>, Harry said between kisses, licks and nibbles as he pressed Malfoy up against the wall. Malfoy felt incredible in his arms, his trembling body so responsive to him, and his arse, Merlin, the perfectly round globes of his arse, so pliant and warm as Harry groped him greedily. <i>Harry, oh God, don't stop</i>, Malfoy panted into Harry's neck as he arched into his touch.</p><p>He still can't forget what his first name sounded like, moaned from Malfoy’s luscious lips.</p><p>"Will you take this biped, the Head of the noble House of Slytherin, as your mate, then?" </p><p>Harry shakes himself out of that salacious memory and stares at Pork Chop, incredulous. </p><p>"Have you been listening? I've spent the past ten minutes telling you how we came this close to having a shouting match the first time we’d spoken in years." </p><p>Pork Chop rolls her eyes. "Yes, but I can smell your arousal. You clearly still want to mount him." </p><p>"Don't... don't say it like that!" Harry hisses, embarrassed. "Anyway, enough about him. How was your first day here? It’d take some time getting used to things, coming from London." </p><p>Pork Chop slithers up onto Harry's outstretched legs, and considers the question. "It's not as bad as I thought. It's nice and quiet, and the air is clean here. The castle intrigues me, and I like the grass at the Quidditch pitch. It feels very nice against my scales." She lifts her head up and flicks her tongue out in delight, uncharacteristic excitement brimming in her voice. "Oh, and I get to see Charlie every day if I want to!" </p><p>"You and Charlie. Sometimes I reckon you like him more than me." </p><p>A pause. </p><p>"But I do like him more than you, Harry."</p><p>She hisses with glee at Harry's feigned, injured air, and takes the sting out of her words by nuzzling her head on his arm and moving further up to his thighs, wrapping her neck around his wrist, cuddling him. "I can hunt in the big Forest nearby, although my instincts tell me that not all of its inhabitants will be friendly." </p><p>Harry agrees with her, but he's not too worried — Pork Chop is a crafty and smart fire-breathing Ashwinder that is able to camouflage, she's more than capable of taking care of herself.   </p><p>"Remember what McGonagall said, though. You've got to stay away from the students," Harry reminds her. "Hang on, how d’you get around the castle anyway? I know you've got a good sense of direction, but things can be quite confusing, yeah?" </p><p>"Oh, it's alright. I just followed the voice in the walls." </p><p>"What?" Horrified, Harry sits up straight so quickly that half of Pork Chop's body falls to the floor. "It can't be the Basilisk, I bloody well killed it!" He turns panicky eyes onto Pork Chop. "Did you listen to it? What did it tell you? Did you go into the Chamber—" He stops short at the mischievous glimmer in her eyes, glowing as red as embers.</p><p>"That's it. No more pork chops for you," Harry grumps. </p><p>"Nooo," she whines, that single word emerging in a long, desperate hiss. "Don't take my pork chops away."</p><p>And that's how she got her name — her other sources of food might be live animals, but for some reason, she really, really likes pork chops, raw or cooked.</p><p>"I navigate by sight and scent. Each part of the castle smells different." She fixes Harry with a beady look. "So what are you going to do about your biped?" </p><p>He shrugs. "Dunno. We'll stay out of each other's way, like he said. McGonagall's right, we're hardly boys anymore, so I'm sure things will be alright." </p><p>Her eyes gleam. "But he looked good tonight, didn't he?"</p><p>He releases a short bark of laughter. Malfoy is still as prim and proper as ever, and his current hairstyle reminds Harry of their sixth year, loose, not slicked back like at the Academy. He’s put on a bit of weight too, no doubt due to the lavish meals at Hogwarts, but he wears it well. Harry likes how he looks now, more approachable and less pointy. It’s clear that teaching suits Malfoy; he looks so at ease in Hogwarts. </p><p>It's been seven long years, and Malfoy still has the nicest, <i>tightest</i> arse that Harry's ever seen. </p><p>
  <i>Fuck.</i>
</p><hr/><p>Ever since he’s been a professor at Hogwarts, Draco has never been late for anything. </p><p>Of course, the first time he is late has to be on the first morning of term, when his whole House is waiting for their class schedules. Draco looks into the mirror and quickly pats his hair, thanking the founders for his habit of setting out his clothes and things the night before. He jams his tie and wand into his pockets, fastens his robes and grabs the sheaf of schedules off his table. He exits his chambers and hurries towards the Great Hall, breaking into an undignified run when students from the other Houses are already streaming into the corridors.</p><p>When he bursts into the Hall, only the Slytherin table is still full. The six Slytherin prefects jump to their feet. "Are you alright, sir? You're never late," Marjorie Kellen, one of his seventh-year prefects, asks. </p><p>"I'm alright, thank you for your concern," he says to her, and then addresses his House. "My apologies, everyone. I had a late start this morning. If your teachers should ask you about your tardiness, please tell them that it is entirely my fault," he says, inclining his head. "I have your class schedules, and they're sorted by year. I will hand them to your prefects, and they will assist me in distributing them. Please leave at once to your first class when you have your schedule." </p><p>After that’s all sorted out, Draco breathes a sigh of relief when the last of Slytherin House files out. He's the only one left in the Hall. He checks his watch — fifteen minutes since the start of first period. Add another five to ten minutes of travelling time, which means the latest that they'll be late for would be twenty-five minutes. </p><p>All because of him. </p><p>Salazar, what sort of impression is he setting for his students? </p><p>Annoyed with himself, he takes his seat at the faculty table and begins to tuck into his breakfast. He's lucky there's no Defence lesson for the first period of this particular weekday, granting him enough time for a leisurely meal. </p><p>Draco chews angrily on his toast at the reason for his tardiness. </p><p>It's all Potter's fault, winding him up like that last night, getting him all hot and bothered until he couldn't sleep properly, and even in his fitful slumber, he was bombarded by explicit dreams of Potter. Why did Potter have to bring the kiss up, fooling Draco into thinking that for years, just like him, Potter hadn't been able to forget that heated kiss?</p><p>Draco woke up with a throbbing erection, one that was impossible to ignore, and since his alarm was silent, he indulged in a luxurious wank — <i>have you been thinking about me, Potter, because I have. I'm thinking about you so hard right now, just knowing that you're in the same building, fuck, have you ever wanked while fantasising about me</i>— until he came so hard he saw stars.  </p><p>It was only during his afterglow when he realised that something was terribly wrong. By now, he should be hearing some signs of life from his students exiting the dungeons for breakfast — as per tradition, the rooms of the Heads of Houses are near their House — but everything was eerily silent. </p><p>Unbeknownst to him, he switched his alarm off.</p><p>And that's why he was late. </p><p>Because of Potter and his own stupid, raging libido. </p><p>Draco finishes his toast and drains his orange juice. He loops his tie around his neck, straightens his robes and then closes his eyes, taking a moment to steady himself. His first class of the day is with the seventh-years, a class that he particularly enjoys. Feeling more composed and ready for the first day of term, he leaves the Hall and heads for his classroom.</p><p>On the way there, who else should he run into but Harry bloody Potter, looking like a walking wet dream in his Quidditch leathers? </p><p>Draco doesn't know whether to laugh or cry. </p><p>Potter looks surprised and a bit wary, but he stands his ground. "Late night, Malfoy? Didn't catch you at breakfast this morning." </p><p>
  <i>Merlin, wouldn't you want to know?</i>
</p><p>Draco’s mouth turns dry as he eyes Potter up. Salazar, how many times has he wanked to Potter in his Quidditch attire? Last year, the day after the British national team won the Quidditch World Cup, there was no escaping the photographs plastered on the cover of every British magazine and newspaper of Potter catching the Snitch during the final, clinching the Cup for the country. Potter was so unattainable then, yet now, he's right in front of him, close enough to touch. </p><p>Draco's hands curl, and he quickly crosses his arms.  </p><p>Potter was at the height of his flying career; young and fit, he could've earned more riches and fame by playing for better-paying clubs and supporting endorsements. Instead, what did he do? </p><p>He threw it all to the wind and returned to Hogwarts to teach. </p><p><i>I can never figure you out, Potter.</i> </p><p>"You alright, Malfoy? You're staring," Potter says, tilting his head. </p><p>Draco has carved out a quiet, peaceful career in Hogwarts, and he certainly doesn't need Potter messing things up for him. Besides, why is he decked out in Quidditch gear anyway — flying lessons and Quidditch trials start only two weeks into term. <i>Probably going to perform for his fan club.</i></p><p>"Just leave me alone, please," Draco mutters, his good mood rapidly dissipating. He makes to push past Potter, but the other man catches his elbow and yanks him closer. </p><p>"What the hell is your problem, Malfoy? I've done nothing to deserve this shit attitude from you." A familiar fiery gleam enters narrowed green eyes, and Draco's heartbeat ramps up.</p><p>"What part of <i>leave me alone</i> do you not understand? Or do you think I'm up to something again, following me around like in sixth year?"</p><p>"I wasn't wrong then, was I?" </p><p>Draco stares at him, speechless in his sudden fury. "How dare you bring that up," he whispers, his voice trembling with restrained rage. How could Potter say this to him? He has confided in Potter before about his sixth year, and for him to mention it so flippantly like this… "How dare you." </p><p>"That was a low blow. I shouldn't have said that." Potter backpedals, putting his palms up. "I'm keeping you from your class. Go. Just go before we do something that we’ll regret." He tugs on his hair in frustration and takes a step back. </p><p>No. No, this doesn't make sense, this isn't logical, Potter has never backed down from a fight before. </p><p>He saunters towards Potter, like how he used to. "We should sort it out now, shouldn't we? Besides, we're adults now, no longer schoolboys itching for a fight. Perhaps we got off on the wrong foot, just like our first year. You want a welcome gift from me, Potter?" he taunts, his words as sudden and pointed as a volley of darts. He grabs Potter by the collar, and shoves him up against the wall. The hitch in their breaths tells Draco that they're thinking about the same thing. "Want me to kiss you again?" he says, sneering. "Did you miss it? Is that why you were so angry last night? Pissed that I didn’t run into your arms yesterday and snog you good and proper?" </p><p>It’s clear that Potter’s anger is escalating, his eyes sharpening in combat, and scorn quivering in his voice. "Fuck you, Malfoy. You're gonna throw this back in my face? I'm still waiting for you to tell me why you fucking left the Academy!"</p><p>Draco shouldn't enjoy goading Potter like this.</p><p>He really shouldn't.</p><p>"Boo fucking hoo, we're still harping about that, I see," Draco taunts, modulating the pitch of his voice into one that he knows will enrage Potter further. "Did I break your poor little heart? It was just one kiss, don't tell me that you—" </p><p>Draco doesn't have time to dodge Potter's fist when it flies towards his face.</p><p>"You bastard! You utter, fucking prick!" Draco hollers, cradling his jaw in his palm. The metallic tang of blood in his mouth propels him to further heights of fury. He lunges towards Potter, and they're rolling around on the floor in a tangle of punching and kicking limbs. </p><p>It's well and good to use magic to fight, but there's something primal and satisfying about going at it the old-fashioned way. This is familiar ground, this adrenaline rush as they provoke each other. The years fall away, and it’s just them in the halls of Hogwarts, the two of them locked in a passionate fight. It's gratifying and exhilarating, having all of Potter's attention on him. This is right, this is perfect... </p><p>This is how it should be. </p><p>"You deserved that, ferret, don't tell me you didn't!" Potter snarls through gritted teeth, staggering backwards after he receives an elbow to the ribs. Potter aims another punch at Draco's chest, but Draco is too agile, dodging the hit mere seconds before it lands. </p><p>"Going back to school nicknames again, are we? Let's see about that, Scarhead!” Draco grunts when a fist slams into his shoulder. He regroups quickly, hauling Potter close and hissing, “You couldn’t have missed me much, could you? All of your fucking conquests in the <i>Prophet.</i> Couldn’t keep it in your pants, eh? Tell me, how many did you take to the loo and kiss them like what you did to me?”</p><p>A noxious cocktail of jealousy, resentment and disappointment flares in Draco at the memory of opening the paper and seeing details of Potter’s love and sex life splashed on the gossip pages. Whenever he saw it, he would storm into his room for an angry wank. </p><p>“Jealous, are we?” Potter laughs maliciously, and he whispers, his breath gusting across Draco’s ear. “Is that what you want? Me sneaking out of your house in the dead of the night after a good, long shag? Having you so hard and fast ‘til you can’t walk properly the next morning?” </p><p>Draco’s thighs clench at once, lust surging at Potter’s words, but he tamps it down, forcing his rage back to centre stage. Incensed, he aims a fist at Potter’s side, but gasps in pain when Potter dodges and his knuckles connect with the floor instead. </p><p>"Learn how to punch, <i>bitch</i>!" Potter croons. </p><p>A collective gasp rings out a short distance away, and they both look up, freezing like a Kneazle in a <i>Lumos</i> when they see two separate crowds of students standing outside the adjacent classrooms, bristling with shock and excitement. Both men barely have enough time to react before Minerva hurries through, the students parting to make way for their Headmistress, who gasps in horror, her eyes widening behind her spectacles. </p><p>"Professor Malfoy, Mr Potter! What in heaven’s name is the meaning of this?" </p><p>They spring apart at once. Draco gazes at the students gaping at them, and humiliation washes over him, his face heating as rational thought finally catches up to his rash, impulsive actions. He’s a professor, he’s supposed to be setting an example. <i>Potter started it</i>, he is tempted to accuse, like he used to, but he swallows it down. They have no right to point fingers at each other.</p><p>He sneaks a glance at Potter, who looks equally aghast. “Professor,” Potter starts, then stops. “Minerva, I mean—“ </p><p>“I do not want to hear your excuses,” Minerva says, her voice laced with steel. “We will speak in my office.” She turns to the students, sweeping all of them with a stern eye. “Back to class, all of you!”</p><p>Although they dutifully shuffle back to their classrooms, Draco can still hear them whispering about the fight as Potter and him, with their heads bowed and shoulders slumped, trudge behind Minerva. The shame swirling in his belly magnifies at the thought of the entire school gossiping about this at lunch, and Draco glances at Potter. Potter is as dishevelled as him, hair sticking up at all ends, one arm of his glasses bent and his Quidditch leathers askew. There’s a bruise forming around his right eye. Draco’s jaw throbs with pain, his tongue feeling particularly heavy inside his mouth. </p><p>Potter gazes back, answering with an equally miserable look. </p><p>Minerva doesn’t spare them a glance the entire way, except when they’re at the Headmaster’s Tower, waiting for the circular, moving staircase to grind to a stop. At her disappointed look, Draco ducks his head and looks away briefly. She straightens her hat — she was walking so fast that it became crooked — and climbs the stairs. She doesn’t even wait for the door to close fully before ripping into them, skipping disapproval and sailing straight into outright anger. </p><p>“Never in Hogwarts’s illustrious history, have we had two teachers fighting like that! What an absolute disgrace!” she lashes out. </p><p>They recoil, shrinking away from her. </p><p>“The first people I have to lecture before lunch, on the first day of term, and it’s not even the students! The separate talks that I’ve had with the both of you seem to have fallen on deaf ears,” she continues, skewering them with a furious glare. “I was afraid that something like this would happen, but regressing into full-fledged fisticuffs, in front of the students?” She shakes her head in disgust. </p><p>Draco glances at the two large portraits, currently empty, hanging behind her desk. Thank goodness Dumbledore and Severus aren’t around to witness this mortifying tongue-lashing, although he knows they’ll learn about it eventually. </p><p>Minerva rounds on Draco, and he gulps. “Potter’s never had a good temper on him, but you’ve always been the more level-headed one. I was hoping that having been a professor here for three years, you would exhibit more restraint.” She fixes him with a hard stare. “Apparently, I was mistaken.”</p><p>Shame roils in Draco’s gut. </p><p>“I’m sorry, Headmistress,” Potter says in a small voice. </p><p>“My deepest apologies, Minerva,” Draco slurs, wincing at the pain radiating from his jaw. He has just enough time to patch it up with magic and some ointment in his chambers, and then hurry to his first class. “Please rest assured that it will never happen again.” </p><p>Minerva takes a deep breath and steps back, calming down. “If there is another altercation, I will sentence the both of you to detention.” At their protests, she raises a hand, and they fall silent. “If you are to act like students, you will be punished like so. One more time, whether it is a physical fight or a nasty exchange of words, and you will be scrubbing out cauldrons and wiping down old trophies.” She looks at her watch, and then regards them over her spectacles, her lips pressed into a thin line of dismay. “Now, off with you. I believe that you have your seventh-years to teach, Professor Malfoy.”</p><p>Draco nods, and Potter mumbles another apology. Suitably chastised, they turn tail and flee. They look at each other only when they’ve descended the staircase, and Draco sees his own guilt and weariness reflected in sad green eyes. </p><p>This scenario is not new — they’ve been in a similar situation before, standing in numb silence outside Robards’s office after being yelled at for fighting during a duelling session in the Academy. </p><p>
  <i>What is it about Potter that makes me act out like this?</i>
</p><p>Without a word, they turn and walk off in opposite directions.</p><hr/><p>Draco wraps his cloak tighter around his shoulders when a sudden wind gusts through the pitch. One of the first-years yelps when his broom lurches, and Potter quickly waves his wand in his direction to stabilise him.</p><p>It’s two weeks into term, and Draco’s watching the flying lesson for the first-year Slytherin and Gryffindor students. He always makes it a point to attend every year if he’s not teaching, keen on assessing each cohort. Slytherin won the Quidditch Cup for the past two years, much to Charlie’s dismay, and Draco is eager to see their winning streak continue. </p><p>However, this year’s class appears to be quite… different. </p><p>Although most of the students are in the air, with more accomplished fliers circling a small area of the pitch, Potter is also keeping a watchful eye on four first-years — three Gryffindors and one Slytherin (Leo Thompson) — who are kicking a ball around. They’re not divided into teams; they’re still familiarising themselves with running and passing the ball to each other. </p><p>Draco recognises the activity as Muggle football; out of curiosity, he and Pansy have watched a few games shown on televisions in Parisian sports bars. However, they certainly weren’t as interested in the game per se, focusing more on the players.</p><p>When Leo takes a rough tumble on the grass, Potter steps towards him, but stops when one of the Gryffindors — Jason… White, if Draco isn’t wrong — offers him a hand. “Alright there, Leo?” Potter calls. When Leo nods and promptly returns to the game, Potter smiles and turns his attention to the fliers, refreshing the cushioning charms for some students and barking at others when they fly too high or ascend too quickly. </p><p>Once again, Draco finds his gaze returning to Potter, who is dressed in very Muggle exercise attire — a dark blue T-shirt (sure, it’s a Magpies T-shirt, but still), knee-length shorts and running shoes. Draco certainly isn’t complaining, though — he’s too busy admiring the way the shirt stretches across Potter’s shoulder blades and his taut stomach. Although Potter’s body isn’t the broad-shouldered and bulging muscles type (like Charlie), he still looks brilliant, keeping his lithe frame as a Seeker. His knees are still as knobbly, and Salazar, he looks even fitter now. Draco eyes his well-developed calves, the smooth gait when he runs, and the tendons shifting in his strong forearms when he adjusts the positioning of a student on her broom.</p><p>After a while, Potter claps his hands. “That’s all the time we’ve got today, you lot! You’ve got just enough time to wash up before dinner.” </p><p>“Aw, we don’t wanna stop!” Jason yells. He kicks the ball up into the air, and Leo lunges forward to catch it. “Can we team up and score goals next time? I want Leo on my team.” </p><p>Draco smiles when Leo breaks into a toothy grin and nods fervently. “Could we, please, Mr Potter? It’ll be loads of fun!” </p><p>Out of his first-years, Leo — an only child — is the shy one, keeping mostly to himself during lessons, and Draco is pleased to see him step out of his shell like this. </p><p>“Yeah, we can do teams, if everyone’s keen on that,” Potter replies. </p><p>The four football players grab their House robes, which are scattered on the ground, and shrug them on. Leo and Jason wave goodbye to each other before re-joining their fellow housemates. Draco watches as the students head back to the castle, nodding at them when they greet him.  </p><p>Potter jogs over to him. “Hey.” </p><p>Draco gives him a small, tentative smile. This is their first conversation since the fight, and he’s uncertain as to how Potter would react. “Good evening.” He gestures to the jumble of brooms. “I trust my students haven’t been giving you trouble?” </p><p>“Nope.” Potter picks up his water bottle and takes a long, deep drink.</p><p>Draco’s eyes linger on the bob of his Adam’s apple.  </p><p>Potter wipes his mouth with the back of his hand. “Unlike us. We were a right nightmare to Hooch, yeah?” He tosses the bottle on the grass and sits down on the stands beside Draco. “With Neville’s Remembrall,” he adds, chuckling. </p><p>Draco groans at the memory. “If I had known that that would make you the youngest Seeker in a century, I wouldn’t have done that at all.” He sits up straight, focusing on his second purpose of attending today’s lesson. “I’ve been a prat since my first year here as a student, and once again, at your first year on the faculty. I would like to apologise for that day. You clearly backed off, but I was the one that goaded you.” He indicates Potter’s eye. “I’m glad that your injury has healed.” </p><p>“Yeah, it’s been two weeks.” Potter looks at his jaw. “Yours?”</p><p>“It’s alright now, although I was slurring quite a bit during my first class that day.” </p><p>Potter sighs. “I’m sorry, too. I let my temper get the better of me. Charlie gave me a right talking-to when I went over to his hut to rant about things.” </p><p>“For what it’s worth, he told me off too,” Draco says, casting his mind back to Charlie storming into his quarters after dinner that evening, demanding his side of the story. The aftermath of the fight was awful, whispers breaking out around Draco when he passed students in corridors, and the rest of the faculty being on edge when Potter and he were in the same room. It took a few days for the furore to fade.   </p><p>“I’m tired of fighting,” Potter says. </p><p>“I am, too.” Draco blinks rapidly when the other man inches closer. </p><p>“Good to know we’re on the same page,” Potter says, his words soft and his eyes intense. </p><p>Having him in such close proximity after so long is driving Draco’s heartrate up. His dreams of Potter have become more vivid since the fight, and in one dream, they ended up shagging after the fight, with Potter climbing on top of him, hitching up his robes and—</p><p>“I assume that’s the Muggle part of your classes? The football?” Draco asks hurriedly, pointing at the ball to restrain the overwhelming urge to slide his hand up Potter’s thigh, exactly what he did in a dream, sweet Salazar—</p><p>“Yeah. I wanted to shake things up a bit, because simply providing one sport — Quidditch — for the entire school seems quite limiting to me,” Potter says. “I know it’s worked for ages, but perhaps it’s time for a change, y’know? Quidditch isn’t for everyone. Like Hermione, she didn’t fancy it at all, so she felt rather excluded.” </p><p>Draco recalls Pansy’s uncertainty at the sport, although he can’t imagine her kicking a ball around the field, either. </p><p>“Take Leo, for example. He’s scared of heights, and a few Muggle-born students aren’t keen on flying,” Potter continues. “Of course, I encourage them to try it out, but I don’t see any point in forcing them, in making them feel inferior if their friends are rocketing around on a broom.” His voice drops, and he looks away. “No child should feel inferior, to feel like they don’t belong.” </p><p>Draco knows bits and pieces about Potter’s childhood, titbits of information revealed by Potter himself during their time together in the Academy. He knows that his Muggle relatives didn’t treat him well, but he’s hardly privy to the full extent of things, not having wanted to push Potter too much on such an intensely private matter.</p><p>“Well, it’s obvious they enjoyed football,” Draco says, hoping to smooth over the sudden tension.  </p><p>Potter brightens. “They did, yeah? Having a few sports to try out would make things exciting, and the exercise would help their fitness and to relax from homework and school, too.” </p><p>Draco leans forward with interest. “It seems like you plan to introduce more than football.”</p><p>“Yeah!” Potter says, warming up to his theme. “Football and basketball are definitely things I’d like to include this term. If there are some kids who aren’t interested in competitive sports, running and calisthenics are also possible. I’d like to add tennis, and maybe rugby for the older kids, but I’m really just starting, I’ve still got to sort out the space constraints and demand for each sport.” He pauses, frowning. “Swimming would be interesting, but I reckon including proper exercise attire like shorts and sports shoes in the students’ packing list this term has raised enough eyebrows already.” </p><p>“Where did you get all of these new ideas from?” </p><p>“From my training with the Magpies. A few of us wanted to do something different, so we went to Seamus and Dean’s Muggle sports complex — I don’t know if you’ve been there before — and tried out loads of things. I’m not an expert on everything, of course.” </p><p>“These different alternatives sound intriguing.” Potter’s enthusiasm is infectious, and Draco finds himself nodding along with him.</p><p>“They can sign up for the sports they wanna try. I’d like to get them to mix around outside of their houses too, so they’ll be separated based on sports, and not by years or Houses. Don’t worry, I won’t change anything about Quidditch, if you’re worried about that?” </p><p>Draco laughs. “No, I think you’re more than capable enough to sort this out.” He’s heard from his older students that Potter is much more hands-on than Rolanda, attending Quidditch team trials for all the Houses.       </p><p>“D’you want to come and sit in on a class one day?” Potter looks intently at Draco, eyes sparkling with interest behind his glasses. “I’ve still got to look at their sign-ups and sort out the schedule, but you should come and watch, maybe even participate.” He rubs his earrings with a thumb and an index finger, saying uncertainly, “I mean, if you’d like to.” </p><p>“We’ll see about that,” Draco says, cushioning the ambiguity of his answer with a smile. He glances at his watch. “I have to go for dinner now, I’ve got to work on the content for Duelling Club this term. The first session starts in early October.”</p><p>“Sure.” Potter stands up and stretches, revealing a strip of tanned skin and the jut of his hip. “Can I come and watch? Would bring back memories.” </p><p>“If you’d like to,” Draco says, standing up too and brushing his robes down. He glances at the pile of broomsticks and the lone football, tempted to spend more time with Potter under the guise of helping him to pack up. However, today’s progress is good enough, and with their volatile relationship, Draco doesn’t want to risk any chance of ruining this fragile truce.   </p><p>“Have a good night, Potter.” </p><p>“See ya around,” he replies with an easy smile.   </p><p>As Draco walks back to the castle, he can feel Potter’s eyes on him.</p><hr/><p>It's brilliant seeing Malfoy in his element.</p><p>He moves out of Harry's sight, threading his way through the duelling groups of seventh-year Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs. Harry quickly pushes away from the southern wall of the Middle Courtyard and steals through the row of stone pillars, discreetly keeping Malfoy in his view. Harry loves how he moves — that graceful, long-legged stride, and his soft blond hair rustling in the late afternoon breeze — as he paces amongst the students, pausing every few steps to correct their inflection or wand technique. For once, Malfoy's not dressed in his robes, and Harry basks in the sight of Malfoy in dark-grey trousers (that hugs his arse just right, goddamn) and plain black button-down shirt with the sleeves rolled up to his elbows. His Mark is obvious, but neither he nor his students seem to care. </p><p>A warmth of nostalgia envelops Harry, and he smiles — it reminds him so much of Dumbledore's Army. He recalls his own duel with Malfoy during Duelling Club in their second year, and tries to remember the exact sequence of spells cast. </p><p>Malfoy stops beside a pair. He exchanges words with them, accompanied by sketching wand movements in the air with his hands. He takes the place of one student, engaging the Hufflepuff in combat while her partner watches. Intrigued, Harry sits on a bench, staying in the shadows as he rakes Malfoy's form with an admiring gaze. Compared to Auror training, Malfoy's movements are more fluid and precise as he trades a flurry of spells with the student. His concentration is tight and intense as he picks apart the cracks in his opponent's advanced shield charm and follows up with an <i>Expelliarmus</i>, sending her wand sailing through the air, and into the hand of her partner.</p><p>After providing a few more pointers, Malfoy looks up at the spot along the wall where Harry had been, frowning when he doesn't see him. </p><p>Harry grins.</p><p>Grey eyes scan the vicinity, and Malfoy's expression relaxes when Harry meets his gaze.</p><p>They're so busy staring at each other that Harry doesn't notice the stunning spell flying towards him, hitting the floor just centimetres away from his leg, cracking the tile. He leaps up at once, his hand snapping to his wand. </p><p>"Sorry, Mr Potter!" yells a horrified Ravenclaw a few pairs away. Harry waves back, signalling that it's alright. The students quieten down at the outburst, craning their heads to look at Harry.</p><p>"Say, Professor Malfoy," Carina Lee — Harry recognises her from basketball — a Hufflepuff, pipes up. "When you were in school with Mr Potter, weren't you in the Duelling Club together?"</p><p>"Yes, but our professor was Gilderoy Lockhart, who wasn't really much of a teacher, to be honest," Malfoy replies. </p><p>"Well, I think it'd be really cool if we could watch a duel between you and Mr Potter," Carina says, amidst a ringing chorus of agreement from the others. </p><p>Malfoy blinks at them, startled. "I'm sure Mr Potter didn't plan on duelling anyone today, and it's hardly fair to expect him to do so." </p><p>"Most of us have been training in order to enter the Academy," Carina points out. "Wouldn't it be useful to watch a duel between two highly skilled wizards such as Mr Potter and yourself?" </p><p>Harry raises his eyebrows. He didn't know that these were potential Auror candidates — this explains why their spells are a lot more polished than he expected. </p><p>Another round of encouragement ripples across the crowd. Malfoy's eyes flicker to Harry. "I... well..." It's clear that his protests are crumbling in the face of his students' enthusiasm, and only then does Harry move closer, not wanting to agree to something that Malfoy truly objects to; this is his class, after all.  </p><p>The crowd parts to make way for Harry, and he stands in front of Malfoy. He lifts his hands, raising his palms upwards, and a corner of his lips quirk up into a smirk. He shrugs nonchalantly. "I'm game if Professor Malfoy is."</p><p>Malfoy's eyes widen, and his hand clenches around his wand. </p><p>Harry's throwing down his gauntlet, and there's no way in hell that Malfoy will back down from a challenge like this. </p><p>Malfoy's mouth turns up into a slow smile. "It's on then, Mr Potter." </p><p>A thrill shivers in Harry at the way he says <i>Mr Potter.</i> </p><p>The students cheer, and they retreat to a safe distance, settling down on the stone benches lining the courtyard. </p><p>Harry hasn't taken his eyes off Malfoy, and neither has the other man. The remains of an amused smile lingers on Malfoy's lips, although his eyes are serious. Snapshots of memories zip through Harry's mind like quicksilver: of their practise duels in the Academy, their fights during the War, and lastly, standing in the Great Hall with their wands raised like this in front of a crowd bristling with excitement, when they were twelve, with Lockhart behind him and Snape behind Malfoy.</p><p>
  <i>"Scared, Potter?" </i>
</p><p><i>"You wish."</i> </p><p>It feels like it was yesterday.  </p><p>They incline their heads. </p><p>"Just think of it as my contribution to training the next generation of Aurors," Harry mutters. </p><p>"Still so damn full of yourself, Potter," Malfoy whispers, a twinkle in his eye. </p><p>Harry's grin widens.</p><p>They whirl around, their backs towards each other. </p><p>Something tightens in the pit of Harry's belly — the coiling of a nervous, exhilarating energy that is all too familiar — like the sensation right before he dives fast and hard into a Wronski Feint. </p><p>He takes a step away. </p><p>One.  </p><p>There's a reason why Malfoy was considered one of the best duellers in their Auror batch, why Harry enjoyed fighting him the most. When they fight, it's almost like a conversation, a dance between two equally matched partners, each with strangely compatible strengths and weaknesses.  </p><p>Two. </p><p>
  <i>Weak spot: his left ankle, chronic injury during a stakeout. Favours his right side, so attack on his left. He's quicker, more defensive and skilled in wandless magic, but I'm stronger with better offenses.</i>
</p><p>Three. </p><p>Harry turns.   </p><p>
  <i>Prone to nostalgia when it comes to me, which means he'll start off with—</i>
</p><p><i>"Everte Statum!"</i> Malfoy cries, kicking things off with his first spell cast during their Duelling Club debacle. But Harry's ready for it, so he shrugs off this second-year jinx with a weak defence charm. </p><p><i>"Rictusempra!"</i> Harry shouts, silver light shooting out from his wand. The only pronounced effect the Tickling Charm has on Malfoy is a loud, piercing giggle, and he quickly covers his wheezing mouth, although his shoulders are still shaking as he ends the spell. He didn't block it, which tells Harry he's expecting this harmless charm. </p><p>
  <i>Did you think I'd forget, Malfoy?</i>
</p><p>When Malfoy aims at Harry's knees, Harry sprints towards the large marble fountain of the four founders in the middle of the courtyard, leaping behind it to hide his legs. <i>His Dancing Feet Spell needs a clear view of my legs to work.</i> He smiles at Malfoy’s frustrated snarl, and pokes his head out, peering around Rowena Ravenclaw's ample bosom and ransacking his mind for Snape's counter-curse to Malfoy's next spell.</p><p>
  <i>"Serpensortia!"</i>
</p><p>A long, black snake emerges from the tip of Malfoy's wand, and a collective gasp rings out from the students. Harry leaves the shelter of the fountain and saunters towards the snake. It turns, its forked tongue flicking at him as it raises itself.</p><p>Harry tilts his head thoughtfully at it. <i>"Sorry,"</i> he says. <i>"Vipera Evanesca!"</i></p><p>The snake vanishes in a column of black smoke. </p><p>Malfoy laughs, a clear, bright sound of delight that elicits a smirk from Harry. Their eyes meet, and a buzzing anticipation sings in Harry's blood at Malfoy's wicked grin.  </p><p>
  <i>Come on, Potter. Enough of the warm-up. Let's give them a proper show.</i>
</p><p>They circle each other warily. </p><p>
  <i>You asked for it.</i>
</p><p><i>"Expelliarmus!"</i> Harry cries, and Malfoy's wand flies out of his hand. But Malfoy merely flicks his fingers lazily, murmuring the counter spell, and his wand hangs, suspended, in mid-air, before hurtling back into his palm in an impressive display of wandless magic and reflexes. </p><p>
  <i>So predictable, Potter. Your signature spell, again. Did the Academy teach you nothing?</i>
</p><p>Harry fires off a particularly vicious stunning spell towards Malfoy's left ankle, the curse so potent that the air around its path shimmers. Malfoy barely has time to dodge and collect his wits to throw up a Shield Charm.     </p><p>
  <i>I'm not playing around anymore, Malfoy. It's your left ankle that's problematic, isn't it?</i>
</p><p><i>"Accio</i> Harry Potter's glasses!" Malfoy calls. Harry's glasses jump off his face, and his world is thrown into a confusing blur of shapes and colours, but he doesn't panic. Without missing a beat, he grips his wand and casts a formidable summoning spell in the general vicinity. His glasses zoom back into his outstretched palm, and he quickly puts them on. Summoning his glasses is second nature, drilled into him by Robards.</p><p>"You're hardly trying—" he starts, but stops abruptly. </p><p>Malfoy is gone.</p><p><i>Come and get me, Potter.</i> </p><p>Harry blinks, and he nudges his glasses higher up his nose. Malfoy couldn't have cursed his glasses, could he? He glances at the students, who are fully absorbed in the duel, but are not giving him any clues about Malfoy's whereabouts. He whirls around on the spot, scanning the environment for anything suspicious, perhaps hints of shoes sinking into the grass or a shimmer in the air, but comes up short.</p><p><i>He must be Disillusioned.</i> Before Harry can cast any scouting charms, there's a whisper to his left, and he spins around to see a white jet of light coming his way — a body-bind curse. He dodges, but he's not fast enough; the curse grazes his right calf, and he stumbles, his leg growing numb. It's not a full body-bind curse, and it's weak enough to fade away within seconds. Harry looks at Malfoy when he re-emerges on his left. </p><p><i>I should've cast revealing charms sooner.</i> Harry frowns at his rusty duelling skills, and then jabs his wand at Malfoy. <i>"Silencio!"</i> he shouts, and Malfoy's eyes widen. He opens his mouth, but only a croak comes forth. Looking wonderfully cornered, he backs away towards the eastern wall of the courtyard.  </p><p><i>I’ve got you where I want you, Malfoy.</i> </p><p>Harry grins in triumph, and he advances with increasing speed, the tingling in his leg already gone, replaced by another burst of adrenaline sending his heart pumping. His smile fades, and his follow-up curse wilts on his lips when Malfoy smirks and twirls his wand at two suits of armour standing guard nearby. </p><p>Harry gapes when the suits of armour judder to life, as if waking from a deep slumber. Some students let out impressed gasps, while a handful cry out in alarm, flinching away from the animated suits when they jump down from the plinths, their large and heavy shields raised. Malfoy scuttles behind the suits, seeking refuge as the enchanted soldiers march towards Harry. </p><p>
  <i>It's a delaying tactic until my Silencing Charm wears off.</i>
</p><p>Determined, Harry shoots a stunner at their shields, but he's the one that ends up evading the rebounded curse when the shields deflect it. He knows a variant of the Reductor Curse that is strong enough to blast them into pieces, and he raises his wand, poised.</p><p>
  <i>I don’t reckon you’d like another trip to the Headmistress’ office, this time for destroying school property, eh, Potter?</i>
</p><p>Harry growls in frustration, dismissing the curse. <i>I can't approach them head-on</i>. He swerves to the right, trying to catch a space large enough to squeeze a curse, but the soldiers are too responsive to Malfoy's movements, staying right in front of him. After a brief standoff, the suits of armour stand to attention and salute Malfoy, before clomping back to their resting places. </p><p>Harry is ready with a <i>Protego</i> when Malfoy shoots a stinging jinx and stunning curse in quick succession.  </p><p>
  <i>Are those your defenders? Well, I've got mine too.</i>
</p><p>Without thinking, Harry huffs in irritation and casts a Patronus Charm, drawing gasps of admiration from the students when his large stag bursts into life, cantering around him and rearing back on its hind legs. </p><p>At Malfoy's stricken expression, Harry freezes. He's no doubt thinking about the Auror training when they practised their Patronus Charms, and Malfoy was the only one who failed. He stormed out, humiliated and distraught. </p><p><i>"You don't get it, do you, Potter?! Death Eaters, with the exception of Severus, can't cast lovely and wholesome things like Patronuses, guardians of the good and holy!"</i> </p><p>Malfoy is still staring into empty space when Harry's stag disappears. Murmurs are breaking out amongst the students, and Harry's heart clenches in dismay. Malfoy may be able to teach his students the proper technique of the Patronus Charm, but Harry heard that he still can’t produce one of his own. Isn't it bloody ironic, that a Defence professor can't produce a Patronus when it's in the sixth-year syllabus? </p><p>He jolts Malfoy out of his daze by shooting an Impediment Jinx — a tame duelling spell — purposely missing him by a few centimetres. This does the trick, and the fiery, determined expression in furious grey eyes gives Harry a warning of what is about to come. </p><p><i>Bring it on, Potter!</i> </p><p>Malfoy rushes towards him, and even though Harry holds his ground, his opponent is on an all-out offensive. They trade a barrage of curses, and Harry is backing away to the middle of the courtyard, his wand whipping in the air with defensive charms, which is honestly not his forte. He ducks an <i>Expelliarmus</i>, and he turns, facing the fountain. He flicks his wand at the water splashing in the fountain, directing it towards Malfoy, who throws a barrier charm in front of himself while advancing, thinking that Harry means to aim the water to his person. </p><p>But that's not what he's planning. </p><p>Harry orders the flood of water to the ground in front of Malfoy, forming a slick puddle on the grass, already slippery from the earlier rain. Malfoy yelps as he skids on the ground, his left ankle slipping. He crashes, and he lets out a piteous moan, cradling his ankle in his hands.</p><p>
  <i>Oh God, I've done it again, I've gone too far, like what Robards keeps telling me—</i>
</p><p>Worried, Harry hurries over. "I'm sorry, I didn't mean—" </p><p>He breaks off into a cry when something long and thin loops around his ankles. He looks down — the blades of grass underneath his feet are transfigured into lashing vines under Malfoy's muttered spell. The vines give a hard yank backwards, and Harry shouts, his arms braced for impact as he crashes to the ground, right beside Malfoy. </p><p>"I think we're finished, yes?" Malfoy mutters out of the corner of his mouth. </p><p>"Yeah," Harry says, kicking his legs free when the vines retreat, shrinking into grass. </p><p>Malfoy stands up, his left ankle perfectly fine. "And that's how you do it," he says to the students. He bends down and offers a hand to Harry, who accepts it. He hauls Harry up from the ground to the sound of applause. </p><p>"A few lessons you can learn from this," Malfoy says, addressing the class. He counts them off his fingers. "Use the environment to your advantage, have a wide variety of spells at your arsenal, the utility of disillusionment charms, and knowing your enemy, especially if you've fought him before. It is also useful to be physically responsive with excellent reflexes." He gestures to Harry. "And that's why I highly recommend participating in Mr Potter's lessons — they will go a long way in developing your reflexes.</p><p>"The next Hufflepuff-Ravenclaw meeting will be next Saturday, same time, at the Hufflepuff's area — the Training Grounds. I will be conducting a session for the Gryffindors and Slytherins at The Quad tomorrow. Similar to today, I will be revising the same spells that we explored last year since today is the first Duelling Club session of the year. If you would like to brush up on today's spells, please feel free to drop by. Class dismissed." </p><p>The students shuffle out of the courtyard after thanking them, amidst excited chatters about the duel.</p><p>"Thank you for being so sporting about this," Malfoy says, finger-combing his hair. </p><p>"The trick you did with the armour just now... is it a faculty-wide thing?" Harry asks, curious. </p><p>Malfoy chuckles. "I knew you would ask me about that. Yes, all faculty have always had the ability to activate the suits of armour, but now, we may animate them wandlessly and non-verbally. Minerva tweaked that after the War. She might have forgotten to teach you. Perhaps you should ask her about it at dinner."  </p><p>"Wow, that's really wicked," Harry says, perking up at the image of him leading an army of soldiers. He frowns and quickly pushes that thought away — that means Hogwarts would need protecting from grave danger, and he definitely doesn’t want that again. </p><p>"About the Patronus..." he says, trailing off when Malfoy's jaw tightens. “I didn't mean to mock you or anything like that. It was just... instinct." He looks down, scuffing his trainer on a patch of grass. "I hope you don't take it the wrong way." </p><p>He receives a small smile in return. "Thank you for clarifying things with me." </p><p>Harry is tempted to swallow his offer; he doesn't want to offend Malfoy. They've struck up a tenuous friendship — comfortable, easy conversation during mealtimes, and even going out to the Three Broomsticks for a pint with Charlie once — and he doesn't want to upset this fragile connection between them.</p><p>But he says it anyway.</p><p>"Would you like me to teach you the Patronus Charm?" he asks, although he steels himself for Malfoy’s lashing out. </p><p>Instead, Malfoy considers the question, and his answer elicits a hopeful smile from Harry.</p><p>"You know what, Potter? I might take you up on your offer one day."</p><hr/><p>Draco gazes at Albus Dumbledore’s name, one of the many inscribed into the smooth dark-grey marble of the war memorial. His eyes slowly scan the other names, lingering at those that he is personally acquainted with — Vincent Crabbe, Lavender Brown, Severus Snape — and so many others. </p><p>The first time he saw the memorial containing the names of Hogwarts-affiliated deaths, when confronted with the loss of life inflicted by his side during the War, he broke down in inconsolable tears, whispering apologies as tremendous, crippling guilt and grief flooded him. For months after, he avoided this area on the seventh floor. Now, he’s sitting on the lone bench in front of the memorial, threads of melancholy tugging on his heart. He sighs and raises his wand, conjuring a wreath of flowers and adds it to the small pile of flowers and cards — no doubt left behind by some students and other professors — at the foot of the memorial. </p><p>His watch chimes midnight, and the golden sheen on some of the names fade away. A few other names acquire an identical golden shade — the memorial is charmed to recognise the birthdays of the fallen. </p><p>Three full years here as a professor, and there’s still one place that he hasn’t set foot in — the Astronomy Tower. He looks at Dumbledore’s name, and then bows his head, recalling the Battle of the Lightning-Struck Tower. </p><p>A sound behind him jolts him out of his wretched memories, and he whirls around. </p><p>Potter is standing there, dressed in a T-shirt, jeans and Converse trainers. He shuffles from foot to foot, and raises his hand in a small wave. In return, Draco nods at him, and after a second, tilts his head to the empty space beside him on the bench.</p><p>“Can’t sleep too?” Potter says, taking the proffered seat. </p><p>It’s rather strange how the fire in the sconces flare once, before dimming slightly, lending a soft, cosy atmosphere. The reflection of firelight dances on Potter’s glasses and earrings. </p><p>“Yes,” Draco says. “Sleep evades me, on some nights.” He excludes mentioning his occasional nightmares.</p><p>“Yeah, me too. So I thought I’d join you, if you don’t mind.” </p><p>Draco frowns. “How did you know I’m here?” </p><p>“Er.” Potter’s eyes dart around. “Lucky guess.” </p><p>“Alright,” Draco says. He’s not convinced with the answer, but he leaves it at that.</p><p>A long pause.</p><p>Potter shifts around on the bench. “We don’t have to talk if you don’t want to,” he whispers. </p><p>“I know.” </p><p>They lapse into a companionable silence, and for once, Potter — usually brimming with energy — is content to sit as they each pay their respects in their own way. The quiet is broken briefly when Potter conjures a bunch of flowers, stands up and lays it beside the pile of tributes. </p><p>Time ticks by, and Draco watches with half-lidded eyes as Potter paces along the memorial and drags his hand on the cool marble, grazing his fingers past the carved names. He stops, and turns to Draco. “Why Defence Against the Dark Arts? You’ve always been better at Potions,” he blurts out, before pressing his lips together. “Sorry, I was just thinking that, you don’t have to answer if you don’t want to. We don’t have to talk.” </p><p>“It’s alright,” Draco says. “I had the option of teaching either Defence or Potions; the Defence position was officially vacant when I learnt of it, and Horace is considering retirement, so if I wanted, I could have gone for Potions instead. But I chose Defence, because…” he trails off, wondering how to put it best into words. </p><p>Potter sits down beside him, giving him an encouraging smile. </p><p>“I’m sure you recall my trick with the Vanishing Cabinets,” Draco says, glossing over the horrid details of that night on purpose. </p><p>Potter hesitates, and then nods. </p><p>“By coming up with that… stunt,” he continues, laughing mirthlessly at that euphemism, “I demonstrated that Hogwarts, the safest magical stronghold in wizarding Britain, was no longer safe. That it could no longer protect, nor defend its students.” His hands curl into fists, a familiar surge of self-directed anger rising. “I was the person that breached this sanctuary, bringing Death Eaters, practitioners of the Dark Arts, into the castle. I wanted to make things right again. And so, I chose to teach Defence Against the Dark Arts.” </p><p>He remembers the day when he signed his teaching contract in Minerva’s office, the ink drying on the parchment as he stared up at Dumbledore, who was beaming at him from his portrait. Beside him, Severus was looking at Draco, his black eyes giving nothing away, but the twitch of his lips was a semblance of a smile. After Draco concluded his business with Minerva, he approached Dumbledore’s portrait. </p><p>“Welcome home, Draco,” the old, wise wizard said. </p><p>“Thank you, sir,” Draco croaked, swallowing the emotion thickening in his throat. He turned to Severus, who sniffed and flicked his robes in his usual dramatic fashion. </p><p>“I certainly hope you plan on taking over the position of Head of Slytherin House from Horace, Draco. It’s bad enough seeing how the walrus-shaped dunderhead teaches Potions.” </p><p>A burst of unexpected laughter came from Draco, who immediately clapped a hand to his mouth, while Minerva barked out an admonishing <i>“Severus, please!”</i> </p><p>Potter’s chortle brings Draco back to the present. </p><p>“Did Snape really call Slughorn a walrus-shaped dunderhead?” he says, his shoulders shaking with laughter. </p><p>“Yes, he certainly did.” </p><p>“Nice to see he’s still as sharp-tongued as ever,” Potter remarks. “When I went to look for McGonagall on my first day, he asked me if decent combs were in short supply after the war,” he says, gesturing to his messy head of hair.  </p><p>They share a smile. </p><p>“I took over the Head of Slytherin position from Horace in my second year,” Draco says. “It was clear that Slytherins were still being discriminated against, which comes as no surprise after the War. It was horrid, seeing terrified first-years being sorted into Slytherin and most of the student population booing them. A bit like how it was when we were students,” he says, arching a brow at Potter. </p><p>He doesn’t wait for a reply, and powers on, his voice spiralling upwards in volume and vehemence. “We were children! On hindsight, how could people, even teachers, assume that all Slytherins have a penchant for the Dark Arts, labelling us evil right off the bat? Did no one stop to think that perhaps Slytherins turned bad <i>because</i> of the stereotypes that boxed us in? Certainly, most of us were close-minded and prejudiced against Muggle-borns and Muggles, but we were raised to subscribe to that doctrine. Would it not be more rewarding to nurture us, to show us that we could be successful without resorting to the Dark Arts?</p><p>“Now, I’m in a position to influence positive change. I’ve developed programmes to encourage mixing of the Houses, such as reinstating the Duelling Club. Although things are better, there are still pockets of discrimination, such as bullying, especially against the younger Slytherins, inflicted by students whose families were slaughtered by Death Eaters.” Draco sighs. “I can only hope that time and education will erode the centuries-old prejudice against Slytherins, and the mentality of Slytherins against the world.” </p><p>Potter simply looks at Draco, his lips parted and eyes wide. </p><p>Self-conscious, Draco clears his throat and looks down, relaxing his clenched fists and planting his palms on the edge of the bench. He uncrosses his ankles. “My apologies. Was I ranting? I didn’t mean to bore you.” </p><p>“No, not at all! It’s brilliant hearing this from you. That’s what I feel too, although I probably can’t express it as eloquently,” Potter says, and his earnest tone makes Draco look up. </p><p>“Yes, I see that in your classes, how you promote house unity. I like how you’re granting the opportunity for students from different Houses to try out different sports,” Draco says. Part of him is very curious about Potter’s classes, ever since Charlie bounded into his office one day, grass stains on his knees and mud smeared on his cheek, raving about Potter’s “refreshingly fun” football training. “Are my students playing fair?” </p><p>Potter winces. “Er.” </p><p>“You can tell me the truth. I harbour no delusions about them, and I certainly know that old traditions die hard.” </p><p>“Some of them really are quite rough, especially the older kids, and they tend to exploit loopholes in the rules. It was a problem earlier this term, but things have settled down when they know I can be mighty stern when I want to be.” </p><p>Draco nods. “That’s good to know.” </p><p>There’s a lull in the conversation, and they both look ahead to the memorial. </p><p>“Strange how it feels like nothing has changed,” Potter pipes up after a moment, motioning to the restored hall and repaired corridors beyond this room. </p><p>Draco laughs. “It wasn’t like this when I first joined the faculty. It was obvious that the castle was furious at me for undermining her defences.” </p><p>Potter frowns. “Angry… at you? You talk as if Hogwarts can feel emotions.”</p><p>“I will not be surprised if the castle exhibits signs of being sentient, having played host to a staggering amount of magical objects, witches and wizards for centuries,” Draco says. “My bed was cold, despite my numerous warming charms, the taps in my en-suite wouldn’t work, the locks in my room would jam, the fire in the sconces dying out whenever I stepped into a corridor. If I was alone during night patrol, my only light would be my <i>Lumos</i>. There were many, many instances when the castle made it very clear that I was far from welcome.”</p><p>“How did you make things better?” </p><p>“I helped in its repair, and I think the passage of time helped too, once the castle knew I had no more malicious intents towards it.” </p><p>Although the façade, along with key classrooms and structures of the castle were already repaired by the faculty, there were still some obscure wings, locked doors, neglected staircases and burnt portraits, waiting for someone patient and thorough enough to restore them to their former glory. Draco laboriously spent his free time during his first year repairing things here and there, until the castle finally stopped acting up. </p><p>“Now, it almost likes me,” Draco says with an affectionate smile, glancing up at the walls and the lights. He addresses the castle. “Don’t you?”</p><p>The castle’s response is a warm breeze surging through the windows, and a further dimming of the fire. Tendrils of moonlight glimmer on the floor, stretching towards the base of the memorial. It is comfortable, peaceful and soporific, and Draco’s eyelids are heavy. His shoulders slump and his body relaxes, releasing the coiled-up tension gathered during his monologue about his House. He could sit here and talk to Potter for hours, perhaps even fall asleep, curled up in Potter’s arms until the warmth of dawn approaches. </p><p>Already, his head is tipping over towards Potter, and it must be his imagination when the other man inches closer to him.</p><p>This is very peculiar; in all these years, the castle has never acted like this.  </p><p>
  <i>I don’t know what, but Hogwarts is up to something.</i>
</p><p>Frowning, Draco shakes away the slumber tugging at his senses, and he straightens up, rubbing his eyes. “I think I shall go to bed. Goodnight, Potter. Don’t stay up too late.” </p><p>The lights go out for a second, as if the castle exhaled very heavily, before they fire up again.</p><p><i>Very, very curious.</i> </p><p>“Goodnight, Malfoy,” comes the reply, accompanied by a wave and an easy smile.</p><p>Draco moves towards the door, but before he crosses over the threshold, he turns back and gazes at Potter’s back.</p><p>When they first stepped into Hogwarts as students sixteen years ago, they were rivals, and pawns in a war that started before their births. </p><p>Now, they’re teachers, and things couldn’t be more different.</p><hr/><p>Draco wakes up to an unusually pleasant Saturday morning. He yawns and rolls over in bed, pushing his face into his pillow, absorbing the calm swish of the waters sounding from the window, which looks out into the Great Lake. There’s a soft tap on the glass, and he lifts his head up, waving back at the Giant Squid’s tentacle, ghosting through the swaying seaweed.  </p><p>The colour of the water is much lighter than its usual dark greenish tinge, indicating that sunlight is streaming through the lake. This is a welcome departure from recent days — late October brings with it chilly weather, a perpetual pounding of rain on castle windows. He’s been feeling cooped up lately, exacerbated by the flurry of colds inflicting both faculty and students. Perhaps today is a good day to head outdoors and bask in the sunshine with a book, before breakfast and another session of marking. </p><p>Draco glances at the clock — it’s too early for the students to be out and about, so the lake should be deserted. He stretches, and then hauls himself out of bed. He proceeds with his daily morning routine. He kept the décor of his quarters similar to the Slytherin dungeons; outfitted in the muted colour of dark green and wooden cupboards, with silver motifs adorning the stone walls and soft green lamps.</p><p>He grabs a book, and strolls towards the shores of the lake, trekking a familiar path leading to a secluded area under his favourite tree. He inhales and smiles at the fresh, earthy scent of the outdoors and the faint tang of last night’s short drizzle. He shields his eyes with a hand as he gazes at the sunlight glimmering off the surface of the lake. Ever since he was a student, this is his favourite place outdoors to read and enjoy his solitude, with a great view of the lake. Most of the students don’t wander out this far, too.</p><p>He casts an Impervius charm to chase away dew and leftover rain, and spreads a thick blanket on the ground, settling down. The only thing that’s missing is a piping hot cup of tea, but he’ll have that for breakfast later. The long branches of the tree form a protective arch above him, and the rustling leaves cast shifting patterns of light over green grass. </p><p>His open book beside him, Draco leans back on the trunk, folds his hands in his lap and closes his eyes, feeling entirely at peace with the world. He nudges away thoughts of mounting piles of scrolls waiting to be graded, lesson plans waiting to be implemented, along with his other staff duties. Honestly, if another third-year writes that vampires are found only in Transylvania, he will be <i>this</i> close to chucking his inkpot into the fireplace.</p><p>There’s a splash of water a short distance away, and Draco opens his eyes, alert. Another large ripple on the surface of the lake close to the bank, and Potter emerges from the water, clambering onto the shore—</p><p>—wearing nothing but the tiniest pair of pants Draco has ever seen. </p><p>“What the ever-loving <i>fuck</i>,” he mutters in shock and sudden arousal, his wide eyes glued to the view of Potter shaking his head vigorously, flicking water everywhere. He recognises the tell-tale shimmer in the air, signalling a strong warming charm around Potter. Potter approaches his pile of things, removes his goggles and bends down to pick up a towel. His mouth dry and his cock hardening, Draco’s hungry gaze follows the route of the towel working its way down Potter’s body — a quick ruffle of his hair, his shoulders, the slopes of his chest, his taut stomach. Merlin, look at the vee of those hips, and more importantly, look at that bulge tucked beneath those ridiculously small swimming pants (which must be Muggle, no decent wizarding shop would sell something that scandalous). </p><p>Draco bites his lower lip at the tantalising sight, a hand automatically going down to his erection, pressing the heel of his palm against it. He places his book on top of his crotch, spreads his thighs just a bit, and rubs himself once, through his clothes. </p><p>Fuck, that feels good. </p><p>Draco retreats further into the shadows provided by the large tree. When Potter slants his body, he squints at the black ink-like marks on two locations — slightly above his left hip and a string of what looks like words occupying the inside of his right upper arm — those must be Potter’s tattoos. Draco is too far away for further scrutiny, but Potter did mention that he has a tattoo. Draco was curious, but he didn’t want to pry. <i>He must’ve got another one recently.</i> </p><p>When he’s finished towelling himself off, a grinning Potter unrolls a thick mat and plops it on the ground, before collapsing onto it, his limbs sprawled out like a happy starfish. </p><p>Apparently, Draco isn’t alone in taking advantage of the pleasant weather.   </p><p><i>I need to leave, this is hardly appropriate.</i> Despite that thought, Draco has already popped open the button of his trousers, and his hand appears to have a mind of its own, sending half-hearted strokes along his prick. He should wank in the privacy of his room, but he’s already fantasising about tugging those tiny pants down Potter’s hips and swallowing him—</p><p>Draco’s cock throbs. </p><p>Swearing under his breath, he pushes his book off his lap, and with wary eyes trained on Potter, who seems to be content simply sunbathing, he quickly packs his things. When Potter sits up, Draco scuttles behind the trunk, counts to five, and then slowly pokes his head out from the safety of the tree, peering. <i>Just one more look. One quick look—</i></p><p>What he sees makes him want to drop to his knees and rub one off, right here, right now.</p><p>A half-naked Potter is doing squats. </p><p>Draco indulges himself in the side view of Potter doing his warm-ups; fuck, look at the curve of that fine arse as he crouches and straightens up, those lovely thighs and calves. Draco’s heart is racing, and his palm lazily gliding up and down his erection. He watches as Potter launches into a medley of exercises — sit-ups (he’s too far to have a proper look, but he can imagine those abdominal muscles clenching), push-ups (those arms, sweet Merlin, the flex of his biceps) before he gets into planking position (his form, along with that lean line of his figure, is excellent). </p><p>Draco looks down at himself. He’s on his knees, his trousers and pants down to his thighs and his cock is out. He gives a furtive look around, relaxing when they’re alone, except for the chirping of birds.  </p><p>Well, that’s it, then.  </p><p>He’s going to sneakily wank to Potter in public and in broad daylight, on the grounds of Hogwarts, as the oblivious bloke does something as innocuous as warm-ups. He should not be doing this, but how can he look away from Potter doing yoga (he knows of that activity thanks to Pansy, who has the absolute worst habit of showing off her yoga poses to a disinterested Draco — apparently, he’s interested only if it’s Potter doing it)?      </p><p>Hypnotised, Draco wets his lips and continues to thrust his cock into the circle of his fist when Potter stands up, raises his arms and clasps his hands together, his index fingers pointing skywards in a brief stretch. The waistband of Potter’s pants dip, but before Draco can crane his neck for a better look, he’s already changed position into—</p><p>“Oh, <i>fuck</i>,” Draco hisses and wanks faster. Potter looks so <i>fucking</i> good, so damn hot on all fours, on his palms and knees as he arches his back (once again, the curve of that arse) and lifts his chin, before curling his body inwards, rounding his back and lowering his chin to his chest. </p><p>Draco’s filthy mind fills in the blanks — of him fucking Potter from the back, his hands digging into the other man’s hips while he pounds hard and fast into him. Draco bites a knuckle to keep himself from crying out at that delectable image, which morphs into one of him riding Potter when Potter switches position. </p><p>He’s lying down on his back now, his legs bent and his feet pressed onto the mat as he pumps his hips upwards in a steady tempo. With each upwards thrust, his stomach and his chest forms a straight line. Draco wonders how it’d feel like, caressing that tanned, warm skin, feeling the rapid beat of Potter’s heart under his touch as he rides Potter with abandon, the slick slide of Potter’s hard prick fucking into him as he jerks his hips up just like that, with Draco sinking down while Potter thrusts up, going in deep—</p><p>
  <i>“Is that what you want? Me sneaking out of your house in the dead of the night after a good, long shag? Having you so hard and fast ‘til you can’t walk properly the next morning?”</i>
</p><p>“Yes, that’s what I fucking want,” Draco whispers, and releases a sound in between a sob and a moan. One more stroke, a loud huff of breath, his left palm braced against the tree trunk, and he’s coming, coming so hard and shooting his load at the base of the tree, gasping at the force of his orgasm. Spunk leaks between his knuckles, dripping down on the grass. Panting, he takes a moment to recover, and then looks up. </p><p>Potter is pulling on a T-shirt and knee-length shorts. He rolls up the mat, puts on his glasses, gathers his things and tucks them under his arm. Whistling, he strolls towards the castle, clueless about his role in Draco’s fevered imagination and public orgasm. </p><p>Draco tucks himself in and quickly makes himself presentable. He waves his wand, removing all traces of this momentary lapse of judgement. He sighs, and buries his head in his hands, helpless.  </p><p>
  <i>One and a half months into term, and I’m already wanking to him in public in school. How in Salazar’s name am I going to control myself for the rest of the year, and beyond?</i>
</p><hr/><p>Harry is in mid-stretch when he spies a flash of a blond head passing by the classroom. Malfoy backpedals and moves closer to the door, peering into the room. As usual, he’s dressed impeccably, with a sheaf of scrolls cradled in his arm. Harry instructs his students to ease from the stretch, and straightens up, giving Malfoy a friendly wave.</p><p>The class, comprised of fourteen students from the lower years, greets Malfoy. Some of them, especially the Hufflepuffs and Gryffindors look rather intimidated, but Leo, a first-year Slytherin, brightens up considerably.</p><p>“Good afternoon. What are you lot up to?” Malfoy asks.</p><p>“Warm-ups and basketball drills,” Harry says, following the other man’s gaze around the room. While looking for a suitable indoor space large enough for basketball, he stumbled across an enormous abandoned classroom. He tried his best to convert it into a makeshift basketball court. Sure, the smoothness of the floor isn’t exactly like a proper court, but he’s painted red lines along the edges to demarcate borders during games, along with using magic to fix customisable basketball nets on sturdy stands. If it’s a proper game, there’ll be two nets on either side of the court, but if it’s drills, like today, there’s a series of nets, enough for the class to break into pairs and practise shooting. Since today’s kids are younger, he’s also lowered the height of the nets.  </p><p>“You can join us, if you want to,” Harry offers, flashing Malfoy an encouraging smile.</p><p>“I wouldn’t want to intrude,” he replies, although he steps inside.</p><p>Leo pipes up, “Come on, Professor Malfoy! Me and Jason—“ </p><p>“Jason and I,” Malfoy corrects gently. </p><p>“Jason and I really like Mr Potter’s classes, and basketball is really fun, like football, although we’re still learning. It’s loads of fun, I swear!”</p><p>Harry grins at the effusive praise. The boy might be a Slytherin, but he has the enthusiasm of a Gryffindor, probably due to Jason’s influence. Leo used to be shy, and it’s wonderful seeing him blossom into someone confident enough to offer strategies during sports. </p><p>Malfoy smiles with affection at Leo. Harry suspects Malfoy has a soft spot for Leo, and his suspicion proves correct when Malfoy places his scrolls on a table. “Since you’re vouching for Mr Potter’s classes…” He looks down at his attire — formal robes and dress shoes. “I’m hardly dressed for this, though.” </p><p>“I’ve got some things,” Harry says. He turns to Darren, one of his older and more experienced students. “Lead the class in warm-ups while I help Professor Malfoy get ready.” </p><p>Harry brings Malfoy to the small wardrobe at the back of the classroom. </p><p>“You do think of everything, don’t you?” Malfoy says, blinking at the selection of exercise attire available. He sorts through the clothes, and then stares at a neon-green sports bra. </p><p>“That’s from a fifth-year Ravenclaw,” Harry explains. “She strolled into class wearing only that and the shortest shorts you’ve ever seen.” Malfoy darts an embarrassed glance at him, before returning his attention to the clothes. <i>That’s a strange reaction.</i> “The boys lost their collective minds, as you can imagine. I sent her straight out to change, but she didn’t want to, so… long story short, I confiscated her clothes. Although I should throw it out, eh, a bit strange to keep bras around the place.” Harry gestures to the wardrobe. “Sometimes kids lose interest, but they don’t know what to do with the clothes. If they don’t want them anymore, I keep it for others. I think this would be most suitable.” He withdraws a set of grey long-sleeved sweatshirt and sweatpants — clothes that show the least skin — and a pair of running shoes. </p><p>Malfoy takes them, and then wrinkles his nose. </p><p>“They’re already clean, but feel free to clean them. Sizes can be adjusted with magic.” Harry motions to the curtained-off corner. “You can change there.” When Malfoy thanks him and moves away, Harry returns to his class, taking over from Darren. Malfoy joins them soon after, picking gingerly at the sleeves of the sweatshirt and the pockets of the sweatpants.</p><p>It’s strange seeing Malfoy dressed like this, removed from the formality and rigidity of his robes, but Harry decides he rather likes seeing Malfoy in casual sweats.          </p><p>Malfoy moves to the back of the class, looks at them, and then mimics their position. He bends forward at the hips and lowers his upper body, hands gripping his right shin. </p><p>“Hold it there,” Harry instructs. “Feel the stretch.” He walks around, pausing at times to correct some of their forms. He stops behind Malfoy, looks up… </p><p>… and is rewarded with the sexiest, hottest sight of his arse. </p><p>
  <i>Oh, bloody hell.</i>
</p><p>Harry stares. </p><p>Malfoy’s bum is exquisite — firm and tight, leading down to shapely calves, the position of the stretch highlighting the length of his legs. Unencumbered by his pesky robes, Harry can even see the outline of his pants. A memory barges into his mind — of Malfoy writhing in his arms, Harry sliding his hands down Malfoy’s sides, reaching behind and squeezing the life out of that gorgeous, mouth-watering arse.</p><p>Harry quickly clasps his hands behind his back, if not he’s sure he’ll reach out and help himself to Malfoy’s arse again. He could simply tug those sweatpants down, feel that warm skin beneath his fingertips, fuck, would Malfoy moan like how he did when Harry groped him that night in the pub? Would Malfoy push his arse back into Harry’s hands, begging for more, pleading for Harry to strip him and—</p><p>Harry gulps and presses the heel of his hand on his crotch. </p><p>Ah, fuck. </p><p>He’s hard. </p><p>He’s popping a stiffy, and his shorts won’t conceal anything. Panic mounting, Harry casually rests his wrist against his groin, hoping to cover it, while he brisk-walks back to the front. He bends over and stretches his right calf. </p><p>“To your right,” he croaks, and the class follows. </p><p>Harry wills his prick to behave. <i>Please go down, I swear I’ll wank properly when I’m alone, but please go down now.</i> It’s like he’s a student again, having inappropriate erections in class, but this time, he’s the teacher. To stop it, he thinks of Ron and Hermione, but they morph into him and Malfoy, and he’s thrusting into Malfoy while the other man’s bent over like this. </p><p>His cock swells. </p><p>
  <i>Fuck!</i>
</p><p>He thinks of Minerva and Filius, only to be promptly replaced by Malfoy sprawled out on the long, mahogany table in the staff room, grabbing his own ankles and gasping for more while Harry pounds into him, hard and fast—</p><p>“Mr Potter?” Darren’s voice breaks him out of his highly inappropriate fantasies. </p><p>Harry makes a strangled sound. </p><p>“We’ve been stretching for really long,” Darren points out. </p><p><i>I’m as hard as a rock, and I can’t wait to shag your other teacher in this very classroom,</i> Harry’s mind helpfully supplies. Instead, he clears his throat and manages, “Stretching is important. Wouldn’t want anyone to get hurt.” </p><p>In his most desperate moment, he thinks of Molly and Arthur—</p><p>It does the trick after a few seconds, and even though he isn’t fully soft yet, it’s good enough for him to suggest a water break. The students disperse, and Harry hurries to his water bottle, taking the chance to rein in a modicum of control. </p><p>Harry gathers the class, and he demonstrates a series of basketball drills: dribbling and crossing the court in zig-zag lines marked by orange cones; dribbling the ball between his legs and then switching hands; passing the ball within pairs; jumping directly underneath the net and scoring, swapping hands on each score.</p><p>Harry pairs up with Malfoy for half the time, but when he does his rounds, Malfoy joins Leo and Jason. Just like in Duelling Club, Harry’s gaze wanders to Malfoy, at that familiar grace as he jumps and attempts to score a basket. Not surprisingly, he is a quick study with excellent reflexes and a natural aptitude for sports. </p><p>Although the ball did whack Malfoy on the nose a few times (it was adorable how he glared at the ball, as if it was the ball’s fault for not going into the hoop), he makes roughly half the shots that he takes, his brow furrowed in determination and a scowl on his lips. The first few times he scored, Jason and Leo cheered, and it was brilliant seeing Malfoy laugh. Grey eyes sought Harry out at once, as if he was checking if Harry saw him score. </p><p>Of course he did, he can barely keep his eyes off Malfoy. </p><p>Eventually, the class ends, and Harry regards all of them, a ball tucked under his arm and pressing against his hip. “Next week, we’ll work on defending, and more techniques to improve the accuracy of your shots. Once everyone is decent, we’ll team up for a game. Hopefully, after next week, you can do this.” </p><p>Harry lobs the basketball in the air, and catches it neatly. He crosses the court, two hard dribbles to his left, and pulling back, as if defending himself from an opponent. He dribbles the remaining distance to the net, turning and spinning his body, before making a jump shot. He makes his moves fancier than normal, since Malfoy is watching. He repeats the manoeuvres a few times, varying the distance from the net that he shoots. He tries five times, with four of those shots making it in. </p><p>“I’m still learning, like you,” he says. That’s true, he’s better at football, and Quidditch will always be his first love. “Oh yeah, Quidditch season is starting next week, so if you’re on your House teams, look out for your Captains’ announcements. Class dismissed.”</p><p>He notices the warmer disposition of the Hufflepuffs and Gryffindors towards Malfoy, going by the grins and small waves directed at him as they leave. </p><p>“How’d you like it?” Harry asks after Malfoy has changed back into his robes.  </p><p>“It’s…” Malfoy pauses, and then smiles. “It’s my first time playing a Muggle sport, and it was more fun than I expected. Thank you for the class. I thought Jason and Leo were doing football?” </p><p>“Yeah, but it’s been raining lately, so they wanted to try basketball. When the weather’s better, we’ll switch back to football.” Harry shrugs. “Plus I’m out on the pitch so often already, what with Quidditch season starting, and I certainly don’t relish being cold and wet every lesson.” He’s mostly hands-off during Quidditch training, letting the Captains do their jobs, but he likes being available if they need to discuss plays, or to conduct flying drills. </p><p>“Ah, yes.” Malfoy slants a crafty smirk towards Harry. “I have faith that Slytherin will continue their winning streak.” </p><p>Harry grins. “We’ll see about that. Gryffindor is shaping up to give Slytherin a run for their Galleons.” </p><p>“We’ll see,” Malfoy echoes lightly. A thrum of competitiveness beats between them, just like old days.</p><p>Fuck, he is so damn fine, but there’s still something niggling at the back of Harry’s mind, colouring their interactions, wedged between them like a restless third shadow. </p><p>
  <i>Why did you leave the Academy?</i>
</p><p>Despite his intense curiosity, Harry has learnt his lesson. The last time he asked Malfoy that, they ended up at the Headmistress’ office, and he has no desire to repeat that, thank you very much.</p><p>“Is the Halloween feast still as good?” he asks, recalling the giant pumpkins decorating the Great Hall, a flock of bats whizzing around, and the brilliant smorgasbord of food that plunges him into a food coma. Hermione used to be exasperated with him and Ron after feasts, when she’d be going on about revising and they’re zoned out in front of the fireplace in their common room, answering her in monosyllables.  </p><p>“Yes. I will see you at the feast tonight, then,” Malfoy replies. He collects his scrolls, and then exits the classroom, leaving behind his usual whiff of lemon. </p><p>Harry sighs in longing; Malfoy’s arse in sweatpants is so much more delectable than in robes.</p><hr/><p>Draco folds a damp towel on the edge of the large, pool-like tub and rests the back of his head on it, groaning in bliss. Although he has a perfectly serviceable bathtub in his own en-suite, there’s no beating the prefects’ bathroom, which boasts a ridiculously luxurious tub like this, the staggering variety of bath supplies, and the numerous golden taps surrounding the tub, ready with their differently-coloured bath water. There’s a yellow tinge to the water, imbuing it with the refreshing scent of lemon. Sunlight streams through the stained glass windows, resplendent in their pictures of the mermaids, and the radiant hues of the glass colour the bubbles on the water.   </p><p>He could lay sprawled like this forever, eyes closed, body completely relaxed, and mind at ease. As he soaks, he lets the gentle swish of the water carry away all muddled thoughts about lesson plans, marking and work-related bothers. Draco sinks further into the tub, his arms floating in the water as he mulls over the term. </p><p>It’s already November, and term will end soon for Christmas. He’s mostly glad, as he can return to France to see Mother and Pansy, and also take a much-deserved break from the busy humdrum of school, but a part of him is disappointed, because he can’t see Potter every day. </p><p>He can’t stop thinking about Potter, whether in dreams or reality — Potter’s cheerful laugh, that electric smile and the playful twinkle in his eyes. That kiss seven years ago keeps replaying in his mind in increasingly vivid detail. He’s caught Potter sneaking heated looks at him during dinner (followed by Charlie’s mischievous grins); Potter popping up during sleepless nights, as if he knows exactly where Draco is. They don’t talk much then, content in their companionable silence, like that night at the seventh-floor memorial. They’ve struck up a friendship, encouraged by Charlie. The three of them occasionally go for a pint or a meal at Hogsmeade to unwind, but he’s never spent time alone with Potter in public.</p><p>Draco sighs with longing, suddenly filled with a desire to see Potter. He could head to the pitch, or even to Potter’s private quarters, ask him out for dinner tonight, as something more than friends—</p><p>As sudden as he welcomes the thought, Draco bats it away. He can’t risk this friendship. What if Potter rejects him, like first year? Things would be so awkward, and he doesn’t want Charlie to be affected too. They’re colleagues now, furthermore. </p><p>Draco shifts in the tub, his hand naturally moving to his crotch when he thinks of Potter. Although he can’t see him, he certainly can rub one out as he mentally undresses Potter, until he’s wearing nothing but those tiny swimming pants…</p><p>A sharp click, a cold gust of wind gliding across his body, sending goosebumps erupting on his skin—</p><p>“What the—“ </p><p>Draco’s eyes open, and he echoes Potter’s squawk. He lets go of his prick. </p><p>“Close the door, you berk! Anyone can see!” he snaps, sinking further into the water and sweeping the foam up to his chin. Potter jolts into action, stumbling into the bathroom and slamming the door behind him. He looks at Draco with wide eyes. </p><p>“Wasn’t it locked?” Draco hisses.</p><p>“No, I swear! It opened, like usual. I had no idea—“ Potter splutters. “I’m sorry, I’ll come back later.” He turns and rattles the doorknob. </p><p>It doesn’t give. </p><p>“It’s locked.” Potter jerks the handle again. “From the outside.”</p><p>“How is that possible? Was there anyone outside?” </p><p>“No, no one.” Potter whips out his wand and casts spells at the door, but to no avail. He turns to Draco, confused. “I can’t unlock it. I don’t know why, or how, but I guess we’re stuck here for a bit.” </p><p>At his defeated words, a towel and a bathrobe levitate themselves from the rack, bobbing their way towards Potter until they’re floating in front of him. A handful of the taps gush out bath water and soap. A wave of bubbles drifts lazily, enticingly in the air, popping every few seconds. </p><p>Draco lifts his hands from the water to show he isn’t the one doing all this magic. </p><p><i>What is this blasted castle doing?</i> </p><p>Potter accepts the proffered items, and then looks at him. “Since you’re here, I guess I should go for a shower,” he says, but an envious glance at the tub tells Draco what he’s really keen on. It’s the height of Quidditch season, and Potter looks absolutely knackered this Friday night. Draco knows first-hand the restoring and rejuvenating wonders the bath can do for aching muscles, sore joints brought on by vigorous exercise and made worse by cold, biting winds and persistent drizzles.  </p><p>“It’s big enough for us. Join me, if you don’t mind sharing.” </p><p>“Really? D’you really mean that?” Potter says, perking up. “Oh, that’s brilliant. Thanks.” Without even asking for privacy, he eagerly strips down to his pants (at least it’s not those swimming ones) right where he stands, bounds over to the tub, chucks his clothes in a messy pile at the side and jumps inside. He tilts his head back, resting his elbows on the edge and releasing a sound of pure joy.</p><p>Potter straightens up at Draco’s blush. “Sorry, am I making you uncomfortable? During Quidditch training, we kinda just strip down like that in the showers.”</p><p>“No, it’s alright,” Draco croaks, closing his legs under the bubbles; his body doesn’t need any more encouragement, he’s already hard. When Potter closes his eyes and tips his head back, fully enjoying the bath, Draco discreetly makes the water a bit colder. </p><p>After a moment, he whispers, hesitant to wake Potter if he’s asleep, “Your tattoos…” He got a closer look, they appear to be dates and words. “What are they?” </p><p>“Oh.” Potter stands up and presents his left hip to Draco. “This is the newer one.” It’s the triangular black Montrose Magpies logo — a magpie perching on the ring of a Quidditch hoop, with the word “Montrose” nestled within the hoop and “Magpies” acting as the stand. On top of the logo is the date when Potter caught the winning Snitch at the World Cup. </p><p>“I got this years ago,” Potter continues, raising his right arm, revealing the words in black elegant, flowing script — <i>the last enemy that shall be destroyed is death</i> — followed by the date of the Battle of Hogwarts. “The words are on my parents’ tombstone,” he says, but offers no further explanation. </p><p>He splashes back into the tub, and then darts a strange look at Draco. “So you’re… er… naked? Underneath the water?” he asks, gesturing with a hand. </p><p>“I… yes.” </p><p>“Oh,” Potter says, gulping.</p><p>Draco’s familiar stirrings of Potter-related lust amplify when Potter fiddles with something under the water, pulling off his pants and then lobbing them towards his clothes.</p><p>
  <i>What the fuck.</i>
</p><p>Draco’s cock throbs. He aches to cover the distance between them, climb into Potter’s lap and grind into him while snogging the living daylights out of him. Worse still, he has a feeling that Potter absolutely wouldn’t mind. </p><p>
  <i>Salazar have mercy on me.</i>
</p><p>Potter sniffs the air, dips his head into the water, and then pops back up. “Smells like lemons. Oh, this must be why there’s this lemony scent around you. Here I was, thinking that that’s ‘cause you walk around sour-faced most of the time,” he says, grinning to imply a joke. </p><p><i>He knows what I smell like?</i> Draco doesn’t know what to say to that, so he gives him a watery smile. He thinks of Potter’s Magpies tattoo, and he’s suddenly consumed with the urge to know about his story — the Academy, to pro Quidditch, and finally, to this surreal day of them sitting together, naked, in the prefects’ bathroom in Hogwarts. So, he asks Potter about it. </p><p>Potter gathers some water in his cupped palms and splashes his face, smoothing his hair back. He leans back on the tub. “I left the Academy very soon after you. I was bumming around for a bit, before Oliver — Oliver Wood, he went to school with us, I don’t know if you remember — told me the Magpies was holding out try-outs for Seeker. I met him again at Seamus and Dean’s sports complex, and we ended up going out for a while—“ </p><p>A hot flare of jealousy surges in Draco. </p><p>“— so it’s thanks to him that I heard of the chance to go pro. Went for try-outs and got in, and that was my life for the next five years. Thought I’d take a shot for the World Cup last year, and I surprisingly got in as Seeker, and even more surprisingly, we won.”</p><p>Draco still can’t understand how Potter can be so humble, considering all he’s accomplished. “Then why did you leave professional Quidditch? Don’t players usually get the most money and opportunities after winning the World Cup? I’m sure you know how shocked the wizarding community was when you ditched it all to teach.” </p><p>“Yeah, I know, but it just felt…” Potter wets his lips, pausing as he fumbles for the right words. “It felt like I’ve reached my best in the sport, y’know? It wasn’t a challenge anymore, and I was getting bored. I wanted to switch things up. Plus I needed a break — a break from the publicity,” he grimaces, “from the frantic trainings, the hustle of London and the insane travelling for matches… it’s really tiring.</p><p>“I’ve always kept in touch with Minerva, ever since I wrote to her telling her I got into the Magpies ‘cause I know that’s her favourite team. She told me about Hooch leaving, and then before I knew it, I was signing the contract and packing my bags for Hogwarts. Felt like the right thing do.” Potter pats the surface of the water with his palms, as if punctuating the end of his story. </p><p>That’s the marked difference between Potter and him — Potter works best going with the flow, while Draco is the complete opposite. </p><p>
  <i>Maybe that’s why you need someone like him, someone in your dull, monotonous life to liven things up once in a while.</i>
</p><p>Draco banishes that thought. “I see.” </p><p>Their eyes meet, and once again, that same unanswered question hangs in the air between them. <i>What about you, Malfoy? What’s your story?</i></p><p>Draco expects Potter to ask him about it, but instead, he looks away, busying himself with paddling around in the water. Minutes tick by, and Draco’s hands clench on the seat of the tub, before relaxing. He exhales, swiping away the cobweb of secrets within him with a jittery hand, and lugs out the truth.</p><p>“You want to know why I left the Academy,” he murmurs. </p><p>Potter goes very still for a second. “Yeah,” he whispers and moves slowly, as if Draco is a small animal that spooks easily. He returns to his spot and waits.</p><p>“The day after we… kissed, Mother owled me. Her health, both mental and physical, were on the decline after the War, especially when Father passed on.” Draco swallows the lump in his throat. “Things took a turn for the worse that night, and when I hurried back to the Manor, I knew we had to leave. Staying in the country, in the Manor, along with all of the abuse hurled at us even though I got accepted into the Academy…” He shakes his head, trying to control his fury and resignation at those horrible memories of people spitting at them in the streets, the vandalism inflicted on the Manor, and of Mother, pale-faced and distraught, shrieking about ghosts of people killed by Death Eaters, along with Malfoy ancestors in the Manor, telling her that she’d tarnished their reputation. </p><p><i>“Everywhere I turn, Draco, I see them, I see Lucius, but I can’t leave this house for fear of my safety, please, I beg of you, let’s go away from here, leave it all behind us…”</i> </p><p>Draco grabs the nearest bottle of shampoo and turns it over in his hands, just for something to do. His gaze flickers to Potter, and then back to the bottle, his eyes gazing unseeingly at the components of the shampoo. “I got in touch with some family members in France, and we left. I pulled a few strings — the Malfoy name is still fairly respected in France — to obtain a Defence position in Beauxbatons. The syllabus was not exactly like what I teach here, but similar enough.</p><p>“Two years on, I heard about the vacant Defence position in Hogwarts. Mother was doing much better in France, and she had Pansy around too. Pansy joined me a few months after I left Britain.” Draco smiles at the mention of his best friend. “And I missed home. So I wrote to Minerva, expecting her not to give me the time of the day, but she did. I went for the interview, and I got the job,” Draco finishes, exhaling deeply and replacing the shampoo bottle. </p><p>“Why didn’t you tell me?” Potter asks, hurt apparent in sad green eyes, and Draco’s heart sinks. He doesn’t want to see Potter troubled, and knowing that he was the one that made him feel like this… “I know we were far from best mates in the Academy, but I thought we were… at least close enough for me to deserve an explanation.” </p><p><i>Because I’m a coward. I developed feelings for you. I tried so hard not to, but I was falling for you. I knew I couldn’t have you, and staying as friends would hurt me. So I ran, Harry. I ran away from you, from a happy ending I knew I could never have. I cut off all connection, because what’s the point in hoping?</i> </p><p>Draco waited for his longing to run its course, hoped that his feelings for Potter was as ephemeral as breaths on frosted glass, like memories losing their intensity, paling and fading away with the passage of time. Draco musters up a bland smile and says, “I’m a very private person, as you should know, especially about family matters. Only Pansy, and of course, Robards knew. Everything happened so quickly, I just…” He shrugs. “Things happen.” </p><p>“D’you wanna know why I left the Academy?” Potter says. </p><p>Draco nods warily. </p><p>“Being an Auror was expected of me, so I went along with things, probably because I didn’t bother thinking what else I could be doing. It wasn’t something I particularly enjoyed. But most importantly…” He fixes Draco with a look so intense that his heart stutters. Potter takes one small step towards him, water swishing behind him. “I left because I missed you.” </p><p>Draco’s heart stops for a split second, before thudding in double-quick time. “It’s because Weasley didn’t join the Academy. Your group of friends weren’t there, that’s why you—“</p><p>“No!” Potter growls. “It’s you. Don’t you fucking get it, Malfoy?” He draws up to his full height and advances towards Draco, bath water cascading down his chest. Draco flattens himself against the side of the tub. “I was missing something important, not having you to push against, not seeing your face every morning in the pantry, duelling with people that didn’t present half the challenge you did.” He scrubs his face with his palms, sighing. “It’s you. It’s always been you.” These last few words emerge so quietly, as if they were meant for Potter himself. </p><p>
  <i>I’m something important to him.</i>
</p><p>Holding his gaze, Potter moves closer, foam rippling around his hips. Draco sucks in a harsh breath, his body tensing and his eyes wandering. The bubbles pop, soap glistens on Potter’s shoulders and chest. He stares at Potter’s chest hair, and then at the narrow trail of hair down his abdominals, his navel, before widening into a thick nest of black curls, fuck, he can almost see the outline of Potter's swelling prick— </p><p>Draco makes a small, dying sound.</p><p>“Draco…” Potter whispers. It’s the way he says his name, like before that kiss in the pub—</p><p>There’s a loud click as the door unlocks, and they turn to look, startled. </p><p>Just like that, the spell is broken. </p><p>“Oh,” Draco murmurs. “It’s unlocked.”</p><p>Potter clears his throat, and retreats. “Er. Yeah.” </p><p>“I should go,” Draco mutters. His rational mind finally catching up — there ought to be rules about fraternising within the faculty — he wraps his arms around himself and quickly shuffles away from Potter.  </p><p>Potter throws him one last lingering look, before turning around to give him some privacy as Draco rinses off, dries himself and pulls on his clothes. He’s close to the door before Potter’s voice stops him in his tracks. </p><p>“Thanks for telling me.” </p><p>Draco nods, and then exits the bathroom, leaving Potter alone in the tub. He feels strangely liberated, as if by spilling all of that out, a weight was lifted off his shoulders.</p><p>That night, Draco’s bed is softer and more comfortable, a fire already crackling in the fireplace, the swishing of the lake more hypnotising, lulling him into a peaceful slumber… </p><p>… as if the castle is pleased with him.</p><hr/><p>Harry stares at Malfoy's dot on the Marauder's Map; he is currently in the Slytherin dungeons, surrounded by a cluster of students. Sighing, he forces himself to deactivate the Map and place it on his bedside dresser. He takes off his glasses and stretches out in bed, pressing his face into his pillows. </p><p>He's becoming obsessed with Draco Malfoy. </p><p>Again. </p><p>It's like sixth year; the way he's so concerned with Malfoy's daily comings and goings, except it's for vastly different reasons this time. He has used the Map to engineer opportunities to "stumble" upon Malfoy in private, although he honestly didn't plan it when he found Malfoy in the prefects' bathroom. He was looking forward to a long, relaxing soak at the end of an exhausting week, and Malfoy was there, naked and practically waiting for him like a soaped-up treat. </p><p>Harry briefly lifts his hips to adjust himself at that memory. </p><p>Of course, he ruined it, yeah? Advancing on Malfoy like some... some naked sexual predator when things became too heated at the end, effectively scaring him away. </p><p>Harry simply doesn't know how to play things cool.</p><p>That tempting image of Malfoy in the tub lingers — the dark blond of his wet hair, pale and soapy shoulders, the delicate hollows of his collarbone, and that pink flush blooming across his cheeks. What if the door remained locked, would they have recreated that wonderful kiss from seven years ago, only naked...   </p><p>Harry reaches over to wrench open the lowest compartment of his dresser. He’s returned to the old-fashioned way of getting off — he really misses having access to the internet. He flips through his selection of <i>Lush</i> magazines, fishing one out at random. A pair of fit, scantily clad men wink at him on the cover, and Harry tears through the September issue, in search of a sex scene involving any tall, pale and blond model. He huffs in frustration when every model comes up short, and despite the explicit scenes that would usually get him in the mood, he's only half-hard.  </p><p>Nowadays, it’s as if only Malfoy does it for him. Sighing, Harry chucks the mag to the side, makes himself comfortable and lets his mind (and his hand) wander to the glistening possibilities of the prefects' bathroom... </p><p>A sharp rap on his door interrupts his imagination, and Harry quickly gets his prick to behave, before tucking himself away and straightening his clothes. </p><p>Another hard knock. </p><p>"Coming," he calls, patting his hair. He swings open the door, and comes face-to-face with the bloke of his fantasies himself. </p><p>"Good evening, Potter," Malfoy says in a clipped tone. "I need to talk to you about your snake."</p><p>Harry blinks. "Er. What?" he says, his gaze automatically dropping to Malfoy's crotch. </p><p>Malfoy goes pink. "Not that kind of snake, you berk!" Agitated, he motions to his left. It's only then that Harry notices a well-camouflaged Pork Chop, who is lying beside him on the floor and looking far too interested in them. Her sharp, dimly glowing red eyes dart avidly between them, as if she is a Magizoologist watching two wild beasts interact. </p><p>"I found her in the dungeons! Care to explain what your fire-breathing Ashwinder is doing with my students? I distinctly recall you saying that you promised Minerva you'd keep your snake to yourself!" Malfoy says, understandably upset.</p><p>Outraged, Harry rounds on Pork Chop at once. <i>"Did you reveal yourself to the students? Did you break the only rule you have to obey, the one thing that I promised Minerva when she granted permission for me to keep you here?" he hisses, glaring at her. "What if something happened to them, how would I answer to her?"</i></p><p>Her satisfied expression fades, and her eyes spark with anger. <i>"I'm in full control of my powers, and I don’t like being yelled at without a chance to explain myself. Did you actually think I would hurt anyone?"</i> She tips her head towards Malfoy, and flicks her tongue out. <i>"I was curious. You keep talking about him. Look at him now. I can smell his arousal. He likes it when you speak like this."</i> </p><p>Miffed, Pork Chop holds her head high, slithers into the room and curls up in her basket, sulking. She narrows her eyes at Harry. <i>"You can thank me later."</i>  </p><p>Harry looks at Malfoy. Sure enough, there's a faint flush on his cheeks, his grey eyes are half-lidded, his plump lips parted as he stares at Harry's mouth. Harry drops his gaze — there's a slight bulge in his trousers. </p><p>Harry licks his lips, amused when Malfoy swallows, his Adam's apple bobbing. </p><p>"Er... Malfoy?" he says, waving a hand in front of his face.  </p><p>The other man blinks rapidly, recovering his equilibrium. "What did you say?" he asks, indicating Pork Chop.</p><p>
  <i>That you apparently have a kink for Parseltongue.</i>
</p><p>"I told her off. I'm really sorry about this, I have no idea why Pork Chop was loitering around your students, but I promise it won't happen again. Please don't tell Minerva about this, I really don't want her kicked out," Harry says. </p><p>"Pork Chop? Why that name?" </p><p>"Because she loves to eat pork chops." Harry gestures for Malfoy to come in, and he does, closing the door behind him. </p><p>"Was anyone hurt?" Harry asks. He sits on the edge of the bed, and Malfoy takes a seat on the chair near his table. </p><p>"No, fortunately. There were a few students far away, clearly uneasy, yet curious, but she was with a group of students that seemed quite interested in her. They were even petting her. They told me it's the first time they’ve seen her, and asked if she was Charlie’s. She did seem quite happy with the attention." Malfoy sighs. "Perhaps I over-reacted. She must be lonely, all alone in the castle. Since it's the first, and hopefully the last time, Minerva will not know about this." He looks at Pork Chop, frowning. "She still appears to be angry at you." </p><p>Although her body is turned towards the wall, her head is tilted, discreetly looking at them. Her beady eyes blink when Harry's gaze meets hers, and she lifts her head, sniffing in an injured air. </p><p>
  <i>"I'll forgive you only if you let me watch while you mount him."       </i>
</p><p><i>"No! I told you to stop watching whenever I have sex! Go back to your corner!"</i> Harry snaps in disbelief, earning an offended snarl from her. She coils her body up even further, and whips her head around, facing the wall in mute indignation. </p><p>He turns his attention to Malfoy, who looks away at once, as if caught staring. "I'll talk to her later, figure out what's going on. She might be lonely, but she shouldn’t be harassing students." A twinge of guilt rises in Harry — maybe it’s his fault, he has been busy recently. </p><p>Malfoy focuses on something behind him, and grey eyes widen. He’s looking at the porn mag (the two men on the cover are snogging now), and he nods at it, his voice huskier than usual, "Glad to see you're spending your time productively." </p><p>Unapologetic, Harry shrugs. In fact, this might be a good chance to have some fun. “I like sex. Nothing wrong with that. I have needs, cloistered away in the castle like this." He rakes Malfoy from head to toe with a slow gaze. He's taking a big risk with this, but he wants to goad Malfoy on, test how far he can take this little game of cat-and-mouse. "You're the only one who looks good around here."</p><p>"Such a compliment, being compared to the rest of the older faculty," Malfoy drawls with a dry smile. A familiar thrum of interest and tension ignites, crackling in the air between them. </p><p>Harry takes a step forward.  </p><p>Pork Chop makes a sound of interest, but he ignores her. </p><p>He’s ready with another cheeky question, but he frowns when a thought strikes him. He blurts out inelegantly, "Er, you're gay too, aren't you?"</p><p>And just like that, the playful moment pops like a bubble. </p><p>Malfoy blinks owlishly at him, and then shoots him an unimpressed look. "As usual, you're blessed with the subtlety of a <i>Stupefy</i> to the head," he says blandly.</p><p>Harry bites his lip, pushing down the justification for his question — simply because they kissed doesn't mean Malfoy is gay or has accepted his sexuality (during the Academy, Malfoy mentioned his expectations to marry and continue the lineage), plus he’d rather confirm things like this. Instead, he sighs. Subtle seduction is hardly his cup of tea. He's a firm believer of diving into things headfirst. </p><p>“Sorry, if I got that wrong,” Harry says. </p><p>Malfoy sniffs, reminding him of Pork Chop. "I do prefer men, but unlike you, I don't have the habit of flaunting my sexuality in the gossip rags." </p><p>A roiling surge of indignation jolts in Harry, and once again, that combative heat throbs under his skin, a strangely thrilling sensation that only Malfoy can provide. "I didn't ask for photographers and reporters popping up everywhere while I went about my business!" </p><p>"And your business being a new bloke every month or so, is it?" Malfoy continues, his eyes flashing in annoyance and restrained emotion trembling in his words. "I can't believe you dated Dennis Creevey, he was such a worshipper. I didn't know your ego needed that much stroking!" </p><p>Harry listens, amazed, as Malfoy flies into a jealous snit, picking apart a few of his exes — flings or proper relationships — that the media probably mentioned. He follows up each name with a reason as to why they never worked out or outright insults (some of which were quite witty, in fact, he said Oliver Rivers, a Ravenclaw they knew at the Academy, had the manners of a Flobberworm and the face of a Grindylow when he was angry, which honestly wasn't that far off). </p><p>"And Oliver Wood!" Malfoy hisses, his tirade winding down. "I used to be such a fan of Puddlemere!" </p><p>"Hang on. You switched Quidditch loyalties because of who I was going out with?" Harry says. A slow, impish smirk tugs his lips up. "You're so jealous! Didn't know you were so invested in me.”</p><p>"There's no need to look so pleased with yourself!" Malfoy snarls, flustered, then quickly schools his features into an expression of cool detachment. "Those were poor life choices, after all. I thought I'd do you the favour of enlightening you, seeing as we are colleagues." </p><p>"C'mon, don't make it out like I slept with half of London." Harry sighs. "Yeah, maybe I've got a reputation for fooling around. Half of the photos papped of me were in the clubs and parties, but it's part of pro Quidditch. I did settle down with a handful of those blokes. The <i>Prophet</i> would hardly cover those type of relationships, they'd be more interested in the salacious details of my one-night stands."</p><p>Malfoy makes an unconvinced sound. </p><p>Harry frowns, resentment and irritation cutting through his amusement at Malfoy's jealousy. "Why do I have to justify my actions to you, anyway? You seem rather suppressed yourself. D'you need a mag for your own needs?" he asks, grabbing the mag and dangling it in front of Malfoy. </p><p>Malfoy glances at it, and his lip curls with disdain. He glares at Harry, who meets it head-on, and then leans in to whisper in Harry's ear, his voice as light as silk, "No, thank you. I prefer the October 2002 issue myself." With a scowl, he withdraws, bids Harry a brusque goodnight, wrenches the door open and stomps off. </p><p>Harry hurries after him, eyeing his silly dramatic robes swirling behind him and that stupid shapely arse that makes him want to do all sorts of obscene things to it. </p><p><i>Come back and let me grab your bum, you gorgeous, jealous bastard</i>. Annoyed at himself, and at how the night turned out, Harry retreats into his room, slamming the door. He spots the mag, and then quickly dives into his stack of mags, searching for the issue that Malfoy mentioned. </p><p>He doesn't have it. <i>Damn, is it back in London?</i> He doesn't have a subscription, so it's possible that he might not even have bought it in the first place. He makes a mental note to hunt for that particular issue during Christmas hols. </p><p>"So much sexual tension," Pork Chop remarks, uncurling. She moves towards Harry, but freezes, as if she just remembered their argument. Sullenly, she swirls her way back to her basket and turns to face the wall.</p><p>"Porks." Harry sighs. "C'mon, Porks. Don't be like this. You know I hate it when we fight." He sits beside her and runs a hand down the top of her head, before stroking the base of her belly — she loves it when he pets her like this. Her tongue flicks out at the reconciliatory gesture, and her eyes flutter closed. After a while of petting, she butts her head against his arm affectionately (albeit a bit harder than usual). He heaves her up in his arms, and then carries her to the bed, where they lay in repose for a moment. </p><p>"Are you lonely? Is that why you went to the Slytherins? Maybe we should visit Charlie more often. Or d'you miss London? We'll be home next month for hols, and I promise we'll visit Ron and Hermione first thing when we get back." Harry worries his lower lip. "Maybe I could talk to Minerva, see if you can join me in my classes so you're not alone when I'm teaching. I'm sure they won't mind if you stay at the stands during Quidditch practice."</p><p>Pork Chop lifts her head up from his chest briefly, before plonking back down in a show of exasperation. "You've got it wrong, you great big knob." </p><p>Harry grins at the phrase he taught her — it's now one of her favourite insults.</p><p>"I wanted to see you together," she explains. "I'm curious about your mate, like what I said earlier. You keep talking to me about him, confessing your feelings every so often. I wanted to see it for myself, so I could get a better picture. But I never saw you alone together; I'm out hunting when you're with him at night.</p><p>"So, I crafted an opportunity by entering his House." She bats her eyes at him haughtily. "I'm a very charismatic and loveable snake, as you should very well know, and I was on my best behaviour, so there was no risk to the students at all. He appeared, no doubt alerted of my presence because of some plebeians without the fine appreciation for graceful and elegant snakes like I." The corners of her mouth turn up into a pleased smile. "And he behaved exactly like how I expected."</p><p>Harry plumps up his pillows and lies down. "So what's your verdict?" </p><p>"So much tension," she repeats. "So much mutual arousal, hidden beneath the sniping and tempers. I cannot understand English, but one might say that makes observing other things better — your body language, the tone of your voices, and the attraction and passion. So fiery interactions — as hot as the molten fire in my body — well, I used to be more powerful before <i> they</i> messed me up." Her eyes dim in sadness, and Harry makes a soothing noise, refusing to let her wallow in the misery of her past life, before she entered the care of Charlie, and subsequently, Harry.</p><p>"I daresay he wants you as much as you want him. And he's got such a kink for our language. Did you see?" she asks, and Harry nods. </p><p>He sits up, grabs the Map and activates it. Pork Chop climbs up his body, peering over his shoulder. Her tail rises to smooth a wrinkle on the parchment. "Still stalking him, I see." </p><p>"What? No! It’s er... focused following," Harry insists. He points to Malfoy's dot, and Pork Chop's tail follows his finger. "He's back in the dungeons, in his room." </p><p>"Would you like me to sneak into his room, see what he's doing, what he's wearing when he's alone?" Pork Chop offers with a cunning smile. "Perhaps he's touching himself right now, like how you do so often, and I could tell you how big <i>his</i> snake is." She pauses, lifting her tail and tapping its tip onto her head as if she's thinking. "Do you think he sounds like a dying Hippogriff, like you, when you're touching your <i>other</i> pet snake?" </p><p>"I certainly do not sound like a dying Hippogriff," Harry hisses back, scandalised. "And I told you to stop watching me!"</p><p>"Sure," she says, brushing away his usual concerns at her voyeuristic tendencies. "It would do the both of you well to make him your mate," she declares, and then slithers back to her basket, curling up for her usual nap before her hunting session. </p><p>They exchange goodnights, and Harry returns to gazing longingly at Malfoy's dot as he moves about in his room, Pork Chop's words of support replaying in his head. </p><p>
  <i>I should chase him and make my intentions clear. I'm tired of playing games.</i>
</p><hr/><p>"Hurry, Harry!" Pork Chop yells in excitement as she quickens her pace, slithering onwards to Charlie's hut. The cabin is at the edge of the Forbidden Forest, which is no surprise — Charlie is so comfortable with the Forest, he probably takes night-time strolls there for leisure. They visit him often, but that doesn’t curb Pork Chop's enthusiasm. Harry breaks into a jog to catch up, but she's already thumping on his door with her tail. A muffled shout comes from the inside, and she raises her head up high, tongue flicking in anticipation and eyes glowing bright red with affection. </p><p>The door swings open, and she lunges towards Charlie, hissing his name happily. </p><p>"Hi there, Porks," Charlie greets, laughing when she nuzzles her head on his knee. "Hey, Harry." </p><p>Charlie has retained the no frills décor and furnishings of the cabin, although there are differences: the bed is much smaller now, and no longer complete with Hagrid’s patchwork quilt, but instead, Molly’s handmade quilt. There are no more hams and pheasants dangling from the ceiling, now replaced by dragon posters tacked on the wall. There are also a lot more books and teaching things around. Harry blinks at the unusually messy surroundings. There are clothes, books and stacks of parchment heaped in untidy piles everywhere. Charlie's bags are open, with half of them full — he's clearly packing for Christmas hols. </p><p>A burst of heat emanates from the hearth, and Harry turns. With a fiery breath, Pork Chop has stoked the waning fire, the crackling and warmth lending a toasty and cosy atmosphere to the hut. Charlie is at the sink, washing out two mugs. Harry flicks his wand, and a box of their usual Earl Grey floats from the rack to the kettle.  </p><p><i>"Why don't you do things like that for me?"</i> Harry asks Pork Chop, who is heating up the kettle.  </p><p><i>"Because you're not Charlie,"</i> she replies, a soft smile taking away the sting of her words. </p><p>When they're seated at the table with steaming mugs of tea, Pork Chop curled up on her cushion beside them, Harry motions to the unpacked bags. "Leaving for the Burrow so soon?" Although tomorrow is the last official day of term, Charlie usually packs his things last minute (like Harry), so this means he's leaving earlier. "Everyone's fine, yeah? You're not rushing back 'cause someone's sick or anything like that?" </p><p>"Someone's sick, alright, but it's not anyone back home." Charlie summons a letter with a Romanian stamp. "I'm leaving straight for the sanctuary tonight. Gotta pack up, instruct the house elves to feed my animals for hols, and then Portkey out. Lucky I've no classes tomorrow."</p><p>Harry blinks, alarmed. He quickly swallows a scalding mouthful of tea. "Are we in your way, then?" </p><p>"No, I’m waiting for the Ministry-sanctioned Portkey to be owled over, since the Portkey would send me directly to the sanctuary, and not to London, nor the wizarding Romania Ministry. Should take about another thirty minutes or so." Charlie puts down the letter and tightens his lips in worry, his normally cheerful blue eyes midnight with sadness. </p><p>Pork Chop lifts her head up, puzzled. <i>"What's wrong?"</i> she asks, concerned. </p><p>
  <i>"I don't know. We’re still talking about it, but he's leaving tonight. Some problem at the sanctuary."</i>
</p><p>In response, she slithers towards Charlie and rests her head on his wrist in a show of comfort. Having been under his care at the sanctuary, she knows how much he feels for the dragons and other smaller reptiles there. He gives her a small smile as he begins to pet her. </p><p>"Wish I could talk to dragons like how you talk to snakes," he says enviously, and then backpedals. "Er, without the whole Voldemort Parselmouth thing, of course." </p><p>Harry reassures him that he didn't take offence. Charlie tugs at his earring on his left earlobe — it's a small dragon tooth, carved with the name of the dragon. The keepers at the sanctuary have a tradition: whenever a dragon passes away — whether peacefully due to old age or otherwise, such as being grievously injured in the dragon trafficking trade — they would extract its teeth and keep them as a memento, before disposing of its body respectfully. Charlie would craft the tooth into an earring.</p><p>"Everest isn't doing too well, and this time, they reckon he's really gonna go for good. I got a letter a few days back, told me I better hurry back to say my..." Charlie swallows thickly and takes a fortifying gulp of tea. "To say my final goodbye." </p><p>"I'm sorry," Harry whispers. Everest, along with Norberta (Hagrid's dragon that Harry and his friends shipped over to Romania in their second year), are the last two Norwegian Ridgebacks in the sanctuary, and Everest's poor health put a dent in their plans for captive breeding in order to save the numbers of Ridgebacks in the wild. </p><p>"If he dies because of old age, I would've accepted it!" Charlie rages. "But they poached him right from under our noses, hurt him and drugged him just to make potions ingredients off of him illegally. We got him back, healed him, but he's still going to—" He breaks off, looking away. "I don't want another earring, Harry," he whispers, broken. </p><p>A lack of funding, aging equipment (such as dragon trackers and alarm systems), too little staff and the increased sophistication of poachers' tools spelled bad news for the sanctuary. As Charlie is a teacher at Hogwarts to be nearer to his family and to mould the next generation of conservationists and magizoologists, he could not stay on at the sanctuary as a paid worker, so he remains as a volunteer during holidays.</p><p>Pork Chop herself was a victim of the wildlife trade that eventually found refuge in the sanctuary; Ashwinder eggs are a prized potions ingredient. Traffickers caged her, pumped her full of drugs and hormones, cast spells on her to force her to continue laying eggs. Because of their abuse, she is now sterile and can survive past the typical hour-long lifespan of Ashwinders.</p><p>After Harry left the Academy, he visited Charlie at Romania, just to see if the sanctuary was a possible career option. He met Pork Chop there. In the end, he didn't leave with a job, but a pet snake. She was furious and distrustful of humans after her terrifying encounter, but under Charlie and Harry's patient and tender care, she healed, morphing into this snarky, pork chop-loving, smart-arse snake that they've come to know and love.</p><p>Speechless, Harry simply pats Charlie's hand and squeezes. He squeezes back, and Pork Chop engulfs a sniffling Charlie into a fierce hug. After a quiet moment, Harry grabs their empty mugs and heads to the sink. There’s an extra mug. "Someone was here?" </p><p>"Yeah. Draco came to say goodbye before he left for France." </p><p>"Oh." </p><p>Harry ran into Malfoy on the way to Charlie's. Malfoy was carrying his bags. </p><p>
  <i>"You're leaving? So soon?" </i>
</p><p>
  <i>"Yes. Mother tends to be rather maudlin around December, because of Christmas and... well, Father passed away in the month of December, so I usually leave as early as possible for Christmas."</i>
</p><p>
  <i>"Oh. Please send her my regards, then. Happy Christmas, and see you next term." </i>
</p><p><i>"Same to you. Goodbye, Potter."</i> </p><p>Harry is disappointed, knowing that Malfoy is no longer near him, as if he's missing something. He washes the mugs and places them on the rack to dry. He turns around, his back to the sink and his palms resting on the edge. He doesn't know if it's a good time to talk about this, but Harry really needs some advice, and who better to help him than Charlie, Malfoy's closest friend in Hogwarts? </p><p>"Er. I might chase him after all," he says. Charlie shouldn't be surprised at this announcement — he's made fun of Harry for mooning over Malfoy throughout term.  </p><p>"Are you really going to?" Charlie grins, although he’s still tugging on his dragon earring. "It's about bloody time, then." </p><p>"D’you reckon it’s a bad idea? Has he said anything about me? Does he still hate me?" Harry plops back on his seat opposite Charlie, frowning. "He can't hate me, can he? We've been getting on rather well." Still, Malfoy is bloody inscrutable at times, and Harry can't figure him out, even though he knows his mannerisms and some aspects of his personality as well as the back of his hand. </p><p>Charlie laughs in astonishment. "No, he certainly doesn’t hate you. He's more relaxed this term, not snapping at his students as much, and he's even smiling more than usual. Heard the students talking about him, asking what's happened over summer hols for this change." He raises an eyebrow. "Won't be surprised if it's because of you."   </p><p>"Yeah?" Harry says, hopeful. "D'you think he'll make a move on me?" </p><p>"Doubt so. He's cautious, much too cautious if you ask me, and together with his pride..." Charlie sighs, smiling fondly with a faraway expression in his eyes, as if recalling a memory. "He's quite vulnerable, actually." </p><p>Harry is surprised to hear him describe Malfoy as vulnerable. </p><p>The older man fixes Harry with a stern look. "He's my friend, too. I won't have you hurt him." Harry doesn't have time to splutter in protest before Charlie continues, "I would advise you to go home and have a proper think about it during the holidays. Maybe you're feeling like this because you're cooped up here and seeing him every day, as if life is constrained to within these four walls. You might think better with a clearer head back in London. You know how impulsive you can get at times." </p><p>Yeah, Charlie does make sense, like he always does. This is something important that can't be rushed; Harry can't go haring off after Malfoy until he's truly sure that he wants him. He sighs. Would be nice to know if the attraction is mutual, though.   </p><p>"Any rule about going out with fellow teachers?" he asks. </p><p>Charlie shrugs. "I don’t know, I don't think Minerva has encountered anything like this before."</p><p>Harry leans back, drumming his fingers on his arm and his thigh jittering under the table. He's full of pent-up energy, wondering what to do about his feelings for Malfoy. He forces himself to calm down and take a deep breath. </p><p>Fine. He'll figure out what he really wants during hols, although he already suspects he's made up his mind — he wants Malfoy, both in his bed and in his life. He’s fallen for him — attracted to his patient smile and words when he teaches, his resilience and perseverance, and their quiet, thought-provoking midnight conversations. </p><p>
  <i>How can I play my cards right, how am I going to chase Malfoy to make him mine?</i>
