    <p><br/>Hermione said goodbye to her mum and dad once more, then stepped onto the Hogwarts Express. She looked around at the interior, taking in how similar it was to the trains she was used to, and sat on the nearest seat to watch the platform go by. Hermione waved to her parents. They waved back, smiling up at their daughter, disappearing from view as the train gained speed. Hermione sighed, turning around in the seat. As she considered digging out a book from her trunk, a worried-looking blond boy opened the door and stepped inside.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Have you seen a toad? I've lost mine,"</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>"I haven't, but give me a moment to put on my robes, and I'll be happy to help you look." The boy nodded, closing the door to the compartment and turning away to give her privacy should she need it. Hermione reached up for her trunk and pulled out a set of robes from within. She pulled them on over her regular clothes, then turned back to the boy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>"I'm Hermione Granger."</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Neville Longbottom. Thanks for helping me, Hermione."</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>"No problem, Neville. Now, where'd you see your toad last?"</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>After looking for Neville's toad for half an hour, Hermione was tired of it. She threw open the door to what felt like the hundredth compartment. Inside were three boys and three girls their age.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Hello, sorry to barge in, but poor Neville Longbottom's lost his toad. Have any of you seen it?" The others stared for a moment before one spoke.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>"No, sorry," One boy, the tan one with unruly black hair, told her.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>"I found him, Hermione! He was in my pocket the whole time!" Hermione wheeled around to face Neville. She smiled at him, concealing her true annoyance at having to search for something he'd had the entire time.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Good," Hermione turned around again, "He found the toad. Thanks anyway." Neville had left the compartment already, so she relaxed a bit.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Wait, d'you want to sit with us?" Another boy, blond and pale, asked.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Sure." She smiled at the little group, "I'm Hermione Granger. And you all are?"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Draco Malfoy," The pale boy stuck out his hand for her to shake. She did. " Harry Potter and Blaise Zabini. The girls are Pansy Parkinson, Millicent Bulstrode, and Daphne Greengrass." Draco indicated each person in turn, gesturing around the compartment. Hermione bit back her excitement at getting to meet Harry Potter, who was less of the sensation her books had made him out to be and more of a shy eleven-year-old. Pansy and Daphne drew her over to sit next to them; she obliged.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>"It's nice to meet you all." There were pleasant replies, which Hermione acknowledged, but she paid attention to Pansy and Daphne, who were discussing some magazine titled Witch Weekly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>"So, Hermione, which House do you think you'll be in? My family's been in Slytherin for centuries. It would be a shame if I'm not."</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Either Ravenclaw or Slytherin, I think. My parents tried to wrap their heads around this witch business, but they don't quite understand, which is alright. It's not their world, after all."</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Hold on," Pansy interrupted, "You're a Muggle-born? I couldn't tell." Hermione frowned.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>"I am. Is that a bad thing? If it is, I can leave. That Longbottom boy seemed rather nice."</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Pansy, please don't tell me you believe all of that nonsense?" Draco asked, "Hermione, most of us grew up in Pure-blood families who think we're better because all our family are wizards. That's not true, but they tried anyway. Pansy was just surprised, is all. Most Muggle-borns don't know as much as you do."</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>"And let us be thankful that you did not listen. I hope we can be friends." Hermione smiled at her companions. Harry, sitting next to Draco and mostly listening to the conversation, scooted forward in his seat.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>"My Mum was Muggle-born. When my parents died, I went to her Muggle sister and her husband. I'm glad school gives me most of the year away from the Dursleys," Hermione sighed. She and the others would have to keep an eye on Harry.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"You don't have to worry about them here, mate," Blaise chimed in, trying to lighten the mood.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Anyway, I'm sure you all are destined for Slytherin, right? Centuries-old family tradition and all that."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"How'd you know?"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Magic." Hermione wiggled her fingers as she spoke.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Harry, what about you? Which House do you want?" Pansy asked the boy, whose cheeks turned a light shade of pink against his darker skin.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Er, I'm not sure, to be honest," He admitted. "Mum and Dad were Gryffindors, but I'm not sure it's for me. Maybe I'll tell the Hat to put me in Slytherin."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Spoken like a true Slytherin, Harry."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Oh! Er, d'you lot know a boy called Ron Weasley? His family helped me find the train platform. When I told him I wanted to find Draco, he told me I could do it alone." Harry asks, remembering how confusing the whole interaction had been.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"He seemed alright when Neville and I were looking for Trevor." Hermione was confused. Maybe the Weasleys and Malfoys had some kind of rivalry?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"I don't know him that well, but his father and mine aren't on good terms," Draco replies whilst picking at his robes, "The Weasleys have a reputation of being, er, blood-traitors, since they're not all about blood supremacy." Hermione was right.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"So, Weasley doesn't like me because your dad and his don't like each other. Huh. He's, er, rather daft, isn't he?"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Let's not tell him the truth, then," Hermione says, a gleam of mischief in her eyes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"The Hat would be mad to put you anywhere but Slytherin, Hermione, with that attitude. Now, who wants to go looking for the trolley witch?"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hermione stepped off the Hogwarts Express and onto the station platform, grinning from ear to ear. This was so much cooler than Narnia!</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Slytherin!" The frayed, dirty hat on Hermione's head called out. The young witch beamed as she skipped to the table clad in green and silver. She properly introduced herself to Millicent, and two boys called Crabbe and Goyle. Another girl joined Slytherin; Pansy. She sat next to Hermione and grinned at her.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Hi again. We met on the train, right?"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"We did."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Pansy beamed at Hermione, who was beyond ecstatic. She'd only known about being a witch since July, but it was amazing, so far. Going to Diagon Alley, reading the books Mum and Dad let her buy there, taking the train to Hogwarts. Hogwarts itself. Hogwarts: A History didn't do it justice. Her books about Narnia seemed silly, now that Hermione knew she was a proper witch and could do real magic! While Hermione sat with her thoughts, Daphne Greengrass, who Draco had introduced to her on the train, became a Slytherin and sat next to Pansy. She didn't move to speak to Hermione, but that was okay. They could get to know each other better later. Draco Malfoy smiled at Hermione and moved to sit near Pansy and her. He'd been talking with some older students before then.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Hello again, Hermione," Draco said, offering the girl a smile. Hermione didn't get to reply, for another boy joined their ranks, Theodore Nott, and began chatting with the other first years. He insisted on them calling him Theo, though Hermione had the idea to call him by his full name anyway. Meanwhile, McGonagall called out the name of another boy, Harry Potter. Hermione almost wanted to join in the excited shouts and noise, but she'd met him on the train. Hermione had learned that Harry disliked the attention his fame brought. He wanted to be a regular boy. Well, as regular as you can be when you've got magic. She made a silent vow to speak with Draco about keeping an eye on Harry, he seemed so afraid. The whole Hall was silent as Professor McGonagall placed the Sorting Hat on Harry's head. Hermione, along with Draco, leaned forward a bit in her seat as she waited for the Hat to decide. What House will he be in?, Hermione wondered. After about a minute sat on the stool, the Hat finally gave an answer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Slytherin!" It cried. Around Hermione and Draco and Pansy, the whole table erupted into applause.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"We got Potter! We got Potter!" A few older boys yelled in their glee. Harry blushed and sat down next to Draco, opposite Hermione. A few other first years went to attack poor Harry with questions and the like, but Draco swooped in.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Leave him alone, will you?"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Hi, Harry," Hermione tried averting his attention away from the other Slytherins.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Hello. You were with our lot on the train, right?" Hermione nodded as Pansy, from Draco's other side, flashed a grin and moved to take the seat at Hermione's left instead.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"You remember Pansy, from the train, yeah?" Draco asked Harry, who nodded.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Hi, Pansy," Harry's voice, a soft tenor, was shaky; if anyone else but Hermione noticed, they said nothing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Hi," Replied Pansy, "I hope you and Hermione aren't too nervous about all this. I'm sure we all are at least a bit, but you're in safe hands." Hermione tuned out the conversation. She turned her attention to the High Table, where a boy called Ronald Weasley joined Gryffindor. So that was who Harry worried about! He looked harmless to her. Hermione was glad the Hat put her where it did. Those Gryffindors across the Great Hall were far too rambunctious for her taste. She preferred the quieter dignity of Slytherin. In the next few moments, another boy joined Slytherin, Blaise Zabini. Thus, their little circle of companions grew. Hermione grinned again; she'd had a few friends in primary school, though people disliked her. She wasn't amazing at first impressions, but at Hogwarts that didn't seem to be a problem. The other students talked to her first, not the other way round.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"I was nervous before, too. You'd be mad to not be." As she spoke, Hermione saw Harry relax a bit. She smiled at him, overjoyed when he turned it. At the High Table, the headmaster-Dumbledore, Hermione remembered- gave a few warnings and a few strange words. The tables were filled with food and they could tuck in. Hermione, like the others, busied herself by fixing a plate. She grabbed a bit of everything that looked good or that she knew, which was quite a lot. As she ate, Hermione noticed Harry eating very little. When she got to her last bite of mince pie, Hermione swallowed before looking at the boy, whose eyes were on the staff table. He made eye contact with a Professor in a turban. Harry might not have meant for them to, but Hermione and Draco noticed that he winced and turned away.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Harry, don't you want any more? You've barely eaten," she said, speaking softly so only Harry could hear. He shook his head.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"I'm ok," Harry's green eyes looking anywhere but at Hermione, he noticed how her hair was frizzier than when they'd arrived. Maybe it was the humidity? Hermione scooped some mashed potato and broccoli onto his plate while he was preoccupied. Hermione let her eyes drift to the staff table again, where Professor Snape was speaking with Quirrell and looking aggravated. She returned to her slice of mince pie, admiring the flaky crust.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Thanks, Hermione," Harry said after a few bites, "You don't have to look after me, y'know."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"You're welcome. I might not, but I'm your friend. I want to make sure you don't get into trouble."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"F-friend?" Harry stammered, "But we barely know each other." Hermione shook her head.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Pansy, Draco, Blaise, please help me explain to dear Harry that the whole point of being friends is to get to know people." The other three nodded their agreement, and Draco even reached up to ruffle Harry's already messy hair. He blushed, cheeks turning pink. Blaise and Pansy gave their own little remarks that Hermione didn't catch; she was busy trying to get Harry to eat more steak. He was much thinner than the others in their year; that wouldn't do either, Hermione decided.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"I didn't mean to cause a fuss. It's just… Nevermind," The food on the table had disappeared, quickly replaced by desserts. Hermione grabbed a piece of fudge for herself and another for Harry. She handed him his piece.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"We understand, don't we, Draco?" Hermione says, dragging the blond back into the conversation. She was glad there was someone else Harry had gravitated towards. Draco didn't mind, though, and Hermione was glad for it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Of course." Draco didn't get to finish, for Professor Dumbledore had stood and was giving another brief speech, to which Hermione didn't listen. The school's older students sang the school song until only two ginger-haired Gryffindors were left, singing to the tune of a slow funeral march. When they'd finished, Dumbledore turned them loose and allowed the Prefects to lead the first years to their respective dormitories; Hermione made sure to not lose sight of Harry. It would be just their luck that he'd drag behind and get lost. Luckily, though, Harry strayed not as the Slytherins made their way down into the dungeons, chatting amongst themselves.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Ugh, I've never been this tired in my life."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Shut up, Draco."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"<em>No</em>."</p>
<p>Hermione looked away from her companions to see that they had stopped in front of a wall bordered by columns on either side.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"The password is Salazar," Their Prefect escort, Gemma Farley, told the first years and anyone else who was listening. She led them inside once a large hole had appeared in the wall. Hermione was ready to find her dorm and go straight to bed; thankfully, Gemma told them where to go.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Dormitories are down those corridors. Left for boys, right for girls. The doors are marked by year, you'll know which is yours. I know you're all tired, but please stay in the common room. Professor Snape should be along shortly. He usually gives first years a little speech." Gemma says, taking a seat in the nearest armchair. A boy about her age sat on the settee opposite. Hermione joined the others in her year in sitting about the large room. Moments later, Professor Snape entered the room. He wore swishy black robes and his long, dark hair was greasy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"I shall make this quick, as I'm sure we would all like to get to bed as soon as possible. Welcome, first years, to Slytherin. I am your Head of House and Potions professor, Severus Snape. I hope that you will turn to myself, another teacher, or a Prefect if you ever need help. We are here to guide you on the path to being the best witch or wizard you can be. Slytherin is possibly the best house for that purpose. While we serpents may have a bit of a nasty reputation, you should soon find that not everyone is a He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named in the making. Now, you may go to your dormitories. Good night." Hermione followed Pansy and Daphne into their room, Tracey Davis and Millicent behind her. The room, spacious and circular, had five beds and large windows that looked out at the lake. Hermione quickly found her trunk in front of the bed nearest the bathroom. She and the other girls changed into their pyjamas, and crawled into bed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Good night," Hermione said to no one in particular and turned over on her side. She fell into a pleasant sleep.</p>
