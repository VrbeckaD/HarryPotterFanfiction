</p><p>The Oak Woods had become invisible in their old age, just a passing blur to the motorists who sped by on their way to anywhere else. But for as little as the surrounding villages appreciated the beauty of the strong trees, there was magic in their roots. Centuries in the making, the Oak Woods stood proud and tall, practically humming with enchantments.</p><p>Nestled in a small clearing within the wood was a stunning manor. The gatehouse and keep were made of stone with numerous windows and slanting roofs. Gardens, both formal and informal, surrounded the structure. The lord of the house had sought out the isolation, and understood the inherent strength and endurance of the trees around the dell. He and his wife raised their three daughters in the magic little pocket, the Oak Woods a wall of protection from the filthy, non-magical world.</p><p>Fearless, the eldest daughter of the lord made her way through the trees that snagged her wild hair and clung to her ankles. The night was eerily quiet, her rustling movements and the snapping of twigs under her feet as she walked determinedly into the forest were the only sounds. The creatures that lived in these woods had long ago learned to stay hidden when she approached. She smirked to herself, admiring her solitude.</p><p>Arriving at the largest oak tree in the midst of the trees, she ran her fingers across the runes she had carved into its bark as a child. This had been her temple. She circled the tree, her fingers caressing it as she went, and catalogued all the sacred acts she had contrived here. Her first sacrifice had been a mouse from the kitchen trap. She had quickly realized it wasn’t enough and had slit the throat of a rabbit next.</p><p>“What sacrifice must I make to escape this sentence?” she mused. Her fury was bubbling within her. Her father had settled her betrothal that morning. She pressed her forehead against the oak and closed her eyes. Her thoughts played within her mind, images of her parents, the family tree, her Lord. Images of her betrothed, Rodolphus, as he stared at the blood traitor, Alice. “How can I persuade the Dark Lord to ask for my hand instead?” The oak offered nothing.</p><p>Bellatrix shrieked and spun away from the tree. “How will I survive this contract?” she snarled. The branches of the large oak began to move as if the wind had blown. She rushed to the tree and knelt down before it. Slowly, as she meditated beneath its canopy, a small smile graced her face. “Well, that is a sacrifice I am more than happy to make.”</p>
