    <p>The London Underground was full. Full of muggles and wizards, but you can not recognize who the wizards are, for they act like ordinary people, muggles. And some of these wizards were the Malfoy. Phoenix and Draco were headed toward the Hogwarts Express with their parents. Today is the first day of class, and they were excited, especially in knowing at last, in which house they will stay. Preferably Slytherin, because the family is predominantly from there.</p><p>Between stops 9 and 10, there was a column that, with the naked eye, was just that. But for the wizards, it would be the gateway to their true stop, the 9 Â¾.</p><p>"Lucius, go ahead with Draco. Me and Phoenix will come later. "</p><p>The man in black clothes, a staff and loose blond hair, stood beside the son, snobby and blond-haired, who carried the cart with his and his sister's things. They ran through the doorway.</p><p>"Prepared, Phoenix?" The black-haired woman mingled with threads of blond, elegant posture, named Narcissa, asks her daughter, with the same characteristics. The girl finally nodded and the two of them, holding hands, ran inside. Appearing at the spot where a train of red colors and the sign saying Hogwarts Express, stayed. The area was full of old and new students with their parents. The Phoenix smile was contagious, looking like she'd never seen magic. The quartet got together and started walking to the end of the train, which was where the seats of the Slytherin students sat.</p><p>Seeing Crabbe and Goyle, friends of Draco, in one of the windows, the family of the twins stopped.</p><p>"Well, this is where we left you," Narcissa said, her voice a little choked.</p><p>"Mother, you do not have to cry. At Christmas we'll be back. "said Phoenix.</p><p>"I know, my dear. But it is the first time that you will be without us. Draco, you know how to take good care of your sister. "</p><p>"Okay, Mom," said the proud boy for having a task for his mother.</p><p>"Mom, we're the same age and it's not just because he's older for a minute, I'll obey him," the girl demanded.</p><p>"Obey your brother, Phoenix." said with a closed face, Lucius.</p><p>The relationship between Lucius and his children, but mainly Phoenix, is a little distant. He cares about appearances, so he is rude to his children in public, for he has no forgiveness. Draco is more malleable, mainly because he is the future head of the Malfoy family, he has more respect for his father and his concepts. Phoenix is another story. With the kindness and love of her mother, she ends up being respectful to everyone, even elves and muggleborn. Her concepts are what Lucius works to keep non-existent in the wizarding world, the one of equality. Muggleborns and pureblood, in the eyes of Lucius, they are not equal. This has already resulted in constant fights and even, without the mother's consent, physical punishment. Well, now would be the time for him to be sure who his daughter is.</p><p>The whistle blew through the place, warning that it was leaving. With a kiss on each one's head, Narcisa said good-bye to the children, Lucius only one nod was enough. As they entered and closed the door, the train began to leave and through the window the twins parted their parents for the last time. As the train made the turn out of the station, the two headed to the cabin of Crabbe and Goyle. One was a skinny lean and the other fat, more like cabinets than people, Phoenix thought.</p><p>Draco smiled and spoke to the two of them as if they had not seen each other for decades, but they had spoken to each other yesterday by letter. Phoenix, however, only nodded, as her mother says, 'It's the right thing even if you do not like the person, it shows politeness.' This was the most constant education for the girl in her social life, to learn to be dry and direct, without showing many emotions, but elegant and formidable. And that moment would be one of them. She never liked Draco's friends, who look more like their bodyguards, had no mind of their own, and what little they had were concepts rooted in pureblood parents. Foolish. So she brought a book to distract herself, one of the many contained in the library of the Malfoy mansion, this was a special edition on the witch hunts in the world by the witch historian Iris Markle.</p><p>Conversations about the future at Hogwarts were exchanged, the famed Nimbus 2000 exalted and many sweets that came from the candy cart, were snapped. But no one prepared the hearts of the twins by Crabbe's novelty.</p><p>"Do you know the latest news?" He said with his mouth full.</p><p>Draco replied that no, Phoenix pretended not to hear, but listened.</p><p>"Harry Potter is back in the wizarding world."</p><p>Draco choked on the chocolate he ate, surprised Phoenix, but worried about her brother, slapped him on the back to see if he would normalize. The blonde who for a minute turned purple looked at his friend.</p><p>"Why did not you say that before? Since when do you know? "</p><p>"Since before yesterday, that was the day we went to Diagon Alley. There is nothing else in the Leaky Cauldron. "</p><p>"What an asshole! How do you forget to say that? "</p><p>The little boy did not know what to answer. Then a girl, already in her uniform, with curly hair, appeared in the cabin.</p><p>"Did you see a frog around?"</p><p>"Look at my face, who cares. Of course not. "Draco snapped..</p><p>"Do not talk like that. I'm sorry about my brother. "</p><p>"No problem. Well, if he's not here, I'll keep looking. See you. "And so she left.</p><p>After hitting the book against her brother's arm, Phoenix declared absolute silence in the cabin. The afternoon had fallen a little more and from far away came peaks of the castle towers, there they changed their clothes. When they had finished, the train was already slowing down a little, to a full stop. As they got out of the car, they were greeted by a giant named Hagrid. He led them to the edge of the lake where there was a pier full of boats. Divided between Crabbe, Goyle and Draco, and Phoenix with two other students, a boy and a girl, they set out to cross the lake. With the fog down, the towers and torches of the castle, showed themselves to the students, who opened their mouths in surprise. Hagrid escorted them to the main gate of the castle, and with instructions to climb the stairs, the students met a lady with green witches clothes and half-moon glasses under her eyes and a pointed hat on her head.</p><p>"Welcome to Hogwarts. Now, in a few moments, you will pass through these doors and join your classmates. But before you can take your seats, you must be sorted into your houses. They are Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw and Slytherin."</p><p>At that moment Draco turned to his sister and together they smiled. At the same time, the blonde sees a tan with shaggy hair, round glasses and a scar in the shape of lightning. It was him, Harry Potter. And nudging his sister and he nodded at the boy.</p><p>"Now while you're here, your house will be like your family. Your triumphs will earn you house points. Any rule breaking, and you will lose points. At the end of the year, the house with the most points is awarded the house cup."</p><p>A chubby, toothy kid, finally saw his frog at the professor's feet.</p><p>"Trevor!" and with the silence, the boy realized the bludgeon he gave. The teacher's eyes already spoke for themselves.</p><p>"The sorting ceremony will begin momentarily." And she goes to the great hall.</p><p>"It's true then, what they're saying on the train. Harry Potter has come to Hogwarts."</p><p>Students began to whisper.</p><p>"This is Crabbe and Goyle. And I'm Malfoy... Draco Malfoy and this is ..." but the blond did not continue, for a redhead at the side of the brunnette laughed at his name.</p><p>"Think my name's funny, do you? No need to ask yours. Red hair, and a hand-me-down robe? You must be a Weasley."</p><p>The girl did not like the redhead laughing at her brother's name, but he did not need to humiliate him.</p><p>"Draco, you do not need that. But well, you did not have to laugh. After all, my name is Phoenix, I'm his twin sister. I hope my name is funny enough. "</p><p>The redhead was all ashamed after her lecture.</p><p>"He did not mean to offend." Harry explained</p><p>"I know. I did not want to give a sermon either, but it came out. I'm impulsive when it comes to defend my family. "And back, the professor was, with a list in her hand. "We're ready for you now. Follow me."</p><p>The doors opened and four tables were in the middle of the room. On the ceiling, candles flew and illuminated the sky that appeared inside the castle. The girl in front of the Phoenix was the one who was looking for the frog earlier. She was explaining the effect of the ceiling. The front, up the steps, a bench was found with a hat worn on top of him. The professors' table stood in front of the bench.</p><p>"Will you wait along here, please? Now, before we begin, Professor Dumbledore would like to say a few words."</p><p>A gentleman with white hair and beards, with a pair of glasses in the middle of his nose, rose from the main table.</p><p>"I have a few start of term notices I wish to annouce. The first years please note that the dark forest is strictly forbidden to all students. Also, our caretaker, Mr. Filch has asked me to remind you that the 3rd floor corridor on the right hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does to wish to die a most painful death. Thank you."</p><p>And so he sat down. The professor opened the parchment.</p><p>"When I call your name, you will come forth, I shall place the sorting hat on your head, and you will be sorted into your houses. Hermione Granger."</p><p>The girl came out nervous, talking to herself. Phoenix hears the redhead saying something to Harry, but she paid no attention. Gryffindor was heard from the hat, and the table was filled with applause.</p><p>"Draco Malfoy."</p><p>And with a quick exchange of glances between the twins, the blonde sat down with courage and determination.</p><p>"Slytherin!"</p><p>And with the last exchange of glances with his sister, the blonde went to the table.</p><p>"There isn't a witch or wizard who went bad who wasn't in Slytherin." The redhead said, and this time Phoenix heard him. Tired of the redhead's prejudice, she decided to answer.</p><p>"Look who's talking. Isn't it one of your brothers at the Slytherin table? "And the redhead swallowed dry, looking to see Percy Weasley at the second table to the left. It was good gossip to last about a Weasley going to Slytherin. The Slytherins themselves were shocked, but soon they accepted him, by him proving a brilliant mind, not to mention that they had a good tact to tame the proud hearts of the house. "Besides, he can think for himself."</p><p>"Phoenix Malfoy."</p><p>The young woman hoped that the choice of house would be the same as her brother's, quick. But as soon as the hat was put on her head, he lingered to speak, as if he were still analyzing the person.</p><p>"A Malfoy and a Black. Strong blood runs through your veins, I can see, yes, Slytherin has a place for you. Although ... yes, strong determination, courage. Mind of a Slytherin, but a heart of a Gryffindor. You may think I am wrong, but one day you will thank me. Gryffindor! "</p><p>The applause was in the background, as the first person to look in the room was Professor Snape, who was on her right. And with a nod of encouragement, the girl went to the table of the chosen house, but not without first hearing a groan from Weasley "A Malfoy in Gryffindor?! That hat must be crazy!" . She just looked at the table where her brother was, he did the same. Susan Bones went to Hufflepuff and after that it was the turn of the prejudiced redhead. And unsurprisingly he went to the lion's house. The name of The Boy Who Lived was summoned and the room was completely silent.</p><p>"Hmm... difficult, very difficult. Plenty of courage I see, not a bad mind, either. There's talent, oh yes, and a thirst to prove yourself. But where to put you?"</p><p>At that moment the brunnette began to repeat that he did not want Slytherin. Yeah, the redhead influenced him well.</p><p>"Not Slytherin, eh? Are you sure? You could be great, you know. It's all here in your head. And Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness! There's no doubt about that. No? Well, if you're sure... better be... Gryffindor!</p><p>The table was filled with joy, Harry also. Phoenix applauded for mere behavior. After that, a few more names were selected and the selection was over.</p><p>"Your attention, please."</p><p>And as he rose from his chair, the director began the banquet. At the tables, food filled the boys' eyes with joy, even Phoenix who was worried a moment ago, was no longer due to the delicious dinner. The girl on the train, Hermione, made conversation.</p><p>"So, Gryffindor. It seems you were not very happy. "</p><p>"In some way, yes."</p><p>"That's where your brother is. Slytherin. It must be difficult to stay apart. "</p><p>"But we have classes to meet ..." and before continuing the sentence, a ghost appeared in the middle of the table, just as the ghosts of each house appeared to welcome them. The head boy of the Gryffindor House had a conversation with the ghost named Nicolas. The ghost has started to walk away when Ron recalled how he really is called Nicolas Nearly Headless.</p><p>"Nearly headless? How can you be nearly headless?"</p><p>"Like this."</p><p>It was a grotesque image, that of the head turning to one side, almost falling, were it not for a little of the skin to hold. After this incident, the dinner went well and to their homes the students went. Following the head boy, Hugh Duncan, the first-year students found themselves in the area where the changing floors and frames infested the walls. It took him but they came to a corridor that in the end, only had a picture of a fat woman. And with the password, they entered. Cozy was the feeling, you could say. A central fireplace, surrounded by a sofa and two armchairs, with a coffee table. Two scattered tables, with a few extra armchairs, and a staircase, were what they contained in the common room.</p><p>"Gather 'round here. Welcome to the Gryffindor Common Room. Boy's dormitories, upstairs and down to your left. Girls, the same on your right. You'll find that your belongings have already been brought up."</p><p>Phoenix discovered that she would share the room with Hermione and two other girls, whom she still did not know. And that was how she slept, with red and yellow mustard blankets.</p>
