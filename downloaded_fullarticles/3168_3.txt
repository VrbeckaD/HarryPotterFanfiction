</p><p>“You know, Granger, I’ve always wondered something.” Draco looked at Hermione, arching a brow.</p><p>Hermione turned to her lover. “Hmmm?” She snuggled deeper beneath the covers, her body still warm from their earlier bought of lovemaking.</p><p>“About the Horcruxes.” He looked to Hermione shiftily.</p><p>Hermione cleared her throat. “Draco… I…”</p><p>“I know you don’t like to talk about them, or what had happened.” He looked at Hermione sympathetically. “But…” He paused. “I have a question.”</p><p>Hermione nodded slowly. “You know, Draco, this isn’t very sweet pillow talk.”</p><p>He laughed. “Sorry,” he murmured, a light blush dusting his cheeks.</p><p>“Well, go on then,” Hermione encouraged. “Ask your question.”</p><p>“Why do you think Hufflepuff’s chosen item was a cup?”</p><p>Hermione stared at Draco before she burst out laughing. Draco looked at her, eyes wide in surprise. She shook her head at Draco’s confusing gaze. “I’m sorry, Draco, but I was expecting something much darker.”</p><p>“Hey!” he protested. “It’s a legitimate question.” He scowled. “Sorry that it wasn’t all dark and evil like you were expecting.”</p><p>Hermione scooted closer and kissed Draco. “To answer your question, I’m not sure. My guess would be that Hufflepuff was in charge of a lot of the cooking and cleaning in the castle - I think I read that household charms - or was it cooking charms - either way, I think the cup symbolises her skill area.”</p><p>“That doesn’t make sense when looking at the other House relics… Slytherin’s locket? Or the diadem?”</p><p>Hermione shrugged. “As I said, I’m not quite sure, and I doubt that it has been documented anywhere.”</p><p>“It’s just so random,” Draco mused.</p><p>“Come here, you,” Hermione murmured. “Why don’t we get some rest? We can research the cup more tomorrow.”</p><p>Draco laughed. “No, it’s not a burning question any longer.” He kissed her. “I’ll be sure our pillow talk is more appropriate tomorrow night.”</p><p>“You’re ridiculous,” Hermione teased, giggling as Draco kissed her.</p></div>
