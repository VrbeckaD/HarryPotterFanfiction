          <div class="userstuff"><p>Greg had taken Dudley for a walk along Diagon Alley. </p>
<p>“It’s fantastic,” admitted the Muggle as he looked through the window of the Magical Menagerie with wide eyes. </p>
<p>Greg laughed and slung his arm around Dudley’s shoulders.</p>
<p>“You reckon Duds?” Greg replied, pleased. “I ‘spose it’s different when you’re born wizard. Always hated coming down Diagon when I was younger. Reminded me of school uniforms and buying bloody spell-books.”</p>
<p>Greg looked around at the bright, cosy shop-fronts and saw them anew though his partner’s eyes. There was nothing Greg enjoyed more than the vicarious pleasure of showing Dudley his world.</p></div>
