          <div class="userstuff"><p>So what that your stomach has settled with a taste on your tongue that isn't even there?</p>
<p>This is what happens every time he turns to look at you. No, not Hugo or Louis or James. Sure, their eyes are similar…but, no, no, they're <em>not</em>. Fred Weasley—<em>Freddie</em>—doesn't just have brown eyes.</p>
<p>His eyes are <em>food for your soul</em>, and, darling, you've never been more starved.</p>
<p>"Brown" sounds like such a drab color. And it is, isn't it? It's called a "neutral" by fashionistas. It's the color of dirty things, of vile things. It's…<em>ouch</em>…the color of scabs.</p>
<p>But, hurt though it may sometimes to find him and laugh with him and stare back into his face, you find that his eyes have got so much to say about him. And it's right there in those chocolate orbs. Yes, chocolate, that melt-in-your-mouth substance that's been described in sensuous (and oft vulgar) terms.</p>
<p>His eyes are the chocolate to sooth your cravings, the coffee to fill your senses with their intoxicating aromas, and the dirt that smells so gritty and earthy and <em>natural</em> that you don't mind feeling like a beast sometimes when you think of what could happen if he were yours, <em>all yours</em>.</p>
<p>So what that your stomach has settled with a taste on your tongue that isn't even there? It's that itch you can't scratch—it's there, but it's not. It's… Oh, it's unquenchable, and if his eyes—full of laughter, of comfort, <em>of warmth</em>—really are mud or coffee or <em>delicious melted chocolate</em>, then perhaps he'll at least let you drown in them.</p>
<p>Yes, just this once…</p>
<p>…<em>take that forbidden sip</em>.</p></div>
