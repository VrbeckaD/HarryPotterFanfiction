    <p>
  <span>Harry was too busy running away from his cousin to realize his surroundings had changed, from alleyway to big, shiny and white building. He ran right into men and women in suits, skidding to a halt before running into one. The guy blinked and peered down at him before wrinkling his nose and moving on. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry’s eyes widened as he truly realized where he was, or at least that he was in a totally different area than he had been. He didn’t know where he was. Maybe this was like ending up on the rooftop after running away from bullies at school. He hadn’t known what had happened then. Harry shrugged and continued to walk, looking up at the walls and dodging well dressed men. And it was all men too. He didn’t see a single woman in the crowd as he walked. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>There were framed pictures of people on the wall as he walked through the hall, pictures of a group of soldiers that were grinning at the camera. Harry took in the sight of a logo finally, at the end of the hall and studied it. It was circular in design, an eagle with its wings stretched out protectively over a shield. It said the name of what Harry thought was an organization at the bottom. Strategic Homeland Intervention Enforcement Logistics Division. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry’s eyes widened a little at the logo and he wondered where he was, if this was… It sounded like some secret spy group or something. He knew that England had MI-5 but this didn’t look anything like that. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>A raised voice drew his attention behind him and he turned around, seeing an older man and a woman walking towards a door away from him. The woman had brown curly hair that was tinged with a little grey and she looked very impressive, very… much in command. The men in suits around the two were watching both the woman and the man intently, as if they were ready for any order or command from either of them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>In between the two was a young boy Harry’s age, with short brown hair and light brown eyes. He was looking around with wide eyes, awe in them as the older man started to talk. Harry tentatively walked over towards the boy, keeping his steps quiet in order to not draw attention from the adults. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry wasn’t paying too much attention to what the man and woman were talking about but he did hear them mention someone called Captain America. The boy giggled excitedly and Harry finally made it over to the boy’s side. The boy startled a little at his appearance as Harry met his eyes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s my dad,” the boy whispered, grinning a little. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He finally brought me to work with him. What about you? Where’s your dad?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry shook his head, feeling someone’s gaze on him and seeing the older woman peer at him. “I don’t have a dad. Mine’s dead. Car accident.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The boy’s eyes widened and then he held out his hand. “‘You don’t have a dad?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No. I have an… uncle and an aunt,” Harry murmured, reaching out to take the boy’s hand. They were of the same height and with the way the crowd was moving around them, it was perfectly easy to do. “Who’s your dad?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The boy grinned and gestured over to the older man that seemed to be in charge. “That’s my dad. Howard Stark. And Aunt Peggy. She’s awesome. ‘M Tony. What’s your name?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Harry.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tony nodded. “Are you seven too? Cause I’m turning eight soon.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, I’m 7. My birthday’s in July. Where are we?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Dad says I’m not supposed to talk about it to strangers but you don’t look like a stranger.” Tony leaned in towards him like he was about to impart a big secret. “My dad’s a spy.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry grinned. “Your dad’s a spy?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah. And he built all these amazing things! He’s gonna show people the engine I built too when we get home! You can come with us!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Tony, I don’t know…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is your uncle here? Can he give you permission to come home with us?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry stared at Tony before shrugging. “I don’t know where I am and I don’t think he cares where I am either. I was running from my cousin when I ended up here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tony’s eyes narrowed. “Why doesn’t he care? He should care.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know. He calls me a freak and I don’t know why he does that also.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tony blinked and tugged Harry over with him when they both saw Howard gesture to them. “Dad, Aunt Peggy, this is Harry. Is it alright if he comes home with us?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Howard Stark peered down at them, his eyes looking between his son and Harry. His brown eyes were darker than Tony’s and they weren’t really looking at Tony, only through him. As if there was something really interesting behind Tony and Harry shuddered a little, seeing enough familiarity in that look that he was reminded of Uncle Vernon. Harry stared at Howard, feeling as if it was Uncle Vernon in front of them instead of Howard. Vernon and Aunt Petunia both looked at him like that. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry shuffled closer to Tony, close enough that their shoulders were touching, and then peered up at Howard Stark and Peggy Carter.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, Tony, where are his parents?” Peggy questioned, kneeling down to be at eye level with them. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Howard spared a glance at them before walking off to talk with the other men. Tony’s eyes narrowed before he turned back to Peggy. “I want to show him the engine that I built. His parents already said it was alright.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“They did, did they?” Peggy remarked, lifting her shoulders in a small shrug. “I’m sure it would be alright with Howard. Howard?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, give the boy what he wants!” Howard called over, his eyes still on the man he was talking to. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Peggy raised an eyebrow and then sighed. “It is alright with me, Tony. Come on. I’ll take you home. Maria probably wants you home sooner than later, I suppose. Howard and the others can find their own way home for dinner.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tony nodded and grinned at Harry, who smiled.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Come on. It’s going to be great,” Tony whispered, holding out his hand for Harry. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry slipped his hand into Tony’s and followed his new friend back through the crowd of people. They jumped up into a car after leaving the building, passing through various security doors, and Harry’s eyes widened at the sight before him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>There were so many tall buildings lining the streets and Harry wasn’t too sure he was in the same city he had been in just an hour ago. The afternoon sun shone down on their car as it swerved around in traffic, driven by a man in a suit. Peggy sat in the front seat with him, looking some papers over.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Where am I?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“New York,” Tony murmured, his eyes glinting with interest. “I’m working on building a robot.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“A robot?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tony turned to look at him, his eyes wide with excitement. “You don’t know what a robot is?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry shook his head and Tony smiled wider. “It’s… Here, I’ve got bits and pieces.”</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>Tony looked over at Harry as the other boy looked over the pile of robotics and hardware. “See, this is what I’ve been working on. That claw over there is the start of something new.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry’s eyes were wide as he carefully stepped between the pieces of hardware. “All this is…Ah!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tony raced right over to Harry’s side as the boy yelped, tripped over a piece and then fell down. Tony hurried over and held out his hand as he saw Harry’s fingers touch another piece of electronic and helped the boy up. “Harry, are you alright?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah. I…” Harry trailed off, as he stood up with Tony’s help. He stared down at his fingers and then down at the equipment, his green eyes narrowed. The piece of electronic was sparking and Tony raised an eyebrow at it, picking it up. “What happened? I felt something… It was like when you get zapped randomly by touching something but...”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Did you touch this?” Tony asked, looking down at the random piece of electronics. It was still sparking in his hands and then he watched it sputter out and die.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah. I didn’t do anything though,” Harry muttered, his eyes widening as he looked back at the doorway. He flexed his fingers and met Tony’s eyes. “I didn’t break it, did I?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s dead but… I don’t think… Has that ever happened before?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry slowly shook his head before stopping. “My aunt can’t use her phone when I’m around.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tony nodded, tilting his head in confusion. “Maybe you can’t be around electronics? No, that’s silly. Let me take this apart.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry eyed him before nodding, following him out of his room and into the hallway. They could hear idle chatter from the living room or at least one of the living rooms. Tony ignored it, mostly. It was grown up talk though he always tended to listen when his father talked of finding Captain America. That was always fun. The thought of meeting his hero made his heart jolt.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you sure I didn’t break it?” Harry questioned as they walked down a set of stairs into Howard’s workshop. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, you didn’t. You’re my friend, aren’t you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry blinked, stopped in the doorway to look at Tony. “We’re friends?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tony nodded, looking at Harry. “Yeah. Friends for life.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry’s lips twitched up into a smile and then gestured to the workshop, his eyes widening a little. “Come on then. Let’s figure out what happened.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tony grinned and hurried over to his own desk, given as a Christmas present by Aunt Peggy. Harry stood by his side as he took apart the piece of electronic and they both looked it over. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know anything about electronics, Tony.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, good. More for me then.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry laughed and leaned into him. Tony smiled wider as he slipped his fingers through the tiny holes in it.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Boys, dinner time!” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Jarvis!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tony turned around to look at his father’s butler and elbowed Harry. “That’s Jarvis. He looks after my father and me and mother.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, I do. And who would this young boy be?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Didn’t Aunt Peggy tell you? He’s my new friend,” Tony whispered, seeing Harry nod. “Harry.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Edwin Jarvis dipped his head in a nod. “Very well. I am glad to see you have a friend. Come along for dinner. Did his parents say it was alright to have him over?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, they did,” Tony answered, gesturing for Harry to follow them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry nodded and fell into step with him, his eyes narrowed in thought. “Tony invited me over for dinner.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“As he is wont to do, I suppose. It’s your favorite for dinner tonight,” Jarvis remarked, as they walked back up the set of stairs. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I can’t wait to show my new engine to my father after dinner. I hope he likes it,” Tony said, grinning widely. </span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Dad!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Dad!” Tony raised his voice in an attempt to draw his dad’s attention, watching as Howard stood up from dinner and immediately walked out. Harry looked between the two, peering up at Maria Stark, Tony’s mother, who was talking intently with a guest. Howard Stark wasn’t even paying attention to his son and Harry reached out to curl his fingers into Tony’s hand.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tony stiffened and then turned to look at Harry, his brown eyes still peering at the form of his dad. They both watched as Howard Stark left the room and walked down the hallway then turned into another room, shutting the door behind him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I think your new engine looks great,” Harry offered, shrugging a little. “I’m no expert though.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tony stared at him, his eyes a little watery and then nodded. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jarvis stepped out of the backroom and stared down at the two of them. “Best time for bed, Tony. Is Harry staying over for the night?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you want to stay over?” Tony asked, wiping his unshed tears frantically, his eyes wide.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course I do. If it’s alright with you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You can share my bed. Jarvis, is that alright?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jarvis sighed and nodded, kneeling down to offer Tony a tissue. Tony took it and blew his nose. Harry squeezed Tony’s fingers and the boy met his eyes.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Where’d you get that scar anyway?” Tony whispered as they both slipped underneath the covers. “It looks like a lightning bolt.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry shrugged and pulled the covers around himself tighter. “I don’t know. My aunt says I got it in the car crash that killed my parents but I get nightmares sometimes.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nightmares about what?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“A green light and… a laugh.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“An evil laugh?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry thought about it and then nodded, meeting Tony’s eyes. “Yeah. An evil laugh. You're thinking about taking over the world?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tony vehemently shook his head. “No! Jarvis and mother wouldn’t like me if I did.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry laughed quietly and Tony grinned. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’d still be your friend if you took over the world,” Harry said, yawning and burrowing deeper into the covers.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I would be too if you took over the world. We’ll be friends forever, right?” Tony confirmed, raising an eyebrow.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes.” Harry watched as Tony’s eyes closed and shuffled closer to the other boy and then slowly fell asleep himself. The last thing before falling asleep was Tony reaching out his hand and Harry reached out too, entwining their fingers together.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry woke up to Dudley stomping down the stairs above him, making his heart jolt and his eyes widen. He pulled on his glasses and squinted, yanking on the light above him, and letting out a deep sigh at the sight of his cupboard. Tony was nowhere to be seen and he wondered if it had all been a dream. </span>
