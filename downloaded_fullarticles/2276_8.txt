    <p>Severus was busy picking up some weeds in the Forbidden forest. It had been a few weeks since the 'Bank Visit' and he was still in contact with the Goblin King as Severus was declared a friend and royal (hhmm, do not want to say concubine/slut as he does get asked questions on how to deal with wizards at times). Anyway, as Severus walked along a well worn path that he made over the years, he was constantly under stress. He could feel multiple eyes on him and it was making him uncomfortable and having him leave earlier than intended. </p><p>He made his was down another walked path and heard the growls. "Shit." mumbled Severus as he knew it as the full moon but werewolves hardly came here and the Centaurs were nice enough to warn him about them if they were nearby not to mention the Spiders. Severus glanced behind him and sure enough a massive werewolf was watching him. He took a step forward but there was a werewolf there as well. He set his basket of ingrediants down and then...ran like hell. He shot off a few spells behind him and started to zig zag through the trees but the wolves were right behind him and it seemed to be that these two were...Severus's eyes widened as he realized they were chasing him in a direction they wanted him to go. The brown one, snapped at his cloak and causing Severus to go down with it, but he was up again as he shot off more spells. The second wolf was watching and making sure this breeding bitch was going where the pack agreed upon spot and they were there. </p><p>Severus was out of breath and then saw that he had been chased into a clearing. This clearing was small, surrounded by trees and a brook ran at the edge, barely noticable. Severus heard the growls and was surrounded by a group of 10 werewolves. Severus got ready to be killed but as the largest one (black with bright yellow eyes) got on its hind legs, Severus saw the large 9 in cock that was dripping profusely on the forest floor, and the large knot at the base, the blasted thing was close to Buckbeak's width and Severus saw the other wolves standing up and their own cocks in the same state and roughly the same size. </p><p>"Well, damn." Severus thought as he knew where this was going.</p><p>______________________________<br/>I wanted to write this down and get it started so hope you all enjoyed and stay tuned!</p>
