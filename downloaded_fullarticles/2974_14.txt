    <p>Floating on the river were numerous paper boats with written wishes. They varied in size, colour and intent, and this accurately described their owners. A crowd of teenagers ranging in age and gender stood side by side awaiting their fate. Few of these people would grow to become famous, respected, even worshiped. Some will become enemies and outlaws of the land.</p><p>And yet still, most will be anonymous, unknown and unheard. But before that, they need to pass the selection today. In this sea of teenagers is one Harry Potter, the son of the Minister of defence and his lowest ranking yet most beloved concubine, Lily Potter.</p><p>Due to his mother’s background as a commoner and concubine, Harry is the least favoured of his father’s children. In addition to his lack of political backing, he also lacks physical strength, and has been sickly since birth. However due to his father’s love for his mother, Harry is not completely shunned in his family.</p><p>Hence, why he is standing among the teenagers gathered in the palace of Eternal Knowledge in the forbidden city. A palace modelled after a famed palace of the same name by earlier predecessors in eastern part of the world eons ago.</p><p> </p><p>The selection process started three months ago, and today is the final selection. He remembers the exact moment his father received a missive from the imperial palace proclaiming the Emperor’s desire for concubines. He had just turned fifteen three days prior to the reception of the letter. His father’s solemn countenance was an indication that the request was not to be denied.</p><p>When Harry initially reached the entrance of the forbidden city and saw a multitude of carriages and palanquins being guided into the palace, he was instantly nervous. His palanquin joined the queue and eventually, was ushered into the entrance. He was helped out by a palace maid and almost went back inside from fright. The girls and boys waiting with him were incredibly beautiful and well dressed.</p><p> </p><p>The clothing he was wearing was one of the three silk robes he owned, and he was willing to bet that these people practically bathed in silk. He swallowed the feelings of inadequacy emerging from within and relaxed his facial features, channelling his usual calm and quiet nature. He took a spot by a lone flower to the left and waited until the gugus (<em>senior maid servants</em>) came to take them to the waiting area.</p><p> </p><p>“Light and Dark military banners line up accordingly,” they were told by one of the gugus.</p><p> </p><p>He left the corner and joined the girls and boys standing under the light military banner. He had passed numerous selections in which they were observed by the gugus. This was the audition in which they would be personally observed and interviewed by the emperor/the kings and the empress dowager. They were lined up two per row and informed about the rules of the selection.</p><p> </p><p>“You have passed previous auditions and now you will be presented to the Empress dowager. This is a great honour, but do not be nervous. If you follow the imperial rules, you will be fine.” The lead gugu stated.</p><p> </p><p>“You shall be brought to the empress dowager to be interviewed personally. If chosen, the eunuch will announce your name board to be kept and a perfume sachet will be given to you. If not chosen, he will announce for your name board to be removed and he shall bestow a flower unto you and be allowed to go home,” She continued.</p><p> </p><p><em>Well that didn’t sound so encouraging, </em>he grimaced.</p><p> </p><p>“If you receive a perfume sachet, it either means you will be kept or you could be immediately betrothed to someone of noble birth. But if you are more fortunate, you shall become a concubine and enter the Imperial palace.”</p><p> </p><p><em>The news just keeps getting better and better</em>, he mused.</p><p> </p><p>“Once you receive your titles, all that is needed is to wait for an auspicious day to enter the Forbidden city.” She stated again, making the candidates more excited than they previously were; if that was possible.</p><p> </p><p>As if to dampen their spirits, she continued, “Your fortune will depend on your destiny,” with a bright smile.</p><p> </p><p>They marched with their heads held high into the city gates that held their fate. Through all this, Harry never stopped praying. He did not want to be chosen. When they reached the waiting hall, the teens started chatting again and formed little cliques to talk. It was amusing to Harry who recognized how these same people would most likely become the worst of enemies. No matter how dignified, teenagers will be teenagers. Harry's eyes strayed to his sisters.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Along with Harry, his father had five other children. One from his wife, and four from his four concubines. Harry has three sisters and two brothers. His eldest brother Camden, is the legal heir, born to his father’s legal wife Nancy. After Camden, follows his two sisters, Alice and Catherine. Alice is his father’s first concubine Patricia’s daughter. Catherine is His father’s third concubine Emily’s daughter. Then follows Harry from his father’s fourth concubine Lily, and finally, his youngest brother and sister Evan and Sarah from his father’s second concubine Faustina. Alice and Catherine were both standing in the crowd of candidates to see whether they were selected or not. He can probably guess what their wish boats say.</p><p> </p><p>Alice's would definitely make reference to being selected as this was her last chance. As for Catherine... Well Harry doesn't know what to think of his sister, so he went back to his thoughts. The missive said all young men and women of marriageable age were to participate in the selection.</p><p>Seeing as this was the last year for his sister Alice to be included in the selection, his father was more than enthusiastic to send her to the palace. Among the semi-finalists were most of the Elite Children, including Draco Malfoy, Blaise Zabini, Hannah Abbot and Neville Longbottom.</p><p>He, as the lowest ranking among his siblings, was not worried about the final selection. He was not going to make it. This was an accepted fact that all in his position knew. The palace had a reputation to uphold, therefore they graciously accepted all candidates, however the least influential children never made it past the semi-finals.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>From birth, his future was already set in stone. As an ineffective spare, he was destined to Marry an old woman or man as their young concubine by age sixteen, and live quietly without bringing shame to his father’s name, seldom seeing his family-not that they were all that eager to embrace him. With this in mind, Harry proceeded to observe who would be chosen instead. Without a doubt, the Malfoy boy would make it, seeing as the second King Lucius was his uncle.</p><p>Of course, the Malfoy boy was very beautiful with waist long straight light blonde almost white hair, a lean body and surprisingly wide hips for a beta-boy but then of course he was a hermaphrodite.</p><p>Perhaps the Zabini boy would pass also, his house is well acquainted with the Malfoys. And him begin a hermaphrodite didn't hurt either.</p><p>Longbottom is a hit or miss, although technically the legal heir, and therefore shouldn’t be included in the selection by default, his lack of presence led to his younger brother being made the heir instead. As He contemplated, The Empress Dowager and one of the Kings was escorted to their thrones to give the final verdict.</p><p> </p><p>He reluctantly brought his attention back to the Empress dowager and the King. As their throne was far from where the candidates were standing, their faces were impossible to decipher, so Harry allowed his eyes to rest on the shoulder of the King’s throne and waited for the inevitable.</p><p>As predicted, the Malfoy boy passed, along with Blaise Zabini; they were bestowed a sachet. Hannah Abbot was bestowed a flower and was rejected, and so on and so forth. As the line dwindled and it came closer to his sisters, he breathed deeply and calmed his racing heart.</p><p>He really wanted them to succeed. Although he had made peace with his fate of being married off, his sisters still dreamed of being adored by their husbands. Usually proud and insufferable, they had been disturbingly cheerful and enthusiastic since the beginning of the selection, convinced that they would be selected and dotted upon by the kings and even the emperor.</p><p>They had made him uncomfortable to the point where he even went to the temple to pray for them to be chosen so they could go back to their previous character.</p><p> </p><p>Alice was called upon, and she gracefully knelt, employing her handkerchief to kowtow to the empress dowager and king. She recited the usual greetings of blessings and was then silent as she was examined by the two royals on the throne. The Empress dowager asked her many questions pertaining to her knowledge, background and even favourite flower. After careful questioning, she was bestowed a sachet.</p><p>Harry sighed in relief. This means less people at home to pester him. Regrettably, Catherine was bestowed a flower and was rejected. She could come back in three years to try again so he didn't dwell on it too much.</p><p>But Harry still saw the tears of frustration and humiliation in her eyes as she knelt to receive the flower. He felt bad for her. He knew how much she prides herself on her beauty. The visage of the king was obscured by the curtain hanged in front of him to block the sun.</p><p>He blanked his mind and looked down at his feet in an effort to avoid the gaze of the king he could feel on all of them. He peeked through his bangs and saw him shaking his head at the candidates in the line one by one. He breathed, relieved. A few people were ahead of Harry, and by the time it was his lineup’s turn to greet the royals, the king was impatient.</p><p>One by one, the boys and girls in his line up were rejected after careful consideration by the Empress dowager and the king until they arrived at the last person in the line-up, Harry.</p><p> </p><p>“Ming-Hui, daughter of Al-Xi deputy of commerce, is dropped. Bestow a flower! Alex Kingsley, brother of…” the eunuch at the side of the emperor named off the candidates being rejected.</p><p> </p><p>As each flower was bestowed, the Empress dowager’s eyes continued to reproach her son's lover subtly, so when Harry knelt to recite the ritual blessings upon the royals, the king simply pointed and said, “That one, mother.” Harry's smile froze in horror on his small face when the eunuch announced, “Harry James Potter, son of James Potter, Minister of defence is kept. Bestow a sachet!”</p><p> </p><p>His eyes watered for a brief moment and he gritted his jaw before curtsying to the king and empress dowager in thanks, “Thank you for your kindness your majesty,” he recited mechanically.</p><p> </p><p>After they were ushered out, he almost broke down. He was in shock. Harry’s hands shook. This could <em>not </em>be happening. <em>This </em>was not the script. His entire life was based on rules and regulations pertaining to what he can and cannot do.</p><p>What he was and was not. He was not supposed to be accepted, and he cannot be a concubine to the emperor! Harry felt as though he couldn’t breath after he left the presence of the royals, his heart was in his throat.</p><p>He was selected. Him, a commoner’s child was going to become the emperor’s concubine. He had just traded one prison for another one. He laughed mirthlessly and calmed his heart and blinked away unshed tears. His eyes glinted with sorrow as he walked back to his palanquin.<em> What a cruel joke.</em></p>
