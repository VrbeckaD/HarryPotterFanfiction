    <u>A Simple Rose</u>
  </p>
</center><p>I could always think better out of doors, but unlike Godric I didn't always need to be doing something. Rowena and Salazar always headed to their offices or in Rowena's case, the library. I, on the other hand, preferred to just meander round the forests and the grounds, not necessarily looking for something, just watching the world. I smiled to myself, rich earth clinging to my fingers. The day was bright and surprisingly warm, I'd long cast aside my mustard yellow cloak and instead was just wearing a plain, brown work dress. I pushed back a tendril of hair, realising all too late that I had left a smear of mud on my cheek. Oh well, it hardly mattered. I carefully removed the potted plant and placed it amongst the bed of other herbs. I attempted to rub my cheek with my shoulder. Once the plant was in and the earth firm around the base I leant back on my heels, enjoying the warm air and the coolness of long cast shadows, as the pine trees quavered in the wind. Perhaps I would take a walk around the lake once I was done, it was unlike my home, but I enjoyed the grey, still water and thick forests. I got up and brushed my hands down my apron.</p><p>"You look like a peasant." A voice sneered.<br/>
I turned to look at Salazar as he walked down the hill, that ever present swagger and easy grace so obvious with his walk. When he stopped beside me he assumed a pose that would have looked overly practiced normally, but for him it was always easy. I rolled my eyes and picked up my tools, depositing the trowel and fork into the wicker basket by my side.<br/>
"And you look like a lord who's never done an honest day's work in his life." I bit back.<br/>
He smiled coolly at that, "Nicely played."<br/>
"Checkmate." I replied and he laughed; I was almost surprised, Godric and I tended to be the ones who laughed, Rowena certainly did at times but she did not appreciate simple humour, Salazar tended to just give a small smirk. The laugh he gave was still controlled and quiet, but I smiled at him and then continued walking down the path. I heard him follow quickly.<br/>
"Does my company displease you, Helga?" he asked.<br/>
"Nay, Salazar. But as I am 'peasant' I thought my company would be displeasing for you."<br/>
Salazar gave another even smile, "I shall overlook it."<br/>
I continued on my way, Salazar's tread beside me, before reaching a number of bushes I had planted. My fingers curled round several unopened, green buds and I couldn't hide my childish smile on seeing the small, sharp pink-red thorns. I was hoping for a pale white blossom. A long fingered, elegant hand rested near mine and I looked up to Salazar examining the plant.</p><p>"I do not recognise this. It is no magical plant or herb, I take it?"<br/>
I grinned, "Nay, this is a simple wild rose. Found all over this isle."<br/>
He frowned further, "Then what is its use?"<br/>
I carefully inspected the leaves for blight or insects, but was content with what I saw, "Alas, it has none. It is but a flower to look fair and smell sweetly. Though there are some who say it relieves aches, especially those of the stomach, yet mint and wormwood work better."<br/>
"Then why grow it at all?" his dark eyes near glared into mine, and I almost took a step back as though I feared him, yet what I felt was not fear in its entirety. I could feel a steady blush crawl to my cheeks and my heart takes a faster pace.<br/>
"I…I…Well, you all gave me the grounds and gardens to do with as I please."<br/>
His lip curls slightly, "To plant useless flowers? It would serve us better if you planted cabbages."<br/>
"I have already done that, the vegetable patch is doing nicely." I say a little proudly, jutting out my chin somewhat.</p><p>Salazar snickers and takes my chin within his grasp, I can feel my mouth drop slightly and a burning sensation when his fingers touch me.<br/>
"You ought not to do that, your face is too round to look proud." Salazar drops his hand and folds his arms over his chest, his eyes still on the roses. He makes a soft 'Hmm' sound and after ignoring my annoyed look I turn to face the roses as well.<br/>
"I like them. Can we not enjoy the things we find the most rewarding? Cannot something belong in our life, even though there is no real reason for it belonging there?" He looks puzzled for a moment, then swiftly turns on heel and goes back up the path. I run to catch up with him, cursing the long skirts I am wearing and my heavy boots.<br/>
"Have I offended you, Salazar?"<br/>
He keeps walking, even when I speak. "Nay, not at all."<br/>
"Then why are you walking away from me?"<br/>
"Am I? I assumed we both had work that needed to be done."<br/>
I grab hold of his sleeve and ignore the grimace he gives on seeing my muddy hands.<br/>
"Would you mind releasing me, this tunic was only washed this morning."<br/>
I rolled my eyes, "By magic, it won't take too much difficulty in flicking your wand and getting the soap to scrub it again."</p><p>I still pull away my hand, but he remains watching me.<br/>
"What did I say that angered you? I'd rather know it now, then have you trying to get me to guess."<br/>
"I assure you, you have said nothing that has angered me."<br/>
"Then why the sudden…?" I begin, but he raises his hand to stop me.<br/>
"I was going to write down your question and bring it up this evening; it would make a most interesting discussion. Do the things we love come easily to us? Or must we for ever suffer in their name? Perfection."<br/>
His tongue seemingly caressed the words he spoke. I shivered. He frowned once more and pulled my cloak more tightly around me, I was acutely aware of how tall he was in comparison to me. It wasn't too hard to be taller than myself, but somehow I was more aware of it with Salazar…maybe it was the arrogance, after all he looked down on me, in both senses of the word. Which was strange, Godric was taller than all of us, but I felt protected by his strength and stature. Rowena's grace stemmed from her elegant, slim figure and gently, swaying hips. My rounded figure and curves were more motherly than anything else.</p><p>"You are occupied?" Salazar said, that familiar smirk back. I shifted away from him and made my way up the path.<br/>
He gave another laugh, "What have I said that has offended you?"<br/>
"Nothing…I just…" he caught up with me and clasped my elbow.<br/>
"What is it?"<br/>
My cheeks reddened again and I cursed the day I was given pale skin. He vehemently scowled, until lines cut into his forehead and sharpened his nose. He was waiting for an answer.<br/>
"I was just thinking about how short I am." I said.<br/>
He smiled somewhat, "How short you are? By all things living, the vanity of women…"<br/>
"I am not vain." I snapped, "I have no desire to be any taller than I am now, I was just merely thinking of how everyone else is a good deal taller than I. It was purely an observation, not a desire."<br/>
"An observation well made, you are shorter than everyone else." he teased.</p><p>I sighed and moved my arm away again.<br/>
"Now may I continue walking?" I asked.<br/>
He gave a solemn bow, but still followed me as we made our way towards the main entrance. We continued thus, until reaching the carved doorway.<br/>
"Do I irritate you?" Salazar asked.<br/>
"You irritate everyone." I replied.<br/>
"But you especially, do I irritate you?" I thought for a moment, shrugged and stamped my muddied feet on the steps.<br/>
"I think irritation is something of a waste, it is futile to let yourself grow angry by the teasing of others."<br/>
"But do you grow irritated by my teasing?" he came nearer to me; resting a hand on my basket so I lingered by the door. I was drawn to his eyes once more, they were such a dark grey, they were near black in colour. My cheeks flushed again and I bit my lower lip, shifted my weight from one foot to the other. He brought his hand up to my arm.<br/>
"Or do you relish my teasing?" he smirked, his eyes sparkling as though ablaze with fire.<br/>
I smiled back and shrugged, "I tend not to think on it."<br/>
I gently pushed him away and walked into the corridor, he hastily followed but I quickened my pace.<br/>
"Helga, that is not a proper answer." Salazar called to me. I giggled.<br/>
"You are treading mud all over the stairs." he tried again.<br/>
"Then you can clean it up, the magic should not be too difficult." I laughed.</p>
