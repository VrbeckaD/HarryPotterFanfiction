      <strong>The Trial</strong>
    </em>
  </span>
</p><p>Harry sighed sitting down on the chair, head in his hands, he killed Voldemort yesterday, and he was… broken?</p><p>He felt like if a part of him died and he didn't even know why he was starting to think that the small piece of soul took with him more than necessary.</p><p>He grunted then started drinking some water, he was at 12 Grimmauld places alone, with a small light illuminating the room.</p><p>He mourned those who died in the battle, Remus and Luna… they disappeared when the battle took place, they couldn't find their corpses.</p><p>The twin died protecting some first years.</p><p>And how many other innocents died…?</p><p>It doesn't matter human or creature.</p><p>Harry could partly understand why the creatures decided to help Voldemort, after all, they didn't have rights, they were treated worse than animals in some cases , their younglings were kidnapped and sold in the market, not even being illegal, their body parts sold for potion ingredients…</p><p>It makes him sick.</p><p>It's while thinking about this that an owl asked to let him go in, Harry raised an eyebrow then getting up, at his full 5'7 he walked toward the window and opened it, the Owl entered rapidly then letting a small note in the place, got away as fast.</p><p>Harry's nose twitched, the owl didn't even take a pause…</p><p>With a sigh, he walked toward the table once again and started reading the letter.</p><p>

    <em>I'm waiting for you at Diagon Alley.</em>

    <em>Ron</em>
  </span>
</p><p>Harry was a little confused, Ron has told him that he wanted time alone after the battle, and the writing was a bit weird, yes it was Ron, but it seemed to be trembling, did something happen?</p><p>He got up then changing himself into something better; he decided to stop his mourning, for the moment.</p><hr/><p>Harry looked around Diagon Alley, there were a lot of places that stand shattered, you would have thought that with magic it would come back to normal quickly, but it wasn't the case… they say that it could take some months before it comes back to what it was in the past.</p><p>It wasn't difficult to pinpoint Ron, strangely the alley was desert, and there was just Ron, Harry could feel something wasn't right, his instincts were telling him, but he decided to ignore them and walk toward Ron, who was crossing his hands, his back to the wall and looking down.</p><p>When Ron hears someone coming his way, he looked up with a frown.</p><p>"Hey, Ron" murmured Harry with a small smile but Ron glared, making Harry confused.</p><p>"Ron…?" he tried to ask him what was bad but suddenly he found himself surrounded, by Aurors.</p><p>"Wh-"</p><p>Ron sneered at Harry then walked toward the Aurors, ignoring the look of confusion and hurt in Harry's face.</p><p>"Harry James Potter, you are under arrest for the murder of You-know-who and the use of Dark spells!"</p><p>One of the Auror that surrounds him announced, holding his wand higher when Harry by instinct moved his hand to his wand.</p><p>"What is the meaning of this?" asked Harry growling, turning at Ron, who looked down at him from his nose.</p><p>"How could you, Harry!" yelled a familiar girl and when Harry turned toward where the voice came from, he saw Hermione crying with a face full of fury.</p><p>"I don't understand…"</p><p>He didn't understand, he killed Voldemort, okay, but they all forced him to do this!</p><p>And what the hell do they mean by Dark magic!?</p><p>"Hermione, I don't understand" he tried to tell her, but she glared.</p><p>"Harry, of all people you had to become Dark…?" she asked then started walking away.</p><p>"TRAITOR!" yelled Ron and Harry turned back to look at Ron, who was now some centimeters of him, hand up and sending a punch to his face.</p><p>" Mr Weasley!" some of the Aurors came to Ron and took him by the arms, taking him away.</p><p>"It's your fault, your fault that all of them died, the twins… monster!" screamed Ron while being taken away by the Aurors, making Harry even more confused, he really couldn't understand what was happening.</p><p>The Auror from before warned ;</p><p>"I will not repeat myself a second time, Mr Potter, you're asked to come with us to the Ministry of Magic, if you don't do as told, we will take you by force."</p><p>Harry growled but took his wand out and let it to the ground; he knew that this all has to be an error… it has to be!</p><p>Once he let the wand down one of the Aurors came and took hold of both his hands, moving to his back, not giving him the time to do anything more.</p><p>"So… Is Harry prepared to what will happen?" the man whispered near Harry's ears, making him shudder.</p><p>What was this Auror problem…?</p><p>Primarily, he doesn't remember letting him call Harry by his name!</p><p>He glared at the man, who didn't seem to be more than 19 with silky brown hair and ice blue eyes, making the later smirk, the others Aurors not seeing their interaction.</p><p>Just like this, he is portkeyed to the Ministry of Magic.</p><hr/><p>Harry fell when the Portkey let them and looking around; he saw he was in a cell, a dark cell.</p><p>He and the Auror from before are the unique there, so he turned to the Auror with a glare.</p><p>"Why was I taken to a cell?" he asked, "I didn't do anything!"</p><p>The Auror raised an eyebrow then smirked, moving toward Harry who was on the floor and bending down in front of him;</p><p>"You,MR Potter …" he trailed off, his hand moving to Harry's chin and making him look up "Are under arrest because of the murder of the Dark Lord and the use and practice of Dark magic."</p><p>Harry rolled his eyes;</p><p>"I never practiced Dark Magic, and for Voldemort, you all forced me!" he yelled the last part, and the hand on Harry's chin used more force.</p><p>"Maybe you didn't… but that's not what your friends say."</p><p>The hand moved to Harry's cheek and started caressing absently;</p><p>"What the hell!?"</p><p>Harry pushed the man away;</p><p>"Don't touch me!"</p><p>The man eyes darkened while looking at Harry and licked his lips but when other voices could be heart their way, he tsked then got up, letting poor Harry confused on the floor.</p><p>The door of the cell opened, and an old Auror entered;</p><p>" Mr Potter, it's time for the trial"</p><hr/><p>Harry stood in the middle of CourtRoom N°4 in the Ministry of magic, magic suppressing coiled tightly from elbow to wrist and knee to ankle.</p><p>The CourtRoom was full and had to be enlarged with charms because of the number of Spectators that came to the trials of Harry James Potter – The boy who lived to become Dark.</p><p>Harry was angry, they don't even have proofs, and they dare to call him like this?</p><p>The worse is nearly nobody believes him, the exception being Neville Longbottom and strangely, Percy Weasley.</p><p>Hermione, the rest of the Weasley's, McGonagall, the professors… they all think he has become Dark, even after all those years they didn't think him innocent, some even saying that he used Dark Spells to finish Voldemort.</p><p>He feels hurt and betrayed…</p><p>They were lying right…?</p><p>They didn't seem to be under a spell or anything…</p><p>He grimaced when he saw Ron and Ginny glaring at him, Hermione nowhere to be seen…</p><p>It's while looking at the people around him that his eyes found those of Neville, who tried to smile at him in an assuring way, telling that all will be okay.</p><p>Harry wasn't so sure about that.</p><p>He wished Remus and Luna were alive, here with him; he was sure they would have thought he was innocent… if at least Sirius has been alive...</p><p>If you're curious about the fact of how they know why they both are dead, it's because of a spell…</p><p>Harry closed his eyes for some seconds, trying to calm himself then took a breath, opening once again his beautiful green eyes.</p><p>He could hear an intake of breath, and when he looked at his right, he saw once again that strange Auror from before, looking at him with those darkened eyes.</p><p>What the hell is his problem…?</p><p>(AN : Yes, Harry is a little dense~ are you too? *winks*)</p><p>He glared at the Auror then turned back to his investigation; he turned to look at the Prosecution, it was a middle-aged man called Aldan that had long brownish hair and a face that makes him think of a pig… no wait, it would be an insult for those poor pigs to be compared to…this.</p><p>By the way, as expected, it was a pureblood.</p><p>Strangely, Harry could look around all that he wanted; he couldn't see a defense for him… they wanted to make him survive this trial without a defense!?</p><p>He growled under his breath, and it indeed wasn't the first time today, though he stopped when he felt a weight on his shoulder, he rolled his eyes, it's not like if he could go and jump in someone's throat!</p><p>"Be a good boy, Mr Potter" the Auror purred near his ears, and once again, Harry wishes he could hit him in the face.</p><p>Some seconds later a man with long white hair and without bear entered the room along with the rest of the members of the Wizengamot.</p><p>It has been decided that the next Minister will be Kingsley Shacklebolt, but he knew that for the moment, there was none and he would be forced to have that old man in front of his deal with his trials…</p><p>Now that he thinks about it, he hasn't seen Kingsley since the battle, did the man think he was guilty too?</p><p>The old man sneered at Harry in disgust, and Harry rolled his eyes.</p><p>A light extremist then.</p><p>He took a breath and tried to calm his… anger, after all, it will not help him.</p><p>He looked around the CourtRoom one last time to see that indeed, the Weasley's and the professors have moved to the Witness section of the CourtRoom, glaring at him.</p><p>Harry really couldn't believe this, he had saved them a lot of times, mainly when they were too lazy to move their lazy ass and take care of the problem, he has loved them and give a lot for them, and that's how they pay him?</p><p>With dark looks of hate?</p><p>If that's what they wanted, then good!</p><p>He will give them back their looks three times more powerful, if looks could kill, Harry would have killed them a long time ago, hell, even one of the professors cowered.</p><p>He smirked then turned back to look at the front, once he gets out of there… if he does, he will never talk to any of them again.</p><p>"Squirt, don't lose your time" the Auror ONCE again murmured near his ears, and this time it wasn't his name or surname but Squirt, who does he think he is!?</p><p>And don't lose your time… what else can he do?</p><p>It's not like this stupid Auror cared about him after all, Harry's sure that the Auror wanted just one thing and it's to get him in Azkaban to see the horrors of the Dementors for the rest of Harry's life.</p><p>He shuddered at the thought of Dementor, and suddenly he felt cold, freezing.</p><p>The white-haired man cleared his throat then started talking;</p><p>"Ladies and Gentlemen for the Wizengamot, we are gathered here for the crime committed by one Harry James Potter for the murder of one man and the practice of Dark Magic."</p><p>Harry groaned, they're really serious?</p><p>He may have used Dark magic but it was just one time on Bellatrix, and nobody saw him… though he does have to accept the fact that a Cruciatus is enough for a lifetime at Azkaban…</p><p>AH!</p><p>He did use Sectumsempra on Malfoy too, oh hell, MALFOY!</p><p>Shit, if this continues like this the trials of the Malfoy's… nobody can help them…</p><p>He had to get out of there…</p><p>"I didn't-"</p><p>He was cut short when the giant door suddenly opened, showing a certain man that should be dead.</p><p>"It seems I'm late…" the man said with a sigh and Harry's eyes widened.</p><p>"Professor Dumbledore…?" he asked in shock.</p><p>Gasps were heard around the room, and those twinkling eyes looked around until they finally rested on Harry's body, eyes dimming, showing disappointment.</p><p>Harry was more and more confused, why the hell was Dumbledore alive and why the hell did he look at Harry with a face full of disappointment!?</p><p>"My boy… I knew this would happen one day but… so young…" he sighed in regret, and the people around started murmuring and agreeing, the shock disappearing.</p><p>"Order!" the man in charged yelled, banging his gavel and making the people around them shut down.</p><p>"Care to explain this, Albus?"</p><p>The man eyes narrowed;</p><p>"Last time I looked, Dead people don't come back from the dead… at least not without the help of a Necromancer."</p><p>For the first time, I think I agree with you… Harry thought, not taking his eyes away from Dumbledore, eyes showing how betrayed he felt, especially when the man said Harry is Dark, Evil.</p><p>"A long time I don't see you, Adam, but I think we should finish this trial before I explain my situation."</p><p>Dumbledore turned to look sadly at Harry, making the last narrow his eyes.</p><p>At what are you playing, Dumbledore?</p><p>Harry wasn't stupid, he may be dense, yes, but not dumb, and the war forced him to grow, when he remembers each conversation with Dumbledore…</p><p>He felt like if he has been manipulated all his life.</p><p>Dumbledore shook his head one time more;</p><p>"I'm sorry my boy, I couldn't stop you from becoming…" he sighed.</p><p>With that said, Dumbledore moved toward the witness section of the CourtRoom, next to Molly, who started crying when she saw Dumbledore.</p><p>Adam coughed;</p><p>"Let's continue then, I call for the Witness n°1, Ronald Weasley."</p><p>Ron got up then started walking toward the front;</p><p>"Do you wish us to use Verisaterum?"</p><p>Harry's eyes opened like soccer, why did they ask him, it usually should be forced!</p><p>Molly got up rapidly;</p><p>"My Ron would never lie!" she screeched, and many people around had to cover their ears because of her banshee voice, Fleur, who was near her, caught Harry's eyes and looked at him with an apology, her eyes seemed to be red.</p><p>Yes, Harry understood, Fleur and the two older brothers… didn't think he did those things, he smiled gratefully at her.</p><p>At least there were people who didn't think he was guilty…</p><p>Wow, his list has grown to what… 5?</p><p>"Well, when I was going to help Harry, I saw him… he used unforgivable while in the battle and at that time when we came to the Ministry of Magic, I saw it… he used the Cruciatus curse in Bellatrix Lestrange!" he yelled the last part, and Harry's mouth opened, someone saw it…?</p><p>B-But there was nobody, just him, Voldemort, and Bellatrix, so how!?</p><p>Once again, the murmurs started, and Harry groaned, if his hands weren't attached, he would hide his face in his hands, what did they want him to do!?</p><p>His Godfather has just been killed and Voldemort he…</p><p>"ORDER!"</p><p>Ron coughed once again;</p><p>"Well, like I was saying, we are suspicious that he killed Remus and Luna because they saw things they shouldn't have…"</p><p>"BULLSHIT!" yelled Harry at Ron "HOW DO YOU DARE!?"</p><p>He could support a lot of things, but how can Ron DARE to say that, Luna was like a little sister and Remus was like his father, next to Sirius!</p><p>"Shut him down, Auror Alex."</p><p>Adam signaled with his hand, and the Auror next to him did as tell, though reluctantly.</p><p>After this, some more came up until finally, it was the turn of another Weasley, this time, Ginny.</p><p>Ginny looked around timidly then started speaking;</p><p>"I-I was raped by Harry…" she murmured looking down in a heartbroken voice, and Harry spluttered.</p><p>WHAT?</p><p>The people around gasped and looked at her with pity.</p><p>"What do you mean, Mrs Weasley ?" the prosecutor asked with a frown.</p><p>"I… in secret I started going out with Harry for a month" she murmured "but some time later I found my drink was soaked in potions…"</p><p>Harry groaned, how can she lie like that… she has been asking Harry to go out with her, but Harry refused, he didn't even give his first kiss, he nearly did it with Cho, but at the end, he didn't, it just felt terrible, like it shouldn't be like that.</p><p>Like he was saying, he didn't kiss so even less 'do it' with Ginny, he was starting to think he may be Asexual… (AN: In your dreams e_e)</p><p>Harry could hear the Auror next to him chuckling, and Harry looked at him strangely, even if he didn't do it, Rape wasn't something that you could laugh at.</p><p>The Prosecutor grimaced;</p><p>"You're saying that through potions, he raped you?" he asked for the third time, making sure.</p><p>Ginny nodded then moved her hand to her stomach;</p><p>"I may even be pregnant."</p><p>And with this, she broke down; Molly came fast to put her on her arms, rocking her and glaring at Harry, who now was utterly lost.</p><p>He wasn't even that good at potions!</p><p>Adam seemed to find the conversation awkward, so he finally called for the last;</p><p>"I call Albus Percival Dumbledore."</p><p>Adam didn't want to call him by all his names, so he decided to stay on the short side of the name.</p><p>Albus sauntered, looking sadly at Ginny until he finally stopped and with a cough, he started;</p><p>"As you all know, 16 years ago, young Harry 'killed' Voldemort" he waited for a second, for the reaction that they all have each time that name is said then continued;</p><p>"Because of the love of Lily, Harry's mother, the latter survived but… Voldemort has been using Dark, really Dark magic, called Horcrux."</p><p>Some people seemed to want to puke when they heard this while other people decided to walk out the room to calm themselves;</p><p>"That night, for a reason or another, a small part of soul got to Harry's forehead, melting with his soul… it's at that moment that all started. Those last year's Harry has been possessed various times by Voldemort and seen in dreams what the Dark Lord did; I think that because of this all, Harry's soul was slowly tainted and darkened."</p><p>Harry could feel his legs going weak; he knew that all of that was a lie, but for the others… it was the perfect excuse.</p><p>It was sometime later that the trial finally comes near to his end, Harry couldn't even defend himself because of the spell on him, from the start, they didn't have the intention of letting him go, and why would they after all?</p><p>For them, Harry was just too powerful, dangerous, they wanted him under their hands, in Azkaban, and when they need him in the future, use him once again.</p><p>"In a show of hands, who in this CourtRoom pronounces guilty of all charges?"</p><p>Adam asked looking around the room, and nearly every hand was raised.</p><p>"Based on this, I sentence Harry James Potter to life in Azkaban, no chance of Parole, thank you."</p><p>And with a bang! Of his gavel, Harry lost his freedom.</p><p>He looked wide-eyed at the Dementors that entered the court, the cold air making him feel goosebumps, he started trembling as the Dementor came near him, he could hear it, the screamings of his mother, the red-head beautiful woman… but this time it was strange, why could he hear another woman's voice…?</p><p>What was happening?</p><p>In seconds he lost conscience, the last thing seeing is the frown on the Auror face.</p><hr/><p>"-up…"</p><p>Harry slowly come to conscience to find himself in a boat, he fully opened them and looked around in shock.</p><p>"It seems you finally woke up…" the Auror smirked, it was the same from before, was a persistent bug!</p><p>"Bug off!" he yelled at the Auror, tears on his eyes.</p><p>The Auror moved his hands to Harry's face and took off the tears;</p><p>"Poor thing… that Weaslette is such a liar, after all, small Harry never got out with her"</p><p>Harry looked up wide-eyed at the man, who looked back at him with his blue eyes;</p><p>"How do you…?" he asked in confusion.</p><p>"Oh, dear Harry… I know all of you, since your first year."</p><p>The Auror licked his lips;</p><p>"I know you nearly kissed Cho Chang in the fourth year but at the end didn't, I know that the Weaslette tried to force you to go out with her, even using potions…"</p><p>He moved his muscled arm around Harry's body pushing him toward his chest, Harry tried to squirm out, but the arm didn't budge, his face fully Red;</p><p>"I know you didn't even give your first kiss, so innocent… I want all of it…" he murmured near Harry's ear and this time he bits on it, making Harry gasp.</p><p>"But from now on, nobody can take you from me; I can do all I want to from now on… I can have you fully <em><strong>mine</strong></em>, sweet little Harry."</p><p>Harry shuddered, this man was dangerous, he didn't want to be at Azkaban, and he certainly didn't want to pass the time with this man!</p><p>"Let me go!" he screamed pushing him away and kicked until he finally hit in the man part of the Auror, making him grunt and let Harry go.</p><p>Harry looked around rapidly, he knew he couldn't run away but…</p><p>He looked down at the water and started thinking quickly, even if he was to die… it was better than Azkaban and all those Dementor right…?</p><p>Without thinking about it two times, he jumped on the water, the man tried to reach him, but it was too late.</p><p>Harry smiled as the cold water wrapped around his form and he sunk at the bottom.</p><p>In the end, he was the winner, not them.</p><p>Harry closed his eyes, his chest was beginning to burn, and his head was spinning from the lack of oxygen. He felt his back hit the mucky bottom; he was happy like this.</p><p>
  <em>No… master</em>
</p><p>Harry frowned, he was delirious.</p><p>
  <em>
    <strong>THINGS WILL NOT END LIKE THIS.</strong>
  </em>
</p><p>With a last thought of confusion for that strange voice, Harry finally closed his eyes entirely.</p>
