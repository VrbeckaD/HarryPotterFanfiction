          <div class="userstuff"><p>Your third year at Hogwarts was winding down. You had opened yet another Cursed Vault and defeated your He Who Must Not Be Named Boggart. To celebrate, you were having butterbeer with all your friends at the Three Broomsticks. You sat down next to Rowan and Bill.</p>
<p>“This has become something of a tradition (Y/N),” Rowan said.</p>
<p>“Trouble always seems to find me,” you shrugged. Bill rolled his eyes and put his arm around you.</p>
<p>“I’d like to raise a toast,” he said. “To my amazing and all too fearless girlfriend (Y/N). She keeps burning through these Vaults like the badass she is. May she find Jacob and continue her work at Hogwarts.”</p>
<p>“To (Y/N)!” All your friends raised their glasses and downed their butterbeer.</p>
<p>You turned to Bill. “Kind of impressive that a Gryffindor Prefect still wants to date a troublemaking Slytherin after all this time.”</p>
<p>“Are you kidding me? I could never get enough of you, (Y/N).” He kissed you, not caring that everyone was there. A perfect ending to another crazy year.</p></div>
