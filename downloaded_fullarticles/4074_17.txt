    <p>Sipping on a glass of clear liquid as she gazed out a window, Astoria Greengrass-Malfoy stood verdantly resplendent in a tailored green suit (with matching paisley scarf and silver jewelry) at the kitchen counter of the luxury town home, a coiffed society wife juxtaposed against the banality of a kitchen sink filled to the brim with breakfast pans and dishes as yet unwashed by the house elf, Timbly. Astoria leaned forward to push open the window as a brown owl hopped on the open windowsill and proferred a foot burdened with a greatly anticipated letter. Astoria plucked the letter from its grasp and shooed it away. The owl hooted and with a flutter of wings flapped away. Astoria set down her drink and shut the window.</p><p>"Scorpius, darling, come downstairs," said Astoria in a barely elevated voice, just loud enough for her son to catch her words, as she turned away from the sink. Her strident steps in kitten heels clattered against the marble foor as she again, louder this time, called for her son. She heard her sound bounding thunderously down the stairs before she caught sight of his blond hair over the bannister. The expected thud of his landing, as he liked to leap down the last three to four stairs, resounding in the foyer was met with Astoria's exasperated sigh as she sauntered into the foyer herself.</p><p>"Scorpius, one day you'll break your legs," Astoria admonished as she extended the letter to her son, who covetously snatched it from her hand. She smoothed the front of her suit, and then stood with one hand on her left hip as her son tore into his Hogwarts letter. The expression on his face – wide-eyed with joy and wonder – brought a smile to Astoria's typically composed face. "Your father and I expect you'll be in Slytherin."</p><p>"Or perhaps I'll be in Gryffindor," he responded with a wicked grin beaming across his slender face.</p><p>Astoria's smile faltered. "I doubt that dear, for your grandfather Lucius would disown you."</p><p>"I could be in Hufflepuff like Grandmother Eleanor."</p><p>"You could, and she would be delighted. But–"</p><p>"Grandfather Lucius would send me a howler."</p><p>"I doubt your grandfather would take such drastic measures. He would be displeased."</p><p>"I'll make sure to be in Hufflepuff to please Grandmother Eleanor."</p><p>"You'll be in Slytherin. I've absolutely no doubt about that, at all. Your tutors suggested you were quite ambitious with your studies. When you get to Hogwarts, I expect for you to continue to be a star pupil."</p><p>"I want to be the best in my year."</p><p>"Exactly the attitude a Slytherin would have!"</p><p>"Or a Ravenclaw! Can we go collect my school supplies today? I'd like to get a head start."</p><p>"Scorpius, it's November. We have a while to go before you need your supplies. Besides, you already have some of your books."</p><p>"I've read Hogwarts: a History cover-to-cover seven times. I've read Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, even though I won't need that until third year! I want the rest of my books today," he said, a commanding ring to the words.</p><p>"Tomorrow, weather permitting," Astoria stated firmly. When her son began to protest, she lifted an eyebrow and reiterated her statement in the icy, resonant tones that usually quelled his arguments. Her coughing fit shattered the authoritative image.</p><p>"Yes, mother," he said softly and turned to go up the stairs, retreating as he did when her illness became apparent.</p><p>Still coughing, Astoria returned to the kitchen and her potion.</p>
