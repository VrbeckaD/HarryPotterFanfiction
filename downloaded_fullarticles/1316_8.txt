    <p>
  <span>Her knees hurt.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>It was an odd thing to notice, under the circumstances.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Those being, of course, that she was immobilized, by choice. On her knees, by choice. Naked except for the stockings and suspenders, which had been a request and not what she would have chosen. She balked until he'd promised a warming charm. The rest, the ball gag and blindfold, and the cuffs at her wrist, were standard attire for her during their games and helped her relax into her role. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The anxiety that accompanied being ever watchful, always speaking, being in control of her entire world, muffled and diminished and nearly disappeared when she </span>
  <em>
    <span>couldn't </span>
  </em>
  <span>see, </span>
  <em>
    <span>couldn't </span>
  </em>
  <span>speak. She found it oddly liberating. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>But this discomfort was new; this ache of rigidly holding herself still. The lightweight tray in her hands balanced perfectly even though her arms were tired, her shoulders pulling as the glass tumbler was placed back down on the delicate surface. She strained her ears, hearing him flip the page of his book, imagining him licking his long finger as was his habit before touching it to the parchment and turning the page. Her mind conjured an image of his platinum locks brushing over his forehead as he bent to read the words, his cruel mouth pursing, pink lips contrasting with his pale skin.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>A shudder went through her, rattling the tumbler for the first time.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>"Wobbly furniture gets replaced." His voice was low, almost like he was saying it to himself, but it sent a jolt of adrenaline through her. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>She was </span>
  <em>
    <span>not</span>
  </em>
  <span> wobbly.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The harsh words were followed by a stroke of his long fingers over her hair, soothing her. She resisted the urge to lean into him, knowing that her role as his end table didn't allow for any movement, even if it indicated she was seeking out his affection.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>His fingers moved over her shoulder before slipping down to toy with her nipple, pulling another whimper from her while she forced herself to stay still. He stroked and tweaked it until it stood at attention before moving to the other breast, giving it the same treatment as the other side until she was panting behind her gag. Her attention was focused on not rattling the tray, but he was making it impossible to ignore his dexterous fingers as they plucked at her as though she was an instrument tuned to his pleasure.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Which she was.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He abruptly took his hand away and Hermione had to consciously keep herself from following, remaining rigidly upright.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>"Such lovely tits."</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>She felt herself flush before he lifted the tumbler, the slight shift in the weight of the tray the only indication he'd picked it up since he moved with total silence. The reason for which became obvious when she felt an icy cold sensation against her nipple. Goosebumps broke out across her chest as he dragged the ice cube down one breast, between her cleavage and then over to the other, dripping cold water that tricked down to her belly, pooling in her navel and trickling into the crease between her thighs and hips.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The gag in her mouth disappeared with a muttered </span>
  <em>
    <span>Evanesco </span>
  </em>
  <span>and before she could react he slipped the ice cube and his cold fingers into her mouth, sliding over her tongue as she adjusted her jaw and tried to work her muscles lose by sucking his fingers. The ball gag always left her stiff.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>"That's a good girl." He slipped his fingers out of her mouth and cupped her cheek. "How are you doing my little end table?"</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione licked her lips. "Good, sir."</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>She heard his soft snicker before he removed her blindfold, the harsh light causing her to squint and blink a few times as she adjusted to the brightness. When she finally opened them, she was greeted with Draco's face, his signature smirk in place and his eyes filled with amusement.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>"I've elected to rearrange my furniture." Draco lifted the tray she'd been holding. "On your hands and knees."</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione complied, her shoulders stiff and arms sore as she leaned down. Draco moved behind her running a finger down her back before placing the tray on her hips. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>"Don't spill my drink, love." He set the tumbler down on the tray and Hermione focused on keeping her spine rigid in an effort to keep the items on her back from slipping. The pressure on her shoulders was a welcome change, but her arms were still shaky, and when she heard Draco kneel behind her, she braced herself in an effort to prepare for whatever he had planned.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>His warm hand slid up her thigh, sliding under the elastic of the suspender keeping her stocking in place. He snapped the band hard, the sting of it against her thigh making her bite her lip as she held herself rigid. Long fingers crept over the globe of her bum before slipping to cup her heat, probing in between her folds to explore her growing wetness. When one of his fingers pressed against her entrance she knew she was in trouble.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>"I know how much you love to squirm, pet." His finger circled her, sliding through her arousal and then up to press against her clit. "But if you move, I'll have to punish you."</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>"Yes, sir." He lifted his glass, taking another drink and she felt the slight wobble of the tray. When Draco set the tumbler back down she flexed the muscles of her core to maintain her balance, knowing his promise of punishment wasn't in jest.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He pressed two fingers into her without warning, causing her to gasp, before his hand twisted, thumb sliding over her clit and pressing down. He began to pump into her, slipping over her wetness, and she concentrated on holding her position. It was becoming increasingly difficult to do so as Draco knew her body so well at this point it took very little time before she was whimpering, the muscles of her arms shaking and her thighs quivering with the effort it took not to back into his hand and actively fuck herself on his talented fingers.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>"You're doing so well, darling. But what if -" he paused, before curling his fingers and pressing into </span>
  <em>
    <span>that</span>
  </em>
  <span> spot. "I did this."</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He hit the same place several times, his thumb pressing steadily into her clit, and Hermione felt a wave of electricity overwhelm her. She bucked, the orgasm coming violently, resulting in her hips jerking back against his hand. With a shockingly loud clatter, the tray and his tumbler of fire whiskey fell to the floor.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>She remained on her hands and knees, panting, his hand still slowly pumping into her as the evidence of her arousal ran down her thighs.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>"Tsk tsk. You spilled my drink."</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>You made me do that on purpose</span>
  </em>
  <span>, she thought. Aloud, however, she said, "Sorry, sir."</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He draped his lean form over her and kissed her cheek before whispering a dark promise in her ear. "You will be, pet."</span>
