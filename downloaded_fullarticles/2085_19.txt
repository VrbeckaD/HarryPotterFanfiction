    <p>Heavy footsteps echoed throughout the winding hallway, frantic yet graceful on the marble tile that was dimly illuminated by the flickering candles along the stone walls. Portraits of family members' hung above the flame, following the billowing cloak swishing at the man's feet. Their eyes filled with disdain and mild curiosity. How dare he make the Dark Lord wait?</p><p>Shoulder length black hair rustled with the wind of his stride; black eyes stoic as he approached the grand dining room; familiar faces blurring together. One face couldn't be ignored. The snake hybrid; Voldemort, chuckled, a mix of gurgled breath and too much air entering his lungs. Blood red eyes stared through the latecomer as he bowed respectfully, sinking to his knees at the wizards feet.<br/>
<br/>
"My Lord." Suave baritone washed over the room.<br/>
<br/>
"Severus. Please. Join us, won't you? We were all so worried. Punctuality is typically your strong suit. I feared you lost your way."<br/>
<br/>
Voldemort's voice sounded as if he's been dead countless years, as his bone-thin fingers glided over Nagini, his faithful snake. Rising, Severus sat between the Malfoy's matriarch, Narcissa, and Bellatrix Lestrange, the Dark Lord's devoted lapdog. She patted his hand in welcome. Feral gaze focused solely on the head of the table. Nagini slithered through the long-wooded mahogany, baring her fangs before stopping in front of Draco, the heir of the now disgraced Malfoy name. The blond met the snakes gaze with fear, lips pursed in discomfort as Narcissa held his wrist under the table as a form of comfort. His father Lucius eyed the snake with apathy before Voldemort spoke.<br/>
<br/>
"Draco, my boy." The blond's gray eyes flickered to the wizard's inhuman face. Something was wrong, he felt it twisting in his guts.<br/>
<br/>
"My Lord." Draco replied confidently, walls going up seamlessly without a hitch.<br/>
<br/>
"You have taken the Dark Mark. Yet you have not proven your loyalty as your father had assured me. Are you regretting it, child?" Voldemort rose with fluidity, sauntering over to the family, appearing by Lucius' side.<br/>
<br/>
"Never, my Lord. I am honored to serve you. We are extremely humbled you chose Malfoy Manor as your residence until your strength is regained."<br/>
<br/>
"Such a gifted response from an exceedingly intelligent wizard. You raised the boy well." Lucius swallowed thickly, refusing to meet the maroon iris above him. "Yet, not well enough that he took the task I intended to give him. I sought him out to kill Albus Dumbledore as I firmly believed he was brilliant enough to do it. He denied me." Mangled nails rounded the back of Draco's chair, putrid breath hitting his ear.<br/>
<br/>
"Why would you ever deny me, Draco Lucius Malfoy, hm?" The blond was twitching under his mother’s hold, spastic movements in his fingers, itching to grip his wand.<br/>
<br/>
"I don't want the golden trio to keep suspecting my status as a pending Death Eater, my Lord. Harry Potter and his friends have been suspecting of me since last year. I want you to rise without incident. I figured my rejection would allow for someone no one suspects to assassinate the headmaster the right way. I meant no disrespect." Draco's response came out sharp, he felt jagged nails pricking the back of his neck. He hissed.<br/>
<br/>
"I do not take kindly to rejection. I am however feeling...generous. You will not perish today, as Severus has agreed to take your place." Gray eyes met the blank stare of the Potions Master in astonishment. <em>Will he really kill Dumbledore?</em><br/>
<br/>
"Though, my new task doesn't involve killing, you most certainly will wish it did. I apologize to you all, pureblood's. Especially Narcissa and Lucius." The couple glanced at each other cautiously as the buzz of hushed voices made Draco nauseous.<br/>
<br/>
"Harry Potter's mublood, the girl. What is her name, Draco?" Draco's stomach lurched.<br/>
<br/>
<em>Oh no.</em><br/>
<br/>
"Hermione Granger, my Lord." Voldemort smiled; jagged teeth exposed. "Ah, yes. Miss Granger. The extremely well educated mudblood, surpassing you in almost every way. How does that feel?" Malice laced his tone.<br/>
<br/>
"Terrible." Draco affirmed; his spastic twitching relentless as his blood ran cold.<br/>
<br/>
"I'm sure it does. Pureblood's are everything her people wish to be. Your task. My dear Draco." Voldemort crooned. "You have until next summer to make her fall in love with you. So deeply in love that you are able to bed her."</p><p> Bellatrix' shriek of disgust echoed through the now silent room, eyes ablaze in disbelief. Draco's head was spinning. Had he heard right? This goes against everything the Dark Lord stands for. He couldn't be serious. Narcissa and Lucius looked pained, and the fellow Death Eaters looked beside themselves.</p><p><em>Bed Granger?</em> Draco dizzily stood up, his body-weight crumbling into Voldemort's hands. Nagini looked ready to strike, stopping when the blond wretched the contents of his stomach up onto the floor. Voldemort hoisted him up, throwing him against the table. His head hitting with a sickening crack, as blood gushed from his nose.<br/>
<br/>
"Fuck the mudblood, Draco. Seduce her. Make her fall so <em>deeply</em> in love with you she practically begs you to take her like the wanton whore she’s destined to become. Consider her a concubine of sorts." Voldemort was giddy with excitement as he watched Draco look on in pure devastation, wiping his mouth with the sleeve of his dress shirt. Narcissa placing a handkerchief to her son's face.<br/>
<br/>
"My lord, Draco shouldn't be subjected to those scum! It's against our teachings, and beneath us as Pureblood's. You can't make him do this!" Lucius interjected angrily.<br/>
<br/>
"If he doesn't, he'll die. Don't think because I reside with you, any of you are spared." His eyes locked on a random woman at the end of the table, she looked sickened, green with discomfort of the punishment. Mudblood and a Pureblood? Absolutely diabolical. The fire in her eyes gave away the desire she had to speak out of turn against him.</p><p>"Avada kadavra." the killing curse shot out of Voldemort's wand before she could open her mouth to voice her objection. Her head smashed against the table with so much force, it rattled.<br/>
<br/>
Draco bleakly stared at the Death Eater’s body, bile rushing up his throat once more.<br/>
<br/>
"Nagini, dinner!" Voldemort cooed, patting her head as she stalked her prey slinking down the table with grace.<br/>
<br/>
Severus eyed the blond teen coldly, before watching him rise from his seat, dismissing himself, kissing his mother stiffly on her cheek while refusing to look at her tear-stained face. He barely glanced in his professor's direction before retiring to his bedroom. Voldemort caught his gaze instead.<br/>
<br/>
"I trust in you to ensure he does not fail. This is a lesson that insolent boy deserves. I am not to be denied. Though I did not tell Draco this." Severus nodded mutely.<br/>
<br/>
"No potions will be allowed to aid him." Severus grimaced. This was setting Draco up for definite slaughter. He was going to fail. He was going to die…<br/>
<br/>
"Yes, my Lord." the Potion Master succumbed, seeing Draco’s crumbling face every time he closed his eyes.</p>
