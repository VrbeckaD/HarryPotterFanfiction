    <p>Harry trembles when he lifts his head from the Pensieve. He can’t believe the memories he’d just witnessed. Snape had been in love with his mother. And friends with her for a long time. It’s crazy to think that the teacher that had always given him the most grieve in school had once been close to his own mother. Had even tried to save her, protect her in his own deluded way. Harry can’t really believe it. It all seems so irrelevant. In comparison what the other memories showed him. What it is he needs to do now to stop this war.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Slowly he turns back to the door and leaves the headmasters office. The stairs take him down the tower and when he stands in the corridor he pulls out his cloak and disappears from sight. He can’t stand the idea of talking to anyone now. He won’t be able to say what he’s about to do. Everyone will try to stop him. But Harry has no choice. Not when his next action is the only thing that will save this world from a madman who thinks he’s better than everyone else.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>One step at a time he walks down the stairs, one floor after another. Would his parents be waiting for him when he reaches the end of his journey? Will he finally be able to get to know them in person? What will Sirius say when he finds out that Harry had been destined to die all this time. That there was no way around it, no magic escape. Harry hasn’t had a future since the day Voldemort came after him and cursed him with a part of his soul.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry shudders. How could he have lived with a part of Voldemort soul in his body for so long without noticing? How come Harry hasn’t gone mental? After all this time, all the fights and sacrifices of others. Harry closes his eyes and remembers the moment Sirius fell behind the fail, the sight of Lupin and Tonks, death on the floor of the Great Hall, close to the dead body of Fred. He remembers the others, his classmates, people he taught how to defend themselves during their fifth year. It hadn’t been enough. It would never be enough. Even now, when he’s about to make the same sacrifice, it won’t bring them back, it won’t make everything magically perfect.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry gives himself one more glance into the great hall. Watches how Hermione holds a crying Ron in her arms. Looks at her while her eyes search the hall. He can see the pain in her features while she takes in the dead. Harry looks to the side, sees Draco Malfoy sit to the side. His head in his hands, his blond hair falling around it. He looks lost, out of place in the hall with grieving people. For a moment Harry considers walking up to him and dragging him out of the castle with him. Let him see what he did, what the costs of his stupid principles are. But Hermione would realise that Harry will be the invisible force dragging Malfoy away and she would stop him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Maybe one day Hermione and Ron will understand why he can’t say goodbye. Harry won’t be able to do what he needs to if he tries to say goodbye to them. And it’s for them that he’s going. So they can discover the love between each other. Grow old together and have lots of children. Harry wishes he could be around to see it all happen. Wishes he could maybe find a love like theirs for himself and start a family. His eyes slide back to Malfoy. It’s unfair that they will never get a chance. Why couldn’t Malfoy had been just a little nicer, why couldn’t he have figured out sooner that his father's ideas were insane and wrong. Why would the one kiss they shared next to a burning room of requirements be the only one they ever shared? Why can’t they have a future together?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A tear falls from Harry’s eye. He swallows away the lump in his throat and turns quickly. He needs to get out of the castle. Away from the people that he doesn’t want to leave behind. Away from his future. Because he doesn’t have one anymore. Not now that he will have to die to save everyone else.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry treads into the forest and takes off his cloak. Nobody will follow him now, or spot him from the castle. He remembers the first time he had to go into it for detention with Hermione, Neville and Malfoy. It had been kind of nice to walk the path with Malfoy next to him back then. Even though Harry had hated the boy back then. Harry doesn’t know when the hate had turned into something else. If it was when he had seen Malfoy struggle through sixth year, or if it was even before then. All he knows is that they keep circling towards each other, unable to stay away.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The stone in his pocket is a heavyweight. Will it truly work? Will he be able to see his parents before he has to go to his own end? Harry stops his treads and takes the stone in his hand. He turns it around and waits. His parents show up, just like Sirius and Lupin. They tell him to be brave, to be strong. Harry can’t do this. He’s not ready to die. Not now that he knows that Malfoy feels the same, wants him just as bad as he wants him. He can’t hurt Hermione and Ron like this, he can’t make Molly lose another son. She already has to go on without Fred, how can Harry make the pain even worse by leaving her too?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He falls onto his knees and vomits. A hand rests down on his back. It’s solid and warm. Not his parents shivers he’d just seen.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Potter, have you gone insane?” a familiar voice says. “I didn’t save your life at the manor for you to throw it away now.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry shakes his head. He can’t say goodbye to him if he’s here. He needs Malfoy to leave. He can’t have him stop him. Tears fall freely from Harry’s eyes. His body shakes. Malfoy pulls him close against him, holds him while Harry cries. He stays silent like he knows that Harry isn’t going into the forest because he wants to, but because he has to.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Why do you need to go?” Malfoy asks when Harry’s tears start to die down.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“It’s the only way,” Harry answers. “He made Horcruxes.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco tightens the grip of his arms that hold Harry. “And you’re one of them,” he whispers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry nods his head. “I’m sorry.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Silence falls again. They sit in the forest and find comfort in the short moments they have together.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You have to go back,” Harry says when he knows he needs to get going again. He won’t let anyone else die for him, won’t let Voldemort hurt anyone else.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I’m not leaving you,” Malfoy answers. “I won’t let you die alone in their camp. Don’t ask me to walk away, please Harry.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry turns his head and kisses Draco. He doesn’t want to be alone. “Take my cloak, keep out of sight. Don’t you dare die tonight, I need you to live a good life for the both of us.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I will,” Draco tells Harry.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“And tell the others I’m sorry.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco nods and takes Harry’s cloak. He disappears from view. Harry starts to walk again. He can hear Draco’s tread next to him. All the way into the camp they walk together.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When the end is near and Voldemort raises his wand Harry just needs to say one thing. He says them out loud for the first and last time, but he can’t die without Draco knowing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I love you are the last words that pass his lips until the bright green light hits his chest. </p>
