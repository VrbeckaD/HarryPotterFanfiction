</center><p>“My congratulations, Riga’nok,”  Healer Mensetcorpor offered as Harry regained consciousness, his tone less ironic than Harry would have normally expected.  </p><p>As Healer Mensetcorpor continued to scan him without further comment, Harry realized that the healer might have actually meant the comment and hurried to express his gratitude only to be chastised to remain still as the healer continued casting. </p><p> “My initial fee estimation is seventy-two galleons, forty-five sickles. If there are any additional potions or treatments required this off course will be adjusted. Do you accept?”</p><p> Wincing at the fee, Harry nevertheless accepted it and signed off for treatment in the extended invoice. One of the earliest lessons that Manager Griphook had brought home to Harry when he first came into Gringotts’ care was that if he would not invest in himself neither would Gringotts, and as such the most-critical ‘core investment’ which must be made without question was to insure one’s health - as both productivity and profitability were in-arguably impaired by injury and illness. After making a small notation in his invoice journal, the healer handed it to Harry for his signature, explaining with a scowl:</p><p> "The haz’bek’i auditor’s challenge has resulted in two broken and one cracked rib, dislocated and cracked bones in your hand, and two severe cracks in bones of your upper left leg… all of which will require skelegrow as well as a bindbone potion to ensure their full integrity when you return to defense training.  Aloe seed balm can, of course, treat the severe bruises and lacerations across your pectorals more quickly, but my recommendation is the use of foal's breath potion instead. The healing process is lengthened by two days, but using the foal’s breath potion will not have the contra-indications should you wish to use the pain-kill potion."</p><p>"I would, Healer Mensetcorpor, thank you." Harry answered, somewhat stunned that the healer had referred to an auditor of such high rank as haz’bek’i (<i>dishonourable</i>) in his presence. While Defense Master Thornbrow had informed Harry that by virtue of entering galleonclaw training, his rank was nearly equal to all of the auditors but the high auditor himself, his youth and background would have been sufficient reasons for the healer to be more restrained in his comments.</p><p> After the first round of potions, when the child settled back into the healing bench, feeling the slightest bit mischievous, Healer Mensetcorpor offered, “I should, perhaps, warn you, Riga’nok, that Healer CurseSeal has been and gone to prepare an updated nutritional regimen to maximize the yttrium in your system, currently sheathing your damaged bones and bruised organs, to further speed healing before it is naturally retracted to its central resting points.” </p><p>Healer Mensetcorpor’s warning was thoroughly drenched in knowing amusement as he watched with visible enjoyment the microsecond grimace that crossed Harry’s face at another stricture to be relayed from the galleonclaw’s primary healer. As much as he might appreciate the healer’s diligence, Healer Curseseal had that peculiarly-particular trait that he had noticed in most of the female goblins that Harry had dealt with in the past: a vicious imagination.</p><p> Where Defense Master Thornbrow penalized insufficient progress with additional training time and Manager Griphook employed standard fines to correct his charges’ failings, Healer Curseseal’s course-corrections were unpredictable - varying from instructing Hibby and the wards' assigned elves to bring Harry twenty-four small meals spaced every thirty minutes over a twelve hour period for three whole days after a previous check-up had informed her that Harry had not been as diligent as he should have been in following the assigned nutritional regimen - to spelling Harry asleep wherever in the bank that she found him if he worked over the set schedule that she had deemed appropriate for a human-child-of-his-age and levitating him back to the wards' suite - to  informing his retention managers that she would be medlocking the drawers containing reports and questionnaires regarding his charges if she continued to find him working past her assigned break times without her permission. </p>

</center><p>"You have a question?" Healer Mensetcorpor questioned, reading the small burst of curiosity that crossed his face when he'd used the child's title again. </p><p>"The way you pronounced my Rig'anok, just then."</p><p>"Ah, yes. I see. Your manager would not have had a reason before this to assume that he would have need to explain the title conjugations and alterations that most striplings through the process of attending successive annual and Grand reviews. Even with your title, your first expected Grand Review would not normally have been until you reached at least your quarter life, which for Wizards, I believe, is 40 years, based on the average ages of surviving wizards after the most recent civil war.  You must realize, of course, that there have not been many of our wards who have elected to continue their association with Gringotts, for so long."</p><p>"It is likely that your manager considered the expense of time to share this detail was not warranted in measure to the many other topics of conversation that will have had more impending returns. As I have no other pending tasks to attend to and the reviews have been released for evening feasts, if you are not due to any tasks, I might explain." He offered the child, amused with the Riga'nok's quick acceptance. </p><p>"Very well;" he continued, "However, before I begin, I should note that Manager Griphook, Coronae Magister Magia, Defense Master GalleonClaw Thornbrow, and Mistress-Healer Galleonclaw Curseseal are meeting with a dignitary and will be stopping in when they have finished the meeting."</p><p>"Thank you, Healer Mensetcorpor." The young Riga'nok answered, accepting the invoice to initial for the added discussion time. </p><p> "Very well.  Your observation of the change in inflections does your manager credit, Riga'nok. Few humans learn our language well enough to pick up the nuances of such declension and case changes.  To date, I would imagine that you have only studied the grammatical cases that reflect static spellings. As striplings move into their respective fields, depending on the ranks they reach, they will be introduced to terms with increasing declensions. This is particularly true for craft titles.  The spelling of nineteen-some titles change punctuation and emphasis through promotion and accomplishment of Grand Reviews with the corresponding rise in ranks. The first twelve titles like Ragn'rok reflect the leaders of the Nation's twelve clans. Six of the titles reflect the Magisters of the five guilds, and the last is the title you hold. "</p><p>"Each title, you should note, begins with a presumptive case that has no associated punctuation and is used primarily for reporting purposes - where a potential candidate may be considered for a given investment path, but has not yet been approved for the path. For example, before your first review by the Coronae Magister Magia, when your accounts were being put forward for consideration, your presumptive title would have been..." Clearing a temp-tablet, Healer Mensetcorpor paused to write the title, Riganok, without fangs (or apostrophes, as the humans called the hanging punctuation marks) or missing vowels, and turned the tablet to the boy. </p><p>"In essence, you were an untested candidate. On your first annual review following the assignment of the presumptive title, by passing the annual review, you earned your first declension, noted by the addition of a fang at the end of the first syllable before the second toothless sound..." the healer paused, thinking over humans' predilection for choosing such odd titles that had no relation to the words use - like vowels for their toothless sounds.  ~~~The sounds have nothing to do with vows, of any sort~~~ ... at least not as far as he'd ever discovered. Setting the curious trait aside, though, the healer paused to give the child a moment to contemplate how his title had already risen by two declensions. </p><p>When he was certain that he had the child's attention again, Healer Mensetcorpor continued, "In the normal course of matters - if your first formal appearance before Grand Review auditors had not been forced forward by challenge - and you had continued your associations with Gringotts, you would have been called to stand at the first Grand Review following your Quarter-life celebration."  Pausing to write the child's title twice more on the tablet, with the fang shifts - from Rig'anok to Riga'nok, he continued: "On passing your first Grand Review, the emphasis and pronunciation shifts, as you noticed, from the end of the first syllable before the second toothless sound to after the second toothless sound. The Quarter Life grand review is the only formal annual review dictated solely by age.  The titles of clan leaders follow a similar progression; although, presumptive clan titles are not generally awarded until the potential candidates pass their Quarter-Life Grand Reviews, outside of extraordinary acts of valor in battle that are recognized by majority vote of the Nations Guild of Commanders. For both Clan and Royal titles, after achieving their first declension of titles, any candidate may be called to stand at any formal annual review or Grand Review cycle by consensus of the Nation's high auditors, and automatically at the Grand Review immediately following a great conflict, the death of a higher ranked potential clan leader (or crown candidate if there were one), but absolutely no later than the first Grand Review following their Half-Life celebration.”</p><p> “As candidates for these positions pass through each level of review -successfully- the fanged punctuation of their title moves through their positions around the toothless sounds of that title. So that the declension of your current title beginning with the unemphasized Riganok to Rig'anok, Riga'nok, Rigan'ok, and Rigano'k with the emphasis changing to the bitten sound (consonants ~~~ human's naming conventions were just odd ~~~) closest to the fang in each change.  Reaching the fang's last station, usually equates to the successful passage of a candidates' fourth Grand Review and the rank of a Vice President of any clan. Any review there after will use that declension unless and until you are acknowledged as the primary presumptive crown, which begins a secondary pattern of conjugation denoted by the dropping of the first then second toothless sounds in the title. There are ranks of course between these levels, but no others that affect the declension of your titles, until the lst and final rank of your title is attained or denied. "</p><p>Watching the child mull through the rather in-depth explanation of titles, with amusement, Healer Mensetcorpor cast a second scan over the young Riga'nok to verify the progress of the initial skelegrow potions he'd given the child, frowning slightly as the yttrium blocked his scans. Healer Curseseal had indicated that it might happened so long as magic deemed the child's system to be of additional support, but it did not make the task of diagnosing his injuries easier.  From what he could verify, however, it appeared the child's ribs were healing properly and quickly, so he moved on to casting other spells over the frame to double check that no illnesses or weaknesses appeared to be developing either from the excess of training the child was being put through - admittedly necessary ~~~ but that didn't mean that Healer Mensetcorpor necessarily approved ~~~ or the continued separation from the entity ... soulshard... that the Riga'nok had adopted.  </p><p>He still had to shake his head at that one. Manager Griphook had certainly filled his coinsack on that wager, all because the child had proven more goblin than anyone had expected him to be. Thankfully, Mensetcorpor had elected not to take his brother and Griphook's wager on whether the child would take the affinity test, much less pass the gloves appraisal as he had. While not believing that the child had any possibility of passing, he had already lost a significant wager to the manager far too close to the closing of the review cycle and was not willing to lose another on top of it, which he clearly would have. </p>

</center><p>Harry had just finished drawing his yttrium mail and gloves back inside himself -once Healer Curseseal was satisfied that he had been healed enough to no longer need the ore's additional support - and was re-dressing when an unfamiliar gravely-voice drew his attention, "Oh, excellent. I see I'm not too late."</p><p>"Master…" Healer Mensetcorpor began but cut off immediately with a barely noticeable grimace as he slid out of his chair to kneel, with Harry following barely a moment behind him, bowing lowly in silent obeisance as he assumed was appropriate to any dignitary whom a master healer would feel the need to kneel to.</p><p>"Oh, don't mind him," the dignitary answered, directing his comment to Harry as he explained, "Healers and I have a conflicting relationship, almost on the edge of what you might call a love/hate relationship.  … Tell me, Child, I am known by many names, and many of those whom I have touched know me by a particular name, even when they are not particularly aware of their knowledge until asked; by what name would you know me?"</p><p>Not entirely certain what the appropriate response was, Harry held his position waiting for a cue from the healer in lieu of his absent managers, but risked the slight impropriety of glancing up - in order to avoid the greater offense of not answering a question put too him by a notable guest of the bank. </p><p>The Master, at least Harry assumed from the Master Healer's aborted greeting, appeared human, elderly, with a skeletally-thin, almost-emaciated build; pale and desiccated-looking skin; thin, almost-to-the-point-of-balding, but still gleaming black hair that arched in high widow-peaks before hanging almost to his shoulders in a manner very reminiscent of the mid-1960's; pin-point, sharp deep-set eyes; and the very unexpected attire outdated attire of a muggle business suit with widely-set pinstripes against an unfamiliar fabric. The most amazing aspect of his appearance, to Harry at least, was that while he did not visually recognize the man --in any way -- and was certain that he had not seen the man either at Gringotts or earlier at the Dursleys -- he did know him ... and his name:</p><p>"Master Shibou-Yuki.  The name I know you by is Master Shibou-Yuki."</p><p>"Interesting..." The dignitary murmured, and Harry could feel the elder's eyes sharpening as they studied him while he lowered his head back to the appropriate bow.  </p><p>"Oh, do get up. A bit of reasonable humility - appropriate to the circumstances is all I expect, more gets tiresome… quickly. "</p><p>Even as Healer Mensetcorpor was gesturing for him to do so, Harry was rising - not wanting to show disrespect by his refusal. </p><p>"Much better, Healer, I do believe you have finished with Harry?"</p><p>"Yes, Master… Shibou-Yuki," Harry wasn't entirely surprised by the healer's pause as the name that Harry had addressed the dignitary by sounded unfamiliar on the Healer's tongue, but Master Shibou-Yuki had mentioned that he was known by many names, so it was only to be expected that the healer might use a different name before he. "We've finished."</p><p>"Very good. Then we'll leave you to it. Harry, walk with me."</p><p>"Yes, Master Shibou-Yuki," Harry finished buttoning his outer robe as he moved to join the dignitary. </p><p>"Oh, let's do dispense with the use of Master between you and I, shall we?" Master Shibou-Yuki chastised lightly, gesturing for Harry to lead the way.</p><p>"Of course, Sir. Do you have a preferred title?"</p><p>"Shibou-Yuki is fine."</p><p>"Of course, Sir. Is there anywhere you would like to visit?" Harry asked uncertainty. While he had joined his managers on walks before, it had always been previously on their direction and coinciding with rounds and duties they were seeing-to as they spoke with him. </p><p>"Your managers and I have finished our conversation, giving me, much to think about. Before I return to my duties, however, I wish to make my own appraisal. Take me somewhere we can speak with a modicum of privacy. "</p><p>"May I offer you repast and refreshments in the wards' suite, Sir? Any wards in residence should be at their duties." </p><p>"That would be fine; it has been nearly a month since I've enjoyed goblin hospitality." Shibou-Yuki answered, sounding mildly-amused as he gestured Harry ahead of himself. </p>
