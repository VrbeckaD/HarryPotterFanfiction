  <em>Eo animo quidque debetur quo datur, nec quantum sit sed a quali profectum voluntate perpenditur.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>(The spirit in which a thing is given determines that in which the debt is acknowledged; <em>or</em> it's the intention, not the face-value of the gift, that's weighed.)</em>
</p><p>-Lucius Annaeus Seneca (Seneca the Younger)</p><p> </p><p>He raises his arm to swipe with the back of his hand, again, at the greasy strand of hair that insists on falling into his eyes.  The scents of brewing and his unbathed body waft up from his robes.  He needs a shower in the worst way -- it’s been the better part of a week -- but there just hasn’t been <em>time</em>.  Classes had let out Wednesday noon, and he’d been huddled over this cauldron ever since.  It’s been almost a year and a half getting it to this stage, and be damned if mere hygiene is going to interfere with its completion.</p><p>A real alchemist would have teams of brewers to coddle along a complex potion like this.  They’d work in shifts, go home to a good dinner and a long soak for sore back muscles, instead of subsisting on stale coffee, lukewarm tea, and the occasional cigarette when he can spare a moment to stand and stretch.  He doesn’t smoke often.  The smell bothers him, and he very literally cannot afford to make a habit of it, but Avery had tossed him the tail end of a pack, mute thanks for not dobbing him in to McGonagall over the Transfig cheat sheet that had been circling the seventh-year dorm.  If his clothing has a whiff of tobacco about it once in a while, Avery is assured that his offering has been accepted, and that Snape will keep his quiet.  And the nicotine helps to subdue the tremors in his hands; too much caffeine with too little sleep has made his fingers prone to disobey orders. </p><p>He’d hit on the combination of caffeine and nicotine months ago.  Usually, he applies a bit of <em>Nicotiana</em> oil to his gumline.  The taste is gawdawful, but mucosal membrane uptake is eminently more effective than inhaling it alongside tar and particulates.  But he’d run out of it last weekend, and there hasn’t been time to raid the greenhouses again, let alone set up a distillation.  He stubs out his last fag, and dumps another dram of wit-sharpening potion into the remainder of his tea.  It disrupts the oily sheen on the surface; he swirls it, and the colours kaleidoscope.  He squeezes his eyes closed to dispel the image, and feels his center of balance tipping forward. </p><p>No.  He can sleep later, when things are alright again.  He needs to set up his filtration apparatus now, because the miniscule volume of liquid in his cauldron is finally beginning to take on a golden hue. </p><p>He lowers the gas, carefully, and has a moment of blind panic when he can’t find the filter paper.  Damn it, he’d left it—have the house elves been in?  No, he’s been here for days, he must have moved it.  There!  Beneath his lab manual (which needs updating; he’d left off the notes somewhere early this morning, once he’d set up the oxygen-excluding dome over the mouth of the cauldron). </p><p>But alright, disaster averted.  He carefully places two round circles of acid-free paper into the base of his Büchnel filter, and checks that the stasis charm on the ice bath is still holding.  The timer dings; he cancels the charm, pulls on his dragonhide gloves, and settles the cauldron into the tray of ice.  Steam billows up.  “<em>Infrigida</em>,” he mutters, tapping the ice bath with his wand.  The meltwater begins to reassemble into spiky crystals around the still-steaming cauldron.  Surely this is taking too long?  He checks the timer.  No, it’s only been twenty seconds.  Forty in which to breathe, and get control of the jittery flutter in his stomach.  Plenty of time.</p><p>There isn’t, though.  The conjunctivus curse Black had nailed him with two weeks ago had slowed up operations considerably.  He’d lost two days, or – as he calculates it – three meals and at least one night of blessed sleep.  He rubs at his eyes, in what he firmly tells himself is memory of the painful, itchy scratching of the curse, and not exhaustion.  His face feels numb.  He scrapes his teeth over his lower lip, but even that pain doesn’t really improve his grasp on consciousness.</p><p>The timer dings again, and he heaves himself up from the desktop he’s sitting on. </p><p>The small cauldron seems so heavy.  He watches, almost detached, as tendons in his arms jerk and spasm as he slowly drains the cauldron’s contents across the filter paper.  Heavy clumps of leaden crystals accrete along the pan of the filter, as the glowing golden liquid trickles down, drop by precious drop, into the tiny flask clamped beneath it.  It’s been nearly eighteen months, and what he has to show for everything is only a couple mouthfuls worth of this potion.</p><p>Two swallows, maybe three.  It doesn’t look like much, compared to having to grovel and beg second-hand school-things off Cissy Black -- Malfoy, now -- given he’d squandered his miniscule budget on ingredients for this potion, two school years running.  It doesn’t look like much, compared to the sleepless nights he’d spent in this chilly, dusty classroom.  It doesn’t look like much, compared to the things he’d had to do as favours for his housemates, to ensure their continued disinterest, and their silence should Sluggy begin wondering where some of the dungeon’s paraphernalia have disappeared to.  It doesn’t look like much, compared to what it’s intended to atone for.</p><p>It’s an apology, wrapped in months of penance.  It’s an offering, enclosed within an admission of the reality that has fallen between them.  It’s a gift, but he doesn’t want or expect anything in the way of reciprocation.  It’s his wishes and hopes, for her, for them.  Because he thinks the nights might press a little softer, if he can think of her happy, and know that there is no undertone of ill-will towards himself.  So alright, he does want something in return: he wants to know that she does not truly despise him.  He doesn’t go so far as to hope for anything more than neutrality, but even a lack of loathing would be something precious.  So it’s a plea for forgiveness, inside of which is concealed his fragile optimism, which he holds like a shield against the loneliness and despair that daily dogs his heels.</p><p>It’s <em>Felix Felicis</em>.</p><p>He stoppers the flask and tucks it into a nest of crinkled gold paper, in a plain cardboard box.  He settles the lid in place, palms his wand again, and concentrates hard.  The same spell that had accomplished the paper sends a burst of scarlet washing over the box.  He sags, tired but pleased, into the chair behind the desk.  It’s a proper, cheerful, Christmassy sort of red.  It’s just right.  She has a cloak in exactly the same shade, just a touch darker than the Gryffindor crimson of her scarf. </p><p>He checks that his hands are clean, before he attempts the ribbon.  He’d had to ask the house elves to supply it; he’s pants at transfiguring cloth, and a silk ribbon is no exception.  He should take the time to learn, now that he’s done with this project.  It’s lucky he hasn’t gained any more height – without Cissy to lengthen his robes, he’d have been a sorry sight, this past year.  They’re getting worn, though, and he’d singed his right sleeve back in October.  His mind hadn’t been on what he was doing, that day in Potions.  Slughorn had looked as if he might’ve been about to say something scathing, but Potter and his crew had beat him to it.</p><p>He shakes the memory away, and carefully tucks the ends of the ribbon beneath the golden bow he’s constructed atop the box.  It’s perfect.  He’s become quite good at them; Cissy always insisted upon hand-wrapping her gifts, but she wasn’t particular about whose hands did it.  And he’d always owed her favours.  Although he did sometimes think that she probably wracked her brains, to come up with enough menial and vaguely humiliating ways for him to compensate her casual charities.  Her last year, she’d often defaulted to waving him off with the promise that he’d owe her, later.</p><p>He supposes she probably kept a running tally.  He certainly did.  It is fairly alarming how little of his debt he’s paid; he wonders if any of it transferred to Lucius, once they’d wed.  He is a bit frightened of Lucius Malfoy.  Early impressions cut deep, and scarred.  He does not want to owe Lucius Malfoy favours; he’d run his arse off, licked Malfoy’s boots his entire first year, because he’d been very sure that it was a bad idea to be in that particular wizard’s debt.   And if Malfoy’s amusement with him had saved him a beating or two at the other boys’ hands, well… He wasn’t about to complain.  It was enough strain to be on guard against Potty and his gang; he didn’t need enemies in his own trenches.</p><p>But it seems he has them, regardless.</p><p>It’s when he’s stashing the wrapped gift in his trunk that he realizes someone has made off with his bath caddy again.  It’s a pathetic, juvenile prank, barely worth his attention compared to the things Potter and Black scheme up.  But it’s another hassle that he doesn’t need, more malevolent accompaniment to the bleak threnody of his existence within these cold stone walls.  He grabs some pants and his other set of robes, thankfully clean, and drags his tired carcass out to the common room.</p><p>It’s that miserable shit Macnair again, no doubt.  He’d become a problem since he’d hit a growth spurt in fourth year, and it’s beyond the pale that as a sixth he’s taken to attacking seventh-year students – even if the seventh-year in question <em>is</em> one Severus Snape.  Something needs to be done about Macnair; he wonders who might owe him favours.  Since he started on the <em>Felix</em>, he’s not been that good about keeping his housemates in his debt.  “Snapey’s slipping” he’d heard Avery say, early last month.  It’s a problem he’ll need to be more diligent in rectifying, but for the moment, he only wants his toiletries back.  He’s expecting Cissy, at least, to gift him another book for Christmas, but he doesn’t want to have to resell it to buy <em>soap</em>, of all things.  And besides, that’s a week off, and he needs a shower <em>today</em>.  Right now, or he’ll miss his chance.</p><p>“Right, whichever of you stole my bath things – turn them over, or I swear I’ll make you regret it.”  It’s a gauche threat, overblown and aimless, and he realises the risk in it, even as the words leave his lips.  He should have led by accusing Macnair directly, if he was going to make a scene.  This way, it will seem to them that he doesn’t know where the blame should be apportioned.  Dangerous, that.  It sets him up as an outsider again.  And Cissy’d worked so hard to help him shore up the position he does have.  Or had.  Hell, he’s barely even been in the common room, this past term.  Who knows what vitriol and poison have been circulating?  He glares at the indolent oafs lounging in front of the fireplace.  “Macnair, I know you’ve done it.”</p><p>“Do you now?  Tell you what, you suck my cock, I’ll give your rubber ducky back, hey?”  He and his cronies snigger as if this is the height of cleverness.</p><p>He is fingering his wand, and wondering how much bloodshed would get him detention with Slughorn, when Avery notices. </p><p>“Oy, Snape.  Fuck off, it’s too early in the morning for a firefight.”</p><p>He clenches his teeth, and scowls bitterly in Avery’s direction.  Betrayal.  Well, one betrayal should beget another, that’s the natural order of things.  But Avery’s fast with his wand, and he acknowledges that it’s only cantankerous threads of sheer willpower that are keeping him upright at this point.  Another time.</p><p>He turns to the door.</p><p>“That’s right, you poncey little slimeball, you bloody well obey when your man lays down the law!  And bring me a sarny on your way back, daaaarling.” Macnair’s in fine form today.  “Sure you don’t want to suck me off, sweetheart, you’ve got nice girly lips for it!”</p><p>He wonders, not for the first time, what their obsession is with genitalia.  It’s crude; maybe that’s the point. </p><p>He does the best he can in the showers.  At least there’s bar soap, gritty brown stuff that smells a bit like Toby’s Brylcreem had.  His hair feels sticky, even after he’s washed the suds out.  Maybe it’ll dry alright.  Optimism, again.  No toothbrush, but he scrubs at his teeth with the tail of a towel, gargles with tap water, and hopes against hope that he has a mint stashed somewhere in his trunk.  Avery knows a breath-freshening spell, but he’s not about to ask him.  Nothing’s free in Slytherin House, and he hasn’t any desire to engage in the sort of compensation Avery would ask of him.  Despite what Macnair and his lot think.</p><p>He cradles the wrapped gift in his arm, and disillusions himself to pass through the common room again.  They’ll know someone’s there, but it’s basic decency not to pry when someone doesn’t want to reveal themselves.  Nott’s still shagging that Hufflepuff, as far as he knows, but no one’s ever caught her leaving yet, as a matter of courtesy.  He scans the assembled Slytherins on his way past.  Regulus Black is still there, who always goes home regardless, so he knows he hasn’t missed the carriages yet.  Macnair’s braying laugh rings out.  Fuckwit.  He’ll have to bend his mind to that problem rather sooner than later, because he doesn’t know how much longer he can hold up under increasing aggression. </p><p>He’s so tired.</p><p>But if he can make things right again, if he can only know, deep in his bones, that there is one person alive for whom he is not an object of disgust or loathing… If only.  Just one.</p><p>He closes his eyes, leans against the rough stone along the dark staircase.  The damp mineral smell of it calms him, eases the lump in his throat.  He will be alright.  He fucking has to be, because he’s about to run the Gryffindor gauntlet and he needs his tattered wits about him.  He doesn’t have a plan, and that’s always a terrible position to be in, when there’s any risk of altercation with Potter. </p><p>He tightens the disillusionment spell about his person, strengthens it again.  His brain is rebelling at complicated tasks like this, but he only needs to hold it in place long enough to shove this gift into Evans’ hands, or slide it across the table to her in the Great Hall.  It’s safest that way.  He doesn’t need her to see him; she’ll know who it’s from, when she opens it.</p><p>He’s too late.  The Gryffindor table is already emptying, and he sees Pettigrew and the werewolf cramming their schoolbags with the remainder of the toast.  Damn it.  He curses, his mouth silently forming the words.  Damn Macnair, and damn Avery too.  Damn the lot of them. </p><p>Perhaps they’ve only left to fetch their luggage – if he waits at the steps, where they’ll have to pass on their way to the carriages?  That might work. </p><p>No time for a cloak.  He trots down to the entrance, forcing himself out into the frigid morning air.  Across the causeway, through the arches.</p><p>Oh hell, they’re already ahead of him.  Potter’s levitating Evans’ trunk for her, while she leans on his arm, and rises to say something private in his ear.  They’re descending the stairs, to where the carriages are waiting in an orderly queue, and there’s nothing else for it.</p><p>“Evans!  Evans, wait up!”  He rushes forward, hope and despair warring in his breast, as she pauses, turns, and scowls at seemingly empty air.</p><p>Has she recognized his voice, is that what’s prompted the scowl?  Potter’s done, that much is certain.  The wretched cunt takes aim with his wand, but Snape’s lucky, the spell glances off the stairs just in front of him.  Haha, he’s missed, the stupid bastard.</p><p>No he hasn’t.</p><p>He feels his feet fly out from beneath him, and there is sudden glancing pain throughout his body as his momentum sweeps him down the stairs.  He collapses in a puddle at Evans’ feet, dignity and disillusionment spell in shreds.</p><p>He sits up, horrified, but experiences the next moments in a flood of relief: his fall hasn’t crushed the gift.  He is almost giddy with this unlooked for scrap of luck.  Despite the sharp, horrible pain centered in his tailbone, a bright grin breaks across his face as he gazes up into Lily’s leaf-green eyes.  “Here, Evans, this – it’s for you!” he says, all unwary of the stormclouds building along her brow.</p><p>She makes no move to accept the gift he proffers.  “Why would I want <em>anything</em> from the likes of <em>you</em>?”</p><p>“Please.  Please, Lily, just take it, don’t make a scene,” he whispers, begs, thrusting the bright package up into her unwilling hands.</p><p>“Don’t make a scene, you say?  Don’t make a scene!  You’ve some nerve, Severus Snape!  You think I owe you anything?  You think there’s anything you could ever do to make up for being the pathetic filth you are?  You’re nothing but rubbish, Snape!”  She punctuates each of these phrases by viciously ripping at the careful bow, clawing through the packaging.  A piece of gold paper wafts down from the dismembered box, and her fingers on the flask are white, like the rage that tightens her lips.  “Stay the hell away from me, and I won’t tell you so again!”</p><p>She winds her arm back, and the little flask arcs from her fingertips, flashing in the cold morning sunlight. </p><p>He turns to watch its trajectory with the weight of inevitability pressing hard and black in his stomach. </p><p>It strikes a step in a burst of glass and liquid gold, the scattering droplets flaring bright as they dilute in ice and snow.</p><p>When he fights through his disbelief, his dismay, and is finally able to turn back to her, she has gone.  “I only wanted to wish you luck.”  His whispered words float away in a breath of icy fog.  He watches her grip Potter’s arm, watches the lot of them pile, laughing, into a waiting carriage.  Macnair gives him a solid kick in the ribs as he and the Parkinson boys head to their own holidays.  He cannot bring himself to care, much.  He cannot bring himself to stand up, even.  Defense or retaliation is more effort than he can even conceive of mustering; the necessary energy is completely beyond him.</p><p>The carriages roll down the lane, accompanied by the joyous ringing tones of the carillon.</p><p>Snow begins to fall. </p><p>He can feel it melting where it settles on his hair; little trickles of cold water snaking down to his scalp.  The icy chill of the stone step has begun to numb the pain in his tailbone.  A sullen gust of wind whips the golden bow back against his robes.</p><p>He closes his eyes, and wonders, vaguely, if his tears might freeze them shut.</p><p>He is just so tired.</p>
