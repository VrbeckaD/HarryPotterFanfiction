    <p>
  <span>The sixth-year Gryffindors were all gathered around the small television in the common room when it happened.</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span><br/>
</span>
  <span>The Christmas tree had arrived overnight, appearing in the morning as if by magic, as it always did on December 1st. A large box of ratty Christmas tree decorations had appeared with it; it was tradition for the older students to decorate it that evening, giving the tree their own twist. Usually that “twist” was, rather unimaginatively, Gryffindor red and gold.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But that year, Marlene McKinnon took charge. She skipped classes in order to spend all day painting the baubles black. Then she had strung together hundreds of safety pins to make a long, thin garland to wrap around the tree in lieu of tinsel. It looked strangely brilliant.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Happy punk Christmas!” she declared once it was done.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius, meanwhile, put himself in charge of keeping the rest of the students liquidated, mixing up a strong, bright-red Christmas punch with cranberry juice and rum.</span>
</p><p>So by the time Bill Grundy’s Today show came on at six, everyone was feeling very merry (in both senses of the word).</p><p>
  <span>“Look - it’s the Sex Pistols!” said McKinnon, her voice low and reverent, when the band appeared on screen in front of them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Everyone had been talking about this band for weeks. The newspapers were full of their scandalous exploits: how the lead singer, Johnny Rotten, had been spotted because he used to walk up and down King’s Road in Chelsea - not far from Sirius’s family home - spitting at people “because they were stupid”. There were near-hysterical editorials about the fights that regularly broke out at gigs. There was a rumour that one girl had lost an eye in all the madness, and that someone else had their ear bitten off. To the media, the band seemed to signal the end of civilisation itself.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>According to the cousins and friends of Hogwarts students who were lucky enough to go to a gig, it was the start of a revolution.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>On screen, Grundy joked that the band were “as drunk as I am!” and James Potter cheered, raising his glass up to the TV in a toast, and throwing his arm around Sirius’s shoulders.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“They look horrible,” Lily Evans sniffed, moving away from them - but still, Sirius noted, cradling a glass of punch in her hand.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was true that the men and women on TV were unlike any Sirius had ever seen before. They were laughing and sneering at Grundy (who was, to be fair, a bit of an idiot). One of the blokes in the back was wearing a swastika armband. One of the women was wearing a white shirt, black trousers and braces. She she had short, peroxide blonde hair and was smoking a cigarette in the studio.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She’s fit,” Sirius said, oddly entranced.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s Siouxsie Sioux,” McKinnon told him. She whispered the name like it was holy.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Grundy asked the band about classical artists like Beethoven and Mozart, and the camera cut to Johnny Rotten. There was something electric about him. He had the face of a madman, his eyes wide as he rocked back and forth and muttered to himself. “Oh yeah,” he said. “They </span>
  <em>
    <span>really </span>
  </em>
  <span>turn us on…”</span>
</p><p>“Suppose they turn other people on?” asked Grundy.</p><p>
  <span>“What is he going on about?” asked James, as Rotten mumbled something else.</span>
</p><p>“What?” asked Grundy.</p><p>
  <span>“Nothing. A rude word,” said Rotten. “Next question!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, no, what was the rude word?” pressed Grundy.</span>
</p><p>“Shit.”</p><p>
  <span>The Gryffindors burst out laughing. “Oh my God!” Peter Pettigrew exclaimed, almost falling out of his chair</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is he allowed to say that on TV?” asked Evans, looking horrified.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Definitely not,” snorted Sirius. He hoped his parents were watching; his father was probably already on the phone to complain to the BBC about proper decorum.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“They’re brilliant,” James decided.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What do you reckon, Remus?” Sirius asked, elbowing the boy next to him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Remus Lupin tried to keep his face impassive, but the corner of his mouth tugged up anyway. “Very uncouth,” he said, low enough that only Sirius could hear. “No wonder you love them.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Meanwhile, the interview had descended into chaos. “Go on, you’ve got another five seconds,” Grundy said. “Say something outrageous.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You dirty bastard!” said another band member, who was wearing a sleeveless white shirt with a black-and-white photograph of breasts across the chest. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Go on, again,” goaded Grundy.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You dirty fucker… What a fucking rotter.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Holy shit,” said Sirius, as the Gryffindors fell into stunned silence. James's mouth was wide open. Evans had covered her face in shock. McKinnon was beaming.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>This had never happened before.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>No one swore on the BBC - certainly not at 6pm on a Wednesday night. Something was happening. These people were breaking every rule in the book, live on television, and grinning as they did it. They looked wild. They looked magical.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They were starting something.</span>
