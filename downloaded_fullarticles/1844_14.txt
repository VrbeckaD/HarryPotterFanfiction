    <p>*Undisclosed Location South of Wales*<br/>
Looking at the glass coffin the two boys tentatively stepped forward. The coffin was completely glass upon a wooden dais, an almost disappointment in comparison to all the security, tricks, and warding that had to be done to get there. They had lost good witches and wizards in an attempt to get to this small room for this “Weapon” that was meant to change the tide of the war. But all that was here was a woman lying peacefully in her place. The woman in the coffin was rather plain. Her button nose was cute enough, her figure was petite with no exceptional assets and the only thing disrupting the otherwise peaceful image was her hair. It was big and loud, even while in this coma like state her hair was crackling and snapping with unreleased energy. She was dressed simply in a clearly expensive white gown that was adorned with intricate beading, complicated textures, and gold lining that looked to be liquid metal. She looked like an angel, no older than the age of 17. If you ignored her hair she looked precious, fragile, her gentle presence was persuasive and it half convinced both boys that she had to be protected by the darkness of the world.<br/>
“Harry, mate, are you sure we’ve got the right room?”<br/>
Breaking out of his trance the man named Harry looked at his red headed friend and then the coffin. It didn’t seem right, why wouldn’t have Dumbledore tell them? Why send them on this mission and withhold what they were fighting to do? Why have good witches and wizards die just for a girl? Merlin, so many people died and they haven’t even  begun the battle yet. Tonks, Moody, Sirius, Bill, and so many more had lost their lives to the cause, dwindling their already small battalion to minuscule.<br/>
Wiping the tears from his face and looking at the girl in the coffin once again. Releasing his magic to locate something, anything to state that this was the place. he feels it. A whisper of a feeling so small that he would have missed it if the feeling didn’t make his heart skip a beat. Staring at the coffin he whispers so low that his friend could barely hear<br/>
“This is it”<br/>
“What? How do you know? There’s a thousand rooms in this place”<br/>
“Because Ron, Dumbledore said a ‘place of light’. This is the only place in this entire fortress without a dark object and with windows”<br/>
Looking up towards the source of light, the sun was shining brightly warming the old stone and giving life to the vine curled along the crevices.<br/>
“Alright, mate, let’s go”<br/>
The black haired boy, not yet a man, steps forward until he is hovering above the coffin. Pulling a diamond etched with runes from his pocket, he fumbles trying to do exactly what Dumbledore instructed.<br/>
“Harry, my boy. We’re losing” Looking at the gray haired wizard, Harry could tell he was tired.<br/>
“We’ll fight .sir, we can do this. We just need more time”<br/>
“Time isn’t something we have, my boy. Now, listen closely. In my youth I made a mistake and now that mistake might be our only chance to win the war. You need to infiltrate Voldemort’s fortress, find the room of light, and place this diamond in the epicenter of the heart and bring her to me”<br/>
“Her? Voldemort’s fortress? Sir, that’s impossible!”<br/>
“You must ,Harry, You must. It is our only chance”<br/>
Opening the coffin slowly, an alarm blares and the hallway flashes red.Pulling back the curls of the girl, yanking down the collar of the dress. Harry then places the diamond on her heart while muttering in Latin<br/>
“Rewrite<br/>
what should<br/>
have not<br/>
been done,<br/>
Reverse<br/>
The dark<br/>
The infected piece<br/>
Make her<br/>
What she<br/>
Had once been”<br/>
Over and over again until the diamond began to burn in his hands. Despite the feeling of flames licking his palms he just gripped the diamond tighter and began to chant louder, willing the flame to rise, willing the heat to hurt, until it became to much and he released. Getting a brief glimpse of the dark tendrils immigrating from the girls heart to the diamond turning the once clear stone pitch black. As the last tendril of darkness left her the now obsidian diamond shattered and turned to ash leaving no remnants of the once pure diamond. </p>
<p>The brunettes eyes slowly blink open<br/>
“Tom?”<br/>
Whipping around Harry gingerly pulls out his wand holding it to compensate for the diamond etched scar on his hands while Ron immediately pulls out his want pointing it to the unarmed girl. Realigning her focus, she looks at the only two people in the room eyes focusing on the boy directly in front of her.<br/>
“Charlus? What are you doing here? What’s happening Charlie? Where’s Tom? How’s baby James? “ confused by the onslaught of questions Harry just stares at her.<br/>
“What happened to your eyes Charlie? Does Betty know you’ve been playing with her cosmetic charms again? Where’s Tom ? What happened to your clothes?”<br/>
Despite Her questioning being in a soft, ethereal whisper she could still be clearly heard and it seemed almost urgent. Harry was still stunned by the brunettes addressing him so familiarly. Suddenly she turns and catches the sight of Ron with his wand at ready<br/>
“F-f-Fabian? W-w-why are you here? You need to get away!” Scrambling backward promptly falling off her dais<br/>
“TOM!!! TOM!!!!! Where are you Tom? He’s here! TOM YOU SAID YOU'D NEVER LEAVE MEE!!! WHERE ARE YOU?!?! where are you?”<br/>
The last phrase is said in barely a whisper as her tears start freely falling and her nose begins running.<br/>
The two boys are stunned by her sudden show of emotion.<br/>
“Ron, we need to go. We can’t stay here”<br/>
Nodding quickly they begin approaching the small woman as if they were approaching an endangered doe.. slowly and with light steps they begin to hear more commotion from the hall then the alarm. And suddenly just before they were able to reach her, The door slams open and in comes Lord Voldemort. He was the stuff of legend, his cruelty was only exceeded by his brilliant mind and the boys could feel his magic as soon as he entered. Powerful and dark and all consuming the man was more monster than man. Looking up fearing for their lives he comes sweeping with swirling dark robes and a snake like face. His eyes were blood red, his nose was non existent and nothing more than slits and his hands were spindly and long with his nails carved into claws. In a surprisingly human voice he yells<br/>
“Sunshine! Mia!”<br/>
Her head looks up, tears still streaming down her face. Her mouth opens to speak but before a word can come out Harry lunges forward and grabs both Ron and “Mia” and apparates out to a nearby field just outside the fortresses realm of influence.</p>
<p>Falling down gasping they all spend a second on the floor<br/>
“-Tom?” Looking around she noticed that they’ve left the premise and turns to the two boys exclaiming<br/>
“Ok you two. I don’t know what the fuck is happening and frankly this all seems like a batshit crazy dream. But while I’m here I want answers. First and foremost what year is it? And who. Are. You?”<br/>
The red head splutters at the girls sudden demands. Diplomatically, Harry steps forward and<br/>
says in as calm as a voice he can muster<br/>
“My name is Harry and we’re going to take you somewhere and then all your questions can be answered”  she eyes him skeptically<br/>
“And are you by any chance part of the Potter line,...Harry?”<br/>
Looking into her amber eyes for the first time he feels that persuasion once again and he blurts out<br/>
“Yes, ma’am”<br/>
Contemplating the situation she nods slowly hoping that the Potter vows of fidelity that Charlie made were still active.<br/>
Allowing him to grasp her arm she looks at him and says as regally as possible<br/>
“I’ll allow it”<br/>
The red head, offended by her audacity and distraught by the death of his brother begins to yell<br/>
“You’ll allow it? ALLOW IT? you don’t have a choice. You are the order’s until we deem you useless. You hear me? You cost us good people… good witches and wizards and so you better make it worth it or so help me Merlin…”<br/>
Letting go of her arm<br/>
“-RON!”<br/>
“WHAT HARRY WHAT? We lost good people” voice breaking<br/>
“I lost Bill, Harry, my brother! And, Merlin, you lost Sirius! And for what? Because we tried to get some broad? Because she was suppose to be worth it? Look at her!”<br/>
“Come on Ron, we’ll talk when the mission is finished”<br/>
Grabbing her arm once again<br/>
“Let’s go”</p>
