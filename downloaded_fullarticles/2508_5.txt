          <div class="userstuff"><p>“Pansy, I’m trying to study.”</p><p>“But I wanna go out,” Pansy whines in response, dramatically laying across Hermione’s lap, effectively obstructing her view of her textbook.</p><p>Hermione sighs. “So go out then. Ask Blaise to go with you.”</p><p>“I want to go out with you though!”</p><p>Shaking her head, Hermione fights a fond smile. “Nope.”</p><p>“C’mon, ‘Mione,” Pansy practically purrs, looking up at her with hooded, dark eyes. “Just for a little bit? You don’t even have to drink; then you can just take care of me instead!”</p><p>“Pansy, I have a test next week−”</p><p>“So? You have plenty of time to study, plus, you could probably pass it without even trying!” Pansy wastes no time starting to tickle her girlfriend’s belly. “C’mon, live a little!”</p><p>“Pansy!” Hermione squeals, the highlighter dropping from her fingers as she starts to laugh. “This is soho not fair!”</p><p>“Say we can go out, and I’ll stop.”</p><p>“Fine, fine!”</p><p>Pansy stops, pouting. “You give up so fast. Too ticklish?”</p><p>“Shut up,” she replies, blushing. “If we’re gonna go out, get off my lap so I can get ready.”<br/>“If you really need to study, we don’t have−”</p><p>“Nope, now we’re going. Should I wear that new black skirt?”</p><p>Pansy grins, sitting up. “Absolutely.”</p><p>And Hermione doesn’t regret it.</p></div>
