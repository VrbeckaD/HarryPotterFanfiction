    <p align="center">ϟ ϟ ϟ ϟ</p><p>It'd been happening again for weeks now. Harry would close his eyes, and, at some point in the night, wake up in a cold sweat with disconnected images fading away in the wake of his consciousness. The dreams were not as vivid as they has been the previous year, and they were a lot harder to recall the next day; the one thing he could ever remember was looking at the ruins of a black journal with an overwhelming feeling of being <em> trapped </em>.</p><p>What Harry couldn't <em> quite </em> determine, though, was whether these images were slipping through he and Voldemort's connection, or if they were just a side effect of his recent training with Dumbledore.</p><p>He was inclined to think the latter since he didn't wake up with his scar burning and there hadn't yet been anything alarming in the dreams themselves. At least… as far as he could tell. He was fairly sure he'd have remembered if there <em> had </em> been anything to worry about.</p><p>So, despite Ron and Hermione's protests, Harry elected to keep these new night terrors to himself. After all, there was no reason to trouble Dumbledore with something that was probably just his imagination.</p><p>What if the headmaster took it as a sign that Harry wasn't able to handle what they were doing? Or worse, what if he thought Voldemort was spying through him and stopped trusting him altogether?</p><p>No, Harry couldn't risk it, not when there was still so much he had to do- more important things than whatever echoes of nightmares were swimming at the edge of his subconscious.</p><p>As long as the dreams didn't get any worse, Harry could deal with the cold sweats and lack of sleep. After all, he'd gotten quite used to them during last term.</p><p>All it took to get through the day was a cold shower, lots of coffee, and unyielding concentrat-</p><p>“Mr. Potter!” Professor Mcgonagall snapped at him, hitting the surface of his desk with her wand for emphasis.</p><p>Harry’s eyes shot open (when had they closed?) and he sat up so quickly he nearly tipped his chair back.</p><p>“Now that you've <em> graciously </em> rejoined the waking world,” Mcgonagall started scornfully, “would you <em> kindly </em> tell me the two most important rules for cross species transfiguration?”</p><p>“Er-” Harry started, taking his mind for some semblance of an answer. He frantically caught Hermione's eye from the desk two rows in front of him. She was slowly moving her lips around the answer. “You need to their... <em> Latin </em> names…? And, um, clear and deliverance? Motions?”</p><p>“<em> Deliverance </em> , Mr. Potter <em> ? </em>”</p><p>Hermione sighed and shook her head before silently annunciating the word at an even slower pace.  </p><p>“No, no, sorry, I meant <em>deliberate</em> wand movements.” Harry recovered, looking nervously at Mcgonagall. “Er- you see, what I was <em>trying </em>to say was that you have to <em>deliver</em> <em>deliberate</em> wand, uh, wand movements.”</p><p>The professor studied the raven haired boy over her glasses, clearly unimpressed. “I do hope you're better at reading your texts than lips, Mr. Potter; I'm afraid you'll find that Miss Granger won't always be there to feed you the answer. And <em> should </em> you feel the urge to doze off in my class again, then you might find yourself waking up as a three-toed newt! Am I understood?”</p><p>The class sniggered, but quickly silenced when Mcgonagall's eyes swept over them.</p><p>“Yes, professor.” Harry mumbled, averting his eyes to the surface of his desk. “It won't happen again.”</p><p>“Quite,” she responded curtly before turning around and continuing the lecture as though nothing happened. Harry had to shove Ron's shoulder to get him to stop laughing under his breath.</p><p>After class, Harry was thoroughly berated by Hermione as they made there way to Herbology. The skies were thick and grey, crisp humidity hung like an unspoken threat in the air around them. The paths had been charmed to stay dry from the snow that had been pushed in mounds on the sides as the bitter air nipped at their ears and noses.</p><p>“Honestly, Harry,” the girl chided, wrapping her scarf tighter to face, “what's gotten into you? You look like you haven't slept in <em> days </em>.”</p><p>“I'm <em> fine </em>, Hermione, really.” the raven haired boy replied, annoyed.</p><p>She gave him a withering look, “If you were really fine you wouldn't have <em> fallen asleep </em> in Professor Mcgonagall’s class!”</p><p>“She's got you there, mate,” Ron nodded, nudging Harry playfully as they walked, “that or you’ve finally gone <em> absolutely mental </em>!”</p><p>“You haven't been,” Hermione dropped her voice and leaned closer, “having anymore <em> dreams </em>, have you?”</p><p>“No I haven't actually,” Harry lied easily, “<em> thanks </em>for asking.”</p><p>“<em> Harry </em>,” the witch sighed, gently pulling the other off the path to keep out of earshot, “Ron's told me that you've been waking up at night and you're always up before we are-”</p><p>“He did, did he?” he cast his friend a venomous look. “What are you my <em> monitor </em> now?”</p><p>“We're just <em> worried </em>, mate.” Ron confessed quietly.</p><p>“Well <em> don't </em> be.” Harry snapped. “Just because I'm not sleeping well doesn't mean Voldemort's in my head! Has it occurred to either of you that <em> maybe </em> I'm just stressed?”</p><p>Hermione sighed, “Harry-”</p><p>“Heya, guys!”</p><p>Harry forced out a breath before replying, “Hey, Neville.”</p><p>Ron and Hermione were still looking at their friend nervously as they each mumbled their hellos.</p><p>“Er, sorry,” Neville started awkwardly, “did I interrupt something?”</p><p>“Course not!” Harry smiled, clapping a hand on the taller wizard's shoulder, “We were just heading to class. Care to join us?”</p><p>Harry led the way to the greenhouse talking to Neville about the incoming weather; his best friends exchanged exasperated looks before following.</p><p>Harry's sleep deprivation wasn't brought up again the rest of the day, sticking instead to lighter topics such as homework and their plans for the Hogsmeade trip coming up in a couple days. Hermione expressed interest in seeing if the bookshop had any new titles in, while Ron couldn't wait to try out the new merchandise the twins had apparently sold to Zonko's. Harry, however, planned on staying at the castle to work more on the task Dumbledore gave him. After that, their table stayed mostly quiet, save for the scratching of quills on parchment.</p><p>By the time they all turned in, the dark sky had finally opened up on them. Harry sat in his four poster bed watching the harsh snow stain their usually colorful window as the room slowly filled with the sound of his dorm mates’ steady breathing.</p><p>When he was younger, he hated storms in any form- rain, snow, hail, etc. were always welcomed with fresh bruises and sour moods. Primarily, the teen hated them because the weather would trap the Dursleys inside, which meant it was nearly impossible to escape penance for Dudley's boredom. But also, Harry had grown up with the understanding that his parents had been killed driving drunk in a storm. Somehow, the drinking part of the story hadn't sat right with him- the young wizard couldn't buy into it no matter what story was told to support it- but the rest made sense. So, for nearly a decade the boy associated bad weather with sorrow and <em> pain </em>.</p><p>It had taken a while, but eventually Harry was able to replace his cold, mournful feelings with ones of warm nostalgia- of Hogwarts, of staying up late in the common room, lights strewn around the snow powdered trees, practicing repelling charms for quidditch.</p><p>And on the somewhat rare occasion Harry was able to sit alone in the dark just <em> listening </em> to a stormy night- from the pattering on the window, to the subtle sound of wind shaking the roof- he had a chance to really clear his mind of everything it was drowning in. This stormy night was no exception.</p><p>Through the constant tapping of heavy, what now appeared to be sleet and the low rumble of dark clouds, Harry thought about his mission with Slughorn and how badly he’d botched it. He'd never been good at manipulating people- charming them into doing what he asked. He was used to being disliked, to disregarding the image expected of him in favor of simply being who he was. It was a survival tactic he'd picked up from his life on Privet Drive where nothing he did could change his relatives’ minds, so why bother being anything but himself?</p><p>But just this <em> once </em> Harry wished he could change that- that he could be as charming and clever as the young Tom Riddle he'd seen in the pensive. If he could have chosen what abilities Voldemort passed to him, <em> that </em> would certainly have been more helpful than random surges of bloodlust. Not that he’d tell anyone that, of course. He could already imagine the horrified and slightly sick expressions that would be painted on Ron and Hermione’s faces.</p><p>Harry smiled a little at that thought- how <em> priceless </em> their responses would be. It would serve them right for being so smothering. Not that their intentions weren’t well placed, and Harry did recognize how lucky he was to have people in his life who <em> did </em> actually worry for him, but still, at times their concern was overwhelming.</p><p>Often it felt as though they didn’t <em> believe </em> him when he told him how he was feeling, which, if he thought about it, was valid. Even though he hated to admit it, Harry wasn’t the best at sharing his emotions, instead shouldering them so as not to burden anyone else. He didn’t like talking about things- didn’t really know <em> how </em> . So, yes, the young wizard could understand where his friend’s reluctance laid, but, that didn’t mean they had to read into <em> every </em> little thing he did. After all, sometimes a dream was just a dream.</p><p>Sirius had always been good at that, though- at showing Harry that he cared and would always be there if he wanted to share anything without being overbearing. He was mindful of the teen’s shortcomings, but never made him feel like a child for them. And Harry <em> missed </em> that. He missed that and everything else he took for granted.</p><p>But mostly, he missed his Godfather, the man. Who loved- who<em> smiled </em> - despite every horror done to him, who had deserved so <em> so </em> much more out of life than he was thrown. Sirius Black, the man who died needlessly out of Harry’s own naivety.</p><p>And there it was, the inevitable <em> pain </em> his solitude brought to the surface, perhaps amplified somewhat from the gloom of the midnight storm.</p><p>Harry took a deep breath, pulling his knees closer to his chest and hiding his face in his arms. If he didn’t get that memory from Slughorn, all of this pain, this <em> suffering </em> may have been for nothing at all.</p><hr/><p> </p><p><em> He was cold. </em> <em> So </em> <em> cold. His core was ice and his body pulsing wisps of bitter fog- from the crown of his head to the tips of his toes. He felt… </em></p><p><em> Well, to be honest, he didn’t </em> <em> know </em> <em> how he felt. </em></p><p><em>Confused, anxious, empty, and again, </em><em>so</em> <em>cold</em><em>.</em></p><p><em> When he opened his eyes, he was met with arched ceilings that seemed to go on forever into darkness. Constant dripping could be heard inconsistently echoing through the large space he seemed to be in. The teen sat up slowly, looking curiously at the smooth dark green tile he’d been lying on. It looked familiar somehow, but before he could place it, he watched a thick drop of water falling from the ceiling go directly </em> <em> through </em> <em> his hand. The boy’s eyes widened, uncertainty taking over his mind as he quickly scrambled to his feet. He held both hands in front of him, studying them intently. Fingertips touched gingerly together- the feeling dull, delayed- and when he turned them toward the dim light at his side, he could easily see the cold outlines of white stone through them. He brought those strange hand to his face like smoke to a mirror. </em></p><p>
  <em> Panic gripped his icy core like a vice, and the boy scrambled toward the source of the cold, damp light. There was a dark pool at the edge of the dark emerald tile, surface still as glass as he looked into it. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Harry stared down at a face that wasn’t his- one that he’d spent months looking at in the pensive, that haunted him since second year, that had easily fooled so many with its strong features and charming grin. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> A very shocked, very transparent Tom Riddle looked back at Harry in the dark waters, disturbed only by the occasional drop from the ceiling. Then the reflection snarled at him, a variant to the horror Harry still felt etched on his face, and suddenly a cold hand shot out of the water and wrapped itself around the wizard’s throat. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Then he was overwhelmed by flashes of memories- a ruined journal, cruel high pitched laughter over a flash of blinding green light, Riddle spelling words of fire in the air, red eyes like a snake peering at him from over a headstone, a young man twisting a ring in his fingers as he looked into a fire- </em>
</p><p><em> ‘It’s called, as I understand it… a </em> <em> Horcrux…’ </em></p><hr/><p>Harry sat bolt upright in bed, sucking in a desperate breath as a sharp shiver ran down his spine.</p><p>“<em> Sshhiitt</em>,” he hissed, running a shaky hand through sweat slick hair- the lightning scar on his forehead pricked subtly, <em> ominously </em> beneath his skin. Maybe it was time to consider that there might be a <em> little </em> bit more to these dreams than he wanted to admit.</p><p>The teen had a hard time going back to sleep that night- he’d stayed up writing down every detail of the dream he could remember before it slipped away with the waning moon.  When the sun rose, staining their room with blinding shades of reds and orange, the teen flinched himself awake once more at the hoarse whine of Neville realizing he’d tangled himself in his sheets <em> again </em>.</p><p>Harry yawned like a lion, stretching his tired limbs in his bed- a pen and notebook slipped from his chest and onto the floor with a soft <em> thud </em> - before roughly scrubbing at his stinging eyes. Though he was relieved to find he’d managed to fall back to sleep, the young wizard could feel deep in his bones that it hadn’t been nearly enough. It was going to be another long day ahead, which meant extra provisions would be needed to keep awake. Falling asleep with Mcgonagall was bad enough, and he’d gotten off <em> way </em> easier that he should have, but if he were to accidentally nodded off in <em> Snape’s </em> class- well, detention certainly would be the least of his worries.</p><p>Still, he just had to make it through this <em> one </em> day, and then it would be the weekend. The castle would be nearly empty with all the upperclassmen going to Hogsmeade, so Harry might actually have a chance to catch up on some of the sleep he’d been deprived of. He had planned on trying his luck with Slughorn again, but in this condition, he doubted he’d do any better than the last time. So, sleep became the new game plan for the weekend. At least, if fate would be so kind, which Harry never counted on it to be.</p><p>Ron and Hermione met him in the Great Hall not long after his first cup of coffee. The red haired boy grunted a sleepy thanks at the mug Harry had prepared for him while Hermione started right in on her orange juice.</p><p>“Sleep alright, Harry?” She asked in an overly casual tone as she grabbed a piece of toast.</p><p>Harry had anticipated this like one would anticipate the coming day, but still he couldn’t deny the pang of annoyance that shot through him.</p><p>“Not at all,” he replied truthfully, setting his cup down with a grimace- he’d asked the elves to make it extra strong, knowing he’d need the caffeine, and, boy did they deliver. “I slept like absolute <em>shite</em>.”</p><p>The girl across from him looked a little taken aback by his honesty, exchanging a quick look with their counterpart. Then there was a tiny twitch of triumph on her lips as she began buttering her toast in earnest. “Well,” she pressed cautiously, “was there any particular reason <em> why </em>?”</p><p>Harry rolled his eyes, but silently reminded himself to cut her some slack, she was only trying to help. “Actually, I had the <em> strangest </em> dream.”</p><p>Ron snorted at his side, “You? Strange dream? <em> Never! </em>”</p><p>He let out a small breath of laughter, happy that the tension around the trio had finally melted away. “Yeah, <em> big </em> surprise, I know.”</p><p>“Well,” Hermione interrupted seriously, leaning across the table as much as she could, “what was it <em> about </em>?”</p><p>Harry barely had the chance to take a breath before-</p><p>“<em> Oh Won-Won </em>!” A shrill voice crooned from the other end of the table.</p><p>“Bloody hell,” Ron groaned, “can’t I have just <em> one </em> moment alone!”</p><p>Harry shrugged, following Hermione’s lead and grabbing his things. He could already see the headache forming behind her brown eyes, and honestly wanted to leave before he got one himself.</p><p>“W-wait!” Ron started in a panic, standing up after them, “You can’t just <em> leave </em>me here!”</p><p>“There you are, Won-Won,” Lavender started as she cozzied herself next to him. “Saving some breakfast for me,” she wrapped her arm around his elbow and yanked him back down, positively <em> glaring </em> at Hermione, “how <em> sweet! </em>”</p><p>Surprisingly, Hermione didn’t take the opportunity to correct her on how it was the same <em> buffett </em> that was there <em> every </em> morning, so <em> of course </em> there would be food for her whether or not Ron saved it, which he <em> didn’t </em>. Instead, she merely chose to roll her eyes and walk away.</p><p>“Sorry, mate.” Harry gave his friend one last pitied look before following the brunette out of the Great Hall.</p><p>“Is it <em> bad </em> that I get a sense of satisfaction leaving Won-Won to wallow in the misery of <em> her </em> company?” Hermione asked as they walked.</p><p>“He did it to himself, really.” Harry shrugged, “Still, it does seem a bit <em> cruel </em>.”</p><p>The pair looked at each other and Hermione burst out laughing. “She really is <em> insufferable </em>, isn’t she?”</p><p>“No arguments there.”</p><p>They walked together in silence, neither indicating their destination, yet somehow ending up in the small sitting area off the stairs where Harry had found her crying just weeks ago. They settled on the soft red cushions beneath the brightly colored windows and Harry pulled out his notebook.</p><p>“I wrote down what I could remember,” he explained as he handed it over, “but I can’t guarantee that was <em> everything </em> that happened.”</p><p>Hermione examined the pages with the same attentiveness she used for studying, and when she was done, she turned the sheets back over and started again.</p><p>“Harry,” she started after about the third time through, “how did you <em> feel </em> when you were dreaming and when you woke up?”</p><p>“I don’t know, really-” the raven haired boy explained, curling his knees closer to his chest, “it- it wasn’t like the <em> other </em> dreams I’ve had from Voldemort. It felt- I don’t know- like I wasn’t really <em> there </em> . And I was anxious and angry and confused and so <em> so cold </em>.”</p><p>“And when you woke up?” the witch inquired. “Was you scar <em> hurting </em>at all?”</p><p>“A bit, I guess,” he shrugged, “it was more like an <em> itch </em> , though, rather than burning or needles.” Harry sighed, “I don’t know, Hermione. It isn’t really anything <em> like </em> the dreams I’ve had before, which is why I haven’t felt the need to share them.”</p><p>“What made you share this one?”</p><p>“I actually <em> remembered </em> it when I woke up and thought maybe you could see something I couldn’t.”</p><p>Hermione sighed, an uncertain expression on her face, “I don’t know, Harry. It <em> does </em> kind of just sound like a normal nightmare. I mean, you said it yourself, you’re under <em> a lot </em>of stress right now, it’s bound to take its toll somehow.”</p><p>“Yeah,” Harry frowned, torn between relief and disappointment. At least if it were something else, they could <em> fix </em> it and he could actually get some proper rest. “That’s kind of what I figured, too. But how am I supposed to <em> stop </em> it?”</p><p>“Well, dreams are meant to <em> help </em> our minds sort through things it can’t throughout the day. Mostly, it’s just replaying the day’s events in another light, but sometimes, especially when the mind is under a lot of stress, dreams become our subconscious’s way of examining the problem.”</p><p>“So my subconscious is dealing with my stress by sending me nightmares?”</p><p>“It’s more like, the nightmares are a side effect of your subconscious trying to sort through any problems you’re not dealing with.”</p><p>“That’s all well and good, but how do I make it <em> stop </em> ? I can’t just keep <em> not </em> sleeping, and I very much <em> doubt </em> Slughorn would be willing to spare some sleeping draught.”</p><p>The witch shrugged, “Maybe you should try to <em> listen </em> to what your subconscious is telling you.”</p><p>“Do you think that’ll help?”</p><p>Hermione looked at him sympathetically, “I don’t know, Harry, but caffeine and concentration charms aren’t going to work forever.”</p><p>And, sure enough, she was right. Harry had crashed hardcore in the middle of charms (thankfully his last class) and came very close to setting his notebook on <em> fire </em> . Lucky for him, Hermione had been paying attention and snapped him back to his senses before he could. After that, the young wizard found himself walking back to his dorm in a haze. All he needed was a few minutes, a little cat nap before dinner, and he'd be <em> fine </em>!</p><p>Harry yawned, hardly remembering to shuck off his bag and robes, pulling loose his tie before falling on top of his bed. He was asleep before his head even hit the pillow.</p>
