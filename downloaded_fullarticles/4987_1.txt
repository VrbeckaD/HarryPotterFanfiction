  <strong> <u>Moony</u> </strong>
</p>
<p><strong> <em>Lupin's Cottage</em> </strong><br/> <strong> <em>Welsh Countryside<br/> 27 February, 1964</em></strong></p>
<p>Night had fallen over the cold February night and blanketed a small cottage in the woods. Inside the cottage a clock filled the silence of the home with a faint ticking noise as it moved away from the ten o'clock mark. Outside a howl of some animal echoed through the woods and seemed to float into the resident child's bedroom window. </p>
<p>The full moon's light leaked through the glass and out of the curtains. The silvery light pooled over the chest of toys than onto the wooden floor. The sound had woken up the three-year-old that laid in bed; blankets tucked up to his chin.</p>
<p>The fear of the unknown sound hit him first. The darkness and silence of the night hit him after and made the howl seem like just a dream. Still, one could never be too sure. Carefully the boy slipped out of bed and made his way over to the window. He climbed up onto the toy chest to get a better view of the outside world. </p>
<p>Brown eyes looked up at the sky at the shining moon that was so bright it had blocked out a lot of stars. Only a few stars broke through the bright light of the moon. They stubbornly stayed twinkling in the vast darkness of the light sky above the house that rested in the woods. </p>
<p>Movement below pulled his gaze away from the moon and brought it to the woods below. The brightness of the moon made him see something dart into the trees. His first thought had been his cat that had gotten out two days ago. If he could bring the cat back he was sure his mother would be a little happier about the sudden vacation to their cottage.</p>
<p>The child slipped off of the toy chest and made his way over to where his shoes were kept. He grabbed a pair of rubber boots and slipped them on as well as grabbed his favorite jacket to put over his blue pajamas. Cautiously, he slipped from his bedroom and into the hall. The child's eyes scanned the darkness of the hallway anxiously; he did not want to alert his parents of his plan. This had to be a surprise plus there was no way his father would let him out on the night of a full moon.</p>
<p>He got to the end of the hall without his parents being alerted and took that as a sign that he was home free. He buttoned up his jacket and hurried down the stairs quickly but silently. The full moon’s light helped him see the objects that laid on the stairs and that could trip him as he made the quick journey down. </p>
<p>Once on the bottom step the small child hurried down the main hallway toward the back door. His small hand grabbed the handle. He gritted his teeth as he he pulled it open with some difficulty. The back door had been difficult for as long as he could remember; he had always needed his mother or father's help when he wanted to go through it. He was very proud of himself for getting it open on his own. </p>
<p>A light breeze through the small clearing where his family’s cottage sat and sent a chill up his spine. The moon gave everything an unearthly glow as the boy made his way out of the house. He just let the door slowly close behind him; not caring when it did not click back into place. The child simply stepped out onto the grass but hung hear the back steps. </p>
<p>“Silver?” He whispered and glanced around. He did not want to go near the woods at night. Something deep in his gut was telling him to turn and run; to get out of there as fast as he could. He did not listen to these warnings but simply hugged himself tightly and bravely took a step toward a section of the forest he had last spotted the cat.</p>
<p>“S-silver?”</p>
<p>Something moved in the thick brush and a spark of hope lit up inside the child.</p>
<p>"Silver, get out of there you sill cat."</p>
<p>He let his arms loosen the hug around his torso and hurried over to the shadowed trees. </p>
<p>Then everything went wrong. </p>
<p>The happiness turned to fear in an instant as feral yellow eyes appeared in he darkness of the woods. A sick feeling came over the toddler that could only be described as pure terror; something a person of his age should never experience. The boy had stood frozen, staring at those eyes, until the creature that owned them let out a terrifying howl. At the sound, the boy snapped out of his daze and turned to run back to the house as fast as his small legs could carry him.</p>
<p>As the boy began to run a large beast broke through the tree line and started chasing after him.</p>
<p>In the light of the moon the creature’s fur glowed in shades of silver and brown. Its eyes screamed for blood and matched the blood stained fangs it had bared. It was easy to see that this beast was powerful. That it was larger and faster than the prey it was chasing. The human child had no chance. </p>
<p>In a single bound the creature jumped on the child and the boy hit the ground.</p>
<p>He cried out in alarm when he felt the grass and dirt scrape against him. Panic had set in and all he could think was that he needed to get away. That he needs to get back inside. That he needs his parents.</p>
<p>The tried to escape but a large paw that was trying to keep the small meal down got his face. The sharp claws ripped the flesh too close to his eyes for comfort. Blood began to run from the cuts and mixed with the tears that ran down his face. Some ran from above his eyebrow and made it harder to see any way of escape. Just as he was about to cry and crawl for escape he was struck with unimaginable pain in his shoulder and side. </p>
<p>The beast that had caught him had sunken its teeth into him. The massive mouth went from his right shoulder down to his hip and pierced through the flesh like it was nothing but paper. A scream of pure agony came from the small meal the creature had found itself but it paid it no mind. Most of the treats it caught made a lot of noise at first; it would end soon and it would get a snack out of this human. </p>
<p>Creature was wrong on that regard. The screams of pure terror had woken up the adults inside. The relief of them bursting out of the back door was not felt by the small child held in the grip of the monster. The wounds and blood loos had started to get to the child's head. There was so much blood yet he all he could feel was numbness and a dizziness that begged him to close his eyes.</p>
<p>“Remus!” </p>
<p>Someone screamed in his name in fear. It sounded like his mother but he could not be sure. He just wanted to close his eyes and hope this was all some terrible nightmare he was having in his warm bed in the cottage. </p>
<p>The scream seemed to have distracted the beast as it dropped the toddler back onto the ground in a bloody heap. It seems the thing thought a larger meal was much better than the tiny child. It raced towards Remus' father, who led it away from his wife and son. </p>
<p>The last thing Remus Lupin remembered before the world went dark was his mother's arms around him and her frantic words telling him to stay with her. </p>

<p>
  <strong> <em>Saint Mungo’s Hospital<br/> London, England</em></strong>
</p>
<p>Light. That was the first thing Remus was aware of when he felt himself come back. He thought he had died. That it was the end in of his short existence. But the light faded away to darkness again and that brought on a slow ache the spread everywhere. There should be no pain in death so this made no sense.</p>
<p>Remus shifted some in discomfort but that did not help at all. It just brought a shock of pain that made him want to cry. The ache was just too powerful for him to even want to try and open his eyes.</p>
<p>What had happened to him? If he was not dead than what was this sensation?</p>
<p>In the silence of the self asked questions he caught onto a sound. He focused the little energy he had to focus in on the sound to figure out what it was. A good distraction from his aching form. Finally he picked up on it. A quiet conversation was being held near the location he was in. Who were participating in it came just after he recognized it: one was his mother, one was his father, but the third he did not recognize. </p>
<p>He caught the sound of his mother crying; he could just imagine it in his mind. Her long tawny curls falling to hide her face as she cried into his father’s shoulder. The man would have a tight lipped look, his floppy brown hair in a neater arrangement. If his mother was crying than something had seriously upset her usually happy demeanor. </p>
<p>The answer to why she was crying came next. The words the third voice made him freeze in his small understanding of what was happening.</p>
<p>“…I am sorry to say but there is not cure.” Said the third voice. It sounded authoritative and almost did not sound apologetic at all. </p>
<p>“There has to be," his father's voice broke in. It had that waver that showed he was very upset though his face would never show it., "he cannot be turned into…into one of those things. He is too young, not even four." </p>
<p>The third person sighed. It sounded like they heard some kind of variation of this argument before in their life, “We are sorry but Lycanthropy has no cure, it is still in the research phase and with a war seemingly brewing as we speak it has been delayed. I can't just-."</p>
<p>“Don’t tell me what you can and cannot do," Lyall Lupin's voice raised in the once quiet conversation. It seemed to echo around in the place they were. The words of the third party had distressed him. "You are healers and it is your job to fix things like this. I will put as much as I can into research if it means that my son will not be stuck as a werewolf forever!”</p>
<p>The raised voice of his father had been the driving force to get Remus to open his eyes. He ignored the pain that it caused when he suddenly was assaulted with white and lights everywhere, obviously a hospital. His young mind was focused on the statement his father had just made. Him a werewolf? The creature that was the monster in all the stories his father told him. The creature that was always defeated for a happy ending. Was he that monster now? A thing that would go after every little boy and girl at night, every witch and wizard just because it could! </p>
<p>The thoughts brought tears to the boy’s eyes. He did not want to be evil. He just wanted to go home and have his cat back. </p>
<p>“We can keep him here for the first moon just to make sure nothing serious happens to him," the third voice explained calmly to his parents. Remus concluded it had to be his healer, "He is the youngest case we have ever seen. There is no telling how this will play out. Best you can do from him, if you are really going through with this route, is once he is released you should keep him away from the world, make sure every full moon there is a secure place you can put him, and get him registered with the Ministry. ”</p>
<p>Remus pushed through the aches to move his head to look over at his family. His father nodded along with what the healer said but Remus could clearly see that his father was not pleased with the advice and lack of real help that was being provided.</p>
<p>“I would also suggest" the healer continued, "that you both educate yourselves are much as you can on the transformations.They are not a pretty process. I have seen a few in my time, they are painful and straining for the lycanthrope. Most people afflicted with this curse have a shorter life span."</p>
<p>"What do you mean?" Hope Lupin's voice was quiet and thick with emotion.</p>
<p>"I am trying to say your son may die before he even reaches the end of his thirties at his age, at most his forties. The strain that the transformation takes will be aging due to the stress. I'm sorry.”</p>
<p>Remus watched his mother lift her head and look at the healer in front of her. He saw her mouth move but did not hear those words. The child did not mull over this when he saw her move away from her husband to move towards her son.</p>
<p>He looked away fast and tried to pretend he was not listening. He tried to pretend that he was not crying either but he could not hide the tears, or the pain, or the fear. As soon as he saw his mother next to him he started to cry; he let out everything that he was feeling when she swept him up into her arms. </p>
<p>“It will be alright, baby, Mummy’s got you," she whispered softly into his hair, "We won’t let anyone hurt you and won’t let you hurt anyone, I promise. I-I promise.”</p>
<p>Her voice wavered as she finished the promise. The woman was doing her best to sooth the scared child in her arms. Remus was so scared and the pain had only just begun from what she was understanding from the wizard doctor. It hurt her heart to see the small child like this and be unable to do anything about it. She was not a witch, just a retired insurance agent, a muggle according to the world she had married into. Even that magical world could not help her son so she was a mother without a cure to end his pain, magical or no. </p>
<p>Lyall Lupin had come over during the exchange, obviously done with the healer for now. His face was stoic as he watched his son cry into his mother's shoulder. All this had happened and guilt swarmed his gut.</p>
<p>“I will look for any way to help you Remus," he whispered.</p>
<p>Hope Lupin looked up at her husband as he said those words, their gazes connecting in a moment of understanding. They both were going to do everything they could to help their son. </p>
<p>“I promise,” he said with a nod.</p>
<p>Remus did not look up at his father to see that exchange. The boy just stayed connected to his mother as the sobs slowly died out to soft sniffling. Slowly, the room went silence once more and the heaviness that is the dread of the unknown took over the family. </p>
