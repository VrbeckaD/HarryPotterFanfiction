    <p>Colin found himself being alone quite a bit since he returned to Hogwarts. He couldn't think why everyone had been avoiding him, but one thing he did know was that Harry had kept well away. His hero, and longtime crush, was always busy doing something, and hadn't said a single word to Colin. This had made the younger boy feel like he was a freak, as without anyone around him, there was no one to confide in. He had considered talking to one of the Professors, but then again, what exactly could they do?</p><p>His heart hurt at the fact that Harry was not even looking at him when they sat at the table in the Great Hall, or were together in the Gryffindor common room. Colin's brain was telling him that he didn't stand a chance regardless of what happened, but his heart told him that Harry Potter was his, and only his. There was only so many times he could look at a picture he'd taken of Harry before he would become depressed that there was nothing between them.</p><p>Despite the fact that he knew it would come off as weird, Colin waited in the common room for Harry to get back for the evening. He enjoyed the warmth as he sat by the fire, and he watched the door, hoping that Harry wouldn't be out too late.</p><p>It was 11pm before Harry entered, and he looked tired. Colin was a little conflicted, but his heart was controlling him, so he grabbed Harry's hand as he walked by, and pulled him onto the sofa. Harry looked distant, but Colin wasn't going to be deterred.</p><p>"Where have you been?" Colin wondered.</p><p>"It's not really any of your business, is it?" Harry reacted.</p><p>"I get worried about you being out so late" Colin explained "We need you if he who must not be named will ever be defeated"</p><p>"So everyone keeps telling me" Harry commented "Now if you don't mind, I would like to go to bed"</p><p>Just as Harry was getting up, Colin held his arm and dragged him back down. He didn't care that Harry was older and bigger than him, Colin was only concerned in talking to Harry. As Colin started to shake lightly, Harry looked puzzled.</p><p>"Colin, what is your problem?!" Harry demanded "Since you started school, you cling to me all the time"</p><p>"No I don't" Colin insisted "In fact, I've not spoken to you since the end of last year"</p><p>"Stop stalling and just tell me what's wrong" Harry ordered.</p><p>"Do you really want to know?" Colin retorted.</p><p>"Yes I do" Harry confirmed "And preferably right now, as I would like to go to bed"</p><p>"Wow, so you really don't care?" Colin questioned.</p><p>"That's not what I said, so don't twist my words" Harry warned.</p><p>"Well, seeing as you asked" Colin rejoined "The reason I want to know where you've been, is because I am in love with you"</p><p>It was at that moment that Colin put his hands over his mouth in disbelief, not genuinely believing that he would ever tell Harry how he felt. He knew that Harry wouldn't necessarily feel the same way, but all he wanted at that point was an answer.</p>
