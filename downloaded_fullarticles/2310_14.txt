    <p>May 12, 1998</p><p>After the battle it was strange how seamlessly some things returned to normal; almost as strange as how others just didn’t. Hogwarts was in apparent ruins and yet the repairs were so quick it was almost as if the battle had never occurred; the lasting damage was in the people who had fought. Everyone on either side had lost someone they had cared for and no one was untouched by the ravages of the war. It had been just over a week since the battle and Harry found himself seated at another funeral sandwiched between Ginny and Ron in the very front row holding onto both of their hands as if it was all that tethered him to this world. He had lived, again, but the family that had done so much for him and had welcomed him in as one of their own was broken, incomplete and mourning. Fred had been a steadfast friend, supportive and considerate of others, always looking to protect those who needed it, a light of hope throughout the darkness of the war, and he was gone.</p><p>The row in which Harry sat was full and yet it still felt incomplete as Bill and Fleur headed off the line followed by Percy and Charlie, then seated firmly between his parents George looked a wreck. His hands lay limp in his lap though Molly continued to clutch at them and Arthur had wrapped his arm about his son’s shoulders as if each of them were trying to regain a sense that they were still there, that they still had one-an-other. Many people spoke at the service and shared what Fred had been to them, but Harry honestly didn’t feel like he had heard a word of it.</p><p>This was the first time since the battle that George had left his room at the Burrow, having locked himself in where all he had was his own memories of his brother until today; today he would get to see him one last time to say his own goodbye. As person after person stepped forward to share, Oliver Wood, Dennis Creevey, McGonagall, Angelina Johnson, Harry saw something like resolve grow in George’s frame. Finally, after a touching remark or two from Lee Jordan, George squeezed his mother’s hand and stood to approach the front of the room tugging his best friend into a crushing hug that left both men visibly emotional. Eventually Lee moved to step away but a tug at his hand stopped him,</p><p>“I need to do this, but I can’t do it alone mate.” Lee nodded in understanding and stationed himself beside his friend as George released him again and finally turned to look into the coffin where his brother lay.</p><p>“Hey Freddie, this funeral’s been a real drag, but I bet you’d have known just how to liven it up. Geddit? Liven it up?” Crooking a half smile at the still form of his brother he whispered, “Guess I’ll have to do the honors.” Turning back toward the friends and family who were assembled George cleared his throat,</p><p>“I’m sure most of you have realized this by now, but I’m George Weasley. I guess one thing that’s come of all this is that it’s gotten a lot easier for all of you to tell us apart, seeing as I’m the living and breathing one,” George’s laugh came out strangled and forced as he ploughed on, “but that doesn’t change the way my mum looked at me this morning as I came down the stairs, or the fact that for years I know some of you will slip and call me by his name. Your words today were a blessing and a heartache, and I can’t tell you how it feels to hear this outpouring of love. How Fred touched each of your lives and made them a little brighter in doing so. But I’ve grown sick of hearing how my brother was an inspiration, a role model, a troublemaker even how he was the love of your life.” Here his eyes found Angie’s from where she sat three rows back struggling to maintain her composure, “All of that is well and good, but the fact remains, Fred is my brother and your past tense nonsense won’t ever change that. Being a twin means something I don’t know how to explain, for years we made light of our oneness, called ourselves Gred and Forge we did,” here the chuckle was more fond than forced and Molly’s face lightened somewhat as his words stirred memories in her of how her boys had terrorized her. “but up until the battle Fred and I had never gone a day without the other by our side. From conception we were ‘Fred and George’ but now…” George stumbled over his words here and Lee pressed his hand to his shoulder, “Now it’s just me. I’m sure however, if he were able to he’d find some way to make light of this dreadful somber affair. He’d tell me ‘Well look at us Georgie Porgie, what a fine pair we make! Together we’re the Holey Spirit!’ that’s just the type of joke I know he’d be dying to make. Ok, ok, I know that one was in poor taste. Sorry mum. But really, this whole death thing really stinks.”</p><p>As if triggered by his words, and really they probably were, a cacophony of sound startled the congregation followed by shrieks and the overwhelming unpleasantness that was the smell of nearly 70 dungbombs being set off at once. So distracted by this interruption were the gathered assembly that no one noticed the way George smiled and whispered to himself, “It’s what he would’ve wanted.” before turning once more to the coffin and giving a final salute and following Lee, joining the masses streaming out of the great hall and onto the grounds surrounding Hogwarts.</p><p>Following their mass exodus people had begun to mingle offering comfort and words of sympathy and understanding to one-an-other as they continued to share memories of their interactions with Fred and seated themselves upon the lawn. This was a much more relaxed affair, and as far as he was concerned George thought Fred would’ve much preferred it to the formal nonsense of before. From where he now stood just outside the doors of Hogwarts, George could easily spot his family as they settled in the grass. Bill and Percy were seated together and his eldest brother seemed to be remembering something particularly entertaining as George observed a smile unlike anything from recent memory grace Percy’s face as he listened. His Parents were now wrapped about Charlie nearly as fiercely as they had been about George not long before, and though they smiled now, they smiled through their tears. Ron and Ginny had drifted away from the assembly and ever with them went Harry and Hermione. George felt a smile tug at his lips, they were all going to be ok.</p><p>“Hey!”</p><p>Startled from his reflections George focused back in on his immediate surroundings just in time to catch Angelina as she fit herself against his side and hugged him tightly to herself.</p><p>“He would’ve liked that I think.”</p><p>“I think so too,” George smiled affectionately. “Couldn’t have pulled it off without your help though, and yours Lee.”</p><p>“It was the send off he deserved. Don’t think he’d have liked to be remembered so conventionally as all that in there.” Lee’s words echoed George’s previous thoughts as he loosened his tie and continued, “So where’s everybody got to Ange? We can start his proper funeral now.”</p><p>“They should’ve all gotten down to the lake by now if Ollie had anything to say about it. I left him in charge of getting the gang down there, really we’re just waiting on you two ‘cause I doubt Harry will join us given his current situation,” here she nodded toward where Harry sat deep in conversation with Hermione as Ginny lay with her head in his lap, Ron seemed lost in thought as he sat by his friends,</p><p>“and we didn’t want to drag Charlie away from your mum.”</p><p>George nodded in understanding as he glanced back down to where his mother sat and his brother, seeming to feel eyes upon him looked up and caught his eye with a smirk, “I think he’ll know where to find us. Let’s join the others.”</p><p>So Angelina, George and Lee shuffled down past the crowd toward the lake where their friends awaited them. Oliver had managed to shepherd every quidditch player from the twins’ Hogwarts years down onto the banks of the lake where Charlie had once gathered them when Fred and George were in their first year. And now here they all were together Oliver Wood was stood arms crossed with his back to the lake very obviously in some kind of argument with Alicia Spinnet who had taken a much more relaxed stance and was in fact seated on the ground some space away with Katie Bell’s head resting in her lap as Alexander Knight passed her a bottle of firewhiskey before turning back to another girl who seemed to be rummaging in her purse before she withdrew another bottle and a large bag emblazoned with three bright orange Ws as well as another from Honeydukes sweet shop (obviously the purse had been charmed because otherwise George had no clue how one girl could’ve fit that much alcohol and sweets into such a small bag).</p><p>“Oliver relax! Puddlemere isn’t going to flip if you get a little sloshed at a funeral. That’s what potions are for. You’ll be fine for your trials tomorrow.”</p><p>Oliver’s stance relaxed only slightly eliciting a laugh from the girl still rummaging in her purse, “It’s nice to see ickle Ollie hasn’t changed.”</p><p>“You’ve been playing for them for 5 years Wood, one night of drunken revelry won’t make you any less their star player. Pass the sweets Lav, let’s see what Freddie boy prepared for his remembrance.”</p><p>Lavender Hopkirk tossed the Honeydukes bag to her friend and caught sight of George, Angelina and Lee making their way down to the water, “Oi you lot! Come to help us drink away our sorrows?”</p><p>“Count me in!” Lee responded affably as Lavender once more reached into her bag.</p><p>“Here Ollie, I might have some Butterbeer in here as well if that’d better suit your more delicate palette.” Turning towards the man in question she offered another bottle.</p><p>Oliver sighed heavily and accepted it with thanks before settling himself on the ground near Lee as Angie sat by Alicia tugging George after her.</p><p>“How’re ya holdin’ up Georgie?” Came the sleepy voice of Katie Bell from where she lay, eyes red-rimmed from crying, but the sparkle of mischief was yet present.</p><p>“I think I’m handling it.” He responded, taking the bottle of firewhiskey Alicia passed him and taking a long drink, relishing in the burn as it went down. “Honestly at this point it doesn’t feel real. More like it’s happening to someone else. Y’know?”</p><p>Xander nodded sagely as he drew several acid pops from the Honeydukes bag before passing it on to Lee, “I felt the same way after my mum passed. Not gonna be a pretty day when the reality catches up. Not that it’s pretty now…” he tacked on.</p><p>The silence that followed this statement seemed to draw them all in and time passed around them as they ruminated on the truth of the remark until finally Alicia seemed recognize the need for a change in tone and drew the Weasley Wizard Wheezes bag, which had been dumped in the middle of the circle of friends, closer to herself asking as she reached in,</p><p>“So are you going to tell me what any of these do before I try one Weasley?”</p><p>Startled from his reflection George grinned good-naturedly at his friend, “If I told what they did would you trust me?”</p><p>All of the treats within had been transfigured to look identical as part of a new package the twins had been developing which featured all of their edible tricks in one giant mystery bag. All their old tricks were included as well as several new ones and the effects were all set to wear off without any antidote. Included with the bag was a list of possible treats which read, Canary Creams, Creepy Crawlies, Otters Fizzing Juices (now in 3 varieties), Shimmering Silver Salt Drops, Sparking Sugared Raspberries, Sudsy Giggles, Ton-Tongue Toffee and Weasley’s Dragon Roasted Nuts.</p><p>With a half-hearted glare in George’s direction, Alicia bravely reached into the bag and withdrew one small treat eyeing it as if it were about spring from her hand and preform a jig. George laughed, “It’s not going to bite you ‘Licia, Fred and I would never be so cruel.”</p><p>“I’m only trying to see if I can guess which one it is!” she retorted before tossing it into her mouth and almost immediately letting out a shriek, “George Weasley! Make it stop!” Spitting out what was left of the treat she tried in vain to get the sensation of bugs crawling down her throat to cease.</p><p>Everyone laughed uproariously and nearly as suddenly as it began, it ended. Alicia was left several feet from where she had started, her normal self again (thinking for some reason that by moving from her position the feeling would stop), and Katie who had been unceremoniously pushed from her lap now lay laughing in the grass. So the bag was passed from one to another and they all took their turns as firewhiskey and butterbeer made the rounds as well, and Fred was with them in their laughter as they shared sweets and stories late into the afternoon on the shore of the lake.</p>
<hr/><p>Charlie had been home for just over a week and his little brother was dead. The truth of the statement left a dull ache in his chest as he remembered Fred as he had been growing up. George had made a point to honor Fred in a manner their brother would have appreciated and Charlie would’ve been lying if he said he hadn’t guessed that George had planned something. Before the service Lavender and Alex had approached him with their condolences and an offhanded remark that he should come down to the lake later if he was able. But now Charlie was left watching as George was led away down to the lake by his friends as he sat with his mother.<br/>
He sat with his parents for several hours at least as witches and wizards came forward to pay their respects, offering kind words that all seemed to fall flat as they did nothing to ease the pain of loss. Up to this point Molly had been handling things well considering all that had happened, but now as the flood of sympathy was poured out she grew frustrated and tears spilled over her face.</p><p>“Every single one of them has offered the same remarks! How they’re ‘so sorry for my loss’ and how they ‘feel my pain’. But they don’t! Not one of them can know what I’m feeling, and if one more person tells me how sorry they are I’m going to scream!”</p><p>Charlie opened his mouth to reply, not entirely sure when his father had disappeared from their side, but before any sound could come out he was interrupted by the sudden appearance of a tall, older witch, wearing a hat with an unusual stuffed bird perched atop it and carrying what looked to be a loaf of bread.</p><p>“Molly,” her voice seemed uncharacteristically kind when compared with her fearsome visage, “sometimes we reach a point where words mean nothing and all that is left is bread.” As she spoke she passed the loaf to Mrs. Weasley but said no more in explanation.</p><p>Molly stared at the loaf for a whole minute before looking into the woman’s face and breathing out, “Augusta, thank you.”<br/>
The depth of the emotion in this exchange went beyond all the shallow words Molly had heard over and over again ever since Fred had died; and as Charlie looked on two women who had lost their sons to the ravages of war were united and all that they had was bread.</p><p>“Charlie, why don’t you go check on your brother? I haven’t seen him since we left the castle.” Arthurs voice drifted out of nowhere and Charlie startled not having noticed his father’s return, “I think I can handle this.” Arthur gestured vaguely toward the two witches who were now hugging fiercely.</p><p>Charlie didn’t have to ask which brother his father referred to and so he made his way down to the banks of the lake where he had once gathered his rag-tag little team of quidditch players just after Fred and George had joined, the echoes of a memory ringing in his ears.</p><p>
  <em>“Now remember, you made the team because: of all the beaters who tried out you were the best pair and we need a team that can work together if we want any chance of beating Slytherin for the Quidditch cup! McGonagall’s been on me since my second year to pull out another win for our team. But don’t go thinking you’re going to get any special treatment just because you’re family. If anything I plan on pushing you harder because I know your weaknesses already, I’ve played against you enough times.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Aw, c’mon Charlie! See I only joined because I think I look dashing in the uniform. Ain’t that right Georgie?</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Not me Fred, I joined because I heard the girls love quidditch players.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Well that’s lucky isn’t it! ‘Cause here we are, two dashing quidditch players!”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Oh shove off!” Charlie groused ruffling Fred’s hair as he stepped ahead of them, “I told the rest of the team to meet us down here, there’s a nice clearing on the edge of the lake where I thought we could spend some time working out the season’s strategy.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“What d’you want to bet Wood’s already down there?” George grinned.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“I have two sickles that says he’s been there a half hour already.” Fred immediately responded.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Three.” Charlie called back, excited for the new season and the chance to play with his brothers.</em>
</p><p>Now, eight years later, as he rounded the bend that would lead him down to that same clearing a different feeling had filled his heart, a longing he likened to homesickness, similar to what he had first felt when he had left for Romania. He had missed his family then and he missed Fred now as he heard laughter bubbling up from the lakeside knowing he wouldn’t see Fred among his friends.</p><p>“Hey! It’s -hic- Charlie!” Lavender slurred, “How- how’re you doing c-captain?”</p><p>“Huh?” Oliver looked up from the chocolate frog he’d been poking at absentmindedly.</p><p>“Not you Ollie!” came the giggled reply of a blonde Charlie didn’t quite recognize who was sorting through a handful of Bertie Bott’s Beans, “Lav’s talking to your pre-prede-predecessssor.” stumbling over her final word she devolved into giggles again.</p><p>“Well that’s a triple word score if I ever heard one. I’m alright Lav.” Charlie smirked, stepping around Xander who had apparently fallen asleep, “Forgive me, I’ve been out of the country a while you’ll have to remind me of your name?” He posed the question to the blonde as he settled himself next to George who was laughingly relating a story to Lee, Alicia and Angelina about one of his and Fred’s forays into Filch’s office in their first year.</p><p>“’S Batie, Batie Kell.”</p><p>George looked up at that and laughed, “She means Katie Bell.”</p><p>“S’what I said!”</p><p>George rolled his eyes shaking his head as he went back to his story, obviously not as inebriated as his companions.</p><p>“Katie Bell,” Charlie mused to himself as if trying to place the name, “Well! If it isn’t Baby Kates! You were that freckled little thing that used to trail after Ollie weren’t you? Came to every game, even a couple of practices if I remember right.” Charlie smirked at the young woman who was obviously not eleven years old anymore, much less trailing after ‘Ollie’ who had gone back to poking his chocolate frog.</p><p>Katie wrinkled her nose at the thought, turning to look at Oliver as the chocolate began to melt in his palm, “Yeh well I ssure wised up once I realized how loony he is.” Katie swayed a bit where she sat, “‘sides, I only liked him cause he looked sso dashhing in his qui-quidditch uniform.”</p><p>Charlie chuckled then turned to his little brother, “You losing yourself tonight Georgie?”</p><p>“I haven’t decided yet, but I don’t think so. I don’t want to forget.”</p><p>“Me neither George. Me neither.”</p>
<hr/><p>Percy hadn’t spoken to his family for a long time. Percy hadn’t been there for a lot of things in their lives, he’d missed Bill’s wedding for Merlin’s sake! But Percy had been there when it happened. He saw the life drain out of his brother’s face, the ghost of a laugh on his lips, and Percy blamed himself. He’d been the one to distract Fred from the battle after all, if he hadn’t made that stupid crack at the minister’s expense - but no. He couldn’t allow himself to face the what-ifs of that day; he was losing enough sleep as it was.</p><p>
  <em>“You’re joking, Perce!” The light of flying spells illuminated the room around them and Percy recognized an admiration in his little brother’s eyes that he hadn’t seen in years. Fred had stopped fighting entirely by that point, turning fully to face Percy ignoring the haphazard spells being tossed about him.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“You actually are joking, Perce … I don’t think I’ve heard you joke since you were - ” The words died in his throat as an explosion had sounded around them, blasting them apart. Hands scrabbling for purchase, Percy tried to pull himself up off the floor only to see Fred wasn’t moving.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>He didn’t recognize the sound of his own voice as it was torn from him, “No - no - no! No! Fred! No!” And when he reached his brother’s side he gave up on coherence, shaking Fred by the shoulders, knowing it was in vain.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Just - I can’t - please! Don’t be dead. I’m sorry - never got to say - I wanted to tell you. No…” His voice had left him and he could not clearly see his brother’s face through the tears welling in his eyes. His brother was gone.</em>
</p><p>“You alright there Perce?”</p><p>Percy startled as a hand settled on his shoulder. Looking up into the face of his brother Percy let out a breath he hadn’t realized he’d been holding and wiped away a stray tear before answering Bill,</p><p>“I’m alright.”</p><p>“Good. Don’t get lost there Perce, it’s not an easy place to come back from.”</p><p>Percy had been staying at the burrow since the battle, back in his old room and once again among his family as they all tried to come to terms with their new reality; to say relationships were strained would’ve been an understatement. Percy had a lot to make up for, and he owned that fact but that didn’t change the choices he had made. Of all his family, Bill had been the one who had given him the most opportunity to atone for his actions over the course of the last few years, and as such the brothers had grown closer than they ever had been in their childhood.</p><p>As the oldest of the Weasley children Bill had always been a somewhat distant figure to his siblings, while he and Charlie had been quite close when they were little he was already nearing 6 years old by the time Percy was born, and that’s to say nothing of Ginny, Ron and even, on some level, the twins; and really what good is an infant to a 5 year old, or a toddler to a nine year old? Bill loved his siblings, he really did, but by the time Percy was old enough to actually be interesting Bill was off to Hogwarts and so they didn’t really get the chance to form any bond until Bill was 16 and Percy joined he and Charlie at school.</p><p>Percy often found himself wondering if his childhood would’ve been better had he and Bill been closer; because, of all his siblings Percy had the most in common with Bill. Both boys were of a level headed caliber that could only be attributed to their father, for though Molly was an intelligent witch she often allowed her passion to sway her decisions, and they valued the hard work it took to rise through the ranks. But where Bill was able to rise through the ranks of popularity as well as achievement Percy had never been a popular child, even among his own family. Perhaps if he had been closer to Bill things would’ve been different, he would’ve been different.</p><p>“Ah, there’s my beautiful wife. How’re you holding up?”</p><p>Fleur hummed noncommittally as she wrapped her arm around Bill’s waist and leaned in to press a kiss against his temple, brushing her fingers across a rather ghastly scar that marred his left cheek, “I am fine, though per’aps a little tired.”</p><p>Bill gave her shoulder a squeeze, “It’s been a long day.”</p><p>“A long war.” Percy chimed in with a sympathetic smile to his sister-in-law.</p><p>“This is all true. But it is nearly over.”</p><p>Percy wasn’t sure if she was referring to the day or the war but her words spoke such finality that he felt inclined to agree with her no matter the intended meaning.</p>
<hr/><p>Ron was tired, but here he was sat with his best friends; they, at least, had made it through the end of the world. Ginny was sprawled across the lawn, head pillowed in Harry’s lap as Harry and Hermione were quietly discussing their upcoming plans, funerals to attend and lives to rebuild. Hermione had mentioned the night before the possibility of returning to Hogwarts, Ron wasn’t sure that was what he wanted. He idly picked at the grass, then with one blade pinched between forefinger and thumb he began to trace patterns up and down Hermione’s arm.</p><p>“D’you reckon there’s an after life?” Ginny’s voice sliced through Harry and Hermione’s quiet conversation, startling Ron back into awareness.</p><p>“Well, scientifically speaking, there’s no way to prove either the presence or absence of such a state. I don’t know if I believe there is but I don’t disbelieve in that possibility either.” Hermione responded carefully after a brief pause of thought.</p><p>“There is.” Harry broke in, “I’ve been there. Well, nearly.”</p><p>A silence stretched on around them following Harry’s statement as none of them wanted to push the conversation further than Harry was willing to take it. Eventually however, Ginny seemed to grow tired of the quiet and rolled off of Harry’s lap, propping herself up so she could look him in the eyes,</p><p>“Do you think he’s ok?” Her intensity seemed to startle Harry somewhat but he was quick to respond.</p><p>“Yeah I - I think he’s ok.”</p><p>“Good.”</p><p>If Fred, even in death could be ok, Ron thought to himself with a sidelong glance at Hermione, then they were going to be alright.</p>
<hr/><p>Arthur sighed as they waved to the last few stragglers who were making their way to the apparation point. Their children scattered about the grounds, and an arm wrapped tightly around Molly’s shoulders they finally turned to face the castle behind them. This place had always meant something to them, as the place where they met and learned the beginnings of everything that they are. Now it would also be the place where their son had died and been buried.</p><p>Walking up to the great doors they were met by McGonagall who silently allowed them entry back into the hall which had long since cleared of any residual stench. Approaching the coffin in which his son lay Arthur was distinctly reminded of the last time he had done this at the funeral of Molly’s brothers Fabian and Gideon Prewitt. You see traditionally, the deceased's closest kin will bear them to their final resting place and so as Molly’s parents had already passed on they had led the funeral in which she buried her last living relatives, and now they were here to bury their son.</p><p>“Are you ready Mollywobbles?”</p><p>“Yes Arthur, I think I am.”</p><p>Together Mr. and Mrs. Weasley cast a levitation charm on the coffin in which Fred now lay and began the procession out the doors of the Great Hall and down into the cemetery that would be his final resting place at the edge of the protective wards surrounding their beloved Hogwarts. Behind them the doors were shut and locked as they continued on from that place alone.</p><p>Gently placing the coffin within the hole prepared to receive it, Molly shut her eyes against the bitter sting of tears that threatened now to overcome her and Arthur drew her to his side whispering meaningless soothing words to calm her. No parent should ever see their child buried before their time, but here they were standing at the final resting place of their son, taken just weeks after his 20th birthday, Fredrick Gideon Weasley.</p>
