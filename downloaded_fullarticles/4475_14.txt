<hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>“Dr. Wallingford’s newest discovery,” said the first witch. Her hat, decorated with a stuffed vulture, wavered spookily over the conversation. Her aging companion sighed over her champagne.</p><p>“It’s sure to be amazing. After his invention of the Sectumsempra Hex, just after the war, we all knew he was going to be something special..”</p><p>“Well,” a third witch said, “They <em>said</em> that hex was a dark spell, invented by a Death Eater - a dark wizard –“</p><p>“- he was cleared of all suspicion,” said the second witch. She sipped from her glass. “Years ago. Almost immediately.”</p><p>“Besides,” said a fourth member of the group, “There was barely <em>any</em> proof. Just some theoretics on blood purity, and he wrote that paper decades ago.”</p><p>“Who hasn’t entertained the idea, anyway?”</p><p>The witch in the vulture hat scowled and abruptly left. The remainder of the group subsided into silence.</p><p>--</p><p> “And now,” a beautiful witch on the stage announced, “The great Dr. Edward Wallingford’s presentation.”</p><p>Applause, somewhat muted near the back, filled the auditorium. The audience was dazzled by the stage lighting and impatient from the wait. The witch subsided into the shadowy background and the great man himself appeared. He stood, sweating, and launched into a speech.</p><p>“Ladies and gentlemen of the Greater London Charms Association…”</p><p>A weary settling ensued in the seating.</p><p>“..men and women of the Ministry of Magic..”</p><p>Fans started rustling in the crowd. A few more competent individuals whispered cooling charms.</p><p>“..I would like to extend my gratitude to the Board for allowing me this opportunity..”</p><p>The rest of the audience perspired. The vulture hatted witch mumbled, not quietly, <em>get on with it.</em></p><p>“..this spell is the product of lifelong study of magic, charms, and of arithmancy. It required the careful dissection, examination, and understanding of the charm <em>Prior Incantato.</em>”</p><p>The audience sensed a point being arrived at and perked up accordingly.</p><p>“..I present a charm that can reverse the effects of the spell most recently cast on an object.”</p><p>Renewed interest in the crowd. Whispers drifted from the seats. The esteemed doctor gestured to his pretty assistant.</p><p>“Observe,” he announced.</p><p>The witch raised her wand.</p><p>“Incendio!”</p><p>A fire immediately flared to life and burned, harmlessly, in the center of the stage. The audience shifted again, feeling as if it were watching a Muggle magical trick show. Edward Wallingford raised his wand. He opened his mouth. The watching members of the Greater London Charms Association waited expectantly.</p><p>He glanced up above himself and frowned.</p><p>A bolt of green light exploded from somewhere directly over the stage. The crowd started in shock as the doctor crumbled to the ground. His assistant shrieked.</p><p> </p><p> </p>
