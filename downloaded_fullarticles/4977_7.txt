    <hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>There were many things that Newt Scamander expected and didn’t expect in his rather short life. Among these expected things, he knew, were that magical creatures were predictable. Unlike people, they were easily read and therefore easier to empathise with. He never expected to end up as one though. He certainly expected it less that he would find someone just like him.</p><p> </p><p>Despite the difficulties of turning, it never really infringed much on his life. Except that it was now a lot easier – almost annoyingly so – to smell someone over the length of a quidditch pitch away. It made it very difficult not to be distracted by the distress of other omegas or the overwhelming stench of many alphas. It was, however, this ability that he was able to track down the original Percival Graves, and inadvertently someone of his own kind.</p><p> </p><p>Newt looked at the almost feral man before him and just knew. He had found one of his own, someone like him, and that gave him a sense of comfort he hadn’t realised he needed. As wonderful as it was to fulfil the unspoken need to protect and nurture through his creatures, his found family, there were times when he’d lie awake with an aching longing to have someone who understood what it was like.</p><p> </p><p>Keeping his eyes on the defensive alpha before him, Newt whispered a request to Tina to send for a healer. The alpha was reluctant to leave him but assured her that he would be fine, the less people the better. The less witnesses, the less likely either of them would be discovered. The moment she disapparated, Newt made himself as small and none threatening as possible. Trying as hard as he could to be understood, because even if Percival Graves lived his life as a man, in this moment he was nothing more than a cornered animal.</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>The alpha let out a low rumbling growl in warning as this new face approached him, their form curled inward and their head bowed submissively. The growling died off into a pained whine once he caught the scent of an omega. An omega who was trying to approach him, to comfort, to heal. An omega who was just like him. He stared intensely, warily, at the male – the wolf supplies – before him. He remains tense, ready to strike, to kill. Regardless of their dynamic. Regardless of the fact that this man is a wolf, just like him.</p><p> </p><p>The fear ladled thoughts calm from a painful staccato to a low hum in his skull as he observes the male crouched in front of him. Observing, releasing a calming scent, and inching ever closer. He’s so distracted by the calming smell of pine, spice, the subtle smell of an unknown flower, by the prettiness of this omega, that he hadn’t realised he’s being embraced in a loose hold.  A hug, the decidedly more human part of him supplies weakly.</p><p> </p><p>He remains rigidly still, teeth bared and ready to bite the clothed shoulder in case of one misstep. The time and silence reign for minutes, weeks, years… He isn’t quite so sure anymore. He is, however, sure enough that the danger has mostly passed and relaxes his weary body. He buries his face in the crook of the male’s neck and breathes in. He’s subconsciously moved his arms to wrap around the slender body holding him, keeping the warmth firmly in place. He remains as he is, if only to breathe in that calming scent for as long as he can.</p><p> </p><p>He barely registers the whispery ghost of words in his ear. Phrases of ‘you’re alright’, ‘I’ve got you, mister Graves.’ Graves? Is that his name? A flash of a memory, yes, that’s right. Percival Graves. The human part of him is becoming more coherent, but he’s feeling rather drunk off the scent and the gentle touch he’s not experienced in a long time. He mumbled distractedly, ‘are you an angel?’ The man laughed softly, he could feel them get a little warmer around the neck. Graves doesn’t really register much after that. He ends up lulling into a rather comfortable state. Dozing, drifting into the place between a lazy doze and deep sleep. Despite the slight anxiety that he feels from being plunged into this sleepy darkness once again, he feels content.</p><p> </p>
