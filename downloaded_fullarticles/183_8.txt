    <p>
  <span>“Oh, Edward.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Edward swallowed on a dry throat and licked his chapped lips as he peered down at the two men below him. Ah Tabai and… Harry, the man who had served as a brief cook on the Jackdaw. Harry’s green eyes were dark but soft, his arms at his sides. Harry’s skin was paler than Edward had ever seen, a tinge of green to him that Edward didn’t know what to make of.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A gust of wind blew through him and he shuddered, his body trembling and shuddering. He was naked, had been since yesterday and Edward… was exhausted and thirsty and hungry and his back was a mess of heat.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Let’s get you down from there,” Harry whispered, making a motion with his hands. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The gibbet shook and he shuddered again, deeper, and a sound left his throat that made Harry flinch. “Easy, easy. ‘M not going to drop you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Harry.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I mean no offense, mentor, but this is torture,” Harry hissed, turning to look at the Mentor of the Brotherhood. “And also… I’m not one of your people. I refuse to leave Edward in this… cage even if he doesn’t want to help you get the women out.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ah Tabai stared at Harry even as clouds gathered in the sky above them. “Very well.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Edward… how long have they had you…” Harry gestured up at the gibbet even as something carried it down to the ground.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“...Don’t know,” Edward croaked out, leaning against the cold metal of the bars. “Water… I need... </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Alright. Hold on,” Harry said, his eyes narrowed and then he spoke words under his breath that Ah Tabai didn’t hear. “I’ve got some water, just hold tight.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Edward whimpered as the bars around him wore torn down and back, leaving him nothing to fall against. Arms came around him and a strangled shout tore itself from his throat as Harry tugged him close.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ve got you. You’re safe,” Harry said, pulling Edward closer. “You’re free.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He shut his eyes and burrowed into the man’s arms, his heart thumping. A cloak lowered itself down to his shoulders and he cried out as it touched… the skin on his back.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Shhh,” Harry whispered, holding him even as Edward’s knees buckled, pain echoing through his body. Edward fell and Harry lowered them both down, holding him loosely, smoothing his fingers lightly over his back. “Shhh. I’ve got you. Here, Edward, water.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He took a breath and turned to look at the strange cup Harry was holding, the one that had a… thing sticking out of it. He tried to reach out for it only for his arms to drop prematurely, shaking and exhausted as he was.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You don’t need to move. Just suck on the straw. You’ll get water that way,” Harry remarked quietly, pressing a kiss to his forehead. Edward shuddered at the affection and turned his head away, leaning against Harry’s shoulder.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Straw.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The thing sticking out of the cup. You’re exhausted, Edward. Not to mention badly injured,” Harry muttered, turning his head elsewhere. “The fuck did Roberts stab you with that is only now finished healing?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Kenway, I need your help in freeing the women,” Ah Tabai finally spoke, his voice soft.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Edward glanced up at the other man before turning to look at the cup and took a sip out of the strange looking thing and let out a loud sigh of contentment. The water was cold and felt wonderful on his throat and his mouth and… Energy surged through him and he had a feeling that Harry had put something else into that drink though he didn’t know what.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I will help you free Anne and Mary,” Harry argued, holding the cup for Edward with one hand and with the other, curling up Edward’s back to cradle his neck. “Leave Edward to rest for a while.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Edward muttered, glancing to Ah Tabai, his eyes narrowing. “I’ll help. Mary and Anne are friends.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Edward took a deep breath and pulled back, out of Harry’s arms. Harry stared at him, his green eyes flashing briefly in the moonlight, and then nodded. “You come straight to me afterward though. Your back needs seeing to. And you know what, your… everything else needs tending to too.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Will you stay here?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Right here, Edward Kenway. I promise,” Harry replied, reaching out to brush some of Edward’s hair out of his face. Edward stared at Harry and blinked, his cheeks reddening faintly. “You could have called for me. I would have come.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Just call for Death and I will come.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Edward stared at Harry and Harry stared back, the scar on his forehead drawing Edward’s gaze for a moment. “Death.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes. Now go.”</span>
