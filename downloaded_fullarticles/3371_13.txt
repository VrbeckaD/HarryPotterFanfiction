  <em>Say love and death</em>

  <em>In the same breath</em>

  <em>(I dare you)</em>
</p><p align="center"> </p><p>Harry James Potter, the Boy Who Lived not once but <em>twice</em>, the one who had defeated the Dark Lord, and now the Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement was inexplicably but undeniably, bored.</p><p> </p><p>By the by, things were well for Harry. For what he’d achieved in his lifetime, he really shouldn’t be one to complain.</p><p>Except, he was tired, he felt tired all the time. Well maybe not as much tired as… bored. Just completely bored out of his mind.</p><p>It’s been exactly twenty years since the Battle of Hogwarts had taken place.</p><p>Ten of those years Harry had spend catching all the Death Eaters who were foolish enough to have willingly or unwillingly sided with Lord Voldemort, before the whole dumping lot in Azkaban. Even more years had passed since any Dark Magic had been practiced on the streets, and a few more since the term ‘Mudblood’ was spoken carelessly.</p><p>The Ministry had not been as kind this time round now that they had full knowledge that <em>He Who Must Not Be Named </em>was well and truly gone from Merlin’s green earth.</p><p>This time, in the aftermath of the Second Wizarding War, no one could hide their political affiliations and it became exceedingly clear who was to be rewarded, and who was to be punished.</p><p>The <em>Anti-Dementors Act </em>took a bit longer, and definitely did not come into effect before all known Death Eaters had been given the literal kiss of death. Sadly, as Hermione explained to him, the penal code was only passed due to purely perfunctory materialism more than an ethical pursuit of any kind. With the influx of prisoners in Azkaban, the Ministry needed an acceptable method of, in Ron’s words, ‘<em>pegging em’ out</em>’. And the kiss was the fastest way available.</p><p>The dementors were released back into the wild however, when it became apparent that some of the prisoners deserved a fate worse than death.<br/> Harry was almost sad to see them go after quickly learning that humans were by far more brutal and more creative in their torture of others.</p><p> </p><p>Kingsley, amidst all the pandemonium, was unanimously elected as Minister and then unanimously reinstated again for every term after that.<br/> It was clear to everyone concerned that the position henceforth would be passed onto whoever had fought on Dumbledore’s side during the war and Harry wouldn’t be surprised that if <em>he </em>had elected himself, the motion would have been carried without a quorum.<br/> Never mind that he was a school dropout or had no credentials whatsoever. </p><p>Nonetheless, Minister Shacklebolt’s campaign was smooth sailing, especially with the very bloody and not to mention messy deaths of the previous two ministers. Oh there were definitely opposing candidates all right, opportunistic vultures who had been waiting for the ball to drop before swooping in.<br/> But they could all somehow or another be traced back to the Dark Lord in one way or another.</p><p>Harry would never know how Shacklebolt managed to find these connections and even if he did, he wouldn’t tell anyone. Seeing as Harry was the Head Auror at the time and most of the incriminating evidence happened to be from his sources.</p><p>Either way, the issue of most urgency now was to soothe the immediate demand for reform. The Wizarding masses had been quiet after the first war, living in fear of the Dark Lord’s wrath. Now that he was gone and children had been murdered in his wake, they were suddenly very interested in politics and made their interest known in very loud and very angry ways. <br/> That was why the Death Eaters had to be the first to go, having been protected for so long by their pure blood status and landed gentry.</p><p>Now that these things held no meaning to anyone and Dementors had been released into their old hiding places, they had nowhere else to go but Azkaban.</p><p> </p><p>It was almost too easy after that.</p><p>The remaining members of the Order quickly rose to power; Harry and Ron joined the Aurors without even graduating Hogwarts. They were technically dropouts at this point, but no one had even bothered to raise an eyebrow in question. After six years of schooling, Harry had quite enough of studying thankyouverymuch. But without a clue of what to do in the future he had accepted the Ministry’s internship.</p><p>He’d been a hot mess back then, trying to pick up whatever pieces of the life he had left.</p><p>Anything was better than going back to Hogwarts, being reminded everyday of the blood on his hands, the lives he’d destroyed.</p><p>The internship was almost a healthy distraction. This was, of course before he realised that the position was mostly perfunctory.</p><p>His first year in office was nothing but mountains upon mountains of paperwork, accumulating on his desk like toy blocks since his first day on the job. He soon learnt that it was the Ministry’s way of an apology and an expression of gratitude rolled into one i.e. <em>sorry-we-never believed-in-Dumbledore </em>as well as <em>thank-you-for-saving-us-though-we-were-completely-useless</em>.</p><p>The administrative duties only increased after he had passed the first year ‘probation’. Which made sense, considering the mysterious deaths and disappearances of many a Death Eater.</p><p>He had barely got called to the field since then.</p><p>There was no one left to carry out the Dark Lord’s deeds, and no one stupid enough to try again.</p><p> </p><p>In lieu of recent events, the public had now moved onto very vocal protests of discrimination between purebloods and Muggle-borns. Hermione had swooped in for the kill, rising as an ambassador of public opinion and swearing up and down that she would take it upon herself to tear down the proverbial walls of prejudice. </p><p>Harry had been there that day, standing directly beside her for the entirety of the press conference. It was clear that his presence had made some kind of difference and if Harry was even a little more pessimistic, he would have felt a little like a puppet on strings.</p><p>Seven more years had flown by just like that. Other than the occasional state visit and public announcement, he was hardly called upon anymore.</p><p>Which was perfectly fine with Harry. It gave him more time, time and energy to build the family he’d always wanted.</p><p>To be the father he’d always wanted to be, the father that his own father would have wanted for him to be, but could never be himself. </p><p> </p><p>He remembers the day that he brought home his firstborn like it was just yesterday.</p><p>Ginny had been in labour for fourteen straight hours and Harry was beside himself with worry. For those fourteen nail-biting hours, the nightmares he’d repressed his whole life managed to escape through the cracks of his compartmentalised mind, roaming freely up and down the hospital corridor where he sat, head cradled in his hands.</p><p>His earliest memories are of the cupboard, where he had never felt lonely or abandoned.</p><p>Because those were words for people who felt anything else while growing up.</p><p>He thanks Merlin that none of his children will ever truly know them.</p><p>Then he thinks of <em>him</em>, or at least the him he’d seen in Dumbledore’s memories. Just as equally lonely and abandoned in that orphanage as he himself had been, locked up in that cupboard.</p><p>Perhaps even more so. </p><p>Hours later, and with a fierce resounding cry, his son was born. Unshed tears are in his eyes even before he lays them upon his tired wife and their beautiful new baby. He leans over to see Baby James resting peacefully in her arms, a pink face peeking out from under her breast, bundled together by a mess of cloth and <em>—</em><em>oh, so beautiful </em>but it’s only when tiny cotton fingers stretch out and  wraps them in one of his own <em>—</em><em>oh so soft, so soft </em>that he breaks down into a full sob.</p><p><em>"You will be so loved, you will be so loved, I promise you.” </em>He whispered as he held his son for the first time.</p><p>The words ‘<em>unlike me’</em> die in this throat.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p align="center">
  <strong>1st September 2018</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>It’s been fourteen more years after that and James is now a mere reflection in the mirror, barely a head shorter than Harry and eager for independence. </p><p> </p><p>Harry knows that his son will be fine walking his own path, if only to set himself apart from his father. James had gone ahead to Hogwarts, determined to avoid the stubborn tears that undoubtedly threatened to run down his father’s cheeks. <em>Every damn year</em>.</p><p>He stood on the edge of Platform Nine and Three Quarters alongside the rest of his family. He look over to Ginny, who was fussing over Lily before turning his attention back to Albus, who was shuffling his backpack from side to side, looking around nervously as if he was ready to bolt at any moment. Harry watched with concern as his son's inattentiveness when from the corner of his eyes, he sees a girl with chocolate brown locks waving enthusiastically at them from further down the track.</p><p>At first Harry thinks it’s for him, and he’s tempted to wave back until he catches the look on his son’s face.</p><p>Albus is red from the neck up, even the tips of his ears are glowing pink.</p><p><em>Oh, </em>he thinks. <em>Oh. </em><em>It’s finally happening then</em>.</p><p>As much as he knew that this day would come, he’d dreaded it like the plague. </p><p>Back in his youth, Harry hardly had time to entertain such ghastly terms like '<em>eye candy'</em> or '<em>puppy love' </em>except for his short-lived crush on Cho which had ended in such epic proportions of tragedy that he had nearly forgotten about it. And after Ron's unfortunate encounter with the love potion, he had solemnly sworn off all adolescent romances.<br/> He was lucky to have Ginny by his side, and even luckier when she’d agreed to be by his.</p><p>Now that his <em>own </em>children were at <em>that </em>age, all he feels is apprehension. On the day that Lily ever got married, he’s afraid he’ll combust. Either that, or inflate everyone in his immediate vicinity. But ever since way back then, he’d already decided he would support his children in any way he could, and clearly this was no exception. </p><p> </p><p>She was definitely pretty though, even from afar.</p><p>Behind the girl stood two adults whom Harry assumed were her parents.</p><p>Without hesitation, he ushered his son over to them.</p><p>“Dad…” Albus protested but it was too late.</p><p>“How do you do?” Harry asked, smiling. He tilted his head slyly to the side, parting his bangs just slightly to flash the faint remnants of an indented lightning bolt seared onto his forehead.</p><p>“Are you perhaps..?” the woman starts, “Harry Potter, <em>the </em>Harry Potter?” the male finished.</p><p>“The one and only.” His lips curl to reveal pearly white teeth. A round of laughter erupted as Harry knew it would.</p><p>The pair hastened to introduce themselves.</p><p>“I’m Chris, Chris Argent and this is my daughter Allison, say hello Allison.”</p><p>“Hi!” the girl chirps out.</p><p><em>She’s even prettier in person</em>, Harry though to himself, he hoped his son wasn't be the first in a long line of heartbreaks.</p><p>The name Argent is familiar to his ears for some reason, though he can’t quite place it. There’s a nagging feeling at the back of his mind, like he’d forgotten something very important but couldn't quite place. Perhaps it would be wise to run their profiles when he returns to his department, if only to assuage his own paranoia.<em> </em></p><p>Harry frowned but Chris continued, snapping him out of his reverie, “And this is my sister-“</p><p>“Kate. Kate Argent.”</p><p>She extended her hand and he took it with a firm grip.</p><p>“We’ve heard plenty of things about you Mr Potter, and coming from a muggle family, that truly says a lot.” She smiled at him, bright blonde hair a beacon in the swampy masses.</p><p>For some reason Harry is suddenly reminded of Aunt Petunia though he can't understand why. Then the moment passes and Chris is smiling at him nervously.</p><p>“We’re a muggle family through and through, Allison’s the first to attend Hogwarts, much to our surprise. As a parent, I must say it’s all rather nerve-wrecking.”</p><p>“Indeed.” Harry supplied easily, “More so for our children than it is for us, entering a new and completely different world.” He paused, letting the thought sink in,</p><p>“Hopefully they’ll find friends along the way, to make the journey a bit more bearable.”</p><p>He winked, “Between you and me, its the only way I survived.”</p><p>With one smooth motion, he pushed Albus towards the Allison, who remained smiling and friendly. In direct contrast to his son, who was looking more and more like a gargoyle with every passing second; a very immobile and perpetually frowning gargoyle.</p><p>“This is Albus, my younger son,” Harry urged again “I’m sure he’ll be more than obliging to accompany Allison on the train ride, won't you Albus?”</p><p>It’s not a rhetorical question but Albus remained unresponsive by his side. Just a beat before thing devolved into something truly awkward, Albus spoke, red-faced and gutted, as if even the effort to open his mouth pained him.</p><p>“C’mon Allison” he spit out, voice cracking at the effort. Then he was off, stomping way in poorly disguised anger. Allison, bless her heart, had the good sense to smile shyly between the adults before she trailed behind Albus.</p><p>“Excuse me.” Harry kept the smile plastered on his face as he caught up to his son, who was helping Allison tuck her luggage into the back of the carriage.</p><p>"Thank you Albus, I’ll head in first and look for a seat for us.’ Allison piped curtly before disappearing onto the train. </p><p>Harry had no doubt in his mind that Allison was as smart as she was pretty, the girl had more tact than Hermione and Ron combined. She reminded him strongly of Hermione but without all the snark. If nothing else came from this, it was at least good to know that his son had taste.</p><p>“Albus,’ Harry tried again when his son continued to ignore him.</p><p>The third time is almost a hiss, a voice he reserves almost exclusively for misbehaviour, “Albus Severus Potter! You’re not leaving this platform until you look at me.”</p><p>Reluctantly, his son turned to face him but his eyes remained cast down on the ground. He could hear the wheezing spit of the train, black wheels roaring into life beside them.</p><p>“That was rude, even for you. I was just trying to help, you wouldn’t believe how long me and your mother-“</p><p>"Dad." His son’s voice barely registered as a whisper.</p><p>The locomotive was spewing angry black smoke into their faces earnestly now, wheels churning faster and faster in their urgency.</p><p>“Just back off!’</p><p>The words were almost drowned out by the shrill whistle, but Harry heard them ringing in his head loud and clear.</p><p>As soon as he said it, Albus’ face was immediately struck by remorse. But he had the eye of someone too angry to care. </p><p>A black blur shoved past Harry as Albus chased down the side of the train before hauling himself onto the carriage and disappearing completely out of sight.</p><p>He watched with a sinking heart as the train departed from the platform, an angry hissing snake slithering away into the dense coverage of rolling hills ahead.</p><p>“Now you’ve done it.”</p><p>It's Ginny’s. She’s beside him in an instant, running one hand soothingly up and down his arm while the other was wrapped tightly around Lily. Their baby girl was sound asleep, blissfully unaware of all the drama that had unfolded within the span of a few minutes.</p><p>In response, Harry groaned. He knows she's right. </p><p> </p><p>He had done it now.</p><p> </p><p align="center">===</p><p> </p><p>That night, Harry excused himself from the dinner table and retired to bed early. It's hours later however, and he’s still tossing and turning.</p><p>With two of his children gone, the house was eerily quiet.</p><p> </p><p>After they got married, Ginny and him had had decided to move to a small apartment in London; where the traffic was terrible and the people were even worse. But it was closer to the Ministry and after living in the Burrow for so long, she had decided that a smaller house was what they wanted and Harry had been wise not to argue.</p><p>Now however, Harry stared absently at the ceiling in their tiny bedroom. The place felt entirely too large, too empty and he gets the insane urge to tear off all the flowery wallpaper. He could hear Ron laughing at him in his mind's eye, <em>Bonkers Harry. You’re completely bonkers! </em>And for a moment, Harry thinks he might be.</p><p>By now, the lure of being a father should have dulled; the countless diaper changes, the mountain of daily laundry, the soul-sapping realisation that babies woke at ungodly hours in the night only to refuse to be woken at appropriate times of the day, the bone-deep tiredness at the end of a work week that not even magic could soothe away.</p><p>But it doesn’t.</p><p>It just makes him want to do it all over again. If not for Ginny’s ‘Stop at Three’ policy, Harry would have wanted ten kids and then adopted two more.</p><p>When Rose and Albus had left for Hogwarts in their first year, the parents had planned a little getaway of their own, and by getaway he meant a last minute dinner and a desperate scramble to find babysitters for Hugo and Lily.</p><p>The restaurant was nice at least, and watching his oldest friends shove each other around in their own unique brand of affection had made Harry feel like himself again.</p><p> </p><p>Beside him, Ginny was on her fifth glass of Dom Pérignon, looking younger and more-light hearted than she’d felt for a long while.<br/> They laughed and they talked and before long 10PM had rolled around. Ten more minutes later, and the maitre d' was throwing them a stink eye from across the room. When the man asked for the last time if they had any last orders, they knew it was time to go. Harry paid and left a huge tip in apology before the entourage stumbled blindly out of the restaurant and into the cold night air.</p><p>After he had tucked a still giggling Ginny into bed, smoothed out her hair and placed a lasting kiss on her forehead, he went down to the kitchen and poured himself a whiskey.</p><p>He sat alone in the empty living room, wallowing in the silence. Lily was at the Burrow with Hugo and they had to pick her up tomorrow before driving her to get her haircut appointment. After that, pay the bills, send their letters to James and Albus, and there was still some more work from the Ministry sitting precariously on his study table, that had to be cleared over the weekend. He made another mental checklist of all the other things he had to do for the rest of the week before pushing them out of his mind.</p><p>It's then that the emptiness hits him like a ton of bricks.</p><p>His whole life he’d been different. Even in Hogwarts, he was always isolated in one way or another. As a grownup, it surprises him that he still feels so insecure.</p><p>While the rest were happy for their children and even happier that they were finally going to get some well deserved alone time of their own, all Harry wanted to do was to gather the three of them in his arms again and never let go. They were gone for barely half a day and he missed them terribly, he wanted them to come back home this instant, back to the home where they belonged.</p><p>He can feel the truth surfacing, the ugly thing usually settled low in his stomach but now it was bubbling up his throat, pushing desperately between his lips. They were truths he didn't want to admit unless under pain of death. He tried hard to repress them but like cockroaches they crawled all over the blank space of his mind and chipped away at his sanity, reminded him of the despair, the guilt and the loss.</p><p>When they were born, for the very first time in his life, Harry knew he belonged.</p><p>He knew instinctively, what they’d wanted and what they’d needed and despite the endless arguments and sibling rivalries, found a compromise to keep them content. They were an extension of his body, they knew him just as much as he knew them. Nurturing them into maturity was the highlight of his fatherhood, watching them fall and stumble only to help them back up again, exemplifying his core values as they followed in his footsteps, it felt like a crooked screw was finally twisting into place.</p><p>Compared to the neglect in his childhood, Harry knew he did not deserve them and could never give them enough of what they deserved, no matter how much he tried.</p><p>Because he wasn’t like the rest of them, was he? Unlike Ron or Hermione or even Ginny, Harry was broken in a way that could never be fixed. It didn’t matter that they were ridiculously rich and he would spoil them on many occasions. It didn’t matter that the Potter fame would mean that they will never fall short on friends. It didn’t even matter if they attended Hogwarts or not, since he could supply them with jobs in the Ministry when they got older.</p><p>It’s selfish and it's unhealthy, but Harry doesn’t care. He had won the war indefinitely, Voldemort was dead and the streets were safe from Death Eaters, no one had any reason to be afraid anymore.</p><p>But see, Harry couldn't help but think that fear had a funny way of worming its way in. Slowly, steadily and then all once, the war had made him hard. He never let’s it show at home but he knows evil has taken root in his heart and everyday is a struggle to keep it at bay.</p><p>Working as an Auror had only served to enhance these fears. Everyday he’s faced with real life examples of human corruption; politicians pulling in favours, financiers turning a blind eye to budget cuts, and Harry himself, working day in and day out at solutions that only seem to cause more problems.</p><p>He sighed heavily and took another swig of his whiskey, the clinking of ice the only audible sound in the room.</p><p> </p><p>It’s two years later now and the heavy darkness has only doubled in volume.</p><p>Without his children beside him, he felt torn, once again misplaced in the grand scheme of things. He had a feeling that Ginny knew this. If the worried glances and constant touches of reassurance were any indication. He appreciates her love in a way that only married couples do, but it’s not enough.</p><p>And he fears that it will never be.</p><p>Very soon, the Hogwarts Express will carry the last of his children into a world of adolescence; full of magic, and friends and wild adventures and, Merlin forbid, <em>Boys</em>. </p><p>His little baby girl having a… a… he can’t even say it, the word is too vile and disgusting. Yet Harry could never hope to compete with <em>that, </em>and the thought causes a chill to run straight through his bones.</p><p><em>Fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself Harry, don't you remember? </em>An ancient voice echoed in his mind and he misses it, misses <em>him</em> and his infinite wisdom, needing him now more than ever in this hour of weakness.</p><p> </p><p>His job at the Ministry was a scam, his children were slowly but surely leaving him behind and there was nothing Ginny could do to ease the loneliness.</p><p>He vaguely wondered if this was what a mid-life crisis felt like. He deliberated, but then dismissed the thought.</p><p>Of all the crises he’s endured, this was but a bump in the road called life. He tried not to blame his stunted youth for everything, but it’s hard not to when such a large part of it had been eaten away by vigilante justice to overthrow an undefeatable foe of darkness, especially now that he was a disposable entry level employee at the very organization he’d sworn should never have existed.</p><p> </p><p>Suffice to say, he was bored.</p><p> </p><p>Not just bored, the word barely covered the bases. He wasn’t just bored, he was jaded. Bloody jaded.</p><p>He groaned into the pillow in protest. The memory of Albus and his face contorted in anger assaulted the darkness and Harry let in a shaky breath. </p><p>Ginny walked into their bedroom mere minutes after his epiphany, having finally soothed Lily back to sleep. She picked up a book from the nightstand on her side of the bed and tossed it at his face. He looked at the title curiously, sitting up and lifting a questioning eyebrow at her.</p><p>‘<em>Raising Happy Children For DUMMIES</em>’ read the obnoxious yellow title.</p><p>She rolled her eyes at him playfully and said, ’Chapter 6 Harry’. </p><p>He flipped deftly to the index page and thumbed down the list slowly, not liking where this was going. With a wave of his hands, the book opened at the appropriate page and he stared blankly at the heading.</p><p>‘Break Free of the Overparenting Trap!’ read the large bold font at the top of the page, then on the next line ‘<em>(Or Risk Their Social-Emotional Wellbeing)</em>’.</p><p>Harry groaned quietly. </p><p>Ginny put her arms over his fondly but her voice was firm.</p><p>“You have to fix it.”</p><p>Harry groaned again, a little louder this time. Okay, a lot louder. </p><p>He groaned one last time for good measure because as usual, she was right.</p><p> </p><p>He had to fix it.</p><p>  </p><hr/><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">
  <strong>22nd April 2019 </strong>
</p><p> </p><p>So by fixing it, Harry mused, he needed to tackle the problem head on.</p><p>He mostly blames the Gryffindor side of things for the following series of events. Because when all things are said and done, bravery is synonymous to recklessness and though its saved his hiney on more than one occasion, it had also landed him in more trouble than he could afford.</p><p> </p><p>Which is how he found himself face to face with Professor Mcgonagall or should he say, Headmistress Mcgonagall on a crisp and lovely April afternoon. </p><p>Age had been kind to her, Harry observed absently, he wouldn’t be at all surprised if Mcgonagall was in fact, immortal. The woman didn’t look a day older since he was here, he tells her so.</p><p>“Dispense with the niceties Potter, and tell me why you’re really here.” she instructed, eyes narrowing in suspicion. </p><p>So the idea of buttering her up was immediately thrown out the window, Harry thought wryly. Her personality hadn’t changed a bit either, just as strict as ever. Maybe even more so.</p><p> </p><p>“Are you honestly telling me you wish to work here? <em>You</em>, of all people?”</p><p>He wet his lips in hesitation, he’d practiced this speech a thousand times with Hermione but that still doesn't stop the hammering in his chest.</p><p>“In the aftermath of the second war...” he started out carefully. Mcgonagall was still watching him in that creepy cat-like way of hers and he schooled his face into one of blank partiality, forcing his voice to remain calm before continuing.</p><p>“The Ministry of Magic has instated several defensive measures in order to avoid unfortunate reoccurrences of past misgivings. It is imperative that the focal point now be shifted to mitigate tensions and prejudices of pure bloods and Muggle-borns.”</p><p>“To do so, new integration strategies must override current levels of assimilation.” He laced his fingers, trying his best to remember Hermione’s script, “One of the measures approved by the Ministry is to inculcate a sense of togetherness amongst our youth. To nurture a love for diversity and tolerance, if you will.” </p><p>He swallowed, “I would like to formerly congratulate Hogwarts in this endeavour. A true honour it is to be one of the first for this broad-based transformative policy experiment.”</p><p>He prattled on, “It has also been brought to our attention that some Hogwarts students face in-house and level wide bullying in lieu of tensions between blood statuses, which has long been an issue of concern in this school. Deputy Minister Ms Hermione Granger has expressed extreme concern with regards to this matter, and hopes to pitch this policy as her campaigning platform next year."</p><p>"Therefore this Four-Strand Integration Policy Plan,” he pointed to the thick stack of papers on the desk, “hopes to promote inter-house harmony in the long term. Successful implementation will require quality indicators and regular feedback to the Ministry. My position here is merely to oversee these proceeding, and assist you in any way I can.”</p><p>Mcgonagall eyed him warily before springing for a retort, to which Harry ignored.</p><p>“Need I remain you Headmistress Mcgonagall, that one of the people who had aided in this road to serfdom was a former student here in Hogwarts.” he continued idly.</p><p> </p><p>It’s Seamus who speaks next, having been silent behind him all this time, “A less than innocent boy who was forced to make some very difficult decisions. Ones that would have ultimately led to the destruction of the entire Wizarding world if the Dark Lord had his way.”</p><p>“A boy who remains unpunished thanks to the statute of limitations, and walked away a free man.” Dean finished. He’s perched at the door of the office, no doubt recasting the Imperturbable charm.</p><p>“If someone, anyone, had not been so afraid of speaking up against him and his family, maybe more children could have been saved that day, Professor. This is ultimately why Hogwarts has need of an overseer, a guidance counsellor if you will. And it is precisely for this reason that I am here before you.” Harry finished.</p><p>He swallowed thickly, he hated using this argument but by far its been the most effective.</p><p>Harry chanced a look at the headmistress from his position behind a pillar.</p><p>Minerva stared at nothing, the colour of her face had faded into a new shade of pale.</p><p>Harry bit his lip to stop the apology from tumbling out, he was so close, he could <em>feel </em>it. </p><p> </p><p>He stood up abruptly and swept across the room. He had learnt, very early on, that the action was a form of passive aggression in the adult world. He had seen Kingsley use it on numerous occasions when council members felt the need to debauch every pro-muggle incentive that was suggested to the legislation. </p><p>If Harry’s learnt one thing over the years, was that the Ministry hated change; hated it so much that it would rather be destroyed by the laws it governed, than to destroy the laws themselves. He knows that she knows this as well as he does, and he also knows how to use it exactly to his advantage.</p><p>“We’ve made many changes Minerva, you may not believe it, I sometimes don’t either, but change is coming. With Hermione campaigning for the Minster’s seat, it's just a matter of time before she’ll be able to make things better, permanently. You know this as well as I do.”</p><p>“But change can’t only happen in the Ministry, we both know how easily they crumble when real danger is afoot.” He turned to face her, “We’ve got to start with our young, remove the prejudice indoctrinated by their families, nurture and expose them to diversity in a safe and conducive environment.”</p><p>“Do not let hatred taunt their minds, twist their perceptions. Do not let fear build higher than these castle walls could ever hope to protect them.” He warned. </p><p> </p><p>He tried to inject some truth in his words but these things always seemed to be blatant lies. Hogwarts had granted him reprise from the world yes, but it had never protected him from danger.</p><p>It's only in the arms of his children that he had ever felt safe and secure, but of course he doesn’t mention this.</p><p>“I’m afraid the Ministry has already made its decision. My being here is a mere courtesy call to you, on account of my respect Professor. Nonetheless, the Department of Magical Law Enforcement is here under strict orders from the Ministry, we will require your insignia and signature on these documents. When the new business has been concluded, motion will be carried forward. Acting-Minister Mr Shacklebolt and Deputy Head Ms. Granger will require your presence by noon tomorrow, along with these progress reports.”</p><p>Mcgonagall stood abruptly and Harry blinked slowly to calm himself.</p><p>Everyone knew that <em>he</em> was the Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement and she was smart enough to know that this entire scheme was basically one of his <em>I’m-up-to-no-good-but-you-can’t-stop-me </em>hijinks.  Which Harry really can’t deny, since the ulterior motive was to spend more time with his children.</p><p>You can’t blame a father for trying though, Daddy knows best after all.</p><p> </p><p>For a moment he thinks Mcgonagall was for sure gonna call him out on his bullshit, she’d done it before and she’ll probably do it again. The hairs at the back of his neck prick involuntarily and…</p><p>Mcgonagall just stared at him like he’d grown horns on his head and sprouted flowers from his nostrils. She took off her reading glasses and let out an audible sigh.</p><p> </p><p>Harry can see the definitive signs of age now that he looked closely. The soft tufts of grey hair behind her ears, the low arch of her back, the slight tremble when she flexed her fingers.</p><p> </p><p>“Motion has been seconded. Curriculum changes will be taken into account effective immediately.” she said after much deliberation.</p><p>He nodded stiffly, thanking her before leaving the office with Seamus and Dean in tow.</p><p>As soon as he stepped out the door, he’s smiling. Well, not much as smiling as grinning, a full shit-eating grin as he clamoured up the steps and shot out of the corridor. </p><p>Perhaps it's the nostalgia of being back here in school, but his mind flashed back to the day of the Sorting Ceremony where he’d met Professor Mcgonagall for the very first time.</p><p>Everyone was always so surprised when he said he’d almost been put in Slytherin.</p><p> </p><p>He doesn’t understand why though.</p><p> </p><hr/><p>  </p><p align="center">
  <strong>2nd November 2019</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>There’s a Hufflepuff boy waiting for him at the top of the stairs as he approached.</p><p>“Woah dude, you’re even cooler in person. Stiles is so gonna flip!”</p><p> </p><p>The boy grinned up at him, asymmetrical jawline making his smile look even more lopsided, “Name’s Scott by the way, Scott McCall! Year Four Hufflepuff at your service. It’s a pleasure to meet you Mr. Potter!”</p><p>He held out a tan hand which Harry shook firmly. He could actually feel the warmth radiating off the boy. Harry couldn't help but think that there was something oddly comforting and familiar about him. The boy's smile was both disarming and unguarded at the same time, it made him want to trust this boy. He’s vaguely reminded of Sirius, though he can’t draw a definitive similarity between them.</p><p>“I’ll be bringing you to your office Mr Potter, its up in the north wing. Headmistress Mcgonagall arranged for an office nearer the staffroom but considering the timing…" he shrugged nonchalantly, grin still firmly in place as he bobbed up the stairs, brown curls lolling from side to side as they made their way past the dining hall.</p><p>“That’s quite alright. It’s nice to meet you too Scott.” Harry replied. </p><p>The boy practically beamed at him and in the cold fall air of the palace, the warmth of his smile was like being hugged by a thousand suns.</p><p>“You’re gonna love being here, I mean being back here. Can’t wait till the rest of the school hears about this, I mean like seriously dude, this is the coolest thing that’s ever happened since the Triwizard tournament was announced.” Scott said, eyebrows furrowing slightly.</p><p>He followed Scott along and tried not to drown in all the nostalgia.</p><p>For the first time, he regretted not attending his Seventh Year with Hermione when he had the chance.</p><p> </p><p>But perhaps it was for the best, it would’ve been truly selfish to hole himself up in Hogwarts while the presence of Death Eaters was still very much a reality. He wondered if Dumbledore ever felt this way, old and jaded by the world; so empty, and calculating and all-knowing in his own righteousness, so immersed in the Light that any sacrifice was worth the pain of winning.  </p><p>He knows now, as he knew then, that this cold logic was necessary to defeat Lord Voldemort and all his fiery hatred at a world that had treated him so unfairly. For all his manipulation and outright deception, Harry had no doubt Dumbledore never quite knew how to love, and as much as he looked up to the wizard as a father-figure, or the closest thing he had to a father figure, he could understand why the man never allowed people into his life.</p><p>That would be too much of a weakness.</p><p> </p><p>Which is why Harry is determined to do the exact opposite of what Dumbledore had done.</p><p>Rather than observe from afar, he was going to take the initiative in wrestling his way into their lives; rather than giving cryptic messages that didn’t mean diddly squat, he was going to be upfront and honest about wanting to spend more time with them. Rather than allowing underage children to go gallivanting around in the Forbidden Forest at wee hours of the night, his kids would have the protected school life that he’s never had. Harry will make sure of it.</p><p>Or die trying.</p><p>He’s got a whole speech prepared to explain everything when he meets them, then they’ll be touched by his grand gesture and beg him to stay with them forever. It was going to be beautiful. </p><p>For now however, he was content to follow the boy… what was it, <em>Scott</em>, to his lodgings.</p><p> </p><p>The rest of the walk is peaceful. The meeting with Mcgonagall had taken a bulk of the afternoon which was then followed by contact time with the other professors. There were some familiar faces, Slughorn, Flitwick, Binns (Harry groaned inwardly at the ghostly figure) were all there to greet him with a warm welcome. But Harry was happiest to see Neville, quietly sipping a cup of tea by the windowsill.</p><p>“Hey Harry” he had said, face splitting into a buck-toothed grin as if it hadn’t been five years since they'd last seen each other at the reunion.</p><p>It felt like no time had passed at all.</p><p>“Hey Neville” he replied easily, leaning forward to slap a solid pat on his back. </p><p>Harry turned to the rest of the staffroom curiously, there were plenty more faces he couldn't recognise, but was sure he would soon have the pleasure of doing so.</p><p>By the time he had exited the staffroom, it was already well after curfew. Students had gone back to their common rooms and the hallways were empty and peacefully quiet. </p><p>Nothing much had changed about Hogwarts, at least structurally speaking. After the event of the Second Wizarding War, everyone had helped to restore the castle to its former glory. Protection spells, runes and charms triply reinforced and whatever else that had been destroyed was mended with a large-scale Reparo spell. Still there were some parts that would be lost forever, like the Room of Requirement which had been burnt to a crisp, as well as the Chamber of Secrets which had caved in, there were others too but… well, perhaps they were all better off without it.</p><p> </p><p>“Well this it Mr Potter!” Scott all but shouted as the door to his office was swung open.</p><p>It was a room that Harry had been in before once or twice, but had completely forgotten about. The outlay of the office was mostly the same though. There was a large oak desk to the right of the room, marred by an empty shelf. A large chest sat near the entrance, and it looked like it had been recently emptied. Hanging from the ceiling were long banners of red and gold tapestry, crisscrossing the room like waves in the Red Sea. Several paintings lined the back of the room and behind it, Harry could see a flight of stairs going up to where he assumed would be his living quarters for the rest of the year.</p><p>“Sorry it’s a little sparse, Stiles and I were really excited to have you up here so we may have umm... cleaned the place up a little bit? You know spruced things up, I mean considering how cluttered it was. Hope that's not weird... is it?” Scott asked, smiling shyly in hesitation.</p><p>“Not at all, in fact I have to thank you for your help.” Harry replied truthfully. He was curious as to what was this styles creature that Scott kept mentioning, <em>maybe a new type of pet?</em> but decided that asking would be rude and he didn’t want to offend the boy on their first meeting. Also, he was staring at Harry with tiny stars in his eyes where the iris should have been.</p><p>“I know right! It was Stiles' idea though, he always comes up with the neatest ideas! He’s amazing at wandless magic too, you should really meet him ASAP.” his lips made a loud pop at the last syllable.</p><p>“Definitely.” Harry nodded sagely, before releasing a perfectly timed yawn, “Perhaps tomorrow.”</p><p>Scott didn’t take the hint however, “Definitely Mr Potter, I know he’ll be really pleased to see you! Well I’ll let you get to it then, I’m sure it’s been a long day. Or maybe you’ll like some help unpacking?” Scott stooped at the door, staring at him hopefully.</p><p>Harry quickly took this as a cue to fake another yawn, “Goodnight Scott.”</p><p>“Be sure to let me know if you need anything else!” Scott’s voice was a booming echo in the silence of the room.</p><p>“I will Scott, and I’ll be sure to meet this... <em>styles</em> of yours very soon. Have a pleasant evening.” he all but shoved Scott out the door and slammed it in the boy’s face, trying his best not to think about how long the poor sod was just going to stand there.</p><p>It felt vaguely like he’d just kicked a puppy and felt almost guilty. He wonders if he had ever hero-worshipped Dumbledore in the same way.</p><p><em>Definitely not</em>.</p><p>But the thought makes him cringe inwardly anyway.</p><p> </p><p align="center">===</p><p>  </p><p>He gets an owl from Ginny the very next morning, he unrolled the piece of paper carefully. There was only a single sentence written neatly on it.</p><p><em>Darling Harry</em>, it wrote,</p><p>
  <em>This is not I meant when I said to fix it.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>With all my love</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Ginny</em>
</p><p>He grimaced, she always knew exactly what to say to make him feel like he’d won the worst husband of the year award. </p><p> </p><p>When finalisations for his new transfer had taken place, he’d been too busy with packing to announce his departure, or at least that’s what Harry told himself. He had left Ron to be the bearer of bad news, along with empty promises of his impending return. He winced internally.</p><p>Ginny would be more than happy without him, Harry reasoned to his traitorous heart. She hadn’t said anything of the sort of course, but he’d seen the way she had stopped outside muggle travel agencies, picking up pamphlets on couple yoga gym sessions, pointing out 2-For-1 deals on painting workshops etc.</p><p>But her plans kept getting held back because Harry simply didn’t have the time, nor the interest for such leisurely activities.  </p><p>His mind drifted back to the conversation he’d had with Albus when he’d told his children the good news.</p><p align="center"> </p><p>
  <em>“Dad” His son stood aghast, “I tell you to back off, and you decide to work here, here in Hogwarts? Why don’t you just stuff me down a chimney Da? Or better yet, tie a ruddy rope around me neck and be done with it?"</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Language, Albus.” he’d hardly had time to bellow out before Albus was storming way. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Only the lowest of the bloody low go on the way you do Da, hope you’re happy with yourself!” he’d turned and shouted from across the hall. </em>
</p><p align="center"> </p><p>He sighed, making his way down to the empty office room. Even Lily had given him a wide berth since his arrival. </p><p>Only James had greeted him with a warm hug, though his eldest son had been apologetic about not visiting sooner, especially since he wouldn’t be able to spend as much time with his father as he wanted to, considering that this was the year of his O.W.L.s, and he was planning to finish his N.E.W.T.s in his Seventh Year.</p><p>Albus had reacted the worst, openly throwing him dirty looks from across the foyer, turning tail whenever he rounded the corridor and mouthing the words <em>'I hate you'</em> whenever they were forced to be in the same room.  </p><p>Tumbling back into the armchair in his office, he sighed in defeat. <em>Sticks and stones</em>, he reminded himself, <em>sticks and stones</em>.</p><p> </p><p>This was not at all how he had planned it to go. They were supposed to spend more time together, they were suppose to be <em>glad </em>he was here. He just wanted to watch over them, spend some of the best years of their life alongside them. Maybe even give advice and guidance should they require it. And maybe, just <em>maybe</em>, Harry would have an answer for his loneliness, maybe even find a part of himself that he'd been missing, some way to quell the emptiness and replace the crater-shaped hole that his children had left in his heart.</p><p>Harry changed into his robes, banishing the distress to the back of his mind but the the bitter thought pervaded, sinking its roots insistently. </p><p>He’d just arrived and everything was already going awry. <em>Maybe Albus was right</em>, he thought sadly, <em>maybe I shouldn’t be here at all. </em></p><p>Not to mention, things were still bad with the headmistress as well.</p><p>Mcgonagall was in frequent contact with the Ministry, often away from her office for weeks at a time. He had no doubt that she was against his being here, trying vehemently to send him back even though he’d already been here for two months. But with Hermione at his side and Ron left in charge of his department, there was very little wriggle room for argument; even Mcgonagall would have trouble facing all three of them down. <br/> Surprisingly, the whole idea hadn't been his in the first place, it had been Hermione’s. He had been sincere with his sales pitch but most of the arguments were instigated by her and when she had drawn up the contract for a joint partnership proposal between his department and S.P.E.W, everyone else had gladly leapt onboard. </p><p>However in lieu of his transfer and Hermione’s successful run in office, he had completely forgotten that Hogwarts was once again the host of the Triwizard Cup this year.</p><p align="center">=</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>“The first time in a long while that Hogwarts gets to host the cup and now this!” Mcgongall hissed, shaking her hands in anger, “A Fourth Year has once again been selected by the Goblet, and once again he swears he didn’t put his name in!" </em>
</p><p><em>"Just one month after that, you arrive.” She stuck out a bony finger to point at him accusingly, the effort causing her whole body to tremble. </em> <em>“Coincidences? Don’t make me laugh Potter, or are you only too happy to watch history repeat itself?”</em></p><p>
  <em>The words stung but he deflected them easily, “If there's any real trouble, I do believe my being here would be of service ma’am.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Help? Help, you say? For six years Mr Potter you were a miasmic magnet of mischief! The boy’s life is already in danger and the only help you’ll offer is to hold his hand as he jumps off the plank!” her voice boomed.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Beside him Hermione clipped, “Please calm down Headmistress Mcgonagall.” </em>
</p><p>
  <em>She continued “There were extenuating circumstances in Harry’s case, as you well know, one that was completely beyond his control and one that will not reappear again.”</em>
</p><p><em>"Your heavy-handed accusations are hardly fair, and I do not take kindly to insults made against my staff.” </em> <em>Despite having been in fear of the old lady for a large part of her life, Hermione’s tone is severe.</em></p><p>
  <em>Harry felt he should be slightly insulted at being called her staff, but wisely kept his mouth shut.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Why Miss Granger! Would you care to explain this situation then?" The old lady wrung her hands in exasperation, "Why now after twenty-five years, are these wretched events happening again?"</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“I would certainly like to tell you that Headmistress, however it’s not within my jurisdiction to do so right now and I don’t get paid overtime.” she waved her hand dismissively.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Regardless, I can assure you that extra precautions have been taken, the Ministry has reviewed and re-reviewed the rules and safety guidelines for this year’s event. As you well know, the nature of this competition is meant to test the very best of students. Alas, a sliver of danger is but a necessary ingredient for the tasks, and I’m afraid there’s very little I, nor the council, can do for you or that Fourth Year Hufflepuff. All participants are aware of these risks before entering, and no favouritism must be shown.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>She added chastely, “Diggory was hardly the first casualty, and no one except Lord Voldemort can be blamed for the series of events leading up to his death.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Harry did his best not to flinch, the remorse welling up like quicksand in his throat.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Ron who’s standing opposite Hermione, added on “And you’ve got us Aurors stationed here for the remaining span of the tournament Professor! Not to mention the Department Head himself.” Ron grinned in his direction, “If there’s any foul play, Harry will be the first on it, won’t you Harry?”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Harry smiled back, the husband and wife duo could very well be the wizarding equivalent of good cop bad cop.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Thats not something I can guarantee Ron” Harry replied truthfully, “but I will promise that I’ll do my utmost to protect the students.”</em>
</p><p><em>Mcgongall sighed, folding her hands carefully and propping her chin to stare into his eyes, </em> <em>“Thats what I’m afraid of Mr Potter.” </em></p><p> </p><p>
  <em>“Who’s going to protect you?”</em>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">===</p><p align="center"> </p><p>He skimmed through the list of students in his hands.</p><p>Mcgongall had immediately put him to work since they returned from their little rendezvous at the Ministry. He was supposed to meet ‘troublemakers’, those who were repeat visitors for detention. He flipped through their profiles, suppressing a smirk. Some of the stunts these kids pulled would’ve put even Fred and George to shame.<br/> Included in his binder were also some of the students who were reported with behavioural issues, poor medical history or had complicated family backgrounds. </p><p>He frowned when he sees a familiar name down the roster:  </p><p> </p><p></p><blockquote>
  <p><em>Allison Argent.<br/> </em> <em>Fourth Year Slytherin<br/> </em> <em>Potential candidacy for prefect</em></p>
  <p><em>Allison Argent displays great promise in her studies. She gets along well with her classmates both in her own house as well as the others. The Argent family however, has expressed repeated concern regarding her education here, particularly towards her safety in Hogwarts. Family visitations have proven unsuccessful in dissuading her guardians thus far. </em> <em>Appropriate action required.<br/> </em></p>
</blockquote><p>Harry flipped the page hoping to find more information but it was blank save for her results slip, followed by a list of her many achievements in the school. He frowned harder, having completely forgotten about the girl he had met at Platform Nine and Three-Quarters last year.</p><p>He gets the same nagging feeling that he was missing something, but once again couldn’t place it.</p><p>They weren’t part of the Sacred Twenty-Eight and Allison’s father, <em>What was his name? Chris? </em> had mentioned that they were muggles but still, Argent was a fairly uncommon family name and Harry wonders where he’d heard it before.</p><p> </p><p>He’s deep in his musings when fierce shouts outside his office snapped him back to reality.</p><p> </p><p><em>“First you kick him out of the pack and now this? Who are you to be giving out orders Hale?</em>" The voice is light but shrill in anger.<em> </em></p><p>
  <em>"Do you know how hard it was for him? How much of it he had to go through alone? What about me Der? Do you know how much I've sacrificed to keep us all alive? While you were busy stuffing your tail up your arse, I've had to stop him from clawing himself to death every single time!” </em>
</p><p>A gruff sound responded, baritone and grainy as if unused to speaking so loudly,<em> “</em><em>I did it to protect him, you fool. You know nothin' bout us, so just bugger off Stilinkski! Go snog your little boyfriend for all I care!” </em></p><p><em>“Stop running your mouth as if you know me! Or I’ll… I’ll…” </em>the lighter voice threatens, fury cutting off his words.</p><p><em>“You’ll what? Actually do something about it?” </em>came the haughty reply.</p><p> </p><p>Harry knows, with enough of his own experience, what will transpire next; so with wand in hand, he flocks out the door.</p><p>
  <em>“Stupe—“</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Expalliarmus!”</em>
</p><p>The spell shot out from his lips too fast for his wand to catch up but it hit dead center on its target and the smaller boy’s crooked black wand flew out of his grasp.</p><p>He turned to face them, eyeing them up and down.</p><p> </p><p>“You boys have some explaining to do.”</p><p> </p><p>On closer inspection, the boy with the wand was tall and lanky, with a head of short buzzed hair and a splatter of moles covering his whole face, one that was currently staring back at him in horror. Beside him was a slightly taller boy with a well-built frame and dark hair.</p><p>It was like looking at two very odd opposites.</p><p>“It wasn’t my— his fault!” They both shouted at the same time.</p><p>“It's my fault… sir. I should have known better.” The older boy hastened to proclaim, it’s only now that Harry notices the red and gold tie around his neck tucked neatly into his sweater vest. <em>Figures.<br/> </em></p><p>“Yup, he did! He totally did! It’s all his fault sir! I mean I was the one who almost cast the spell there... but it was clear that I was provoked! So really, it's all his fault! His, not mine!” The other boy shouted, hands waving madly.</p><p>This earned him a glare from the bigger boy but who otherwise remained silent.</p><p>Harry had heard this argument many, <em>many </em>times before. Some of the times it's from his own lips but most of the time it’s from James, or Albus. </p><p>He sighed, missing them greatly. </p><p> </p><p>Looking down at the two boys in front of him, he wasn’t quite sure what to do with them. On one hand they were clearly breaking school rules, but on the other he wasn’t a teacher and so wasn’t allowed take away house points or give detentions willy nilly. Also, the two boys clearly weren’t really going to hurt each other and he had stepped in before any real damage was done.</p><p>And most importantly, he didn’t give a farthing about rules.</p><p>“Fine. Just keep your quarrels to yourself from now on, understand?” He smoothed a hand against his greying hair, feeling the steady thrum of an oncoming migraine.</p><p>“You’re… you’re <em>him.</em>” The younger boy muttered, gulping in amazement.</p><p> </p><p>On any other day, Harry would be uncomfortable at such an overt display of affection for his status however today he misses his children like an abstained alcoholic misses Jack. Especially the way they used to hero worship <em>him </em>when they were younger before they all grew up and decided to gallivant off into the sunset, as far away from him as they physically could.</p><p>So instead he swallowed a grin and nodded seriously, “I <em>am</em>.”</p><p>“You <em>are</em>.” The lighter voice gasped again, “We were so busy fighting, I’d forgotten where we’d end up!”</p><p>“Derek. Look, it’s <em>him.</em>” the smaller boy repeated again, much to his amusement.</p><p>The older boy, Derek, just rolled his eyes and extended a hand towards him, “It's good to finally meet you Mr Potter.” </p><p>Harry shook it without hesitation.</p><p>“It really is him.” The other boy repeated yet again, squealing as he did so, then clearing his throat noisily before launching into a rapid rant, “I mean, its so nice to meet you Mr Harry, I mean Mr Harry Potter, I mean Mr Potter!” he continued, blotchy red patches marring his freckled face, “I’m a big fan. Like <em>huge</em>, I’ve read all your books, I have all your chocolate frog cards. I have posters of you in my dorm room. I can’t even believe you’re real, like you’re really real here and you’re standing in front of me, breathing the same air as me, <em>talking,"</em> He pointed a finger at himself in awe,<em> </em>"To <em>me.”<br/> </em></p><p>He squeaked again, “It’s such an honour to have you here with us.”</p><p>He turned to the boy beside him, elbowing him in the ribs “It's just brilliant! Absolutely brilliant! Isn’t it, Derek?”</p><p>“It is indeed.” Derek replied amicably. “But we really should be going now, dinner is about to start.” Derek elbowed the other boy back to which he was quickly slapped away.</p><p>“Who cares about dinner? It’s Harry friggin Potter and I’m staying here to talk to him! You can go if you want to, but I’m not moving from this spot even if a troll falls from the sky and—“</p><p>“<em>Dinner.</em>” Derek gritted out, “Is <em>important</em>. Unless <em>someone </em>would like to have dog chow for the evening... Again.”</p><p>At this, the other boy visibly paled, “Yes certainly, we must go. To dinner. Yes, dinner it is! Dog chow is good and all, but it tastes too much like me Da’s meatloaf to be anybody’s first choice.” He shrugged before turning to Harry shyly, “But we can come back right? Just to talk? I mean if we want, or if you wanted us to. Because I really <em>really </em>want to. Talk to you that is.”</p><p>Harry considered the two boys before him.</p><p>The sudden change in atmosphere was oddly titillating, one could hardly tell that the two boys were at each other’s throat just a few minutes earlier. Harry himself couldn’t tell whether they were friends or enemies.</p><p>One thing was for sure though, there was something dodgy going on between them.</p><p> </p><p>“Without a doubt.” He finally answered. “It’s been a pleasure to meet the both of you. Now hurry along, before Filch catches you.”</p><p>The boy beamed at him and he’s instantly reminded of the Hufflepuff he’d seen on his first day.</p><p>“Thank you!” he shouted down the hallway, a skip in his step as he tumbled along. The other older boy had already ran far ahead.</p><p>With one last excited <em>‘WHOOP!’</em> they disappeared down the corridor, out of sight and out of mind.</p><p>He shook his head and retreated back to his office.</p><p> </p><p>Today was a weird day.</p><p> </p>
