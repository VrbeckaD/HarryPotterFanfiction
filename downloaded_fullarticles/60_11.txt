    <p>When Tony had invited them all to live with him after the tower was rebuilt, they thought that Tony was bluffing. The team had disbanded. Nat and Clint had gone back to do what they did before becoming Avengers. Thor had left for Asgard. Tony and Rose had moved to their Malibu residence to get some personal space. Steve had left to rediscover America after 70 years. Bruce had stayed behind at the tower. He had realized that Tony was a man of his words and he had indeed gifted him a Candyland, i.e. a whole floor to him. and it was finally a place where he was left alone and wasn't feared for his alter-ego.</p><p>But after the whole Killian agenda, Fury, Steve, and others had decided it was best to stick around. And when Tony had re-proposed the idea of them all moving into the tower, they all took upon it.</p><p>It had only been barely 5 days and everyone was still trying to get used to each other.</p><p>Clint's lazy ass and his weird love of hiding in vents.</p><p>Nat's ability to walk in on people without being detected, and giving the best passive-aggressive poker face.</p><p>Bruce's habit of staying shut unless really spoken to or he has to make a point or discuss stuff with Tony and/or Rose. Thor had yet not returned, even if he did have a room for himself in the tower.</p><p>Steve's rules and expectations from others, often channeling his 40's mannerisms and being confused at modern references around him, though the team was helping him with it.</p><p>And then there were the Starks. Both of them were rarely seen in the tower but would pop up at any sudden time. Tony usually wouldn't wake up till lunchtime and then spent the rest of his time in the lab, creating or modifying stuff for himself and the team, when not spending time with Pepper. Rose was an early riser. By the time the team would be there for the breakfast, she would leave for the office and wouldn't return until late evening. Any spare time, she would be found reading some weird books, which Nat had pointed to them was written in Archaic Latin or working in her own lab or helping Tony in the lab.</p><p>And right now they were having dinner. the whole team was there except Rose, Pepper, and Thor. Clint was complaining about the hardness of the mattress of his bed, glaring at Tony when the elevator dinged open, getting all there attention. Rose stepped out, dressed up in a beige full-sleeve blouse with deep neckline tucked inside black trousers. Her pink hair was in a wavy low ponytail, her newly cut fringes framing her face. Her high heels clicked on the linoleum floor as she entered, talking into her phone</p><p>"Of course,...uh-huh...I get it, Mr. Gillman. You don't have to worry. I'll personally overlook the entire process...yes, of course.." she laughed "it's been my pleasure..." she chuckled and hung up, just as she took a seat next to Tony, keeping her phone on the table and giving out a tired sigh. Nat gave her a once over and passed over dinner to her. Rose looked at food and then at the assassin as a beam broke out on her face</p><p>"You are god-sent," Rose said and started eating her food</p><p>"tough day?" Tony asked</p><p>"Kind of" she replied, nodding</p><p>"Where's Pepper?" Tony asked</p><p>"she and Brittany are going over some patents and funding. I offered to stay, but Pep literally kicked me out"</p><p>Tony chuckled loudly, earning a glare from his daughter</p><p>"Your girlfriend kicked me out of my own office and you find it funny?" she raised her brow</p><p>"What do you want me to say?" Tony asked, still amused</p><p>Rose harrumphed and went back to her food.</p><p>"Who made dis?" she asked after a while, mouth full of food</p><p>"Why?" Clint asked, peeking at her</p><p>"Just answer, birdbrain" she deadpanned, swallowing the food</p><p>"I did," Nat said, sitting opposite to Rose</p><p>"I might need the recipe. it's too good" she grinned at the assassin who just smiled in return</p><p>"who was on the phone?" Tony asked</p><p>"Trevor Gillman" she replied</p><p>"Turtle-head?" Tony asked</p><p>"Hmm-mm" Rose nodded "He sent his 7th application for SI to fund his research. And this time it looks legit. I need to go over that once, though"</p><p>"He does realize that Crapplets are not worth anything, right? they were never worth anything"</p><p>Rose shrugged "He promised to have upgraded them. And considering his position, I have to entertain him," she looked at Tony " no matter how much I hate turtle-head"</p><p>"So, Cap," Steve looked up from his food towards Clint "Fury mention any new mission?"</p><p>"Not yet" Steve replied</p><p>"It's a little radio silence from him" Clint muttered</p><p>"Maybe he fell down, hit his head and lost his memory" Tony snorted</p><p>"That's highly unlikely" Bruce jutted in</p><p>"Maybe he's giving us some vacay-time" Clint shrugged, a grin forming "I'm thinking Hawaii"</p><p>"right" Natasha scoffed</p><p>"That reminds of three things to talk before I forget them" Rose spoke up, keeping the spoon on the empty plate and turning to completely face Tony</p><p>"Pep told me to tell you about some teddy bear."</p><p>Tony's eyes widened a little after a few seconds "right" he nodded</p><p>"I do not need to know" Rose scrunched her face before shaking her head once "anyway, two, I have a meeting in Berlin day after tomorrow after which I'm heading to London"</p><p>"Why?"</p><p>"Fleur's pregnant" Rose smiled</p><p>"again?" Tony chuckled "Bill's having a third kid?"</p><p>"Yup" Rose grinned</p><p>"Who's that?" Clint asked</p><p>"Sister-in-law" Rose replied, causing Clint to choke on his food. Bruce handed him a glass of water and rubbed his back while looking at Rose in confusion</p><p>"Wai-what?" Clint demanded, "You have a brother?"</p><p>Both Rose and Tony gave him a look</p><p>"I have five older brothers" she replied "and a younger sister"</p><p>Steve blinked. Rose had six siblings? Why was he only finding it now?</p><p>"Not mine" Tony added</p><p>"Anyway," Rose began "So she wants to go to France to break the news to her parents. And Percy and Ron are heading out on ministry business. Angie got a match and George is going with her. Audrey's going to her parents' too. So I volunteered to babysit all the kids"</p><p>"All of them?" Tony asked</p><p>"It's not like I haven't done it before, is it?" Rose asked "Besides, it's just Vicky, Dom, Lucy, Molly and Freddie for two days. You'll be fine"</p><p>Tony pouted at her for a split second but changed before anyone could notice. If any, *cough*Natasha*couch* even did, they didn't comment</p><p>"And third and quite important" she turned to face everyone "Tomorrow night's a charity gala event. I was asked if the Avengers could make an appearance. Naturally, I didn't make any promises. and I wanted to ask if you guys could make it?"</p><p>"I don't have a dress," Nat said</p><p>"Take one from me" Rose simply replied</p><p>"You wouldn't have any Armani, would you?" Nat raised her brow</p><p>"I have Ralph Lauren" Rose grinned</p><p>"I'm in"</p><p>"Well, it's a Stark Party. I'd like to see if the rumors are actually true" Clint grinned "I'm coming"</p><p>"Bruce?" Rose asked</p><p>"I don't do well with crowds" Bruce nervously replied</p><p>"You don't have to give any interview unless you want to. I promise you'll be left undisturbed." Rose smiled</p><p>"Yeah Bruce, come to the party" Tony grinned</p><p>"Fine" Bruce tiredly sighed "But I don't have a su-"</p><p>"Borrow mine" Tony quickly said "Cap?"</p><p>Steve found all of them looking at him in anticipation. Something told him that 'No' would not be taken as an answer</p><p>"Okay" Steve nodded</p><p>"What about Thor?" Bruce asked</p><p>"Not that I hate the guy or something, but he's not really used to earthly customs. I did send him an invite, though. if he turns up, well and good. If not," Rose just shrugged, taking another spoonful</p><p>"Great" Tony smiled "Now that it's all been sorted and I have a very important project coming up to be finished within the next two da-"</p><p>"You are coming" Rose deadpanned, standing up to keep her plate in the sink</p><p>"I'm not!"</p><p>"Don't be a wanker" Rose replied, turning again to face Tony "You have to come"</p><p>"I'm not a people person, Rosie" Tony tried again</p><p>"I wasn't asking" she replied, crossing her arms </p><p>"Spent some quality time in the UK?" It was Nat who asked that</p><p>"Huh?" Rose looked at her</p><p>"You are quite fluent in British slangs"</p><p>"That's because I'm British" Rose replied casually</p><p>"Okay, time out!" Clint declared "How come we are just finding out that you have a whole secret horde of siblings no one ever knew and that you are British? You are American! Your birth certificate says so"</p><p>Rose raised a brow at that</p><p>"I'm part American, part British and part Italian" she replied</p><p>"And now she's Italian" Clint complained, making Rose frown</p><p>"My mum was British. I did my schooling in Scotland. Maria Stark was Italian. Dad's half Italian" she shrugged "Get a grip, Katniss" with that she turned towards Tony "Party's at 9. and you are coming" with that she turned and left, heels clicking sharply</p><p>It had been a little over 8 months, almost 9, they had all known each other and had been in contact, but it was the first time any of them had heard Rose mention her mother in a conversation</p><p>"Control freak!" Tony called after her but she just ignored it</p><p>silence settled on the dining table before Clint spoke up again</p><p>"You are half Italian?"</p><hr/><p>Tony groaned, throwing his hands up. He quickly removed the messy tie from around his neck and threw it on the bed, adjusting the collar of his white shirt. And he would never be ashamed of the fact that he could never tie a tie. Sometimes he managed out of fluke, but the majority of times, nope. The tie would never cooperate when he would want it too.</p><p>He was Tony-effing-Stark. He was Iron Man. He can and will make a tuxedo work without a tie. Etiquette and rules are damned</p><hr/><p>It was 8.45 when they all met in the Communal floor. Despite trying not to stand out, Bruce was given a dark blue tuxedo coat with black hints which he wore with a black bowtie over his white shirt and black tuxedo slacks. Clint was grinning, wearing a dark grey suit with a white shirt and black tie. Steve had tried to remain traditional with a black tuxedo, white shirt, and black tie.</p><p>"Where are the girls?" Bruce asked, checking his wristwatch, again</p><p>"I think the bigger question is, where is Tony?" Clint chuckled "He sure is taking as much as the girls"</p><p>"I just had a minor issue"</p><p>the three men turned around to see Tony walking down the stairs, cuffing his tuxedo jacket's sleeves. Once done, he shook his arms once before looking to see all three of them looking at him</p><p>"What?" he raised a brow</p><p>Bruce seemed to speak, but then shut his mouth and shook his head "The girls?" he asked instead</p><p>"Relax," Tony said, walking to the bar and pouring himself a drink</p><p>"The gala hasn't started yet and you are drinking?" Steve couldn't help but ask</p><p>"I'm not going to drink and drive. I know the laws, Stars, and Stripes" Tony replied, gulping the drink. He was just pouring himself another when a sound of heels came around. And soon Natasha appeared dressed in a beautiful figure-hugging sleeveless deep blue gown. Her short red hair was straightened as it reached about her chin, one side tucked behind a simple blue barette. Her lips were pretty pink but she looked gorgeous</p><p>"Huh" Tony was the first to break the silence, raising the glass to drink "You clean up well, Romanoff"</p><p>"You already knew that" she replied with a roll of her eyes</p><p>"You look gorgeous" Steve smiled. </p><p>"Thanks, Steve" she smiled</p><p>"Is that Rose's dress?" Tony asked again</p><p>"she let me borrow one" Nat replied, "Is that a problem?"</p><p>Tony shrugged "Not from this side"</p><p>The elevator dinged and stepped out Rose.</p><p>Steve was pretty sure he had literally stopped breathing from the moment he had looked at her</p><p>She wore a sleeveless black dress with a very plunging neckline, almost went past her chest. A piece of velvet surrounded her waist after which it was just a huge bunch of tulle. A good amount of black sequins started from the waistline but soon disappeared before reaching her knee, which gave a view of her legs perfectly through the transparent black material. Her pink hair was in an updo, her fringes reaching her eyebrows and framing the rest of her face. A pair of beautiful diamond drop earrings marked her ears, her lips deep wine red and a silver band glistening in her right-hand middle finger.</p><p>Entering into the hall, she didn't even look at anyone else but straightaway made her way to Tony, which gave the view of her half bareback.</p><p>"You didn't wear a tie?" she asked softly, resting her black clutch on the counter</p><p>This brought Steve back. He slightly shook his head and turned to look out of the window. Actually anywhere but at Rose would be a better option. He felt his cheeks warmed up and tried to mentally cool them. He couldn't believe that he was actually checking her out with her father in the same room!</p><p>What was becoming of him? Why did she affect him like this because he was pretty sure that since the time he was out, he had not checked out any girl in the way he had been Rose, who even now had been wearing more than many girls he had seen.</p><p>"Stop checking her out"</p><p>Steve again turned and found Clint, who also supported a minor blush, receive a silent smack from a glaring Nat. It was good to know that he wasn't the only one affected by the current situation. So why did not give him relief but made him want to also snap at Clint from checking Rose out too? Thankfully he had good self-control.</p><p>"I don't need a tie" Tony snorted as Rose reached and took a glass of drink from him, keeping it on the table and wrapping the tie around his neck</p><p>"I'm serious, Rosie," Tony said, "They won't kick me out because I didn't ear a tie.."</p><p>"hmm-mm"</p><p>Steve was pretty sure any man in his right mind would kill to have his tie tied by <em>the Rose Stark</em>. He wouldn't be caught dead admitting this, but he would also be one of those men.</p><p>"..I'm Iron Man, I'm perfect. A tie doesn't matter. It's not like it's compulsory to we-"</p><p>"It's done"</p><p>Tony stopped rambling and looked down as Rose tightened his tie a little and adjusted it before smiling and resting her hands on his chest</p><p>"Now you look perfect" she beamed at him, took a step back and checked him over</p><p>She nodded to herself and looked at others "Ready, everyone?"</p><p>"I was born ready!" Clint grinned jumping to his feet</p><p>"Behave" Natasha hissed under her breath before moving towards the elevator</p><p>"Guys, just a sec" Rose called out. She took her clutch and removed four trinkets from it, laying them on the counter. It had two simple bracelets and two rings "Well, this is the best I could find"</p><p>"What are these?" Steve asked, picking a ring, examining it. It was a simple silver band, just like the other.</p><p>"Special stuff" Rose smiled at him "Let's just say I modified them a little so whenever you feel like someone's gonna be clingy or ask one too many questions, just put them on."</p><p>"And then what?" Natasha asked</p><p>"You'll be left alone"</p><p>"Are you sure this works?" Steve asked</p><p>"They are field-tested, Cap" she smiled</p><p>"There are only 4," Bruce said, picking up the other ring and slipping it into his pocket</p><p>"Oh, Dad and I carry ours always with us," she said, showing her ring and tapping Tony's ring. She reached and took the glass before Tony could and finished it at once</p><p>"We need to go," she told him and picked her clutch, walking out. Tony followed her out, muttering something to himself. Nat picked a bracelet and walked out, Clint following her.</p><p>Steve looked down at the ring. It didn't look much but he had never worn a ring. He flipped it, trying to see if some chip or something was hidden on the underside but nothing</p><p>"Steve"</p><p>Steve looked up at Bruce, who was apparently waiting for him</p><p>"Sorry" he muttered and slipping it inside his pocket, and walking out</p><hr/><p>The gala was amazing. As soon as they had arrived, everyone dispersed. Tony had tried making a beeline for the bar, but Rose caught him and dragged him with her, ignoring his complaints and requests. Nat and Clint, apparently having more experience than Steve and Bruce( though the two were sure everyone in the party, including a toddler they had seen running amok, had more experience than both of them combined) had easily mingled into the crowd.</p><p>the two shared a look and unanimously decided to head to the bar.</p><p>Cradling the drink in his hand, Steve turned to observe the whole gathering. He finally spotted Pepper, donning a gorgeous all-white one sleeve dress. her hair in a ponytail and a pair of diamond earrings that looked very similar to Rose's. She was talking to someone, some man. She seemed to have spotted someone over the man's shoulder and invited them over.</p><p>Steve looked at the direction as Rose and a very tired looking Tony approached Pepper. Tony's expressions did a very quick 180, flashing all smiles as soon as he spotted Pepper with a man. Pepper introduced both Rose and Tony to the man and the four began talking. the man also introduced a young man, probably his son to the three. the weird feeling was back as Rose and the young man shook hands and chatted with all smiles.</p><p>Before anything could be done, he heard the music start and Tony asked Pepper for a dance, leaving Rose with the man's son. With a frown, Steve turned his stool around, asking the bartender for another drink</p><p>"One Expresso Martini"</p><p>Steve whipped his head next to him to see Rose, who smiled back at him</p><p>"Hey Cap"</p><p>"Hi" Steve smiled softly</p><p>"Thanks" she accepted the drink and turned to lean on the counter, looking through the crowd</p><p>Suddenly not able to start a conversation, Steve flushed before blurting out the first thing that came to his head</p><p>"Why don't you take a seat?"</p><p>"I'd rather be standing" she replied with a smile "Pepper prefers to have me introduced to new partners of important personnel during such events. Have to be on my toes" she spared him a look and a smile</p><p>"You didn't go dancing?" he asked, suddenly wanting to smack himself for not asking her to dance first</p><p>"Well, I'm not a dance person. I stay away from that" she replied</p><p>"You've never danced?" Steve asked</p><p>"I have, in the past. But I prefer not to" Rose shrugged, turning to face the bartender to ask another drink when,</p><p>"Rose?"</p><p>Rose's eyes widened slightly at the voice and a smile broke on her face as she spotted the man</p><p>"Reed!"</p><p>She quickly threw her arms around the man, who wrapped his arms around her waist, both of them laughing</p><p>"It's been so long," Reed said, pulling, but one of hand was still intertwined with hers. Steve narrowed his eyes at the man. He looked older, quite a lot for Rose. He had a glint in his eyes like the ones he had seen in Tony's, Bruce's and Rose's when they talk about science, their turf. and there again was the weird feeling in his gut, the uneasiness "Last I saw you was when you became the CEO. 3 ye-"</p><p>"4 years ago, yeah" Rose nodded with a smile "Time flies when you are having fun"</p><p>"and saving the world" Reed chuckled, causing her to laugh</p><p>"That too"</p><p>Rose's eyes snapped at Steve for a quick second, which Steve didn't notice at all before it settled on Reed back</p><p>"Reed," she began "I'd like you to meet Steve Rogers, Captain America, leader of our little gang of Avengers"</p><p>Steve hearing his name, perked up, pretending to be in on the conversation the whole time and shook hands with the man with a smile</p><p>"Steve, Reed Richards. An old friend of Dad's. Kinda like my uncle"</p><p>"that's great" Steve smiled a little brighter. though his reasons for saying that and Reed's interpretation were totally different.</p><p>suddenly Rose yelped, causing Steve to look at her. She was laughing as someone held her around the waist and lifted her up. She was put down as quick and a head pocked from behind her and Steve felt a chill run down his spine. The man holding Rose looked exactly like him. They could have been long lost twins!</p><p>Steve couldn't believe what he was seeing. How was this even possible? He was the only son to his parents and he had never...he was still a virgin.</p><p>"What are you doing here?" Rose asked, the smile never leaving her face as she rested her hands on top of the man's that was around her waist</p><p>"you didn't think I would come?" he asked. How was even their voice quite similar? Steve might have to ask Bruce about it later</p><p>"I forgot you were in America. Didn't you had a meet in Monaco?" she asked</p><p>"No, I didn't. And I can't believe you forgot about your boyfriend! Such a betrayal, Rosa! Oh my poor heart"</p><hr/>
