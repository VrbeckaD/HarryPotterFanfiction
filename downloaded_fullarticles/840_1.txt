    <p>-1-</p><p>The compartment doors crashed open, causing its two occupants to jump at the unexpected noise. One of which fled to the hat rest overhead, looking severely unimpressed.</p><p><br/>
“Sparrow!” A gangly fifteen year old with a riot of coppery-blonde curls that looked a little like a mix between a bird-nest and a mane launched herself at the aforementioned occupant. “I found you!”</p><p><br/>
Sparrow Fawley <em>oomph</em>ed when she was all but tackled, falling backwards against the cushioned seat.</p><p><br/>
“Evidently,” she returned, much quieter than her friend.</p><p><br/>
“How are you?” both asked at the same time.</p><p><br/>
Then, amidst amused snickers, prompted each other to proceed before they themselves could.</p><p><br/>
“I’m fine. No unexpected maimings since we last met,” Larkin shared cheerfully. “Come on, we have to go look for Kestrel!”</p><p><br/>
Kestrel being their other best friend. The third part to their trio. Their best half. Third? Their best third.</p><p><br/>
“No need, I heard you from outside,” a dry voice announced from the door.</p><p><br/>
Kestrel, dark hair pulled back into her customary (lazy) ponytail, raised an eyebrow at them, but there was mischief twinkling in her brown eyes. The red screech owl on her shoulder attempted to hide behind her ear.</p><p><br/>
A moment later, she joined the puppy pile. The owl fluttered up with a panicked face and hid in a corner of the luggage compartment.</p><p>“I’m never ever ever letting go,” Kestrel mumbled into someone’s shoulder. Smelled like Larkin’s; Sparrow tended to smell more flowery, with a hint of dust and books and ink, rather than earth and crushed leaves.</p><p><br/>
Sparrow sighed, but hid a grin in someone’s hair.</p><p><br/>
One of the others poked her side, and there was a pointy elbow digging into her belly.<br/>
Nevertheless, it was the most comfortable she’d been in two months, with her best friends so close they were all but lying on top of her.</p><p><br/>
Summers could be very long at the Fawley residence.</p><p>Especially these days, Sparrow thought despondently. No matter how much she petted Empress Catherine.</p><p><br/>
“You three are much too old for this,” another voice muttered from the doorway, and the tone made it clear Amelia was rolling her eyes at them.</p><p><br/>
“Thank you for your input, Amelia. It’s not appreciated,” Kestrel Hightower muttered, turning her head to poke out her tongue at their yearmate.</p><p>Amelia Bones sighed, looking far more put out than she probably was, and took a seat across from them. Which was telling enough as it was; she could have chosen a different compartment, but hadn’t.<br/>
“I had such hopes that you’d be a bit more mature this year. It’s our OWLs on the line!”</p><p><br/>
All three rolled their eyes and/or snorted at her.</p><p><br/>
“OWL grades aren’t everything. You need to loosen up. Not everything is about school.”</p><p><br/>
Amelia frowned at them, looking faintly insulted.</p><p><br/>
“Besides, maturity is overrated,” Larkin Dunbar told her sagely, somehow managing to look somewhat dignified where she was sprawled across Sparrow’s lap and with Kestrel pinning her legs awkwardly.</p><p><br/>
“Hear, hear,” a newcomer chimed in.</p><p><br/>
Sparrow righted herself, as well as she could, unsure if she wanted to bury herself further under her friends and hide or pretend blissful ignorance.</p><p><br/>
Regardless of her wishes, Sirius Black met her gaze head on, the expression on his face making it more than clear he wasn’t about to let this issue go by unremarked.<br/>
He performed a short bow, a complicated sequence complete with a flourish of his wand.</p><p>Looked awfully formal and proper, and somewhat out of character for him.</p><p><br/>
“Welcome to the family, future sister-in-law,” he said sardonically. “May he treat you well.”</p><p><br/>
Duty done, he nodded shortly to everyone and left without another word.</p><p><br/>
Well, Sparrow supposed, this was one way to announce her betrothal to everyone.</p><p><br/>
“So, how was your summer?” she asked, pointedly not commenting on Sirius’ bombshell.</p><p><br/>
Kestrel disentangled herself from the cuddle-pile, righted her ponytail, and drew her wand.</p><p>“Black’s going to have to duel me for your hand in marriage,” she announced brightly.</p><p><br/>
“And me!” Larkin added with a sharp grin.</p><p><br/>
“I have a feeling we’re going to be one Slytherin short, this year,” Amelia remarked dryly, eyeing the two girls somewhat warily, more than aware they were both deadly serious. “Please don’t make me have to report you for picking on a younger student.”</p><p><br/>
Kestrel offered her arm to Larkin in a surprisingly suave move. “Care to join me, dear?”</p><p><br/>
“For you? Always,” Larkin said with ease.</p><p><br/>
Both of them ignored Amelia’s words.</p><p><br/>
“You’re going to make me blush,” Sparrow said weakly, though her cheeks were already a charming pink.</p><p><br/>
“Too late for that, I think,” Larkin teased her gently, before a serious expression settled on her face. “But honestly. <em>Black</em>?” she questioned.</p><p><br/>
“Gonna go out on a limb and guess that dearest Sparrow had no input in that life-changing decision,” Kestrel surmised wryly. Then, brighter, “Oh well! I’m sure they’ll reconsider once Black loses his-”</p><p><br/>
“<em>Kess</em>!”</p><p><br/>
Amelia stared. “She’s supposed to be the quiet and nice one.”</p><p><br/>
“It’s a lie she’s been carefully cultivating since first year,” Larkin informed her glibly, not so much as blinking. “I’m still not sure how people can fall for it. Kestrel’s practically evil.”</p><p><br/>
“Says you,” Kestrel sniffed with mock-offense. “But I suppose we have to counter Sparrow’s niceness somehow.” Then she added, like an afterthought, “‘Cultivating’ is a strong word. Stay mostly quiet, smile a little, and suddenly everyone’s making assumptions about your rational personality.”</p><p><br/>
“Very true.” Larkin nodded gravely, while Sparrow snorted inelegantly.</p><p><br/>
“You cannot be speaking from experience, Dunbar,” Amelia commented, sending her an incredulous look.</p><p><br/>
“What do you mean?” Larkin asked with genuine puzzlement, feeling like she’d missed a step in the conversation. She hadn’t expected this turn.</p><p><br/>
“I have to go! Prefect meeting!” Amelia fled the compartment hastily. Without answering her question.</p><p><br/>
“Are any of us Prefects?” Kestrel asked, momentarily distracted from her quest.</p><p><br/>
“You really think there’d be a choice between Sparrow, me, and Amelia?” Larkin questioned incredulously.</p><p><br/>
“...you’ve got a point,” Kestrel agreed with a heavy dose of amusement colouring her voice. “But am I a Prefect, I wonder. I may have misplaced a few school letters. So I don’t know.”</p><p><br/>
This surprised nobody. Kestrel was a terribly unorganised Ravenclaw, but had somehow been settled with a reputation for being a Responsible Student among the teachers.</p><p><br/>
Probably had something to do with her close proximity to Larkin and Sparrow; the Trouble Duo. In comparison, Kestrel looked positively saintly to the untrained eye. Which definitely included some of their professors. But surely, Flitwick would know better?</p><p><br/>
Sparrow offered her a one-armed hug, seeing as her other was kind of pinned under Larkin’s butt.</p><p><br/>
“They wouldn’t!” Larkin gasped dramatically, leaning towards her friend with an overly concerned expression, which incidentally freed Sparrow’s arm.</p><p><br/>
“I’m sure we can arrange something if that turns out to be the case,” Sparrow put in with a small, ominous smile, absently massaging her hand to encourage the blood to flow back, which would hopefully get rid of the pins and needles currently prickling along the limb. “Most of the professors are reasonable.”</p><p><br/>
“I would be allowed to break curfew though,” Kestrel pointed out, then promptly shuddered. “When I could be <em>sleeping</em>.”</p><p><br/>
“Eh, we’ll take up our yearly tradition of abducting you to the Hufflepuff dorms when you sleep too little,” Larkin dismissed easily. “I’ll sit on you at the same time as I sit on Sparrow in an attempt to cure her occasional insomnia.”</p><p><br/>
“Just because we have bird names doesn’t mean you have to act like a nesting mother, Lark,” Sparrow pointed out with suppressed laughter in her voice. This was a much nicer conversation than dwelling on her recent betrothal.</p><p><br/>
“I’m not sure I can let you ‘break into’ the Ravenclaw common room now,” Kestrel sighed with overdone regret.</p><p><br/>
Larkin looked outraged.</p><p><br/>
“Good thing we never cared much for the rules,” Sparrow commented blandly, inspecting her nails nonchalantly. “Besides, you need me to get you into your dorm.”</p><p><br/>
That was true. Kestrel was not good at solving riddles. Plus, the stupid door knocker didn’t like her much.</p><p><br/>
“I know Callum isn’t attending any more, but do you think we could have a sleepover in the Slytherin common room?” Larkin asked innocently, though neither of them missed how her eyes glinted.</p><p><br/>
“Well, if I was indeed a Prefect, I could theoretically get permission to go into the Slytherin dorms, provided I had reason and evidence to believe a member of Slytherin to have wronged one of my charges. I’d be allowed to look for further evidence in their personal effects, though under the supervision of Slytherin’s head of house,” Kestrel answered thoughtfully. “Then I could leave an eavesdropping charm near the entrance which would yield me the password.”</p><p><br/>
“Sounds good. And it’s not gonna be hard to find an opportunity,” Larkin muttered with a darkening frown. “Things have been turning less and less hopeful, lately, if you ask me.”</p><p><br/>
Empress Cat hissed from her perch over their heads.</p><p><br/>
“We always knew this was coming,” Sparrow said softly, absentmindedly playing with the charm of her necklace, not acknowledging her cat, for now.</p><p><br/>
“I’m just glad Callum won’t have to put up with the rest of Slytherin now, what with the political climate and some of the things that happened last year.” Larkin grimaced unhappily.</p><p><br/>
“I’m grateful that neither Charles nor Luke ever had to deal with that bullshit,” Sparrow agreed, thinking about her brothers.</p><p><br/>
One of whom had recently gotten a position in the Department for International Magical Cooperation. The family was very proud.</p><p><br/>
Sparrow inwardly rolled her eyes.</p><p><br/>
Charles was a lovable extrovert, but at heart deeply insecure and easily led. She was quietly worried about someone taking advantage.</p><p><br/>
“What are we going to do about the roach problem this year?”</p><p><br/>
“Roach problem?” Kestrel asked with a confused frown, jarred out of plotting. “Which roaches exactly are we talking about?” Because ‘roach’ could metaphorically apply to a lot of things. “Also, I’ve decided to go to the Prefects’ meeting just in case I am one or otherwise to eavesdrop. If Slytherin’s got Death Eater Prefects… well. We’ll want to know about it.”</p><p><br/>
“Sounds like a plan.”</p><p><br/>
Sparrow held out her hand for a fistbump. “All the roaches. Big and small. Especially the really disgusting ones.”</p><p><br/>
Kestrel bumped their fists together.</p><p><br/>
“Good luck!”</p><p><br/>
“Don’t let the snakes bite,” Sparrow grinned, “I’m the jealous kind.”</p><p><br/>
Amelia, who’d just stepped back into the compartment and had clearly heard the tail-end of that exchange, snorted.<br/>
“Let’s hope your betrothed isn’t,” she said with a pointed look at Sparrow.</p><p><br/>
Larkin threw a piece of scrunched up paper at her. It might have fallen out of her pocket in her earlier ambush.<br/>
“Low blow, Bones.”</p><p><br/>
Amelia sighed. “I’ll never understand how such different personalities could align to form your friendship.”</p><p><br/>
Most of the castle seemed to find it a great mystery, so Amelia wasn’t exactly alone in that.</p><p><br/>
“Did you come back for a reason, or just to comment on our personalities?” Larkin questioned, gazing steadily at the girl, who she was sure had said something about an important meeting she had to attend.</p><p><br/>
“I came to get Kestrel,” Amelia revealed promptly. “Pandora voiced a small measure of concern about whether you’d know about having to be there or not,” she said, looking completely deadpan.</p><p><br/>
Larkin snickered.</p><p><br/>
“You can fool the rest of the school, but your Housemates know your secret!” she all but cackled, reaching out to shove Kestrel playfully.</p><p><br/>
“Like you’re anyone to talk,” the girl huffed, making a show of looking offended. She heaved a sigh. “So I need to go. Don’t set the train on fire, okay?”</p><p><br/>
“No promises,” Sparrow returned solemnly, looking very prim and proper where she sat, hands clasped neatly in her lap.</p><p><br/>
Larkin, her complete opposite, was sprawled out in her seat, shoes propped up on the opposite seat and hair falling out of the messy bun she seemed to have attempted to contain it in, several curls dangling in front of her face.</p><p><br/>
Amelia looked like she wasn’t sure if she’d meant that in a literal sense or not, but seemed determined not to ask.</p><p><br/>
Kestrel smiled brightly, feeling suitably accomplished.</p><p><br/>
“Shall we?” she asked, motioning at the corridor outside, and the waiting meeting.</p><p><br/>
Amelia nodded, sent Larkin and Sparrow one last dubious look, and then led the way to the front of the train.</p><p><br/>
Kestrel followed and wondered who the prefects for the other Houses were.</p><p align="center"> </p>
<hr/><p align="center"> </p><p><br/>
“This is a disaster,” Kestrel announced when she came back, and then took in what she was actually looking at.</p><p><br/>
Sparrow had been pushed back against the window, with Larkin all but bodily pinning her there.</p><p><br/>
Both girls had turned to stare at her when she’d slid the door open, effectively freezing.</p><p><br/>
Empress Cat had curled up on the hat rack, looking like a miniature tiger who was about to roll her eyes at them all. She was one to judge - she basically sat on Hedda, Kestrel’s eternally confused/panicked owl.</p><p><br/>
Blinking at her friends, Kestrel finally spotted what must have prompted this… situation.</p><p><br/>
Sparrow’s right hand was held aloft over her head, clutching Larkin’s wand, and Larkin must have all but climbed all over the girl to take it back.</p><p><br/>
A small giggle slipped out of Kestrel’s mouth before she smothered it back with a serious face and acted like nothing at all was out of the ordinary.</p><p><br/>
Amelia, standing beside her, looked entirely too long-suffering and unsurprised.<br/>
To be fair, she did share a dorm with these two lunatics.</p><p><br/>
“What’s a disaster?” Larkin asked, finally snatching her wand back and settling down on the seat, folding her feet in towards her hips and holding her ankles, giving Kestrel a curious look. It was a bit hard to take her seriously when she’d threaded her wand into the mess she called hair, though.<br/>
She also seemed to have discarded her shoes sometime after they’d left.</p><p><br/>
Sparrow straightened out her clothes with dignified poise, fooling absolutely none of them.<br/>
She decided to rescue her judgmental Maine Coon from the hat rack before the thing broke.<br/>
Empress Cat was a <em>legend</em>, but she was also 10 kg of fluffy fur, I’m Judging You™, and Vengeance.<br/>
The feline happily sprawled all over her lap, rubbing her head against her belly.</p><p><br/>
Hedda fluttered over to Kestrel, who hugged her to her chest, one hand running soothingly over the slightly askew feathers on her head.</p><p><br/>
“The Slytherin Prefects, that’s what!” Kestrel got back to the matter at hand.</p><p><br/>
“Who’s Gryffindor’s?” Sparrow interjected curiously, one hand stroking Cat’s belly.</p><p><br/>
“Evans and Lupin, predictably, but that’s not important!” Kestrel waved the question aside impatiently, striding in to finally sit down, choosing the seat opposite Sparrow, by the window.</p><p><br/>
Amelia claimed the one next to her, checking it beforehand for any potential critters.</p><p><br/>
With Larkin in the same space, you just never knew. (You only made the mistake of almost sitting on Samantha once.)</p><p><br/>
“Please tell me it’s not Snape.”</p><p><br/>
“Nope, not him. <em>Worse</em>.”</p><p><br/>
“Who could possibly be <em>worse</em>?” Sparrow wondered, carding her fingers through Empress Cat’s soft fur.</p><p><br/>
Severus Snape considered them the female Marauders and treated them similarly to the Gryffindor foursome - with hatred and utter disdain.</p><p><br/>
They were <em>mourning</em> his loss.</p><p><br/>
It was fifth year, Lily Evans would have him under control for a little while more - having him as a prefect would have been preferable to who they’d ended up with instead.</p><p><br/>
Kestrel groaned. “<em>Rookwood</em>.”</p><p><br/>
Even Amelia grimaced with distaste at the mention of the boy.</p><p><br/>
Theodore Rookwood was a complete ass. He bullied younger students, had a thing for ‘flirting’ with all three of the trio, and there were rumors to the effect of him having sexually assaulted several girls.<br/>
From all Houses. Of any blood status - though never the rich pure blooded ones.</p><p><br/>
“Who the fuck thought that was a good idea?” Sparrow asked, glaring at a spot on the wall.</p><p><br/>
“Slughorn,” both Kestrel and Larkin said, completely synchronized.</p><p><br/>
“Why haven’t we gotten him fired yet?”</p><p><br/>
“Because he’s useful and easily manipulated,” Kestrel offered, resting the side of her face against the window. Hedda cuddled closer.</p><p><br/>
In the background, Amelia heaved a quiet sigh, but didn’t even try to correct them.</p><p><br/>
Larkin whispered something to Samantha, who… stuck her head up the neck of her shirt, which solved the mystery of where the reptile was currently lurking.<br/>
Everyone politely pretended not to notice the liberal sprinkling of death threats.</p><p><br/>
“And the other one?” Larkin asked once she was done venting to her scaly little friend.</p><p><br/>
“Josephine Flint.”</p><p><br/>
“Huh.” Larkin blinked. “Not as bad as it could have been. Flint can actually be decent when she wants to be.” She shrugged.</p><p><br/>
Which was surprising, considering that she was most likely Marcus Flint’s future aunt.<br/>
Maybe all the Dark Magic exposure - especially the Cruciatus - messed with your brain?</p><p><br/>
Sparrow really wasn’t tempted to experiment to confirm her theory. Some things were better left to mystery.</p><p><br/>
Not that close quarters with Walburga Black would make that any easier, if this betrothal ever came to fruition.</p><p><br/>
Larkin elbowed her. “I know that look; get your mind back out of the gutter!”</p><p><br/>
“Sorry.”</p><p><br/>
Amelia laughed and muttered something about mind-reading everyone else politely pretended not to hear.</p><p><br/>
“You can contemplate the advantages of your betrothed’s butt at length later.”</p><p><br/>
“He’s a gangly idiot kid who likes to hang around with future criminals. No thanks.”</p><p><br/>
Kestrel threw herself onto the bench and regretted it - trains in the Seventies were not particularly comfortable. Cushioning charms were a must. “Amelia, we’re going to plot until I have to go on patrol. If you want plausible deniability-”</p><p><br/>
Amelia all but disapparated.</p><p>“Huh,” Larkin said with slightly wide eyes before she closed the compartment’s door with a flick of her wand and cast the needed locking charms and privacy spells.</p><p><br/>
“And let’s go back to cuddling,” Kestrel added. “I missed you.”</p><p><br/>
“Missed you, too.”</p><p><br/>
Larkin cooed at them, making grabby hands in Kestrel’s direction and began to absently hum something under her breath the moment she got to wrap her friend up in a hug.</p><p><br/>
It was a wonderful way to spend their last few free hours in peace.</p><p><br/>
Before they’d have to worry about images, reputations, or kids with fucked up ideologies out for other kids’ blood.</p><p><br/>
It would have to be enough, to last them until Christmas.</p>
