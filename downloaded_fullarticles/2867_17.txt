    <p align="center">There is whipped cream on the end of Sirius Black’s nose.</p><p>It’s been there since his first helping of Christmas pudding and it adds, he thinks cheerfully, to the whole charm of the moment; the gently dissolving snow falling from the ceiling, the floating candles in red, green and gold and the contrast of the dark, cold night outside with the general buzz of festive excitement inside where the Hall is warm and crowded with well-fed and well-humoured students, brim-full of sweets and the kind of bursting happiness that only comes with the winding-down of the calendar year and all the festivities therein. As he goes cross-eyed looking down the line of his aristocratic nose towards it, he is obscenely aware that he is one of the very few – maybe the <em>only</em>, even – students who can turn getting whipped cream on his face into an accolade of personality so powerful and irresistible that eventually everyone will become suckered into it. <em>By the end of the meal, </em>he tells himself happily, <em>everyone will be putting whipped cream on the end of their noses: “Oh, Sirius!” they will say “You are so whipped and creamy!”</em></p><p>He throws his head back and starts laughing.</p><p>“You know, you laugh like a madman.” Remus, when he speaks, gets a little wrinkle at the end of <em>his</em> nose that Sirius thinks would be much improved by cream of any kind, and would have suggested it if he weren’t laughing so much “I swear, one day we’re going to see that maniacal laugh on the cover of The Prophet under the heading ‘Ministry’s latest arrests.’”</p><p>Remus pauses, but when Sirius fails to stop cackling he adds: “Sirius? Whatever is so funny?”</p><p>Sirius laughs even louder at that. He is vaguely aware that around him, Gryffindor sixth years are shooting him oddly bemused looks, but even that only tickles him further. Already full of more <em>good cheer</em> and <em>goodwill to all men</em> than any boy of sixteen should be capable of, there is just something about the way Remus’ face wrestles between looking confused and disturbed that is <em>seriously the funniest thing ever</em>. Sirius’ stomach is practically crumbling over how funny it is. <em>His face!</em> Sirius’ brain screams at him: <em>look at his face!</em></p><p>“It’s no good, Moony” James pipes up from across the table over a mouthful of mince pies “we’ve lost him to the voices inside his head – <em>you</em> know how he gets. Frightful. Before too long he’ll start a rousing chorus of Ring the Hogwarts Bell and then: the hornpipe.”</p><p>“Like last year, with all the stomping and the broken glasses.” Adds Peter.</p><p>“Oh, Merlin,” Remus says, suddenly remembering, “And the firewhiskey and the mistletoe and those three Ravenclaw girls in the broom cupboard….”</p><p>“He almost set the common room on fire, you know.”</p><p>“Nearly-headless Nick nearly lost his head…..”</p><p>“<em>And</em> he threw up in a helmet.”</p><p>“Gentlemen! Such exaggerations!”</p><p>Sirius knows that he can’t really help himself. He feels that if were he to stop, he would pop and spray the whole bench with glitter and baubles and cherry brandy and party streamers and little bits of paper with jokes written on them that no one would really understand, and that would make <em>such a mess</em>; Moony would have his head.</p><p>“I never did such a thing; I threw up on Snape’s potions homework and he shouldn’t have left it just <em>lying around</em> in Proffer Slughorn’s office when I had a hankering for that apricot liquor he keeps locked in his desk <em>and besides which</em> those glasses were already broken.”</p><p>Sirius fixes James with a wicked, knowing look and wiggles his eyebrows.</p><p>“<em>And</em> I wasn’t the only one singing and dancing through the corridors into the wee hours of the morning, eh Prongsie??”</p><p>“I have seen the error of my ways” James exclaims almost too loudly. He shoots a cautious eye down the table towards the Inevitable and fails spectacularly at being sly, but not even that can bother Sirius tonight. He knows when he has the upper hand. It’s in the <em>eyebrows</em>, he thinks. He wiggles them again and flashes James an I-know-you-better-than-that smile. Almost instantly, James caves. Sirius knows that he is secretly delighted to.</p><p>“Alright,” James says as his own smile tugs at his lips, “Two choruses and a Christmas waltz – and then I say we take the party to Hogsmead this year, because we can.”</p><p>Sirius whoops and claps hands with him across the remnants of chocolate pudding and the cream that Peter had spilled earlier.</p><p>“Three cheers for James Potter, mastermind of Grand Ideas!” he announces and then fixes Remus and Peter with looks of their own, pointing a finger at them each in turn.</p><p>“That’s the kind of Christmas spirit I want to see from the both of you.” He winks and then slings an arm casually around Remus’ neck and ruffles his hair.</p><p>“You know, you kissed Kingsley last year. On the lips. His face looked like thunder. I’m not doing <em>that</em>. But alright.” Peter acquiesces and then as an afterthought reaches for another mince pie.</p><p>Sirius smirks, satisfied but not surprised with winning them over. It’s not like he was going to have much of a problem, anyway. Each year it’s the same – some faint, hardly passable form of protest just for propriety, and then faster than you could say Snape Sucks Cock the four of them are stealing mulled wine from the staff room and kick starting their week the way only a marauder can, morning classes be damned. It’s only ever Remus who’s genuinely a bit reluctant. Sirius thinks it’s something to do with his mother and <em>not upsetting things</em>. Still, Sirius knows it’s in Remus regardless, like a dormant instinct awaiting permission. Sirius loves giving him permission. He’s going to give him permission right now. He turns his head towards Remus, who looks up at him from where he is sort of tucked – cosy, warm, close - into the crook of his shoulder, and waits for the objections. Remus catches Sirius’ eye. He has this <em>look</em>, as if he knows exactly what Sirius is thinking. It’s sort of evil, but also terribly exciting. Sirius is waiting for <em>but we’ve got transfiguration at nine</em> when Remus suddenly lifts up a hand and then with a swoop of his index finger wipes the cream off the end of Sirius’ nose, <em>because that’s just like him</em>.</p><p>“That’s just like you.” Sirius tells him. Remus gives him a wonky sort of smile.</p><p>It takes Sirius a while to notice the sudden hush that reluctantly settles over the Hall from the Hufflepuff table outwards. There’s nothing more to eat anyway, but Sirius doesn’t want it to stop just yet. Feasting is the first sanctity of Christmas tradition; something to be done keenly and taken seriously and to be eked out until the very last of the crumbs has been dismantled into even smaller crumbs. His arm, he thinks regretfully, was only just getting comfortable. He removes it anyway, when the line between Remus’ shoulder blades gets all tense as he starts to think things, Sirius guesses, like <em>everyone is looking </em>and <em>it feels inappropriate </em>and its only then, after realising that he’s making Moony uncomfortable, that Sirius looks up to see what’s going on.</p><p>It’s old Dumbledoodle, stood up in a rather self-satisfied way at his podium, eyeing them all with a curious expression. Even Sirius falls quiet at that, and waits. When the silence is adequate, Dumbledore starts.</p><p>“I trust you have all enjoyed this year’s Festive Feast, held traditionally on the last Monday before Christmas break in order to mark the beginning of a week of festivities and Christmas celebrations here at Hogwarts, before most of you will return home to your families for the remainder of the holidays.”</p><p>Here he stops and everyone claps. Sirius thinks that when he was younger, Dumbledore mustn’t have had much opportunity to celebrate Christmas, giving how mad for it he is now. Dumbledore holds up one hand and the clapping stops. <em>That’s power</em>, Sirius thinks darkly, grinning. Dumbledore starts again.</p><p>“This year we have outdone ourselves as teachers and harbingers of the Christmas Spirit and have planned a week of, I think, quite spectacular Christmas treats.”</p><p>More clapping. Resentfully, Sirius’ hands are beginning to sting. Above the noise, Dumbledore’s voice rings clear a third time.</p><p>“But what I am most proud of this year is the return of a tradition previously upheld by this institution that dates back to the days of its founding. Some years ago there was an…..incident of the <em>most</em> unfortunate kind….that brought about the postponing of this event until such a time as it could be deemed fit to return. I am glad to announce tonight that this year is such a time!”</p><p>A mummer of anticipation spreads throughout the hall. Sirius doesn’t fail to catch the little twitch that flutters James’ eyelid.</p><p>“Pads,” he whispers to Sirius out of the corner of his mouth without moving his head. They’re experts at this now, conversing covertly at every given opportunity, “What do you think he’s cracking on about?”</p><p>Sirius bites his lip and raises one eyebrow.</p><p>“Beats me,” he whispers back, “he’s got a look in his eye like he’s about to tell us he’s Father Christmas himself, mad old coot.”</p><p>“We will, of course, have to make some adjustments to the weeks schedule,” Dumbledore is now saying, “the details of which will be passed on to you by your House Prefects” – Sirius side-eyes Remus, who shrugs defensively looking even more confused than he did earlier – “who themselves will be informed as soon as those details have been arranged, but for now it is my great pleasure to announce to you all that here in this very hall, on Friday night, we will hold the return of the Yule Ball!”</p><p>A collective gasp fills the hall. Voices begin to circulate, friend turning to friend with exclamations of <em>Yule ball! wow! I can’t dance for toffee, you know! I haven’t anything to wear!</em> and even <em>what’s a Yule ball?</em> from some of the younger students. Talk quickly accumulates and soon the whole hall is thrumming with the loud noises of an equally excited and terrified student body. Sirius feels more than sees the three of them – Moony, Wormtail and Prongs – turn to look at him. He can’t help the grin that splits his face.</p><p>When Dumbledore raises his hands for silence this time, it takes notably longer for quiet to descend.</p><p>“I understand,” he says when he is eventually able to, “that this is rather short notice, but the decision – not undertaken lightly, you see – was made as soon as was feasibly possible, things being such as they are. Nonetheless, I have great faith in <em>all</em> of you and your many undeniable talents, as so many of you are so well versed in producing passable, if not rather successful, results at the very last moment, according to your esteemed professors.”</p><p>Somewhere under his bushy beard and his twinkling eyes, Sirius realises, Dumbledore is <em>taking the mick.</em></p><p>“However, in light of the shortness of available time, we will be extending your Hogsmeade shopping excursions to include Thursday, as well as Wednesday, afternoon. But for now, if you have any queries or would like to volunteer to take part in the preparations for the Ball, including but not limited to decorations, then please see you House Prefect. Prefects; meetings will be held tomorrow morning in the usual place and at the usual time. Well then, that is all for now! Enjoy your night!”</p><p>Dumbledore returns to the professors table with what looks suspiciously like a laugh and a fondness in his eyes for <em>youthful hormones</em> and <em>young love</em>, while behind him the rest of the Hall erupts into chaos.</p><p>“Oh my God,” James is saying, bugged eyed and gaping like a fish, “Oh my God. Oh my <em>God</em>.”</p><p>Once again, Sirius cackles.</p><p>“This is great!” he says enthusiastically, “This is <em>perfect</em>, this is <em>just what this holiday season needed</em>.”</p><p>“I wonder if he’s invited any other schools,” Remus says thoughtfully, “I mean, it’s the tradition, isn’t it? But….there’s no tournament. Tri-Wizard. So. But it <em>is</em> interesting, what do you suppose he meant by ‘an incident of the most unfortunate kind’?”</p><p>“Do you think a kid died?” Peter’s eyes have gone as wide as his round, flushed face, “There are all these stories you know, about things and things and, like, how things happened and even one time this kid died, but they still didn’t close the school.”</p><p>“Rumours and malicious lies,” Sirius answers, “This is going to be <em>brilliant</em>. Think about it; a ball! A ball! Punch to spike! Dancing! Wormtail; <em>mistletoe</em>.”</p><p>He rubs his hands together, taking the expression gleeful to obscene levels.</p><p>“Actually this school does have a rather, well, colourful history. I mean, there’s Moaning Myrtle, for one. And all that business with the chamber of secrets - that none of us has ever heard of, of course.”</p><p>Remus often gets distracted by things that are not relevant, or rather <em>not directly conductive to the point at hand</em>, and Sirius finds that he’s often called upon to yank him back into the present moment and the immediacy of <em>right now</em>. One day, Sirius fears, Remus will become so distracted by some trail of thought or interesting connotation that he will disappear from the present altogether and become forever lost to the back-passages of time where he will spend the rest of his days archiving the history that carried on without him. Sirius would be sad, if that happened. He grabs Remus’ shoulder and gives him a stern look.</p><p>“You two Nancy Drew’s are missing the point. Can’t you see what we’re talking about here? Moony, a <em>ball</em>. Think, man. Think of the opportunities. Oh, hello, James has gone purple.”</p><p>“Well,” Remus shrugs, “Only, it would have to have been a rather big thing, wouldn’t it, for them to postpone the Ball for so long? James, you look like you’re about to combust.”</p><p>James is the colour of poached beetroot. Unfortunately for all of them, they know exactly what’s coming. He makes a strangled sort of noise and then:</p><p>“Do you suppose……Lily….?”</p><p>“No.” Sirius says, firm but not without affection. He leans across the table and pats James consolably. He gets it – he <em>does</em> – thwarted love and all that, it’s just that in his opinion, there are so many better ways of going about it than turning all shades of mauve and looking like an overcooked vegetable.</p><p>“But I’ll tell you what I <em>do</em> think; I think mulled cider warms the soul, and they have barrels of it down at the Three Broomsticks.”</p><p>Sirius can feel it beginning already; the magic of the night ahead. It’s a peculiar kind of tingling in the air that feels like a spell in progress only <em>isn’t</em>, because it’s them – the four of them – warm and flush against the cold night, gluttons of pleasure with bellies full and jokes aplenty, smelling of cinnamon and oranges and the crisp fresh snow. It’s their ready laughter and their affectionate, easy rapport that’s steadfast, like the sun that rises. It’s the way that Sirius can tell, even despite the ever-present Evans problem, that they’re <em>happy</em>, all of them; happily drunk, happily christmassed, happily together because that’s what it means to have friends. Sirius knows he is a confusing mixture of extremes - swinging from extremely jubilant to extremely difficult at the drop of a hat – but it’s only because it all<em> means</em> something, deep down in quiet places inside him that he doesn’t visit that often where all he really wants is for everyone to be happy. The Blacks are not happy people, as a rule. They’re proud and refined and elegant and distant and nothing ever displaces even a single hair on their heads. Sirius wants to be displaced. He wants to be messy and tussled and to lose buttons and fall off things and acquire bruises and trip over Peter’s shoes and to smell the change in Remus’ bones and to get carpet burns and marks on his skin from James falling asleep on his stomach, because that’s what it means to live. That’s what it means to be <em>loved</em>.</p><p>He swings his hand back around Remus' neck, smiles at them all, sparkling and dashing, and raises his mug of pumpkin juice.</p><p>“What say you, gentlemen? Hmm? Onward to glory, and one more for the road?”</p><p>And they must get it, too, because they all lift their mugs and salute each other over the strewn remnants of too many desserts.</p><p align="center">~</p><p>Later, when they’re struggling back against freshly fallen snow and the sky is clear and littered with stars, Sirius thinks: <em>we’ve swapped places</em>. It’s late, but not <em>too</em> late, as the pub kicked them out at eleven, but it’s still rife with the thrill of being out on a school night, of defying the rules, and of the challenge of sneaking back in without waking anyone up. Remus is defiantly sober and has assumed the responsibility of leading Sirius back to Hogwarts. His arm is around his shoulders, guiding him this way and that like the rudder of a ship. Sirius grabs his hip and squeezes.</p><p>“Yooou,” he says, slurring, just about able to make out Moony’s face in the darkness, “Have me, in your arms. Ridiculous, you know. S’like we swapped skin.”</p><p>Somewhere on his right, Remus is thinking too much about it. Sirius can’t much help that, so he pats Remus on the hip instead.</p><p>“S’ok. I don’t mind. You can have my skin. Just wash it, on the weekends, and no leaving it about.”</p><p>They’re back at the school now, gaining on the hidden door at the bottom of Gryffindor tower that they found back in third year. In front of them, James whips around and goes <em>shhhhh</em>.</p><p>“Even if you were making sense,” Remus is saying, helping Sirius to stand upright while Peter goes about poking the wrong bricks until he finds the right one, “I still wouldn’t understand you. It’s not like I’ve <em>asked</em> for anything.”</p><p>Sirius doesn’t understand him. Remus gets these ideas, he remembers, that apparently come from nowhere and that mostly leave him all confused. Sirius has never understood <em>why </em>he does it – who ever said anything about him asking for anything?! – but that’s Remus; always far away even when Sirius is tucked up under his shoulder, because he spends too much time thinking about all the things he thinks Sirius <em>hasn’t</em> said, instead of what he actually has. Sometimes, Remus talks to him like he’s an encyclopaedia. Sirius could say <em>why hello, Moony, what’s for breakfast</em> and Remus would answer <em>it’s not my fault that all the toast’s gone</em> because for some reason, Remus thinks he needs interpreting all of the time.</p><p>Sirius still likes him, though. And it isn’t just because he’s got his skin.</p><p>“No,” he smiles in the starlight and says goodnight to the forest and to the day that has passed, “But still, there you go. You have it.”</p><p> </p>
