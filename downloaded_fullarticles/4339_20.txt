    <p align="left">“Hermione!” Ginny called to her bushy-haired friend.<br/>
<br/>
Hermione raised her head from her book and saw Ginny walking towards her from the entrance of the Great Hall. She gave a weak smile and felt a small pool of dread fill in her belly—not for the arrival of her friend necessarily, but for the conversation that would inevitably follow. Ginny was her best friend and only a year below her, but Ginny had random bouts of madness that expressed itself in conversations about boys and gossip that Hermione honestly had to admit she found hard to be interested in. She'd much rather talk about homework.<br/>
<br/>
“How was the homecoming dance?” Ginny asked eagerly as she sat down in front of her.<br/>
<br/>
Any public event where Ginny had an opportunity to get dolled up and wear her best robes or dance with boys quickly sent the redhead into a tizzy that could rival either Patil sister…not that Hermione was degrading Ginny. She wasn’t. Honestly, Hermione could envy how much fun Ginny had when Hermione’s greatest adventures were what she could read in her books. The tragedy of it all was that it was Hermione who had the boyfriend. A fellow prefect named Terry Boot who Hermione found common interests with and yet she felt herself uninterested in topics concerning such relationships or even the subtlest pangs or dread at at the conversation. She found it quite frustrating how different she felt to all her peers in that respect.<br/>
<br/>
“Don’t look at me like that,” Ginny snapped irritably as she grabbed a bagel. “You know I like to dance.”<br/>
<br/>
With boys.<br/>
<br/>
With lots and lots of boys. The unspoken words brought a sad smile to Hermione’s lips. Ginny loved boys first, and Hermione loved her books best.<br/>
<br/>
“Well…” She said slowly, “I assume the dance was like any other dance, not that I would know. I’ve never been to one of these before.”<br/>
<br/>
Hogwarts held an annual homecoming dance just for seventh year students. Of course younger years could attend if they had a seventh year date, but Ginny’s older brother had scared off all her potential suitors much to her disappointment.<br/>
<br/>
“Did you have fun?” Ginny asked. She recognized Hermione’s words as a verbal sidestep to the true answer.<br/>
<br/>
“Hmmm,” Hermione sighed. “I guess. I mean, what should I have expected? Terry had all of his friends there, so….It’s not really my type of event anyway.” There was a reason that Hermione really liked her books first. They could feed her passion and knowledge at the same time where as with boys; she suddenly felt a disconnection and awkwardness. But Terry who was sorted into Ravenclaw had seemed just like her. She had met him when they both reached for the special edition of 'Hogwarts: A History' in the library last year. She felt the spark and the rest was history. She giggled at her pun while Ginny sent her a strange look.<br/>
<br/>
“Well it can’t have been so bad,” Ginny said, “You’re smiling now…unless—you didn’t sleep with him, did you?” Ginny asked her eyes wide.  <br/>
<br/>
Hermione quickly shook her head. "Ginny!" She admonished.<br/>
<br/>
“Then why the wide smile?” She asked.<br/>
<br/>
“I was just having a thought to myself,” Hermione said. “Why would you assume I gave up my virginity?”<br/>
<br/>
“Well…it was either that or you broke up with him and eloped with your Arithmancy textbook. Either one seemed to suggest sex,” Ginny teased her.<br/>
<br/>
“You are disgusting,” Hermione sighed. “And I would never ruin a book in the manner of which you are suggesting.”<br/>
<br/>
“True,” Ginny agreed. “So...does this mean you broke up with him?”<br/>
<br/>
“No,” Hermione sighed. “Stop with the assumptions. And why are my options to sleep with him or break up with him? Anyway, I thought you liked him?”<br/>
<br/>
“Assumptions-smumptions! And I do like him just fine. I actually think you should hold on to him,” Ginny said. “He’s like the male version of you. Studious, serious knowledge-aholic, and...All that over-achiever stuff you enjoy. You’ll never find another like him.”<br/>
<br/>
“We’re not this boring couple you make us out to be,” Hermione said defensively. “We do romantic things sometimes. I was actually able to squeeze one dance in last night before I lost him to his friends.”<br/>
<br/>
“Lost him to his friends?” Ginny asked confused. “He ditched you?”<br/>
<br/>
“Well not so much…I saw him throughout the evening. I can understand wanting to see your friends though,” she explained. "This being the beginning of our final year and all."<br/>
<br/>
“But you’re his girlfriend,” Ginny said. “And this was a dance!"<br/>
<br/>
Hermione shook her head earnestly, “But, it ended up alright, I guess. I’m not really into dancing or all those ridiculous activities. I left early, anyway, just in time to see my newspapers get delivered from the printers. I set them up outside the Great Hall this morning. Today’s the first edition ever for the Hogwarts Daily. It’s a look at summer and homecoming preparations…” She stopped talking as she caught Ginny turning her head away, “What is it?”<br/>
<br/>
“Nothing,” Ginny mumbled.<br/>
<br/>
“What is it, Ginny?” Hermione asked seriously. “Why did you do have that shifty look on your face?”<br/>
<br/>
“I knew I shouldn’t have bought you that book on how to read body language for your birthday,” Ginny half-hardheartedly joked.<br/>
<br/>
“Ginny,” Hermione demanded, “Just tell me. You’ll feel better afterwards, I promise.”<br/>
<br/>
“Fine,” She sighed. “The newspaper, It’s a new project and all so don’t be upset,” Ginny paused at Hermione’s perplexed expression. “No one’s interested in it. The word isn't good...and no one’s even picked up a copy.”<br/>
<br/>
“What?” Hermione gaped, “How could no one want to catch up on current events in the school?”<br/>
<br/>
Ginny only shrugged. “I’ve just heard kids talking about it earlier…and to be fair it's not really the current events in school kids want to hear about.”<br/>
<br/>
"Changes to N.E.W.T. Testing regulations aren’t interesting? This information can make or break your career!" Hermione's snapped. "What could they possibly want if not that?"<br/>
<br/>
"Oh, Hermione," Ginny giggled. "Current events that everyone cares about are whether or not Padma Patil will get back together with her ex? That sorta stuff."<br/>
<br/>
"Gossip?" Hermione groaned. "I feel so alienated in this school."<br/>
<br/>
Ginny stared at Hermione who looked so sad and pathetic. “There's still a chance to turn it around.”<br/>
<br/>
"By publishing gossip?" Hermione said and stood up. "I have to see this for myself. Not even a single copy?"<br/>
<br/>
She walked out of the Great Hall and Ginny followed. Their sudden departure caused many heads to turn.<br/>
<br/>
Hermione didn’t know what she expected when she stood outside the doors but three stacks of neatly pressed newspapers still tied up was not it. She hoped Ginny had been exaggerating. The girl was known to over exaggerate but still, the truth shown and not a single paper had been taken.<br/>
<br/>
Ginny came out a few moments later and stood beside her.<br/>
<br/>
“Hermione, I’m sorry,” Ginny said.<br/>
<br/>
“Not a single one,” Hermione mumbled.<br/>
<br/>
There were footsteps behind the two that rushed hastily towards them. The two turned around to see Ron Weasley, Ginny’s older brother, run over to them. He didn’t even acknowledge either girl as he pulled out his wand. He cut the bindings around the first stack of papers. Hermione felt her heart rise.<br/>
<br/>
‘Finally,’ she thought, ‘someone wants to read it...even if it is Ron Weasley.’ He grabbed about half the stack.<br/>
<br/>
“Ron?” Ginny asked suspiciously. She had a bad feeling. Ron barely ever read anything, which include homework assignments, potion ingredient labels, clothes tags, and least of all newspapers so why would he need so many papers?<br/>
<br/>
He turned around and smiled, “Oh, hey, Ginny,” he said.<br/>
<br/>
“Why do you need that many?” She asked suspiciously as she eyed the load he carried.<br/>
<br/>
“Oh,” Ron looked down at the papers he was holding, “Neville flooded the bathroom and, we…uh,” He blushed, “Can’t remember the cleaning spell.”<br/>
<br/>
Hermione felt her hopes get crushed and anger replace it. She walked over to Ron and grabbed the stack of newspapers from his arms. She glared at him, “Its ‘Scourgify’.”<br/>
<br/>
Ron looked at her funny. Hermione never gotten along with him or any of his friends. You would think of all their years spent in the same classes and same house they would have had developed some level of tolerance for each other but no. The dislike between them was so strong that she should've known better. Of course he would not be the fist person to express genuine interest in her paper and of course he would want to use it to clean up a bathroom flood: An actual rag.<br/>
<br/>
The antagonism began in their first year from what she perceived to be on his end. For some reason he always seemed to find it distasteful to be in her presence, so much so that sometimes when she was simply near some of his friends, he would come and drag them away from her. That was the main reason why Hermione was so lonely. But she did have Ginny and now Terry.<br/>
<br/>
“Whatever,” he mumbled casting a dark look at her before he rushed back to the tower.<br/>
<br/>
“‘Whatever’,” Ginny mimicked in a mockingly deep voice.<br/>
<br/>
“Let’s just go to class,” Hermione sighed, feeling defeated.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="center">* * *</p><p align="left"><br/>
<br/>
Ginny and Hermione separated further down the hall. Ginny went up the stairs to the second floor to attend charms while Hermione rushed all the way to the fifth floor just in time to be five minutes early to her transfiguration class. Hermione sat in the second row and took out her book, a roll of parchment, black ink, and an eagle feather quill. She also placed her wand on the binding of the book and neatly placed her hands in her lap.<br/>
<br/>
A few minutes later a throng of giggling Hufflepuffs entered the room. They walked past Hermione and took their seats near the window. She watched them idly, smiling when one of them told a joke she found funny.<br/>
 <br/>
Not long after, a group of boys, Hermione recognized as Ron and his friends walked into the classroom. They were talking in low whispers with their heads bent close together. As they walked by, Hermione saw Ron slightly nod his head in her direction then mumble something about bossy-know-it-alls.<br/>
<br/>
She felt her face flush and turned her gaze away. They walked past her and took their seats at the back of the room. The last to enter the room was Professor McGonagall. She swept into the room and stood by the desk. The class focused their attention on the graying woman as she stood with her back straight, demanding attention, and with the fiercest look in her eye that Hermione had ever seen.<br/>
<br/>
“Class,” She began, “Today, as my expectations have not changed, I expect you to pay closer attention because the magic we are learning today demands focus, talent, and competence.” She looked around the room. “The spell I will teach you is called ‘Sunor Ot Celfer’. Now who can tell me what this spell does?” She looked around her classroom, “Anyone?”<br/>
<br/>
Hermione recognized that spell. She raised her hand slowly. She had read about it in the library when she was researching information on Ramona Ragmuff, A medieval witch who turned her cheating husband into a beard-shaving woman for a week. She shuddered. The book had shown a painting done of the husband when he had been cursed. Hermione had found the transformation fascinating and memorable. The spell name, Sunor Ot Celfer, actually meant ‘Reflector on us’ which would be the opposite physical reflection of an object or in Mr. Ragmuff’s case, ‘opposite’ would be his gender.<br/>
<br/>
“Yes, Miss Granger,” McGonagall called, “What can you tell us about the spell?”<br/>
<br/>
“It would change you into the opposite sex of yourself,” She answered, “Not your personality but just your physical appearance.” She blushed when she heard a few classmates giggle.<br/>
<br/>
"Curious, Granger?" She heard Ron whisper.  She fought a frown.<br/>
<br/>
“Correct, 5 points to Gryffindor,” McGonagall said. "I will now demonstrate.” She pointed her wand at herself, closed her eyes and recited, “Tonma Itahw Tubma Iohw Tonmai.”<br/>
<br/>
Her body lit up by a golden light that died down just as quickly as it appeared. Instead of the severe looking female teacher with long black hair pulled back into a tight bun and sharp eyes that they were used to, there now stood a severe looking male teacher with short black hair greying at the sides.<br/>
<br/>
He opened his mouth and explained with a deep voice, “Tonma Itahw tubma Iohw Tonmai, means I am not who I am but what I am not.”<br/>
<br/>
Hermione, like much of her peers were quite shocked by this point. Hermione, clearly the most familiar with this spell out of the students, was taken with how much this man still resembled her head of house and that such a powerful and nuanced transformation could be completed by one simple spell.<br/>
<br/>
Their teacher pointed the wand at himself and repeated the incantation. At once the golden light appeared and their female teacher returned.<br/>
<br/>
“Now, we will practice the incantation. Once you all begin that,” she spoke now in her normal voice. “You will notice nothing will happen. This spell holds no wand movement but true raw intent. To do it you must clear your mind and focus. Just let the words take over.” She looked around the room. “Despite that this spell may seem like wandless magic, the wand is required all the same to channel the spell. Now I want you to practice the pronunciation.” she repeated the words slowly several times to allow the students to pronounce it correctly and it took the entire class period for less than half the class to say it right.<br/>
<br/>
Hermione exited the classroom and walked quickly to her next lesson: charms. Professor Flitwick was one of her favorite teachers so she immensely enjoyed the lesson. She was partnered with Neville Longbottom as they reviewed several charms. Charms, as a common practice of magic, was one of the largest sections on the N.E.W.T.s and therefore Flitwick began reviews before most other teachers.<br/>
<br/>
Hermione breezed through the class with minimal effort, though as the year continued she was sure this class would take up more of her attention. Thoughts of N.E.W.T.s made her think of her failure of a newspaper launch. Maybe she was in over her head. Clearly what she was interested in writing wasn't what her peers were interested in reading. Could she juggle this with her classes? Should she?<br/>
<br/>
In no time, the class was already dismissed and students were pouring down to the Great Hall for lunch. Hermione, though, couldn't shake thoughts of her newspaper failure and walked to her head of house’s office. She knocked timidly.<br/>
<br/>
“Come in,” McGonagall answered. Hermione entered the room and saw the woman sitting behind her desk with papers scattered around her. She glanced up when Hermione entered. “Good morning, Miss Granger.”<br/>
<br/>
“Good morning, Professor,” Hermione repeated. McGonagall made one last mark on a paper she appeared to be grading before she redirected her attention on Hermione. She shuffled things around her desk and folded her hands.   <br/>
    <br/>
“Professor,” Hermione started, cutting straight to the chase, “Hogwarts Daily isn’t moving. And while I love writing, I’m not sure I can appreciate this as a worthwhile activity. I’ve thought of this today and I’m wondering if I should even continue with the paper. I’m starting to wonder if it is just is a waste of time.”<br/>
    <br/>
She felt bad for giving up, but all her efforts in publishing a newspaper could be focused on studying for N.E.W.T.S. If no one wanted to catch up on important topics then who was she to keep publishing?<br/>
<br/>
“Miss Granger, in no time of history has writing a newspaper ever been a waste of time,” McGonagall said. She looked at Hermione’s eager face. “Maybe you should try spicing it up a little, writing a story that will appeal to the teenage nature, a headline article that will hold the interest of the school and fit in the educational articles where you please.”<br/>
<br/>
“Teenage nature?” Hermione asked. Gossip. Ginny was right. “I don’t think it’s in the teenage nature to read,” she said meanly.<br/>
<br/>
“Plenty of publications advertise to teenagers,” McGonagall said fairly. “Now I know you're not the type to quit so I won't accept your resignation as chief editor of the Hogwarts Daily.” She smiled at her. “I know you'd regret this.”<br/>
<br/>
Hermione lowered her head in shame.<br/>
<br/>
“I know you can do better. You're a very clever witch, Miss Granger, so give it some thought and I'm sure you will realize how to turn the paper around.”<br/>
<br/>
“You really think I can connect to the students of Hogwarts?” She asked.<br/>
<br/>
“Are you not one yourself?” She asked.<br/>
<br/>
“Yes, but I'm not…” Hermione blushed, hating that she felt so alienated from them but realized she didn't want to dump her problems on her teacher, and a teacher who had faith in her. “You're right. I'll figure something out.”<br/>
<br/>
“Now that that is decided I must return to marking these homework assignments. You should return to lunch.”<br/>
<br/>
Hermione nodded, though this conversation left her feeling no better and with no answers. She awkwardly turned towards the door when her teacher called back to her: “Oh and Miss Granger.” She held up a marked essay. “You're a wonderful writer. I enjoy your points on organic to inorganic transformations. Don't be dissuaded by your little setback. Great accomplishments are never easy.”<br/>
<br/>
“Thank you, Professor,” Hermione said.</p>
