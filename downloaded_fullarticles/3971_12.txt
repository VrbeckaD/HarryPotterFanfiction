          <div class="userstuff"><p>Two grown men with two ruined lives 12 years apart, holding each other at arms length with hard, hard hands. They couldn’t talk, not in front of the children; they couldn’t take the time, not knowing what they knew about Peter. But in all honesty, what would they say? What <em>could</em> they say, in that moment? </p><p>The hug in the Shrieking Shack was so many things. It was, ‘I love you’, it was ‘how could you’, it was ‘I missed you’, it was ‘I’m sorry I’m so sorry God I’m so sorry.’ It was ‘I was wrong’ and ‘how could I ever’, it was ‘so much time, gone’ and ‘I wish I could have waited’. It was ‘it could have been so different’ and ‘how could you leave me’. </p><p>It was ‘I almost lost you.’</p><p>Almost. But not quite. </p></div>
