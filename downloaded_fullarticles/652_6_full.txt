  <p>Remus lowered his eyes when he noticed Professor Tullius looking at him again. Maybe the Defense against the dark arts professor knew what Remus was and was fascinated by dark creatures. The Professor was new and have only been teaching their fifth year for a few months.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>When the bell sounded, Remus started throwing his things into his bag quickly but the Professor was there before he could get away.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>'Mr. Lupin'. Said his teacher. 'Can I talk to you for a moment?'</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Remus sighed.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>'Of course, Professor.'</p>
</div><div>
  <p>He observed his friends leave the class when he noticed that Snape had stopped by the door. Their eyes met for a moment, which was interrupted by the professor.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>'That will be all, Mr.Snape. Close the door after you leave.'</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Remus was surprised to see Snape glaring at the Professor. He was a sour and difficult guy but he never blatantly disrespected teachers like that.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>After a tense long moment, Snape left and closed the door none too gently.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Professor Tullius turned to Remus with his customary kind smile. 'Please sit.'</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Remus did so reluctantly, waiting for the other to do the same on his own desk as he had always done but he had moved to the student desk next to Remus' and pulled his chair closer to the boy.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>'Mr.Lupin... Can I call you Remus when we are alone?'</p>
</div><div>
  <p>'Of course.' Said Remus, not feeling like he had the right to deny a teacher that.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>'I know how difficult things are for you. I must say, I really admire your fortitude in life despite your challenges.'</p>
</div><div>
  <p>So he knew, just like he thought - mused Remus. He only nodded, still waiting to see what the Professor wanted.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>'You know, I've studied dark creatures more than anything than you can imagine. If there is anything I can do for you or there is anything you'd like to ask, feel free to do so.'</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Remus almost jumped out of his skin when the Professor put his hand over his knee and didn't know how to react. He only nodded and made a loud noise as he pulled his chair and moved as far away as he could from the man. 'T... thank you.' He said, not really knowing why he was so nervous.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Professor Tullius nodded and returned to his desk as if dismissing Remus. 'Don't forget your homework and to study for the quiz I'll be giving in the next class.'</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Remus observed the teacher gathering his parchments for a moment. 'Yes, sir.' And then left the class.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>At the common room, he found Sirius sitting sprawled on the sofa with his hand over a seventh year's shoulder and he wondered for the hundredth time how it was that his friend got anyone he wanted, even older girls.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>James was reading a quidditch magazine excitedly and Remus threw himself beside him on another sofa. Peter - as always - was nearby James, admiring his friend and always looking like he couldn't believe how lucky he was to be accepted by him.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Remus was eating breakfast a few days later when Sirius stopped chewing to complain. 'God damn Snivellus, always watching and following us to get us into trouble.' At his last word, some of what Sirius was eating flew over Remus' plate.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>'Hey!' He complained but Sirius was staring at the Slytherin's table as he did it so often and didn't notice.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Remus followed Sirius' gaze only to find that Snape was looking at him and so looked down quickly. Snape made him nervous.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>'Leave him alone, Sirius.' He snorted and drank some of his pumpkin juice. He was so tired of his friends' obsession with Snape.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>'We'll get him, Sirius.' Said James, chewing his own food with a malicious glint in his eyes.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>'You will leave him alone.' Came a voice that sounded like bells. Remus turned to see Lilly staring at James with fury.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>He hid a smirk. Now, James wouldn't do anything while Lilly was paying attention. He was sure that she was the only girl James would never have, unlike the many others who worshipped the ground he walked upon. Maybe that was her secret.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>'I was just joking.' James said with his most innocent look that didn't fool anyone.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>0o0</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Remus was thankful to have someone who looked out for him in Hogwarts, but Professor Tullius made him feel uncomfortable sometimes like at that moment when he had asked him to stay after class again. It was becoming more and more common but he didn't want any special treatment for being a werewolf, despite his challenges - as Professor Tullius always liked to mention.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>'Yes, sir?' He asked without being able to fully hide his impatience.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>'I was just wondering, my boy, if you'd like to have extra classes with me. I have free time every night if you'd like.'</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Remus stared at Professor Tullius, frowning. The last thing he wanted was to be seen as a teacher's pet. Did he pity him? Is that why he was always looking out for him and offering favors?</p>
</div><div>
  <p>'Defense against the dark arts is my best subject, sir. I don't need any extra classes.' Remus smiled shyly and then started to lift his bag over his shoulder.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>'Anything else then? You need someone watching out for you. It's not easy to go through what you face. I really admire your strength.'</p>
</div><div>
  <p>'Uh... thanks.' Remus said awkwardly. 'If there is anything, I'll be sure to ask you, sir.'</p>
</div><div>
  <p>'Ok.' Professor Tullius smiled benignly and accompanied him towards the door and opened it. 'Just remember, my boy, that you are not alone.'</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Remus looked down and nodded but felt a hand on his chin and looked up sharply. Professor Tullius' smile broadened and then he removed his hand, only to push Remus dirty blonde fringe behind his ear.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Remus blinked and almost recoiled before he stopped himself. He never wanted to offend anyone and had thought that others were supposed to feel disgusted by him, not the other way around.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>His parents weren't much to show signs of affection, although he knew he was loved. He knew since he was 4, however, that he was a burden and a nuisance and always felt insecure and unsure about himself, making him shy. Being in the shadows of the two most popular and handsome boys in the entire school aggravated his problem even more.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>'Have a good night and sweet dreams.' the Professor said when Remus left the classroom.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Lost in thought, Remus walked staring at the floor and not seeing where he was going until he almost collided with a black shadow, making his heart almost come out of his throat.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>'Lupin.' Said Snape stiffly.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Remus' jaw dropped. His blue eyes widened as he stared at the Slytherin who, until that moment, had never talked to him before.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>He cleared his throat and almost choked on his own saliva. 'Snape.' He said with a tiny choked voice that embarrassed him to no end.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Snape seemed to look over his shoulder. Then back at him. 'Are you... Is everything alright?'</p>
</div><div>
  <p>'Urr... Err...' Remus tried. Snape intimidated him. He always knew the boy to be James and Sirius' enemy, the one who knew how to take care of himself and knew more dark curses than any other student. He worried the Slytherin was going to take advantage that he was alone to exact revenge on him. There was no way that he could win Snape in a duel. The boy could take the other three Marauders single-handedly. Remus never participated but he couldn't stop his friends from harassing Snape either.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>'Did something happened?' Snape asked sternly.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>'Happened where? When?' Remus asked stupidly.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>'In Professor Tullius class.' Snape barked, impatiently.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>'What?' Remus blinked as he tried to understand what the hell he meant. 'Nothing happened... You were there, what are you talking about?'</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Snape looked at him intently, then shook his head as if he meant nothing and moved away, leaving a very puzzled Remus behind.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>0o0</p>
</div><div>
  <p>The hectic school days continued with more offerings of help from Professor Tullius, his friends' pranks on Snape, lots of studying, gossip and new couples getting together and breaking up.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Sirius had already dumped the older girl and was shagging a fourth year now, being boisterous and a jerk about it.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Remus felt increasingly guilty for not being able to stop James and Sirius from tormenting Snape but the Slytherin wouldn't back down and provoked them as well. He was always a sight to behold in his fury and Remus couldn't help but admire his stubbornness and fearless demeanor.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>One day, he didn't even bother to put away his things as he knew that Professor Tullius would want to talk to him after class as he always did. James and Sirius were teasing him about being the teacher's pet but he didn't have the courage to tell them that the man made him feel uncomfortable. Professor Tullius didn't look too old but wasn't young enough to feel like he was a friend so Remus didn't like talking to him so much.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>'Sit, Remus.' The Professor said, making Remus regret allowing the man to use his first name.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>'So...' The teacher said while sitting on the chair beside Remus' when everyone left. 'I thought you were having a little trouble with today's class.'</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Remus tried to sigh silently. He had understood the lesson perfectly well. Without arrogance, he would even say that he was the best Dark arts student in his class. Well, not better than Snape actually, but probably second best.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>'I really want you to let me help you.' Professor Tullius rested his big and warm hand over Remus knee, making him squirm.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>'Uh... Professor. I am thankful but...'</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Suddenly, Professor Tullius' other hand grabbed the back of Remus' neck and he froze as he was pulled forward to face his teacher up close.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>'Listen to me, little boy. I've been kind but you are really testing my patience.'</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Remus' eyes widened and he tried to pull away, not understanding what was happening and realizing suddenly how much stronger than him the man was.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>'What do you want?' He choked on his fear, making his voice come out in a murmur.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>'You, boy. I want you.'</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Remus frowned and when understanding rushed in, he felt weak. Panic was overtaking his body. He slowly realized what the Professor meant but a part of him couldn't believe it.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>'You are my teacher!' He squeaked.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>'Enough talk.' Professor Tullius said. The Professor pulled the boy up, then quickly turned him around and threw him over the desk.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>'Get off me!' He screamed, finally finding his voice due to rage but it was too late. The Professor bent his arm behind his back and he thought it would snap. He felt hands trying to undo his belt as he screamed in horror as he felt his Professor's heavy body fall over him, making it impossible for him to breathe or leave.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>That's when he realized that a loud bang was sounding at the door like someone was banging at it for some time but he had been too caught up to pay attention. He turned to look, as did the man and it was with hope for a miracle that he saw that the door was releasing smoke, for whatever reason.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>'What the hell?' Whispered his Professor as he moved to the door, wand drawn.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Remus wasted no time before drawing his own wand. The door flew open in a bang before he could curse his teacher, however, and the man flew back across the class.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Snape looked like some curse creature from hell as he stood, framed by the door. Never a sight brought so much relief and joy to Remus. He was so shaken that he fell to the ground. Snape ran to him, helping him up and they escaped without looking back.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Remus soon recovered and ran unaided. He couldn't think straight and just followed Snape blindly. The Slytherin chose the boy's bathroom and entered it, closing the door silently after Remus followed behind. They entered a stall together and if the situation wasn't so dire he would have found funny that they tried to fit in together in a space not built to accommodate two teenage boys.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>They panted, trying to recover their breaths while holding their sides. Remus observed Snape's eyes moving around in a panic, his forehead frowned in deep thought. He seemed very alert and dangerous, like an animal who had been cornered.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>'What the hell was that?' Panted Remus. 'How did you know?'</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Snape looked at him and his black gaze hardened. Remus felt himself shrivel under that gaze and looked away.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>'The same was done to me.'</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Remus looked up sharply. His jaw dropped as he was overtaken by pity.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>'If you ever tell anyone. I'll kill you, your family and anyone else who finds out, do you understand? I could poison this entire school, then make me and a few others the survivors with little left in our systems and no one would ever find out who did it.'</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Remus grabbed his hand. 'I would never...ever!'</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Snape seemed to relax, not needing other reassurances, thankfully. What kind of awful person did Snape think he was? He could never tell something so private to anyone, especially someone as targeted and paranoid as Snape. The entire school would laugh at him, even though their Professor was in the wrong.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>'I am so sorry...' Remus started but shut his mouth when Snape sneered at him.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>'Don't you dare to pity me. I've been hurt before, at home by my father and your friends always make sure I don't have a day of peace in this god damn school. What Tullius did to me is different, but it's just violence all the same.'</p>
</div><div>
  <p>'What do we do?' Remus looked away so Snape couldn't see his eyes filling with tears. He had been so terrified when he felt the man drape himself over him that he couldn't imagine what Snape went through for not having anyone to stop the man in time.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>'Leave it to me.' Snape said, straightening himself proudly and confidently. 'No one will know.'</p>
</div><div>
  <p>'But the other students...'</p>
</div><div>
  <p>'Not students.' Snape said with disgust. 'Boys. He likes teenage boys. Not very young boys like firsties, he likes them a bit older like fourteen and fifteen-year-olds.'</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Remus looked at him in the dark light with horror. Only half of Snape's face was visible.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>'We need to tell Professor Dumbledore, he may attack someone else.' Remus said.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>'Didn't I said we are not going to tell anyone?' Snape snapped. 'I won't let anyone know what happened to me.'</p>
</div><div>
  <p>'But surely Professor Dumbledore...'</p>
</div><div>
  <p>'May want proof, which I don't have. He made sure of it. Until then, other students may be attacked by Tullius. I am dealing with it my own way.'</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Remus froze. 'What do you mean?'</p>
</div><div>
  <p>'Every time the bastard has an erection, something is happening to him. It won't be long now.'</p>
</div><div>
  <p>'Snape, what are you...'</p>
</div><div>
  <p>'This is my battle!' Snape's voice echoed throughout the toilet's walls.'</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Remus raised the palm of his hands in a gesture of peace.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>'Then let me help.'</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Snape shook his head. Remus saw his face contort before Snape lowered his head so he could hide under his hair.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Remus' heart clenched. He didn't care he was going to be hexed. On an impulse, he gathered the dark-haired boy into his arms and held him tightly.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>At first, Snape stiffened and tried weakly to get away. Then he slowly relaxed and soon, Remus felt him shaking a little and the sounds of wet sniffs.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>'It's going to be okay. Shh...'</p>
</div><div>
  <p>They held on to each other for a long time.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>And it was one of Remus' best nights of his life.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>0o0</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Over the weeks, Remus observed Tullius with trepidation, not for himself but for others. The Professor stopped asking him to stay after class, maybe to see if Remus was going to tell someone or not.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Remus would pass in front of his class whenever he could just to see if the door was closed. He planned on blasting it open if he ever found that the man was grooming another victim but it seemed that the Professor was being careful.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Professor Tullius would observe him from afar without daring to say anything to Remus.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Snape and he had met once more, late at night in the astronomy tower when Remus took the Marauder's Map with him so James, Sirius and Peter wouldn't see the Snape dot right beside him.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>The Slytherin told him that it seemed that Tullius observed his prey first before trying anything. He targeted brilliant, lonely or insecure boys who would be too afraid or ashamed to speak up.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>'He doesn't care about the face, only about the ass.' Snape said blatantly in his own way, making Remus sputter and choke on his own saliva.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>'What the hell? Why would you say that?'</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Snape just stared at him like he was an idiot and the answer was obvious. When Remus continued to look at him blankly, he rolled his eyes. 'I am ugly, aren't I?'</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Again Snape seemed to have the power to break Remus' heart.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>'You are wrong...' Remus said looking away into the night sky.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>He didn't have in him to look at Snape's expression and an awkward silence lodged itself between them for a long, uncomfortable moment.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>'Be careful with anything that you eat or drink.' Snape suddenly said before saying 'Night, Lupin.' in his brisk manner and leaving Remus there.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Remus had gone to bed feeling awful for the grey underpants incident that had happened a while back. He had wanted to intervene but didn't had the courage and ended up doing nothing. He had to do something to stop Sirius and James next time. Peter always went along with James but one look from Remus was enough to make the shorter boy doubt himself in shame. The others, however, were impossible to control.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>After being saved by Snape from such a horrible thing, he owed the other boy.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>As the weeks went by, Tullius looked sicker. The teachers were worried and one day, he collapsed in class. Remus felt his stomach clench. No matter what the man did to kids, he couldn't find in himself to be happy the man was dying. So that had been what Snape meant by taking care of things. He would, however, do anything in his power to help Snape. It was his revenge and he had the right to retaliate however he saw fit. He knew Snape was a force to reckon with.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Remus was surprised, however. He thought that the plan was to have Tullius exposed, somehow. Only when the teacher's health deteriorated did he realize that Snape intended to kill the man. He understood how angry and hurt Snape must have been, he had been the shoulder that the boy cried on, maybe for the first time since the rape. And if they couldn't prove what the man did, what then? What if he moved schools and went on doing the same to other boys?</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Remus hated to admit but Snape's reasoning was sound.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>He wished he could get closer to the boy but after those two encounters Snape didn't say anything about another meeting. They came to an understanding and Snape would give him tiny nods that were only perceptible because he observed the other boy a lot. He didn't want the rest of the Marauders to know that he and Snape became friends... or something. They probably would torment him even more if they knew.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>After being carried to St.Mungus one afternoon, Professor Tullius never got up again.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Snape wanted to meet him in the library when the Professor's death was announced. They 'talked' through quickly written notes.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Snape went beyond poisoning the man. He visited his room while Tullius stared at him wide-eyed. The poison Snape had fed him slowly rendered him speechless. He got sicker and sicker every time he had an erection, which Snape imagined it was when he looked at Remus, making the werewolf blush. At the hospital, Snape smirked at the grey, dying teacher and the gesture self-explanatory. He made sure the man died knowing who killed him.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>'Jeez, Snape. I don't know how you could do it.' Remus wrote and passed the note.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>After reading it, Snape raised his black eyes, giving him the shivers.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>'He destroyed my life. I destroyed his.'</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Remus read the note, his throat tightened. When he raised his eyes, he nodded and rested his hand over Snape's. From the corner of his eye, he noticed someone freeze at the entrance of the library and when he looked to see who it was, Remus felt a chill run down his spine with trepidation.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Sirius stared wide-eyed at their hands, his grey eyes stormy. Remus held his breath as Snape turned to look at what he was staring at.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Three days later, on the full moon, Snape was lured into the Marauder's most dangerous prank.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>0o0</p>
</div><div>
  <p>When Remus woke up on that morning, he was in pain like he never felt before. Moony had cut him everywhere and his shoulder seemed to have been dislocated. Involuntary tears began to fall as he wondered where his friends or Madame Pomfrey were. His friends or the mediwitch were there in the morning without fail.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>He must have passed out due to the pain or blood loss because when he woke up again, he was completely bandaged and at the hospital wing. His heart began to race as something felt really, really wrong. Despite the pain, he got up from the bed while tears started to fall again. He felt like a little child who was sick, all vulnerable and weak. No curtains were closed around the beds after the full moon. He was always, the only patient. Rarely someone stayed overnight or was there in the mornings. He walked towards a closed bed curtain before Madame Pomfrey came back and stopped him and then pulled it.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Snape was sleeping deeply. His whole face had bruises and wounds. His arms and chest had bandages here and there. Remus covered his mouth, horrified.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>He began to shake until he felt hands over his shoulder where there were no wounds. As he was turned, he stared into the kind eyes of the mediwitch. 'Rest, Mr.Lupin. You shouldn't be up yet.'</p>
</div><div>
  <p>But he couldn't sleep. He was horrified with the possibility of what might have happened the night before.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>He prayed he wasn't the one responsible for hurting Snape. He prayed that he hadn't turned the Slytherin, for that would be worse than anything James, Sirius and Peter did to him - all six years combined.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Hours later, when Snape began to stir, Remus ignored his pain and got up, feeling dizzy and almost falling from his bed.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>'Snape...Severus, please...'</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Snape looked around, terrified until his black eyes rested on Remus. There was no expression for a moment and then the sneer that was becoming more prevalent made itself known.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>'Please, Severus... What happened?'</p>
</div><div>
  <p>'Like you don't know... Beast.' Snape spat.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Remus eyes filled with tears and his face contorted with a pain worse than the physical agony he felt hours before.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>'I don't know what happened. Please, Severus, believe me.'</p>
</div><div>
  <p>As he spent hours staring at Snape's curtains and then connecting the dots - the rage in Sirius' eyes and all, he imagined what could have happened but he needed to hear the truth.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>'I'll never believe in you. After what I did for you...' Snape raged. 'I am so angry I could kill you right now.'</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Remus raised the palm of his hands in a gesture of peace and walked back towards his bed. 'Please... was it Sirius? Did he do something?'</p>
</div><div>
  <p>'So you know it was him. I wonder why.' Snape spat sarcastically.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Remus laid on his pillow and just started to cry silently. Snape snorted in disgust like he didn't believe in Remus' show of regret and turned away from him in bed. The werewolf tried to keep his sobs quiet to not bother the other even more.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Remus never hated himself more than that day.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>0o0</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Remus lost count how many times he tried to talk to Snape and apologize. The boy was even forced by Dumbledore to keep quiet. He realized that the Headmaster was trying to protect Remus but the way it all came out looked like nobody cared about how Snape felt. As Sirius and James sat with their heads down, Snape just stared at Remus with an anger beyond anything he'd seen the Slytherin show. It cut him deeply. He came to care for Snape since he had been saved by him but always found the Slytherin fascinating, even before the incident. It crushed him that their tentative friendship ended so abruptly.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Snape shot a glare to the Headmaster too before storming off, but he clearly blamed Remus above them all. Maybe he already had prejudices against werewolves. Who wouldn't? Remus always knew he was nothing more than a beast but to hear it spat on his face by someone he cared about was excruciating.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>His friendship with Sirius would never be the same again.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>He continued to run after Snape, whispering apologies, passing notes that Snape would burn beneath his desk. Remus - on his part - ignored Sirius' same attempts at apology. They had formed a strange triangle of people that were not speaking to each other but always walked together in a line.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>After many months, he finally started to talk to Sirius again - they shared a bedroom after all and his friend had been dogly loyal at all other times. Remus realized forgiving his animagus friend was a mistake when Snape realized it during Potions and would have killed Remus with his black look if he could. He couldn't help but shed tears in the toilet on that day.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>He knew the Slytherin didn't have real friends and Remus had been eager to be a real one to him. Snape needed him. His loneliness had made him a target of the Marauders and later on, a teacher. He wanted to be there for Snape.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Only when it was too late and the friendship broken beyond repair, did he realize as he stared at Snape passing him by as if he didn't exist that he loved him. For the first time in his life, he not only knew for certain that he liked boys but who. It brought him despair like he never knew before.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>On the last day of school, he tried hard to talk to Snape on the train. He not only suspected that the Slytherin had become a Death Eater but worse of all, that Remus was the one to drive him into it. Snape was so lost in a rage that Remus was terrified he would do something stupid when he left school. It chilled him to the bones. Guilt, longing, shame and despair drove Remus to grab the other by the arm, making other Slytherins laugh at them which made Snape even angrier. 'Get away from me, beast.' Snape hissed. 'Or I will scream right here and now what you are. It will destroy you...' He stopped and then approached Remus until their noses almost touched. 'You know I can destroy someone until there is nothing left of them.' His smile looked almost demonic and Remus stumbled away, shaken by the look in Snape's eyes.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>0o0</p>
</div><div>
  <p>The war continued and there were rumors that Snape did become one of Voldemort's followers. When Remus was sharing a flat that Sirius rented, he realized finally that his friend was hitting on him. That he may have done it for years but he was too insecure and blind to realize it. He was physically attracted to the animagus. Sirius had been the most gorgeous boy in the entire school and they had shared a bedroom so he had seen a lot of him throughout the years and wasn't immune to it.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>When he finally gave in, however, after they made love, he would stare at the ceiling, thinking about another dark-haired, brave boy he once knew. One that he discovered too late that had stolen his heart.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Sometimes, he closed his eyes and pretended that Sirius was someone else. During the light of day, he felt guilty and would be solicitous, preparing Sirius' favorite foods, give him massages or spoil him.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>He did love Sirius in his own way and only after living together he realized that he saw the animagus more as a brother or a best-friend than a lover. By then it was too late. Remus could repress anything to not make others suffer. Not after what he considered to be his fault how much Snape lost himself to the darkness.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>He would think of Snape often. These silences and his absences during his missions with the werewolves drove Sirius suspect him and in time, trust Peter Pettigrew. Sirius was there everytime he returned home and it was clear that there was a secret between them. Sirius just misunderstood what that secret was.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>0o0</p>
</div><div>
  <p>When the worst happened, Remus had been drinking for two days straight when someone knocked at the door of the flat he shared with Sirius.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>He threw up many times as he had been drinking on an empty stomach.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Remus tried to get up and fell. He tried a second time and on the third, he finally walked to the door.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>When he opened the door, he just stared open-mouthed at the black figure waiting for him.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Snape had black shadows under his eyes which were a little red and puffy.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>The last thing he wanted to see was a suspected Death Eater at his door, no matter that the war was over.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>'What do you want?' He said, or thought he said because he saw Snape frown.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>'May I come in?' Snape asked, looking up and down at him as if he was worried.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>'No... go 'way.' He made a shooing motion and tried to close the door but Snape held it firmly.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>'Are you ok, Lupin?'</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Remus eyes widened as he tried to focus on one of them as he was seeing two Snapes. 'You're kiddin me righ?'</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Snape looked over his shoulder then back at him. 'May I come in? Let me help.'</p>
</div><div>
  <p>'Help?' Remus snorted. 'Tell me something Snap. Are you a Dead Eatin? 'Ve been hearin over the years... Rumors you kno?'</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Snape looked down, took a deep breath and then stared back at him. 'Yes. Yes, I was.'</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Remus stared as that sobering thought started to penetrate his idle brain. He then realized that he had a bottle of firewhiskey in his hand and he broke it against the wall. He brought the shards of glass to Snape's neck and grabbed him by the hair with the other hand.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>'Did you have anythin to do with their death?'</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Snape continued to stare at him showing no sign of fear.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>'I will answer. And I don't care if I die or live. But I don't want you to carry the burden of killing someone with you.'</p>
</div><div>
  <p>'Like you care.' Remus snorted, throwing the broken bottle against the wall of the living room. 'At fifteen, you could commit premeditated murder. You've always been a Dead Eatin.' Remus tried to balance on his feet but fell on his ass on the floor.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Snape moved a few steps as if to help but then stopped himself.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>'I...' Snape stopped to breathe deeply, showing some insecurity for the first time. 'I... Yes, I am responsible for Lilly's death.'</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Remus stared at the love of his life. He thought that Snape couldn't hurt him even more or maybe that the alcohol wouldn't allow him to be torn apart more than he already had been. But he was wrong.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>His eyes welled with tears of hate. He got up through sheer determination and rage. He closed his fist and with all of his werewolf strength behind him, he aimed and threw a punch right at Snape's jaw.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>The Death Eater had raised his wand but had not counted on a muggle-style attack and flew back, hitting his head on the wall.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>They stared at each other, panting, until Remus dried his tears with the back of his hand.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>'I may be a bist...' He was a little surprised when Snape shook his head as if denying it or like he regretted having said that. 'I am a beast. But there is somethin that I am proud not to be and that is a murderin scum like ya.'</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Snape stepped back like he had been hit. Then he slowly turned away and left, slamming the door behind him.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Remus fell on his knees and cried like he never did before.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>His friends, the only people he had in the world were dead. His lover had been a spy and helped kill them all. The love of his life somehow had been responsible for Lilly's death, whatever the hell that meant. Why didn't Snape said he was responsible for James' too?</p>
