  <strong>And a dozen other reasons why Harry shouldn’t sleep with Spike and/or Angelus</strong>
</p><p align="center">
  <strong>A Harry Potter/Buffy the Vampire Slayer Crossover</strong>
</p><p><strong><em>Author’s Note: : </em></strong><em>This is number six of the many crossovers I managed to make happen from the same prologue challenge.  As you can probably guess from the title, there is going to be a lot of dark humor in this one, as well as a plentiful helping of DarkGrey/BorderlineDarkHarry.  I also have taken extreme liberties with the origins of the standard Buffyverse vampires, which should explain both original vampires like the nasty ones that come out of the Hellmouth, as well as vampires that are </em>off<em> like Spike.</em></p><p>Disclaimer: Harry Potter and Buffy the Vampire Slayer are both the properties of their respective owners and no profit was made by the writer of this fanfiction.</p><p align="center">
  <strong>Prologue:</strong>
</p><p align="center">
  <strong>A Very Harry Happening</strong>
</p><p>“Please tell me I’m actually dead this time.”</p><p>Harry’s voice came out in a deadpan as he opened his eyes in an all-too-familiar location.</p><p>He hadn’t been back to Platform 9 ¾ since leaving for his final (eighth) year of Hogwarts.</p><p>There was no need, as he had neither friends at the ancient school nor any children to send off.  Though he supposed Teddy was almost there, but it wasn’t yet September and that nightmare of first-year anxiety was months away.  Andromeda would handle most of it, as she’d done with the rest of the day-to-day of raising his godson/her grandson.  But Harry would still be the one the young Lupin would lean on for those first-day jitters.</p><p>Well.</p><p>He would have been.</p><p>But being a Hit Wizard wasn’t exactly all sunshine and roses, and Harry had already beaten the odds more than once.</p><p>Moreover, he’d recognized that sickly-purple spell the newest wave of wizarding-cult-followers had shot at him.  Hell.  He’d used the <em>Sectumsempra</em> more than once in the line of duty.</p><p>He’d felt it hit across his upper chest and neck.</p><p>He’d felt himself get cold and his vision – finally corrected after reaching his majority and being able to request and pay for the expensive potion – fade out.</p><p>Harry had died.</p><p>Again.</p><p>Though maybe this time it would take, even if it would leave behind a grieving Teddy.</p><p>Harry didn’t try and fool himself.</p><p>After he’d thrown off everyone’s expectations, taking up his seats in the Wizengamot and going after his Inheritance that everyone had somehow neglected to mention *cough, Dumbledore, cough, Weasleys, cough*, not many people would miss him other than his godson.</p><p>He imagined that even Andromeda, stern matriarch that she was, would only miss having his support and more importantly his name to throw around, more than him himself.</p><p>No.</p><p>Going back to Hogwarts, not what the Ministry wanted or the public expected, but still within the “allowable” realm of behavior.</p><p>Accepting all his vaults, his titles, and his responsibilities, well, it wasn’t what anyone wanted for him, per se, but it wasn’t beyond the pale either.</p><p>It was when he entered Hit Wizard training instead of Auror Academy that people started to twitch.</p><p>Harry was already considered volatile, powerful, and somewhat dangerous.</p><p>Joining the ranks of witches and wizards who were the Wizarding World’s version of Special Forces crossed with MI6…that started up a tone of concern, though it was levied in part that as a Hit Wizard he was ostensibly under the aegis of the Ministry and all-was-still-well.</p><p>It was also the first real strike against the tidy “plan” that had been set in motion for his life, ever since he was born and likely before he was even conceived.</p><p>The Wizarding World liked things neat and tidy in their little labeled boxes.</p><p>Potters were Aurors.</p><p>Malfoys were Politicians.</p><p>Blacks were eccentric (or flat-out crazy) Nobles.</p><p>And so on, into infinity.</p><p>But Harry bucked centuries of tradition and went into the more dangerous field of being a Hit Wizard, which carried with it a ten-year expiration date: either you died before then (which was ninety percent of them) or you retired and either taught the oncoming young-bloods or transferred into the DMLE either as an administrator of some kind or as an Auror.</p><p>Harry’s ten-year mark was coming up soon, and he’d made it despite curses, hexes, vampires (and wasn’t that a fun case…) and now this new muggleborn-driven cult that wanted, irony of ironies, to tear down the Statute of Secrecy and usher in a world where wizard kind were benign rulers.</p><p>This shit just never ended.</p><p>It simply changed faces.</p><p>He could almost hear Tom laughing from the gates of Hell where he was no doubt waiting for Harry to show up.</p><p>Harry had no illusions about himself.  Not anymore.  He might’ve made a middling-to-good godfather when he wasn’t dodging curses or blood-sucking-fiends, but he also killed his first man at the age of eleven and thereafter never really…stopped.</p><p>Oh, there were lulls, and sometimes it was creatures that he ended up ending instead of people, but it was as if once his heart got a taste of death it never forgot it – or how easy it was to dole it out.</p><p>He had a survival instinct that was, even he could admit, second to none, surviving things that would have killed anyone else.</p><p>And this time that survival instinct was screaming at him that he’d finally failed to listen to it in time.</p><p>Most of all…Harry was just tired.</p><p>Not so much of his job, he’d been damn good as a Hit Wizard, nor of his role as godfather though he was glad that he’d got to at least spend the last ten years with Teddy.</p><p>But tired, oh yes, he was tired of other things.</p><p>Tired of the expectations of him to finally “settle down” with an appropriate witch and start popping out heirs, especially with his retirement from active duty Hit Wizard coming up.</p><p>Tired of having to explain, again, that no, he wasn’t interested in Ginny for the five-thousandth-time when he went to the Burrow for Sunday dinner.</p><p>Tired of Hermione trying to use him name and influence to direct the Wizarding World.</p><p>Tired of Ron trying to use their shared adventures to advance his Auror career.</p><p>Tired of being seen as everyone’s favorite bankroll, after all, it wasn’t like he had any family to spend his galleons on, Harry.</p><p>Just tired of all the bullshit.</p><p>And now, unless this was a potions-induced psychotropic trip, he could finally rest.</p><p>Sighing, he blinked his eyes in the wake of the glowing-white-haze the Platform was covered in and wearily climbed to his feet, absently noticing that like his previous visit he was wearing the same clothes as he remembered before taking the death-blow but clean, though this time it was his Hit Wizard wear of gunmetal-grey Horntail dragonhide trousers, boots, and gloves matched with a goblin-forged steel-mail undershirt topping a soft cotton undervest and topped in turn by a wool long-sleeved tunic in dove grey, a basilisk-hide sleeveless dueling robe that had a hood and dropped to the top of his knee-high boots thrown over it all.  On the left side of his tunic was his rank as a Hit Wizard, no surprise that after nearly a decade in the field, it was of a Field Commander, the words embroidered in the same venom-green of his basilisk robe, with his call sign: Chaos, under it and the nine gunmetal-grey stars that signified each year of service.</p><p>His wand was missing from Horntail-hide holster on his right arm, having been dropped when he, well, died, but he felt the comforting weight of his favorite knife still tucked inside his left boot.</p><p>“Sorry, son.”  He heard from behind him the voice was soothing and gentle but with an underlying rasp, Harry turning to face the speaker, one he didn’t think he’d ever met before in his life…unlike last time.  “But far be it for Death to forsake His Master in such a way.”</p><p>“Merlin.”  He cursed, rubbing at his tired emerald green eyes.  “For once I wish it wasn’t me.”</p><p>Harry eyed the other man – if a man at all was what the other figure was.  He was…utterly normal in just about every way.  Harry knew operatives on the muggle side of things that would kill to have his seeming blandness, that ability to be everyone and no one all at once.  Grey hair, a sober face that was handsome but not overly or memorably so, soft grey eyes, and dressed in a muggle suit in black with a mandarin collar, there was nothing remarkable about him not his looks, his middling height, nothing.</p><p>Nothing at all, save his voice that had a resonance that struck at the very heart of Harry.</p><p>“But it is you.”  Death said, folding his hands elegantly before him, watching Harry with a sort of paternal pride and care.  “You are the last of the Peverells, the last of my chosen Wizards.  You collected all my Hallows, and yet never sought them.  And you who cast them away, breaking and burning the wand, turning the stone to powder, only keeping the last, the Cloak that was handed down from father-to-son, for your own.”  There was no mistaking it, Death was proud of him.  Proud and entertained, unless Harry’s instincts were off.  “There is no other I would have ever chosen – nor did I, when I gave the Three my Gifts and sent them out into the world.  I always knew it would be you, Harry.  And I’m very glad it was.”</p><p>“Omniscience…great.”  Harry said with a sigh, barely holding in an eye roll.  He was tempted to give into sarcasm but had enough self-preservation, even while mostly-dead, to refrain in the presence of a deity…of some kind.  “To recap: you met my ancestors, gave them the Hallows, all so that I would become your Master, which I never wanted to be in the first place.”  Harry held out his arms in a Here-I-Am gesture.  “Now what?”</p><p>“That is, for the first time,” Death gave him a gentle look of understanding.  “Entirely up to you, son.  Should you wish it you can return to your life, knowing that you are my Master and therefore will have a problem staying dead.  If you wish, you can summon the Hallows to you before you return.  Or you can choose to go on: either to your well-deserved rest having lived a half-life or…”</p><p>Harry knew he was going to regret this but his damned-infernal curiosity would torture him for ages if he didn’t do it.  “Or…?”</p><p>“You will never have the life you want, the life you were meant to have before Fate meddled with you, if you go back.”  Death looked unbearably pissed-off at the mention of Fate meddling.  Something to think on later, as well as what it implied about both entities? Deities?  Whatever.  A problem for another time.  “Nor can you remain in these Crossroads without becoming a wraith yourself, even the Master of Death is still human, and this is not a place for a soul such as yours.”</p><p>“Then I can go on.”  Harry said softly, voice wistful as he stared off at something only he could see.  He could almost hear the voices of his parents, of Sirius and Remus and even Severus, calling out to him.  “To my rest.”  The quirk of his lips was nothing short of bitter.  “I rather think I’ve earned that much.”</p><p>“Yes, I daresay you have.”  Death agreed easily with that much.  “You have single-handedly at times and jointly at others, saved no less than millions of lives, both magical and otherwise by your deeds.  You were a true hero in your life and have earned a hero’s rest.  However, there is another path that you might take.”  Death’s eyes gleamed with unearthly brightness for a moment.  “This is, after all, a Crossroads: there are more choices than merely forwards or back.”</p><p>“Such as?”</p><p>“I can return you to another time in your same world, with all your same knowledge and powers.”  Death waved his arms, and several trains pulled into the station, the first an inky black, the second a blinding white, the third a dove grey, and the last an emerald green.  “I can send you back to your life the very moment you were struck down, merely with a lesser wound, I can send you onwards to your rest, or,” Death’s smile was too toothsome to be comforting.  “I can send you to a place outside of the influences that have thus far guided your life.  The choice, my son, is up to you.”</p><p>“I know I don’t want to go back to the way things were.”  Harry admitted with a sigh, Death nodding and the white train disappearing.  “I’m tired of playing their hero.”  He thought for a moment and gave a sneer.  “And as tempting as it is to go back to another time in my own world, to change things, make them better,” he snorted.  “I’ve already bled enough for them; why should they have any more of me?”</p><p>“Why, indeed?”  Death asked lowly, waving an arm and the black train fading away.</p><p>Honestly, the deity hadn’t been sure if this Harry would choose to go back and “fix-it” as many other Harrys have.  After all, as quantum cosmology put it: everything that can happen will happen in opposite and parallel universes.  This is merely the first time this Harry has stood before him and they’ve had a version of this same conversation.</p><p>Though granted when you thought of it that way, this was the first time this Death has done so as well.</p><p>It was enough to give a deity a headache…if deities got headaches.</p><p>“Which only leaves the question:” Harry said to himself, staring at the two trains.  “Do I rest, or do I bite the apple that’s been offered to tempt me?”</p><p>“It isn’t poisoned; I can reassure you of that much.”  Death smirked.  “But neither is that choice without struggle or conflict.  Choosing to step outside of our influences will lose you your inability to stay dead for one: where you go I would not be able to extend my grasp.  But at the same time, Fate won’t be able to toy with you any longer: you will also be outside of Her reach.”</p><p>“What else can you tell me?”</p><p>“I can give you the information about that world you’ll need to survive the first thirty days.”  Death folded his arms in front of his chest, a knowing arch to his brow.  “Anything outside of that, you’ll have to bargain for: Death may be neutral, and you my Master, but there are rules to such things that even we cannot disobey.”</p><p>“You said I can summon the remains of the Hallows.”  Harry lit on what Death meant almost immediately.  “What can I ask for in exchange for returning them to you, along with my missing wand?”</p><p>“The Elder Wand was a weapon to best all others.”  Death intoned solemnly, a chilling reverb in his voice.  “I can supply you with one that with practice and work will be the same.  The Stone was designed to recall a loved one from Me: together with your phoenix wand I can give you similar power.  And the Cloak when mastered and used wisely could hide anyone from even Me: I can grant you the skill to do the same in your new home.”</p><p>“A weapon, a power, and a skill.”  Harry summed up, turning it over and over in his mind.  “What about my other things?  Can I have any of them in my new life?”</p><p>“I cannot touch that that isn’t yours alone.”  Death said slowly, thinking of how best to word his answer.  “But there will be things I can send along with you as part of your ‘grace period’ as it were.”</p><p>“What isn’t mine alone…hmm…”  Harry pondered that.  “The contents of my trust vault and my personal work vault then.”  He decided fit the bill.  “Only in a bottomless trunk or bag from my vault and made into a form that won’t draw attention.  My clothes, say all my Hit Wizard uniforms save for my dress uniform that I’ll be buried in, and my boots.  My personal potions store.  Everything else I suppose all belongs to Teddy now…or was my own inheritance and not strictly mine.”</p><p>“It shall be as you ask, if a new home is the choice you make.”  Death agreed with a regal incline of his head.  “Save for things that cannot or will not function in your new home, that is.  There may be artefacts and the like that won’t work where you’re going.”</p><p>“I think we both know what I’ve decided.”  Harry drawled with a half-smile.  “I’m tired enough to want to rest, but still curious enough to take your bait.  Send me on: to a place where those that have influenced or would influence my life cannot touch me.”</p><p>“As you wish.”  Death nodded his head and the green train disappeared, leaving only the dove grey in its place to carry Harry onward.  “It shall be done: Master of Death.”  The deity looked far off for a moment and smoke and vapor started to climb from the engine’s smokestack.  “What shall your name be, Master, in your new life?”  He asked several moments later after Harry had carried through with his half of the bargain and summoned the Hallows, setting them down on the bench beside him.</p><p>“I’ve always wanted to be just Harry.”  The green-eyed wizard said with a little laugh.  “But unless I’m going back in time as well as far away, I don’t think that’ll cut it.”</p><p>“No, son.”  Death chuckled a little as he made several things materialize in his lean hands.  “It won’t.”</p><p>He handed the items over to Harry, the wizard arching a brow at the all-too-familiar sword though this time it was housed in a basilisk hide sheath, likely the only thing that could protect the bearer or others from its deadly venomous blade.  Rolling his eyes a bit at the vicious grin on Death’s face, Harry threw the buckled sheath on over his robe, settling it onto his back with the ease of someone who has undergone serious weapons training as a Hit Wizard.  It wouldn’t be the first time he’d used a sword in the last decade, though he – or anyone for that matter – hadn’t seen this one since Neville killed Nagini with it.</p><p>Harry had to admit, as far as trades go, an unbeatable Wand for a poisonous, deadly sword wasn’t a bad deal.</p><p>Even if the rubies made it a bit flashy for his taste.</p><p>Next went on the plain black canvas bag, likely containing the things he’d asked for that “belonged” to him, Death tapping the small pocket on the front of the bag.</p><p>“Inside you’ll find your new identity and information on your…<em>improved</em> powers.”  Death warned.  “Read the information I’ve provided thoroughly before you go wandering around.  There are things that quite <em>literally</em> find you too appetizing for words in your new home.”</p><p>“I understand.”  Harry nodded once, sharply.  “Will I understand the information with my current level of knowledge?”</p><p>“Once I’ve given you the information you’ll need to survive and your new skill-set: yet.”  Death smirked a little.  “Though I would wager that even without it you would’ve figured it out…in time.”</p><p>“Okay then…”  Harry shrugged on the pack over top of the sheath but not so it was blocking the hilt of the sword and preventing a clean draw.  “Anything else?”</p><p>“Just this.”  Quick as a viper, Death reached out and pressed the palm of one hand to Harry’s forehead.</p><p>The smaller figure screamed and writhed in place as information was literally shoved into his mind, tearing through his mental barriers like tinfoil and making his nose drip blood from the strain.</p><p>“Fuck!”  He cried out as Death finally let him loose, hunching over with his hands on his knees.  “What the fuck was that?!”</p><p>“That.”  Death answered dryly as he escorted Harry over to the open door of the waiting train.  “Was what you can call an information download.  Not pleasant in the least, but effective.  You’ll survive what’s coming now.”  He waved one hand to the open doors, beckoning Harry forward.  “Or at least, you should.  Meditate while you travel, where you’re going is no little distance away…and you’ll need to be prepared for anything the moment you arrive.”</p><p>“Okay.”  Harry blew out a breath.  “Be prepared, survive, any other advice before we part ways, hopefully for a long, long time?”</p><p>“Just one:” Death said softly, the paternal mien returning.  “This life has taught you to block yourself off from others, to withhold your trust and guard your heart: and those were and are necessary skills for you to survive.  But.”  He held up a warning hand when Harry went to protest.  “But, there will come a time when you’ll need to trust to survive, and to open your heart if you want to live…and not just exist.”</p><p>Harry nodded, once, shortly, jaw clenched at the implied censure.</p><p>As if he hadn’t heard similar things before, most recently from Andromeda, over his shunning of witches and even wizards, who were brought to him in an attempt to matchmake.</p><p>“Harry Potter Black.”  He decided, ignoring the opportunity to respond to Death’s advice.  “That’ll be my name.  Harry P. Black.”</p><p>“Very well.”  Death nodded, the doors beginning to close.  “Your destination is a strange version of Earth, one that has links to other realms of both great terror and great wonder.  The year there will be 1996…so a bit of a step back for you.”</p><p>“Ok.”  Harry said stepped back before cocking his head and asking one last question: “Any information on where I’ll be…other than Earth?”</p><p>Death grin was borderline malicious as he answered, raising his voice just enough to be heard over the closing doors and the squeal of the train wheels.</p><p>“They call it the Hellmouth.”</p><p>…</p><p>Harry laughed darkly as he settled into a compartment on the moving train.  The irony was, even he had to admit, rather wonderful.  He passed up a chance on his afterlife and gave up his not-dying-thing only to land in a place named for hell itself.</p><p>It had a delicious sense of symmetrical macabre to it that he enjoyed, even as he wondered and worried about some of the things Death implied – or out-right stated about his “new world.”</p><p>No magic for one – or at least – not as he understood it.</p><p>That was worrisome, making him unsure about whether his own magic would work.  Or not.  Or just a little.  Which was all somewhat moot as he didn’t have a wand anyway and he only had a few skills in his wandless repertoire.</p><p>Don’t get him wrong, they were dead useful skills to have, which was why he’d taken the time and massive effort to learn them wandless: <em>Epsikey, Tergeo, Stupefy, Allohomora, Accio</em>, and <em>Wingardium Leviosa</em>, none of which are necessarily high-level spells but could be learned wandless and even wordless, as he’d done.</p><p>The only other magical skills he had that could be done without a wand were a few blood-based rituals he knew of warding that he had to learn to take control of his family properties as well as Grimmauld Place.</p><p>That was if using his magic didn’t fry whatever electronics he was around, as since this wasn’t a magical world he was going to, and the year 1996, electronics were going to be a fact of life as Death confirmed he was staying on Earth.</p><p>Even if he didn’t recall a Hellmouth from his geography lessons in primary school or anything he’s learned of the magical world since.</p><p>So it might be a different Earth, and surely was, but still Earth all the same.</p><p>Sinking into his meditation to process the migraine-inducing information overload he’d gotten, Harry arched a brow at one of the first things he found: his new skill-set.</p><p>Part of being a Hit Wizard was undergoing a course with the muggle military on survivalism, as well as tracking and bringing down targets.  What he’d gotten in exchange for the Cloak was a different set of skills entirely, though not one that was completely alien due to the aforementioned training.  It was what his trainer/mentor for the Hit Wizards called “Ghost Training” and something Harry hadn’t gotten into as he was slotted into the Hit Wizards when they were short “Tanks”, powerhouses that were mostly used to cause shock, awe, and leave a wave of destruction in their wake.  With his magical core, and proven ability to deal damage, making him into a Tank-Class Hit Wizard simply made sense over the other two classes which were Proteus-Class a kind of jack-of-all-trades that filled in the blanks between Tanks and Ghosts, and the Ghost-Class which were the lone-wolves of the Hit Wizards.  Ghosts were able to adapt to any surroundings, survive any terrain or environment, gathering intelligence or taking out threats as needed.</p><p>Needless to say, Tanks and Ghosts rarely worked together, mainly backed up by Proteus who were the bulk and the back-bone of the Hit Wizards.</p><p>Altogether, Harry would wager that there were only ever a handful of fully-trained Tanks or Ghosts in the ranks at any given time, whereas all the rest were Proteus.</p><p>Wave after wave of instinct, skills, and habits flooded his mind as the information Death gave him to ensure he’d survive the first month met and married up with the skill-set he’d bargained for, Harry suddenly just knowing what the <em>power</em> he’d been <em>blessed </em>with was.</p><p>Harry was a fucking <em>dhampir</em>, and a powerful one, the daywalking product of a male vampire impregnating a female of another species…including a witch or mortal female.</p><p>All those times avoiding being turned by Dark Creatures, and his patron turns him into one <em>regardless.</em></p><p> “Well.”  He murmured as piece by piece his new skills and information settled into place.  “At least now I know why Death gave me a damn sword.  I might very well have to use it if there’s hostile vampires in the area...not to mention this creature called a <em>Slayer</em>.”</p><p>That fucking asshole had gone and made him immortal with all of the strengths and none of the weaknesses of a vampire…no matter which kind you were talking about.  Harry had bartered away his undying lineage, utterly uninterested in eternity…only to end up an immortal <em>anyway.</em>  Sometimes, Death really could be a bastard.</p><p>…</p><p>Feeling muzzy-headed and still fighting off a migraine, Harry knew when he was close to his destination, sensing the motion of the train slowing down.</p><p>Standing and shaking his head, he took a deep breath, steeling himself to step out and into a life filled with unknown challenges – save that it was going to be a challenge, Death wouldn't have given him the information, the tools, skills, and power he had, if it was going to be an easy coast to easy street.</p><p>No, Harry chuckled, somehow a soft, easy life wasn’t ever in the cards for him.</p><p>But if he was honest with himself, that sounded boring as shit anyway.</p><p>Stretching up onto his toes, he mentally thanked restoration/nutrition potions as well as a late-teens growth spurt that he wasn’t a damn shrimp anymore.  Being stuck at well-below average height and weight for a male of European extraction would’ve sucked, especially undergoing his weapons training and physical combat training to be a Tank.  Granted, even with magical help he didn’t hit the 6’ 3” of his father or even the 6’ 1” of his godfather, but a nice 5’ 10” was a lot better than the 5’ 4” he was when he faced off against Voldemort.</p><p>Magic had also helped his eating issue – or rather the involuntary eating disorder he’d gotten from years of sustained and systematic neglect and abuse – which in turn helped him pack on pounds in the form of muscle, even if he’d never be as built as a Hit Wizard was supposed to be.</p><p>Harry was chiseled and cut…but built or stacked with muscle was beyond his grasp.</p><p>It started as being nothing but muscle, skin, and bone from his childhood, but even with a specialized diet, exercise, and potions regimen, Harry would still never be the “ideal” Hit Wizard physically.</p><p>And he was fine with that, since as far as he could tell, he wasn’t an ideal anything in any other way either.</p><p>Nope.</p><p>Snow-cones-in-hell would happen first, before he became the ideal hero or Hit Wizard or even boyfriend, much to Ginny’s fury.</p><p>Steadying himself as the train slowed to a stop, the doors cracking open and showing a dense forest to his right with a beach and ocean to his left, Harry took one last look around the train and closed his eyes, using his instincts from his new <em>heritage</em> to easily leap from the train and land in a crouch on the empty beach.</p><p>His <em>dhampir</em> abilities were so far working in a near-seamless, instinctive fashion.</p><p>Good to know.</p><p>With a slow look around, Harry rose to his feet and set off at an easy lope towards some caves he saw in the cliff face with his heightened sight, searching for a place to process and practice the information Death had given him.  And, oh yeah, heal from the damned <em>Sectumsempra</em> that killed him.</p><p>It was only a deep slice or two across his upper chest now, but it could seriously slow him down even as a <em>dhampir</em> if he didn’t take care of it.  Perhaps especially as a <em>dhampir</em> since their healing abilites were based on blood-magic, specifically by absorbing the magic/life gained from drinking blood from a living creature, much like the way full-vampires stayed alive.  Whether demonic, cursed, created through blood-magic, or like the ones in his new world a strange and twisted amalgamation of all three, it was the magic in living blood that kept them up and moving and existing instead of withering away to skin and bone or petrifying from lack of sustenance.</p><p>Thankfully, Harry’s wounds had scabbed over enough that he wasn’t leaving a massive blood trail as he made his way into the cave complex, not wanting to tempt one of the locals into trying to track down what they might think an “easy” meal only to get in <em>way</em> over their heads.  Following a narrow trail that he managed to slip through with some creative usage of his new abilities and limited wandless repertoire, he eventually came out into a wide chamber that was completely dry save for the pool at one end that was fed by an underground source.  Still in awe of his new night-vision and the utter lack of needing a <em>Lumos</em> to see, he followed his newfound skills and instincts, searching for any sign of water marks or the growth of mold, fungi, or rot that would suggest that the cavern flooded during possible rain storms.  Not discovering any, he gave a relieved sigh, knowing that at least he would be safe from human dangers in his hideaway, or other near-human dangers of similar size, and rolling his head on his shoulders shrugged out of the pack and sword, setting them down on a cluster of raised rock formations near the wall opposite the pool.</p><p>It wasn’t a large enough water source to bathe in, not that he would want to foul his drinking water anyway, and he’d need to test it for safety, but if it was safe or at least treatable, Harry thought he’d found a base to call home while he honed his new skills and adapted to a life lived mostly without magic and as a <em>dhampir</em>, depending on how thorough Death had been in setting up his new identity.</p><p>“Maybe now’s the time to try and train up some other wandless spells.”  He told himself as he dug out his potions supply and started sorting his other supplies.  “Or brush up on my blood-magic since I’m a blood-magic-based semi-creature…thing, now.”</p><p>He knew there wouldn’t be food – and Merlin, but he was hungry both for food <em>and</em> blood if he was reading himself right – but there might be a med kit or other things that he didn’t realize were covered under the “his personal property” clause of his deal.</p><p>A nutrition potion – thanks to his paranoia over keeping a full potions stock for emergencies after living on the run for a year – took the edge off his hunger even if it didn’t sate it, allowing him to focus on his job of sorting his stuff out – and then repacking it all over again.</p><p>If it wasn’t something useful within the next forty-eight hours – like the gold, silver, and bronze from his vaults – he stuffed it away in several of the bottomless pouches he’d had in his vaults and put them in the very bottom of his pack.</p><p>Semi-useful things – books, excess clothing, etc. – went into another bag on top of the useless items, while the actually of-use supplies went into a variety of the outer pockets of the pack, Harry taking the time to remove the packet with his new identity and the “information” on his new abilities – a  leather-bound black book he recognized from Grimmauld Place, while he was at it and repurpose that pocket.</p><p>One med kit found, potions taken, and bandages applied, Harry spread out his Hit-Wizard issued all-weather all-terrain sleeping bag, already knowing that he’d need to get used to always sleeping clothed and armed again depending on how long it took him to find a secure base, something he hadn’t done since survival training and then the Horcrux hunt before that.</p><p>On top of his potions supply, and the med kit that he thought came from under his bathroom sink, Harry had found several more knives, most of which went into various places on him before the overflow went into his pack, matches, that day’s Daily Prophet (at least it would make starting a fire easier), and other small personal items like his hygiene products, Hit Wizard gear, and other odds and ends.</p><p>It wasn’t a supply meant to sustain him forever, that was for sure, and he’d have to hunt first thing in the morning for either a butcher or a willing donor and gather some of the herbs and plants from the forest if he can’t find an apothecary, for eating or other things, but all in all…could be worse.</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>Definitely could be worse.</p><p>Harry arched a brow as he flipped rapidly through the papers that made up his new life: ID’s, background, even a bank account – the balance of which explained why his supply of bronze and silver had been lower than he’d expected; and assimilated it much faster than a human eye would have been able to follow.  If he was understanding what had been done to him right from the ancient tome that had been under glass as long as he – or Siri, or the Black Portraits – could remember, Death had made him more in line with a <em>dhampir</em> from a blood-magic-vampire/witch pairing than from the strange-hybrid-vampire/human pairing that would be more likely found in his new home…though would still be extremely rare.  Harry’s genes were still his genes…just <em>altered</em> a bit.  Really, it was no wonder the Blacks had put so many protections on the text since the damn thing detailed the various ways to make multiple versions of a vampire step by step, ways to kill them, ways to help them, ways to strengthen them.</p><p>He snorted, turning back to the title page of the text and spent a moment translating the archaic Latin.</p><p><em>Compendium of Vampiric Kind,</em> indeed.</p>
