    <p>This isn’t his room! How? How could he have ended up like this? Was his world- previous world… Was it ever real? Hello, this is Draco Malfoy, a snobby Slytherin boy from Hogwarts. What’s that? Oh, just a little place. The most famous wizarding school in the world and it’s placed in England.</p><p> </p><p>Wizards? Now that just makes you sound crazy! Bloody mad, in fact! But it was true. Draco remembers every detail of it so clearly. His mom, his father, school, and even Potter. Stupid Potter… Maybe he has something to do with this? Oh, what’s going on?</p><p> </p><p>Draco doesn’t really know either. He just woke up in this bed, in a room that struck him as unfamiliar. He sat up, his hair disheveled like he had just been through a tornado and his body stung. Eyes, a darkened grey, glanced over to the window to see more strange images. A backyard? Rather wooded, but he could see he was up higher, second floor possibly. His eyes spotted the fences that divided the yards and blocked the neighbors out.</p><p> </p><p>“What the hell? Have I been kidnapped?” He muttered, his mind going to the extreme and anxiety fluttered away in his chest. Draco swung his legs over the edge of the bed, pushing himself up before feeling for him wand. Nothing. He searched through his deep pockets, but to no avail. Wait, what in God’s name is he wearing? Sweatpants and a baggy t-shirt. He would never wear such attire to bed. “Damn… This is weird,” He mumbled, his mind unable to comprehend the situation.</p><p> </p><p>Out of some sudden impulse, he lifted up the shirt and pressed it to his nose. No distinct smells besides honey. Odd. Just like Potter. Woah! Wait. Potter? Again? Get him out of your head Malfoy, focus! You have to find out where you are and find your things. Draco let the shirt slip from his loose grip and exited what he felt like was the master bedroom.</p><p> </p><p>Rushing water was the first sound to hit him, a light from a door down the hallway. He held up his guard, feeling quite naked and vulnerable without his wand. Draco stepped carefully through the hallway. The floors were wooden, cold and shiny, but could give out a creak at any moment. Draco didn’t know this place like his own home where he knew every nook and cranny. He managed to make it all the way to the door, standing before it. Maybe he should hurry downstairs, in case this was some muggle house that he had no recollection of entering.</p><p> </p><p>Just as he made up his mind to go downstairs, the water shut off. Draco froze out of instinct. That was the worst thing to do in this moment as his eyes were glued to the door. A moment later, the door opened, a shorter man exiting the presumed bathroom. Both yelped at each other’s presence, but the other sighed as Draco stood tense and worried. “Dammit, Draco. Do you always have to scare me? Speak up, would you?” Words, from the voice Draco recognized, which belonged to the male before him. “Potter?”</p><p> </p><p>“Well, duh. Who else would it be? I’m the only one who can stand living with you,” The male, Harry Potter, said in turn. Draco went pale, paler than usual. This was something that stuck out to Harry. “Draco? Are you alright? Did you take your medication yet?” He asked in a worried tone, reaching up to cup the other male’s face in his hands. The Slytherin’s body seemed to naturally react and lean down into his hands, but his expression of shock and confusion stayed. He was so shaken. Harry… What is he doing? He wouldn’t even get close to him, much less worry over him!</p><p> </p><p>Draco couldn’t help but let his eyes wander over Harry. He looked the same, yet… different. He still had those tremendous green eyes that were hidden behind his thin lenses. His skin was still tan, his hair full of dark brown wavy and gentle curls. But the scar that was adorn on his forehead was no longer the famous, lightning shaped scar. Just a straight, normal scar. He also had more freckles than usual.</p><p> </p><p>“Look at you. You’re all sweaty too. A bad dream as well? You’re a mess, babe,” Harry complained with a soft sigh. With a gentle kiss to Draco’s nose, he turned away and set off down the hall and down the stairs. Draco was frozen before he leaned against the nearest wall, sliding down til his rear reached the ground. “No… This can’t be happening. This must be dream…” He said. He was desperate to have this all be a big lie, a prank, a dream!</p><p>This is all too good to be true.</p>
