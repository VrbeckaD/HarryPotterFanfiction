          <div class="userstuff"><p>Harry and Draco had met- reluctantly- with a ghostwriter.  </p><p>“The wizarding world must hear your incredible story, Mr. Potter,” the writer enthused, his quill quivering in anticipation. “Of course, the <em>Daily Prophet</em> will pay and serialise the breathtaking details. How you annihilated the Basilisk. Triumphed in the Triwizard Tournament. How you defeated Voldemort-”</p><p>Harry knew immediatly that this biography wouldn’t ever happen. </p><p>“But those weren't the defining moments of my life,” Harry replied, holding Draco’s hand tightly. “Asking my husband to marry me. Our wedding. Scorpius and Lily. Those are the memories that I truly hold close to my heart.”</p></div>
