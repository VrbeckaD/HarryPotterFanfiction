    <p>The thing he could learn to hate about Doms, Harry thought, was how good they were at bondage. Sure, it was nice when Harry wanted to feel secure and controlled, but times like this just proved how much of a pain in the arse someone with an exceptional knowledge of ropes and knots could be.</p><p>With the blindfold over his eyes, Harry couldn’t get a good sense of the knots holding his arms at his side, secure to the chair. The soft earplugs blocking out all sounds didn’t help with the disorientation either. </p><p>He wiggled his fingers a little, trying to see if he could get the knots to loosen up. No luck. They held firm, but at least they didn’t cut off his circulation. Harry groaned and tilted his head back. The chair wasn’t large enough for him to rest his head against the back, and his neck muscles ached from the effort of holding his head straight. </p><p>They didn’t even have the decency to take off the more irritating parts of the server uniform. His mouth was painfully dry from the gag sucking up his saliva, his arse felt uncomfortably full from the large plug inserted inside, and his cock was half-hard from both the cock ring holding him captive and the stimulation every time he clenched down reflexively.</p><p>Years of training and a natural sense of a Dom’s presence told Harry he was no longer alone in this room though he heard no scratch of a door opening nor the crack of Apparation. Cool hands ran along his body, sliding past the rope. The Dom was checking his circulation to make sure the rope wasn’t going to do permanent damage. The action was slightly relieving; they wouldn’t check if they were going to kill him, right? </p><p>A small part of Harry hoped this was a really intense roleplay, but he knew better. Exhibitory wasn’t a club where they would jump straight into a scene without prior discussion with the sub over limits. This was the type of club that made Harry roll his eyes from the constant need to check whether he needed to use his safe word, not one of those underground clubs he had sought out in his wild days when he had been chasing for something he couldn’t name.</p><p>Perhaps if he got out of this alive, he would stop cursing his younger self’s stupidity. </p><p>“Hello?” Harry tried. The gag was a strip of cloth in his mouth and wound around his head. It didn’t trap his words, and he could speak even though his words would come out a bit mangled. It was weird to speak without being able to hear his own voice, and he couldn’t tell if he had only mouthed the word or spoken aloud. “Please, whoever you are, please let me go. I swear I won’t tell anyone what happened here. I didn’t see anything. Please.” He summoned tears but the blindfold soaked them up before they could roll down his face pitifully. </p><p>If there was a response, he couldn’t hear it.</p><p>Two strong pairs of arms lifted him up, and Harry started at the knowledge that another person was in the room, one he hadn’t sensed. They manoeuvred him to the floor on his front. A set of hands undid the chastity bondage, and Harry relaxed at the sudden freedom. The plug was removed from his arse. The lube used to insert it had long since dried, and the drag against his walls was an unwelcome pleasure that went straight to his cock, which apparently hadn’t gotten the message that this was a bad situation.</p><p>Just as he thought he would be freed, two fingers slick with fresh lube slid into his loose hole. They worked him open clinically, and the plug was inserted back in. They flipped him to his front and checked the fit of the cock ring around his cock for chafing.</p><p>Once they were sure everything was fine—or as fine as things could be in this situation—they sat him back on the chair again. A set of hands worked the gag free, and Harry sighed in relief as his jaw finally relaxed. </p><p>Something pressed against his lips. A straw, he realised. He wrapped his lips around the plastic and sucked. The water soothed his parched throat, and he drank as fast as he could in fear that they would take it away. A hand carded through his hair, and Harry instinctively leaned into it. The slight comfort after Merlin knew how long he had been here was intoxicating, and he wanted more.</p><p>After too short a time, the hand left him. Hands worked the gag into his mouth again before Harry could protest, and the door shut once more. </p><p>This time, he was sure someone remained. Perhaps they had been here even before, only he hadn’t sensed them. It was protocol to never leave a sub tied up and alone. </p><p>Then again, it was also protocol to never use a sub against his will, and Harry was pretty unwilling here. </p><p>The earplugs were removed. Faint sounds felt sharper, and his head hurt as he struggled to reorient himself. </p><p>“Harry Potter, son of James and Lily Potter. After you graduated from Hogwarts, you pursued a mastery in spell crafting. Or so your official file says. But we both know that’s not true,” a masculine voice said. </p><p>A sudden chill made him shiver uncontrollably. Harry whimpered as loud as he could with the gag. “It is!” he protested, his voice muffled and words distorted but understandable. “I swear.” </p><p>A sudden pain through his cock made Harry jerk and he dropped his head back as he tried to arch his back and ride the wave of pain. The arsehole had slapped his cock, and Merlin help him, a part of him <i>liked it.</i> Damn the masochist in him.</p><p>“Don’t lie to me, darling,” the man said. “The Department of Mysteries recruited you straight out of Hogwarts. They probably celebrated when you said yes. Getting such a high-profile wizard, someone from a family in the Book of Gold, would have boosted their funding for years.” </p><p>“You’re confused. I work for a private spell crafting company. Please, you’re thinking of someone else,” Harry begged as his mind rifled through his list of co-workers. One of them must have given him up. There was no way an outsider could know who his employers were. </p><p>The plug in his arse came to life, vibrating right against his prostate. Harry sank his teeth into the gag, trying to suppress a moan as his cock tried to harden in the cock ring. Another slap of his cock sent his nerves alight, the pain mixing with the pleasure to send him flying even higher. </p><p>The ropes held firm as Harry tried to squirm and flee. Whoever had tied him had done it so well that even twisting and struggling didn’t help, nor did the ropes bite into his skin and create burns. An idiotic part of his brain wanted to spend some quality time with the rigger and see what else they could do. If asked, Harry would blame the years of quidditch from Hogwarts as the cause of his lack of self-preservation. </p><p>The vibrator came to a stop, and Harry slumped down, gasping for air. His cock pressed uncomfortably against the cock ring, and Merlin, he wanted to come. </p><p>“Lie to me again, and I’ll turn on the vibrator for an hour. We’ll see if you’re ready to talk then,” the man said calmly. “Your history is of no concern to me.” </p><p>“Then why are you asking?” Harry snarked and instantly regretted it when the palm slapped his cock again.</p><p>“Why did the Department of Mysteries send an agent undercover at Exhibitory?” </p><p>“I’m not here undercover.” Harry shouted as the vibrator came to life in his arse once more, even stronger than before. The leather ring bit into his straining cock, preventing him from fully hardening. Once in a while, the arsehole would switch up the dial. At times, Harry thought he could breathe and think through the pleasure, but then, the man would suddenly up the setting, and Harry would scream through the gag, sobbing as his orgasm remained out of reach. He tried to beg through the gag for relief or mercy, but whatever could be said about the bastard holding him prisoner, he wasn’t a liar. </p><p>The hour stretched into eternity, and he thought he would go mad from pain and pleasure before it was over. Beads of sweat rolled down his body, and the blindfold became soaked with tears. The increased weight pulled the fabric slightly down his face, and he could see slivers of light if he rolled his eyes up. </p><p>Finally, the vibrations ceased. A hand stroked his hair and he cried from relief. </p><p>“Why did the Department of Mysteries send an agent undercover at Exhibitory?” the man repeated, his lips brushing against Harry’s ears as he spoke. </p><p>A part of him screamed at him to tell the truth, but Harry couldn’t. His life was not worth those who would die because he couldn’t keep his mouth shut. </p><p>“I’m not undercover,” he whispered and braced himself for another hour of agony and denied pleasure. </p><p>But the vibrator stayed still in him. The man ran a cool hand down his side, a soothing motion that Harry couldn’t help but lean into. </p><p>“I do love it when they put you through anti-interrogation training,” the man said.</p><p>Harry choked back a hysterical laugh. Anti-interrogation training? More like years of exploring the world of kink and searching for clubs that matched his preferences. The experience that had fuelled his courage to come here undercover would be the same one to kill him. </p><p>A sudden press of metal against skin made Harry flinch, but the man didn’t threaten him with a blade. Instead, he worked it through the ropes, slicing through the hemp easily. The moment Harry’s hands were free, the man secured them with leather cuffs closely chained to each other. He removed the blindfold and tossed it off to the side.</p><p>His captor lifted Harry with ease and carried him across the room, setting him down on a small bed in the corner. Harry relaxed into the cool sheets and sighed as the man worked a warm washcloth over his bare skin, cleaning him of sweat, lube, and dried pre-come.</p><p>“This is going to be uncomfortable,” the man warned. Before Harry could ask, he felt the press of a wand against his cock. A sudden sharp coldness made him flinch, and he tried to squirm away, but the man’s free arm held him in place.</p><p>His cock softened, and when he finally no longer wanted to come, the man worked the cock ring free. He removed the vibrator and undid the gag, leaving Harry only in the cuffs. </p><p>This would be the best time to try to run. </p><p>But Harry didn’t know where he was or how many people stood between him and freedom. Even worse, he had no wand, and his captor could stun him before he even got to the door. No, he needed to play this wisely and bide his time. </p><p>He stayed in place, and the man stroked Harry’s nude body with his hands. It wasn’t sexual, but it was intimate, and Harry nearly cried when he realised what was happening. Aftercare. His captor was a Dom performing aftercare as though this were a really intense scene and Harry was his sub. </p><p>Why was it everything Harry had ever wanted and never thought he would have here in the worst situation possible? </p><p>“Shh,” the man murmured. “Drink.” He sat Harry up and held a glass of water with a straw to Harry’s mouth. </p><p>Harry sucked vigorously. The man set aside the glass when Harry finished it and continued petting Harry. Slowly, his limbs began to feel like lead, and against his will, Harry’s eyes shut. </p><p>“You drugged me,” he accused, and then, he remembered nothing else.</p><hr/><p>When Harry woke up, he was unbound in a cell. It appeared to be a simple grey room with two brown doors at first. Someone had placed him on a small bed in the corner of the small room. It had impersonal white sheets and a white duvet that he had kicked to the ground in his drugged sleep. A dark brown dresser was pushed up against the wall facing him. Dove grey curtains covering a window brushed the top of the dresser. Harry swung his legs off the bed and saw that someone had dressed him in white shirt and trousers. He set the violation aside and immediately pulled the curtains open, intending to get out of here once and for all.</p><p>There were bars on the window. They hadn’t bothered to set wards against him to imprison him. No, they had actually placed fucking bars on the window. He touched it in shock to make sure it wasn’t a glamour. Nope. Actual metal bars. </p><p>Harry wasn’t the sharpest knife in the drawer, but it didn’t take a genius to understand what they were doing. The painted grey walls, hospital white sheets, and bars all served to tell a story. He was their prisoner, at the mercy of whatever they wanted to do.</p><p>He tried both doors even though he expected them to be locked, but to his surprise, only one was. The other opened up to a loo and small shower. The sudden relief of knowing they weren’t going to strip away his privacy and cleanliness made him slump in relief, and he quickly turned on the shower and stripped, making sure to hang the shirt and trousers up in case there weren’t other sets.</p><p>The man had cleaned him last night, but that didn’t erase the need for a hot shower and soap. Harry sighed in bliss as warm water rained down on him, and he gave himself a moment to relax. As the water trickled down his arse, the discomfort of his hole reminded him of what happened yesterday, and he inserted a finger as he tried to check for tearing. </p><p>Nothing but a slight soreness.</p><p>Harry cleaned his hands with soap before scrubbing his hair furiously with the available shampoo and soaping his body. Working for the DOM had trained him to be fast, and Harry was done in two minutes. He towelled off his body and dressed in the same clothes, before stepping into the room. </p><p>The man from yesterday laid on his bed, reading a book. He looked up at Harry’s arrival and ran his eyes down Harry’s body. Harry crossed his arms over his chest and waited.</p><p>“I see you’re settling in well,” the man said.</p><p>Harry flinched, taking a step back before he could control himself. His cock throbbed at the memory of the orgasm this man denied him, and he was tempted to flee back into the bathroom. </p><p>Unreasonable. He was being unreasonable. That was the panic talking, and if he let panic rule him, he would never be able to escape. “Where am I? Why did you bring me here? Please, if you let me go, I won’t say anything, I swear. Or if you want a ransom, my parents will pay.” Harry didn’t look forward to telling his parents what he had actually been doing with his life, but he would prefer that to the torment this man could deliver. </p><p>“There are some rules you will obey while you are here,” the man continued as though Harry hadn’t spoken. “One, you will only speak when a question is directed at you, when you are requesting permission, or when you need to clarify an order. Two, you will not lie. Three, privileges will be granted upon good behaviour and taken away upon bad behaviour. Right now, this room is your privilege. In here, you may act as you wish as long as it does not violate a rule. If you misbehave, I have no problem placing you in a cage on my floor. Four, you will address me as ‘trainer’ or ‘Tom.’ Do you understand these rules.” The tone made it clear this was not a question despite the phrasing.</p><p>“Yes, trainer,” Harry murmured. He would play nice until he knew more, and then he would escape, find the DOM, and get this bastard arrested. </p><p>“Interesting that you would make that choice.” Tom’s lips curved into a smile. “Welcome to your new home. Come.” Tom stood up from the bed and stalked towards the other door. He opened it, and Harry hurried after him quickly.</p><p>Adrenaline coursed through him, and he couldn’t help but flinch at shadows despite how nice the mansion looked at first with its ornate chandeliers and fine carpets. There had been reports that illegal activities were happening in the back rooms of Exhibitory, shielded by the privacy the first wizarding kink club demanded from its patrons. Anyone who tried to investigate disappeared, never to be seen again. Magic offered too many ways to dispose of bodies easily, and the DOM couldn’t even begin to guess what had happened to their agents.</p><p>His backup hadn’t come to his aid, so Tom must have evaded the team somehow. He had no panic ward tattooed into his skin—too easily spotted when nude. That meant no exit plan, no exfil team on standby, nothing but his wits. </p><p>This was, Harry thought, seriously going to suck.</p><p>Harry mentally noted his surroundings as they passed through the compound. Hallway, left turn, another hallway. Several doors, but all closed. Staircase. They went down a storey, and Tom turned down another hall. At the end of the hall, they entered a dining hall. Someone sat at the head of the table, eating breakfast. </p><p>“Ah, Tom,” the man said, his voice high-pitched and cold, grating Harry’s nerves. </p><p>“Voldemort,” Tom greeted. </p><p>Harry nearly stumbled and careened into Tom. Voldemort. The elusive leader they had failed to gain intel on for years. This was the closest any agent had ever gotten to the monster, and if Harry got out of here, he could bring a case against Voldemort with the confirmation that he was associated with the Exhibitory illegal deals. More than ever, he needed to live and escape.</p><p>“I see you have our little spy with you.”</p><p>“I have decided to supervise his training,” Tom said. He pressed a hand on the back of Harry’s neck possessively and pushed downwards. </p><p>Taking the hint, Harry knelt at Tom’s feet. He kept his head bowed and his hands flat on his thighs. His body was tense, and his heart threatened to jump out of his throat. He didn’t know Tom, but he knew Voldemort, and right now, Tom was the lesser evil.</p><p>“Will you,” Voldemort said. It sounded like a threat, and Harry pressed closer to Tom. </p><p>Tom stroked Harry’s hair soothingly. “Do you not trust me to break him?” How highly did Tom rank to speak to Voldemort like that?</p><p>“Break him, yes. But who will he be loyal to when you’re done?” </p><p>“Any pet loyal to me is loyal to you. Who would you rather have then? Bellatrix will kill him before he breaks. Lucius couldn’t tame a dog, much less a DOM agent. Severus? Don’t be ridiculous.”</p><p>“Bella deserves a reward for her loyalty, and the Potter heir will delight her.” </p><p>“Is her delight worth more than obtaining a spy within the DOM? They’re closing in on us, and Severus is no longer providing reliable intel.”</p><p>“You make a good argument. One month, Tom. Disappoint me and I’ll put you back where I found you.” </p><p>“I’ll get it done faster than that. Up.” </p><p>The last word was directed at Harry, and Harry scrambled to his feet, ignoring the pins and needles as feeling returned to his numb legs. He hurried after Tom before Voldemort could reconsider. Harry had recognised all three of the names, and he had no interest in spending time with any of the psychopaths masquerading as sadists. </p><p>Not that Tom was better, but as long as he didn’t brutalise Harry, Harry could live. He was flexible. He would bend to Tom’s will, maybe even break, but as long as he hid a part of himself, he could find his mind once more. </p><p>Harry would live, he would return to the DOM, and he would finally bring Voldemort to justice. </p><hr/><p>When Tom spoke about breaking him, Harry had envisioned a whipping post or a pillory and being bound and lashed until all the skin was gone from his back and blood soaked his trousers, puddling at his feet. He thought he would have limbs broken and teeth pulled out until he turned into a mindless animal from pain, desperate for any relief.</p><p>However, instead, Tom led him to a room covered in mats. “What kind of training does the DOM put agents through?” he asked. </p><p>“I don’t work for the DOM, trainer,” Harry said.</p><p>“I imagine maybe cardio training,” Tom mused. “The DOM is one of the few who have chosen to learn more about muggles rather than eschew all things muggle. Perhaps we’ll start off with some push-ups.” </p><p>Push-ups? Harry stared at Tom blankly, not because he was pretending to not know what those were but because he couldn’t understand <i>what was happening.</i> This had been part of his training, cardio as Tom guessed, but not part of his anti-interrogation training. </p><p>“Down you go,” Tom said. </p><p>Harry dropped to the floor and waited. </p><p>“We’ll start with thirty. For each question you get wrong or refuse to answer, we’ll add another one. If you tell me you don’t know what push-ups are, I’ll place weights on your shoulders, and we’ll try this again. Start and count as you go.” </p><p>Harry grimaced at the thought of doing push-ups with weights, and reluctantly stretched his body into position. He did the exercises slowly, trying to preserve his energy.</p><p>At five, Tom interrupted. “What year did the gargoyle strike occur?” </p><p>“The what?” A boot on his arse pressed down, and Harry winced, hurriedly adding, “trainer.” </p><p>“The gargoyle strike. What year.” </p><p>Harry had no idea. “1970?”</p><p>“We’re at thirty-one now. Keep going.” </p><p>After another five, Tom asked, “What year was the Werewolf Code of Conduct developed?” </p><p>“1637.” Harry had only remembered that from History of Magic because one of his uncles was a werewolf, and the idea that at one point, wizards had wanted werewolves to regulate themselves had stayed with him. </p><p>No response, so Harry assumed he was right. </p><p>It went like that until Harry finally finished at thirty-six after getting all other questions wrong. His arms felt sore and distant, and his shoulders would ache tomorrow, but this was so, so, <i>so</i> much better than being whipped bloody, and Harry couldn’t complain. </p><p>Maybe this was Tom’s plan. Make him grateful for good treatment until he became loyal.</p><p>Even worse, Harry couldn’t stop himself from feeling gratitude towards Tom.</p><p>“Up,” Tom ordered. He led Harry through the compound once more until they entered another room full of bookshelves that reached the ceiling. Hermione would have loved this place. </p><p>The thought of one of his former best friends made Harry’s chest hurt, and he shook away the thought. </p><p>“The answer to every question is in here. Find them. You have two hours.” </p><p>Harry waited a beat to make sure Tom was serious, and he hurried off into the stacks, wishing he had not slept through History of Magic. He flipped through thick books and searched indexes desperately, and at one hour and fifty minutes, Harry returned to Tom, who had made himself comfortable in a chair by the fire.</p><p>Tom looked up from his papers. “Your findings?”</p><p>He recited off the random list of facts Tom demanded, and Tom smiled. “Good,” he praised. “Return to your room.” </p><p>Tom made no move to get up, but Harry had clearly been dismissed. He left the library and retraced his steps. Just as he was about to reach his room, a hand grabbed his wrist. Sharp nails dug into his skin, and Harry froze. </p><p>A woman with long black curls and deathly pale skin held him in place. Her blood-red lips twisted into a horrifying smile. “What do we have here? A spy?” Bellatrix Lestrange drew her wand with her other hand, and Harry flinched. </p><p>“My master ordered me to go to my room, ma’am,” Harry choked out. “Please, don’t make me disobey.” He felt no qualms about calling Tom master, even when it wasn’t one of his accepted forms of address, not when he was facing a woman known for her brutal use of the <i>Cruciatus</i> to torture her victims. </p><p>“Tom wouldn’t mind if I played with you,” she said. </p><p>“Actually, he would. Do try to avoid undoing my work,” Tom interrupted, coming up from behind her. He ignored Lestrange after that and pulled Harry forcefully away. Lestrange released his wrist reluctantly, her nails scraping down his arm. Tom shifted to block Harry from Lestrange, but Harry still felt her eyes burning holes in his head as he walked towards his cell. </p><p>Tom opened the door and pushed him in. “Eat. Rest. Stay away from Bella,” he ordered.</p><p>Harry had no problem with that. He waited for Tom to leave before devouring the plate of chicken and broccoli someone had left on the dresser and drinking the large glass of water in gulps. Belatedly, he remembered being drugged the last time he accepted something to drink from the man, but it was too late. Besides, if Tom wanted to poison him, there wasn’t much Harry could do to stop him. </p><p>Once done, he rinsed the dishes in the bathroom sink as much as possible and laid the wet dishes on a towel to dry. Harry moved to the window, fingering the bars. Was there a way to remove them? He checked for rusted metal and improper installation, pulling on each bar until his fingers were red and sore. </p><p>Nothing. He was trapped. </p><hr/><p>There was no clock in his room, and Harry ended up either pacing or lying down. He had searched the dresser for anything he could use, but there were only identical sets of white shirts, pants, and trousers. He tried curling up on the dresser to soak in the sun, but the surface was too small, and the wood creaked under his weight.</p><p>Maybe this was Tom’s plan. Isolate him, make Tom his only source of human contact, and Harry would come to crave his presence if only to reassure himself he hadn’t been abandoned and forgotten. Perhaps the incident with Lestrange had been staged to create the association of Tom as his protector. </p><p>Everyone knew that physical torture was for psychopaths and only good for hurting victims. People who really wanted answers relied on mental battles, and anti-interrogation training involved identifying psychological techniques. No one had told him that the training would make him over-think the situation.</p><p>Countless hours passed. Harry stared up at the ceiling in boredom. He washed his dishes just to do something with his hands. He tried pulling at the bars again, but when he extended his hand as far as possible, his fingers brushed up against an invisible wall. Someone had warded the mansion against him after all.</p><p>The door opened. His source of misery appeared. “Come,” Tom ordered.</p><p>They went off again through the mansion, this time ending up in a bedroom on the third floor. This one was distinctly more personal, with an emerald green duvet on the bed, a headboard with rings and hooks designed for bondage, a stack of books on a dresser, soft carpets beneath Harry’s bare feet, and strings of lights dangling from the ceiling. </p><p>“Strip and get on the bed, face down, spread-eagle,” Tom ordered.</p><p>Harry flinched at the implications, but, with no alternative, he obeyed. He strained his neck to try and see what Tom was doing, but Tom stayed out of his line of sight. </p><p>“On your application for Exhibitory, you listed permanent marks, scat, water sports, blood play, and knives as hard limits. Do you have anything to add to the list?” </p><p>“No, trainer,” Harry said, his heart sinking. That list of hard limits was essentially a list of ways to torture and violate him. </p><p>“Hmm.” The bed dipped as Tom returned. He lifted Harry’s right hand and buckled a leather cuff to his wrist. After repeating that with his other hand and his ankles, Tom looped rope through the rings in the wrist cuffs, binding his hands over his head to the headboard. He strapped Harry’s ankles to a spreader bar, forcing Harry open for anything he could imagine.</p><p>A dollop of oil hit his back, and strong fingers dug into the stiff muscles of his shoulders. The sudden massage was painful and brutal, but Harry could feel his muscles relaxing, his body becoming malleable beneath Tom’s hands. His body sank deeper into the mattress, his mind starting to drift as the knots disappeared and pleasure spread through his body. Tom’s hands were cool and nice, and if Harry tried really hard, he could forget where he was and pretend this was a consensual power exchange. </p><p>The massage stopped as Tom’s hands moved to stroking his back, petting him lightly. His fingers trailed down to Harry’s arse, and Harry stiffened.</p><p>“Shh,” Tom soothed. “I’m checking for severe inflammation or tearing.” </p><p>His touch was clinical, but Harry was sensitive and could feel arousal heating up from the finger running carefully over him. He squirmed, and Tom smacked his arse. The sudden pain made his cock twitch, and Harry hoped that Tom didn’t see. </p><p>Tom finished his check, and Harry held his breath, waiting for Tom’s next step. </p><p>“This isn’t punishment. I’m doing this because I want to,” was all the warning Harry got before the man brought his hand down on Harry’s arse again, too fast for Harry to breathe through the pain. Sometimes, Tom would strike the exact same place twice, magnifying the pain. Other times, he spread out his strikes, alternating cheeks and the top of his thighs. Harry’s arse heated up, the pain morphed to pleasure, and the world fell away as he entered an old, but familiar headspace. </p><p>“How are you doing, darling?” Tom asked. </p><p>Irritation rose at the question. He almost didn’t respond, but his training said that a verbal response was required. It took long seconds to find the words. “I’m green, sir,” Harry slurred, the response instinctive but wrong for some reason Harry couldn’t pinpoint in that moment.</p><p>Tom chuckled, and his hand disappeared. Before Harry could let out a whine in protest, he was back, rubbing a cooling cream. Harry sighed and tried to spread his legs wider to give the man better access, but the spreader bar restrained him. His cock was hard and leaking, and Harry rubbed against the sheets. </p><p>Strong hands gripped his hips, forcing him to still. “None of that now, darling. You know better.” </p><p>“Sorry, sir,” Harry murmured.</p><p>“Shh.” The spreader bar disappeared, freeing his legs. Tom reached over him, his body pressing against Harry’s side for a moment. Suddenly, Harry could move his arms more, though he was still restrained to the bed. He wiggled onto his side, back pressing against Tom’s chest, and his eyes drifted shut. His arse burned beautifully, arms held him in place, and this was everything Harry had been looking for.</p><hr/><p>Harry’s internal clock woke him up. His eyes flew open, and he tried to get out of bed, only held back by the rope and the restraints. Had he really fallen into subspace yesterday? After only a spanking, and not a particularly harsh one at that? With a man he didn’t trust?</p><p>What was wrong with him?</p><p>He slumped back down, only to realise he wasn’t alone. Tom was sitting on the bed, legs stretched out as he flipped through papers. He glanced at Harry briefly before going back to his work. It was strangely domestic, and Harry rubbed his eyes, trying to orient himself.</p><p>“I’ve been thinking about how to punish you,” Tom said casually as he turned another page. </p><p>Harry stiffened.</p><p>“Do you think I’m being unfair?” he asked. </p><p>There was only one possible answer even if he disagreed. “No, trainer.” </p><p>“Tell me why you’re being punished.” </p><p>“In the encounter with the woman, I spoke without permission, and I failed to carry out your orders, forcing you to come to my aid, trainer,” Harry said.</p><p>“And you don’t think it’s unfair for me to punish things out of your control?”</p><p>He hesitated, and that was an answer in as of itself. </p><p>“So let’s try this again. Do you think it’s unfair for me to punish you for the transgressions you listed.” </p><p>“Yes, trainer.” </p><p>“What would you do if I wanted to punish you?” </p><p>“Nothing, trainer. I’m yours to punish as you wish.” </p><p>“What if I gave you a way to avoid your punishment?”</p><p>“It depends on the alternative, trainer,” Harry said. </p><p>“Just a simple question. You only need answer truthfully and fully. But if I’m not satisfied, I’ll double your punishment.” </p><p>“I’ll take the punishment, trainer,” Harry said. He was pretty sure he knew what Tom would ask, and he had no interest in failing to answer and earning something worse. </p><p>“Really? Even if I say it’s not going to be about the Department of Mysteries?” </p><p>Harry stared at Tom doubtfully, braiding his fingers to try to calm his nerves. He didn’t want to know how creative Tom could get, and if it wasn’t about his job and his cover, maybe a question was worth it. The ropes bound him to the bed, but Tom’s gaze pinned him in place. He couldn’t move until he responded. “What’s the question, trainer?” </p><p>“You’re a halfblood raised in the wizarding world, where people look down on anything abnormal, muggle, and taboo. The DOM trains good spies, but even the best spy can’t fake the experience you have. How did you get that experience?” </p><p>Harry didn’t know what he had expected Tom to ask, but that definitely wasn’t it. Memories of being seventeen, newly graduated, and trying to find his way in the world came unbidden. He dropped his gaze and stared at his hands. </p><p>“My mum is muggleborn, and she wanted me to know the world she grew up in. It wasn’t hard for me to navigate the muggle world, but it took me some time to figure out what I wanted and find the courage to seek it out,” he began. “I found my first kink club when I was eighteen and legal by their laws. I was young and dumb. I didn’t know what I was doing. All the research I had done was from porn and magazines we passed around in the dorms, and even then, the kinkiest thing they had was some light bondage.” </p><p>“It didn’t go well?” Tom guessed. </p><p>“No, it did.” Harry hadn’t realised it at the time, but he had been lucky to go to a club with careful management and screening. There were abusers and psychopaths who frequented kink clubs and masqueraded as Doms and sadists, and had he gone to a club that cared more about money and less about its members, he could have encountered one and gone home with them, becoming a prisoner for them to hurt. “I said I was only going to go once but I went back again the next week.” </p><p>During that time, he had been starting his job at the DOM, training to become an Unspeakable. The stress of it had driven him back to the muggle clubs to be tied up and flogged until the only thing he knew was his Dom’s pleasure. </p><p>Eventually, that wasn’t enough anymore. The worry about whether he needed to use his safeword, the problem of being wary of getting too caught up in the rush of endorphins and becoming too agreeable, and the stress of whether he could truly trust the Dom tying him up had driven Harry to search for some more. </p><p>There were rumours of an underground club where subs gave up their safeword at the door as they signed the consent form, not because they wanted to be in an abusive relationship but because the club trained the Doms to read body language and know every detail of a sub’s reaction. They decided when to stop, not the sub.</p><p>Harry had known how dangerous that could be. No release line on the ropes holding him captive. No escape from a whipping post. If he went there, he would be at the mercy of his Dom, and if his Dom was an abusive arsehole who violated his limits, there was no escape. </p><p>The thought of his parents finding his broken body in an alley somewhere had kept Harry in the safe, regulated clubs for another year until, finally, the overwhelming need for something more drove him to search for the underground clubs. </p><p>It took another three months before he found one at the base of what appeared to be an abandoned car park at first glance. By then, he was an experienced sub, and he was starting to have second thoughts. He hid the address in the bottom of his pants drawer, vowing to never look at it again. </p><p>After the first time he killed someone, Harry dug out the address and went searching for someone to get him out of his mind and make him forget what his job had turned him into. He submitted a list of hard limits, the same list Tom had, and signed a consent form. A Dom bound him to a St. Andrews Cross and spanked, flogged, and whipped him until Harry had been so high on endorphins, he would have agreed to anything the Dom wanted.</p><p>Harry had gone back a total of three times. During the last, he had confessed to his Dom that he was having doubts about working at the DOM while he was in subspace, and the sheer stupidity of what he had done drove Harry into burning the address and vowing to never return. It was one thing to be captured and broken, but to have his loyalties compromised by a muggle kink club would have gotten Harry’s memories wiped had his bosses discovered what happened.</p><p>“It was fun while it lasted, but eventually work became my focus, and I stopped going to the club,” Harry said instead of telling the long story.</p><p>He had thought that he closed that chapter of his life until his boss sent him to go undercover in Exhibitory. Harry still didn’t know if the DOM knew what he had done in his youth or if they had chosen him based on some psych profile or if they had used a random lottery of the Unspeakables.</p><p>Tom studied him, and Harry held his breath, wondering if the man would decide what he said wasn’t enough and punish him. Harry had left enough details out that he wouldn’t argue if Tom did. </p><p>Wait. Full stop.</p><p>What was he thinking? Tom was his captor, not his Dom. How was he already starting to forget this in less than a day? Yes, Tom would probably break him, but damn if Harry was going to make this easy. </p><p>“You’re a sweet sub, aren’t you.”</p><p>“I’m not your sub,” Harry said flatly. </p><p>Tom arched an eyebrow at him. “That’s one.” </p><p>Harry grimaced. He had been so good too. “Trainer,” he added belatedly, not that it helped.</p><p>“I guess that means I’ll get to punish you after all. Are you hungry?” </p><p>Torture by withholding food? Unpleasant but not unexpected. He could take it. “Yes, trainer,” Harry said truthfully. </p><p>Tom reached over him and undid the knots holding his hands captive. He left the cuffs on and dressed Harry before guiding him out of the room. </p><p>They went to the dining room once more. Voldemort wasn’t present, but several others were. The conversation stalled for a moment as the two of them entered the room. Harry’s eyes swept over the faces quickly before he lowered his head, his mind cataloguing everyone present. </p><p>Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy, the Lestrange brothers, Severus Snape, someone Harry thought was Augustus Rookwood but couldn’t be certain, and Barty Crouch Jr. Tom ignored all of them, but Harry could feel eyes boring holes in his back. He stayed close to Tom, thankful Bellatrix wasn’t present, and prayed to Merlin that Tom wouldn’t stay. </p><p>Finally, something in this shitshow went his way. Tom made a plate for himself and swept out of the dining hall, going upstairs to the library once more. He dropped a cushion on the floor and sank into the chair by the fire. “Kneel,” he ordered. </p><p>Harry dropped to his knees on the cushion and watched as Tom placed the food on the table in front and opened a book. He tore off a piece of bread and held it to Harry’s lips.</p><p>He took the offering with his teeth, careful to avoid biting Tom’s fingers. Harry wasn’t a stranger to handfeeding, but he was easily bored by it. He was into the service side of submission, and a partner feeding him felt as though he were the one being served, which just made Harry uncomfortable.</p><p>This time, Harry wasn’t bored. Each bite felt like a stone dropping into his stomach as Harry realised exactly how much he depended on Tom. Tom was his captor, but he was also the one who kept Harry fed, protected him from Voldemort’s followers. Harry couldn’t even entertain fantasies of murdering Tom for everything he was doing to Harry because he had a feeling that he knew what would happen if Tom died. </p><p>The same thing would happen if Tom failed to break him. </p><p>A sadist got off on inflicting pain, but a good sadist found a willing masochist who enjoyed incurring pain. There was aftercare at the end of a scene. Wounds were tended. Subs were checked.</p><p>The Death Eaters were psychopaths. There would be no tending to wounds, no care and comfort at the end. They would brutalize Harry, and they would laugh while he laid broken on the floor. </p><p>Tom was going to break Harry. </p><p>And Harry was going to let him.</p>
