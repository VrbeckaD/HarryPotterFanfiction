  <strong> <em>Coming into his inheritance</em> </strong>
</p><p> </p><p align="justify">Summer 1995:</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">It was one of the hottest summer, which they could ever remember. In his bedroom, Neville Longbottom, sole heir to the Longbottom wealth and to the lordship, groaned in his sleep. It was too hot for him. He had long ago thrown his duvet from the bed, but it gave him no relief.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">It was much too hot for wizards and muggles alike, but for Neville it was all too much. He had only with luck survived another murder attempt by his crazy great-uncle Algernon Longbottom. No matter what Neville tried, his uncle seems to hate him with such a passion, it could be frightening.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">His uncle had tried to drown him at age 4, and then at age 8, he threw him out of a window on the second floor, which only failed, because Neville's magic saved the boy. His grandmother only looked at him with a disappointed look, which told Neville that he would never measure up to her expectations; he will never be like his father, who was a proud order member, a courageous man and not a disappointment to the proud name of the Ancient and Noble House of Longbottom.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Neville had to beg the Sorting Hat not to sort him into Slytherin, but into Gryffindor – or he wouldn't survive to see the new year. The hat had grumbled, but grudgingly accepted Neville's wish.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Although when he felt lonely, he often asked himself, if Slytherin House wouldn't have been better for him. Sure they all believed that the Slytherin Head of House and Potions Master, Severus Snape was the bane of his existence. They couldn't be more wrong.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Neville sought the closeness to Severus. He couldn't perform well in class, something always went wrong. But when he brewed the same potion in detention, when it was only him and the Potions Master. Then he brewed it flawlessly. And he often grabbed without a second thought the robe of the dour Potions Master to inhale the scent, it calmed him down.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">In his sleep, he had ripped of his pyjamas and his boxers, his left hand stroking his hardening cock, while he groaned one name over and over:</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Severus, Severus…”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">He tried to find release, while he only felt hotter, until he came with a loud shout, and shot his cum over his bed. The young teenager, who has changed during the night, suddenly looked up, and growled, his canines showing sharp and deadly, while he was dragged into a vision.</p><hr/><p align="justify">He saw a group of Death Eaters, kneeling in front of the Dark Lord – and in the midst of them the dour Potions Master of Hogwarts, Severus Snape. Voldemort had stood up and walked to his still kneeling followers, while his gaze flickered over them, until he stopped at the Potions Master, and it changed to a lustful one, instead of an annoyed gaze, which it was only a moment prior.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Tell, me Severus, what has happened after my revival?”, hissed the dark Lord, while he grabbed the hair of his Potions Master and never lost his grip on it. This forced the spy to look into the eyes of his Master.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“As you wish, Master. Potter had tried to convince Fudge and the public that you're alive once more, my lord. On orders of the old fool, I had been forced to show him my Dark Mark. He didn't believe it. He thought it a decoy, to cover up the murder of the Diggory boy. As he and Potter were the last in the maze, Master.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Go on, Severus.”, hissed Voldemort unimpressed, but he let go of the hair. However he used his wand to ensured that the dour man would still look him into the eyes.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Barty Crouch Jr. had been kissed by a Dementor, that had accompanied Fudge to Hogwarts, Master. They found Moody locked into his own trunk, with huge chunks of hair missing, which Barty had used to creating the Polyjuice Potion. The other ingredients did he steal repeatedly from my own stores. He had betrayed himself, as he brought Potter to his office and tried to attack him, which had been stopped by the headmaster and his deputy, my lord. He kept me back, until he get all information from the brat and didn't even allow any treatment for his golden boy.”, sneered Severus.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Had this happened often in the past?”, inquired Voldemort interested.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Indeed, Master. After every adventure of the brat and his annoying friends – the golden trio, as he had named them, he wants the information before he allowed any medical help. He wants me to spy for him again, Master. He really believed, that I would be loyal to him, for trying to hide the Potters from you, Master. And now he wants me to protect their brat with my own life – for Lily – as he never tired to say. He even give me instructions, how I am to treat the boy. And for the new school year, he demands that I teach him occlumency. He seems to fear a connection between you and the brat, Master.”, answered Severus calmly.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“A connection?”, asked Voldemort while he carded his hands through the silky hair of the Potions Master.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Indeed, Master. According to the Mutt, the brat had a disturbing dream, last summer, where he claimed to saw Pettigrew and yourself in an old house, where you killed the Muggle, my lord. Maybe he feared, that you could use this connection for your personal gain. And as always he doesn't care for anyone else. He didn't plan to tell the brat anything, but he thinks, he had the powers to defeat you once more, because of this insane prophecy, Master.”, explained Severus.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Good to know. You can all go, except you, Severus. You'll stay with me, until I say otherwise.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yes, Master.”, replied the Potions Master, bowing deeply to kissed softly the robe of his Dark Lord, on the sign of Voldemort he stand up and walked to the wall on the other side of the room.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The other Death Eater showed their devotion and left silently, until only Severus and the Dark Lord were in the room.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I still have to punish you, for your defiance four years ago – and that you never even tried to look for me, Pet.”, murmured the Dark Lord, as he drew the Potions Master closer to himself, as they were alone in the throne room. “Even, when you have to be careful, when Dumbledore watches you at Hogwarts. Why haven't you got rid of the Potter boy, Severus?”, asked Voldemort as he bit him harshly on his neck.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Severus closed his eyes and answered:</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“The old coot believes that I owe James Potter a life debt for the Shrieking Shack incident on the 20th October 1975, Master. This would compel me to save the boy, as the life debt would be handed over to the brat after the death of James Potter. Until I successfully save his life from mortal peril, he would have me between a rock and a hard place. He had even demanded an unbreakable vow from me, to do anything in my powers to protect the boy, even at the cost of my own life or my magic. Should I protest too loudly, then he would ship me back to Azkaban, after all according to him, I'm still on probation and he holds my custody, Master.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Hm, I see. Maybe with the help of Lucius and some of our other brethren, we will be able to change it. As Fudge is still knee deep into Lucius' pocket he shouldn't be too difficult to get it done. You can leave now, pet. However, you will have to prove yourself to me and your brethren once more. The last 13 years haven't been forgiven nor forgotten yet, my Severus.”, said Voldemort before he bit him again and suck on the open wound, which elicit a moan from his Potions Master.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Pettigrew is a liability, Master. Because of Potter's action in the Shrieking Shack in his 3rd year, the rat owed him a life debt. And he is too cowardly, to be trusted, Master.”, commented Severus after opening his eyes again.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I'll consider it, he had helped me greatly, but he is a weakling. I will bind him to the estate, so that he can't leave, neither in human nor in his animagus form. And what about the Longbottom boy? – the prophecy could have meant him, too. Is he a real danger for me, Severus?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I don't know, Master. The boy puzzled me at times. In class he is a bumbling fool, but when he is in detention with me, he brew every potion flawlessly. He uses his father's wand, instead of owning an own wand. And neither Filius nor Minerva had said anything about it. He is very brilliant in Herbology – a real prodigy and the favourite student of Pomona. He is a member of Gryffindor House, but he didn't really fit into it. It was partly his fault, that Sirius Black got access to Gryffindor Tower in their 3rd year, Master.”, answered Severus thoughtful.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“And what about his home life?”, inquired Voldemort.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I do not know much, Master. According to his own statements, which he had shared with the other Gryffindors of his year, his Great-Uncle Algernon had tried to trigger his magic. He had thrown him from a peer, as the boy was 4 years old. And at age 8 – he had thrown him out of a window on the 2nd floor. His magic has saved him. But the majority of his family seems to believe for years, that he was a squib. His parent are in the Janus Thickey Ward, courtesy of Bella, Rabastan, Rodolphus &amp; Barty, Master. He is the sole heir to the Longbottom Estate, but neither his Grandmother nor his Great-Uncle are happy about it. She wants to raise him into an identical copy of her son, although he seems to have more in common with Alice Longbottom, my lord.”, added Severus.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Would we be able to recruit him, Severus?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I can't say, Sire. It would depend, what you would offer him in return, and if his magic is really strong enough, to be of use, Master. We would have to see, what he would be able to do with another wand, and how to win his interest, Sire.”, replied Severus carefully.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I'll consider it. You can go now, Severus. But, I want you to come back in 3 days, and here is the list of Potions, that I have to expect you to have with you, on our next meeting. Until then, Severus.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Severus greeted him devotely, before he left the room. Only the dark lord was left, as he called his familiar to his side. He petted it lovingly as he mused about his next steps:</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“It would be best to destroy them both, my lovely. The old coot would be devastated to lose them both. His last chance to save the world from me.” chuckled Voldemort darkly. “It is time, to make Severus mine. I only need someone to retrieve the diadem from his hiding place at Hogwarts, I could use Lucius for it. He hasn't paid enough for the destruction and loss of my diary. He will be mine, and I will celebrate it with the public execution of Albus Dumbledore, Neville Longbottom and Harry Potter.”</p><hr/><p align="justify">Severus had returned to Hogwarts, he had no other choice, as he was forced to inform the old coot about the meetings. He could keep parts of it a secret with the help of his occlumency shields, but he had to be careful, or he would be punished by the old coot.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">After giving the password to the gargoyle “Turkish delight”, he could enter the Headmaster's office, where he had been confronted with a very eager Dumbledore.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Ah, my dear boy. What have you for me?”, asked the old man.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“The Dark Lord plans to stay hidden, but he had shown interest in Neville Longbottom and Harry Potter. As you wished it, Headmaster, I did inform him about the events at the end of the Tri-Wizard-Tournament and that I showed the Minister my Dark Mark. I had also been forced to inform him about the strange dream of Mr. Potter and that you have ordered me to teach him occlumency, Albus.”, began Severus, while he sat down in one of the seats before the headmaster's desk.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Anything else, Severus?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“He wanted to know, if Mr. Longbottom can be convinced to choose the dark side and asked questions about his home life, Albus.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Interesting, did he mention your defection from him, Severus?”, inquired Albus interested in learning more of the latest encounter.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yes, he did. He wasn't willing to led it slide. I'm on probation and have to prove myself to be loyal to the cause. I do not need to endanger Potter, as I informed the dark lord about the life debt and hinted, that you would have forced me into a vow, for his protection. Your golden boy is safe.”, sneered Severus.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“When will you see them again, my dear boy?”, asked Albus.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“He demands my presence in three days. I have to brew potions for him, and bring them with me for the next meeting. Is this all, Headmaster? May I go now?”, asked Severus as he stood up, he wanted to crawl into his bed and sleep.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Hm, yes – you can go, my boy. I will talk with Augusta about additional security measures for her estate. Sleep well, Severus.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Good night, Headmaster.”, murmured Severus and left to the Dungeons.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Dumbledore stayed in his office and stroke his phoenix.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“We need to discover his weaknesses, Fawkes. Should he have affection for someone else, than we could use this person as a bait to draw Tom and his followers out in the open.”, spoke Dumbledore to himself. He yawned loudly, before he went to bed.</p><hr/><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Neville had been kicked brutally out of the vision, but he was still in a good mood. He had seen his mate. Soon he would be able to claim him. Severus belongs to him, and he would enjoy to rip anyone else apart, who tried to separate them. With an evil chuckle, did he stretched himself, before he sank once more into Morpheus' arms. His dreams were filled with images of his mate, as he looked at him with love in his eyes, while Neville ravished him and claimed him for the first time.</p>
