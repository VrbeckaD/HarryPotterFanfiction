    <p>“I don’t think I will ever understand you,” Draco hugs him from behind, rests his chin on Harry’s shoulder and presses a gentle kiss against his neck. Harry shudders and thinks there’s no way he’ll ever get used to the sensations that curse through him whenever Draco hugs him like that. It’s all tender and loving and it makes his brain go mush and leaves him with only one thought, <em>namely that he is head over heels in love with Draco Malfoy</em>. Not that that’s anything new, though even seven years after the war <em>The Prophet</em> still begs to differ. He smiles to himself, leans back into Draco’s familiar embrace, relishes in the warmth of Draco’s firm body pressed up against his and sighs softly. Perfection. Utter perfection.</p><p>“Why?” he asks, mildly curious, takes a sip from his hot sugary milky morning tea and resumes looking out of the living room window of Number 12 Grimmauld Place, though there’s nothing at all to see. The street below is deserted, which isn’t surprising since the sky is still pitch-black and will be for at least a few more hours. It’s barely gone five a.m. in the morning and it’s an ungodly hour to be up and about, Harry can admit that much. The eerie silence of the early morning is positively creepy, but it’s a definite improvement to the horrific nightmare that roused him from his sleep and made it sheer impossible to find any peace…let alone continue sleeping. While he would have preferred to stay in bed and curl up at Draco’s side, an overwhelming restlessness, that still lingers now, forced him out of bed and into the downstairs living room.</p><p>He’s secretly glad that Draco got out of bed to investigate his absence because if there’s one thing that Draco is not, it’s a morning person. Especially in the middle of winter. It does not matter how comfortably warm the house is, Draco always manages to come up with a compelling reason to stay in bed. At the very least until after sunrise and more often than not for half of the morning. Harry often wishes he could give into the temptation of spending all his time in bed with Draco. Sadly, being an Auror on active duty does not afford him the same luxury and while Draco can proof-read manuscripts from just about anywhere, Harry’s sense of duty prevents him from being sloppy — <em>or late</em> — when it comes to his job. Even aged twenty-four he has that much sense of responsibility. Draco calls him an <em>old soul</em>, and while he usually tells Draco to cut it out, he secretly loves it. He thinks Draco knows.<br/><br/> “Because you gave up <em>me</em> in favour of <em>this</em>.” Draco answers his question and while Harry isn’t exactly sure what exactly Draco means by ‘<em>this’</em>, he chooses not to ask. Instead, he’s thoroughly distracted when Draco steals his tea. Unlike Draco, he doesn’t protest. He knows Draco — <em>despite his sweet tooth, which he never admits to having, even if he’s chewing a Chocolate Frog</em> — does not appreciate the overly sweet concoction he’s brewed. He doesn’t like it either, but the sugar rush is calming. In Draco’s opinion tea should be unsweetened with just a splash of milk. He considers anything other than that a crime against British tea culture. A mere ten seconds and a muffled sound of disgust later, Draco returns his tea and Harry smiles to himself. Some things never change.</p><p>“I didn’t give <em>you</em> up.” Harry objects. “I gave up a warm bed. <em>You</em> just happened to be in it.”</p><p>“How is that any different from what I just said?” Draco questions and Harry — <em>despite not being able to see his face</em> — just knows that he’s frowning. He thinks it’s quite a feat for such an ungodly hour.</p><p>“I don’t think I’m going to win this.” Harry chuckles and wisely throws in the towel before things can get out of hand. It didn’t take him long to learn when to give up — in fact, a few heated arguments were all it ever took, which is strange because to this day he never backs away from an argument with Hermione Granger, even when he knows he’s wrong. Despite his stubborn nature, and unwillingness to let things go, experience has taught him that while there’s no way Draco will ever catch the Snitch before him in a Quidditch match, Harry will never win a debate against Draco. At least not in this life.</p><p>“No, you won’t,” Draco affirms and places a few feather-light kisses on his neck. Harry sets his teacup down on the windowsill, sighs softly and slowly turns in Draco’s loose embrace. He allows himself a moment to drown in those bright grey-blue eyes, then, as Draco captures his lips in a lazy kiss, closes his own eyes. And as he melts against him, deeply inhaling Draco’s familiar scent, Harry feels the last of his nightmare-induced tension ebb away. “Care to tell me what send you running for the hills?” Draco murmurs against his lips and Harry stiffens a little. They don’t usually talk about his nightmares — <em>or the war for that matter</em> — but Draco distracts him by slipping his warm hands underneath his pyjama top and as he trails his fingertips up and down his spine, Harry relaxes enough to decide there’s absolutely no good reason in keeping the truth from Draco. There’s absolutely no good reason for keeping anything from Draco, ever. He has the disturbing talent of getting to the bottom of things one way or another. How he does it, is beyond Harry, he certainly isn’t using Legilimency. When he remains silent, Draco reminds him of something, he himself said to Draco shortly after the war, though the other way around: “<em>Trusting me was your decision. Proving you right was my choice.</em>”</p><p>“You’ll laugh.” Harry sighs, feeling foolish, stupid, exposed and just a tad embarrassed, though he doesn’t know why. His nightmares are few and far between, but they always strike with no foreboding and still manage to take it out of him. Some more than others.</p><p>“Have I ever?” Draco asks and Harry shakes his head, buries his face in Draco’s chest and breathes deeply.</p><p>“You dying, just like everyone else…after…after that…” Harry suddenly can’t bring himself to be articulate or speak without his voice breaking but something tells him that Draco knows, <em>he just knows</em>. He squeezes his burning eyes shut and silently curses his war-traumatised brain for attacking him when he’s least able to defend himself, <em>in his sleep</em>. He desperately wants to fight the urge to cry — <em>he’s a grown man, damnit, and he’s been to a mind healer for therapy</em> — but when Draco simply tightens his hold on him and hugs him so tight it almost hurts, he loses his resolve to remain tough. He growls into Draco’s chest and hot tears fall, soaking Draco’s silk pyjama. Draco doesn’t shush him, in fact, he doesn’t say anything, just lets him have his moment and Harry counts his lucky stars for the day he decided to befriend Draco Malfoy, against the advice of everyone around him.</p>
