    <p>He was finally out of the mansion that was meant to be his home, however, he had never truly seen it as such. It had become a prison that he was locked inside of with those he despised the most. His mother and father. </p><p>Hogwarts, while he may make people believe he hated it, was an escape that he dreaded leaving every time he had to go home for break. And a place he found himself constantly wishing to return to during those miserable breaks where his parent’s cruelty intensified. </p><p>Sitting on the Hogwarts Express and watching as he left his father and mother behind, it was as if an immense weight had lifted off his shoulders. The new school year had finally started, and it had not seemed to come quick enough. With these thoughts came dread and guilt. While he may be escaping the house and getting away from his father, his mother, no matter how terribly she treated him, was still trapped there.<br/>
He remembered when Narcissa was like how any other normal mother should be, regardless if there was magic involved. She was bright, happy and so proud of him with everything he did. He could fail a test and she would be happy that he had at least tried, for he always did, and she knew that. </p><p>Well, she <em>had</em> known. Now, his mother was nothing like how she used to be, she was stripped down layer by layer by his father until all that was left was a ghost of her old self. He had to watch as she cared less, and the flowers she had once adored grew out of control and spilled out of the garden beds. A state that would have had her crying in outrage before spending a full day trimming and weeding them to utter perfection. </p><p>She had then changed again, also by his father’s doing. She became meaner, and selfish and only noticed, recognized or cared about her son when he had done something to <em>‘disgrace their pure and perfect reputation’</em>. Every day he was constantly reminded of how worthless and pathetic he was. What his mother didn’t know was she didn’t have to repeat it, he had learnt just how truly terrible he was a long time ago.<br/>
It had been a few days since his father’s anger slipped, and while the pain had been unbearable, he had not expected it to still be this bad. He ached everywhere, and it was a surprise his friends surrounding him in the train compartment hadn’t asked about the bruises that were so obviously showing above his collar. Though, in a way he expected them to not care and was grateful, because if they had, there would be questions. Questions he wouldn’t be able to answer. </p><p>The first few days had been terrible, the pain in his ribs had made it nearly impossible for him to breath, it had since faded slightly but wouldn’t completely for a long time. His father had broken his ribs, but no matter how bad it might feel now, he knew that he would feel worse if he told anyone. </p><p>He couldn’t heal his broken bones, but he could heal the tenderness of the more noticeable bruises. He had tried to heal himself once, and he had ended up worse than how he had started. According to his father, healing his wounds was just another thing that was so terribly wrong with Draco Malfoy. At the Manor, when it was just his family, he was not allowed to heal himself, and neither could any of the house elves. The shameful act of having to be disciplined in the first place was to be on display for his parents to see. </p><p>He knew no-one else around him went through things like this, his home life was far from normal, and even though it sounded terrible, he wished someone else was going through the same thing. He wanted to be able to relate to someone and be able to tell them about what happened, and have them say they understood, and <em>actually</em> understand. Even though he had felt alone nearly all his life, he still hated it.<br/>
His friends laughed around him, joking and talking and being normal. They were happy, because of it, a part of him was jealous and wanted them to just <em>shut the hell up</em>.</p><p>He shifted in his seat and with the movement, the pain in his ribs spiked up again, he only let out a small wince, which was so different and opposed to the true burning pain he felt. He had years to practice suppressing his pain and suffering, and if that thought alone didn’t make him sad, nothing did. But it did make him sad, and somehow his dark and gloomy mood stooped down to another level of despair and emptiness. </p><p>He internally sighed as the laughter echoed around the compartment of the train, Pansy Parkinson’s being the loudest. He did not know what they were laughing about and had only briefly glanced at them when they had sat down around him. Pansy had frowned at his appearance, which quite frankly, was a perfect costume for death. His grey eyes were empty and beneath them were dark circles that clearly told everyone around him that he doesn’t sleep, or at least hadn’t in days, both being true. His skin had gone pale, paler than usual, and any bit of extra weight he may have thought he had was long gone. </p><p>Pansy had opened her mouth after sitting down, and he knew that she was going to ask a million questions. He had braced himself, thinking of a hundred excuses to make up for how shit he looked, when Crabbe and Goyle had started a conversation about what they had done over the break, and she was forced to take part in. He had never thanked them or been truly grateful for their presence before, but at that moment he had been.</p><p>The whole train ride he had spent staring out the window watching the green of the forest and grey of the sky whiz past, ignoring reality and letting his mind wander to anything that didn’t involve him. He found himself ‘wasting time’, as his mother had called it, which quite frankly he did more than anything else. </p><p>“Did you hear what I said, Draco?” </p><p>He was brought back to reality, something he didn’t want to do, by Pansy. Tearing his gaze away from the window he looked around at his friends. </p><p>Crabbe was still chuckling quietly to himself at whatever story or joke had been told, dressed in his robes with his cloak folded on the seat next to him, both most likely had been washed and steamed with care by his mother as she had done since his first day.</p><p>Goyle was absentmindedly digging through a box of Birtie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans while watching him from the other end of the seat, his eyes glimmering in amusement. He wasn’t sure if they were laughing at him, but perhaps with how pathetic he was, they were. </p><p>Pansy, his only faithful friend, in which he told <em>nearly</em> everything, was sitting across from him and watching him closely. As if she was looking at a puzzle to be solved. He supposed he was a puzzle, but one with several pieces missing, and each piece being from a different box. </p><p>“What?”</p><p>“I asked how your holidays were,” she said sighing in annoyance. Knowing her she was most likely annoyed, not about him not hearing - she was used to it - but the fact that he had avoided <em>everything</em> since the moment she had first seen him. </p><p>“It was fine,” he lied. He couldn't even be bothered to tell them how his family had traveled to some remote place off the coast of Spain, it had been as terrible as being trapped at the Manor.</p><p>He tensed, something that had become a reflex, when she scanned his rigid body. Damn her. She always knew when something was wrong and was currently giving him the look that said, ‘I’m not dumb’ – thought sometimes that was debatable – ‘I know you’re hiding something, and I will find out what it is.’ It was quite funny, though the first few times she had looked at him like that he had flinched, it had been terrifying to have any attention on him from another person, used to it being the bad kind. He had spent a while quietly dying inside, trying to work out what he had done wrong, but got over it when he realized the true meaning of her look and learnt it was one that came with friendship. </p><p>Noticing the curious eyes of Crabbe and Goyle at her silence, Pansy quickly moved onto another subject. </p><p>“Did you hear about how Professor Lupin is the teacher for Defence Against the Dark Arts again?” And like the idiots they were, Crabbe and Goyle instantly forgot about it.</p><p>“Isn’t he a werewolf?” asked Goyle who searched desperately among the sweets in the box for a good flavor. He smiled and picked up a light blue one before putting in his mouth and started chewing it. Within half a second his face was scrunched up in disgust and was still even after he swallowed it. Crabbe laughed as Goyle cringed, looking like he could puke any second. </p><p>“Yeah, but Dumbledore said that he’ll have a couple days off around the full moon and would be closely monitored during that time and apparently that made everyone happy. So, I’m happy because he was my favorite teacher.”</p><p>“You enjoyed being terrified?” squeaked out Crabbe. Draco remembered what his fear had been when the professor had showed them the Bogart. A small smile made its way onto his face, the first one in days, at the memory. It had been of his cousin, who was special in her own unique way. Her high voice had echoed around the room and the ridiculous heels she wore clicked as she moved. The Bogart had perfectly replicated Crabbe’s cousin, so much so that he had been still shaking an hour later.</p><p>“No,” she smirked, “I liked watching everyone else being terrified. It was entertaining.” Neither she nor Draco had to face the Bogart, thankfully. They were both not planning on revealing the things that they kept buried the deepest and hadn’t even told each other what they were. When it was Potter’s shot, they were beyond relieved when a dementor appeared and Professor Lupin announced the end of the lesson, it meant that he wouldn’t have to answer any questions as to why his father appeared.</p><p>Even though he hadn’t faced it, there was not a doubt in his mind that it would be his father standing there, yelling every foul and horrible thing about him into the classroom.<br/>
The though sent his chills down his spine. </p><p>~</p><p>The rest of the train ride he spent ignoring everybody, specifically Pansy, and looked out the window. It was no surprise that during his daydreaming – a word he believed better described it – that he had not noticed how close they had gotten to Hogwarts. </p><p>The usual chatter that had been consistent on the train ride, now got louder. The laughter and excitement of the students barely contained. He was just as excited to get to Hogwarts, though he was far better at hiding it, but for incredibly different reasons. </p><p>The brown headed boy that ran past the compartment door, a huge smile on his face, was excited for the feast. He would be able to eat and laugh with his friends. Not because he was getting away from his parents.</p><p>And the girl who followed after him laughing, was excited to reunite with her girlfriend in which she hadn’t seen in a couple days, but missed none the less. </p><p>He joined his friends in preparing to get off the train, hiding and suppressing each and every wince that moving caused. The loud noises seeming to echo inside his head, causing the head ache that had been bothering him since this morning even worse. The head ache was probably from the overwhelming noise, or maybe it was the stress, or perhaps it was from when his father had shoved his head against the wall. </p><p> Perhaps it was all three reasons.</p><p>It was like a stampede trying to get out of the compartment alone, so while Crabbe and Goyle shoved their way through people, both Draco and Pansy chose to stay and wait for everyone else to leave. The downside; Pansy could ask questions. </p><p>The moment the other two walked out the door, she faced Draco and pinned him with a glare. On the outside he was calm, a look of boredom on his features. But inside, he was practically dying. </p><p><em>What if she found out? What would she do? Would she leave when she found out how much of a bloody coward he was? Would she laugh?</em> </p><p>Or perhaps not even believe him, just like the one person he thought he could trust. He had been called a liar, just looking for attention or trying to find another way to get what he wanted. It was true – in a way. His family owned things that probably would have the Weasleys drooling but it was never what he wanted.</p><p>The one thing he had only ever wanted, family, would never be his. And maybe that made him selfish and a prick, but he didn’t care. </p><p>“Right, want to tell me what is going on?” Pansy’s gaze had softened to one of concern, the one he was most terrified and hated the most. Her signature sharp cold voice was gone and was replaced with a softer one. Only a select few knew the real Pansy, her parents and him being it. Of course, she had to keep up the asshole Slytherin act in sake of her parents being spies, but she also hated appearing weak. A trait that they both shared, it made them feel vulnerable, but somehow the two could open up more when in each other’s company. </p><p>“Nothing,” Draco sighed, making she sure she heard the irritation. </p><p>“Bullshit,” she spat out, chuckling slightly, probably at his horrible attempt to lie. Her voice had grown cold again and the concern was gone, <em>thank god.</em></p><p>She had most likely seen more than he gave her credit for, she was incredibly smart after all, and if it hadn’t been for the large part of Slytherin in her personality, she would 100% be a Ravenclaw. She kind of was a Slytherin version of Hermione Granger, though she was far less annoying. </p><p>He got up from his seat and began walking towards the door, partly because it was nowhere near as busy and to escape Pansy. She didn’t need to know everything. Looking back, he expected the interest to be gone, like what usually happened when it was something else and he didn’t want to answer, but apparently not this time. </p><p>Ignoring her ever growing concern, he said, “You coming or you just gonna sit there?” </p><p>“Yeah, yeah, I’m coming,” she stood and the two walked off the train.</p><p>~</p>
