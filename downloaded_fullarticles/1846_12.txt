          <div class="userstuff"><p>Pansy gripped their wand as they tore down the narrow corridors after their perp. Their partner, one Jane Olive, had fallen behind, but Pansy pushed on.</p><p>The wizard darted into a room. Pansy followed a beat later. A narrow room, with two desks shoved up against opposing walls. The wizard raised his wand and the door slammed shut behind them.</p><p>Pansy pointed their wand. “Drop your wand. Let’s do this peacefully.”</p><p>The wizard leered. “<em>I</em> heard you were the slut of Hogwarts.”</p><p>“Drop your wand,” Pansy repeated. The man moved, and Pansy snapped out a <em>Protego</em>.</p><p>“<em>Voluptatibus corporis serviens</em><em>!</em>” The red spell missed Pansy—and struck their back on the rebound.</p><p>“<em>Fuck</em>,” Pansy scowled, as their body started rebelling. Tingles, urges welled up, making them want to apparate home immediately. There was sensation down <em>there</em>, and their chest started aching under the restriction of their binder. Something flipped in their stomach, made them want to <em>gag</em>.</p><p>“Come here,” the wizard smirked. He started stalking over.</p><p>Pansy was now even <em>more</em> repulsed by the wizard, the spell twisting Pansy’s body and screaming <em>wrong</em>. Pansy sucked in a sharp breath. “You <em>scum</em>. <em>Expelliarmus! Incarcerous!</em>”</p><p>The human piece of trash came down, anger and confusion equal on his face.</p><p>“You’ve just won yourself another few years in <em>Azkaban</em>. The Imperius Curse might have worked better. If it weren’t for the fact that my parents had me <em>practice</em>.” Pansy snapped out a Patronus and unlocked the door.</p><p>“Ah, Parkinson!” Olive said, sounded somewhat winded. “You got him.”</p><p>“I did. Tried to hit me with a lust spell, too.”</p><p>Olive’s eyes widened. “Are you alright?” she asked. “I can take care of him if you need to—”</p><p>“Ace, remember?” Pansy said. There was more to it than <em>that</em>, but they weren’t one to divulge the nitty gritty.</p><p>“Oh,” Olive gave a relieved smile. And then shot a dark look at the wizard. “Let’s get him back to the DMLE.”</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>Pansy returned home at dinner time, and as they neared the kitchen, they had to stop, as their throat welled up and their chest became tight.</p><p>Accompanied with the subtle scent of dashi and the stronger scent of soy sauce, Pansy could hear Luna humming contentedly. The welling of <em>love</em> and <em>relief</em> after their shit day had Pansy bracing themself against the wall.</p><p>It was going to be <em>okay</em>. Pansy nudged themself forward into the kitchen.</p><p>Luna was scoping out rice into two bowls. She looked up and smiled. “Darling.”</p><p>“Luna.”</p><p>Luna stepped over, opening her arms for a hug. But then she stopped, a furrow appearing between her eyes. “Pansy?”</p><p>Pansy tugged at their robes. “Had some dysphoria, that’s all. It’s—it’s fine now.” The lust spell had also worn off a few hours ago.</p><p>Luna’s face softened. Her hands reached out and grasped Pansy’s hands, pulling them up and tangling fingers together. “Okay.”</p><p>“Okay.” Pansy let themself trace the shape of Luna’s eyes, the tumble of her wavy hair, the curve of her shoulders.</p><p>Pansy worked hard to catch the people who <em>needed</em> to be caught. And Pansy <em>wasn’t</em> going to give <em>him</em> a victory in any sense. It was a disservice to Luna to even <em>think</em> about him.</p><p>Pansy squeezed Luna’s hands back. “Okay,” they said again. “Let me set the table, you’ve done the hard work cooking already.”</p><p>Luna leaned in and pressed a light kiss on Pansy’s cheek. And Pansy finally smiled back.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p></div>
