    <p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Harry read the front page of the Daily Prophet, scrawled across the front page in big letters ‘New Edition of the Sacred 28 to be released.’ Harry scrawled through the article, most of it went over his head. Details of the writer the grandson of the original and intentions to publish an updated edition of ‘The Pure blood Directory’.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What is the Sacred Twenty-Eight?” Harry asked out loud. On the other side of the breakfast table Molly and Arthur Tensed up slightly.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Nothing. To worry about Harry dear...” Molly said warmly.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What is it?” Harry repeated.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“It’s sort of like a book containing all the Still Pure Wizarding Families” Ron leaned over explaining. Harry nodded getting the gist of it. “We’re In it. Well the Weasley family is.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yes well. It isn’t everything, your family wasn’t in it and they did well...” Arthur pointed out</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“They weren’t?” Harry said surprised.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Arthur nodded and explained. “There was a rumour that apparently there was muggle blood in the Potter line somewhere. I suspect it was probably just some feud that got out of control and they used the excuse that it was a common muggle last name...”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry took all this in and sat back, it was something to keep in mind when he visited Gringotts later. Ginny wandered downstairs in a purple dressing gown and looked at Harry curiously. He was wearing fitted robes, that looked considerably expensive.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Why are you so dressed up Harry” Ginny Questioned. They might have been exes, but they were cordial.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’m going to the bank. I need to give them a good impression” Harry shrugged.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Doesn’t he look dignified Ginny?” Molly smiled encouraging. Ginny rolled her eyes.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry peered over at the clock and looked at his surrogate family apologetically. “I have to go. I don’t want to be late. And I probably won’t be back for dinner.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Molly nodded. “Have a good day Harry dear!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry collected up his belongings and left. Apparating to outside the marble steps that led up to Gringotts Bank. Harry strode inside, doing his best to appear confident. He strode past all the goblins and wizards going about their business and walked up to the goblin who stood behind a raised podium. “Hello. I have a meeting...” Harry began.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The goblin peered up over his glasses and down at harry. Momentarily confused by Harrys presence, paused before his eyes went wide. “Oh, Mr Potter! Yes! Yes!” he nodded. “You better come through.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He called to another goblin who gestured for Harry to follow. Following him down the various corridors until he came to a pale glass door. He’d passed them many times on the way to the lift down to the vaults. The goblin he was following opened the door for Harry. Harry walked into to a rather elegant office all things considered. It obviously was designed to put any well-off wizard at ease. “Harry Potter...” The goblin smiled with an attempt at reassuring him.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Hello...” Harry quickly peered down at the metal Name plate. “Quentol. I wanted to talk about my vault. And its contents...”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Quentol nodded and pulled out a pile of papers. “Ahhh Yes, the Potter Fortune” he nodded. “It’s grown considerably over the years. The remaining investments have been giving it a minor flow. There are also the assets covered.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry raised a surprised eyebrow, investments and Assets. He didn’t think the fortune was making any more money beyond interest. “What are the investments?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Well they were mostly sharing your grandfather had in various cosmetics companies” Quentol explained. “A lot have since folded, but you have stakes in a few businesses...”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Okay. Well not what I expected, but I am interested in Pursuing some new investments” Harry added. “You mentioned Assets?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Well you already know of Grimmauld place, there is also the property in Godric’s Hollow…” Quentol looked at Harry nervously. Harry looked down and realised how tense he was.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Sorry…habit...”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“There’s also Potter Manor...”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry looked surprised. “Sorry? Potter Manor?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“It’s located in Wiltshire, a large estate with a Gothic Manor house at its centre. Your grandparents purchased it, your father was intending to sell it, but died before he could sell it off, it’s been sealed since.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry considered this. “Hmm okay, well I want to look at the property.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Of course. We can organise that...” Quentol nodded. “Give me a moment and I’ll find information regarding what investments I can recommend. And copies of your finances for your records.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Thank you that would be appreciated.” Harry nodded politely as Quentol left him in the room alone. “A Manor?” Harry began to chuckle, the thought of him owning a Manor seemed unlikely and yet it appealed. It was something that had been bothering him lately, he'd become quickly disinterested in being an Auror as all it was, he’d be doing the same thing. Fighting and fighting, but deep down, Harry felt done he wanted to enjoy life. He was owed that, the Wizarding world owed him.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Quentol walked back into his office. “I have all your finance information” he said handing over a bundle of paper to Harry. Harry quickly flipped through it and saw a set of numbers. “Is that?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“The total of your finances. Yes...”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry took a sharp intake of breath, “Okay...okay, I can work with this.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Quentol nodded. “I can recommend someone to get you started with investing.” Before the Goblin handed Harry a set of keys and an envelope. “A copy of the deeds and set of keys to the Manor. Would you like someone to accompany you out there.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry shook his head. “If you could...” Quentol nodded and lead Harry out of his office. Quickly sped off down the corridor leaving Harry standing there. “I’ll wait here then...” Harry commented to himself.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>A few minutes past, enough that Harry wished he brought a book. When Quentol returned he was followed by another Goblin much younger yet still had the typical goblin features, “This is Gruffcut, he’ll accompany you out to the manor.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“It’s great to meet you Gruffcut” Harry said offering a hand to him.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Thank you. Should we apperate there?” Harry Questioned Gruffcut.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Probably easiest.” Gruffcut nodded agreeing.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry apparated himself and Gruffcut out to the Manor. Harry looked in awe, he stood on a cobbled driveway grass poking up between the stones. All the grass was tall and would easily hide Gruffcut if he walked into it. Ahead of him was a grand Gothic house. That looked like a series of tall castle towers all jammed together, yet all suiting perfect. It looked grand and eclectic at the same time.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“So, this has been sitting here all this time?” Harry Questioned as he and Gruffcut walked up to the doors. The doors themselves were under an overhang, large ornate opaque glass in the centre of dark wood. Harry pulled out the keys from his pocket and pushed the main one into the lock. He felt a spark and a click and Harry pulled open the doors, that creaked with ancient noise.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry slipped out his wand and cried “Lumos!” A white light appearing at the tip of his wand. Harry let his wand illuminate the room as he walked in. He could smell the must and noticed outlines of furniture, even paintings on the walls.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry turned back to Gruffcut who was fiddling with a candle when suddenly every candle lit up. “There that’s better...” Gruffcut smiled pleased.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“So, this place was just left?” Harry asked as he walked into a sitting room and noticed dust sheets over what he presumed were chairs and cabinets.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I think your father wanted to live a simpler life and intended to sell it off. But when he died it was just easier to seal it until you came of age...” Gruffcut explained. Harry pulled a sheet that seemed to be hanging over a painting and pulled it off. There were two elderly figures standing posing. The male sitting in a chair, greying hair, a healthy paunch and spectacles. While the woman had long hair tied back, slim figure and warm eyes. Harry leant in and rubbed the dust off the inscription ‘Fleamont And Euphemia Potter’</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He took a step back and took in the painting of his grandparents. He’d never seen a picture of them until now. He wondered how much they knew about what happened to their son, his dad.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry spent time exploring the house there was four or five bedrooms some with en-suite, a large dining room, a library, a den and up a high staircase a tower room. Eventually Harry found his way to the kitchen where he expected the smell of rotting food and instead there was nothing, just quiet. The one thing Harry felt as walked into the rooms again, was that they were coming to life. Figures in dusty painting began to move and everything felt like a house.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Harry?” Gruffcut asked, causing him to jump. “Did you want to head back?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry considered and shook his head. “I’d like to spend more time at my new home.” Harry said decisively, he liked the feeling of history the place had. His history.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Well you have the keys and the deeds, I shall leave you to it!” Gruffcut said shaking Harry’s hand once more. “Good day Mr Potter...”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry followed Gruffcut back to the entrance and shut the door behind him. A big smile across his face.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Who is that walking past? Was that James?” an elderly voice said.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry turned on his heels sinking slightly. A knot in stomach reminding that him that probably didn’t know what happened to his parents. He walked back into the lounge and saw the painting of his grandparents peering in his direction. “Is it James?” Fleamont Questioned.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“His glasses are different...it’s not...” Euphemia explained.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Are you sure?” Fleamont Said disbelieving her squinting as he leant forward in his frame.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yes. I’m James Son. Harry Potter...” Harry offered and stepped forward into the light.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Ahh...that explains the similarity! Where is that son of mine these days?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry winced, and sighed. “James...and my mother Lilly died…they were killed when I was baby.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry had always felt heartbroken not knowing his parents, hearing stories, half remembered memories and anecdotes. But seeing the genuine pain and anguish on the painted forms of his grandparents. Hurt, “I’m sorry you didn’t know”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Who raised you?” Euphemia asked worriedly.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry thought about lying, instead he decided what they didn’t know couldn’t hurt them. “I’d rather not talk about it.:”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The two nodded respectfully but both hurt by his answer, “will you be staying here?” Fleamont Questioned.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry nodded. “I do, I want to renovate a little bit Otherwise yes.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Renovate? What’s wrong with it?” Fleamont said a little offended.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Well no power for one...electricity and probably some new plumbing...” Harry explained.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Electricity? Why on earth would you want that muggle invention?” Fleamont asked.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“For a fridge” Harry insisted. Then realised neither grandparent had a clue what that was. “An ice box that doesn’t need ice...”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh? Well that sounds marvellous...” Euphemia said.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry pulled the dust sheet off the chair and began chatting with his grandparents. Deep down he knew it was only a fraction of what they were like, but that was better than nothing.</span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Narcissa took out the bejeweled stopper from the crystal container of brandy. Pouring some into the glass and dropping a few pieces of ice in. It was then in a view of the English country, the grounds of Malfoy Manor and beyond. When she noticed the Manor that sat on the far hill, had lights. She took no notice and then realised she’d never seen the it with lights on.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Lucius? The Manor on the hill. No one lives there?” She asked him. If anyone was to have an idea it was him.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Lucius looked up from the paper. “Hmm? I believe it’s abandoned. Why dear?” Lucius asked.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“The lights on...” Narcissa said simply, Lucius chuckled in disbelief. “Come look...”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>With a sigh Lucius rose, joining his wife looking out the window, following her finger to the distant house windows clearly lit up.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Maybe it’s on fire?” Lucius suggest dryly.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Narcissa rolled her eyes. “Well it would be nice to have neighbours”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Lucius shuddered. “Would it?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Having a social life couldn’t hurt you...” Draco commented sarcastically from the doorway.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“We have other pressing matters, like your court date.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco pouted and crossed his arms. “Please, we know full well I’ll be doing time...”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Draco please don’t talk like that.” Narcissa said getting emotional.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’m being realistic...” Draco sighed. “Well. Did you see the daily Prophet? The Sacred 28 is getting a new edition?” He asked changing topic.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Good. They can finally take the Weasleys off that list...” Lucius grumbled.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Narcissa sighed. “Lucius please...”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Well. They’re blood traitors. It goes without saying...” Lucius insisted as Narcissa handed her husband a glass of brandy. Her and Draco sharing a tired frustrated look.</span>
</p>
