    <p>PROLOGUE</p><p> </p><p>It had been months since they woke.</p><p> </p><p>They had been forced to wait. They would have tried to get to him if they could. But they couldn’t.</p><p> </p><p>It had all started that night, after the maze and after the graveyard. Maybe they had been brought back. Maybe they were never really dead in the first place. It does not do them well to dwell on the how or why of it all. One moment they were there, prepared to die for him… for everything… and the next they were in the ground.</p><p> </p><p>They had dug themselves out of their graves, <em>their graves</em>, in a panic, looking around for him. But he wasn't there. Which meant… which meant what? Where was he?</p><p> </p><p>They went straight for the house. They found it blown half to bits. And he wasn't there.</p><p> </p><p>James was always steady and strategic in a crisis. He paced along the sidewalk, back and forth… <em>Ok, so that's where we should look next. Then, we check with the lads, they might have him. One thing at a time. We'll sort this out.</em> Lily, on the other hand, was manic. Running around, muttering. Arms flailing about her body, winding around her stomach, fisting through her hair. Eyes filling with tears. Horror etched onto her face. <em>Why are we here? What's happened? Where is he? What should we do? Why were we in the ground? WHERE IS MY BABY???</em></p><p> </p><p>That was how they found them. The muggles, that is. People in the neighbourhood were frightened by such outstanding behaviour and they did the only thing they could think of. 'Yes, Constable, if you wouldn’t mind sending someone right away. Yes, yes that's right… Two people… they said they’re looking for their son. But something doesn't seem right. They're covered in soil… And, really, no one’s lived in that house for years. I guess so… Yes, they seem quite mad.. Please hurry.’</p><p> </p><p>Of course, the muggles didn't believe their story. Well, would you have believed them? They were missing nearly 14 years of memory… ‘Yes, indeed. Something's not right here, they'll need to be kept at the hospital until we can find a relative.’</p><p> </p><p>They soon realised what had happened. He had come for them. James had tried to stop him. Lily had tried, too. Calling upon the ancient magic they had practised, that's what must have saved them. In the end, they knew they would have died to protect him and by that time, they had tried everything. It was their last resort.</p><p> </p><p>But what of their son? He hadn't been buried with them, so had he survived? Had they succeeded in protecting him by guarding him with the truest and most ancient magic of all? (Love, of course). The only kind he never would have prepared for? Maybe so. But they wouldn't be able to find out. The muggles kept them in the hospital for months, first in the ward and eventually moved to long-term care, because, of course, no one claimed them. Everyone thought they were dead. The wizarding world knew nothing. There was hardly any magic folk left in the area, so how could they have known?</p><p> </p><p>They were strapped to the hospital cots, both of them, day after day. The muggles thought them insane. <em>Please! Please! My baby! Please find him… </em></p><p> </p><p>‘Ma'am, there is no record of your son. We've looked, we can’t seem to locate him or any evidence of his existence. Please try to hold onto reality here, we are only trying to help you.’</p><p> </p><p>‘Sir, please, what's the last thing you remember? Has anything traumatic happened to you in the last few months? Car accident, maybe?’</p><p> </p><p>James and Lily caused quite the ruckus. They were drugged, trapped, devoid of all hope. They were both showing signs of accidental magic, they had no access to wands, no outlet for their magic. She had always been the more powerful of the two. He had the natural talent, the easy success that came from growing up with magic, the kind of confidence that couldn’t be shaken. But she was gifted, born with more power than most. She would scream and cry out - the lights would flicker, the building seemed to shake, the windows would flash open, a cold wind sweeping through the hospital, her ear-splitting cries of rage and heartbreak would ring across the hallways. Every time they would strap him down, they would come back and he would be out. They would lock the doors and he would get out. When they would try to separate him from his wife, they found her cot would roll back to him of it's own accord.</p><p> </p><p>They tried to escape, obviously. They had to find their son. However, they could only try. James was never that good at wandless magic. He simply didn’t have the juice on his own. Lily could have managed it - in fact she almost did, several times. But they would catch her just in time, pin her to the ground and pump her so full of drugs she wouldn't wake for days. </p><p> </p><p>All of this, all the concerning behaviour, the strange happenings… made the muggles all the more sure that these two needed to stay at the hospital. They were, very clearly, not well at all.</p><p> </p><p>…</p><p> </p><p>One day, many weeks later, a woman entered long-term care. Her name was Margaret Wells and she had come to the hospital that day to visit her oldest friend. We really don’t need to get into the specifics of Margaret’s story. Here’s the only thing you need to know about her: she’s a <em>squib. </em>Her family all had magical blood, she married a wizard, all her children and grandchildren had magic too.</p><p> </p><p>On this particular day, Margaret took a different route to her friend’s room. She had stopped to freshen up on her way and had passed a few rooms she wouldn’t normally have done. And so, she was surprised at what she overheard.</p><p> </p><p>‘I told you already a thousand times… please just listen to me… I promise I’m telling the truth. My name is James Potter and this is my wife, Lily Potter. We need to find our son, Harry.’</p><p> </p><p>The man sounded exasperated, his voice was tired and soft. But his words were clear. And they clearly rang through the ears of Margaret Wells, the only person in that hospital who knew the significance of what she overheard.</p><p> </p><p>Mrs Wells phoned her husband right away. ‘Well, yes of course, dear… You know I’ve considered every possibility. It’s not only because of that. Everything else fits too. There’s magic here, I know it, I can feel it… I’m sure it’s them, dear.’</p><p> </p><p>Mr Wells sent an owl to the headmaster at Hogwarts.</p><p> </p><p>Albus Dumbledore did not quite understand what to do with this information, at least not at first. <em>How could this be? No magic can reawaken the dead. </em></p><p> </p><p>Dumbledore took the time to investigate this very carefully. This could very easily be a hoax. Now, you and I know they are the real James and Lily Potter. You and I know that magic is magic. If magic exists that can make people die, then why is it so hard to believe that magic can make people live? It doesn’t seem all that far-fetched to me. Dumbledore, however, has always been a self-assured, rigid man. Such constraints exist in his life: no magic can bring the back the dead, family can only be made from blood, the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few, we are each born with a destiny we must fulfil, power is the greatest asset we can possess… He had never seen anything like this happen before so it couldn’t be happening now. He had tried to bring his own loved ones back but he had failed. If <em>he </em>couldn’t do it, then surely no one else could manage it?</p><p> </p><p>So, he had trouble believing. He was, for some time, operating under the impression that this was all a hoax, meant to lure the Order of the Phoenix out from their secret hiding place. On account of this assumption, Dumbledore thought it best to investigate this matter personally and involve no one until he could prove the falsity. The first step was investigating the original claim.</p><p> </p><p>He managed to discover that two people existed at that hospital at that very moment. The claim from Mrs Wells had been as true as she could make it, she was very nearly sure of what she saw. <em>Just because she believes it, doesn’t make it true.</em></p><p> </p><p>Dumbledore accompanied Mrs Wells to the hospital one morning. James and Lily were elated to see him. They had been desperate for a connection to their world, to their son. Dumbledore did not flinch.</p><p> </p><p>‘Albus.. it’s really us.’</p><p> </p><p>‘I shall be the one to determine that.’</p><p> </p><p>He spent weeks quizzing them, day after day. Asking them the sorts of questions only the real James and Lily could have known how to answer. The basics at first, then more serious.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>What was the password to my office the very first time James Potter entered it?</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>What is the significance of the words Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs?</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Who did you originally nominate for secret keeper? Who was the true secret keeper?</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>What is Petunia Dursley’s address?</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Dumbledore sifted through their memories in an attempt to prove what he thought, that they were indeed imposters. Answers and anecdotes could be faked, memories could only be true. When he looked into their minds he saw only the James and Lily he remembered. He observed them for days and provoked outbursts which led to performances of magic. Their personalities were just as he remembered. Their talents with magic were well within the range of the true James and Lily. As a very last check, he had them perform their patronus charms. They were, of course, able to produce the stag and the doe. Dumbledore was yet to see another patronus pair like theirs. <em>I’ve never felt so glad to be wrong.</em></p><p> </p><p>‘I told you. It’s us.’</p><p> </p><p>‘I am ever so glad to see you both again.’</p><p> </p><p>Dumbledore took some time to explain that night, the one that had led to them waking in the ground. He very purposefully left out almost everything. Finally, James and Lily knew their son was alive. They knew Voldemort was rising again, in the flesh. The meeting of their son and their enemy had created the reaction that had woken them. There’s more to it than that, of course. But it does not do them well to dwell on the how or why of it all.</p><p> </p><p>Dumbledore’s actions in the coming weeks were very well thought out and well reasoned. He could not tell anyone that he had discovered them alive. Voldemort’s greatest enemies returned in flesh of their own? This would be their greatest advantage yet. This could be the asset they needed to succeed. Think of the lives they could save, the destruction they could prevent with this kind of advantage. <em>The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few. </em></p><p> </p><p>The muggles at the hospital could not know, they needed to treat their patients the same as they had before. They could not afford to arouse suspicion. Dumbledore arranged it so they would stay there a few weeks longer. James and Lily did not like this. Oh, they did not like this at all.</p><p> </p><p>Reuniting with their son was all they wanted. They needed to see him, to hold him, to tell him everything was going to be alright, to tell him they would protect him. But they were not given this chance. Dumbledore did not think that this was the time for sentimental reunions, plans needed to be made. The Order needed to be readjusted to accommodate this. Harry would have to wait.</p><p> </p><p>It seemed he planned to leave them there for much longer under the same anonymity. However, when Mrs Wells reported back to Dumbledore some time later, she told him how (they were filled with new found hope and determination, I’m sure you can understand) James had unlocked every door on the entire floor and replaced every wheelchair with a bean bag. She explained how Lily had set fire to the nurses station 8 times and how her rage has smashed every window in the building. It was only when Mrs Wells told him this that he thought they might need to be removed.</p><p> </p><p>Dumbledore knew what they were trying to do - giving the hospital a hard time so that he would be forced to remove them. They knew he would never risk leaving them there with such obvious signs of magical interference that could catch the eye of the Ministry, or even worse, the Death Eaters.</p><p> </p><p>McGonagall and Flitwick were the first to see them. They helped James and Lily get sorted out and gave them back their wands. ‘It is about to be the Christmas Holidays,’ said McGonagall. ‘The children will be on the train, arriving in London very soon.’</p><p> </p><p>‘And Harry?’</p><p> </p><p>‘We shall bring you to the new Order headquarters, where you’ll be staying. Harry and the others will be along shortly.’</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>This is where our story truly begins.</p><p> </p>
