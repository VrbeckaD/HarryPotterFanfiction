    <p>Number twelve Grimmauld Place was a curious building. The house sat between numbers eleven and thirteen unseen by wizards and muggles alike unless the secret keeper of the property had confided its existence to the individual. </p><p>Carmilla had never set foot in the property until a month previously but now this was her permanent home. The house itself had fallen into disrepair in the time it had spent uninhabited, cobwebs and dust were regular occurrences throughout the many rooms along with more doxys than was even remotely funny.</p><p>She had come to live here in the home of her mother’s cousin Sirius Black after completing her seventh year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Going back to her mother’s house wasn’t an option she would have considered even if it had been remotely viable. She wanted nothing to do with her mother or younger brother, after having been brought up in a household that worshipped the embodiment of all that was wrong in the wizarding world she had to get out.</p><p>Her mother was a Death Eater and had groomed her brother into being one as well, she had of course tried to do the same to Carmilla but had no luck. Carmilla wasn’t interested in Pureblood elitism or putting herself above others, she wanted to learn and better herself. She’d been sorted into Ravenclaw, something her mother wasn’t pleased about but she didn’t care. As she grew older though she rebelled more against her mother and read muggle books learning things about the non-magical world and even brought home muggle items to annoy her mother further. She’d been on the receiving end of the Cruciatus curse more than once in response to her ‘acting out’. </p><p>Sirius was more than happy to give Carmilla a place to live, Grimmauld Place was to be headquarters for the newly reformed Order of the Phoenix so one more person around the house wouldn’t be trouble as far as he could see. Carmilla knew that wasn’t the only reason though, Sirius himself had suffered an eerily similar upbringing to her and had been disowned for not making Slytherin just as she had. They had both rebelled by taking an interest in the muggle world and were more alike than even they knew, two members of the noble house of Black who hated all that it stood for.</p><p>The house had been more alive in the last month than it probably had been in its entire existence. The Weasley family had moved in, both to help clean the place up and to make it easier to keep up with the Order related business. Various members of the Order came and went at all hours of the day and some, like her cousin Tonks, had set up permanent residence within the house.</p><p>Nymphadora Tonks at only nineteen years old was quickly rising through the ranks of the Auror Office; she’d shown potential very early on in training, so much so that Madeye Moody had taken her under his wing. It was also beneficial to her position that she was a metamorphmagus allowing her to change her appearance at will and undertake a number of different missions with more ease than a wizard using Polyjuice Potion or a spell. Tonks was the only family Carmilla really spoke to of her own free will before Sirius’s return from Azkaban.</p><p>One thing Carmilla had always found difficult to understand was how Andromeda Tonks was such a caring and nice woman when her three sisters, including Carmilla’s own mother, where all followers of the Dark Lord. She supposed it had to of been a similar situation to her own or Sirius’s but she wasn’t one to pry.</p><p>This morning though, Carmilla found herself sitting alone at the kitchen table waiting for Laura to arrive. Laura’s dad had been reluctant to let her leave home so soon after finishing her last year of school but with guarantees of her safety from both Tonks and Mrs Weasley, he’d agreed to let her move into Grimmauld Place with Carmilla as long as she spent some time at home first. </p><p>So Carmilla waited while going over notes from Tonks’s last mission, she’d been sent to scope out creepy old bar in a small wizarding village up North. There was no conclusive evidence that anything suspicious was happening there, Carmilla sighed and leaned back in her chair. She wasn’t that surprised if she was being honest with herself, the tip off had come from Mundungus and he wasn’t the most reliable of sources. Running a hand through her hair she checked the time, 6:47am, she thought of going back to bed but Laura had said she’d be there at 7am and Carmilla had never known Laura to be late.</p><p>At the sound of footsteps coming downstairs Carmilla gathered the parchment she was reading and placed the notes in a drawer that contained various pieces of information used during meetings of the Order. The underage Weasley’s and Hermione, who’d shown up just two days ago, weren’t allowed to attend or know any information that wasn’t cleared with Mrs Weasley first, this meant anything to do with Order work was to be cleared away in their presence. She needn’t have bothered clearing her things away when she realised it was Lafontaine who entered the kitchen. </p><p>Lafontaine was Carmilla’s fellow Ravenclaw and the one friend she made at school, the rest of the ‘Scooby Gang’, as Laura and Kirsch had dubbed them, had been more Laura’s friends than hers. She found herself quite fond of Perry despite her best efforts to stay distanced from the group and she supposed she enjoyed the company of the muggle born Kirsch, but there was no way that anyone would get her to admit that she also had a soft spot for Danny. Even of Danny had been a jealous asshole, in Carmilla’s opinion, when she and Laura finally got their shit together and started dating.</p><p>Laf gracelessly dropped into the chair beside her while Carmilla used her wand to pour a cup of coffee and lightly place it in front of Laf.</p><p>“Thanks” the redhead yawned before taking a sip of the caffeine, “ahhh that’s good, so when’s L getting here?”<br/>
Carmilla’s eyes went to the clock before answering “eight minutes.”</p><p> “You know you can act more excited” Laf smirked “it’s just you and me here.”</p><p>Carmilla let a small smile grace her features, so maybe she wasn’t the most open of people. She wasn’t exactly raised in the most loving environment and emotions weren’t something she was taught to deal with properly, but everyone knew she had missed Laura. Carmilla hadn’t mentioned anything about it although she had been slightly grumpier than usual but the past few days she’d been in a relatively good mood which everyone knew was due to the short blonde’s imminent arrival.</p><p>“Alright fine” she rolled her eyes “I’m excited about seeing Laura, I haven’t seen her for a month and I missed her” she turned to look at the grinning redhead “happy?”</p><p>“Oh I’m ecstatic” Laf laughed before standing up “I’ll leave you to greet her alone” they winked at the raven haired girl “I’ll be working in the attic if you need me” Lafontaine informed Carmilla before leaving the room. </p><p>Carmilla heard her friend disappear back upstairs and took in the renewed silence for a moment; the clock showed 6:59am when she heard the front door open and the muffled familiar voices of two people enter the house. She allowed herself a self-indulgent moment where she smiled wider than she had since the last time she saw her girlfriend but quickly regained some of her naturally cool and mysterious nature before going into the hall to greet the arrivals.</p><p>“Well we sort of unanimously agreed that it’d be better me escorting you rather than Madeye” Tonks told the short blonde “figured he might scare the surrounding muggles… not to mention your dad likes me already.”</p><p>Laura laughed cheerily “I think my dad might’ve had second thoughts about me coming if Madeye had been the one to show up.”</p><p>“Well it’s a good job Tonks was free then” Carmilla added from where she was leaning on the wall beside the kitchen.</p><p>The Ravenclaw barely had time to open her arms before the tiny Gryffindor was wrapped around her. Carmilla buried her face in Laura’s neck, Merlin she’d missed her. They weren’t sure quite how long they’d been stood with their arms around each other but it had apparently been long enough for Tonks to sneak off up to her room and for Mr and Mrs Weasley to be up and about. The sound of someone clearing their throat made the pair jump apart; Mrs Weasley simply smiled at the pair before telling them they could go have a long lie seeing as they got up earlier than need be today. </p><p>Laura hugged Mrs Weasley thanking her while Carmilla grabbed her bags and settled for a genuine smile and a quick “thank you”, before disappearing up to their room before any of the other inhabitants of the house woke.</p>
