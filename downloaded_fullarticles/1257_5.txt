    <p>He’s miserable</p>
<p>Alone</p>
<p>Hungry</p>
<p>There’s blood everywhere</p>
<p>A teeth beside his pillow</p>
<p>Vomit on the floorboard</p>
<p>Cracked ribs</p>
<p>A black eye</p>
<p>Cuts on his back</p>
<p>Outside</p>
<p>The Dursleys laugh</p>
<p>Smell of food flows from the opening of his door</p>
<p>His stomach grumbles pitfully</p>
<p>Hatred forms in his heart</p>
<p>And the Horcrux stirs curiously</p>
