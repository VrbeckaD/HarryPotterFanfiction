    <p>The common room was ablaze. Fires roared in the grates, exploding snap sizzled in every corner. Sirius watched the scene by one of the large, stained glass windows, feeling the coolness of the snow falling outside against the back of his neck, a relief from the heat of the party within.</p><p>“<em>Fuck</em> yes—“ James stumbled slightly into the center of the room, Lily not far behind him, laughing but supporting him more than he was actually standing. James raised his bottle of butterbeer over his head, glasses sliding down his nose, “It’s <em>fucking</em> Christmas!”</p><p>His declaration was met with much too enthusiastic cheers from the room and Sirius laughed, letting out a loud <em>woop</em> and earning a finger point from a very drunk James Potter.</p><p>“Hm, well, look who we found here? Waiting like the slut he is,” Sirius heard footsteps stop behind him, “right under the mistletoe.”</p><p>Sirius swallowed, lowering his butterbeer from his lips and turning around, “Octavian. Who invited you?”</p><p>The taller boy smirked, flashing his straight teeth, his tongue peaking out to wet his lower lip, “You don’t think I belong in this party?”</p><p>“I think you’re a snake.”</p><p>Octavian stepped forward, “And what do you have against snakes? After all, you’re <em>bred</em> from them. Oh look,” His eyes flickered upward, “Now we’re both under it.”</p><p>Sirius narrowed his eyes at him, confused, before following his gaze. There, hung from a wooden beam above them, was a small sprig of mistletoe. Sirius rolled his eyes, “Fuck off.”</p><p>“What, you don’t want to kiss me?” Octavian’s hand was suddenly on Sirius’ hip.</p><p>Sirius knew that he could have simply pushed Octavian off. He could have not caused a scene that would most definitely be noticed—and encouraged—by their intoxicated onlookers. Instead, he raised his glass, still mostly full, and gracefully proceeded to throw the sugary liquid into Octavian’s perfect hair and teeth. The boy spluttered, his hand retreating to wipe at his eyes.</p><p>“Fucking hell, Black!“</p><p>“Excuse me.”</p><p>Sirius sidestepped him, easily avoiding the mess, and made his way over to Lily and Marlene who were laughing too hard over what they had clearly just witnessed.</p><p>“Merlin, Sirius,” Lily leaned into his open side hug, hitting his chest a few times, “That was something out of a muggle film.”</p><p>“No one gets that reference, Lily.” Marlene was practically bouncing on her toes, “Do you think it’s overkill if I go over there and do it too?”</p><p>“Sirius had a reason to, you can’t do it.”</p><p>“Sirius had a reason to do what?”</p><p>The three of them looked up at Remus, who had appeared by Sirius’ shoulder, his hand resting gently on his waist, his cheek dropping briefly against Sirius’ temple as a hello.</p><p>“Octavian over there was trying to trap Sirius under some mistletoe—I mean, honestly, I think James hung it everywhere <em>specifically</em> for you, Lils.” Marlene rolled her eyes, “Anyway, you missed a great show.”</p><p>“A show?” There was an edge to Remus’ voice, and Sirius instantly imagined what he must be thinking they meant by ‘show.’ </p><p>He raised his empty glass, “He’ll smell like caramel for weeks, courtesy of Padfoot.”</p><p>“Oh.” He sounded relieved, but Sirius didn’t feel his muscles relax, “Well. Serves him right.”</p><p>Marlene let out a little laugh, eyes flicking up and down Remus, “Alright there, Lupin?”</p><p>“Fine. Sirius?” Suddenly there was a hand in Sirius’ and he was being tugged away, only just managing to hand Lily his empty glass.</p><p>“Re—“ Sirius laughed as he stumbled a bit, “Okay, you have to remember that you are dragging a slightly intoxicated person behind you who may—fuck—“ Sirius narrowly avoiding smashing into a side table with his hip, “may not be the best at maneuvering right now.”</p><p>Remus halted, drawing Remus to his chest as they reached the foot of the stairs. Sirius let out a whoosh of breath at the sudden halt and looked up at Remus. His hair was fluffed out around his ears from the eat of the fire, his scars pink like the flush of his cheeks. His hands, for once, weren’t cold against the bare strip of skin beneath Sirius’ jumper.</p><p>“Sorry, love.” Remus mumbled, but that was all he said before—more gently—pulling Remus up towards the dormitories.</p><p>“Hm, I like this direction.” Sirius laughed as he followed Remus through the door, only to have it cut off as he was pushed against it, causing it to close with a slam, rattling the mirror to their left.</p><p>“Fuck.” Sirius mumbled as Remus loomed over him, palms already pressing to his cheeks, “I really like this direction.”</p><p>“I’ve always hated that fucker.” Sirius opened his mouth to respond but Remus’ thumb was there, running over his lower lip and making Sirius’ words cut off in a soft gasp, “Mistletoe…Who the hell does he think he is…”</p><p>And Sirius felt it, as he always did when Remus got like this. The tingle under his skin, the spike in his blood.</p><p>“Fuck.” He mumbled again. His fingers dug into Remus’ sweater and he pulled him closer, smiling, “You don’t have to wait for mistletoe, do you, love?”</p><p>“I definitely do not. Think people need to learn that already…” Remus leaned down, pressing a hard kiss to Sirius’ mouth, his arms wrapping fully around his body to pull him away from the wall and closer to his chest.</p><p>Sirius leaned forward, pressing onto his toes and looped his arms around Remus’ neck. They stayed like that for a moment, enjoying the silence for the most part, but laughing at the occasional muffled cheering that rose from downstairs.</p><p>“Do you recon James is dancing on a table, or something?” Remus said quietly, nose bumping into Sirius’ as he spoke.</p><p>“Do you really care?” Sirius pushed his fingers into Remus’ hair, “Can’t we stay here? Octavian is down there…don’t want him getting his hands on me ag—”</p><p>“That’s <em>enough</em>—“ Remus laughed, stopping Sirius’ words with a kiss, peppering them against his lips, “Guess I just have to resort to stealing you away up here.”</p><p>Sirius grinned up at him, eyes flicking over his face, looking warm even in the dim room, “Guess so.”</p><p> Remus’ thumb brushed across his cheekbone, “Where only I can have you.”</p><p>“Well,” Sirius pressed another soft kiss to Remus’ mouth, “I think that’s true no matter where we are, don’t you?”</p>
