    <p> </p><p>George was having an unbelievably good dream. A kind he'd never had before. At least, not one he remembered having before. Blood pumped and sweat dripped, but he couldn't tell if it was his blood and sweat, or the other boy's. Perhaps both? And there was, indeed, another boy. He didn't look like anything or anyone in this dream state. There was no face to focus on, no real features to discern. The only constants were that he was clearly male, around George's own age of fourteen, and he was naked. </p><p>    The dream was pulling forth feelings he didn't realize he was capable of having. Barely lucid, George sought around for a word to describe the tightly roiling pressure in his gut and the lightness in his chest, the aching desire that was caused by what was happening in the dream. The word he was looking for was arousal, but before he found it his attention was pulled away as the naked nobody-boy began to touch him. Touch him in places no one had ever touched him before. Hands, more than the two the other boy should have, slid up and between George's thighs, squeezed his plump rear, pressed against his smooth chest and back. And it felt <em>good!</em></p><p>    George realized then that he too was naked. As soon as the realization hit him, all the hands moved to his crotch and butt. They gripped his member and stroked slowly. Fingers slipped between his butt cheeks, pulling them gently apart while tips teased at his hole. He sighed contentedly, letting them do whatever they wanted. It just felt <em>fantastic!</em> George moaned out, beginning to thrust lightly into the grip around his-</p><p>     "Oi, wake up!" </p><p>     Something grabbed and shook George's shoulder. His dream became erased and his eyes flashed open, only to close tight back a fraction of a second later to hide from a sharp ray of golden sunlight coming through the window to his left. </p><p>    "Mum says breakfast is ready," said the voice of George's twin brother Fred. And was he just groggy, or was there a strange tinge to Fred's voice? "She wants us to get dressed first. She's caught on to us staying in our pajamas all day to avoid going outside."</p><p>    George felt a second shake at his shoulder and sat up slowly, eyes still closed. He shrugged off Fred's hand and hesitantly opened one eye. The brightness of the room barely let him open it, but he got a good look around nonetheless. </p><p>     Their room was a mess. They'd only just gotten home from Hogwarts for the summer two weeks earlier and hadn't exactly unpacked. Their two trunks sat open against the wall in front of the window, contents strewn everywhere. Too lazy to put away their things, Fred and George had simply dug through the trunks to find something whenever they needed. Old sweet wrappers and dirty clothes covered the floor, as well as the remains of more than a few Doctor Fillibuster's No-Heat Wet-Start Fireworks (their surplus from Hogwarts, which they had lit all at once a few days after arriving back home). </p><p>    George shifted his gaze to his brother, the only person who could safely wake him up without fear of a grumpy prank in retribution. Fred was already dressed in his casual muggle attire of blue jeans, a plain red t-shirt that clashed violently with his hair, and a pair of old white sneakers that were now covered in grime and dirt. George was still too tired to notice the odd, curious look his brother was giving him. </p><p>    "Morning to you t-t-t-too!" George yawned widely, daring to open his second brown eye as the first one grew accustomed to the brightness. He still had to squint but was no longer at the 'act like a vampire' stage of waking up.</p><p>    "You get dressed," Fred instructed, turning to walk away from his and George's bed to the open door. "I'm heading down to make sure I get some sausage before Percy eats it all, again." </p><p>   George snorted. "Save some for me if you can. I'll be down in a bit." </p><p>     Fred closed the door behind him as he left. George took another moment to get used to the light, then stood and stretched, trying to remember the dream he had been having. The specifics were already slipping away, but he was able to recall the overall framework of it. Someone touching him, making him feel good. Was it another guy? Chill bumps rose on his arms at that thought, but he couldn't quite remember so he discarded the thought and moved on. He wasn't sure where the dream had come from, but then no one ever really has control over their dreams. He recalled where he'd felt some of the touches and glanced down. </p><p>    There was a tent in his pajama bottoms, and the tip of the tent was ever so slightly damp. George blushed, unsure of what to do. This had happened once or twice before in the past few months, maybe even a little more than that, but it hadn't been anything like this. Then he'd been wearing robes so it wasn't noticeable, and he had been able to ignore it and the erection had gone away quickly. But now it was demanding his attention! He hadn't felt like this before, either. Like his heart was trying to reach out through his chest, like he absolutely <em>had</em> to touch himself down below. </p><p>     George cleared his throat, still blushing, and slipped a hand under his pajama bottoms to gently feel his penis. It was stiff, though not fully, and was still a little soft and bendy. He pushed the bottoms off to get a better look, unbuttoning his shirt as well when it got in the way; he had to strip anyway. Both items of clothing joined all the other dirty clothes on the floor.</p><p>   He looked at himself with curious eyes. His penis, normally soft and fleshy and small, was now long and hard and big. The skin felt hot against his fingertips. Instinctively, George wrapped his hand solidly around the shaft and pulled down. He gasped loudly, legs shaking, as his foreskin rolled softly off his swollen and shiny purple head, bringing him an intense tickling pleasure. </p><p>    George stroked experimentally up and down twice more, and quickly had to sit back upon his and Fred's bed due to the pleasure. He could see and feel himself getting stiffer. His cock was beginning to stretch and ache, though it still felt good. </p><p>     Something else caught George's eye, something he hadn't noticed before because he never really examined himself down there. He was growing a few wisps of fiery orange hair just above the base of his shaft! They hadn't been there a few short weeks earlier. At least, he didn't think they had. He ran two fingers from his free hand over them. There were only a few, but now that he was actually looking they were very noticeable. They felt more coarse than the hair on his head, despite the fact that they were shorter. </p><p>   A deep, burning curiosity took hold of George's mind. Living in a houseful of boys and being somewhat popular at school meant he had no illusions about what was happening, but that didn't mean he knew what to do with this information, how to react, how to feel. He was fairly certain that he'd hit puberty, and he recognized the embarrassing nature of the subject. But he <em>had</em> to know more! To exercise his curious mind, to find sympathy in another to help him come to terms. Only, there was no way he was going to talk to his parents about it. Far too embarrassing. Bill and Charlie had already left for their jobs, Percy was an uptight prat, and Ron was younger than George was. </p><p>     It wasn't like George needed to weigh his options on who to talk with, though. Fred, his twin brother, was the perfect, most obvious choice. The <em>only</em> choice! They shared everything together, no matter how potentially embarrassing. They always had. Hell, they even shared a bed! They were effectively desensitized to anything odd relating to each other. </p><p>   And, of course, they were identical. Surely that meant Fred would understand exactly what George was going through. He may not have answers, but he would have a different perspective and a fountain of sympathy.</p><p>      "George, dear, quit dallying and come down for breakfast!" His mother's voice hollered from downstairs, jerking George to reality. </p><p>    He shook his head, blushing, then hurriedly got dressed in his own Muggle Casuals. Though sometimes he and Feed purposefully dressed the same to confuse people, more often than not they liked being individually identifiable. So George threw on a pair of tan shorts and a spring green T-shirt (that somehow clashed with his hair every but as much as Fred's had done), adjusted himself so that hopefully his still pulsing (though deflating) erection wouldn't be noticed, then headed downstairs. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p> </p><p>    George held in a burp as he set his fork on his empty plate and drained the last of his orange juice from his glass. He and Fred belched all the time during meals (mostly to annoy Percy), and for the most part, the family was used to it. But for now he wanted to stay off of his mother's nerves. </p><p>     "So. . ." George began as Ron rose from the table to grab the last slice of toast from a tray in the kitchen. Percy, his hair freshly combed and glasses polished, glanced briefly up from his copy of <em>the daily prophet</em> to look at him with disinterest. Despite the fact that school was out and would remain so for another couple of months his Prefect badge was pinned proudly on the front of his robes. As if anyone new would see it. It wasn't as if they ever had visitors. </p><p>    "Yes, dear?" George's mother prompted. Ginny had her fork in her mouth but was looking away, clearly listening but trying to act like she wasn't. Mrs. Weasley smiled kindly. </p><p>    "Fred and I were thinking we would go down to the village after we helped clean up breakfast. That's okay, right?"</p><p>    Fred shot him a curious look. They hadn't talked to each other about visiting their getaway in the village at all, but he kept quiet, as George knew he would. Fred would know that George had something to discuss with him. </p><p>    Mrs. Weasley frowned. "No, it's not. Your father had to go to work early today to finish his report on those biting doorknobs in Reading today, remember?" The twins' eyes shot quickly to the large, odd clock on the wall, where their father's hand was situated on "work" between "traveling" and "mortal peril."</p><p>   "You and Fred are supposed to clean the Chicken coop since he's not here to do it," continued Mrs. Weasley. "After you finish that and have your lunch you two are free to go off and be boys together."</p><p>    "Come on, mum!" Fred groaned indignantly. "We're not allowed to use magic outside school. It'll take us <em>ages!</em> to clean in there. Can't you just pop in, say a quick <em>'Scourgify,'</em> and let us be on our way?" </p><p>     Their mother's scowl returned, along with Ron. The youngest Weasley boy chewed slowly at his toast as he lowered himself back into his seat, muscles tense in case one of his brothers said the wrong thing and set Mrs. Weasley off. Percy flipped a page in his paper, apparently oblivious to all the others. </p><p>     "It builds character," their mother said. George heaved a heavy sigh and Fred rolled his eyes. Mrs. Weasley pretended she didn't notice. </p><p>    "<strong>And,</strong>" she intoned, "I haven't got any time. Ginny and I are leaving directly after breakfast to go over the hill to the Lovegoods. They've offered us some of their Dirigible Plums, and it will be good for Ginny to interact with another girl her age." </p><p>     "What in Merlin's name is a Dirigible Plum?" Ron set down a half-eaten slice of toast, looking perplexed. </p><p>    "It's a plum, Ron," George snorted, "just a Dirigible one. Honestly, who knows what it is. For all we know it's a plain old carrot."</p><p>    Mrs. Weasley scowled, casting a narrow-eyed look of disapproval at George before turning to answer Ron. "You know, I'm not sure. Whatever it is, it seems edible and it would be rude not to accept." She said the last part in a stiff voice. The true meaning was clear. They were in no position to turn away free produce. George was inclined to agree, though his stomach still gave an uneasy lurch, as it normally did when he thought about his family's station. </p><p>    "What about Ron, then?" Fred asked, nodding his head at his younger brother. "It'd go a lot quicker with three people." </p><p>    "No, it wouldn't," Mrs. Weasley said, annoyance seeping into her voice. "There's not enough room for all three of you in the coop. Besides, Ron's going to be writing to Harry and Hermione and preparing Erol for the trip." </p><p>    George held back a groan of defeat. His eyes shot onto Fred's and a silent message passed between them. They would, for once, do as they were told. After that, they would make a beeline for their hideaway in the nearby village of Ottery St. Catchpole to discuss what had happened to George earlier that morning. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p> </p><p>     "God, I wish Bill or Charlie was still here," George groaned as he and Fred swept up droppings and straw in the chicken coop. Fred nodded stiffly, trying not to breathe in the sweltering air. </p><p>   "Honestly, it would take all of two seconds to clean this with a wand. It's a shame Percy's not of age yet. He could have done this for us."</p><p>    "You're joking? Percy is insufferable enough as is. You really want him to be able to apparate and lord his abilities over us? On top of that, you want to ask him for help? He'd get so puffed-up…." </p><p>    Fred rolled his eyes. "Probably not, but right now I'm willing to try anything."</p><p>    At that moment they heard the front door of the Burrow open and close. A few moments later there was a sharp <em>crack!</em> signaling their mother and Ginny's dissaparation. Fred immediately looked up at his twin. </p><p>   "So, what was that all about at breakfast, us going to the treehouse? You didn't bring it up at all last night." </p><p>     George blushed. He'd expected Fred to confront him before they arrived at their hideaway in the village, but he was too uncomfortable to explain it here. Not uncomfortable with Fred, by any means. He was more comfortable with his twin brother than anyone else on the planet, even Lee Jordan. But he was worried about Ron or Percy overhearing them. </p><p>    "I'll tell you when we get there," he said, hurriedly sweeping up the last of the chickens' mess. </p><p>    Fred grabbed his shoulder softly, eyebrows knitting together. "Hey, are you good, mate? Are we good?" </p><p>   "Yeah! Of course!" George replied in a voice that didn't sound truthful even though he <em>was</em> telling the truth. "I'm good, honest. I just need to talk with you about something. Something, erm, that other people won't hear." </p><p>    Fred nodded, now looking away and blushing himself. George got a strange feeling that his brother already knew what this was about. </p><p> </p><p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p> </p><p>    The twins were covered with sweat by the end of their cleaning. It was a hot July day, after all. But with no appetite save for curiosity they skipped lunch and wasted no time in leaving for the village of Ottery St. Catchpole. It was a bit of a walk, but they were used to making the trek. They arrived at their destination before the hour was out. </p><p>     It was a decrepit, abandoned old house at the edge of town, with a For Sale sign perpetually in the front lawn (which was almost certainly still there due to the twins). They'd been in the house before, but there was nothing to see other than dust and spiders. The house wasn't what they were there for, in any case. </p><p>     Their hideaway was the treehouse in the back yard. The tree it was built into was old and sturdy. A large statuary willow that always reminded the twins of the Whomping Willow on the Hogwarts grounds. Only this one was larger, older, and didn't normally try to kill people. Its branches draped thick curtains of leaves that hid the inside of the treehouse from view at nearly every angle. </p><p>      The treehouse itself was simple. Just a boxy room up high in the tree branches about the size of a roomy broom closet. But the twins loved it! It was the perfect place to go when they needed to be away from people. It had clearly been constructed much later than the house whose grounds it was part of. The wood was still light and yellow, none of the boards sank an inch when stepped on, and it was relatively free of spiders and splinters.</p><p>     Fred and George had found it by accident the summer before their first year at Hogwarts. They never came to the village in the winter, when the leaves had fallen, the ladder was frosted over, and the treehouse was visible, but they were down in it constantly throughout the summers when the branches and leaves from the Willow tree hid it almost completely. The twins had been in the backyard looking for a way inside the house itself when George had spotted it while taking a quick leak. They'd fallen in love instantly, and wanting to keep it all to themselves had convinced Bill to place a Muggle-Repelling charm on it before he moved out of The Burrow for his job. </p><p>     The twins hopped the old rickety fence encircling the yard with ease and made their way to the side of the trunk with the least branches, where short wooden boards were drilled up the side to form a ladder. They stepped over a fallen branch, ascending the ladder quickly, and took a moment to rest and cool off in the shade of the treehouse interior. </p><p>    Their silence and rest didn't last long. </p><p>   "So. . . You ready to tell me why we forfeited a perfectly good day of nothing at all to come here?" </p><p>     <em>Do I even still want to tell him?</em> George wondered suddenly. He'd been eager to get it off his chest all day, but now that the time to divulge had finally come he found himself double-thinking things. <em>It's not the kind of thing brothers talk about. Boys, sure, but not brothers.</em> But his curiosity was killing him, and he had to tell <em>someone!</em> And it wasn't as though he could put this in a letter to Lee Jordan or Oliver Wood. <em>I'm just gonna dive right in!</em></p><p>    "Right, so this morning, when you woke me up, I was having a dream. . . . An, erm, <em>naughty</em> one."</p><p>    "I know," Fred said simply and without judgment. </p><p>    "Y-you do?!" George nearly choked</p><p>    Fred nodded. "Of course. You were moaning in your sleep, and in the summer you sleep on top of the covers, cuz you get hot. I could see your boner, mate." </p><p>     Despite the fact that George knew he should feel embarrassed, he felt relieved. Fred was speaking so openly, his voice so free of any judgment, that it felt relieving and vindicating to George. Fred didn't care, clearly, but also appeared to understand. </p><p>     "Well, I wanted to talk about it."</p><p>   "About the dream?" Fred asked, eyes not leaving his twin's for a single second. As their eye contact persisted George felt a strange weightlessness in his chest, along with the sudden desire to touch his twin. <em>Anywhere, everywhere, I don't care...</em></p><p>   He blinked, breaking eye contact, and coughed. "Yeah. Er, well, no. Not exactly. Not about the dream itself, but everything that came with it." </p><p>    "Did you?" Fred grinned. "Come with it, that is." </p><p>    George shook his head. "I think I almost did. But you woke me up too soon."</p><p>    Fred clicked his tongue. "Ahh, I'm sorry, Georgie. Next time I'll watch and let you finish first~"</p><p>    George's face flushed, and he tried to stammer ahead, feeling flustered, "Th-thanks, but I'm s-still curious. . . Does this happen to you?"  </p><p>    Fred shrugged. "It has once or twice. Only recently, though. I'm not sure if it's taken me all the way to... you know. I sleep through it."</p><p>   More relief passed through George. <em>It's not just me!</em> He'd known it wouldn't be, that Fred would be going through it all, too, but hearing him say it out loud eased his worries nonetheless. </p><p>    "Have you started growing hair down below, too?" Fred asked curiously. "Mine just started coming in."</p><p>    George nodded. "Yeah! I only noticed this morning. Just a little bit, not much. Can. . . Can I see yours? To compare?" </p><p>     They both blushed deeply. George wasn't sure why he'd asked. It had just slipped out. His gut churned with fresh arousal, and Fred blinked, considering. </p><p>   "Err, yeah, sure. I don't see why not. We are twins, after all. But you've gotta show me, too. Okay?"</p><p>    George nodded with numb eagerness, standing up with his back to the treehouse entrance. For some reason he could feel himself start to go stiff again. "Alright! Erm, so who goes first? Or should we-"</p><p>   "Together?" Fred asked, standing as well and already reaching to his zipper. George nodded. </p><p>    "Together."</p><p>      They both began to unbutton and unzip themselves at the same time, breathing intermittent shallow and deep nervous breaths. They kept their shoes on and dropped their pants around their ankles. The twins were wearing the same pair of slightly bulging underwear- plaid stripped boxer briefs. </p><p>    "I'm not sure. . . Is it a bad thing that we're both getting turned on by seeing each other naked?" George gestured unnecessarily to their slowly rising tents, a seed of anxiety beginning to grow in his mind. For now, it was overshadowed by other feelings of curiosity and arousal. For now. Fred shrugged. </p><p>    "It's happening to both of us. I think it's just hormones from puberty. We're not turned on because we're brothers I think, but because we're about to look at each other's privates. There's kind of a thrill to it. It'd happen with anyone. Does that make sense?"</p><p>     George nodded, but at Fred's words he felt a fire ignite inside him, making him go stiffer. The wrongness of what they were doing became apparent, and it brought with it a fresh wave of horniness, if also fueling the sliver of anxiety. He actually <em>did</em> find it hot that they were brothers about to get naked together! He kept that part to himself. </p><p>     "Well. . . Are you ready?" George asked, hoping his eagerness wasn't evident in his voice. Fred nodded, licking his lips. </p><p>   "Yeah, but we should take each other's underwear off." </p><p>   George blinked. The word "al-alright" escaped his lips before he could hold his urges in check. He blushed as his twin shuffled close to him. Fred grabbed his brother's wrists gently, pulling his hands to his hips. </p><p>    "Hey, it'll be fine. No one will see us. I promise."</p><p>   "Unless the Muggle-Repelling charm wore off. After all, it is a couple years old, now," George chuckled sardonically, but he let Fred guide his hands anyway. Fred reached across and placed his hands on George's hips in turn. </p><p>   They spent a moment admiring each other, feeling hot and smooth, sweaty skin just above waistbands, eyeing the indented curves of hipbones, and mostly gazing breathlessly as their tents grew to full size, a good five inches. Perhaps even a bit larger, though only just. </p><p>    They both intended to move first, and ironically ended up sliding their fingers beneath each other's waistbands and pushing their underwear down at the same time. Fingertips slid against thighs. In the second before their cocks sprung free the bubble of tension inside George swelled to its maximum size, popped, and dissipated. Sweet relief filled his lungs, and he let out a quick chuckle as his and his brother's underpants were pushed down to just above their knees. </p><p>     Their teenage members touched the bare summer air inside the treehouse, heads directly across from each other. They were completely identical. They even had the same cute freckle just above the base of the shafts on the left side of their stomachs. George was too curious and turned on to notice that Fred's freckle was mirrored across from his, also on George's left. The only visual difference between their packages was that George's foreskin was already peeled back a bit and showed off more of his cockhead than his brother.</p><p>     They were both fully, solidly hard. Pre had even begun to drip, though more for Fred. George noticed and something inside him gave a curious, aroused purr. He'd never seen precum before. George's eyes drifted to look at the few sprigs of red hair that were growing around his brother's cock. </p><p>    "Blimey, would you look at that?" Fred reached forward hesitantly with his right hand, pausing with his fingertips millimeters from George's shaft. When George made no move to stop him, he wrapped the hand softly around his twin's cock. A pleasureable shudder passed through George's body. Somehow, just simply being touched there by someone who wasn't him felt better than anything he'd ever experienced.  <em>not just 'someone,' my brother.</em> He felt an urge to close his eyes and thrust slowly into Fred's hand. His eyelids fluttered, but he fought off the rest of the powerful desire. </p><p>    And as it turned out, he didn't need to succumb to the urge. Fred took another step forward (an impressive feat with jeans pushed down around his ankles) and started stroking George off slowly, eyes wide with wonder as he watched George's foreskin slide up and down his head, pushing more and more pre out of his slit. </p><p>    "Aahhh~ oh, M-Merlin, Fred!" George sagged forward and grabbed his brother's shoulders for support, eyes widening before squeezing tightly shut. </p><p>     "That feels good, doesn't it?" The question was posed as just that- a question. No sexual subtext or purring dominance, just curiosity. George nodded stiffly, teeth clenched firmly together. </p><p>    "You- you've gotta feel this, F-Fred. It's amazing! You... You're amazing!"</p><p>    Fred suddenly straightened up, releasing his hold on his twin's penis. "Aha!" </p><p>    George blinked, confused and disappointed. "H-hey! Why'd you stop? That felt so good!" He looked up. Fred was standing straight, dick pointing right at his twin, arms crossed and a soft smirk lighting his face. </p><p>   "So you <em>are</em> turned on by me!" He sounded more victorious than accusatory. </p><p>    "Wha- what are you on about? You're the one who said we weren't. This is just hormones, come on!"</p><p>    "No... This is something else. You like me touching you."</p><p>     Anger flared inside George. <em>Was this all a setup?! He just wanted to have something to lord over me?</em> He grabbed for his shorts &amp; underwear and straightened up, jerking the clothes back over himself. "Takes one to know one," he snarled, trying to hide his sheer embarrassment behind anger. His zipper flew back up and his button was quickly secured. George took a step back towards the treehouse entrance, beginning to turn away. </p><p>    "Wait!"</p><p>     Fred's expression shifted to worry, and he crouched down while stumbling forward, one hand stretched out to his twin, the other trying to pull up his own clothes. He half succeeded in pulling up his pants, and they came to rest just beneath his junk. </p><p>     "You're right!" </p><p>     George paused right at the lip of the entrance and turned to look questioningly at Fred, both their faces flushed and pink. "I'm right?"</p><p>    "That it, erm, it takes one to know one." Fred stepped forward, pulling his jeans the rest of the way up and fastening the button. "I. . . I like you, Georgie. Like, a lot. I always have. How can I not? We're closer to each other than to anyone else. But a few months ago my feelings changed. I wanted more from you. I wanted this, what we were just doing." His eyes were wide, trying to convey his emotions. </p><p>   But George was having trouble processing. "Wh-what? I don't understand. Earlier you said-"</p><p>   "I was just trying to cover up my own feelings because I wasn't sure what your feelings were. We share things, yeah, but we always have. You showing me your cock didn't necessarily mean you were into me, just that you were curious and needed validation. So I dug and tried to find out your feelings for me by sating your curiosity, giving you that validation. When it became apparent that you liked me too, I got kinda cocky. I'm sorry, George."</p><p>    George looked away, the seed of anxiety returning, this time developing much quicker than before. "Are. . . Are you saying that we like each other?" </p><p>    Fred nodded. "Unless I misread things, yeah, I am." </p><p>    "You didn't! Honestly, I didn't realize how I felt until you started touching me. The only problem is..."</p><p>   "We're brother's," Fred finished, with a sigh. "I know. That could potentially complicate things." </p><p>    "Fuck, you think?!" George's heart started beating faster. "I- I can't be in love with my brother! People will hate me!" His breath started coming out in short, quick bursts. Fred reached a consoling hand towards his brother's shoulder, but George knocked it away. His eyes were wide and fearful. No, terrified. </p><p>    "It's. . . It's wrong, isn't it? Not just cuz we're related, but we're guys! Both of us! I can't… c-c-can't…" fearful tears appeared in the corners of his eyes. </p><p>   Fred opened his mouth for a second with a look of sympathy. Then his face set and hardened, and he shuffled purposefully closer, bridging what little gap remained between them. He looked George defiantly in the eye and grabbed his face, his touch gentle but firm. </p><p>   "Don't talk like that! There is nothing wrong with you, or us. <em>Especially</em> not with being gay. It's a natural thing, idiots just get scared of it. But we can keep it a secret, ay? It'll be just for us. I… I love you, George." Fred's voice, which he'd been trying to keep strong, broke a little. </p><p>    George felt surprisingly calmed and reassured by his brother's words. The feel of his fingers against his face soothed his wired nerves. </p><p>    Until Fred leaned forward, pressing his lips against his brother's. George didn't even give himself time to feel the kiss. His anxiety spiked, and he stumbled backward away from his twin, not truly wanting him to stop, but simply afraid of what else this intimate contact would stir inside him.</p><p>    Except there was nowhere behind him to step! He was already at the entrance of the treehouse, nearly 30 feet up in the willow tree. His foot met only air and George found himself caught off balance. Gravity took hold of him an did the rest. Before he tipped backwards George saw Fred lurch forward, reaching out to try and grab him, a look of horror on his face. </p><p>    "Shit!" Fred cried as his hand closed around air where George's arm had just been, a second too late. And then George was falling. </p><p>    His head swam with fear. He didn't even take in the fall itself. He tried to scream, might even have succeeded, but he couldn't hear anything. Blood was pounding in his ears. </p><p>     And then, after what felt like no time at all, he hit the ground. The impact knocked the wind so completely out of him that George felt as if his lungs were collapsing in on themselves. But that was small compared to the rest. Because something <em>pierced</em> through him on impact, driving through his back and out his chest right where his heart should be. George felt the pressure of it, but not the pain that he knew should be there. He heard Fred let out a shriek of terror, a long wail that was full of emotion but stripped of humanity. His chest began to feel hot and wet. </p><p>    And then everything went black.</p>
