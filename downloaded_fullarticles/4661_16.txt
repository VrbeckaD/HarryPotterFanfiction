    <p>
  <span>Severus Snape-Prince, Rabastan, Rodolphus and Bellatrix Lestrange walked calmly to Privet Drive. Thank Merlin Severus knew Petunia and how to find her. But what he was going to do now was a completely idiotic thing, but he had to ― at least that’s what he told himself.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The past few months all of them had to deal with the trials being held at the Ministry. Their Lord ordered that, if something would happen, they were supposed to deny any involvement with him and maintain a high status and power in the society. It was bad, but not impossible.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Severus knocked the door to Number 4 one time, then one more until a horse-like woman opened and widened her eyes at seeing him and the ones behind him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You- you freak! And you three… What are you doing here? We’re already taking care of him!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Severus sighed. Petunia would always be the same.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The Lestranges just smirked evilly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, no, filthy muggle. It’s our duty to take care of him,” said Bellatrix. Mrs Dursley looked affronted, but finally nodded and let them enter the door. “So where is he?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“In the cupboard.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The Death Eaters widened their eyes, but then recomposed themselves and opened the door of the cupboard, seeing a small, old and poor crib where a small baby with bad and smelly pants rested. The boy had big and loving green eyes and a small nest of raven hair. He also had a scar on the side of his hip, probably a burn. He was adorable, but needed a change, food and someone to treat the burn.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The Potions Master sharpened his jaw at seeing a baby, Lily’s little boy, treated like that.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We’ll take him,” said Rodolphus, who otherwise was silent until seeing the baby.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And got the baby in his arms and disappeared.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Bellatrix, Rabastan and Severus followed angrily.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Are you really going to follow our Lord’s orders?” asked Narcissa while staring at her sister holding an infant in her arms.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Of course! They’re our Lord’s demands.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I know that. It’s just… are you ready to raise a child? They’re a big responsibility and yo’'ll have to take care of him for decades. He’s a halfblood as well."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes, indeed he is. But I can’t have my own child, Cissy, and our Lord ordered. We have already decided what to do: we’re going to realize a blood adoption so he’ll be officially my son and will follow our Lord when the time comes. My pride.” Bellatrix nuzzled the baby’s face who yelped happily.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Narcissa just nodded. She herself had problems conceiving Draco and even more during the pregnancy, therefore she knew how it was to crave for a baby of her own and this boy… he was admittedly cute. And she would have a nephew to fusse... The Malfoy matriarch smiled and reached to stroke the b- her nephew’s cheek.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Here we stand, Inner Circle,” said Lucius. They were all gathered in Lestrange Manor, waiting for the ritual. “Our Lord gave us orders before he disappeared. Besides maintaining status in society as we await his return, he ordered the Lestranges to take care of the boy who is now known as our Lord”s downfall.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We’re His most loyal followers,” continued Rodolphus with his deep voice. “And so we obeyed Him. This magical child, Harry James Potter, was abused by worthless muggles.” Several gasps were heard. “We saved him from an abused environment and decided to take care of him as our own son. Which he will be at the end of the night.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Everyone cheered. The Lestranges were indeed the Dark Lord’s most faithful servants and they believed them, because during the trials they were one of their major help.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The ritual of blood adoption was actually pretty simple, but was deeply intertwined with the godparent ritual. It was like that because the child needed to have another adult to help in the transition to the new parents. The question was: who would be the new Lestrange’s godparent? Probably the Malfoys, almost everyone thought.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Severus Tobias Snape-Prince, please stand.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The Prince Lord did as ordered with hidden surprise. He looked at Lily’s boy in the basket beside Bellatrix and Rabastan.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Would you, Lord Prince, in your sincere wish to help, guide and love our future son, accept to be his godfather?” asked Rodolphus.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I will certainly do everything in my power to help, guide and love your son, Lord and Lady Lestrange. I’ll be his godfather until Mother Magic deems me worthy.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Because of his affirmation the room glowed, saying that yes, Severus Snape Prince was indeed the rightfully godfather of the child. Severus then holded the baby in his arms, who immediately looked at him with his big adoring bright Avada Kedavra eyes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Now may the blood adoption ritual begin,” said Lucius.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Severus put his godson in a small and golden table where the Lestrange crest was carved within and then gave to Bellatrix and Rodolphus a small knife. The couple looked at each other for an instant and then smiled in an almost insane way. They both cut the palm of their hands and then waited for Severus to hold a small potion vial under their now linked hands.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Their united blood dropped to the potion vial for some time until Severus deemed it enough. He then lightly shook the vial until he nodded.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rodolphus and Bellatrix went to each side of their almost son while Severus opened the small mouth and poured the potion inside. The baby shook his little body and almost shouted, until he stopped and the changes began.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The once pale skin became tanned like Rodolphus and Rabastan’s, the famous Potter hair became curly. Avada Kedavra bright green eyes now had spikes of grey and the baby face became more aristocratic but still quite soft.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Everyone gasped, and then…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Harry Potter exists no more, but today is the day that Hadrian Severus Lestrange was born!”</span>
