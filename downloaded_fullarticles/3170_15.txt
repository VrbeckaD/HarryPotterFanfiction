  <em>Ginevra Weasley, Draco Malfoy, Severus Snape, Hermione Granger</em>
</p><p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">The four names inked on the parchment burned through his mind. Four names, four choices.</p><p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">He had seen the announcement in the paper of course. It was hard to miss, with it blaring across the front page.</p><p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“<em>Ministry of Magic Passes Decree to Rebuild our World</em>.”</p><p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">The decree required all unwed adults of noble families to wed within the next year, and produce an heir within two. A minimum of three further children were required within twenty years of marriage with a generous offer for fertility assessments and treatments. Such action should effectively double the number of wizarding children within a single generation. Potentially more than double, as it was not uncommon for the upper nobility to have only one child.</p><p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Four names. Four people he could choose from to marry, or the Ministry would seize his assets, have him obliviated, and dump him in the Muggle world. They had kindly selected a range of ages, genders, and blood purities for his purview. And reading between the lines of the declaration he had received; apparently all capable of preventing him from turning into the next Dark Lord.</p><p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Are you pondering what I’m pondering, Luna?”</p><p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Well I think so, Harry, but why does the chicken cross the road, if not for love?”</p><p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Harry smiled at her bemusedly. “Quite right, Luna love.” His expression turned serious as he studied the parchment.</p><p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">He wondered how the Ministry had come up with those particular names. Two purebloods, two witches, two ‘light’, two pardoned ex-deatheaters. All of them known to him. All of them prepared to do their duty for Wizardkind, by marrying the wealthiest, most eligible Wizard in Great Britain.</p><p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">And all of them owed him a life debt. It was a peculiar coincidence, as he doubted the events surrounding any of the debts had ever been reported to the authorities. Dumbledore had certainly never reported the incident with the troll in his first year to the MLE, where Harry’s decision to find Hermione on Halloween had saved her life. She had owed no debt to Ronald Weasley for that particular event, as his actions had caused her to be in danger in the first place. You could not accrue a life debt from saving someone from a situation you placed them in.</p><p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Ginny of course he had saved during his second year, when he stopped the almost resurrected Tom Riddle Jr from draining her life force. He hadn’t even gotten an acknowledgement from the Weasleys over that one, they seemed to take for granted that he had only done what any good Gryffindor hero would do and required no thanks. But really, what could one expect from people who had no problem with a child being starved and imprisoned in a barred room all summer? Once again, Dumbledore had made no mention of the event to parties outside the school. The Ministry would not have been happy to learn that there had been a basilisk or a rejuvenated Dark Lord underneath the school.</p><p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Draco Malfoy would have died in the fiendfyre cast by Gregory Goyle if Harry hadn’t turned his broom around and literally swooped in to save him. The elemental fire <em>had</em> consumed it’s caster, the flames displeased that an inferior wizard had summoned them and not been able to direct or control them. Harry himself had quite an affinity for fire; the flames had danced across his skin and caressed his magic without burning him. Tendrils of his magic had crept out to spread through the flames, taking ownership of the wild hell fire. The flames had cleared a path for him to reach Malfoy’s side at his command, and he had plucked the blond from the burning Room of Requirements and flown him to safety. As the door to the room had shut behind him, his magic had banished the flames and stopped them from burning down the whole castle.</p><p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">As for Severus Snape, he would have died at Nagini’s fangs if not for Harry’s actions. He hadn’t spoken to Snape since saving his life, didn’t even know if the man had realised that Harry had been the one to save him by pouring his magic into the wound to heal it. He had left the shrieking shack before the man had woken.</p><p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">The ministry was offering him two choices really, forced marriage to a wizard or witch with the barest illusion of choice, or essentially mental death. Without his memories he would hardly be himself anymore.</p><p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“So what are you going to do, Harry?” Luna asked. “They have only given you seven days to inform them of your decision.”</p><p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“The only thing I can do, Luna. Try to take over the world.” Harry levitated the parchment above his hand, and with barely a thought summoned a spark of elemental fire to burn it to ash. As the ashes rained to the ground, he offered Luna his hand. “Come sister of my heart, we have plans to make.”</p><p> </p>
