    <p>She had asked him to wait, so he waited. She’d said that he would find her, she’d promised him that. So there he was, waiting for her. Close enough to The Gate because he knew that she would be there. That way, he would find her.</p><p>He knew when she came, he could feel her. Right at that moment.</p><p>It took him all his might not to run straight to her. In this form it would be easy for him to locate her, but no, it was not the time. That wasn’t how they could be together. No matter how much he longed for her, that’s not how they supposed to meet. She’d vowed that she would be his, but Fate would never allow it in his current form. So he still needed to endure another wait.</p><p>Nine months later, he was born to a couple who lived in a mediaeval manor nearby.</p><p>He was one of High Council so he could retain his memory and some of his Gift once he got a touch of his magic. Though of course Fate wouldn’t go easy on him, he won’t be given that advantage. As he regained his memories, his Gift would fade. He understood that, it was the rule. But it didn’t mean that it’d be easy for him.</p><p>His Sight was clear when he was a toddler, when he didn’t have enough knowledge to process what he’d <em>seen</em> nor to use it. By the time he was old enough to understand, the Vision only came randomly in blur which only confused him instead of giving him information. Not to mention so much knowledge from his memory was clashing with what his <em>parents </em>had taught him.</p><p>
  <em>“You have to know that you’re triply special, Son,” his father told his 2 years old self. “Firstly you’re a wizard, secondly you’re a Pure-blood, and the most important is you’re a Malfoy. Malfoy’s always on top, we don’t bow down to anyone.”</em>
</p><p>But around a year later when he had his first accidental magic, his past memories returned and he <em>knew</em> that every single being had their own part and purpose in life, no soul was above the other. For a young still-developing mind, it could be confusing and quite difficult to handle; to sort out which one was right and which one was wrong. So it wasn’t surprising if it affect his temper.</p><p>Added to that, becoming a human was quite a challenge, they’re full of irony. And even with magic, as a young boy he’s more or less helpless. But the house he was born into was wealthy; a family with power, a power that would be an advantage for him in the future. Because one thing that he knew for certain since the moment he was born; there’s a big part of him that missing, something he needed to find. Something important, a certain someone; <em>her</em>, his reason. So he had to adapt, until he was able to hold that power and stand on his own feet. He had to survive this; for her, to find her. And if it meant that he’d have to follow his father <em>instructions</em>, so be it.</p><p>Surely acting as an entitled and poised Scion of a large estate wouldn’t be a hard work. And presenting himself with dignity or commanding other around him wasn’t really different with his previous life. It should be easy to pass his childhood life. But how wrong he was, human was stupid creature. How could he forget all those reasons that always frustrated him about this creature. Just like he’d predicted long ago, it’d taken only few centuries before human losing sight of their magic. And this time, he had no choice but to get entangled in this mess from young age.</p><p>While he agreed that not every human deserved magic, he didn’t see any reason to treat them like dirt. But he had role to play, and acted he did. But he certainly never wanted to injure anyone, so he didn’t understand why he was attacked just for a few words and he was rather shock when his father went as far as to put the Hippogriff to death. Surely someone could see that it wasn’t alright and prevented it from happening. Even that half-giant must have some capacity as a teacher, right? But no! With that huge body, it repulsed him how he didn’t really do anything besides burying his face in his handkerchief.</p><p>
  <em>“Look at him blubber!”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>He had been standing just inside the castle doors with his two acquaintances, listening.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Have you ever seen anything quite as pathetic?” he said with disdain. “And he’s supposed to be our teacher!”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>He saw from the corner of his eyes that the bespectacled boy and the red head both made furious moves toward him, but he didn’t see her coming and – SMACK!</em>
</p><p>
  <em>She had slapped him across the face with all the strength she could muster. He staggered. Potter, Weasley, Crabbe, and Goyle stood flabbergasted as she raised her hand again.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Don’t you dare call Hagrid pathetic, you foul – you evil –“</em>
</p><p>He didn’t really care on what happened next. It was like a flood gate opened up, memory after memory had cascaded into his head, slammed him so hard he could barely stand. Her smile, her touch, her voice, her <em>promise</em>. It was her.</p><p>It was a lot to take in a short time. He retreated in a hurry, rather than chancing duel with her.</p><p>He knew that this definitely made everything more difficult. Fate really hadn’t made it easy for him.</p><p align="center">---***---</p><p>
  <em> “How I wish I could just ask you to go with me,” he said, gripping her hand tightly.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>She smiled, so radiant almost made him blind. Her eyes still had the spark that captivated him every time she looked up straight to his eyes.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“You know I can’t do that,” she coaxed him. Her voice was soft, more of whisper, but it pierced his heart like a sharp knife. It’s hurt, he closed his eyes, unable to hold her gaze.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“You will always choose them,” he relented bitterly. “Why I even hope, stupid me.” </em>
</p><p>
  <em>He knew that his words would erase her smile and he could hear sadness in her voice, “Hey, you’re being unfair here. You know it’s not like that.”</em>
</p><p><em>Yes, he knew. He knew that it was a futile battle even before he asked. Right from the moment he first saw her, he knew that they couldn’t be together. They had their own duty, </em><strong>she</strong> <em>had her duty; her destiny. She would defy her existence – her purpose – if  she chose him, and she would never do that. But he just needed someone to blame, and it certainly wasn’t Fate. He knew this was the end when he felt her releasing her hands. He would do everything not to do it, but he had to let her go.</em></p><p>
  <em>Then he felt her hands on his cheek, forcing him to open his eyes.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Will you wait for me?” she wishfully asked.”Wait for me, okay. Then you will find me. In time, I’ll be yours, only yours,” she added boldly.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>He forced a smile. “Why, is that an order you just gave me?” he questioned her playfully, tried to make light of their conversation.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“No, it’s a promise.” she said in a firm tone. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>She reached his left hand with her right and he felt wash of warmth through his palm. He looked down to their joined hand and gasped. A thin white thread coming out from her first finger, circling his wrist while forming spiralling loop before end it in a tight intricate knot.</em>
</p><p>
  <em> His eyes returned to hers, understood the implication of her action but still couldn’t believe it. She only lifted their joined hand to her lips, kissing it softly whilst maintaining their gaze. “There. I pledge you my heart,” She presented their joined hand. “I will never be far, so you surely will find me. And in case you manage to find me but you fail to recognise me, I’ll come straight to you and confront you,” Her statement didn’t have any  doubt in it.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Dumbfounded, he could only replied, “You’ll make sure of it?”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Oh, yes,” she confirmed solidly. “And it’ll be something that leave big impact on you,” she vowed, lightly tapped his left cheek, a huge grind on her face.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>There’s a lot of thing he wanted to say, but he was too mesmerised with what she did that he’s losing words. Had nothing to say, he closed the distance between them, pressing his forehead on hers with their hands still clapped together and whispered, “Yes, I’ll wait. Then I will find you.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>He raised his right hand to cup her cheek, his thumb traced the line of her lower lip. They only stood there like that for awhile, relishing the moment. There’s no rush between them to do anything. After all, there’s no guarantee what could happen in the future. They’re already tiptoeing on the edge of their boundary. So much to risk and everything could go wrong, or they would meet and be together on a borrowed time.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>She released a soft sigh when he kissed the tip of her nose, deliberately moved down to the corner of her lip before captured her lower lip and lingered there for a few seconds. Their first kiss. And their last in this lifetime. Their parting kiss. Chaste and short.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Eyes locked on each other, she put her hand on his and leaned her head against it. “I’m all yours.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>And with that, they parted.</em>
