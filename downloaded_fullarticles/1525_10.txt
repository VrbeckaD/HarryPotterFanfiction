<p>
  <span>One wonders when </span><br/>
  <span>That time might have begun,</span><br/>
  <span>The day I looked at </span>
  <em>
    <span>you <br/></span>
  </em>
  <span>And saw</span>
  <em>
    <span> myself</span>
  </em>
  <span> complete.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>One wonders when</span><br/>
  <span>Through all that blood and pain,</span><br/>
  <em>
    <span>Your </span>
  </em>
  <span>eyes met with </span>
  <em>
    <span>mine <br/></span>
  </em>
  <span>And something started to change.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>I wonder when </span><br/>
  <span>I started to know, </span><br/>
  <span>Love comes in all forms <br/></span>
  <span>And from so many directions.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>I wonder when </span><br/>
  <span>You became much more to me, </span><br/>
  <span>So different than I thought... <br/></span>
  <span>And I thought: </span>
  <em>
    <span>I could love you.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Could this be true?</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>How I wonder why </span><br/>
  <span>I didn’t see before, </span><br/>
  <span>The sparkle in your eye <br/></span>
  <span>Or the light in your smile. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>How I wonder why</span><br/>
  <span>Every little thing </span>
  <em>
    <span>you </span>
  </em>
  <span>do,</span><br/>
  <span>Fills a light in my heart <br/></span>
  <span>What is this </span>
  <em>
    <span>magic </span>
  </em>
  <span>you do?</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Oh, I wonder why </span><br/>
  <span>It took so long for me,</span><br/>
  <span>So much pain and loss<br/></span>
  <span>Just for one chance to </span>
  <em>
    <span>breathe</span>
  </em>
  <span>.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>But then again </span><br/>
  <span>I was so blind before, </span><br/>
  <span>Now I have time for breath <br/></span>
  <span>Yet my head spins again...</span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Because I love seeing you. </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Again and again each day</span><br/>
  <span>Your gaze captures my soul... <br/></span>
  <em>
    <span>I love you.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Truly, I love you.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>One wonders when</span><br/>
  <span>Everything I knew was flipped, </span><br/>
  <span>You were beside me each day <br/></span>
  <span>But </span>
  <em>
    <span>your </span>
  </em>
  <span>laugh dazzled </span>
  <em>
    <span>my </span>
  </em>
  <span>senses </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>One wonders when </span><br/>
  <span>Life became a joy,</span><br/>
  <span>It was in that moment then<br/></span>
  <span>But did my heart know it?</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>I wonder when </span><br/>
  <span>I knew I’d marry you,</span><br/>
  <span>So nervous I was<br/></span>
  <span>But again you calmed me.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>I wonder when </span><br/>
  <span>Everyday became a </span>
  <em></em>
    <span>breeze<br/></span>
  
  <span>With bright, sunny days...<br/></span>
  <span>But again I thought: </span>
  <em></em>
  <span>I love you.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>I know it to be true. </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>How I wonder why</span><br/>
  <span>You would say yes to me?</span><br/>
  <span>When compared to you, <br/></span>
  <span>I’m simply nothing at all.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>How I wonder why </span><br/>
  <span>I’ve been given this chance, </span><br/>
  <span>To love someone like you <br/></span>
  <span>Please tell me </span>
  <em>
    <span>what </span>
  </em>
  <span>I should do.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Oh, I wonder why </span><br/>
  <span>I’m not scared, not at all,</span><br/>
  <span>But wait one moment now<br/></span>
  <span>Just once more, a chance to breathe</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>And then again</span><br/>
  <span>The time is soon, I know, </span><br/>
  <span>Not a second to wait<br/></span>
  <span>For the day is here...</span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Oh, I love seeing you.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>And when we say ‘I do’ </span><br/>
  <span>Your lips will meet mine...<br/></span>
  <em>
    <span>I love you</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Truly, I love you.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Just Let </span>
  <span></span>
    <br/>
  
  <span>Every Moment Be </span><br/>
  <span>Like These Last Few Years </span>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <em>
    <span>With You… </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
