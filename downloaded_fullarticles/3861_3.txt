    <p>
  <span>It had a been a long day out on mutually beneficial family business; both second sons, they were forever out on these tedious errands. And so, Gerald and Lycoris decided to reward themselves with a trip to their favorite gentleman’s club, Le Chat Noir. Their waitress had Gerald’s attention before she even approached their table. A blonde haired, blue-eyed beauty she held herself with grace, and he couldn’t help but think it a pity that she was relegated to this kind of work.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>For Cassandra it was simply another ordinary Wednesday afternoon, waiting on regulars, flirting and laughing with them when her head began to pound (like it so frequently did these days) and she stumbled, spilling whiskey and liquor all over Lycoris.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’m so sorry” she mumbled, frowning and wandlessly drying the damp trouser leg. He waved her apology off, not paying her clumsiness any heed, until Gerald’s eyes grew wide and he turned to see that their waitress was gazing at them. She had gone completely still, her eyes were blank, and she began to speak in a haunting monotone. </span>

</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>When she finished speaking she blinked at them, face devoid of emotion. But, of course, she wouldn’t have remembered what she’d just said. A Seer never remembered giving a true prophecy. Lycoris’ nails dug into the leather of his chair at her words, even as Gerald had the sense to jump up and catch the girl before she collapsed, ushering her into a seat and sharing a look with his companion.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Merlin” he whispered, “the others must be told.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Lycoris nodded and drained his firewhiskey, “they’re not going to like this.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Gerald snorted, no, they were not going to like it at all, but they’d heard her and they’d understood. The fate of their world rested on the words that had just left this pretty witch’s lips.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Thank you, Cassandra, it’s been a wonderful evening, but I’m afraid that my friend and I need to be getting home.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>They left her a substantial tip and a fervent wish that she would never give another prophecy, for her voice was sure to haunt them for the remainder of their lives.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Cassandra never saw them again. But they never forgot her, and when they heard about the famed Seer, Cassandra Trelawney, any doubts they’d harbored were erased.  </span>
