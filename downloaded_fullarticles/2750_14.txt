    <p>Harry slowly packed his clothes into his trunk. It would have been easier and faster to use magic, and even though he had determined to go through with his decision, somewhere deep down he hoped that everything would work out in the end.</p>
<p>Was it wrong to hope? He didn’t think so.</p>
<p>Harry was no quitter, but even he could see that leaving was the best option for both him and Tom.</p>
<p>They were no longer close like they used to be.</p>
<p>When he finally and reluctantly finished packing, Harry cast a quick tempus to see that it was almost time for Tom to come home from work at the Ministry. As much as Harry wanted to see Tom one last time in their - <em>Tom’s</em> - home, he knew it would be for the best to leave now.</p>
<p>Harry shrunk his trunk and other bags and placed them into his pockets then gave one last bittersweet gaze to the bedroom they had shared. </p>
<p>Harry contemplated when their relationship had gone south.</p>
<p>Maybe they had been doomed from the start. He and Tom had always had different opinions on all sorts of matters. And lately, Tom had been hanging out with those stuffy Purebloods like Malfoy almost every night and not coming home until late in the night or early morning. Sometimes leaving for a few days at a time.</p>
<p>And recently, Harry suspected that Tom was sleeping with someone else. There were little clues that gave away unfaithfulness and Harry would have confronted Tom about it…. but something kept him from opening his mouth. He didn’t want to know the truth, even though he knew he should.</p>
<p>It broke his heart to know that the one he loved no longer loved him back.</p>
<p>But harry couldn’t hold Tom back from his goals.</p>
<p>Harry gazed down at the Gaunt Ring that Tom had given him the day he had proposed. They had been happily engaged for a year before Tom’s ambitions and goals took priority.</p>
<p>He gave it a light kiss before sliding it off his ring finger and placing it on the small dresser on Tom’s side. He didn’t bother leaving a note, he doubted Tom would even care at all.</p>
<p>Leaving the Manor he and Tom had lived in for quite some time was hard. He practically had to force himself to continue out the front door and outside the wards to apparate.</p>
<p>Giving into his impulse, Harry took in all the features of the Manor as he steeled himself.</p>
<p>With a crack, he was gone.  </p>
