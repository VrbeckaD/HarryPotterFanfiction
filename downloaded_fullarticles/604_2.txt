          <div class="userstuff"><p>Draco woke up, groaning and groggy. The sunlight poured through his windows, as he stood up in a bitter manner and closed the curtains roughly. Still groaning. He really didn't want to get up today. Not just today, because everyday he still didnt want to get up. But it's fine, today is his last day before the weekends. And, the Yule Ball. </p><p>He sighed to himself, going to the bathroom, he looked at himself at the mirror before grimacing at the sight of his own reflection. Disgusting. So this was the boy who was such a heart-throb to everyone at school? This was the boy who was considered perfect? It was just a mere lie. He hated himself. He splashed his face with water once more, washing off the dried tears from yesterday's crying. He cried himself to sleep that night.</p><p>On that thought, he remembered about last night's events. He pulled up his sleeve, revealing the disgusting wounds. He touched one gently and winced at the touch, it hurt. He blew some wind on it carefully, and pulled his sleeve back down, not wanting to see it anymore.</p><p>He finally undressed after exiting the bathroom, being finished with his daily self- loathing. Well, atleast a portion of his daily self-loathing.</p><p>He stared at his naked body in the mirror. Ugh. He was hideous. An absolute monster.<br/>
Wounds and scars surrounded and covered his body, he was incredibly under weight, his ribs were showing just a tad and his arms were thin, almost identical to a stick but not quite. His eyes had eyebags underneath and his hair was a dirty mess. He sees it now, this is why father hates him.</p><p>He couldnt stand the sight anymore and dressed quickly, doing a sloppy job on his tie. His robe was put barely, as one side was below his shoulder, and his belt was tied in a lazy manner, and not to mention his poorly done collar.</p><p>He fixed himself up, barely though. His tie was still sloppy, but slightly better, and his belt was still like before.</p><p>He ran a hand throwing his hair, messing with it slightly to fix it up a bit. He moved it to the right like always, and stepped out after thinking he was ready.</p><p>He walked slowly as ever, wanting to stall as much time as possible. </p><p>Finally he reached the Great Hall. He stood there, staring at the big doors infront of him. Anxiety started building up inside of him, he was trembling. He wished the doors didn't make such a loud sound when he entered. He wished he wasn't so popular.</p><p>He wished he wasn't a Malfoy.</p><p>Draco rested his hands on the door. Paranoid as ever, he pushed it carefully, trying not to make such a loud sound. But of course, to open it you needed force. So force he used, and oh Merlin did everyone stare at his downgraded features.</p><p>He walked towards the slytherin's table, his head down and posture crooked. All eyes were still fixated on him, until he sat down and the chatter slowly but surely resumed. He didnt know what the others were thinking at the time, what if they were thinking that he was so utterly disgusting? Or that he was gross and weird? Or just overall malicious thoughts about him?</p><p>Whatever it was, it was probably true.</p><p>He was sitting opposite of Pansy and Blaise, who just looked at him like they had been slapped.</p><p>"... Draco?" Pansy asked quietly, breaking the silence, she shook her head lightly and broke her trance. </p><p>"Draco.. you-"</p><p>"I know, I look like a mess. But before you say anything, I dont care. I'm just especially tired today. And it wont happen again tomorrow- I promise." Draco put his head down, staring at the food laid infront of him that Pansy and Blaise pre-ordered.</p><p>"No no noâ€” Draco it's fine! We were just a tad bit suprised you weren't wearing that smug smile like usual! You dont have to promise anything to us." Blaise finally spoke.</p><p>Draco just nodded, to that the both smiled, they were relieved that their beloved friend was fine. It was just a little tiredness, .. right?</p><p>**</p><p>What? Harry stared at the boy until he sat down. He didnt even smile. His posture was different than regular. </p><p>Harry glanced at every one of his features, there was so much that was new to him, so much that changed about him, and only overnight.</p><p>Why was he suddenly all like this? And why was he worrying? He was never the type to worry over anyone but his friends, especially Malfoy of all people. But he couldnt help but feel this strange new feeling towards him.</p><p>He just stared at the back of his neck, a few red scratches could be seen because of his collar being badly worn. </p><p>He stared for a few minutes, watching the blond not move, and when he actually did, it startled him a bit when his head moved to drink from his mug.</p><p>It made Harry laugh a bit quietly, that fact that he got suprised over a small thing.</p><p>"Harry!? You think it's funny that Lavender Brown dumped me!?" Ron suddenly said looking offended, "He wasn't even listening, Ron." Hermione corrected.</p><p>"What-!? That makes me even more mad!"</p><p>"Sorry.." Harry chuckled and gave a sheepish smile. Ron just rolled his eyes and continued with his 'break-up' story. Harry looked back at Draco.</p><p>He was gone.</p><p>Harry pouted a bit, yet he didnt know why. He hated him, he'd be happy he was gone.<br/>
Either way, the trio had to leave soon as well anyways.</p><p>**</p><p>Harry rushed over to the Common Room, wanting to get a good night's sleep because tomorrow was the Yule Ball. The Yuleball! Recently, he had asked Cho, to go with him as a date, and Cho agreed.</p><p>He was absolutely ecstatic and couldn't wait for tomorrow any longer. Once in the common room, he went straight to his room, shouting excitedly some Hi's and Hello's to his friends then just leaving right after to go to his room and probably daydream, or, perhaps nightdream would be better since it was the evening?</p><p>"Whats that about?" Neville queried. "He asked Cho out. She said yes." Ron answered with a grin and took a seat beside Neville.</p><p>"Ooh~" Neville smirked, then the rest continued chattering and laughing while Harry was in his room, night-dreaming about his date and tomorrow.</p><p>Everything was going to be perfect.</p><p>**</p><p>Draco laid down on his bed. Thinking to himself about the boy he had a crush on. What did he think of him during his entrance at the Great Hall? He asked himself. Once again anxiety continued to pile up as he asked himself about what people thought about him.</p><p>He scratched his neck, wincing a bit because of the scratch marks left there.</p><p>'Tomorrow.'</p><p>He thought. He just reminded himself he didn't have anyone as a date and he was alone. Should he even come then?</p><p>He didn't really have a choice, Pansy and Blaise would barge in his room, demanding he join them either way. Why not save himself some trouble and go.</p><p>Atleast he'd get to see Potter happy.</p><p>Oh, how much Draco envied the boy. He was always smiling, or atleast mostly. He just wished he had a better life, he guessed.</p><p>He reminded himself once more about his mistakes, he could've been friends with him if it wasnt for his selfish attitude back then. He just hoped he could turn back time and redo his first impression on Potter. </p><p>But if only.</p><p>**</p><p>Harry danced with Cho, she smiled a beautiful smile as Harry blushed, his hands on her waist, and her hands on his shoulder.</p><p>"Thank you for asking me out, Harry." she spoke.</p><p>The words made Harry's heart flutter, his whole body filled with euphoria at the very moment. His smile grew wider.</p><p>"Y-You're welcome." he stuttered nervously, his cheeks flushing a cute shade of light pink.</p><p>For the majority of the night, it was filled with hapiness and joy. Harry chatted with his friends and Cho danced with him. Over all, it was a splendid night for Harry Potter.</p><p>But what about Draco? What was he doing?</p><p>***</p><p>Draco watched as the boy he loved danced with someone else. It was supposed to be his. But he knew he didn't deserve it anyways.</p><p>He walked out of the ballroom where everyone was happy. Even Pansy and Blaise had partners to dance with, all except Malfoy.</p><p>He made his way outside of the castle, and behind where there was a small cover below that covered the snow from falling onto the side walk.</p><p>He sat down on the sidewalk and took out his journal where he wrote everything that happened for everyday. </p><p>He stared at some of the notes as he flipped through the pages, when he had a bad day his handwriting was slightly worse, and some pages were very dry because of the crying he did.</p><p>He took out his quill and ink and laid them on the floor and started writing.</p><p>'So far, its terrible. All my friends have partners and yet I'm alone, sitting pathetically on the ground-'</p><p>and he continued on.</p><p>Eventually he started singing 'La Vie En Rose' out of boredom, humming and singing sadly to himself. </p><p>The feeling of isolation had never felt so tranquil.</p><p>Harry's Third person P.O.V</p><p>Cho had to leave early because of reasons, and Harry was left alone while his friends continued to dance with their partners. </p><p>Out of the blue, Harry started searching the bustling crowd for Draco, his supposed rival.</p><p>When he couldn't find him, he of course wouldn't ask Draco's friends, they were practically enemies, not rivals, but enemies.</p><p>Eventually, he exited the room of music, in search of Draco.</p><p>After a whole 10 minutes of going around the castle, he went behind to rest, and was suprised to hear a stunning voice singing some French song beautifully.</p><p>He peeped to the side, and there he was. Draco Malfoy. The boy he was searching for, yet he didn't know for what reason.</p><p>Harry took a closer look, he was writing something in some book.</p><p>Suddenly, Draco abruptly stood up, "Is someone there!?" He looked to the side to see none other than his own crush. Peeping at him.</p><p>"P-potter!?" He jumped in suprise and blushed a light pink, clutching the book near his chest in a protective manner. "What are you doing here!?" </p><p>Harry scratched the back of his head and stepped away from his 'hiding' spot to reveal his full body. "Well- I was looking for you actually." He sheepishly said.</p><p>"But why? Aren't you with that new girl? Chang or whatever her last name was?" He said, looking away when he mentioned the girl who Harry had a 'crush' on.</p><p>"Oh, yeah, well, she had to leave early." Harry walked nearer to Draco, who in return took a step back and turned to face the snow and stopped holding the book to his chest and instead just held it normally near his waist and thigh.</p><p>"So~ Wat'cha got there?" Harry attempted to peek into the diary, Draco pulled the journal farther from him and turned around, blushing again (though Harry couldn't see) when he remembered what he wrote about. "None of your bloody business, Potter! Go back to your friends!"</p><p>"Awh, why the aggression?" Harry tilted his head to the side making a pouty face, asking the question in a childish tone. "Were rivals! Duh!" He held the book close to his chest once again.</p><p>"I mean yeah but- oh whatever- why are you here anyways? And, turn around and face me!" Draco turned around, shaking off the blush and opening his eyes, revealing cold-gray eyes.</p><p>'Wow. He's hot. I mean what-' Harry thought, his face tinting a bit of a red, "I'm here because I dont have a partner. I thought that much would be obvious, Potter."</p><p>"You? Not having a partner? But you're so attractive, though."</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"What, oh, nothing I-" Harry stuttered.</p><p>"Ugh, oh whatever, Potter. You and your nonsense."</p><p>For some reason, Harry's body became a bit hot hearing his name being called by his rival. 'For Merlin's sake Harry, hes a rival, godammit!' Harry just stood there, saying nothing to him, all he could do was stare, he didn't even notice Draco's change in demeanour as he grew uncomfortable by the boy's stares. </p><p>Harry's thoughts were interrupted when Draco cleared his throat, "Uhm- Is there something wrong with my face?" He asked. 'Yes, your face is too hot-' he almost said, but he stopped himself. He grew hotter just by hearing his voice, that same voice that he thought he hated, but apparently now he loves it.</p><p>Harry stood there once more, only staring at the taller boy. He started daydreaming about Draco whispering seductive sayings into his ears, and Harry would oblige and do wonderous things to Malfoy, and the moans he would get out of him, the amazing sounds that he made him do. He imagined himself pushing Draco against a wall, seeing his submissive face and in confusion, and when he'd bend him over and he would hear him beg to him, pleading to go faster-</p><p>And his lips too, Harry's eyes darted to his lips, a pink color â€” and it looks soft too, what if he touched it? Or even better- touched it with his own lips.</p><p>Draco cleared his throat again but louder. "So?" He said, a bit more uncomfortable than last time.</p><p>"O-oh! Right, uhm!" Harry was all over the place, his face still red and his pants a but tight. Draco tilted his head, "Excuse me?" The blind shook his head, "Anyways, I must be going." </p><p>Draco stepped past the shorter boy, his scent was just the last straw to make Harry lose all control.</p><p>Abruptly, Harry abruptly pulled the hand that Malfoy was using to hold his book, the journal was pushed out of his hand and onto the ground. </p><p>He pushed Draco onto the wall and crashed his lips into his, not caring if anyone saw or heard. Meanwhile, Malfoy was frozen in place. 'Holy shit. He. Is. Kissing. Me. WHAT THE FUCK' Not that he was complaining, he was very much ecstatic and so happy, he was just so overwhelmed. At first, he was nervous to kiss back but eventually he melted into the kiss and kissed back.</p><p>Feeling this, Harry was also equally as happy, the brown haired boy slipped his hands below the blond's waist and squeezed Draco's arse, making him release a soft moan, and seeing the opportunity â€” Harry slipped his tongue into the other's mouth, intertwining their tongues and kissing the devil out of him.</p><p>After a few minutes or seconds of this going on, Harry occasionally touching Draco's arse. Harry finally broke the kiss, and by the time he did Draco was left panting and gasping for air, his face a dark shade of red as sweat dripped down his forehead.</p><p>"Potter Iâ€”" Harry quickly covered his mouth, "Come with me." Harry grabbed the slytherin's wrist tightly and pulled him away and inside the castle, leaving behind Draco's journal completely.</p><p>He stood infront of the Room of Requirement and whispered something, still gripping Draco's wrist, the door opened and infront of them was a red and pink striped room and one big bed. Harry smirked, he proceeded to drag Draco along the room, not forgetting to shut it closed.</p><p>The Gryffindor shoved the other onto the fluffy bed,</p><p>"And, call me Harry."</p></div>
