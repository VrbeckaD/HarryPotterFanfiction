    <p>Harry Potter was lying on his bed at the Dursley's. It was the sixth day of the summer holidays and he was feeling glum. He was already missing school. Almost getting killed may not seem fun at the time, but he still felt a twinge of sadness whenever he remembered that he might not have a near death experience for a year or so.</p><p>As he sat there, contemplating the lonely weeks ahead, the doorbell rang. Assuming that it was a friend of the Dursley's, he stayed where he was. He was suprised to hear Uncle Vernon's gruff voice calling up to him "its one of your lot."</p><p>Harry raced downstairs and was happy to see Ron at the door. "what are you doing here Ron?"</p><p>"Mum said you can come and stay all Summer!" he said excitedly.</p><p>"Ill just go pack mate" said Harry, as excited as Ron was.</p><p>Ten minutes later, Harry had said his goodbyes to the Dursleys and was in the car with Ron, Fred and George, on the way to the Burrow.</p><p>When they arrived, Mrs Weasly squeezed Harry tight. "My you've grown Harry, you look more like a man than a boy."</p><p>It was true, thought Harry, but ive grown in other places too! Harry's feeling of elation grew as Crookshanks, Hermione's cat, ran down the stairs to greet him. The cat was followed by the owner and Harry gasped. Hermione had grown too.</p><p>Hermione was wearing a low cut crop top that excentuated her now sizeable breasts. Her long, slim legs were covered in a thin pair of leggings and as she walked, her beautiful ass wiggled, to Harry's great appreciation.</p><p>"Hey Harry, its good to see you," she said in her sweet as honey voice, "I was worried your folks wouldnt let you go."</p><p>"Nah they were cool about it, for once," said an awestruck Harry.</p><p>She gave him a hug which made her big boobs push into his own chest. He was starting to get excited. This was going to be one heck of a Summer.</p>
