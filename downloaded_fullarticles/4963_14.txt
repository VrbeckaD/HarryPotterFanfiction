    <p>Hermione’s flat in Muggle-London looked just like Harry had imagined it.<br/> High walls and white window frames with blue curtains that reached unto the bright wooden floor.<br/> He sat down on one of the crème coloured sofas and let his gaze wander around the room.</p><p>“It’s wonderful, Hermione!” He said, admiring the view over the city from one of the windows.<br/> “I know.” Hermione said smiling.<br/> She returned from the kitchen with two cups of tea. One for Harry and one for herself.</p><p>“So when will the others arrive?” Harry asked and found himself sounding more impatient than he had intended.<br/> When Hermione moved into her new flat with Viktor Krum, she had invited half of the DA for an inauguration party.<br/> Harry had not seen his friends for what felt like eternity.<br/> Of course, he met some of them at work in the Ministry of Magic but spending time with them outside the working hours was a welcome change.<br/> Even thinking of Luna’s wild blonde mane made him feel nostalgic.</p><p>However, out of all of his friends he missed Ron the most. Working as an Auror took up all of his best friend’s time.<br/> They had not seen each other in weeks.<br/> Some might have expected all Aurors to lose their work after Voldemort’s defeat.<br/> Instead, there were many small criminals, harmless compared to the Dark Lord, but outnumbering the Death Eaters by far.</p><p>Hermione could not help but notice the impatience in Harry’s question. Laughing she said “They should be here around eight.”<br/> She gave Harry a sympathetic yet amused look.</p><p>In that moment, there was a heavy knock on the door, making Hermione jump and pour the content of her cup all over her shirt.<br/> “Damn it.”, she muttered looking at the mess. “Where is my wand? Would you open the door please, Harry?”<br/> Harry pulled his own wand out of the pocket of his jacket before answering the door.</p><p>He opened and was immediately overpowered by a hug of his best mate Ron Weasley.<br/> Behind Ron in the corridor were two boisterous Seamus Finnigan and Dean Thomas.<br/> “Harry!” They shouted happily and pulled him in for a warm hug.<br/> “I hope you don’t mind, we’re a bit early.” Ron said lifting his hands that held two opened bottles of Odgen’s Old Firewhiskey. “We brought a present!”<br/> “Where is the good hostess though?” Seamus asked and walked over to the living room, followed by Dean. Harry heard them raucously greet Hermione.</p><p>“Ron, we haven’t seen each other in forever.” Harry said and took the bottles from his friend. “How are you?”<br/> Ron pulled Harry in for another hug, smiling, his cheeks flushed from the firewhiskey.<br/> He had to bend down, as he was a lot taller than Harry was.<br/> “We’re working too hard, man.” He proclaimed and patted Harry’s shoulder.<br/> “I hardly ever see Lavender at the moment. She claims I’m not trying enough to see her.”</p><p>Harry nodded, but his smile froze. When his best mate had announced to him that he was dating Lavender Brown again,<br/> Harry had not expected it to work out for so long. Something about Ron’s relationship with the quirky girl displeased Harry.<br/> Maybe it was the lack of a love life of his own. Or maybe he sensed that this person was not the right one for Ron.<br/> Whatever it was, he was thinking about this relationship more than about any of his own.</p><p>“So I shouldn’t hope to see you more often, should I?” Harry asked.<br/> “No worries, mate! I will take care of the missus and soon it will be as always.” Ron said confidently and followed Seamus and Dean to greet Hermione.</p><p>Ron had called Lavender the <em>missus</em>. Why this certain wording irritated Harry so much, he could only wonder.<br/> They were all adults now. Soon he would visit the first weddings. Concerning this topic he bet all his money on Neville and Luna.<br/> Everybody seemed in love these days, except for Harry who was alone.<br/> Apart from several fame-hungry witches, he had not been able to find candidates for a relationship with the “Boy who lived”.<br/> So Harry screwed one of the firewhiskey bottles open and joined his friends in the living room.</p><p> </p><p>At midnight, the party was already in full swing.<br/> Luna and Neville came over, as well as most of Ron’s siblings and several DA members.<br/> Hermione had great fun showing the magicians her stereo.<br/> She had all the CDs from her parents and even though most of her guests had never heard Muggle music, they danced and partied vividly.<br/> With the help of a charm, Hermione had made her flat soundproof. That way they could turn up the music as loud as they wanted to.</p><p>Harry held a cup full of firewhiskey in his right hand, both arms above his head.<br/> He felt the drink obscure his mind. With the alcohol came a feeling of pleasant apathy.<br/> It freed him from his dark thoughts and made him smile dreamily.</p><p>“Careful with the firewhiskey, Harry.” Fred and George Weasley said, watching his weak dance moves with amusement.<br/> “Do you think he will regret having emptied the whole bottle tomorrow, Georgie?” Fred asked his twin with a smug grin.<br/> “Without any doubt.” George agreed. “He will be badly hungover.”<br/> “Oh shut up!” Harry said smiling hazily. However, a glass of water would be more than appropriate by now, Harry thought. He moved towards Hermione’s kitchen.</p><p>Only as he closed the door behind him and it was finally quiet around him, Harry felt the full extent of his carelessness.<br/> He staggered and held on to the kitchen counter. The music still roaring in his ears.</p><p>“Wow, d’you need some water?” Ron asked grinning.<br/> He sat on the floor in front of the kitchen sink, a glass of whiskey stuck between his bend legs.<br/> “What are you doing here?” Harry asked dazed. Then he got himself something to drink from the fridge.<br/> “Just needed some rest, y’know?” Ron said and Harry noticed that his mate was in no way less drunk than he was.<br/> He poured some water into a glass and sat beside Ron.<br/> Then he felt it.</p><p>One of the rather unfortunate effects that alcohol had on him was the sudden urge to talk.<br/> When Harry started drinking, he could still act all oblivious to his problems.<br/> Being drunk however meant that eventually he would just start rambling.<br/> With all the self-control he had left, Harry pushed the torrent of words down that formed in his mind.<br/> He put the glass to his lips to stop them from talking.</p><p>“I just don’t know what to do with Lavender.” Ron said with a serious look.<br/> “Someone has to make all the money, she has to understand that. And I do love her. Get what I mean?”</p><p>But that was simply too much for Harrys little self-control.<br/> “Oh you love her, do you?” He hissed at Ron before his reason could stop him. “That’s just utter nonsense, Ron.<br/> It didn’t work out the first time with you two. What even is it you like about her? She is exhausting!”</p><p>Ron looked at him with surprise at first. Then he got mad.<br/> “Don’t tell me who I love and who I don't, Harry Potter! After all I know myself best!” He answered furiously.<br/> “Just because you don’t get any!”</p><p>There it was. Harry was alone and the others had already noticed.<br/> Ron’s remark resulted from his anger, but it contained the truth that Harry had tried to hide tonight.<br/> They sat in silence for a moment, looking at each other. Then Ron’s expression changed.</p><p>“Harry, that’s not how I meant it.” He started but Harry shrugged him off.<br/> “It’s exactly how you meant it. You just didn’t want me to know that everybody is wondering why for Merlin’s sake Harry Potter is still alone.” Harry said bitterly.<br/> “And? Any theories?”</p><p>Ron looked tormented.<br/> “Harry that’s rubbish, you will find the girl of your dreams. Just like I found Lavender!”<br/> That was even worse. Harry knew what Ron said was not true.<br/> And it was not due to a pessimistic attitude towards dating.<br/> Harry knew there was someone for him.</p><p>“Ron…” He started but for the first time the words did not come out of his mouth.<br/> “What’s wrong?” Ron asked worriedly when he saw the pain in Harry’ face.<br/> “Do you have to throw up?”</p><p>Harry laughed desperately and wished that it were only that. Instead, the words were stuck in his throat, cutting the air from his lungs.<br/> He had played this scenario over and over again in his head.<br/> But as it was the way of the world, none of his daydreams had featured Ron sitting so close to him.<br/> In none of them, Ron had worryingly put an arm around Harry.<br/> Harry could feel his breath at his neck. He smelled firewhiskey and Ron.</p><p>“Talk to me, you’re scaring me…” Ron muttered but Harry was not ready yet. He hung his head and let black hair cover his face.<br/> Harry only felt Ron beside him and an arm around his shoulders.<br/> There was nothing he wanted more than for Ron to know, but he did not have the courage to say it out aloud.</p><p>“Ron, how important is our friendship to you?” Harry asked quietly and with a thin voice.</p><p>“What?” was Ron’s disbelieving answer. “Harry, you know you’re my best mate and that you mean everything to me.<br/> I thought we had already sorted that out. You know, back in the day when we defeated Voldemort and so on. Remember?”</p><p>Harry smiled weakly. Yes, Ron was his best friend. He was the first friend he ever had.<br/> When Ron had sat down with him on the train, he did not do it because he wanted to meet him.<br/> Ron had never been shy or intimidated because of what happened to Harry. Ron had never whispered his last name when he walked by.<br/> Instead, he sat down with him and treated him like any other person.</p><p>“Yes, I remember. But what would have to happen for that to ever change?” Harry asked.</p><p>“Why, do you want to get rid of me?” Ron grinned.</p><p>“No!” Harry answered shocked.</p><p>“Calm down, I’m just messing with you!” Ron laughed at the sight of Harry’s widely opened green eyes.</p><p>They sat together on the cold kitchen floor and all that Harry noticed was Ron.<br/> He was so close to him that he could have counted every one of his freckles.<br/> Harry looked one last time into Rons blue eyes before they closed and their lips touched.<br/> It was a soft, innocent kiss at first, but it did not remain one.</p><p>Harry let Ron’s tongue enter his mouth. He tasted the firewhiskey on it.<br/> Big hands ran through his black hair and supported his head as Ron kissed him violently.<br/> Harry wished for nothing more than for this moment to last forever.<br/> There could be somebody entering at any moment and see them, but Harry did not mind.<br/> They only separated to breathe. How long had he been waiting for this moment?</p><p>The bigger man pushed him to the kitchen floor, their lips never parting.<br/> Harry was breathless but he wanted more. Moans escaped his bruised lips as Ron moved above him.<br/> Ron seemed to enjoy the view of Harry beneath him.<br/> He let his hands slide down Harrys t-shirt. Surprised by the sudden feeling of skin on skin, Harry moaned aloud.</p><p>“Merlin, Harry…” Ron growled and started kissing his best friends neck while simultaneously caressing his skin under the t-shirt.<br/> Maybe he could make him moan like that again.<br/> He already felt the exciting effect Harry’s moaning had on his own body.</p><p>In that moment the door to the kitchen opened and flooded the room with music.</p><p>“Ron, are you here?”</p><p>Immediately Harry and Ron parted. Shocked, they looked up into Hermione’s face.<br/> Their friend did not seem to grasp what was going on for a moment.<br/> She stood in the door frame, sweating and smiling and holding a cup in her hand.<br/> Then she noticed their pink lips and blushed cheeks.<br/> Their hair was messy and they were lying on the floor, Ron steadying himself with his strong arms, above Harry.</p><p>Finally, she seemed to understand, because her smile disappeared.<br/> She stuttered “Sorry.” and turned around. The door fell shut behind her.</p><p>“Shit.” Ron muttered.<br/> “Shit, shit.”</p><p>He got up and followed the startled Hermione into the living room. Harry felt petrified.<br/> He was still lying on the tiles. His hair was messed up and not less messed up were his thoughts.<br/> What had just happened?<br/> It had all been so quickly. For a second he thought it might all have been a dream.<br/> But he could taste Ron in his mouth and he felt were his hands had only just touched his body.<br/> And he was still hard.</p>
