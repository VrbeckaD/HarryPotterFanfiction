    <h4>September 1st, 2021<br/>
King's Cross/London<br/>
Platform 9 3/4</h4>
<p><br/>
</p>
<p>Harry walked his wife Ginny, their sons James Sirius (nicknamed  JP or "Siri" by meaner muggle-born), his yonger brother Albus Severus (called Sev or Al-much to his distress) and last, but not least Lily Luna ( Lulu and sometimes "FairyLu") to the infamous wall between platform nine and ten. The closer they got the more excited all of them got. It was no surprise that everyone wanted to be the first to go in, so they all started to run faster and faster; the next thing they saw was the smoke of the old steamtrain. Then, the people rushing by; mothers giving out lunches to their kids, fathers heaving luggages, flaming red-the Weasleys- a mess of hugs, goodbye, advice, sweaters and letters, rechecked warmer clothing, from Hugo pouting to Rose already learning. Somewhere little less crowded Harry found Draco talking to his son,smiling all the while reassuringly. Then little Scorpius practically stormed off, securing his belongings-saving them from those who smeared upon them.<br/>
They smiled at each other, Draco sauntering over <em>Off he goes</em>, turning back slightly.

Back by the Weasleys Harry quickly departed with Draco, who absolutely didn't mind that. Not that he displayed ( or could display-status and everything) his discomfort being around them openly. So Harry caught up with Ginny, as she helped some of her many nieces to get her luggage up and into the train. Then they stood back a bit and readied themselves for waving goodbyes and the melancholy that came each and every time they watched the train go...</p>
<p>The train was already going steadily towards Hogwarts, Scorpius and Albus already long seated together in <em>their</em> waggon, surrounded by the mass of sweets they bought ( intending to buy the Lunchlady empty, only to realize it was <em>magically</em> refilled) , stating to get drowsy due to the cozy warmth and them being stuffed. They would have missed their stepout if not for James looking if they did, or not. <em> Al, Al-BUS, ALBUS! Wake up! Sleepy-heads you are. C'mon, this is so embarrasing. I always have to look out for you...If I hadn't forgotten my jacket...</em> Shaking his messy head James left towards the calls of JP, hurry!<br/>
Still halway asleep both followed, side by side, knowing the way by now-cathing just one of the last wagons, sitting next to strangers.<br/>
After arrival the way up to the Great Hall, just lazily following all other students, when suddenly-<em> Mr. Potter, Mr. Malfoy!</em> running into Headteacher McGonagall.<br/>
---<br/>
<em>You're late</em>, one of the older Gryffindors mumbled to Albus, as he sat down looking drained and respectively grim. <em> Ran into Headteach' McGonaLecture you </em> A nod, then all attention was on her and the new students McGonagall brought in herselves.  But to admit, Albus didn't even try to listen and so everything became a blur. He awoke the next morning in his bed not knowing just how he made it there. Only being awaken because the unforving sun shone in his eyes as a younger ripped open the curtains. <em>Close 'em!</em>  he barked, flopping back into his cushions, turning around. Until a moment later he realized, he wasn't at home! So he got up and dressed like a whirlwind, running down the stairs from the Gryffindorm-after squeezing through a little hole of the fat lady closing-into the Great Hall, planting himselves as close to the Slytherin's table as he could, waiting for Scorpius to arrive.<br/>
---<br/>
<em>You're late!</em> The fellow Slytherin happening to sit next to Scorpius sneered. <em> Had a fateful encounter.</em> Scorpius countered arrogantly, head high as his father had shown him. <em> What have you had today?</em> eyes now glittering angrily. His opponent just huffed and turned away as arrogant, but less graceful. Which was purely satisfying to him, as he started eating only the best of food as he had an image to uphold.<br/>
The morning came sooner, very sooner than he expected it to be. But to succed he had only one choice, to do and be the best. And none than the best. He thoughtfully added in his head, studying his books new pages as he made his way up from the Slytherins to the Great Hall.<br/>
---<br/>
James just couldn't believe it, he had to wake up his brother! Well, it could come in handy sometime or another. But it still was infuriating. Hadn't Teddy tackled him and told him they were missing, they had't left the train yet. This meant big time. They'd pay him back generously, maybe even without knowing it? No, where would the fun in that be? He'll just rub it in deep. Very deep.<br/>
Oh, all around him had already started to eat. Well dig in James! Later he wondered if <em>both</em> the troublemakers had made it to the banquet.<br/>
The next morning he left with his group, the wonder forgotten only focused on getting breakfast into his hungry tum. And an evil grin spread across his face foreboding mischief as soon as he saw them troublemakers.</p>
