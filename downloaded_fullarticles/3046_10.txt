  <i>“Don’t be scared,” Dora said, and set her on the broom, climbing on after her. They rose steadily.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>“The trick is to get some height,” Dora told her as the ground disappeared into the clouds. Her arm was warm and secure around Harriet’s waist.</i>
</p><p>
  <i> “Let the broom do the work for you. Falling is always faster than flying.”</i>

<hr/><p>The rug in the parlor scratched against Harriet's cheek. She stared at the red and blue wool, crossing and uncrossing her eyes to make it look more interesting. Mumma and Daddy were arguing in the kitchen again, and it was the most miserable feeling in the world knowing they were arguing about <i>her</i>.</p><p>The front door creaked. Harriet rolled her head to the side and watched blurry silver shoes come towards her. “Why’re you under the sofa?” Dora asked in a whisper. “Are they fighting again?”</p><p>Harriet nodded and bit her lip really hard. She didn’t want to be a baby and cry in front of Dora. “I was bad,” she said as quiet as she could.</p><p>Dora snorted, like Mumma was always telling her not to, and dropped onto the floor next to Harriet. She turned to look at Harriet, and crossed her eyes like yesterday, when she’d been teaching Harriet how to do it.</p><p>“You can’t be bad,” she told her. “That’s like water not being wet, or Snape not being slimy.”</p><p>Something in the kitchen shattered. Dora was crawling under the sofa now; she was almost too big. Harriet squirmed into her, and tucked herself under Dora's arm, where everything was warm and smelled like bubblegum.</p><p>“I was bad in public,” she told Dora, and stared at the side of Dora’s shirt instead of the rug. It was silver and sparkly, like Dora's shoes.</p><p>Dora hummed, and it moved through Harriet's whole body. It made her feel slow and sleepy, like when Dora read to her after she had a bad dream. “Well,” Dora said in her teasing voice, “you can’t have not kept your face on, <i>you’ve</i> only got the one. Did you put on the wrong arms and legs?”</p><p>Harriet giggled, and tucked herself in closer. “No-o, Dora. That’s silly.”</p><p>“Hmm,” Dora said. “Well, did you—pull down all the oranges at the grocery store?”</p><p>“That was you!”</p><p>“Hmm, did you knock over an old lady and get turned into a newt?”</p><p>Harriet tucked her face into Dora's side and shook her head.</p><p>“Harry?” Dora tickled her side, but Harriet didn’t want to laugh.</p><p>“—HAVE TO HIDE!” Daddy shouted, and Harriet shivered.</p><p>Dora was all tight and hard now, not soft and warm and giggly. She put her arm extra heavy around Harriet's shoulders, and said, “Did someone <i>see</i> you?”</p><p>Harriet's nose hurt a lot, like when she was going to cry. She said, “I didn’t mean to.”</p><p>“—BE SO STUPID—” Mumma screamed. “YOU <i>KNOW</i> SHE KNEW THE POTTERS!”</p><p>That was a bad word. They weren’t supposed to <i>say</i> that word. Harriet felt two fat tears squeeze out of her eyes. The old lady had said that word, and now Mumma was saying it, and Daddy would have to put her timeout and it was all Harriet's fault.</p><p>Dora moved away, out of the space under the sofa, and Harriet clutched at her. “Don’t leave,” she begged. “Please, Dora. I’m sorry.”</p><p>“Come on,” Dora told her, and got up onto her knees. She grabbed Harriet's arm, not hard to make it hurt like Jessy-at-daycare’s sister did, Dora <i>never</i> did that, even when Harriet couldn’t walk as fast as her. She tugged Harriet out too, even though she didn’t want to go. The fight was louder just from the floor, and Harriet wanted to put her hands over her ears, but Dora was holding on now, and pulling her.</p><p>“Where’re your glasses?” Dora asked, and tousled Harriet's hair.</p><p>“My room,” she whispered. The whole house was too big and loud when Mumma and Daddy were fighting. She liked the water-color world better when they told her to go play and went into the kitchen and shut the door.</p><p>Dora didn’t go up to Harriet's room though. She went down the hall to the big wooden door with the metal bars, the one Harriet wasn’t supposed to go past unless Mumma was with her. “No,” Harriet said, and tugged away when Dora opened it. “We’ll get in trouble.”</p><p>“Mum and Dad are in trouble,” Dora said. “Look, you just wait here, okay? You don’t have to go in.”</p><p>Harriet hugged herself, and nodded. “I’ll be right back,” Dora whispered, and pressed her face hard to Harriet's head. “Don’t move, and stay quiet, okay? Like a little mouse.”</p><p>And then she was going back down the hallway, blurring into the walls. Harriet tucked herself against the wall. There was no interesting rug to look at here, and the walls were white. She stared at her feet, instead. She was wearing her cat socks, brown and grey and tan, and she wiggled her toes.</p><p>Cats ate mice. She thought she was always supposed to be like the mice—Mumma and Daddy always wanted her to be small and quiet when they went to Diagon Alley and other places. But if Harriet was a mouse, that old lady was definitely a cat, but not a nice cat like the Colonel. She was a <i>mean</i> cat, and Harriet had been so <i>stupid</i>, asking Daddy if they could get ice cream while that nasty lady was talking to him, and now everything was awful.</p><p>Something scuffled. Dora was back, and she had Harriet's glasses, and her shoes, and Dora had her broom, too, tucked under her arm. Harriet knew how to tie her own shoelaces, she wasn’t a baby anymore, but Dora said, “Shh,” with her finger on her lips, and tied them herself.</p><p>And then she was putting her arm heavy around Harriet again, and before Harriet had time to say no, she didn’t want to get in trouble, Dora made her go through the big door.</p><p>This was Mumma’s room—not even Daddy came down here without Mumma saying he could. There were lots of big, interesting tables, and cauldrons as huge as the biggest stew pot, the one Mumma made mashed potatoes in during Christmas, and lots of books with no pictures. And they weren't allowed to play with any of them, only look with their eyes.</p><p>But Dora didn’t want any of these things. She took them back to the end of the room, where the big stone fireplace was. She put her broom down, and took her arm away and got the matches on the top of the fireplace.</p><p>Mumma always kept logs in there—Dora knew how to make the fire go.</p><p>“No,” Harriet said again. “No, we aren’t supposed to! Not without Mumma and Daddy! And there’ll be mean old ladies, and they’ll <i>see</i> me!”</p><p>“Bugger them,” Dora said, and her face wasn’t her face anymore, it was a mean face. It had big dark eyes like holes in the ground and white skin, like a ghost and not a person, and lots of dark, messy hair. “We’re not staying here while they break everything in the kitchen again.”</p><p>Harriet put her hands over her eyes. Her chest hurt, and her nose, and she started to cry.</p><p>“Oh, Harry, no,” Dora said. Harriet didn’t want to look.</p><p>“I don’t like that face,” she cried. “Please, Dora, put it away.”</p><p>“It’s gone,” Dora said and out her arms around Harriet. “Look, it’s gone. I won’t ever make it again.”</p><p>Something upstairs made a loud noise. Harriet cried harder, and grabbed at Dora.</p><p>“Let’s not stay here,” Dora said, and rocked her. “Let’s go flying, c’mon. Mum and Dad are in timeout, we can go, we don’t even have to ask.” She pulled Harriet's hands away, and her face was her Dora face again. She made her hair bright green, like she was doing a secret wink, and wiped Harriet's nose with her sleeve where it dripped.</p><p>Harriet cuddled close. “There won’t be any old ladies?” she asked.</p><p>“No,” Dora said. “Absolutely not.”</p><p>“And I can fly on your broom?”</p><p>“Yes,” Dora said, really fast. “You’re too old for a baby broom. And <i>real</i> flying’s brilliant, you’ll love it.”</p><p>“Mumma and Daddy are in timeout?” Harriet sniffled and clutched Dora's sleeve. “We can leave when they’re in timeout?”</p><p>“Every time they fight, they’re in timeout,” Dora said. “And I’ll take you away. If I’m not here, you can go to Granny’s house, okay?”</p><p>“Okay,” Harriet said. She loved Granny, and Granny <i>never</i> went into the kitchen and shut the door and yelled a lot.</p><p>“Good,” Dora said. “Here, we’ll Floo together, okay? So you don’t get lost.”</p><p>“Okay,” Harriet said.</p><p>Dora could reach the big glass bowl on top of the fireplace. She grabbed a big handful of Floo powder, and threw it into the fire. “Hog’s Head Inn!” she cried, and the fire turned green.</p><p>“Here,” she told Harriet. “You hold my broom, yeah, like that, and I’ll hold onto you. Ready?”</p><p>Harriet screwed up her eyes really tightly, and nodded.</p><p>Dora held her hand really tight, and Harriet was hardly scared at all when they jumped into the fire. It crackled around them, warm and itchy in Harriet's nose, and then Dora was tugging them, and they fell out onto the floor.</p><p>It was really dark and dusty there. Harriet sneezed and looked around. There were loads of tables and chairs, and an old man with a long beard behind a counter. He was coming towards them with a broom—a sweeping one, not a flying one.</p><p>“Urghhh,” Dora groaned. “Harry, get off my stomach.” And then she froze.</p><p>Harriet stared at her. She was supposed to <i>never</i> be Harriet in public. If the man heard— He was right there—</p><p>Dora pushed Harriet off, and scrambled up. “Sir,” she said to the man.</p><p>“Tonks,” he grunted, and started sweeping up all the ash from the fireplace.</p><p>Dora looked at Harriet, and grabbed her hand. She made her hair normal, really fast, and stood so close to Harriet their sides touched. “This is my sister,” she said after a moment, slowly, like she was scared too.</p><p>The old man was looking at Harriet—not at her face but right into her eyes. He said, “Well, girl?”</p><p>“Sorry?” Dora asked, in a high voice.</p><p>“What’s her name?”</p><p>Dora's shoulders got looser. “Asterope,” she said, really fast.</p><p>“And what’re the two of you doing here, disturbing my peace, in the middle of summer?” he demanded. "Have enough trouble with you during the school year."</p><p>“Just Flooing in, sir,” Dora said. “There’s nowhere to fly in Oxford.”</p><p>He grunted, and turned away, his broom gathering up a neat pile of ash. “Lucky you didn’t try The Three Broomsticks,” he said. “Castle staff’s there.”</p><p>“Right,” Dora said, slowly. “We’ll, we’ll just Floo out from here when we’re done, then.”</p><p>The old man said, “You do that.” And then he ignored them, like they weren’t even there anymore. Harriet felt a lot better that he did. She put her hand in Dora's, and Dora took her broom back, and they went towards the door.</p><p>Harriet looked back over her shoulder, and the old man wasn’t sweeping anymore. He was watching them, and Harriet smiled at him. He didn’t smile back—he looked so grumpy, like he <i>never</i> smiled, but he nodded at her really slowly, almost like he was bowing.</p><p>And then they were outside, in the cloud-grey light, and Dora tugged her along the street. There were lots of interesting shops and things, and other kids, too, but Dora didn’t stop or slow down, and Harriet didn’t ask her to. She was too afraid that there would be another old lady.</p><p>And then there were no more shops, just funny crooked houses, and then there weren’t even those. Trees huddled around them, tall and dark and scary, and Harriet moved closer to Dora.</p><p>“It’s alright,” Dora said, not looking. “We’re almost there.”</p><p>And then the trees were gone, and there was a big, grassy field. It was huge, bigger than the play field at daycare, and all the grass was long, and tall, and moved a little with the wind.</p><p>“My friends and I found it,” Dora told Harriet, and cuddled her into her side. “I thought it would be a perfect place for your first flight.” When Harriet looked up, Dora's hair was green again, and messy like Harriet's. “Do you like it?” Dora asked.</p><p>“Yeah,” Harriet said. She was looking at Dora's broomstick, slung over her shoulder.</p><p>“No appreciation for nature,” Dora said in her teasing voice. “C’mon, Harry.”</p><p>Harriet paused, hand in Dora's still.</p><p>“It’s fine out here,” Dora told her. “There’s no one, just us.”</p><p>Harriet shook her head. “I’m not supposed to,” she said anxiously.</p><p>“Well,” Dora said, “I’m not teaching <i>Asterope</i> to fly. She’s a little mouse, and mice don’t like flying.”</p><p>“I’m not a mouse!” Harriet said. "That's Mumma and Daddy's pretend game!"</p><p>“Well, what are you then?” Dora demanded, hands on her hips, grinning.</p><p>“I’m a— a hawk!” Harriet cried.</p><p>“Harry the hawk,” Dora said. “Harry Hawk. A proper wizarding name. I like it. And everyone knows, hawks love to fly.”</p><p>“And they eat mice,” Harriet told Dora. “Look, I’ve got big sharp teeth for mice eating.”</p><p>Dora laughed. “C’mere, little hawk,” she said. She took her broom, and put it in the air, where it hovered all by itself.</p><p>Harriet hopped anxiously from one foot to the other, away from the outstretched arm. “Alone?” she asked.</p><p>“No, I’m going with you,” Dora said. “We’ll share my broom—sharing things is good, remember?” Now her face was Mumma's face.</p><p>Harriet made a face and put her tongue out. Dora made a face back, her real face. And then she mounted on the broom, balancing on the tips of her toes, and grabbed Harriet under the arms.</p><p>Harriet squealed, but Dora was fast, and put her on the broom in front of her. “Don’t be scared,” she told Harriet, and put an arm around her. Her other hand reached out and grabbed the handle.</p><p>Into Harriet's ear, in a silly whisper, Dora asked, “D’you remember when Dad took us to the mountains to get a Christmas tree last year? You were so little.”</p><p>“I wasn’t!” Harriet cried.</p><p>“So you do remember?”</p><p>“Yeah, ‘course!”</p><p>Dora held her close, and slowly the broom started to rise. Harriet grabbed at the handle, and kicked her feet.</p><p>“Remember how he showed us the owls?” Dora asked. “How they went after all the little mice from above?”</p><p>“Yeah,” Harriet said, staring at the trees around the field in wonder. They were so tall!</p><p>“Hawks hunt like that, too,” Dora said. “They get up high, just like this.”</p><p>And they were going high! Past the trees, into the air, and Harriet shrieked excitedly. She could see the town! And there, there was something past the town, down below it. Something big and grey with lots of tall bits. “Is that Hogwarts?” she cried.</p><p>“Yeah,” Dora said. “That’s where I go to school, and Divination’s in <i>that</i> Tower—” she stretched her arm out really far, pointing, and Harriet followed her finger to one of the high towers. “And that’s the clock tower, it’s so loud during the day! And the lake, and the groundskeeper’s hut, there. Nearly in the trees.”</p><p>Harriet stared. “It’s so pretty,” she said. “Do you like it there?”</p><p>“Loads,” Dora told her. “Ever since first year. The only thing it hasn’t got is you.” And then she tickled Harriet's side.</p><p>“Stoppit!” Harriet cried, and squirmed.</p><p>“Afraid you’ll fall?” Dora asked. “Look how well you balanced! Hawks don’t fall—didn’t you know they’re birds? Maybe you are a hawk, with a little bird brain.”</p><p>Harriet laughed. “But they fall,” she said. “Like the owls, when they hunt. You said!”</p><p>“They dive,” Dora told her. “It’s better than falling, so much faster. You want to try it? We’ll have to go higher.”</p><p>“I’m not scared,” Harriet said. “Dora, please!”</p><p>“Oh, alright,” Dora said. The broom started rising again, in slow loops around the field, and Harriet looked at the town, the mountains, the castle, the town—</p><p>“The trick is to get some height,” Dora told her. Now they were so high they were going into the clouds, wispy white around them. Harriet grabbed for one, and her hands got wet. She looked down, and the ground was disappearing into pale white light, blurring like when she took her glasses off.</p><p>“Think we’re high enough?” Dora asked.</p><p>“No!” Harriet cried. “Go higher, Dora!”</p><p>And then they were <i>above</i> to clouds! Like in an aeroplane! Everything below them was grey, except where the clouds were patchy. Dora held Harriet tighter. “Now we’re high enough,” Dora said. “C’mon, little hawk, listen.”</p><p>Harriet leaned back and put her head against Dora's shoulder. There wasn’t any sound up there, just the grey below them, and the blue all around them, and the warm sun.</p><p>“I’ll tell you a secret,” Dora said in her ear. “It’s a special secret—and it took me a long time to figure it out. Ready to hear it?”</p><p>“Yeah,” Harriet whispered back.</p><p>“You have to let the broom do the work for you,” Dora said, quiet like a hawk, her hair tickling Harriet's face. “Falling is always faster than flying.”</p><p>“Diving, Dora,” Harriet said. “Diving, like a hawk.”</p><p>“That’s right,” Dora said, and put her arm so tight around Harriet. “Diving!”</p><p>And then the broom was pointing right at the ground, and the wind was coming fast, fast, and Harriet was screaming, as loud as she could, because there wasn't room for all the good feeling inside her.</p>
