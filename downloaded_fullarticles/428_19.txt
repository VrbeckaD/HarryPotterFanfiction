    <p>The evening air hanging over the harbor is so dense and cold that it weighs on one’s shoulders, smells like washed up fish and sodden dog, and feels like frostbite.</p><p>Severus carries the man, half-conscious, teetering on death, up a set of stone steps and into an old warehouse. It will be teaming with shiphands on the morrow, but for now it’s empty and warmer than the unforgiving sea air, at least.</p><p>Severus lays the man down not so gently on the mud-and-fiber floor. He spits up more water and it dribbles down his chin, so Severus turns him over to his side to prevent choking. Then Severus tucks up against the wall, swords laid beside him, arms hanging over his knees, and waits.</p><p>It’s nearly ten minutes to four in the morning when James Potter begins coughing up murky water. His heart had returned to a comfortable soon after being brought here- Severus was monitoring- and now, it seems, his body is coming back into it’s strength, warmth returning to his fingers and cheeks.</p><p>He smells like dead fish and Severus’ mouth is fixed into a grimace for being subjected to it for the majority of the night. But under that, somewhere deep in his tunic, or a kiss next to his ear perhaps, he still smells of Lily.</p><p>The Potter family was a wealthy one, and oh, it was quite the scandal when he took up with Lily Evans, even though she was part of the lower nobility. The Evans family sent their girls to tutors commissioned by the city, where the lowly children went, like Severus. And <i>that</i> was a grave misstep according to their peers, and they were cast off thusly as fraternizing with the poor. So Lily Evans stood one foot in alleys, orphanages, and pubs on the outskirts, and one foot in horse races, masquerade balls, and mansions, her big sister Petunia tagging behind all the while. </p><p>It was this wild, red-headed girl that Severus fell in love with in his youth, certain he would make something better of himself than a nameless orphan so that he could give her a life she deserved, as good or better than she was brought up. One day, a Witcher clad in soot-black arrived to the orphanage to pick out strong boys, and Severus begged to be taken. The Witcher laughed at him, picked on his scrawny, lanky frame and beakish nose. He chased their cart three miles out of the city before they let him get in, heels bloodied and later infected so badly that he couldn’t stand for a month.</p><p>Except when Severus survived the Trial of the Grasses and returned to Beauclair to find her, she was living in the Potter estate. <i>The Silver Stag</i>, they called Potter. And here he is now, just shy of a year after Severus’ return, silk shirt soiled with sea water, laying at his feet. It’s amazing how hurriedly men bend at the bribe of a bag of coin.</p><p>Potter’s consciousness returns to him just enough to allow confusion and he shoots up, then scrambles back at the sight of Severus. “Where are we?” he shouts, voice hoarse. He grips his throat, then his chest, and takes in the sight of his own miry clothes. Severus tosses him his glasses; what a wench the dive for them was, after he’d thrown Potter up on the deck. They sunk all the hundred feet to the bottom of the harbor and embedded in the swirling muck, and Severus nearly abandoned them. It was a vindictive thing, the motive which made him retrieve the glasses. Potter would need them.</p><p>“You stumbled off of the dock trying to come off your ship, drunk,” Severus says simply, no strain to keep the solemn composure that is so natural to a witcher. As a boy, he might have grown red-faced for the lie. White Honey is a potent anti-toxin for witchers, but to humans, it’s a sedative so strong, it’s deadly. Someone on the ship distilled a few drops given in a vial into James Potter’s costly wine. “You nearly drowned, and your men were either too in their drink or too moronic to take notice.”</p><p>“And <i>why</i>,” James squints his eyes, “were <i>you</i> loitering around my ship just as I happen to fall in the harbor,” he sputters, unbelieving.</p><p>“I suppose I won’t give you an answer you’ll like, but it’s lucky I was, nonetheless, isn’t it?”</p><p>James just stares, spectacles cracked in one lens.</p><p>Severus sighs and stands, realizing he must bear this farce for just a little longer before it will grant him his fruit. He outstretches his hand, offering to pull James from the floor. “I was taking a contract from the Port Master. Animal has been stealing cargo at night.”</p><p>James nods then, takes Severus’ hand and wobbles a bit on his footing. He tries to correct the lay of his tunic, but it’s no use to his appearance. “I suppose I owe you my gratitude,” James says, shakily, but not from the recent stress to his lungs and throat. Severus can smell the fear on him, the <i>dread</i>. It smells like licorice, if it could rot.</p><p>“You may owe me a bit more,” Severus says.</p><p>“As it’s right,” James sighs heavily, scrubbing his temples with thumb and forefinger, “Do what you will.”</p><p>“I invoke the Law of Surprise,” Severus whispers, “Give me the first thing you see when you walk through the threshold of your home.” He wonders if fate will grant him this, even if he has exploited her so. A cursed and lonely man it may make him, but what else is a witcher already, than cursed, than lonely?</p><p>James nods, leans over to fix the tie of his boot, then leaves.</p>
