  <em>The Cost of Vengeance</em>
</h2><h3>October 21, 1979</h3><p>Severus Tobias Snape had a secret, and if he hadn’t been forced to keep it, he might have taught those bastard Marauders a lesson long ago. But the Ministry had little love lost for his kind, and so, Severus had little choice but to keep his true nature—and his true powers—under wraps. This meant he also had little choice but to endure the Marauders’ torture sessions, though he longed to crush them all under his feet, shred them with his claws, blast them with magic so dark, even the Dark Lord would lose his dinner.</p><p>Until now.</p><p>No, now Severus was free to torment the bastards if he so chose, and his… <em>employer</em> would only laugh and congratulate him on a job well done.</p><p>At least, Severus <em>should </em>have been free, but whenever he begun to fantasise of revenge, the Dark Lord always seemed to have some sort of menial task for him. Brew a potion here, work out an antidote there….</p><p>Go down to Hogsmeade late at night and interview for the Defence against the Dark Arts position at Hogwarts….</p><p>Severus ducked his head against a blast of icy air peppered with stinging ice crystals and made his way to a small, dingy pub on the fringes of Hogsmeade. The Hogshead. He didn’t much like the idea of going so close to Dumbledore, but the Dark Lord had sent him, and had also assured Severus that his <em>difference </em>would be well-hidden by the magical glamours he had cast upon him before the meeting. Severus had his doubts. Dumbledore had always been far too prescient for his own good.</p><p>He also doubted Dumbledore would give him the job. No, that man had never cared much for Severus. Else, he might have had done <em>something</em> to protect him from the cruel humans who made his childhood a misery, Muggle and wizard alike. Instead, he had sat back and watched, and to that end, Severus deemed him as guilty as the Muggles who had hurt him. The idea of accepting employment from the man who had so callously watched Severus suffer and done nothing to prevent it left a pit of roiling acid in his stomach.</p><p>As did the knowledge that the Dark Lord wanted him to take the post as an excuse to torture Muggleborn children where no one would be the wiser.</p><p>Well, Severus had no intention of doing so. Destroying Muggles for their cruelty was one thing, but his bent for revenge had never stretched to children.</p><p>Still, he had to at least <em>appear</em> to make an effort during the interview, or the Dark Lord would not be pleased. A human could not kill him, true, but he could make Severus’ life extremely unpleasant. And if the Dark Lord alerted the Ministry to his suspicions about Severus’ state of being… well, it was all over for him either way. He could handle one human, or even several at once, but the Unspeakables knew ways to bring his kind down regardless. Or worse, to keep him imprisoned for the duration of his long, long lifespan.</p><p>Severus shuddered and tugged his cloak closer over his shoulders. Best to keep the one human who suspected the truth of him happy. Merlin knew no one would fall on their sword for him if the worst happened. No, Severus had to survive by his wits alone. It was just luck he had plenty of those. Probably wouldn’t have made it out of childhood in one piece otherwise.</p><p>Gods, he <em>really </em>didn’t want to do this. Dumbledore would see through his glamours, he was sure of it.</p><p>Despite everything he endured to keep his nature hidden, certain people—powerful people—could sense that there was more to him than met the eye. It was why he took such pains to avoid the old man. His aura <em>reeked </em>of magic, and Severus had no doubt he would ferret out his secret if he stayed within his sights too long. The Dark Lord was another of those people who had too much power not to see past the veil of Severus’ apparent humanity, but whereas Dumbledore would most likely side with the Ministry if he ever learned the truth, the Dark Lord found Severus… <em>intriguing</em>.</p><p>And to someone who had never held much interest for others beyond acting as a favoured punching bag, not even to his own mother, being intriguing was novel. Comforting. Even if the light part of his nature didn’t trust the source.</p><p>The Death Eaters had welcomed him like a brother, or at least the Dark Lord had, and Severus thrilled in the rare sensation of being <em>wanted</em>. Not reviled or feared or mocked, but desired. He had never felt more powerful than when the Dark Lord had marked him as his own and promoted him straight to the inner circle.</p><p>Granted, the discovery of what the Death Eaters <em>truly </em>did to Muggles had disturbed Severus, but he appeased the light half of himself by remembering what his father had done to deserve justice. His neighbours. And Merlin forbid, the <em>church</em>. The memory of a small, blonde-haired lad and his cruel fate had spurred even his light side to action, and all his misgivings fell away. Muggles had earned their fate by their cruelty. He was merely a harbinger.</p><p>Another blast of snowy wind nearly knocked him off his feet. Severus had to use his wings to keep himself upright. Thank the gods humans couldn’t see them unless Severus allowed them to. Well, his mate would be able to, if such a creature existed, but only if they accepted Severus as good and worthy unconditionally, and fat chance of that. He ignored the twinge of pain the knowledge brought and moved on. He had accepted the fact that he would spend his centuries alone long ago. No use getting worked up about it now.</p><p>A turn of the corner revealed the front of the pub, dirty windows glowing orange with candlelight and the warmth of a roaring fire, and Severus shivered and quickened his pace. Merlin, but he didn’t look forward to moving to the Scottish highlands should Dumbledore somehow offer him the job. The south of Britain got its fair share of snow, but nothing like <em>this</em>. For Merlin’s sake, it was October, not bleeding January!</p><p>At least Aberforth had the good sense not to plaster his pub in the same gaudy décor as his neighbours. Merlin, Severus hated human holidays, and Halloween was the worst. The humans had no idea what the day truly meant, and neither did they care. To them, it was simply a day to dress in foolish costumes, drink pumpkin juice and ale, and gorge themselves on sweets. If they knew they were celebrating the day Hell’s powers peaked and the veil between life and death thinned enough to birth more of his dark-sided kin into the human plane of existence, Severus reckoned they would sooner cower in their homes and drown themselves in holy water than celebrate.</p><p>Pity they didn’t know, really. He ignored the small voice in the back of his head—<em>‘You mightn’t hate the holidays so much if you had someone to share them with’—</em>and stepped into the pub.</p><p>With a sigh, he kicked the snow from his boots, shook out his cloak, and looked around the room. Dumbledore sat near the fireplace, tucked away in a private booth with an oddly-dressed woman Severus didn’t know. He met the man’s eyes as approached the bar, questioning, and Dumbledore directed him to wait with a wave of his hand. Severus gave a curt nod and settled at a nearby table, refusing Aberforth’s offer of a drink when he came around. Much as he liked the taste of firewhiskey and scotch, Severus would need his wits about him if he planned to come out of this meeting unscathed, and alcohol went through his system much faster than that of a human. His light side simply couldn’t handle it.</p><p>No, best to resist temptation for one evening.</p><p>“I am simply here to await an interview with the headmaster.”</p><p>Aberforth shrugged and headed back behind the bar. Severus chose a seat near enough to the headmaster to hear him call—by human standards at least—and listened with half an ear to the old man’s current interview.</p><p>“And you say you are descended from the renowned Seer, Cassandra Trelawney?”</p><p>The batty woman nodded and sipped a glass of spirits. By the colour, Severus thought it was probably sherry. Her giant spectacles and myriad rings, bangles, and necklaces glinted in the firelight as she moved. She reminded Severus of nothing so much as a giant dragonfly.</p><p>“She was my grandmother, sir. Taught me as much of the mystical arts as she could before she passed to the realm beyond.”</p><p>“Indeed. Perhaps you might share some of her knowledge with me?”</p><p>The woman nodded to Dumbledore’s teacup. “Might I trouble you to finish that and swirl the dregs clockwise three times?”</p><p>“Ah, a tea leaf reading. It has been many years. Of course. One moment.” The old man drained the cup, swirled it a about thrice, and set it on the table before the woman. “What do you see, Madam Trelawney?”</p><p>“Ah, just a moment.”</p><p>She lifted the cup and peered into its depths. After a moment, a shudder passed over her. Her many bangles, chains, and sequins glinted in the candlelight.</p><p>“Danger. A man of dark and light walks close and brings disaster on his heels.”</p><p>Severus stiffened and studiously did <em>not </em>look at the old man.</p><p>“I see portents of ill-tidings, desperate risk to loved ones, secrets and shadows. And….” She turned the cup at an angle and cocked her head. “Ah! But there is good news too. A ray of light in the darkness, hope and bravery and goodness, comes swiftly.”</p><p>Dumbledore gave her a wan smile as he took the cup from her once more. “I see. So you have no <em>specific</em> warnings? Names, places, dates?”</p><p>Severus clutched his wand under the table and prayed the woman was as much a fraud as she appeared.</p><p>Trelawney blushed. “Er… I… well, it is difficult to read specifics from tea leaves, but perhaps if I focus on your aura—”</p><p>“That will not be necessary, thank you. At this time, I think it is best to—”</p><p>Dumbledore cut himself off as Trelawney went rigid, eyes wide and staring at something beyond his head. “Sybil? Madam, are you well?”</p><p>The woman’s head lolled forwards and her shoulders sagged.</p><p>“Oh dear. Perhaps the sherry was off. Aberforth, I believe a bit of firewhiskey is in order.”</p><p>“Right away,” the barman grumbled and rummaged among his bottles.</p><p>“Just rest there, madam,” said Dumbledore in a soothing voice. “We will have you right as rain in—”</p><p>Trelawney’s head shot back up, eyes staring straight at Dumbledore, though Severus felt the aura on her and knew she wasn’t seeing anything so close. A breathy rasp croaked past her lips, far too deep for a woman so slight, and her words froze Severus to his seat.</p><p>“The one with the power to defeat the Dark Lord approaches….”</p><p>Severus couldn’t contain a gasp. He clutched his wand and leaned close, trying to listen to every word without making his attention obvious. Aberforth watched him as he poured a shot of firewhiskey, eyes narrowed and full of a healthy dose of suspicion.</p><p>“The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches,” Trelawney repeated. “Born to those who have thrice defied him, born as the seventh month dies… and the Dark Lord will—”</p><p>A hand slammed down in front of Severus, splashing him with firewhiskey and jarring him out of his concentration.</p><p>“I think you’ve heard enough, lad.” Roughly, Aberforth hoisted Severus up by the collar and dragged him out of the pub.</p><p>“Wait! What are you—”</p><p>“Don’t try my patience, boy, or it’ll be the worse for you.” Aberforth threw Severus into the snow and tossed his belongings at his head. “And stay out!”</p><p>Severus blinked, stunned and unsure of what had just happened. How had Aberforth known? Severus thought he had hidden his interest well. Perhaps the old man had sensed it in his aura somehow.</p><p>Icy wind blasted Severus full in the face, and the man shivered from head-to-toe. With a grimace, he tugged on his cloak and gathered it around him. Perhaps the news of a prophecy concerning the Dark Lord would be enough to pacify him when he realised Severus hadn’t had the chance to interview for the Defence position at all.</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>Severus knelt before the Dark Lord and finished his tale. “At that point, Aberforth threw me bodily out of the pub. Unfortunately, I was not able to interview for the position at this time. I apologise for my failures. I will make another attempt as soon as possible, if it pleases my lord.”</p><p>Gods, he hated the bowing and scraping—this human should be grateful to him, not the other way around—but Severus hadn’t survived this long by advertising his true nature. He wasn’t foolish enough to start now.</p><p>Besides, he sensed the magical strength and dark aura in the Dark Lord. For all Severus knew, this might be the one human who could match his powers. And if Trelawney’s prophecy had any merit, fighting him would be suicide regardless. <em>‘The one with the power to vanquish the dark lord approaches….’ </em>If the prophesied warrior would be born at the end of July, Severus certainly didn’t qualify. His kind were only born in midwinter even if he hadn’t come twenty years too early.</p><p>As the silence stretched on, Severus dared a peek at the Dark Lord. The man stood before him, eyes narrowed and a fingertip tracing his lower lip.</p><p>“The one with the power to vanquish me, hmm?” He gave a dark laugh. “I should like to see the infant who could defeat a god!”</p><p>Severus barely contained his snort. God indeed. Merlin, as much as he enjoyed the Dark Lord’s favour, the man was a hopeless megalomaniac.</p><p>Around him, the other Death Eaters laughed along with their master.</p><p>Lucius called, “What will he do, my lord? Throw his rattle at you? Drown you in milk?”</p><p>Bellatrix gave a twisted cackle. “No brat has a hope of defeating you, my lord.”</p><p>The Dark Lord nodded abstractedly. “Hmm. No, but perhaps it is better to be cautious. Who among our kind do we know of that is due at the end of July?”</p><p>“Alice Longbottom,” said Rosier. “Heard me cousin talking about it the other day, m’lord.”</p><p>The dark lord clenched his fist at his side. “I see. Anyone else?”</p><p>“I have heard rumours, my lord,” said Rookwood, his expression nervous. “You know Arthur Weasley works at the Ministry? I overheard him in the lift several days ago. It seems the Potters are expecting, and the baby is due at the end of July.”</p><p>Severus’ breath caught and his heart lodged in his throat. <em>‘Lily?’</em></p><p>Only two humans had ever accepted him as he was: Adam Jamison, who had died long ago, and Lily Evans—he would <em>never </em>call her Potter.</p><p>His world collapsed to a single memory. Watching as Lily brought a flower to life and handed it to him, her smile welcoming and warm, her eyes clear of judgment.</p><p>He had lost her years before, when his sharp tongue and defiant nature lashed out at the wrong person, when the darkness within him had surged so strongly that even Lily could no longer deny it, when he had turned her away in his moment of need and called her a vicious slur she had never deserved, he had lost her forever.</p><p>But he had never stopped loving her.</p><p>She had always been the exception to the rule. Muggleborns came from foul, vapid, monsters, but Lily had overcome the shackles of her heritage. She was lovely, kind, and brave, and Severus adored her. She was his sister as much as anyone could be, and the idea of her in danger turned his blood to ice.</p><p>“M-my lord,” he breathed, “please,” but the Dark Lord wasn’t listening.</p><p>“Potter and Longbottom, hmm?” His eyes flashed red. “Well, then we know who shall be the first to die.”</p><p>“My lord, <em>please</em>.”</p><p>The Dark Lord looked to Severus, a scowl of suspicion evident on his face.</p><p>Severus lifted his face, revealing tears on his lashes. “Lily—she was the only one to ever be kind to me from this world. Please… I beg you, spare her life.”</p><p>Rage burned in the human’s eyes. “You would choose a mudblood over your lord and master?”</p><p>Severus swallowed hard. “Kill her brat if you must, but please, spare her.”</p><p>His angelic side let out a silent howl of dismay. Kill her brat? An infant and Lily’s child? No. No, he couldn’t abide by that, but neither was he foolish enough to admit it in the presence of the one her child had possibly been prophesied to defeat.</p><p>The Dark Lord’s scowl deepened. “<em>Crucio</em>!”</p><p>Pain like Severus had never known flooded him. His bones snapped and healed, only to break again the next moment. His organs turned themselves inside out. His blood burned, his brain melted, and his heart screamed as it desperately fought to keep him alive through the onslaught.</p><p>Severus had seen it happen to others, but this was the first time he had felt the cut of the Dark Lord’s disappointment. He had never imagined the pain to be so intense. No wonder so many went mad before it stopped.</p><p>As the spell lifted, he became aware of the tears on his cheeks, the blood running warm and wet down his face, the pain still present in the bridge of his nose even while the remnants faded from the rest of his body.</p><p>“Let that be a lesson to you, my dear Severus, that you are not the master here.”</p><p>Severus could do nothing but struggle to breathe, harsh and broken, sobs escaping every few seconds.</p><p>“Dismissed,” the Dark Lord said. “Get out of my sight, and find Potter. Do not kill her.”</p><p>Severus’ heart stilled. Oh Merlin, would he truly spare her?</p><p>The Dark Lord’s lip curled as he met Severus’ eyes. “That pleasure is mine alone.”</p><p>Both sides of Severus’ nature howled in anguish. Betrayed again, and he shouldn’t have even been surprised.</p><p>But he was. Merlin forgive him, he was.</p>
