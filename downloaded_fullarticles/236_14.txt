  <strong>Innocent All Along?</strong>
</p><p align="center">Four years ago, following the disaster of the Triwizard Tournament, Yuugi Motou (born Harry Potter) was exiled from the wizarding world. He was put through a full Wizengamot trial and found guilty of entering falsely, conspiracy and sabotage of the tournament to put others in the tournament at harm. Fleur Delacour was injured severely, Viktor Krum was confounded and also heavily injured, and Cedric Diggory was kidnapped and is still missing.</p><p align="center">Now, new evidence has come to light in both the case of the Triwizard Tournament. As you know, You-Know-Who has been revealed to have come back in the recent break in at the Ministry of Magic. He was also behind the Tournament's misdealings. Barty Crouch Jr. has been discovered as pretending to be Auror Moody and had put Yuugi Motou's name into the cup! He also planned with You-Know-Who and other unknown death eaters for the control of Barty Crouch Sr. and the recent break in at the Ministry of Magic, and breakout of Azkaban, amongst other things. The entrance of Yuugi Motou into the tournament was an attempt to capture and kill him!</p><p align="center">Innocent all along, and with a bounty on his head by the Death Eaters, he has been cast out of the wizarding world by a government too eager to have a scapegoat and not about finding the truth. There is already calls for his exoneration, and repayment for what he (and the other tournament participants) have been through. More on page five about the Triwizard Tournament and it's mishandling.<br/>
**********</p><p>"So, how are we going to deal with this, Dumbledore?" Remus Lupin sighs. His world had been an unhappy place for years, the loss of his pack, the discovery of his friend's son going missing and the hunt for him until he was almost eleven (and someone had the thought to follow an enchanted Hogwarts letter, you know, the easiest solution after seven years of looking), meeting the shy little thing and being filled with regret and painful memories, discovery that Sirius hadn't betrayed them but they betrayed him, being exposed as a werewolf to the world, and the exile of the boy because he made an excellent scapegoat.</p><p>Well. It was just a lot, isn't it.</p><p>Sirius, a few professors, the Weasleys and some others were overjoyed with the thought of bringing back an innocent martyr of the Ministry's crimes. But not Remus Lupin. Oh, no. He knew what it was like to be a stigmatized outcast. This will cause a problem, one way or another. Or many.</p><p>"Well, my boy. I have been pushing with the Ministry that a Hogwarts representative or two should be present when they explain to him, as he deserves another shot at a proper education, of course. I believe they shall agree, but it is mainly the Aurors who will be reaching out to the lad," Dumbledore replies.</p><p>"The Aurors! Why, by Merlin, is the Aurors greeting him?! If this is some sort of intimidation tactic-," Molly Weasley starts up with characteristic volume. But she's right. <em>Why the hell</em> is the dangerous criminal catchers involved in clearing a harmless innocent.</p><p>"Aurors! Dumbledore, we can't trust them!" Sirius cries, completely ignoring the number of Aurors in the Order, or just the room.</p><p>"Now, now, Molly, Sirius," Dumbledore quiets them, with the everknowing look only the truly elderly, and librarians can pull off. "The Aurors are involved to keep him safe. Scrimingor, for how much we may disagree with his current tactics, has seen what we have. Young Mutou has a target on his head. The problem is, the boy has no reason to trust the Aurors."</p><p>"Which is why Dumbledore is pushing for some of the professors! And luckily, with a bit of determination and hard work, Mad-eye and me will be involved. So the order is going to be watchin' his back, don't ya' worry Mrs. Weasley!" Tonks pipes in.</p><p>"Determination, hard-work, and reputation on my part, Tonks. You are involved because I recommended you," Moody corrects, grumbling. He hasn't been the same since they retrieved him from his own trunk after two and a half years. It took another year for him to completely recover physically. Mentally? Well. He's just madder then ever.</p><p>"If everyone is reassured with their lovely concerns, we could get back to the topic at hand?" Snape seethes.</p><p>"Yes, we should, my boy. Now. The Aurors, a Department of Justice official, and with luck, a couple of professors will go to Japan by portkey. The date and meeting location is soon and close, but is secret. For safety. The ministry is at least keeping this quiet even within itself. Good, because we know you-know-who has informants in the ministry," Dumbledore states.</p><p>No one mentions how all their eyes stray to their spy and informant, the bitterness extraordinaire. Snape's scowl deepens. Somehow.</p><p>"They have discovered a muggle gaming event of some kind that the lad will be at. They will enter the event and meet him, and attempt to get him out safely. The concern is that since his name was publicly listed for it, someone with less stellar motives might find him as well."</p><p>"A gaming event? Well, that's in character." Lupin says. He thinks of the small boy who was so in love with chess and exploding snap. It wasn't hard to get a chat with him, if you would wait through a game with the quiet hufflepuff. "What's the game called?"</p><p>"Why it's an American card game called Duel Monsters. But get this, originally it was called Monsters &amp; Magic. Humorous, no?"</p>
