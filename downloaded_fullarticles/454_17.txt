    <p>Chapter 1</p><p>The news had hit you like a truck. With just those seven words you felt everything around you stop, you couldn’t even breathe let alone speak. It was like all the sound around you washed out, replaced with the deafening hum of silence.</p><p>“It’s your parents…There’s been an accident”</p><p>-</p><p>Walking up the familiar stone steps to your childhood home you felt a bittersweet smile rise on your face. You recounted a simpler time as you studied the aging wood of the porch. What you wouldn’t give to just relive one of those days. To cherish it in a different way… at this moment it was all you desired.</p><p>Stepping into the house you couldn’t help but feel how overwhelming the emptiness was. It’s like the house knew it was empty… but how could it?</p><p>Fighting back the urge to cry for the millionth time you were greeted by the comforting sight of your younger brother. He was currently sat on the couch looking through an old family album. The look on his face as he eyed each photo told you all you needed to know. Growing up you weren’t that close, but it wasn’t as though you were on bad terms. The age difference just kept you apart most of the time. However, you knew that he wasn’t one to show when he was sad. At least other people wouldn’t recognize. But his intense gaze and silence told you everything.</p><p>“Hey,” you said coming to sit next to him, glancing at the album in his hands. This album, in particular, was of your family's trip to Ecuador. You smiled a little remembering how at the time you were particularly moody. It was a mixture of the fact that you were only 14(your early teen years were particularly angsty) and the fact that the humidity did hell to your hair.</p><p>“Hey” was all he replied with as he shut the album quickly, he wasn’t going to show you he was vulnerable… you knew it.</p><p>“So… I figured you could start packing up in the kitchen and I’ll start in the attic” you suggested, purposely giving him the kitchen as there weren’t too many tear-jerking memories in there.</p><p>He agreed with a silent nod of his head as he stood up and made his way into his designated room.</p><p>You watched him disappear around the corner and waited a few more moments before heading into the attic. You figured it wouldn’t be too hard since everything up there was already boxed away. You just had to go through those boxes and deem what was worth keeping really.</p><p>As you made your way up the worn-out pull downstairs you chuckled softly at the memory of how terrified you were of the attic as a child. You were convinced that there was some pale girl with long black hair living up there, a rational fear considering your early interest in Japanese horror movies.</p><p>As you stood in the dimly lit room you scanned the area calmly. Reaching up you pulled the cord to the uncovered lightbulb, the light coming in from the small window just wasn’t enough. The space lit up significantly more and you hummed in content as you set your eyes on the first box. It was unlabeled so you figured it was a good place to start.</p><p>Kneeling down and ripping the box open you were surprised to find that it was full of old Christmas decorations. Tinsel and ornaments shoved into the box completely unorganized, your dad definitely packed this one. Digging a little deeper your hands felt the soft texture of Christmas stockings. A smile grew on your face as you pulled them out. Both yours and your brothers were handmade by your mother and as you hold them in your hands you couldn’t stop the tears from streaming down your face again.</p><p>“Fuck” you rasped out while wiping away the tears harshly.</p><p>Mentally deciding that this box was an automatic keep you quickly refolded the top and moved it towards the entrance to the attic.</p><p>Turning back to the corner you started in you noticed a box with your name on it. You scrunched your face in confusion. Not because you didn’t have any boxes up here but because all the ones that you did were labeled in your mother's handwriting. She was notorious for taking charge when it came to packing and organization. So why would there be a box here labeled with your name… in your handwriting.</p><p>You carefully came to sit down beside it, pulling it between your legs.</p><p>You noticed that this box was tightly taped shut unlike most of the others. But you had brought a box cutter for just this circumstance. Pulling it from your back pocket you carefully began to open the box. Upon opening it you found the contents rather peculiar. It was full of random things you didn’t quite recognize right away. An old journal, a white envelope that appeared to be quite full, a worn looking hoodie, and a smaller brown box taped securely shut. The longer you studied it the more you became confused.</p><p>Picking up the journal you flipped it open to find the first entry to be a short story you had written years ago. Glancing at the date you finally pieced together what this box was. This was a box you sent back home from your summer in England with your grandparents. You were 18 at the time and fresh out of high school.  You remember begging your parents to let you spend the three months before college started with your grandparents in a new country. They had lived there all your life but the only time you saw them before that summer was when they came out to visit your family in the U.S. it was no secret that they were wealthy so their trips were actually quite frequent. However, that summer you insisted on being the one to visit.</p><p>It had been five years since that summer so naturally, you didn’t remember much but what you did remember was pleasant. The hoodie was something you were almost daily there as the weather was cloudier than you expected. The smaller box… you were unsure. Same with the envelope.</p><p>Deciding to focus on the envelope first you took it in your hands. Carefully ripping it open you peeked inside to discover that it was full of photos. That was… not what you were expecting.</p><p>Taking out the bunch you began to flip through them. They were all pictures of your summer in England. You smiled as you recounted the memories behind each one.</p><p>Some were of you posing in various places of their house obviously caught mid activity, a grin on your face. A few were of your grandparents, taken by you, smiling cheerfully. You continued to thumb through it. A few scenery shots, your grandparent’s adorable calico cat, and then you saw something you didn’t recognize.</p><p>It was a photo of you… and a boy.</p><p>This was someone you didn’t recognize. Not one memory came to light as you stared at the photo.</p><p>It was taken from a selfie angle, clearly, by you, you were smiling wide and he was smirking slightly as he looked at you and not the camera.</p><p>“What the hell” you whispered to yourself starting to grow a little scared at our inability to remember who this was.</p><p>You flipped to the next photo and felt your stomach turn.</p><p>There he was again.</p><p>In this photo though you noticed that you were both holding hands as you threw a peace sign up with your free hand. The strange boy beside you was giving a lopsided smile as his free hand stuck in his dress pant pocket. This photo was either taken with a timer or by someone else.</p><p>It was clear by looking at it that this boy, whoever he was, was more than a friend.</p><p>So how on earth could you not remember him? Nothing made sense and the more you stared at the photos the more your head began to hurt. Your vision blurred and it felt as though someone was squeezing your brain.</p><p>You winced as the pictures fell from your hand and back into the box.</p><p>What was happening?</p><p>Why was this happening?</p><p>You couldn’t make sense of anything.</p><p>The pain was becoming so unbearable that held your head and turned over into a fetal position, waiting for it to go away as silent tears streamed down your face.</p><p>-</p><p>When it seemed like the pain had faded completely you sat back up and peered at the box next to you. Deciding that it was best just to pack it back up and save the headache for later.</p><p>You really didn’t want to think about it anymore… not now.</p><p>Folding the box closed without much more thought you shoved it to the side by the other box at the entrance.</p><p>Eyeing it for only a second more you wiped away the last traces of wetness on your face before turning back to your corner of unopened boxes.</p><p>-</p><p>By the time you’d gone through the entire attic, you’d noticed that the sun was beginning to set. It had taken a while but you’d made great progress. You felt satisfied overall, all thoughts of the strange forgotten memories shoved to the very back of your mind.</p><p>Walking back down the stairs you headed to the living room where you were greeted by the tired-looking sight of your brother.</p><p>“Good place to stop for today, yeah?” you asked with a smile.</p><p>He only sighed before looking at you with a judging look.</p><p>“It took you the whole damn day to sort through the attic. Whereas I completed the kitchen, living room, and garage” he told you clearly unimpressed by your slow pace.</p><p>You only laughed in response before shrugging your shoulders.</p><p>“Don’t question my methods young one” you smiled before heading towards the door, you turned slightly to face him again 
"Say... can I ask you something?" the nervous tone to your voice shifting the mood immediately.</p><p>"Sure... go ahead?" he answered, very obviously confused at where this was going.</p><p>"Remember that summer I spent at Nana and Papa's five years ago?" you asked slowly.</p><p> He raised a curious brow before answering you as slowly as you had asked. "Yes, why?"</p><p>Here goes nothing, you thought.</p><p>"When I came back... do you remember me mentioning anybody? Someone that I may have met there? A boy maybe?" you asked, scared by your own words.</p><p> For a moment your brother said nothing as he stared at you with an expression of worry. He could tell that you were thinking about something unnerving and if his answer was what you feared you could see why it was all the more alarming.</p><p>"I don't... remember you bringing anyone up... is something going on?" he questioned taking a step closer.</p><p>The situation was seeming to become more serious by the second and for some reason you didn't want him to be involved. This was your mystery to solve. It wouldn't help any to have him worry. "Hmmm, It must have been a different trip then. You know me, I have too many boy toys to keep track of," you said with a grin while wiggling your eyebrows. you hoped that this effort of comedic relief would deter his curiosity.</p><p>He rolled his eyes at you dramatically before mumbling something about you being an ass. Well at least he wasn't suspicious anymore.</p><p>"Well I think we've done enough damage for today," you said with a chuckle while shuffling to the door. “same time tomorrow?” you asked.</p><p>He looked at you for a moment, seeming to think about something before visibly shaking it off. “You bet” he replied with a chuckle.</p><p>-</p><p>In the weeks that followed you and your brother successfully managed to sort through and move out the entire house. Taking the few boxes of your own belongs back to your separate places.</p><p>After the will reading, you attended a small and neatly organized funeral. Both of your parents were cremated as you knew that would be their wishes.</p><p>After everything was said and done your brother was on a plane back to his dorms across. Hopefully the few weeks away from college hadn’t hurt his grades too badly. Luckily for him, he was only a freshman. Without your parents help tuition would be harder but the football scholarship and small inheritance should help him. If need be you wouldn’t mind stepping in to help as well.</p><p>-</p><p>When you settled back into your apartment you eased onto your small sofa and begrudgingly looked at the small collection of boxes you’d brought back from your parents’ house. You knew you had to unpack and sort them soon or else they’d collect dust there forever.</p><p>You stood up and stretched as a yawn escaped your lips. Trudging over to the boxes you began to stack them according to where they should go in makeshift organization. As you did so you were once again faced with the five-year-old box full of mysteries.</p><p>You picked it up and set it onto your kitchen counter, eying it warily.</p><p>Against your better judgment, you opened it again slowly.</p><p>With timid fingers, you grabbed onto the two photos again. Still splayed out messily in the box where you dropped them.</p><p>Studying them once again you began to feel the aching in your head as you stared at the mystery boy’s face.</p><p>It seemed like the harder you tried to remember him the more your brain tried to stop you.</p><p>But why?</p><p>Nothing was making sense and you were afraid you were going to go crazy.</p><p>You knew you’d never find answers yourself… not when you couldn’t remember a thing.</p><p>There was only one place where you could possibly find the answers you were looking for, and thanks to the small fortune your parents left behind in their wills, it would be no skin off your back to make the expense.</p><p>-</p><p>You shouldn’t have felt as nervous as you were sat in your cramped airplane seat. But you couldn’t help but agonize over what you might find when you got to England. After all… if you didn’t know anything, would your grandparents?</p><p>You didn’t know the answer. But this was your best bet.</p><p>Besides, if all else fails… at least you’ll get a vacation away from everything going on back home. All the pain that seemed to have settled permanently into your life like a thick gray smog.</p><p>Maybe this could be your chance to breathe.</p><p>-</p><p>When the taxi stopped in front of your grandparent’s large house in Wiltshire, England you felt like there was a weight on your shoulders.</p><p>All the uncertainty was weighing on your mind in a way that you couldn’t even begin to comprehend.</p><p>Making your way up the long narrow path to the house you hadn’t seen in so many years felt partially surreal. The last time felt so long ago now that it hardly seemed real.</p><p>When you arrived at the door you gave it three hard knocks; knowing very well that your grandparents were quite hard of hearing at their old age.</p><p>You stood there at the doorstep rocking on your heels as you clutched onto your large duffle bag. Considering the visit was so last minute you didn’t really put much thought into what you brought with you. You weren’t even sure how long you were staying seeing as you just bought a one-way ticket there.</p><p>Just as you started to get lost in thought the door opened wide in front of you.</p><p>“Hello there, dear! Oh, how I’ve missed you! Please come in, come in.” your grandma beckoned you from the doorway, stepping aside to make room for you. “We were so happy to hear that you were coming”.</p><p>You walked in with a smile.</p><p>“Hi Nana, I’ve missed you too. Things have been well I take it?” you asked politely.</p><p>“We’ve been just swell. Although I suppose we can’t say the same for you… I’m so sorry we couldn’t make it to the funeral but it was just such short notice I hope you understand” she spoke to you softly as you saw her eyes water in sadness.</p><p>They may have been your parents but it was their daughter and son in law as well. The loss hit them in a way you probably couldn’t even begin to understand.</p><p>“I understand, Nana. Don’t worry, it was a small service anyway. Private… like they would’ve wanted” you said with a sad smile.</p><p>She simply nodded at you lightly with a forced smile on her face. She was being strong for your sake. The sorrow in her eyes gave it away clear as day.</p><p>As you walked through to the living room you couldn’t help but notice that even after five years barely anything had changed. It was almost refreshing to see them living just as they were before. Even down to the same four porcelain frog figurines lined neatly atop the fireplace mantel.</p><p>Something about the sight brought a warm feeling to your chest.</p><p>-</p><p>You had been sat on the all too familiar plastic-covered sofa when the smell of roasted chicken began to waft into the room.</p><p>You smiled, knowing that your grandpa made it just for you, he remembered that it was your favorite.</p><p>“Something smells good” you commented while walking into the kitchen.</p><p>“Ah, there you are dear. Go have a seat in the dining room, I’ll bring it out shortly” your grandpa replied with a toothy grin.</p><p>You headed into the dining room to find your grandma already sat at the table, intently reading over a rather hefty looking book.</p><p>Taking your seat in your usual place to her right you glanced at the title. It looked to be another Stephen King novel. They were her favorite after all.</p><p>You recalled that she owned all the books, gleefully purchasing each one as they were published. It was an interest that she’d passed down to your mother.</p><p>The thought was bittersweet now but it would be impossible to count all the times you’d caught your mother, nose deep in a Stephen King novel growing up. She loved them dearly and with an aching in your heart, you realized that she’d never be able to read a new one again.</p><p>“Dinner is served!” your grandfather exclaimed while strolling into the dining room with several plates of food all carefully laid out on a platter. Your painful thoughts were easily blown away as you chuckled at the sight. He looked like a personal chef rather than the owner of the house.</p><p>Eating with them again after so long felt nice. You’d of course seen them a few times in the five years after your visit but being here in their house felt different of course. It was so uniquely them that the feeling of it all couldn’t really be replicated any other way.</p><p>You talked about how they’d been doing, where they’ve traveled to lately, how their garden was coming along, and current events in England. It was always interesting to hear their take on things.</p><p>In turn, they, of course, asked you all about how your life was going as well. Asking about work and any potential male suitors (as family tends to do). You laughed with them as you recounted your last failed attempt at love which had lasted all of two months. The guy, to be blunt, was a real bum and you weren’t yet at the age where you felt like mothering something.</p><p>The topic of boyfriends being brought up started to get you thinking once again. About the thing, you were so desperately trying to figure out… the whole reason you had come here so abruptly, to begin with.</p><p>The boy in those photos… this is where you’d find the answers if there were any.</p><p>You decided that after dinner you would confront your grandmother about it casually. Hopefully, she could shed some well-needed light on the situation.</p><p>-</p><p>Once you heard the sink start to run in the kitchen you knew that now was the time to confront your grandma.</p><p>“Hey, Nana need any help with the dishes?” you asked while walking over with a smile, already pulling up your sleeves before she answered.</p><p>“Oh, how kind of you to offer. Of course, you can dry.” She said while gesturing to the neatly folded hand towel in the corner.</p><p>You picked it up and began to dry the freshly cleaned dinner plates; wondering how exactly you were going to casually ask about this mystery boy.</p><p>Well, better to go all-in than dance around the question, right?</p><p>“Say, Nana… when I was here five years ago, did I have any friends that you knew about?” you asked, too nervous to turn and face her.</p><p>She continued to scrub in silence and for a brief moment, you wondered if she’d heard you at all. But then she spoke.</p><p>“No, not that I can remember. You spent most of that summer in the house with us or out exploring around the property.” She said in a curious tone. “Why do you ask?”</p><p>Your stomach twisted in knots as you processed this information. Would no one be able to solve this mystery?</p><p>“No reason… it’s just been so long a few of my memories are a little fuzzy. I just thought if there had been someone it would be nice to say hello again.” You said quickly realizing that it wasn’t a very good excuse. “But, now that you mention it I really didn’t meet anybody huh? I was very to myself in those days”. You laughed, trying to brush it off.</p><p>You turned to her and saw that she was studying your face, clearly questioning something. But to your relief, she didn’t press it further.</p><p>-</p><p>That night as you lay in bed, pictures in hand you began to feel overly restless. What if this was a dead end after all? Would you just have to go back home as clueless as when you left?</p><p>The thought left a scowl on your face.</p><p>But that’s when you noticed it.</p><p>In the background of one of the photos.</p><p>There was a humongous house, dark and gloomy in appearance.</p><p>It didn’t look very welcoming and was barely visible in the background of the photo but to your amazement, you had seen this house before.</p><p>You were certain of it.</p><p>But where?</p><p>You didn’t have to think much longer before it came to you.</p><p>You had seen it in the cab on the way here. In fact, it was the last house before you reached your grandparents. Meaning that it was the neighbor…</p><p>Given how large each property was though, this didn’t mean the house was just a few feet away… but it wasn’t very far.</p><p>Glancing out the window you noticed how dark the sky had become, it was sure to be a little chilly as well. But how could you simply forget about it now… not when you finally had a lead.</p><p>Quickly throwing on of the few hoodies you had brought with you, you began to quietly make your way through the house. You knew very well that despite your age, you’d be scolded for sneaking around at this time of night.</p><p>When you safely made it outside the house with no detection you clutched the small photo in your hands as you began to walk in the direction that you came in the cab, knowing that it would lead you to your destination.</p><p>-</p><p>After walking for what felt like hours you finally saw the huge building come into full view. Rather than call it a house you would be inclined to say that it was actually a mansion.</p><p>Tall, dark, and looming. It stood surrounded by a vast property. Whoever lived here must be wealthy beyond your imagination that much was for sure.</p><p>As you stared at the house you brought the picture up in the air. Glancing from the image there to the one in front of you.</p><p>This was definitely the same place.</p><p>But now what?</p><p>You stared at the mansion, studying it closely. It was like you were completely transfixed and before you knew it there was that pain again.</p><p>Clutching your arms in an effort to redirect the pain you desperately glanced around. There was no one in sight, no one to see you like this. That was a relief.</p><p>Looking back at the picture you saw a flash of something in your mind.</p><p>A single white rose.</p><p>Your brain felt like it was in agony. Desperately trying to keep you out. But you focused on it harder.</p><p>Then came another flash.</p><p>A small brown box with beautiful carvings of flowers and swirls decorated all around it.</p><p>More pain.</p><p>You fell to your knees as the world around you began to blur. No sound could be heard except an ear-piercing buzz that ripped through you like a bullet.</p><p>Then you saw something else.</p><p>It was a stick of some kind… held in a pale hand. Pointed right at you. The person holding it was completely blurred in your memory. But the object was crystal clear.</p><p>But what was it?</p><p>The three images flashed through your mind continuously, each time they did so the pain grew worse and before you could even feel it coming… you collapsed completely.</p><p>Everything around you going pitch black as you lay on the cold wet ground.</p>
