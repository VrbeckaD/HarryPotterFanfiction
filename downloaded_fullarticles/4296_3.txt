    <strong>Chapter One: A Plan Is Formed</strong>
  </u>
</p>
<p>‘Severus, may I have a moment?’</p>
<p>Severus Snape, Potion Master of Hogwarts, turned to face the person who’d spoken. ‘Of course, Headmaster, what can I do for you?’ he asked politely. Though it was clear that he didn’t want to be disturbed at the moment, Severus never could refuse a request from Albus Dumbledore. The man was like a father to him, the old wizard had saved his life and his reputation more times than Severus cared to remember.</p>
<p>‘If you would meet me in my office after your next class, there is something I need to discuss with you,’ Albus smiled.</p>
<p>‘Very well,’ Severus said with a slight nod, and then glared at the man who’d been standing next to Albus, ‘though I hope you will <em>not</em> be there.’</p>
<p>‘I’m afraid I will, Snape. Deal with it,’ Sirius said sweetly.</p>
<p>Severus eyes narrowed in suspicion, anything that involved Black was bound to be something that he wanted nothing to do with. ‘I see. Well then, my apologies, Headmaster, but it seems I already have plans for the rest of the day. Whatever it is you want, you shall have to do it without me.’</p>
<p>‘I think not, Severus. You will be in my office after your class is finished, is that understood?’ Albus said in a tone that suggested to do otherwise would not be a very good idea.</p>
<p>Severus scowled. ‘Very well, I shall be there, you have my word,’ he said in a clipped voice. ‘Now if you would pardon me, I have students waiting.’</p>
<p>Before either of the two men could respond Severus turned on his heel and walked off, his eyes blazing with anger. Once more Black had brought him down to a level of reprimands and taunts, and Severus was growing damned tired of it. Ever since Black had been cleared of all charges two years ago Severus’s life had been turned upside down. Knowing the man was innocent, which was thanks to an anonymous tip-off on where and how to capture Voldemort’s right hand man Peter Pettigrew, only served to heighten the resentments he held against the dog animagus. The worst of it was that for the past several years that he’d been forced to work with Black in the quest to defeat the Dark Lord it had turned into years of disappointments, irritations, and defeats which he was fully blaming on Black, if nothing else just because the man existed.</p>
<p>Severus walked into his classroom and barked out, ‘Finish up Wednesday’s assignment. If I so much as here a peep out of any of you it will be house points along with detention!’</p>
<p>‘Err ... Professor Snape, Sir?’ a seventh-year Slytherin piped up hesitantly.</p>
<p>Severus turned and glared at the child. ‘What is it, Malfoy?’</p>
<p>‘I already finished Wednesday’s assignment. Is there anything else I can do?’ Draco asked.</p>
<p>Severus mumbled a few choice words under his breath; trust the boy to already have his assignment finished. ‘Very well, since you are obviously smarter than these other dunderheads, go help Potter finish his pathetic looking potion.’</p>
<p>‘Help … Potter … Sir?’ Draco asked in shock.</p>
<p>‘Do you have a hearing problem, Mr Malfoy?’ Severus drawled. ‘Since you are competent enough to have finished this highly complex potion on your own, helping someone else should clearly not be an issue.’</p>
<p>‘Why can’t Granger do it?’ Draco asked sullenly.</p>
<p>‘As I would prefer to keep this classroom in one piece today, Granger needs to keep her eye on Longbottom before he decides to blow everything up as usual. Now stop questioning me, boy, and do as I say!’ Severus said coldly, his glare boring holes into the seventh-year.</p>
<p>Thankfully Draco knew better than to respond further so he quickly gathered his things and took himself to Potter’s workstation. Severus went over and sat down at his desk whilst attempting to occupy his thoughts on anything other than the upcoming meeting with Black and Albus. Unfortunately the more he thought about it, the more agitated he became.</p>
<p>‘That man isn’t anything but a selfish, stubborn, oafish, asinine prat! He takes away everything and everyone that is important to me. Damn you, Black for existing!’ Severus said angrily.</p>
<p>He winced when he realised he had spoken out loud. Looking up quickly it appeared that no one had overheard his words, however as his gaze settled on a particular workstation he paled. The two boys at that station were looking at him in confusion and shock amongst other things.</p>
<p>‘<em><strong>POTTER</strong></em>! <em><strong>MALFOY</strong></em>!’ Severus bellowed, ‘Twenty points off Gryffindor and Slytherin, as well as detention. Both of you report here tonight!’</p>
<p>‘What? Why?’ Harry asked resentfully. ‘We didn’t do anything!’</p>
<p>‘You took attention off your potion, that’s why, Potter. Now keep your eyes ... and ears ... on your work, and <em>only</em> your work!’ Severus said icily.</p>
<p>Neither Harry nor Draco decided to respond for which Severus was grateful, and to his relief (more like his dismay) the rest of the class passed all too quickly. As everyone was leaving he called out, ‘Potter, Malfoy, tonight, ten o’clock. Be here or you will regret it!’</p>
<p>Severus didn’t expect an answer, though the looks on the two boys’ faces spoke volumes. For a moment he felt somewhat guilty for giving the boys detention, but there was little he could do about it now. He had to play his roles being what he was, which in turn brought his thoughts back to Albus and he couldn’t help but wonder what could be so important that Black was here at the school. Last he had heard Black and Lupin were supposed to be allying the werewolves of some country or other to join the fight against Voldemort. If Black was here though, then it stood to reason that Lupin …</p>
<p>*Don’t even think about it* his inner voice chided. He shook his head and focused back on his task. His inner voice was right, to think further would only serve to dredge up memories that Severus did not want to remember right now. With a heavy sigh he made his way to Albus’s office as promised, though seeing Black again only made his mood worse than it already was.</p>
<p>‘All right, Albus, let’s get this over with,’ he said impatiently, his gaze settling on the cause of his misery.</p>
<p>‘Ever the cheerful one, eh Snape?’ Sirius said mockingly.</p>
<p>‘I wasn’t asking for your opinion of me, Black,’ Severus replied coldly. ‘What do you want?’</p>
<p>‘You being handcuffed to a Dementor, that’s what I want,’ Sirius taunted.</p>
<p>‘You would know all about Dementors, now wouldn’t you. You certainly spent enough time with them,’ Severus sneered. ‘I’m surprised you still have a soul left considering things.’</p>
<p>‘Well you … you …’ Sirius began angrily, but a look from Albus forced him to keep his next words in check. ‘Whatever, let’s just get this over with. The faster I get away from you the better.’</p>
<p>‘For once I agree with you, not that I would ever wish to do so again. Tell me what it is you want, Albus, so I may rid myself of his irritating presence,’ Severus said, his gaze now settling on the older wizard.</p>
<p>‘Ah, it does this old wizard good to see the two of you talking instead of throwing hexes at each other,’ Albus smiled.</p>
<p>‘I would hardly call this “talking,”’ Sirius said gruffly. ‘Besides, he wouldn’t know the fine art of conversation if it bit him on the nose, though how it could miss such a thing is beyond me.’</p>
<p>‘You leave my nose out of this you lazy, half-brained, good-for-nothing mutt!’ Severus hissed.</p>
<p>‘That’s hard to do when it’s just so incredibly large, Snape! Even with a mask on you could peg that thing a kilometre off,’ Sirius shot back.</p>
<p>‘I believe his nose is more aquiline than large,’ Albus joked. ‘Now then, let us stop this bickering, and settle down to business shall we?’</p>
<p>‘As soon as this idiotic mutt stops his annoying Cheltenham dramatics, I will be more than happy to settle down,’ Severus said glaring at Sirius.</p>
<p>‘What the hell is Chelt … er … Chalk … dramatics?’ Sirius asked.</p>
<p>‘It has to do with Muggle theatre, Black, something which it is painfully obvious you know nothing about,’ Severus said.</p>
<p>‘That’s not true. Remus tells me things about the theatre all the time. He even brings home those little books for me to read,’ Sirius replied defensively.</p>
<p>‘Those “books” as you call them are playbills, you moronic fool,’ Severus said, his mind finally registering what Black had said. ‘Lupin is interested in the theatre?’ he asked curiously.</p>
<p>‘Ah, playbills, yeah that’s what they’re called,’ Sirius nodded, ‘and not that it’s really any of your business, but Remus isn’t just interested in the theatre, he practically worships it. He joined a local acting troupe a few years ago, just after he left here in fact.’</p>
<p>‘He actually does real acting?’ Severus asked in astonishment.</p>
<p>‘Is there such a thing as fake acting?’ Sirius said rolling his eyes. ‘Yes he does “real” acting, although hasn’t lately because of doing Order business. The last play he did was a year ago, I believe it was called Oliver. Of course he had to take off a few days for … well you know, but that’s what having an underscore is for I reckon.’</p>
<p>‘That’s understudy, you nitwit. You really are terrible with this sort of thing, aren’t you,’ Severus muttered.</p>
<p>‘It’s not like I need to know about the theatre, Snape. I only attend the plays, not act in them,’ Sirius shrugged. ‘Now can we get a move on with what we have to discuss? I have to meet someone in an hour about a motorbike.’</p>
<p>‘Oh good gracious,’ Severus groaned. ‘You are not planning to make another one of those damnable flying contraptions are you?’</p>
<p>Sirius grinned. ‘Right you are, Sev, and this time he’ll be better than ever once I get done with him.’</p>
<p>‘First of all, do not call me that again. <strong>EVER</strong>. I am not your friend and I am definitely am not your lover, therefore you do not have the right to call me by such an intimate name. Second of all, it is an inanimate object, Black, not a man,’ Severus said coldly.</p>
<p>Sirius chuckled. ‘Ah, Snape, you just don’t know the finer aspects of life. A man and his machine are rarely parted.’</p>
<p>‘If that is true then by all means please build this blasted annoyance so that “he” can take you out of my hair,’ Severus replied.</p>
<p>‘And such lovely hair it is too. Do I detect that you may have even washed it? Seeing as how it’s missing some of its usual greasiness, I assume that you must have washed it at least within … oh I’d say the last month … at least,’ Sirius quipped.</p>
<p>‘Oh yes, very funny, Black. You’re wit is purely astounding today,’ Severus retorted. ‘Now for all that is holy, what is it you want already?’</p>
<p>Sirius studied Severus closely, a worried look now in his eyes. ‘All right, it’s ... it’s about Remus. Well, more to the point ... it’s about his potion.’</p>
<p>Severus raised his eyebrow in surprise. ‘What about it?’ he drawled.</p>
<p>‘Oh hell, how to put this...’ Sirius began hesitantly.</p>
<p>‘Oh for the sake of … just say whatever it is you need to say, Black. I do not have the time or patience to sit here all day whilst you hem and haw over yourself,’ Severus snapped.</p>
<p>‘Fine,’ Sirius said in a huff, ‘what it boils down to is simple. Remus finds himself short of funds this month, and because of it he can’t buy his Wolfsbane Potion from his usual supplier.’</p>
<p>‘And this is supposed to interest me because ...?’ Severus asked coolly, though suddenly his pulse quickened and he found himself eagerly awaiting Black’s next words.</p>
<p>‘You are an impossible git, you know that?’ Sirius muttered. ‘The bottom line is Remus needs your help. Because of what you did to him he’s more prideful than ever, even when we were kids he wasn’t this bad. He refuses to let me buy the potion for him so now he’s in a rut. The fact is, as distasteful as this no doubt will be to both of us, he would rather beg for your mercy than accept money from me,’ Sirius said with a drawn out sigh.</p>
<p>‘I see,’ Severus said sitting back in his chair to contemplate this turn of events. ‘So you are telling me that he would rather have the help of the large-nosed, greasy-haired git Slytherin Potion’s Master instead of accepting help from his lover. Irony at its best I would think.’</p>
<p>‘L-lover?’ Sirius sputtered and stared at Severus as if he’d just been told he’d won a billion Galleons. ‘What makes you think that Remus and I are ... err ... l-lovers?’ he stammered.</p>
<p>‘Lupin’s flat has only one bedroom if I recall, and I would wager that you have not been sleeping on that tiny sofa of his,’ Severus said dryly.</p>
<p>‘Hold up, how do you know what Remy’s flat looks like?’ Sirius asked suspiciously.</p>
<p>Severus paled slightly, angry with himself for giving away such valuable information. ‘I ... err ... that is … I only know because I had to bring him a package some time ago, long before you moved in with him,’ he replied hastily. There was no way in hell he was going to admit to Sirius the real reason why he had gone to Remus’s flat, not if he wanted to remain hex and lecture free in the next ten seconds.</p>
<p>‘If you did anything to him, if you had hurt him in any way whilst you were there, and I find out about it, you’re in major trouble, Snape,’ Sirius said threateningly.</p>
<p>Severus wanted to laugh at that comment. ‘Believe me, I was the one who emerged from Lupin’s flat with the wear and tear, Black,’ Severus said coldly, though his body was suddenly anything but cold as he remembered that particular night, and the morning that had followed.</p>
<p>‘Good to know Remus put up a fight,’ Sirius said in obvious relief.</p>
<p><em>*Oh, he put up a damn good fight all right, just not in the way you might think*</em> Severus’s inner voice smirked. The next time he had seen Lupin was right after Black had moved into his flat and the two men had had a bitter row over several things, including the dog animagus, which is why not a word had exchanged between them since. Not that Severus hadn’t thought about the werewolf over the years, he certainly had, but he found it was best not to delve too deeply into such thoughts or risk losing a part of his sanity he was not willing to give up.</p>
<p>‘The moon is only a week away, you’re cutting this request rather close don’t you think?’ Severus asked as he re-focused his thoughts.</p>
<p>‘I would have done this sooner but I was trying to convince Remus to go with any other alternatives. Since he won’t budge sadly, you’re it. I’m only here to bring back enough doses to last Remus through the week, and to see my Godson of course,’ Sirius said.</p>
<p>Severus thought carefully, a plan brewing in his mind. ‘No,’ he said after a few minutes of silence.</p>
<p>‘No? No to what?’ Sirius asked.</p>
<p>‘No, I will not give you the potion,’ Severus said slowly.</p>
<p>‘I don’t believe this … you owe him, Snape, you know you do! It’s because of you that Remus suffers as he does! If you hadn’t revealed what he was he could have had a decent life for the first time in his life, but no … you just couldn’t handle that, could you, you miserable excuse for a human being! You all but kicked him out, you publicly scorned and humiliated him, and for what? So you could feel like a big shot? Did it -’ Sirius began but a loud bang stopped his next words.</p>
<p>‘That is enough!’ Albus said warningly, his fist balled up on his desk. ‘I will not have this sort of talk, especially when you know full well what Severus does for this school and for the Order. I trust him, Sirius, and whatever his reasons were behind what happened they are his to deal with.’</p>
<p>‘No, Albus, he is right,’ Severus said quietly. ‘Because of my own pettiness and hatreds I destroyed Lupin’s life even though I knew he didn’t deserve such treatment. I admit that it is one of my many regrets.’</p>
<p>Sirius was taken aback, that was the last thing he thought he would ever hear from the cold-hearted man he knew. ‘Then ... then why won’t you give Remus his potion?’</p>
<p>‘I never said I wouldn’t,’ Severus replied.</p>
<p>‘Yes you did, you just said so,’ Sirius argued.</p>
<p>Severus shook his head. ‘You don’t listen very well, Black. I said I wouldn’t give it to <em>you</em>, I never said I wouldn’t give it to <em>him</em>.’</p>
<p>‘You’re not making sense. What game are you playing at, Snape?’ Sirius demanded.</p>
<p>Severus started at those words. <em>*A game ... of course ... that’s it!*</em> Focusing his gaze on Sirius he said, ‘Tell Lupin if he wants his potion he is to be here by nightfall, it will be ready for him.’</p>
<p>‘Wait … what? You want him to come here? Why?’ Sirius asked in surprise.</p>
<p>‘I have not made that particular potion since Lupin left therefore I wish to supervise in case of any reactions, and of course, to make sure he does indeed take it,’ Severus said.</p>
<p>Sirius snorted. ‘Much as I hate to say this, I can’t see you of all people mucking up a potion, Snape. Besides, you know perfectly well Remus won’t step within a hundred yards of the school during a full moon.’</p>
<p>‘That’s a pity, because it is the only way I will help him,’ Severus replied.</p>
<p>‘Why are you being such a bastard about this huh? You know how Remus feels about endangering people’s lives!’ Sirius said angrily.</p>
<p>‘If he has so little faith in my potion then why is he bothering me for it in the first place?’ Severus retorted. ‘Either he can accept your money and go elsewhere or he goes without, his choice. And since he seems quite adamant about not doing either, he <em>will</em> be here.’</p>
<p>‘And where do you suggest we stay?’ Sirius asked. ‘The Three Broomsticks is full up, I know that for fact.’</p>
<p>‘I assume Albus will have no problem putting you up here at the castle. After all it’s only one room that you both need,’ Severus said emotionlessly.</p>
<p>‘Severus is correct, I can easily put the two of you into one of the guest rooms,’ Albus agreed.</p>
<p>‘Don’t encourage the git, Albus!’ Sirius muttered. ‘Remus isn’t going to be happy about this. He swore never to come here when there were students in residence.’</p>
<p>‘That isn’t my problem,’ Severus shrugged and headed to the door, then turned back to look at Black carefully. ‘I’ll expect him in my office by the end of supper. If he’s not here by then a cauldron full of Wolfsbane will go to waste.’</p>
<p>‘Fine, fine, long as he gets his potion, I don’t care,’ Sirius said in aggravation. ‘Since you’re clearly an expert in manipulating people to get what you want, Snape, tell me how the hell I do I convince Remus to come here?’</p>
<p><em>*I don’t always get my way, Black, but this time I intend to. You’ve been a thorn in my life for far too long, but all good things come to those who wait, and I’ve waited patiently for a very long time ...*</em> Severus’s inner voice said, though out-loud he merely replied, ‘tell him that his presence is required for … other … reasons, besides just the potion.’</p>
<p>‘And what reasons would that be?’ Sirius asked suspiciously.</p>
<p>‘Tell him that I am a protagonist short for an idyllic, well-produced scene. If he enjoys the theatre as much you say he will understand what I require,’ Severus said with a slight grin, then before Sirius or Albus could respond he left the office, closing the door behind him.</p>
<p>As Severus made his way back to his quarters his mind was racing with possibilities. If all went well, and he hoped things would, he’d need to hurry; the Wolfsbane needed several hours to be made properly. If Lupin did indeed get the hint he would know exactly which play the quote had come from, and hopefully the man’s interest would be peeked enough to show up. After that it would simply be a matter of timing, creating the right mood, and setting the stage ... a stage that Severus had every intention of monopolising, both now and in the future.</p>
