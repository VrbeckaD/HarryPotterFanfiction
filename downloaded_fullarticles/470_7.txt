    <p>Hermione waved to her parents, then turned resolutely towards the brick wall.  Neville had walked up to it, nervous as anything, though she couldn't imagine why -- and promptly disappeared.  She expected to do the same, and she did.  When she turned around and her parents were gone, though, she felt very strange, sad, and lost.  Magic was truly her calling, and Hogwarts was a wonderful school -- but there was only brick behind her, where Mum and Dad had been moments ago.  Why did she have to leave her family for a different world to study?</p><p>"Come along, child," said Mrs. Longbottom, quite firmly.  Hermione gritted her teeth and hurried after the older woman.  She would have liked to walk back through, just for a moment, a last hug and kiss and promise to write, but Mrs. Longbottom was already weaving through the crowd.  Neville was caught in her elbow like another piece of baggage.  The train was huffing loudly on the track, so Hermione set her chin and stepped aboard.</p><p>She hadn't attended an actual school since the Vector Addition incident, long ago in her very first term, but she was determined to do well at Hogwarts.  It was a <i>magical</i> school, and the other children (and the faculty! and the staff!) would be witches, just as Hermione was herself.  She had done her best to study in advance -- the first-year texts were not difficult; she had committed them to memory and practiced a little -- but meeting Neville and his grandmother had still been unnerving.  So many things they took for granted weren't anywhere in the books -- from owl post and having a toad to the bizarre assortment of food on the snacks cart.  The magical world was like a foreign country.  She told herself severely to be brave; her father had immigrated to England, and he assured her he was very much at home there.  But he wasn't here to ruffle her hair and jolly her now, and the countryside outside the window had gone rural and unfamiliar.  She had squeezed herself into the corner to look at the window, and was trying not to cry again when she noticed that Neville actually was crying, and she turned to face him.  "What's wrong?"</p><p>"It's Trevor," said Neville, hopelessly, "I've lost him again.  Already.  Uncle Algie is going to be..."</p><p>That seemed like an easy enough problem to solve.  "You had him when you got on the train, didn't you?"  Neville nodded.  "Well, then he's probably still aboard. I know two charms for lost things," Hermione mused aloud, "and I've got powdered toad's-foot in my pack --"  Neville's chin trembled, and Hermione stopped.  She could tell she was making things worse, although she had no idea why.  They stared at each other for a moment.</p><p>"Could we just, umm, look?" asked Neville.</p><p>"Of course," said Hermione, though truly wouldn't the charm would be simpler?  But Neville seemed so relieved just because she had agreed that she simply stood up, leaving her pack beneath her seat.  "Let's go."</p>
