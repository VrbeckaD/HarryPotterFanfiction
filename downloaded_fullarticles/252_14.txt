    <p>Dudley sighs and stares out the window, watching the trees pass by as  the car drives. Now that the chaos going on around him has died down, the shock and grief has began to set in. His mother is gone. The only person he loved and cared for, his only true friend is gone. No more nightly cuddles he pretended to despise, no more good morning pecks and after breakfast sweets, no more sneaky meetings to give him treats at school disguised as progress checkups, no more warmth, no more her. She is gone and she took a big piece of his heart with her, leaving an empty void that will never be filled. And standing in a house that once was graced with her presence felt wrong; it felt like a sin. He wanted to run as far away from the house as he could and the man sitting next to him offered the only reasonable alternative. Oh, it’s a good offer, great even. He is going to live in a mansion and have servants at his beck and bay. He will be even more spoilt than he was in Privet Drive, he knows that. And maybe if the offer had presented itself before this tragic time, Dudley would have more than readily packed his bags. But now, it is less than important. He just wants to run away from the house that was drinking his soul with every breath he took. There were too many beautifully painful memories in that house to peacefully live in it.</p><p>“Dudley,” the man he has come to know as Marcus calls out to him.</p><p>He breaks Dudley from his reverie. He blinks and looks up. They are at a front of a mansion. He took a deep breath. This is going to be his home. Forever.</p>
