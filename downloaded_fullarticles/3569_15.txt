    <p>
  <span>Harry Potter was waiting. Waiting had, admittedly, never been one of her strong suits, though it felt as if it was all she did these days. She dug her sneakers into the dirt, marring it. It had been a dry summer, long and hot and lonely, and the clay of the earth cracked under her foot. She stamped it out.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Voldemort had been quiet for the last several months, unnervingly so. At the start of the summer, Harry had even taken to reading the </span>
  <em>
    <span>Prophet, </span>
  </em>
  <span>an endeavor which she had known would surely lead to madness, but there had been nothing, just the scramble of the Ministry as they realized what she’d known for a year and a half: there was a madman loose among them. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Fear was spreading across the wizarding world. The same fear that had lived inside her since that night in the graveyard, since that thing, that sick, revolting, half-formed monster of a man, had risen from the cauldron. It was almost validating.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And yet, somehow, despite it all, Harry had simply spent the summer back at Privet Drive, working in a shop down the way, trying to pretend that things were not what they were, and she’d found that if she really tried, all of it, Voldemort and Sirius and the war, the relentless fear of the war, felt like a dream, removed from real life. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>And now, months later, Dumbledore was coming for her. Or so he’d said. She hadn’t seen him, not since she’d raged in his office, not since he’d looked at her with sad eyes and said, “You feel as though you will bleed to death with the pain of it.” But then two weeks ago, he’d sent her a note telling her he would be coming for her. It had felt unreal. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>And so it was the appointed time and Harry was walking the streets of Little Whinging. She’d walked this route a lot this summer for lack of anything better to do. She finished the loop and started back down Privet. It was dinner time and Harry could hear, through the open windows, the sounds of families having dinner, the raucous laughter, the hum of the television screens, the bang of pots. It made her chest ache, a dull, never-ending thud, thud.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore was standing in the center of the living room of 4 Privet Drive. Harry didn’t think she’d ever seen someone so out of place. The brightness of his suit against Petunia’s rose wallpaper, the glint of his spectacles in the lamp light, the way that Petunia and Vernon skirted around him as if he were a particularly repugnant rodent. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Harry,” he said, in greeting. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sir.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I presume you did not tell your relatives that I would be coming for you,” he said, pleasantly. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Er, no,” Harry said. “I guess I should go pack my trunk, then.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“See that you do,” he said. “Petunia here was just about to tell me about her rutabagas, weren’t you, my dear?.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Petunia looked as if she would rather do anything but. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry took the stairs two at a time, frantically gathering her things: a Weasley sweater tossed in with her Transfiguration textbook, a cauldron, a pair of socks, a bundle of letters, unanswered, from Ron and Hermione. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Within minutes, her room at Privet Drive was stripped bare and she was pulling her trunk down the steps. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>When she returned to the living room, she saw that everything was as she’d left it: Petunia, standing horrified in the corner, Vernon, almost sputtering with rage, and Dumbledore, calmer than seemed polite in the situation, drinking from a mug of tea. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ah, Harry,” Dumbledore said. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ready to go, sir?” she asked. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If you’ll sit,” he said. “There are a couple of things that I wish to discuss with you and your relatives.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry took a seat. The Dursley’s remained standing. Dumbledore set down his mug.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“As you no doubt know,” Dumbledore said. “The wizarding world is in a state of war.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“War?” Vernon asked, puffing out his chest. Vernon’s father had been in service and he seemed to feel as if that entitled him to a claim on the military, war or both. “War with who?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>If Dumbledore was surprised that Harry had not shared the details of the Wizarding World with her family, he didn’t show it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“A man who goes by the name of Lord Voldemort,” he said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The color drained from Petunia’s face.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s the man who…,” killed my parents, Harry thought. “But I thought he was dead,” she said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ah,” Dumbledore said. “For men like Voldemort the space between dead and alive is rather more complicated than all that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>To put it simply, once there had been a boy named Tom Riddle and once there had been a soul, split eight ways. But of course, things are never simple, are they?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Voldemort leaned back in his chair, studying the fireplace, the play of light and dark, the crackle of flames. The whiskey burned on the way down, curling in his stomach, but it didn’t warm him. No, Voldemort couldn’t remember the last time he felt warm.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>An insidious whisper,</span>
  <em>
    <span> it takes a monstrous act to split a soul, didn’t you know? </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>He did not often think of his time in between, the empty stretch of it. Death was something to be feared, after all. He had been right in that aspect, at least. But he’d learned something else in the darkness. A soul split eight ways was a soul full of longing. It wanted to be complete, you see. Men were never meant to be gods. Men were never meant to be immortal. Tom Riddle had not known this. But Voldemort did. His sin had been hubris, and this, this mutation of form, this half-formed creature he had become, was the gods revenge. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Now, he watched the flames. Now, he planned his reawakening. Now, he felt the stretch of his consciousness, pressed too thin, and, always lingering, like an afterthought, a ghost in his periphery, he felt her: </span>
  <em>
    <span>Harry Potter</span>
  </em>
  <span>.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Where are we going, sir?” Harry asked. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Just a brief stop with an old friend,” Dumbledore said. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He’d sent her trunk on ahead to the Burrow and so she walked unencumbered down the street. It was an unfamiliar neighborhood, well-off, by the looks of it, but suburban. It was late, and the houses were dark and spooky in the dim lamplight.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sorry, sir, but what exactly am I doing here?” she asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, I’ll find a use for you,” he said. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They walked in silence down the street.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Er, sir,” Harry said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, Harry,” Dumbledore said. It was strange, Harry thought, to see him outside of school. She would have felt better with a desk between them. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is there something wrong with you hand, sir?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Dumbledore raised his hand as if in surprise. It really was a ghastly sight, black and rotting. “Nothing to worry about, my dear. I wish to talk about you. Now tell me,” he said, peering at her over his spectacles.”Has your scar been bothering you at all?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She shook her head. “It’s been quiet all summer. The dreams too.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Dumbledore considered her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I would have thought, with him being back, it would have been worse,” she said. “But instead, there’s nothing.” She could still feel the bond, but it felt empty.“It feels like he’s, I don’t know, like he’s hiding from me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It wouldn’t surprise me,” Dumbledore said, after a long moment, where he simply looked at her. Harry shifted her feet. “It’s far past time that he stopped underestimating you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Me?” Harry asked. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Indeed,” Dumbledore said. They had come to a gate, and he held it open for her. “After you, my dear.”</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>What does Voldemort have to fear from me? </span>
  </em>
  <span>Harry thought. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Tell me the news is good.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rufus Scrimgeour had been Prime Minister for less than a month and he already felt as if he had aged twenty years. He had been a young man in the first war, but he was no longer as young as he had once been.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I would, sir, but--” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But there’s nothing,” Scrimgeour finished for him. Kingsley nodded. “And you’ve been in contact with the Muggle Prime Minister?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, sir. She doesn’t believe the attacks on Muggle London are related to magic, but then she wouldn’t, would she?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, I suppose not,” Scrimgeour said. “Do we have any evidence that it’s Him?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not yet, sir.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Keep digging, Kingsley, he can’t stay hidden forever.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sir.” And then Kingsley was gone, leaving Scrimgeour alone. He poured himself a finger of firewhiskey and then, considering the glass, another.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It had been three months since the attack on the ministry, three months of chaos. And yet, for all that, for all the panic and the pandemonium, there was very little to show for it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>People were frightened, yes, and they had reason to be, Scrimgeour knew the man, Lord Voldemort. But it was the anticipation of violence more than any actual act that was causing chaos. Scrimgeour had been hunting Dark Wizards all his life, he knew how to fight, how to win, it was the waiting that unnerved him. He was not a patient man.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And this, he sensed, was only the beginning. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“How have you been, Horace?” Dumbledore asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The other man, plump and red faced, had barely taken his eyes off of Harry since she had come into the house. Harry tucked a piece of hair behind her ear self-consciously. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, well you know,” Slughorn said. “This dreadful war, it’s gotten everyone quite stirred up.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Dumbledore’s eyes were knowing. “It has,” he agreed. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ve been on the run,” Slughorn said. “Never staying in the same place for long, always afraid, it feels like, well, it feels like seventeen years ago. And I’m not as young as I once was, Dumbledore.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, nor am I,” Dumbledore said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry still had no clue what she was doing there.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If you were, perhaps, to return to Hogwarts…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not this again,” Slughorn protested. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Perhaps it would ease some of the stress,” he said. “I’m simply asking you to consider it, Horace.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ah, well, Dumbledore, you know, I don’t really think -- are you leaving already?” Dumbledore had stood up. Harry wondered if she was supposed to as well. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Simply wondering if I might use your bathroom.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, well, I suppose so. Down the hall and to the left.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was quiet for a moment. Harry felt Slughorn’s eyes upon her. She didn’t like him looking at her, and she shifted, uncomfortable. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You look very like your mother,” Slughorn said. Harry had heard this enough that she supposed it must be true, though she didn’t really see the resemblance between her and the pictures she had of her mother. Her mother was beautiful, and she, she was just Harry.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You aren’t supposed to have favorites as a teacher, you know, but she was one of mine. Incredible potions maker, and a great woman too. I used to tell her she should have been in my house, you know.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And which house is that?” Harry asked. It seemed unfair that Slughorn should know her mother when Harry herself did not. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I was Head of Slytherin,” he said, and seeing Harry’s face, he laughed. “Oh, but don’t you hold it against me. We’re not all bad, you know? I had some very impressive witches and wizards in my day. I suppose you’re in Gryffindor?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry nodded. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“A shame,” he said. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry hummed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You mustn’t misunderstand, Harry,” Slughorn said. “It’s not that I don’t want to take a position at Hogwarts, it’s just that in the current climate, with things being as they are, I don’t think it’s the best idea.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Right,” Harry said. “Sure.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s just aligning myself with the Order of the Phoenix--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Against Voldemort, you mean,” Harry said, turning her gaze back to the man. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Slughorn looked uncomfortable at the name. “Well,” he says. “Of course I’m not in support of Him, but you never know--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Harry said. “I suppose you really don’t.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The halls of Hogwarts were nearly empty, the ancient building quiet and still. Only the portraits were awake. Voldemort ran his hand along the banister, felt the familiar, worn stone. He had not been here for years, not since Dumbledore had refused him the defence job and he’d left the diadem in the first place. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He had almost forgotten how many memories were housed here. There, in the corner, Tom Riddle at eleven, young and awe stricken. How wondrous it all had seemed to him, how improbably delightful.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Soon, he knew, Harry Potter would be back here, walking these same halls. He could almost see her, feel the flicker of her presence, almost as familiar to him as his own. He wondered if she loved it as he did, the cluttered, haphazard, magical nature of it all. Hogwarts had been, after all, his first real home.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He stopped in front of the worn tapestry on the seventh floor. How many times had he stood here at twelve? At fourteen? At seventeen? Now, he was an old man, gnarled, deformed, a patchwork creature. </span>
  <em>
    <span>I’m looking for something I’ve lost.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>And the door swung open.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry always felt better at the Burrow. If she could have created a home from just her imaginings she would have made it like this: messy and disorganized, random jutting staircases and overstuffed armchairs, worn wooden floors and too loud voices, the smell of cinnamon and cloves, and warm, always so warm. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You look right skinny, mate,” Ron said, poking her in the shoulder. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry was curled up on Ron’s floor in a blanket that smelled like him, eating a pile of Molly’s famous brownies which Molly had thrust at her after making Harry eat a full dinner, sausage and potatoes and a heaping serving of green beans. Harry had eaten it all, though it had tasted like nothing to her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hmm,” Harry hummed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She didn’t know how to explain her summer, the deadness of it.  How she would find chunks of time missing, empty space. Eating hadn’t necessarily been a priority.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Have a brownie,” she said, instead. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ron frowned, but he took the proffered pastry. Hermione on the other side of him was watching Harry closely enough that it was making her uncomfortable</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s been right crazy ‘round here, of course,” Ron said, leaning back, mouth full of brownie. “Mum’s going completely mental because Bill got engaged to--” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, let’s not go into it,” Hermione said. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why?” Harry asked. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Because Hermione hates her too, she’s always going on about--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Shut it, Ronald,” Hermione said, whacking him on the back of the head, while Harry laughed. She’d missed them both. The easiness between them. “Besides that’s not what’s interesting,” Hermione continued, turning back to Harry. “We want to know how you are.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“‘Me?” Harry said. “‘M fine. Honestly.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione didn’t look convinced. “You know, Harry, it would be alright not to be okay.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She shrugged. “I know,” she said. “I just don’t want to think about it, alright?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Alright,” Hermione said, her eyes softening. This was one of the things Harry loved most about Hermione. She knew when not to push her. Harry took her hand, felt the familiar creases of her palm. Hermione squeezed back, a comforting weight.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well,” Hermione said. “Tell us this at least. Where did Dumbledore take you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m so out of shape,” Ron whined, panting. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Took the summer off?” Harry grinned.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, I’ve been a bit busy, haven’t I?”  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry laughed. “Waiting on Fleur, you mean?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>That morning, Harry had stumbled downstairs and found the half veela sitting at the breakfast table, looking far too put together for the early hour. Harry hadn’t even managed to brush her hair. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ron blushed. “Shove it,” he said. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry directed the broom upward, feeling the familiar rush in her chest. She’d missed flying. It made her feel wildly envious of those like Ron, who never had to give it up. She would fly every day if she could. And one day, she knew, she would be able to. Soon, she would never have to go back to the Dursleys. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She dove towards the ground, feeling the wind rush through her hair, pulling it free from her ponytail. She let out a whoop of joy. She could hear Ron behind her, yelling, see the ground rushing up towards her, closer and closer, until it was almost upon her, and then she pulled the handle up abruptly and she was careening back into the sky. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Bloody hell, Harry,” Ron said when she reached him. “You fucking scared me.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What?” she asked, pushing her hair out of her face. The wind had snarled it into a tangled riot of curls. “It’s just a bit of fun.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If you say so,” he said, but she could still feel his eyes on her, worried.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I do,” she said, rolling and sending her broom into a spin. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She flew until she couldn’t think at all. Until there wasn’t anything but the wind. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry hadn’t particularly felt like celebrating her birthday, but the Weasleys had insisted and Harry’d bowed to peer pressure. It was nice of them, Harry thought, but she wished that it were just her and Ron and Hermione. It was hard to act cheery at a gathering that mainly consisted of Order members. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She missed Sirius. It was a thought that she didn’t normally allow herself to have. But at times like this it rose to the forefront, sharp and painful. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey there, sweetheart,” she heard from behind her. And then she was barreling into Remus Lupin’s arms. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I missed you,” she said, words muffled by his tweed jacket. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He held her tightly, squeezing hard enough that her lungs ached, before he let her go. He looked tired, Harry thought, examining his face, and older than he had the last time she’d seen him. His smile was bittersweet. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And I you,” he said. “How are you holding up?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry felt tears prick her eyes. Suddenly, she was very aware of Kingsley eating cake two seats down. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I keep thinking he’ll write to me,” she said. “Is that stupid?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Remus said. “No, it’s not stupid at all.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“And of course,” Hermione said. “It’s not as if I necessarily expected to get Os in all ten, but still, I think it’s really unfair, when faced with the practical--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We all know you’re a genius, ‘Mione,” Ron said, crunching on an ice cream cone, the ice cream dripping all over his hands. Harry could see Hermione watching it with barely concealed horror. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, yes, well that’s kind, Ronald, but--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry held the door to Madame Malkin’s open for the other two, Hermione still chattering about her scores. They had received their OWLS earlier in the week, and while Harry hadn’t done horribly, she hadn’t made the required NEWT potions grade, which meant that any hope she might have had of being an Auror was effectively dashed. She hadn’t expected to make an O, of course, Snape was notoriously exacting, and he seemed to hold Harry to even higher standards, but still, there’d been a sinking feeling in her chest looking at that little E. If she wasn’t meant to be fighting Dark Wizards, then what was she meant to be doing?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Going inside, Harry almost bumped headlong into Draco Malfoy. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He looked terrible, his pale face sunken and drawn. And while he was dressed as impeccably as ever, shirt tucked in tight, hair gelled back from his face, there was an air of dishevelment about him that unnerved her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Watch it, Potter,” he snarled, but there wasn’t the normal bite to it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sorry,” she said, automatically stepping back. In a moment, he was down the street and out of sight.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That was weird, right?” she asked Ron and Hermione. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What?” Ron asked. Chocolate had dripped onto his shirt. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Malfoy,” she said. “He looked weird, right?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He looked like a right git, I imagine,” Ron said. “Like he always does.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, maybe,” Harry said. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Harry,” Hermione asked. “Do you think we should get trousers this year or just stick with the skirt? Oh, well, you know the trousers are practical, but the skirt is more traditional, isn’t it?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Go, try them on,” Harry said.“I’ll give you my opinion then.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry glanced again back towards the window where Malfoy had gone. Odd, she thought.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Weasley’s Wizards Wheezes was the brightest shop on the block. Wherein most of Diagon Alley looked grim, the people stony faced and frightened, the joke shop was flourishing. Harry supposed they all needed something to laugh about.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Bloody hell,” Ron said. “It’s mad brilliant, isn’t it?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The shop was packed full of people, and the three of them had to elbow their way up to the front. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Harry!” the twins called upon seeing her, both of them throwing their arms around her, squeezing her between them. She found herself laughing. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What? No greeting for your brother?” Ron huffed. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Aw, Ronniekins, don’t feel left out,” George said, ruffling the younger boy’s hair.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He shrugged them off.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Feel free to look around,” Fred said. “For you, Harry, anything you want, free.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She frowned. “I couldn’t,” she said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re our mysterious benefactor. Of course you can,” George said, shoving her off into the bustle of the crowd.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The shop almost felt like a candy store for magic, Harry thought. Everywhere she looked there were bright gizmos and what’s its, everything she had imagined as a child that magic could be and more. Near the front, there was a bright pink table, advertising: “Looking for love? Look no further!” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Love potions,” Hermione said, curling her lip. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Alright there, Harry?” a voice asked. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry turned and saw Michael Corner peering down at her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, hey Michael,” she said. “Have a good summer?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not bad, you?” he said. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Alright,” she said, distracted. Hermione had disappeared from her side.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You thinking of doing D.A again this year?” he asked. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh,” Harry said. “Um, I hadn’t really thought about it.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Michael shifted. Harry saw Hermione in the far corner and she tried to make eye contact.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, I guess I’ll see you around, then?” he asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, right, yeah,” she said. “See you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry pushed her way through to Hermione, grabbing the other girl’s arm. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why’d you leave me?” Harry asked. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Harry,” Hermione said, not unaffectionately. “You had to notice that poor boy was trying to flirt with you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Who?” Harry asked. “Michael?” She looked dubiously around for the Ravenclaw. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, Michael,” Hermione said, briskly. “Honestly, Harry, you’re even more hopeless than I am.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, well,” Harry said, looping her arm through Hermione’s. “Boys are overrated anyhow.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Voldemort had always found the seaside beautiful. When he had come as a boy, it had seemed so different from the orphanage with its dull, crumbling walls and dreary hallways. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was the same now. He felt as if he were ten again, leading little Mary and Caroline into the dark. How frightened they had been. How their fear had fed him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>In the back of his mind, he could feel Harry’s happiness, the bubble of her delight in his chest. It was distracting. Over the past several weeks, she’d seemed happier, like she’d been sleeping for months and now she was awake.  It annoyed him that he’d noticed. But while he’d blocked himself from her, her walls were flimsy, ephemeral things. He could still feel her consciousness brushing his with every breath, her emotions, her thoughts, bleeding into his own.. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>-- wish that Sirius were here, I know it’s stupid, but I still think about --</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>--  </span>
  <em>
    <span>Hermione’s watching me too closely, I wonder if she can tell I --</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>-- he’d looked at me like like like  --</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Voldemort tried to tune her out, turning his gaze out to the ocean, watching the undulation of the waves until his mind was clear and steady, and then he stepped off the edge of the cliff. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>While Harry had been at the Dursley’s she couldn’t wait for the school year to begin, but now that she was at the Burrow, Harry just wanted the summer to stretch on a little longer. She was not quite ready to face her schoolmates, all of them eager to hear about Voldemort and the night at the Ministry, things she would rather not think about. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>But soon September 1st arrived and they were bundled off to the train. The Order had come to escort them, mainly for Harry’s safety she knew, which made her feel awkward and self-conscious. Still, she was glad to see Remus and Tonks.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>On the platform, Remus stopped her before she got on the train with a hand on her elbow. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I want you to be extra careful this year,” he said. His amber eyes were worried and his grip on her arm edged on being too tight. “We don’t know what’s coming and I want you to be prepared.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I will,” she said. “Don’t worry about me, Remus.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I always worry about you, sweetheart,” he said, pulling her into his arms.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She breathed in his familiar smell, old books and leather. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Stay safe,” he breathed into her hair. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You too,” she said. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>And then he was letting go of her and she was getting on the train and they were pulling away, and he became just a blip in the distance. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Harry, there you are, my dear,” Slughorn said, putting an arm around her shoulder. He smelled like incense and palm oil, an overwhelming and not particularly pleasant scent. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Did you have a good rest of the summer, sir,” she asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Slughorn was steering her down the hallway, away from Luna, who had come up to Harry to talk to her about Wrackspurts and was now waving cheerily as Harry disappeared down the corridor. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I can’t complain, I can’t complain,” he said. “Come into my cabin. I’m having a few guests over, just a select number of students, you understand.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, I’m sure I wouldn’t want to intrude, really sir--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Slughorn all but shoved her into the compartment, so that Harry almost stumbled to the ground. When she straightened, she saw that Blaise Zabini was eyeing her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What are you looking at?” she asked him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Pleasant,” he said. “No, really lovely, Potter. My summer was swell, thanks for asking.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, fuck off, Zabini,” Ginny said. Harry, grateful for an ally, went to her sit beside her, just as Slughorn slid the door closed. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So, now then,” he said. “Let’s get this party started, shall we?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Zabini, across from Harry, grinned.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry officially hated Horace Slughorn.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, he’s mental alright,” Ginny agreed, as they headed back towards their own compartment.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Even the name’s disgusting,” Harry said. “Who wants to be part of the Slug Club?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh well, Gran was part of it,” Neville said. “I’m sure she’s expecting me to join as well.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Potter,” Harry heard, and she turned and saw Malfoy standing behind her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He looked even worse than he had when she’d seen him in Diagon Alley, his face waxen and drawn, his collar unbuttoned and crumpled. It was obvious he had put a valiant effort into looking normal, but it had failed miserably. He looked almost like a caricature of himself. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Can I talk to you for a moment?” he asked. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry glanced back at Neville and Ginny who were both looking on incredulously.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Um, sure,” Harry said, uncomfortably. “I’ll meet you guys back at the compartment.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Malfoy was silent for a long time even after the two had left. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes?” Harry said. “You wanted something?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He was clenching his jaw, the muscle standing out in sharp contrast. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I wanted to say I was sorry,” he said. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“For what?” Harry said, suspiciously. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“For whatever you want,” he said. “For all of it.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“For five years of torment, you mean?” she asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes,” he said. It was obvious that it was paining him to say this, and Harry couldn’t quite imagine why he was. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“For being a nasty git to me and all of my friends?” Harry asked. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Malfoy huffed out a breath. His hair had fallen out of it’s careful placement and hung in limp, pale strands around his face. “Yes,” he said. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What do you want?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Would you just fucking accept my apology?” he hissed. “Do you have to be so relentlessly difficult?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re not really endearing yourself to me,” Harry said, crossing her arms. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sorry,” he said, again. He sighed, suddenly, deflating. “Take that as you will,” he said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And then he was turning and disappearing down the train. Harry watched him for a moment, confused, and then, with one more backwards glance, started back towards her own compartment. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What happened to his hand?” Hermione asked. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It looked that way when he came and picked me up,” Harry said. “I thought it would have been healed by now.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It must be cursed,” Hermione said. Harry could already see she was longing to go look it up. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Speaking of cursed,” Ron said. “Snape,” he paused, “as the Defense teacher. Like Severus Snape. Our Snape. It’s like his wet dream or something.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I really didn’t want to think about Snape having wet dreams,” Harry said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, you’re going to have to start doing DA again,” Hermione said, briskly. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry looked over at her. “You think?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“People’ll be clawing down the doors to come,” Ron said. “You know, the Chosen One and all that.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry groaned. “Don’t remind me,” she said. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’ve reached a new level of fame, mate,” Ron said, cheerily. “Fighting Voldemort off for the second time will do that for you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I didn’t really do anything,” Harry muttered, shoving the peas around on her plate. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry didn’t like to think of the fight at the Department of Mysteries, not </span>
  <em>
    <span>his</span>
  </em>
  <span> cloying presence, how it had enveloped her, become her, how she had opened her mouth and his voice had slithered out, not the way that he had looked at her, red eyes blown wide, as if she had, for once, surprised him, not the way he’d said her name, how it hadn’t sounded like her name at all, how he’d said it like she was someone else, like she was-- She didn’t know.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I didn’t do anything,” Harry repeated.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>.</span>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>Number 12 Grimmauld Place was a grimy, depressing house, and although it was obvious some attempt had been made to make the place more hospitable — the glowing orbs on the staircase, the empty splotches on the wall where old portraits must have once been — it was still almost embarrassingly bedraggled. It embodied, Voldemort thought, everything that he’d always despised about purebloods. Fools, the lot of them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They had left a smattering of trick courses on the steps of the house, but he scattered them with a wave of his hand. Paltry work, as if they could keep him out. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He could sense the locket in the house, a glowing beacon. There was something seductive in the call of the Horcruxes, something almost intoxicating. He felt more real in their presence, like something new had clicked into place. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was hard to imagine Harry here in this house. She seemed to bright to exist in a place as drab is this. The only times he had seen her, admittedly, were in moments of battle -- the darkness of the old Riddle graveyard, her face drawn and pale, a streak of red hair like blood across her cheek, the stark white of the ministry’s atrium, the bright green of her eyes, the way she’d looked at him like she was seeing a monster from her nightmares -- but that would change soon.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>In the center of the kitchen, the brightest room in the house, a house-elf was muttering to himself. The creature looked up when he came into the room as if in surprise. It really must have been far gone if it had not noticed him enter the house. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Who are you?” it asked. A rude creature. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m your Lord,” Voldemort said. “And I’m looking for something.” </span>
  <span></span>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p>
  <span>.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Is it bad that I’m already exhausted?” Harry asked. It was only the second day of term and it already felt like a lifetime.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oy, fuck off,” Ron said, as another third year attempted to squeeze in next to Harry on the bench. The boy squeaked and then darted off.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nah,” Ron said, turning back to Harry. “I mean it’s been right mental since we’ve been back, hasn’t it? A girl asked me to sign her tits the other day, and I mean, I barely did anything, did I?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, and I’m sure that was such a hardship for you, wasn’t it, Ronald?” Hermione said, sniffily.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ron blushed and Harry laughed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, I’m glad my fame is doing some good,” she said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t be a dick,” Ron said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She’s not signing autographs,” Hermione said as another third year came up to them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The girl looked uncomfortable. “Um, I,” she said. “Well, Headmaster Dumbledore he asked me to give you this message.” She thrust her hand out and then skittered off.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Geez, Hermione,” Ron said. “Terrify much?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Honestly, Ronald,” Hermione said, flushing. “As if you don’t yell at anyone that comes near Harry.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, but I do it with tact, don’t I?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry unfolded the piece of paper.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He wants to meet me,” Harry said. “Something about doing private lessons this year?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, well, that isn’t really a surprise, is it?” Hermione said. “That he’d want to prepare you? For what’s to come?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>What was to come? Harry wondered. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Harry said. “No, I suppose not.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Albus Dumbledore turned away from the Pensieve. Somehow he always managed to fool himself, to convince himself that if he took the memories from his head and placed them in the bowl they would weigh on him less.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A boy, his grin, and a girl, red-headed and too young, James Potter standing in this office, saying, "How can we make her safe, Albus?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She is still too young,” he told Fawkes. The phoenix blinked at him sadly. He laid his good hand on the bird’s head. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Normally Fawkes had the ability to give him peace, but peace was hard won these days. He did not know if he had another war inside him. He had seen too much pain already.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And, he knew, it had only just begun.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It was late in the evening, after everyone had already gone to bed -- Ron with a muffled yawn and a hand ruffling Harry’s hair, Hermione with a worried look -- and Harry found herself alone in the Gryffindor common room. She had told Hermione she had wanted to finish her first essay for Transfiguration -- NEWT levels, as Hermione had promised, were much more difficult than OWLs -- but really she had simply wanted some time to herself. She had thought, this summer, that she had her fill of solitude, but it felt, now, like a giant hole within herself, consuming. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She found herself watching the fire, studying the flames. It really was too warm for a fire, but she found that she liked it anyway. She couldn’t seem to get warm, these days. The flames licked their way up the grate, red and orange and bright white. She found herself lulled into an almost sleep-like state. She was still there, in the common room -- she could feel the soft velvet of her favorite armchair, and the weight of her hair against her shoulders, the warmth of the fire against her side -- but so too she could feel him. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Harry, </span>
  </em>
  <span>he said, his voice like the stroke of a palm. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>And then she woke up. </span>
</p><p> </p>
