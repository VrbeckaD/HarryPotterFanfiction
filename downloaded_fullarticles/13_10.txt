    <p>“Severus, that’s enough for today,” Albus said as he rose from his chair. He looked carefully at the young man across from him. The new Potion’s Master was hunched over in his seat, simply nodding or muttering a ‘yes’ in response to everything Albus had told him. They had spent the afternoon going over the things Severus would need to know to take his place as both the new potions professor and the Head of Slytherin house. Yet, the Headmaster wasn’t even sure if he’d understood or frankly, cared about, anything they’d discussed. There were lines beneath Severus’s eyes, and Albus had cut their meeting short, knowing he was getting nowhere. “You should get some rest. I know it’s been a trying few weeks…I hope you find your rooms suitable.” The entire situation was still awkward for Albus. Just months before, the man whom the entire order had grown to hate had appeared to him, begging for help in a moment of weakness. Albus knew that the man had always been troubled, it had been apparent when he was a child, and that Severus’s desperation would make him a loyal ally for the Headmaster’s cause.</p>
<p>“Don’t you think if I had a more suitable option, I would be there and not here?” The man’s voice was monotone except for the hint of exhaustion that clouded over his normally sturdy voice.</p>
<p>Albus walked around his desk and clamped a hand on Severus’s shoulder. Even through the man’s heavy robes, he could feel how boney he was. Severus winced when Dumbledore touched him. He imagined the man hadn’t had a kind hand touch him in a long time. Albus couldn’t help but frown slightly, rubbing the man’s shoulder. Severus looked up at him, eyes void of any discernable emotion. “You’re quite thin. We should get you something to eat.”<br/>
Before Severus could reply, the door to the office slid open and both men turned to look. The Deputy Headmistress walked into the office. “Ah, Minerva! Just in time! I was telling Severus here we really must get him fed.”</p>
<p>His friend’s face fell when she saw Severus. Albus knew that she hadn’t seen him since he had graduated, and in that time, Minerva had grown first disappointed, and then angry with her former student. Albus understood. They all felt that way. Minerva had been a constant source of support for him when he was a child, even when he hadn’t known. When James and the other Gryffindors had tortured and bullied Snape, Minerva had never hesitated to punish them. The Headmaster and his Deputy had had many arguments over the situation. A few times, Minerva had insisted that he expel James and his friends. Albus had never felt that expulsion was necessary, and they had gone countless nights without speaking until Minerva would come around to his decision, or lack thereof. When they found out Severus had turned to Voldemort’s side, Minerva had come to his office, moved to tears in disappointment. She’d always cared for Severus. Eventually, the disappointment had turned to anger as more and more news about the atrocities committed by Death Eaters had emerged. Nobody ever knew the specifics of what Severus had participated in, but the imagination was an awful thing. Severus had never told Albus of his past and Albus had never felt compelled to ask. When Albus had confided in Minerva that Severus would be returning to Hogwarts, Minerva had disagreed with his decision. She’d felt he was unfit to teach and a danger to the students. No matter how much assurance Albus had given to Minerva, she had protested his decision. He couldn’t give too much away to her about Severus’s loyalties. He’d insisted to Albus that nobody could know, and Albus knew it was best kept their secret. The consequence of keeping it secret was that others would be slow to develop a trust in Severus.</p>
<p>“Mr. Snape,” she said coldly as she walked into the office. As she walked towards them, her hat perfectly straight, Minerva looked like a force to be reckoned with. Despite the stern look on her face, Albus could see the slight sadness in her green eyes. Years of being her friend had given him the rare ability to see beneath her stern exterior.</p>
<p>Severus nodded. “Hello, Minerva,” he said quietly, but confidently. If her coldness intimidated him, his face made no indication of it.</p>
<p>“Professor McGonagall,” she corrected, standing beside Albus.</p>
<p>“Now, Min, we’re all colleagues here,” Albus said, trying to jump in to cut the tension between the two, now, rival heads of houses.</p>
<p>“Very true, Albus. And it is my name and I will tell Mr. Snape when I feel he may use it.”</p>
<p>Severus stood and faced her, silently looking at her for a few moments before he spoke. As Albus looked at the two, he could feel the tension filling up the room. Aside from himself and Voldemort, he was watching two of the most powerful wizards of their time face to face with one another. It occurred to him, in that moment, the power held by each of them. “Why did you come? I didn’t ask for a welcome party.”</p>
<p>Albus placed a hand on her shoulder. “I asked Minerva to show you to your rooms. She is my right hand, after all. All of our new staff are welcomed by us both.” Minerva snorted slightly at this but made no comment.</p>
<p>“I hardly think that’s necessary,” Severus replied, his eyes still fixed on his former professor.</p>
<p>“I would have to agree, Albus,” she replied, facing Albus and then Severus again as she asked, “I trust you remember where Professor Slughorn lived?”</p>
<p>Severus nodded. He knew Minerva was displeased with Severus’s return, but he had hoped she would have at least been cordial. Turning to Severus, he said, “If you would prefer to go alone, then so be it. I know it’s been a trying day. Would you like me to summon a house elf to help you with your things?”</p>
<p>“I have no need for their assistance.”</p>
<p>Albus nodded sadly. “I do hope to see you at the staff dinner. I always like to throw a rousing beginning of year dinner!” His half-hearted enthusiasm was ignored by both parties.</p>
<p>Severus stood, looking at Albus and then Minerva before saying a stern, “Good night.” Albus wished him a good night, and Minerva said nothing. When the door closed behind him, Minerva moved to sit in the seat across from the Headmaster’s chair.</p>
<p>“I haven’t seen him since…”</p>
<p>“I know.”</p>
<p>Minerva looked up at him, shaking her head. “I truly don’t know how you plan to make this work Albus. The man isn’t…he’s never been fit for a teaching position even without his…past.” She sighed and stood, walking to the other side of the room, facing away from him. “And besides that, how do you expect us to trust him? Ten years ago, I would have, but now…”</p>
<p>“He’s smart, Min. You were quite fond of him as a child, if I remember correctly. Why, I remember you telling me how bright of a future he would have if he just developed more confidence.”</p>
<p>Minerva wrapped her arms around herself. “That was a long time ago. That was before he…”</p>
<p>“I understand why you distrust him. But, you’re my right hand. I need you to be strong for the rest of the staff. You know they look to you for how to react to things. It’s not about trusting Severus, it’s about trusting me.”</p>
<p>Minerva turned and looked sharply at him. “Albus, you can’t force this on us all. If it’s your decision to have him here, you must live with the consequences. Nobody is going to welcome him with open arms. You’re a bloody fool if you think that!”</p>
<p>He nodded, knowing she was right. He met here where she was, taking her hand in his and squeezing it.</p>
<p>No matter how mad she was, their friendship would withstand it. They’d been through a lot together, and he valued her loyalty to him. In many ways, she was the voice of reason in the back of his head. She was the only wizard he had encountered that wasn’t afraid to tell him how she felt when she disagreed with him. In many ways, his reputation had made him unapproachable. Nobody dared to question Albus Dumbledore. Part of him loved the power, he would never deny it. While the unquenchable search for power he had been after in his youth had faded, there would always be a part of the old man that enjoyed the strength. But, Minerva always brought him off his pedestal and grounded him. Often times, he needed it.</p>
<p>“I understand. I do hope that in time, you will help Severus find his place here.”</p>
<p>“Maybe in time, Albus.”</p>
<p>As he looked at his dear friend, he smiled slightly. He truly hoped the two could find a strength in one another. They were both strong and both stubborn. Though Severus lacked her passion, they would both be simultaneously respected as educators. With Albus’s strong friendship to both, he knew that they would need another to understand what they went through. Albus knew that he himself was no easy man to be an ally for. He demanded a lot, and though he knew it was for the greater good, he knew that with the upcoming years, committing to the greater good would become more and more taxing for them both, albeit for separate reasons. He would ask a lot from them both, take a lot from them both. Even with the war winding down, Albus sensed Lord Voldemort’s reign was far from over. The two would be needed more than he had ever needed them before, and the resentment they held for one another would need to at least fade. They would need each other, being the two people in the world he would trust more than anyone. Albus sighed and wrapped her into a hug. “Trust me, Min.”</p>
<p>“I trust you, but I just can’t trust him…not now…maybe in a few months, a few years, I just don’t know.” Minerva broke the hug, moving herself even closer to the door. “I will see you at dinner.” Albus made no further move to keep her, watching the door slide shut behind her.</p>
