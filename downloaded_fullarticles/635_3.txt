    <p>xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</p><p>Under the curtain of dark clouds, the medieval castle imposed upon the skyline. Spires pierced the heavens, which were vacillating between wet snow and freezing rain. Although the castle commanded attention and the deluge was off putting to most people, groups of students and teachers still hurried about on the grass outside. They walked, heads bowed with various books and objects clasped to their chest, trying to move out of the rain as quickly as possible. </p><p>To me, the storm was relaxing for this time of year, and I enjoyed every moment standing in the downpour. Although I wasn't wearing a jacket or pants, I felt no chill as nearly frozen water melted into my black skirt, quickly saturating the thin fabric. A group of other students passed by, glaring my way, questioning why someone would be out in this weather unless necessary. I started back as icily as I could and made a rude gesture before turning back to the majesty of the sky. </p><p>Before I could worry about how drenched I was becoming, I noticed a young man with hair the color of winter sunlight calling to me from a window.  He yelled my name again, clearly having been shouting for a while. </p><p>"Ebony!" He called once more, now realizing I had spotted him. I reddened slightly, realizing he had been watching me as I stared into the storm. He probably thought I was insane. </p><p>I waved and responded over the torrent, "Draco! What's up?" </p><p>Of course, at that moment, fate decided our conversation was not to be, and the class bell rang, interrupting his reply. He drew back and shrugged, clearly ending our quick conversation. I was still curious why he had yelled to me from out the window, especially in this weather, but I had no more chances to see him. Realizing I had to hurry to my own class, I spotted a group of friends scurrying to our next class and raced to catch up. I glanced back at his closed window, pondering Draco's actions, before turning back and walking to class.</p><p>Â </p><p>xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</p>
