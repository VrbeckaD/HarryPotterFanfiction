    <p>“Albus Dumbledore, what is going inside your head? You think Harry will be safe living here? You want him to live with these muggles? Do you know how bad they are? Of course you don’t! YOU NEVER HEARD LILY COMPLAIN ABOUT THEM! YOU NEVER HEARD HOW HORRIBLE THEY ARE! THEY WILL NOT BE GOOD TO HARRY! HARRY DOESN’T DESERVE THIS! HARRY DOESN’T DESERVE ANY OF IT! HE SHOULD HAVE AFAMILY THAT LOVES HIM AND CARES FOR HIM, ALBUS! HE DESERVES BETTER THAN THIS! I AM HIS GODFATHER AND I AM THE CLOSEST THING HE HAS TO A FAMILY NOW!<br/>
“Sirius… Calm down.” The old man answered calmly, as he analysed what the young, worn down man had to say.<br/>
“HOW CAN YOU TELL ME TO CALM DOWN? JAMES IS DEAD AND LILY IS DEAD AND I HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR SON BECAUSE THAT IS MY RESPONSIBILITY AND YOU CAN’T TAKE THAT AWAY! HARRY IS MY RESPONSIBILITY! I WILL NOT LET HIM GO INTO THAT HOUSE! TAKING CARE OF HIM WAS JAMES AND LILY’S DYING WISH!” Sirius yelled as tears came down his already red eyes.<br/>
“Sirius…”</p><p>“NO! Let me take him….please…” </p><p>The street was dark and Sirius’ cries and screams pierced the silence. His sobs were heard from every house in the street, but no one woke up.<br/>
The only light was the light from the moon, shaped like a nail, and the stars, shining down four silhouettes. A huge man, who could only stand and stare in awe of the intensity of Black’s pleas. </p><p>McGonagall took this pause as her queue to talk:<br/>
“The boy is right. First, these muggles are the worst kind I’ve ever seen. They are rude and ignorant. Their son hit his mother after she turned off the TV and she almost fell down the stairs while holding the boy, who was throwing a tantrum. Every rude and distasteful thing the boy does is celebrated by both his parents. I saw them talking and…well… they mentioned the Potters. Both of them seemed disgusted at the idea of them. I don’t want to imagine what they would do to Harry…”</p><p>Sirius was still sobbing, unable to talk, as he held the sleeping baby, covered in blankets. He looked worn down and tired, his clothes dirty and ragged. His hair had not been washed in a couple of days due to the massive events that happened one after the other in chain reaction.</p><p>“Also, Albus, it is true that Black is Harry’s godfather. Lily and James decided that long ago. It is true that he is responsible for Harry.” She looked at the bundle. “Sirius is his legal guardian.”</p><p>“I see…” Dumbledore stroked his beard. “You definitely make a convincing point. Sirius, you can take Harry to your house. I suppose Remus will be involved too?”</p><p>“Uh, yes, most likely he will help out with Harry.” He sniffed. “Wait…I can take Harry?”<br/>
“We will be checking up on you, Sirius. Take him” </p><p>“Thank you. Thank you so much!” He shot up and hugged the old man. “I will take care of Harry.”</p><p>Sirius rose from the dark, wet ground and took Harry to the baby’s seat in his huge motorbike. He smiled from ear to ear as he took off into the sky, towards number 12 Grimmauld Place.<br/>
“Well, then. That is our cue to leave. This surely was an unnecessary trip but now you are more than welcome to join me in the celebrations.” Dumbledore said with a grin in his face.<br/>
Hagrid, McGonagall and Dumbledore transported to a party, now finally able to celebrate the defeat of the Dark Lord.<br/>
Far away from there, Sirius Black was riding his motorbike in the sky, singing loudly to the Weird Sisters and laughing. His day had been bittersweet.<br/>
For past day, he’d been mourning the death of his two best friends. He had cried until he didn’t have any tears left and he had held Remus until he didn’t either. He had punched holes in the wall and he had visited every old photo album he had with them, missing James’ laugh and Lily’s red hair. Remus, who was living with him, hid himself in his room after crying with Sirius. He hadn’t heard anything from him since then.</p><p>He also was willing to kill his old best friend, Peter, because it was all his fault. The coward had told Voldemort where the Potters were hiding. It was all Peter’s fault. Or was it? In the back of his head there was a voice blaming Sirius for trying to fool Voldemort by making Peter the holder of the Fidelius charm. That same day, he’d gone and to find Peter, to confront him. He was out the whole day, he tried to find him everywhere but he only found a note in his house saying he was gone and he was never coming back, he was serving the Dark Lord.</p><p>But after he got back to the dark, house in Grimmauld Place, he saw Lupin sitting in the small kitchen, waiting for him with a grave look.<br/>
“Moony…”<br/>
“Sirius, is it true?” He asked with a serious tone.<br/>
“Yeah, it was him. I didn’t find him. That bastard!” He punched the wooden table. “Why did he do it? Each one of us was willing to die before telling him where they were!”</p><p>“Padfoot. One more thing: Harry.” Remus looked worried but his grave tone never changed.</p><p>“Shit! Harry!” Sirius ran outside the house and got into his motorbike, speeding toward Godric’s Hollow, where the ruined Potter house was. He knew he had to go back in there, where Lily and James’ bodies were but in that moment there was a bigger priority than mourning: getting Harry out of there. Harry was his godson and he was to take care of him. </p><p>When he got there, Hagrid, a member of the Order of the Phoenix was already walking out with Harry wrapped in a snug blanket. </p><p>He argued with the half-giant briefly, until they resolved to go together in Sirius’ bike to Hagrid’s destination, mostly due to the fact the Sirius was ready to argue with Dumbledore and Hagrid was intimidated by whoever was planning on doing so.</p><p>Now on his way back, Sirius realised he was cold and he didn’t have a jacket. Up in the sky, his hair flew and his face looked less worn down.<br/>
“I wonder how great my hair looks right now…” He muttered to himself. </p><p>He checked on Harry who was sleeping soundly, snuggled in his baby seat. He hoped Remus was still up so he would help him find a place for Harry and even give him some of his great soup. He was cold. </p><p>Harry moved a little and caught his godfather’s attention. He noticed how much his hair was like James and his face too but something else was more important. He had a scar in the shape of a lightning. </p><p>“Oh, Harry, that’s nasty. Moony and Padfoot will take care of you, okay?” He told the baby. “Moony is such a great cook. He makes the best food, Harry, you will love it. Your parents did. I’m a sick Quidditch player. I’ll get you a broom and I’ll teach you how to play. You’re probably great at it, given James is your father. You’ll be so happy with us, the wizarding world is great.”</p><p>He continued to talk to Harry like that until he parked his motorbike outside number 11 Grimmauld Place (the muggles would be angry about it but he didn't care at that moment). In the dark of the night, no one noticed the tall man with dark, long hair, holding a baby in his left arm and flicking his wand to make house number 12 appear. </p><p>The tall building had many spells to keep people from finding it, between the fear of muggles that the Black family had and Dumbledore’s protection since it became the headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix, it was almost impossible to find.</p><p>He slowly opened the wooden door and before he knew it, Remus was hugging him tightly, sighing in relief. Sirius didn’t mind the embrace of the taller man. They were used to each other’s bodies and contact wasn’t something new to them. Since he moved in with him, Remus had become his home.<br/>
“You got him.” He whispered.</p><p>“Yeah, I did” Sirius replied. “We take care of him now”</p><p>“Holy shit, Sirius, you’re cold” He hugged him tighter.</p><p>“I forgot a jacket. Can we go to sleep now? I’m so tired.” </p><p>They walked upstairs to Sirius’ room, where Remus had prepared a small space for Harry to sleep in. All that effort went out of the window. Either of them changed clothes, they just took their pants off, threw themselves to bed and put Harry in between them. Sirius hugging Harry, promising to never let him go, and Remus holding Sirius’ hand, neither of them complaining.</p><p>It was a new family.</p><p>Remus, Sirius and Harry.</p><p>Moony, Padfoot and little Prongs.</p>
