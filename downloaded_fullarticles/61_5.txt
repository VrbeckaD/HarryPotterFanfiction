    <p>Draco looked at his reflection in the mirror and frowned. Despite only being twenty-five, he had deep worry lines that, no matter how much he tried to relax his face, didn’t go away, and barely visible crow’s feet decorated the corners of his pale pewter eyes. </p>
<p>He looked the same, for the most part. His hair was still ashen in color, and it had a medium cut to it, the bottom of it curling slightly behind his ears. Thankfully, over the past eight years, he had managed to put on all of the weight he had lost during 6th and 7th year. That, and a bit of color had returned to what had previously been his graying skin. All in all, he looked the healthiest he had in years, albeit a little older and a little more worn.</p>
<p>Draco took one last look at himself, straightened his emerald green robes, and walked back into his living quarters. Muted evening light streamed into the room through the white linen curtains, and Draco could hear the lyrical whistling of an owl somewhere outside his window. On the wooden desk beside his foreign, unfamiliar four-poster bed sat a stack of parchment, several quills and ink pots, the latest edition of “Advanced Potion Making,” his wand, which Potter had returned to him a month after the Battle of Hogwarts ended, and a leather satchel.</p>
<p>Sighing, Draco began to pace back and forth across his new room, the hollow sound of his footsteps clinging to the silent air.</p>
<p>“Alright. The feast first, and then there’s the Sorting Ceremony. McGonagall will introduce me as the new potions professor during dinner. I know the routine of tonight like the<br/>
back of my hand, namely because I was a bloody student here. Merlin, I need to pull myself together,” Draco muttered to himself in a slightly out of breath panic. </p>
<p>After struggling to take a breath that fully saturated his lungs, Draco walked towards the door, taking one last look at his new bedroom before closing it behind him. </p>
<p>He swept around the corner, his robes billowing out behind him, and fast-walked down the corridor. Dancing orange light, coming from the torches that lined both walls, flickered across all surfaces. After climbing the staircase that led from the dungeons to the ground-level, Draco took a deep breath. Just a few more steps, and he would be at the Great Hall. </p>
<p>“The students aren’t even here yet, you git. Calm down,” Draco forcibly told himself quietly. He continued walking, eventually making his way into the Great Hall. Only one other person was there, and she was busy flicking her wand. Draco watched the four house banners appear across the walls. The Enchanted Ceiling above held a pale navy color, silver dots echoing against the dark.</p>
<p>When finished with setting up the banners, McGonagall looked towards Draco, a polite smile on her face. Draco cautiously walked further into the Great Hall until he stood opposite her.</p>
<p>“I’m very pleased to see you, Mr. Malfoy,” McGonagall said. </p>
<p>Draco subtly looked her up and down. Her hair, which was reliably tied in a tight knot, had quite a bit more grey to it, and the lines etched into her face ran deeper than they had before.</p>
<p>“You too, Professor. How are things?” Draco asked.</p>
<p>McGonagall sighed heavily, but she showed no other signs of weariness. “Things are alright. I can say with confidence that the castle is as much restored as it’s going to be. There’s still a few dings here and there, but that’s of little importance. How are you finding your sleeping quarters?”</p>
<p>“It’s lovely. Thank you. Is there anything I can do to help?” Draco asked. </p>
<p>“Well, the students are to be arriving …” McGonagall checked her pocket watch, “at any moment. Why don’t you go ahead and stand by the front door to greet them as they come in?”</p>
<p>Draco gulped. “Wonderful. See you at the feast.”</p>
<p>As he turned and walked away, Draco couldn’t help but feel fretful. He stood by the door awkwardly, tapping his foot to fill the empty air. </p>
<p>Several minutes went by before he heard the not-too-distant chittering of returning students. He opened the front door and plastered a large smile on his face.</p>
<p>As the returning students flowed through the front doors of the castle, Draco found himself creating a calm pattern of “hello,” “welcome back,” and polite nodding. If any of the students had something against him, which he assumed was entirely plausible, they certainly didn’t show it. </p>
<p>Just as Draco was about to greet another student, he heard hollow footsteps coming up behind him. He turned around and was faced with a view he wouldn’t have expected in a million years.</p>
<p>There, standing before him, was Harry bloody Potter. Draco felt his jaw clench slightly, and he huffed hot air out his nose.</p>
<p>“Malfoy?” Potter asked, furrowing his eyebrows as he crossed his arms. </p>
<p>“What the hell are you doing here, Potter?” Draco asked, narrowing his eyes.</p>
<p>“I should be asking you the same thing,” Potter retorted.</p>
<p>Draco frowned. “I’m the new potions professor, and you didn’t answer my question.”</p>
<p>“You’re not seriously teaching here, are you?” Potter asked, and Draco nodded suspiciously. “Minerva hired me as the new defense against the dark arts professor.”</p>
<p>Draco let out a dry laugh. “Fantastic. Just my luck.”</p>
<p>As they stared at one another, Draco couldn’t help but feel a surge of déjà vu. Somewhere, off in another life, was little Draco Malfoy -- eleven and too confident in himself. Draco wondered if his current situation would be different had he just offered to be friends. </p>
<p>“Well, I suppose Minerva trusts you. I guess I do too, then,” Potter surmised. </p>
<p>“Thank you so much, Potter. How considerate of you,” Draco deadpanned. </p>
<p>Potter sighed, running his right hand through his heap of black curls. “Merlin, why are you so difficult?”</p>
<p>Draco snorted. “Look who’s talking. You’re insufferable.”</p>
<p>“Git.”</p>
<p>“Arsehole.”</p>
<p>“Ferret.”</p>
<p>“Potty.”</p>
<p>As lame insults flew, they both inched towards one another until they were face to face. Draco stretched his torso as much as he could, looming a good three inches over Potter. After several moments of rude exchanges, Draco felt a tap on his shoulder. He turned to find a girl of about fourteen, with large brown eyes, staring up at him.</p>
<p>“Um, professors? Is everything okay?” the girl asked, blinking.</p>
<p>Draco looked at Potter, and Potter looked at him. They both took a step back. Potter cleared his throat, and Draco straightened his robes. </p>
<p>“Yes! Yes. Everything’s fine. Now go on to the Great Hall,” Draco said far too enthusiastically. The girl nodded and walked away.<br/>
Draco took that as his cue. He turned towards the Great Hall, giving Potter one final glare before walking off. </p>
<p>As he entered the Great Hall, which was halfway filled with young and excited students, Draco found himself distracted by how different Potter looked. Eight years ago, his unruly black hair had fallen in messy ringlets around his shoulders. It was a great contrast to what Potter’s hair now looked like, as it was much shorter, with tight curls falling loosely over his forehead. The scar was still there -- of course it was -- but it didn’t look as angry. The raised, white jagged lines stemmed from his right temple, jutting diagonally to his left cheekbone. From what Draco could remember, the scar had always had a tint of red ringing the edges. Potter’s skin looked better, too. He wasn’t nearly as scrawny as he had once been, and the tawny color had returned to what had been his dull, sunken skin. And there was something different about his eyes, too. They were brighter. </p>
<p>Draco willed his mind to clear as he approached the long table that held all of the professors. He took a seat at the far left end, leaving a chair between himself and … Longbottom?</p>
<p>“Malfoy?” Longbottom turned to him, his round cheeks a bright red. </p>
<p>“Uh, hello,” Draco said stiffly.</p>
<p>“What are you doing here?” Longbottom asked, raising a dirty blonde eyebrow. </p>
<p>“New potions professor. You?” Draco asked.</p>
<p>“I became the herbology professor right after the war.”</p>
<p>“Ah.”</p>
<p>“Neville!” </p>
<p>Draco turned around at the grating sound of Potter’s voice. Longbottom stood up from his seat, embracing Potter in a tight hug. After greeting each other, Longbottom sat back down in his seat. Draco watched as Potter realized that he was to be sitting in between Longbottom and himself. As Potter sat down, busying himself in conversation with Longbottom, Draco rubbed his temples and rolled his eyes. </p>
<p>After several minutes of pondering why Merlin chose for him to suffer, McGonagall walked to the podium in front of the professors’ table. </p>
<p>Clearing her throat, she said, “hello, everyone. To all returning students, welcome back. And to our first years, welcome home.”</p>
