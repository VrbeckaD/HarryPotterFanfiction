</p><p align="right">28/8/1991</p><p> </p><p>Dear parents, alumni, and friends of Hogwarts,</p><p>A slight turn in the breeze that creeps across the castle grounds tells me that, once again, summer is nearly past.  Sure enough, as I look from the window of my tower across the Black Lake, I think that in a few short days an entirely new class of eleven-year-old witches and wizards will soon be crossing it in the very same boats that so many of you once did, ready to start a new chapter of their lives.</p><p>You are doubtless already aware of the opinion piece entitled <em>The Boy Who Lived Will Come to Hogwarts: But What Will He Find There?</em> in yesterday’s edition of <em>The Daily Prophet</em>, where Rita Skeeter, class of ’69, wrote that Harry Potter, The Boy Who Lived, will be one of the students beginning a new life at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry on September first.  She used this opportunity to write yet another impassioned critique of the school and its leadership, saying that any new pupil would arrive at ‘a creaking, overfunded institution grown bloated on an endless stream of galleons’, led by a ‘senile and insufferable dullard, blinded by his own ideologies’.  Firstly, we are glad that our alumni have such a strong connection to their alma mater, and that years after they have graduated, Hogwarts continues to be an important part of their lives and at the forefront of their thoughts.  I must also add that while Hogwarts will keep its policy on not publicly commenting on any individual student’s academic performance, we can confirm that Mr. Potter will be a part of the class of ’97 after a childhood spent at a distance from the wizarding world.</p><p>But I would like to invite you, dear reader, to answer Ms. Skeeter’s question.  What sort of school is it that Mr. Potter is returning to?  What has changed in the last decade since he exited the wizarding world?  When Harry Potter enters Hogwarts in a few days’ time, he will find a thriving and diverse academic community of equals.  Gone is the fear, turmoil and violence of the reign of He Who Must Not Be Named.  A muggleborn from Glastonbury may well find themselves sharing a dormitory with a pureblood born and raised in Hogsmeade: a member of the sacred twenty-eight may well have their wand-work corrected by someone who, a few short months ago, was entirely unaware of the magical world. Whatever house Mr. Potter is sorted into, he will find himself belonging to an interconnected community of witches and wizards from across Britain and Ireland.  Students bring so many diverse backgrounds to Hogwarts, and yet regardless of blood status, race, location, or house, we all find ourselves united in courage, intellectual rigour, loyalty, and ambition.  If I as headmaster have one guiding ideology, it is that: for Hogwarts to be a place of tolerance, diversity, and acceptance.  Today’s pupils will be tomorrow’s leaders: as we equip the witches and wizards of tomorrow for their place in the world, these are the values we must install.</p><p>As for Ms. Skeeter’s comments on Hogwarts ‘endless stream of galleons’, alas, would that it were so!  I know that not a year goes by that the press does not comment on the size of the Hogwarts endowment, but we are committed to providing a free education for all regardless of financial means.  Yet there is an endless stream of expenses involved in day to day Hogwarts operations: supplies for students, the hardship fund for those of limited resources, castle repair and maintenance, and, of course, the staffing costs associated with bringing magical Britain’s best and brightest to help shape the next generation of minds.  It is thanks to the donations of loyal parents, alumni, and associates such as yourselves that we are able to keep Hogwarts operating.</p><p>Hogwarts and its mission are essential in the new world of peace we have been forging for the last decade, and your support is needed now more than ever.  If you feel moved to provide for Hogwarts as Hogwarts has provided for you or those you love, you would have the sincerest thanks of both the staff and I if you returned a Gringotts-Cashable cheque by owl post to:</p><p>          The Office of Fundraising and Development<br/>          Sixth Floor, The Eastern Tower<br/>          Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry<br/>          Scotland</p><p>Please note that we cannot accept donations in coins at this time, and if you wish to donate artwork or powerful magical artefacts, we would invite you to get in touch with us to arrange an assessment of the item’s value.</p><p>I look forward to the flurry of owls that Ms. Skeeter’s articles on my leadership always send my way, and to welcoming many of your children to Hogwarts as the new academic year begins.</p><p>Yours warmly,</p><p>
