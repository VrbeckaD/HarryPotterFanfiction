    <p align="justify">There‘s a bang from Harry‘s room and Tom is up immediately. He casts a Tempus and sighs.</p>
<p align="justify">„Harrison!“</p>
<p align="justify">„Sorry, father!“</p>
<p align="justify">It‘s way too early for this, but Tom knows that there‘s no way he‘s going back to bed now. He gets up and puts on a robe. He doesn‘t bother knocking on the door between his and Harry‘s room. Harry knows he‘s coming and, well, it‘s his last chance to do so. He promised Harry that when he comes back for the Yule holidays he‘ll be moved to the next room. One that doesn‘t share a door with his father‘s suite.</p>
<p align="justify">Harry sits on his sofa. The room is still pretty soft (part of the reason why Harry has been complaining about it for at least two years now), but his sofa is a proper one now. He does need to entertain his friends after all.</p>
<p align="justify">Tom frowns when he sees what it is he‘s reading.</p>
<p align="justify">„Why are you reading a third year defense textbook?“</p>
<p align="justify">„Because I got bored with the one for second year.“</p>
<p align="justify">Tom gives him an unimpressed look. Harry smiles at his father, as innocent as he did when he was a baby. But this time Tom is aware that Harry is trying to manipulate him with it. Cunning little snake.</p>
<p align="justify">„And why, pray tell, were you reading the second year textbook? And don‘t you dare say you were bored with the first year one. You are going to the first year, after all.“</p>
<p align="justify">„But father, it‘s all so boring!“</p>
<p align="justify">Tom smiles and sits down so he can easily see at Harry. Harry closes the book and puts it on the table in front of the couch.</p>
<p align="justify">„Have you slept at all, little snake?“</p>
<p align="justify">„How can I? I‘m going to Hogwarts! All my friends are going to Hogwarts! We‘re going to have so much fun! We‘re going to find the Chamber and cheer for Marcus and get to befriend the mermaids.“</p>
<p align="justify">„Be careful with those, little snake,“ an old version of Godrick says from above the fireplace. It‘s an older (or younger, depends on how you look at it) version of the painting in the living room. Harry wanted his grandparents close by and Rick and Sal promised to look after him and not only help him with his mischief if Tom let him have the painting in his rooms. They‘re moving along with Harry‘s things before Yule. Salazar is sleeping in his chair, but Godrick watches them with a smile. „Nasty things, mermaids. They might be your friends, but they won‘t pass an oportunity to drown you.“</p>
<p align="justify">„I know, grandpa Rick,“ Harry rolls his eyes. „I heard that story at least a thousand times.“</p>
<p align="justify">„Good. Maybe you‘ll listen to them, then.“</p>
<p align="justify">„I always listen to them.“</p>
<p align="justify">„You only listen to what mischief you can get up to.“</p>
<p align="justify">Harry opens and closes his mouth before looking sheepishly at his father.</p>
<p align="justify">„I always listen to you?“</p>
<p align="justify">Tom snorts. Yes, Harry is very careful to listen to him, word for word. So that he can carefuly obey the word of the law, but not the spirit. Tom had to get really creative with his intructions.</p>
<p align="justify">Sometimes he worries that Harry is too Gryffindor for him to handle – like when he stole Marcus‘ broom last year to try flying on a „proper broom, father, the child‘s one is laughable“. But then he always knows exactly what to do to keep out of trouble while usually keeping his friends in trouble and Tom stops worrying.</p>
<p align="justify">„Are you packed?“</p>
<p align="justify">Harry looks at him like he just insulted Montrose Magpies. Somehow, without Tom noticing, that team became family-favorite. Which in their weird, patched-together family is saying something.</p>
<p align="justify">„Of course I‘m packed, father.“ Then he lights up. „Can we get breakfast now?“</p>
<p align="justify">„It‘s six in the morning, little snake.“</p>
<p align="justify">„High time we have breakfast, if we want to arrive at the station before everyone else.“</p>
<p align="justify">„You know that‘s not the plan, Harrison. We‘re supposed to meet everyone at the station at ten. That‘s not for another four hours.“</p>
<p align="justify">Harry huffs and slumps back against the sofa. Tom frowns and curls his lip back a little. Harry sighs, but sits properly again.</p>
<p align="justify">„So, what are we going to do until then?“</p>
<p align="justify">Tom watches him for a long moment before getting up.</p>
<p align="justify">„Are you coming?“</p>
<p align="justify">Harry hurries after him, curiosity clear in his eyes. Tom stops in front of the door to the library and turns towards Harry.</p>
<p align="justify">„You ready?“</p>
<p align="justify">Harry‘s eyes lit up. He hasn‘t been allowed in the library since he was five and almost made the circular shelf in the middle of the room fall on him. Tom almost had a heart attack that day and forbidden him to step into the library. He could have an elf fetch him a book or even more books, if he wasn‘t sure what exactly he wanted to read. But wasn‘t allowed in it. Even with an adult assisting him. That rule was added when Harry somehow managed to convince Marcus that he is an adult supervision. Marcus was eleven at the time.</p>
<p align="justify">„Really? I can go in?“</p>
<p align="justify">„Yes. I‘m lifting the ban – as long as you‘re careful with everything and most importantly yourself.“</p>
<p align="justify">„Of course, of course! What are we waiting for? Come on, I still have some space in my suitcase.“</p>
<p align="justify">Tom tries not to regret his decision before even stepping a foot into the library. But he does have a reason why he did it.</p>
<p align="justify">He lets Harry explore for few long minutes. Or more like, he looks for one book in particular while trying to look like he isn‘t searching for anything. Luckily Harry is too excited about all the books he suddenly has at his disposal. Admittadly, most of these books are in old languages Harry doesn‘t speak. But he knows that his father keeps copies of most of them in modern English – or whatever the modern equivalent of the original language is. For a lot of languages it means English, because they were spoken on the British Islands but died out. But Harry knows that there are some books in old French or Spanish, too.</p>
<p align="justify">Finally, he finds what he was looking for. He lets Harry explore some more – Harry obviously has some of Salazar‘s tendencies to jump from one thing to another without a thought to people following him. When he was a baby, Tom thought he might grow out of it. Later, he worried if it won‘t make making friends harder for Harry. But it doesn‘t – Harry seems to pull in all the children Tom ever invited for a playdate. He hoped that Harry and Theo, Emory‘s grandson Harry‘s age, would become close friends. But Emory and his son are not close and so Emory doesn‘t really have a say about who Theo plays with, so that didn‘t happen.</p>
<p align="justify">It was young Malfoy Harry befriended instead. Tom wasn‘t excited about that at first. Even at two years Draco was something of a spoiled brat. Tom suspected that Lucius and Narcissa allowed him to play with Harry only because of who Tom is. But it doesn‘t matter anymore – may it be Harry‘s own influence or Lucius and Narcissa realizing that they can‘t spoil endlessly their heir. Or maybe it‘s the fact that when Draco was four, he got a little sister. But Draco Malfoy grew up to be a fine young man. Tom enjoys his company and is glad that Harry has such a good friend in him nowadays.</p>
<p align="justify">„Come on, Harrison. Let‘s get breakfast.“</p>
<p align="justify">„But father-“</p>
<p align="justify">„If we still have time after we get everything ready, you can come back. Now come, I want to give you something.“</p>
<p align="justify">In the family dining room there‘s already a breakfast waiting for them. Silently, Tom sends his thanks to Nodby in the kitchen. One of the amazing things about living in a truly magical home is that a lot of things are done almost intuitively, as long as you let your magic flow.</p>
<p align="justify">There‘s another painting in the dining room. This one is of all the founders. Turns out the vault at Gringotts with the paintings had a lot of those. Gaunts didn‘t like the reminders that Salazar wasn‘t the biggest wizard fighting against smaller witches and wizard standing in his way. The truth is, the founders became a family. Tom even found one painting of Rowena with her husband and three children in the vault. He gifted it to Hogwarts. Nowadays that painting teaches history to first two years there.</p>
<p align="justify">As they come in Rowena and Salazar are bickering over something. Tom groans.</p>
<p align="justify">„Enough you two. It‘s way too early for me to listen to you two.“</p>
<p align="justify">„Good morning, grandpa Sal, grandpa Rick, aunt Helga, aunt Rowena.“</p>
<p align="justify">„Good morning, Harry,“ they chorus and settle in their chairs. „Are you excited for your first year at Hogwarts?“ asks Helga with a soft smile.</p>
<p align="justify">„Of course! We‘re going to have so much fun! Uncle Rick says there‘s lots of secret passages all around the castle that we can find! And some even leading out of the castle!“</p>
<p align="justify">„Yes, but you aren‘t going to take those ones, are you?“ Godrick asks with somewhat nervous smile sent Tom‘s way. Tom sends him a nasty look. He knew that all this mischief is Rick‘s fault!</p>
<p align="justify">„Well, not once I know they lead outside Hogwarts. Grandpa Sal, tell me about the common room.“</p>
<p align="justify">Salazar laughs.</p>
<p align="justify">„Why would I tell you when just in few more hours you‘re going to be sitting right there?“</p>
<p align="justify">Tom relaxes back and lets the bickering of his family wash over him. With a thought he pours himself a cup of tea. The discovery of Slytherin castle helped restore a lot of other manors back to their glory. Many people already forgot that wizarding homes used to intuitevely obey their lord‘s wishes all the time. The fact that Tom let many scholars visit his castle opened a whole new branch of magic. Or rather, reminded them of that branch of magic and so they activated it again.</p>
<p align="justify">They made marvelous progress in these last almost ten years, but there‘s still a lot to do.</p>
<p align="justify">„Harrison,“ Tom speaks softly, but the attention of the room turns to him. „If you‘re bored with your course books, maybe this will help keep you busy.“</p>
<p align="justify">He pushes the book he picked up in the library towards Harry. Harry‘s eyes sparkle as he takes it in and carefully pulls it closer to himself.</p>
<p align="justify">„<em>Introduction to Parselmagic by Salazar Slytherin.</em>“</p>
<p align="justify">Tom smiles as Harry hisses out the name of the book.</p>
<p align="justify">When he adopted Harry, Nagini went to hybernating. When she woke up that spring, Tom introduced her to his son. She took to looking after him. At first, Harry seemed to almost not notice the big snake slythering everywhere he goes. But then one day, when they were in the living room, Tom, Emory, and Corvinus talking about Wizengamot bussiness, Nagini curled around Harry, hissing out softly. Tom was about to tell her to give him space, when Harry giggled, petted her, and hissed what a nice pet she is. Tom just sat there for long minutes. It took Aguamenti from Emory to wake him up.</p>
<p align="justify">As if she senses that Tom thinks about her (which is entirely possible, taken their familiar bond) Nagini slythers into the room.</p>
<p align="justify">„<em>Are you already taking him away from me?</em>“</p>
<p align="justify">Nagini is not happy that Harry is leaving for Hogwarts.</p>
<p align="justify">„<em>Not for another few hours, my dear. If you want to entertain him in the meantime, feel free to </em><em>do so</em><em>.</em>“</p>
<p align="justify">With a smile he watches as Nagini makes her way to Harry, circling his waist and resting her head on Harry‘s shoulder. Harry doesn‘t flinch, simply offers her his bacon.</p>
<p align="justify">He‘s going to miss the boy. But Harry is off to a great adventure and Tom can‘t wait to hear everything about it. He knows Harry is ready, he prepared him himself.</p>
<p align="justify">But that doesn‘t make the hole in his heart that Harry will leave behind any smaller.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="center">***</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">Harry frowns as he steps out of the fireplace covered in ash. He concentrates a bit before smiling at the way the ash falls down. No need to touch his wand. Growing up in a castle sensitive to magic has its perks. Even though other manors in England took up the same magic work, their lords are still learning to use it and their children and heirs are mostly helpless at it. Not Harry. He took to the castle the same way he took to Tom – with surprising ease, as if he was born to do that.</p>
<p align="justify">Not that Harry is much aware of that. He just knows that his father always did some little things without a wand, so he learned to do them, too.</p>
<p align="justify">He looks around the empty station.</p>
<p align="justify">„See? Not even the train is there yet!“</p>
<p align="justify">Harry turns slightly to the left to see his uncles, lord Nott and Theodore Flint, and his cousin, Marcus Flint. They‘re not technically a family, there‘s no blood between them. But they‘ve been to Slytherin Castle so often and Marcus has been babysitting him ever since he can remember. They‘re family.</p>
<p align="justify">„Hey, Mark.“</p>
<p align="justify">„Hi, squirt. How do you feel?“</p>
<p align="justify">Harry pushes back the desire to bounce on his feet, but allows himself to smile wildly at his friend. They are in public, but they‘re alone, after all. He‘s too excited for words.</p>
<p align="justify">„He woke me up at six,“ draws out his father.</p>
<p align="justify">„I did apologize for that. Aunts Helga and Rowena send their wishes of good luck and grandpa Rick says to go easy on the Wood boy. Grandpa Sal says you should crush him.“</p>
<p align="justify">Marcus‘ smile turns nasty.</p>
<p align="justify">The fireplace behind them heats up and they all turn to watch the Malfoys walk out of it. Lucius Malfoy is the first to come out and he quickly moves his wand to get rid of the ash on his robes. Draco is right behind him. He steps away from the fireplace, before frowning hard. Narcissa leaves the fireplace with Draco‘s younger sister, Lyra. She moves her wand to clean her and Lyra‘s robes and sets her lips into a thin line.</p>
<p align="justify">„Draco-“</p>
<p align="justify">But Harry pushes his magic against Draco‘s and the boy‘s robes are clean. Draco sighs, but nods at Harry.</p>
<p align="justify">„Thank you, Harry.“</p>
<p align="justify">Harry nods cordially back. He wants to hug his friend and yell and jump with him – they are going to Hogwarts! But they‘re in public and their fathers wouldn‘t approve. So instead he turns to the woman and the girl whose hand she holds.</p>
<p align="justify">„You look lovely as always, lady Malfoy. Lyra, I like what you‘ve done with your hair.“</p>
<p align="justify">Lyra grins at him toothily, her two front teeth missing. She has the blonde hair of Malfoys, but hers isn‘t straight as the rest of her family‘s. She inherited her late aunt Bella‘s curls. Harry is not sure what exactly she did to accomplish it, but he sees sparks in them with her every move. It‘s enchanting and playfull. Her robe is not as luxurious as the rest of her family‘s, but it‘s still made from a nice fabric. She has a heart-shaped face and bright blue eyes also inhereted from her Black side. A charming little girl, who‘s always following her brother behind.</p>
<p align="justify">Her mother nudges her lightly and Lyra straightens.</p>
<p align="justify">„Thank you, Harry, that‘s very kind of you. I see you took the potion correcting your eyesight. It‘s lovely to see you without your glasses.“</p>
<p align="justify">Narcissa sighs and Harry and Draco stiffen their giggles.</p>
<p align="justify">„Very well, Lyra. But commenting on such a change is better done in private.“</p>
<p align="justify">Lyra pouts as she looks around.</p>
<p align="justify">„But there‘s no one else here! So we are in private.“</p>
<p align="justify">The fireplace activates again and Narcissa kneels down to explain to Lyra that in public, you simply compliment a little detail you noticed about your friend – a new robe or a new haircut is always a safe bet. You don‘t talk about big changes that are private unless you want to draw attention to whatever flaw they were correcting.</p>
<p align="justify">Out of the fireplace step the Goyles – first mister Goyle, then Gregory Goyle, and finally misses Goyle. Harry doesn‘t really know mister and misses Goyle – Greg doesn‘t talk about them and they usually just leave Greg to come to the Slytherin Castle on his own. Harry thinks that they used to visit when he was really young, but suspects that father doesn‘t feel that warm towards them. That doesn‘t mean much, though. He suspects father doesn‘t really like Lucius and Narcissa either and he does invite them over for dinner every once in a while. Sometimes they even stay in the castle for the night.</p>
<p align="justify">Never in the family wing, like uncles Theodore, Emory, and Corvinus do. Even Rabastan with his family sometimes stays in the family wing, but never Malfoys. The elders, that is. So far Draco has always been permitted to stay in Harry‘s room. They are children, after all.</p>
<p align="justify">„Goood morning, Greg.“ This time it‘s Draco who speaks up. „How are you feeling today?“</p>
<p align="justify">Greg grunts something and Draco rolls his eyes, careful so the adults don‘t see. Greg takes his place by Draco‘s right side. Draco‘s face turns to a mask, but Harry can see the annoyance behind it. He sends him a quick smile – just few more hours.</p>
<p align="justify">The adults are talking among themselves – the Goyles with lord Malfoy and father with his uncles. Marcus seems annoyed to be there so early. He stepped away, leaning against a wall few steps to the side. Harry moves closer to him.</p>
<p align="justify">„So, Marcus-“</p>
<p align="justify">„I‘m not telling you babies anything about sorting.“ Harry pouts and Marcus snorts. „Look, squirt, not only would your father kill me for ruining the surprise, but I‘m pretty sure your grandparents would actually come back as ghosts to haunt me. I still can‘t believe they came up with it and refused to tell us anything.“</p>
<p align="justify">„And by us, you mean you.“</p>
<p align="justify">„Obviously I mean me.“ He smirks at them. „I hope you two keep practicing. Our seeker is in seventh year this year, so we‘re going to need you next year, Draco.“</p>
<p align="justify">„And I‘ll be ready, captain.“ Draco‘s smirk is wicked, but also wider than it usually is. It has the tendency to do so when talking about quidditch. „What do you think our chances are this year?“</p>
<p align="justify">Because there‘s no question about whether or not they‘re going to be sorted into Slytherin. After all, they grew up with the founders talking to them. They know where they belong.</p>
<p align="justify">The fireplace activates again and this time, it‘s the child who comes out first. Pansy quickly moves her wand to clean her robes. Then she smiles sweetly at the adults.</p>
<p align="justify">Her robes are in dark blue with silver details. She has everything perfectly in place, just as she‘s due taken her status as an heiress. Her hair, so long it reaches her waist when let down, is done in a braid that circles her head like a crown. Harry knows how annoyed she gets with her hair. While he learned the little wandless tricks all his childhood, Pansy concentrated on miriard of little charms meant to braid her hair as soon as she got her wand.</p>
<p align="justify">While Hogwarts official recommendation is to buy a wand the summer before first year, none of their parents listened to that – they all got wands on their ninth birthday. Proper wands, made for them and no one else, not the ones Ollivander sells. They went to the Knockturn Alley for it.</p>
<p align="justify">„Good morning, lord Slytherin, lord Nott, lord Malfoy, lady Malfoy, mister Flint, mister Goyle, misses Goyle. Good morning, Harry, Marcus, Draco, Greg.“</p>
<p align="justify">„Good morning, heiress Parkinson.“ Harry‘s father is famously fond of Pansy, so Harry is not surprised to find him amused now. „Wherever have you left your parents?“</p>
<p align="justify">„In the hall of our home, lord Slytherin.“ Pansy‘s playfull smile is not entirely contained by the mask she attempts to raise. As she says that the fire roars again and out step in quick succession lord and lady Parkinson.</p>
<p align="justify">„Pansy!“ lady Parkinson snaps at her. Pansy turns her smile at her mum.</p>
<p align="justify">„Yes, mother?“</p>
<p align="justify">Lady Parkinson just sighs and turns to greet the adults. Pansy happily skips to Draco and Harry.</p>
<p align="justify">„Finally! I‘ve been trying to get them into the fireplace and out of the house for fifteen minutes already! I have my suitcase with me, obviously, so there was no reason for us not to leave, but they just kept coming up with one!“</p>
<p align="justify">Harry notices Marcus muttering something and turning somewhat away from them. He doesn‘t mind. Pansy‘s nervous chattering can get on one‘s nerve.</p>
<p align="justify">„Where‘s the train? Where‘s Vincent?“</p>
<p align="justify">„It‘s still too early for the train.“</p>
<p align="justify">„And you know how Vince is. Wanna bet he‘s still packing?“</p>
<p align="justify">„No bet,“ answer Pansy and Draco as one. Harry glares at them. He misses the times when they were gullible and he was able to win a dessert off of them. Granted, that happpened only like twice with each of them before they started thinking about their bets with Harry, but still. He liked those times when he got two desserts and they got none.</p>
<p align="justify">„Have any of you seen Millicent lately?“</p>
<p align="justify">Harry watches as Draco and Greg both shake their heads.</p>
<p align="justify">„Father says that her parents want her to focus on her studies.“</p>
<p align="justify">Pansy snorts. Harry glares at her.</p>
<p align="justify">„I‘m sorry, but Millie isn‘t the quickest broom in the shed. I like her, but that‘s just a fact.“</p>
<p align="justify">„Well, if we help her, maybe she‘ll be able to spend more time with us again.“</p>
<p align="justify">Harry likes Millicent. She‘s always been quiet and never really that excited about his schemes, but she was loyal to a bone and long time ago, Harry started to think about her as one of his people. They spent a lot of time together before their lectures started. After that they didn‘t have that much time, they all were busy with their private tutors, but Millicent was the one who was truly left behind. The rest of them still got together semi-regularly. Their parents always supported their friendship, but the Bulstrodes didn‘t seem to find it that important.</p>
<p align="justify">The fire activates once more just as the sound comes. Harry just glances towards the fireplace to check that it is the Crabbes that are coming before joining his friends in coming closer to the track.</p>
<p align="justify">The train comes and Harry feels the excitement. He never traveled by train before.</p>
<p align="justify">Harry spares some of his concentration on keeping still. The energy in him wants him to jump around and hug his friends, but even though they‘re alone they‘re still in public and it‘s not proper to behave like that. He might not be the heir (not yet, anyway), but he still has a family to represent.</p>
<p align="justify">Suddenly, someone hugs him from behind and lifts him up. Harry yells out and he can feel his magic reacting. The result is that both he and his assaulter find themselves on the floor.</p>
<p align="justify">„Damn, little man. I always forget that you are actually powerful.“</p>
<p align="justify">Harry turns around and glares at Rabastan.</p>
<p align="justify">„What were you thinking?“</p>
<p align="justify">„What? Can‘t I hug my favorite little wizard?“</p>
<p align="justify">„What are you doing here, Rabastan?“ Father sounds annoyed, but when Harry looks back to check on him he doesn‘t look really annoyed. More like the fond, pretend annoyed father sometimes does when he wants to seem stern.</p>
<p align="justify">Harry knows that his father can get really annoyed. It‘s better not to cross him then.</p>
<p align="justify">Rabastan sighs and helps Harry stand up, adjusting his own robes so they fit him well. It‘s his healer‘s robes, Harry realizes.</p>
<p align="justify">„My shift just ended and I realized that you said that you‘re coming here an hour early, so I fiigured I‘d stop by to say bye to Harry. Sorry, little man, I have to hurry home. Lord Crouch expects Barty in the office in an hour.“ He rolls his eyes. „But really, Harry.“ He grows serious, setting one hand on Harry‘s shoulder and using the other to mess with his hair. „By Merlin, when did you grow so big? That‘s not going to happen to Rosie, is it?“</p>
<p align="justify">Rose is a five year old girl Rabastan and Barty adopted just three months ago. The ministry found her on scene of an explosion, with signs of physical abuse. Two corpses were found nearby, identified as her muggle parents.</p>
<p align="justify">She‘s a quiet girl, doesn‘t talk at all. When someone uses magic around her she flinches. Harry is never sure what to do around her, but both Barty and Rabastan seem to adore her.</p>
<p align="justify">The fireplace lits up and on the other end of the hall a small family walks through the entrance from the muggle world. Tom steps closer to his son.</p>
<p align="justify">„Rabastan. Time to go.“</p>
<p align="justify">Rabastan sighs and once more squeezes Harry before letting him go.</p>
<p align="justify">„Have fun, Harry. And write to me!“</p>
<p align="justify">„Sure, Stan,“ Harry grins at him. „Say hi to Barty and Rosie for me.“</p>
<p align="justify">Rabastan grins at him before taking few steps back and apparating. Harry didn‘t realize they‘re this close to the apparation point.</p>
<p align="justify">„This boy,“ sighs uncle Emory, shaking his head. „I swear this boy will never grow up. I had my hopes for the adoption, but it seems that once again they will remain unfulfilled. Come on, children. Let‘s get you settled in before the convoy with the boy-who-lived arrives.“</p>
<p align="justify">Now that‘s an interesting story. One that Harry himself didn‘t know until his eleventh birthday.</p>
<p align="justify">Harry knew the story of Christopher Potter, the boy-who-lived. He knew about the war, in theory, and how terrible Voldemort was. He knew that Christopher Potter is now hailed as the savior of the light. And he knew that his father leans more towards the dark. His father always answers his questions and tries to explain concepts to its fullest.</p>
<p align="justify">But until his eleventh birthday he didn‘t know that his father used to be Voldemort, and he had no idea that he used to be Henry Potter, twin to the boy-who-lived. Or rather, boy-who-lied.</p>
<p align="justify">To be fair to Christopher, that‘s not a fair nickname. Chris was only one year old at the time. Dumbledore was the one who hailed him as the hero, he was the one who proclaimed Henry dead, even though his mother was trying to prove that it was a rushed decision.</p>
<p align="justify">As always, his father was sincere with him when he told him about the war, about Voldemort. When Harry sensed that he‘s not told everything, father honestly told him that there are things he doesn‘t think he‘s ready to hear.</p>
<p align="justify">So Harry knows the whole truth now. Or most of it, anyway. He knows that Voldemort truly was terrible and horrifying. But he also knows that he started with a political agenda that father is still trying to implement now, decades later. But this time, he has his title and the official channels to make it happen. Something he didn‘t have before.</p>
<p align="justify">„Harrison?“ He looks up to see father in the door to the compartment they chose for the journey. It‘s in the middle of the train. Greg and Vince stayed by the door and Harry and Draco took the seats by the window, leaving Pansy sitting between Harry and Greg. „Are you alright?“</p>
<p align="justify">He smiles at him. His father isn‘t one for hugs. Even in private, he usually tenses under the touch. So Harry doesn‘t hug him, even though they‘re still somewhat in private.</p>
<p align="justify">„I‘m fine, father. I‘ll see you for Samhain?“</p>
<p align="justify">Tom‘s face doesn‘t change but something in his eyes softens. In public he wears a glamour over his red eyes – like that they match the light green of Harry‘s eyes. They‘re easier to read, or so Harry thinks.</p>
<p align="justify">„I‘ll see you for Samhain. And I expect owls at least weekly. I got you Nimueh for a reason.“ Nimueh is Harry‘s very own owl. It‘s a simple barn owl, but Harry didn‘t want anything flashy. Easier to go unnoticed like that. „We‘ll be leaving now.“ It‘s apparent that now father talks to the whole compartment. „We‘d love to see you children off, but there‘s a meeting of the Hogwarts Board at noon and me, Narcissa, and Florence need to get ready for that.“ Harry knows all that, obviously, and he thinks that the others do, too. „Have a wonderful year at Hogwarts and don‘t get into trouble.“ In other words – don‘t get caught.</p>
<p align="justify">Father searches his eyes. They exchange one final look, father‘s lips tighten in the barest hint of a smile, before he turns around and leaves. Harry relaxes into the cushion and closes his eyes.</p>
<p align="justify">He‘s so close to leaving for Hogwarts for the very first time he can feel it in his bones.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="center">***</p>

<p align="justify">Half an hour later, he‘s still there and somehow it feels like Hogwarts is further away than thirty minutes ago.</p>
<p align="justify">There‘s chaos at the platform. People from media arrived about twenty minutes ago and it‘s been chaos ever since then. More and more people keep coming in, parents and children yelling at each other. It got so loud that Harry closed the window and Draco pulled the door closed and sent a murmured charm at it. Harry raises his eyebrows at him.</p>
<p align="justify">„Little spell father showed me to make sure I can keep my things to myself. I‘ll show you later.“</p>
<p align="justify">Pansy sighs in annoyance.</p>
<p align="justify">„Have you seen the information the school sent with our letters? It looks like we‘re just going to go over the very basic things our parents showed us ages ago.“</p>
<p align="justify">„Not everyone has the advantage of our parents, Pansy.“ Harry tries to be patient with her. He‘s not fond of her as his father is. He likes her just fine, but lately she‘s been… more annoying. Father says Harry thinks that only because she‘s a girl, but Harry isn‘t sure that‘s entirely true. Pansy has been different every since her ninth birthday. More… giggly.</p>
<p align="justify">„And even those with magical parents – not everyone is willing to teach their children at home.“</p>
<p align="justify">Pansy pouts, but nods.</p>
<p align="justify">„Well, at least we can have fun this year.“</p>
<p align="justify">Harry grins at them. He knows that his father would now say something about staying on top of their studies instead, but really – they can probably do both.</p>
<p align="justify">They all saw each other just last week for lunch at Malfoys‘, so the catch up talk doesn‘t take any time at all. And they‘ve already talked over and over about how they‘re excited about Hogwarts. And they‘re no longer in private. They could pull the curtains on the door to the compartment closed, but they wouldn‘t be able to people watch then.</p>
<p align="justify">So instead they each pull out something to do. With a sigh, Harry passes the book on parselmagic for a quidditch magazine. Pansy also pulls out a magazine (not quidditch one, Harry is sure hers is some version of Witch Weekly for younger girls) and Draco pulls out a book, but neither one of them pays attention to it. Greg and Vince don‘t even bother hiding behind books, they simply look out to the hall, something close to eagerness on their faces. Draco sneers when he sees it, but Harry just rolls his eyes at him and softly kicks him on the shin.</p>
<p align="justify">There‘s a lot of people milling around. Harry sees Daphne Greengrass pass their compartment, not sparing them a glance. If he wasn‘t still so fascinated by the fact that her and Draco have almost the exact shade of blode hair, he wouldn‘t even recognize her. It‘s been years since she last came for a playdate and it didn‘t end well. Admittedly, Harry did push her in the greenhouse so she would fall near a meateating flower. He wanted to see if what Vince said was true – if the flower truly eats people. So yes, that‘s a connection he ruined before he could even read. There‘s a petite brunette hurrying after Daphne. Harry takes good notice of her, if only because the Greengrasses are traditionally Slytherin family, so he‘s probably going to share classes with Daphne and, presumably, with this girl. He doesn‘t see Millicent or Susan Bones.</p>
<p align="justify">Susan was also a girl that came to playdate when Harry was a child. This time, it was not Harry‘s fault that she stopped coming. Father said something about a bussiness he had with her aunt. Now that he knows that father was Voldemort it makes sense – Susan‘s parents, grandparents, and uncle all died during the war. It‘s even said that her father was killed by Voldemort himself.</p>
<p align="justify">It‘s easy to spot the muggleborns in the crowd. They‘re not the only ones wearing the atrocious clothes, but they are the ones looking terrified with parents who keep to themselves. Or rather, the muggles seem to huddle together, with their children as a shield between them and the wizards. Harry sneers when he sees that. Cowards.</p>
<p align="justify">There‘s also a storm of gingerheads coming in about twenty minutes before eleven. Draco is the one to sneer right then.</p>
<p align="justify">„Weasleys.“</p>
<p align="justify">Harry agrees with him. Not only are they clad in… whatever it is muggles call those terrible trousers, but they trully take the platform by a storm. The oldest brother at least tries to keep his integrity, but it‘s hard to do when you have your unshrink suitcase right in front of you and then you need to drag it with you into the train. Have they not heard about shrinking charm? Or, hell, lightening charm?</p>
<p align="justify">The twins seem to be as eager to leave their family behind as their older brother. Harry keeps watching the woman with her two youngest children. With relief he notices that there‘s only one trunk left. Hopefully it means that only one of them is going to Hogwarts this year, not that they‘re too poor to even get a trunk for each of the children. Plus, the youngest Weasley is a girl and girls still get separate rooms from boys at Hogwarts, so that probably wouldn‘t work. They seem to be waiting for someone.</p>
<p align="justify">Harry shakes his head and once again scans the whole crowd. What does he care what the Weasley bunch do? It is a shame that such a respectable family as the Prewetts is now nothing more than the woman who dyes her hair to fit in her own family, but what can you do.</p>
<p align="justify">Finally, it seems like there‘s more people in the train than on the railway. Harry pulls out his wand to cast silent Tempus.</p>
<p align="justify">Just as he does that there‘s a comotion on the platform. All he needs to see is unruly black hair and he turns towards Draco, rolling his eyes. Ten minutes to eleven, the famous boy-who-lived finally arrives. Pansy rolls her eyes and finally starts reading her magazine. Harry hesitates, but then he peers out of the window once again.</p>
<p align="justify">James Potter is not a big man. Harry knows his biological father is bellow avarage in height, because he‘s not as tall as his father was at his age. His father is taller than the avarage man, but thanks to James‘ smaller stature, Harry will never be as tall as his father. Once again something he didn‘t know until shortly after his eleventh birthday. But James is tan and smiling that wide smile with all teeth that Harry always found strange. His hair is as untidy as ever. Harry understands artistic ruffle, but that‘s not what‘s happening with James Potter‘s hair. Harry could respect him for his auror robes (black ones, with the auror office erb emblemed over one‘s heart), except his are not robes any respectable wizard would wear. They‘re wide open, to begin with. And underneath them James has the same muggle clothes the Weasleys wear. Less worn, more expensive looking. But it doesn‘t matter. The emblem of the auror office isn‘t even visible with the way the robe is thrown open.</p>
<p align="justify">He has a firm grip on his son and is already talking to the media. His son‘s smile is just as big and creepy. Just as his father, he‘s not really tall, but his presence somehow makes up for it. It doesn‘t quite fill the room the way father‘s presence does, but it‘s enough to make them appear bigger than they are.</p>
<p align="justify">Christopher Potter is not really what Harry expected. Sure, he saw his pictures in the Daily Prophet (they tend to print them regularly), but somehow they always manage to capture his better side. He‘s always portrayed as a charming young man with killer smile and bright green eyes and Harry can see that in him, but he… well, he expected him to be physically close to him or Draco – lean and slim. Not skinny, because with the food they eat and all the activities they do to keep in shape (their parents insisted they run regularly and build up their stamina. Harry knows that it‘s to help them with duels in the future. And that‘s not even talking about all the things they come up with and do together), but not…</p>
<p align="justify">Christopher Potter is not fat. Not yet anyway. Harry thinks he‘s lacking about 5 kilos before he‘d be able to call him that, though, and that‘s not much. All the photos he saw of him lately, he realizes suddenly, was of him from shoulders up. He has somewhat round cheeks, but it‘s not really screaming fat. His body is a little more… well, he‘s shorter, but bigger than Harry. Once again, Harry doesn‘t want to call him fat, but he is rounder than any child Harry personally knows outside of Vince and Greg. They‘re big and yes, that includes being bigger than Chris Potter in this, too.</p>
<p align="justify">„When did Christopher Potter got fat?“</p>
<p align="justify">Pansy. Harry should have known she wouldn‘t be interested in a gossip magazine for long. Not when there‘s fresh gossip going on just few steps away from her.</p>
<p align="justify">„I wouldn‘t call him fat,“ Draco says carefully. Pansy rolls her eyes.</p>
<p align="justify">„He‘s certainly not keeping in shape as much as a so called savior should. I mean – you guys keep in better shape than him.“</p>
<p align="justify">Harry looks at Draco, who just shrugs. Yes, she does have a point. Harry already explained why that is, but as the hope for the future, shouldn‘t Chris Potter have a training that the other purebloods don‘t have? Pansy doesn‘t run every other day five laps around the quidditch pitch (yes, they have each their own quidditch pitch – they‘re part of their manors/castles, okay?), but she still runs around with them a lot. And Harry knows that other children (Marcus comes to mind, but he‘s not sure if he counts, considering that he likes to spend extra time training quidditch) also have a training regime since they started their lessons at age five. Also, Harry suspects that the way they eat has something to do with how fit they are, with the way their parents insisted on packing them lunch for the train. They are allowed to buy something from the cart in the train, of course, but not the food for the whole day.</p>
<p align="justify">„How come the news never mention things like that? You know, the actually interesting things?“</p>
<p align="justify">„Because the Daily Prophet is basically a propaganda piece and magical Great Britain basically doesn‘t have an alternative to it?“</p>
<p align="justify">Pansy theatrically raises her magazine.</p>
<p align="justify">„That‘s a rag, not a newspaper.“</p>
<p align="justify">Pansy sneers at them, but then giggles escape her.</p>
<p align="justify">„What about Quibbler?“</p>
<p align="justify">Harry and Draco exchange another look.</p>
<p align="justify">Quibbler‘s editor in chief is technically Draco‘s uncle, considering that Draco‘s aunt married him. Draco‘s grandfather, Abraxas, was happy for her, but Lucius Malfoy never really understood why she choose Xenophilius Lovegood to marry when she could have chosen any pureblood wizard. And then she died and Lucius never really made an effort to keep in touch with his brother-in-law and, more importantly, niece. It‘s one of the reasons why Harry‘s father isn‘t really fond of the Malfoys.</p>
<p align="justify">But the thing is, Harry‘s father reads Quibbler. He subscribes to every single newspaper he can find to help them keep on the market (he doesn‘t include Witch Weekly, because that magazine does pretty well, and he did start Seeker Weekly subscribtion when Harry learned to read), but that doesn‘t mean he reads them. But every once in a while, when they sit together in the living room, Harry sees his father actually reading the Quibbler. So it can‘t be complete nonsense.</p>
<p align="justify">Harry settles for a shrug before once again looking out the window. Chris Potter is talking and the people seem to eat it up. Harry sighs and goes back to his magazine. It‘s the newest issue and his father refused to give it to him up until that very morning.</p>
<p align="justify">When the train actually starts moving, he once again casts Tempus and then makes a face at Draco when it shows that it‘s leaving 15 minutes late.</p>
