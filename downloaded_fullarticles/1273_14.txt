    <p>Hermione had been ignoring Malfoy as much as possible for her repeat year, as per usual.  He was still scared of her after that punch and probably still thought she was a filthy Mudblood, she was still slightly scared of (but mostly annoyed by) him after everything… it was a balanced relationship of complete disinterest and disdain.  Without Harry and Ron to stand up for her, she figured it was best to steer clear of him.  Yet, without Harry and Ron around, it seemed like Draco had no reason to be around her anymore, since bugging them was the main reason he was ever in her presence anyway.  She only saw him in Advanced Potions.  She had always felt a bit uncomfortable with sharing Advanced Potions with him even throughout the normal Hogwarts years, and not exactly for the same reasons she was always uncomfortable around him.  It was weird for her to confront the fact that he was actually smart.  Smart, and also ambitious: makes sense for a Slytherin, but it was still somewhat foreign to her to watch him actually work towards something, actually care about something most days out of the week.  She was always scared he would harass her during class, but it never really happened.  They just worked silently and diligently, never really able to forget the other was standing across the room.</p><p>Coming into the classroom from the back, Hermione found herself passing Malfoy’s desk.  She had prepared herself walking up to have to look away and keep her distance, to hope he wouldn’t notice her, but was surprised to find it empty.  He was always the first one to class…</p><p>“Welcome to class, everyone!” Slughorn greeted, taking a moment to glance around the room.<br/>“Well,” he added, noticing Malfoy’s empty desk, “not everyone.”<br/>“Regardless, today we are talking about some of the potions you’ll need to be brewing for your re-administered N.E.W.T.s!  Everyone open your books to page 237…”<br/>Hermione was trying her best to pay attention, but she kept glancing back to Malfoy’s station to see if he had arrived yet.  Who knows what horrible prank he’d pull if he was able to sneak up behind her?  <br/>“Can I help you, Ms. Granger?” Slughorn asked, catching her with her entire head turned back.  She snapped forward to look at him so fast it put a bit of a crick in her neck.<br/>“Er, no, sorry Professor…” Hermione stumbled.  Her face flushed: nothing made her feel more guilty than being caught not paying attention.<br/>“Well, then maybe you can help me!  I was just explaining some strategies for adding Valerian root to your mid-brew Draught of Living Death that can prevent the mixture from creating a rather unpleasant smell.  Could you name one for me?”<br/>Hermione tried to not show her nervousness.  Obviously she had no idea, but she knew she her only chance was to completely wing it.<br/>“Er… well… you could… score the root so the air inside escapes before you add it?” Hermione shrugged, clearly not confident in her answer.<br/>Slughorn frowned. “Actually, that is one of the strategies.  Thought I was going to catch you in that one.  But, I know you made that up because you were obviously not paying attention!”<br/>Hermione sighed.  He was right, but it wasn’t fair.<br/>“With N.E.W.T.s coming up, I really don’t have time to repeat myself every time someone misses something!  You’ll have to stay late tonight to review what you clearly missed.”<br/>“I’m sorry, Professor.  At least working with you privately will offer a great learning opportunity!” Hermione hoped the suck-up would get her some sympathy from him, even if she could basically hear the eyerolls from her fellow students.<br/>“Oh, that reminds me, I can’t actually stay late tonight,” Slughorn suddenly added.<br/>Hermione sighed.  Slughorn was quite an improvement over Snape, but he had some really annoying qualities.  The exact word she was thinking of for him slipped her mind…<br/>“Of course you can’t stay late alone, that’s pretty dangerous,” Slughorn considered quietly.  At that exact moment, Malfoy burst in, looking disheveled and disoriented.  The entire class’ heads whipped around to look at him, as did Slughorn’s.<br/>“Oh!  Perfect timing.  Malfoy, you’ll be staying late as well, since you arrived late.  You and Granger can work together on the assignment you missed!  Yes, that’ll do.”<br/>Malfoy groaned.  Hermione’s head fell into her hands.</p><p>Oblivious.  The word she was looking for was ‘oblivious’.</p><p>As the day ended, the classroom began to empty; However, Hermione and Draco were pinned to their seats, dreading the coming task.<br/>“Well, I never thought I’d be subjecting you two to mandatory extra credit.  You’re my best students!” Slughorn crossed his arms, and Hermione looked down ashamedly. “In a way, it’s an opportunity for both of you, since working together is the only way either of you can work with someone nearly as competent as you.  Aside from working with me.  Of course, I can’t watch you because I have a meeting.  Consider this a chance for student-directed learning!” He seemed proud of himself for re-branding his abandonment of the students as some sort of educational technique.  <br/>As Slughorn was leaving, Hermione was worried to even look at Draco.  When she did, expecting a stare of disgust, she found him staring ahead into nothingness.  She had noticed he looked a bit helter-skelter when he came into class so late, but up-close it was even worse.  Dark circles under his eyes, wrinkled shirt, a disturbing emptiness to his expression.  <br/>“M-malfoy?  Where should we start?” Hermione delicately asked.<br/>Draco stood up and turned to leave suddenly.<br/>“Hey!  Where are you going?” Hermione protested.<br/>“With him gone, there’s nothing keeping us here: we can just leave and he’ll never know,” Draco replied.<br/>“He’ll know because we’ll be useless tomorrow when we are supposed to brew this thing!  He was right that working with each other is our best shot to understand any of this.” Hermione didn’t feel wonderful about having to rely on Malfoy for anything, but she really needed him for this.  <br/>Draco turned around and begrudgingly approached the table.  Hermione sighed in relief.<br/>“Trust me, I don’t want to be here either, but let’s just try to get some work done,” Hermione offered.  Draco only nodded in reply.<br/>The time went by somewhat quickly, even easily.  They worked in silence, and did so with inspiring productivity.  They only interacted when they asked each other to hand them some tool or ingredient.<br/>“Pass me the knife?” Hermione stuck her hand out without looking up, probably not great knife safety.  When she didn’t feel the hilt in her palm, she looked up to see what had Draco so distracted.  She gasped when she saw the knife in his right hand, and a sizeable gash on his left.  <br/>“Oh my-” Hermione instinctively started to get up to tend to the wound, but stopped herself. “Are you okay?”<br/>She looked to his face for a reaction, but he was just staring blankly at the cut, watching a trail of blood slowly spill onto the table.  <br/>“Malfoy?  I’m… going to heal it, okay?” Hermione asked, drawing her wand.  He didn’t look up.<br/>She cautiously drew her wand and cast a quiet Episkey, which sealed the wound quickly.  Draco winced, and it seemed to draw him out of his peculiar trance.  He looked up at Hermione, who was standing beside him with a concerned yet confused expression on her face.  She waited for him to say something, but he just looked at her.<br/>“How… how do you have an accident like that?” Hermione asked, hoping to diffuse tension.<br/>“I… it wasn’t…” Draco tried to answer but wasn’t making much sense.  Suddenly, he got up and began to leave the room.<br/>“What’s going on?  Where are you going?” Hermione pleaded exasperatedly.  <br/>Draco stopped and turned around to face her. “Really none of your business, Granger.  Just leave me alone.  You can figure out the potion just fine on your own.” <br/>Hermione sighed.  He sounded so… tired.  It was like he wanted to insult her, but he was entirely lacking any energy to do so.  When he glanced at his hand for a moment, the realization hit Hermione like a ton of bricks, and she instantly blurted it out.<br/>“Oh god, it wasn’t an accident.” <br/>Draco scowled at her, but Hermione felt sure that he wasn’t angry as much as embarrassed.  She understood, since the last person she would want to know if she was having some crisis would be Malfoy.<br/>“I’m not- I don’t mean to judge you, or something,” Hermione stuttered.  “I really just want to make sure everything is, er, okay.”<br/>“Why would you care about that?” Draco snarled, turning to look away.<br/>Hermione began to respond, but stopped suddenly, because he was right.  Why did she care?<br/>“I just… of course I can’t just let you carve yourself up, while I’m trying to get work done.” Hermione crossed her arms. “If you lose your fingers or something, Slughorn might fail us.”<br/>“Oh.” Draco seemed satisfied, even comforted in some sense, by that heartless answer.  Hermione figured he wouldn’t have believed the truth that she was really just worried about him.  She didn’t believe it herself anyways.  <br/>“Maybe you should go to bed, I can wrap this up, you need to rest.” Hermione was honestly just not prepared for whatever would happen next if she kept hanging around a deranged and confused Malfoy.<br/>Draco just nodded and began to gather his things, and Hermione started putting some ingredients away into the cabinet.  As she was searching for the correct spot for the Infusion of Wormwood, she got that undeniable feeling she was being watched.  She glanced behind her and quickly looked away when she realized Draco was staring at her.  Ignoring it, she kept putting the ingredients away.  Then she heard him step forward, and yelped when she turned around to see him just a few feet away, peering like a cat in the dark.<br/>“Malfoy?” She wasn’t really asking him anything, just continuing her long streak of desperate and unanswered questions.<br/>He stepped forward again, this time undeniably within the general “personal space” range.  He looked at her with an expression that could almost be described as soft.  It was certainly less predatory than Hermione would have anticipated.<br/>When he stepped forward once more, closing most of the gap between them, Hermione gulped and clutched the phials in her arms defensively.  She opened her mouth, but found it dry of words.  She had never seen him this close before, and it made him look like a human optical illusion, as if from one angle he was a threat and from the other he was this good-looking, intelligent boy that any girl with no self-respect would want.  As if he only moved when he was in the corner of your eye.  As if you looked at him from any other perspective, you’d see he was really a shape built of fractured pieces that only looked whole from one specific direction.  <br/>Malfoy delicately placed a hand on the wall beside her face, causing her to flinch.<br/>“Are you scared of me?” He asked, but it wasn’t at all a taunt.  He sounded sad, an emotion Hermione had never truly seen on him before.  He just looked muted, drained at his trial.  She tried to not think about that.<br/>“No,” Hermione replied instinctively, unsure of how honest it was.  On one hand, she really wasn’t… but if the fact that Draco being this close made her heart race meant she was scared, then she certainly was.<br/>Draco leaned forward, slowly but surely bringing their faces closer together.  Hermione almost didn’t say anything, figuring he couldn’t possibly be doing what it seemed like he was.  It wasn’t until he delicately tilted his face that she was willing to consider he actually planned on kissing her.<br/>“What are you doing?” Hermione asked incredulously, wondering internally why she didn’t just slip away through the very open space to her other side.<br/>“Just ask me to stop,” Draco quietly replied, his eyes darting from her own eyes to her lips and back again. “If you want me to stop… just ask me to stop.”<br/>Hermione started to speak, but had no idea what she was going to say.  She just watched him come in closer and closer, and when he closed his eyes, she unexpectedly closed her own in response.  It felt like she was falling asleep, or slipping into a warm bath, or biting into a chocolate she know she shouldn’t have…<br/>As soon as she felt his lip brush against hers, she panicked.<br/>“Stop,” she whispered.  She felt him pull away, and it left her feeling relieved yet disappointed, like waking up just as she was about to drift off, or getting out of the bath when the water is still warm, or spitting out that forbidden chocolate.  She kept her eyes shut, not wanting to deal with the consequences reality tends to bring.  When she finally opened her eyes, Draco had stepped much further away and was compulsively running his hands through his hair.<br/>“Yeah, you’re right, probably for the best,” Draco rushed, breathing through his teeth and nodding a bit feverishly.<br/>Hermione wanted to apologize, but she also wanted to tell him to fuck directly off, but she also wanted to ask him if he really wanted to kiss her or if this was some weird convoluted prank… so she settled on silently watching him pace around.  He gave her one more look, scanning her whole body quickly.  He gave her a nod, and an awkward half-wave, and made his way to the door.  She just watched him, dumbfounded, as he left.  At the archway, he turned back for a moment, and it almost looked like he was going to say something, and it almost looked like his grey eyes were bloodshot and teary.  He waved his hand as if to say ‘nevermind,’ chuckled to himself, shoved his hands in his pockets and disappeared around the corner.<br/>Hermione stood there for a long, long time, reliving the entire experience in her head yet failing still to make any sense of it.</p><p>She felt like she was having an out-of-body experience for most of the rest of her night: she of course had no chance at studying, so she simply got ready for bed and slid under the sheets.  <br/>Closing her eyes and turning off her reading light, she was excited for that wonderful way sleep lets you escape from the questions, the stress, the intrusive thoughts about boys that you definitely hated this morning and yet everything feels so different now but of course it can’t be different and of course he’s still the same person he’s always been but why is he acting so different and why did the way he looked at you make you feel like he was seeing you for the first time and why did you feel more vulnerable when he pulled away than when he was about to kiss you and why did his skin feel so electric against yours and...<br/>Hermione’s stream of consciousness served as her method of counting sheep, and before she even realized, she was submerged under the cover of sleep.</p>
