    <p>Harry stood on the stairs of the Leaky Cauldron, grinning at the sight of his two best friends. Just last night, he had run away from the Dursleys after accidentally blowing up his aunt. Although Marge did deserve it for her wicked insults of his parents, Harry dreaded going back to the Dursleys after the school term ended. He tried to push the thoughts of his Uncle Vernon’s fury to the back of his mind.</p><p>“Harry!” Ron and Hermione exclaimed, finally noticing their friend. Hermione rushed to embrace him in a hug, and Ron clapped Harry on the shoulder.</p><p>“What are you doing here, mate?” Ron asked.</p><p>Harry hesitated for a moment before saying, “Oh, um, I just got here last night.” He would tell them later, when they were in private.</p><p>The three headed towards the table where the rest of the Weasley family sat eating breakfast. Upon seeing Harry, Mrs. Weasley immediately stood up and wrapped Harry in a warm hug.</p><p>“Oh, it’s wonderful to see you, dear. Come eat! You look far too thin,” Molly said, ushering Harry to a seat and piling a plate with food for him. Harry felt his mouth salivate at the mass of eggs, bacon, sausage, toast, and tomatoes placed in front of him. He hadn’t had a meal this large since last term. The Dursleys usually only gave him leftovers from their meals, which he was often the one to cook.</p><p>“Thank you, Mrs. Weasley.” Harry smiled and her and dug into the food hungrily, though he tried to slow down his pace to mind his manners.</p><p>“Good to see you again, Harry,” Mr. Weasley said with a welcoming smile. Harry returned the sentiment before turning back to his friends that sat directly across from him.</p><p>“How’ve you both been?” Harry asked them.</p><p>“Just got back from Egypt. Toured around a lot there this summer and saw Bill. Charlie came, too,” Ron said, nodding his head at the second eldest Weasley brother that sat further down the table. “He’s staying to visit for a few days, before we go back to Hogwarts.”</p><p>Harry glanced at the older boy and was taken aback. Charlie was handsome. He was certainly a Weasley, with bright red hair that came down to his chin. He wore a t-shirt that showed off his muscular arms and chest. His tanned skin was covered in burn scars, some old and some new. Bright blue eyes shined with mirth as he laughed at something the twins had said. It was only when Charlie caught him staring and they met eyes that Harry quickly looked away, suddenly finding his food interesting. He felt the heat of a blush staining his cheeks and he took a bite of his toast.</p><p>Ron didn’t seem to notice as he continued talking excitedly about his trip to Egypt, but Hermione certainly did. She glanced in the direction Harry had been staring in, and a small ‘o’ formed on her lips. She turned back to Harry with a knowing smile. She didn’t say anything though, saving him the extra embarrassment.</p><p>------------</p><p>After breakfast, they went to Diagon Alley to buy textbooks, which was relatively quick. Fortunately, this year’s required books were standard editions, unlike last year’s. Harry inwardly cringed thinking about his last Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Lockhart. He silently wished that this year’s teacher would be better.</p><p>The large group of Weasleys, along with Harry and Hermione, found a cafė on their way back to the Leaky Cauldron to eat lunch at. As the waitress led them to a table, Harry found himself the last to find a seat. He ended up sitting between Hermione and.. None other than Charlie Weasley.</p><p>Harry tried to keep his eyes focused towards Ron and Hermione instead of the handsome man next to him. He was successful until he heard, “Nice to finally meet you, Harry. I’ve heard a lot about you.” Charlie.</p><p>Harry swallowed and smiled at him nervously. “Nice to meet you, too.” Charlie held out his hand, which Harry stared at awkwardly for a second before reaching out to shake it.</p><p>As their hands touched, a blue spark lit up between them, causing them both to flinch in surprise before it seemed to sizzle out. </p><p>Many emotions shot through Harry- surprise, joy, fear, comfort, love, warmth. He couldn’t describe how he felt. It was like something in him had just woken up that he didn’t know existed until now.</p><p> Harry drew his hand back and looked at Charlie with a puzzled expression, which Charlie returned. Harry glanced around to see confusion and shock painted on the faces of everyone around them. He turned back to Charlie and stuttered, “What’s… I don't…” </p><p>He couldn’t say anything more, as Mr. Weasley, the first to regain his composure, suddenly stood and gestured for the rest of the family, along with Hermione, to get up as well. “Why don’t we go back to the Leaky Cauldron…” he said, some shock still lingering on his face. Ron opened his mouth to protest but was cut off by a stern look from his father. Everyone slowly stood up from their seats and followed Mr. Weasley out of the cafė, all of their expressions still a mixture of surprise and confusion.</p><p>The walk back to the Leaky Cauldron was silent, except for some quiet whispers between Mr. and Mrs. Weasley. When they got there, Mrs. Weasley ushered Hermione and her children towards a table to order lunch. All except Harry and Charlie, who Mr. Weasley had stopped with a hand on each of their shoulders. Harry looked up at him questioningly. It seemed the man knew something he didn’t, and it was making him increasingly nervous. </p><p>“Why don’t you two follow me upstairs, boys. I’d like to talk to you both about something,” Mr. Weasley said. It did nothing to ease Harry’s growing anxiety. Had he done something wrong?</p><p>They walked to the room Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were staying in, and Arthur shut the door behind them. “Sit down, boys,” he said, gesturing to the small sofa by the open fireplace.</p><p>As they sat down, Harry spoke up, “Is something wrong, sir?” Mr. Weasley just shook his head silently and rested his chin on his hand.</p><p>After several moments, the man said, “I believe I know what’s going on, but I think we need to speak with Dumbledore to confirm it.” He stood in front of the fireplace and motioned for Harry and Charlie to stand up. He continued, “Say ‘Hogwarts, Headmaster’s Office, seven-five-two-one’. That’s the current password for the floo, if I’m not mistaken.” </p><p>Harry grabbed a handful of floo powder and stepped into the fireplace, reciting Mr. Weasley’s words and throwing the powder onto the floor. With a roar of green fire, he stepped out, greeted by a familiar phoenix cawing softly at him. Harry smiled and walked to where the fiery bird was perched on an intricately carved wooden chair in front of the Headmaster’s desk.</p><p>“Hello Fawkes,” Harry said, petting the phoenix’s soft feathers, to which the bird made happy chirping noises in response.</p><p>Harry heard the roar of the fireplace behind him, and out stepped Charlie, his father stepping out behind him shortly after. </p><p>Soft footsteps made the three look up to see Dumbledore, dressed in purple robes, standing before them. “Hello, Arthur. Harry, Charlie,” he addressed them with a nod. “To what do I owe the pleasure?”</p><p>Harry and Charlie both glanced at each other, neither knowing what to say. Luckily, Charlie’s father spoke for them, “Something happened- I think I know what, but I figured it’d be best to be certain before making any assumptions.”</p><p>Dumbledore nodded and said, “Let us sit down and discuss then.” He led them through a door in the back of his office leading to a sitting room, with plush-looking furniture and large carpets. There were other doors on the other side of the room, likely leading to the headmaster’s personal quarters. Dumbledore sat down on one of the soft, cushioned sofas, and Arthur, Charlie and Harry did the same, sitting on the large couch across from him. “Well, please do explain. What happened?”</p><p>“Well.. there was… I’m not sure how to describe it, exactly,” Arthur struggled to find the words.</p><p>“There was a… spark, when Harry and I shook hands- er, tried to, at least. It didn’t hurt, it wasn’t painful at all. It just felt… strange,” Charlie said, trying his best to explain.</p><p>Something like realization lit up in Dumbledore’s eyes. “This spark, when you say it felt strange, did it also feel... comforting, in a way? Familiar?” Harry and Charlie both nodded, surprised that he understood.</p><p>Harry started, “Sir, what’s going on?” </p><p>Dumbledore chose his words carefully. “If it’s alright with you both, I would like to have Madame Pomfrey look you over. If I’m not wrong… I believe the two of you have just met your soulmate.”</p>
