    <p>In the land of Hogwarts, the long standing Great Human-Wolf War had gone on for centuries. In a stalemate between the two sides since its beginning. Many do not remember how the war began all those centuries ago, but it continued to steadily grow worse. Many villages were being slaughtered for fun and the Kingdom didn't have enough soldiers to spare for them.  </p><p>Blood of the slaughtered, both fighters and innocents, for each side has soaked the country red.</p><p>The Council needed a solution.</p><p>In order for the humans to fight back against their superior enemies, The Hunter's Guild was created by the four best hunter's of the time; Salazar Slytherin, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw, and Godric Gryffindor. A school that would train children who showed excellent skill in becoming Wolf Slayers.</p><p>They would become the hired mercenaries used to decrease the wolf population and protect their assigned villages and towns until they were required to leave. </p><p>One could recognize a slayer by the stench of blood coating their very person, and the insignia of the Hunter's Guild pin upon their lapels.</p><p>The most famous of the Wolf Slayers was Bloody Red, as most called him.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>Sixteen year old Harry Potter gazed around the forest for any unwanted visitors. His red hooded cloak standing out between the trees and brush and heavy with the scent of blood. A basket held in one hand while the other was ready to grab one of his rifles at a moments notice. As he was deep in the forest, no one would come to help should trouble find him.</p><p>Harry reached his destination, a small meadow hidden deep within the forest, and began to pick various fruits and berries to bring back to the Inn he was staying at for the time being. He stopped to check his surroundings every few minutes; not once letting his guard down. Birds chirped loudly and a few deer and their fawns would come to drink from the stream nearby, but Harry wasn't worried about them. It was something else that Harry kept a look out for.</p><p>A hush fell over the forest and Harry was quick to place a hand on one of his rifles.</p><p>The feeling of eyes upon his person that made his hair stand on end, making Harry discreetly move his head side to side, checking his surroundings. It got quiet too fast, meaning a predator was nearby. Most likely a wolf. He didn't see anything, but that didn't mean that something dangerous wasn't stalking him.</p><p>A loud rustle of the bushes and twigs snapping sounded to his left.</p><p>Harry ignored the basket full of fruit and grabbed both weapons and aimed where he thought he was being watched. Listening carefully, he heard nothing. </p><p>A tense moment followed. Harry unlocked the the safety, ready to shoot at any moment.</p><p>"Aren't you a long way from home, Darling?" A voice purred behind him, sending chills down Harry's spine.</p><p>Harry whirled around to aim his two weapons at the intruder and found himself face to face with a handsome man, looking to be in his late twenties, aristocratic features and bright red eyes that gazed at him with intensity.</p><p>Red eyes. Those were the main features to look for a wolf in a human guise.</p><p>He fired.</p><p>
  <em>Bang! Bang! Bang!</em>
</p><p>Harry didn't respond nor ask questions about the wolf's presence. It was kill or be killed when dealing with a wolf. Monsters who were once humans and bitten by another wolf either voluntarily or forced, and over the course of their transformation, the infected would begin to lose their 'humanity' and go on a killing spree.</p><p>Willingly hurting those they once considered family, friends, and lovers. It didn't matter to them as long as they could gain some form of entertainment.</p><p>Harry's goal was to rid the world of these monsters. They killed his father and mother, then years later they took his Godfathers, Sirius and Remus, away from him. They ruined lives. That's why he was known as one of the best Wolf Slayers. This wolf would just be another kill to add to his growing tally.</p><p>The wolf smirked as he dodged the bullets, using his advanced speed to get closer to the smaller male that was aiming to blow his brains out.</p><p>Harry cursed. This wolf was definitely one of the more difficult targets he's had, and he's had some difficult kills before.</p><p>Unfortunately, the wolf got behind him and roughly twisted his right arm back, making him drop his weapon. He tried to raise his left hand behind him and shoot. However, the wolf was faster and gripped his wrist hard until he dropped the other gun.</p><p>"Shit." Harry curses.</p><p>Just his luck. </p><p>The wolf chuckled in amusement. "My, my, such language to come out of that pretty little mouth."</p><p>The wolf nuzzles Harry's neck, breathing in the sent of pine, earth, lilies and...blood.</p><p>"Are you going to kill me?" Harry growls out.</p><p>Harry's gaze roved all over the area as he stood placidly in the wolf's hold. When the monster's hold would lax, that's when Harry would strike. It would just take some patience, timing, and an insane amount of luck. His heartbeat raced and he has no doubt that the wolf could hear it.</p><p>"Perhaps."</p><p>The nonchalant answer makes Harry bristle, but he steadies his breathing. He wants nothing more than to put a bullet in between the wolf's red eyes, but it wasn't time yet.</p><p>"No need to fret, Darling, as long as I find you interesting, you will continue to live. You have my word." The wolf whispers in his ear.</p><p>Harry scoffs. "Forgive me, if I find it hard to believe the word of a <em>wolf</em>."</p><p>The wolf chuckles seductively. "Of course, who wouldn't find <em>The Bloody Red</em> amusing. You, who has the highest kill rate, even more than that fool Albus Dumbledore. And when I saw you alone just now, I couldn't resist in saying Hello."</p><p>"I will kill every single one of you monsters." Harry hissed.</p><p>"Of course, Darling." The wolf answers amused, his lips lightly brushing against Harry's neck.</p><p>"I'm not your Darling!"</p><p>Harry tenses further when the wolf starts to lightly kiss the junction between his neck and shoulder.</p><p>"W-what are you doing!?" </p><p>This was sexual harassment! And probably a type of psychological warfare! Now Harry really wanted to shoot him!</p><p>"You smell so wonderful. I could just eat you up."</p><p>Harry yelped in surprise when the wolf latched upon his neck and began sucking hard. He can't help but gasp in pleasure and pain, but immediately regrets it. If it wasn't for him currently being immobilized by the wolf, Harry would've grabbed his guns and put bullet holes through the other. </p><p>The wolf gives one last lick to the hickey before moving away to see his work. The dark mark stands out against pale and flawless skin. "Mine," he whispers into Harry's ear.</p><p>The possessive undertone makes Harry shiver in fear. He's never met a wolf quite like this. "Who are you?"</p><p>"Lord Voldemort."</p><p>The wolf - <em>Voldemort </em>- once again nuzzles his neck and Harry can't help but wish it was over. Of all the bloody wolves to meet, it had to be Voldemort. The strongest and most powerful wolf ever to control the wolf packs since Gellert Grindelwald. No one had ever met Voldemort and survived long enough to meet him a second time. Many hunters had succumbed to their fatal wounds inflicted by the Alpha after warning the Guild about their encounters. </p><p>"Voldemort?" Harry whispers in fear. He doesn't even know if he is going to make it out alive. No matter, Harry will die fighting, its just who he is. </p><p>"No need to worry, like I said earlier, I won't kill you as long as you continue to hold my attention." Voldemort leans in closer to Harry's ear and whisper. "And believe me, you will never lose my attention. You are mine forever. No matter where you run or hide, I <em>will </em>find you. You. Are. Mine."</p><p>Before Harry could respond, the firm grip that held him is gone. It only takes a few seconds to register that he isn't being held down anymore to quickly grab his weapons to aim back at Voldemort. </p><p>Only the wolf is no longer there. </p><p>Harry doesn't stay a minute longer, quick to grab his basket and leave the forest.</p><p>Feeling Red eyes watching him even as he leaves the forest into the nearby village.</p>
