  <em>31.7.1980, St. Mungo’s</em>
</p><p>James Potter was sitting at Saint Mungo’s hospital next to his wife and their newborn daughter.<br/> <br/> “We have a daughter! I can’t believe our Harry is a girl”, James said. He was excited even though he had been waiting for a boy.<br/> <br/> “What are you guys going to name her?” James’ best friend Sirius asked from the door.<br/> <br/> “Hey Pads, Moony, Wormtail!” James greeted his friends happily.<br/> <br/> Lily smiled tiredly. “Emerald. Her name is Emerald Mae Anastasia.”<br/> <br/> “Does she have your eyes?” Remus asked Lily while moving closer to the bed.<br/> <br/> “Yes she has! I was hoping that she would have my eyes and Lily’s hair”, James laughed. “I still hope she doesn’t inherit my hair.”<br/> <br/> Everyone laughed. The Potter hair that James had inherited from his father was terrible. It couldn’t be tamed. Lily had tried, many times but it just didn’t want to stay tamed.<br/> <br/> “By the way! Sirius, we want you to be the godfather!” James shouted excitedly.<br/> <br/> “Really?” Sirius asked, glancing at Lily. He was a bit unsure.<br/> <br/> “Really Sirius”, Lily chuckled. “Alice is the godmother as she is my best friend so it’s just right.”<br/> <br/> Sirius grinned happily and asked if he could hold <em>Emmie, his goddaughter</em> and Lily couldn’t find it in her heart to say no even though Sirius probably wasn’t the most trustable person when talking about a baby. James looked happy, Sirius looked happy and even Remus was smiling happily. No one noticed Peter’s angry, almost smug expression.</p>
