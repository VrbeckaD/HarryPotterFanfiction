  <strong>Hermione</strong>
</p><p>Not him. Never Him.</p><p>I almost find myself falling from the roof when I see him enter, the butter beer I’d downed earlier at the Three Broomsticks, like acid in the back of my throat as I watched him surrounded by the Death Eaters inside. I knew what was happening and why we were following him, but I just couldn’t bring myself to believe it was really true. He said he wouldn’t, he promised me.</p><p>I slide down and launch myself to the ground, with the help of a convenient and well-fixed gutter.</p><p>“Hermione, no!” Ron and Harry leap to the ground behind me, their landings are slightly easier as they’re taller, but they realise what my plan is and reach out for me a second too late as I take flight, their pleas and grasps are lost in the sound of my heartbeat slamming through my ears as I race ahead, leaving them behind. The only sound I can hear is that of my plimsols smacking through the wet cobbles behind Diagon Alley, as I head through the rat run of streets towards Borgin and Burkes. The roof we’d been perched on was close to the shop, but further away than I thought.</p><p>Drenched by a downpour of heavy rain, my best friends are tailing me, and I have no choice, I turn on them, wand in hand and shout. “Don’t follow me! I'm sorry, Confundo!” I know I have no choice but to send a spilt Confundus charm, its lightning strike hitting them both between the eyes. They can’t know how I feel about him, they mustn’t, and I watch my best friends both stare at each other blankly before bumping into each other and falling over, muttering curiously as they fall to the floor. There’s no time to worry about them, they’ll be fine in a few hours, but someone else, however, is digging himself into a deeper hole.</p><p>“No! He can’t, he can’t do this!” I voice as I run, my chest heaving and blood pounding through my ears.</p><p>I reach the heavy black wooden shop door and I stop, unsure what to do. Death Eaters are inside, and they’ll hit me with an Avada, as soon as look at me, but I won't let him become one of them. I inch open the door, brushing my rain-soaked hair out of my eyes and hit the bell with a silencing spell. I don’t have the luxury of owning a cloak like Harry’s, so I’m relying on the fact no-one is down on the ground floor. There’s no sign of Mr. Borgin, nor anyone else, so I tentatively step over the threshold.</p><p>As I step onto the stairs towards the upper level, I hear his voice and my heart clenches. He’s said he’ll take the cabinet and he’s asking how to fix one. I close my eyes, and gulp as I know exactly which one he’s speaking of.  We’d been there, in the room of requirement, the first time we told each other I love you.</p><p>………………………………………………………………………..</p><p>I hate him! Merlin’s sodding, beard, I could curse him for just being alive! Yet again, I only have to walk alone through the halls towards to the bloody common rooms and I have Slytherin jibes. But Malfoy is the worst, tailing me as the other snakes grow bored and go back to their chatter, some other poor passing student at their mercy. I thought by the fifth year we’d be more mature, that we’d have got past this ridiculous crap.</p><p>Harry’s at Quidditch practice and Ron’s probably somewhere stuffing his face, or avoiding any new decree set out by Umbridge, as per usual. And me? I just want to walk the halls of the school I love and read my book, it’s the only free time I get to myself, apart from studying and the DA. Things are bad enough here without having Malfoy shadowing my every move.</p><p>“So, you think you can just walk away from me, Granger?” Malfoy spits malevolently as I try to ignore him. He’s close, barely a foot away, and I feel anxiety run through my body and tense as I turn the corner into a dim and empty corridor, blanching as I realise there’s no one else there. In all my years at Hogwarts I've always tried to avoid being left alone, being alone leaves me in danger, like right now.</p><p>He’s still behind me and I feel a tug on my hair. However much I've been bullied in the past, no one had ever actually reached out and touched me, well, never without using magic. I stop and draw my wand, thinking of the Avis curse I’d recently read about, a defensive spell. Malfoy must be charged with finding out where the DA meetings are, it's the only reason for him to follow me at all, I know he's one of Umbridge’s flunkeys. I cringe at his touch, fully expecting him to yank a lock of my hair from the root.</p><p>I take my time to turn slowly. This could be it for me. This could be the moment Malfoy decides to bugger the rules and use an unforgivable on best known muggle born witch in the school. Everyone who has any common sense knows that Voldemort is back, Harry told them, most still don’t believe him, but the snakes would know he was, wouldn’t they? It would be easy enough for the Dark Lord to prey on the children of Death Eaters and have them do his bidding.</p><p>“I wouldn’t do that if I were you.” I find myself saying, with more conviction than courage. He's so close behind me I can feel the heat of his breath on my neck. I turn back towards him and he's not looking at my face like I expect him to be, in fact, he has a lock of my hair in his hand, and drops it instantly, but not before I miss the look of longing in his eyes as he glances at me. His relaxed demeanour changes instantly, swirling grey eyes freezing to ice in an instant as he stiffens.</p><p>I feel a jolt of something I can't name in my lower stomach as he lets go, my hair settling back into place in its own unruly way.</p><p>“Err, I…” He begins, and I stare in disbelief at the blooming blush high on his cheekbones, my gaze drops to his side and his free hand twitches before clenching into a fist. His wands nowhere in sight and he doesn't call me Mud blood, or filthy, or whatever vindictive words made me punch him a few years back.</p><p>My wand is still pointed at him, and I’m tense a I wait for his retaliation.</p><p>His tongue darts out to wet his lips under my cool stare and I shake my head slightly, giving him a look of disbelief. This seems to wake him from whatever stupor he's in and his body is tense again. “J-just don’t do that again, Granger.” He stutters before turning on his heel and stalking away.</p><p>Do what? Were we having a totally different conversation? I've never heard the Malfoy heir stammer, and I really have no idea what that weird encounter was about, but my mind is buzzing, and I find it hard to focus on my book as I head back to the dorm.</p><p>........</p><p>There’s too much going on and I can’t concentrate on anything. Harry’s been absent, disappearing and returning at odd times of the day and night, and Ron’s his usual self, mucking around in the common room instead of studying. Ginny’s around somewhere but probably engrossed in the romantic dramas of other friends, like how they'll ever find a way to kiss their boyfriends again, because that's the most important thing to worry about when Cedric lost his life only a few months ago.</p><p>I draw into myself, just reading and concentrating on my homework. Days, even weeks of term pass and none of my friends seem to have much time for me, so I’ve spent my time in the library watching Malfoy since that weird encounter. I tried to tell Harry about it, but he was distracted and I'm not sure he even heard me.</p><p>Malfoy doesn’t act like he hates me anymore, in fact, he avoids looking at me at all, which is just perfect apart from the fact it unnerves me. The other Slytherins jeer every time I pass, but he just stares or looks away, reluctant to meet my eye. Every time I leave the great hall, I feel his eyes on me and I know he’s watching. I trapped him once when I deliberately left a book on the table and had to return for it, he only manged to look away at the last moment as I glanced at him, and I’m terrified by what he might have planned for me. I'm used to being the focus of the Slytherins, but certainly not to this extent, and it's hard to go to Harry or Ron with no real proof he's doing anything other than being his normal, vile self.</p><p>In potions this afternoon, Malfoy sent a note, ignoring the fact Umbridge had burned an earlier one sent by another student. It flew through the air, perfectly crafted as a peacock, landing on my notes, before Ron unknowingly moved, trying to get Harry's attention and knocked it off the desk with his elbow like a great oaf. Before I could rescue it at the end of the lesson, Malfoy retrieved it and walked away, shooting me a sour look. I noticed Luna was staring at us both with a dreamy gaze when I looked up, I really have no idea what's going on in that girl’s head sometimes.</p><p>Malfoy's waiting for me outside the classroom and I duck my head, steeling myself for a vicious attack, wrapping my arms around my books as if they could protect me from his barbs. "I don't have time for your bile now, Malfoy, so cut the crap and just tell me what you want."</p><p>The Slytherin shifts from his place, leaning against the wall as he peers at me, his head cocked as he stares. I'm not one to shy away from a fight, but things haven't been great for me recently, I'm worried about Harry and what's been going on with the foul, evil gargoyle. She's been torturing him and he's just not willing to report it. This, with Malfoy, is just further drama I don't want to deal with. Everything's been going to shit, and I don't have the energy for it. I dare to look up. Malfoy's a good foot taller than me now but I find he's dipped his head, his face is inches away from mine. That weird, intense look is on his face again, like he's trying to figure me out. I've never noticed how clear his eyes are before, they're grey, but darker at the pupil, almost like a storms brewing. I love listless Autumn skies, and rainy afternoons, it annoys me that his eyes somehow remind me of that. He's somehow ruined my favourite thing.</p><p>"Weasleby got in the way." He smirks, holding out the crumpled note for me to take from his hand.</p><p>I smell a hint of peppermint toothpaste on his breath as he speaks, the breeze from the window sends a waft of freshly cut grass over my nostrils. I run my hand through my hair, noticing him watching my every move while trying to feign disinterest. I open my book and see a trail of fire ants crossing the page, and no words to be seen, he’s such a prick. "So, what is it? A note to tell me how disgusting I am? Because you know, I think I've already heard everything you have to say on the matter, Malfoy."</p><p>He shakes his hand again, urging me to take the note, and his eyes flick back to mine, his long, golden lashes fluttering as I eventually reach out to take his proffered message. His warm, larger hand barely brushes mine as he passes it to me. I'm not sure I ever associated Malfoy with warmth and his touch shocks me.</p><p>I'm staring at the squashed paper bird in my hand, and for once I'm not sure what to say, it seems a shame for such a delicately crafted paper crane to be destroyed. Nobody could ever accuse me of being quiet, gods, I often have a mouth on me like a wailing banshee, especially when I'm riled. I've clearly taken entirely too long to think about it, as when I look up, he's gone, the smell of parchment and a spicy but alluring scent left in his wake. I spend the next few hours desperately trying to forget it.</p><p>........</p><p>This is too much.</p><p>Why would Malfoy even ask this? Why would he want to meet me? Especially as he's been so close to Umbridge and tried so hard to capture the DA. </p><p>Harry's more morose than ever, lost in his own thoughts, and Ron, emotionally wise, is about as useful as a chocolate teapot. If I tell him, I just know he'll go on the rampage and probably injure himself with his bloody awful wand work, then get himself expelled. I can't say I'm feeling much better than Ron about the snakes, but everyone has their own issues with them. I decide not to bother Ginny either, not that she seems to want much to do with me now we're in school.</p><p>I'm reading the note again. It's simple and written in beautiful cursive. I'm not sure what I expected of my arch nemesis, but his gorgeous penmanship wasn't it.</p><p>
  <em>'Miss Granger, I request your presence in the room of requirement at midnight. You have no reason to trust me, nor I you, I understand this, so I will leave my wand in my dorm and I would appreciate it if you did the same. We must meet alone and unarmed. D.'</em>
</p><p>I've always trusted my gut instinct, even before I knew I was a witch, but him asking this of me sets off major alarm bells. Why would he want to meet with me? I'm worried I'll be dragged off to the Dark Lord with a portkey like Cedric Diggory, either that or the annoying blonde has found some way to rid the school of anyone who isn't pure blood and I'm the first on a long list of victims.</p><p>I decide to leave my wand in my room, against my better judgement, and sneaking out after curfew, I find myself hovering in the corridor. It’s dark and I have no way of creating a lumos charm to light my way, so I've opted for the old fashioned, muggle way. I'm holding a wind-up torch in my hand. My parents packed it in first year, when they weren’t sure what I'd need. I've never needed it until now but I'm so glad of it. I think of them while I wait, they’d be annoyed with me for doing something so dangerous.</p><p>I walk past three times, knowing the entrance won't show itself until I do, and even then, I'm not sure the room will show itself while I don't have my wand. Nothing happens at first, but then a door appears, painted bright red. Merlin, the room must be having a laugh if it thinks using Gryffindor colours will relax me, if anything it's put me more on the offensive. I feel too hot and pull at my at my tie so I can release the top buttons of my shirt, rubbing at my eyes and wishing I had my wand, I feel totally lost without it.</p><p>The doors open and I’m crossing the threshold, my resolve sturdy and my back tensed. I can’t help but pinch my fingers together where I'd usually hold my wand. I've trained myself to do a little wandless magic, but nothing that could save me from a desperate Slytherin who might plan to give me to Voldemort, unless he wanted his flowers brought back to life or his glass of water refilled. I decide that's something I need to work harder on. The muscles in my stomach are taut, and I feel my breath coming rapidly, with the occasional hitch when I see only darkness at first.</p><p>Once I step inside the room, I'm surprised to find the light of candles. The low light creates an oval glow on the stone ceiling, but there's hardly enough of them to show me the whole room. Initially the room seems small, but shadows curve and flicker into the candlelight and I realise it's much larger. This worries me, I could have put myself in the worse situation possible and it would be my own fault. I know I've come because I'm lonely and I think Malfoy somehow knows that. Perhaps he's singled me out because of it? I bite my lip.</p><p>I jump as I hear a breathless murmur on my left as he speaks. His face is shadowed but I recognise his voice instantly as he lounges against the wall beside me, his hands in his pockets and his eyes on me.</p><p>"You came." His spicy scent carries over in the small space, and his breath is hot against my collarbone. That’s how close he is. Being in an enclosed space alone with a boy who wasn't Harry or Ron causes a shudder to race through my body. I notice his eyes on my lip and it springs forth as I release it.</p><p>"Err, well, yes, you invited me, didn't you? I thought it only polite to accept your invitation." It's my voice, but I’m not sure it sounds like me, it sounds husky. Alone, In the presence of a fit male I realise I quite fancy; even if he is a total pig; my voice sounds ten times sexier than I ever imagined. If I'm going to die now, then bugger it, I'll just let it happen as I don't have much choice.</p><p>"Ha! You have better manners than, oh, why bother even say their names..." He waves one hand silently, clearly attempting to be his usual self, but I notice his voice isn't as harsh, it's softer, his demeanour more relaxed, his eyes sparkling. I stare at him until he clears his throat uncomfortably, and I guess he's thinking about saying something about mud blood’s or muggles, but stops himself, either that or he doesn't like being under my scrutiny. Yes, I’m staring.</p><p>I run my hand through my hair and shiver as he watches me. "Why?" I ask, "Why am I here?" Its a question I'm asking myself and him.</p><p>I freeze as he moves closer and I hear him breathing just beside my ear, his breath rising in tandem with mine as I dig my nails into my palms, almost drawing blood. This isn't something I should be doing, so many would be incensed with me if they found out I was here, with him. I can't stop myself. Harry is in love with Ginny and Ron, well, Ron plays at wanting me, but I don't want him, not really. Do I want someone else, if that were an option?</p><p>"You're here as my guest." He murmurs as his breath drifts across the nape of my neck. I gulp. His forefinger is winding around a stray curl, just like the last time we spoke, except this time his fingers brush against my skin. What is this?</p><p>I shiver and bite my lip painfully, momentarily allowing my eyes to flicker closed at the sensation. "You're delusional, Malfoy, I'm no more a guest here than you're a Hufflepuff, and you know it."</p><p>"Am I Granger?" His fingertips move to ghost over the fine hairs of my lower arm, and I shudder. I don't know what to think, but my hearts pounding, and I've been so long without human touch of any kind, I want more. If only my friends could see how far I've fallen in my loneliness, perhaps they might try to make an effort.</p><p>He moves closer, his lips inches away from mine, "Perhaps you're the one who's under an illusion?" He mutters.</p><p>"Perhaps I am? Perhaps this is just a dream, Draco, and I'll wake and realise you're using me to get to Harry just like I thought." I tell him.</p><p>When I speak his name, he bites his lower lip and takes hold of my upper arms, pushing me back gently until my back meets the cold, hard stone, his polished granite eyes glinting in the candlelight.</p><p>"Perhaps it's not?" He tells me, "Perhaps, I've realised I want you, Granger?"</p><p>I'm silent, swimming in the icy grey of his eyes as I try to make a decision. Even if I wanted him, how in the world could I trust Draco Malfoy?</p><p>….</p><p>
  <strong>Draco</strong>
</p><p>Now I've got her here, how can I convince her I've had a crush on her for years? She isn't some slag from my house, who's desperately looking for a pureblood husband. I want her to know that, when I took a step back and watched my supposed mates, I realised how badly she was treated by them and I wanted to tell her I felt the same. It's true I have to suffer the same jibes from the other three houses, with only my practiced sneer of indifference to convince them it doesn't get to me, but it does occasionally. I never allow my face to show the hurt like she does, even though she would hex anyone who dared to cross her. There is still that first moment of hurt as it flashes over her gorgeous face, that moment when she's vulnerable, before she lashes out with her words and never her wand unless the situation truly warrants it.</p><p>How can I tell her? How can I say that from the minute I saw her on the train first year I loved her fire, her drive. How can I explain how I fought to beat her in every lesson we had together and failed because she was so amazing, how I watched her fall in with Weasley and Potter and was jealous of every moment they spent together. The adventures they had, Godrick, even the little Weaslette had a better time helping defeat the Dark Lord in the Chamber than I ever could hope for.</p><p>Those idiots all pale in comparison to her, Hermione Granger. She's like sunshine raining down over the Astronomy Tower, a stark reminder of the life I've never had, and the life I want. How can I explain what she means to me?</p><p>My life has always been filled by the Dark Lord in some way, either by my father wishing for his return or by him secretly telling my mother he wished he would never return and crying in his sleep. I often heard him as I walked the halls of the Manor when I had nightmares and stood outside their room. From an early age I was privy to the conversations of Death Eaters and family members such as my aunt Bellatrix as they made plans for his return. She said she was close to the Dark Lord, but everyone knew she was a lunatic. </p><p>She came when I asked, and I admit I don't know what to do next. All I know is I'm like a moth to a flame, more so when she shivers so delightfully just inches away, driving me crazy. My heart is ruling my head, and my body makes the decision for me. I push her back against the wall, her gasp leaves me in no doubt she wants more.</p><p>I tell her I want her, sod it all to hell, my life’s fucked anyway.</p><p>........</p><p>
  <strong>Hermione</strong>
</p><p>"I don't trust you." I tell him, how could I ever say I trust Draco Malfoy? It's preposterous.</p><p>His eyes are on my lips as he murmurs, "I know. You have no reason to."</p><p>I sense his lips inches from mine and I can feel his hot breath mingling with my own as I try to reason why he'd want me at all. "Do you trust me?" I ask.</p><p>Malfoy’s hands are still on my upper arms, gripping me like he thinks I'll escape and run for the dorms. It isn't as if the thought hasn't occurred to me, but I can't help myself, I need to know the truth. My hands clench back the feeling, the need to touch him. I feel him close the gap between us, his body flush against mine. I gasp as I feel his erection against my hip. My body goes into overdrive, even McClaggen didn't come this close with his sloppy snog and faux romance. Actually, he didn't get this close because I didn't allow him this close. Malfoy is another matter, his scent overwhelms me and the closer he moves, the more I turn into a pile of goo. I can feel my knees trembling and my chest firing rapidly like I might hyperventilate.</p><p>"Her-Granger," he murmurs and I'm almost lost. I don't care about Hogwarts, Harry, Ron or anyone else, I’m just desperate to know what Malfoy has to say. </p><p>"Say something." I tell him. I can't wait. If he doesn't reply, if he doesn't give me answers, I'll leave right now. I will, I promise myself I will.</p><p>"I, Merlin, Granger, I..."</p><p>"This is ridiculous! I don't know why I'm here! You said you wanted me for something, but this is just rubbish, I'm going back to my dorm!" I try to wriggle free and he tenses, holding me tighter.</p><p>"Please don't leave, Hermione, I trust you and I want you to stay, please, I need you to stay." The tone of his voice changes and he sounds almost like he's begging, but how can he be? A Malfoy would never beg a muggle born for anything! I'm hardly thinking straight and don't notice he's called me by my given name.</p><p>"Why? Why do you want me to stay? If you want me here at least tell me why, Malfoy, please." I'm not so stupid as to think Malfoy is beyond using me, I've already thought it and already voiced it, but when his eyes lock with mine, darting from side to side, I know he's trying to read my reactions. "Draco?" I venture, his given name feels strange on my lips.</p><p>He looks terrified and grasps the hair at the nape of my neck before smashing his lips against mine. I'm instantly absorbed by him and my brain goes haywire, the very feeling of him drives me into a lustful haze and I want more. Oh. His fingers brush the skin below my ear and still I want more.</p><p>Please, please, someone help me, I want Draco Malfoy.</p><p>.....</p><p>
  <strong>Draco</strong>
</p><p>She said my name and I can't control myself any longer. I've loved her from the minute I saw her, and I've tried to stay away, but since Dumbledore left and the bitch with the weird tea cups and plated kittens on her office wall took over I've feared for her safety. Even Potter can't save her while he allows her to walk the halls of the school like a lost lamb, alone and vulnerable.</p><p>I've heard what Umbridge has in store for Potter and his friends, she wants to torture them further, she needs only one excuse to drag Hermione into her office and I know her smart mouth will eventually get her into trouble. I offered to help Umbridge as my father would expect it, but I hate the old bag with a passion and would love to throw her, those tea cups and frilly dresses into the Black Lake and watch the Grindylows rip her to pieces just for thinking of hurting the girl I adore with every fibre of my being.</p><p>My hands are the first to touch, grasping a handful of her hair, as I pull her closer. Her locks are as soft as I thought they would be and I run my fingers through the wild lengths. She lets out the sweetest moan as I kiss her lips, almost drowning in her, and the sound spurs me on as she surrenders.  Her head drops back into my hand and I'm peppering kisses along her jawline, lathing her ear with my tongue and listening to her moan in pleasure. I never thought it would come to this, that she'd be in my arms gasping and rolling her hips against me, nor can I believe I could ever deserve this, that she’d ever let me touch her.</p><p>I don't deserve this, I tell myself and I stop, biting back a whimper. She deserves more than a me, fuck, even Weasley would be a better match than some idiot who can't come out in front of the whole school and tell her he loves her. Some idiot whose loved her from afar but can't admit it in public because of his fear of the beating he'd get from his father for loving a muggle born.</p><p>She tenses when she feels me do the same, her glazed and dilated eyes moving to meet mine as I release her.</p><p>"This should never have happened." I rasp, placing my hands firmly on the tops of her arms and holding her at arms-length. If I don't I'll never let her go.</p><p>Fuck, the hurt in her eyes has almost undone me. I move to apologise; I have to say something, to explain, but my tongue feels like it's frozen and I nervously run my hand through my hair.</p><p>She shouts like a woman possessed, her fire and passion now turned against me, "I knew you'd do this! How could you do this to me?"</p><p>I close my eyes, knowing what was coming. The punch felt exactly like it did two years ago, except this time I could hear her sobs as she runs away. My legs buckle as I drop to the floor wanting to join her and bawl my bloody eyes out.</p>
