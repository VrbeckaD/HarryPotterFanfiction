    <p>Harry stares down numbly at the three items that seem to mock him from their position on the table. The invisibility cloak, which he had kept after the battle seemed to rustle softly in the breeze created by the open window. Harry’s eyes slowly move to the Resurrection Stone, in his opinion, the most damning of the objects. It had been his intent to lose the stone in the last battle, but one morning he had simply awoke to find the Hallow next to his bed. Shortly after that, the Elder Wand, which he had placed in Dumbledore’s coffin, had appeared next to him one morning when he was drinking coffee and enjoying breakfast.</p>
<p>At first, Harry had tried to ditch the items once more. The stone he had tried to throw in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. Then, he took the Elder Wand and tried snapping it in half, but that didn’t work. After that, he threw the wand into a volcano. Two months later, both items had dropped onto his head while he was in the middle of having sex with Ginny.</p>
<p>Speaking of the witch, she was currently sitting on the other side of the table, staring sadly at her former love. It had been a couple of months since they had split up. The feeling had been mutual, but she found that she couldn’t leave the wizard alone. If she wasn’t here to check in on him, she was sure that he would have drown himself in alcohol or starved to death.</p>
<p>“Mom wants you to come visit some time,” Ginny says quietly and watches the dark haired man for a reaction.</p>
<p>“Tell her I’ll visit in a couple of days,” Harry replies quietly. He gives the same response every time she asks him to come visit, although he never follows through.</p>
<p>“I made you food,” Ginny says in attempt to draw Harry out of his trance.</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>“You shouldn’t regret what happened,” Ginny states boldly. “Death is sometimes necessary to win a war. If they hadn’t died, we might have lost the war. Fred knew the risks of being part of the war.”</p>
<p>Harry responds to Ginny’s words by finally lifting his gaze and looking her in the eyes. It’s the first time he’s actually turn his attention towards him in at least two months. “You’re right,” he whispers. “I know you’re right, but it’s still hard.” Harry sighs and grabs the plate of food. As he takes a bite, he says, “The Hallows refusing to leave my side doesn’t help me any. They’re like a constant reminder of death and mock me. I just get the feeling in my gut that there’s a bigger meaning to these items.” He pauses for a minute. “Like there’s something I’m supposed to do with them; something bigger than my part in the war.”</p>
<p>Ginny stares at him with pity in her eyes. The man she once loved was delving into insanity before her very eyes and she knew that she was powerless to help him. Harry’s eyes snap her own as she lets out a sigh.</p>
<p>“I don’t want your pity,” Harry says and his eyes narrow at the red head. “I’m not going crazy, so there’s no reason for you to look at me like that.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think you’re going crazy,” Ginny lies, but Harry doesn’t fall for it.</p>
<p>“Yes you do,” he says and his vocal level begins to rise. “You think that I’m going crazy now that I have nothing to do since the war is over. You’re convinced that I’m dreaming up what’s been happening with these Hallows, because I desperately want something to happen again. Well, I’m not imagining any of this. We’ve known each other this long and you don’t trust what I’ve been saying to you! That hurts more than anything that happened during the war.”</p>
<p>Ginny was quiet as she sat through Harry’s tantrum. Honestly, she hadn’t expected him to have an outburst. Since the war, Harry had been a fairly mellow person. He didn’t normally lash out at anything.</p>
<p>“I’ll see you tomorrow,” Ginny says as she stands to leave.</p>
<p>As she makes her way to the door, she hears Harry say, “Don’t come back until further notice.” The door slams behind her on her way out and she quickly apparates away.</p>
<p>Harry sighs and finishes his food in silence. “Winky,” he says and summons the house elf. She had left Hogwarts to live and work in Harry’s home as his house elf. “Return this plate to Mrs. Weasley, please.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Master,” Wink says before popping out of the room.</p>
<p>Harry turns back towards the table and stares for a minute.</p>
<p>“Becoming enticed with the Hallows had led many men to their deaths,” a voice whispers and Harry freezes all movement automatically. “Do not be scared.”</p>
<p>“I’ve been wondering if someone was watching me,” Harry says confidently. “Who are you?”</p>
<p>There’s a soft huff of laughter from somewhere. “You should not be asking who I am. You’re smarter than that, Dear Boy. There’s a part of you that already knows the answer to the question you asked.” Harry’s eyes furrow as he tries to locate the source of the voice. “You won’t see me until I wish to reveal myself.”</p>
<p>“May I please see you?” Harry replies simply.</p>
<p>There’s a chuckle and a dark form appears directly in front of Harry. The raven haired wizard slowly looks up at the being that stands about a good meter above Harry’s stature. “Do you feel satisfied?” the being asks and Harry shrugs back.</p>
<p>“I mean, I could have only guessed what you would look like,” Harry says simply. “It’s pretty much what I figured; ominous.” The being in front of him just smiles creepily. “So, are you Ignotus Peverell or Death?”</p>
<p>“I am Death,” the being replies casually. “It’s been a long time that I’ve met a wizard that was able to face death with no fear.”</p>
<p>“Well, I technically have already faced death,” Harry says and then adds bitterly, “multiple times.”</p>
<p>“None of that matters,” Death says simply. “It doesn’t matter how many times you may come close to me. A moron can almost get himself killed on numerous occasions. You were destined to die after all of the Horcruxes were destroyed, but fate could never know whether or not you would crumble under this knowledge. When you embraced your fate with open arms and accepted your death, that’s when you truly escaped my clutches.”</p>
<p>“Wait, so you can’t touch me?” Harry asks, truly confused.</p>
<p>“I can touch you easily,” Death says and to prove his point, caresses Harry’s face much to the young wizard’s dismay. “The important part is that my touch does not kill you and never will.”</p>
<p>Harry’s eye brows press together. “I’m immortal?”</p>
<p>“Essentially, yes. See, you always had possession of the Invisibility Cloak. When you used the Resurrection Stone with no illusion that they were coming back, you had mastered that object. You didn’t let it fool you. Then, when you overpowered the Malfoy prat at Malfoy Manor, you became the Master of the Elder Wand. This isn’t enough to be their true master though. To truly have mastered all three Hallows, you have to accept your fate and embrace death. You fulfilled this final condition when you face Voldemort.”</p>
<p>“So, The Tale of the Three Brothers is true?” Harry asks curiously.</p>
<p>“It’s complicated. I did not gift the three wizards the items if that’s what you’re asking. All three of the Peverell brothers crafted their own items. They were perhaps three of the most gifted wizards I’ve ever had the pleasure of killing.” Harry makes a weird face at the last remark. “It’s a compliment, trust me.”</p>
<p>“If I can put faith in Death, then who can I put my faith in?” Harry says jokingly.</p>
<p>“You should always put faith in yourself,” Death replies mystically. “The three brothers may have been powerful, but they did not understand the meaning of the gifts they had forged for themselves. Each of them used the items for their own personal gain. Cadmus used his gift to directly defy the barriers of my world and his own for selfish reasons. Antoich created the wand out of pure lust for power, which is never a good thing. Although Ignotus was wise and humble, he still used the cloak to evade fate and thus, in the end, was cowardly.</p>
<p>“I knew these brothers personally when they were alive. They were good kids. They had all sought to outwit me though. I must admit, I was surprised at their power to create three items, that when combined, would overpower even I.”</p>
<p>“Why didn’t you destroy the Hallows if they threatened your power?” Harry asks and Death looks down at him strangely.</p>
<p>“That’s a simple question. Fate wouldn’t let me. The being had always been more powerful than me. She gave me some excuse that it was deemed by the natural balance of the world that there had to be a check on my power to take souls to the next world. I never understood what She had meant until I met you.”</p>
<p>“What does that mean?”</p>
<p>“Don’t be so dull, Dear Child,” Death chides. “You are perhaps the most powerful wizard to ever walk this very planet. On top of that, you have a truly pure soul. It’s only right that you should be able to defy me and travel beyond the destiny of mere mortals.”</p>
<p>Harry’s eyes widen as he takes in the information. “Why do you say perhaps?”</p>
<p>“Tom Riddle was more powerful than you, but Voldemort was not. Do you know why?” Death smirks at Harry as though he has asked a trick question.</p>
<p>Harry thinks long and hard for a moment before replying, “Tom Riddle was sane before he split his soul. Afterwards, he lost his humanity, which is an important thing that gives people power?” Although he didn’t want to admit it, Harry had just pulled that explanation out of his ass, because he didn’t honestly know the answer.</p>
<p>“You’re close. No matter what Dumbledore may have thought, Tom Riddle was capable of love. The man that preceded Voldemort was no fool. His downfall was his love for power, which was greater to him than his love for any human. It wasn’t Tom Riddle’s destiny to love anyone in his lifetime. As soon as he had split his soul, Tom’s love had won over everything. It wasn’t until he tried to kill you that his love backfired and destroyed part of his soul.”</p>
<p>“This is all so complicated,” Harry says quietly and takes a seat.</p>
<p>“Would it help if I gave you a simplified version?” Harry nods. “You’re immortal now and I am going to be your companion. I have Death things to do every now and then, but you are ultimately my Master. If you ever need me, I will be there automatically. Don’t let this all fool you though, Fate has something planned for you, but I don’t know what. Was that explanation better?”</p>
<p>“Much,” Harry says and smiles. “It’s a lot to take in.”</p>
<p>“I understand,” Death says with a nod. “I have other business to attend to though. People are dying at a rate of about 150,000 per day. I’m a busy person. It helps that there are more than one of me though.”</p>
<p>“Wait, there’s more than one Death?” Harry asks with wide eyes.</p>
<p>“Not enough time to discuss this. We can talk about it later,” Death says before disappearing.</p>
<p>Harry has more questions on the tip of his tongue, but quickly admits defeat. He would have to ask them again next chance he got. As Harry stares up at the ceiling he could help but to chuckle a little. Fate is definitely a funny thing.</p>
