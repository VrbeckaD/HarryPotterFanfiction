    <span>The Doctor and Captain Jack Harkness ran as fast as their legs could carry them towards the TARDIS. The Doctor wrenched the door open, to try to get away from the screaming soldiers. There was a blast of a gun, and they felt themselves getting caught in the blast. The TARDIS doors snapped shut. “Doctor?” Jack called, but was forcefully shoved a beaker full of a sizzling substance.</span>
  </em>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em>
    <span>“Drink it.” The Doctor ordered, doing his own in one gulp. Jack was more hesitant, but trusted the Doctor completely, so downed his as well. The Doctor ran back to the laboratory he had emerged from, but only a few minutes went by before Jack heard a large blast and a few shattering beakers, and a few choice Gallifreyan curses, going by the lack of translation.</span>
  </em>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em>
    <span>“Doctor?” Jack called and ran into the lab. But the man standing before him wasn’t the Doctor he had just seen, it was the Doctor from before, the first Doctor Jack had met. “Doctor?”</span>
  </em>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em>
    <span>“What Jack?” He said, before bursting into a regeneration-like light, and turned to an older man with white hair.</span>
  </em>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em>
    <span>“It was a De-aging gun we were hit with.” He said in a raspy voice, “The substance I just made let us keep our personalities.”</span>
  </em>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em>
    <span>“What?” Jack said, stunned. Then, another burst of light, and a shorter man with light brown hair emerged.</span>
  </em>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em>
    <span>“That’s number eight.” The Doctor said in frustration.</span>
  </em>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em>
    <span>“Doctor, what’s the gun for? If it doesn’t kill us then?”</span>
  </em>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em>
    <span>“Oh it does,” the Doctor continued to work as he de-regenerated once more into an older, pudgier man,</span>
  </em>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em>
    <span>“It regresses a person until they don’t even exist.”</span>
  </em>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em>
    <span>“What?” Jack managed, “I assume you’re working on a way to not kill us?”</span>
  </em>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em>
    <span>“Yep.” The Doctor said, popping the ‘p’, which sounded strange in this other man’s voice, “That’s the plan.” There was then another pop. The new Doctor had curly blonde hair and blue eyes. The Doctor went back to his elixir with determination. Two de-regenerations later, the Doctor had curly brown hair and an even more boyish grin then the tenth incarnation. He spent the longest in this body, mixing and diluting. Three de-regenerations later, the Doctor finished, he was on his first body, and he quickly shoved the elixir into Jack’s hands. </span>
  </em>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em>
    <span>“Doctor, I haven’t regressed at all. Maybe it didn’t hit me.” The Doctor laughed, but in his old body, Jack was slightly unnerved.</span>
  </em>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em>
    <span>“No, you’ve just been the same age for so long because of Rose.” The name stung the Doctor’s lips. “You’ll start regressing soon.” As if on cue, Jack felt something activate in his body, so he quickly drank the elixir. Not wanting to think about himself, Jack watched as the Doctor’s hair coloured and his age regressed. Soon, they were both shrinking. Before he knew it, the TARDIS began shaking.</span>
  </em>
</p><p align="justify">
  <em>
    <span>“Oh, she doesn’t like this.” The Doctor observed, “Too many paradoxes,” Jack grinned, knowing this would be one hell of an adventure.</span>
