  <strong>Hey, guys, I do hope you enjoy. Harik</strong>
</p>
<p>It happened again, but with a difference. What is this difference you're asking?</p>
<p>Harry has a sister but she gets the scar as well, so they are both the children who lived, the chosen ones, but most interesting of all...</p>
<p>Soulmates.</p>
<p>What happened when mouldyshorts attacked? Harry fell in front of his sister, sealing a life debt, making his sister, Rose Potter, the primary heir to the house of Potter, while Harry is still the male primary heir.</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <em>Skip to the Dursleys (Harry and Rose are 11yo)</em>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>“Oww,” is what Harry was screaming just before the mail came.</p>
<p>(Mail drops)</p>
<p>“Freak boy go fetch the mail!” Vernon ‘The big fat prune’ Dursley snapped, at Harry</p>
<p>Harry limps to the door and finds 2 letters addressed to people who never get mail.</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>‘Harry J. Potter</em>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>The cupboard under the stairs</em>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>No.4 Privet Drive, Little Whinging</em>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>Surrey, England’</em>
</p>
<p>And the other letter says:</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>‘Rose L. Potter</em>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>The cupboard under the stairs</em>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>No. 4 Privet Drive, Little Whinging</em>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>Surrey, England’</em>
</p>
<p>Harry collects the mail, goes back into the kitchen watching his sister get the same treatment as him, being hit with a pan that was just on the stove. Harry nearly cried, but he managed to clear his mind and make it look like he was emotionless, unknowingly doing this by bringing his mind defences up to max.</p>
<p>Harry look into the eyes of 'Uncle' Vernon and puts a thought into his head, he does the same to Petunia and they rush to the master bedroom upstairs with Dudley, not knowing what will happen. Harry opens a channel through his mind, and it reaches his sister and he silently asks, “Are you okay sis?” and unfortunately she replies with, “I think my ribs are broken, but I can’t tell.”</p>
<p>After hearing this, he feels a weird connection for the third time today, with his sister, feelings that he thought he shouldn't have with his sister, his twin. But he still has the feeling. Attraction. So, he kisses her cheek, to make them go down, for the both of them, as they are well aware of what the other is feeling, and not through his mind, but through his soul. So, when this happens, they both accidentally absorb the pure magic around them and use it to heal Rose. Seconds later Rose is healed, and a few more seconds after that you can hear, "Duddiekins... cum... me." and when Harry and Rose heard that they flew into laughter and they didn’t stop after that because they heard moaning at insane volume levels</p>
<p>So, Harry, who only just thinks of this and unknowingly, warms himself and his sister up by using magic to heal both him and his sister, healing their past injuries.</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <em>Skip to later that day</em>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>“Hey sis, there’s an owl outside, and did we even read our letters?” Harry asks Rose</p>
<p>“No, I don’t think we read our letters, and the owls might have come with them, I mean the letters did have the cupboard on them!” Rose replied, “So, we should probably read them!”</p>
<p>Harry and Rose open their letters and when they do they say:</p>

  <em>Dear Mr/Ms. Potter, </em>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment. </em>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>Term begins on 1 September. We await your owl by no later than 31 July. </em>

  <em>Deputy Headmistress’</em>
</p>
<p>Since they were the same they only kept one letter with them, and then got some paper and wrote on it:</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>‘Dear Prof. McGonagall</em>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>We ask that you send someone to help us as we are new to the wizarding world.</em>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>Please send some help.</em>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>Yours sincerely,</em>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>Harry and Rose Potter’</em>
</p>
<p>They rolled the paper up, went outside and gave the paper to the owl and it flew off.</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <em>The next day</em>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>Knock Knock</p>
<p>“Boy! Girl! Get the door!” Vernon exclaims <strong><em>(Sounds like that is the only thing he can do)</em></strong></p>
<p>"Yes, Uncle Vernon!" Harry and Rose say in unison</p>
<p>Harry and Rose open the door. There is a woman at the door who says, “Hello Harry and Rose, I am Minerva McGonagall, but you can call me Professor McGonagall!”</p>
<p>“Hello, weren't you the one on the letter? Deputy Headmistress?” Harry asks</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s me” Minerva replies</p>
<p>Harry and Rose then say, “Please get us out of here, its hell!”</p>
<p>Minerva then sees the scars that they have and under her breath curses Dumbledore</p>
<p>"Okay, I'm getting you two away from your relatives. Permanently!" Minerva says, then says, "Pack up your stuff because we are leaving, and leaving quickly."</p>
<p>In unison, Harry and Rose say, “We don’t own anything.”</p>
<p>After hearing this, Minerva rushes them to the knight bus, then takes them to Diagon Alley.</p>
