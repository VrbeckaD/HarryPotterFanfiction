  <em>If you are not aware of my writing style, it is sort of in the form of vignettes, you can call it. Basically I have not written a full detailed book, you will find yourself reading short snippets of the times that are most important all combined together to make a single story. This will be a short story of around 5-10 chapters. Also, it has been a while since I've read the books, so details may be sketchy and I apologize for that. Constructive criticism is welcome, hate comments will be deleted and the user will be blocked. Thank you for understanding.</em>

  <em>This book was originally published on Wattpad and Fanfiction net during the summer of 2016, but since I joined the archive recently I thought might as well post it here as well. Enjoy :)</em>
