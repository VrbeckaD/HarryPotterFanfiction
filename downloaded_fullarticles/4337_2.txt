    <p>"How could you make a mistake like that, Albus?!" Lily potter all but screeched as she stroked her son's hair from a plush armchair in in the headmaster's office. She was a beautiful woman with flaming red hair and bright emerald green eyes and barely looked out of her 20s. The complete opposite of the man she was currently yelling at. The Headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry looked every inch the stereotypical Merlin. He had long white hair with a matching beard, an old wise face with bright blue eyes and a long crooked nose.</p>
<p>The office itself that they were in is a circular room inside of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The room is lined with bookshelves and dominated by an ornate desk, chair, and a roaring fireplace. Various circular windows showing an inky black sky dotted with stars.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry my dear but when I examined both young Evan and Harry, I assumed Evan was the Boy-who-Lived as he was still awake and Harry was unconscious with a depleted magical core." Albus, the current Headmaster, stated regretfully as the twinkle in his eyes dimmed and fell to his cluttered desktop covered in reams of parchment and trinkets. Unable to meet the eyes of his favorite students for several minutes.</p>
<p>James, a handsome man with messy black hair and sharp hazel eyes hidden behind round glasses, finally spoke up quietly saying "... and it didn't occur to you at all that the reason he was unconscious because he had just drained his magical core DEFLECTING AN AVADA KEDAVRA CURSE! "He had started off speaking quietly but by the end of his of the sentence he was bellowing at the headmaster. The force of his anger agitating his magic enough to cause several of the small silver trinkets scattered around to shatter and the fire roar to life next to him.</p>
<p>"What does this mean for me Headmaster?"</p>
<p>Evan up until this point had been in a shocked silence, very odd for the confident, boisterous Gryffindor he normally was. However, judging from his rapidly reddening face and the iron grip he had on the arms of his squashy chintz armchair. He was moving from shocked to furious about this upheaval in his life very quickly.</p>
<p>Lily, seeing this, quickly assured her son that he would always be special and keep his fame, although she looked over her sons head with panicked eyes at Albus. As if begging him that this was indeed true. She also sent a pointed look to her husband who had opened his mouth again, no doubt to begin ranting, which immediately had him snap his mouth shut with an audible 'clack' and come over to sulk next to his son settling himself in the other identical chair next to his son and directly in front of the large, slightly raised desk.</p>
<p>"Of course even if Hadrian is the True Boy-Who-Lived… no one else aside from us and Severus ever need to know. We will retrieve him from where ever he is staying and have him perform his duty for the Greater Good and then he will easily be disposed of." Assured Albus to, not only Evan, but James and Lily as well due to the fact that they knew if it was ever discovered that they abandoned the actual Savior of their world. They would be pariahs and their lavish life, due the fame and fortune of their son, would immediately end.</p>
<p>"Snivellus?" James all but snarled "Why does he have to know about this. Greasy git would spread the news all over the country." He mumbled sulkily, fully aware of the harsh glare his wife was directing his way. He attempted to subtly shift his chair away from his wife who had perched herself on one of the arms of his sons but he failed miserably and earned a derisive snort from her.</p>
<p>"Severus…" Albus started reproachfully with a disappointed look at James "... needs to know as he is the only man in Britain who can brew the potion that will tell us the location of young Harry and also give us his physical appearance"</p>
<p>Lily and James glanced at each other over Evans head who was now calmer after the assurance he'd received from his parents and his headmaster. A silent conversation passed between the two of them which ended with a pout from James and a smug smile from Lily who then turned to Albus.</p>
<p>"Go ahead and summon Sev now Albus so we can get this over with as I'm sure you've already alerted him to the need for the potion in time for it to be ready now. It'll be wonderful to see Hadrian again." She said cheerily almost as if she had never abandoned her child in the first place.</p>
<p>"Indeed I have my dear girl as I wanted to be fully prepared for this meeting and not have to make anyone wait to retrieve Hadrian." Albus' eyes were twinkling brightly as he waved his wand and cast the patronus charm, a phoenix, which he then sent off to fetch the potions master.</p>
<p>After only a few minutes the heavy wooden door opened silently to admit the dour potions master, a man with greasy hair sallow skin and a large hooked nose, who immediately sent a vicious glare over to the Potter family. His robes were billowing behind him as usual and he carried a large silver cauldron covered by a heavy lid.</p>
<p>"Ah Severus perfect timing as always" Albus intoned twinkling his eyes happily at the scowling man.</p>
<p>"I have the potion you requested although it did require… Alterations to accept the blood of the parent and only the name of the child in question to create the image and devise the location" This was all said with a deep sneer on his face and his tone of voice as he 'Alternations' alluded to how he had not enjoyed the task for the headmasters benefit.</p>
<p>"And I thank you very kindly my boy for assisting me with this" Albus' eyes seemed to twinkle even more as he said this. On the other side of the office James mimed gagging into his hand, much to the amusement of his son who began laughing obnoxiously and the annoyance of his wife which earned him a hearty cuff to the back of his head.</p>
<p>Albus stood and cleared off his desk of all its paperwork and Knick knacks to create space for the cauldron as he motions for James and Lily to step forward. They did so with some trepidation, eyeing the razor sharp knife that Snape laid out next to the cauldron. He gave them both a nasty smirk as he backed away from the desk.</p>
<p>"Now..." Albus began "First you'll need to write the full name of young harry on two separate pieces of parchment and after that simply prick your fingers and allow exactly seven drops of blood to fall on each piece of parchment and afterwards drop them in the potion and if all goes well then it will turn gold and produce an image and location of your child." He finished this with a flick of the wrist and two pieces of parchment appearing before them.</p>
<p>Lily sighed before quickly scribbling 'Hadrian James Potter' and deftly pricking her pointer finger and allowing the dark ruby drops of blood to fall on her piece. Following her lead James did the same before they both dropped them in the bubbling opal colored potion.</p>
<p>There was a bright flash followed by a huge bang that had them all scrambling back as a gold fumes formed above the cauldron (A/N: for image reference think of Ursula using her cauldron to show Ariel Eric) The golden mist seemed to swirl before solidifying as an image appeared.</p>
<p>It was of what at first glance what appeared to be an exceedingly pretty young girl with a pale heart shaped face accented by large emerald green eyes. Her nose was a soft little curve that would look to small on anyone else's face and cherry red Cupid's bow lips. Her hair was raven black and fell softly past her shoulder to a length they could not see. After that however small details seemed to jump out at Lily and James the fact that her high cheekbones were exactly the same as Dorea Potter's, James' mother, or how the shape of her, no His, nose was the exact same shape as Lily's though slightly smaller. The last thing that confirmed that this beautiful boy was their own son was the slim scar on his forehead in the shape of a lightning bolt.</p>
<p>You could have heard a pin drop in the dead silence that blanketed the office as everyone, even Snape and Evan, started in shock at the image.</p>
<p>"You've got to be bloody JOKING!" The sudden bellow from Evan, who was staring at the image with a Gryffindor red face, shocked everyone out of their stupor.</p>
<p>"Now my dear boy there's no need for that" Albus chided gently.</p>
<p>"But….!" Evan began but trailed of as the headmaster merely twinkled his eyes at him before continuing on in his grandfatherly tone.</p>
<p>"Submissive wizards are incredibly rare and known for being exceptionally powerful as well. You should be honored that your younger twin is one as it is a reflection of your power as well." All this was said with a benevolent smile and customary twinkle.</p>
<p>"Older." Snape cut in snidely, causing everyone's attention to snap towards him.</p>
<p>"What?" James snarked.</p>
<p>"You seem to forget that due to the stress of twins Madame Pomphrey called me to assist in the birth. Hadrian was first born where as your precious Evan was born second. You gave away your Heir and as he is a Male, even a submissive one, you cannot transfer the heir-ship to your second child." All this was said in an oily tone of voice with more and more malicious glee mounting on Severus' face and in his eyes as he watched the horror dawn on James' face.</p>
<p>"What on earth are you talking about?" Lily cut in snappishly. "Of course Evan can be declared James' Heir" she proclaimed pompously. Completely unaware of the embarrassment on Albus and James face due to her ignorance of Pureblood customs despite being married to a lord for over a decade at this point. This only caused the potions master to grin nastily at her causing her to falter in her confidence.</p>
<p>"Lily…" James began through gritted teeth. "There are certain traditions upheld, not just by the old lords being stuck in there ways, but also by the Olde Magyk as well. That is what keeps none but the first born male Heir can inherit the family magic's and fortune if you have one." James finished with a glare at Snivellus, angry with him for pointing out the blunder of him abandoning the Heir, as the Potter Family was both an Ancient and Noble one. The beautiful boy in the image that was still glowing above the cauldron was set to inherit a vast fortune of both monetary value and knowledge when he turned 17 if James was no longer among the living.</p>
<p>"What?!" This came simultaneously from both Lily And Evan as they had both become slowly more and more horrified as James explained the reason why Evan could not inherit.</p>
<p>It was at this point that the potion began to glow once more, cutting of the impending screaming match between James, Lily and Evan. The golden image dissipated into a fine smoke as the glowing got brighter it slowly formed letters spelling out…..</p>
<p>Mikage Shrine<br/>
Tokyo, Japan</p>
<p>The glowing letters stayed for only a few sparse moments, unlike the image which had stayed clear and sharp for several minutes. Dumbledore, however, seemed to have expected this to happen as he already had a charmed quill scribbling the vague address down.</p>
<p>"That's not very specific..." Lily ventured nervously.</p>
<p>"It's all the information we need my dear as no two shrines are allowed by law in Japan to have the same name (A/N: I have absolutely no idea if this is actually true but for the sake of my story it's what I'm going with.) So we'll be able to find young Harry with no issues." Albus intoned jovially.</p>
