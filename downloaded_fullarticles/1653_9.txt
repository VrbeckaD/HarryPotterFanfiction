    <p dir="ltr">Tel Aviv was crowded that day</p><p dir="ltr">The day of the contest was the day almost every Eurofans were waiting for. Artists from each countries would come together for a show and to get to know each other, compete against each other. It was the perfect platform to connect with fans and each other</p><p dir="ltr">Eurovision had been different since the day of the unification between the two tribes. Wizards and witches started coming for the glory to represent their country in this song contest whereas Eurovision before the treaty was a muggle exclusive event. This year, there were 20 countries represented by witches and wizards while 21 others by muggles. It was another competition to see who's the best</p><p dir="ltr">For a certain person, that was not the only reason he's in Tel Aviv</p><p dir="ltr">A man wearing a dark cobalt blue coat with a white underlay walked towards the building which the orange carpet was going to be held. Walking down the long road on his own, he held a leather case by his right hand, trying to ignore the visual contacts he received from passerby</p><p dir="ltr">He stopped by an electric pole which had posters attached to it. One of them was the Eurovision promo poster. Albert was too caught off in his thoughts that he didn't notice one of his creature sneaking out of the case.</p><p dir="ltr">"WE NEED TO GET RID OF THEM!" A loud yell caught his attention. He turned around to see a riot happening just infront of him. Probably an anti-wizard protest campaign or something. Curiously, he walked towards the protest ring</p><p dir="ltr">Even with the Wizard-Muggle Unification Treaty, Europe still faced the crisis which were protesting anti-wizard muggles or anti-muggle wizards. Usually everyone would ignore them, sometimes muggle police or even aurors would come take them behind bars for disruption</p><p dir="ltr">He walked closer towards the protest until he was just in eye sight</p><p dir="ltr">"You!" His head snapped up to see the woman who presumably led this protest pointing at him</p><p dir="ltr">"Are you a seeker? A seeker after truth?" Albert almost laughed as it reminded him of the times he played Quidditch back home. Damn Jeronym and his seeker skills</p><p dir="ltr">"I'm more of a chaser, really" He ignored the rest of the woman's sentences as something odd moved in front of his eye sight. A familiar duck like creature crawled inside of the building. It was his niffler</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>Fuck not this again!</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">Albert gave a chase, ignoring the surprised yelp coming from the woman as he shoved through. He didn't even pay attention to the faces around him</p><p dir="ltr">"Excuse me. Sorry. Coming through" He stumbled through people while still keeping an eye on the little niffler. Not paying much attention to his surroundings, he didn't notice the sudden pull on his collar which made him stumble back onto a familiar person</p><p dir="ltr">"Albert! Where were you?! We thought you were lost or something!" It was Antonín! He sighed in relief before trying to squirm himself out of his hold</p><p dir="ltr">"I'd love to chat on how much time I spent in the case and how I literally lost track of time but I'm in a bit of a pickle, Anton" The taller male had a single eyebrow quirked up in suspicion</p><p dir="ltr">"Did something happen?"</p><p dir="ltr">"Nothing that I can't handle"</p><p dir="ltr">"Wha-"</p><p dir="ltr">"I'll see you in the orange carpet, Anton!" And he ran from Anton's hold and got back to tracking the niffler down again. He could hear a faint yell coming from Anton that sounded like 'You're already here!' But Albert couldn't care less</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>Where are you, you little rascal?!</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">Having no other choices, he pulled out his wand and waved it around the floor</p><p dir="ltr">"<em>Appare Vestigium</em>" Hundreds, even thousands of footprints suddenly appeared, covering each other. Until one caught his eyes. The print looked alot like claws. The footprint continued further. He stopped by to see a door, locked with a little gap on the bottom and the footprints leading inside. Albert then apparated inside only to be led into a room. He entered only to appear in an empty room filled with tables and sofas and thousands, maybe even millions of chairs. It was empty except for the occasional people coming over. He looked around to finally see a dark blue niffler sitting on one of the tables. Albert smirked internally before going towards the table. Once he did he quickly snatched the niffler and tickled its stomach, making shiny furnitures of all sorts fall down and made clanging sounds. Albert sighed, why does he have to do this?</p><p dir="ltr">"So this is where you're at, eh? In someone else's country, a place so mysterious to us, and the first thing you did was try to steal?!" The niffler looked up at him with sadness plastered over its eyes. It made Albert want to die</p><p dir="ltr">"No! You're going back in the case!" And he threw the little niffler inside of the case and shut it close. Albert sighed deeply before getting up</p><p dir="ltr">"Now, where am I?" He looked around to see himself on a huge stage. Around him were people wearing uniform staring at him, confused. Which could only mean one thing</p><p dir="ltr">"Fuck. I'm so sorry" With no more words to blurt out, he apparated out of the building and far away from it. His eyes met with the burning sun only for him to realize before him was indeed the spot for the orange carpet and he's standing there, idling. He could already hear Antonín screaming 'YOU FUCKING IDIOT!'</p><p dir="ltr">"Oh, you're from the Czech Republic, right?" One of the host asked</p><p dir="ltr">"Yes. Yes I am. Listen, have you seen the others of Lake Malawi?"</p><p dir="ltr">"They're getting ready in position and I recommend you should too. The orange carpet ceremony is about to start!" Albert laughed nervously before apparating to where he remembered was the starting point for Lake Malawi. This was going to be a long night</p><p dir="ltr">Once he made it on spot, he was greeted by a furious Antonín slapping the shit out of him</p><hr/><p dir="ltr"> </p>
