    <p>Unlike the previous ones, this year doesn’t drag on for Percival in the absence of his lovely wife. Some epidemic is occurring aboveground in which the humans are <em>not</em> dying due to a particular developed strain of virus that reanimates them upon death, and millions of poor, confused souls around the world are hovering between this life and the after, bringing chaos to the natural order.</p><p>Upon sensing trouble and receiving an update from one of his servants, Percival had personally left the Underworld to meet with Pestilence and ask what was the meaning of this—yes, this is what their reality has come to, the god of death (Greek to be specific, some pagan deities are very sensitive about these things) holding an urgent crisis meeting with a fucking Horsewoman of the Apocalypse. Pestilence had informed him that all she was responsible for was the fundamental virus itself, not the manipulation and mutation of it. Oh no, that must have been one of smaller fish out there, thinking it a fun prank to plant that idea in some human’s head. Americans, mostly.</p><p>
  <em>“You know how it is these days, Hades—oh, it’s Percival now, right?” Pestilence corrects herself. “Free will and all, ‘you be you, I’ll be me’ boundaries. And humans, they were always a little special.”</em>
</p><p>And now here he is, waist-deep in documents in his office, writing and reading over letters to send to the relevant parties to delegate this whole matter properly, and of course the task falls to him because everyone is a lazy asshole who can’t be bothered to do the paperwork. They can’t just kill the virus, of course not, because that will result in an overwhelming wave after wave of panicking souls flooding the gates of Hell, Nirvana, his own realm and others, and they’re beyond understaffed to deal with that kind of mess.</p><p>He’s so occupied by his work that it only vaguely registers the change in energy and atmosphere some hours later, the miniscule vibrations of his guard dog scampering through the realm the least of his concerns.</p><p>Then everything quiets once more, and he writes away in peace.</p><p>Until somebody slams through the doors.</p><p>“I’m home, love!”</p><p>Percival looks up and smiles automatically at the sight of his beloved—an adorable mess of auburn curls, bright green eyes like the spring he loves, a bundle of wild energy wrapped up in a package of lean musculature and freckled skin.</p><p>“Welcome home, dear,” Percival greets warmly, then promptly returns to the paper in his hands.</p><p>He doesn’t see the face and arms of his wife fall, brows scrunching in confusion and mouth turning down with disappointment.</p><p>“Percy?”</p><p>Percival makes a noncommittal sound, revising some wording on the sentence he’s reading. If he can get through a few more, then he can take a break. “Sorry, dear, I’ll be finished soon.”</p><p>It takes him a bit—another couple letters—to realize that his wife hasn’t answered him yet. The silence bothers him enough to stop and look up, and he flinches back in surprise to find Newt looming over him from across the desk.</p><p>“Is this the ‘Zombie Apocalypse Conundrum’ that has everyone clucking like chickens recently,” Newt asks calmly, but it doesn’t sound like a question</p><p>The tone of it makes Percival swallow for some reason. “Yes? Yes, hm—it’s quite the headache, but we have a solution—”</p><p>“Somehow, I’m not surprised to find you doing everything,” Newt sighs, frowns and pulls the papers out of Percival’s hands. “You work too hard, darling.”</p><p>Fingers twitching and tamping down on the desire to snatch them back, Percival puts on a patient smile. “It can’t be helped; they aren’t the most mature bunch.”</p><p>A hand unexpectedly cups his cheek, and Percival faintly realizes as he instinctively leans into the touch that they haven’t even kissed yet. Guilt nags at him and he opens his mouth to apologize. And stops when the hand slides further—along his jaw, over his ear—to around the back of his neck. Newt leans in at the same time he tugs on Percival’s neck, drawing close but staying just out of reach. Percival feels his breath from this distance.</p><p>“Here is what will happen, love,” Newt says; low, quiet, a little bit dangerous like the sudden glint in his eyes. “I’m going to get you help and let those fools handle this problem, because we have precious little time as is without you drowning in pesky matters.”</p><p>“Newt,” Percival scolds, “it’s hardly <em>pesky</em>—”</p><p>“Right, because I could have had you at least once by now and what can possibly be more important?” Newt scoffs.</p><p>Percival swallows again, the words igniting a small ember of desire in his gut despite his effort to stay focused. Newt’s stare is like a physical thing when he follows the movement, eyes darkening with a familiar hunger that he can feel spread through his own being in response. Any other time, most situations would be considered trivial because for all that they love one another deeply, their time together is always lacking because of their duties and obligations, and so they learned to spend every second efficiently.</p><p>In other words, making love like there is no tomorrow.</p><p>His wife is particularly sensitive about wasted time each time he comes home, always greeting Percival at the gates with a searing kiss before sweeping him off to the nearest private area and bending him over the first surface available. There are exceptions of course, such as this year, but it seems Newt is having none of it.</p><p>Wetting dry lips, Percival clears his throat. “Your creatures, sweetheart,” he reminds Newt gently.</p><p>“My brother will take care of them,” Newt responds without missing a beat. “Now, be a good boy and let me take you to bed. We already need to make up for lost time.”</p><p>And then he closes the gap, opens Percival’s mouth with lips and tongue and teeth, delving deeply and arousing Percival even more as the wet, filthy sounds of their kiss echo in the room. It’s heat and pressure, pain and pleasure that has Percival releasing embarrassing noises, leaves him panting for oxygen that he doesn’t require. His wife climbs over the desk at some point and lands in Percival’s lap, stroking his nape and tilting his chin to angle the next kiss while caressing the bare skin of his hip underneath the robes. Percival’s hands are in Newt’s hair, tugging helplessly at the onslaught of sensations from the simple act of joining their mouths together.</p><p>“Come to bed, Percy,” Newt murmurs against his lips before pulling back a little further. The hand at his hip slides closer to where Percival needs it, teases just shy of it, and causes him to shudder. “It has been too long; let me pleasure you until you melt beneath my hands.”</p><p>They both know it’s futile for him to resist, Percival having realized early on in their marriage that he can never win against his beloved.</p><p>“Yes, dear.”</p>
