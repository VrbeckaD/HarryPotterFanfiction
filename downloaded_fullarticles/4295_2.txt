  <em>Rouge Dark Wizards Attack the Katsuki Residence!!! 
</em></p><p><em>
Even 30 years after the defeat of Voldemort, there are still dark wizards bitter from the outcome. After our top Aurors Hiroko and Toshiya Katsuki have discovered the underground Death Eater cult, there has been a target on their backs. A target that the ministry and our brave heroes have failed to notice. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>On November 30th, rouge Dark Wizards attacked the Katsuki residence, causing a tragic loss. While 3-year-old Mari Katsuki was unharmed, newly born Yuri Katsuki (born on November 29) has disappeared. Hiroko’s magic was weakened from her labor and Toshiya was overwhelmed from the pursuit of 10 armed wizards. Both Aurors are alive, but the loss of their son is devastating. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>There has been no signs or clues to where Yuri Katsuki may be, but the search to find him will not falter. The Katsuki’s have no pictures of their son, since he was only born yesterday, so please report to the Ministry if you find this child (based off the descriptions below) and the leader of the attack, Nikolai Nikiforov (Ex-Auror of the British force). If you encounter this man report to the ministry immediately he is a dangerous.... </em>
</p><p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Britain, Okukawa Orphange</p><p>Nothing strange happened at the Okukawa Orphange, at least that’s what Minako Okukawa had once believed. The small, hillside orphanage was a pleasant break from her fast-paced job at Hogwarts. Years of a comfortable routine of running her families’ orphanage during the summer and then returning to Hogwarts, has led her to believe that nothing strange happens in the Muggle World. Of course, that’s until the peculiar case of Yuuri occurred.</p><p>It was around the time of the worldwide outrage of the Katsuki incident when a small child, not even a month old, appeared at Minako’s doorstep. It was a dreadful winter’s night and the light snowfall turned to a blizzard. Minako had already put the children to bed and was about to turn in for the night, that is until she heard hurried footsteps across the pavement and then the cry of a baby. The cries grew louder even through the blizzard and Minako bolted to the door.</p><p>“Is anyone there?” she asked as she peered out the door and looking around. She squinted through the snow and briefly saw a hooded figure darted and suddenly apparated away.</p><p>“A wizard? In these parts?” squawked Minako.</p><p>Before she could chase after the figure she heard a whimper and the rustling of fabrics and peered down. A small baby, swaddled in several blankets was left at her doorstep. The poor dear was sniffling from the cold and its cheeks were a bright red.</p><p>“You poor dear!” cried Minako as she scooped him up. Minako was in disbelief, who would leave their child in the dead of night?</p><p>She quietly crept inside, careful not to wake up any of the children, and brought the newborn to fireplace where she feed him nourishment and flu-away potions. Minako charmed the baby’s blanket to radiate a cozy temperature and swaddled him into it. The child was adorable. Unruly, tuffs of raven black hair framed his face and his big doe eyes gave him an adorable chibi face. The babe possessed the most awestriking eyes, rich hazel eyes filled with wisdom.</p><p>“You are not like any ordinary baby, huh?” she whispered as she rocked him to sleep. She took out her wand and cast a spell to reveal his magical signature. The babe possessed a magical core but his signature was odd. It contained no ancestry links to his parents. She furrowed her eyebrows.</p><p>“How peculiar. Your magical core is so strong that it blocks others from discovering your ancestry and identity. Perhaps someone tampered with it?”</p><p>She stroked his hair and pondered, who is this child? Being one of the brightest witches of her age, she was troubled at this predicament and could not connect the dots. Days past and even Mediwitches and Mediwizards couldn’t identify who this child was.</p><p>“Mianko you should just name the child. In time, we will discover who this child is,” said Healer Rose.</p><p>“Are you sure he is not the long-lost Yuri Katsuki?” asked Minako holding the sleeping child.</p><p>“We are positive. We did blood tests and even flooed the Katsukis; it showed no correlation whatsoever,” Rose sighed as she stroked the drooling babe’s wispy hair, “The Ministry declared this child orphaned. The child service wizards should take him to the orphanage tomorrow.”</p><p>Tears poured from Minako’s eyes, “These children aren’t even a mouth old and they already have faced unbearable sorrow. My dear old friends Hiroko and Toshiya, Japan’s ministry declared their child dead yesterday,” cried Minako as Rose bowed her head.</p><p>“And the murderer? Has Nikolai Nikiforov been caught?” asked Rose in a frightful tone and the other witch nodded.</p><p>“He has. Hiroko, bless her soul, caught him at Scotland. She owled me that they have trialed him under Veritaserum and he confessed that he left their child for dead. Baby Yuri had a magical core that even rivaled Headmaster Potter- Malfloy, immense power that Nikiforov wanted for himself. That Death Eater scum was about to take Yuri’s magic until something stopped him... or he grew cold feet. Poor Minako does not even know the fate of her child,”</p><p>“What a horrid man! He deserves every ounce of suffering behind the Azkaban’s bars!” growled Rose as she blew her nose in her handkerchief.</p><p>Minako was silent for a while, gazing at the small child in her arms. “Then it’s settled. I shall name him Yuuri Okukawa in honor of the Katsuki’s lost son and I will raise him as my own”</p><p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>11 year later, Okukawa Orphange</p><p>A soft breeze swept past a small boy, ruffling his hair. Up on top of the highest hill in his village, the boy could see the orphanage in the distance. The cozy wooden cottage that managed to fit all 25 orphans, reflected in the light of the setting sun and glistened in the soft snow. As usual, the boy was practicing his ballet routine, hoping to impress Minako (who was like a mother to him) when she returned.</p><p>“Well if she returns” sighed the boy.</p><p>This boy was Yuuri and only Yuuri Okukawa by law, for he had no true family, no true home, and at the moment, no companionship. It was December 1, the day he has been abandoned at Minako’s orphanage and she was still nowhere to be found.</p><p>“Minako promised she would visit me on my birthday,” Yuuri mumbled, but he knew how busy the life of a Hogwarts professor is.</p><p>Hogwarts. Just the name left shivers in Yuuri’s mind and down his spine. Childhood stories of magic and a place far more exciting than Yuuri’s life flooded his mind. If only he could visit that magical place, but Minako told him he was too young to go to Hogwarts (Minako was far to protective). He dreamed for the moment when he received his letter, but it was almost night and he still hasn’t received one.</p><p>“Perhaps Minako has mistaken, I couldn’t possibly be a wizard,” whimpered Yuuri as he shivered from the unexpected wind and a strange laughter from above.</p><p>“Yuuri I’m hurt, when have I ever lied to you?” shouted a voice from above. Yuuri gasped as he looked above.</p><p>As promised, Minako had visited him and she flew circles above him on her Nimbus 3000.</p><p>“MINAKO!” laughed Yuuri as he waved at her from the clouds. She flew down the hill and Yuuri raced down to greet her. As soon as she dismounted, Yuuri launched himself at her.</p><p>“Oh, how I missed you Yuuri! HAPPY BIRTHDAY MY LOVE!!” exclaimed Minako as she embraced him, “I swear those Gryffindor brats are going to kill me one day”.</p><p>Yuuri laughed, Minako was the Head of the Hufflpuff House and she has constantly complained about the rowdy and obnoxious Gryffindor students.</p><p>“Each year I swear they keep getting more obnoxious than the last” complained Minako as they walked back to the cottage broom in hand, “Just today Mari Katsuki, despite demonstrating a splendid performance of transfiguration, has turned 2 of my Hufflepuffs and 3 Slytherins into Flobberworms. I know the poor dear is still in grief about these past days, but that gives her no right to lash out at other students!”</p><p>“Why is she grieving?” questioned Yuuri as they stopped at the cottage.</p><p>“Remember dear? The story of the Katsukis, a few days ago was the anniversary of the loss of their son and Mari’s brother,” sighed Minako, her face turning grave, “Good people, the Katsukis”</p><p>Yuuri nodded sadly. Yes, he knew of the travesty.</p><p>Her faced morphed into a smiled, “But on a lighter note” She grasped his shoulders and cackled, “Promise me when you go to Hogwarts, make that fucking Sorting Hat to allow you to join the greatest house ever, HUFFLEPUFF!”</p><p>Minako whipped out a letter out of her robes and gave it to Yuuri. His jaw dropped in realization, tears flowed out of Yuuri’s eyes, as he gazed at the letter.</p><p>“I’M GOING TO HOGWARTS!” shouted Yuuri.</p><p>Minako smiled, “Well next year you are, since the School year has already started. Before the beginning of the next school year, I will take you to Diagon Alley so we can buy your school supplies.”</p><p>Yuuri’s face fell upon this realization, but Minako picked him up and spun him around, “JUST YOU WAIT YUURI! SOON ENOUGH YOU WILL GO TO HOGWARTS!”</p><p>(Don't worry my little hashbrowns, baby Yuuri was given presents)</p><p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>August</p><p>"DIAGON ALLEY"</p><p>A sudden puff of fluorescent green smoke blocked the young boy's sight as he threw down his fistful full of floo powder. The boy yelped at the sudden feeling of falling. Yuuri's stomach dropped as he felt himself being transported and the sound of Minako's cackling slowly disappeared. This was Yuuri's first ever magical experience and to be honest, he was terrified and yet felt immense happiness that he never thought he could experience. The howling of wind abruptly stopped and his dragon-hide boots (a gift from Minako) touched the cobblestone of the fireplace. Yuuri stepped out of the fireplace quickly and then brushed of the dust off of his jeans and his limited edition Cinder Fall sweater (one of his many crushes besides the legend Harry Potter-Malfoy and Draco Potter-Malfloy). Before he could observe his surroundings, he heard the roar of the fireplace and his Mentor stepped out with an earsplitting grin.</p><p>Minako, first displaying a dramatic twirl in her mauve robes, opened her arms wide and announced, "Welcome Yuuri to the Leaky Cauldron!"</p><p>Unable to contain his excitement, Yuuri launched into her arms and she embraced him.</p><p>"I can't believe we are here! Is this where we buy my books? What wand do you think I will receive? You said the wand picks the wizard, wait- What if I'm not even a wizard? Wait I asked this already, Hogwarts letters never lie. OH Minako I'm so excited..." babbled Yuuri as he peered around the room.</p><p>It was spectacularly dingy room with ancient tables and chairs filled with unique and strange characters sitting at the bars and booths. The room was filled with pleasant laughter and chatting. There was the occasional burst of sudden sparks and flares of color that erupted from their wands, which left Yuuri awestruck.</p><p>"HAHAHA!" Boomed a loud voice from the bar, "Is this where you buy books? Ahaha Minako who is this amusing child?"</p><p>Minako smiled grew even larger and rolled her eyes.</p><p>She turned to the speaker, "Celestino! Keep your voice down, honesty no one wants to hear that obnoxious laugh of yours "</p><p>The newly dubbed Celestino got up from his stool and vigorously shook Minako's hand. He was a tall and burly man who resembled a lion; Yuuri was impressed by his mane of a hair.</p><p>"You know I can't! Minako I'm hurt" Rumble Celestino and he turned to Yuuri and ruffled his hair. Yuuri let out an adorable squeak as blushed from the attention and Celestino chuckled.</p><p>"This must be Yuuri! Minako has told me all about her outstanding pupil," he leaned forward and whispered, "I don't know how you survived Minako is absolutely terrifying!"</p><p>Minako slapped the back of Celestino's head and gasped dramatically.</p><p>"That I can agree,” she cackled as a terrible glint in her eye flashed, “He knows to never to make bets with me, remember the last House Cup?”</p><p>Celestino visibly shivered, “How could I forget? My students could never look at me the same when they saw me parade down the halls in a Sailor Moon costume, everything was tight in the wrong places,”</p><p>Minako patted his back, “At least your legs looked fantastic, but your John could've been hidden more,”</p><p>They all started laughing (at least the adults were for Yuuri was very confused about what a "John" was). After 5 minutes of discussion Yuuri soon found out that Celestino was the charms professor and the Head of Griffindor at Hogwarts and on top of it, he was Minako's "nemesis". There was a new rivalry between Slytherin, Griffindor, and Hufflepuff (Ravenclaw wanted nothing to do with this since they were always prepping for finals). Celestino turned out to be a charming and energetic man, and Yuuri automatically took a liking to him, despite being shy and flustered the whole time.</p><p>"Yuuri I look forward in having you in my house this year" Celestino said as he payed the bar man for his drinks.</p><p>"No way Yuuri is a total Hufflepuff," laughed Minako as she led him out of the pub both of them giggling as they waved goodbye to the wizard. She led him to the back of the building where they faced a tall brick wall. Yuuri gave his mentor a confused look but she gave him a small smirk and whipped out her wand out of her cloak. With a flick of her mahogany wand and a tap on the brick wall, a doorway began to form. Yuuri's eyes widened and glistened as the sight was revealed.</p><p>"Minako is this..."</p><p>She nodded, "Welcome Yuuri, to Diagon Alley"</p>
