    <h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
    <p>Muggle music filled the flat in the same way that the late spring air did.  It blew threw the windows and circled around the herbs and plants that hung from the ceiling and off of the walls making the flats look like an urban jungle.  A girl with dirty blonde hair that trailed down to her lower back sat, in lacy red underwear, straddled atop a gangly, freckled redhead.<br/>
She threw her head back and gave a raucous laugh that seemed to attach itself just as easily as the music to the spring breeze.<br/>
"Are you serious?"  A crooked grin broke across the freckled face exposing one chipped tooth, Luna's favorite tooth.  She put his chin between her thumb and pointer finger and laughed harder, peering into Ron's clear blue eyes.  "Honestly, Looney."  Ron placed his hands on her butt and scooched her as close as humanly possible to him.  "You laugh so hard at the most mental shit."  Yet the ringing of her laughter made his grin widen before he put his hand on the back of her neck and pulled her into a warm, soft kiss and started moving his hips to the rhythm of a soulful voice that rippled through the May morning.  Luna stopped laughing but let out a small moan, pulling back while Ron tugged on her bottom lip with his teeth.  She looked into his face with her doe-like eyes and raised an eyebrow.  That was it.  She could see it change in his face.<br/>
Ron was no longer thinking about his actions and movements now.  Instinct had kicked in.  He grabbed her ass, pushed into her as he stood from the couch, her legs straddling him.  He walked over to the canopied bed that he made fun of so much, dropped her onto her back and watched her laugh as she bounced slightly from the fall.  He raised one eyebrow and asked  "Think this is a game, Lovegood?"<br/>
She perched herself up on her elbows to get a good look at Ron's long, strong body and the freckles that dotted it like the constellations that kept her up until 3am some nights.  She looked directly into her eyes with a devilish grin and said "Yes, Weasley.  I positively do."  	He dropped down onto his knees and inched toward the bed.  Luna's heartbeat a little faster.  He could call her Looney all day long she couldn't really care less what nicknames he preferred for her.  As long as he kept on like this.<br/>
Ron reached the edge of Luna's bed and pulled one of her legs outward.  He traced his fingers around her thigh in circles and abstract shapes both tickling Luna and making her tingle with lust.  She watched him look up to check that her breathing had softened and deepened.  He traced his fingers higher.  Her alarm for work started to go off.  He slipped both index fingers under her red lacy underwear and asked her in a much different tone than he had used on her earlier if she'd prefer him to stop what he was doing so she could get ready.<br/>
"No."  She stated plainly.  Ron loved when Dreamy Luna became Decisive Luna.  When soft and airy Luna turned into needy and sexy.<br/>
He pulled her underwear down, living for the moment she lifted her hips so he could slide his hands beneath her and grab her ass.  He leaned into her and gave her a knowing smile before he traced his tongue, soft and warm, around her clitoris.  He moaned into her, he loved tasting her.  She was so different than anyone he'd ever been with.  She tasted like flowers and rain and springtime.  He continued expressing his pleasure because he knew she loved the vibrations.  He heard her fumbling for something to grab.<br/>
"Anything but that."  He had said the first time they clumsily slept together, drunk off of firewhisky and Mugwort Mead.  She had woven her fingers through his hair and tugged, pulling, what felt like, most of his hair follicles out of his scalp.<br/>
She grabbed the duvet cover and watched her knuckles go white as she moved her hips in coordination with his tongue.  He watched her struggle not to cum as explored her with his tongue and fingers.<br/>
"Ron,"  She breathed.  He interpreted it as needing more and kept going.<br/>
"No Ron,"  She said once more, breathlessly.  He pulled away.  She smiled and summoned him closer to her with a finger.  He laughed.<br/>
"That's it, Luna?"  He mimed checking a watch but she was already upright, helping him to his feet.  he slid his briefs down his legs, taking him in her mouth and throwing him off track.  "Jesus."   He accidentally yelled aloud, causing her to giggle.  "Couldn't- Christ.  Little warning, Lu- fuck.  Okay.  Cool."  He grabbed a post of the canopied bed and felt himself melting away on her tongue as she moved up and down his fully hard cock.  Her windows were open and he couldn't help but wonder what the fuck this could possibly look like to the neighbors.  He imagined, momentarily, if he could pull off a casual wave if anyone on the street looked up and chortled to himself but immediately forgot what he was laughing about as she started this swallowing motion that made her throat tighten up in the most delicious way.  He felt his knees start to shake.<br/>
"Nope!  Merlin's fucking sake, L.  You are not going to kill me like that."  He pulled her up from the floor and pushed her back on the bed.  She pushed herself up and took her bra off about thirty seconds faster than Ron had ever been able to.  He was grateful.  Her breasts were perfection.  He moved onto the bed and over her, loving the way she made him feel protective and strong.  She laid under him and smiled up at him with a goofy grin.<br/>
"What?"  He whispered down to her, not really caring for an answer.  He just liked staring at the dreamy pixie face.<br/>
"You."  She leaned up and whispered back, making him shiver.  She pulled him down into a kiss while grabbing his dick and guiding it into her.  He growled into her mouth and started thrusting.  The canopied matching the rhythm of his movements, making certain that anyone who peered up into that exact window knew exactly what was going on.</p><p> </p><p>	*five weeks earlier*</p><p>	"Come off it, mate.  I'd be mental to spend the first night Ginny's back with the both of you."  Ron sighed as Harry sat on his couch, attempting persuasion.<br/>
"Ron- you sit here when you're not at work and, to be honest, it's a bit depressing.  You know Hermione and Ginny spent the last three months in Bulgaria.  It's not like you haven't had enough time to move on."  But he definitely hadn't.  Ron spent his latter years at Hogwarts worrying that he wasn't good enough for Hermione.  He spent the two years after Hogwarts trying to outdo the guys that Hermione was surrounded by at the ministry.  He spent his entire life trying to exceed or at least live up to the reputation of any of his brothers- hoping taking a job at the joke shop with George would help his brother heal from the loss of Fred.  Ron just felt so spread thin.  Trying to live up to everyone's expectation while being accepted for his own.<br/>
He'd definitely let his jealousy get the best of him.  He spent the last three minds sorting through the stupid rows he insisted on having most weekends.  The last massive one that ended in Hermione packing the pajamas from his top drawer in her enchanted purse and screaming at him, her warm brown eyes filled with tears of hurt and frustration.<br/>
"RON STOP IT!"  She screamed.  "I thought this was through."  She sobbed, her bag hanging from her hand and her chest heaving.  "You told me you worked through this the winter we went horcrux hunting.  Why have we gone over this at least once a month since the war?"<br/>
"WHY ARE YOU STILL TALKING TO KRUM?!"  Ron threw the glass orb he was spitefully going to hand to Hermione while she stood there,  a sneakoscope given to him on their first night together after she secured a spot as an intern at the ministry of magic.  He regretted it immediately as he watched her shrink back from him.  Something in her face changed had changed from loving anger to fear and distrust.<br/>
"I've always told you we were going to remain friends, Ron... He loves you."  She whimpered but her breathing was gathering speed and he saw a force building behind her eyes.  "I've supported you since we were 11.  I've spent my entire youth making sure you felt included and never second to anyone, Harry included."  He watched her knuckles whiten as she tightened her grip on her purse.  "I've wasted my teens watching you get up over Lavender Fucking Brown While I waited for you to realize that I was special, Ron.  You never had to watch me suck the tongue of another guy in the FUCKING COMMON ROOM."  Ron shrank back as Hermione's voice raised in volume and shrillness.  "Oh no, Ronald Weasley- don't you dare act like I'm the volatile one here.  Remember when Fred died- don't wince.  He died, Ron.  He died.  Just like saying Voldemort.  Everyone has to make you feel safe, Ron.  I'm tired.  I spent my entire life proving you're the only man I want to be with yet every night I go for drinks after work I have to answer question after question.  I'm done."  The words left her lips and he watched the resolve in her eyes and he fucking hated himself.  He knew he had pushed her to this point.<br/>
He had tried to.  He knew this was coming for months.  He was pushing her away.  He opened his mouth to say anything- apologize, ask her to wait, get her to forget this fight ever happened- but she raised her hand in swift motion, waving away his attempt to speak.<br/>
"No.  You've done it.  Self-fulfilling prophecy Ron."  He pushed her bag up her arm to hang off of her shoulder and she turned to grab the doorknob.  "I need some time.  A lot of time."  She pushed the door open and left, not looking back at him once.  </p><p>	"MATE."  Harry snapped a finger, bringing Ron's attention back to present.<br/>
"Shit, sorry Harry."  He realized he had been completely absent while Harry walked around his kitchen, opening Ron's fridge and pantries make them both sandwiches.<br/>
"Yeah."  Harry used the back of his hand, knife still in grasp, to wipe his forehead and push his hair out of his eyes.  "You've been a space case for ages, Ron.  Y'think maybe you ought to see someone?"<br/>
"A healer?"  Ron stared at his dirty nails while he answered.<br/>
"Yeah.  A healer- muggles use therapists, Ron.  Therapists are literally paid to listen to you talk about your feelings."  Ron gave Harry a bemused look.<br/>
"What nutters."  He laughed but Harry looked at him, sincerely.<br/>
"I went to one, mate."<br/>
"What?"<br/>
"Yeah,"  Harry set a sandwich down in front of Ron that looked like a really good attempt at his mother's level of cooking.  "I had a really hard time opening up to Ginny when I got back."  Harry said through a mouthful of sandwich, with mayonnaise on his lip.  "Dudley reached out of me shortly after, as well, making sure if I was still alive."  Harry chuckled.  "He told me he had started university and had started speaking to the school counselor.  Who knew Dudley had actual emotions?"  Harry continued to chortle while Ron, for the first time in days, noticed his stomach growling and lifted his sandwich to his mouth.<br/>
"Is he still huge?"  Ron asked, offhand, wanting a lighter subject.<br/>
"Oh, mate.  He's had a rough go of it but he's figuring out his stuff.  He also said since he's moved out he isn't bombarded with cakes and roasts every night, though."  </p><p> </p><p>	Ron regretted it immediately.  Ginny pushed the door open to the pub and rain splattered the welcome mat.  Behind her was Luna Lovegood and Katie Bell.<br/>
"Harry!  Ron!"  She laughed, heartily, and threw her arms around the both of them as she threw the bartender a little wave.<br/>
"Ginny."  Bill said, while grabbing a glass off of the shelf.  "Firewhiskey?"<br/>
"Of course, Billy!"  She laughed.<br/>
"Thought maybe Bulgaria might've changed your tastes."<br/>
"It did."  She smiled, mischievously.  "I want it neat, these days."<br/>
"Blimey, Gin."  Ron nudged her with his elbows.  "You're drinking like Charlie."<br/>
"Somebody is the family has to have taste."<br/>
"So tell us about training, Gin."  Harry said, scooting his bar stool closer to Ron to make room for the three girls.<br/>
"Krum killed her!"  Katie laughed.  "The Holyhead Harpies are going to have to bump her to first string chaser when they see the new moves she pulled on me in the pitch yesterday!"<br/>
"You were back yesterday?  I thought you got in this morning."  Harry shot ginny a questioning glance.<br/>
"Calm down, bedhead."  She scruffed his hair and leaned in for a deep kiss that made Ron shudder with disgust.  "I wanted to be completely rested up when I saw you.  Also shut up Ron.  We've sat through many a Christmas where Fleur snogs Bill.  I could up my game if you'd like."<br/>
"No.  God no."  He winced, remembering.<br/>
"We spotted Luna at Flourish &amp; Blotts!  We stopped in to invite her down."  Ginny smiled at everyone<br/>
"Yeah, we haven't seen Looney's since Fred's... y'know."  Ron trailed off and raised his glass out of respect for his late brother.<br/>
"Ron."  Ginny shot him a warning glare.  "Don't call her that."<br/>
"It's okay, Ginny."  Luna threw him and airy smile and said "Roonil loves a good laugh."<br/>
"Oh my god!"  Harry choked on his butterbeer.  "I forgot about that."<br/>
"Yeah yeah."  Ron's cheeks reddened and he lifted his glass to Luna now, "Cheers Lovegood, fair game."</p><p> </p><p>	"Another round for this lot!"  Ginny stood from the circular table they now presided over and Bill nodded.  A tray of fire whiskeys swiftly cut through the air and settled on the table, not a single drop wasted.<br/>
"AYYY!"  A chorus of applause for Bill let out.  Luna was laughing a throaty laugh that took Ron aback.  He had never heard her voice go deeper than the level of a bird's chirp before.<br/>
"So Ron,"  She noticed his eyes had landed on her and he, for some reason, became quickly embarrassed, averting his glance.  "Where's Hermione?"  The table quieted.<br/>
"Sorry, Ron, we hadn't told her."  Ginny blurted and Harry cleared his throat.<br/>
"S'Alright."  Ron straightened up.  "We broke up."<br/>
"Oooh..."  Her giant orbish eyes moved from his down his chest and then quickly to the table.  "Sorry about that."  She traced the lip of her glass with her fingers.  "I've missed a lot when I moved."<br/>
"Yeah, how was America?"  Ron felt this change of topic rather naturally.  For once he didn't feel his stomach knot up at the thought of Hermione and her spending three winter months snuggled up in Bulgaria while her first high school flame tutored his sister.<br/>
"Oh it was splendid.  I spent most of the past two years in New York."<br/>
"I thought you were only going for a year?"  Ginny questioned her.<br/>
"I stayed."  Luna shrugged.  "I met someone."<br/>
"Oh?"  Ron leaned in.  "Who's the lucky bastard?"  Ron laughed.  "I always thought you and Neville could have had something."<br/>
"Ooh."  Luna laughed.  "He's a wonderful friend, I'm invited to his wedding next year-"<br/>
"NEVILLE'S GETTING MARRIED?!"  Ginny slammed a fist down on the table.  "I feel horrible."  She looked thoroughly flummoxed.<br/>
"He hasn't told anyone yet!"  Luna assured her, dreamily.  "We write eachother once a week since we left school.  Hannah Abbott and he started dating when she starting working at the apothecary.  He spends a lot of time there, you know."<br/>
"Hannah Abbott?"  Harry thought aloud.  "She was the mousey blonde hufflepuff that joined the DA, right?"<br/>
"Exactly."  Luna went on.  "He's going to propose to her in a few weeks time and he hopes they'll be married within the year because he has a splendid trip booked."  SHe sighed.  "He's going to take her to South America to spend a month in the jungle gathering studying herbs and gathering seedlings so he can start his own garden.  He wants it to be their honeymoon."<br/>
"What a shotty honeymoon."  Ron pushed away his empty firewhiskey glass.  "Getting all stinky and sweaty next to the person you just vowed your life too while getting eaten alive by insects and worrying if you're going to step on snakes?  I'd turn him down."<br/>
Luna started laughing so hard, firewhiskey shot out of her nose,  "I just spent the year traveling with Rolf and we broke up over it."<br/>
"Oh yeah!"  Ron sat up, interest renewed.  "We were talking about Luna's love life."<br/>
"I haven't got one anymore!"  Luna pushed his arm and he felt a swoop in his chest.  He wasn't liking Looney Lovegood or anything, it was just the firewhiskey, he stated to himself in his mind.  "We spent a year studying his great grandfather's journals and then another year chasing beasts that nobody has proven existed."  She said, simply.  "And although I loved it I missed home, as well."  She shrugged.  "We simply disagreed about our ideas of home and I said I needed a break."<br/>
"Oh I'm sorry Luna."  Ginny put a hand on Luna's arm.  "I saw your posts together on the wizarding web.  He was right handsome."<br/>
"Yeah, he was downright wonderful."  Luna said dreamily.  "It's okay.  Ending love isn't always permanent."  She pushed her now-empty glass to the center of the table like Ron had.  "Anyone for another round?  My treat?"  She said with a bribing look around the table.<br/>
"We've got early practice,"  Katie sighed.  "And all this talk about romance is making me miss Alicia like crazy."  She looked down at her watch.<br/>
"She's right."  Ginny sighed.  "I can't be completely undone my first day back or they won't ever let me take training holidays again."  She stood up and stretched, looking at Harry.<br/>
"We all know I'm leaving when she is."  Harry smiled up at Ginny and she caressed his cheek.<br/>
"Well I'd love another one."  Ron smiled at Luna.<br/>
"That settles it."  Luna smiles.  "On one condition."<br/>
"What?"<br/>
"We're going to muggle London."  She smirked.  "I just love this little tavern and I've been dying to take a fellow wizard there since I've gotten back."</p><p> </p><p>	After many assurances that he would get Luna home safely to Ginny Ron and Luna stepped out onto the wet pavement and breathed in the night air, clean from a day of rain.<br/>
"I love this smell."  Luna smiled up at the now cloudless sky.  "Ready?"<br/>
"Okay, don't judge me,"  He started.  "I never actually got my apparition license."<br/>
Luna started laughing to his bemusement.<br/>
"Okay, Luna, if you're arm had been mangled almost to the point of no return you'd be a little reserved about it, too."<br/>
"Ron, It's fine."  SHe said, still laughing.  "Floor powder just won't work if we pop into a room full of unexpecting muggles.  Here."  She looked from left to right and pulled him into the nearest alleyway.  "You can apparate with me."<br/>
"Why are we hiding, you nutter."  Ron furrowed his eyebrows, feeling his toes tingle- warm from the firewhiskey.<br/>
"I don't know."  Luna whispered.  "I just never like apparating plop in the middle of the road.  I guess it's from living in New York for two years."  She beamed up at him positioning herself directly in front of him, her blonde hair framed by the brick building behind her.  Her hair glowed from the light of the full moon despite them being tucked between two tall buildings.<br/>
"That's beautiful."  She said, nodding her head upward towards the moon."<br/>
"Yup."  He said, staring at her pouty bottom lip.<br/>
"Here."  She held out her two hands, not looking up at him innocently.  He took one while he let firewhiskey guide his other hand to her waist.  In the blink of an eye he had her against the brick wall and he had bent down to press his lips against her soft pastel pink ones.  He could smell baby's breath flowers in her hair and lilacs on her skin and felt a tug upwards and a blurry, dizzying swirl.  He kept his lips pressed against hers until his feet hit solid ground again and he stepped away noticing that the wall behind her was now cement and there was an old wooden two story house behind him instead of a brick bookstore.<br/>
"That's a new way to apparate."  She smiled up at him.<br/>
"Guess I don't hate it that much, it seems."</p><p> </p><p>		Ron woke up with a pounding head, eyes watering as he squinted into the unforgiving morning sun.  There was a cup of coffee on a light blue whimsically North African bedside table his right.  The steam waved over to him as he gathered his surroundings.  There were flower pots hanging from the ceiling and ivy strewn across from desktop to dresser to every post of this annoyingly girly four poster bed.  The lacey pastel pink canopy did nothing to help him block the sun out.  What use was this anyway.  His heart hammered as he heard a light and lilting voice singing along to a radio in a room beyond this one.<br/>
He sat up to find be had slept in his jeans, flannel and, uncomfortably, his trainers.  He rubbed his head, deciding in the moment that he needed a haircut as a strand poked him, painfully in his already watery eyes.<br/>
He stepped out of the bedroom doorway to the smell of warm and delicious food cooking.  He heard the clatter of pans and plates.<br/>
"I'm out here, Ronald!"  An eerily airy voice called out to him.  His throat tightened up and he considered bolting out of what, he guessed, was the front door that was in the middle of two large windows also cluttered with pots and pots of plants, one above a grey couch that seemed less squashy than anything his mother had ever owned.  He decided against making a break for it after he realized how thick he'd look if it happened to be a closet.<br/>
He stepped into the kitchen to the scene of Luna Lovegood scrambling what looked like eggs as she flicked a wand and four pieces of toasts started buttering themselves.<br/>
"Er.."  He started, unsure of what to say ,exactly.  "Goodmornin' Luna."  He felt his cheeks grow hot.<br/>
"Don't be embarrassed, Ron."  She turned to smile at him as, with another flick of her wand, the coffee cup that had sat beside him as he woke flew past his arm and sat itself at a place on the round turquoise breakfast table.  "Nothing happened.  You starting vomiting around two and I brought you here to sleep it off."  She smiled, reassuringly, as the two toasts sat themselves on plates at the table beside the two hot and full cups of coffee.<br/>
"Oh..."  He rubbed the back of his neck.  "It's not like, well.  You know."<br/>
"Yeah.  We'd make an odd pair, Weasley."  She laughed, this time keeping her eyes on the eggs as she made the pan float to each dish and portioned them each out some.  "Breakfast?"<br/>
"Always."  He halfheartedly laughed, relieved beyond belief.  He sat across from her, wondering why he had let himself get so stupid last night.  He knew he had to have looked like a git.  "These eggs taste a little weird, Luna- don't get me wrong, I really appreciate breakfast.   But..."  He chewed over the texture of what seemed to be a somewhat slightly undercooked egg.<br/>
Luna laughed, seemingly unoffended.  "I don't have eggs here.  It's tofu."  He grimaced.<br/>
"Wha?"<br/>
"Tofu."  She chewed happily.  "I don't eat eggs."<br/>
"Well."   He said looking down as the now seemingly huge mound of yellow blobs that were now completely foreign to him.<br/>
"Oh good lord."  She laughed.  "We'll go out then." </p><p> </p><p>	"So how was your night?"  Harry had stopped into the joke shop with Ginny before Ron had even gotten there.<br/>
"I'm glad you and Luna could hang out.  You're both moving on from stuff."  Ginny said, distractedly as she moved down an aisle past a swarm of homeschooled looking witches who were ogling at the daydream charm packs.<br/>
"Yup.  It was pretty boring."  He shot quickly.  Harry narrowed his eyes at Ron but if he suspected anything, he said nothing.<br/>
"You know, I think the break is good for you and Hermione.  You really need to figure out what you want, Ron."  Ginny kept at it while Harry seemed to be studying Ron carefully.<br/>
"Yep.  Really great time, Gin."  He cleared his throat.  "Mate, you trying to etch a map of my face or what?"  Harry cocked his head but kept moving alongside Ginny down the aisle.<br/>
"No I'm serious!  And I just know Rolf and Luna are made for each other but sometimes a break to just be with friends is what everyone really needs."<br/>
"Is it?"  Harry asked her half teasing but half curious.<br/>
"Sometimes."  She turned to stare at him as she brought him into a kiss.<br/>
"This is a public shop, you lot.  Get out if you're trying to give a show."  Ron rolled his eyes.<br/>
"So Ron.  Where did you guys go last night?"  Harry pulled away and made towards Ron.  Ron busied himself behind the counter, adjusting and restacking the small bits and bobs that lay near the register.<br/>
"Well she announced to all of you.  We went to that muggle place downtown."<br/>
"Yeah but I rang this morning and there was no answer."  Ron felt his face grow hot again.<br/>
"What are you on about, Harry?  Luna would never"  but she stopped when she saw the flush in Ron's cheeks.  "Oh no Ron!  Come on, rebounds are fine and well and all but it's supposed to be outside of your regular friend group."<br/>
"Hey!  That's unfair we all know Luna and I aren't regular mates."  Ron said and tried to counter the too-quick defense with "And nothing even happened anyway."<br/>
"Right."  Harry smirked as he set skiving snackboxes on the counter.  "For Dudley.  He's hating Uni."<br/>
"You really tried something, didn't you?"  Ginny kept up, not taking Ron's pretense of deafness for one moment.<br/>
"Tried something?  Ginny I'm not a creep lurking in the shadows!  What do you take me for."<br/>
"A creep lurking in the shadows."  She shot back flatly.  "Take it back.  Be kind but tell Luna you can only be friends."<br/>
"We didn't do anything!"  He raised his hands in defense.  "I'm serious!  She let me stay at hers because I drank too much and got sick everywhere."  He said, purposefully omitting the kiss he was still sober enough to remember from the night before.<br/>
"You swear it?"  Ginny said throwing down a few galleons.<br/>
"I swear it."<br/>
"Good.  Because Hermione spent the better of three months waiting for an owl from you."  Ginny scowled.  "And Luna is too nice for you."  </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>	Luna danced around her apartment in a swingy lace dress watering all of her lovely littel herbs and greenery.  She had moved through half of her record collection since she got back.  One thing New York taught her was that muggles had wonderful ways of listening to music but records were her favorite.  The way the needle scratched when she first placed it down reminded her of her Gran's house and taking swing lessons from her Grandfather.  She bent over the couch to water a plant that was slightly out of her reach when she stepped on something soft.<br/>
She looked down at the light brown peacoat and maroon scarf and smiled.  The R in a dazzling gold knit smiled back up at her.  She looked outside at the bright sun that ducked in and out of clouds that rolled westward.<br/>
"What do you reckon, Melford?"  She asked her favorite fiddlehead fern and watched its leaves rustle in a slightly-too-cool early April breeze.  She checked the watch she'd been snt for her birthday months prior by Neville.  It held a collection of flowers and herbs instead of number and times and she quite loved it.  He had spotted it at an herbal alchemist's convention and knew he had to get it for her and she adored him for this.  "Shall we ask Neville over for a cup?"  Melford's leaves rustled eagerly and she nodded in agreement.  </p><p>	The familiar light knocks drifted through the hallway to Luna's bedroom as she finished watering the very last of her plants.  "Right-y-o, Jonathan."  She smiled at the Mugwort plant that hung directly over her nightstand.<br/>
"What a sight for sore eyes."  Neville smiled as she pulled the door open to reveal his even more handsome face.<br/>
"Wow."  She gasped.  "You look lovely!"  She watched Neville grow crimson as he laughed and shook a hand through his windswept hair.  "Hannah Abbott is one lucky woman."<br/>
"Thanks, Lun.  I've missed you dearly."  He stepped in and without a moment's hesitation enveloped her in one of his staple bear hugs.  "Getting on okay?"<br/>
"Always."  She said, breathing in the scent of earth and moss and pushing him back to get a good look at her dear best friend.  "I've been back for weeks and we've yet to get back into patterns."<br/>
"Oh don't think I've forgotten,"  He grinned and pulled out an elaborate piece of glass from his pocket.  "I think I've created the perfect strain."  He made two "OK" signs with both his hands and threw a baggy towards Luna.<br/>
"My genius best friend."  She beamed.  </p><p> </p><p>	The plants hung in clouds of smoke as blissful voices shot back and forth.<br/>
"And he didn't know what tofu was?  Are you serious?"  Neville choked a cough back, laughing too hard.<br/>
"To be fair I don't think he'd eat vegetables unless they were covered in something that had died previously."<br/>
"Luna, you cannot be contemplating this."  Neville looked at her incredulously.  "He's rude!"<br/>
"You like Harry."  She replied.<br/>
"Yeah, well Harry's got the sense to be polite and- well!  You like Harry, too."<br/>
"Exactly.  I think Ron's not as dense as he lets on, Neville.  The kiss was just wonderful."<br/>
"You were apparating, Luna.  Any chance maybe that was the feeling that dominated the kiss?"<br/>
"Oh Neville!"  She rolled her great big eyes and grabbed the bag of crisps he held so that she could grab a handful.  "You out of all of us should understand not to pass judgement so quickly."<br/>
"Luna, he's an okay guy and all but every time I've been round to drink with the guys he's always asking what Hannah's name is."<br/>
"You can't expect him to know everyone's names.  He meets hundreds of people a day at the joke shop."  She threw her hands up.<br/>
"He's met her."  Neville said in a deadpan tone.  "Multiple times."<br/>
"Well..."  Luna say thinking of something to say back was popping chips into her mouth.  "Okay, get this,"  She sat upright.  "What if I'm just curious?"<br/>
"Hermione will loathe you."<br/>
"Oh please."  Luna laughed, dreamily.  "She's always thought I was a bother."<br/>
"Has not."  Neville defended.<br/>
"Just because she was in your house and nice to you does not mean she's a saint."  Luna replied, matter-of-factly.  "Besides, when Ron found out about your mum and dad you said he was way nicer than you'd expected."<br/>
"Luna."  Neville sighed heavily.  "If you want to play with that specific brand of fire, I will not stop you. You've been through a lot lately.  But please, just don't go thinking he's someone he's not.  He's a fine guy, but you need a great guy."  Neville had grabbed the bag of crisps again while giving her a furtive glance.<br/>
She beamed back at him.  "Nev,  Hannah is a marvelous person and I'm so excited for you to have someone in your life that you deserve,"  and paused for a while before adding "But also I'm going to do what I will either way." and smiling. </p><p> </p><p>	Ron stepped off the Nimbus he had purchased weeks ago, adjusting his pants and jacket and looking up and down the walk.  He hadn't a clue why he was here but he had also been undoubtedly curious for the past week.  He looked up to see twinkles of lights on strings and the blue lace curtains that did nothing to block the sun but looked exactly like Luna in the moonlight, dreamy and whimsical.<br/>
"Get it together, Weasley."  He urged himself  "In or out but not gawking in the street."  As if she had overheard him somehow, Luna stepped out onto the fire escape that Ron remembered debating whether or not it was a doorway to bolt through the first time he had been here.<br/>
"Oh!  Ron!"  She beamed down, while hanging two plants on the metal bars that surrounded a small secure area to stand on.  "Just head up the backstairs."<br/>
"Thanks."  He replied, actually grateful for having not remembered how he had gotten to her apartment the time before and having apparated with Luna when they left for actual real breakfast.<br/>
"Good to see you!"  He smiled up him when she opened the door and he tried to ignore the swoop that once again went off in his stomach as he noticed how much shorter he was when she stood so close.<br/>
"Sure, Lovegood.  What's up?"  He said.  "You said it was urgent in your owl."<br/>
"Well,"  She said completely unaffected by his short tone.  "I heard the last two cold nights of the season are coming in and I figured you'd might need these back."  She held out his jacket and scarf and he laughed.<br/>
"I have millions of those, Lovegood."  He grabbed them anyways.  "My mum makes a scarf on every cold holiday.  I'll never catch a cold."<br/>
"Well that's wonderfully prepared of her."  She smiled back at him, lighting some large thick deep purple candles that set on a wooden coffee table between that gray couch and her large bookcase.  Within about a million books was a tiny old fashioned TV that reminded Ron of the one his parents had in the living room of the burrow- the one that only played things in black and white.<br/>
"Nice TV."  He smiled.<br/>
"It's for news, mainly."  She said, not looking back at him.  He wasn't sure if he was supposed to leave now.  It seemed awfully off to be called to someones house at 7pm just for a scarf and jacket.<br/>
"Cool."  He said, feeling dumb not having something better to add.  He could have kicked himself for being nervous around Looney Lovegood.<br/>
"One might say, yes.  I've seen better, though."<br/>
"Huh?"  He realized he had been trailed off into a barrage of thoughts about how thick he must sound.<br/>
"The tv?"  She stood up and surveyed him.  "You seem odd today, Weasley."<br/>
He couldn't suppress his laughter at being called odd by Luna.  "Yeah."  He replied. "I'm a little out of it, lately."<br/>
"I saw Hermione the other day."  He felt immediately annoyed at this.  Why was she bringing up Hermione right now?  Unless she had scrubbed the kiss from her mind completely and was now trying to needle him like Ginny into talking about his feelings.  He could sit within himself and be miserable on his own, thank you very much.<br/>
"Yeah?"  He shot a glare her way.  "Good for you."<br/>
"She seemed pleased to see me."  Luna stated, dreamily offering him some tea and he shook his head.  "It was nice.  Even though she always acted to frustratedly at me when we were younger."<br/>
"Yeah she can be that way."<br/>
"Rigid?"  Luna asked and Ron appreciated Luna's sometimes blunt honestly.<br/>
"Yeah.  Rigid."  He realized that might be exactly why he was here right now.  Luna was fluid.  Like air.  No exact shape but still existing.  Nothing really containing her.  He appreciated the blue flowers that were braided into her hair and let himself feel a twinge of adoration for the small witch that stood before him.<br/>
"I told Neville that I like you."<br/>
"Sorry?"  He almost coughed, taken aback.<br/>
"When we were hanging out yesterday."  She smiled and headed to her kitchen, apparently adamant to pour him some tea anyway.<br/>
"No I mean you like me?  Why would you say a thing like that?"  Ron asked a little too quickly.<br/>
"Because I do."  She shrugged.  "If you don't like me that's fine, but I figured if you came over tonight you probably returned the feelings."<br/>
"What?  Luna that's a mental thing to bet someone feelings on."  He took the cup of floral tea she handed him.<br/>
"He figured the same."<br/>
"Because Neville has sense."<br/>
Luna laughed and casually said "I'll have to tell him you said that."<br/>
"You're telling him that I came over here?"<br/>
"Of course.  I haven't anyone else to talk to about this odd situation."  She handed him a jar of sugar and he spooned some into his shallow cup not realizing it was possibly way too much.  "It's not like I'm going to confide in my only girl friend since she's your sister."<br/>
"No!"  Ron spit his tea back into the mug due to both the sugar level and the thought of Ginny finding out he had come back to Luna's apartment.  "She'd kill me."<br/>
"I'm a bit out there compared to your friends, Ron.  But I'm not stupid."  She cocked her head to the side and seemed to stare at him or past him but she was looking somewhere deep within him, he felt.  He shifted uncomfortably.  "You seem alright."<br/>
"Thanks?"  He said, putting his cup down.  "I put too much sugar in this."<br/>
"I saw."  She grinned, pulling her wand out of her braided hair and flicked it, music came from the living room.<br/>
"Want to see some pictures from Siberia?  I saw a Ruffled Mufflewamp there."  She beamed up at him seeming very pleased with herself.<br/>
"No."  He paused, chucked out his moral compass, and leaned down close enough to smell that lilac smell that drifted off of her.<br/>
"Oh."  She said softly as he was about an inch away from her face now.  "Alright."  and he leaned in to continue what they had started in the alleyway a week ago.</p><p> </p><p>	"Stop it, Ron!"  A high pitch laugh arose from Luna as they lay in bed, hours after they actually woke up thanks to Luna's wonderful knack for the Accio charm.  They lay reading The Quibbler and The Prophet while Luna filled their coffee mugs every time they got to a level where the coffee was cold and sour.  She had mastered the art of non-verbal charms and spells at the age of 17 she had once told him, as a tray of cookies came floating past his head as he sat across the couch and she draped her legs across his.<br/>
Ron sat cross-legged reading The Daily Prophet half heartedly while breathing obnoxiously hard so as to make the tops of the pages of The Quibbler flutter as Luna's eyes scanned from left to right. SHe could always ignore these little teases until he started fake coughing to get her attention.  She let out a high laugh and watched his eyes crinkle as he achieved his desired effect.  He loved that making Luna laugh was something he was always good at, no matter what mood she was in.  He hadn't quite realized it but he also loved that in the past four weeks since he started staying over at hers more than just once or twice he had begun to easily decipher her moods and sighs.<br/>
"It's 10 am, I reckon."  He leaned over and kissed her languidly and she placed her hand on the soft, warm spot on his neck where she could always feel his pulse as it quickened.  "I have to go."  He whispered in her ear and a shiver down her spine and he lightly bit her soft, pale earlobe.<br/>
"You could always stay."  She whispered back and started trailing her fingers down his abdomen.<br/>
"I can always come back."  He grabbed her hand and started kissing her neck, it was more of an ask than a statement and he listened to her breath hoping she would say she'd love to have him back again.  A pang in his stomach suddenly brought to his attention how easy it had been start adoring someone.  He had gone from agonizing over the missing nest of frizzy brown hair he used to wake up to, to anticipating when he would open his eyes and see rosey cheeks, soft pale pink lips and silky dirty blonde tresses softly breathing, a hand reaching towards Ron in a way that suggested that she had tried to hold him throughout the night.<br/>
"I would love that."  She came him a sweet, short kiss as he left the bed, feeling happy and secure in knowing he was wanted by the cutest, oddest person he'd ever met.  </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>	Ron tried his hardest to type his intended message as he had owned his muggle cell phone for only a week.  It was something Luna talked him into but it wasn't entirely her doing.  Harry had insisted for two years Ron purchased one.  Harry also spent hours on end explaining them to Mum and Dad and seemingly loving every time Arthur sent him a jumbled line of words.<br/>
"It's quite funny."  Harry turned his screen outward to show Ron a screen that read<br/>
Arthur W (Dad Weasley)</p><p> </p><p>            	9:42pm<br/>
"It's Molly press the button arthur<br/>

"Last night I got a bunch of emoji ducks and a thumbs up."  Harry laughed, spilling a bit of butterbeer on the counter and apologizing to Bill, profusely.<br/>
"Guys, I have to run.  Girls are meeting in twenty."  Ginny stood up from the bar, waving at Bill.  "Love you Harry."  She bent down to kiss Harry's sun tanned face and Ron didn't grimace as usual.  "You too, idiot."  She smiled at her brother.<br/>
"Yeah, yeah.  See ya later, Ginny."<br/>
"I think I ought to go."  Ron said, peering down that the message that lingered on the screen. </p><p>	Looney</p><p> </p><p>	9:58pm<br/>

Read 9:58pm</p><p>	10:01pm<br/>
Not a worry!  Ginny's<br/>
invited me round for<br/>
drink! Text you when<br/>
I've finished<br/>
L</p><p>	"Shit."  Ron accidentally said aloud.<br/>
"Well yeah, I'd always rather hang just us but we've been invited and I already said we would.  So we have to."<br/>
"I'm sorry, mate.  What are you on about?  I wasn't listening."  Ron cleared his throat and pulled his attention back to Harry.<br/>
"Oh.  Well Dean and Seamus invited all the our year Gryffindors round to their new flat.  It's in the middle of London.  Plenty of great pubs, they said."<br/>
"Sounds great."  Ron said absently as his mind wandered to whether or not this night would end in Ginny's rage.  </p><p> </p><p>	"Ay!"  A chorus of whoops and yelps let out as Ron pushed the pub doors open and stepped into the warm, thick air.  The smell of hoppy beers wafted outward and Harry stepped next to ron, taking his light jacket off in the pub heat.<br/>
"They're not much for subtly, are they?"  Harry grinned at Ron and led the way over to the table.  Ron always liked Dean and Seamus and he hadn't stopped once in the few years outside of Hogwarts halls but at the moment he was too distracted to be as excited as he normally would have been to see their grinning faces.  He surveyed the table they had reserved, a big round wooden table filled with bottles and pitchers of various beers.  One thing to raise his worries was muggle pubs.  He loved the bitter tang of muggle beers.  Butterbeer was okay and various gins and whiskeys were fine but the variations muggles put on different types of beers- well, they took them seriously, you could say.<br/>
"Ron!"  He heard a calmer voice say in an amused tone and looked up to see Neville joining them at the table, beer glass in hand.  He had an expression Ron couldn't quite comprehend but there was more than one simple emotion in it.<br/>
"Ne-heh-heville."  Ron said, dumbstruck through a cough that came upon him out of sheer surprise.  "What a surprise!"<br/>
"Long time no see, mate!"  He walked around the table to give Harry and Ron a side hug, telling Harry they really needed to see each other more often than this and that Dean and Seamus shouldn't exclude him on the debauchery all the time.<br/>
He pulled Ron in for a quick and awkward side hug while saying, just quietly enough, "How many of this lot know?"<br/>
"What?"  Ron tried to play dumb, reaching for a beer.<br/>
"Chip in for that, Weasley.  We know the joke shop makes loads!"  Seamus' thick accent carrying across the pub so that more than a few muggles turned their heads.<br/>
"Merlin, Seamus.  Scream it a little louder I don't think they caught ya back in Ireland."  Ron's face grew hot and he threw down a galleon.<br/>
"What's that, Weasley?  Put that away in here, for Christ's sake."  Dean laughed.  "You don't honestly think they take those here.<br/>
"That's what I've got!"  Ron's heads flew up to his hair and he messed it up purposefully to relieve stress and to watch it improve in a carefree way in the reflection of the pub mirror.<br/>
"Always unprepared, eh?"  Dean laughed.  "Same Ron."<br/>
"I don't know."  Neville cocked his head to the side.  "Something seems different to me."<br/>
Ron glared in his direction but said in a friendly tone "Not much, Neville.  Not much."<br/>
"Nah, it's the glow of a single man."  Seamus raised his cup to a cheers.   Dean winked at Ron.<br/>
"Who's following Puddlemere United?  Anyone seen Wood make that great save last week?"  Harry threw Ron an apologetic glance and tried changing the subject.<br/>
"I heard Grangers' out with that lot tonight."  Seamus said, pouring himself a beer, larger than necessary at this rate, with is volume.  The irish, Ron thought with a scowl.<br/>
"Wait-"  He couldn't stop himself from blurting out "Ginny's group?"<br/>
"Yeah."  Seamus grinned.  "Havin' a bit of a girls night from what I heard.  It's not even just Gryffindors.  They got loads of girls 'round to celebrate Hannah's- well"  Seamus shot Neville a wink.  "You tell 'em."<br/>
"Alright.  Guys."  Neville played with his pint nervously while he announced "I've asked Hannah to marry me."<br/>
"Neville!"  Harry stood up, mouth agape.  "Neville!"  He yelled sloshing his beer from excitement rather than drunkenness.  "Congratulations Neville!"<br/>
"TO NEVILLE!"  Dean and Seamus hollered simultaneous and Ron beamed at Neville and joined in on the cheers.<br/>
"This round's on me!"  Harry called to the bartender.  "Can we get a round of shots over here!"<br/>
"Aye!"  The bartender yelled back, a young bloke who was handsome enough but still grumpy enough to not mess with.  "What liquor?"<br/>
"Tequila!"  Harry shot back,  "You guys are gonna' hate this."  He laughed.<br/>
"Blimey Harry!"  Neville exclaimed.<br/>
"At least get us something tasty.  I'm not tryin' ta die tonight if ya don't mind."  Seamus cried.<br/>
"Oh quiet."  Harry slapped Seamus' back and turned to Dean, "Calm him down, will ya.  The Irish have learned to like it all as long as it gets them drunk, I thought."  Seamus shot Harry a challenging look but they both laughed, wholeheartedly as a girl in extremely tight clothing brought out a tray of shots, limes and a salt shaker.<br/>
"Ron, you could do with a muggle girl to take your mind off things."  Dean said, eyeing the woman as she walked away.<br/>
"It's been a while since I stepped foot in a straight club but I'd do it for my mate."  Seamus laughed.<br/>
"Oy."  Neville called the attention back to his side of the table.  "I was wondering if you all wanted to be my groomsmen."  He asked, face reddening.  "I know we're all too busy to see much of each other but I just thought, well-"<br/>
"Neville!"  Dean cut him off before he talked himself into a hole.  "I would have been offended if you didn't."<br/>
"Mate, I'da brought leprechaun gold as a gift if I wasn't included."  Seamus shot, rubbing Neville's shoulder affectionately.<br/>
"Of course, mate!"  Harry said.<br/>
"We'll be there with ties on-"  Ron agreed, "If that's what you want."<br/>
"Oh I don't bloody know a thing about weddings."  Neville seemed to breathe a lot easier now that he had asked the, what he had come to ask.  "I just need you lot for support."<br/>
"Of course, Nev."  Harry smiled.<br/>
"So about those muggle women, though."  Dean raised an eyebrow at Seamus and they both turned to Ron. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>	Neville seemed to be burrowing into Ron's back with his vision as Ron walked, coerced, into the loud, dark and sweaty nightclub.  Women in deep cut dresses and hugged every hip seemed to populate every corner of this place.  Ron was sweating, trying to not act suspicious in front of Seamus, Dean and Harry while also keeping Neville at bay.  He wanted no word of this getting anywhere near Luna and was already having a hard enough time fretting over whether Luna and Hermione were having drinks together in a quiet corner comparing his sex moves.<br/>
They're probably having a riot laughing over my pale thighs, Ron though.  Men just shouldn't have thighs, he swore it.  Women- sure, they got these beautiful long silky limbs while men had to bare these pale odd things that bore patchy hair until you get to the calf where is actually looks decent.<br/>
His stomach turned and he tried to shake away the thought of them laughing at his naked body together.  He looked from girl to girl until he spotted one that looked nothing like either of them, in case Neville was counting, and walked up to her as his friends clapped his back.<br/>
"Oy."  He shouted in her ear.  Wrong move. She turned around and made a disgusted face, looking him from toe to head in a way that made him feel distinctly small and horrible looking.<br/>
"That's it."  He said, sauntering back to his friends.  "I'm done for.  I'm repulsive."<br/>
"Oh shut up."  Dean laughed.  "You just haven't said the right thing.  What I always do is talk softly, so they have to lean in real close, and compliment something about them."<br/>
"This is bloody horrible."  Ron replied.  Harry snorted and his drink came up through his nose, he winced and Ron took solace in the fact that, for one second, someone was in more pain than he was.<br/>
"Girls."  Harry choked.<br/>
"We gathered."  Seamus rolled his eyes and mouthed "Heteros" to Neville who looked confused as to why he was the receiver of this assumed insult.<br/>
"No!"  Harry coughed, trying to stabilize himself.  "THE GIRLS."  He pointed over to a patch in the corner and Ron's eyes followed.  To his horror he picked out the glimmer of a very bright red head of hair surrounded by various girls including the brown locks of one Hermione Granger and the silky blonde of a very obvious Luna Lovegood.<br/>
Fuck it all to bits.<br/>
His eyes shot to Neville's immediately and Neville understood.<br/>
"Fancy a drink?"  Neville shouted.<br/>
"Yup."  Ron said without hesitation.<br/>
"We just got you-"<br/>
"I hate it."  Neville cut Dean off before he could even finish his sentence, pushing past a few people, Ron's arm in hand.  Ron could clearly hear Dean yelling "Don't gotta' be a prat about it, Longbottom!"  But Neville paid no attention as he bee lined to the bar.<br/>
"How many of this lot know?"  Neville rounded back to the first thing he asked Ron on sight.<br/>
"You."<br/>
"That's bloody all?"  Neville said and Ron could see traces of complimented smirk in his worried eyes.<br/>
"Ginny?"  He asked.<br/>
"She's skin me alive."<br/>
"Right."  Neville turned his back to the bar to survey the war zone.  Harry had waved Ginny over and she gasped in delight, pushing her way through bounding bodies and skimpily clad women.  He saw Hermione who looked flushed and healthy and... unfortunately happy, he found himself thinking.  He locked eyes with Luna as Hermione swayed out of his direct line of vision.  She had seen him staring Hermione down and gave, what appeared to be, an empathetic smile.  He was dead.  He was simply dead.  Hannah Abbott waved to her fiance and Neville did a stupid noise back even though, Ron though, the git couldn't be heard over the noise and across the entire room.<br/>
Ron did a double take when he saw, at the back of the group in a lively chat with Alicia Spinnet and Katie Bell he saw Pansy Parkinson.<br/>
"Squid out of water in this situation."  He murmured.<br/>
"What?"  Neville yelled back over the music.<br/>
"Nothing."<br/>
"I guess we just see what happens, mate."  Neville said to him.<br/>
"That's it?"<br/>
"Yeah, I'd say so."<br/>
"Oh Neville."  Ron sighed.<br/>
"I know."<br/>
"You're awful."  Ron hung his head and patted Neville's back as they approached the group of boys and Ginny.<br/>
"Ron!  You look pale!"  Ginny pointed out.<br/>
"Yeah I'm usually quite pale, Gin."  He rolled his eyes.<br/>
"Come say hi, guys!"  She called.</p><p> </p><p>	Ron was between a rock and a hard place, as Harry had said before to Ron's amusement.  No flying allowed.<br/>
"Hey."  Hermione said quietly, coming up beside him.  "How are things?"<br/>
"As well as usual."  He replied.  "You look well."<br/>
"It's been nice, Ron."  She smiled.  "I've been able to focus on work and friends."<br/>
"Wonderful."   He replied.  "Hey." He turned towards her.  "I'm really sorry I made it so awful this past year.  I could have been better.  I got really comfortable with you always reassuring me."<br/>
"Ronald Weasley apologizing?  What's happened?"  He turned her face to smile at him and his breath caught.  He missed those deep brown eyes- he had grown up with those deep brown eyes.  He had a million memories of laughter with this person.  "It's alright, Ron.  We all got a little comfortable."<br/>
"No I really should have been more supportive."  He said quietly enough that she had to lean in.  He scanned the room to find Luna and Neville deep in conversation.<br/>
"So Pansy Parkinson?"  He asked and found himself laughing alongside Hermione.<br/>
"She's different now."  She sighed,  "We all are."<br/>
"I mean, a little different- but that much?"  He narrowed his eyes at her as if to tell her he doubted Parkinson was any less of a nightmare than she had always been.<br/>
"She and Blaise Zabini eloped in Russia last year.  She showed us pictures- it was beautiful."<br/>
"Blaise?!  I thought she and Draco-"  He watched her as the name left her mouth and she flushed.<br/>
"They never dated."  She laughed.<br/>
"Looked like dating to me."<br/>
"Nope."  She started whistling along to the too-loud song.<br/>
"So,"  Ron said, growing suspicious.  "Who invited her?"<br/>
"Oh."  She said, looking upward, outward, leftward- wherever his eyes weren't.  "Ginny thought it was a good idea."<br/>
"Ginny?  My sister Ginny?"<br/>
"Yep.  That Ginny.  Anyway Ron, is there anything new with you?"<br/>
"Depends.  How new are we talking?"<br/>
"You know what I mean."<br/>
"Why did Ginny think it was a good idea to invite Pansy?"  Ron started again.<br/>
"Okay, I work with her and some other Hogwarts Alumni.  I wanted to create a more cohesive work environment at the ministry."  SHe took a long breath.<br/>
"Who else?"<br/>
"Who else what, Ron?"<br/>
"Who else works there?"  He spat.  He was breathing hard now and clenching his fists.  His heart was pounding.<br/>
"Just a couple Slytherins."<br/>
"You wouldn't be avoiding it if it meant nothing, 'Mione."  He said too loudly and Ginny looked away from Harry.<br/>
"What's up, guys?"  She scooted closer.<br/>
"Ron was just wondering why we invited Pansy."  Hermione turned her head towards Ginny as Ginny's eyes widened.<br/>
"Oh Ron."  She sighed.  "Ron, I just wanted Hermione to feel free to invite her work friends.  We're all bigger than house colors now."<br/>
"You guys are all bullshit if you think I can't tell what's really happening."  He stopped leaning against the railing that was supporting he, Ginny, Harry and Hermione.<br/>
"Ron, it's not that bad."  Hermione started to rise as well.  Luna and Neville peered over the patch of their friends to see what the ruckus was.<br/>
"It's not, eh?"  He asked, coldly.  "What's not that bad, Hermione.  If it's not so bad why can't you say it?"<br/>
"You're assuming-"<br/>
"What am I assuming?  You can't say Malfoy's name without getting red in the fucking face so what am I so stupid for assuming?"  He hadn't realized he had started yelling until Harry pulled his arm, lightly.<br/>
"No, screw you.  All of you."  Ron hissed at Harry.  "Don't tell me who not to see while you know Hermione's seeing Malfoy."  Harry let go of Ron's arm and turned on Hermione and Ginny.<br/>
"What?"  He asked, seemingly dumbfounded.<br/>
"Ron!"  Ginny looked heated.  "There's no need to cause a scene!"<br/>
"Oh piss off, Ginevra.  You filthy hypocrite."  He turned, meeting Luna's eye.  "Oy."   She stared back, a little shocked.  "I'm leaving.  You know where to find me if you decide to ditch this filthy lot."  He turned to glare at his friends.  "It's been wonderful, Seamus and Dean.  Neville," He turned to face Neville in all of his nervousness at what had transpired.  "The whole lot can know, I honestly don't care."<br/>
And on that, he turned and left.  </p><p> </p><p>	He didn't get a text from Luna until 3am and it was sloppy and short.  She said Neville was taking her home and that he could come over if he wanted but he was rather content to seeth by himself in his dull flat and eat leftover curry.  His phone pinged over and over again from each of his friends apologizing and reassuring him they had no idea.  Harry called insistently until the same time that Luna texted and then, Ron assumed, he went to sleep.<br/>
Ron walked into his bedroom and looked, disgustedly, at the lumpy knitted blanket that always sat, folded, at the end of his bed.  It was maroon and gold.  It was a housewarming gift from Hermione.<br/>
He watched it drift as he chucked it out his window until it landed atop a blue muggle car.  "Good fucking riddance."  He spat and burrowed himself deep in his bed.  </p><p> </p><p>	Ron spent the following three days holed up in his flat watching muggle TV and eating his rage away.  George had left several violent voice messages and sent three hawks to deliver howlers but he couldn't have cared less.  On more than one occasion  Harry had rang his doorbell and Ron let it ring until he saw Harry's black hair crossing the street, only ducking when Harry turned to look at Ron's window.<br/>
It wasn't until tuesday that Ron realized that if he kept on like this he'd no longer be awkward and gangly but more built like Hagrid, minus the bone structure.  He braced himself for the outdoors only to be pleasantly greeted with sunshine and bird song.  </p><p>	He knocked on the blue door three times and thought to himself that if he counted to thirty and there was no answer it meant that he would never be forgiven for causing such a scene.<br/>
"Ron."  Ron was shocked to see a mop of dirty blonde hair and Neville's no longer round face peering back at him.<br/>
"Oh. I. Uh.  Yeah. Er."  He just kept stopping and starting and he could have very well slapped himself.<br/>
"Come in."  Neville said, swinging the doorway open. "I was just leaving."<br/>
"Oh feel free to stay, Neville."  Ron said, awkwardly, realizing he had just invited someone to stay in a house that wasn't his.<br/>
"It's alright, mate."  Neville laughed, kindly, and grabbed his scarf.  "I'm sure she'll be just a moment."  And stepped out onto the stairs leading up to Luna's flat, waved goodbye, and pulled the door shut.  </p><p>	Ron fiddled with Luna's trinkets for three minutes.  He found himself, for the third time in his life, contemplating whether or not he should flee Luna's apartment or not.  He heard a rustle and stood up, straightening his jacket.  Luna entered the room, a towel atop her head and her bright blue eyes ogling him without a hint of surprise.<br/>
"Ronald."  She smiled warmly.<br/>
"Oy."  He replied quietly.  "Sorry I was a git in front of everyone."  She laughed to his dismay and replied<br/>
"That's probably an apology best saved for Hermione."<br/>
"Please don't-"  he started but she gave him a firm look that told him not to carry on.<br/>
""Ron, this is okay.  What we're doing.  As long as I'm not hurting you and you aren't hurting me."  She smiled faintly.  "It's not like I wasn't aware that there was an expiration date."  She said plainly and his heart sank.<br/>
"That's not what I had in mind."<br/>
"Ron, our star charts tell us we'd make a wonderful pair but I've always known that you need a more grounded life partner."<br/>
"Luna,"  He started pleadingly.  "Luna, I've spent my entire life being compared to other people and my entire relationship comparing myself to someone else.  Please, Luna.  For once in my life let me be happy just as it is."<br/>
Luna's big blue eyes settled on Ron's and she walked over to him with more decisiveness and priority than he had ever seen her harbor.<br/>
"I was not comparing you to anyone."  She said, grabbing his face in her hands and he felt his eyes grow hot.  He didn't want her to be telling him this was another relationship he was going to fail before giving it a shot.  He didn't want her to be telling him this was not a relationship from the beginning.<br/>
"I like you, Luna."  He said and she silenced him with a warm and comforting kiss.<br/>
"I like you too."  She pulled away to stare into his eyes.<br/>
"I hate that Trelawney star shit."  He said and she burst out laughing.<br/>
"I've come to quite rely on star charts to map my relationships."<br/>
"God, Looney.  Just make a choice the normal way for once."  He put her small pixie-esque face between his large hands and watched her eyes lessen with laughter.<br/>
"I've never nor will I ever do so in my life."  She stated, stubbornly.<br/>
"Oh piss off."  He grabbed her butt and lifted her onto him.  She spun her legs around him, peeling her shirt off to reveal a red lace bra.  "Nevermind."  He smirked.  "Don't piss off, for Merlin's sake,  Do not piss off anywhere.  Stay right here."  He grunted as he removed his shirt, still balancing his strength between holding her although he legs squeezed tightly around him.<br/>
"It's my flat, Weasley."  She hopped down, pulling the towel off of her mostly dry wavy hair.  She slid out of the long flowy skirt that adorned his hips to reveal red lacy underwear to match.<br/>
"Oh Merlin."  He smirked and sat himself on the grey couch surrounded by greenery and pulled her down onto him.</p>
