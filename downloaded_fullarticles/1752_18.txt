    <p>The first time Remus visited Azkaban, he was surprised by the change. After Kingsley Shacklebolt was made Minister of Magic, he got rid of the dementors and sent aurors to guard the prisoners instead. The lack of bone chilling dementors was welcome after all of Sirius' stories. </p><p>Sirius and Tonks both had warned him not to go; told him it was a stupid idea. Why would Remus want to go to Azkaban? What was the point? But Remus was determined and went anyway. </p><p>One of the auror guards led him to the cell. The short blond woman gave him a funny look, arching a brow in silent question. Remus didn't respond to the look, his face drawn into a stern look. </p><p>"Oooh, what’s this?" The deep voice rang through the air suddenly and Remus froze. </p><p>The auror guard looked at Remus and spoke gently. "Would you like me to stay in case he does something?"</p><p>"No," Remus said back, "No, you're fine. They let me keep my wand." He didn't go into detail, not with this nameless auror. </p><p>She looked him up and down; if she had any objections, she didn't speak them. She nodded and turned on her heel, leaving Remus alone in front of the Azkaban cell. </p><p>When he looked at the cell he jumped; he certainly wasn’t expecting the man inside to be standing so close to the bars. The crazed amber eye and the dead blind eye stared at him, almost transfixed. </p><p>“Fenrir.” Remus murmured in a sort of greeting. </p><p>“Oh, they told me that I would be getting a visitor, but who knew I would also be getting such a sweet treat. How have you been, Little One?”</p><p>“I’m hardly little anymore.” The younger or the two replied. He was 38 when the war ended. He was nearing 40 now. He wondered for a moment how old Fenrir must be; close to his 70s right? Or maybe even his 80s? But he hardly looked a day over 50. </p><p>The werewolf Alpha’s hair was still inky black except for a few grey strands here or there. Meanwhile Remus’ hair had lost the majority of its dirty blond and was mostly grey. Fenrir’s skin had hardly any wrinkles, though it did boast its fair share of scarring. Especially on the right side of his face along with the blind eye. He looked skinny but Remus chalked that up to being a high security prisoner that no one really wanted to deal with. </p><p>“Little to me.” Fenrir purred, the rumble in his chest a chilling memory to Remus. </p><p>“I suppose.” The younger man stiffened. His jaw clenched and he crossed his arms over his chest, a defensive move that he honed during his school days. </p><p>“Why have you come to visit it me, Little One?” Fenrir’s head cocked to the side. It was such an animalistic movement; the action was only heightened by that amber eye scanning Remus up and down as though he were tracking prey. </p><p>“To talk. Isn’t that why you always visited me?”</p><p>“Yes. Yes, to talk, Pup. Talk about what exactly?” Hands were suddenly gripping the bars of the cell and Fenrir was even closer. </p><p>Remus took a cautious step away. He swallowed hard, not able to speak up. </p><p>“Talk about <i>what</i>?”</p><p>Remus could feel himself start to shake, his hands trembling where they were tucked against his body. “To ask you some things.”</p><p>“You know, Pup, that really doesn’t clear anything up.” Fenrir purred, hands gripping the bars tighter. He leaned heavily against the metal bars of the cell, eyes never leaving the younger man. </p><p>“I want to know why you did it.”</p><p>Fenrir leaned away from the bars of the cell, a harsh laugh bursting from him. “Oh, really now, Little One. Do you know just how many things that could apply to? Surely you don’t have an unlimited amount of time to visit me...” He smirked at Remus. “You best narrow it down.”</p><p>Remus's jaw tightened in irritation. His hissed through clenched teeth. "Why did you bite me?"</p><p>The caged werewolf was silent for a moment. He stared at Remus and it was as though his one working eye was boring into the other man. Almost suddenly, when the words sunk in, he tossed his head back with another sharp, bark-like, laugh. </p><p>He met Remus' eyes, a chilling smirk curving his lips. "Why did I bite you?"</p><p>"Yes." </p><p>"You're going to tell me… that your father never explained?" </p><p>The younger werewolf furrowed his brows in confusion. He frowned. "What's my father have to do-?"</p><p>Fenrir purred, clearly pleased, cutting Remus off abruptly. "Hey, Pup, do tell me; where do you stay on the Fulls?"</p><p>"What?" Confusion laced the younger man's voice thickly. </p><p>"The Fulls. Where do you spend them now?" He leaned forward, pressing himself against the bars of the cell. The amber eye was alight and a manic smile curved the werewolf's lips, parting them to show glistening fangs. </p><p>"I… at the Ministry." Remus replied, still confused.</p><p>"Locked away," Fenrir purred, reaching a hand through the bars. His claw-like nails were able to just graze the skin of Remus' cheek before the younger man took a hasty step backwards. "Just. Like. Me." </p><p>"For one night. Only on the Fulls." Remus replied, his tone tight and body tense. </p><p>“Just like <i>me</i>.” Fenrir repeated. He pulled his hand back into the cell. “Locked away like a bad dog in the pound, Little One. It’s been so lonely. No one’s come to adopt me, you see.”</p><p>“Adop-?”</p><p>“When did you move out of that little shack of yours?” Fenrir asked abruptly. </p><p>Remus was so confused. He was supposed to be the one asking questions and getting answers. He was supposed to be finding out the answers to the question that had haunted him all his life. <i> Why? Why me? Why did this happen to me?</i> But Fenrir kept getting distracted; or he kept purposefully running the train onto another track. </p><p>“My shack? You mean at Hogwarts?” He knew he shouldn’t be answering the questions. He was playing into whatever plan the older man was scheming. </p><p>“Yes, yes. Your little house up at the castle.”</p><p>“I haven’t been in the shack to transform since I was in school, Fenrir.” Besides that night in Harry’s third year, but Remus quickly shook his head of that thought. </p><p>“And now they lock you away. Do they treat you well, your beloved wizards?” Fenrir’s head cocked to the side in an animalistic curiosity. “Do they pamper you in your cold barren cell? Do they watch as you turn into a bloodthirsty monster that’s Hell-bent on ripping them apart?”</p><p>Remus swallowed hard, not knowing what to say. His mind went blank and all he could do was stand there as Fenrir kept talking. </p><p>“Do they patch you up when you leave in the morning, Little One? What do they think of you as they mop up your spilt blood? Do you get it better in those cells than any other wolves because you’re a <i>war hero</i>?” The elder werewolf hissed, his sharp, claw-like nails scratched at the titanium bars of the cell. </p><p>Remus backed away from the cell. The sharp screeching noise of claw against metal sent sharp pains jolting down his spine. He knew that the aurors made this cell just for Fenrir. If it were made like any normal one, the werewolf would be able to bend the bars and escape. </p><p>Fenrir laughed harshly, gripping the bars so tightly that the impossibly strong metal seemed to indent slightly. "Where are you going, Little One? Where are you running off to now? Have to go back and see your little wizard masters? Lapdog that you are, hm? Maybe take a visit to see that father of yours. Ask <i>him</i> why you were bitten. Have some quality <i>family time</i>, yes?"</p><p>The younger man opened his mouth as if to say something but he choked on the words. He turned quickly on his heel and walked toward the door at the end of the long hallway. </p><p>Ringing after him, Fenrir's harsh laugh echoed against stone walls.</p>
