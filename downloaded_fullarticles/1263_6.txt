    <p>Harry was nervous. This may have been the first time he was nervous since walking into the forbidden forest before he defeated Voldemort. Yet here he was, stood outside the room of requirement in his 8th year, and he was actually shaking. He tried to calm himself down, it wasn’t like this was a big deal, he was just going to join a club for LGBT+ students. Its not like being gay is a big deal in the wizarding world, well… no more of an issue than being a pureblood, so really it only bothered the Slytherins. He could do this.</p><p>He walked in to see the room almost like an office reception, it was strange. Sitting at the desk was a 6th year Hufflepuff he didn’t know. She had marble white skin, gentle brown curls and when she smiled up at him she had a dimple on her left cheek. There was a novel to her left and what looked like a register in front of her.</p><p>‘’Hi, new member?’’. She was very friendly and instantly made Harry feel at ease. ‘’Yes, hi, I’m Harry’’. She chuckled, it was obvious she knew who he was but she didn’t say anything, she could tell he was nervous and this was a safe space after all. ‘’Hi Harry, I’m Xiaoling, I’m the admin for the group, I look after our members and if you need any help feel free to come to me. If you can’t find me our group organiser will be more than happy to help. Do you have any questions before you head through?’’. Harry smiled, ‘’No thanks, I’ll make sure to come back if i do’’. With that she waved him off and he headed inside, only to stop dead in his tracks.</p><p>He couldn’t believe his eyes, right in front of him, welcoming a group of Ravenclaws, was Pansy Parkinson. Before she noticed him Harry ran and hid behind a pillar. He couldn’t believe it, here he was, joining a group to try and work out his own sexuality, only to see his ex-rivals girlfriend. Did that mean Draco was here? What if she told people about him? He was ready to join a group to help himself, but he wasn’t ready for everyone to know he may not be straight. Not yet anyway, he hadn’t even told Ron or Hermione. Harry was just about to sneak out and forget he ever tried to join when Pansy tapped him on the shoulder.</p><p>‘’You okay Potter?’’. She didn’t sound like she was being malicious but Harry was still weary. ‘’I’m fine, just wandered into the wrong room, that's all. I’ll just… leave…’’. Pansy looked at Potter in such a strange way; and he hated it. It was as if she was looking at a stray kitten who needed help. He had never seen Pansy like this and honestly, it frightened him.<br/>
‘’Potter you don’t need to leave’’ She sighed, ‘’Look Im the group organiser, Im a lesbian… don’t look so surprised’’. She smiled at Harry in a welcoming way, he still wasn’t sure if he wanted to leave, but he thought he should at least hear her out; he waited for her to continue. ‘’Look I know the stigma that can come with being in this community, but after the war, after my parents being locked up…  after everything really, I knew I needed a safe space with people that understand. I thought I could start this group to help those in my position, connect with one another and help myself in the process.’’ She sighed again. ‘’You don’t need to be worried about me and you don’t need to leave, I really mean it when I say this is a safe space. Why don’t we go grab some tea and you can tell me why you came, I promise I won’t judge’’. Harry looked at Pansy like she had just turned into a goblin.</p><p>This couldn’t be the same Pansy Parkinson, someone must be playing a trick on him. He knew she was on his side during the war, and he was there during her parents trial when she testified against them… but still. This was Paarkinson, the same girl who had made Hermione feel lower than low, who had berated him and Ron in front of the Slytherins, the same Parkinson who laughed at ever taunt Malfoy made to him. There was no way she was actually being this nice. Forgetting all that, there is no way SHE was a lesbian. She lusted over Malfoy constantly, she was never away from him. He was sure they were a couple. Harry honestly just felt confused, he needed to get away. Without answering her, he got up and left. Pansy looked at him frustrated and with understanding, she knew it would be hard to come to terms with, especially with their past, she would just need to wait and see if he came back.</p><p>Before he walked out of the room of requirement Harry turned to Xiaoling, ‘’Is Parkinson really in charge here?’’, Harry was confused why she looked so nervous, until her realised he practically growled his question. He felt a little bad but still wasn't sure if someone was playing a trick on him, so he didn’t apologise. ‘’Erm, yes? She was the one who sent out the messages and arranged all this’’. Harry didn’t know how to respond so he just left.</p>
