    <p>It's just another morning, albeit one where Molly has already cooked breakfast before he woke up, but. Just another morning after a late night, all Arthur’s favorites in steaming plates and bowls across the table, his children already having dug in. Ginny’s his favorite child now, though. The boys would have let him sleep, and awoken to cold food, if any was left at all. Woe is the days Percy was the favorite. Boy couldn't let him sleep in on any day.</p><p>“Dad, can you pass the biscuits, Harry wants another.”</p><p>And, Arthur nods, intent on the paper, he doesn't even think about. Doesn't wonder who Harry is. He passes the biscuits. “Eat up, Harry,” he says, distracted. “Plenty to go around.”<br/>
<br/>
The basket leaves his hand, and then a moment later there's a barely audible, “<em>Thank you</em>,” somewhere past Fred and George heckling Percy, a giggling Ginny. Arthur's not really paying attention, you see, so he gives it a vague acknowledgement, feels slightly accomplished at least one of the kids remember their manners.<br/>
<br/>
He eats his toast and beans, the fluffy eggs and rashers. Drinks the tea, and cleans his plate, puts the paper down when he's asked, “Dad, can we go flying later?” and realizes. Realizes—</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>One. Three, four, five… five… six?</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><br/>
“Oh,” he says, blinks. The boy, at the end of the table opposite Ron, hunches his shoulders. Bother, he fits right in, Arthur hadn't even noticed past the red hair. “Wotcher, um, did you say Harry?”<br/>
<br/>
Rons nods, swallows what he was chewing, good lad. “Yeah, this is Harry, we rescued him.”<br/>
<br/>
“We,” Arthur echoes, of no doubt he'll get the full story later, and Fred and George give him two muggle salutes. He ignores the weird phrasing, <em>rescue</em>. What would the Boy-Who-Lived need rescuing from? “Does your mother know about this?” <em>That you brought Harry Potter home?</em><br/>
<br/>
The three of them share a look, and Harry shrinks back in his chair, face darkening in discomfort. It's somewhat endearing, Arthur's sees it on every one of his children's faces on a daily basis, Harry’s got a lot more freckles than anyone ever has in either his or Molly’s family, though, and a few good shades browner all around. He waits for an answer, waits. For the Love of M—<br/>
<br/>
Percy sighs, aggrieved. “She does,” he volunteers, tugging at the collar of his night shirt. “Took a run to Madame Josephine's up the way.” He shoots Harry an unreadable look. “For… clothes, and to send a letter since Charlie has yet to send Errol back.”<br/>
<br/>
Fred, or George mumbles something he thinks is, “<em>A strongly worded letter</em>.” Bill, Charlie, and the twins ought to know all about that, shouldn't they. Gotten enough Howlers in their school careers to fill a trunk, but.<br/>
<br/>
<em>Clothes?</em> “Oh well, guess that's all right then,” he says, forcing the worry down. Molly seems to have it all in hand, and the boy looks uncomfortable enough as it is. “Said you wanted to go flying? Well, help clean up, and we'll see. Nice to be having you, Harry.”<br/>
<br/>
Clean up has never gone any smoother or without fuss. Fred and George usually manage to sneak off, but this morning they're right there with Percy spelling everything clean. Ginny and Ron put the leftover food, a rarity, in the kitchen for him to preserve, and Arthur sees Harry try exactly once to help at a point, an awkward figure watching them clean. Ron doesn't let him though, and Arthur can figure the other boy tries to insist, and Ron just. Just gives the shorter boy a small push away, and Harry <em>crumples</em>.</p><p> </p><p><br/>
<br/>
“<em>Harry!</em>” goes up in a chorus, and Ron drops a plate, the rashers gone rolling.</p><p> </p><p><br/>
“<em>I'm… I'm sorry, I'm… I'm sorry</em>,” is what Arthurs hears when he manages to get close enough through Fred and George. Harry’s crying, the tears thick and gummy, the whole works. “<em>I'm sorry, don't… don't be mad, p-please.</em>”<br/>
<br/>
“What did you rescue him from, exactly?” Arthur demands, and winces when the boy flinches with muffled sob.<br/>
<br/>
“They had <em>bars</em> on his window,” Ron warbles, face gone red and splotchy, hands wringing in his shirt. “They weren't feeding him, and, and<em> I don't know!</em>”<br/>
<br/>
Arthur’s no Healer, but it takes all that one can to raise seven children, and the healing ward visits can be frequent in a house full of rough and tumblers who love a good and rowdy game of Quidditch. Pulling his wand from his pocket, Arthur flicks it in a slash around Harry.<br/>
<br/>
<em>Broken rib</em>. Dear Merlin, <em>how?</em> Ron’d barely even <em>touched</em> him.<br/>
<br/>
“I need you all to back up, we're going to St. Mungos, Percy, floo ahead and hold the connection,” Arthurs says, and braces an arm against Ron’s chest as he makes to step forward, to pull at Harry. “Don't touch him, okay?”<br/>
<br/>
His youngest nods, wide eyes tear rimmed, and backs into the twins and sniffling Ginny.<br/>
<br/>
With a grim determination, Arthur pushes the boy’s legs closer together, and gently arranges his arms. “I'm just going to freeze your body, okay, Harry? Try not to panic when you can't move, and then I'm going to levitate you,” he explains to the crying boy, red hair sticking to his sweat streaked forehead, and his scar a livid burst of white across his flushed face. Harry coughs, but manages a weak nod as he raises his wand. “Okay, here we go, <em>Petrificus Totalus.</em>”<br/>
<br/>
The characteristic binding of the limbs minimized, Harry only breathes out a shallow huff in pain as his limbs bind together. The boy's body paralyzed, Arthur flicks his wand. “<em>Wingardium leviosa</em>.”<br/>
<br/>
Slowly, he levitates Harry, his falling tears beginning to spin in the altered space. “Fred, George, take Ron and Ginny upstairs please.”<br/>
<br/>
“But—”<br/>
<br/>
“No,” he interrupts, and casts them a brief but stern look, “take them upstairs, and only come back down when your Mother gets Home.”<br/>
<br/>
Fred and George have to tug on Ron and Ginny, but they go, shoot worried looks over their shoulders, but by Merlin’s magic they troop upstairs without more fuss. Arthur sighs, and at sniffle, starts forward and out of the kitchen.<br/>
<br/>
“Healer Bak’s come through,” comes Percy’s voice as Arthur navigates Harry past the dining table and chairs.<br/>
<br/>
Their family Healer is in her usual white robes, and wand at rest in her hand as they come into the living room. Bak’s face drains of what little color she has seeing him float the boy in. She beings casting before he can open his mouth, striding forward, lights of all colors flitting from the tip of her wand.<br/>
<br/>
“I've bound him, and he has a broken rib, my youngest barely touched him and he just collapsed when it broke,” he says, and lets her take over the levitation.<br/>
<br/>
“What's the boy’s name?” she asks as she steps back up to the floo, clearly distracted by the bright red hair, but not by the brown skin. Knows he's not theirs, exactly, she would have been one of the first to know if he was, but. “Have you notified his guardians?”<br/>
<br/>
Arthur pauses, hopes he can impress upon her the dire need for discretion. “Harry... Potter,” he answers, and at her sharp look, continues, “I think it best we notify the guardians once he's in a better condition.” <em>Bars on the window. They're not feeding him.</em> Merlin’s beard.<br/>
<br/>
Bak purses her lips. “Agreed,” she says, and then steps into the fire with a, “<em>St. Mungos, second floor receiving room!</em>”<br/>
<br/>
Once she's gone through with Harry, he turns to Percy. The boy's freckles stand out on his pale face. “It'll be fine, Perce,” Arthur assures him, and gives him a brief hug. “You're in charge til your Mother gets home. Tell her what happened and where we are, okay?”<br/>
<br/>
Percy swallows hard. “Okay, Dad.”<br/>
<br/>
With a steadying breath, Arthur nods. “Good lad, I'll be back when I can,” he says, and then turns to the floo, vanishes into the flames.</p>
