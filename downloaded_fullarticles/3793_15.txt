    <p align="left"><strong>God dammit that Potter</strong>! I swear, god sent him to me to test my patience!</p><p align="left"> He and his stupid womanizer of a friend, Black, crossed the line<strong>! If I so much as see a</strong> <strong>small, inexcusably messy, stray of hair from James Potter's head,</strong> I will demolish it! Along with the egoistic body attached to it! I haven't been so angry at him in a long time. Those ridicules idiots sneaked into the Slytherin boys dormitory's and stupefied, <strong>stupefied!!!</strong>, all the first years!</p><p align="left"> Eleven year olds! All frozen in bed, until the afternoon, when Professor Slughorn got worried and went to check on them. If I can help it I <strong>will</strong> make sure that his Head Boy pin (how did he even get it in the first place?- probably stole it!) gets taken away from him!! And, I <u>can't</u> believe I heard from Clarissa that the both of them are in our common room, <strong>bragging</strong>!</p><p align="left"> Finally! I can see the Fat Lady's portrait, you wait Potter! Your parents won't recognize you when I'm done with you! "Shuntulip!" I yelled the password.</p><p align="left"> </p>
<hr/><p align="left"> </p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">"Oh god, <b>oh god</b>, <b>oh god</b>, this is bad!" James Potter was pacing in the Gryffindor common room.</p><p align="left">"Relax Prongs." Sirius Black said, "It's not the first time we've pranked since you became Head Boy! I'm sure Lily Flower won't be too mad".</p><p align="left">He was sitting in a comfortable armchair in front of the fire, completely calm, watching his friend frat about.</p><p align="left">"This is your entire Frigging fault! I shouldn't have listened to you and stupefied those first years! Ho man, Lily's gonna kill me! And besides, how are you so calm!?"</p><p align="left"> "Easy," he said, stretching his legs in front of the fire. "She always goes for you."</p><p align="left">"What!?" James demanded.</p><p align="left">"Yeah, she'll probably see you and start Hexing and cursing you, and forget all about little old me."  He said with a smirk.</p><p align="left">"Don't tell me you didn't notice James" said Remus, sitting with a book in an armchair next to Sirius, "She always goes for you when we do something." </p><p align="left">James looked at his "best" friends, bewildered.</p><p align="left">"But, but." He seemed lost for words. Sirius laugh.</p><p align="left">And even Remus chuckled, "well, to be fair, that only started when you became Head Boy" his friend offered. </p><p align="left">James exclaimed "What does she think I am? A sudden saint-need-be since I have a friggin' pin!" He said, exasperating.</p><p align="left">Sirius shrugged his shoulders and smirked "All I know is that I'm Lily safe, thanx mate."</p><p align="left">"Welcome" James said sarcastically, glaring at his best friend.</p><p align="left">"Hey guys! A girl from their year said. "That was you're doing in the Slytherin common room right?" she looked at Sirius and winked. Sirius got up and bowed to the group of girls and winked back, predictably enough, they all giggled.</p><p align="left">As the girl that asked left the common room James suddenly jumped to his feet "You idiot Padfoot! What do you think you're doing! That's Clarissa, Lily's friend!" He yelled. </p><p align="left">"Oh" Sirius said with realization. </p><p align="left">"Yes 'Oh'!" He said, "Now what! I bet it's a matter of seconds before Lily hears that we're bragging in the common room to anyone that would listen about that stupid prank!" </p><p align="left">"Why did you do it then James, if you didn't want to face Lily?" asked Remus, always the observant. </p><p align="left">"I don't know" He said, running his hand through his messy hair. "It was supposed to be harmless! Well, at least to the first years. We <strong>were</strong> aiming for the seventh years but we got the bedrooms wrong, and it was too late to go into the seventh years rooms, so we decided to just go ahead with the prank anyways!"</p><p align="left">Remus was shaking his head. "Really? You decided it's better to stupefy first years?" He looked his friend in the eyes, and James saw a bit of disappointment in his friend at him.</p><p align="left">That hit a chord with James- Moony usually didn't approve of pranks, but he was rarely disappointed. He felt ashamed. </p><p align="left">Then Sirius said, noticing the tension and seeing his best friend feeling bad "Don't worry mate! We'll help you. You should hide from Evans for a few days, until she calms down a bit." He shrugged and added, "Should be easy if you carry around the map."</p><p align="left">James thought about his friend's suggestion, but before he could decide the Fat Lady's portrait opened and all three pairs of eyes looked at it, slightly scared. And Sirius said- "How fast do you think news travel in Hogwarts?"</p><p align="left">Nobody wanted to face an angry red-head.</p><p align="left">James winced, thinking of what's going to happen to him.</p><p align="left">
