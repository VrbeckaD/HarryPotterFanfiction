    <p>It was a totally normal morning the day that the letter came. Harriet had just finished setting the table for the Dursley's and was waiting nearby, just in case one of them wanted something, hoping if she got it fast enough they might throw her a scrap of food for her trouble.</p><p>You see Harriet was very different from the Dursleys not only did she look different, where uncle Vernon, Dudley, were fat and Aunt Petunia was horse faced and blonde. Harriet had inky black hair and a pixie shaped face. She would be a rather pretty child, if she wasn't so skinny and underfed. You see Harriet was a freak and freaks only ate scraps left behind by normal people.</p><p>Harriet snapped her head up when there was a sound at the door signaling that the post had come. Uncle Vernon sent her a look and she scrambled to go get it, it was always best not to keep Uncle Vernon waiting.</p><p>Harriet hurried to open the door and grab the stack of letters only to pause, the top letter was made of expensive and old looking paper, but even stranger it was addressed to her. Harriet glanced around then then separated the letter from the stack and hurried back to the kitchen shoving the letter under her cupboard door on her way. It was best that neither Uncle Vernon or Dudley found out someone was writing her, she couldn't imagine they would respond well.</p><p>Harriet went back to her spot after handing Uncle Vernon the stack of letters waiting on them to finish so she could do the dishes and then start the rest of her chores but for the first time in her young life she was looking forward to being put back in the cupboard she was quiet curious what the letter was about. No one had ever written her a letter before and she was excited to see what whoever was writing her had to say.</p><p>That night Harriet waited till she was sure the Dursleys were asleep then took the letter from where she had shoved it, turning on an old flashlight she had dug out of the trash she began to read, making sure to keep an ear out for the Dursleys. She did not want to find out what they would do to her if they found out she had stolen something never mind the they had thrown it in the trash, freaks weren't meant to have any thing but what normal people were kind enough to give them. Harriet snorted then looked back down at the letter it read</p><p align="center"><br/> "HOGWARTS SCHOOL of WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY<br/> Headmaster: Albus Dumbledore<br/> (Order of Merlin, First Class, Grand Sorc., Chf. Warlock,<br/> Supreme Mugwump, International Confed. of Wizards)<br/> Dear Ms. Harriet Potter,<br/> We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment.<br/> Term begins on September 1st. We await your owl by no later than July 31st.<br/> Yours sincerely,<br/> Minerva McGonagall<br/> Deputy Headmistress"</p><p><br/> Also included was a list of things to bring, like a caldron and spell books. She would think it was a prank, but who would be pranking her Dudley didn't have the brains and if he wanted to torment her he would just chase her till he caught her then beat her up. Though she was getting faster and he was getting fatter, so he might have some trouble catching her. Besides Dudley wouldn't use the forbidden M word even in a prank, so it must be real.</p><p>But what was this about an owl should she just walk up to a random owl and ask it to send a letter for her, or maybe they would send a owl to her and it would set on the front step till she gave it a letter Harriet hoped not. She didn't think Uncle Vernon would be very happy to find an owl on his front step.</p><p>Maybe she should just write out a reply and carry it with her till she sees a owl that looks suspicious, yes she would do that, Harriet thought nodding. As long as she kept it hidden she wouldn't get in any trouble. So she tore a page out of one of her old school note books put pen to paper and tried to think of what to write, in the end she settled on</p><p align="center"><br/> "Dear Ms Deputy Headmistress<br/> I received your letter and would like some more information about your school. How do I get there? Where do I get the school supplies you mentioned in you letter? Is magic real?<br/> Eagerly awaiting your reply Harriet Potter."</p><p><br/> Yes that sounded good with lots of big words to make her sound smart. Harriet smiled then folded the letter up and put it in an overly large pocket before laying down and going to sleep, dreaming about a magic school where there were no more Dursleys and where she could be more than just a freak.</p>
