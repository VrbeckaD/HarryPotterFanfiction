    <p>Another year older. Your effect over him is the best-brewed Amortentia in the Wizarding world and with each year, no less potent.</p><p>Severus is obsessed, enamoured, beyond all reason. Strange, as reasoning is why he lives to celebrate this day. He is not a man who lavishes gifts upon another. But for the one deserving? Absolutely.</p><p>“Many happy returns,” he whispers, chocolate richly.</p><p>He wants to be the first in uttering wishes, despite the uninterestingness of these affairs. You are all he needs.</p><p>Observing him through sleep-hazed eyes, his low velvet tone brings wakefulness. The harsh expression lines present elsewhere are softer, deep brown eyes holding emotions that a rare few have ever witnessed.</p><p>“Thank you,” you murmur back, vocal tone affection-filled.</p><p>Alongside the one, like Severus, you will give your all. Two scarred hearts never fully heal, but together, beat in a strong synchronisation.</p><p>An all too familiar smirk crosses his face and before parting your lips to speak further, he straddles you. Warm callused hands intertwine with soft smoothness, undressed, meeting clothed Potions Master.</p><p>Hummingbird hearts flutter with murmured words. “You have earned my undivided attention.” </p><p>His tongue bringing many to their knees paired with thin lips, often forming words of damnation, now devote themselves to igniting sparking flames as covers are stripped away. With each touch, as always, Severus takes the reins from your slackened grip, allowing the loss of control.</p><p>As hands dedicated to the artistry of brewing pay homage, you unravel, mind blissfully blank. Confident fingertips trail across your abdomen, traversing southward and snatching vocabulary in their wake. Amid this, lips and tongue act, resting where Severus knows it yearns for immediate attention. Every bedroom choice is as confident as classroom ones, ensuring you know all that is his.</p><p>While his face is obscured, the smirk in your mind’s eye is prominent. Silken hair tickles skin and a tongue swipes across your clit, gathering sweetness solely his. Each tongue stroke designed to wear down your stubbornness and beg desperately does just that, resolve crumbling as your hands become fists.</p><p>“Severus, please,” You find your voice, weak yet laced with desire as it is.</p><p>“Please, what?” he asks knowingly, sure of what you both desire but teases, anyway. </p><p>Coaxing your legs up, he peppers you with spanks, consistently finding its mark and rapidly reddening as his tongue continues lavishing licks.</p><p>Your stubborn streak flares once more, eyes narrowing, clamping your lips shut.</p><p>To no avail, as Severus flicks across your clit, intensely. Red handprints decorate flushed skin, awakening a wanting ache as hands smooth over long legs ensnaring his obsession. Long legs Severus grasps, not an action wasted as he hooks them over his shoulders.</p><p>“Another year older, and no less desirable,” he murmurs, this velvety undertone bowing to lust. </p><p>You are the only one which may ask for <em> everything.  </em></p><p>And he fulfils this, pulsating heat filling you in heart, body, and mind, connecting like the first time. A strangled moan is caged in your throat, pleading for release as those hands retrace this many times taken path. Severus neglects nothing; the moan finally escaping as delicate breasts are glided over, squeezing softly. In contrast after harshly pinched nipples, your body trembling beneath a tumultuous storm.</p><p>Severus is unhurried, precisely hitting the same sweet spot, and perfecting it, as though a complex, satisfying brew.</p><p>At that moment you are both unguarded, the well-worn armour equipped cast aside as transcendent, mutual euphoria occurs. It is amplified when he goes deeper, thrusting harder and faster.</p><p>You call out his name prayer-like, cries caught in crescendos as your lover growls; flying over the edge. With no silencing charms, the whole of Hogwarts may know, but it is inconsequential compared to the relationship sharers.</p><p>Severus is marked by passionate nails, a pleasant burning sting uniquely you. His reminders are fading pink handprints and the imprint of him in your soul, taken without visual proof. Whether or not there is a mark, his impression upon you isn’t altered at all. Still, the man you know and walk with, as equals.</p><p>“Severus!”</p><p>You are louder, shaky as your climax hurtles forth. Pain and pleasure are a beautiful, heady mix, to create a Potion impossible to all but you and Severus. As cries mingle you come, white-hot heat flooding your body. Hand in hand your climax recedes, leaving in its wake tired contentness and perspiration.</p><p>“Exquisite,” he compliments you, brown eyes shades lighter and completely open.</p><p>And alone with him, always a touch of gentleness unexpected from such a man. Once upon a time, that was true, but despite doubts, you have recovered the best of Severus. That one word is enough to set arousal ablaze once more, the thrill of Thursday morning and others requiring your presence, not a deterrent.</p><p>As Severus’ smirk mirrors your own, an unforgettable birthday is marked down in history.</p>
