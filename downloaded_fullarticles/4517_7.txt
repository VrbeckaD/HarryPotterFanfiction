    <p>Prologue</p><p>Remus woke up in a haze to see a figure sitting at the end of the bed, as his vision cleared he could see it was Sirius and he looked like he had been in a fight. Remus shot up.<br/>
“Sirius, what happened? Why do you have that cut on your face did I…”Remus trailed off</p><p>“Don’t worry Moons its no big deal. You got out and were being a little difficult.”</p><p>“What how did I get out?! Where are James and Peter?” Remus was starting to panic if he got out he may have really hurt someone.</p><p>“They’re fine, they’re with Dumbledore.”</p><p>“Why are they with Dumbledore; Sirius what happ…” Suddenly it all started to come back</p><p>
  <i>Severus Snape standing in the door of the Shrieking Shack, looking at a half transformed Remus Lupin.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>“GET OUT!!” Remus roared as hand pulled Snape out of the room</i>
</p><p>
  <i>“RUN YOU, IDIOT!!” Remus could make out James’ voice but the wolf had taken over making his way out the door chasing his friend and his enemy down the long tunnel when he was body checked from the side.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>“James go! I’ll hold him back!” Some called as the wolf began to scratch at someone.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>“Sirius I swear when this is over!” James called</i>
</p><p>
  <i>“Just go!”</i>
</p><p> </p><p>“How did Snape get down there? How did…” Remus could see the guilty look on Sirius’ face “ You didn’t” Sirius so a look on Remus’ face he had never seen before as his eyes began to glow that unearthly yellow</p><p>“He was being a little shit! Always following us trying to figure out ways to get us kicked out. I didn’t think he would actually go down there.”</p><p>
  <i> Sirius whipped around pointing his wand into the darkness.<br/>
“What do you want Snivallus?”</i>
</p><p>
  <i>“Why are you out after curfew Black? I should call Filch.”</i>
</p><p>
  <i>“You’re out too dumbass”</i>
</p><p>
  <i>“I’ll figure out what you four are up to eventually, all I have to do is ask that brother of yours, so eager to please.”</i>
</p><p>
  <i>Sirius’ face started to contort at the mention of Regulus having not spoken to his brother since he was sorted into Slytherin </i>
</p><p>
  <i>“Regulus knows nothing he’s too busy trying to please mommy and daddy,” he said with a sneer.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>“Unlike you, what was it he said such a disappointment he’s sure to be burned off the family tree just like the blood traitor Andromeda.”</i>
</p><p>
  <i>Sirius felt his hand tighten around his wand.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>“I’m going to figure out what you and your pack of blood traitor are up to and make sure you get kicked out of Hogwarts.”</i>
</p><p>
  <i>Sirius laughed, “If you want to find out so bad go to the whomping willow throw a rock there is a knot that will stop the tree from swinging its branches there is a tunnel there that goes to the Shrieking Shack and you’ll see.”<br/>
Sirius walked away believing Snape would never try it.</i>
</p><p>
  <i> </i>
</p><p>
  <i>At the willow, Sirius caught up with James, “What took you so long?” James asked</i>
</p><p>
  <i>“Ran into Snape told him to…” Sirius turned around seeing that the tree had stopped swinging; Snape had walked into the tunnel</i>
</p><p>
  <i>“SIRIUS WHAT DID YOU DO?!” James shouted a Snape pushed past them</i>
</p><p>
  <i>“Now I’m going to get rid of you once and for all.” James and Sirius chased after his. As Snape opened the door</i>
</p><p>
  <i>“GET OUT!!” Remus roared as hand pulled Snape out of the room</i>
</p><p>
  <i>“RUN YOU, IDIOT!!” James pushed Snape down the tunnel Remus on their heels.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>“James go! I’ll hold him back!” Sirius Body checked Remus into the tunnel wall. Trying to hold him back </i>
</p><p>
  <i>“Sirius I swear when this is over!” James called</i>
</p><p><i>“ I know Just go!”</i>  </p><p>“I didn’t think he would go down there, he just always after us always around I just wanted him to leave us alone.” Sirius tried to make Remus understand when Remus reeled back punching Sirius in the face.<br/>
“YOU BASTARD!! STAY AWAY FROM ME!!!” Sirius holding his face in shock as Remus yelled again “GET OUT!! YOU’RE JUST LIKE THEM!!”</p><p>Sirius left the hospital wing never looking back. ‘It will be fine I know it will, Remus will forgive me once he gets better. I’m not like them, I’m not.’ But Sirius wasn’t sure if he believed that anymore.</p>
