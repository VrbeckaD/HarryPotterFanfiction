  <u> <strong>A/N: Hello, people!</strong> </u>
</p><p>
  <u> <strong>I don't own Harry Potter.</strong> </u>
</p><p>
  <u> <strong>I have no beta.</strong> </u>
</p><p>
  <u> <strong>ENJOY!</strong> </u>
</p><p align="center">
  <u> <strong>CHECK ME OUT ON TUMBLR. <a href="http://mister-tom-a-dildo-lover.tumblr.com/">MISTER-TOM-A-DILDO-LOVER</a> and <a href="http://helly-watermelonsmellinfellon.tumblr.com/">HELLY-WATERMELONSMELLINFELLON</a>. I FOLLOW BACK.</strong> </u>
</p><hr/><p>“We can fix this,” Harry insisted as he waved his hands frantically. “It’s really not as bad as you think it is. It goes nicely with your complexion.”</p><p>Tom’s glare silenced any further attempts at calming the man down.</p><p>“Harry, what is my favourite colour?”</p><p>“Green and then black.”</p><p>“What House am I in?”</p><p>“Slytherin.”</p><p>“Am I a day or a night person?”</p><p>Harry sighed, getting what Tom was doing and wondering why he was in a relationship with such a drama queen. “Night, because brightness annoys you.”</p><p>“So what in Merlin’s name would possess you to make my hair yellow out of all the colours you could have chosen?”</p><p>“I didn’t realise that ochre was not a dark shade of brown. It sounds like something you would name a shade of brown! I was supposed to just be a dark brown and I wanted to see how long it would take for you to realise that you hair was no longer black! I had planned to make a bet with Malfoy over it.”</p><p>“Harry, ochre comes in many colours and you did not specify which colour when you said the incantation, did you?”</p><p>Harry pouted. “I didn’t know that. Can’t you just fix it and then go back to normal?”</p><p>“I could,” said Tom smoothly. “I simply think that you need to learn your lesson.”</p><p>One second Harry had a full head of hair, and the next his head felt crowded by unexplainable weight. To further his confusion, there was some hissing of multiple pitches in his ears.</p><p>It wasn’t until something smooth and scaly brushed against the side of his face and he came face to face with several serpent heads, that he understood what Tom had done.</p><p>“Did you just turn me into a mini Medusa?” demanded the Gryffindor, jaw tight and eyes narrowed.</p><p>Tom was smiling though his eyes were tight. “We get to go out like this until both spells wear off. Isn’t it wonderful?”</p><p>The fake joy made Harry want to punch Tom in the perfect nose.</p><p>“This means war, Riddle.”</p><p>A smirk. “Bring it, Potter.”</p><hr/><p>
