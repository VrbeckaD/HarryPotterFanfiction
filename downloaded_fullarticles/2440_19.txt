    <p><span dir="ltr"><span class="">“Ginny,” Hermione giggled, sipping at her wine. “I don’t think we should be playing around with the spells in that book.”</span></span><br/><br/>Ginny laughed. “Luna is supervising, right, Luna?” She turned to the blonde, who was staring at the ceiling in concentration.<br/><br/>“It doesn’t look like it,” Hermione said, arching a brow.<br/><br/>“Hermione, relax, it’ll be fine,” Ginny assured her, sipping at her own wine as she flipped through the pages of the spell book.<br/><br/>“Bondings are a serious magic,” Luna said dreamily. She smiled at her two girlfriends before looking back at the ceiling. “Hermione, love, you have nargles.”<br/><br/>“Yes, thank you, Luna,” Hermione said, dismissing her comment. Something in her gut told her this was a bad idea, and she tried to make heads or tails of the feelings. When Ginny had suggested a girls’ night in, she had been all for it. Wine and laughter, who wouldn’t want that? But when Ginny pulled out an old spellbook, Hermione began to worry.<br/><br/>“Oooh, look,” Ginny said. “This one should tell us who our soulmates are.” She looked at the two excitingly. “Let’s do it.”<br/><br/>“Ginny,” Hermione said, warningly. <br/><br/>“Come on, it’ll be great,” Ginny exclaimed. <br/><br/>“I already know who my soulmate is, but if you insist on doing it,” Luna said airly. <br/><br/>Ginny cleared her throat. “<em>Anima Vinculum Revelare</em>.” <br/><br/>A bright green light filled the room, flashing brightly before exploding into sparks. A bright, flaming name appeared in front of each girl. <br/><br/>“Awh, mine says Harry!” Ginny exclaimed, giggling.<br/><br/>“And Ron is mine,” Luna said. <br/><br/>Hermione looked at the name in front of hers in confusion. “He’s dead.”<br/><br/>“Who is it?” Ginny asked, looking over.<br/><br/>“Regulus,” Hermione said softly.<br/><br/>“As in Regular Black? Sirius’ brother?” Ginny asked.<br/><br/>“Yes,” Hermione said, confused. “What does that mean?”<br/><br/>The three names faded from view, and Hermione hissed, grabbing her left hand. Looking down, she saw a mark had branded itself around her ring finger. “What in Merlin’s name!” she exclaimed.<br/><br/>“I have one too!” Ginny cried out. <br/><br/>“And there’s mine,” Luna said happily.<br/><br/>“Ginny, what the bloody hell did you do!” Hermione demanded to know.<br/><br/>“It was just a soulmate reveal spell,” Ginny said, holding her hands up in defence. “I didn’t do anything.”<br/><br/>“No, it was a soul bond reveal,” Luna commented. “That one bonds you to your soul bond.”<br/><br/>“Bonds?” Hermione asked, her voice shaking.<br/><br/>“Yes, like marriage. Ron and Harry likely having matching marks.”<br/><br/>Ginny’s eyes widened. “My mum's going to murder me, Hermione.”<br/><br/>“Well, mine clearly is faulty since Regulus is dead.”<br/><br/>“He must not be,” Luna said. “The spell wouldn’t have worked if he wasn’t.”<br/><br/>“What?” Hermione asked, her throat going dry.<br/><br/>“Shit, I have to find Harry,” Ginny said, standing up. “Sorry, girls.” She turned on the spot, Disapparating.<br/><br/>“I suppose I should find Ron,” Luna said, standing. “Don’t worry, Hermione; it’ll work out.” Luna smiled at her before Disapparating.<br/><br/>“So much for girls’ night in,” Hermione muttered. She looked down at the mark imprinted on her skin. Apparently Regulus Black was alive somewhere… and they were bonded. <br/><br/>“Well, shite,” she said, pouring herself another glass of wine.</p>
