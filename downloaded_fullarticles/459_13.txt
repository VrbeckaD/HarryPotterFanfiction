    <p>• jock (obviously), can &amp; will do 5 hour training sessions before a quidditch match<br/>
• mother hen - commonly heard phrases include "Pads, stop whining &amp; do your homework", "Food is actually required for most beings, Moony. Eat the damn soup - you're sick", "Wormtail, I think Mary would be more impressed if you were alive, stOp trying to do tricks on the stairs"<br/>
• dork dork dork, honestly this boy gets adorably giggly over the stupidest puns, &amp; then if there's Regulus or Lily involved? he blushes if either even make eye contact with him. God help him if he ever tOUches them - the poor boy blushes so much you'd think he'd had an allergic reaction (&amp; by touching I literally mean brushing past each other in a crowded hallway)<br/>
• the biggest wolfstar shipper omg, poor lad has had to put up with every bit of their bs (&amp; cuteness too tbf)<br/>
• huge nerd - knows literally everything there is to know about quidditch (unsurprisingly), but also knows tons of random stuff like birth dates of authors no one has ever heard of or the Latin for random objects</p>
