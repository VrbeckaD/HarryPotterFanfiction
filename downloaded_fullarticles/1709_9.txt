    <p>Poe Dameron crossed his arms, tapping his foot impatiently against the stone floor. After his last exam before the Christmas break, he’d been hoping for some time to relax. Standing in the middle of the dungeon hallway, shouting the names of animals at a wall, wasn’t quite what he’d had in mind.</p>
<p><em>Come on, it’s something…</em> He scoured his memory. Whose idea had it been to change the password every fortnight? Who could keep track of that? <em>Some kind of snake… serpent thing…</em></p>
<p>“Basilisk!”</p>
<p>The wall remained as immutable as ever. Poe drew his wand out of his robes. It took all his willpower to resist blasting the barrier to bits with an exploding charm. He could have done so easily. The <em>Bombarda</em> charm was one of the few spells he’d excelled at beyond class expectations, mastering the more complicated variations well before his third year at Hogwarts. As his charms professor, Professor Ackbar had put it, no other student had ever demonstrated such acumen and glee when it came to “the prospect of blowing something – <em>anything</em> – up”. Poe considered it a gift. Others considered it an addiction.</p>
<p>Sadly, the administration likely wouldn’t be too pleased if he blew a hole through the entrance to the Slytherin Dungeon. So, he restrained himself.</p>
<p>“Boomslang! Runespoor! Ashwinder! Limax!” (He wasn’t even sure if that counted as a snake.) “Filet of a Fenny Snake!”</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>“Please,” Poe groaned, as if the barrier would take pity on him and decide to admit a possible intruder just this once.</p>
<p>He set his bag next to the wall and slumped down beside it. Although blasting the barrier was undoubtedly a more exciting alternative, it was probably wiser to wait for help. Unfortunately, the castle was much emptier than usual, with most of the student having left on the first train going back to King’s Cross for Christmas.</p>
<p>After a miserably long wait, Poe was grateful to hear the echo of footsteps rounding the corner. The approaching student was not a fellow Slytherin as he had hoped but a welcomed face, nonetheless.</p>
<p>“Finn, Buddy!” he called out to the fifth-year Gryffindor. “What are you doing here?”</p>
<p>Finn stared down at him. He looked somewhat perplexed to find his friend camping out on the floor of the corridor near midnight, but not too surprised; he’d found Poe in far stranger circumstances before.</p>
<p>“What are you doing on the floor?” he asked. “And what were you screaming about… wait. Did you forget your password again?”</p>
<p>“Er… maybe,” Poe said. He didn’t stand for strict divisions between the houses by any means (Quidditch matches were an exception), but there was something ignominious about always having to ask his Gryffindor friends for the password. The password to the Slytherin dungeons was meant to be a secret kept within the house, but with Ben Solo’s habit of bellowing it whenever the barrier was stubborn made it hard to contain leaks.</p>
<p>“Figured,” Finn said. “Don’t you guys have a notice board or something to let people know when the password changes.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, but no one checks that,” Poe whined.</p>
<p>“No one.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. No one, or at least very few people.”</p>
<p>“That’s interesting, because if no one checks it, you’d think you’d find the whole of Slytherin house trapped out here like…”</p>
<p>“Okay, fine. <em>I</em> didn’t check it this time. Happy?”</p>
<p>Finn chuckled and shook his head before turning to the barrier.</p>
<p>“Hmm,” he said. “I think Rey said she heard Ben use the password the other day…”</p>
<p><em>They were probably sneaking in to bang each other</em>, Poe wanted to add, but decided against gossiping. He’d heard that Ben Solo and Rey had gotten into the habit of meeting in the Slytherin dormitories for some “private” activities. Poe had been fortunate enough to be out of the dormitories during these times, but from what he’d heard, Ben’s Quieting Charm was too weak to conceal the noise…</p>
<p>“It’s some kind of serpent,” Finn said. “Something like a Basilisk or… a Selma?”</p>
<p>The stones began to rumble, shifting aside to reveal a staircase behind the wall.</p>
<p>“Thanks,” Poe said sheepishly. “I’ll pay you back for helping me out these pasts few times.”</p>
<p>“You don’t have to,” Finn replied. “Though something sweet from the trolley on the ride back home would be nice.” He hesitated before asking, “Are you going to sit with us on the train back?”</p>
<p>“I…” Poe wasn’t sure yet, but he’d know soon enough. “We’ll see. Thanks for the offer, I mean, I’d love to catch up with you, Rey, Paige, her sister, the whole gang… but I still don’t know for sure if Armitage is going home for the holidays. You know he… likes to keep to himself sometimes.” He felt guilty for depicting his boyfriend as a bitter misanthrope (even if it was true to some extent), but it was better than disclosing the full explanation.</p>
<p>“Sure,” Finn didn’t say anything else on the subject, though they both knew his opinion of Armitage could have been higher. “Well, I hope I’ll see you before the vacation. If not, say ‘hi’ to your dad for me.”</p>
<p>“Of course. Merry Christmas, Finn.”</p>
<p>“Merry Christmas to you too. Have a good night.”</p>
<p>With that, Poe descended the staircase. The stones grumbled as they moved back into place, closing the barrier behind him.</p>
<p>The Slytherin Common Room was nearly deserted, most of the students having taken the first train back home for the holidays. If not for the occasional meowing from one of the armchairs, Poe would have assumed the room was empty.</p>
<p>Armitage was seated before the chess set, waving his wand at a line of candles, muttering an inaudible incantation. Which each of his motions, the flame of the central candle died and rekindled itself. The same pattern was repeated by the adjacent candle, spreading down the line like fallen dominoes.</p>
<p>“You’re back late,” Armitage said, still focused on his spell.</p>
<p>“I had to make up the history of magic exam,” said Poe. Armitage’s orange tabby cat Millicent, who had been curled in her owner’s lap, leapt to the floor to weave between Poe’s legs. He smiled and reached down to stroke her fur. It was a relief that she’d finally warmed up to him. Their first few encounters had been ridden with hissing and painful scratches. “The one I missed when I was out after the Quidditch Match, remember?”</p>
<p>He waited for Armitage to begin interrogating him on the exam. Normally, Armitage didn’t concern himself with others’ academic performance; he had more than enough anxiety about his own exam scores as it was. Ever since the two had started dating, however, Armitage had deemed it his responsibility to make sure his boyfriend didn’t “soil his future” by slacking on his schoolwork.</p>
<p>But this time there was no lecture on work ethics, not even the questions about the exam’s difficulty. Armitage gave nothing but a silent nod. As annoying as his nagging often was, the lack of it was unsettling.</p>
<p>“What were you doing with those?” Poe asked, pointing to the candles.</p>
<p>“Protean charm,” Armitage replied. He frowned and straightened his posture. When he spoke again, his voice had regained his usual loftiness, laced with disdain to cover his unease. He was known at Hogwarts – infamous in some cases – for his aloof aura, a regal air that seemed discordant with his scrawny built and pallid appearance. “I’ve been practicing for my N.E.W.Ts. They say the Protean charm is on the Charms N.E.W.T. every year without fail.”</p>
<p>“Protean charm…” It sounded vaguely familiar, though Poe could not recall the details. “That’s… that’s the connecting one, right?”</p>
<p>“It links items, allowing for synchronization,” Armitage said, rolling his eyes as if he were explaining that London was a city in England. “I connected the candles such that if one goes out, the others shall do the same in succession, and the same rule applies for lighting. See.” He demonstrated the spell once more. “I was also able to link the chess set too. Watch. Pawn to A4.”</p>
<p>No sooner had the desired piece reached its spot did a pawn from the opposing team move forward two spaces. The other pieces then jumped to life, and the game unfolded as if two invisible opponents were at battle in the world’s fastest match of Wizard’s Chess. The pieces came to rest with a single white bishop set to capture the opposing team’s king.</p>
<p>“Impressive,” Poe said. “Do you know how to undo it?”</p>
<p>“What?” Armitage looked appalled by the mere thought of undoing his hard work.</p>
<p>“I mean, can you get the chess set back to normal? Or are you planning on using this to cheat in your next match against Connix?”</p>
<p>“Oh, of course there’s a counter charm,” Armitage said, waving the question away. “I’ll have the set back to normal before the end of the break. Besides, this would be a poor devise for cheating. The game finishes as soon as it’s begun, using the first move to develop the finest strategy, you see…”</p>
<p>“How do you know it’s the best strategy?” Poe asked with a smirk.</p>
<p>“Please, Dameron. You know I could beat you at this game half-drunk with my eyes closed.”</p>
<p>“Sounds like a fun challenge.” Poe hesitated. He lowered his voice, taking extra care to maintain a casual tone. He’d learned from experience that probing questions only made Armitage even more reluctant to voice his worries. “But we’ll have to hold off on it until after the break.”</p>
<p>Armitage straightened in his seat, flexing his fingers in his lap, his usual nervous gesture. He didn’t look at Poe, staring intently at the crackling fireplace instead.</p>
<p>“Evidently.” he said. “You’re taking the train home tomorrow, aren’t you?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, my dad would freak out otherwise,” Poe replied. “Are you going home?”</p>
<p><em>Please say no</em>. He braced himself for the answer. Armitage had been undecided about his lodgings for the holidays. It was one of the few decisions that he always waited until the last minute to finalize. He’d been given more options than most students due to “extenuating circumstances”, as Professor Sloane had called it. The potions professor had even offered to let Armitage stay with her family until school was back in session, an alternative that Poe had tried to steer his partner towards.</p>
<p>“Of course, I am,” Armitage said, as if the question had never been up for debate. “My father is expecting me. It would be disrespectful for me not to return home for the break.”</p>
<p>Poe’s face fell. Armitage cut in, preempting the usual protests:</p>
<p>“Don’t give me that look, Dameron,” he snapped. “We’ve been over this, every time before the winter holiday, every time before classes end for the summer. I can handle myself in my own home around my own father perfectly fine.”</p>
<p>Armitage didn’t discuss his father often; he rarely discussed anything personal with anyone besides Poe, Professor Sloane and perhaps Mitaka and Phasma if he was in an unusually sociable mood. It wasn’t until their third year, when their status as tolerated peers had begun to shift closer to friendship, that Armitage had mentioned his father to Poe, and the subject had come up quite arbitrarily.</p>
<p>They’d been discussing Squibs. The concept of children born to wizarding parents who nonetheless lacked magical abilities had never occurred to Poe. As a Muggle-born himself, he found it particularly fascinating.</p>
<p>
  <em>“It’s like a backwards Muggle-born then,” he remembered saying.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“I suppose you could put it like that,” Armitage hadn’t shown any discomfort towards the subject at first, so Poe had probed further.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“So… how would someone know they were a Squib? Is there a test or…”</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“Most wizards and witches show some signs of magic when they’re seven or younger.” Poe could still envision the way Armitage had paused there, his face contorting into a grimace as if he were about to reveal some kind of crime. “I was late. In fact, my father thought I could be a Squib at first.”</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“Oh… so how did you find out you weren’t?” Poe had asked, too excited by the prospect of Armitage finally opening up to him to take note of the shifting mood.</em>
</p>
<p>Armitage’s immediate answer had been vague, yielding no information other than the fact that he was six-and-a-half when he first demonstrated magical capabilities, and his father had been “relieved”. He’d later disclosed in a separate conversation that the first signs of magic often came about in times of extreme emotions, and that some families could induce the emergence of their child’s abilities by evoking joy or distress. At that point, Poe had gathered enough facts about Brendol Hux to deduce that he hadn’t opted for the former.</p>
<p>Still, Poe had been uncertain, at first, whether it was his place to keep Armitage from his father. It had nothing to do with doubting his opinion of Brendol, but there was something deeply unsettling, sacrilegious even, about sabotaging any father-son relationship. But these reservations had become insignificant several Septembers ago, when Armitage had arrived at King’s Cross with marks that even his thick robes couldn’t cover up.</p>
<p>“What happened to Professor Sloane?” Poe was struggling to keep his voice down. It was too late at night to be shouting in the common room, and the last thing they needed was to attract a crowd. “I thought you were going to take her up on her invite this year…”</p>
<p>“<em>Invite</em>,” Armitage scoffed. “It’s not an invite. It’s charity. I’m not much into the festivities, you know, but spending the whole holiday being a pity cause isn’t exactly the break I had in mind. I’m sure Professor Sloane understands.”</p>
<p>There were times when Armitage’s pride was admirable, or at least respectable. Other times, Poe found it beyond exasperating.</p>
<p> “You could come home with me,” Poe half expected Armitage to burst into laughter at the suggestion but pursued it anyway. “My dad would love to meet you. You know, he always asks about that whenever I talk about you. This… this could work out.”</p>
<p>“Oh, that sounds just <em>wonderful</em>,” Armitage drawled out the final word. “I couldn’t think of a better way for me to break the news about our little love affair to my father than by running off to spend Christmas in a Muggle household. ‘Muggle-born boyfriend’. I don’t know which of those words he’ll despise more.”</p>
<p>“We’ll make it work. Come on. We’ve done some riskier things for much less important reasons before…”</p>
<p>Poe knew he’d lost but wasn’t about to back down. Armitage shook his head.</p>
<p>“You can be so hard to talk to, Dameron,” he said, giving Poe a long, hard look. “You’re impossible, really. You drive me mad, and maybe that’s why I can’t let anything happen to you. The last thing I need is for my father to link you and your family to my ‘corruption’.” He extinguished the candles with a flick of his wand, leaving small lines of smoke trailing towards the ceiling. “And sick as it sounds, so long as he gives a damn about me, he’s going to make that connection, and I don’t want to risk him or his friends reacting violently.”</p>
<p>“Then you should understand why I can’t just let you go back there knowing there’s another option,” Poe said bitterly, “Knowing what happens when you do…”</p>
<p>As expected, this did nothing against Armitage’s resolve, but his eyes softened, and that was something at least.</p>
<p>“I do understand,” Armitage said. “Your concern… I… I do, appreciate it, Dameron, but it doesn’t change anything in the end.”</p>
<p>He strode to where Poe was seated. The armchair was not quite big enough for both of them, but they made do, Armitage leaning into Poe’s lap, stabilized by an arm around his waist. He didn’t normally seek physical contact, and when he did, it was oftentimes intended as either a distraction or an apology.</p>
<p>“In the end, none of this will matter,” he went on. “We’re both legal adults now. I just need to find a stable job for myself, gather enough resources to live comfortably on my own. Afterwards, whatever mistakes I make will fall on me, not my father, and I figure he’ll stop caring once his reputation isn’t at stake, once his political career isn’t at stake. Maybe I can find something in the ministry that has nothing to do with law enforcement, so I really won’t have to deal with him. Then, <em>we</em> can work from there.” He gave a weak smile. “It’s only a matter of time.”</p>
<p>“And until then?” Poe already knew the answer.</p>
<p>“Be patient and stop worrying about me.”</p>
<p>“You do realize, that’d be a pretty lousy thing for me to do.”</p>
<p>“I know, Dameron.” Armitage said with extra finality. He leaned further into Poe. “Now, were you really planning on spending the whole night arguing about my father, or do you have a better good-bye in mind?” His lips brushed against Poe’s neck. “Aren’t you going to miss me during the holiday?”</p>
<p>Poe wasn’t one to leave dire matters unfinished. He hated the lack of closure, the ongoing uncertainty. But he also knew when an argument was going nowhere. Their hands were tied, and the best he could do for Armitage was to give him some sense of a sanctuary.</p>
<p>“Of course,” Poe said, pulling his boyfriend closer for a kiss. Armitage’s lips were cold and tasted of sweet afternotes.</p>
<p>They drew back, hearts racing. Armitage cast a nervous glance at the entrance to the common room.</p>
<p>“We should find somewhere more private,” he murmured.</p>
<p>“Mmm… well, Nix and Bascus are gone already for the break, so my room is open…” Poe nodded at Armitage’s prefect badge. “But I hear the prefects have bigger beds…”</p>
<p>It was long past midnight, when the two rested, tangled in the sheets of Armitage’s four poster bed, robes strewn around the otherwise pristine room. Poe gazed at the ceiling, letting the ecstasy fade away into the cold of night and the ambiguity of another day to come.</p>
<p>Armitage was curled up against him. Judging by the sounds of his quick breathing and hammering heartbeat, he was not yet asleep but content to keep up the pretense. Poe held him fast till morning.</p>
