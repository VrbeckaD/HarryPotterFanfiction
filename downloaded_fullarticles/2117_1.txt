    <p>Chapter 1;</p><p>Harry wandered down the street, towards the large playing field where he could see the shape of Luna reclined on a tartan picnic blanket. It was nice, he thought, to have found a place so peaceful for them to stay. Running away from Britain had not been in his plan but that didn't mean he was not aware of the necessity. Voldemort may be gone but there were still people who wanted him dead, so getting away was the best solution<br/>It helped, he supposed, that he had managed to bring his family when he left. Ron had opted to stay at the burrow, but Fred and George had decided they needed a change too, so Hermione followed suit. It was Luna who had suggested the move in the first place and at first they had laughed at her, but soon Harry came around to the idea that maybe they did need a break, and moving from Grimmauld Place was a definite plus. As he drew nearer to Luna he noticed that rather than watching the clouds, as was her usual pastime, she was watching two figures slightly further away who were passing a football between them and laughing at one another as they made more and more ridiculous movements and jumps to catch it. Harry sat down next to Luna on the blanket and watched them quietly for a moment, taking in the two boys. One was tall, very tall looking even from this distance, and had a good arm, making the smaller boy jump quite high in order to catch the flying ball. The smaller boy, however, seemed to take this in his stride and did so with elegance Harry would imagine of a dancer. This boy was shorter, and thinner, but held himself in a way that reminded Harry of Hermione a little- poised and strong.<br/>He heard a chuckle to his left, and turned to see Luna smiling at him. "Somebody caught your interest?" she said, looking pointedly back towards the smaller boy, and Harry laughed.<br/>"I don't think I would say no, to be honest" he replied, then went back to watching the game.<br/>Later, once Harry and Luna had returned home, Hermione knocked on the open door of his bedroom, "knock knock" she said, "Can I come in?"<br/>"Of course" he said, and turned his desk chair to look towards her.<br/>"How are you feeling about tomorrow?" she asked, sitting on the end of his bed. "Are you ready?"<br/>Harry laughed, "should you not be asking that to everyone else? At least I have been to muggle school before, albeit in a different country." Hermione smiled at this, then raised her eyebrows at him. "Okay I'm a little nervous," he conceded, "but I'm sure it will be fine. It will be nice to feel normal for once."<br/>"Oh Harry, this is high school, there is no way you can play that card. On accent alone, we're not normal here."<br/>"Damn, I didn't think of that."<br/>"I suppose we're just going to have to get used to being abnormal then" said a voice from the doorway, and he glanced up to see Luna leaning against the frame. "Or at least," she amended, "you will. I have never been normal."<br/>Harry and Hermione both laughed at that. She wasn't wrong, but their friendship had strengthened more since the move, living together proved to be a very good way of getting to understand one another. Harry had been surprised at the lack of conflict between the girls, since they had such different personalities. Eventually though he had to admit that they complimented each other perfectly and was glad to see his friends getting along so well.<br/>"Anyway, I came up to tell you dinner is ready. By some miracle, nothing got blown up in the process." She laughed, then turned and headed down the stairs, followed closely by Hermione and Harry.<br/>Harry entered the kitchen to see the family already at the table. Of course, they were a unique family if ever he saw one, but they were a family nonetheless. He noticed a large chicken placed in the center of the table, surrounded by vegetables, and laughed.<br/>"You know they celebrate Thanksgiving in November right?" he joked, and ducked as Fred aimed a swat at his head.<br/>"Shut up Harry, I'm not giving up my Sunday Dinners just because mum isn't here to cook for me anymore," said George, who was adding a plate of delicious looking roast potatoes to the spread. Then he grinned as Remus' hand was slapped away from them by a hungry-looking Sirius.<br/>"Mine." said Sirius, to laughs around the table, as he piled potatoes onto his plate and then, looking sheepish, handed the plate over to Remus.<br/>As everyone else helped themselves to the food, Harry noticed that Remus was rather quieter than usual. He said nothing until dinner was over, but he followed Remus to the office once they had cleaned up and sat down on the sofa in the corner.<br/>"What's up?" he said, to Remus' look of confusion.<br/>"What do you mean?" asked Remus.<br/>"What's on your mine?" said Harry. "I've never known you say so little throughout diner. Is it work?"<br/>Remus sighed, and moved over to the sofa that Harry was sat on, perching on the corner and leaning his elbows onto his knees. He didn't say anything for a few minutes, but he did look at Harry who waited patiently.<br/>"I know that everything is going to be fine, but teaching at muggle school is just going to be so different. I can't shake the feeling that I'm going to do or say something really stupid, or that they're not going to listen to a word I say or," he trailed off and Harry placed a hand on his arm.<br/>"Remus, you're going to teach in a high school. They may be muggles, but they are still teenagers, and you managed fine teaching at Hogwarts. Teenagers don't listen, that is a fact of life, but if anybody can convince them that it might be worth a shot, it's you. Just trust yourself." Harry paused for a moment, then carried on. "You were the best defense teacher we ever had, and I know you don't love Literature as much as you loved defense but you still love what you will be teaching and it will show." He stood to leave, but as he reached the door Remus spoke again.<br/>"How do you always know what to say?" he whispered.<br/>"Well I was chosen, of course" Harry laughed. "Shall I send Siri up?"<br/>"No, thank you. I'm just going to check on the syllabus and make sure I have planned everything, are you all still watching a movie later?"<br/>"Yeah, Fred chose some crime drama or something, are you going to join us?"<br/>"Sure, give me a call when the popcorn is ready," chuckled Remus.<br/>"Will do," said Harry, as he closed the office door behind him and headed down the stairs.</p>
