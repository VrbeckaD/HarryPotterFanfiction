  <em>Dear Miss Hermione Jean Granger</em>
</p><p>
  <em>This letter is to inform you of the new law regarding marriages between wizards and witches, from now on called <strong>Marriage Law I. </strong>As you may know, the Great Wizarding World, in which you fought as well, has cost us a tremendous decrease of population in UK. Our current numbers are not encouraging, and we are greatly concerned that the popoulation will be reduced even more the next years, as many of our young people were killed and the elders are not able to produce more offspring.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>After our congress in October 26th, we have decided that all the British wizards and witches aged 20-45 will be matched with a suitable partner, male or female. The match will be done after the wizards and witches fill a questionnaire, which will be immediately evaluated with all the others. The questionnaire is in every letter we send to the candidates. It includes some general questions, so we will be able to detect basic datas, and then more specific questions, so we will be able to evaluate some personality traits. After you answer all of the questions, you sign the questionnaire and send it back to the Ministry.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>In a week, you will have your first response from us, informing you for your most suitable match in a percentage from 50 to 100%. If you are not satisfied with the outcome, you can submit yourself in the evaluation process once more. The choice is obligatory. When you decide about your future partner and discuss the matter with them, both of you will send us a letter in which you will confirm the union. The marriage will have to take place in a year and the first pregnancy six months after the wedding.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>If you don't want to be married with the suggested partners or fail to comply in any other way, you will be prosecuted to the Ministry and be stripped off of your magical powers. You will be granted of financial help in order to adjust in your new life, for the first 12 months. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Yours Sincerely,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Ministry of Magic.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Hermione crumbled the letter into her hands, making it a small ball. She felt her magic filling her apartment, such was her rage.</p><p>
  <em>After everything we've done for you, after everything we sacrificed, you have decided our primary role is to be broodmares for the state. I will not give you the power to dictate my life. Not anymore. I will never be anyone's toy.</em>
</p><hr/><p> </p><p>After Voldemort's defeat, she had decided to stay alone for a while. This...whole thing between Ron and her would never work out. It was more than obvious that they were not meant to be. They were way too different. A relationship would only bring them heartache and effectively destroy their friendship.</p><p>She didn't want that. At least, that's what she repeatedly told him when she decided to leave him. She would never forget his tears, his pleas to her to stay with him, to try and make it work. His faith in them.</p><p>
  <em>All you could feel was numbness. He tore out his heart for you and you simply told him to find happiness with someone else. What is wrong with you, anyway? Are you even able to feel anymore?</em>
</p><p>Her friends had tried to help her after the war. Some of them had even started therapy sessions and visits to psychoanalysts, in order to cope with the horrible memories of the war and the aftermath. Harry, Ron, George, Luna, Neville, Hannah Abbott. Eventually, they convinced her to give it a try,too. And it was successful. She stopped having nightmares, she didn't give a fuck about the <em>MUDBLOOD </em>scar on her wrist, she had learnt how to let the bitterness and the despair.</p><p>What she hadn't achieved, was to feel like she belonged in this world. The magical world used to be everything to her. It was the explanation why she was so different from any other kid in the muggle school, why she was able to do weird things. When she first set foot on the Hogwarts grounds, she thought she had finally found her home. The place where she truly belonged to.</p><p>
  <em>How fool I was...</em>
</p><p>From the very first day, everyone and everything seemed to be against her once more. The pureblood children, Malfoy and his followers mostly, made sure to let her know that she didn't belong in their world. That she was an abomination, a creature unworthy of her magic. She had never believed them, never given a second thought to their racistic beliefs.</p><p>But then, the war happened. Out of everyone else, muggleborns were most in danger. And suddenly, the sense of belonging had dissappeared. She was the pariah once more. The unwanted. At least, the muggle world would have provided her peace. She couldn't have that in the wizarding world, not as long as Voldemort lived and breathed.</p><p>During her therapies, as she was patiently rediscovering herself, she found herself deeply missing her old life. The life before Hogwarts, the life before the Basilisk, the life before the Dementors, the life before her torture at Malfoy Manor. To her utmost horror, she more than missed it; she wanted to return to it.</p><p>Her therapist, probably misinterpreting her feelings as nothing more than nostalgia, reassured her that this was just a phase she had to go through. Of course it was perfectly normal to question if she really wanted to stay in a world which had brought her only troubles. It would slowly leave her, and then she would be able to enjoy her life as a magical being again.</p><p>Alas, time does not always heal. Her doubts grew more and more. Until she had come to the conclusion that she didn't want this life.</p><hr/><p> </p><p>She didn't want to admit it at first. Perhaps it was something childish inside her, to not give the pureblood snobs the satisfaction that they were right, that she didn't belong in their world and she had finally started to feel it. As time passed, she dismissed those thoughts. It had nothing to do with childish behavior or reactions, or war trauma. It was...just her.</p><p>She was <em>tired. </em>Exhausted. Dissapointed. The world she had loved had shown her a face as ugly as the muggle world had. Muggles had the two World Wars, the wizards had the two wars against Voldemort. It was more of the same. A lunatic, wanting power and total dominion, gathering people and convincing them of the truth of his beliefs. Taking their money, their homes, <em>their lives</em> to see his sick dreams coming to fruition. And finally, dying and leaving everything destroyed, beyond repair.</p><p>The world she had loved so fiercely, the world she had once thought she would protect until her last breath, this world had betrayed her. </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Coming out of her reverie, she looked at the questionnaire, still inside the envelope. Sighing, she decided to fill it and send it.</p><p>
  <em>How bad can it be? Let's see.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Name</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Gender</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Age and Date of Birth</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Blood Status</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Level of Education</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Hobbies</em>
</p><p>These were the general questions. The specific questions were about various topics, such as <em>How do you imagine yourself in 10 years?  Who would be the ideal man/woman for you? How many children would you want? What do you wish to find in a marriage?</em></p><p>Every single question seemed ridiculous to her. Nonetheless, she completed the questionnaire, signed it and sent it back to the MInistry the next day.</p><hr/><p>
  <em>Congratulations, Miss Granger!</em>
</p><p>
  <em>We were able to find you a suitable partner almost immediately. The percentage of your compatibility is currently the highest one we have calculated.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Your chosen partner is: Draco Lucius Malfoy. Compatibility: 99%.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>If you are not satisified with the results, you can form the application for re-evaluation. The document is disclosed in the envelope with your results.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>She felt the world around her spinning violently. Breathless, she fell on her sofa. Crookshanks was in the kitchen and, probably sensing her distress, came to her, jumped on her knees and licked her fingers,trying to soothe her.</p><p>
  <em>You are fucking kidding me. Malfoy. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Of all people, Malfoy. Who hates my guts, who would rather die than fuck me and be infected with my muggle germs. His mother would sneer every time she saw me and his father...</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Well, his father would strangle any babies we had in their cribs.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I'd rather die.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I'd rather lose my powers.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Anything. Anything but this.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Malfoy...</em>
</p><hr/><p>Another sore subject during her therapy sessions was her feelings about her school bullies. Her therapist had suggested many ways she could overcome her hatred and disgust for them, to no avail. One of them was to find them and try to have a civil conversation.</p><p>
  <em>Civil conversation my arse. From me? Yes, I could cooperate. But them? Never.</em>
</p><p>Draco Malfoy had been a very sensitive topic about Hermione. She had tearfully narrated to Maya, her therapist, how he had always made her feel like she deserved nothing from his world, right from the first year. How it had felt when he first called her a mudblood, how it felt when she learnt he wished for her death at second year. How much of a coward he was, that it almost cost Buckbeak's life. How he had looked at her while his psycho aunt was torturing her, with a look almost cold and apathetic. How he had the chance to stay at their side when Voldemort called them, but proved himself a coward once more.</p><p>It certainly hadn't helped that she didn't believe a single thing she had said in court to his defence. Harry had convinced her, saying they owed at least this to Narcissa Malfoy. Her words sounded empty and ridiculous to her ears, even now.</p><p><em>He didn't have a choice. </em>He had.</p><p><em>He had to save his family. </em>There were so many other ways.</p><p><em>He was misled, the pureblood beliefs had been indoctrinated to every pureblood offspring since birth. </em>That's why he went to school in first place, that's why we have books. He should have known better. If he didn't take anything useful from 7 years of education and months under Voldemort's pressure, he shouldn't get a second chance.</p><p>When they had returned to Hogwarts for completing their final year, he had tried to apologise.</p><p>Her answer was the epitome of cruelty. He had been cruel to her all those years, and she had never treated him the same. She wanted to hurt him as mush as he had hurt her.</p><p>Judging from his face and his eyes, she had striked bullseye.</p><p>
  <em>"What do you want me to say? Do you want me to forgive you, so that you can sleep without nightmares? Do you want absolution for your words and actions?"</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"I didn't mean that..."</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"Then what did you mean? Out of all people, are you so naive that you think that one "I'm sorry" will erase everything? Because, if this is what you believe, then fine. I forgive you."</em>
</p><hr/><p>The very next day, she started packing her things and preparing her departure. Her friends had sent her many owls, asking her about her matching. They also informed her about their own. Some of them were happy, some were not, some others were simply satisified with the outcome.</p><p>She had sent a small letter to everyone, reassuring them her matching had gone just fine and they would go out for a coffee the next days.</p><p>
  <em>I will answer to all of you properly when I have the time.</em>
</p><p>She also emptied her Gringots vault and turned her galleons to muggle current. At least, she didn't have to worry about finding a house. Her parents, still obliviated in Australia, had left her a small house in Northern Ireland. They had shown it to her during her 5th year, and she had loved it.</p><p>Taking a big breath, she stepped into the Floo and called her destination.</p><p>
  <em>For the final time.</em>
</p><hr/><p>The process of draining her from her magic was nothing less than painful. When she returned to her house-by feet-, she collapsed into sobs on the floor, clutching her heart. It had felt as if they were opening her alive, trying to cut her soul out of her.</p><p>
  <em>In a way, that's what happened. You lost a part of yourself.</em>
</p><p>With trembling hands, she took her wand and tried a simple spell. </p><p>"Aguamenti!"</p><p>Nothing.</p><hr/><p>Some days later, when she had finally picked up everything, Crookshanks in his cage, she looked at her old home, one last time. A few tears fell from her eyes, but other than that, she felt a huge relief.</p><p>
  <em>Freedom, at last.</em>
