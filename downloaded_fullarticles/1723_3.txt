    <p>“I must ask, <em>again</em>, why exactly I have to be the one doing this,” Remus Lupin protested for the third time, even as he let Dorcas Meadowes have at his forehead with a comically puffy brush of setting powder. “I mean, for Christ’s sake, Lily, I’m <em>Welsh!</em> Isn’t American football <em>America’s</em> pastime?”</p><p>“You’re too smart to play dumb, Remus. I know you know that’s baseball. And that we just call it football here,” Lily Evans— communications major, sociology minor, senior, and the glue that held The Willow together— nudged Mary aside to clasp both Remus’ shoulders. “Gilderoy Lockhart is an absolute <em>dickhead</em> who left us in the lurch to try out for a chorus spot in fucking West Side Story as if he isn’t a talentless hack with two left feet who only got into the theatre program because he fabricated a great CV.” She stared deeply into his eyes, her own vibrant green practically glowing with passion. “There’s no one else for the job but you. Are you going to be an even bigger dickhead by leaving us in the lurch because you’re afraid of the camera?”</p><p>Remus sagged in defeat. “You know I wouldn’t do that to you lot.”</p><p>“Of course you wouldn’t,” Lily said, smiling brilliantly. If Remus swung that way, he’d probably have fallen in love with her within a week of meeting. As it stood, he was very grateful to have stopped at her booth on Clubs Day, to have signed up for the school TV station (“but this is the year we’ll be known first and foremost for our online presence, Remus, and you’ll want to get in on the ground floor of that, <em>trust me</em>”), to have become her friend. “We’re <em>your</em> lot now.”</p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>“Y’know,” Mary offered, spinning round and around and around in the chair from which she would be providing the main commentary, “if you think about it, this is actually a really great way to get your toes wet.”</p><p>Remus dug his fists into his pockets, then remembered himself and pulled his hands back out before he could put any wrinkles in his trousers. “Because you’re throwing me right in the deep end by having me report on a sport I still do not even remotely understand?”</p><p>“Because nobody here cares about college football, <em>actually</em>.”</p><p>“Excuse me, Miss Macdonald, but I seem to recall your father busting both his TV remote and his living room wall when his alma mater lost their… Iron bowl, was it?”</p><p>“See, that’s because my dad’s from Alabama, Mr. Lupin.” Mary finally stopped her spinning to face him properly. “College ball is a major part of daily life in the South. My cousin Cathy had her wedding on the day of an Auburn game and I swear to you, half the banquet hall was empty because the guests were watching the game at the bar. Now, if we were at a school with that kinda culture, I’d say you oughta be shitting your pants.”</p><p>“If we were at a school with that kinda culture, we wouldn’t ever be able to cover a game at all,” Lily offered, not even looking up from her ever-present clipboard. “Because we don’t have that kinda money.”</p><p>“Oh, for sure!” Mary agreed, nodding eagerly. “But we’re so fucking far from being that kind of school it’s not even funny. See, people round here do not invest themselves in our rinky dink, little football team.”</p><p>“Rinky dink?” Remus demanded, hit by a sudden surge of school pride. “There’s gonna be at least a thousand people out there, that’s not to be sneezed at, I don’t think.”</p><p>“A Tigers game gets at least <em>eighty-</em>thousand, easy.”</p><p>“Eighty-thousand!” Remus blinked, briefly gaped. “That’s like…. That’s a final match at the Millennium. And you mean to tell me they manage that every game?" </p><p>“That’s exactly what I’m telling you. When you have a picture in your head of screaming football mania, you’re thinking of Bowl Subdivision teams in the rural South or you’re thinking of the NFL. This is neither. We’re a Division Three school whose women’s soccer team carries the entire athletic program on their backs. We’re small potatoes, Remus, and that’s <em>great!</em> Low stakes! Hardly something to get yourself in a tizzy over, right?”</p><p>“Small potatoes,” Remus muttered, trying it out for a mantra.</p><p>Out the corner of his eye, Remus noticed Lily <em>physically</em> bite down on the objection she surely wished to voice: that actually this was still a very big get and the whole Willow team should all be worshipping at their college president’s feet forevermore for strong-arming (without anyone realizing that they were being strong-armed, as was Dr. Dumbledore’s style) the Tristate Conference into rejecting any exclusive airing contracts so that school media could have this opportunity.</p><p>“Small potatoes,”he repeated, louder this time, rolling his shoulders to relieve the tightening in his muscles brought on by tension.</p>
<hr/><p>Fuck, it should have been Mary down here. It should have been Mary or Lily or Marlene or Dorcas or any of the beautiful, articulate, knowledgable, quick-witted women who were much better suited to being on-air talent. </p><p>But they were trying to be subversive, was the thing. They were trying to be subversive, so Mary would be up in the booth doing the play-by-play announcing— a much more useful application of her expertise, admittedly— along with Professor McGonagall from the Department of Engineering, who apparently played in a professional women’s league for a few years before going for her PhD and was thus eminently qualified to be their colour commentator.</p><p>They were being subversive, so instead of having a singular woman on the team who roved up and down the sidelines, talking for twenty seconds every half hour and generally acting as ornament to the main show, they would have a singular man doing the same— Remus being that man.</p><p>Fucking <em>Gilderoy</em>. Gilderoy was exactly the kind of man who ought to be ornament (and ideally never anything more than). Gilderoy with his perfectly generic, all-American good looks. Gilderoy with his tan, unscarred skin and his golden blondness and his sparkly blue eyes.</p><p>It didn’t really work when it was Remus. Remus wasn’t handsome like that. Remus was just skinny and tall-ish and white. And now his fucked up left eyebrow would be on display for the <em>whole world</em> to see.</p><p>“Small potatoes,” Remus reassured himself. “Small potatoes, low stakes.”</p><p>“I’m hungry too, bud!” his cameraman, Peter Pettigrew called out. “But it’s worth the wait. Just think: a few more hours and then we all up in that bloomin’ onion!”</p><p>Remus was saved from responding by Lily’s voice in his ear telling him he’d be on in five.</p><p>And so Remus put on his winningest smile, turned to face the camera, held his microphone up to his mouth, and waited for the ladies in the booth to ‘throw it down to Remus’ .</p><p>And then he felt something <b><em>slam</em></b> into his legs.</p><p>“Nefi wen!” (In later years, despite video evidence to the contrary, Remus would insist that the screech he let out at that moment of impact was actually quite manly, thank you very much.)</p><p>In that moment, however, Remus did not hear his own shout, nor the sympathetic groan from onlookers, nor Peter’s quiet squeak of surprise, nor the grunt from the someone— not something— who had crashed into him in the first place. Remus heard nothing but the pulse of his own heartbeat, saw nothing but a blur of purple and green give way to cloudless sky.</p><p>And then an angel. </p><p>“Are you all right?” The man kneeling over him was red-faced and heaving for breath, his hair disheveled and completely drenched with sweat, but surely someone so profoundly beautiful <em>had</em> to be an angel.</p><p>“Am I dead?” Remus asked, hoping to confirm this stranger’s celestial nature.</p><p>The man barked out a laugh, entirely opposite of the harp-song Remus would have expected from an angel but by no means unpleasant. “No, no, you are still gloriously alive, promise.”</p><p>Oh, so he wasn’t an angel, just an unfathomably handsome mortal being with a very posh accent. Remus blinked the daze out of his eyes. He came back into awareness, and he decided he had remained lying down on the cold, damp turf for longer than any hit would warrant. “Right,” he murmured, smiling sheepishly. “Always glad to hear that!”</p><p>He made to stand, accepting the helping hand Mr. Handsome immediately offered. “Quite sorry for bowling you over like that. I’m Sirius, by the way. My name, I mean. Not that I’m not <em>also</em> serious about being sorry, just that my name is Sirius. I’m Sirius with an ‘I’ like the star, as well as being serious the adjective.”</p><p>“It’s all right, Sirius. I’m Remus. Remus Lupin.” He offered the hand Sirius had just released to shake. Sirius enveloped it in both his own and pumped twice; Remus could feel the heat radiating from Sirius’ palms, even through the stretchy fabric of his football gloves.</p><p>“Black!” Sirius glanced over Remus’ shoulder, and Remus turned to see the football coach looking absolutely thunderous. “Get your ass over here or I’m popping off this leg and beating you with it!”</p><p>“Coming, Coach Moody!” Sirius grinned down at Remus, squeezing his hand before letting go. He stooped down to pick up his helmet and passed Remus the microphone that had fallen forgotten in the tumble. “Good to meet you, Remus Lupin.” </p><p>Remus couldn’t help but beam in response. “And you as well, Sirius Black.”</p><p>As Sirius jogged over to his team’s bench, Remus turned back to Peter— only to see the boy gesturing wildly at his own ear, camera still trained on Remus.</p><p>Eyes widening in surprise, Remus shoved the earpiece dangling from his neck back in, paying no heed to the blades of grass still stuck to it.</p><p>“<em>You’re still on. Wrap your segment up, go!</em>” Lily ordered.</p><p>“What a way to start your first day, eh, Remus!”</p><p>“I’d say so, Mary! It’s never a dull moment here at The Willow, that’s for certain.”</p><p>**</p><p>The rest of the telecast passed without incident, Remus only went back on camera for another two or so minutes, total. A good deal of that time was spent regurgitating injury reports provided by the teams themselves— those Durmstrang boys played <em>rough</em>— and approaching the game from a human interest side (which, if he was being frank, was more entertaining to him than the sport itself). </p><p>It wasn’t a terrible time.</p><p>“But that doesn’t mean I’m doing it again!”</p><p>“Yes, it does!” Lily exclaimed, sloshing her margarita in her eagerness to point at him. “You went viral. You’re the face of the channel. You’re locked in, now, Lupin!”</p><p>“Yeah!” Mary agreed. “We’re the dream team, now, Remus! You and me and Minnie McG!”</p><p>“I was pretty important too,” Peter piped in, breaking off a piece of his well-deserved bloomin’ onion.</p><p>“And the real MVP, our own Peter P!” At this, Lily raised a toast. “To Pete! For having both an unshakable shoulder, and unshakable commitment to his job filming the action!”</p><p>“Hear, hear!” The table cried out.</p><p>“Thank you, thank you!” Peter, fortified by Dutch courage, stood to bow. He then raised his cider bottle. “And to Benjy Fenwick, for your cat-like reflexes killing Remus’ mic <em>right</em> before it hit the ground and then <em>instantly</em> turning it back so we could all listen to him flirt with a hot football player!”</p><p>Remus’ objections were drowned out by more cheers and clinks. “We weren’t flirting,” he repeated when the noise died down.</p><p>Peter snorted in response. “Even if <em>you</em> weren’t flirting with <em>him</em>, he was tripping over himself trying to flirt with you.” He then started guffawing at his own word choice. “Tripping! Do you see what I did just then?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“I think it’s about time we lay off the booze for a bit, boyo.” Gently, Remus prised the bottle out of Peter’s hand and moved it out of his reach.</p><p>“The drunk is right!” Dorcas banged the copper mug of her drink against the table like a judge with a gavel. “You were both flirting, but that Sirius dude was flirting <em>hard</em>.”</p><p>Remus exhaled loudly through his nose, feeling the throb of a headache building at the base of his skull. Was he the only one here who knew how to handle his liquor? “He was being kind because he felt guilty for accidentally tackling an innocent bystander. He’s probably straight.”</p><p>Emmeline Vance— linguistics and psychology double major, junior, and Willow social media manager— looked up from her phone with an arched eyebrow. “You sure about that?” She asked, turning the phone around to wave the screen at him. “Because he literally just asked you out.”</p><p>“What?” Remus reached across the table for the phone, only for Dorcas to snatch it first.</p><p>“Oooh,” Dorcas trilled. “He wants to buy you a <em>drink</em>.”</p><p>“Let me see,” he demanded, even as she passed it along to Mary.</p><p>“So <em>publicly</em> too! He’s a bold one, Remus.”</p><p>“That’s so great,” Peter said, nodding sagely. “Remus needs that in his life.”</p><p>Like clucking hens, they all started in on a discussion of the qualities of Remus’ perfect other half. With a sigh, Remus pulled out his own phone. He’d been bombarded by so many alerts, the thing could barely open Twitter. Luckily, Sirius was right at the top of his notifications.</p><p>
