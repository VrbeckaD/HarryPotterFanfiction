    <p>The Master At Work</p><p> </p><p>Chapter 1</p><p> </p><p>    It had been fifteen minutes since Hermione Jean Granger had locked into a spot on the front wall of her potions classroom. She had obtained the appropriate color for her blood replenishing potion - which the board read was all they should do for the day - and placed it under stasis before zoning out entirely. From his desk in the front of the very same room, Severus Snape had started to play a little game with himself. It was simple, to most it would appear tedious, but he only became more enthralled with his time wasting method the longer it went on.</p><p>    <em> One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. </em></p><p><em>     </em>Miss Granger blinked.</p><p>    <em> One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. </em></p><p><em>     </em>Her lashes fluttered up and down once more.</p><p>    <em> One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. </em></p><p><em>     </em>She kept the meticulous pattern going for the last stretch of his seventh year potions class. Similar to the method in which she had pushed her food around her plate at each meal in the great hall, Hermione meticulously maintained her pace. Every count was precise, perfected and produced for the sole purpose of blending in to her surroundings. While the students that hustled through the halls of Hogwarts School Of Witchcraft and Wizardry were no longer as innocent and carefree as those that came in the years before them, each one of them seemed to be having an easier time molding themselves back into the role of student than the girl in front of him.</p><p>    “Miss Granger,” Snape spoke up over the shuffling of students and supplies as class time came to an end. “You shall stay to complete your potion. I am sure you do not need my instruction.”</p><p>    Her neck snapped from it’s fixed place to focus on him, and Severus could feel the ache in his own aging muscles. Hermione gave him an equally curt nod, and retrieved her wand to pull her cauldron out of stasis. “Yes, Professor.”</p><p>    She did not hesitate.</p><p>    She did not gape or protesting the inequality of his instruction.</p><p>She did not demand answers, movies or explanations to earn her usually costly cooperation.</p><p>The unrelenting, know-it-all, Potter’s-personal-puttering-pocketguide so easily relented, demanded no clarification and was at last - from where Severus Snape stood, Harry Potter free. Hermione Granger had made it through the first potions class of her academic career without raising her hand to wave it about like a taunting phrase in a school corridor. Far too distracting to block out but obnoxious to engage with. As it was, Severus had long since decided that the highly intelligent, bushy haired, brains over beauty witch had always demonstrated great potential. Attention to detail, desire to learn and a fair amount of endurance could get a witch or wizard quite far in the two <em> occupations </em>that Severus deemed himself qualified to teach. Both served as a method to establish a great deal of control over one's domain, provided thousands of hours of stimulating reading material and could give those struggling with where to place themselves in the magical world a perfect pocket of unquestionable purpose.</p><p>It was that very potential, he would tell himself in the years that followed, that led him to take an interest in the member of the golden trio. And until his dying day, he would be unsure if that was a lie.</p><p>Across the room, Hermione continued stirring the final ingredients into her brew. Much like how she shuffled her meals around her plate, the movements she used were well contained and calculated. She’d never been a student he worried about sloshing solutions about her workspace, and that day was no exception. His gaze remained fixed on her work, pleased when she completed the last several steps and settled back in her chair for the hour long wait until the potion would be complete. Immediately, she found her previous spot on the front wall and returned to her meticulously timed blinking.</p><p>“Miss Granger, what do you intend to do after graduation?” He asked, direct and to the point.</p><p>Once more, she turned her attention to him without hesitation. “I haven’t decided, Professor.”</p><p><em> Good. </em> He pretended to consider that for a moment, reclining back in his leather chair. “What are you considering? Perhaps a career in-” <em> Something she wouldn't be able to stand… </em>“-divination? Even those as untalented as yourself are permitted to sort prophecies or maintain records. On a secretarial level, of course.”</p><p>To his surprise, she did not revolt. “Of course,” The girl nodded in agreement, letting his words pass through her without appearing to have been disturbed by their intrusion. “I must confess, Professor, that up until now I had not given my career prospects much thought. With all that was happening they seemed quite unimportant. Perhaps even overly optimistic.”</p><p>It was all as he had figured, and he prepared himself for the speech he had given only a select few students over his teaching career. While he pondered where to begin with this particular  prospective potions apprentice, he studied her. Her mouth twitched on the seven count, her blinks remained timed on the ten and on the twenty-six mark, she pulled down her right sleeve with her left hand. The seam of her robe that intended to rest on her shoulder had been pulled half way down her upper arm creating a slouchy, sloppy and all around careless appearance that did not reflect her desperate grasp for control.</p><p><em> Unless… </em> Snape considered for a moment, hesitant to think such a thing. Instead, he stood and crossed the room, watching the girl flinch when he approached her too rapidly and making an effort to slow his pace. Without asking, grabbing her around the wrist before she could tug out of his reach, he yanked the fabric up above her elbow and turned her wrist to face the ceiling. <em> Bloody hell. </em></p><p>Written in a lazy script he had been unfortunately familiar with was a slur he never wished to hear again. “Mudblood…” He whispered, unaware that he had said it aloud. The edges of Bellatrix LeStrange’s carving were still fresh, bleeding as if they were hours old instead of months. Severus ran his finger tips over the sliced skin, and the girl winced at the pull against the tender cursed flesh. But it was not the long rumored mark that furrowed his dark brow, pursed his lips out of visibility and brought a red hue to his line of vision. That was accomplished by the hundred self inflicted slices through the girl’s nearly translucent skin, all in various stages of bleeding, sealing, scabbing, being picked at, scabbing over a second time and finally settling in to thick jagged scars that marked her alabaster skin.</p><p>“Professor, I-” The words caught in her throat and he held up a hand to suggest her silence.</p><p>His fingers unclenched eventually and he stepped back, opting to rub one temple until he could resist the urge to scream. Snape exerted more control than it had taken to occlude from The Dark Lord simply to unhinge his locked jaw. “Miss Granger, stand.”</p><p>Hesitantly, fiddling with the fingers on her other hand, the girl raised from her stool and looked at the worn potions counters to avoid his gaze.</p><p>“I need you to look at me, Miss Granger.” His voice remained steady despite the nervous thrumming in his chest. “Are there more?” A light bobbing of her head confirmed what he feared and Severus held the curse words back despite their temptation to leave his tongue. “I need you to remove your robes.”</p><p>Large brown eyes met his, and they were filled with tears, but she obeyed. The girl shrugged from her uniform, folded it meticulously and placed it on the stool she’d chosen for class. When she straightened herself, Severus took in the girl. Both arms, up to and likely past the elbow length sleeves of her uniform blouse, were carved nearly beyond recognition.</p><p>For the second time he asked. “Are there more?” And once again, she nodded. “Alright, Miss Granger. I need you to remove your blouse, skirt and hosiery. It is imperative that I know the extent of the damage, unless you wish to bring this information to Madam Pomfrey’s attention.” Snape kicked himself as soon as the words came out more of a threat than the genuine offer that he had intended.</p><p>Streaks cascaded down her cheeks and she took her time, pushing each button back through its hole until her blouse was open, revealing a similarly marred navel region, chest and ribcage. The button down fell from her shoulders and she folded it just as delicately as she had handled her robes before her shaking hands found the zipper on the side of her skirt. Hermione stepped out of her skirt, and pulled her black tights off as well, turning them right side out as a manner of buying time while Severus studied her undergarment-clad form. Only the unreachable or impossible to cover regions of her form had been spared from the blade.</p><p>Snape resolved not to make a fool out of either of them by asking why. By the flush brought to her hollow cheeks, he knew very well her reasons. “I am assuming by the sheer number of marks you have that this is a daily occurrence.” He stated, intentionally forming a statement instead of a question. She did not correct him. Any instrument a student had at their disposal to inflict such damage was not properly sterilized and his own skin crawled with the thought of what bacteria lived within her wounds waiting to become a deadly infection. Walking to his cabinet instead of summoning the brew, giving himself a minute to regain his composure, Severus Snape fetched a selection of vials before returning to her station. He uncapped them, poured each into a goblet for a final combination and outstretched his arm to where the girl stood</p><p>“Drink.”</p><p>Without question, she downed the cup of potions and handed the vessel back to him. She did not wince at the bitter flavor and left a drip of the potion trailing down her mouth for moment.</p><p>“You may wipe your face, Miss Granger.” Severus offered and she gave him a grateful look before brushing the mess off with her thumb. They stood in silence, her gaze fixed on the table top and his on her mutilated body. Several times, he nearly found the words, before losing them and having to start again. On two sides of a war, his instincts and his good sense fought one another.</p><p>
  <em> She needs this. </em>
</p><p>
  <b> <em>Oh you’d love if she did, you bloody pervert.</em> </b>
</p><p>
  <em> It’s not about me. </em>
</p><p>
  <b> <em>You make everything about you, you selfish prick.</em> </b>
</p><p>
  <em> The girl has lost control of the situation. </em>
</p><p>
  <b> <em>Why should she give that control to you?</em> </b>
</p><p>
  <em> There is no other choice. </em>
</p><p>
  <b> <em>They always have a choice.</em> </b>
</p><p>
  <em> Not if she wishes to live. </em>
</p><p>
  <b> <em>At least, we can agree on.</em> </b>
</p><p>Snape cleared his throat, breaking the stretching silence. “This needs to stop, Miss Granger. I’m sure you know that.”</p><p>“Yes, Professor. I do know.” By the look on her face, both ashamed and exhausted, the girl had known for some time. “I have tried.”</p><p><em> And failed. </em>He finished her admission. “Are you punishing yourself or are you releasing torment you don’t believe you can contain?”</p><p>Miss Granger pulled her bottom lip between her teeth and bit down, thankfully not hard enough to draw blood. “Both, I believe, Professor. At different times. Often one turns into the other.”</p><p>“Do you have any reasons or intentions, today, to inflict harm upon your person?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>He nodded along with her. “I appreciate your honesty in these matters, Miss Granger. May I ask which one it is today?”</p><p>This time, she hesitated. Her mouth opened, revealing her now only slightly oversized front teeth, shut as a puzzled look crossed her face and opened once more. “A punishment, Professor.”</p><p>Severus let out a long breath. “Do you find yourself feeling <em> absolved </em> when you punish yourself, Miss Granger?”</p><p>She winced, then shook her head as he expected her to do. “No, Professor.”</p><p>“Then I am quite sure you realize that your system is not working, but you are unsure how to replace it.” Severus set down the cup he had been holding, circled the table to her side and reminded himself that he already damned to eternal torment, no matter how he chose to proceed. But her soul - despite the marks received from her own defacement - could still be saved. And as much as he told himself that he wished someone else could do that for her, he was at least marginally thrilled at the prospect of offering her what he had long since decided was the most honorable form of salvation. “I ask, Miss Granger, if you would consider a less orthodox solution to this problem of yours. Though, I must selfishly admit, it would solve one of my own current predicaments.”</p><p>“What do you mean, Professor?” Hermione’s voice shook and he cursed the tug against the fabric of his trousers. “What predicament?”</p><p>He reached a hand out to her, brushing his fingertips over her carved flesh. “There are those of us with <em> inclinations </em>that deviate from the typical desires of witches and wizards. For example, I enjoy providing witches with discipline as well as an avenue for those witches to find relief from their need to control. This is something I would be willing and quite interested in providing you, Miss Granger. And as it appears, you are in need of absolution.”</p><p>Tears returning with full force, her previously hesitant breaths grew heavier. “What will happen if I deny you, Professor?”</p><p>The wizard would not fain hurt at her fearful inquiry that implied he was some type of predatory monster. Though he had never planned before that day to proposition a student, there he was with a nearly naked Gryffindor in his classroom. “The same thing that would happen should you agree and this does not remedy the situation,” He bored his eyes into hers, attempting to be reassuring while promising her nightmares. “I will have to obliviate you and turn information of your self harm in to the proper channels. In the past, I have reported these things to both the head of house and the infirmary, as well as to any guardians a student may have. Since you are an adult witch, only the former would apply. Both Professor McGonagall and Madam Pomfrey would treat the information with the utmost discretion while still doing what they must with it. You need not worry for your reputation or let it weigh your decision. Though it may come off as disappointment, I assure you that they will only be concerned for your wellbeing. Do you understand what I am telling you, Miss Granger?”</p><p>Her curls shook. “Not entirely.”</p><p>In a rare moment of tenderness, he took each of her soft hands in his own calloused mitts, giving what he hoped would be a reassuring squeeze. “I am telling you that you always have a choice in your own fate. The choices may not be as varied as you’d like, but they are yours. Should you choose to surrender some of that choice to me, I believe you would find it rewarding, but it is still your decision Miss Granger. Tell me now, what would you like to do? If only for today?”</p><p>Hermione’s throat twitched as she swallowed and for a moment he regretted the simple reality that his smile would <em> not </em>soothe the girl. Even with the utmost intended sincerity, it often displayed itself as a sneer. “What would you do to me, Professor? What… what would happen?”</p><p>
  <em> Thank Merlin… </em>
</p><p>
  <b> <em>Shut up, you disgusting pervert!</em> </b>
</p><p>“This first time, I would sit down in my chair then you would kneel at my feet and ask for punishment. You would answer my questions regarding why you required this punishment then I would place you over my lap, and strike you with my hand quite firmly.” It took great focus to keep his words strictly informational.</p><p>She flinched at the latter part of the sentence and pursed her own lips. “How many times, Professor? Would you hi- umm strike me, I mean...”</p><p>Severus dropped her hands gently, instead brushing a lock of hair out of her face and using his handkerchief to wipe the tears from her face. “As many times as is required. It varies between various offenses and individual witches. I suspect you did not receive corporal punishment growing up?”</p><p>“No, Professor.” Hermione answered and nodded her head. “I’d prefer that you to punish me than for you to tell anyone else. That is my decision.”</p><p>“Miss Granger, I must will you to understand that neither path you choose will be easy. Overcoming this affliction of yours will require work on yourself and great personal sacrifice.” He wished his words could be more reassuring than foreboding, but he would not lie to the young witch. “And this path - the path with me - will be painful. There will be times when you wonder how much more you can stand, and I will just be warming you up. As time passes, there are things I will ask of you that you must endure if you wish to maintain our arrangement. Things you never would have considered. Profound sacrifices of your body, mind and soul. Nothing I ask of you will be optional. It will be phrased as a demand, but make no mistake, you will retain the ability to be obliviated and pursue the alternate path. You shall consider every demand as the following question; ‘Is this task a price I am willing to pay to become the best version of myself?’ and you shall answer with your obedience. Do you still choose to proceed?”</p><p>A moment passed and she picked at the skin of her nail beds. “Ye- I choo- Umm I wish to proceed.”</p><p>
  <b> <em>Damn you! Run, you stupid chit!</em> </b>
</p><p>
  <em> Enjoy this. You’ve earned it. </em>
</p><p>Severus Snape lowered his voice, speaking with as much comforting authority as he could muster while still experiencing such shock and delight. “While we are alone you will call me Master and look me in the eyes, Miss Granger. I shall ask you again. Do you still wish to proceed?”</p><p>She slowly raised her chin, her lower lip trembling, until her doe eyes met his flat black. “I w-w-wish to p-p-p-proceed, Master.” </p><p>In response, he dipped his own head down, lifted her right hand to his lips and gave the back a light kiss. “Very well. Follow me.” His erection strained and struggled against his zipper as he brought her through the door from his classroom into his office. Snape pulled out his leather chair, transfigured it both non verbally and without his wand to shed its arm rests and sat himself down.</p><p>For a moment, the girl froze and he took a deep breath to remind himself to be patient. As he was sure her dentist muggle parents did not made demanding orders if they didn’t use corporal punishment while she was growing up, so nerves were to be expected. “Kneel.” Severus tried to make it sound like a gentle reminder.</p><p>“Right. I’m sorry.” She whispered, and climbed onto her knees on the floor between his legs. “Will you please do me the great honor of punishing me, Master?”</p><p>
  <em> I’ll give you the great honor of drowning in my cum if you aren’t careful, little witch. </em>
</p><p>
  <b> <em>Shut up! What is wrong with you?</em> </b>
</p><p>Snape cleared his throat. “What have you done to earn a punishment at my hand, Miss Granger?”</p><p>“I… well I… I survived the war while others did not and I still allow myself to be unhappy.” Hermione bit the inside of her cheek and let her eyes fall from his. “And my body is ugly, Master, because I covered it in marks.”</p><p>At her confession, he clenched his jaw shut to refrain from yelling. “Miss Granger, unless you are requesting to be <em> kicked </em> by my steel toe, dragon hide boots, then I suggest you look me in the eyes while you make this request. I would also recommend that you identify the proper reason you require punishment.”</p><p>When her flooded gaze met his own, she shook her head. “I don’t know the answer, Master.”</p><p>“Fine,” Snape growled. “This time I will tell you. You require punishment because you defaced the healthy body that has done nothing but serve you in all of your endeavours. You also will be punished for slandering your vessel. I find it quite beautiful, and as your master my word is law. You are also being punished because you are not caring for your mind by torturing yourself into being ashamed. After all that you’ve been through, it would be astonishing for you to not find yourself in emotional turmoil. Do you agree with these points, Miss Granger?”</p><p>She nodded slightly, red with shame like a chastised child.</p><p>“Alright, put yourself over my lap.” Severus leaned back as the young witch stretched over him. She was too light for his taste, and he suspected that had something to do with stirring her meals instead of eating them. He traced over her back, a blank canvas of unmarked alabaster, and envisioned where he may one day place his mark. The elastic band of her plain white knickers, which were standard uniform issue, and he eased a finger under the band on each side as he pulled it down to her knees. Her ass was the same beautiful smooth skin, save the tiny mole on her upper right side that he could not resist giving a gentle pinch. “I am going to strike you now, Miss Granger. I expect you to count along with me and properly thank me for each spanking. We will go until I feel you are adequately punished for such an egregious offense. Do you understand?”</p><p>“Yes Master.” She shook slightly, a fearful sob that she couldn’t stifle ripping through her chest.</p><p>He raised an eyebrow before continuing. “And are you still confident in your decision?”</p><p>This time, her voice did not waver. In fact, if Severus had not known any better, he would have believed she was serene. “Yes, Master.”</p><p>“Alright then. Let us get on with it.” Snape settled her down in the most stable spot and raised his right hand to just above his head before bringing it down with <em> thwack! </em>that echoed through the entire small chamber.</p><p>The witch whose body laid across his own yelped at the attack on her person, before gasping out a hesitant. “One. Thank you, Master.”</p><p>Again, he raised his hand and brought it down swiftly against her burning cheeks. <em> Thwack! </em></p><p>“Ahhmm.” Hermione yelled shyly into the crook of her arm. “Two. Thank you, Master.”</p><p>Three more brutal hits fell onto her tender reddening skin, covering the perky ass entirely so no spot was safe from his bruising assault. <em> Thwack! </em> He let out a breath, and shifted to readjust his nearly painful erection.</p><p>“Seven. Thank you, Master.” She responded, her throat raw with tears, and then Hermione lost her nerve. Much to his displeasure, she reached behind and placed her hands between his own and her tender bottom. “Please, Master, I can’t take this. It hurts.”</p><p>“Good.” Severus growled and yanked her hands out of the way, muttering an incantation that caused them to feel so heavy they pulled her arms towards the floor. “Punishments are <em> supposed </em>to be painful, Miss Granger. And you would do well never reach back like that ever again, do you understand? If I was using anything but my palm I could have broken every bone in your hands. There is as reason I’m striking your bottom. It’s fleshy,” He gripped a chunk of her sore muscle and gave it a squeeze. “and can take the impact. No matter what you’ve convinced yourself. Are you ready to proceed, Miss Granger? There will be no more breaks or interruptions.”</p><p>Hesitantly, she nodded and went limp with defeat. “Yes Master. I’m ready.”</p><p>
  <em> Thwack! </em>
</p><p>“Eight…”</p><p>
  <em> Thwack! </em>
</p><p>
  <em> “Fifteen…” </em>
</p><p>
  <em> THWACK!!! </em>
</p><p>“Twenty…”</p><p>They worked their way through up to twenty, and he delivered ten last brutal swats to her sit spot with no time for her to count or thank him. Her screams assaulted his inner ear and the spread of purple bruising across her bottom would not stop forming until the next day. His trousers were drenched with her mucus and tears that flowed down her face as she gasped for air.</p><p>“Breathe carefully, Miss Granger.” He warned, and summoned a small tub of oils from his desk drawer that he unscrewed the cap on and spread across her rump. “This should soothe you. If you’d like, I can give you a potion to quicken the healing process but that is entirely optional. I must say, it pleases me to see you like this. Spread across my lap and at my mercy…” Snape made quick work of the job, deciding that he would enjoy it much more slowly next time. She was far too tender. Instead he released her hands from their weighed bindings, shifted her body to straddle his own and <em> accioed </em>the blanket he kept folded on his guest chairs for the cold winter nights in the dungeons. Severus unfolded it and wrapped it around Hermione, rubbing her back and whispering soothing nothings into her ear while she shook with violent sobs.</p><p>“I… I hate myself. There were so many I didn’t save because I was too focused on my own needs.” She choked, wiping snot on the shoulder of his robes. “And now I’ve ruined your clothes. I can’t get anything right. I’m such a bloody fuck up.”</p><p>His hand traced more circles on her back and he brought us lips to her ears. “Hush now, Miss Granger, before you say something so cruel about yourself that I must punish you for that also.” Snape ignored her forgotten address, as he always did during the turmoil of aftercare, and rocked her gently. “Would it make you feel better if I told you how lovely you are to me when you cry?”</p><p>“Why?” She paused, unsure of his words, and he simply rubbed her back more firmly until she relented once more to her breathtaking tears. When he felt she could hold herself together without shattering into a mess on the floor, he pulled her a bit back away from him. Her red swollen eyes and cheeks were damp with never ending tears and her nose continued to run, which she wiped away with the handkerchief he didn’t remember putting in her possession.</p><p>“When you are vulnerable, you are submitting to me entirely and trusting me to fulfill your needs. You require pain and have entrusted me to deliver it.” Severus brushes her hair back with his hands and twisted it into a bun on top of her head that he secured with an incantation under his breath. “Submission is gorgeous and so are you. How do you feel now, Miss Granger? Do you believe this exercise was beneficial to you?”</p><p>Reluctantly, and much to his internal delight, Hermione nodded having only lowered her gaze for a moment before remembering to look him in the eyes. “I feel… better I think. Not good, my bum feels like it’s been treated to a dozen bludgers, but better than I did before.”</p><p>Severus pouted dramatically, pondering her admission. “Does that mean you wish to continue. Not today, since you need your rest, but tomorrow?”</p><p>“What-“ The young witch stuttered, her nose still stuffed shut. “What would I have to do tomorrow?”</p><p>“Such a smart girl…” He mused with admiration. Hermione Granger knew not to make any bargain without all possibly important information. “You would come to me following your last class of the day and kneel in my office until I am ready to receive you. Then, should you have a mental log of the offenses that you must repent for, you will confess them to me on your knees for which I will provide appropriate punishment. Once we have finished with your punishment and soothing, we will talk. The two of us will need to spend quite a lot of time talking, Miss Granger. Given all that, would you like to continue this tomorrow?”</p><p>“I would, Master.”</p><p>“Alright then.” Snape rocked her back and forth in his chair while she rested against him and whispered praises in her virgin ears. When her cries turned to soft breaths of sleep, he found his own spot on the far wall to fix his gaze. If Severus could play his cards correctly, the young witch could one day be his. </p>
