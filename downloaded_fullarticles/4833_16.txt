<hr/><p> </p><p>When I woke up I didn't recognize my surroundings; it was dark, almost too dark for me to see, but slowly my eyes adjusted. It seemed like I was in a box, there was a metal wall a foot or so above my head with paint flaking off. Towering to my left was a black bag and to my right another metal wall.</p><p> </p><p>That's when I noticed the god awful smell, it was a combination of horrific odors that seeped through my surroundings and became almost tangible. Gagging at the pungent smell of rotting milk that hit my nose I tried getting up so that I could get a better look at what I was dealing with.</p><p> </p><p>It took me a few moments but I realized that my body wasn't moving right. I could wiggle my fingers and maybe shake my limbs but moving my entire body eluded me. My head felt like a brick weighing me down and even trying to turn it was difficult.</p><p> </p><p>Breathing a bit heavily from struggling so much, I decided that calming down and thinking logically was more productive than just flailing around. Taking deep breaths (while trying to ignore the disgusting odors) I tried remembering what I was doing before I ended up in this predicament. I knew I had breakfast this morning . . . something with bread, toast? No, it was a bagel with strawberry jelly. I left my tiny apartment with a thermos of tea in my left hand and headed to work. Wait, did I lock my door? I think I did. What else? I know I put on my headphones and started walking on autopilot, I've walked the same route so many times that paying attention isn't really necessary. Then I . . . then I what? I can't remember; I know I walked for a while, people swarmed past me like usual and I remember listening to the soundtrack of one of my favorite movies but then . . . It goes blank.</p><p> </p><p>I could have been kidnapped; it's been known to happen in big cities and it would explain why my body's not responding. What drugs muddle the body's reactions but not the mind? I'm thinking clearly or at least I think I'm thinking clearly. Having never been drugged before except when I had my wisdom teeth pulled hampers my knowledge of how to recognize if I'm thinking clearly under the influence.</p><p> </p><p>Maybe my mind isn't working, I should be freaking out by now right? Being kidnapped is a scary thing but I'm being so calm about it, maybe I'm in shock? Then again, I've never been kidnapped before so this could be how I would normally react. Either way I need to get out of here.</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>Nothing worked; I've been here for hours (I think) and the drugs still haven't worn off. I tried rolling over and working slowly through the drugs by using small movements. Tried thinking of what I would do if my kidnappers came back, how I would pretend to be asleep and attempt to figure out my location. I even got desperate enough to try yelling for help but all that came out was weird garbled sounds.</p><p> </p><p>I've decided that all I can do is wait, which I've been doing for a very long time. I ignored my stomach growling, hoping that the hunger pains would go away. Then I decided that kidnapping is overrated because instead of being scared like most movies depict it, it's actually extremely boring. Maybe I'll just die of boredom and never find out what happened to me; then whatever the kidnappers planed for me would be ruined. I could proclaim dying a semi-heroic death and if not, at least I was a pain in the ass until the very end. My mom would be so proud.</p><p> </p><p>Then my world was shaken, literally; my container was moving and the metal wall above my face was opened. Fresh air rushed over me and it was the best moment of my life, I felt rejuvenated, I felt alive!</p><p> </p><p>That was until the light assaulted my eyes, then all I knew was pain. It felt like someone was gouging my eyes out with rusty old sporks. Tears immediately began to fall and I screamed. For a while I cried so hard that I forgot my surroundings; when I felt something pick me up I startled so badly that I stopped crying and started coughing.</p><p> </p><p>Stopping mid-scream made me choke; it felt like my lungs declared war against my body and decided being independent was a new life goal.</p><p> </p><p>Then something slammed into my back with enough force to knock the coughing and breath out of me. Trying to regain my breath was hard when whatever knocked it out continued to do so, the repetitive assault on my back was frightening but getting air back into my body was top priority.</p><p> </p><p>When I could breathe semi-normally again the beating upon my back stopped, which was a relief; I can just imagine the bruises littering my body. Squinting I tried to adjust my eyes to the new lighting, which was hard. I have no idea how long I was in that metal box but it was long enough to screw up my light perception. Which sucked, how long did it take for a person's eyes to adjust enough to not feel like hells fire descended upon their nerves?</p><p> </p><p>Feeling a shift below my butt was the only warning I had before I was flying once more, the sensation of falling or driving over hilly areas comes to mind. Then I saw a blob of dark brown; it was soft and made soothing, rumbling sounds. Blinking to help clear my eyes of tears and help them adapt to the lighting, my vision came into focus on human skin, specifically a neck. Turning my head as much as I was able allowed me to glimpse a patchwork of black scruffy hair scattered across a chin which led to a face and eventually to the sky.</p><p> </p><p>Now normally I try not to judge a person by their appearance but the man holding me was huge, and I mean HUGE. Like are-you-a-giant huge; he had to be strong because I wasn't some delicate flower, I'm a 27 year old woman who cooks pastries for a living and stereotypes exist for a reason.</p><p> </p><p>He carried me though an alleyway (or at least I think he did, all I can see is his face and above) and into a building with multiple levels. At first I thought he was one of my kidnappers and his hugeness was justified by the drugs still running through my system. That was until he walked up a few flights of stairs and opened a door which led into an airy living area with bright checkered furniture.</p><p> </p><p>It wasn't the furniture that convinced me but the child coloring in pictures with crayons that did, it also helped that a woman came in and immediately started to fuss over me. I had a headache the size of Russia and my stomach decided to remind me of my negligence. Feeling a shifting below me, my vision swam for a moment until instead of looking up and seeing a man I saw a woman. She started walking at a brisk pace toward another part of the room all the while yelling something over her shoulder. Clanking of metal objects reached my ears and the sound of suction releasing cold air rushed over me; the combination of all these new sensations was slightly overwhelming.</p><p> </p><p>After a few minutes of blurred colors and loud noises something was shoved into my face and forced into my mouth. At first I fought it, the idea of being drugged again did not appeal to me, but the force behind the action allowed some of the liquid to slip through and reach my tongue. Tasting it I realized the woman was feeding me milk and then my stomach decided my actions for me. I was sucking down the liquid before even realizing it and after a while I decided that if it was drugged then it wouldn't matter anyway. I was already incapacitated and fighting these people while unable to move was impossible, besides if they wanted to make me drink the milk concoction badly enough I wouldn't be able to do a thing to stop them.</p><p> </p><p>It took a while for me to realize but after finishing the milk and satisfying my hunger I noticed how the 'cup' I was drinking from was actually a baby bottle. Feeling slightly embarrassed it took me a few seconds to realize how big the bottle was. At first I was going to ignore it and leave it to the drugs but something was telling me that I was missing something.</p><p> </p><p>Looking up I noticed how my hands where grasping the bottle in an attempt to control its movements and then I noticed my hands. How weak they were, trying to hold something with no coordination; there was also the fact that they were small and pudgy. I know I'm a cuddly thing with lots of curves but my hands have never been that fluffy, even though my body's chubby my fingers have always been slender and long.</p><p> </p><p>The jostling of my body brought me out of my thoughts and into the present. With my hunger satisfied and my headache abated I was able to focus on my surroundings and the words being said. The woman above me leaned over until her face was closer to mine. She smiled but her eyes were sad and teary, reaching down she grabbed the bottle from my hands and whispered in a watery tone,</p><p> </p><p>"How could someone leave a baby in the dumpster, especially one as cute as you? You'll grow up to be a heartbreaker, I'm sure of it."</p><p> </p><p>. . .</p><p> </p><p>Oh Shit.</p>
