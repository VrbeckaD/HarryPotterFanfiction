    <p>Prologue</p><p>Even at 9 years old, Harry Potter knew something wasn’t quite right. The Dursley’s were horrible people. They beat him, starved him, neglected him; until now he never knew it was wrong of them. He often wondered what he had done wrong for him to lose his parents. Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon had said it was his fault they died in a car crash and got stuck with him.</p><p>For years, he thought his name was boy, it, or freak. Until he started primary school, then he couldn’t figure out why everyone called him Harry. Until Aunt Petunia beat him with a skillet and told him his name, while at school, was Harry. But at home it would only ever be freak, boy, or it.</p><p>Every night he dreamed. Fantastical beasts, magic, and people took up his every thought as he slept. He knew he was different, he could sense it, feel it even. All the times he made things happen was when he was frightened or scared, which happened way more than any 9-year-old should ever have to deal with.</p><p>During the day Harry cooked and he cleaned. He took out the trash, cleared the flower beds of weeds, in rain or shine, and made sure that the inside and outside walls, doors, and ceilings were touched up and not peeling from being exposed to the weather or natural aging.</p><p>He saw Vernon looking at him tonight after his dinner scotch. He didn’t know what that look meant, but he was more scared than he had ever been before. He had bent down to vacuum under the couch and had heard a noise escape from his uncle. He had a feeling something would happen that night. When he went to the kitchen to empty the vacuum, he grabbed a knife, smuggled it under his shirt and tucked it into his pants, careful not to let it cut him. It would be needed.</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>ATTEMPTED RAPE SCENE</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>Harry awoke with a cry and struggled to get away from the pain. “Shut up, freak” came a hiss from above him. Harry recognized the voice and berated himself for falling asleep. It was Uncle Vernon, the large man gripped Harry’s arm tightly, fingernails imbedded into the boy’s skin. It was then he realized the man was struggling to lower Harry’s pants, the fat man couldn’t get a grip as Harry struggled to get away. Harry kicked out at his uncle, connecting with the man’s groin. Vernon dropped Harry’s arm to grab at his crotch. Harry reached under his pillow to grab the knife. Holding it up, anger and rage darkened the normal emerald green eyes to jade.</p><p>“Don’t touch me” Harry yelled, he figured out what the man had been trying to do. Just because he was nine didn’t mean he didn’t know what sex was or what some men and women did to little boys and girls. He had heard the whispers at school, had heard the talks given by the grownups, what they should do but Harry knew if he screamed for help, no one would come to help him, Aunt Petunia would ignore it thinking Vernon was just beating the crap out him like normal and Dudley slept like the dead after pigging out on snacks before bed.</p><p>Vernon stopped grabbing himself, his face purple, with rage and pain. “I can do what I wish with you boy, this is my house.” The fat man lunged towards Harry. Harry closed his eyes and brought the knife up. His arm and hand jarred when the knife made a hard impact with Vernon’s arm.</p><p>There was a loud thump and screaming, when Harry opened his eyes. The knife was now lodged in the fat man’s flesh, in his upper arm. Harry could hear thudding above his head and knew his Aunt Petunia was coming to them after having heard her husband scream.</p><p>Petunia saw Harry’s pants had been lowered, she was disgusted with her husband, she had seen the looks and ignored them thinking Vernon would never attempt that and had shaken it off as if she had never seen it. “What were you thinking? Stay still” she screeched as she went to get the first aid kit.</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>END SCENE</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>She called an ambulance on her way back with the kit to put pressure on the wound. She forced her husband to stand and make his way to the kitchen. They had to make the first responders think it was an accident.</p><p>She returned and shut the door to the cupboard, locking it. “Go back to bed freak!”</p><p>“I’m sorry Petunia, I’m sorry” Vernon blubbered. “It was the freak’s fault, he must have made me want to do it.” Petunia said nothing to her husband just glared at him. “If I find out you have laid one hand on my Duddikins, I will castrate you. Don’t ever touch the boy that way again either, we are only being paid to keep him submissive and beaten down. If he is too broken and beaten, he won’t be any use to the old freak who wants him to go to that freakish school of his.”</p><p>Vernon assured his wife that he had never touched their son. That freak of high freaks paid them to beat on the freak he left with them; she even remembered him stressing not to touch him sexually. Petunia found herself wondering if that Dumbledore person knew her husband’s afflictions. Petunia vowed to herself to check with Dudley to verify it. Moments later she heard the ambulance pull up and went to open the door for the emergency response team. After they took Vernon to the hospital, Petunia went to check on her son, she felt lucky that her son was such a sound sleeper and had slept through it all. It was several hours before dawn and would need to make sure her and Dudley were at the hospital to see Vernon. She decided to catch a few hours of sleep first, she would need it to keep her head to deal with Vernon, the police, and the hospital in the morning. Petunia sighed and made her way back to her bed. She was out the moment her head hit the pillow.    </p>
