    <p>Harry was stuck with Neville as a potion’s partner this year, because Hermione felt Ron needed a little more guidance, and she felt Harry could handle Neville on his own. Well, Harry wasn’t amazing at potions but Neville was a disaster, Harry could only imagine what could go wrong, but he never imagined this.</p><p><em>What did I deserve to get this as a punishment?</em> Harry thought as Neville escorted him up to the Hospital Wing as he apologized over and over to Harry. Finally, Harry stopped and placed his slightly smaller hands on Neville’s shoulders. “Neville, please stop apologizing. There was nothing you could have done to stop this from happening. It was a small mistake that might just change my life forever. You grabbed the wrong ingredient and accidently put it in. No one knew this was going to happen. We can’t change it now, but we can hope Madam Pomfrey can. Just please stop apologizing.” Harry stated in his slightly higher voice.</p><p>Neville nodded, and Harry released him, and they continued on to the hospital wing. They stepped inside, and Madam Pomfrey hurried from her office. “What is it, Neville? What potion did you spill upon yourself this time?” she said, and then she noticed Harry for the first time. “And who is your friend, dear?” Harry just put his face in his hands and shook his head.</p><p>“It’s Harry, Madam Pomfrey; I, uh, spilled the potion on him. Professor Snape wanted me to give you this.” Neville said as he handed her a piece of parchment, and she took it and read it over and then looked up at Harry with wide eyes.</p><p>“This is not good, Mr. Potter. I don’t know if I can reverse this, but I will try.” Madam Pomfrey took Harry’s hand and pulled him down to the end of the room. “Mr. Longbottom, you may go, and please let Potter’s teachers know he won’t be returning to class or showing up today.” Neville bowed his head and walked out of the hospital wing.</p><p>“Madam Pomfrey, please tell me there may be a chance that this could wear off or you or someone can turn me back.”</p><p>“I am uncertain, Mr. Potter. We will just have to see. Those ingredients are hard to figure on if they will cooperate especially in the concentrations that they were in. If I do not figure it out today, I will owl some colleagues of mine that may be able to help. But I don’t want to give you any hope that this will be reversed, it might very well not be.”</p><p>“I figured that might be the answer.” Harry sat down on the bed in the private room Madam Pomfrey brought him to, and she started casting spells. Harry felt like he was there for hours when he heard the door open, and Madam Pomfrey turned slightly. “I’ll see what they need dear. I’ll be right back.” She hurried from the room, and Harry could hear her talking to someone, but he couldn’t make out the words.</p><p>Eventually, Madam Pomfrey walked back into the room, and she had Professor McGonagall with her. Harry groaned aloud as he placed his face in his hands and his now long hair fell in his face. Harry brushed it behind his ear quickly and looked up at the two women. “I’m stuck, aren’t I?” Harry questioned.</p><p>“For now, yes. We still don’t know how to reverse this, but Severus is working on something that may help. We don’t know if you will function like a normal 15 year old girl, but I feel that we may find out in time. I am going to take you to muggle London and then Dragon Alley for some new clothes in the meantime.”</p><p>“Can I bring Hermione?”</p><p>“Yes, Mr. Potter you may. I will fetch her now, and bring you some different clothes to change into for now.” McGonagall walked out of the room, and Harry sat there waiting for them to return. When they did, McGonagall handed Harry some of his clothes, and everyone stepped out of the room while he changed. Harry finished and he stepped out of the room to see McGonagall, Hermione, and Madam Pomfrey staring at him.</p><p>“What? Do I have something on my face?” Harry asked as he started wiping his face.</p><p>“No, Harry. It’s just you look a lot like your mother only with brown hair and your father’s nose.” McGonagall said, and Harry didn’t know how to respond to that. “Never mind, let’s go before the shops close.” McGonagall walked them over to the fireplace, and they stepped through to Madam Malkin’s Robe Shop. “Madam Malkin, would it be possible to get some new robes measured, please. This young lady here needs some robes.”</p><p>“Of course, Minerva. If the young lady could step up for me.” Harry stepped up onto the stool and scolded at McGonagall as he turned. <em>Young lady? Just because he was in a female body for now, didn’t mean he was a young lady.</em> Harry thought as Madam Malkin measured her and made a few uniforms for Harry. When they were finished, McGonagall walked them to Gringotts and took some money out of Harry’s account to turn into muggle money.</p><p>They then walked out of Dragon Alley and into Muggle London, and Hermione dragged them around to the best muggle shops. Their first stop was a shoe store, because Harry’s feet were much smaller than they normally were and his feet were flopping around in them, hurting his feet. They ended up getting a pair of dress shoes for his uniform, a pair of converse, a few pair of ballerina flats, and a low pair of heels. The next store that the went to were for bras, which Harry didn’t like at all, but after realizing what it did was fine with the contraption; they also bought some knickers there for him.</p><p>Next they stopped at a clothing store, where they bought him a hand full of blouses, a few button-ups, regular t-shirts and long sleeved shirts, and some jumpers. Then some skirts, jeans and dress pants along with some pajamas. When they were finished, Harry pulled on a pair on the black skinny jeans he bought, one of the skin tight t-shirts, and a pair of ballerina flats. Then they stopped at a barber, and Harry had his hair styled to make his hair more manageable, but he kept the length, because he liked it.</p><p>They went back to Hogwarts where McGonagall escorted Harry and Hermione up to the Gryffindor common room. McGonagall stopped Harry from going in, and said, “Potter, I wanted to inform you that your belongings were moved from the boys’ dorm to a private room in the tower if you wish me to show you.”</p><p>“Yes, that would be nice, Professor.” McGonagall walked into the room, and everyone immediately quieted. She continued through the room and to a spot in the wall Harry hadn’t noticed before, the wall opened up like a door, and they stepped inside and the door closed. The lights flickered on and Harry stood there in amazement staring at the room.</p><p>The room was about the size of the boy’s dormitory with one Queen sized bed in the middle. There were two doors off the room, and Harry walked over to the one door and found a bathroom, and in the other was a closet. “Thank you, Professor.” Harry said as he turned and hugged her.</p><p>“Dobby already moved your things into the closet as well as the things that we bought today. Your books are organized on the book shelf and your desk has your homework organized on it. I hope you enjoy the space, Mr. Potter. I guess we should call you Miss Potter for now. Good evening.” Harry nodded in return, and McGonagall walked out of the room and made an announcement to the rest of the Gryffindors about Harry’s condition. Harry pulled one of her new hair ties out of the package and pulled her hair back as Ron walked into the room and stopped dead staring at Harry.</p><p>Harry turned around and saw Ron was staring at her. “What? Why does everyone keep staring at me?” Harry look back and forth between Ron and Hermione. “Do I have something on my face, or on my clothes? What?”</p><p>“Harry, if you weren’t my best mate, I’d be all over you. You’re smoking hot, Harry.”</p><p>“What? No, I’m not.” Harry shook his head and walked out of the room with Ron and Hermione behind him. Harry shut the door and turned towards the rest of the common room, and everyone was staring at him. “Bloody hell! Stop staring at me, it just me. I’m the same bloody person i was this morning.” Harry stated and walked out of through the portrait hole. She headed down to the Great Hall, because dinner should be starting soon.</p><p>Harry reached the Great Hall and walked over to the Gryffindor table and turned to sit down and found the hall staring at her. Harry just rolled her eyes and sat down at the table, and she started eating without paying attention to anyone else. Harry finished eating just as Ron and Hermione sat down. Harry stood up and walked out of the hall and as she reached the door, she felt as if someone was burning a hole through her. She turned to find Malfoy staring at her. Harry shook her head and walked out of the room, and she was just starting to climb the staircase when she felt a hand wrap around her arm.</p><p>Harry turned to find Malfoy standing there, and she said, “Can I help you, Malfoy?”</p><p>“I might say you make a beautiful lady, Potter.”</p><p>“Yeah, what are they calling you now. Harmony?” Harry looked up to see Pansy Parkinson standing with her arms crossed leaning up against the wall.</p><p>“Pans, don’t.” Malfoy said as he gave her a look over his shoulder.</p><p>Harry pulled her arm out of Malfoy’s grasp, and he turned back towards Harry. “Whatever you are offering I’m not interested.” Harry started walking up the stairs, but Malfoy followed her. “Why are you still following me, Malfoy? I’m pretty sure the Slytherin common room is still in the dungeons.” Harry said without even looking back.</p><p>“Potter, can you stop walking and just talk to me?” Malfoy asked, and Harry stopped and quickly turned around whipping Malfoy in the face with her ponytail.</p><p>“Yes, Malfoy.” Harry said, and the sass just dribbled out of her mouth. Malfoy just stared at Harry with something that Harry couldn’t detect because she has never seen it in Malfoy's eyes before. “I’m waiting, Malfoy.”</p><p>“I forgot what I was going to say when you turned around and said my name like that.”</p><p>“In other words you are wasting my time.” Harry turned and continued walking, and he barely noticed the small crowd growing. Harry felt as Malfoy grab her arm, and he pulled her into one of the empty classrooms. “What the hell, Malfoy?” Harry squealed as Malfoy shut the door.</p><p>“Potter, I need to talk to you, and I’ve been trying to do it all year so far, and this just gives me the perfect opportunity, because most of the people outside this room probably think I’m trying to kiss you right now or something. I want you to know that I know he’s back. I’ve seen him, and I need to get my mother away from this. My father will follow the Dark Lord to his death, and I can’t follow him to my death. I’m a Slytherin for a reason: self-preservation.” Malfoy said as he backed Harry up against the teacher’s desk that was left in the room, and he lifted her up onto it and stepped between her legs.</p><p>“What are you doing, Malfoy? You do realize that this potion may wear off or they might find out what’s keeping me this way.” Malfoy started kissing the side of Harry’s neck. “Why now, Malfoy?” Harry panted, and her hands rested on Malfoy’s shoulders. “Merlin why does that feel so good? I’ve never been this sensitive.” Harry moaned, and Malfoy moved his lips up behind Harry’s ear.</p><p>“You’re a woman now, Potter. I can do things to you and make you feel things that you wouldn’t imagine in your wildest dreams.”</p><p>“Are you only acting this way around me because I’m now a woman? You’ve always acted like you despised me.” Harry moaned, and Malfoy traveled a little higher, catching the edge of Harry’s jaw. Harry threw her head back and moaned. “Merlin, what is everyone going to think, Malfoy?”</p><p>“Does it look like I care? Enjoy the moment and let go, Potter.” Malfoy said as the door banged open, and there stood Umbridge. Harry swore under her breath as Malfoy turned around, but stayed between Harry’s legs, resting his hands on the outsides of Harry’s legs. Harry kind of hid behind Malfoy, for she didn’t want to deal with Umbridge right now, and now that she was a she, she was shorter and Malfoy hid her pretty well as she stayed perched on the desk.</p><p>“Mr. Malfoy and Miss Potter, may I ask what you are doing in here?”</p><p>“We’re talking, Professor. I’m sorry if we were breaking any rules. I did not realize.” Malfoy covered, and Harry was very impressed.</p><p>“No, Mr. Malfoy you are not. Other students just found it strange that you dragged Miss Potter in here the way you did.”</p><p>“Ah, Miss Parkinson no doubt, but I assure you, Professor. Harry and I are just talking. I felt that our conversation didn’t need the eavesdropping of the entire school since I noticed a small crowd gathering. Miss Potter and I didn’t need the information to be spread.”</p><p>“And may I ask what you might have been talking about. I hope not her foolish nonsense about He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.”</p><p>“No, Professor, not at all. I was talking to Harry about the potion that caused his appearance. I just wanted to let her know that I’m on her side if she needs my help. Do you need anything else, Professor?”</p><p>“No, Mr. Malfoy. You and Miss Potter are free to go.” Professor Umbridge said as she walked towards the door.</p><p>“Thank you, Professor.” Malfoy said as he bowed slightly, and he turned towards Harry and took her hand, pulling her from the room. They followed Umbridge from the room, and they went in opposite directions. Malloy pulled Harry up the stairs, and Harry tried to ask questions, but Malloy wouldn’t answer any of her questions.</p><p>Finally, Harry pulled Malfoy to a stop, and she said, “Malfoy, I’m not moving until you tell me where we are going.”</p><p>Malfoy turned and pulled Harry into his arms, and he leaned in and whispered in her ear, “I’m finishing what I started earlier. Are you alright with that, Potter?” Malfoy then sucked Harry’s earlobe between his teeth. “Now are you coming or not?” Malfoy started walking away, and he pulled her along with him. This time she didn’t resist as he pulled her behind him. He reached a room and pulled Harry in behind him. He quickly shut the door, and cast a locking and silencing charm on the room. Harry walked over to the desk and propped herself up on it, and Malfoy walked up to her and placed his hand on her knees.</p><p>“Why now, Malfoy?” Harry asked as she placed her hands on the sides of Malfoy’s face.</p><p>“I’ve always had a thing for you, Harry. I’ve just never done anything about it, because I have an obligation to my family to produce heirs to our family. I’m bisexual, Harry, but it’s not alright when I have to produce heirs.”</p><p>“Are you saying you’ve always felt this way about me, Draco?” Harry said, and she emphasized Draco as she said it. Draco moaned, and he rested his forehead against Harry’s shoulder. “Draco?” Harry questioned, and Draco moaned again.</p><p>“Merlin, the way you say my first name. It’s intoxicating.” Draco turned towards the side and started nibbling on the side of Harry’s neck. Harry moaned, and resting her arms around Draco’s shoulders pulling him closer. Draco took a step forwards, and he gently pushed Harry back against the desk. Harry pulled Draco back with her and slipped her hand down from Draco’s shoulder to his waist. Draco’s hands slipped up Harry’s thigh and under her shirt, and he slipped her shirt off. “You make a gorgeous woman, Potter. Not that you weren’t a handsome man…” Draco whispered against Harry’s lips before he closed the rest of the distance between their lips.</p>
