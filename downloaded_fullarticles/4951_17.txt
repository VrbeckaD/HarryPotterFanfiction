    <p>I decided to write an alpha/omega story.  In this story, Newt is an alpha and Percival is an omega.  They don’t act like typical alphas and omegas.  For instance, Percival is the Director of Magical Security for MACUSA, a job that usually goes to alphas.  Percival is a strong, independent omega who has gained the trust and respect of all his aurors.  Newt is an alpha but he still calls himself “mum” to his creatures.  He is caring and nurturing, but he’s very protective of his creatures and will fight anyone who tries to harm them.</p><p>If not on suppressants, an omega will go into heat every three months.  An omega, male or female, can become pregnant during heat.  An omega’s heat will trigger an alpha’s rut.  A typical heat/rut will last 3-5 days.</p><p>Omegas have a scent gland located between their neck and right shoulder.  When in heat, they release a sweet scent.  Each omega has their own unique scent, which lures alphas to them.  If an alpha bites that spot during a heat, it is known as a mating mark.  The alpha has claimed the omega; a permanent bond will form between them.  The mating mark will never fade or be hidden by magic.</p><p>There is also something known as a “perfect match” or soulmates.  A perfect match is when two people are totally compatible: intellectually, emotionally, sexually, and magically.  An omega will realize the perfect match first.  When an omega sees their perfect match, their bodies will react accordingly.  Their heart rate speeds up and tiny shudders run through their bodies.  They will go into heat unexpectedly, regardless if they’re on suppressants.  The omega's heat will trigger the alpha's rut even if they are on suppressants too.  The alpha will be drawn to the omega and can’t bear the thought of not being with them.  At this time, they will mate and the alpha will bite the omega, bonding them forever.  Very few alphas are able to resist claiming their perfect match, but a few have been able to retain their rational minds and resist bonding them together.</p><p>During a rut, the alpha will maintain some coherence.  Their hormones will push them to lay a claim on a omega and breed them.  However, they will never willing hurt their omega, so if an omega doesn't want to bond, the alpha will resist their instincts and honor the omega's wishes.</p>
