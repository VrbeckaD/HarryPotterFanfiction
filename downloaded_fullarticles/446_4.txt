    <p>The Green light flashed. He heard System Malfunction. Critical! Then intrusion, multiple system malfunctions. Timelines are self destructing. Multiple system reboots. Critical system recovery activated. Multiple system intrusions. System Lockdown. Alpha Omega Security Separation activated. Instability at 60.7%, activating Wipe Protocol. 93.9% successful. Multiple system activations, starting Survival Protocol. Integration and Separation protocols successful.</p><p>Systems separated: Hero/Villanese, Master/Slave, Harem/Sluts, Harem/Gigolo II, Honor/Lord, and new Integrated System, done absorbing smaller systems. 

Seperation: Hero/Villanese the Americas. Master/Slave Central and South Africa, mixing and integrating in North Africa/Middle East with Harem/Sluts. Asia west and central to South, Harem/Sluts. East Asia, the Islands of the Pacific and South to Australia are are Honor/Lord. Harem/Gigolo II are scattered throughout other system areas. Europe has new Integrated system, starting absorption protocol. Stability of Integrated system 51.1%.</p><p>The asteroid hits, starting Humanoid advance. Small error .97%, not perfect coverage. Atlantis sinks. Larger error 2.001% due to fleeing system applicants. Magic in System, unstable, activating Blue Ball Protocol. Fall of the three lower period civilizations. Error less, 1.72%, magic stability increased, yet diversified to 89.2%. Integrated system now has absorbed Harem/Sluts and Master/Slave, Stability now 80.002%.</p><p>Five thousand to one thousand BC, integration, succeeding Hero/Villanese and Harem/Gigolo II successfully integrated. Error stable at .99999999999999999%; Magic now stable at 99.9999999999%. System Stability now at 90.0107%. Honor/Lord absorption taking longer than expected. Need genetic samples to increase future Stability as system slows to completion at time frame of intrusion. Circe, Aphrodite, and Hercules samples in stasis. Stability now 94.82%. Two of the five civilizations have now collapsed. The Americas, Asia and Europe/Middle East done.</p><p>Genetic samples of Merlin Emrys, Arthur Pendragon, Kristo Peverell, and Morgana Le Fay, successfully put into stasis. Rome falls, Hans stagnate, Japan isolates, Aztecs self-destruction, Incan stagnation. Magic still stable, at barely acceptable error (.0000000001%). System Stability now at 97.93%. Genetic samples of four founders: Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw, and Salazar Slytherin stable in stasis. Martial training of temple four:Lou Li, Mistress Zhao, Zhu Zan, and Master Zi successfully in stasis. Wars of 1600's cause increase in error to integration. Mechanical wars, again cause increase, after stability using Island and European Hierarchies of 1700 to 1905.</p><p>Approaching critical error time flow, using genetic samples to increase population and protective groups to prevent intrusion. The flow and boost to specified families, finished. Petunia Evans, half sister to Lily and Rose Evans. Daughters of Mark Evans. Lily and Rose daughters of genetic Rowena Ravenclaw and Arthur Pendragon. 

Daniel, Joseph, and Mary Granger, children of Howard Granger, squib son of famous potioneer Granger. Howards wife genetic Circe and Hercules. Dorea Black, daughter of genetic Aphrodite and Salazar Slytherin. Marries Charlus Potter. Son of Fleamont Potter and genetic Morgana Le Fay and Godric Gryffindor.</p><p>Su Li's family had left China when the British Empire, took it over. They had immigrated to their cousins, in Japan. Two of her four her grandparents were Genetic Lou Li and Mistress Zhao. Her twin sister, Mhu and her, as well as their parents and sisters picked up martial arts like someone learns to play and their parents came to Britain. Molly Prewett was of a female Prewitt and genetic Helga Hufflepuff, setting her on females dominate their husbands, but shower in Love their children.</p><p>Selene Lovegood had a genetic mother of Merlin Emrys and a distant Black. Alice Longbottom had a mother of Malfoy and a genetic hybrid (two females) father of Kristo Peverell and Aphrodite. 

Cho Chang's family fled China after the war that ended the Empire. Their family is royalist, period. Her, Shou, and Zhu's mother; Anly was the daughter of a genetic hybrid (two men) female of Zhu Zan and Master Zi marrying into the Changs. They knew martial arts, but were hand weapons prodigy.</p><p>Found errors, there are more non-human races and hybrids that before. Will work to stabilise them into the system. Some changes will have to take place as Family Magics are a larger issue in the finished absorption.</p><p>1980 approaches all the children and their siblings are born. Petunia and Lily get in an argument about her choice in lifestyle. Petunia uses her one curse/gift ability to make Lily frigid to anyone not her blood, but also a slut, to want children. This causes her to have twin girls October 17, 1981. Rose takes them for her, as she now hates James. Rose used her ability to cause Petunia to hate the bed she made, and her lifestyle, but not be able to change it.</p><p>Lily would have done something, but the system had 99.28% of the world having a single ability. Either emotional, mental, physical, or magical. The first errors left Dragons and Goblins. Following errors created the various races. Pixies, Veela, Merfolk, Naga, Neko, Rakaska, Lamia, Kitsune, weres (not cursed werewolves) or shape changers as they are called and a few others. The Dragonkin are now hybrid humanoids. 

Magic is still not believed. These things are called PSIonics, or genetic mutations. This is how the few non fixed observations come across as Bigfoot, Goblins, Nymphs, etc.</p><p>Lily was one of the 0.72%. The System worked for her. She was Rank two, level five. Otherwise known as midway to Rank three. Supposedly there are ten Ranks; plus Master level. To use your powers cost you points. Those points above your Rank are expended and not immediately given back the next day. 

So Rank two has one hundred permanent points, every day, that will not disappear. Her level five is fifty points. You only get those back 1-10 a day. It all depends on what you are doing. Sleeping and eating, or playing sports; bedroom or athletic matters. Depending on which of the subsystems you took at the start, you gain points using that system build. She had been building to get to Rank three, ever since she heard the prophecy.</p><p>She was worried, as well as pissed. The reason is that her generation was close to mixed, except the deaths are knocking back the numbers. Harry's generation though, only five boys she knows, but fifteen girls. 

Alice has two girls, a set of twins; Nellie and Sophia. Selene also has her two twins, Luna and Star. Greengrass had three girls, Rhonda, Daphne, and Astoria. 

Molly has three boys, William, Charles, and Buffy (Who calls their daughter that); and four girls, Glenda and Frieda, twins; Ronald, then Guinevere, just born. She had Harry and the two twin girls in her. Petunia had a boy, Dudley and girl, Daisy twins. 

Sirius's woman was pregnant with a girl, before she was killed. Andromeda had Nymphadora and Aphrodite, twin girls, both just barely four years older than Harry. Which seems to be the cut off.

1976 is the year it went from roughly fifty/fifty born, to thirty-five/sixty-five. More girls than boys. Maybe the Dark Lady is responsible.</p><p>Look at the Marauders. Sirius:boy, James:boy, Wormy:girl, and Remy:girl. The sex was almost fifty/fifty. Sirius and Remy being a couple for a while. The WWII is thirty/seventy because of the killing males. This war was more about killing females. The Dark Lady did not like competition. Reason after Severus heard the prophecy, he thought Lily would be killed, so he oathed himself. 


Lily thought, stupid of him, but he did not know, what Petunias sex curse/gift did to me. So Sophia and Nellie survive, Frank is raped into insanity, killing himself, before the meds-witch could take him. 

Alice in a Coma, supposedly from the pain curse... But something about that bothers me. James Dead, Sirius in Prison, Wormy Dead, Remy missing, crying that none of this should have happened. 

Harry missing. If only I had not stopped at the department to talk to new head, Croaker. Albus will die, if he does not tell me where my son is. Blackness. System has been compromised, activating ritual protocol.</p><p>Rose Marie (Potter) Brown, "widow", comes home from the park with Violet and Lavender to find Lily in a coma, her head covered in dried blood.  System stability at minimum acceptable range (.0[17 times]01%: Point nineteen zeros then 1). System Error, permanently stable at .0 [22 times]01%, and Magic stable at 99.9[13 times]9% And so we are past where the critical, outside intrusion happened::::</p><p>Ends Chapter One. All chapters will be less than 2,500 words, but more than five hundred. Believe it will be 50 to one hundred chapters.</p>
