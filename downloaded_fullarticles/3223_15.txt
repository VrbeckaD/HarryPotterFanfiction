    <p>
  <span>There are only a handful of subjects that are taught at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry each year, and with such minimal selection it is therefore usually customary to have two houses share a classroom simultaneously. This is of course prone to change for sixth-years and above, when students are able to select their subjects in reflection of their OWL results — this often concludes in the dropping of certain unimportant classes and attending only very few and allowing free-periods for studying on the important ones.</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span>As sixth-years, and as best of friends, Ginny Weasley and Luna Lovegood made sure to completely mimic each other's timetables so that they were never separated. This would allow them to not only collaborate with each other's work in class, but also to "study" together during their free-periods. Though as convenient as it might be that they shared classes, not every classroom was built sufficiently enough to mask their activities, ensuring that some subjects — like Double Potions on Friday's — were always going to be a bore.</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span>Charms of course would have been perfect: with all the vibe of activity that the students caused attempting to cast the spell of the day, no one would have noticed the two girls being mediocre at their work in the back. If not for the fact that they were forced to share the back-row with a few other students, they would totally get away with it; as it were, any questionable movements south of the border would be seen quite clearly and therefore the risk became too high.</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span>Transfiguration was an option, of course, but purely out of respect (and some may suggest fear) they agreed that they would not risk being found out by Professor McGonagall. Also, even the slightest hint of slacking off during class would be spotted, as McGonagall's reputation for being a hawk was pretty damned accurate.</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span>It seemed like they had only two classrooms where both furniture and lack-of workload were suitable targets for what they had planned. Divination, where they had already experimented in the past and knew for sure it could work, had become somewhat of a bore to them. They were seasoned experts, the immediate thrill had died away after going a month without the slightest indication of being caught, and now they were on the prowl to find a new playground.</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span>History of Magic was the other option — not only was there an abundance of leg room under the long tables, but the teacher up the front would almost always guarantee that no student would be in any state to interfere with their productivity. Professor Binns was well known throughout Hogwarts for two things: one was for being the only Ghost teacher in the school, and the other was for having the most monotonous tone known to mankind and which had the power to literally bore the pants off of you.</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span>In this instance, "literally" is the correct term to use — because whilst Professor Binns was going into great detail about twelfth century Goblins up the front, at the back of the class Ginny's panties were now lying at her feet, which were spread some distance apart, allowing for Luna's clever delicate fingers to access the small sensitive line of folds between her legs.</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span>Although no one were paying them the slightest bit of attention, Ginny felt it necessary to bite down hard on her lip in an attempt to keep in the smallest of murmurs, moans and inadvertent clicks that she generally made whilst on the verge of climaxing. The problem was that, being her best friend, Luna knew every single nook and cranny that set Ginny into overdrive, without even needing to look. So despite all her best efforts, despite biting down on her lip and clutching the table so hard to the point where her knuckles were white, the animalistic sounds still escaped her.</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span>Once she'd finished shuddering, Ginny looked up in alarm, her heart racing; but it skipped a beat instead when she realised Professor Binns was still hovering at the front of the class, his mouth moving, his lecture on Goblins seemed not to have derailed at any point. Furthermore, the other dozen or so students that had been forced to take History because their grades weren't good enough to get into an alternative subject, were indeed still very much oblivious to anything, some even seemed to have fallen asleep.</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span>As if their script had been written to perfection, the bell rang to end the lesson, making near on everyone in the room jump. Ginny looked sideways in relief at Luna, who characteristically had a dreamy look on her face and showed no real sign of having just pushed her friend over the edge. She went to resurface her hand in order to lick away the evidence when Ginny stopped her, and indicating with a shake of the head that she wait until the room was empty before they even considered moving.</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span>Though when she looked back up, she was surprised to find that practically everyone had already left — only Professor Binns remained, and even he exited through the blackboard before Ginny had time to blink.</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span>'Oh.'</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span>Ginny reached underneath the table to retrieve her panties before they left and Luna was still sucking on her fingers by the time they reached the end of the corridor and joined the rest of the school descending the spiral staircase for dinner.</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span>'I think it's safe to say that was a productive lesson, don't you?' Ginny asked her.</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span>'Not really,' Luna said bluntly, 'if you ask me, the Goblin rebellion in the thirteenth century was much more beneficial to them than the War in the twelfth — if anything that lesson was a waste of time.'</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span>Ginny sighed. 'Well yes, quite,' she said patiently, 'but I wasn't talking about the Goblin War. I meant what you were doing with... that!'</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span>She pointed to the hand in which fingers Luna was still licking, causing the blonde to survey them curiously.</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span>'What?'</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span>'Sufficient leg room, spacious and well hidden,' Ginny said, putting up her own hand to tick off the points with her fingers, 'fairly empty classroom, teacher is completely oblivious without fail and he almost always ensures that the other students fall asleep!</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span>'I mean, not one person even looked around or even indicated that they might have heard a sound,' Ginny continued, looking positively happy. 'It might take a couple more tests, to see how loud we can get, but seriously it looks very promising.'</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span>'A test?' Luna queried, her eyebrows raised, 'on what, the Goblin war? Did he say when?'</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span>'No,' Ginny started, rolling her eyes, 'I said— never mind.'</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span>They had arrived in the Entrance Hall, which was completely packed and flooding towards the Great Hall. The traffic was so dense that all the momentum that they had had descending the staircase stopped when they reached the middle of the hall, meaning they were stationary and Ginny didn't want to risk explaining to Luna that they would be repeating today's activities, in fear of being overheard.</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span>She was going over it in her head though.</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span>Their next lesson was Friday (it was Tuesday) and they had a couple of free periods in there somewhere for Ginny to go over it with Luna. If they could successfully repeat today's performance, perhaps with a bit more heat and up an octave higher in noise (and if Ginny does to Luna what Luna did to her today, that'd be no problem), then they may very well be ready to move onto the next big step.</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span>Eventually they were squeezed into the Great Hall and able to make their way to the Gryffindor table — which was rather deserted despite the amount of students pouring through the large oak doors. Ginny was able to spot her brother with his friends immediately and made a beeline for them, forgetting completely that Luna was in tow. It wasn't until she sat down and felt Luna slide in beside her that she freaked out.</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span>'Luna,' she hissed, Harry, Ron and Hermione had stopped their conversation upon their arrival, 'wrong table!'</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span>'Oh, right,' Luna's expression never changed, she simply stood up and wafted over to the other side of the room, finding a spot between two fellow sixth-years who shuffled away to avoid her as she reached for something to eat.</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span>Ginny sighed and turned to face the trio, but found only her brother staring back at her. Harry and Hermione had risen from the table and were looking anxiously at one another, and Ginny suddenly got the vibe that they might have been talking about her upon her arrival.</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span>'We have some Head Boy and Head Girl duties to attend too,' Hermione explained to Ginny, pointing to Harry and then herself, 'we'll see you two later.'</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span>Ron and Ginny watched them leave the Great Hall, and in quite the hurry too.</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span>'Is that their code for "we're going to go find an empty classroom to have sex in" now?' Ginny asked mockingly with a smirk as she reached for a Sheppard's pie that looked particularly inviting.</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span>Ron merely grinned and shook his head, continuing to eat his chicken leg without comment.</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span>'How did the research go?' Ron asked her after a long pause and he'd had time to swallow the chicken.</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span>'Flawlessly,' Ginny replied with a nod and a wink.</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span>'And so?' Ron put down his chicken, looking at her seriously, 'what does that mean?'</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span>Ginny took a bite of her pie, chewing and swallowing it slowly so as to pause for effect.</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span>'I think I need at least one more week,' she explained carefully, 'just to test out the tweaks — just so everything is covered.'</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span>Ron nodded and just stared at her for several minutes.</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span>Ginny had only taken a few bits of her Sheppard's pie before acknowledging that she wasn't very hungry. She thought about just leaving and heading to the common room when a strange yet curious thought occurred to her. Looking around cautiously, she snapped up a fork and deliberately dropped it onto the floor beneath the table, making not just Ron but quite a few others within earshot to look around curiously for the source of the noise.</span>
  <span></span><br/>
<span>'Whoops,' said Ginny sarcastically, biting her lip, 'I dropped my fork.'</span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>Everyone seemingly returned to eating their dinner — everyone except Ron, that is. He raised an eyebrow suspiciously as his little sister dove downwards to retrieve it. It was only by mere coincidence that, at the precise moment she disappeared, Ron looked down and noticed — if by magic — that his fly had suddenly been unzipped.</span>
