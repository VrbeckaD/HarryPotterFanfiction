    <p>Harry James Potter opened his eyes, and saw a storm.</p><p>Clouds so dark, that they could be part of the night sky, winds as wild as a dragon; and just as loud as the beast’s roar. The rain was heavy, cold, and stinging.</p><p>This storm was chaos as it’s fullest and he was in the middle of it.</p><p>He tried to move through it, but the wind pushed back, the rain made him shiver, and his teeth chatter. Thunder rumbled above, and lightening threatened to crack the world below. Despite it all, he kept moving.</p><p>He had to keep going, he must. Something tickled, urged him to fight forward, to shove through the chaos. Because there’s something, something that if found, the reward is beyond great.</p><p>A bolt of lightning brushed at the edge of his heels, the thunder shook the ground, and he stumbled; but just for a moment.</p><p>On and on he goes, pushing, and pushing. Searching and searching.</p><p>There!</p><p>Right there!</p><p>Fighting the storm, fighting his way to it, he gets closer and closer. Sometimes stumbling, but only for a moment, always for a moment. Then he’s there, standing in front of it.</p><p>It is a wondrous thing of hot and cold, a thing of beauty and ugliness, wrapped in comfort and pain. Dull greys that shined like a rainbow.  He feels both fear and courage, knows knowledge and naivety.</p><p>His body trembled before It, heart hammering in fear and anticipation, It waited. Waited for him to make the choice, bestowed upon him the power of choice. It does not ask if he’s strong enough for all that will come if he says yes, because It knows that he isn’t, that he’s strong because he isn’t, and that made him the One.</p><p>Only if he wanted it.</p><p>He reached out his hand, closed his eyes, and chose.</p><p>When Harry opened his eyes, he sees Truth.</p>
