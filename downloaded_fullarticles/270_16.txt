  <span>Harry had promised himself he wouldn’t come back to this place. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And yet, here he was - standing in front of an inconspicuous back door with no identifying markers, in a dingy alley in central London. The alleyway itself was dimly lit with rubbish littered about. There was a group of Muggles at the end, huddled around a fire, their greasy faces lit with delight as they passed around a bottle of whatever booze they’d managed to pilfer for the night. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A doorman opened the door after a single heavy-handed knock alerted him to Harry’s presence, and the gruff man allowed him in only when the sack of Galleons rested on his hip. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The hallway he was led through was wrought with Victorian Era drapery that wouldn’t have looked out of place in one of those Muggle vampire novels. They were thick and omnipresent, and smelled slightly of mothballs, though Harry had initially been surprised that such things even existed in the Wizarding World. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He went immediately to the bar where a curvaceous curly haired witch awaited him with a coy smirk on her lips. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Back again, Harry?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“ ‘Lo, Susan,” Harry nodded in greeting. “Business is still booming, I see?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She looked around the crowded room with a sly smile on her face. Her eyes were hard still. “It’s a new world, Harry. Sometimes I wish things were different. But everyone needs to escape somehow, and I can’t afford to turn down the coin.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She flipped her hair before sliding him his time card and tumbler of ale, her hips swishing languidly as she turned her attention to other patrons. He remembered her as a child, bright eyes and innocent. She hadn’t any steel in her blood then. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>War changed people that way, Harry supposed, and in this post-apocalyptic world you either adapted or you perished. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Susan was also right, Harry mused while looking around. Transfiguration bars were few and far between, only barely above legal, and the hottest commodity to come out of the third wizarding war. With over a third of the population being decimated, people clamored to these swanky joints for a little time with their lost loved ones. It was a bit disorienting at first, seeing the face of someone he knew was dead, up walking to and from the bar, grabbing drinks before returning to whatever hidden alcove they’d been paid to perform in. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It wasn’t a gentleman's club, not really. Sirens Song was a little slice of hell, dressed up as heaven. In this club, reality faded away until you stepped away from it’s doors. Harry took a glance at his time card, noting that he was scheduled for his usual two hour slot, in room C3 - a VIP-esque lounge on the topmost floor of the facility. This was where Susan had told him she placed her high-rollers. Whether they war-hardened heroes or criminals, she didn’t care so long as they played nice in the hallways and kept her till full of Galleons. He passed a very much animated Fred Weasley, who had perished in the Battle of Hogwarts, and knew that George was around here, somewhere. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry couldn’t stop the painful tug at seeing the copycat - for he also missed Fred terribly. But Fred’s ghost was not whom he came to see tonight. He paused at the door labeled C3 and took a steadying breath before inching a shaking hand towards the door handle and turning it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The room was lit by a single chandelier, casting rainbows across the furniture as well as the platform it was situated above. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry took his customary seat, not yet looking towards the center of the room, and took a long pull of his drink before finally, letting his eyes make their way upward towards the stage. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She was there, as always. Flaming red hair cascaded down her back as she danced around, slow and sensual - if not a bit stiff. Harry was always amazed at how the imposter copied her features down to the exact freckle, and how they’d managed to capture the honey tones in her otherwise spectacularly brown eyes. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Even the scar on her chin she’d received from a wayward bludger once, all there, all perfected. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She moved and swayed to a hypnotic beat and Harry was entranced. The imposter knew not to touch him, no. That would be crossing a line that Harry could not come back from, and so he watched, feeling the numbness of the alcohol he drank permeating his senses. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>After a while, the music stopped, and the Ginny imposter made their way to the seat next to him, sitting casually and turning to face him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I thought I wouldn’t see you again.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It was disconcerting, Harry thought, hearing a deep timbre coming through Ginny’s soft lips. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I wasn’t going to come back.” And then after a beat, “can I see </span>
  <em>
    <span>you, </span>
  </em>
  <span>please?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The imposter sighed, and withdrawing a long elm wand, waved it in a wide arch. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Slowly, red hair shortened and darkened to a coal black. Brown eyes faded into piercing blue. A soft jawline hardened and angled. Feminine curves melted into hard, masculine planes. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry’s quick intake of breath was his only response to the change. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He remembered the first time he’d stepped into this room. The first time he’d laid eyes on his new addiction. He’d asked a rather stupid question that left the imposter staring at him incredulously. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Why can’t you use Polyjuice instead?”</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“You can’t use it if they’re dead.”</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The man sitting before him had managed to captivate him in ways that were disturbing. Maybe because he was Harry’s only link to his lost love, or maybe because Theodore made him question his motives for coming here now, after so long, after the point where grieving should have lessened. Maybe it was both. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry just knew that Theo filled in the missing pieces of his soul, like a balm on burned skin, and Harry couldn’t stop no matter how hard he tried. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Theo observed him quietly, allowing the other man to make his adjustments before they continued on with the routine they’d developed over the last several months. Theo couldn’t deny that he was attracted to Potter. The man had changed drastically from his moralistic school days, and Theo was drawn to the darkened look in Potters startling green eyes. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>There was a depth there that Theo couldn’t escape. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So,” Harry said casually after a few minutes of their silent observations, “how are you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Small talk, Potter?” Theo let out a light laugh. “Really?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry shrugged. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I figured after the last time, you were done with this. With me.” There was a desperately hopeful tone to Theo's voice that made Harry ache to reassure him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The last time they’d been together had irrevocably changed the tone of their transactions. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“I don’t want to be someone else when I’m with you.” Theos lips brushed against his neck. Harry shivered. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“I can’t.”</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Things haven’t changed, really,” Harry admitted, and watched as Theo’s eyes dimmed slightly. “But I’ve found that it’s impossible to stay away from you anymore.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Blue eyes met green. Theo took a shuddering breath, taking Harry’s strong hands within his own and gripping them tightly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Then stop trying.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Fin.</span>
