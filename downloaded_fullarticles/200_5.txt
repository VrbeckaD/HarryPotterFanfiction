    <p>Newt stared at the ensemble of clothes left after shoving his sportswear into a sports bag. He considered each item and how likely it was he’d bother trying to wear them. Strewn across his bed was a pair of black trousers, a white collared shirt, a black sweater, a black pair of unshined shoes, a blue blazer and matching tie. The socks that accompanied the shoes were too plain and not as comfortable as he might have liked. He glanced at the fuzzy yellow socks peeking out of his open wardrobe. Maybe he could get away with switching out a pair of socks. He seized his socks and slipped them onto his feet. Much better, he thought to himself. There was absolutely no way he was wearing the tie that came with the uniform. He preferred bow ties to regular ties and besides, the one in front of him looked like it was made of wool or something else that itched. Everything else would do, he liked wearing a shirt under his sweaters. He shook free of his pajamas and threw each item of clothing, save the tie, on in flashes of white, black, and blue. He fixed his gingery hair by running a hand through it and declared himself presentable. Wrapped his hand simultaneously around the straps of his sports kit and backpack and hauled them onto his shoulders. He scanned the room to be sure he hadn’t forgotten anything and headed out. He took in a deep breath of the chilly September air and embarked on his first day of Year 10 in a state school. <br/>The first unpleasant event of the day began with boarding the city bus. Newt was used to the annoyances of public transportation but today everything was simply too loud. For whatever reason, someone found it suitable to bring along her crying baby for the morning commute. Then there was the impolite teenage boy playing a mobile game at full volume. And the icing on the cake was truly the man unabashedly swearing at his significant other over the phone. Newt found himself wishing that one or preferably all of them would be kicked off. He had no such luck. The swearing gentleman missed his stop by a few blocks but eventually disembarked, having ended the heated conversation with the person on the phone. The woman with the distraught baby left the bus with more wrinkles and less patience. Newt never saw the teenage boy get off the bus. Newt relaxed as his stop came into view. The school building itself was mildly underwhelming but that didn’t matter much. This was an opportunity to make friends and learn new things. Or at least that’s how Newt saw it. The first group of kids he saw were a little older than him. Newt figured they were a group of Year 12s. Nonetheless, Newt approached them. At first, he was struggling to find anything comprehendible to say. He laughed it off while they stared at him rather unamusedly. <br/>“Hello,” he said after a moment. None of them said anything back. “I’m Newt Scamander, and you are?” <br/>“Bugger off,” said a boy with chocolate brown hair and his tie hanging loosely around his neck. He stared at all of their uninterested faces for a moment before walking away. He didn’t take too much offense to his brief conversation with the band of Year 12s until he heard them snickering. His smile faltered for a moment but ultimately, he took a deep breath in and carried forward. It’ll be alright, Newt said to himself, there are other friends to be had. He talked to girls in the hallway about his collection of books on toads before his first class. The conversation was cut short by the girls giggling at his awkwardness and his cheeks turning a radish shade of red. He tried his best to pay attention in his first class but found himself distracted by bluebirds having a meeting on the windowsill. He wondered what birds talked about. He opened a notebook and began to write down his observations. Somehow, the teacher noticed Newt’s distractedness and requested to see him after class. This wasn’t how he’d hoped his first day would go. <br/>“You don’t find English particularly intriguing, Mr. Scamander,” his teacher said plainly. “Why’s that?” <br/>“There were bluebirds at the window,” Newt said. His teacher pushed her glasses up the bridge of her nose. “They were congregating there. I wonder what they were talking about.” <br/>His teacher shook her head. “Bluebirds don’t talk about anything.” <br/>“It would be dull if they sat at the window in silence, wouldn’t it?” <br/>With that, Newt scurried off to his second class, leaving his English teacher in silence. There weren’t any bluebirds at the window to distract him in his next class. The blinds were shut so his eyes were forced to focus on the plump figure teaching him math. Math had never been his favorite subject. After all, what more could you do with such complex numbers than speak to computers? It wasn’t soon enough when the class came to an end and his next class began. <br/>Lunch in any school with other kids is an odd affair. Where does one sit if they don’t have any friends? Newt was pondering this exact thing as he stared out into the labyrinth of benches in the cafeteria. There weren’t any discernible cliques as far as he could tell but everyone seemed equally unapproachable. Since not a single table was entirely empty, he had to make some sort of decision. How important was it who he sat with the first day anyway? He could probably switch tables everyday if he wanted. No one’s names were written on them. Newt decided to avoid the Year 12s and the girls from earlier. He wasn’t in the mood for more laughing at his expense. He darted out into the maze and took the first turn he saw, Without much thought, he sat down at the nearest table. No one said anything when he sat down. They were too invested in their own meals, their own lives, and their own conversations to acknowledge Newt existed. Newt thought it best to keep to himself and ate. <br/>When the bell rang at the end of the day, Newt found himself both relieved and disappointed. On one hand, classes were over until tomorrow. On the other, he hadn’t made any progress with anyone all day. Newt shrugged it off and figured he would find a friend tomorrow. Before Newt reached the bus stop at the end of the road, he noticed a flash of blue cross his vision. He dropped his backpack by a bush and followed the trail of small bird-like footprints in the dirt. He found them eventually in a tree. The bluebirds were in the middle of yet another meeting. Newt watched them intently, notebook in hand. They fluttered this way and that, not paying Newt any attention. Amongst his many books on animals, there was only one on birds. He’d only skimmed it once. What was the wingspan of bluebirds versus other types? What was the smallest wingspan a bird could have anyway? The birds chirped noisily around Newt as he followed them with his eyes. He alternated from bird to bird, watching as many of their movements as he could. A new noise interrupted his birdwatching. It sounded like laughing. Newt spun on his heels to get a look at the hyenas behind him. They weren’t actually hyenas, he realized. Their laughs were shrill, loud, and taunting like the creature Newt had read many books on. He’d never seen one in person. He recognized the one on the right immediately. Chocolate hair, loose tie, and a smug expression stained to his face that couldn’t be washed away with the strongest of detergents. His friend was another Year 12 with blonde hair that was sandy enough to be a beach. His lips were as loose as his friends tie. He didn’t stop talking. <br/>“Shut up, Matt,” said the chocolate haired boy. “You’re giving me a massive headache.” At that, the sandy blonde one,  Matt as Newt now knew him, sealed his lips. Newt turned to find his bird companions but they’d all flown away. “Talk to birds often?” <br/>Newt hesitated. He hadn’t said anything, had he? No, of course not. “No, I wasn’t-” <br/>“We should all be scared, Matt. We’ve got an escaped nutter on our hands,” the chocolate haired boy said as if Newt hasn’t opened his mouth. “Should’ve known though, what kind of boy with his head on straight wears girly socks?” <br/>“Socks can’t be girly,” said Newt indignantly. “They’re on my feet, aren’t they?” <br/>“Hm, I thought I heard somebody say something,” said Matt, with a hand cupped over his ear. “Must be hearing things.” <br/>“Yeah,” replied the chocolate haired boy. “It was just the ramblings of the boy who talks to birds. Don’t mind him.” <br/>Newt decided against validating that with a reply. He gave both of them a wide berth to retrieve his bookbag. Before he could catch his breath or grab his bag, the ground rose up to meet him. Or rather, someone tripped him and he fell onto his face. <br/>“Too busy thinking of a comeback to watch your feet, bird boy?” <br/>Newt didn’t bother mentioning how ridiculous that sounded. He pushed himself off the ground and ignored the snickering of the two Year 12s beside him. He shoved his notebook into his book bag and headed off to the bus stop. He pulled his phone from his pocket and opened his camera. He angled it towards his chin. Other than a scrape that would likely become a bruise come tomorrow, Newt was unscathed. He sighed and opened his blog and typed out a post on the bluebirds he studied that day. He didn’t have very many followers but he was a part of a group of people who studied animals amd shared their findings. His blog was full of facts, sketches, and photos he’d taken of all sorts of creatures. He’d never mention the Year 12s on that blog. Not that they’d ever find out, Newt went by his middle name online. His online friends knew him as artlessartemis, a rather meaningless username he’d created in Year 6, or simply as Artemis. Occasionally, someone would mistake him for a girl. New would politely correct them and go about his day. He closed out the application on his phone and slipped it back into his pocket. The bus had arrived. <br/>This time, Newt decided to sit at the back of the bus. It was mostly empty except someone wearing a large hoodie that concealed most of their face. A children’s fantasy book covered the rest. The person in the hoodie made no moves to talk to Newt and he didn’t make any moves to talk to them. Instead, he pulled out his notebook and jotted notes into the margins. The person in the hoodie exited the bus before did. Newt noted that it was a rather prestigious part of town. Humans confused Newt the most. Animals made sense. Humans didn’t. Why did those Year 12s refuse to be his friend? Why did those girls laugh at him? Why was birdwatching so bad for a boy to want to do? Why was that person hiding themselves? Maybe they’ve done something horrible, Newt thought. Or maybe...he didn’t know. The bus arrived at Newt’s stop and he got off the bus. Newt considered going home. There’d be too many questions. Or maybe his teacher called and his mother would go on another one of her talks, which ended with how much more she liked his brother Theseus than him. Or at least that’s how those talks felt. He swung a left and found himself somewhere new. Newt hadn’t ever been one for coffee but maybe a quiet coffee shop is what he needed. A bell chimed when he ended the pale blue doors of The Vanilla Bean. It’s name sounded like an ice cream parlor rather than a coffee shop. The warm smell of coffee and caramel melted the tension that Newt hadn’t realized had been building in his shoulders. He took a seat at a table with white stools and a large painting of a beach on the wall. Newt had never been to a beach. Someone behind the counter cleared their throat. <br/>“What can I get for ya?” said a rosy cheeked barista in an accent that struck Newt as particularly American. “Or did you come to sit?” <br/>“I’m not sure,” said Newt. The barista moved from behind the register to the table Newt was sat at. <br/>“I’d recommend the caramel macchiato,” she said casually. Newt nodded silently. “Hey, what’s up?” Newt didn’t say anything. “Hold that thought, I’ll get you some water.” Newt watched as the barista practically hopped over the counter, grabbed a glass, filled it from the tap then topped it off with ice. She didn’t jump back over the counter but rather walked carefully. She placed the glass in front of Newt. <br/>“You’re meant to put the ice in first,” Newt said, staring at the nearly overflowing glass of water. <br/>“There isn’t a wrong way to put water in a glass,” the barista said. “Anyway, what’s up buttercup?” <br/>Newt was mid-sip into his water and nearly spit it out laughing. He swallowed and wiped his lip with the back of his hand. <br/>“Buttercup?” he asked. <br/>“It’s a thing my mom used to say.” <br/>Newt nodded, noting that any future conversations they may have. <br/>“It was my first day at a state school,” said Newt after a minute. “I thought I’d make some friends but everyone else had other plans.” <br/>“Oh,” said the barista. “Well, I’m sure someone will be your pal. You seem like a nice kid. You feel free to come by anytime you like.” <br/>“Thanks.” <br/>“Don’t worry about those other kids,” said the barista. “Not everyone’s nice. Not at your age, not at mine either.” <br/>“Why’d you leave America?” asked Newt. <br/>“That’s a story for another day,” said the barista with a smile. “I think we should start with names. I’m Elizabeth, Beth for short. What’s yours?” <br/>“Newt Scamander.” <br/>Beth held in a laugh. “Newt Salamander. I’d love to meet your parents. They’ve got to be interesting people.” <br/>“I suppose they are,” said Newt. <br/>Beth returned to her place behind the counter. Newt stood up to leave. “See you again sometime soon, Salamander?” <br/>Newt shrugged and left the coffee shop a lot happier and having made an odd new friend.</p>
