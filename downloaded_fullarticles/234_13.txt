  <strong>July 8, 1994<strong></strong></strong>
</p><p>“Hello Alastor. I trust you are well?”</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>Mad-Eye Moody froze at the sound of a very familiar voice. He turned around slowly to find Albus Dumbledore standing before him, with Remus Lupin at his side.

</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>“Oh, fuck,” Moody grumbled. Moody lived in a small house near Durness, perched on a cliff overlooking a rocky shore below. He didn’t get a lot of visitors, and he liked it that way. His yard was overgrown, the roof in need of some repairs, but he enjoyed the quiet and relative seclusion that its location usually provided him.</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>“Aren’t you going to invite us inside?” Dumbledore asked with a smile, unaffected by Moody’s less-than-enthusiastic greeting.</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>A few moments later, the three men were sitting around Moody’s kitchen table. Dumbledore and Lupin had begrudgingly been offered drinks, while Moody had always preferred to just drink straight from his own flask.</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>“No offense, you two, but I’m sure you didn’t come just to shoot the shit. Spill.”</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>Dumbledore and Lupin exchanged a glance. “A lot has happened,” Albus began, “that we thought you should be made aware of. It turns out, we were mistaken about the events that led to the deaths of Lily and James all those years ago. Sirius Black did not betray the Potters. Instead, they had changed their Secret Keeper at the last moment to Peter Pettigrew, who happily turned them over. Sirius was framed, and spent over a decade in Azkaban for a crime he did not commit.”</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>Moody narrowed his eyes, shaking his head. “Pettigrew? That little rat-faced fuck. Should’ve known, something was always off with that one. How did you discover this exactly?”</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>Lupin jumped in. “Sirius recognized a photo of Pettigrew in his Animagus form in the newspaper, and came to Hogwarts to find him. Pettigrew was posing as a rat, the pet of a friend of Harry Potter’s. I was there when Sirius confronted Peter. I saw him alive, and he admitted to not only betraying James and Lily, but also to framing Sirius. Unfortunately, he managed to escape again before we could prove anything to the public.”</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>“Well, holy fucking shit.”</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>“Yes,” said Dumbledore. “That’s one way to put it. We believe Pettigrew is aiding Voldemort in hiding, and will be working to help bring him to power. This threat, I believe, is both imminent and inevitable. Unfortunately, our colleagues at the Ministry do not see it the same way.”</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>“Ohhh no, Dumbledore. I see right through you. You want me to go convince Fudge, right? Well, let me tell you, just because that blundering idiot is my boss at the Ministry doesn’t mean —”</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>“No, Alastor. I’m afraid I have a considerably larger favor to ask of you. I was rather hoping you’d be willing to come teach at Hogwarts. I can state with almost certainty from my past experience filling this position that it will only be for one year.”</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>“No fucking way.”</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>“You may have heard that Remus here was teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts until very recently.”</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>“No, I didn’t hear, Dumbledore. Don’t keep up with Hogwarts business, don’t have the time, and frankly, don’t care.”</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>“Unfortunately I’ve had to vacate the post,” Lupin explained with a sad smile. “There was an — incident — during a full moon —”</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>“Jesus Christ.”</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>“ — involving students.”</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>“Jesus <em>fucking</em> Christ.”</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>“Exactly.” Lupin looked back to Dumbledore.</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>“Alastor, I —”</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>“Let me stop you right there, Albus. I have no experience, or desire, to teach children. What made you even consider me?”</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>“Our Defense Against the Dark Arts program has floundered due to a lack of — continuity. I approached Remus a year ago at this time to make the same request of him. I trust both of you, and know firsthand how highly skilled you are. I fear our young people will be needing this type of training and education before very long. Remus did an excellent job in the classroom, giving our students plenty of hands-on experience that they had so sorely been lacking after our last several teachers. Now that he is unable to continue in this role, we thought of you.”</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>Moody grunted unintelligibly. Lupin took a deep breath. “We believe that Pettigrew intends to help Voldemort return. If this occurs, we’ll be reinstating the Order. We <em>need</em> you, Mad-Eye.”</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>“Well goddammit. What am I supposed to say to that?”</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>“Say you’ll join us and prepare to fight against Voldemort, should he return to power. Say you’ll help us ensure someone good continues what Remus started to train the youth at Hogwarts.”</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>“I guess I don’t really have a choice, do I?”</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>“We were certainly hoping that you will say yes.” Dumbledore’s eyes twinkled. The old man was quite used to getting his way.</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>“Hrumph… okay, fine.”</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>Lupin grinned.</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>“Wonderful, Alastor,” said Dumbledore. “I was also hoping you could provide some guidance about any new talent we should consider for the Order. As much as I don’t want to get ahead of ourselves, we need to be prepared, should the need arise. Remus and Sirius are ready to begin working behind the scenes to recruit and organize. I’ve already spoken with Minerva, Severus, and Hagrid, who are all on board, and Arthur and Molly Weasley are ready and willing to join us. We know you have worked extensively to identify and capture Death Eaters, and put them in Azkaban, and figure you may have colleagues who would be assets to our cause.”</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>Moody shook his head, but paused for a moment and seemed to really consider the question. Then he took a deep breath and spoke.</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>“Well, there’s Kingsley Shacklebolt. That’s definitely a bloke you want on our side. Incredibly talented, keeps his cool under pressure. And Nymphadora Tonks, the best I’ve ever trained. Smart as a whip — she’s accomplished more at twenty-one than most of the Aurors I’ve known have by the end of their careers.”</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>Dumbledore smiled and nodded. “Thank you, Alastor. Both excellent suggestions. I know Kingsley by reputation, and I’ve met him on a few occasions. I remember Nymphadora from her time at Hogwarts. I’ll make contact with both of them when the time is right.”</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>He stood, as if to leave, and Lupin followed his lead. “Well, I think Remus and I have kept you long enough. I’ll send for your trunks to be brought to Hogwarts when it’s time. I do appreciate your willingness” — Moody grumbled once again — “and we’ll be in touch.”</p><p>***</p><p>
  <strong>November 1, 1994<strong></strong></strong>
</p><p>Remus Lupin pulled the collar of his coat tighter around his shoulders as he walked down the sidewalk towards Hogsmeade. It was only early November, but already the temperatures had turned quite cool, the leaves mostly fallen from the trees. They were in for a cold winter ahead.</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>He pushed open the door to the Hog’s Head and scanned the extraordinarily dirty bar, until he spotted a familiar face sitting at a table in the corner, already sipping from a mug of beer.</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>Dumbledore smiled at him. “Remus. Thanks for coming.”</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>Lupin slid into the open seat. “No problem, Albus. What’s going on?”</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>Aberforth came over and brought another foaming mug of beer, slamming it down on the table, and Lupin jumped. “Uh, thanks,” he shrugged, raising the glass to his lips.</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>“Well,” Dumbledore began, “there’s been a strange development in the Triwizard Tournament. It appears this year we will have four champions competing. Harry’s name came out of the Goblet, after Cedric Diggory had already been announced as Hogwarts champion.”</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>“What?! But how? He’s underage!”</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>“How did Harry manage to even get his name in?”</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>“He didn’t. Someone else did.”</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>Lupin’s eyes widened. “Oh my <em>god</em>, Albus. What does this mean?”</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>“I don’t quite know yet myself. But something is happening, Remus, and I want us to be ready. We need to come up with a headquarters for meeting, should we need to start up again. We can’t keep meeting here. It’s not secure, and frankly, my brother is a terrible barkeep. But anyway, I was hoping you might be able to help me brainstorm some possible locations.”</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>Lupin cleared his throat. “Sirius had an idea about that actually when I last spoke to him. The house he grew up in is sitting empty, except for the family’s old house elf. It’s sat in disrepair for over a decade, so it would need some considerable cleaning up… but it could work, with certain protections put in place.”</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>Dumbledore nodded slowly. “Yes. That could work perfectly. Can you arrange for Sirius to meet us there one day, show me around?”</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>Lupin nodded. “I’ll talk to him and let you know. Have you started recruiting like we talked about?”</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>“Only those who were involved last time. I haven’t approached new recruits yet, although that’s the next stage. Once the house is ready for us, we should start with monthly dinner meetings, just so we’re ready to go should the need arise.”</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>“Okay,” Lupin agreed. “I’ll touch base with Sirius and get back to you by the end of the week.”</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>“Thank you, Remus. I’m afraid I have to get back to Hogwarts, but please, stay and finish your beer. Aberforth will take care of you. Talk to you soon.”</p><p>***</p><p>
  <strong>January 16, 1995<strong></strong></strong>
</p><p>Dumbledore arrived at the Tonks’ family home very late one evening. He gave the front door three short knocks, and waited patiently until Ted Tonks opened the door in his bathrobe. His eyes widened. “Holy… <em>Dumbledore?</em>” The man stood a bit dumbfounded on his own front step.</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>A moment later, his wife Andromeda appeared behind him, the same look of shock on her face. Her wild brown hair was pulled into a tight braid that reached halfway down her back, a shawl pulled around her shoulders. “Oh my goodness. Headmaster, please, won’t you come in?”</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>“Thank you. Andromeda. Ted. So sorry to bother you so late at night.”</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>“Is — is everything all right?”</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>“Yes. I believe so. I was hoping to have a word with your daughter, if she is home.”</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>Andromeda and Ted exchanged a look.</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>“Nymphadora?” Ted asked. “What do you need with her? She hasn’t been a student at Hogwarts for several years.”</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>“Yes, well I do rather enjoy checking in on my former students from time to time. I would love to catch up with her. I hear she is working for the Ministry these days.”</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>Ted looked even more confused. “You routinely check in on former students… at their homes… at eleven-thirty in the evening?”</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>“No, no, of course not. And again, I apologize for the intrusion at this hour. But Nymphadora did made quite an impression on me during her time at Hogwarts.”</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>“Yeah, I bet — for always causing trouble,” Ted muttered under his breath, and Andromeda smacked him on the arm.</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>Dumbledore chuckled. “Yes, well, Nymphadora always found amusing ways to use her abilities, now didn’t she? I’m sorry to be persistent, but is she home?”</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>Ted and Andromeda once again looked at each other. Andromeda shrugged. “I’ll go get her.”</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>A few minutes later, Andromeda returned, followed by a young witch with a shock of messy bright pink hair, wearing plaid flannel pants and a sweatshirt. Her eyes were wide, her mouth hanging open. “Professor?”</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>“Well, hello, Nymphadora.”</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>“Ummm… hi.”</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>“I understand it is quite late, but I was hoping you would join me for a short walk outside. It looked like there was a lake on this property? I’m sure it looks lovely in the moonlight.”</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>Tonks looked questioningly at her parents, who were just as bewildered as she was. “Uhh sure,” she said. “Let me just go, um —” she glanced down at her pajamas — “change real quick.”</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>She reappeared a few minutes later in a sweater, jeans, and boots, a scarf and coat in her hands. “Shall we?” Dumbledore asked with a smile.</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>As soon as they were outside, Tonks wrapped the scarf around her neck. The cold would have bothered her more if she wasn’t so curious about what Dumbledore was doing at her home. The two started walking under the full moon.</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>“Nymphadora,” Dumbledore began. She cringed at her full name, but bit her tongue, not quite ready yet to correct her former headmaster. “I’m here because you recently came up during a conversation I had with Alastor Moody.”</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>“Oh,” Tonks grinned at the name of her mentor.</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>“Moody had many kind words about you and the work you’ve done. I understand you trained under him for three years before becoming a full Auror last year?”</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>“Yes, that’s right,” she said proudly.“I have information to suggest that Voldemort is in hiding, gathering support and strength, and will attempt to rise once again. There is a small group of us who are starting to prepare.”</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>Tonks stopped dead in her tracks. “What?” she whispered. Dumbledore nodded seriously. “It’s true. I can explain more later… that is, if you’re willing to join us. During the last time Voldemort and the Death Eaters were at large, we formed a secret society called The Order of the Phoenix.”</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>“I’m familiar,” Tonks said, her heart pounding.</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>“Well, it’s a bit premature to officially start things up again. But, Alastor Moody will play a major role if it does come to that, and you came highly recommended. I wanted to come and speak to you myself, to see if you would be interested, should we need you.”</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>“Really?” Tonks breathed. “Holy shit. I mean... oops. Sorry, Professor.”</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>“Is that a yes?” Dumbledore asked, amused.</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>“Yes. Yes. Yes,” Tonks repeated, still in shock.</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>“Now Nymphadora —” </p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>“It’s Tonks, please, Professor. I hate my first name.”</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>“Ah. Very well then, Tonks. You need to realize that this will be very dangerous for you. I have already approached Kingsley Shacklebolt with the same proposition. You two would be invaluable to us in your role at the Ministry. Your affiliation with the Order in any way must remain a secret, or you could lose your job at the Ministry, or worse, become a target. Do you understand these risks?”</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>Tonks considered this. She had worked hard to get where she was — one of the youngest Aurors the Ministry had ever seen. She didn’t want to risk her career. But why had she become an Auror in the first place? To fight against everything Voldemort stood for. She had only been nine years old when he fell from power in 1981, so the idea of him returning was strange — like a boogeyman from her childhood dreams returning. But if the Ministry wasn’t the best place for her to fight… and Tonks knew about the Order. Those people were her inspiration for becoming an Auror. The chance to fight alongside them, to be one of them, should the chance arrive. “I understand. I’m in.”</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>Dumbledore smiled. “Excellent. We are going to start meeting for dinner once a month. I may ask some of you to start — helping — with a few things. I’ll fill you in about all of it at our first meeting. Next Tuesday night, if you’re available.”</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>“Yes, I am. Where?”</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>Dumbledore pulled out a scrap of paper and handed it to Tonks. “You can find the address here. Be sure not to lose that, and destroy it once you’re done. Dinner is at seven, but show up early and I’m sure someone will be around to give you a tour so you can get settled.”</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>“Okay.” Tonks took the paper from Dumbledore. “Do I need to bring anything, or do anything to prepare?”</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>“No, just bring yourself. I appreciate your enthusiasm, Nymph— I’m sorry— Tonks. I’ll see you soon.” He put his hand on her shoulder, and disappeared into the night.</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>Tonks stood there, looking up at the full moon, and squeezed her eyes shut tight. <em>Holy shit.</em> Did that just happen?</p><p>
  <strong>
