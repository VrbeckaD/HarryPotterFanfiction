    <p>Magnus Bane traced the lines deeply carved into the stone, recognising the symbol of the Deathly Hallows. If he remembered Bathilda Bagshot correctly, and to be honest that wasn’t a given, it had been carved here by Gellert Grindelwald in 1899. Fixed on the wall over a century later, it was another reminder to Magnus of the history of the place he found himself in: Durmstrang castle. Absent-mindedly he wondered why the carving was here, on the top floor of the castle, in a corridor that seemed mostly abandoned apart the bolted, black wooden door at the end.</p><p>Magnus sighed, scruffing a corner of his new black boots against the stone wall. He knew Professor McGonagall had gone to a lot of effort to get him into Durmstrang, and that the Wizengamot had been extremely lenient in scratching it from his record. Having turned 17 earlier that year, he’d been tried as an adult, and could have faced real time in Azkaban. Still, that didn’t stop him missing Hogwarts. He fingered the bright scarlet woollen robes his new guardians had placed him in, smiling a little at the bright colour, and imagining what his old potions partner would say at him in Gryffindor colours. </p><p><em>Raphael.</em> He’d miss him if no-one else. Perhaps Professor Flitwick would promote him to Ravenclaw prefect in his absence.</p><p>Magnus’ train of thought was interrupted by expansive system of bolts on the door, which began clunking as they were unlocked from the inside. After what seemed like an unnecessary amount of time, they came to a rest and the door was flung open by a middle-aged witch with wild red hair.</p><p>What she lacked in stature, she more than made up for in style, with spikey-heeled black boots, buckled up to the top of her calves, and a thick fur robe, strung over one shoulder by a leather strap, which augmented her small, compact frame.</p><p>Still, despite the almost impossible height of her boots (Magnus was quite sure they’d had at least a stability charm placed on them), she barely reached his height.</p><p>As she turned around to catch sight of Magnus, her dark lips, previously pursed stark against her pale skin, broadened into a surprisingly warm smile.</p><p>“Magnus Bane, I presume?” she asked, in flawless, unaccented English. Magnus nodded, and she stretched out a pale hand, nails painted to match her lips.</p><p>“Nadezhda Vulchanova, headmistress of the Durmstrang Institute. Minerva’s told me so much about you; please, do come in.” She wheeled around abruptly, allowing Magnus to follow her into an open, wooden-panelled room, which was dominated by a large desk.</p><p>Unlike Professor McGonagall’s desk, which seemed to have about six different filing systems, Vulchanova’s desk was piled with scrolls of parchment, which, as she waved her wand, returning to the leather chair behind, flew to various shelves on the right-hand wall.</p><p>Magnus scanned the room, noticing a large portrait of an older, red-haired witch behind the desk, whose dark lips were pursed in a familiar way as she eyed him, before realising the entire left wall was covered by a vast window, displaying a vast icy sea covered in haze. Down by the shore line Magnus could make out the sails of a large ship, whose white sails bore the scarlet double headed eagle of Durmstrang’s crest.</p><p>This was the first time Magnus had caught sight of Durmstrang’s surroundings, since the portkey he’d grabbed hold of in London had brought him straight to the corridor outside the castle, and he had to admit they had a raw beauty to them.</p><p>Vulchanova smiled as she caught his gaze.</p><p>“Beautiful, isn’t it? My ancestor Nerida certainly picked the right spot for the Institute.” She waved a hand in the direction of the portrait behind her, which Magnus noticed had moved, watching the sea with an almost wistful look.</p><p>Vulchanova gestured to the wooden chair in front of her desk, and Magnus took a seat, watching with some trepidation as Vulchanova conjured up two steaming mugs of liquid and waved her wand door behind him, whose bolts clunked their way back across. She offered him one, and he sniffed it suspiciously, finding, to his surprise, that it was distinctly alcoholic.</p><p>“Mulled wine from the kitchens,” Vulchanova smiled motioning him to take a sip. “It’s so cold here that we drink it quite often, not that it’s particularly alcoholic.”</p><p>Her eyes dipped towards Magnus’ fingernails, which, despite now being wrapped around the steaming mug, remained stubbornly blue-tinged. She aimed her wand behind her, and, with a conspiratorial wink, lit a fire in a small alcove beneath the portrait.</p><p>“Fires in the Institute are technically reserved for magical purposes, but being headmistress has some perks.”</p><p>Magnus gave her a small smile, before noticing for the first time that one of the parchment scrolls had remained on the desk. Vulchanova smoothed it out, and Magnus recognised the elegant loops of Professor McGonagall’s handwriting.</p><p>Vulchanova’s eyes quickly scanned the letter, her lips returning once more to their pursed state, and her dark eyebrows furrowing as she read further and further down.</p><p>Magnus’ stomach sunk. Whatever McGonagall had written, he doubted it was particularly kind. He’d disappointed her, well and truly, by getting expelled from Hogwarts.</p><p>And after she’d put so much faith in him, visited him regularly in the orphanage in Madrid, and allowed him to stay in Hogwarts over the holidays.</p><p>Lowering his eyes into his mug, he missed Vulchanova’s expression as she read the final paragraph of McGonagall’s letter, which passed through begrudging admiration to the same warmth that had surprised him moments earlier.</p><p>As she set the letter aside, however, her expression returned to the determined set it had been before, the warmth retained only in her dark eyes.</p><p>“So, welcome to the Institute, Magnus. You may know us back in the U.K. as ‘Durmstrang’, but since I took over from Igor Karkaroff, and the headship returned to the Vulchanov family, we’ve been restoring our international image. I find ‘the Institute’ fits us better now we longer teach the old Germanic curriculum of Dark Magic. That’s why I asked Percy Weasley to come work here for a few years; before the Battle of Hogwarts, I’d come across his work through the Department of International Magical Cooperation.”</p><p>Magnus barely resisted rolling his eyes at the mention of his new guardian, who had scarcely stopped speaking about his roles with the Ministry of Magic and the Combined Legislative Assembly of Volkhvs of Europe (CLAVE), whose headquarters, like Durmstrang, were in North-Eastern Europe.</p><p>“However,” Vulchanova continued, her eyes narrowing for a moment, “do not think for a moment that our spotted history will allow for a lenient approach to your recent transgressions.”</p><p>Magnus raised his chin, his kohl-lined eyes meeting her gaze with quiet defiance.</p><p>Vulchanova did not waver, and he could have sworn her hair grew even larger as it was illuminated by the flickering fire behind her.</p><p>“If I hear reports of you selling restricted substances – Alihotsy leaves, Firewhiskey, Mandrake leaves, anything – I will be forced to expel you from the Institute, and you can say goodbye any chance of finishing your NEWTs.”</p><p>Magnus glowered, but Vulchanova continued.</p><p>“That goes double fold for any reports of there being a student Animagus.” Magnus’ eyes flashed briefly, giving away his surprise.</p><p>“They don’t know?” he asked, all traces of obstinance gone from his jawline.</p><p>Vulchanova’s eyes softened once more.</p><p>“No, and I don’t intend it to be public knowledge. I realise you’re registered with the Ministry following your trial, but I’d appreciate it if you could refrain from using your Animagus form within the Institute, and certainly not in front of any other students.”</p><p>Magnus nodded silently, his eyes clouding over once more as he recalled the events of his final day at Hogwarts.</p><p>“Of course, Professor Weasley and Professor MacMillan are aware of your skill, but they can be relied upon to keep it to themselves,” Vulchanova continued, and Magnus remembered the blonde witch who had accompanied them from London, who had introduced herself as Audrey MacMillan. Percy had been almost unable to contain himself around her, and Magnus suspected a great deal of his stories about the CLAVE were for her benefit rather than his.</p><p>Of course they both knew of his ability, he groaned internally, he doubted anyone with a connection to Hogwarts could have missed hearing about the calamitous House Feast, the head girl’s speech, and Magnus’ hasty exit on all fours.</p><p>Which meant they probably knew everything that had been said in that speech, including some things he’d really rather keep hidden.</p><p>“They won’t gossip, Magnus,” Vulchanova said softly, and Magnus realised his face had been betraying his inner turmoil.</p><p>“No one at the institute is aware of your father’s name, and I intend to keep it that way,” she said firmly, and Magnus was unable to hide the relief that crossed his face.</p><p>“Not that it wouldn’t have made your acceptance a bit easier if they had,” Vulchanova added with a wry smile, “there are certain individuals among our governors who still hold your father in good respect.”</p><p>Magnus swallowed the lump in his throat, his face the carefully practiced picture of impassivity he always adopted when hearing about his father’s history.</p><p>Vulchanova’s face retained more of her warmth this time, as she finished the mug of wine she was holding, rising to her feet with a graceful swish of her long, fur robe.</p><p>“Enough of threats and promises,” she smiled, waving her wand to the door, “let me show you around before second period.”</p><p>She handed him a small brown folder, the first page which Magnus could make out as his timetable, and strode toward the door. As she threw it open once more, which Magnus now realised was probably due to its sheer weight rather than any particular exuberance, he finished the remainder of his wine and turned to follow, casting one last glace out the window to the sea.</p><p>He couldn’t shake the longing for Hogwarts, but if Nadezhda Vulchanova was anything to go by, Durmstrang, or rather ‘The Institute’, was going to be far from what he’d expected.</p><p>Not that Magnus had known what to expect after being dragged to a different continent by portkey, accompanied by a new (Ministry-assigned) guardian, to finish his NEWTs at the only school in the wizarding world who was willing to accept him.</p><p>“Come along,” Vulchanova interrupted his thoughts, flashing a bright smile as she waited for him at the doorway, “if we’re quick, you can catch the end of the fifth-form Martial Magic class – I was hoping you might consider taking an additional OWL this year.”</p><p>Magnus raised an eyebrow at the mention of Martial Magic, but moved across the room faster than his usual feigned nonchalance would allow.</p><p>It was <em>definitely</em> not what he expected, but an OWL in Martial Magic sounded undeniably badass.</p>
