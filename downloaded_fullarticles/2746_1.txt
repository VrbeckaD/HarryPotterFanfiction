    <p>Harry Potter sat in his cupboard under the stairs, slowly rubbing his stomach, as hunger caused it to ache.<br/>
<br/>
He didn’t mean to- I mean- honestly- how could he have done it? His relatives had decided his hair looked stupid and cut it stupidly, causing him to be bald in some places. Harry knew he would be bullied worse than usual and cried himself to sleep, thinking that the school year was going to be horrible. However, the next morning all his hair had grown back!<br/>
<br/>
But you see, Harry’s relatives hated him and his ‘unnatural’ ways. His uncle especially got rather violent.<br/>
<br/>
That is why Harry sat in his cupboard, the pain from the beating just now going away, starving, as he hadn’t eaten in three days. Oh yes, they let him out. For 5 minutes to use the toilet. Once a day.<br/>
Otherwise he was trapped.<br/>
<br/>
“I just want to be happy” Harry muttered quietly, eyes squeezed, “somewhere where no one can hurt me, somewhere where I can be in control.”<br/>
<br/>
Now, magic is a very powerful thing. Magic can break rules of nature, magic can unravel time, magic can even defy the basic rules of the universe. Many magical people forget this and put restrictions and regulations on it. But at its core, magic is only about intent.<br/>
<br/>
Many people forget magic had chosen children too.<br/>
<br/>
Harry Potter is no regular wizard, he is much more in tune with Magic and her ways. Not one of her chosen, but her child instead, that is, if it wasn’t for a meddling headmaster who decided to chain up his core, so he was weak, barely using up to 5% of his total potential.<br/>
<br/>
However, magic is cunning, and no force can stop her, especially when protecting her children and chosen.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, is it really a surprise she took Fate into her own hands?<br/>
—<br/>
<br/>
Harry looked around. He was no longer in his cupboard, but instead in a large open field. However, instead of green grass and blue skies, when he looked up he saw a brilliant painting of deep reds and blues that mixed with each over.<br/>
<br/>
<em>‘It's beautiful, is it not?’</em> a soft voice spoke, coming from everywhere and yet nowhere.<br/>
<br/>
Harry shrieked, jumping up and spinning around-<br/>
“W-who’s there?!” He exclaimed.<br/>
<br/>
A wishful sigh filled the air, as a cloud of gold and green appeared in front of him.<br/>
<em>‘Do you not recognise your own mother? The one who gave you the power that rests inside you? Do you not recognise my power? Do you not recognise me, my child? Oh child, how fate has been cruel!’</em> The voice cried, keeping that gentle tone even as it seemed to weep.<br/>
<br/>
Harry looked shocked, unsure how to react, until he felt it. The soft gentle power seemed to fill the area, from the grass to the sky. It all spoke with a gentle wave... like a mother hugging her child, a memory he didn’t consciously remember, but his soul did, “I-I don’t understand” he spoke weakly, his mouth feeling dry.<br/>
<br/>
<em>‘No, I am not surprised. My name is Mother Magic, I am one of the five entities that rule the multiverse. You are one of my 17 children, and the only one currently alive.’</em> The voice – Mother Magic – spoke with a wishful tone, as if thinking about happy times. However, that tone quickly became dark, the golden lights being overcome by the green, ‘<em>Fate has been cruel. You see, there are five entities: me, Death, Fate, Time, and finally Chaos. A few thousand centuries ago me and Fate had a war, my chosen versus hers. My chosen, who you might know as Merlin, won, but soon perished. I had thought me, and Fate had made up, but she is cunning and driven by anger.’</em> Magic seemed reluctant to carry on, as if holding the secrets of the world would destroy it if told.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it would.<br/>
<br/>
<em>‘The chosen of Fate are chosen by Prophecy, and unlike me she has complete control over them. Now, this would not have been a problem if it was the same for me, however I cannot control what my children do. Fate can. She has two chosen at the moment, Albus Dumbledore and Tom Riddle. Both insane men who crave power and will sacrifice anyone to get it. She used Tom to rid you of your parents, while making sure Albus put you in an abusive home, so you will later die to fulfil her prophecy.’</em><br/>
<br/>
Harry crumbled to the floor. Prophecies, magic, evil men, what the hell? He-he-<br/>
<br/>
<em>‘Need time?’</em> Magic chuckled softly, the overwhelming green slowly turned back until it was the happy golden green again.<br/>
<br/>
“I-I don’t understand. Why would Fate do that? Why me- what did I do to deserve this?! To deserve any of this?!” Harry screamed out, his frustration overwhelming him as fat tears bubbled down his face, blinding him.<br/>
<br/>
Because of this he didn’t notice the sky above seemed to change, another colour added, a light grey.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>‘Because I am selfish.’</strong><br/>
<br/>
A loud voice echoed behind him, but instead of the kind and gentle voice of Mother Magic, this voice was hard.<br/>
<br/>
Harry turned around, just as fingers touched his face and cleared it of his tears. In front of him was a woman in her mid-twenties, with silver hair and bright blue eyes. She wore golden jewellery around her neck and ears, with black mascara. She reminded Harry very much of old Egyptian queens.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>‘I was jealous of Magic and did not even consider what I was doing to you. When I finally saw the pain and horror I put you through, and what I had planned in my drunken state, I felt horrid. I never meant to harm you young one’ </strong>the lady said, speaking with guilt and anger,<strong> ‘this was never my original plan’</strong><br/>
<br/>
Harry quickly put one and one together, and realised who the lady in front of him was, “A-Are you Fate?”<br/>
<br/>
The woman chuckled,<strong> ‘Yes, I am Lady Fate. I see Mother Magic has already explained my existence’</strong><br/>
<br/>
Harry stared, confused. He heard Magic chuckling behind him. “Mother Magic?”<br/>
<br/>
<em>‘Indeed. You see, we all have our names. Lord Death, Lady Fate, Empress Chaos, Mother Magic, and Grandpa Time.’</em> Magic explained, her voice happy and light.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>‘Now, child, to apologise for all the pain and suffering I have planned, I have decided to give you a chance at another life. You will be teleported to a different world, where you can spend the remainder of your years. However, when you turn 11, you must attend Hogwarts for 7 years, so the prophecy can come to pass. Once that is over, you may leave, but there is one thing you mustn’t do before that.’</strong><br/>
<br/>
Harry could hardly contain himself. Leaving the Dursley’s? Forever?! How could he say no?<br/>
<br/>
<em>‘Child, in order to do this, you must give up something to gain it. You must give up your speech of snakes.’</em> Mother Magic said softly.<br/>
<br/>
Harry froze – after all, the garden snakes helped him keep sane. They were his only friends, told him he was special and should keep going, how could he give that up?<br/>
<br/>
Magic and Fate looked sadly, ‘<strong>A price for a price, you shall no longer be cable of speaking to serpent, however that doesn’t mean you can’t in this new world’</strong><br/>
<br/>
<em>‘Fate is correct, there is a gift called Psyche. This is a different word for magic, this will enable you to speak directly into someone else’s thoughts, and they can read yours. This includes animals. However, this is only true of the animals in the new world, animals in this world cannot your thoughts, unless they are part human or are a unicorn or a Phoenix.’</em><br/>
<br/>
Harry looked unsure for a moment, before nodding, “it’s not like I plan to stay in this world.”<br/>
<br/>
Fate laughed cheerily,<strong> ‘True! Nothing to lose. So, do you accept our deal?’</strong><br/>
<br/>
Harry nodded, and his vision quickly turned to black. The harsh laughter and gentle presence slowly washing away.</p><p>The soft baby blue sky was the first thing Harry saw as he opened his eyes. Then he saw the towering trees that seemed to go on forever. The sounds of wind and the smell of grass hit him next.<br/>
<br/>
“W... where am I?” Harry muttered softly as he sat up, and as he did, he felt something fall into his lap, and there sat an odd egg. It was white with green and red splotches. Brushing of any dirt that might be on him, he picked up the egg and looked around. Strange noises seemed to echo through the trees. Choosing a direction that felt right, he started to walk. In the trees, odd looking birds sat, and odd-looking plants with berries on them grew by the trees. The longer he walked, the more he felt he was heading in the right direction, and suddenly he found a house. The house was white with large glass windows. The front garden had many plants and bushes, with a stone pathway to the door and a side gate to the backyard.</p><p>As he walked forward towards the door, a deep hissing noise caused him to turn around. There in front of him stood a large cat-like creature, that was purple with yellow patterns and stomach, and its tail was long and pointed.</p><p>“<em>Human in my territory</em>!” the catlike creature snarled, before its claws started to glow and it went to scratch him.</p><p>Shrieking, he desperately moved back, before flipping around to keep the egg and his face safe.</p><p>“Haxorus, use Dragon Pulse!” A voice shouted out in front of him.</p><p>A deafening roar cried out before a bright light filled the area. When the light died down, Harry glanced out, before seeing the cat thing running away. Looking up he gasped in shock.</p><p>A very tall creature with golden scales, two blood red tusks and ruby eyes looked down at him.</p><p>“Hello! Are you Harry Potter”? A voice said next to the large creature – and just watching from the corner of his eye he saw her. She had soft purple eyes and dark black hair, with a dark blue jumper, blue jeans and black boots. “I see you made it okay, though that Liepard did give you a bit of trouble! My name is Ivy. I was asked by Fate to be your teacher and ‘professor’ as you are here. Basically, meaning I care for your Pokémon when you have a full party.”</p><p>“W-what? Liepard? Pokémon?”</p><p>Ivy smiled softly, “The creature you were fighting, and the one in front of you, are Pokémon. Pokémon are creatures that live in this world – and I see you have a Pokémon egg.”</p><p>“I – it is?”</p><p>“Indeed! Come, there is much to explain,” she pulled out a red and white ball with a button and pressed it, “Return, honey.” The creature let out one last roar before becoming red light and entering the ball. </p><p>Ivy started walking towards the black front door and opened it, forcing Harry to jump up to keep up with her while making sure the egg was safe. Looking into the house, he saw that the interior of the house was surprisingly empty, with a staircase of to the left side and a large open area to the right. Going into the large open area, a desktop was the only thing that separated the kitchen room from the open room. A door to the right lead to a bathroom, and finally a glass door at the back lead to the backyard.<br/>
<br/>
Harry looked at then empty house. Only the very basics where there. The open space had a fireplace, and the kitchen had a fridge, an oven and some cupboards. Each place consisted of white walls and black wood floor. The stairs were also made of black wood with a metal railing.<br/>
Under the stairs was a white door that stood out from the blackness of the stairs.<br/>
<br/>
“This floor is mainly a kitchen, a living room and a bathroom. The door leads to the basement and the stairs lead to the higher level,” Ivy informed the child, “The house is empty, apart from the main things you’ll need. There is a greenhouse in the garden, so we can grow food, however for the first two years we are here I will be making food.”<br/>
<br/>
“Why is it only the basics?” Harry asked the elder.<br/>
<br/>
“Because this world is harsh. When you go on your Pokémon journey you will be forced to survive on your own. Camping, cooking food and other basic things are taught to children. This house belongs to you, it is up to you to design it. I can buy things, but only for the first few years.” Ivy stated, before pointing upstairs.<br/>
<br/>
Getting the message, he walked up the stairs to find 6 rooms, three on each side. The three that where on the side of the stairs where bedrooms. The first having a queen-sized bed with a bathroom to the side, showing it was the master bedroom. On the wall was a balcony over showing the yard. The bedroom was forest green with gold details.<br/>
The second bedroom was a soft blue colour with a twin sized bed, the wall was lined with bookcases and there was a desk in the corner. There was a large window on the wall showing of the rich forest they were in.<br/>
<br/>
“This is my bedroom,” Ivy smiled softly.<br/>
<br/>
The last bedroom was completely empty, apart from two white beds and a window on the wall.<br/>
<br/>
The next two rooms where connected, one being a large library, filled to the brims with books. Each shelf was a different colour, “Blue for information on your world, Red for information on Pokémon, and finally Green for information on magic,” informed Ivy.<br/>
<br/>
The room next to it was a room with a large window at the back and a desk in the middle. “This is for practicing magic in,” Chuckled Ivy.<br/>
<br/>
“Magic?”<br/>
<br/>
“Yes, I’m your teacher, remember?”<br/>
<br/>
The final room was a large room with a balcony to the side. The room had a large machine in it, but was otherwise empty.</p><p>“What’s this room for?” Harry questioned<br/>
<br/>
“It’s for Pokémon. This machine is a transporter. I’ll go into more detail later, but when you reach the 6 Pokémon limit, any Pokémon you catch are transferred here. On the other hand, when you are at a Pokémon Centre, I can give you back the Pokémon if you give me one from your party.” Ivy explained patiently.<br/>
<br/>
“So, will you explain more about Pokémon now?”<br/>
<br/>
Ivy laughed<br/>
—<br/>
A few years went by, and Harry officially became ten. By then, the house had filled up, the living room gaining a tv and sofa, the kitchen was stocked with food, the basement filled with food for Pokémon and treats. The upstairs bedrooms mostly stayed the same, but Harry’s gained posters on the wall, a desk in the corner with books and pens, a chest filled with toys, and shelves filled with small toys or statues. The room for Pokémon was now filled with soft pillows and beanbags with a large blue blanket on the floor, and a chest full of toys in the back.<br/>
<br/>
In this time, Harry had gained a close bond with Ivy, who went from a teacher to a sister. Ivy taught Harry about the rules of Pokémon, how to control his magic (Psyche), and how to survive. Ivy also showed him the rest of her Pokémon: a Hydreigon, a Togekiss, a Mienshao, A Mightyena and finally an Alakazam. She would often let harry spend time with them, so he could see how they interacted with each over.</p><p>The egg he had also hatched to revel a Ralts, which formed a very close bond with Harry. You could often find them together exploring the forest, with Ralts in Harry’s arms or on top of his head.</p><p>During the 3 years they had been in Unova, they had met the locals in Nuvema town. Harry especially had two friends, a girl called Hilda and a boy called Hilbert, who were both a few years younger than him.</p><p>Along with this, he revealed he had the gift to speak to Pokémon. Ivy told him it was an extremely unique gift, and Harry would spend hours talking to Pokémon he met.</p><p>Today, he was getting his starter Pokémon from Ivy and a pokèdex, and then meeting up with his friends to say goodbye.</p><p>Harry smiled at what Ivy would choose as starter Pokémon. He chuckled softly, whatever she chooses as starters, it would not be the normal three.</p><p>“Excited?” The cheerful voice of Ivy greeted him. “Breakfast? Since today is your special day, I decided to cook.”</p><p>Ever since he got here, Harry did most of the housework. From cooking to cleaning, to helping Ivy cure wild Pokémon that came about, to feeding and other things. Ivy helped fix if the plumbing or electrical work came down, but otherwise it was up to him. So, having breakfast out was a nice surprise.</p><p>“So what Pokémon did you get for starters?” Harry asked excitedly, barely stopping himself from jumping.</p><p>Ivy grinned, “None.”</p><p>Harry tripped over himself, “What?!”</p><p>Ivy laughed, “I shall give you your first ten pokèballs and your trainer pass, but after that you’re on your own. You have a Pokémon after all, a Ralts. He shall be perfect.”</p><p>Harry smiled, “Yea! Apollo is close to evolving! He’s asleep right now though.”</p><p>Ivy smiled, “Okay, now eat up and go make sure you have everything.”</p><p>Harry nodded and quickly munched down his food before jumping up and running upstairs. He grabbed his backpack that was sitting on the bed from the night before.</p><p><em>“Do we leave now?”</em> A quiet muffled voice echoed out. From a large pile of pillows a little red horn poked out.</p><p>Giggling, Harry walked over and lifted the small Pokémon out from his pillows. “Yea! We start today! Imagine all the people and Pokémon we will meet! Oh, I can’t wait to see! Just imagine all the friends we will make!”</p><p>The tiny Pokémon giggled as he got comfortable in Harry’s arms, <em>“Let’s go! You’re making me super excited!” </em></p><p>Harry nodded and kissed the Ralt’s head, “We’re going to be great, Apollo! I know it.” He jumped around and ran downstairs, grinning with each step before he stopped by the front door All of Ivy’s Pokémon stood out there with Ivy herself in the middle.</p><p>“Harry, today marks the first day of your journey. I haven’t taught you all there is to know about magic, but I have prepared you for this world. So, I gift to you these,” she pulled out two boxes and handed them to Harry.</p><p>Harry put Apollo on his head and took the gifts. The first box contained 10 pokèballs, 5 potions, and a pokèdex. The second box contained a necklace with a small black box on the end. “What is this?” Harry asked, putting the other items in his bag and the pokèballs on his belt with Apollo’s.</p><p>“Take it off and say ‘Enlarge’ and then ‘Open’”</p><p>Harry’s eyes widened before he put it on the ground. “Enlarge!” he shouted, and the book grew triple the size it was before, now he could see it clearly. It was a black box with the imagine of an orange Victini, a white Silvally, and a red Yveltal staring up at a blue full moon.</p><p>“Inside this box is a library filled with books on magic. Use this to keep up with your studies.”</p><p>“Why Victini, Silvally and Yveltal?” Harry questions, rubbing his hand over them.</p><p>Ivy smiled, “Victini is the symbol of Victory, and it is said that a trainer with Victini will never lose. Silvally is when Type: Null breaks it’s mask because of trust, so is a symbol of trust and friendship. Finally, Yveltal is a symbol of death, and that you should never fear death. The Moon shows darkness, but also shows how you have two sides, your magic and original world and your Pokémon and this world.”</p><p>Harry jumped at Ivy, Apollo barely manging to hold on as he hugged her, “Thank you! Thank you so much!”</p><p>Ivy wiped away tears, “This place will always be your home, and you shall always be my brother. So, go out there and make yourself proud, got it?”</p><p>“Yes! I will be back!”</p><p>“I know, now go.”</p><p>Harry nodded and hugged all the older Pokémon, who each said goodbye, and he shrunk the trunk before grabbing it. Putting it around his neck, he took Apollo in his arms and started off towards Nuvema town.</p>
