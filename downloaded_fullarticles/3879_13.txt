PROMPT<br/>
<em>“You sat next to me on the airplane and fell asleep on my shoulder and I don’t want to move you cause you look so comfortable. Oh and you’re hot.”</em><br/>
</p>
</blockquote><h1>On the airplane</h1>
<p>Percival was in a right predicament at the moment. He was on an airplane on the way to Arizona for a business trip. Not that it was the first time (or the last), or that he was scared of flying. Oh no. He had been doing that for many years now. It was kind of part of his job. Being the vice president of the firma. Which means that this wasn’t the troublesome situation at all. </p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Instead his predicament was in the form of a handsome ginger head currently using his shoulder as a pillow. </p>
<p>He had noticed the man the moment he got onto the plane. He really wasn’t that easy to miss either, as tall as he probably was if he hadn’t walked with a bent back. The reddish curls falling deep into his face, slightly bowed body language and the non-stop fiddling with his hands, had shown such a skittish and nervous person. Most likely someone who wasn’t as happy about being able to fly as others were. The nervous biting of his lip and shy demeanor, apologizing for every accidental bump, while moving through the plane to search for his seat hadn’t helped either. </p>
<p>(It really didn’t help that Percival may have a thing for shy little things like that one seemed to be.)</p>
<p>But really striking were the green eyes, with seemingly tiny flecks of gold (if he hadn’t imagined them), that met his eyes for just a second, before moving on to his shoulder. A tiny blush appearing on freckled cheeks and a mumbles “excuse me”, when he moved in front of Percival to take the seat right beside him. Actually giving the older man a good view of a nicely formed ass in jeans, not that Percival would ever complain about that.</p>
<p>He had buckled up right away, hunching in on himself, legs moving up and down in nervous energy and hands clutching onto his knees. His face mostly hidden below ginger curls. Percival had tried to calm the young man, but only managed to get an even bigger blush and stuttered apologies in return. It was as endearing as it was a bit heartbreaking. </p>
<p>Percival was pretty sure that he even made a tiny squeak by the time of the take-off.</p>
<p>For the first part of the flight, the stranger was quite the mess of nervous energy, until his movements seemed to slow and his body started to tilt. Percival had been reading a book at the time, reading glasses on his nose, ignoring the pretty man as best as possible, since every try to make him calm had ended with furthering his embarrassment for being scared like that.</p>
<p>It only started to get hard to ignore, when a head suddenly landed heavily on his shoulder, making him drop his book in surprise. Turning his head to the side had confirmed his suspicion. The ginger head had probably stressed himself out so much, that he had fallen asleep. It actually made him smile a tiny bit, even though he bemoaned his fallen book a moment later, because he would definitely not move or call a stewardess to get it. Both could easily wake the exhausted man and that was not something Percival wanted to do.</p>
<p>Maybe he would ask someone later on, now he was actually enjoying the view for a bit. </p>

</p>
<p>The other was wearing a nicely fitting polo shirt, arms curled up to his elbows, showing off even more freckled skin. It actually made Percival wonder where else he had freckles. His face definitely had them too, the boyish face finally relaxed. He couldn’t be much older than 20 or 25, such a nice age. Also the hair was actually as soft as Percival had thought it may be the moment he caught a closer look. It made him want to run his hands through it (or maybe get a good grip on it, while the head was between his legs).</p>
<p>He shook his head slightly, being careful not to wake the younger man. He really didn’t need these kind of thoughts on an airplane, especially when he was unable to move away from the reason of these thoughts, without waking him and stressing him out again. Instead he leaned back into his seat and enjoyed the view and soothing breathing of the other man.</p>
<p>He must have fallen asleep at some point himself, jolting awake when the announcement of their incoming landing was made. The weight of the others head on his shoulder not there anymore. When he moved his head to the side he only saw an even redder face, completely with ears and down into the shirt. Hair hiding most of the face. </p>
<p>Quite endearing indeed. Too bad he hadn’t been able to flirt with the poor guy.</p>
<p>Though this time Percival was actually bold enough to move his hand onto the freckled one clutching the armrest between them. Keeping it reassuring instead of capturing and getting a startled squeak in return. He moved his thumb in a reassuring manner, being quite pleased when the hand under his wasn’t moved away and instead started to relax.</p>
<p>The landing wasn't anything special after that. </p>
<p>Though he was sure that he heard a quiet “thank you” from beside him. </p>
<p>He was still thinking about how to maybe get to know the ginger head after all, while getting his cabin baggage, when that person all but fled the plane. Most likely glad to be on solid ground again. Percival sighed. So much for that… </p>
<p>...he would have really liked to get to know him too. </p>
<p>Not only had he seemed to be just his type in general, but endearing in all his little quirks as well. </p>
<p>With how fast the ginger head had left the plane, he was a bit surprised to see him shortly after by the luggage lines. Then again, the rest of their baggage hadn’t been unloaded yet. So maybe he shouldn’t have been surprised at all. </p>
<p>Though, this time he didn’t think for long and walked right over to him.</p>
<p>“Excuse me.”</p>
<p>Startled, the other turned around and a second later, turned bright red.</p>
<p>Percival smirked slightly.</p>
<p>“You sat beside me on the airplane and fell asleep on my shoulder. I didn’t want to move, because you looked so comfortable.”</p>
<p>He moved closer slightly, noticing how the other just seemed to get redder, opening and closing his mouth, as if he wanted to say something but lost his voice. Percival could imagine that it were more apologies, so he moved on instead.</p>
<p>“Also, you’re hot. Would you like to go get a coffee with me?”</p>
