    <p>"Itachi, what's Hogwarts like?" Sasuke asks his big brother innocently.</p>
<p>He had just gotten his letter and the Uchiha family was currently in Diagon Alley. They were far from along though. There were likely hundreds of other people milling about the crowded street. Most of them were either shopping for their school supplies or taking someone else shopping.</p>
<p>"Sasuke, you've asked that question at least at hundred times today alone." Itachi chuckles.</p>
<p>"Yeah! I know, but you might remember something you forgot the other times." The raven haired boy replies.</p>
<p>Itachi was a sixth year student at Hogwarts. He knew all about it. N.E.W.T.S. were really the only thing that he hadn't done yet. The way Sasuke saw it, there was almost nothing that his big brother didn't know about his new school and he should make good use of that fact!</p>
<p>"Humor, your brother. You were the same way, when you were his age. Actually, I believe you were worse. That's probably because you're a Ravenclaw though, Itachi." Fugaku observes with a chuckle.</p>
<p>"What's wrong with being a Ravenclaw?" Mikoto demands.</p>
<p>"Nothing, My Love. It's a fine house. I'm just saying that Ravenclaws are naturally more inquisitive." He says quickly and Sasuke laughs.</p>
<p>His father had been a Gryffindor. His mother was a Ravenclaw. Itachi took after his mother in that respect. Though they had people from all four houses in their family. (That was only to be expected when you were in a family this large.)</p>
<p>"Yes, well that's true." Mikoto says, seemingly pacified for the moment.</p>
<p>"Which house are you hoping to get, Sasuke?" Itachi asks.</p>
<p>"I'm not sure. They all sound good." The younger Uchiha says with a smile as he darts ahead off them off to Madam Malkin's to get his robes.</p>
<p>He knew that his parents and brother wouldn't take long to find him. So what was the point in waiting around. While he was there, he saw lots of kids around his age. They were probably trying to get their robes too!</p>
<p>"Hey!" A girl with bright pink hair calls out to him.</p>
<p>Sasuke blinks. Why was this girl's hair pink? Had she tried to do magic and did it somehow backfire? That was weird. Why didn't her parents change it back?</p>
<p>There was some kind of rule against kids doing magic outside of school. When you were little though, you didn't always have control over it. Almost every witch or wizard had a story about losing control of their powers and Sasuke was no exception in this regard.</p>
<p>
  <em>"Owe!" Sasuke grumbled as his aunt pinched his cheek again. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>He really hated when she did that. Why did people always do that to young kids? Big people could be so annoying sometimes!</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"Oh Mikoto. He's just adorable with those cute little cheeks and those big bubble eyes of his." The other woman gushed. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Little cheeks? His cheeks weren't little and what did she mean by bubble eyes? Honestly, he didn't really understand adults at least half the time. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"Forgive her, Sasuke. It's just her way of showing that she cares." Itachi whispered to him.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Sasuke sighed and nodded. That was until she did it again. He yelled at her and suddenly her robes were on fire. The woman screamed until his mother put out the flames. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"Well, look on the bright side. The boy definitely isn't a Squib and yellow really isn't your color, anyway." Fugaku offered. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"Fugaku! That really isn't the point! That boy just tried to burn me alive!" His sister-in-law snapped at him.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>"I think you're being overdramatic. Most magical children have outburst like this. He basically had a temper tantrum. Perhaps, you should stop pinching his cheeks." Mikoto suggested. </em>
</p>
<p>To most Wizarding Families, there were few fates that were worse than being born a Squib. A Squib was a person who came from a magical family, but couldn't use magic. There used to be a caretaker at Hogwarts who was one, but he had retired before Itachi got there.</p>
<p>"Hello." Sasuke greets her.</p>
<p>"So you going to Hogwarts too?" The young girl asks.</p>
<p>"Mhm. I'm going to be a first year. Who are you though? I'm Sasuke." He says.</p>
<p>That was the wrong thing to say. The other girl told him that her name was Sakura. She also told him a lot more than that. Apparently, she came from a Muggle Family and had no clue about well anything magically related.</p>
<p>"Be nice to her, you prat! She's new!" Sasuke hears an all too familiar voice say and he mentally groans.</p>
<p>Naruto was his best friend and rival, but the other boy had this weird thing. This Hero Thing. Sasuke didn't really get it himself. He supposed that the blonde thought that it was still the Middle Ages where the Princes always had to save the Princesses or something.</p>
<p>He always insisted on being nice to girls. Just because they were girls and for no other reason. Sasuke thought that was stupid, really. He was nice to people who deserved it. Gender had nothing to do with it.</p>
<p>"I was being nice to her." Sasuke protests.</p>
<p>"Good! Then she can come with us to get our wands and other stuff!" The blonde says.</p>
<p>Sasuke gapes at him. He couldn't be serious. The girl was never going to be quiet! Couldn't he just chuck a copy of Hogwarts A History at her and be on his way? Apparently not.</p>
<p>"I guess. If my parents say it's okay and if he parents do. I know yours will. Your mother teaches Muggle Studies. She'd probably be fascinated." Sasuke says with a sigh.</p>
<p>"What's Muggle Studies?" Sakura asks.</p>
<p>"Muggles are people without magic. Muggle Studies means that our people study yours. Not everyone comes from the same kind of background you do. Your world is as strange to us as ours is to you." Sasuke explains.</p>
<p>To Sasuke's utter horror, the girl was now looking at him as if he was some sort of God. This was so not good. Damn it. Why couldn't girls leave him alone?!</p>
<p>"You're really smart! I bet you'll be in Ravenclaw!" Sakura says.</p>
<p>That was when their parents came in. Thank Merlin for small mercies. Knowing Naruto, he'd probably find a way to get the girl to tag along with them to get their wands. He really had the worst luck!</p>
<p>"Hey, Mr. and Mrs. Uchiha, do you think we could go and get our wands now! That would be really cool! Oh and we made a new friend. Her name is Sakura. We still have to ask her parents, if she can come with us. They're Muggles though. So I really think that they'd appreciate the help, anyway." Naruto says brightly.</p>
<p>There were times when Sasuke was simply astounded by the other boy's amazing lung capacity. Naruto somehow managed get that all out in one breath. Really, it was nothing of incredible.</p>
<p>"Well, I suppose it's alright. We can all go together. That's assuming of course, that Sakura's parents agree." Fugaku replies diplomatically, obviously used to Naruto's antics.</p>
<p>"Yay!" Naruto says as he bounds off and goes to speak with Sakura's parents.</p>
<p>"That boy has more energy than there are books in the Hogwarts' Library." Mikoto observes with a giggle.</p>
<p>It didn't take long for Sakura's family to agree. Sasuke shakes his head. Well it didn't really matter. He was looking forward to getting his wand.</p>
<p>"We should get going, if we intend to beat the crowd." Itachi offers and the others nod in agreement as they set off, after they had all gotten their robes.</p>
<hr/>
<p>It didn't take them long to get to Ollivanders. Not surprisingly, Naruto was the first to bound in. Sakura looked a little more wary and in awe of all the boxes that were on the shelves. Clearly, she knew what was inside them. Wands.</p>
<p>"Ah welcome. It seems we have three first time wand buyers." Ollivander says with a strange smile.</p>
<p>To Sasuke, it looked like he had stuck his hair in an electric socket and gotten shocked. Of course, he wasn't actually going to say that. That would be rude. If he was rude, his mother and father would probably take away his allowance. That wouldn't be any fun.</p>
<p>"It seems like Naruto wants to go first." Minato says with a chuckle.</p>
<p>"He's certainly eager. Then again, so were we. I remember when you were that age, Minato. You must have gone through at least a dozen boxes before you found yours." Fugaku observes.</p>
<p>"Oh don't remember me. I remember every single wand that I've ever sold and that wand almost blew up my shop. 16 inches. Phoenix feather. Supple and made out of rosewood." He recalls.</p>
<p>Sasuke blinks. Minato was a fully grown man. He had gotten his wand probably two decades ago. That or something close to it. Ollivander certainly wasn't kidding when he said that he remembered every wand that he'd ever sold.</p>
<p>"Oh right. I am sorry about that." Minato says sheepishly.</p>
<p>"It's fine. Now, boy all you have to do is give it a wave and see how it feels. Remember, the wand always chooses it's owner, but its reasoning will forever remain a mystery to some." Ollivander explains.</p>
<p>Sasuke notes that Sakura and her parents look equal parts fascinated and wary. He couldn't help, but wonder what it would be like. They honestly had no idea what they were getting into, but at least Sakura seemed to know about the four Houses. That was a start.</p>
<p>A few minutes later and Naruto had probably gone through about six wands. One made some cases fall off of the shelves. Another caused a minor explosion. Still there were others that did almost nothing. Whether this was normal or typical, Sasuke wasn't entirely sure. Though eventually, Naruto did find one.</p>
<p>"Whoa!" Naruto says as a swirl of wind surrounds him.</p>
<p>"Ah ha! There we go. Let's have a look here. Ah. This a fourteen inch, apple wood wand with a phoenix feather. Surprisingly swishy. It seems you take after your father in a lot of ways. Merlin, help us all. " Ollivander muses.</p>
<p>"What's that mean?" Sakura asks in confusion.</p>
<p>Itachi smiles kindly at the young girl and that was how Sasuke knew that he was going to explain everything. That was just what Itachi did.</p>
<p>"In general most wands range between 9 to 14 inches. Wands that are bigger than smaller than that are usually extremely rare and require a certain temperament or physical stature to wield them. Those larger than that tend love the spotlight or be taller than most. Those that are smaller, tend to be shy or smaller than most in size. Swishy wands are often paired with those who have an amiable personality. The core and wood are more involved though." Itachi nods at her.</p>
<p>"How so?" Sakura asks curiously.</p>
<p>"Phoenix feathers are amazingly strong, but it's difficult to find a wizard or witch who proves themselves worthy of such a wand. They're extremely picky and generally gravitate towards those who are considered 'heroic.' Though some say people's favorite colors might have something to do with it as well. You know, 'fire' colors. As for apple, well they tend to be drawn to those who are social and display great loyalty towards their friends." Ollivander explains to the young girl.</p>
<p>Sakura nods in understanding and Sasuke watches as the young witch heads towards the counter. This should be interesting. A Muggleborn getting their first wand would be fascinating to witness. It was like a bird learning how to fly or something.</p>
<p>"Here you go, My Dear. Try this one. Give it a wave." Ollivander tells her.</p>
<p>Sakura nods and smiles as she waves the wand. Out of the wand shoots a brilliant flash of silver mist. Ollivander nods approvingly.</p>
<p>"Well that was surprisingly easy. Let's see what you have here. Ah yes. 12 inch willow, with a unicorn hair, and surprisingly bendy. Very nice." He tells her.</p>
<p>"Hmm well the owner of a willow wand tends to excel in more 'helpful' forms of magic such as Charms, Divination, Healing, and of course, Herbology. Their owners are sometimes rumored to be late bloomers as far as coming into their own goes, but I'm not sure how much stock to put in that. Bendy means you're willing to compromise, but there are some things that you won't do." Mikoto informs Sakura.</p>
<p>"That's amazing, Sweetie!" Sakura's mother says, who blushes.</p>
<p>Sasuke shakes his head. He felt a little bad for her. She was annoying, but he knew how embarrassing parents could be. Anyway, he steps up to get his own wand.</p>
<p>The first wand that he tries, issues a fiery explosion. To say the least, Ollivander wasn't particularly pleased about having a giant puff of smoke get in his face. Sasuke apologizes and tries another.</p>
<p>The second wand caused a bunch of a light bulb to explode. Some other wands produced comical effects such as flowers. Sasuke was sure that blonde was never going to let him live that one down. Damn it.</p>
<p>Eventually, Sasuke picks up a wand and swishes one that made him feel something that he couldn't quite articulate. Ollivander was right. The wand really did choose the wizard.</p>
<p>"Ah excellent. Hmm. Another 14 inch wand. This time we have a core of dragon heartstring and ebony for the wood. It's quite rigid." He observes.</p>
<p>"What's that mean?" Naruto inquires curiously.</p>
<p>"It means he's stubborn as Hell. He's not going to change his mind about anything. He's also a dominant personality like you and is ridiculously competitive. Dragon wands are wickedly powerful, but there is a trade off. They tend to have less control than other wands. Ebony wands tend to favor more combative styles of magic. Most of their owners are also stubborn arses and who spend way too much time preening with their hair in the shower." Itachi winks.</p>
<p>Sasuke grumbles. Itachi wasn't helping. His own brother had just called him stubborn in front of his friend and Sakura. Not that he cared what Sakura thought of him.</p>
<p>Honestly, he had always liked boys better anyway. Girls giggled too much. Giggling was strange.</p>
<p>"Oh don't look at me like that, Sasuke. You know that it's true." He smirks.</p>
<p>"The list says that they can bring a pet. Perhaps we should go and look at this Magical Menagerie place next." Sakura's mother suggests.</p>
<p>There were murmurs of agreement. The rather large procession makes their way to the magical pet shop. It didn't take long for the children to split up to look at their respective pets, once there either.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Sakura was definitely a girl. She immediately races over to the cats. Sasuke quite liked cats, but owls just seemed more useful in his opinion for Hogwarts.</p>
<p>"They're all so pretty! I can't decide!" She exclaims.</p>
<p>Owls could carry your mail. Why rely on the Hogwarts' Post when you had your own? Besides, they were pretty badass.</p>
<p>He smiles as he looks around. Hmm. Wow. There were a lot of different species here. They ranged from small to massive.</p>
<p>"Oh yeah! I want this one. This is the biggest toad that I've ever seen!" His friend exclaims.</p>
<p>A toad? Really? Naruto was such a loser. He had the choice of an owl, a cat, a rat, or a toad. The only thing stupider than choosing a rat was the toad. Whatever. The loser could get what he wanted.</p>
<p>"I like this one." Sasuke says with a smile as he observes a regal looking Eagle Owl.</p>
<p>It was much cooler than some tabby or toad. Honestly, those two were strange. They had no sense of style.</p>
<p>"Are you sure, Sasuke? An owl is a big responsibility." Mikoto says.</p>
<p>"Oh let the boy have his fun. Besides, I had an Eagle Owl at that age. Just like that one." Her husband says.</p>
<p>Sasuke could see his mother was wavering, but she nods her head in consent. Good. If Itachi could have a Snowy Owl, he could have an Eagle Owl! It was only fair!</p>
<p>"I think that I'll call him, Garuda." Sasuke says with a smile, feeling rather proud of himself for finding such an awesome bird of prey to be his companion.</p>
<p>"This is Gamabunta! Isn't he amazing?" Naruto asks.</p>
<p>"Yeah. Sure. Whatever you say, Loser." Sasuke taunts him.</p>
<p>Just then, Sakura picks out her pet cat. That was probably a good thing. Most likely, she had prevented them from getting into one of their world famous fights. Well that or infamous. Either way worked, really.</p>
<p>"I'll take this one. She's got such beautiful snowy white fur. I think I'll name her…Katsuyu." The pink haired girl says.</p>
<p>Sasuke nods and shrugs. It was as good a name as any really and they still had a lot of shopping to do. At this point, he figured that Sakura was coming with them for the rest of their excursion.</p>
<p>He figures he might as well work on his best man speech as well. Naruto might actually like this girl. Like like her. Not just as a friend, but as a girlfriend. Sasuke could be wrong though. It wasn't like he was an expert on love at age eleven. (Though he was damn sure that he knew more than Naruto did about the topic)!</p>
<p>"Alright. Well I suppose we should go and get your books next." Sakura's father says.</p>
<p>Idly, Sasuke muses that he probably should learn their names at some point. Oh well. He could do that later. This was perhaps the only time in his life that he had ever enjoyed shopping really.</p>
<p>It was as day of firsts. His first personal owl. His first wand. His first Hogwarts School Supplies Shopping Day. The young wizard knew that he was unlikely to ever forget it really.</p>
<p>"That would likely be a good idea." Minato agrees as they all headed off.</p>
<hr/>
<p>The rest of the day passed in something of a blur. Sasuke was happy because he had his pet and his wand. Everything else was a requirement. Though he did mourn the fact that he couldn't bring a broom with him. That just sucked.</p>
<p>"Don't worry. Maybe we can make the team next year. First Years never make the team." Naruto sighs as they finish up for the day, a few hours later.</p>
<p>"What team?" Sakura asks in confusion.</p>
<p>Sasuke sighs. He really needed to get her to read more of Hogwarts A History or something. Oh well. She was annoying, but in this case it wasn't her fault.</p>
<p>Sakura came from a completely different world. She was completely Muggleborn. It wasn't like Naruto's father who was from a pureblooded family and Kushina who came from a Muggle one.</p>
<p>"The Quidditch Team. Think of it as being similar to soccer on broom sticks. You fly through the air after the balls." He says.</p>
<p>There was no mix. Sakura came from a completely Muggle background. That meant that everything was new to her. It was only natural that she had lots of questions. (That didn't make it any less annoying to have to explain every little detail though, but he was really trying his best to be patient).</p>
<p>"Oh. That's cool! Have you two ever played before?" She asks.</p>
<p>"A little. Mostly informally." Sasuke says.</p>
<p>"We play all the time. I'm totally going to be Captain one day. Believe it! It's my dream!" The blonde says.</p>
<p>Sasuke smacks his forehead. Yes, his lifelong dream was to be Captain of the Quidditch Team and eventually go on to play professionally. Just like 90% of other eleven year old boys. It was very realistic!</p>
<p>"He's pretty good. Most likely because he has a really thick skull." Sasuke says knowledgeably.</p>
<p>"Don't let the Tough Guy Act fool ya. He can be nice. Well when he wants to be. Sasuke is probably just trying to scare you away because he's worried that you'll become my new best friend. That's stupid though. My mother told me that people can have more than one best friend." The blonde observes.</p>
<p>"If you have more than one of them, then it's not really a BEST friend. I'm so not worried about that though." Sasuke says as he crosses his arms and looks away from his friend.</p>
<p>He and Naruto had been inseparable since they were babies. Naruto was like a second brother to him. Sasuke couldn't imagine life without his shadow.</p>
<p>Well that was a bit debatable, he guessed. Maybe, he was the shadow. Naruto was definitely the more sunny between them. Sasuke was good at socializing with his family and Naruto, but mostly kept to himself otherwise.</p>
<p>"No, my foolish little brother. That's actually true." Itachi leans down slightly and pokes him in the forehead.</p>
<p>"Owe! You always do that!" He grumbles.</p>
<p>"It's just how I say that I love you. Would you rather that I hug you and embarrass you in front of your little girlfriend?" He asks.</p>
<p>Sasuke sputters with outrage! His girlfriend?! Itachi was kidding, right?! He did not like Sakura that way.</p>
<p>That and he didn't have time for a girlfriend. He wanted to become a powerful wizard like Itachi. A wizard that his father could be proud of. Who had time for girls?! Pft.</p>
<p>"You're mad! Stark, raving mad!" Sasuke hisses at him.</p>
<p>"Whatever you say. We should probably be going though. It's getting pretty late." Itachi observes.</p>
<p>"He's right. Well it was lovely meeting all of you and it's so nice to know that Sasuke will have at least two friends at school. Hopefully, they'll all get sorted into the same House." Mikoto says.</p>
<p>Sakura's parents seem to agree with that and thank the magical families for showing them around. With that being said, they departed with their daughter in two. Sasuke lets out a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>It was over. No marriage proposals today. Though he figured that he had to go to school with her for seven years. Seven long years. Merlin, help him!</p>
<p>"Oh don't look so forlorn. You'll see her again." Minato offers good-naturedly.</p>
<p>Sasuke blinks. He knew that Naruto's father was only trying to help, but he really wasn't. Why were adults so obtuse sometimes. He wanted to focus on learning magic, but if Naruto got a girlfriend that was going to be difficult.</p>
<p>Oh well. If the loser wanted one, that was fine. He'd find a way to tolerat whatever witch caught his fancy. That wasn't going to stop him from achieving his dream though!</p>
