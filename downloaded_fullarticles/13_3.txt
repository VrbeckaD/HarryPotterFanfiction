    <p align="center"> </p><p>The Dark Lady entered the room, tongues of shadow swirling around her, the air throbbed with her malevolent presence.</p><p>"I wanted him conscious," she snarled at the underlings who held the limp form of Draco Malfoy before her.</p><p>She grabbed Malfoy's chin. Nothing; not a flicker of movement or recognition but still she knew she had an audience to entertain.</p><p>"Pity," she purred at the uncaring figure before her, "so handsome, such power and promise, reduced to this – and for what?"</p><p>It was a rhetorical question, sycophantic laughter rippled around the room as if his suffering was some joke to them all. She let go his head it lolled to one side-too far gone to know or care. She stretched out a hand tendrils of shadow rippled down his blood soaked shirt tearing it asunder. Invisible cold hands cut across his throat but he felt nothing. They must have all know Draco Malfoy was as good as gone.</p><p>"Such a pity I don't have more time to play Draco," she said in a sickly sweet voice, "I'm sure we could have had such fun you and I. I would have enjoyed a <em>little pay back</em>." The last phrase was said with such venom some of those assembled flinched. Her voice rose as the shadows she carried with her gathered around her latest victim.</p><p>"So unresponsive, how rude Draco and I was sure you had such exquisite manners."</p><p>She sighed changing tone and persona as if each wisp of shadow she carried was a new voice that needed to be heard.</p><p>"I would have so enjoyed seeing your face as I ripped out your throat."</p><p>Even the ranks of Death Eaters gathered, the sane ones at least, stilled with fear in her presence. Preternatural stillness held the room as the clearly deranged witch continued her 'interrogation'.</p><p>"What's that you say?" She asked as if expecting an answer, "too quick, not painful enough to repay you what I owe?"</p><p>Some now watched enthralled with the thrill of her anticipated bloodlust as she continued her monologue. Others, Theo Nott amongst them, were not sure they could hold it together as they watched.</p><p>"You're right Draco darling, you <em>deserve</em> more," she continued as if addressing a small child.</p><p>"MORE pain, MORE suffering," she yelled before concluding with low menace.</p><p>" YOU-DESERVE-TO-BURN!" she punctuated every word for emphasis.</p><p>"Like the phoenix perhaps you will be reborn," she muttered these last words seemingly to herself, all vestige of sanity now apparently gone.</p><p>Flames formed at her finger tips growing with the fury of her switching mood.</p><p>"Your sweet pure blood will boil, your beautiful alabaster skin will blister and blacken and I will enjoy <em>every moment</em> of your agony."</p><p>White hot flame shot towards her still unconscious victim. The stench of burning flesh filled the space. Theo dare not look away but he knew what he saw would haunt him forever. Malfoy's handsome face melted, his fine platinum blond hair singed and flared briefly as tongues of fire raged around him. The Dark Lady circled like a carrion crow as she immolated her victim with nothing but cold indifference on her face.</p><p>"The ring"-she gestured to the hand of the now blackened heap before her –"clean up the mess." She took the Malfoy family ring and apparated away. Multiple pops of apparition sounded in her wake.</p><p><em>How had it come to this?</em> Nott wondered as he looked at the charred ground where his friend's body had been. <em>How could she have done this? He was certain they had been lovers.</em> <em>How had fate become so twisted and distorted that Draco Malfoy had died a martyr for the light?</em></p><hr/><p>"My Lord it is done," the Dark Lady announced to Voldemort as they all reappeared before him. She didn't even bother to bow.</p><p>"And the body?" he hissed.</p><p>"Vaporised," she said calmly, "but I assure you he is dead as many here witnessed and I brought a small souvenir." She held out the Malfoy family ring.</p><p>"I see," Voldemort said rather tartly.</p><p>Nott knew that if it had been anyone else, anyone else who didn't bow to him or call him My Lord they would have been dead by now but Theo suspected that against this formidable dark witch even Voldemort was not certain he would win.</p><p>Voldemort held out his hand for the ring, examined it then, satisfied it was indeed Draco's ring, he threw it aside and disappeared through a veil of black mist.</p><p>Now Voldemort was gone others left too. Theo again lingered this time watching the Dark Lady from the safety of shadows. He was the only one there to see her reclaim the ring. He watched as she slipped it onto her right index finger, raising her clasped hands as if in prayer to gently caress the ring with her lips. Theo watched her face intently as the mask of madness dropped, her eyes closing tightly to hold back the weakness of tears.</p><hr/><p> </p>
