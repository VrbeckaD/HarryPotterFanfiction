          <div class="userstuff"><p>“Hey girl!” Marlene greeted her. “How’s it going?”</p><p>“It’s crazy busy,” Lily replied, slumping into the chair opposite from Marlene’s. “The final edits are due Friday.”</p><p>“Glad you still managed to squeeze in a lunch with me.”</p><p>Lily flashed her a smile. “Does me good to get out of the flat.”</p><p>A waitress arrived to take their orders and returned a moment later with their drinks.</p><p>“Oh, someone posted a screen cap of your Instagram on Twitter,” Marlene told Lily, resuming their conversation.</p><p>“Ugh. What about?”</p><p>“You were throwing major shade on some wanker creeping on your selfies. Everyone on Twitter was applauding you.”</p><p>“Ah, that. Pro tip: don’t start shit with people who wrangle with words for a living.” Lily smirked. “Some guy was so impressed by my comeback he wanted to marry me.”</p><p>“Seriously?”</p><p>“Uh-huh.” Lily pulled out her phone and searched her Instagram for the comment. “See for yourself.”</p><p>There was, in fact, a heart-eye emoji followed by the words <strong>“marry me”</strong>, but it was the person who’d posted the comment that had Marlene’s eyes bugging out.</p><p>“Lily,” she gasped, grabbing the phone, “that’s not ‘some guy’, that’s <em>James Potter</em>!”</p><p>Lily frowned. “Who?”</p><p>“Um, the footballer?” Marlene retorted, the sentiment of ‘well duh’ plain in the tone of her voice.</p><p>“You know I don’t follow sports.”</p><p>Marlene shook her head, and clicked to open his profile.</p><p>“James Potter,” she said emphatically, handing Lily’s phone back.</p><p>Lily rolled her eyes but looked down at her phone. She tried not to stare at the photos.</p><p>“He’s fit,” she commented, hoping she sounded neutral.</p><p>“No shit. You have to reply.”</p><p>“And say what?”</p><p>“’Sure, when’s the wedding?’ Maybe add a winky face.”</p><p>“<em>No</em>, Marlene.”</p><p>“Why not? You two could be the new Posh and Becks! Oh, <em>oh</em>! You could be the <em>LilyPot</em>.”</p><p>“I can’t believe I’m having this conversation,” Lily muttered, before glaring at Marlene. “It’s not gonna happen!”</p><p>Lily clicked reply, then began to type. “<strong>’I’m flattered, but I’m not looking to get married right now.’</strong>”</p><p>Marlene pouted. “My suggestion was better.”</p><p>Lily ignored her.</p><p>Their food arrived, and Lily was about to start eating when her phone screen lit up.</p><p>“Huh, Potter commented back.”</p><p>“Gimme!” Marlene snatched Lily’s phone. “<strong>’Fair enough. How about dinner?’</strong> Ooh, he really must fancy you!”</p><p>“Shut up. …Wait, are you <em>typing</em>?!”</p><p>“I’m saving your love life.”</p><p>“<em>Marlene!</em>”</p><p>Lily grabbed her phone back, and saw that Marlene had replied with:<strong> ‘Are you buying? ;)’</strong></p><p>“Really, Marlene?” Lily groaned. “The winky face?”</p><p>Potter replied the same instant, distracting Lily.</p><p>
  <strong>‘Sure. Are you gonna tell me all about your new book?’</strong>
</p><p>Lily blinked. Marlene craned across the table to see what Lily was typing.</p><p>
  <strong>‘You read my books?!’</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>‘I’m a huge fan.’</strong>
</p><p>“See, Lily, you <em>have</em> to go out with him!” Marlene gushed.</p><p>“Because he’s a fan?”</p><p>“Because he’s a fit pro-footballer who fancies you!”</p><p>Lily bit her lip. One date wouldn’t hurt, right?</p><p>“Fine,” she conceded, and started to type her reply to Potter.</p><p> </p></div>
