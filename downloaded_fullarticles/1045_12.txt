          <div class="userstuff"><p>1. <em>Accio wedding cake</em> on the way out of Bill and Fleur's wedding.</p>
<p> - Pros: Cake is good!</p>
<p> - Cons: Might end up with a faceful of cake.</p>
<p>2. Can't create food by transfiguration, but you can increase it.</p>
<p> - Pros: Can re-enact the loaves and fishes scene from the Bible.</p>
<p> - Cons: Transfigured food taste like soggy cardboard.</p>
<p>3. Have Hermione put on a baseball cap and wander into a muggle grocery store to go shopping.</p>
<p> - Pros: Simple and easy.</p>
<p> - Cons: May be dementors about. Can't send Harry, as he's dementor bait, or Ron, as he can't navigate the muggle world.</p>
<p>4. <em>Confund</em> someone who just left a takeaway place into handing it over.</p>
<p> - Pros: Simple and easy.</p>
<p> - Cons: Statute of Secrecy violation.</p>
<p>5. Don't tell me Harry never learned to dumpster dive in his years of starvation and hiding from Dudley.</p>
<p> - Pros: Free Food!</p>
<p> - Cons: Have to find new dumpsters, because Death Munchers will have Little Whinging staked out.</p>
<p>6. Muggle hotel. Room service.</p>
<p> - Pros: Real beds! Hot food!</p>
<p> - Cons: Will they even let them through the door in their tattered unwashed clothes?</p>
<p>7. Apparate into a restaurant after hours. Steal much food and go.</p>
<p> - Pros: Low chance of getting caught.</p>
<p> - Cons: Harry and Ron have been to exactly zero muggle restaurants in his life, so this is all on Hermione.</p>
<p>8. Just walk into the damn pub somewhere in the muggle world and order bangers and mash.</p>
<p> - Pros: Nobody knows who they are.</p>
<p> - Cons: Put a <em>Silencio </em>on Ron, or he'll draw attention when he exclaims over that weird glowing box showing the people kicking a ball around the ground.</p></div>
