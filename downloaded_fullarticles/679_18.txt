    <p>Ser Arthur Dayne stood from the rock he was sat upon as he heard someone approaching from down the steps leading up to the tower behind him.</p><p> </p><p>"They're coming", said Ser Gerold Hightower, Lord Commander of the Kingsguard, as he approached Arthur. "Seven of them, Eddard Stark at their head, all on horse".</p><p> </p><p>"So what's the plan"? Asked Ser Oswell Whent, still perched on a rock, sharpening his sword.</p><p> </p><p>"I shall speak to the young Lord Stark", spoke a calm accented voice causing the three knights to turn and look at the foot of the steps. None of them had heard the man approach, he was thin and of average height, with pale white hair, a short scruffy beard and dull purple eyes. "I shall then accompany him and one of you three into the tower and to his sister, so he can observe her safety".</p><p> </p><p>"Who placed you in charge, priest "? Said Oswell, venom lacing his voice at the word priest.</p><p> </p><p>The man just smiled before replying, "the Lord of Light Ser. Of course My Lady would be best at speaking to the Lord, but she is currently indisposed, as you know".</p><p> </p><p>Just as he finished a cry came from the tower. Arthur's hand flew to the hilt of his sword before he took a breath and calmed himself.</p><p> </p><p>"Do not worry yourself, knight. Your sister is perfectly fine in the capable hands of My Lady and Lady Stark", the black clad priest said, turning a sympathising gaze upon Arthur.</p><p> </p><p>Suddenly the four men stilled and turned to the crest of a rocky ridge facing the tower. Seven men, stood beside seven strong looking horses, stood at the crest, looking down at the four men huddled around the steps to the tower. One of the seven men, of average height, and with long brown hair, lead his horse down the rocky slope towards the four. His six companions following him.</p><p> </p><p>The priest stood tall and walked to meet the men. "Lord Stark", he called to the man at the lead, his arms outstretched and welcoming. "I was beginning to think you never would have found us".</p><p> </p><p>Lord Stark looked the priest up and down before speaking, "well we did. And who are you Ser"?</p><p> </p><p>"Of course my Lord, where are my manners", the thin man said, while clasping his hands together in front of him and tilting his head into a bow. "My name is Rubeus of Lys, Red Priest to the Lord of Light, and sworn sword of My Lady, Melisandre of Asshai, Red Priestess to the Lord of Light".</p><p> </p><p>"Well priest, I'm hear to see my sister. Where is she"? Said Eddard, a hard tinge to his voice.</p><p> </p><p>"She is inside the tower my Lord, along with My Lady, and Lady Ashara. I will gladly take you to her, unfortunately I will have to ask your sworn men to wait out here, also for one of the knights behind me to come with. The Lady Ashara is giving birth you see, and we don't want all of your men to crowd her".</p><p> </p><p>Ned looked to his men, before turning back around and nodding his consent to Rubeus. Rubeus just smiled wider before spinning on his heel and leading Ned up to the tower. As the two men passed the three knights, Ser Arthur joined them in ascending the stairs, his greatsword in his right hand, with the hilt slung over his right shoulder.</p><p> </p><p>"Lord Stark", Arthur said, nodding to Ned.</p><p> </p><p>"Ser Arthur", Ned replied. "I was confused when you didn't show up at the Trident".</p><p> </p><p>"My prince wanted me here, so here I stayed".</p><p> </p><p>"The priest said your sister is with child", said Ned warily. "I hope her well".</p><p> </p><p>"Thank you Lord Stark, as do I".</p><p> </p><p>The three men came to a room at the very top of the tower. Pushing open the door slightly, Rubeus stuck his head into the room. A few seconds later he pulled his head back and turned to grin at the other two men.</p><p> </p><p>"You may go in my Lords, and my congratulations Ser Arthur. Your sister has had a boy".</p><p> </p><p>The two men entered the room. Before Ned could take two steps in though, he was bowled into by something small and fast. He looked down into wet grey eyes of his sister. Cupping her face, he brought her to his chest.</p><p> </p><p>"By the Gods Lya, I thought you lost". Spoke Ned.</p><p> </p><p>"I wont be taken from this world so easily Ned, you should know that by now", said Lyanna, her voice shaking.</p><p> </p><p>Looking up Ned watched as Arthur approached a bed in the centre of the room, upon which was lying the most beautiful woman Ned had ever seen, with a babe cradled in her arms. He jumped as something flicked his nose. Looking down he peered into the smiling face of his sister.</p><p> </p><p>"I thought you were a married man brother", Lyanna spoke, her voice full of mirth.</p><p> </p><p>"The young Lady is safe and well", a beautiful sing-song voice said from beside the bed.</p><p> </p><p>Again Ned looked to the bed, this time seeing a beautiful red haired woman in layers of red fabric stood next to it.</p><p> </p><p>"And who are you my Lady"? Ned asked politely.</p><p> </p><p>"I am Melisandre of Asshai", she said, "Red Priestess to the Lord of Light. And the woman who just helped bring the prophesied Prince that was Promised into this world".</p><p> </p><p>Before Ned could reply, the door burst open and his friend Howland Reed came running in. "Ned", he called, "twenty-two horses on the horizon, and approaching fast".</p><p> </p><p>"Any ideas who"? Asked Arthur, rising to his feet.</p><p> </p><p>Before Howland could reply, the red woman spoke for him. "Ser Jaime Lannister, along with Ser Gregor Clegaine and twenty Lannister men-at-arms".</p><p> </p><p>"How do you know this"? Asked Ned, cold steel in his voice.</p><p> </p><p>"The flames showed me", she replied. "Lord Tywin sent them after you when he realised where and who you were going to".</p><p> </p><p>"Why"? Asked Lyanna.</p><p> </p><p>"Because he wants you dead my Lady", said Rubeus. At the shocked looks around him he continued, "with you dead, King Robert will have to choose another wife. Lord Tywin hopes for that to be his daughter, Cersei".</p><p> </p><p>"Like Hells that'll happen", said Ned, drawing his sword, Arthur and Howland right behind him. Lyanna was about to follow them out of the room but Rubeus placed a hand on her arm. Shaking his head, he put his other hand on the ruby encrusted hilt of a sword at his waist. Before following the other men out of the tower.</p><p> </p><p>----------</p><p> </p><p>The four men came out of the tower, joining the other seven at the base.</p><p> </p><p>"Allow me to try speaking to Ser Jaime first my Lords", said Rubeus as he took a few steps past the others.</p><p> </p><p>Gerold just shrugged his shoulders before looking to Ned, "it worked last time".</p><p> </p><p>Rubeus smiled and walked towards the approaching men, riding their horses down the ridge. "My Lords", he said. "You're all quite a ways from home".</p><p> </p><p>A giant of a man turned to a much smaller blonde man sat next to him, "we don't have time for this".</p><p> </p><p>The blonde man nodded, before calling, "Tybolt, Lucas remove him".</p><p> </p><p>Two men climbed down from their horses before drawing their swords and approaching Rubeus. Just as they reached him, Rubeus' hand flew to the hilt of his sword, drawing it in the blink of an eye. In the same movement of drawing his sword he smashed the pommel into the unprotected face of the man to his right, following the move with taking the hilt in both hands and slashing the blade across the chest of the man to his left. He ended in a slight bent of position, his right side facing the horsemen, the tip of his crimson coloured blade, light reflecting of it in such a way that it looked as if it was aflame, pointed towards Jaime's chest.</p><p> </p><p>Out of the corner of his eyes he saw two men flank his sides. To his left was Ned and to his right Arthur.</p><p> </p><p>The twenty men still a-horse all drew their swords as one, the scraping sounding loud and high in the silence of the desert.</p><p> </p><p>Arthur slid his helm onto his head before taking Dawn in both hands and heaving it up, the blade resting on his shoulder.</p><p> </p><p>"And now it begins".</p>
