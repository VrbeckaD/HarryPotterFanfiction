    <p>Hermione shook her wrist out, sighing loudly. She skimmed over her five feet of scroll on the morality of using the Veritaserum potion on an unwilling participate. She nodded slightly as her eyes roved over it. Overall it seemed okay. There was still something that seemed missing.</p>
<p>“Still at it, Granger?” a voice called softly. Hermione twisted in her chair. Sleek white-blonde hair, a slender frame, and a forced nonchalant stance. Malfoy.</p>
<p>“Just finishing up.” Hermione replied tartly. She was still unaccustomed to Malfoy treating her like anything other than a worm. The demure Malfoy was one she didn’t quite know how to contend with. Hermione had been given the choice to return for her seventh year at Hogwarts, Malfoy had not. She still could not tell how he felt about the opportunity. Here he was speaking to her, and not down to her, so he must have felt some sort of repentance. Hermione fiddled with her quill.</p>
<p>“Have you finished yours, yet?” she asked, attempting to soften her tone. He leaned against a bookcase, hands jammed far into his pockets.<br/> “I still have a bit left.” He admitted.</p>
<p>“I could review it for you? You could review mine as well. I could use another pair of eyes on this one section.” Hermione pointed near the bottom of her long scroll. He met her eyes for a moment, assessing. They were not the only two that had returned for their final year, but were the only ones that happened to be taking Potions at a N.E.W.T level.</p>
<p>“Alright.” Malfoy obliged, moving to sit across from her. He handed her his rolled up scroll. Hermione began scribbling notes along his parchment in red quill, nose nearly touching the paper. Neither spoke for a few long minutes.</p>
<p>“You got the date of the Silvius case wrong. It was 1984, not 83. But once you correct that, your spelling and fill out the last section, I think that Slughorn will be very pleased.” Hermione handed his roll back.</p>
<p>“I think if you added a bit about the risks of tainted Veritaserum, that would balance out this section.” Malfoy said, handing back her essay. Hermione slapped her forehead lightly.</p>
<p>“Yes! Thank you. That is exactly what I was missing.” Hermione wasted no time, flipping the large tome next to her to the section on failure cases and began writing immediately.</p>
<p>She had expected Malfoy to leave, but he stayed, working silently on his own essay, the only sound being the scratching of the quills against the thick parchment.</p>
<p><em>What a wonder.</em> She thought. <em>I’m sitting here in the Hogwarts Library with Draco Malfoy. </em>If she could go back in time and tell her eleven year old self that she’d be finishing up a homework assignment with that horrible blond boy after they had been on different sides of a war…. Well it was honestly too surreal.</p>
<p>Hermione shook out her wrist once again, eyes gliding over the new work. Much better. Her arguments were sound and thoughtful. Fully exploring both sides. Slughorn would be pleased, she knew. They were to brew it this year for their final N.E.W.T level potion, and before that it was important to consider all the moral ramifications.</p>
<p>“Yes, thank you, Malfoy. This is much better.” She smiled at him and he frowned a little.</p>
<p>“Don’t get used to me helping you, Granger.” he replied. His words were hard, but his tone was soft. Hermione stared at him thoughtfully, chewing on her lip. All of his friends were gone. Not a single one had come back to finish their final year. And being a former Death Eater was not the point of pride as it had been several years ago. Could it be that the once great and prideful Malfoy was lonely? Hermione felt a sudden stab of pity for the boy.</p>
<p>“Would you like get dinner together in the Great Hall, Malfoy?” She asked, regretting the words as they left her mouth. It would be better to just not get involved at all. Malfoy didn’t bother to restrain his surprised expression.</p>
<p>“It’s a little late, so your friends are probably already finished. I would love to discuss our upcoming Potions work anyway.” Hermione continued. Malfoy continued to stare, his mouth slightly open in confusion.<br/> <em>Well at least I’m trying.</em> Hermione thought crossly, gripping her quill.<br/> “Yeah alright.” He replied finally.</p>
<p>Thus began an uneasy alliance between the Gryffindor and Slytherin. Often they would sit together, arguing amicably about different school subjects, carefully maneuvering their discussion around current events. Some things were better off not spoken about.</p>
<p>At first there were whispers, it was rare to see people from different houses eating together, but two people that had fought on opposite sides of a war? Perhaps due to Hermione’s celebrity or Malfoy’s notoriety, the whispers died down. Some of the other seventh years even began to sit with the pair on occasion.</p>
<p>“What’s this?” Malfoy asked one breakfast as a heavy letter dropped on his head.<br/> “Oh that’s Pig!” Hermione called excitedly as a tiny owl buzzed around their head for a moment before landing on the table. She fed him some toast, which he gobbled down quickly before setting off again. Malfoy handed her the letter.</p>
<p>“From Weasley, I presume?” He asked, his voice strained a little. Perhaps it hurt to be reminded of those that fought against him in the war? Hermione wondered.</p>
<p>“Yes, it seems so.” She ripped open the letter with relish and began reading quickly, a smile plastered on her face.</p>
<p>“Surprised you and Weasel haven’t already tied the knot.” Malfoy mumbled, stabbing a sausage with his fork. “I bet he can’t wait to have you shooting out enough red headed babies to fill a whole Hogwarts classroom.” Hermione glanced up from the letter, a sour expression on her own face.</p>
<p>“Shut up, Malfoy.” Hermione gritted out. Malfoy looked away, a clear struggle on his face between being appropriately abashed and overly prideful.</p>
<p>“Merlin, calm down, Granger. It was a joke.” He sniffed. She slammed the letter down on the table and stood up. Several people glanced over, startled by the early disruption.</p>
<p>“You’re horrible.” was all she could muster, tears filling her eyes as fled the Great Hall, leaving her things as she hastily exited. Malfoy watched her her leave, confusion filling him. He glanced down at the crumpled letter. He grabbed it quickly, having debated whether or not to read it for only a moment.</p>
<p>“Merlin…” he murmured. He had put his foot straight into his mouth. Ronald Weasley had met someone else.</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>Hermione wandered the halls aimlessly, her sleeves soaked from her attempts to wipe away her tears. How long ago was it that Ron had asked for her hand? Four? Five months ago? She hadn’t even said no! Just that the timing hadn’t been right. After she took her N.E.W.Ts, and got a job. It was just too soon for them. He had just started his auror training…. Hermione’s head was going in circles. But now he had met someone. Love at first sight. As if that’s a real thing. Hermione reached into her robes to read the note again, but groaned when she realized she had left it down stairs. No doubt Malfoy had read it by now. His insults at the ready for the next time he saw her.</p>
<p>Hermione paced the floor. Questions pounding through her head. Did Harry know? Had he and Ginny kept this from her or was it really as whirlwind as Ron had said in his letter? He had only gone on his first solo Auror mission two weeks ago! Had it happened then?<br/> <em>If only I could go back. </em>Hermione thought sadly.<em> If I could go back, I’d say yes. <em>I need Time.</em></em> That thought circled repeatedly as Hermione paced and let herself wallow. She wiped at her face again, her soaked sleeves only irritating her cheeks.</p>
<p>“Oh!” a surprised yelp left her mouth as Hermione suddenly realized she was pacing in front of a door. The Room of Requirement. “I didn’t even realize…” Hermione murmured, eyeing the door cautiously. She had been asking for more time, she realized. Curious, Hermione decided to peek inside. How had it decided to answer her request?</p>
<p>An audible gasp left her lips as Hermione was greeted with a dark cavernous room full of Time Turners. The golden charms twinkled in the the odd blue light from torches stuck in sconces. Hermione eyed the shelves of Time Turners cautiously. There were less here than she had seen in the Department of Mysteries, but more than there should be. As far as Hermione knew, Time Turners were highly regulated pieces of equipment. How had the room produced them?</p>
<p>
  <span>“Interesting way to help, but not quite right.” Hermione told the room, gently fingering one of the Time Turners. The most she could do with one of these was go back far enough to punch herself in the face, take the letter, and burn it before it could be read. As if that would solve anything.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>This particular Time Turner was odd looking, though. Rather than gold, it was a cold silver on a delicate black chain. Hermione pulled it down to examine. The runes along the sides weren’t immediately decipherable. Right in the middle there was hole that the sand had to pour around. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Curious…” Hermione held it up to her face to examine it, careful to keep it from twisting in her hand. She had never seen one like this before. Carefully, she placed it back on the shelf. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’ll have to read up on this room a bit more if I can.” Hermione told herself. As far as she knew, it couldn’t create matter. Just move it around. Which did not explain where these Time Turners had come from.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The room was much larger than it had appeared in their fifth year, extending far back, beyond what she could see. The Time Turners only occupied the frontmost area of the room. Glancing up, Hermione noticed that the ceiling was also high enough to be shrouded in darkness.</span>
</p>
<p>“Lumos” Hermione whispered, her wand tip suddenly bright. It didn’t seem to help much, though. The darkness held an almost oppressive quality, broken only by the blue flame torches scattered along the walls. Although she knew better, Hermione felt her feet moving her further into the room. She was clever and cautious. It would be fine. And she needed something to distract her at the moment anyway. After a while she glanced back, noticing that the shimmering light of the Time Turners was only a speck now. The room had grown colder, the air more still. In the distance she saw something.</p>
<p>A door, she realized, coming closer. It wasn’t anything fancy or foreboding. Just a plain looking wooden door, with no indication on it of where it led.</p>
<p>“There are hundreds…” Hermione said out loud, her words sounding muffled on the still air. Hundreds of doors lined the wide hallway now. All looked the same with no discernable differences. She wandered back a ways, hoping to find a rune or anything that would tell her what these doors meant or where they led. Hermione patted her robes, looking to find a loose quill and parchment to take notes, but to no avail.</p>
<p><em>I left my bag with Malfoy.</em> She realized with a curse. She waved her wand around, trying a few spells. The Revealing Charm revealed nothing. Neither did Detect Magic. Hermione tapped her wand against her lips thoughtfully. She could open one door. She wouldn’t step through. Just open it. It seemed likely that these doors led to elsewhere in the castle. A sort of short cut.<br/> Hermione cautiously placed her hand on a handle. It didn’t burn or hurt her, but felt as average as it looked. She twisted and pulled the door open with ease. Relief filled her as she realized she had been correct. Hermione was staring out at the entrance to the Great Hall. The door was just a short cut.</p>
<p><br/> Perhaps Malfoy was still there, or he had left her things. It would be easier to step through than go all the way back down. Hermione chewed her lip thoughtfully. However tempting, it was unwise to step through a mysterious door, even if the result seemed familiar. Before she could pull back, Hermione felt a pair of hands firmly press into her back and push her through the door.</p>
