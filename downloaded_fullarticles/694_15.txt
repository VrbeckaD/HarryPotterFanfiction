    <p>Lost</p><p>Chapter 1: Running</p><p>Run. Just run. Don’t look behind you. Don’t think about where you’re going to end up. Just run. Escape.<br/>
Through rough terrain and over patches of loose stones, where she almost lost her footing several times, she ran. Then a forest appeared and she knew this would either be salvation or her eventual downfall. Zig-zagging through trees the sound of footsteps behind her grew more and more distant. But still she ran.<br/>
After several hours continuously on the move she reached a fence and heard a noise beyond, a deafening roar filled the air.  Heat surrounded her and she felt for sure she must have entered hell. </p><p>Charlie Weasley had reached a point of seniority in his career that he could pretty much pick and choose what tasks he did on a day to day basis. Whilst he still loved the thrill of wrangling a particularly ornery dragon as he had grown older he began to enjoy some of the slower jobs to wind down at the end of the day. One of these was walking the perimeter of the sanctuary to ensure all the fencing was secure and that nothing could get in or out overnight. Poaching had been a problem through the war as dragon scales and blood found its way to the black market, and so this task had been added to the rota. Usually handed out to a junior handler, Charlie often offered to swap and enjoy the time to walk and think.<br/>
Deciding to transfer to the Irish reserve from Romania following the end of the war had been the best move for Charlie as it enabled him to be closer to his family following the loss of Fred. The slower pace and focus on raising young dragons bred in captivity rather than the rescue and rehabilitation of wild dragons meant he had more time to have a life outside of the sanctuary. If he chose to.<br/>
As he neared the enclosure of one of the few older dragons housed on base Charlie could sense she was unsettled. The old Welsh Green began by batting her wings in a state of agitation before letting out a fearsome cry in the direction of the outer wall of her enclosure. Next was a fireball sent to the same spot. Charlie immediately grabbed one of the brooms from the emergency hut, which were stationed at regular intervals throughout the sanctuary and were fully equipped for any possible event. He kicked off into sky above the enclosure and over the perimeter fence. It wasn’t until he’d flown to edge of the forest that backed onto the reserve that he spotted what had so clearly upset the dragon.<br/>
Whilst he had expected to see a gang of poachers approaching, instead he saw a lone figure lying on the floor. Clad in what could only be described as armour they were covered in dirt and debris that was clearly from the forest. He flew lower to get a better look and began to notice certain details: the figure appeared to be holding a wand but he could see it was bent at an odd angle. He could also see the figure was female not only from her shape but it was increasingly obvious that a large amount of her hair had escaped from the elastic she had previously secured it with. Long dark curls covered her back and as he flew lower still he realised he recognised them. </p><p> </p><p>Hermione Granger slowly became aware that she was in fact lying on a proper bed and not on the roll up mat in her tent as was the norm. She also became aware that she was wearing clean clothes and the only thing she could smell was chemical rather than her usual woodsey odour. She slowly blinked open her eyes. White. Sterile. A hospital then. Did this mean she had been caught?<br/>
As more of her faculties came back to her she began an assessment of her body, her feet moved. Her legs. Her fingers and her arms she realised weren’t shackled which seemed promising. As she turned her head she noticed a jug of water on the table beside the bed. Slowly she sat up and reached for it, just as she grabbed the handle of the jug and lifted it up off the table surface the door to the room opened with a bang, startled she jumped and promptly dropped the jug of water spilling it to the floor. </p><p>‘Shit!’</p><p>She turned suddenly to where the noise had come from and saw a broad shouldered, red headed man with a fang earring, dressed in   khaki trousers and a dark blue long sleeved pullover. Hermione blinked once, then a second time before frowning at the door. </p><p>‘ I know you?’ Her voice was dry and scratchy from lack of use and exhaustion. ‘Why do I think I know you?’ </p><p>He walked slowly towards out to show he wasn’t a threat ‘you do know me. It’s Charlie. Weasley’ she still looked confused. He tried again ‘Ron’s brother.’ </p><p>A hint of recognition flashed across her face ‘Ron...’ she whispered the name to herself reassuringly. She tried again but this time she whispered ‘Charlie...’ </p><p>He continued to approach the bed and waved his wand to clear the spilled water from the floor and refill the jug. He handed her a glass of water which she accepted and guzzled down greedily deep in thought. </p><p>‘Hermione?’ She lifted her head to stare at him again.<br/>
‘Hermione? That’s my name?’ She was quiet and vulnerable. </p><p>‘You don’t remember.’ It wasn’t a question. ‘Yes your name is Hermione Granger. You’re 25 years old and you work as an independent curse breaker and investigator. You’re at the Bolus Head Dragon Sanctuary in Ireland. I found you near the perimeter fence unconscious. What do you remember?’ </p><p>‘I was being chased. But I can’t remember why. My wand was broken so I couldn’t apparate out. I think I banged my head, that’s why I have blank spots. But the more I look at you, the more familiar you seem. That’s got to be a good thing right?’ She smiled at him. </p><p>‘I’m sure it will all come back to you. I can go and get the sanctuary healer to check you over if you like? And I assume you’re probably hungry?’ </p><p>‘Yes please. To both’ she smiled again. He rather thought it suited her.</p>
