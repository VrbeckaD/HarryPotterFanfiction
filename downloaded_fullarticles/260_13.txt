He’ll lay there for a little while, keeping his body entirely still. </p><p>All of his limbs will be wrapped snugly around Draco; their bodies pressed together in one long line of heat. </p><p>Next, Harry begins to move his hand.

Harry likes to stroke his lover’s sharp cheekbones and run his thumb over pert, pink, slightly-parted lips. </p><p>And that is when Draco awakens, one grey eye drifting open after the other. </p><p>“<em>Stay</em>,” Draco murmurs.</p></div>
