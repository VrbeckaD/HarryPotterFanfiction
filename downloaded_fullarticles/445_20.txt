    <p>“Mummy got sick and it happened, just like that, and there was nothing anybody could do. If we start asking why we'll go mad.  So, rule number one: we don't ask why.”</p><p>Astoria died shortly after their sixth wedding anniversary, on a cool day in late June, with Draco and Daphne at her side and Scorpius curled around her feet like a sleeping cat. Though she was his wife's sister and his close friend's wife, there was no love lost between Draco and Daphne. Despite the fact that their past was filled with a range of disagreements, the pair had long ago set aside their differences for Astoria’s sake and now tolerated each other with what looked a bit like affection if one were to squint. Daphne had even moved into the manor during Astoria’s last weeks so she and Draco could spell each other off, ensuring that the pale, dark haired witch they both loved would never be alone.</p><p>Astoria’s illness had been a long decline, the degradation and eventual disappearance of her magic over a period of months in a manner that left healers baffled and Draco making reckless pleas to any deity who might still take pity on him. If the gods existed they were not listening - Astoria had spoken her last words before falling into a sleep from which her breathing slowed, almost imperceptibly, to an end.</p><p>It took three months for Draco to enter the master bedroom again, and even still, he couldn’t bring himself to sleep in their bed. When Astoria moved into the manor she had made it home not just for herself, but for Draco as well. </p><p>Narcissa and Lucius had moved abroad following the latter’s release from Azkaban, leaving the palatial family home empty and cold in their wake and a twenty-two year old Draco at loose ends.<br/>
He had re-ignited his acquaintance with Astoria at one of Pansy’s Slytherin Gatherings, then spent an entire year courting her and convincing her family to accept his proposal before they were finally engaged. It took another year for them to marry, but from the day she moved in to the manor Astoria had been waving her wand and setting things to rights. The pallor of despair that had settled over its many rooms following Voldemort’s occupation began to fade in the face of the diminutive witch; the dark, foreboding atmosphere had been transmuted by her love of plants and music, her laughter.  When they found out (a mere month into their marriage) that they were going to have a child, they had fun picking out his room, collecting furniture and decorating, climbing high into their respective family trees to see who could suggest the worst ancestral name for their son:</p><p>“Kriemhild”</p><p>“Caractacus”</p><p>“Brutus”</p><p>Despite her death, Astoria was still everywhere in the manor, a ghost he hadn’t the heart to exorcise. Without her plants died, music sounded flat, and Draco forgot to open the curtains.</p><p>On the one year anniversary of her death, he decided it was no longer bearable. He packed up their essentials, shut the manor, and moved with Scorpius to a townhome in a wizarding area called The Phoenix District, an “up-and-coming area for the modern witch and wizard nestled covertly within the trendy muggle area of Shoreditch” according to their letting agent. It was also home to an “integrative” primary school bringing together wizarding and muggle-born families under a banner of tolerance. Astoria had always been firm in her belief that Scorpius should never know the prejudices of his paternal ancestors and Draco felt that in her absence he would have to soldier on alone with what they had planned.</p><p>Which is how he found himself dropping Scorpius off at his first day of primary school, suddenly unable to let go of his son’s hand.</p><p>“Papa?” Scorpius asked, tentatively tugging to see if he could pry his fingers out of Draco’s grip. He couldn’t. “Papa, can we go inside now?”</p><p>Draco blinked down at his son - he had the Malfoy hair, though it had picked up a slight wave by way of the Greengrass’ genetics so that it curled around the ears and temples of his pale little face. Eyes that were the same shade of blue as Astoria’s peered up at Draco with concern, and he felt a lurch of guilt at his own selfishness.</p><p>“Sorry Scorpius. Of course we can go inside.” He let the small boy lead him toward a row of cubbies; they found the one inscribed with Scorpius’ name in neat, precise handwriting, stowing his satchel and jacket before exchanging his wellies for soft-soled trainers. When Scorpius ran ahead of Draco into the classroom he felt a brief panic of loss, stumbling slightly as he hastened to follow.</p><p>His graceless entrance nearly brought him crashing straight into Hermione Granger.</p><p>“Malf - Draco.” She said in surprise, nearly dropping the hand of the child at her side. </p><p>“Hermione.” He intoned politely, taking her lead in using first names. Her hair was styled shorter than it had been at Hogwarts, a cloud of neat curls rising up from her head. She wore a black robe open at the front over a purple dress and deep raspberry lipstick that looked lovely against her brown skin. Draco could not recall Hermione ever seeming so put together or confident in school, and he felt rather more intimidated by her now than he had as a boy.</p><p>“Is this your son?” She asked, then laughed “Sorry, of course he is, the hair is as much a giveaway as Rosie’s. Can’t escape those Weasley genes.” </p><p>The child beside her who was evidently named Rosie looked up. “Mummy, who’s this man?”</p><p>“This is Draco Malfoy, Rose. He was in the same year as daddy, Uncle Harry, and I at Hogwarts.” </p><p>Even though he hadn’t seen Potter in twelve years, Draco’s chest tightened slightly, surprising him with the reaction a mere mention had conjured.</p><p>Rose turned serious brown eyes on Draco. “You know my mummy from school?” She asked skeptically, as though she didn’t quite believe Hermione had acquaintances with whom Rose was not familiar.</p><p>“I do, though we were in different houses.” Draco said, already anticipating her reaction when she found his out.</p><p>“What one were you in?”</p><p>“Slytherin.”</p><p>“Oh.” She rolled her eyes. “Freddie is in Slytherin too. Everyone was all upset about it but then they realized they were just being babies.”</p><p>“Freddie is her cousin - George and Angelina’s son.” Hermione explained, before turning to Scorpius. “I don’t think we’ve been introduced.” </p><p>“Scorpius.” Draco said. “I’d like you to meet Hermione Granger.”</p><p>The small boy thrust out his hand and said, in a quiet voice. “Pleased to meet you.”</p><p>“And you, Scorpius.” Hermione gave him a friendly smile. “Are you seven like Rosie?”</p><p>“In November.” Scorpius said. Rose looked over at him as though it was the first time she had noticed he was there.</p><p>“We’re in the same class?” She said disbelievingly - Draco was beginning to think that curious skepticism was her default setting.</p><p>Scorpius nodded shyly, but Rose held out her hand.</p><p>“Come on, we’ll be friends. I didn’t know anyone either, when I started, and you’re too small to be left alone.” She said, pulling him with her into the circle of children that had begun to form on the rug in front of their teacher.</p><p>“Don’t worry, it gets easier every time you drop them off.” Hermione said reassuringly as she saw the expression on Draco’s face. “Rosie has been coming to school here since she was five, and I thought I’d pass out the first time I watched her walk away from me.”</p><p>Embarrassingly, Draco felt his eyes begin to well up as Scorpius looked back at him long enough to offer a brief smile and wave before turning around again.</p><p>“Fancy a cup of tea?” Hermione asked suddenly, a slight pink tinge of embarrassment rising in her cheeks when he looked at her in shock. “Only I know how difficult it is, on the first day.”</p><p>Draco found he really did need something hot to drink and it turned out Hermione was surprisingly good company They ended up at a trendy wizard coffee shop with which Hermione seemed quite familiar - she ordered a latte that came in a large glass mug with a handle. Draco ordered chamomile tea with honey and a bit of milk, following her over to one of the tables by the window. </p><p>“Do you live in the area?” Hermione asked when they had both settled into their seats.</p><p>“We just moved here a few weeks ago.” Draco replied, wishing his tea would cool down enough to drink. “I wanted to be close enough to Scorpius’ school that we could walk there in the mornings, it saves time as a single parent.”</p><p>Hermione’s face grew serious. “I heard about Astoria, Draco. I'm so sorry.”</p><p>He shrugged. “It...wasn’t unexpected.”</p><p>“That doesn’t make it any easier.” Hermione hesitated for just a second, then placed her hand gently on his arm. “Grief is never easy.”</p><p>“So you’re married to Weasley are you?” Draco asked after a moment, when the tears that sprang to his eyes at her kind touch had dissipated.</p><p>Hermione smiled fondly. “Married with not one but two sprogs. Rosie’s the oldest, and then there’s Hugo who is one. As you can tell, Rosie already has a mind of her own, but you don’t have to worry about Scorpius once she’s decided he’s her friend.”</p><p>“Do you and Weasley both work at the ministry?”</p><p>“I do, but Ron doesn’t - he was an auror for about three years but hated it. Now he works with George at Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes and looks after Hugo.”</p><p>Draco desperately wanted to ask after Potter, but couldn’t bring himself to utter the words. He tried to silently will Hermione to reveal even a tidbit of information about her friend, but she seemed almost deliberately elusive, instead volleying the question of careers back at him.</p><p>“Blaise and I work together, he runs a potions business and I do most of the brewing. We're relatively successful.” This was an understatement on Draco's part, but he had grown up too much to brag.</p><p>A chime sounded from Hermione’s purse at that moment, and she dug around inside before producing a small, black plastic device with an opaque screen. She tapped the surface and it lit up, revealing text far too small for Draco to read.</p><p>“Damn, my meeting with the minister has been moved up and I’m about to be late!” She said, shooting out of her seat so fast she nearly upended her drink. “Sorry to run out on you, Draco, but it took me forever to get this meeting with Kingsley in the first place.”</p><p>“No bother - it was nice to see you again, Hermione.” Draco said, and was surprised to realize he meant it.</p><p>“We’ll continue this another day.” She promised as she rushed out the door.</p><p>Draco looked over at her untouched latte curiously, then exchanged his mug of tea for it and took a sip.</p>

</center>“Do you think they’ll like me?” Anthony asked, leaning over to check his hair in the mirror above the mantelpiece.<p>“Well, Ron and Hermione already know you and they think you’re fantastic. Mrs. Weasley will love you because I do. Luna doesn’t hate anyone. Don’t let the blokes get to you, and all you’ll have left is Ginny - you must remember her from our school days?” Harry paused, then decided to be truthful. “She’s the worst of the lot, really.”</p><p>Anthony gave him a playful shove as though Harry was joking. “Alright, I think I can handle that.”</p><p>Harry had his doubts, but he folded them up and shoved them into the back of his mind where he kept the tiny, nagging worry that he and Anthony were making a mistake getting engaged so early. Hermione had told him a thousand times that he self-sabotaged due to childhood trauma and not believing he deserved anything good. Anthony was something good.</p><p>“Am I what they had in mind?” Anthony asked, an uncharacteristically vulnerable look on his face.</p><p>Harry leaned forward and kissed him. “They’re going to love you. Ready?” Anthony nodded, took hold of his arm, and together they disapperated.</p><p>They landed just outside the perimeter of the Burrow and stepped through the wards, which easily admitted them. The front door flew open to reveal Molly Weasley’s smiling face.</p><p>“Hello boys!” She cried, enveloping Harry in a tight hug before she turned to Anthony. </p><p>“Pleased to meet your Mrs. Weasley.” He said, offering her his hand which she bypassed in favour of wrapping her arms around his shoulders.</p><p>“Call me Molly dear. Come on inside, the rest of the family is waiting.” She said, pushing both men through the door toward the dining room. Though Harry had been sure there would just be a few Weasleys to contend with, nearly the entire clan was assembled around a long table: Arthur at the head, Hermione and Ron with Rosie and Hugo, Ginny and Luna, Bill and Fleur, George and Angelina with Roxanne, Percy and Audrey with tiny little Molly the second. Charlie was still on assignment in Siberia, and the rest of the children were at school, but Anthony would meet them over Christmas after he had introduced Harry to his family at their Hanukkah celebration.</p><p>“Hullo.” Harry said to the room at large. “Everyone, this is Anthony. Anthony, everyone.” A glance at his fiance revealed that Anthony was slightly taken aback by the sheer number of people before him. He supposed that walking into a room with fifteen family members you hoped to impress might be a little daunting. Especially when you were an only child.</p><p>There was a cacophony of noise as everyone tried to introduce themselves at once. Ron pressed a beer into Harry’s hand as he and Anthony sat at the table.</p><p>“Brave man, your Anthony. Can’t say I’d face a crowd like this for you.”</p><p>“No, only an evil madman bent on destroying the world.” Harry retorted, clinking his bottle against Ron’s before taking a much needed drink. </p><p>“How’re you holding up, Tony?” Hermione asked kindly from his other side. She and Anthony worked together at the ministry and had been friends for years. “Don’t let them scare you off, they mean well. For the most part.”</p><p>Harry smiled his thanks to her and took another pull on the beer, indulging for a second in the comfort of his family. Arthur had fallen immediately into conversation with Anthony about his half-muggle upbringing, with Rosie listening intently from where she sat in her grandpa’s lap. Molly bustled around putting down plates of food with help from Percy and George. Angelina and Ginny were leaning across the table now to introduce themselves, the latter taking Anthony’s hand in her vice grip to shake it. Ever since they had broken up eleven years ago (coming out to each other in a flurry of laughter and tears) Ginny had been the most ferocious of the Weasleys, interrogating Harry’s dates whenever she got the chance. Harry had never been able to return the favour - it was clear that Ginny and Luna were well suited to each other. They had been together almost since Harry and Ginny had split up and Harry had officiated their wedding (in bright yellow robes he hoped never to see again) three years previous. </p><p>Once everyone was seated and had begun eating, Harry clinked his glass. “I have some news.” He began, taking Anthony’s hand. “I wanted you all to meet Anthony because, well, we’re engaged.”</p><p>There was a shock of silence before everyone started talking at once again.</p><p>“You’re engaged and you haven’t brought him to dinner before?” Molly demanded, chastising him in a loving but firm voice, happy tears in her eyes.</p><p>“When’s the wedding?” George asked, his mouth half full of bread.</p><p>“We should meet his parents, maybe you could invite them over next weekend.” Arthur suggested.</p><p>“It’s going to be a long engagement.” Harry said, raising his voice. “We didn’t - it sort of came out of nowhere, really. It just felt right, didn’t it Anthony?”</p><p>Anthony nodded. “I know it seems odd as we’ve only been seeing each other for a few months, but I really do love Harry. I hope you’ll see that as you get to know me.”</p><p>That did it - Molly was weeping openly now as she wrapped her arms around the pair of them. “Oh boys.” She sobbed against Harry’s shoulder.</p><p> </p><p>After dinner, Arthur brought Harry out to his toolshed for a chat - Anthony had been cornered by Rose who demanded he explain Hanukkah to her in detail after Harry had let slip he would be meeting the Goldstein family at that year’s celebration. </p><p>Once inside the shed, Arthur gestured to a worn looking stool as he leaned against the workbench which currently held a large satellite dish and two microwave ovens. Harry wasn’t entirely sure Arthur should be messing around with microwaves, but that didn’t seem to be the topic of discussion at hand.</p><p>“Listen Harry, I wanted to offer you my robes for the wedding.” He said, his ears going slightly pink the way Ron’s did when he was embarrassed. “It’s traditional for a wizard to wear his father’s robes, and seeing as you don’t have those I thought I would offer. All of my boys have been married in them, it only seems fitting that you would be as well.”</p><p>Harry felt his throat tighten with emotion. “Arthur, I’d be honoured.” </p><p>Arthur accioed a box from the rafters and drew forth a set of deep blue robes with slightly lighter blue trim. Unlike many of the other items that had made their way through the Weasley family, these were in pristine condition. Harry shrugged out of his sweater as Arthur draped the garment around him.</p><p>“Where did you and Anthony meet?” He asked, adjusting the robes around Harry’s shoulders.</p><p>“Well, he was in the DA but I was a little too busy to really get to know him. It’s funny, actually, his office is near Hermione’s - he works for the DMLE as a prosecutor. Hermione and I went to the cafeteria to order lunch one day when I was visiting her, and Anthony was behind us in line. We both got the same order, and I made a joke about how we were perfectly matched.”</p><p>“You know, when I met Molly - of course it was at Hogwarts, in my sixth year and her fifth. One day I just saw her, really saw her, for the first time. I was walking down the corridor to potions and suddenly this book landed at my feet. I bent down to collect it and so did she, so I ended up holding her hands. You know, I couldn’t tell where mine ended and hers began.” Arthur laughed self-consciously. “It felt more like magic than anything I had learned so far in school.”</p><p>Harry felt a funny twinge of insecurity in his chest at this, but he pushed it down. “And now you’ve been married for  -”</p><p>“Too many years to count.”</p><p>Harry reached up to straighten his glasses and there was a small ripping sound as the robes caught beneath his shoe and tore.</p><p>“Arthur, I’m so sorry.” He stuttered - here he was, destroying the family heirloom that had been so kindly given to him. “It’s bad luck!”</p><p>“Nonsense” Arthur said, waving his wand to repair the rip. “Do you remember Ron falling over his own feet trying to waltz with Hermione at their wedding? These robes have seen more than you and I put together.”</p><p>Harry winced - he had quite vivid memories of a very inebriated Ron swinging Hermione around the room at breakneck speed. It would have been hilarious had Harry not spent the subsequent half hour cleaning Ron’s vomit and feeding him sobering potions so he could consensually engage in his wedding night.</p><p>“Well then, I’d be honoured to continue the tradition.” He said, putting a hand on Arthur’s shoulder.</p>
