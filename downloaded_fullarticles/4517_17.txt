    <p>Lily could feel the glares coming from behind her, burning into her neck, as they had been for the past few days. She turned in her seat to find three pairs of eyes squinted in differing amounts of disgust.</p><p>Peter was sat, slumped low in his seat, shaking his head slightly while his eyes stayed pinned on her as he muttered to the other two sat at the table in the corner of the Gryffindor common room. Remus' glare wasn't quite as harsh as the other two but it held an element of disappointment that caused Lily's insides to squirm slightly. Sirius' chin was resting on his forearms on the table but his gaze held the most animosity, grey eyes cold and harsh from across the almost empty room. Lily turned away from the three marauders hastily, attempting to ignore the fact that they were still glaring.</p><p>Lily was sat by the fire in one of the armchairs, re-reading her transfiguration essay one final time before bed, where most of Gryffindor house were. The common room held a small huddle of fourth years playing exploding snap, two sixth years working on essays in the corner, the three marauders and Lily.</p><p>Lily hadn't seen James since their Head's meeting earlier that evening, where they'd worked through the prefects rotas and plans for the upcoming Christmas party. He'd disappeared as soon as it was over, not bothering to hang around and chat as they had been doing since the beginning of the year, something that had often led to them snogging each other in whatever room they occupied until Lily pulled away and left hurriedly. For the last few weeks though, James had been ignoring all of Lily's advances. She didn't know whether he was playing hard to get or whether her attempts were just falling flat. But it hurt…she liked James Potter…a lot…and she had thought he'd liked her…</p><p>"Evans."</p><p>Lily didn't turn in her seat at the sound of Sirius' voice from across the room. Though the common room itself did quiet considerably at the loud voice.</p><p>"Evans." He repeated when she didn't answer. "Fine…you don't have to talk but I will."</p><p>Lily sank down lower into her chair. They'd been pestering her about James ever since they walked in on them in the heads compartment on the train to Hogwarts. But their persistence was wearing Lily thin.</p><p>"You honestly think he's happy like this? He's not you know. Well you should know! This isn't what he wants. You've turned him into a toy you use whenever you want it. It's pathetic. You're pathetic."</p><p>"Sirius." Remus scolded.</p><p>"No Remus, I used to have a lot of respect for Lils but she's…she's being a bitch, a royal bitch to James and he doesn't deserve that."</p><p>Lily could feel the tightness in her chest that threatened tears, her throat was full, she felt dreadful.</p><p>She knew what this looked like to them, because it was only the other three marauders that knew anything was even going on. They'd caught them snogging all of three times and after each time, they would mercilessly tease her discreetly, probably thanks to James asking them not to make it public knowledge because he knew how she felt about it all…totally and utterly confused.</p><p>"Are you even listening Lily?" Peter asked aggressively. "You should be because…yeah. James is too good for this crap."</p><p>The tears were threatening to fall, but she bit her lip, slid further down in her armchair and focused on the flames that flickered in the fireplace.</p><p>"Fuck you Lily. You don't deserve him if you're going to just carry on treating him like this." Sirius told her and she heard a chair scrape, and then movements, bags being packed and then his voice was close, too close, above her chair.</p><p>"Just grow up Lily. It's not hard. It should be easy!" Sirius said sternly.</p><p>Lily snapped, her hands clenched around the essay she was holding and she stood from her chair, turning to face the three boys who were still glaring disapprovingly at her.</p><p>"Maybe it should be easy but its fucking not! And you're not helping at all Black!" Her voice was high, screeching almost and her tears had fallen from behind her lids.</p><p>"And you two! None of you are helping! I don't understand any of it! So if you would just piss off and-and just…leave me alone!" Her voice had grown in volume, reverberating around the common room as the three marauder's glares fell to pity.</p><p>"Lily-." Remus began.</p><p>"Just fuck off." Lily sighed as she watched the other kids in the common room quickly scarper away up the dormitory stairs, though there was a hold up on the boys and Lily watched in horror as the tanned legs of James Potter made their way down between those ascending.</p><p>She quickly turned falling into her seat once more, she didn't want to see him, didn't want him to see her like this. Her tears had stopped as abruptly as they had started and she sat with her hands over her face, attempting to hide from what was going on around her. She hadn't wanted this. Why couldn't things ever be easy?</p><p>"What the fuck are you doing?" James demanded of the room somewhere behind her.</p><p>"Just looking out for you mate." Sirius muttered, and Lily heard footsteps moving away from her and moving up the staircase.</p><p>"Don't." James threatened, his voice closer as the footsteps became quieter and quieter until they'd disappeared completely.</p><p>Lily was breathing deeply through her nose, still hiding her face from James who she could feel watching her.</p><p>"Hey…" Came James' gentle tone from above her, it washed over her soothingly, seeping into her bones and veins and calming her ragged nerves.</p><p>She peeked up at him through her fingers and found him topless, in a pair of running shorts, his hair sleep ruffled and his glasses askew on his nose.</p><p>"Sorry about them." He told her, shrugging his shoulders and running a hand through his already mussed hair.</p><p>"Don't apologise." Lily scolded before wiping her cheeks with her knuckles and standing in front of him, wrapping her arms about herself awkwardly.</p><p>"Why? It's my fault they get like that." He told her stepping forward and wrapping his naked arms about her, her own arms trapped against the hot, tanned skin of his stomach where his muscles were hard and seemingly unending. "I tell them how I feel about…all of this." He said squeezing her gently. "And I think they get sick of my whining. So again…I'm sorry."</p><p>"Shut up James." Lily mutters against his skin.</p><p>"Sorry."</p><p>"Stop apologising." She told him, pulling back slightly to glare up at him only to find his heart warming smirk.</p><p>"Sorry." He whispers again and instead of chastising him one more time, Lily presses up on the balls of her feet and presses her lips to his. Her arms unwrap awkwardly from between them and she holds him close, his bare skin burning hot against her fingertips as he pulls her closer. Snogging James had become second nature to Lily over the course of the month or so they had been at it, but every time he overwhelmed her more and more. He made her feel the love she had lost after her parents were taken from her too soon. He makes her feel whole and light as a feather, makes her forget sadness and feel only hope. Lily pulls away and looks into his lust darkened eyes half hidden behind his glasses and feels her heart flutter as it has been doing for the past month whenever he's been near her.</p><p>Lily swallows deeply, feeling the nervousness that has haunted her for weeks, ever since the thought first popped into her head.</p><p>"James…" She sounds breathy and ridiculous but she pushes on, not wanting to keep ignoring what she wants. "James…go out with me?" She asks softly.</p><p>James' eyes widen behind their frames and his mouth falls open emitting a word she hadn't really expected to hear. "Fuck." It was whispered and reverent and brought a grin to his face that could have lit up the entire common room. And then those grinning lips are back against Lily's, demanding and incessant, pressing into her, tongue dancing against her own making her knees weak and the feel of his bare skin burning hotter and hotter.</p><p>"Wait you didn't give me an answer!" Lily demands, pulling away slightly and placing her forehead against his own, looking into his eyes, her eyelashes pushed against the glass of his glasses.</p><p>"Fuck wasn't enough?" He asked, his eyes crinkling upwards.</p><p>"Not even close." She tells him, her arms hugging him tighter even though she was hot, too hot to be this close to the fire and a half naked James Potter. "I mean I have no idea how you feel about me, it's not as though you've been trying as hard recently and -."</p><p>She's cut off as James moves quickly so that one of his hands is holding her chin, his face further away from her now so that she can see it in its entirety.</p><p>"I think…I'm pretty sure…I love you Evans." He tells her softly and smiles one of his awe inspiring smiles, the one that makes Lily feel like the only person in the world.</p><p>"Fuck…" She breathes out before colliding with him once more, teeth clashing and noses bumping as they proved to one another just how much they mean to one another.</p>
