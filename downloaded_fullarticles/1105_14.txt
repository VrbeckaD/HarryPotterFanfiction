    <p>The room was plain and sparsely furnished. There was medium sized wooden table with one wooden chair that tended to hurt the sitter’s back just as much as its appearance predicted. The table was bare except for a white paper bag and a quill hovering over a parchment scroll, steadily scratching across it and occasionally refreshing itself in a nearby inkwell. A young woman sat on the uncomfortable chair, chewing on something and twisting a finger through a dark brown curl. She was wearing fitted black jeans, red high-tops and a t-shirt with a beautiful unicorn proclaiming “Stab the Patriarchy” in glittery purple script. A dark blue robe was tossed casually over the back of the chair, promising to be very crumpled once it was retrieved. </p><p>It was six thirty in the evening and Hermione Granger was halfway through her third onion bhaji and the most excruciatingly humiliating experience of her twenty-six years.</p><p><b>So, you’re telling us removing the Mudblood does nothing?</b> The voice Hermione heard was tinged with irritation and frustration. It wasn’t a particularly friendly sounding voice but it wasn’t cartoonishly evil either. </p><p>Hermione took another savage bite of her dinner as she listened, the Dicotoquill steadily noting the conversation on the parchment lying next to her left elbow.</p><p><big><tt>What I’m telling you is my calculations show her removal has no effect on the particular events you are interested in. </tt></big>The second voice was patient, as if they were explaining a difficult problem to a child; such as the dangers of having five chocolate biscuits before dinner, or why burying five pence won’t eventually sprout a money tree. The second voice sounded a little tired.</p><p><b>But why not? Our research suggested without her, Potter would never had succeeded. </b>The first voice was back again, the tinges of irritation and frustration had grown stronger. </p><p><big><tt>It was the role she played that was important, not her as an individual. </tt></big>The second voice was still patient, but it also sounded a little patronising, </p><p><big><tt>You see,</tt></big> the unknown patiently patronising voice continued to explain,<big> <tt>in these thirty-six iterations of the formula she is replaced by this individual...Let’s see, Luna Lovegood. In these twenty it was..hmmm...a woman called Cho Chang and Parvati Patil in at least eight. The variable is always present in the equation. The individual that fulfils that variable is almost irrelevant.</tt></big></p><p>Hermione, who had always suffered from Imposter Syndrome, felt ill. And she didn’t think the sudden sinking feeling in her stomach was from the takeaway. </p><p>Irrelevant. Apparently she’d been <i>irrelevant.</i></p><p>That was a cheery thought. </p><p>In her career as an Unspeakable to this point, Hermione had worked hundreds of cases. There was always someone wanting to play with time, whether it was from grief, greed or even curiosity. There was no shortage of investigations into the illegal use of Time Turners.</p><p>About two years ago the department had begun to see a trend in individuals trying to go back further and further; days instead of hours, weeks instead of days, months instead of weeks. All these attempts had been linked to a group of extremists whose ideology aligned with the Death Eaters of the second War. They called themselves <i>The Eight</i>. No one was really altogether sure why, as there was more than eight of them, but it did make them easy to remember.</p><p>Time travel had previously been restricted to the type of device Hermione had been gifted while at Hogwarts. She grimaced as she remember the expressions of confusion as she’d discussed the device with her department colleagues. No other teenager, they had told her after her confession, that had got their hands on a Time Turner had ever used its powers to <i>study more.</i></p><p>“That’s our favourite swot in action” Declan had said teasingly. Everyone had laughed. Hermione had laughed as well, but wasn’t it telling she was now an adult and people were <i>still </i>making fun of her commitment to academics? Her mother had once soothingly told her much younger self that the children her own age “just didn’t get her” and when she grew up she’d “find her people”. </p><p>Hermione liked to think she was pretty grown up now, but she was yet to find “her people”. Maybe all her people were eighty years old, or in another country, or dead. The insecure voice at the back of her head liked to posit the idea—mostly at three o’clock in the morning when she was alone in bed—that the reason she hadn’t found “her people” was that they didn’t actually exist and she would always feel awkward and out of step with everyone. She hadn’t realised how much she’d coasted at school; unconsciously (consciously?) drafting on Harry and Ron’s friendship slipstream, until she’d tried making friends as an adult.</p><p>In any case, the older Time Turner devices worked due to the Hour Reversal spell contained within them. The device was shaped like an hourglass for aesthetics and familiarity. It didn’t matter what it looked like, so long as the spell inside could be could be activated. There were virtually none left in circulation outside the Time Room these days. Most Time Turners were destroyed during the Fantastical Department of Mysteries Fuck-up of 1996 (Hermione only called it that in her head, it was still too raw for Harry to joke about, despite the intervening years since Sirius’s death). </p><p>Nevertheless, research into time travel had continued, but exclusively within the Department of Mysteries. This meant there were less departmental resources wasted by wizards who popped back an hour to remind their past self to do something, who then accidentally screwed their time-line when they would inevitably give their younger selves a heart attack, followed by immediate panic and a second attempt to reverse time so they could be there to assist their older self in applying resuscitation spells to their rapidly expiring past self. Hermione preferred those cases to the second most common issue, which was delicately removing enormous plugs people had been intent on going back in time to insert into themselves.</p><p>The department had been trialing a particular project on an altered Time Turner design. They’d played on the hourglass idea and impregnated tiny crystals with the Hour Reversal spell, then placed these inside another device where they could be activated simultaneously. As a running joke that soon became permanent, they referred to it as Time Sand. The first attempt had been a success when an Unspeakable had safely travelled back three hours. She took the opportunity to eat all the chocolate digestives in the staff canteen before the mid-morning rush, this both proving the device was a success and also irritating half her colleagues. She’d returned to the present with a bellyache but a sense of self-satisfaction that more than made up for the discomfort.</p><p>The small time hops of a few hours or more were relatively safe, with test subjects returning to the present with nothing more than digestive discomfort and a sinus headache. However as the department attempted more audacious leaps of time, it became more dangerous. The first attempt to travel back one month resulted in a splinch where one half of the volunteer travelled to the past, and one half remained in the present. This immediately reduced the number of additional volunteers interested in trialing the device to zero. So instead of people, future experiments to test the device involved attempting to send back a variety of objects that didn’t appear to mind if they inexplicably lost half of themselves along the way. </p><p>No one outside the department should have had any idea about the device. </p><p>No one <i>should</i> have.</p><p>But they did. </p><p>The Eight had managed to pay off a former Unspeakable. A wizard who’d left the Ministry after a reasonably distinguished career but then, due to a large number of bad habits, had ended up in a dire financial position. He sold the knowledge he’d obtained from the Time room to the The Eight. They’d used this knowledge to build a device and fill it with Time Sand they’d purchased from another disgruntled source. They had the designs they required to replicate the device, and they’d bought enough Sand to travel back thirty years. And at this point was where Hermione’s team had discovered exactly why The Eight wanted to go back so far.</p><p>It had generally been believed that time was immutable, as Hermione had experienced during her use of a Time Turner at Hogwarts, when she and Harry had rescued Sirius and Buckbeak. But research undertaken in the Time Room at the Department of Mysteries had altered this thinking. Time was certainly not altogether mutable, however you could only change <i>some</i> things, but not others. It was figuring out <i>what</i> could be changed that was the real kicker.</p><p>The Eight had also happened upon the immutable yet mutable theory. It could have been a leak from the Ministry, or just good deductive reasoning. Either way, The Eight had brought in an Arithmantic expert to run formulas against numerous scenarios. Most of these scenario calculations had been picked up by various eavesdropping spells cast by Hermione’s commanding officer Eurydice and her team in the locations frequented by the group’s members. Hermione and her colleagues had been assigned to a roster system of monitoring the conversations, to make sure they caught critical information.</p><p>Firstly, The Eight had ruled out attempting to go back and kill Harry Potter. Once Harry was born it seemed that time had decided he would live. </p><p>Secondly, The Eight ruled out killing his parents before Lily was pregnant. The prophecy was immutable, and if Harry was never born, another child simply filled his place. Neville Longbottom appeared to feature strongly in the calculations and even Ron Weasley at one point. That child, whoever they were, ended up being likely to duel and kill Voldemort.</p><p>The next in line of hypothetical scenarios was killing Dumbledore before Harry attended school. This again was shown to be was largely pointless as Minerva or another Professor, often Filius, filled the place in the timeline. </p><p>To her indignant surprise there had been an idea floated to go back and kill one of the other members of the trio. Hilariously, Ron’s role as loyal sidekick and best friend turned out to be equally interchangeable as Harry himself, with a variety of students able to step into the role if Ron never made it onto the Hogwarts train to meet Harry. Hermione had felt a level of smugness about this until today, where the group had turned their focus on her. </p><p>Hermione, The Eight decided, had played a strong role in keeping Harry alive and on task. Without her presence in the trio, The Eight predicted Harry would fail to destroy the horcruxes and therefore the Dark Lord would not be truly killed. To her secret chagrin, as she was listening to the voice carefully explaining to the frustrated Death Eater wannabe, the calculations quickly identified she was also easily replaced. It was all a bit humbling to tell the truth.</p><p><i>Talk about blows to the ego</i>, Hermione sighed. </p><p>She popped the last piece of crispy bhaji into her mouth and turned her attention back to the voices. The irritated voice, which Hermione knew was actually one her targets, a wizard called Serge, began talking again to the second voice, the Arithmantic expert.</p><p><b>I’m beginning to think you’ve wasted a whole lot of our money,</b> Serge said. He definitely sounded more angry than irritated now.</p><p><big><tt>Actually</tt>, </big>countered the expert smoothly, <big><tt>you’re about to tell me I was worth every Knut. </tt></big></p><p>There was a brief moment of silence, which Hermione’s mind filled with an image of a sullen Serge, arms crossed, starting daggers at the expert. She shifted uncomfortably as the chair was really hurting her back. She couldn’t even cast a Cushioning Charm as it may effect the Eavesdropping Spell. She settled for a slight back arch and a neck roll.</p><p><b>Go on then,</b> a petulant Serge demanded.</p><p><big><tt>If you remove one person before the death of the Potters, this timeline is disrupted irrefutably, </tt> </big>explained the expert. <big><tt>See here, in all the scenarios I’ve calculated, the events are quite different.</tt></big></p><p><b>I don’t really understand</b>....Serge’s voice became indistinct and Hermione strained to hear the voices.</p><p>Hermione paled when she listened to the calm voice carefully explaining to Serge the benefits of killing Severus Snape. </p><p>The expert explained the most likely outcome of this choice. In all of the scenarios where Snape was eradicated the Order was decimated early, with Remus Lupin being the first causality, and Mad-Eye and Molly Weasley falling soon after. Bellatrix killed Dumbledore at the Astronomy Tower and was given the position of Headmaster of Hogwarts. Hogwarts became a recruiting group for Death Eaters, thus swelling their ranks.</p><p>The rest of the Order were lost when they attempted to move Harry on his seventeenth birthday. Without the polyjuice idea that Snape planted on Mundungus Fletcher, the group was easy pickings. Harry only survived due to a secret portkey made by Hermione (or whomever was filling the “brainy sidekick” position in that particular timeline). </p><p>Ron (or Ron-lite aka Dean or Sean or even Draco in one very strange series of calculations) still left Harry and Hermione while on the run but unlike in the current timeline he never returned, and, unable to destroy the locket, depression and anxiety hampered Hermione (or “The interchangeable Smart One of the Trio”) and Harry’s ability to locate the other horcruxes. </p><p>Harry still felled Voldemort during the final battle but not without devastating loss on ‘the side of light’ and only Voldemort’s body was destroyed. Bellatrix, alive as Molly was no longer around to best her in a duel, was perfectly placed to move towards another resurrection of her beloved master.</p><p>Hermione rubbed her eyes after a very pleased sounding Serge and a much relieved expert finished their conversation and parted ways. </p><p>“Alright, checking in girl,” said Sera as she entered the room with a mind boggling large coffee. </p><p>Hermione blinked in surprise. Her shift was already over. There was a lot to update her superiors on.  </p><p>“Sera, we need to brief in with Eurydice. The Eight have picked their target,” Hermione said, gathering up the parchment with the transcripts. </p><p>She put the dictoquill to sleep. She didn’t really like using it, but there was no other option. </p><p>When Hermione was initially rostered on interception duties she excitedly brought in her laptop. But the bloody Time Room was a pain in the arse, and she’d watched in horror as during her first shift her beautiful Lenovo laptop transformed, with an apologetic <i>pop</i>, into a card reader. She’d sighed. It was the last Muggle electronic item she’d taken into the Department. </p><p>“Was it Sirius? I have him in the pool,” Sera asked excitedly.</p><p>“No,” said Hermione, who’d drawn in the office sweep, of all the shitty luck, Mundungus Fletcher.</p><p>“Please tell me it isn’t Nymphadora,” Sera complained, “Declan will be <i>insufferable.”</i></p><p>“Nope,” said Hermione, “it’s Severus Snape,”</p><p>“Huh,” said Sera thoughtfully. “It actually makes a lot of sense. Okay, let’s go brief up. Eurydice will probably want to go to resolution on them now. No more boring sitting here monitoring conversations!”</p><p>“I doubt it,” said Hermione. “We still don’t know <i>when</i> they want to do it.”</p><p>“Oh bugger,” said a crestfallen Sera. “Oh,” she brightened suddenly seeing the grease spotted bag on the table, “got any bhajis left?”</p>
