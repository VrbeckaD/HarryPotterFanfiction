          <div class="userstuff"><p>Al finds a friend in Scorpius  because none of the other first years want to go near him and Scorpius finds a friend in Al because, well, the other boy decided. Making friends does not come naturally to Scorpius as he had grown up so isolated. His mother and father had not wanted him to socialise with the children of anyone connected with the wrong side of the war but did not really know anyone else for him to get to know.  Life had been happy but lonely.</p><p>Al's family don't ignore him or anything and for all James had teased him he punches two kids in the face for saying anything about his sorting in the first week alone.  The Weasleys take it upon themselves to include Scorpius into their gang and by the time the Christmas holidays roll around he too feels like he has a gaggle of cousins at Hogwarts. It gives him confidence. When his grandfather scolds him over the holidays for hanging around scum Scorpius defiantly insists it is better than murdering fools who torture innocent people. His mother quickly hides her face in her napkin and his father had flushed cheeks as he tells his father to back off.</p><p>Albus makes him feel like he is more than just 'that Malfoy kid'. He makes him feel like he would do anything to protect their friendship, anything to protect Al, and while that is sort of terrifying being eleven and all it is comforting too.</p></div>
