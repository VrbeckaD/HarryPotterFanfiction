    <p>Albus Dumbledore apparated to Godric's Hollow on that dreadful night when James and Lily Potter were killed. He swiftly grabbed Elisabeth Potter and took her to a place he knew nobody would find her, America. He left her with Kingsley's cousin, Nicholas Fury to look after and perhaps to train. He left after telling him to bring her back to England before her thirteenth birthday. Little did the Director know, he would soon become attached to the little trouble maker.</p>
