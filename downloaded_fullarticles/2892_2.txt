    <p>Harry hated having to be human. It was so bothersome, being unable to communicate with a twitch of a tail or ear, not being able to smell the emotions or intentions of another. He could never understand his uncle or aunt and especially not his cousin, they were much to loud and mean and violent for him. He never knew why he would get in trouble or what his uncle meant when he said one thing but meant another, it was just too complicated. When he discovered he could change his shape, everything was so much better.<br/>
When he was hurt and beaten, or running from his cousin, all he had to do was shift without being seen and run into the bushes and he was safe. He didn't have to go back until his aunt screamed for him to make dinner. That's why he ran away, shifting down to a smaller, but far faster form to sneak under his uncles fence and through trees and over dog houses and through bushes and really, the world was so much more fun when you were not weighed down by the human form. His ears twitched with every sound, his whiskers flicked every so often and he watched the creatures around him watch him, feeling how off he was even in this form.<br/>
He eventually found an abandoned space, crumbled and derelict, but livable and private. He went back to his human form, vaguely annoyed at the lack of warm clothes in the cold space. He decided to change back, knowing at least his fur should keep him warm, and resolving that after he marked the area as his, he would sneak down to a nearby shop to get some clothes.<br/>
But for now, he gently cleared some brick dust from a patch of sunlight, and took a nap.</p><p> </p><p>Harry's existence was a good one, he would say. He spent most of his day lounging in his nest or chasing down the fat little birds that made their homes in the bushes, and in the evening, he would put on his human clothes, walk on his human legs down to the shops (a place called dorking he thinks?), sweep storefronts for pocket change or swipe old mens wallets while they stumbled through streets. Really, he was perfectly content.<br/>
Until one day, he woke up in his nest to see a large owl, staring down at him on top of a crumbled wall of his nest. He slowly turned back into a human, not wanting to give the beast any opportunity to snatch him up, as he had seen owls do to other cats and birds and mice in the forest. He stepped towards it, cautiously, noting it didn't seem to startle and it had an old looking letter tied to its leg. He slowly untied the letter, watching the birds beak just in case. As soon as the letter was free, he rushed to the other side of the nest, putting a safe distance between the owl and him. He opened the thick letter and began to read.</p><p>Mr. H. Potter,<br/>

Lucinda Thomsonicle-Pocus<br/>
Chief Attendant of Witchcraft Provisions</p><p>Harry was, before anything else, confused. Really, he didn't doubt magic was real, he turned into an animal for fucks sake, but why would a school want him? He was just a child.<br/>
He decided to scoop some dirt up in his hands and shmear it on the page in the vague shape of a question mark before closing it back up the best he could and tying it back to the owls leg. He expected the owl to leave immediately, to leave him be to think of what has happened, but it stayed, staring at him. He frowned, trying to shoo the beast away, but it stayed still, only letting out an annoyed chirp.<br/>
He thought for just a moment, and moved back to another corner of the nest. He kneeled in the dirt and dug up a few chunks of meat he had buried the other day, wiping some of the dirt away. He held his hand out to the beast, hoping it would take the food.<br/>
The owl looked at him for a moment, before sweeping open its wings and swiping the meat from his hand before he could duck. With the food in its beak, it flew away, leaving harry to lay back down and sleep off his confusion.<br/>
Waking up sometime later, he shivered, cursing himself for falling asleep in his human form. Checking around his nest, if it weren't for the missing meat in his stores, Harry would have thought the whole occurrence was just a dream. He frowned, unwilling to deal with the issue (really, how was he supposed to live an idyllic life with all of these issues). getting up to his feet, he slipped on the sweatpants and shirt he kept tied to the branches that shaded his nest and decided a walk to town would do him good. </p><p> </p><p>His favorite thing about going to town was the food. While shifted, he only really ate meat, enough of anything else and he'd get sick, but one of the few perks of being human was he could taste the cream and sugar in pastries and the spice of peppers and the sour and sweet and bitterness of the fruit he would barely be able to taste before.<br/>
His favorite shop though, besides the sweets shop with the nice mousy lady, was a small odds and ends place filled with cheap clothes and shiny things he could keep around his nest to play with. The pretty silver bells attracted birds and used clothes were much softer than the nasty new ones. A good chunk of the coins he earned ended up there.<br/>
His belly full of cupcakes and apples, he walked through the aisles in the odds and ends store, the shop owner paying him no mind despite his age. He slunk through the clothes, running his hands along the different patterns and texture pleasingly. He found a particular sweater that he was tempted to get, just to sleep on it.  He grabbed it off the rack and slung it over his small shoulder, continuing his round through the shop.<br/>
While on his way back to the knick knack area, he heard the bell ring. This shop wasn't exactly unpopular, but he still looked out to the front of the shop from behind rows of denim, spotting 2 people he’d never seen before. A sour looking man with dark hair and black fancy clothes and a green eyed older woman in a long green dress with a serious look on her face. He frowned, twitching his nose, as the dark man’s eyes caught his. While he wasn't nearly as sensitive as he was while shifted, he could feel these two were different then the rest of town.<br/>
Feeling the sudden shift in the air, he slunk into the back of the shop, placing the soft sweater into his mouth before shifting and running out the back door. </p><p>He was just outside of town when he wind came up from behind him, bringing with it two unfamiliar scents. He turned back to see a green eyed tabby following him along with the most massive cat he’d ever scene, looking like a wild animal. He stiffened and picked up his pace, running. The tabby and the large cat ran after him, both older and faster, but Harry had been in these woods far longer. He scampered through the trees, going under roots and through complicated paths, figuring they would follow his scent instead of thinking of the terrain logically. The sweater clasped tight in his mouth, he refused to look back, running as fast as his small body could take him.<br/>
Smelling his nest nearby, he turned back and saw the tabby and the big cat were nowhere in sight. He<br/>
skid quickly into his nest, tossing his new sweater to the side and hopping on top of the crumbled brick wall, watching the area around his nest from his high point. It wasn't long until he saw and smelled the strange cats coming up to his nest.<br/>
Upset, but knowing he had no chance fighting them, he yowled, trying to scare them from his nest while he had the high ground but neither moved. He tried again, but they only came closer. Finally, he lept to the ground, shifting back to his human form and stood over the strange cats, roaring in their faces as a last ditch effort to get them away. To his shock and fear, they shifted as well.<br/>
In front of him, in his own nest, were the two strange people from before, staring down at him sternly. The man loomed over him, greasy hair sticking to the edges of his face, sneering down at him.<br/>
“Mr. Potter, would you like to explain what business you have living in the middle of the woods, as a cat?”</p>
