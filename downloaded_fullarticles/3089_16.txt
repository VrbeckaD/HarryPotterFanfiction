          <div class="userstuff"><p>Despite what everyone thought, Cedric was not perfect. It was flattering in some ways, for everyone to hold him in such a high regard. Unfortunately, that meant his blunders stuck out even more.</p><p> </p><p>Cedric tried not to think much about his ”<em>lack of romanticism”</em> as Cho likes to say. It was never really a problem when he was younger. He was adorably awkward, polite, and fast. What more did you need? As he grew older though, Cedric began to realize that people expected for him to grow out of his <em>”anti-social nerd” </em>stage. </p><p> </p><p>No matter how hard Cedric practiced though, he still couldn’t stop his fumbling words or uncontrollable pitch. Perhaps romance simply wasn’t for him. And Cedric was okay with that.</p><p> </p><p>At least until he met Harry Potter. Cedric couldn’t even begin to describe everything that boy put him through. Every time Cedric finds himself looking at Harry, it vaguely reminds him of going out on the Quidditch field for the first time. The adrenaline pumping through his chest, so fiercely that he feels his temples throb in an unsettling way. The churning of his stomach is unbearable to the point where he thinks that throwing up and calling sick would be better than getting on his broom. Then one thing leads to another and he’s in the air. He’s flying so fast, so high that Cedric doesn’t even care about the motion sickness or the fact that he has a terrible handle of the broom. He just feel so <em>alive</em>.</p><p> </p><p>However, whenever Cedric goes to open his mouth everything feels dry. Suddenly Cedric can count the 15 different pairs of eyes watching him. He can see everyone slightly lean on as if expecting Cedric to break out into song at any minute. All the whispers coming from behind his back are increased by thirty. Before Cedric could stop himself, he’s already reverted back to his shy, bumbling words.</p><p> </p><p>It’s tragic, it truly is. But Cedric still has hope that one day he can look Potter in his memorizing emerald eyes and whisk him away with a poem of his hands in that messy black hair. Cedric still has hope that one day he’ll be able to hold Potter in his arms and count the freckles tracing his dark arms. Cedric hopes that one day, he won’t be as hopeless as Cho said he was.</p></div>
