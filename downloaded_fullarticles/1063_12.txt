<p><em>‘Ah, I remember this place. It brings back memories~~.’ </em>Harry Potter signs.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Last thing he remembered is finally saying goodbye to his family. For what it worth, dying of old age is quite the accomplishment for Harry. He was sure he was going to kick the bucket by being killed or some freak accidents like eaten by a basilisk.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Even though he assumed he would return here in the end, woke up lying butt naked on his back in this bleach white King Cross station was not what he has in mind.</p>
<p> </p>

</p>

<p>Life after Riddle final fall was full of trails and adjustments. For Harry and friends, especially for the wizard communities, Britain took the most damage in the war. A line of command needed to be established to direct the people. There were lots to do: cleaning up the after, taking care of the injuries and death, fixing the ministry and a million more things. Muggleborns, half-bloods, pure bloods, creatures, etc. all came together to help.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When the ministry members tried to regain their power and positions from before, their plan was brutally destroyed by one Hermione Granger. She basically stormed in, stamped on those incompetent, good for nothing *beep* and took control of the entire ministry. She was at her last straw. She had just survived being hunted, participate the most terrible magical war ever, saw her best friend being the biggest idiot martyr in the whole FUCKING UNIVERSE!!!! She was not letting these fools ruined all of their effort!!!!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And thus, marked the beginning of the Granger takeover, with an iron will and iron fist.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Well, it not like anyone else could do better. Beside, Hermione had came a long way since the bossy, know it all, rule loving, adult-always-right, annoying (she truly was, but Harry wasn’t stupid to say it out loud, thank you very much) first year at Hogwarts. Being Harry friends has helped her grown up, become wiser and the war had hardened her, more aware, wary, calculated toward most things.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She later on married Ron Weasley, when he actually built up the gut to ask her that is. They then have a family together. The Granger reign didn’t end at her retirement but continue with her apprentices, who she trained personal to take over each other, herself look after them as an adviser or a member of the counselors.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Not surprisingly, everyone approved of her. the Hogwarts students and DA give her their full support and enforce it as they join the system <em>(it was very awe inspiring and frightening, to be honest. Especially the Hufflepuff, they were right to warn about the silent ones.)</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>As for Harry well, adjustment was the hardest for him. From being abuse from his family, to child solider in training then actual child solider, to being nationally hunted, to walking to his own death then return to the living… well you can imagine how to adjust to that now everything is over (thank for nothing Dumbledore!!! You bastard planned for this didn’t you!!! Harry still hadn’t decided if the part he came back was in the plan or not?)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He tried to moved on. Married Ginny Weasley as people expect of him, became head auror, whipped his department up to shape and to his standard, had children, three in total, 2 boys and 1 girls, <em><u>as he was expected</u></em>. He wasn’t happy. He wasn’t sure if he know how to be so with everything has happened to him. Ginny wasn’t happy as well. She wanted to experience life more not stuck in the house with duties of being Lady Potter or Harry’s wife</p>
<p> </p>
<p>One day, Harry and Ginny sat down and talk. They both decided to dissolve their married but still friends and shared custody of the children. A few year later, Teddy Lupin, Harry’s Godson join the family after his grandmother can not take him anymore due to her falling health.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ginny, well, she had done a lot since then. Last he check she was playing quidditch professional, with a new boyfriend.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry followed Ginny examples. He quit his job, make sure to place someone actual competent in his position or Minister Granger will come to him for blood. He tried things, took on hobbies. Wood crafting, surfing, cooking (now for pleasure, with no Dursleys around he found it quite enjoyable), magic research, potion (same with cooking, with teachers not purposely sabotaged him), ritual magic, creatures, etc. he wanted to try everything now that he had the opportunity to do so. It revived his thirst for explore and adventure. And with the Potter and Black fortune, it not like Harry can not afford it. He made sure to invest and other projects to bring back money of course, money or in wizard case gold does not grow on tree (or do they? Hm…).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He did have a few relationships, here and there. None really last though. But everybody involved part on good term, some he still kept in contacted and considered friends.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Then Harry came across Damian, an Italian pâtissier, when he visited Blaise Zabini. The Slytherin had become a surprising good friend to the wandering Gryffindor. Damian own a café shop in the Italian magical center. It only took him six months to ask him out, three years flirting, begging, and courting for Damian to say yes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Of course, this didn’t mean he abandon his duty as a Lord while having fun. He had to, if not the Granger wrath shall be upon him, cue shudder. One time! One time, he missed a meeting, The Meeting in fact, Hermione had blasted down his door drag him out of beg (he may drink a little too much the night before) and into the meeting room, still in his pajama.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There are undoubtedly bums on the roads, some not worth mentioning, some alright still manageable, other WTF-Harry-your-luck-is-acting-up-again!!!!!. But he is proud to say he is content, truly content with his live.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On his bed, at the age of 280, recorded as one of the oldest wizards have ever lived and the last of his generation. Luckily, not the oldest. Knowing his luck, he could have been an immortal. Phew, one massive bullet dodged. (he regretted saying that, he jinxed himself. Dammit!!)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But then, surrounding by his family and friends he felt truly truly from the very depth of his heart, happy joy. Everyone has tears in their eyes, some already crying, the children bailing their out. They smile and wish him luck on his next great adventure.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And so Harry Potter, BWL, conqueror, Dark Lords vanquisher, etc. (insert wizards ridiculous naming here, that is something Harry won’t missed Ha!) finally rest his wary soul surrounded by love ones and feeling blessed.</p>
