          <div class="userstuff"><p>Our story starts in The Order of The Phoenix's headquarters, head of The Advance Guard Emmeline Vance is talking to her best recruit Fabian Prewett.</p><p>Fabian smirked. "Why all this secrecy, Em? We're both adults, we can discuss things in a serious way."</p><p>Emmeline said, "I know that you, no; that we both want to have a more personal relationship with each other. But we can't."</p><p>Fabian rolled his eyes and sighed. "Let me guess, it's against the rules for the leader to date a lowly recruit?"</p><p>Emmeline muttered, "Well, yes; but you're not lowly, Fab. You're my best recruit by a mile, we just can't break The Order's rules."</p><p>Fabian frowned. "Live a little, stop being the strict one." He smiled. "Be more like me."</p><p>Emmeline laughed. "What, more rebellious? You're hardly rebellious."</p><p>Fabian grinned. "See? That laughter that I barely hear is better than your shouting, Em. Are you saying that you wouldn't break the rules for moi?"</p><p>Emmeline whispered, "Who says that we'll be breaking them? The rules state clearly that a member cannot be in a public, romantic relationship with someone of a lower status than them. We don't have to go public, we can keep this between us until you get promoted or I get demoted."</p><p>Fabian replied, "They'll never demote you and I'm perfectly fine with a secret relationship. It's more fun than a public one."</p></div>
