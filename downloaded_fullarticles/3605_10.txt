<p>Changing Targets</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Slowly, the world came into focus. Warm, safe, Draco’s arms around him, Harry couldn’t think to save his life. Breathing Draco in, he let his mind drift. </p>
<p>“Welcome back.”</p>
<p>Sighing, Harry nuzzled Draco’s neck. “Did I go somewhere?”</p>
<p>Draco laughed. “Yes. I think I made you lose consciousness there for a bit. Me and my magical arse.” </p>
<p>Grinning, Harry kissed Draco’s neck. “I can’t argue with that.” </p>
<p>“No? Damn.” Shifting, Draco threw a leg over Harry’s hips. </p>
<p>“You <i>wanted</i> me to argue?”</p>
<p>“Not really.” Draco hummed. “I just like keeping things…spicy.” </p>
<p>Harry snorted. Understanding Draco was a moving target. </p>
<p>~</p>
<p>They dosed, occasionally waking up to kiss and cuddle, and when the sun rose, Harry was feeling rested. </p>
<p>“One more day,” said Draco. </p>
<p>“Until we return to the Ministry? Yes, I was just thinking that, too.” Yawning, Harry sat up. “It’s going to be a tough to go back to working all day long, to having to meet targets and write reports.” </p>
<p>Rolling onto his back, Draco smirked up at him. “Then maybe we shouldn’t do it. Maybe we should refuse to go back.” </p>
<p>“And do what?” asked Harry. </p>
<p>Folding his arms behind his head, Draco hummed. “Anything we want.” </p>
