    <p>“Harry, I’m detective Schultz. Do you know why you’re here today, son?” The detective gestured towards the unkempt boy, dressed in a loose blue shirt adorning several holes and baggy jeans, his shaggy hair covering his forehead. The boy looked as if he hadn’t bathed in at least a week and the odor all but confirmed it. “Do you have any idea why I brought you in today,” the detective asked again.</p><p>Harry slouched in his chair across from his interrogator, his arms folded at his chest. He stared blankly towards the middle of the table between them. “Is that you’re question? Are you asking if I know why I’m here?”</p><p>“Yes, Harry I’m curious if you know why you’re sitting in this room, talking with me.” The detective lifted a cup of coffee to his mouth and sipped, then sat it back down and gestured towards a second cup that he slid in front of the boy. Harry continued to stare blankly and the detective concluded the boy would not talk. “Harry, do you remember the night of the fifth? What you were doing?”</p><p>Harry grabbed the coffee that was offered to him, but instead of drinking from it, he pushed it back towards the detective. “I never cared much for liquid.” He leaned back, folding his arms at his chest once again. “I like…...” He gazed deeply into the detective’s eyes. “I don’t remember the fifth. That was nine nights ago. I’ve done a lot since then.”</p><p>“Have you? What do kids your age do around here?”</p><p>Harry shrugged, “I don’t do what kids around here do and you know that.” The boy closed his eyes, tilting his head back.</p><p>“I guess you’re right. What does Dudley like to do?”</p><p>The boy scratched at the dried blood under his chin. “Dudley,” he said, submissively.</p><p>“That’s right. Your cousin, Dudley Dursley. Where is he?” The detective leaned forward, resting his weight on the table, his elbows pointed outward. Across from him, Harry seemed lost in a daydream as seconds passed by, and with every one of those seconds, the tick of the clock kept them rooted in this otherwise silent room, pausing the world around them.</p><p> “Do you know where Dudley is, Harry?”</p><p>Harry, now looking towards the fluorescent light above, took a deep sigh. “Dudley’s disappeared, Jim.”</p><p>The detective looked bothered by the boy’s assertion, leaning back in his chair as it squeaked loudly, breaking the tedium of the clock ticks for only a moment. “Why did you call me Jim,” he asked, bluntly.</p><p>“Why does anyone call anyone anything? It’s your name, is it not?”</p><p>“You may call me detective Schultz, Mr. Schultz, or simply James. Do not call me Jim.” James pondered for a moment, gazing into Harry’s inattentive green eyes. “How did you even know my name was James?”</p><p>The boy continued to stare above, as if looking past the light in the center of the ceiling and into some dark void beyond. There were several moths in the casing surrounding the bulbs, having died while trapped inside. </p><p>“What is life, Jim?”</p><p>James was confused at the question. “Excuse me?”</p><p>“I asked a question, Jim. What is life? What is it to you?”</p><p>Baffled, James answered the question as best he could, “Well, to me, it was my family. My wife and children.”</p><p>“Yes, a nice house, an expensive car, a swimming pool, food in the fridge, heat in the winter. A good job, one that provides for that family you have. </p><p>Watching the games on Sunday?”</p><p>“Where’s the point in this?”</p><p>“The point is that there are two types of people in the world, Jim. The ones that see a certain reality in which trivialities and luxuries are of any worth, and the ones too smart for their own good. The ones that know we’re all clinging to something that might kill us.” Harry continued staring towards the fluorescent light and lifeless moths.</p><p>James looked up towards the light, noticing the flickering nuisance it was, and then back towards the boy.</p><p>“Son, I am trying my hardest to stay calm with you. I’ll forget that you suggested my wife and children were trivial things, but you had better stop calling me Jim. The only people who called me Jim were my mother and-”</p><p>“Your wife. Yes, Jim.”</p><p>James, his face red with anger, slammed his hand down upon the table as the boy let out a subtle grin. The detective breathed in and out a couple of times and apologized to the boy for his outburst. “…But, look, Harry. I don’t find it amusing or impressive that you’ve managed to hack into my home security system.”</p><p>The boy laughed, “You have no idea what i’m cable of. I would not waste time spying on you.”</p><p>“Okay,” the detective shrugged, “You got me. Let’s push all this to the side, son. You said your cousin Dudley-”</p><p>“He was not my cousin.”</p><p>James smiled, poking his finger in the boy’s direction. “Funny. You spoke of him in the past tense.”</p><p>Harry, amused, had smiled back, eliciting whatever remained of the youth left inside him. “He’s not here, is he?”</p><p>The detective wore his smile as long as he could, then sighed.”Where the hell is he Harry?”</p><p>The boy looked back up at the light. He seemed to be in his own world, toying with the detective, wasting his time. “You seem stressed. Why don’t you have a cigarette?”</p><p>James scoffed at the boy. “I don’t smoke, but thank you. Explain, in detail, what you were doing on the night of the fifth, Harry.”</p><p>“I’ll tell you everything, Jim. It won’t help you, but if you insist to know the things i know. Things will never be the same for you”</p><p>“Please.”</p><p>“I was down at the playground, when Dudley turned up with some hipster wannabe friends.”</p><p>“Sure. Continue.”</p><p>“He mentioned a names i hold dear to me. They were calling me freak and something snapped behind them ”</p><p>“You mean across from the park?”</p><p>“What do you think?”</p><p>Harry was finally talking and the detective expressed relief, it was silent for a moment. Something snapped, making his ears ring. it came from within the wall behind him.</p><p>“Did you hear that”  James pondered for a moment, gazing into the boys green eyes. They were suddenly bored into his own. Making him feel uneasy.</p>
