    <p>Nana sat in the nursery, Tsuna asleep in his tiny bed, and her cell phone in hand. Her eyes were sore, her nose stuffy, and her cheeks were a bit sticky. She forced a laugh, wiping at her cheeks with her sleeve.</p><p> </p><p>“Mama’s gonna call your Papa again, Tsu-kun,” Nana said. “Just one more time. Mama knows he’ll answer this time because he loves us,”</p><p> </p><p>She typed in his contact name, clicked Call, and listened to it ring.</p><p> </p><p>And ring.</p><p> </p><p>Ring. Ring. Beep.</p><p> </p><p>She grinned, her face lighting up as she waited.</p><p> </p><p>“The number you are trying to reach is currently unavailable, please try again later,”</p><p> </p><p>The phone fell into her lap. Tears falling down her cheeks again as she forced herself to laugh instead of cry.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s alright Tsu-kun,” Nana said. “Papa’s just busy. He’s a very busy man you know. Very important,”</p><p> </p><p>The two-year-old slept on, blissfully unaware of his mother’s slowly breaking heart.</p><p> </p><p>Nana woke up to Tsuna trying to fit his tiny blanket over her.</p><p> </p><p>“Mama, shh,” Tsuna said, pulling the blanket over her shoulders. “Sleepytime, shhh,”</p><p> </p><p>“Shhh,” Nana agreed with a nod. She grabbed Tsuna around his waist and rolled over, cuddling him against her chest and pillowing her arm under his head.</p><p> </p><p>“Mama!” Tsuna squealed. “Bad, blanket gone. Mama cold,”</p><p> </p><p>Nana giggled into his fluffy brown hair. The two-year-old huffing and shaking his head at her.</p><p> </p><p>“Mama loves you Tsu-kun,” Nana said.</p><p> </p><p>“Tsu-kun loves Mama!”</p><p> </p><p>“Papa loves Tsu-kun too,”</p><p> </p><p>“Papa?” Tsuna asked. “Who Papa?”</p><p> </p><p>Nana got Tsuna bathed and into clean clothes before taking him downstairs for breakfast.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re almost three years old Tsu-kun,” Nana said as she cleaned the shredded fish from the floor. “No more throwing your food,”</p><p> </p><p>“Mama no fun,” Tsuna huffed. “Tsu-kun wanna play,”</p><p> </p><p>Nana threw the floor fish into the trash. Turning around she saw Tsuna run up the stairs. There was a slip. A tumble. A crash.</p><p> </p><p>“MAMA!”</p><p> </p><p>Nana ran out of the kitchen.</p><p> </p><p>“Tsu-kun!” Nana gathered the screaming toddler into her arms and walked quickly up the stairs. “It’s okay, it’s okay,” Nana said as she grabbed the first aid kit from the hall closet.</p><p> </p><p>She brought Tsuna into her room, turning on the light and searching Tsuna’s head for a bump.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s okay Tsu-kun,” Nana said. “Where’s it hurt?” What if he had a concussion? What if he took a nap and...and never woke up.</p><p> </p><p>“My butt hurts Mama,” Tsuna said.</p><p> </p><p>Nana froze. Lowering her hands from Tsuna’s hair with a relieved laugh.</p><p> </p><p>“Mama’s got an ice pack in the fridge,” Nana said. “Let’s go get it,”</p><p> </p><p>She followed Tsuna as he went slowly down the stairs. She put the first aid kit back in the hall closet. Resting her head against the door she laughed again. She pulled out her cell phone and dialed her husband’s number.</p><p> </p><p>Ring.</p><p> </p><p>Ring.</p><p> </p><p>Ring. Ring. Beep.</p><p> </p><p>“Hunny, you wouldn’t guess what happened just now-”</p><p> </p><p>“The number you are trying to reach is currently unavailable, please try again later,”</p><p> </p><p>Nana sighed. Slipping her phone back into her pocket, she headed downstairs.</p><p>Tsuna sat on the couch with a movie in his lap when Nana entered the living room.</p><p> </p><p>“Supers! Supers!” Tsuna chanted. “Please Mama?”</p><p> </p><p>Nana smiled, grabbing the superhero movie from his tiny hand.</p><p> </p><p>“Of course Tsu-kun!” Nana said as she put the movie in the DVD player.</p><p> </p><p>She sat down on the couch, Tsuna cuddled up at her side as the movie played.</p><p> </p><p>She took a photo of Tsuna, fast asleep and holding onto her skirt. She sent it to her husband with a smile.</p><p> </p><p>‘Message not sent’</p><p> </p><p>Nana frowned and sent it again.</p><p> </p><p>‘Messgae not sent’</p><p> </p><p>She tapped the Call icon.</p><p> </p><p>Ring.</p><p> </p><p>Ring.</p><p> </p><p>Ring. Ring. Beep.</p><p> </p><p>“Hunny, somethings wrong with-”</p><p> </p><p>“The number you are trying to reach is currently unavailable, please try again later,”</p><p> </p><p>“My phone,” Nana sighed.</p><p> </p><p>She put her phone into her pocket. She picked Tsuna up and carried him up the stairs. She tucked him into bed with a sigh.</p><p> </p><p>“Papa loves us Tsu-kun,” Nana said. “Papa loves us,”</p><p> </p><p>Ring.</p><p> </p><p>Ring.</p><p> </p><p>Ring. Ring. Beep. </p><p> </p><p>“The number you are trying to reach is currently unavailable, please try again later,”<br/>
