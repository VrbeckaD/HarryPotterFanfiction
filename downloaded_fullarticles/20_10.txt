    <p>It is a bright Sunday morning and Hermione Granger is doing her usual routine. Fix the bed, make breakfast, take a look at the resort, fix whatever broken tiles or ceilings, and then do it all over again. Only this time, she adds fix the reception area on her to-do list.</p><p> </p><p>She shakes her head as she remembers her daughter Kade Granger is getting married. It’s not that she doesn’t like it, no. After all, it is a mother’s desire to see her daughter walk down the aisle. It’s just that she –</p><p> </p><p>“Mother!”</p><p> </p><p>She looks up from her thinking and she realizes she should’ve been fixing a window but she was too deep into her thoughts. Shaking her head, she mutters a quick <em>Reparo</em> to mend the damage. She smiles and turns around and gives her daughter a smile as walks over to her.</p><p> </p><p>“Good morning, Kade. How are you?” she asks, kissing her daughter’s forehead.</p><p> </p><p>Kade hugged her before pulling away and giving her a big smile, “As happy and nervous as any bride-to-be is!”</p><p> </p><p> Hermione gives her daughter a tight smile, one that she thankfully doesn’t notice as she walks around the room, sitting on the bed.</p><p> </p><p>“Tessie and Natalie are arriving today,” Kade tells her, a smile on her face.</p><p> </p><p>She nods as she grabs a few pillows and blankets from the cabinet, “Okay then. I’ll prepare their room right now.”</p><p> </p><p>Kade jumps up and grabs a few of the same things before following her and telling her she’ll help him, too. Kade is her mother’s daughter. Brown curly hair, eyes dark as chestnuts, with the same grin on her face. Hermione prides on that. Kade is all her own. Her everything. She spent 20 years raising her and looking at Kade now, she is her pride and joy.</p><p> </p><p>“Are Aunt Daphne and Katie coming too?” Kade asks as they approach one of the spare rooms.</p><p> </p><p>Hermione smiles as she is reminded of her two closest friends. Daphne Greengrass and Katie Bell. They didn’t become close friends during Hogwarts, no. They actually got acquainted 3 years after the war, meeting Daphne and Katie, the two best friends who somehow found comfort in each other after the war. Imagine the surprise on their faces when the resort they were staying in belonged to Hermione Granger.</p><p> </p><p>They weren’t the sense of familiarity Hermione missed back in London, but it still gave her a sense of knowing. Daphne and Katie stayed for a month with her, and it was easy to trust the two girls. She didn’t say why she was here, or how she was here. They never pestered it. And more than enough, they are both loyal to her as they never told anyone where she was.</p><p> </p><p>“They are. I know you’ve missed them,” Hermione teases her.</p><p>Kade nods as she fixes the bed for her best friends, “The last I saw them was what? Last year's summer?”</p><p> </p><p>Hermione smiles at that. Every summer, Daphne and Katie make it their joy to visit both of them here. It was also their third summer together when Hermione asked both Daphne and Katie to be Kade’s godmother (seeing as there’s no godfather spot).</p><p> </p><p>“I think you only want to see them seeing as they’re both your godmother, and they always bring you gifts every year,” Hermione says jokingly, sitting beside Kade and patting her head.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, well. Don’t tell them,” Kade giggles.</p><p> </p><p>Hermione just rolls her eyes and gets up, making Kade stand as well.</p><p> </p><p>“Where’s Tyler?” she asks her, holding Kade by the shoulders.</p><p> </p><p>Kade blushes at the mention of her fiance and Hermione softens at how in love her daughter is.</p><p> </p><p>“He’s in the storage room, helping with the staff,” she says, leaning down on her mother’s chest.</p><p> </p><p>Hermione runs her hand through Kade’s hair and she wonders if this is what it feels like to run hands through her hair. All tangled and messy. She laughs. She pulls away and kisses Kade’s forehead before telling her to go and help Tyler before the poor boy feels hopeless.</p><p> </p><p>Kade laughs and kisses her cheeks before heading out.</p><p> </p><p>Now left all alone, Hermione sits on the bed of the guest room and closes her eyes, allowing herself to finally relax after days of preparing and days of stress. Her daughter is getting married tomorrow. And as much as Hermione is happy for her daughter, there is a tiny sense of fear. Fear of what happens after.</p><p> </p><p>But all she wanted was Kade happy. For the past 20 years that’s what her wishes were, still are. So she works up courage, just like the Gryffindor she is, and smiles and thinks everything will be well.</p>
