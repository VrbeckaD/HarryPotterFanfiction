    <p>Severin Snape was in line at the bookstore, waiting for her turn as the arrogant boy snapped and walked straight to the main cash register.</p><p>Some people began to grumble, but were soon silenced by shrieking and enthusiastic girls. The guy flashed a smile to them and walked over to the cash register.</p><p>Severin was stunned by his audacity and blatant disregard for the waiting people. She assumed he was some stupid superstar based on the girls' fangirling reaction from before, but that wasn't what allowed him to act like that. "Hey, boy!" She exclaimed irritably, "Wait for your turn like everyone else! We all don't have the whole day to spent here."</p><p>The male froze in his steps, before he turned around. His hazel eyes met with her black ones before his lips curled to an amused smile.</p><p>Severin did not care about the fuss the surrounding females created. She entered a stalemate with the young, about 17 years old, male. </p><p>Admittedly, he’s very handsome. The fact only convinced her that her speculation must have been at least half true. He must have been a superstar.</p><p>Severin quickly took over and pointed her finger toward the end of the line, "There." She said in frozen tone.</p><p>The guy seems unimpressed. He leaned nonchalantly on the counter and smiled the smile that undoubtedly served him extensively on stage.</p><p>Severin raised an eyebrow and did not lower her pointing hand.</p><p>"Now, I'm sure it's not such a deal." The young man dismissed lightly and winked at her, "I have really busy day."</p><p>"Like all of us. So please consider." Severin's voice was frozen and uncompromising.</p><p>“Aw, that’s very cruel of you.” He said, pronouncing the words in a playful manner. However, somewhere in his heart, he wondered if he lost his charm.</p><p>He turned to the girl behind him, who has been squealing, before asking, “Do you mind if I go first?”</p><p>Of course, the girl shook her head, her eyes as if hypnotized. James turned to Severin again, “See?” </p><p>Severin rolled her eyes, “Right. What do I expect from an idiot?” She palmed her forehead exasperatedly before sighing, “Then this little miss, please, take his place and go to the back to line up. Basic math. Really.”</p><p>The girl returned to her senses immediately. "Excuse me? Why should I do that?!" Straight protest.</p><p>Severin shrugged, "I don't understand either, but the one who chose to give up your turn for him is you."</p><p>"But... but ..." The girl opened her eyes, "It's Potter!" Shrieked, "James Potter!"</p><p>"For my part, he could be Prince Charles." Severin was unimpressed, "He still has to wait his turn."</p><p>Protests and gossip quickly spread among the girls present. Severin folded her hands and stubbornly stared at the celebrity beginning to look a little less comfortable, but far more curious.</p><p>“So, what’s the decision?” A tiny, winning smirk made its way to her lips. She tilted her head challengingly as her eyes bore into his.</p><p>James.. for a moment lost his soul there. He quickly came back though, a small blush making its way to his cheek.</p><p>His reaction was odd. Severin slightly furrowed her brows and looked at him questioningly, the smirk changing to a pursed lips.</p><p>He laughed it off before answering, “Yea, I’ll go to the back.”</p><p>Severin waited for him to do the thing. Potter went back, where she heard him talking to some girls.  There were lots of screams and Potter signed some pictures.</p><p>His arrogant yet pleasant voice carried to the end of the queue.</p><p>"Girls, will you let me go first?" Severin snorted compared to the innocent voice he made. But the fangirls seem to have fallen for the lie easily. "I have to finish really fast, I have new photos this afternoon. Next week it will be all newsletters." He promised. </p><p>Severin rolled her eyes as she glanced over her shoulder. Potter somehow found his way right behind her and there he stood.</p><p>He caught her eye, and winked flirtatiously. In response, Severin loked at him furiously.</p><p>“Sorry not sorry, but I won’t move.” She said through her gritted teeth. He merely smiled, “Trust me, that was not my intention.”</p><p>Looking at him distrustfully, she huffed before turning to the decreasing line in front of her. Just two more people, then it’ll be her turn.</p><p>James pursed his lips when he realized she’s ignoring him. “Severin Snape, was it?” He asked, despite knowing the answers.</p><p>She turned around in shock, “How did-“ He smirked, before pointing at the crowd of girls behind him, “Those sweet girls told me. You are quite famous, or is it infamous? it seems.”</p><p>Severin mocked. "What can you expect from such unwise people?"</p><p>Her reaction caused Potter's smile to widen, god knows why. Severin frowned for a moment, but simply shrugged. Fame seemed have come at the expense of precious brain cells.</p><p>Well, that wasn't her problem.</p><p>Severin returned to look ahead. Soon it was turn. She paid for her purchase and was hit by a direct move outside the store.</p><p>"Hey, wait, Snape!" The call was heard behind her.</p><p>She did not stop in her track, and even picked her pace slightly. Just a few steps away and she’ll be out.</p><p>But of course, a tug to her wrist stopped her. She muttered something under her breath before turning around and snapped, “What?”</p><p>“Uh, I thought you might want to get some coffee, my treat, you know, as a nice to meet you?” James released his hold on her wrist, which he noted is quite thin.</p><p>She cocked one of her eyebrows, “No thanks, Mr.I-have-a-photoshoot-this-afternoon.”</p><p>"Oh, right! Then come with me! Come on, you know you want it!" Exclaimed the young man excitedly.</p><p>"No, I'm not." </p><p>"Don't be stupid, of course you are! Everyone wants it." Severin was amazed at how confident he was and in the truth of his words.</p><p>"Uh wow, you have some sort of huge megalomania." Severin noted. "I'm not interested. Don't make me repeat myself again."</p><p>“Then as an I’m sorry? Take it as my apology for being an ass?” He tried again. “You know, I knew a close-by cafe that served really nice cups of coffee.”</p><p>The surroundings are starting to stare at them again, some even took out their phone to record the whole situation.</p><p>“You are...” A pause. “Fine!” She hissed. She basically stomped her foot as she went out, him following her before they come shoulder to shoulder.</p><p>She still kept her distance though. And as a presumably good liar, he was truthful when he said the cafe was close.</p><p>At the door the girl froze.</p><p>"Hey, darling, are you okay?" Potter asked behind her.</p><p>Severin slowly turned around.  "Potter." Started, "This cafe is the most expensive in town." She said slowly, pointing at the price tag, as if thinking he was too stupid to understand himself.</p><p>"Oh, don't worry about it." The guy lightly canceled, "I'll pay."</p><p>The girl's black eyes narrowed furiously and her nostrils flared. "What do you take me for? A charity destination?!" Hissed threateningly. She circled her heels and stormed away.</p><p>"No, wait a minute!" Exclaimed the young celebrity. He rushed to get her and grabbed her hand, "Listen-"</p><p>"No, listen to me, Potter." If stares could kill, Severin would certainly not feel sorry for him. "I don't need your kindness and goodness. Keep. Away. From. Me. Am I clear?"</p><p>James ran his fingers through his hair frustratedly before he said, “We’ll change the place, okay? I didn’t know that it was ‘that’ expensive.”</p><p>He was almost half pleading at this point, and yea, it worked as Severin’s expression softened. She sighed, “I’ll choose the place.”</p><p>It took them a five minutes walk before they arrived at another shop. It looked very normal, so normal that he would not have noticed it.</p><p>She eyed his flabbergasted face and snorted before taking a step in.</p><p>"Do you want to say something?" Severin asked defiantly as the boy opened his mouth. </p><p>He closed it and shook his head. "It's... okay, I guess." He shrugged in defeat, had not yet turned to one of the tables and held the chair for Severin. </p><p>The girl crossed her arms and raised her chin, before pulling another chair and sitting on it. Potter blinked for a moment, but flinched and dropped himself on the chair he was holding. </p><p>As the waitress approached to place their order, Potter apologized and walked toward the bathroom, but the girl noticed him before he could. </p><p>"Aww! It's James Potter!" Screamed and made some heads turn to them. There were camera flashes and Potter smiled at the crowd of fans. He was really trying to get away as quickly as possible, but when he turned back to their table, Severin wasn't there. </p><p>He glanced at his watch and his heart missing a beat, he was late for photoshoot.</p><p>Severin only glanced indifferently to the place she just left, a crowd taking her place.</p><p>He was pretty tall so she doesn’t even need to tiptoe to see him. Because of her hesitance, however, she managed to catch the helplessness in his face.</p><p>A tug on his wrist pulled him out of the crowd before a black cap was shoved to his head. Severin clicked her tongue as she pulled both of them out of the cafe.</p><p>Of course, the crowd chased after them. They had to take several turns here and there before they finally avoided the craze.</p><p>“And this, is why I didn’t want to go.” She mumbled while gasping for breath.</p><p>"That's the reason?" Potter asked. </p><p>Severin sour her face, "And the company." said. "Here. You're apologized, that's enough. Please keep your distance now."  Without giving him the chance to reply, she turned and mingled in the crowd.  </p><p>James looked at her in stupidity for a long moment, his mouth slightly open, then recovered and rushed to his place of work. </p><p>Sirius was already waiting there, leaning lazily against the wall, while the photographers were making final preparations.</p><p>“Thought you’re gonna ditch the shoot.” Sirius chuckled as he stood up and clapped him on the back.</p><p>James scoffed and shrugged him off, “Nah, just met a slight disturbance.”</p><p>“A girl?” Sirius guessed with a smirk on his face. He was merely joking, so he was shocked when his best friend actually nodded.</p><p>“Wait, what? Tell me about it!” His eyes widened as he asked. James rolled his eyes at his friend’s eagerness.</p><p>"There's not much to tell, just an ordinary girl who didn't want to go out for coffee with me... Sirius!"  Shouted James, raising his hands dramatically, "How could she refuse something like that?" </p><p>"Wait, wait. You want to tell me that a girl refused the great James Potter?!" Sirius made a complete display of astonishment. He smirked. "Bud, you seem to be losing your touch."</p><p>“I didn’t!” James retorted.</p><p>“Then, what about her?” Sirius goaded with a chuckle. “The great James Potter, rejected by a girl. Pity.”</p><p>James glared at his friend’s antique, “She didn’t reject me! She just refused my invitation!”</p><p>“Same thing.”</p><p>James glared at his good friend. And Sirius stuck his elbow in it. "So what will you do?"  </p><p>"What will I?" Repeated James. </p><p>Sirius raised his eyebrows. "Obviously, you're not going to let one proud girl ruin the sequence of victories for the girls' hearts, are you?" </p><p>James blinked and a slow, grinning smile began to spread across his face steadily. "Of course not. This girl will fall at my feet just like everyone else, you will see."</p>
