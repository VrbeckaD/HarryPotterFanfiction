          <div class="userstuff"><p>We were young, and careless, back then. Seven whole years at Hogwarts glittered before our eyes, so close we could almost reach out and touch them. But first came that all-determining event - that exposition of ourselves, which would lay down the foundations of the road that was to drive us through those life-affirming years of our lives.</p><p>Professor McGonagall led us into the hall. Twenty dozen pairs of eyes swivelled in unison in our direction. Beside me, my second-cousin-once-removed Daisy - the only person in the whole place whom I knew - turned and whispered to me in that thrilling, melodious voice of hers. </p><p>“These things do excite me <em>so,</em>” she murmured. “Look at that boy there - the one with the great black boots on. Doesn’t he just remind you of some - some archduke from somewhere?”</p><p>I had no time to reply, for we were ushered to the front of the hall and greeted by the Headmaster, Professor Dumbledore, a bespectacled man with long white hair and an even longer white beard who looked as though he had been at Hogwarts since the beginning of time. I don’t recall what that greeting entailed; all I remember is that immediately afterwards, the Sorting Ceremony commenced.</p><p>McGonagall surveyed her list of names. “Baker, Jordan!”</p><p>A slender, golden-haired girl emerged from the flock of first-years. I watched her with interest as she walked, her posture upright and her chin tilted upwards slightly like a young army cadet. At the chair she turned abruptly and sat with such immediate casualness that I was almost startled by the contrast - she might as well have been sitting in the chair of a café on the French Riviera. A battered brown hat that had evidently seen better days was lowered onto her head.</p><p>”Hmm,” the hat began. “Very shrewd, very <em>cunning</em>... wouldn’t make a bad Slytherin, but... I don’t sense much ambition, too wise, eh, too aim too high...a sound logical mind, I see... all right... RAVENCLAW!”</p><p>A smattering of applause rose up from the tables. The girl - Jordan - stood up with a series of rapid, deft movements and glimmered slenderly over to join her fellows in blue. <br/>
<br/>
“Buchanan, Thomas!”</p><p>Daisy’s archduke pushed his way somewhat aggressively to the front. He was a sturdy, straw-haired boy, powerfully built, with a touch of contempt on his supercilious face. “Ah,” said the hat, “a boy who values purity, I see... perhaps more so than honesty...” The boy’s face tightened a little. “Hmm... bold, too, though... but is courage truly what you value? And if I may say so, I do detect a certain tendency to... bend the truth...”</p><p>Again, the tightening of the face. “Well,” the hat mused, “I suppose it has to be SLYTHERIN!”</p><p>Thomas Buchanan swaggered his way to the far table, head buoyed up by the sound of whistles and cheers. I felt certain that Slytherin’s Quidditch Team had just earned themselves a new Beater.</p><p>I had hoped that there might be a few more “B”s before my name was called, but no such luck. “Carraway, Nicholas!” </p><p>Cringing at the unshortening of my name, I sat down and allowed the hat to be placed upon my head. I had always fancied myself an intellectual. I could see myself now, sat beside Jordan Baker on the Ravenclaw table... Or Hufflepuff, perhaps. If character is based on one’s virtues, then mine would be based on the fact that I am one of the few honest people that I have ever known.</p><p>“Mmm. Ahhh. I see. You esteem yourself <em>honest, </em>do you?” I presumed the question was rhetorical. “Well, you are fairly hard-working... reasonably loyal... which is more than can be said for most... unusually perceptive, too, though, and not unwise... but what do you value in others? Honesty, or wisdom?”</p><p>In all fairness, dishonesty was not something I blamed deeply in others in those days, nor was folly. This did not help in the slightest; it seemed that the hat was experiencing the same blue-yellow colour blindness as I was. Nonetheless, it was with assertion that it eventually cried, “HUFFLEPUFF!” </p><p>I have to admit I wasn’t surprised. Others have told me that I am wise, sensible even - but, looking back, I see that a wise person would not have allied themselves so closely with the people I did, with people like Gatsby. Only a Hufflepuff would do that.</p><p>And so the list of names went on. After “Civet, Webster!” and “Endive, Clarence!” came “Fay, Daisy!”; with the lamp-light shining on her raven-blue hair, my cousin ascended elegantly to the chair and sat down with all the graceful languor of a pedigree cat.</p><p>At this moment I noticed a boy, just to the right of me, watching her intently. There was an expression of rapt fascination on his face, as though some surreal and wondrous spectacle was being played out before his eyes; I could have sworn he was trembling slightly.</p><p>I glanced back at Daisy again. The hat appeared to be having some difficulty. “Now, what qualities... what values... which house would suit you, I wonder?” </p><p>This, I thought, was a good question. “Qualities” and “values”, courage and intelligence, loyalty and ambition; none of these appeared to suit the girl on the chair, who, as far as I could tell, was as exquisitely hollow as a porcelain doll. If I could offer her character one commendation, I suppose it would be that she knew how to please others: to entice, to thrill, to elicit admiration. Perhaps that was why, after a long pause, the hat eventually cried, “SLYTHERIN!”</p><p>Daisy rose, her face lit by a bright ecstatic smile, and sauntered across the hall to sit beside the Buchanan boy. Professor McGonagall was squinting at her list with a look a faint puzzlement, as though she had come across the name of somebody she had not expected. “Gatsby, Jay?”</p><p>I was surprised by the rapidity of the movement from my right. My neighbour, then, was Jay Gatsby - an elegant young rogue, attractively tanned, with a quality of restless, sporadic eagerness about his movements and behaviour. Even as he sat in the chair there was the tapping of a foot, the impatient opening and closing of a hand. “Interesting...” mused the hat. “Loyal, dedicated, hardworking... all the qualities of a true Hufflepuff... yet there’s ambition there, profound ambition... and a definite sense of cunning too...”</p><p>Gatsby glanced anxiously at the far table, where Daisy was talking animatedly to the boy beside her. I could see his lips forming the words “<em>Slytherin, Slytherin,</em>” over and over again. “Very well,” the hat said. “If you’re sure... better be SLYTHERIN!”</p><p>The boy stood up and smiled gratefully - much more than gratefully. He literally glowed with exultation as he found his way onto the nearest space on the Slytherin bench, some five or six places away from Daisy. I suspected a fondness for green and silver was not the only reason for eagerness to join those serpentine ranks.</p><p>After Gatsby came “Klipspringer, Ewing!”; “McKee, Chester!”; “Michaelis, Mavro!”; followed by a Finnish girl whose name I will not attempt to spell, and several others whose names I have since forgotten. I was aware that my stomach was beginning to rumble. By this point there were only three students left: two boys - one blond and anaemic, the other short and broad-nosed - and a girl, faintly stout, with that air of sassy superiority which some girls have at that age. It was the girl whom McGonagall called first. “Smolders, Myrtle!”</p><p>Myrtle sashayed up to the front. There was an immediately perceptible vitality about her, radiating from her body like warm smoke; her school skirt, being just wide enough for her hips, was nonetheless too short for her legs. I noticed the pale boy smile at her weakly - a smile she did not return.</p><p>”<em>Ah,</em>” the hat remarked knowingly. “Ambitious... duplicitous... self-confident... I know just where to put <em>you.” </em>It paused, apparently for dramatic effect. “SLYTHERIN!”</p><p>With an air of faintly ludicrous hauteur, Myrtle flounced her way over to the bench where she squashed herself promptly between Thomas Buchanan and my cousin. The bench was getting crowded now; his arm pressed against her side as she turned towards him, laughing. By this point Daisy had removed a small silver comb from her pocket and was brushing her hair somewhat distractedly. I don’t believe she paid any attention to the penultimate student - “Wilson, George!” - as he nervously set himself down.</p><p>George was a worn-out-looking boy in a worn-out-looking set of robes; the ruddy glow of the lamps lent no gleam of colour to his wan, ashen face. Only his eyes glinted faintly with a dim hope, perhaps, of joining that little circle that was forming over on the Slytherin table. But the hat, it seemed, had already made up its mind. “Hard-working, faithful, trusting, honest... Of course, it has to be HUFFLEPUFF!”</p><p>And so I was joined by George Wilson - or not <em>joined </em>exactly, for there was no longer any space at my side of the table. So Wilson was forced to perch on the end of the far bench whilst the final boy, “Wolfsheim, Meyer!” was Sorted into Slytherin. </p><p>I couldn’t help but notice how crowded the Slytherin bench was looking by this point - and, by contrast, how sparsely populated were the Gryffindors. Did we all possess some common deficiency, some defectiveness which left us lacking in courage and valor? But my thoughts were swiftly blown away by the prospect of the magic and excitement that was, surely, soon to come. And so with the candlelight and the ceiling of stars glittering above me, I had that now-familiar conviction that life was beginning all over again at Hogwarts.</p></div>
