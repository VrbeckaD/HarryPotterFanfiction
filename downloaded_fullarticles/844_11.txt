    <p>Wooyoung looked up to the sky, noticing that it was slowly turning to gray since they had arrived on the Quidditch field. He shivered in his green and silver cape, fearing a practice under the rain. He had eventually sat in the middle of the field, like many of the other members of the team, tired of waiting for the beginning of the practice, their brooms in their hands. He was playing with his leather gloves, hoping in vain that the motion would help him contain the anger that was crawling inside him.</p><p>“Is he gonna come?” asked impatiently Wooseok. He had been pacing around Minsoo for a few minutes now.<br/>
<br/>
“That’s what he told me” answered the latter, shrugging.<br/>
<br/>
Wooseok mumbled something that Wooyoung did not heard but, seeing his upset face, he knew he would have agreed to it. He sighed, holding back any kind of comment, knowing it would be useless, like it had always been. They all stayed a second in the silence, Minsoo hopelessly staring at the locker room’s door, his team sitting around him, except for Wooseok who had decided to fly away, annoyed. Wooyoung was still playing with his gloves, his broom resting next to him. He had no motivation to play anymore.<br/>
<br/>
“Someone’s coming!” said Minsoo, loudly enough for Wooseok.</p><p>Wooyoung got up immediately, his eyes narrowed, wondering if there was still hope left. Any kind of wonder went away as he understood that it was two persons rushing toward them. Next to him, Minsoo sighed and let go of hiw broom, while Suhwan and Yuvin were quickly making their way to them.<br/>
<br/>
“Yein told us to come tell you that San is in detention. All day,” explained Yuvin to Minsoo.<br/>
<br/>
“He tried to enter Flitch’s office yesterday night” added Suhwan.</p><p>There were a few laughs among the players. Wooyoung felt the rage boiling in his blood.<br/>
<br/>
“Thank you."<br/>
<br/>
The two Slytherin nodded and left the field with a sorry smile, while Minsoo was rubbing his forehead, worried.</p><p>“What do we do now?” asked Wooseok who was back on the ground.</p><p>“We cancel. It’s useless to practice without one of the player, and it’s not like we’re late or anything.”<br/>
<br/>
Wooyoung took his broom, furious.</p><p>“You should think about replacing him,” he said without thinking, “he does this all the time and you know it.”</p><p>“Find me a better player, and I would” answered back Minsoo with a cold look.</p><p>The other one bite his lower lip, staring back at his captain for a second before looking away and shrugging.</p><p>“That’s what I thought.”<br/>
<br/>
Wooyoung took a deep breathe, holding back his furious need to jumped at Minsoo’s throat and strangle him. Maybe he was right. Nobody in Slytherin could pretend to San’s spot, he was naturally more agile, more efficient and faster than anyone else as a catcher. He was a better player than Wooyoung, and he hated that idea. However, it was not the first time that the team was forced to cancel their practice because of him, and if San was not facing any consequences for it, everyone else was. Wooseok left the field first, not adding anything else, quickly followed by Minsoo and then the others. Dongpyo patted gently Wooyoung’s shoulder before leaving, which did not make him feel any better. He stayed there a second, alone, breathing in and out like he was able to. He, at least, hoped that San had to clean, muggle-way, the potion’s tools. And if it was possible, the jars usually filled with flobberworms.</p><p> </p><p align="center">*</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="left">“It’s always the same thing. He never shows up for practice and then arrives from nowhere two days before a game, with his dumbass looking smile, and he never has to face any consequences??”</p><p align="left">“Maybe you should be quieter, Wooyoung” said Jongho in a very calm voice, raising for a second his head from the book he was reading. “We’re in the library.”</p><p align="left">Wooyoung gave him a big annoyed sigh but came closer to his friend to whine even more, but more softly. Like he had thought when he was on the Quidditch field, the rain had took over the sunny week they had, and was now crashing against one of the library’s window where he had found refuge to find Jongho, without even taking the time to change. If the other members of the Quidditch team probably went back to the common room, surely to gain a few hours of sleep on this Saturday morning, he had been too upset to rest and had guessed the presence of the Ravenclaw in the library.</p><p align="left">“You play Quidditch too, don’t you think we should just replace him? The problem would be gone if we did so, okay, we might not have such a good player but at least we would have someone we can COUNT on and I think it’s still the most important- are you listening to me?”</p><p align="left">Jongho got up brutally, catching his book that was starting to fall off the table. Wooyoung frowned.</p><p align="left">“Sorry.” the Ravenclaw whispered, “I thought the librarian was coming, I didn’t want us to be thrown outside.”</p><p align="left">The Slytherin looked around but there was no one there. No one except two Hufflepuff who were quietly working and talking, a few tables near them.</p><p align="left">“But-”</p><p align="left">“So what were you saying? Team work?”</p><p align="left">He stared for a second at Jongho’s poker face, his usual face, who had found back the page he had left his book, putting it on the table so he could read and take notes at the same time. Wooyoung shrugged.</p><p align="left">“If we keep on missing practices like that because of him, we will lose, no matter how good he might be,” he continued, blowing air through his nose, angrily, “and when Gryffindor will win, it won’t be a surprise.”</p><p align="left">He clinched his teeth. Just the memory of the opposite team screaming and bouncing around the field when they had won against Slytherin, and so winning the Quidditch cup last year was making him upset.</p><p align="left">“Or maybe Ravenclaw,” said lightly Jongho, turning a page in his book, “Hufflepuff also has a great team.”</p><p align="left">“Not my point.”</p><p align="left">“Yes the point is San.”</p><p align="left">“Exactly!"</p><p align="left">It was Jongho’s turn to stare at him, in silence. Wooyoung could feel his cheeks suddenly heating up.</p><p align="left">“San,” he started less confident “San who must be kicked out of the team.”</p><p align="left">The Ravenclaw nodded, obviously not convinced at all for a reason that Wooyoung could not quite understand before turning another page in his book.</p><p align="left">“What is so important for you to be so focused on on a Saturday morning?!” he asked trying to look above the other’s one shoulder.</p><p align="left">“Tons of things that aren’t San.” answered Jongho without raising his eyes, “you know maybe if your captain thinks you don’t need more practice then he might be right?”</p><p align="left">“You should be on my side,” said Wooyoung, sulking.</p><p align="left">“Listen, worst scenario, Minsoo’s wrong, you’ll lose next game and then he will eventually decide to control San.”</p><p align="left">“BUT I DON’T WANNA LOSE!” exclaimed the Slytherin, rolling his eyes.</p><p align="left">A sudden “shush” cut them off and Wooyoung gave a little sorry smile to one of the Hufflepuf who was staring at him, obviously shocked by how loud he had been. The other one seemed to only look at Jongho.</p><p align="left">“You should go get your breakfast no?”</p><p align="left">“I’ve already...” started Wooyoung, confused.</p><p align="left">“Maybe you should rest, like you said, it’s Saturday morning, Quidditch is canceled, you should enjoy it. We’ll see each other at lunch.”</p><p align="left">Wooyoung opened his mouth to protest but then closed it immediately, realizing the unusual panic on his friend’s face. He promised himself, while standing up, to lead a full questioning later, when they would be able to talk quietly.</p><p align="left">“You’re right. Let’s talk later.”</p><p align="left">“And try not to think too much about San!”</p><p align="left">“I don’t think about San,” he mumbled, more for himself than for anyone else while leaving the library.</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="center">*</p><p align="left"> </p><p align="left">The common room was slowly starting to be filled with more or less awake students when Wooyoung entered. In their usual couch, those who were close enough tot he fire to stay warm during winter but also enough in the back to have a private space, Minsoo, Yein and Wooseok where whispering. A few first years where sitting in the free chairs, not too far from them, all glancing toward the trio, half frighten half fascinated. Dongpyo was playing the chess with a student his year that Wooyoung did not know. He immediately ran up in the dormitories, to change from his Quidditch uniform to more casual clothes. The room was still in the dark, a few of his roommates where still sleeping. He noticed that Eunsang had decided to sleep again after their practice had been canceled, and he was thinking that he should have done the same. He change discretely, took one of his Quidditch related books and went back downstairs. After all, he could also improved with this.</p><p align="left">Wooyoung found a free chair, near the big windows that let the Slytherin students a view of the bottom of the lake, which was surrounding the castle. For those unaccustomed this common room could be seen as unpleasant. There was no natural light, only the one filtered by the greenish water of the lake, reflecting a just as green lighting inside the room. Thus, the fireplace and the torches on the walls were almost always lighted up. Wooyoung did not mind this unusual atmosphere. Actually he found relaxing the idea of being in the middle of the lake, hidden and safe into a comfortable, thanks to the huge amount of chairs and sofas, green bubble. He enjoyed sometimes staring at the seaweeds undulating at a peaceful rhythm, hoping he could catch a glimpse of the giant squid, if it was in the mood. He thought that it might be all he needed this morning to forget completely about San.</p><p align="left">“Hey, Wooyoung,” shout Minsoo at him from his own sofa, “we will have practice tomorrow morning. Wooseok gained Slughorn’s approval.”</p><p align="left">The latter nodded, pretending to be focused on his book, even if he was grasping its pages a little bit too tightly.</p><p align="left">“Nine o’clock, it’s fine with you?”</p><p align="left">“I will be there, me,” he answered sharply.</p><p align="left">“Listen, Wooyoung,” said Minsoo while standing up and coming next to him. “I understand it’s frustrating to miss practice but Eunsang spied on the other teams and we’re obviously better than them.”</p><p align="left">Wooyoung closed his book, knowing that Wooseok and Yein where also following the conversation even if they had not moved at all.</p><p align="left">“You don’t have to be that worried.”</p><p align="left">“I’m not worried. I just don’t think it’s really… efficient.”</p><p align="left">Minsoo shrugged, “What matters is the result. As long as we’re the best, we don’t need to do more.”</p><p align="left">“So you won’t do anything against San?” asked vainly Wooyoung, his arms on his chest, trying his best to stay calm.</p><p align="left">“No.”</p><p align="left">He kept silent a second, while Wooyoung thought smoke was coming out of his own hears. “And if you don’t like it you can still quit,” finally said Minsoo.</p><p align="left">He was happy to still be seating as he felt all power leaving his legs. He opened his mouth but nothing came out. Minsoo nodded, satisfied by their talk and went back to his spot, letting Wooyoung realize what his captain had just said. After a while, he stood up and went back to his dormitory, not even really conscious of what he was doing. He lied down on his bed, his shoes still on his feet and the book on his hand.</p><p align="left">“If it can make you feel any better,” said Eunsang sleepy voice. “I hear a second year say that San has to clean up the place where they keep everything animal we use in potions. Only by hands. And he did not even manage to enter Flitch’s office.”</p><p align="left">He answered nothing but ended up smiling while imagining San’s disgusted face in front of the jars full of eyes, blood and other various types of organs.</p><p align="left"> </p>
