  <span>The only light in the room was coming from the wand of a man with Shabby hair.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A man followed behind him,</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Two bodies were draped over his shoulders.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Minerva,” He said fondly as he wrapped his arms around her shoulders.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Why am I doing the heavy lifting?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was said behind him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The bodies were thrown onto the floor with a loud thud. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Rem- I’m sorry, Ryan,” She corrected herself, “You look good! Happy,” She rested her hand on his shoulder. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Because I needed to cover our tracks,”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The other said as two more people walked in.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>More bodies were thrown onto the floor.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Minerva,” A deep voice drawled from the door frame, “It’s lovely to see you.”</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The three men and one woman started their plan.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The dead bodies were moved and arranged before runes and charms were placed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Slowly the features of the dead changed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>She took a step and gave the man a hug, “Congratulations. Never thought you would get married.” </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Should I ask where these bodies came from?” The blonde man asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The woman was muttering spells under her breath as the features changed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Stefan answered, “They were cadavers. A big enough bribe gets you results.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Well, I can tell you I honestly didn’t think I would.” He took her coat and hung it up. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>After a long while and several strong charms and runes,</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The adults took a step back.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Looking back at them were dead bodies of the children and themselves.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Hunter,” Ryan caught the attention of the boy, “Can you show Minerva her room?” </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They pulled out vials of their blood.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Charmed into stasis the uncorked the vials and started painting the scene.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They were reminded of the first night of the plan. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Oh, Harry,” She said quietly to herself, “You look good with brown hair and blue eyes.” </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Finally after setting up the evidence.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The dropped their old wands.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The new wands hummed happily in their hands.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Hunter,” He reminded her, “Yeah it was different but I like it. So does my girlfriend.” He reached out and grabbed Bailey’s vest.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The walked through the doorway,</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The stunned frozen DeathEaters not moving. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Leaving they all apparated to the Diagon Alley.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“A girlfriend? I think leaving Harry Potter behind was the best thing for you. I heard you have improved a lot.” </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>With their new permanent glamours on, they walked into a diner.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The four adults ordered food.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was after the food arrived that a blonde girl came up to them.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“I think so too,” He opened the door for his ex-professor, “I still have dissociative states and panic attacks. But I’m better.” </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hi,” She said cheerfully, “Is there anything else I can get you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Actually,” It was Clara that spoke up, “Could you do us a small task?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She dropped a small bag filled with coins.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Wonderful. The wizarding world mourns the loss of The-Boy-Who-Lived.” </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She agreed. Taking the bag she tucked into her apron.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Making her way to the floo, the money for the bill was left on the table.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And four adults left the British Wizarding World. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Well,” He started rubbing circles on Bailey’s forehead, “You don’t know what you got till it’s gone.” </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The morning came with the news. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Those missing for the past four months were found.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hope seemed to die with those who were reported lost. </span>
