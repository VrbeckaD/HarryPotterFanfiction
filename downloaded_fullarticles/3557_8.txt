    <p>It’s a whimsical notion and hardly one he’s going to admit to entertaining anywhere his father might be able to hear, but for weeks surrounding his tenth birthday, Draco fantasizes about Hogwarts sending him his invitation a year early.</p>
<p>“All of my friends are starting <em>this</em> year, Mother.” Draco doesn’t whine when Narcissa catches him at hovering around open windows with a blatant look of yearning on his face and forces him to sit down for a soothing cup of Kava tea. Malfoys don’t <em>whine</em>. They don’t exactly hold their tongue when they find themselves in a particularly disagreeable situation either, though. “<em>Harry Potter</em> is starting this year, I’m going to be a year behind everyone else. I’ll be at a <em>disadvantage</em>.”</p>
<p>He says the last word like it’s dirty. For a Malfoy, it more or less is.</p>
<p>Narcissa gives Draco a flat, mildly unimpressed look over the rim of her tea cup. She’s never exactly approved of Draco’s penchant for the dramatic. Nobody in his life really appreciates him as much as they should. “At a disadvantage for <em>what</em> precisely, Draco dear?” She asks, and then hardly gives him the opportunity to answer before adding, “It’s not as if you’ll be attending class with the second years Draco, you’ll be spending time with other children your age.”</p>
<p>“That’s the <em>point</em>, Mother.” Draco tells her laboriously. “I won’t have any classes with Harry Potter, how am I ever going to manage to trick him into becoming my best friend?”</p>
<p>“Trick, darling?”</p>
<p>Draco stuffs a whole biscuit into his mouth and chews mutinously, rather than answer her.</p>
<p>“Draco.” Narcissa says gently, setting aside her teacup to meet Draco’s eyes directly. “Is that what this is all about? Are you worried that you aren’t going to make any friends at Hogwarts?”</p>
<p>He swallows dryly (he’s regretting that biscuit now, Mother really needs to stop letting the house elves buy digestives) and reaches out to pour more coconut milk into his own cup for something to do, firmly avoiding his mother’s all too knowing stare. “Don’t be ridiculous.”</p>
<p>“You’ll have Gregory and Vincent, dear. They’ll only be a year ahead of you.” Mother reminds him, and Draco hardly thinks that bringing them up now is fair. Crabbe had already received his own Hogwarts invitation, and Goyle was sure to get his in the coming week. And that meant that he wouldn’t be able to see either of them for nearly an entire year, unless they decided to come home for the holidays (and why would they even want to, they’d be at <em>Hogwarts</em> with <em>Harry Potter</em>, why on earth would they ever want to leave?)</p>
<p>Attempting to explain any of this to his mother is clearly an effort in futility though. She just doesn’t get it. Parents never do. Draco drains his cup and makes an effort not to pull a face at the taste. He still doesn’t understand why he can’t just have a nice Chamomile like her.</p>
<p>He was <em>not</em> high strung.</p>
<p>Narcissa sips at her own Chamomile and tells him lightly, “Maybe you could try writing to them while they’re at school this year, if you’re worried about feeling lonely. I’m sure the boys would be thrilled to get an owl from you, dear.”</p>
<p>Draco is reasonably certain that mothers are naturally gifted at legilimency, or at the very least his own is, but he refuses to let her see how spot on she is right now. She’ll know anyway, regardless of whether or not he admits to anything, and at least this way they can both stoically allow him to cling to the tattered shreds of his pride simply by not acknowledging it out loud. “I suppose it would be a kindness to them both,” Draco says in what he hopes is a magnanimous manner. “They’re sure to be lost without me, after all.”</p>
<p>“Of course, dear.” His mother smiles serenely at him from across the table, and Draco shoves another three biscuits in his mouth at once only to regret it almost instantly.</p>
<p>“Mother.” He rasps a good five minutes later, after he’s finally managed to choke down the last of the digestives. “You really <em>must</em> speak to the house elves about the biscuits.”</p>
<p>“Have more tea, Draco.” Narcissa tells him simply, which Draco rather takes to be a firm ‘no’.</p><hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>Writing to Crabbe and Goyle proves to be an exercise in patience, more often than not. Or rather, getting them to write anything useful back is anyway.</p>
<p>Neither boy was especially verbose in person, and this apparently translated into astonishingly uninformative letters where, even after months and months of careful prompting on Draco’s part, had only resulted in learning that Harry Potter was in Gryffindor and very good at catching small balls in the sky.</p>
<p>(Draco assumes this is a reference to Quidditch, for his own sanity.)</p>
<p>Between lessons with various tutors, tea with his mother, and doing battle with muggle flying machines on the house broom, Draco steadily places orders for the primary first year texts piecemeal as Crabbe and Goyle owl him to say that a troll had broken into the school, and did he know which constellation shared the star Alpheratz with the square of Pegasus asterism, or the laws governing Animagus registration?</p>
<p>If nothing else, the practice is doing wonders for his penmanship, and patiently coaching Crabbe and Goyle through magical theory is certain to prepare him sufficiently for starting Hogwarts himself in the coming year.</p>
<p>Mother looks immeasurably smug whenever he receives a new letter, but it manages to settle his nerves better than any measure of tea ever could and he decides not to hold it against her <em>too</em> much.</p><hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco nearly hugs the house elf that brings him his Hogwarts invitation when it comes, before remembering that the portraits had a tendency to gossip with his father when he did things they found unseemly, and hugs were almost certain to fall within the purview.</p>
<p>Instead he, rather benevolently he felt, informs the house elf that the next time he needs to punish himself for thinking poorly of Lucius (and with Father it was really only a matter of time) he could come to Draco instead for instructions. Dobby clearly deserves a reward for his timely delivery, and for the fact that on more than one occasion he’s snuck Draco chocolate biscuits on the sly.</p>
<p>“Mother,” Draco announces triumphantly once he’s finally managed to track her down, wielding the invitation like a weapon or, on second thought upon getting a good look at her face, a shield. “It’s time to go to Diagon Alley for my school supplies.”</p>
<p>“It’s three in the morning, Draco.” Narcissa explains patiently from where she’s sitting up in bed and staring across the dim expanse of her bedroom almost despairingly. “None of the shops will even be open right now.”</p>
<p>“Ah.” He says faintly, and then glances suddenly about the room as if he’s only just noticed where they were. He might have been suffering from a touch of sleep deprivation at the moment. Just a bit. “Father’s… not here?” Draco asks tentatively, not putting it past Lucius Malfoy at all to suddenly loom up out of the darkness with ominous disapproval.</p>
<p>His mother softly sighs. “He’s probably in the basement again, you know your father.”</p>
<p>“Ah.” Draco says again, and then finds himself at a loss to say anything else.</p>
<p>“Goodnight Draco.” Mother says leadingly, giving him a way out.</p>
<p>“Goodnight Mother.” He says in relief, and turns to leave her alone in the dark with her thoughts.</p>
<p>(Or maybe that was just him.)</p><hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>“On second thought,” Draco says carefully when Father informs him the next day that they’ll be making a stop off in Knockturn Alley before taking care of his school shopping, “we don’t have to go today. I already have most of the required reading, there’s no rush really.”</p>
<p>The look Mother gives him speaks <em>measures</em>. All she says out loud however is, “You know the defense against the dark arts texts are different this year.”</p>
<p>Which is. True. And of course she remembers that, since it was only a few hours ago that he was complaining to her about all of the Lockhart books on the list and asking what was wrong with <em>last year’s</em> reading, aside from the fact that it had apparently been assigned by a child murdering lunatic. (“Just don’t call the man that in front of your father, dear.” Narcissa warns him mildly, and “It was only attempted child murder after all, wasn’t it?”)</p>
<p>Draco’s never read a Lockhart book before, but he’s seen the man’s picture in the paper plenty of times and he’s pretty sure the thing <em>winked</em> at him. Which was more than enough for the man to make it on his list, really. “Not to mention you’ve been begging us to let you get your wand a year early so you could get some practical experience before school starts.”</p>
<p>Also true. It’s pretty unfair of his mother to keep using his words against him like this. If he didn’t know any better he’d think she actually wanted him to get abducted in Knockturn Alley and have his body parts sold off as potion ingredients by people that knew his father well enough that the whole family got loyal customer discounts.</p>
<p>Mother was going to buy his eyeballs for a song, and the idea of him being <em>cheap</em> was honestly the most terrifying part of this entire scenario.</p>
<p>“I am tasteful and expensive.” Draco insists softly, a mantra that he repeats daily to himself in the mirror as he’s getting ready.</p>
<p>“Of course you are, dear.” Narcissa says understandingly, and Draco charitably adjusts his opinion of her to at least insisting that the vendor charge her market value for his eyes. She was a Black after all, tasteful and expensive might as well have been on their coat of arms (Draco thinks it might have been, up until that mess with Sirius - there was nothing tasteful about a Gryffindor, after all). “Which is why your father is going to buy you something nice in Diagon Alley if you’re well behaved while he’s running his own errands.”</p>
<p>Situational bribery was the absolute worst. Mostly because it tended to work so well on Draco. “Something expensive.” He stipulates.</p>
<p>“Draco please.” His mother says serenely. “As if that was ever in doubt.”</p><hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>“Touch nothing, Draco.” Lucius tells Draco when they step into Borgin and Burkes, and Draco quietly considers a glass eye in the case in front of him and the fact that it appears to be gleaming wetly, before assiduously shoving his hands in his pockets and sniffing in what he hopes is a delicate manner reminiscent of his mother.</p>
<p>He glances about the shop warily, somewhat hesitant to bring the matter up here lest Father suddenly get the notion that eleven was quite old enough to start mucking about with… Draco blanches and skitters back from a stand prominently displaying what looked to be a <em>severed hand</em>, and then carefully checks to make sure that his father hasn’t witnessed any of the display. “When Mother said you would buy me a present, she didn’t mean here, did she?” Draco attempts not to sound <em>too</em> concerned by the prospect.</p>
<p>He hardly sees what good a cursed necklace is going to do in making him any friends at school though.</p>
<p>“A racing broom.” Lucius answers shortly, clearly impatient to start his business with the shopkeep.</p>
<p>Draco’s countenance brightens instantly, despite the fact that an array of human skulls appear to be leering at him currently. “There’s a new model out.” He says, pleased, and then, “Do you think Hogwarts will let me bring it with me though? Only I think I remember reading that first years weren’t allowed.”</p>
<p>Lucius grits his teeth, and Draco takes a moment to quietly mourn for the health of his father’s teeth before he’s saying, “If they’re going to let Harry Potter join the Quidditch team his first year, they honestly don’t have a leg to stand on in regards to giving other first years a chance to do the same.”</p>
<p>Father’s tone is his patented ‘or else’ one (he only ever really approved of special treatment if he was the one receiving it) and Draco perhaps wisely chooses to ignore the rather opportune jumping off point to bring up his letters to Crabbe and Goyle and their rather desperate need to try bringing <em>context</em> into what they write back to him. He just nods mutely and steps back deeper into the store when Mr. Borgin finally decides to make an appearance from the back room, the two very quickly falling into a discussion of Basement Things that Draco would honestly prefer not to be involved with anyway.</p>
<p>He’s <em>eleven</em>. He just wants to go to magic school, make a friend in his own year, and maybe join a Quidditch team if they let him. Basement Things can stay in the basement for now.</p>
<p>While he still has a choice on the matter.</p>
<p>A dark, looming sort of cabinet over Draco’s left shoulder sneezes violently, and he takes a moment from him brooding to say, “Bless you,” lightly, before having second thoughts upon further consideration, and chooses to scream instead.</p>
<p>“Draco honestly,” Lucius snaps without bothering to look up from where he’s leaning in over a curled parchment list of BT (abbreviated for ease of reference) with Mr. Borgin. “Do try to comport yourself with <em>some</em> measure of grace.”</p>
<p>“But--” The cabinet door opens just enough to reveal a boy a little older than him covered in soot with a finger pressed pleadingly up to his lips, and Draco decides that either the cabinet is a magical artifact that eats filthy children (in which case Draco is perfectly safe) or the boy is simply hiding which, well, Draco can hardly blame him if he is. The boy looks utterly out of his depths, and he feels a strange sort of empathy for him, all things considered. “--I… stubbed my toe?” He finishes somewhat weakly, but the boy looks relieved and his father has started talking poisons with Mr. Borgin with only a distracted:</p>
<p>“Just don’t break anything, Draco.”</p>
<p>So Draco’s pretty sure he managed to more or less get away with it. Perhaps his improvisational skills really were improving, he would have to tell Mother the good news (she despaired quite often of him and how poor he was at lying, but it hardly seemed like the sort of thing he should be proud of being good at, and what did he have to lie about anyhow, strange boys in strange cabinets aside).</p>
<p>Now however, Draco is determined to get a better idea of what it is exactly that he had gotten away with. He takes one more cautionary look over his shoulder to make sure his father’s attention is sufficiently distracted, takes a deep, fortifying breath, and steps into the cabinet with the boy, closing the door again quickly behind him.</p>
<p>“Hello.” Draco says dully, for lack of anything better to say to break up the sudden and awkward silence that falls between them (his etiquette lessons have not adequately prepared him for this moment). “They’re not selling <em>you</em> in this shop, are they?” He asks with some small measure of mounting horror because he honestly wouldn’t put it past Mr. Borgin to try.</p>
<p>“No!” The boy gives him a wide-eyed look behind broken glasses, and then an even wider look over Draco’s shoulder at the closed cabinet door like he was worried that his shouting would bring Lucius Malfoy down upon them like a furious pit viper.</p>
<p>Which honestly, putting aside the fact that his father was far more likely to command Mr. Borgin to exert himself in such a manner than do the work himself, was highly unlikely for the simple fact that the topic of poisons could keep Father occupied for <em>hours</em> if he let it, which was rather the reason that Draco had wanted to go shopping with his mother today instead.</p>
<p>When Lucius fails to appear, the boy elaborates for Draco a bit more softly, shoulders hunched miserably up around his ears. “I, uh, got lost on the floo network when I was trying to get to Diagon Alley.” He flushes just brightly enough for Draco to get a glimpse at it under all that soot. “Guess I mumbled my words.”</p>
<p>“How terrible.” Draco says with the air of someone who has upon numerous occasions in the past ‘accidentally’ said Diagon Alley when he was meant to follow his father to Knockturn instead. “You’re not too far off, honestly.” Spotting the faint glimmering chance of escape for what it is and refusing to let it slip through his fingers, he offers somewhat selfishly, “I could probably show you the way and get back before Father even notices I’m gone.”</p>
<p>There’s a good chance this boy goes to Hogwarts too (his English is a touch too natural for him to be visiting from Beauxbaton or Durmstrang after all) and starting off his first year with an older student being beholden to him is just good preparation, really.</p>
<p>This boy doesn’t look like he’s meant for BT anyway, and Draco holds out a hand and smiles in a carefully cultivated winsome manner (only for the whole effect to be spoiled by a sudden sneeze, and Mr. Borgin will <em>hear</em> from him later about his cleaning treatments, there was simply no excuse for this much dust).</p>
<p>“Alright.” The boy says after a moment, returning Draco’s smile with his own tentative one and placing his hand in Draco’s.</p>
<p>“Ah.” Draco says almost regretfully, looking down at their joined hands with a baleful expression. “The soot.” That was going to be a hassle to scrub off later. He doesn’t let go though, just raises his free hand up to his mouth in a mirror of the boy’s gesture to him earlier. “Stay low and <em>touch nothing</em>.”</p><hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>They don’t speak again until they’re outside on the street, and it’s the boy staring at the shop across the way with a window dressing of severed, shrunken heads with dawning horror and asking, “Are those…”</p>
<p>“Probably, yes.” Draco interrupts and tugs insistently on his hand to lead him down the alley with a low muttered, “Try not to meet anyone’s eyes, alive or dead it’s really all the same around here.”</p>
<p>Draco brushes quickly past a witch that calls his name and doesn’t stop.</p>
<p>“Do you know her?” The boy asks, craning his head around to look back at her and sending the both of them stumbling a bit in his distraction.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately.” Draco says grimly. She had a terrible habit of trying to pawn off counterfeit items on his mother. Which never <em>worked</em> obviously, Malfoys were no fools, but the fact that she even bothers to try was simply unforgivable. “Ah, here we a--” They step out into the sun of Diagon Alley, and almost immediately Draco gets bowled over by what appears to be a breathing, padded wall. “Ouch.”</p>
<p>“HARRY!” The wall bellows and reaches out to lift the older boy bodily off the ground, and consequently Draco as well since they’ve yet to let go of each other’s hand. “What d’yeh think yeh were doin’ down there?”</p>
<p>“Hagrid.” The boy whose name is apparently Harry says with no small measure of relief, and then haltingly tries to explain about his floo mistake and Draco’s own involvement in his escape, while the giant man slaps heartily on his back and clears great plumes of soot from his hair and clothes which, Draco supposes, is an acceptable alternative to spelling the soot away.</p>
<p>Draco sways a bit on his feet and stares up at the man in mute terror when he turns his attention on him to thank him for taking care of Harry, and also, did he get lost down there too?</p>
<p>“Something like that.” He says without meeting Hagrid’s eyes. He had <em>felt</em> lost in any case, it practically isn’t even a lie at all. Draco tactically widens his eyes and tries to look as small as possible under the behemoth’s considering stare (at least looking small isn’t any sort of particular challenge in the present company). He really hopes that his father hasn’t made a poor impression on this man at some time in the past, Draco looked far too much like Lucius for his comfort sometimes and at least Mother was pretty enough to distract people from uncharitable thoughts more often than not.</p>
<p>For a brief, terrifying moment Draco considers batting his eyes as well, before remembering how déclassé Mother found such behavior. Particularly with what looks to Draco to clearly be one of The Help. He twitches faintly and looks across at Harry instead.</p>
<p>Harry stares back at him with a confused, slightly concerned look, but doesn’t say anything to refute him either.</p>
<p>Hagrid frowns down at him, and Draco doesn’t even realize that he was holding his breath until he turns back to Harry and asks, “D’yeh come here by yerself?” and Draco lets out a low, relieved sigh and slinks behind Harry as much as he can manage with a kid that’s honestly not that much bigger than Draco to begin with. Public evisceration is <em>probably</em> not something he has to worry about as much in Diagon Alley, but a human shield can’t hurt anyway.</p>
<p>A thin, sooty hand pats Draco comfortingly on the shoulder, and Draco doesn’t even care that the other boy is getting his clothes dirty.</p>
<p>“With the Weasleys.” Harry says with a shake of his head, and Draco frowns and tries to remember what it was his father had told him about the Weasleys.</p>
<p>Almost as if summoned, there’s a faint shout of “Harry!” to their left and he turns to see what looks like a river of red hair flowing up the cobblestone path towards them and, ah yes, now he remembers. Draco hunches down and attempts to hide even more fully behind Harry.</p>
<p>This is almost certainly going to go poorly for him.</p>
<p>The Weasley Patriarch stumbles to a stop in front of them with his gaggle of Hellions at his heel, and Draco is so desperately distracted by the man’s tragic bald spot that he doesn’t actually hear a word he says until Harry’s answering, “Knockturn Alley,” so Draco figures they were asking him where he’d come out instead.</p>
<p>“Excellent!” Draco’s never before witnessed a human being speak in stereo, but either the Weasleys have a set of twins to their name (and oh god, twins are <em>hereditary</em>, there are going to be even more of these people down the line and Draco is already distinctly outnumbered) or there is a spell out there where you can animate your own reflection and Draco desperately needs to find it.</p>
<p>Strictly for humanitarian reasons, of course.</p>
<p>“We’ve never been allowed.” Another Weasley bemoans and, oh god, there are even <em>more</em> Weasleys running up now, is there no end to them?</p>
<p>“I regret so many things.” Draco says with a low sound of despair. Harry laughs sharply in surprise, Draco shoves his shoulder lightly in retaliation, and suddenly every single Weasley eye is trained unerringly on the two of them, or rather, to be more specific, on Draco himself. This would be a very good time for Draco to know a few swear words, but no, that was <em>beneath</em> them as a family (which was utter garbage, Draco has seen pictures of the family members that have wound up in Azkaban and Aunt Bellatrix looked like a woman who knew a thing or two about creative language).</p>
<p>“Who’s your friend, Harry?” Arthur Weasley (Draco <em>remembers</em> now, and oh, Father is not going to be happy with him) asks in a voice that suggests he knows exactly who Draco is.</p>
<p>Draco willfully resists the urge to stick his tongue out at the man when Harry proudly introduces him with, “he helped me find my way out.”</p>
<p>He preens, and his smile only freezes a little on his face when the Weasley mother blinks at him in concern and asks, “what were you doing in such an awful place, dear?”</p>
<p>“He--” Harry starts, no doubt in <em>his</em> mind helpful. But even if good intentions are only something that Draco is familiar with theoretically, he’s still well aware of some of the potentially condemning things about Draco’s father that Harry might have heard while he was hiding in that cabinet, and whatever personal feelings Draco has about being dragged out to Borgin and Burkes in the first place, he’s not going to set a poor, rabid ginger on his father.</p>
<p>“Trying not to touch anything.” Draco speaks quickly over Harry, without actually giving himself a chance to think up something a bit more clever to say. At least some hopeless, wild little lie hadn’t attempted to fall out of his mouth, he was self-aware enough to know that nobody would have believed him then. “Harry’s not the only one who’s had trouble with the Floo Network before.” He adds which is, strictly speaking, not a lie, but enough to have Harry turning his head and shooting Draco a marked look of concern that Draco chooses fiercely to ignore while a Mother (even a Mother so distinctly different from his own) is looking at him.</p>
<p>They can smell fear, he’s pretty sure. Mothers, that is. And Draco doesn’t want to be afraid, <em>shouldn’t</em> be afraid when he’s finally going to Hogwarts, he refuses to let Father and his Basement Things ruin this for him.</p>
<p>So he takes a fortifying breath and chatters on about his first year of Hogwarts and how anxious and excited he is about the whole thing, mentions tea and biscuits and waiting at the window for the post to arrive, and maybe a little bit about all his friends already being at Hogwarts and how he’s worried he won’t make any friends his own age, and whether he’ll get homesick during the holidays…</p>
<p>And the whole thing’s a bit embarrassing really, but he keeps talking until he sees the adult’s eyes glaze over in distraction and then abruptly lets his words peter out like he’s lost his breath, gasping shallowly for effect. Draco might be a terrible liar, but he always knew his ‘dramatics’ would come in handy someday, because no one is going to be asking him any more weird, probing questions about Knockturn Alley except maybe Harry, who hasn’t stopped staring at him through cracked, dirty glass this entire time.</p>
<p>“That’s nice dear.” The Weasley mother says almost tentatively after a moment, smiling warmly and nudging the only other Weasley female present forward encouragingly. “Ginny here will be starting at Hogwarts this year too. I’m sure the boys will make sure to look after the two of you.”</p>
<p>The twins snicker rather tellingly and Draco makes a mental note not to get caught alone with them. Eldest Weasley Son straightens up and nods stoically like he’s just been given an order by the Minister of Magic himself (he’s probably going to try to avoid this one as well). Weasley Son the Younger, with a smudged nose wrinkled slightly in distaste at the missive, eyes Draco dubiously and does not appear to be at all pleased with Harry’s hand on Draco’s arm, and <em>this </em>one Draco is relatively sure he can handle.</p>
<p>He’s had play dates with Blaise Zabini, after all.</p>
<p>“Harry!” For a boy with broken glasses, a sooty face, and old baggy clothes Harry is apparently in high demand, as a girl with hair so frizzy it actually makes Draco want to cry to look at it waves at them all from the steps of Gringotts before dragging two dull looking adults that are undoubtedly her parents over to meet them. Also, the Weasley child his own age -- Ginny, was it? -- is staring at Harry in a strangely ravenous manner for an eleven-year-old.</p>
<p>Maybe the Weasleys couldn’t keep her properly fed? Draco pats absently about his pockets until he manages to discover an unopened packet of biscuits and all but shoves it into the poor girl’s hand.</p>
<p>They were the digestives, anyway.</p>
<p>She looks startled, and finally drags her eyes away to land on Draco instead (which is mildly terrifying, Mother did always warn him that altruism could lead to cannibalism, but he’d always thought she was speaking more metaphorically) but then the girl that Draco wants desperately to give hair care tips to does a magnificent bit of magic to fix Harry’s glasses and Draco has far more pressing things to consider now.</p>
<p>Like whether it would be okay to break Harry’s glasses again and ask her to repeat the spell because he’d been distracted worrying for his life the first time.</p>
<p>“Honestly Harry.” The girl scolds him, pulling out a handkerchief from her pocket and scrubbing roughly at a soot smudge on his cheek. “You always find a way to get into trouble in the strangest places, don’t you? What <em>happened</em> to you?”</p>
<p>“I’m fine, Hermione.” Harry mumbles around her scrubbing. “Draco here helped me find my way out to Diagon Alley.”</p>
<p>“<em>Draco</em>?” Jealous Weasley snickers even as Draco is slumping down next to Harry, trying to make himself as small as possible and cursing his parent’s decision to follow the family constellation tradition when Crabbe and Goyle got away with nice normal names like Vincent and Gregory. Hermione is already whirling on the Weasley with a dark look and brandishing her kerchief like a weapon, however. “Ronald Weasley, did you just laugh at that poor boy’s name after he went to the trouble of helping Harry?”</p>
<p>Ronald Weasley freezes wonderfully and utters a weak, low, “Uh, no?”</p>
<p>“You’re very good at magic.” Draco beams at Hermione, <em>finally</em> squirming out of Harry’s grip in the distraction of his own quiet scolding of the Weasel (this whole being younger than everyone else helping garner him sympathy is an intriguing concept, and he’s going to have to look further into it for sure). “Do you know any to deal with the soot? Could I see your wand?”</p>
<p>Hermione appears to be a touch flustered by his attention. “Oh, it’s nothing that impressive, honestly. Just a basic charm… are you starting Hogwarts this year, Draco?”</p>
<p>“Nobody is going to Hogwarts this year if we don’t get this shopping done today.” Mother Weasley intercedes, slightly frazzled, and starts ushering them all up the steps toward Gringotts which, ah. Hadn’t exactly been in Draco’s plans when he’d originally pulled Harry out of Borgin and Burkes and, oh, Father was sure to notice that he was missing by now.</p>
<p>Harry leans forward and whispers, “Will you get into trouble with your dad for leaving?”</p>
<p>“Oh, almost certainly.” Draco sighs regretfully, and then pushes on ahead of the group to go argue with a goblin about letting him into the family vault without his father present. Something he’d be able to do much better without being leered at by poor people with unfortunate hair (he doesn’t actually know the financial situation Harry or Hermione are in, but in comparison to his own family just about <em>everyone</em> was poor honestly, a strange benefit of having so much family in prison).</p>
<p>And anyway, it would only hurt his case with Father more if someone inside happened to mention seeing Draco in such questionable company to the man when he makes his own stop here later.</p>
<p>Adults really were the worst sort of gossips.</p>
<p>“You! There! <em>Yes</em>, you.” Draco waves a goblin over imperiously, only to discover that the creature is actually a centimeter or two taller than him, which is simply unacceptable. “Find me someone shorter that can take me to my family vault, would you?”</p>
<p>“Name?” The goblin mutters almost mutinously, looking like he’d very much rather leave Draco down one of the deeper tunnels to starve or possibly be eaten by a dragon.</p>
<p>Draco draws himself up as high as he can possibly manage without actually resorting to standing on his toes. “Malfoy.”</p>
<p>Ten seconds later the goblin has summoned over a far more appropriately short compatriot and Draco is being led back to the vaults with something that could almost be labeled as ‘respect’ and, honestly, Draco never really tires of being able to wield his surname like a weapon.</p>
<p>He’s going to need all the weapons he can get if even the <em>goblins</em> are taller than him.</p><hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>Back out on the steps of Gringotts, Draco entertains the idea of taking the chance to slip off on his own to do his shopping, but before he can make a decision one way or another Harry is knocking at his shoulder, Weasel is looking surly beside him, and Hermione bustles them all down the steps saying, “we can show you around to all the best shops for school supplies, Draco, <em>oh</em>, and I can give you a list of good books for additional reading, do you have a favorite subject yet?”</p>
<p>Draco is sort of quietly impressed by how many words Hermione can get out with one breath and nearly informs her that he is <em>quite</em> familiar with the layout of Diagon Alley, before deciding that he’d rather like to hear about her reading list after all and tells her instead, “... potions.”</p>
<p>And then promptly worries that he’s somehow said something wrong when all three pull peculiar faces at his answer. Hermione doesn’t give him enough time to truly start entertaining the idea of hyperventilating before she’s smiling again (noticeably strained, even by Draco’s admittedly self-absorbed standards) and offering up a weak, “I know a few reference materials that might help. And I can recommend a few extra ingredients to buy along with the standard first year set.”</p>
<p>Draco contemplates telling her that he can get hold of just about any reference material easily enough by simply writing to his godfather, but decides that he’d rather not see what their reaction to that would be if the mere mention of potions had them so stricken (poor dears must be abysmal on the subject, maybe he could give them a few pointers when they weren’t feeling so raw?) and so he just nods instead.</p>
<p>“<em>Oh</em>, but you’ll need a wand first, of course.” Hermione declares abruptly, slipping an arm through his and pulling him off in one direction down Diagon Alley without even pausing to see if the other two are following. “And robes, scales, a cauldron…”</p>
<p>Harry gives Draco a very specific wide-eyed look when he manages a glance over his shoulder at the other boy that very much suggests he simply go along with the mad girl. And for once in his life?</p>
<p>Draco’s choosing the path of least resistance.</p><hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>Flourish and Blotts is <em>packed</em>, and Draco knew he should have insisted they simply order the Lockhart books and avoid this whole mess. Instead now he’s going to be forced to mingle with the common rabble, and all the while dragging along a suitcase bigger than him (which Hermione had, at least, thoughtfully taught him a lightning charm for). Draco quietly resolves to bruise as many ankles and shins as it takes to make these people <em>get out of his way</em>.</p>
<p>(Maybe Mother had had a point about private tutors, if the Hogwarts hallways are in any way this crowded he was going to start hexing some people. Just as soon as he learned a hex, anyway.)</p>
<p>“We can actually meet him!” Hermione says shrilly near Draco’s ear without warning, startling him into dropping his trunk on Ron’s foot, so at least something good came out of what was no doubt irreparable damage to his hearing. And all for… Draco’s gaze follows hers up to a banner over the entrance of the store proudly announcing a Lockhart signing, and he <em>knew</em> they should have just ordered his books.</p>
<p>“I can’t stay here.” Draco says almost desperately, turning to look at Harry. “None of us are safe.”</p>
<p>Harry gives him a worried, confused look for his trouble, though at least momentarily he’s stopped trying to push Draco in after Hermione, who’s already been lost to the tide of simpering middle aged mothers (it’s too late for her, all they can do now is try to save themselves).</p>
<p>“He might <em>wink</em> at us, Harry.”</p>
<p>And, well, Draco really doesn’t see what Harry’s got to laugh about right now, and tells him as much.</p>
<p>“Has anyone ever told you that you’re kind of overdramatic?” Harry asks with an almost fond smile and a regrettable renewal in shoving him deeper into the shop.</p>
<p>“Never.” Draco says with a delicate sniff. “At least manhandle me in the direction of the reference texts, if I wind up in line with the rest of the desperate horde I’m liable to bite your hand, soot and all. And then I’ll probably cry because even discounting highly questionable fireplaces, I haven’t the slightest idea where your hands have been and will be liable to catch something.”</p>
<p>Harry laughs again like Draco isn’t being completely serious and shifts the vector of their entry to match Draco’s demands. “Well we can’t have that now, can we?” He says.</p>
<p>“I’m not an attractive crier.” Draco confides lowly with Harry, and he can’t even really say <em>why</em>, apart from temporary insanity. “I’ve tried, trust me, but there’s nothing flattering about blotchy skin. And I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but I am trying to make a good impression on you.”</p>
<p>“I think biting me is more liable to make a bad impression on me than crying.” Harry says with a slight frown, sparing Draco only a momentary glance before craning his head to try and catch sight of his friends (which, considering their hair, shouldn’t be nearly as challenging as it apparently is, Draco suspects at least one side of the equation is letting the other side down and he won’t be certain until he can observe them all simultaneously but he’s more than willing to lay the blame at Weasley’s feet for now).</p>
<p>Draco can’t even begin to imagine how that could possibly be true. “I really think you’re underestimating the danger of blotchy skin, but anyway you’ll have <em>deserved</em> it if I bite you.” He reminds the other boy patiently. “For leading me into danger. You’re older you know, you’re supposed to set a good example.”</p>
<p>“I’m probably not the best person to look to with that.” Harry tells him wryly. “Try Hermione. Or maybe Percy. He’s a Prefect, you know.”</p>
<p>“Percy <em>Weasley</em>?” Draco asks, perhaps a bit shrilly, an unfortunate side effect of his fighting back hysterics. “<em>I could catch something</em>!”</p>
<p>Harry’s expression is caught somewhere between concerned and amused, and he can’t seem to settle on a response before the opportunity is wrenched sharply from his grasp by a crisp, expansive voice calling out across the length of the shop, “It <em>can’t</em> he Harry Potter?”</p>
<p>“What. Where?” Draco says immediately, turning his head to scan the shop for the boy.</p>
<p>Harry flinches next to him, and they only have time to exchange a brief look of shared horror before Gildory Lockhart is pouncing upon Harry through the crowd and manhandling him up to stand next to him at the table, looking pained. Draco, meanwhile, is pretty sure he’s hyperventilating.</p>
<p>Lockhart is busy saying something that is no doubt extravagantly unimportant in light of finding out who Harry is, so Draco ignores him in favor of banging his head rhythmically against the nearest bookshelf until Hermione helpfully rematerializes with a frankly staggering stack of books in one arm and reaches out to cushion his head with her other hand.</p>
<p>“Oh Draco.” She sighs in muted concern. “Are you upset that we haven’t found your parents yet? Don’t worry, I’m sure they’re somewhere nearby, there’s just a lot of people in the shop so it’s hard to find people. We could try an amplification spell and make an announcement for them?”</p>
<p><em>That</em> is enough to make Draco freeze, forehead resting gingerly against her cupped palm and head turned slightly to give her a properly horrified look. “Absolutely not!”</p>
<p>Literally the one thing that Draco can imagine making this situation worse at this point would be to add his father to the mix.</p>
<p>Like an actor that’s been waiting all this time on the wings for his cue, or at the very least, for the most appropriate moment to make a dramatic entrance, his father strides forward through a crowd that can’t help but part around him (Draco had his suspicions this is why Father carries around that cane, to whack at the ankles of any who – quite literally - cross him, because honestly that’s what Draco would do with a cane like that too). “Draco, where <em>have</em> you been?”</p>
<p>For a moment, Draco seriously contemplates curling up into a ball on the ground to cry, but then Lucius’ penetrating gaze settles tellingly on where Draco is touching Hermione, and Draco is whipping himself away so quickly that he’s relatively certain he gets whiplash from the effort.</p>
<p>He closes his eyes and takes a moment to settle his nerves along with the lay of his clothes, and when he opens his eyes again he figures he’s as ready as he’ll ever be to deal with all of… this. Him.</p>
<p>“<em>Father</em>.” He stresses, widening his eyes in honest distress and feigned relief, words sounding unavoidably stilted as they fall from his mouth (hopefully Hermione will just assume he’s having a mental breakdown, rather than lying very badly). “Thank goodness I’ve found you, I got lost on the Floo Network again!”</p>
<p>Lucius raises one eyebrow so very slowly that the actual progression is entirely imperceptible, but Draco does his very best not to fidget or look <em>too</em> guilty and eventually he’s forced to say, “we didn’t take the Floo, Draco.”</p>
<p>No kidding, Draco thinks mutinously behind a pained, but all too well-practiced earnest expression. If they had he would have never wound up in Borgin and Burkes in the first place which was rather, Draco suspects, the entire point of them apparating in the first place.</p>
<p>“I’m certain we must have, Father.” Draco says aloud through a polite rictus smile. In his periphery, he can see that Harry (Potter!) has managed to escape from Lockhart’s shiny clutches and returned with a stack of books and the Weasel besides, but Draco can’t turn away from his father right now, isn’t even sure he’d want to see whatever expression they’re sharing anyway. If the potions mishap from earlier was any sort of indication, they’re absolutely miserable at guarding their feelings from their faces.</p>
<p>It was a good afternoon while it lasted, at least.</p>
<p>Carefully, purposefully, he adds, “if we hadn’t, how else would I have wound up in Knockturn Alley. Alone.”</p>
<p>Father narrows his eyes and Draco widens his own, and then Arthur Weasley barrels artlessly through the rising tension with a sharp, pointed, “<em>Lucius Malfoy</em>, I thought that was your son. Having a little trouble keeping track of him, are you?”</p>
<p>“Hardly.” Father says with a sneer, moving his hand to grasp Draco’s shoulder in a propriety manner. “Though if I was, I would certainly consider asking for your advice. I can’t even begin to imagine how you manage to remember where you’ve left them all.”</p>
<p>The whole Weasley clan has gathered around now, <em>of course</em>, and more than anything in the world he wishes he could apparate away right now. He’d even take Lockhart winking at everyone over this deeply unnecessary showdown between two grown men who should know better, really.</p>
<p>He still can’t quite bring himself to meet Harry’s eyes, no matter how much the other boy is attempting to do just that; Hermione looks confused, and the Weasel has this inappropriately triumphant look on his face, so Draco resorts to shooting a pained look at the Weasley daughter, only to delightedly discover that she’s already directing a similar expression back at him. Perhaps he had won her over with his offering of food earlier. He’d previously thought that sort of thing only worked with Crabbe and Goyle but maybe free food was enough incentive to make people want to be his friend.</p>
<p>Clearly he’s going to need to test this theory further once he’s at Hogwarts.</p>
<p>“We have very different ideas of what disgraces the name of wizards, Malfoy.” Arthur Weasley says hotly in response to something Father says, and Draco thinks, yes, <em>obviously,</em> if you let yourself be seen outside with that hat and robe together, but maybe that’s not the sort of thing they’re talking about, because then Father is saying something about sinking (Draco wishes he could sink through the <em>floor</em>, how is he ever going to make friends at Hogwarts now?) and a moment later Draco’s throwing himself to the side with an undignified shriek as the ruddy man lunges for his father, books and a cauldron going flying in the chaos.</p>
<p>Draco winds up pressed up against a bookshelf next to Hermione, though he doesn’t actually notice at first, eyes screwed shut and chanting desperately to himself, “this isn’t happening, this isn’t happening.”</p>
<p>And then he feels Hermione’s hand on his shoulder in the same place Lucius had set his hand, yet so distinctly different from each other that her touch is distinguishable immediately. He opens his eyes to find her giving him a concerned, probing look. “Are you okay, Draco?” She asks, and there’s so much more than just those four simple words behind what she’s saying that he refuses to look too closely at.</p>
<p>“Hermione, what are you <em>doing</em>?” Weasel demands furiously. “Didn’t you hear anything his dad just said?”</p>
<p>“Of course I did, Ron.” Hermione says back just as viciously, and honestly, she has one up on Draco if that’s the case, Draco should probably start making a point of listening more carefully the next time his father decides to sabotage his entire social career by running his mouth to a poor person. “Draco isn’t his father, though.”</p>
<p>It would be the first time someone had thought as much really. Draco finds he doesn’t really mind the idea terribly.</p>
<p>Harry pushes between the two of them, and cold dread runs through Draco’s veins as he opens his mouth to add, “He snuck me past his dad in Knockturn Alley, Ron.” Which. Doesn’t exactly <em>sound</em> like condemnation? Strange. “And he was just as desperate to get away as I was. I think his dad was talking about poisons with the shopkeeper?”</p>
<p>Draco can’t quite manage to stop his wince in time. Honestly, talk about parent’s embarrassing you in public, Lucius Malfoy had clearly made an effort to turn it into an art.</p>
<p>There was nothing classy about discussing poisons before the watershed (he doesn’t actually know what this <em>means</em>, he heard it once during a family vacation in the country and took a fancy to it).</p>
<p>Still, he can hardly just stand here and let people that don’t understand <em>anything</em> talk about his father like they do. “Why don’t you try worrying about your own father instead, Weasley.” He sneers back with a touch less surety than he would have preferred, stepping back away from the shelf and the trio when he spots that giant of a man wading into the mess to separate the two men.</p>
<p>Lucius dusts himself off and throws something at Ginny and clearly, it’s time to leave. Just enough time to deliver a parting shot without having any time to overthink or regret trying to be his father’s son. “Someone could have been seriously hurt by his little tantrum.” <em>I</em> could have been hurt, Draco thinks. “You should be careful, tempers are nasty little things to learn from your parents and you seem well on your way. Though I suppose your family doesn’t have much else that you could inherit, does it?” He adds with a pointed sniff before turning to follow his father out of the store when he beckons.</p>
<p>“I hope you realize I expect the <em>best</em> racing broom available after that embarrassing little display, Father.” Draco declares only a few steps out of the store (he never got his books, they’re going to have to order them after all because obviously they can’t go back in now after they’ve made a suitably dramatic exit).</p>
<p>His father’s steps barely slow and he doesn’t bother to look at Draco when he answers. “What makes you think you’re getting anything after the trouble you put me through disappearing like that? Honestly Draco, I don’t understand why it’s so difficult for you to stay put for ten minutes.”</p>
<p>“... the skulls were staring at me again.” Draco says, rather than getting into the mess of explaining Harry’s involvement in his abscondment. It doesn’t really feel like it’s his to share, anyway. “<em>Brawl</em>ing in <em>public</em> though, Father. What would Mother think if she were to hear?”</p>
<p>Draco gets his broomstick in the end, obviously.</p>
