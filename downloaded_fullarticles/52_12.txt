    <p>Draco stared open mouth at the women that just walked in The Three broomsticks, he had heard his companions take a sharp intake of breath and knew they must look just as dumbfounded and stunned as he did. He looked round and realised they weren't the only ones stunned at her sudden appearance or by the way she looked, nobody had seen her in the 9 years since the war, the whole pub was staring. He had finally managed to close his mouth and hoped arranged his feature appropriately, before he glanced back at her only to find her looking directly at him and walking with purpose directly towards his table. He tried to keep his features neutral but could feel his heart start to accelerate and a slow blush starting to creep onto his cheeks as she came nearer. Somethings never change.</p>
<p>She had a short pixie haircut that suited her slender frame, so much more than what she had at school, a slight touch of make up that was natural and her skin was now had a golden hue. She was wearing a very stylish navy blue french business dress with no sleeves and her robes hung over her arm, a large simple deep red belt accented the plain colour, a large brooch on the front Draco could tell was made of very exquisite jewels growing up in one of the wealthiest family's in the Wizarding World he noticed these things and was extremely impressed. The dress was slightly longer than the British fashion at the moment ending halfway down the calf but unlike boring prude British fashion the french stylists knew how to make there women look sexy the side split in the dress had showed off just a tad more thigh than was the British standards and a pair of devil may care red high heels just the final touch, even he had to admit she was more than just stunning. She had always been pretty but this, this was something else.</p>
<p>“Adrian, Theodore” she said with confidence and a slight bow of the head and apparently they were still in shock so before they could address her she turned “Draco I need to see you and your father, I know he’s on house arrest still so I will come to the manor, Do any of you have plans tonight? Draco still trying to control the rapid heart beat let out a shaky breath he hadn't realised he had been holding “N..No...Not that i’m aware no..b...but.. w….why..” when did he stutter, this was new. She seemed obviously caught of guard for a moment at his nervousness but recovered quickly “These two will need to be with you” she indicated Adrian and Theo. They both nodded to indicate they were free, still openly shocked to say much else “and no big dinners tonight just light snacks, Oh and Adrian bring your wife too, I will see you all there” and without another word or waiting for any of them to protest she turned on her heel and walked out the pub.</p>
<p>Theo recovered first “the hell was that about?” glancing across at him<br/>
“i don't bloody know do i” Draco huffed and crossed his arms like a child being told off.<br/>
“you going to be there?” Theo looked at Draco, he knew whatever Draco did both he and Adi would back him up.<br/>
“Don't have much choice do I, she will be there whether I want her to or not, guess i will have to go inform the parental’s” he shrugged.<br/>
They gathered up their things and headed out the door leaving the suddenly loud gossiping pub behind.<br/>
“and why the hell does she need a healer?” Adrian asked stopping suddenly confused<br/>
“Healer!!… What? Draco turned to Adrian<br/>
“why else would she need my wife, they never exactly got on at school so I cant see why else she needs her.” he sighed “I best go tell the lovely lady that she has to play nice with a little lion” he nodded to the others and headed off.</p>
<p>“LITTLE lion!!! ha” Theo snorted remembering how she was at school, a swotty little emotional know it all with over sized jumpers and big bushy hair, just like a little lion cub. Draco knew exactly what Theo meant, thinking of the way she had prowled over to their table, all confidant and ... merlins pants! looking the way she did. Draco raised an eyebrow and smirked “more lioness on a hunt?” a bit of awe in his voice despite himself. The war had changed everyone it had stripped everyone emotional down to the pits of hell and spat them out again some had crumbled but were clinging on to life, a few had broken completely. But others had learnt from it, a very hard, brutal lesson but a lesson non the less. Wizarding Britain and in parts the wizarding world had become so much better. Theo nudged Draco out of his thoughts. “come on we better get this over with, out of the frying pan into the cauldron, is that what they say?” he chuckled “Fire, it's out of the frying pan into the fire, you twat” Draco chuckled “but in this case a lot more damage can be done with the cauldron” Draco added a dramatic shiver they both laughed then headed off up the street to grab a few things before heading to Malfoy Manor to tell Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy that in 2 hours the famed, accomplished Golden girl Hermione Granger would be standing at their gate insisting on seeing them and he had no idea what for. This was going to be an interesting night.</p>
