<p>Camila, that is my name now. The brunette girl reminded herself, as she pushed open the door to Madam Malkin's Robes for All Occasions. The overwhelming scent of lavender and burning candles instantly made her eyes water.</p>
<p>"Hogwarts?" a raspy voice called out from the back of the shop. Camila looked around the corner, where the voice had called out from and spotted a woman. She was an older witch and if Camila had to guess she'd say the witch was probably a couple centuries old. Her long, dark robes flowed behind her, secured under the neck with silver button loops. Her long gray hair was pinned up in an elegant bun and she was smiling sweetly at the younger witch.</p>
<p>That must be Madam Malkin herself; Camila thought. She nodded her head shyly in confirmation and without another word the older witch placed a gentle hand between Camila's shoulder blades, guiding the brunette into a larger room in the back of the shop.</p>
<p>The room was already occupied by another boy, who was getting his own black robes pinned up. Camila kept her head down, afraid that he could see right through her. She knew it was a ridiculous thought, no one would place her face to her family name, at least not yet.</p>
<p>Madam Malkin was quickly gathering all the materials she needed before pulling Camila along and motioned for her to stand on a slightly elevated stand. She handed her one of the dark robes and Camila swiftly put it on.</p>
<p>"Whats your name, girl?" the woman asked sweetly, lifting up Camila's arms, while a measure tape began floating up in the air, extending itself along the younger girls arms.</p>
<p>Camila's eyes instantly went wide at the threated question. She took in a deep breath, hoping that the woman would not catch on. "Camila."</p>
<p>"Thats a really pretty name." The woman said, nodding her head in appreciation.</p>
<p>Camila suppressed a sigh of relieve and watched as the pen and paper floating next to them wrote down all the measurements that the older witch was calling out.</p>
<p>When the woman had taken all the measurements she needed, she helped Camila out of the robe again.</p>
<p>"Perfect, thats all." Madam Malkins said, making her way to the front of the shop with the younger witch following closely behind. Camila stood awkwardly in front of the counter, waiting as the woman scribbled something down on a piece of parchment.</p>
<p>"Peerfect." The woman drawled with a smile, looking over the measurements once more. "I just need the rest of your credentials."</p>
<p>Camila couldn't suppress the urge to fiddle with the hem of her shirt, feeling extremely uncomfortable at the question.</p>
<p>"I need your full name, please." The older witch said, peering over the top of her glasses at Camila.</p>
<p>Camila visibly gulped, taking in a deep breath. "Camila."</p>
<p>"Yes my dear, I already know that. I need your full name please." The woman chuckled, staring at the younger girl expectantly.</p>
<p>Camila awkwardly cleared her throat, looking anywhere but at the woman. "Camila... uhm Cabello?"</p>
<p>The woman behind the counter squinted her eyes at her, impatiently shaking her head. "What was that? Speak up girl."</p>
<p>Camila closed her eyes tightly, she knew what would happen next. She lifted her head back up and stared into the woman dark, brown orbs.</p>
<p>"My name is Camila... Camila Cabello."</p>
<p>Just as expected the womans face turned white in horror as she subconsciously took a step away from the girl, visibly gulping. Camila watched out of the corner of her eyes how the womans right hand was reaching out for her wand that was secured on the side of her robe.</p>
<p>"C-Cabello?" She stammered out, like the name alone would resurrect Lord Voldemort himself. "As in Karla. Camila. Cabello?" She proceeded to ask dumbly, her fingers curling around the end of her wand, causing Camila to suppress an eye roll. The girl only nodded her head in confirmation.</p>
<p>"Merlin's beard! Alberta what are you doing?" Another voice suddenly called out, causing both their heads to whip to the side. A slightly younger woman hurried over, pushing down Madam Malkins right hand that was tightly wrapped around her wand.</p>
<p>"What are you doing?"</p>
<p>"This is Karla Cabello!" Madam Malkins almost screamed, pointing with her free hand at the brunette girl. The other womans face also turned white in horror, mirroring Madam Malkins. She let out a shaky breath as her eye followed the older womans outstretched finger, landing on the young girl opposite the counter.</p>
<p>She swallowed hard, before turning her attention back on the other woman. "She is what? Twelve? God Alberta, just.. uhm... Calm down." She mumbled and Camila wasn't sure if she was asking or telling her.</p>
<p>"O-one s-second M-Ms Cabello!"</p>
<p>Camila watched as the woman whipped out her wand and hurried into the back. Madam Malkin was still starring at her wide eyed, watching her every move. It only took a moment for the other woman to hurry back. She was carrying a large package in her hands and quickly pushed it across the counter towards Camila. "Here, these are your robes... W-We don't want any trouble."</p>
<p>The younger witch had her eyes still trained on Madam Malkins before she handed the money over the counter. The womans eyes had turned almost pitch black in fright of Camila and Camila really couldn't blame her. When she was sure it was save enough to turn her back on them, Camila grabbed the package and quickly hurried out of the shop.</p>
<p>Every man, woman and child knew the Cabello's, they were a household name in the wizarding world after all, but not necessarily for the reasons you might be thinking. The Cabello's had been the right hand of Lord Voldemort himself. At the time when Voldemort and his death-eaters were in charge, they were his judge, jury and executioner.</p>
<p>The name Cabello still installed fear in most peoples' hearts and in all honesty, Camila really couldn't blame them. Her last name carried a legacy, a legacy of violence, torture and worse. Most people were more scared of her parents than they were of Lord Voldemort himself. Voldemort didn't bother waisting his time with them, the Cabello's on the other hand were the ones wanting Intel, hence the people who would come in contact with them never received the pleasure of a quick death.</p>
<p>But the narrow mindedness of some people like Madam Malkins always left her speechless. She had just turned 6 years old when the dark Lord had been defeated. What did they think? That she had fought along the death eaters and her parents against the Ministry and the Rebells?</p>
<p>Another thing that always bothered her was that Madam Malkins could have caused some real harm to her, while the worst Camila could have done would've been to bewitch her nose to never stop growing.</p>
<p>In reality she was a victim of the war like everyone else, but no one but her saw it that way. To those people she was worse than her parents and Voldemort combined. No one acknowledged or even cared that Camila had lost her father and that her mother was rotting away in a cell in Azkaban. No they threw parties on the day they destroyed her family and her life.</p>
<p>To her, the real crime happened when she was restricted from visiting her mother in Azkaban.</p>
<p>If something should be considered a crime, it was to restrict a daughter from seeing her mother. She had nothing to do with the actions her parents had allegedly taken and she was being punished for them nonetheless.</p>
<p>After her mother had been securely locked away in Azkaban and her fathers body had been burned, some of the pure-bloods that had been left standing and had gotten away with aligning themselves with the Dark Lord had helped her and her Abuelita out. If it was out of fear or out of loyalty Camila could never figure out, but after it came to light that her mother wasn't actually a pure-blood, but rather a filthy half-blood, one after another turned their backs on them as well.</p>
<p>::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::</p>
<p>Camila could barely believe that she had made friends on the train to Hogwarts. She wasn't naive enough to believe that they would stick around after they found out who she really was, but that didn't keep her from enjoying their company.</p>
<p>It had always been that way, but in that moment on the train she was one of them. A carefree teenager, wearing the same long, black robes, the plain Hogwarts tie and a white button-down shirt like her peers. They laughed and goofed around and for the first time Camila felt like she had real friends. She hoped more than anything that they wouldn't run the other way, that once they got to know her, they would be able to see past her family name, but inside she knew better than to believe those foolish feelings of hopes.</p>
<p>She was standing next to Normani as they waited for the large doors of the Great Hall to open and once they did, she closely stuck to the other girl, feeling overwhelmed by the large group of people who were about to find out who she really was.</p>
<p>She was shaking with nerves and she could almost feel the sweat prickle the back of her neck. Normani seemed to be able to feel Camila's nervousness and reached out for the younger girls hand, almost immediately easing some of the anxiousness the girl was feeling.</p>
<p>Walking up to the front felt like a death march for the brunette and with every step she took forward her legs began to feel more like lead. Camila was holding the raven haired girls hand so tight, that her knuckles had turned white, but thankfully Normani hadn't seemed to mind.</p>
<p>The woman named McGonagall was saying something but the words would not register in Camila's brain, she was to anxious, only when Normani freed her hand from Camila's tight grasp, was Camila slightly shaking out of her numb state. She looked over at the other girl only to realize that she had been called up to the front.</p>
<p>She watched as Normani sat down on the chair and McGonagall placed the sorting hat on the girls head. It only took 2 seconds for the hat to make its decision before it called out "Slytherin!"</p>
<p>The Slytherin table roared with approval as Normani happily jumped up from the chair, making her way towards them. Camila felt like crying, she wanted to be in Normani's house, but Slytherin was the one house she didn't want to be sorted in to. It was the house everyone expected her to end up in, the house her parents had been sorted in, but it would confirm everyones already made up opinion on the girl even more, that she was indeed a real Cabello after all.</p>
<p>Her thoughts didn't have much time to linger though, she watched as Ms McGonagall pushed her glasses back up her nose to read the next name.</p>
<p>"Karla... ." the woman began to read, but her eyes drifted over the rest of the name in silence. Camila watched as the womans eyes almost bulged out of her head and she knew that it was her name the woman threated to read out loud.</p>
<p>The woman composed herself again, clearing her throat as her eyes flickered over the small crowd of students that were still standing in front of her, like she was looking for something, or rather someone.</p>
<p>Camila tightly closed her eyes, she knew what it meant, but she desperately wished this all was just a nightmare after all. At first the words wouldn't leave McGonagall's mouth, it opened and closed in silence, but then her next words rang through the Great Hall like a gunshot, effectively silencing every conversation and causing every eye to snap to the front.</p>
<p>"Karla Camila Cabello."</p>
<p>Camila never wished more to be swallowed whole. Everything was dead silent and in seconds every head was frantically looking around, trying to get a good look at her, It wasn't the first time that Camila wished for the ability to make herself invisible.</p>
<p>Camila turned her head to the side and immediately regretted her decision. She could feel the betrayal Mari was feeling only by looking at her. She let her gaze roam over the rest of the students surrounding her, most of them had taken a step away from her in fright.</p>
<p>"Karla Camila Cabello!" The witch upfront yelled out again, and her voice sounded so small that Camila was left wondering what her parents could have done to her. For the first time she regretted the decision to not let her Abuelita send her to a wizarding school in Brazil.</p>
<p>Camila wouldn't give them the satisfaction of showing weakness, so she took in a deep breath and held her head up high. She could feel every pair of eyes prickle on her back as she made her way up the three step to the chair, almost tripping on her way up.</p>
<p>Once she sat down, she quickly let her hand run through her hair, fixing her gaze on a point over the students heads, afraid to see the fear and hate in their eyes. Professor McGonagall walked up to her with the sorting hat in her hand and to Camila's horror, before it was even sitting on her head it called out its decision.</p>
<p>"Slytherin!"</p>
