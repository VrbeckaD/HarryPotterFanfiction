          <div class="userstuff"><p>Draco moved around the medical room with ease. This wasn't the first time they had multiple traumatic injuries come in at the same time. And he worked with his fellow Healers to assess everyone's injuries and heal them in a timely manner.</p><p>Once everything started slowing down, the door to the medical room opened, and a man and a woman entered bringing a second man in between them who definitely looked worse for wear. Natasha and Steve were carrying Sam between them, and Draco directed them to lay the injured man on an empty bed. As his fellow Heelers started to look at Sam and get information from Natasha, he looked over and realised that Steve wasn't as uninjured as he was trying to make it seem.</p><p>“Is that blood?” Draco questioned.</p><p>“No?” Steve replied uncertainly.</p><p>Draco huffed and rolled his eyes. “That is not a question you're supposed to answer with another question,” he informed the other man. “Come over here and sit down, and I will take a look at you while the others work on Sam.”</p></div>
