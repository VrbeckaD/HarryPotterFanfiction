    <p>Hermione had never felt so cold or stiff in her life. Looking down at herself she stifled a scream as she saw her naked flesh covered in dirt and scratches. She had several deep scars along her body, but could not believe the word Mudblood was no longer carved into her arm. Her fingers tangled quickly in her mane as she tried to get a sense of what her hair was like. </p>
<p>“I keep telling you, to cut that mess off your head,” an unknown female voice told her as strange fingers disentangled her own. </p>
<p>Once free Hermione felt shock go through her as she had no immediate desire to cover up in front of the stranger. The stranger was an older woman with just enough meat on her frame, that you only saw her bones as she stretched. </p>
<p>“Last night's shift was enjoyable. I’m glad you joined us finally. I’ve only been begging for the last six months. We were able to take down several deer with your wolf’s brain helping guide us. Don’t usually see that skill set in an Omega, but you’ve been on your own for a while. I’m sure you had to adapt. Don’t we all with those bloody wizards thinking they have power over us? At least we have Greyback to protect us. I’m not always fond of his actions but he’s a good Alpha,” the female spoke as she brushed dirt out of her inch long blonde hair. </p>
<p>Hermione shivered in the low light of the sun, trying to comprehend everything she was told. Her brain fizzled as it tried to process that she was supposedly a werewolf. No less, currently, a werewolf in Fenrir Greyback’s pack. She faintly felt the woman sit her down on a cool rock as the feminine voice said she would take care of her hair. </p>
<p>An hour later Hermione wandered numbly through the encampment seeing about thirty people of varying ages, mostly children and elders. Some gave her smiles which she tentatively returned. While others leered, she kept her spine straight and went by without acknowledging them, just as the snarl of a voice in her head told her to. The snarl had made her believe that she had either cracked and had a split personality, or reality had cracked and she was in a different Hermione’s body. One that was from a different dimension and a werewolf. </p>
<p>Since there was no scar on her forearm, several people recognized her and she was told in detail about the hunt the night before, Hermione had concluded reality had cracked not her. She cursed her own universe for having so very little information on werewolves. She had no idea what an Omega was or how werewolves interacted with each other. Hermione decided the best thing to do was find food, steer clear of Greyback and observe as much as she could while isolating herself. </p>
<p>Her head felt so much lighter after Savy had cut off almost all her hair. The older woman said it was needed out here, so it could grow back healthy. Most of it had been dead much to Hermione’s dread. She’d never been without her curls before. Her hair was now only several inches long and hanging limply. </p>
<p>An elderly woman approached her slowly with a bundle in her hands. She was naked like the others, her skin still tight from hunger, though weathered by the elements. </p>
<p>“We tend to keep the Omegas who are here, or passing through clothed,” the woman husked as she handed over the bundle. </p>
<p>“Thank you,” Hermione told her as she unfurled the bundle revealing a deerskin dress. </p>
<p>Hermione didn’t wait to slip it on relieved to have a bit of warmth in the chilly autumn air. At least she assumed it was autumn since all of the trees around them where covered in red and yellow leaves, slowly making their way to the ground. It stopped shortly above her knees and was slightly loose on her frame. There were no sleeves but she would take what she could get. Nodding her head Hermione gave a soft smile before she moved on, heading for the smell of cooking meat. </p>
<p>She shouldn’t have been surprised at the number of homemade shelters but she was. Not a single wand had been spotted by her creamy chocolate eyes but she could feel the magic in the air. She figured they had to learn wandless magic, it wasn’t easy or cheap to come by a wand. She herself hadn’t had a wand near her when she awoke and had no idea where she would have stashed stuff before shifting. The line for the meat moved quickly and soon she had a makeshift plateful. Turning she found herself face to hairy chest, so to speak. </p>
<p>She was grateful it looked freshly washed unlike herself. Hermione couldn’t bring herself to meet the person’s face, instead, she stepped around them with a mumbled apology. The scent of the man filled her nose as she walked by. She bit into her lip to keep the moan from escaping her mouth. She forced herself to ignore the blood trickling down her chin, not wanting to stop.</p>
<p>Taking a spot near the edge of the encampment she turned her back, watching the forest as she ripped the meat from the bone out of instinct. Hermione tried to focus her thoughts, trying to remember if she had heard of any potions or spells that opened cracks between dimensions. However, her mind wouldn’t focus on anything but the scent she had taken in. Heat started to warm her skin as she ate, but she did her best to ignore it. Once her belly was full she looked around for the best items to make a shelter with. </p>
<p>Before she got too far Savy came over and shook her head. “Nah hun we have an extra tent already set up for you. Some of the elders set it up this morning. Come I’ll show it to you,” the woman told her, picking up Hermione’s plate and walking away with full confidence Hermione would follow her. </p>
<p>As they walked forward this time Hermione kept her eyes on the ground. She felt her skin crawling with each step she took. Reaching the tent, Hermione ducked down crawling through the flap of the deerskin entrance. The tent, like the one at the Quidditch world cup, was larger on the inside. Deerskins and other furs were layered on the floor as a bed with a few pillows. </p>
<p>She assumed the pillows had been transfigured. There wasn’t much else to the shelter. Hermione thought of transfiguring some more items for herself but wasn’t sure if she knew how to do it in this reality. She was hesitant to try not wanting to blow something up. She also wasn’t sure how her magic and wolf would get along. Obviously the others made it work, but they had years with their wolves, years with their magic. All Hermione had so far was a few hours. </p>
<p>Savy left quickly mentioning there was a river nearby Hermione could bathe in. She gave a grateful nod to the woman before curling up on the bed of furs. It was hardly noon but she felt a deep exhaustion take over that made her eyelids close against her will. </p>
<p>A scream bubbled in Hermione’s throat as she woke abruptly. Choking it down she hurried from her tent. Night had fallen and everyone was tucked away in their own shelters. Hermione rushed towards the wood, her skin felt on fire. Her enhanced senses picked up the sound of the river. Rigid fingers struggled to remove the dress, finally tossing it down as she reached the riverbank. </p>
<p>The water steamed off her skin as she waded into the river, trying not to slip on the rocks beneath her feet. She hissed with each step as they dug into her soles. Once she was out far enough Hermione ducked underwater. Holding her breath, she swam a foot or so more from the riverbank. Making sure she stayed away from the current, she stayed under until she couldn’t any longer. </p>
<p>As she came to the surface, Hermione sensed she was no longer alone. Her eyes darted around trying to pick out the person. She froze as her gaze landed on a lone figure approaching her from shore. He made his way slowly, determined, his scent reaching her before he did. A whimper escaped her as the heat returned hotter than before. Steam rose from her skin as she forced herself to stay where she was. </p>
<p>Even in the dark, she knew the figure of Fenrir Greyback. She had seen him wreak havoc at the final battle of the second wizarding war before he was defeated and imprisoned in Azkaban. This was not her realm though, he did not look as if he had ever served time in Azkaban. Instead, he was as formidable looking as when he caught them outside of the Lovegood’s home, though cleaner than he was then. He approached her slowly as if worried she would run. </p>
<p>“You’ll freeze to death if you stay in here any longer pup. I have a fire in my tent, come with me,” his voice was a firm growl. </p>
<p>Hermione’s mind told her mouth to protest, she was on fire already she didn’t need to go with him. The second voice growled at her to go with him, said it would help her. Her body listened to the second voice, propelling her towards the shore. A yelp left her mouth as she was lifted from the river’s edge and thrown over his firm shoulder. In his free hand, he clutched her deerskin dress. </p>
<p>Once they reached the tent he shoved her inside with a surprisingly gentle hand. His bed of furs was even thicker and softer than hers. There was a fire pit dug into the ground and reinforced to keep the furs and tent from setting fire. Curling up in a ball Hermione tried to ignore the heat as it spread through her veins, causing her to twitch and whimper. Greyback looked down upon her naked form with no sympathy, his pupils blown with lust.</p>
<p>“I can help, little Omega,” he told her simply as he started the fire. “I hadn’t expected you to go into heat so quickly, you’ve only been here a day. These things happen though. It probably started when you caught my scent, that can happen when an Omega is close to an Alpha. I was going to keep my distance, but couldn’t help myself,” he chuckled as he laid beside her on the furs. </p>
<p>His touch cooled her skin but still, she flinched away from him. She was so lost never reading before about heats, or Omegas, or Alphas. All she knew was this man was bad and her body was on fire. Rolling to her back she unfurled trying to stretch the fire from her body. As she exposed herself more, a growl reached her ears. </p>
<p>His hand slid slowly up her thigh, his thick fingers quickly rubbing along her slit. His tongue darted out, licking her slick from his hand. Greyback chuckled as her eyes closed, whimpers leaving her mouth. His fingers went back to work pushing slowly into her as his thumb pressed into her bundle of nerves. </p>
<p>“Tight little Omega,” he groaned, shoving a third finger inside her roughly. His fangs appeared as he grinned down at her. “Say yes and I’ll make your pain go away.”</p>
<p>Hermione shook her head whimpering as she felt herself nearing release. Never before had she heard herself snarl, but one left her throat as his hand left her sopping cunt, keeping her from release. He chuckled taking his cock in hand stroking her slick along his shaft. Her back arched off the furs as the fire consumed her. </p>
<p>“Yes,” she choked out as tears streamed down her face. She tried to tell herself it was all just a dream, it wouldn’t matter when she figured out how to get home. </p>
<p>“What was that, my Omega?” he asked, dragging his cock through her slick.</p>
<p>“Please, yes...please make...it stop,” she sobbed, snarling as she tried to push herself onto him, only to be pinned in place.</p>
<p>Fenrir chuckled darkly as he slammed into her in one stroke. He angled his pelvis to rub along her clit as he pounded into her rougher than any female he had fucked before. This Omega was a rare treat, so used to beta’s who caught his eye during a rut. Omega’s had arrived in his pack before but all knew better than to stay. To take clothes, food, and shelter from a pack was to indebt yourself to the Alpha. This Omega was like a lost lamb, not knowing the customs, not knowing her own heat cycle. </p>
<p>He easily took advantage, his people helping any way they could because of the protection he provided. He knew she would never be able to leave after tonight. No one would help her, her wolf would force her to stay as well. Greyback flipped Hermione, positioning her like a doll, testing her. A smirk crossed his lips as she held her position on all fours instead of fleeing the ritual claiming he was about to put her through. </p>
<p>Positioning himself over her, he thrust in once more, feeling her cling to his thick length. As the Alpha, he was bigger, and more powerful than any of the men in his pack. He used that strength wisely protecting them, keeping them sheltered, and fed, as well as one could be fed living in nature. Werewolves cared little for modesty. All his wolves banned together easily under his leadership. Now he would have his first queen by his side, to give him strong pups. </p>
<p>He caged her in as his thrusts became erratic, his knot swelling slightly before he gripped her hips tight. Ramming forward he heard her cry out as her cunt released a gush of her slick over his cock, causing his knot to swell further. Firmly in place he moved twice more before his seed sprayed her womb. At the same time, his teeth sunk deep into the juncture of her neck and shoulder.</p>
<p>Hermione desperately tried to pull away at the immense pain racing through her. Ear piercing screams left her as she found herself locked in place. A sob slid from her raw throat as his teeth left her skin. His tongue lightly lapped over the rapidly healing wound as he moved her to curl up on the furs. A chuckle reached her ears as she started passing out from the shock. </p>
<p>“I’m glad I turned you when you were six. I could smell you were different, but an Omega. How lucky am I? You will enjoy it here my Queen, not that you have much choice,” he growled petting her belly softly as she lost consciousness.</p>
