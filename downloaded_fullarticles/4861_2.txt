<p> </p>
<p>He'd been beside himself, as he'd boarded the ship. Admonishing himself, thoughts like<em> "I should have kissed her"</em> and <em>"Why didn't I just kiss her?"</em> thrumming against his skull with every leaden step.</p>
<p>He'd paused. But whilst Newt was a brave man - his recent actions had more than proved that - he was not a charming man. Unless being charmingly awkward (and stilted, and uncomfortable, he'd thought) was a thing, and Newt was sure that it was not. So, however regretfully, he'd marched ahead without so much as a backward glance at Tina. Bravery that came so fearlessly when fighting notorious dark wizards had dissipated when it came to kissing a girl, let alone an impassioned gesture in which he'd stayed, even just a little while longer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And she'd waited, heart in her mouth as he'd stopped, mid-stride, gangly legs scrunching and releasing. And how it had fallen through her chest and far into her stomach when he'd continued. Tina admonished herself, too: <em>"You can't fall for him, you're the career girl you're not Queenie-"</em> before she too had scrunched and released, her eyelids shutting out the light momentarily.</p>
<p>She took a deep breath, pulled herself up to her full height. And dove headfirst into the midday thrum of Manhattan.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Returning home had been painful.</p>
<p>Newt had sat on his case, knees cradled in his arms, brought too tightly into his chest.</p>
<p>Tina had sat at her desk, worn brown loafers scuffing idly against the floorboards as she'd tried to fill her mind with work.</p>
<p> </p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The next morning, Newt had woken early. A habit he'd picked up when travelling - he'd been partial to watching the sunrise before feeding his myriad creatures. He'd left the solitude of the cabin for the comfort of his case, and was greeted by familiarity.</p>
<p>As soon as he'd settled, watching the moon calves dip around one another to eat, Pickett strode out from under his collar and crossed his tiny, leaf-like arms, fixing Newt with a hardy stare.</p>
<p>"Ah, well, come on now Pickett."</p>
<p>The bowtruckle continued to glare, unblinking.</p>
<p>"All right, maybe I am moping. It's none of your business, anyway, you know."</p>
<p>Pickett raised an eyebrow, and tapped his foot on Newt's forearm.</p>
<p>"Pickett, Pick, my moping does not concern you."</p>
<p>Turning on his heel, Pickett made a very small "Hmph!" sound, before retreating to the warmth of Newt's woollen collar.</p>
<p>Exasperated, Newt ran a hand through his unruly mop of hair, and tugged anxiously at his clumsily-knit scarf. His feet, usually pointed outwards, turned in at the toes. Pulling in his splayed legs, he stood.</p>
<p>Pickett was right (not that he'd admit that) - he was moping, and he had creatures to tend to.</p>
<p>The blow of a foghorn drew him from his reverie. Thoughts of Tina forgotten for the time being, Newt straightened his bow-tie, fixed his coat so that it hung straight, and busied himself with his beasts.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The blow of a foghorn woke Tina at an ungodly hour. Brushing her short hair from a sleep-sweaty face, she reached instinctively for her wand, and pulled her nightgown tighter about her person.</p>
<p>A whispered "Lumos" brought her face to face with Queenie.</p>
<p>"Queenie! What are you doing? You terrified me!"</p>
<p>"Sorry, sweetie. You don't look well, doll."</p>
<p>"And the best way to check was to scare me to death?" Tina rounded on Queenie, shock becoming anger, anger becoming confusion.</p>
<p>"I didn't think, I'm sorry."</p>
<p>"Still not okay, Queenie!"</p>
<p>"Your dreams, they was all over the place. I didn't want you to have to suffer no more."</p>
<p>"Oh." Tina paused.</p>
<p>"Weird stuff, honey. Real weird." Queenie trailed off, confusion marring her face.</p>
<p>"I'm sure it's nothing." Tina forcibly relaxed herself, and brought down her wand.</p>
<p>Turning down Queenie's heartfelt offer of tea, then hot cocoa, she'd made her way back to her bed and tried to settle in.</p>
<p> </p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Newt's arrival in London was understated. He'd gently, reverently, put the case down at the door, before opening all of the windows in his small flat. The smell of the bakery underneath (local owner, squib with an unnatural talent for confectionery) wafted in, ushering out the musty scent of disuse.</p>
<p>Used to being alone, Newt set about documenting his trip: taking his papers from the journey and recounting the adventure. Upon noting that Frank had not been released in Arizona, as had been his intention, a wave of remorse overwhelmed him. But they had, together, succeeded in something marvellous, so he could not feel too upset by the prospect.</p>
<p>Newt pinched the bridge of his nose, and scratched behind his ear. He'd found friendship for the first time since Leta - <em>do not think about that</em> - and he wished he could settle back into solitude. Every wave of chatter passing through the window, carried on the wind from below, made him long for Jacob's broad smile and cheerful laugh; for Queenie's high-pitched giggle and wide eyes; and, perhaps worst of all, for Tina's ... Well, Tina's everything.</p>
<p>Sighing, he drew a new piece of parchment, and placed it atop the small pile of his recently accumulated work. Dipping his occamy-feathered quill into a messy pot of ink, he began to write:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>Dear Tina,</em> he started, before crossing out 'Dear' and replacing it with 'Hello'.</p>
<p>
  <em>Hello Tina,</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> I hope this letter finds you well.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> I myself have not been home long, but find myself fatigued of London and its cramped streets already. New York was considerably more exciting than I have found home to be for a long time. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>My editor is, however, becoming anxious for the next complete chapter of my book. It is to be entitled 'Magical Beasts in Hiding', as I plan to discuss Frank and his newfound freedom, as well as the numerous habitats hidden in my suitcase. Then I may delve into the potential of using swooping evil venom as a form of memory charm, though I fear I may digress into an enthusiastic tangent. But I suppose that is why I have an editor.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> I must apologise if the sending of this letter seems forward. It seems that I may, perhaps, miss you, just a little bit. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>How is Jacob? Has he shown any signs of recognition - indeed, have you attempted to reach him? </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Newt paused, quill held halfway to his mouth as he thought. He'd seen muggles use pens, and he thought he rather liked the idea of those. He couldn't really hold a quill in his mouth.</p>
<p>He'd had an idea. It was bold, for him - but it would take time, and could be revoked if he changed his mind, or if she did not seem eager at the prospect. He smiled, and it was a slow, wavering thing - hope unfurled like a flower inside of him.</p>
<p>He continued:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>By the time this reaches you, it will have been more than the mere few days than it is at the time of writing. I live above a squib (charming fellow, actually) and he has oft offered me the use of his owl. Big creature, large wingspan, but dopey - incredibly dopey - so I'm wholly expecting him to take a wrong turn across the Atlantic somewhere. Probably a somewhat longer trip than he's used to, but I wouldn't send him if I didn't have faith in him. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>I apologise - I'm raMbling. How's work? Have you been reinstated as an auror? I do hope that you have.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> Is Queenie okay? Is she missing Jacob?</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He re-read what he could of the letter, but his loping scrawl made it illegible in parts. His 'M's and 'W's often appeared to be the same, as went for 'S's, 'J's, and 'I's. Shaking his head, he decided it was probably fine.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em> Yours, </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Newt.</em>
</p>
