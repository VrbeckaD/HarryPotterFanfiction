    <p>The summer had been long, and stressful. It was so hot and everyone seemed to be even more irritable than normal. All Draco seemed interested in was Quidditch and would spend hours flying around the Manor or holed up in his room. Mother seemed to be under a great deal of stress and it was related to the constant meetings father had in his office. There was a regular flow of dark witches and wizards in our home this summer. It was something that left me unnerved. Unlike Draco, I was frightened by many of them and I wasn't too preoccupied to notice that something was going on.</p><p>This is the summer I should receive my Hogwarts letter. I have dreamt of going to Hogwarts for years! Away from this dreary house and away from my father. He doesn't hide his feelings toward me well, and mother has come to my defense less and less as the years pass. I love my father, I truly wished he loved me too. He cares for Draco, I can see it in the way he lavishes him with gifts and takes him places. He speaks to Draco about things of interest and they often enjoy each others company. Don't get me wrong, Father can be rather strict with my brother too, but I have never seen him look at Draco the way he does me. There is a coldness in his voice when he addresses me and it has served me as a warning. I constantly have to remind myself to steer clear of his anger because the results can be terrifying.</p><p>I suspect today will be much like the last few months. I spend the majority of my days reading in my room or tending to Mother's abandon gardens. She used to love to garden, some of my fondest memories are playing in the gardens while she tended to her plants. Life at Malfoy Manor was not always a loveless as it is now. Mother used to be full of life. She had a passion for Herbology and Potions. She loved to listen to music and smiled all the time. The years have not been kind though, as darkness and fear seemed to permeate our lives now. Mother is just a shell of the women I knew. You can see the worry in her eyes and she has retreated within herself, to the point where it seems like she's hardly there at all.</p><p>As I am standing inside my enourmous closet trying to find something to wear for the day I hear a slight pop behind me. I know that Dobby has come to check on me. My sweet little house elf, whom I love dearly. He is diligent in reminding me to be on time for meals. Father does not tolerate tardiness of any kind and does not hesitate to punish the offender.</p><p>"Miss must get dressed quickly! Miss must not keep Master waiting!" Dobby said, full of concern pacing my closet.</p><p>"I am nearly finished Dobby, don't worry." I smiled at him. I can see in his face both worry and love. I think he is the only one in this house that makes me feel loved and I am grateful for him.</p><p>I quickly throw on a light grey button down dress and shoes. As I brush my long blond hair away from my face, I can't help but be amazed at how much I look like my Father and brother. How can we look so similar and yet be so different?</p><p>When I arrive in the dinning room I am greeted by Mother. "Good Morning Delia." she says. She looks so tired. It pains me to see her like this, but I never know quite what to say to her these days. Whenever I express any feelings of concern, it seems to cause her even more alarm. She looks so fragile to me this morning. I don't even think Father realizes how vulnerable she has become.</p><p>"Good Morning Mother." is all I can reply. I desperately want to wrap my arms around her and ask her what's wrong, but I don't dare. Not only would it cause her more pain, but Father would be furious over such a display of emotion at the dinning room table.</p><p>So, like every morning I sit at the table in silence, waiting for Father to appear. The house elves know not to serve a drop of anything till Father is seated. We sit in silence in the grand room with it's cold elegance. Dark walls draped with tapestries and paintings depicting the Pureblood nobility of The Malfoy and Black families. Dark wood tables and chairs that look severe rather than welcoming. Gold and silver heirlooms from generations past and enchanted silk upholsteries that twinkle as if they were hiding something.</p><p>Draco comes scrambling in, quickly taking his seat. I can tell by creases on his face that he overslept and must have thrown his clothing on and raced down. "Good Morning." He says to us both and I can see the relief in his face that our Father has not beaten him to the table.</p><p>Before we have a chance to even reply Father appears. "Good Morning." He says to us and we all return his formal greeting.  I can see Father eying Draco suspiciously.</p><p>The house elves quickly appear with coffee, tea and our breakfast. I love breakfast! Our house elf Tansy makes the most delicious food. As Dobby brings me my plate I see that my favorite orange scones, cream and raspberry jam await me. Once everyone has been served the house elves disappear. "Narcissa, I have business at the Ministry today and I won't be home till this evening." Father says to Mother.</p><p>I look up to see her response and I say a silent prayer that my own excitement is not visible on my face. Having Father away from the house for the entire day means freedom. I don't dare let him see how this excites me.</p><p>"What are you plans for today? I do hope you are keeping the children up to date on their lessons." It is Mother's duty to ensure we are educated in the ways of Purebloods. She teaches about the history and traditions of Purebloods and decorum. I hate the Pureblood mentality and I don't think my Mother embraces the same beliefs as my Father, but we all go through the motions anyways.</p><p>"I had intended to show Delia how to prepare the east ballroom for fall." Mother replied. Learning to run a household was supposed to be high on the list of things I needed to learn as the daughter of Lucius Malfoy. I had no interest, but had learned obedience was also expected of me, and that my opinion didn't matter much.</p><p>Before they could say more there was a soft tapping at the dining room window. One of the house elves appeared to let the large grey owl in. Nigel, our owl dropped a handful of letters in front of Father and then dropped one in front of Draco. I could see it was his Hogwarts letter from where I sat across from him. My heart sank a little as Nigel flew past me to Mother with a stack of letters for her. I was struggling to keep my emotions in check when he suddenly flew past me and dropped a single letter on my plate. In emerald green writing it was clearly addressed to me and it was from Hogwarts!</p><p>I was afraid to even look at Father, he still has not given his permission for me to attend. He had spoken to Mother last year when Draco started at Hogwarts about how he felt they were lacking in the things a Pureblood Witch needed in an education. He even encouraged Mother to consider to continue to homeschool. He told her that she was the best example of everything I ever needed to learn about being a witch and why send me to commiserate with Mudbloods and Blood traders. I couldn't stand the thought of never being allowed to go to school, the thought of living another 7 years like a prisoner in Malfoy Manor was just more than I could bare.</p><p>Without looking up I slowly began to open my letter. When I unfolded it, it clearly said "Congratulations Miss Malfoy, you have been accepted into Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry......." along with the acceptance letter was a list of school supplies. When I finally gained the courage to look up I realized that not one member of my family was even remotely interested in me or my letter. Mother was reading what appeared to be a letter from Aunt Bella, who was in Alzkaban Prison. It pained mother greatly to be separated from her sister and to make it worse, the knowledge of her being in Azkaban was more than she could take. Father was reading the Daily Prophet and Draco was busily eating his breakfast.</p><p>I didn't know what to do! I wanted to know if I was going to be allowed to go, but I knew better than to ask a question like this at the breakfast table. It wasn't long till Father had finished his meal and excused himself from the table. He was in a hurry to get to the Ministry. Draco followed suit, anxious to return to his room. It was just Mother and I and I decided to ask her.</p><p>"Mother, will Father allow me to attend Hogwarts this year? My letter arrived today, l've been accepted." I asked.</p><p>She didn't reply right away and it made me feel even more doubt. "Delia, I hope your Father says you will be able to go. You will have to ask him yourself though. The last time we discussed it, he still seemed to feel you would be better served with a home education." Her words filled me with dread. Having a discussion with my Father was one of the very last things I wanted to do, but it was obviously unavoidable. </p><p>"Could you please talk to him?" I pleaded, trying not to cry.</p><p>"I don't know, you should speak to him sooner than later and he won't be home till late this evening. I am not sure he will be in the right frame of mind tonight for me to bring this up. You need to request a time to speak with him directly in his office." And then she stood up and left the table, making it clear that this discussion was finished.</p>
