    <p>-Lily Evans-<br/>
It had gotten out of hand this time.<br/>
“Just a little longer,” he whispered.<br/>
“Sev, the sun’s coming up,” she complained.<br/>
“Then-they-have-to-come-out.”<br/>
Lily let her tired head fall into her hands. The blanket they were sharing slipped offer her shoulders. She felt Severus pulling it back up again.<br/>
“Thanks,” she said turning to him.<br/>
He smiled weakly and flashed his eyes back at the tree. The Whomping Willow. The exact same Whomping Willow, with the exact same number of branches and leaves, in the exact same place as they had been when they sat down on the hill the night before. In all that time, Severus had not looked away from more than a few seconds.<br/>
“Potter and Black are here somewhere,” he promised.<br/>
“And Peter and Remus,” she pointed out.<br/>
He barely blinked when muttering, “Yeah. Them too.”<br/>
Lily glanced around at the grounds and tried not to yawn. The sky was paling, and the lake was starting to dance with little glimmers of sunlight. It was going to be summer very soon. Her stomach twisted thinking of Petunia and Mr. Snape. She let her head rest on her friend’s shoulder.<br/>
“Why are you so obsessed with Potter anyway? Are you in love with him?” she teased.<br/>
Sev hopped back so fast, the blanket fell off them both.<br/>
“WHATWOULDMAKEYOUSAYTHAT?!”<br/>
“Sev! Shuuuuuuuuushhhhhh!”<br/>
“Sorrry,” he whispered and scooted back up to her again.<br/>
This time, she put the blanket on them.<br/>
“I don’t love him, ‘s everybody else that does,” he grumbled and drew his knees in closer, pulling the blanket to his side.<br/>
“I don’t love him,” she reminded him and pushed him a little with her shoulder. He didn’t seem to notice. He was staring at the tree again. It seemed like a long time since she’d seen him smile honestly or heard him laugh. They used to laugh all the time, about silly muggles and silly wizards. He was one of the few people she knew who understood what it was like to see both sides. Maybe this summer, away from Houses and Quidditch heroes, distractions, they could laugh again.<br/>
“Potter goes around with his weird friends and their pranks, and his hair, and his weird friends –Have I told you my theory!” he interrupted himself.<br/>
“I know your theory about Remus,” she sighed, suddenly counting the days until they could get back on the train.<br/>
He sucked in a deep breath, preparing to tell her the whole thing again anyway.<br/>
“You two waiting for something?” asked the ringing laugh that belonged to the one, the only, James Potter.<br/>
Severus fell over trying to turn around too fast.<br/>
Lily looked around. There was no sign of his friends, a door, or even a rock they could have been hiding behind.<br/>
“Well,” James smirked. “Don’t let me ruin your date.”<br/>
Lily frowned.<br/>
“It’s not a date,” she answered, flatly. Dates were fun. She looked down at her muddy shoes and damp socks. This was not.<br/>
“’snot a – not a date,” Sev mumbled back, rolling up the blanket.<br/>
“Where did you come from then?” she asked.<br/>
James shrugged and motioned back at the castle.<br/>
“We all have our secrets, Evans. Now, shall we scurry on inside before Filch finds out about this one?” He didn’t wait for a response to start up the hill.<br/>
Lily leaned into Severus’ ear.<br/>
“You were right,” she whispered without taking her eyes off Potter’s narrow back. “He’s got something up his sleeve.” </p><p>-James Potter-<br/>
“It’s gone too far this time!” Sirius complained, turning around on the dormitory steps to shoot James a glare. It looked rather dark in the shadowed space. It was a good thing he had led Evans and Snape in first and gone back for the others. There was no way they could have kept quiet enough to follow them under the cloak.<br/>
“He has a point,” Remus sighed, leaning against one of the walls for breath. The stairs were too much for him.<br/>
James ducked under one of his friend’s arms and shouldered some of the burdens.<br/>
“Saving Snivels from Filch!” Sirius went on, ducking under Remus’ other arm. “What’s the matter with you?”<br/>
“Lily Evans,” squeaked Pete from behind.<br/>
“What was that?” James hissed, jerking his head around.<br/>
“He said,” Remus cleared his throat. “Lily. Evans.”<br/>
James laughed, “This again?”<br/>
Lily Evans was collateral. It was her greasy friend he worried about. The kid had eyes like a hawk and the mind of a snake. If he hadn’t interrupted their little date –well, one of these days Little Snivels was going to get the proof he was after.<br/>
James didn’t want it to be today.<br/>
“If she’s letting Snivels drag her out in the middle of the night, she deserves to get caught,” Sirius grumbled, waving his free hand in the air.<br/>
“She’s too smart for him,” Remus agreed.<br/>
James shook his head and followed them into their room. By the time they helped Remus to bed, tucked away the invisibility cloak, and sat down, they had all stopped talking about Lily Evans. Still, when he looked out the window at the brightening sky, he wondered if she would be in charms in a few hours. Evans, too tired to answer questions, he’d hate to miss it…<br/>
He yawned and laid down.<br/>
He’d almost hate to miss it.<br/>
“Lily should be with you, James,” Peter whispered in the dark.<br/>
“She’s Evans, he whispered back. “She’s smart enough to know what she wants.”</p>
