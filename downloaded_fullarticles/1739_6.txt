  <span>“You’re not from around here,” says Sodapop, his heart racing in the vein in his neck and </span>
  <em>
    <span>elsewhere. </span>
  </em>
  <span>He knew he was right. She was too pretty, too elegant to be a Greaser, but the fact that she wore holey jeans (</span>
  <em>
    <span>holy </span>
  </em>
  <span>jeans, he thought, hardly catching his breath) marked her distinctly as not being a Soc. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How clever,” she purred, in an accent foreign to his ears. Not quite a Brit, but maybe something like that. She stepped closer. “I need...the gas. For his car.” His eyes dropped to her slim hands, where a modest ring sparkled, the kind he wanted to buy Sandy, would’ve bought Sandy. Too modest for a Soc.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Name’s Soda,” he said, offering his dirtied hand. She didn’t flinch, and grasped it with an unexpected firmness.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fleur.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Welcome to Tulsa, Fleur.” Her name is light and beautiful. “Not got a car back home?” She bites her lip in that teasing way all girls do, maybe just to drive him mad.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“His father has one.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Your boyfriend’s dad?” Soda grabs the nozzle with one hand. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mm.”</span>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>“Where you headin’?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“New York.”</span>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>“Through </span>
  <em>
    <span>Tulsa? </span>
  </em>
  <span>Would’ve been cheaper to fly there.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t fly, </span>
  <em>
    <span>Soda</span>
  </em>
  <span>.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Fleur.</span>
  </em>
  <span>”</span>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>“Shush.”</span>
