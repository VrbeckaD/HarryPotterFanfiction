    <p>"Tell us a story, Father?" the little boy asked, staring up at his father with wide green eyes.</p>
<p>"Yes, please tell us a story, Uncle Edmund?" the little girl next to him asked, add in the force of her puppy dog eyes to her cousins.</p>
<p>"All right, all right," the Just king laughed, settling on the armchair in the massive nursery that the four royal children shared, "But just one, and then you go to bed."</p>
<p>"Yay!" the four cousins yelled, piling around his feet.</p>
<p>"What story shall I tell you?" the king asked his rapt audience.</p>
<p>"Tell us the story of how you defeated the white witch," his red headed niece requested.</p>
<p>"No!  Tell us the story of how Rabadash was turned into a donkey!" her eldest cousin replied.</p>
<p>"I know, I know!  Let's hear the story of Caspian the Seafarer!" the little blonde girl next to him said, receiving strange looks from her cousins.</p>
<p>"I have a better idea," the king told them, "Why don't I tell the story of how you four came to Narnia?"</p>
<p>"We've never heard that story before," his son said, eyes wide.</p>
<p>"Well then it will be extra special, won't it?" the king asked, "Now, our story begins two years ago, in the forest of Lantern Waste.  My brother, sisters, and I were hunting the white stag, for it is said that if you capture it, it will grant you a wish.  As we rode through the forest, we came upon a very strange thing.  A lantern, set on a pole, in the middle of the deep forest.  We wondered why it was there, who would put such a thing in the middle of the woods, where is was of no use to anyone.  Then, as we stood wondering, Queen Lucy heard a faint cry, like that of a child.  We hurried after her, and came upon a clearing, in which there laid four small children, wrapped in tattered blankets and sound asleep.  Around each of their wrists was a small piece of paper, torn and water damaged, that appeared to have their names inscribed on them, but damaged enough that they couldn't be read very well.  We didn't know what to do, but decided that you must've been placed in our path by the will of Aslan, and determined to raise those children as our own.  We brought them back to Cair Paravel, where those children have grown up and become you,."  He booped his nieces nose playfully, "Little bundles of trouble that you are."</p>
<p>She giggled.  "That's a good story, Uncle Edmund, and it's so much more interesting because it's true."</p>
<p>"That it is, my dear," He said, smiling, "Now, I still have work to do, and it's time for princes and princesses to be in bed.  The children scrabbled to climb into their beds, lined up just like their parent's thrones.  King Edmund walked up to the bed on the far right.  "Goodnight, Virginia," he whispered to Lucy Pevensie's red headed daughter, kissing her forehead.  He moved to the next bed, tucking the blankets up to her chin, "Goodnight, Lunette," he told the blonde daughter of Queen Susan.  Moving to the next child, he smiled at how his nephew was already nearly asleep, "Goodnight, Nathaniel," he said, smoothing the child's hair back.  Smiling, he moved to the last bed, where his own son sat up, watching him.  "Goodnight, Hadrian," Edmund whispered, pulling his son into a hug before tucking him in.  Edmund paused in the doorway to smile, then blew out the candle and left the children to their dreams.  Alone in the room, Ginny, Luna, Neville, and Harry slept peacefully, worlds away from the lands of their birth and the problems that awaited them there.</p>
