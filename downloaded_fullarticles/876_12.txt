          <div class="userstuff"><p>“Would you take a bullet for me?” </p><p>“No.” Victorie rolled her eyes as she continued to sweep her platinum hair into a bun. She tried to hide a smile as she watched James gesture fervently. </p><p>“What do you mean no?! We’ve been together for a year and a half! Don’t you love me?”</p><p> James’ eyes were caught in a patch of sunlight streaming in from the window. The smell of molten fudge drifting in from the kitchen.</p><p>“If I have time to jump in front of a bullet-” Victorie crossed her legs before poking James with a lacquered nail.  “You have time to move.”</p><p>***</p><p>“Is he always like that?” Ron pulled a face. </p><p>Harry broke into a grin before disappearing into the kitchen to take the brownies out of the oven.  “Regrettably. Yes.”</p><p>“What does she see in him?” Ron muttered to himself. </p><p>Harry looked over his shoulder, taking in the sight of his son, content; Victorie’s head cocked into his shoulder, before disappearing fully into the kitchen with Ron. He thought briefly about Hermione; the way she looked at Ron like he held the world in his eyes. </p><p>Reappearing with the steaming tray of fudge brownies Harry watched James as he ran his knuckles over Victorie’s cheek.</p><p> He coloured red, thinking of his wife and her brassy freckles. “I wasn’t that bad was I, Ron?”</p><p>“Nah mate. You were much worse.”</p></div>
