    <p>They had woken up on this damned island 20 days ago. One moment Hermione was at apparition lessons, and the next bright sun shining into her eyelids woke her up with Draco Malfoy few meters away from her, scowling at the horizon.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>***</p>
</center>Malfoy stopped being a git the second he understood their predicament - he asked and looking into her eyes got an answer that she didn't know anything about their current situation.<p>"Well, I was really hoping to get different answer," he said dejectedly.</p><p>"Of course you wanted someone to blame... Sorry for not being a convenient scapegoat."</p><p>"I didn't mean it like that. Very rarely, but accidents do happen to students who practice apparition. If you would've done something, we would've been closer to getting out of here..."</p><p>"What do you mean?"</p><p>"Haven't you heard in our second year a girl from Ravenclaw disappearing during the same lessons we had?"</p><p>"No?"</p><p>"Well... The staff doesn't like to flaunt it... But as far as I know she wasn't found to this day."</p><p>"Really??"</p><p>"Like I would make stuff up in this situation. Well... We might stumble on her skeleton or something," he said with a bitter smirk. "That's why some wizards never try it in the first place. But the case like of that Ravenclaw, or ours, is exceptionally rear, generally happens less than once in a few decades. We're lucky I guess..."</p><p>"And the other cases?"</p><p>"Splinching and stuff... Sometimes people are found all over England. And we are clearly elsewhere." He lay back and stretched his limbs. "At least at night we'll get better idea of where we are."</p><p>"At night?"</p><p>"You are the smarter one... Or were you sleeping at astronomy lessons?"</p><p>"Very funny, like knowing our hemisphere might help us in any way."</p><p>"I didn't say that it might. Our chances dwindle by the minute. I don't know how long we were unconscious, but as the time goes, it gets less and less likely that we're going to be located. If it's easy, they do it almost right away. I've been awake for an hour already."</p><p>"You should've woken me up," she mumbled.</p><p>"I tried, I even thought you were dead at first."</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>***</p>
</center>One morning in more than a month into their 'vacation' Hermione wondered along the beach not paying much attention to her surroundings when she stumbled upon completely naked Malfoy lying on his back with his eyes closed. The second her eyes involuntarily skidded over his groin she stopped and tried to inconspicuously back off, but he wasn't sleeping and heard her.<p>"Hey, Granger," he said. But she turned away and started running. "Hey!" he called louder after her.</p><p>"What?" Hermione stopped, staying with her back to him.</p><p>"Well, I just wanted to tell you that I decided not to wear clothes from now on."</p><p>"You what?!" she asked in indignant tone and turned back to him, saw a glimpse of him lying on his side now, propping his head on his hand. Before realising that he was still naked and turning away again. "I... Mmm... Why? If I may ask?"</p><p>"Why not? I constantly have to go into water... I don't like the feeling of wet trunks."</p><p>"But you naked!"</p><p>"I was going to do it eventually. And this is the time. Come on, turn to my face. I can't constantly talk to your back."</p><p>"I'll turn when you have something on! At least your trunks!"</p><p>"I burned them."</p><p>"You did what?!" she said with raised voice and turned to him fuming. "We barely have anything, and you destroy clothes!! We could've made use of them somehow! If not now then later!"</p><p>He gave her a big grin. "I knew that would make you turn to face me. I lied of course. I'm not daft." He fumbled with his hand at his back and got out a piece of cloth and waived it on his finger demonstratively.</p><p>She huffed, turned and walked away, ignoring his subsequent calls.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>***</p>
</center>It was their 81st day. Hermione meticulously kept adding scratches to the big black rock near their camp each morning.<p>They were sitting by the fire. Hermione in her bikini swim-suit, a magical pair of underwear that turned into a swim-suit with a press of a small pin - the only magical item on the whole island. Draco was naked. He refused to wear anything ever since the announcement and Hermione became used to it faster than she expected.</p><p>"Hermione," he said; he almost never called her by her surname anymore, saying that it sounded too muggle and 'Hermione' sounded way better for a witch.</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"You know, I sometimes go wandering by myself and stuff?"</p><p>"Sure... What about it?"</p><p>"Well, I don't think you're going to like, or maybe you will, who knows. Anyway, I go and masturbate."</p><p>Hermione choked on a sweet and sour root she was munching on. After a several coughs she replied, "Thanks for telling me that, Draco. But such things you may keep to yourself. I don't need to know that. Everyone needs their own personal time. So whatever..."</p><p>"Well, regarding that. I decided that from tomorrow I will stop sneaking to wank. It takes time, and frankly, I don't see any reason to hide it."</p><p>She squinted her eyes. "What are you trying to say here, Malfoy?"</p><p>"I'm going to wank in the open. Whenever and wherever I feel like - I will just do it."</p><p>"In front of me?" she said derisively, thinking that he didn't think it through.</p><p>"Pretty much..." he said without batting an eye.</p><p>"Ahm..."</p><p>"Well, I told you just so you wouldn't get surprised when you see it," he said and pulled his school cloak over himself. "Good night."</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>***</p>
</center>Draco kept masturbating two-three times a day, and that was only what she witnessed! Maybe he did it alone even more? Who knows... Hermione certainly wasn't going to ask him that.<p>Finally seeing him yet again reach for his junk she snapped, "How can you do this so often?"</p><p>"What do you mean how? How can I not?"</p><p>"Did you do it so much back in school?"</p><p>"Mmm... More like once a day..."</p><p>"So why do it so much here?"</p><p>"What else here to do? If I were capable, I would've wanked 10 times a day. You're always welcome to join."</p><p>Hermione scowled and turned away.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>***</p>
</center>As she noticed him yet again starting to jerk off as his eyes trained at her chest, she sighed. "Don't you think your parents would disapprove you masturbating at a mudblood?"<p>"As I've said to you at the third day here, I personally didn't care for mudbloods or tripe like that for years. Of course I had to put up the show back then... Who cares now?"</p><p>"Yeah, yeah... And I still don't believe you."</p><p>"I don't care whether you believe it. I only care to see your breasts at the moment." Hermione huffed and covered her chest with her hands. She stopped wearing her t-shirt and skirt long ago. "Oh, come on!" said Draco with indignation. "You are in a swim-suit already! I barely can see outline of your nipples, or at least I imagine seeing them, and you deprive me even of this!"</p><p>"It's my body, I will do what I want!"</p><p>"Sure you are... But please, pull your hands away. I don't have any journals and my imagination isn't too vivid." Finally she huffed and pulled her hands away from her chest. "Thanks," he said grinning. His hand began to move back and forth.</p><p>After a few minutes he said, "So, how about removing your top?"</p><p>"No."</p><p>"Maybe only one of the flaps?"</p><p>"No."</p><p>"Perhaps you'd agree to tug it away a little and show me half of your nip?"</p><p>"No! And stop asking already! The same fucking discussion every few days!"</p><p>"Yes, Hermione, curse some more. It only gets me going." Hermione scowled at him. "You know, I'll just have to keep asking in hope to get positive answer sometime..."</p><p>"Dream on... Never going to happen."</p><p>"I'm a dreamer..." he said smiling; his hand never stopping its slow movement throughout their dialog. "Anyway, don't you want to get off? We're here how long already? Three months?"</p><p>"I'm not discussing it with you! And we're here for 119 days."</p><p>"Who are you going to discuss it with?! We're here for good... No one's coming..." he said dejectedly; his hand stopping moving altogether. She looked into his eyes with anger for reminding her that there was no hope. Unsurprisingly this made his slowly drooping cock to harden again. He would bet that she wanted to get away at the moment, but it was already after sunset, and walking off, away from the fire wasn't a good idea and he knew that she knew it. "The offer still stands. I can get you off if you want... However you want - I'm in. Just say a word."</p><p>"I'm a mudblood, you'll get dirty..."</p><p>He rolled his eyes, "You are the only one of us two, who for the last 119 days called you a mudblood. I'm tired of you bringing it up over and over. If you won't stop, I promise - I won't aim away... Or even better - I'll specifically aim at you!"</p><p>"Aim?"</p><p>He stood up, so that the fire illuminated his cock. "This," he said resolutely. "I will cum on you!"</p><p>"You wouldn't dare!"</p><p>"Oh... I wanted to do it for a long time now... I mean, what do you think I imagine while jerking off on your semi-naked body?"</p><p>She looked open-mouthed at him for several seconds before replying, "Okay, I will try to remember it."</p><p>"Good," he said, sat back down and resumed masturbating. "So, still 'no' to showing half of you nipple?"</p><p>"Just die."</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>***</p>
</center>"Come on! You don't even like papayas!" whined Hermione.<p>"Still..."</p><p>"I'll give you half of my share of tomorrow's muscles in return."</p><p>"How about an oyster?" said Draco grinning. "I'm certainly ready to eat yours."</p><p>"Well, it's rear to find one, but ok, when I find it, I'll give it to you. So, deal?"</p><p>"I think you already have one."</p><p>She looked at him confused until he explicitly pointed with his index finger at her panties and her jaw dropped. "Have some shame!"</p><p>"I was joking, I know that's going too far. But I'll give this papaya to you if you agree to -"</p><p>"No way in hell!" she interrupted him. "I won't undress for a fruit! Who do you take me for?!"</p><p>"I wasn't going to ask that; all I want is for you to look at me as I wank."</p><p>"WHAT?!"</p><p>"You always avert your eyes. I would like you to watch me." She gave him a look of disgust. "You can look however you want. I can step back a bit more, but I want your eyes trained onto my cock."</p><p>After a prolonged silence Hermione looking down extended her arm held out her open hand to him. Draco grinned and gave her the fruit.</p><p>Draco waited patiently until she was done eating it; and as she was licking her sticky fingers his cock began to stir.</p><p>"Ready?" he asked.</p><p>"Now?!"</p><p>"I want to do it while it's still daylight. You agreed to watch me, and do it after dark isn't going to cut it."</p><p>"Uhm... Okay," Hermione said blushing, "I'm ready then."</p><p>Before this, she only caught glimpses of his erection and promptly averting her eyes, and now she watched it from start until she actually saw him cumming barely two minutes later.</p><p>After Draco finished, he lay back and stared at the stars in silence for some time.</p><p>"Hermione, are you asleep?"</p><p>"No."</p><p>"Just so you know, sometimes you do sleep like a rock. And I'm pretty sure I'd be able to sneak a peek under your top while you're unconscious and you wouldn't know it."</p><p>"That's why you asked whether I was still awake?!"</p><p>"Of course not! Why else I constantly ask you to show your breasts to me? Living on this island made you less smart or something? It was just to show you that -"</p><p>"Oh... Such a gentleman. He wouldn't lower himself to such underhanded actions as to molest a defenseless sleeping girl."</p><p>"Yes, I am this gentleman!"</p><p>"And what about you going about naked, and you constant wanking in my presence?"</p><p>"Well, it is inappropriate in a normal society, but with the society consisting of us two - it's normal. I do with my body whatever I want." He stopped before adding. "I give you that, threatening to cum on you the other day was not nice, but you constantly bringing that up grits on my nerves. And it was a joke, in case it wasn't clear enough. Of course I wouldn't do it without your permission! I respect you to much for that."</p><p>Hermione snorted. "You respect me?"</p><p>"Of course I do!"</p><p>"Since when?" she said still smirking.</p><p>"Well, I don't know exactly... Maybe since second year?"</p><p>"Pfff... Yeah, like I would believe it... You clearly hated me, the know-it-all mudblood of Hogwarts back then. You literally wished for the Slytherin monster to kill me."</p><p>"I didn't say I didn't hate you, I said I respected you. These are not mutually exclusive concepts. You were a muggleborn, mudblood to me back then, year after year taking first place at every subject. I wasn't jealous of your grades or anything, I didn't strive to become first, mostly I just got by. But on most of my seldom library visits - you were there, studying... I mean, take Potter, he certainly hates the Dark Lord, but I have no doubts that he respects him, unless he's a complete moron."</p><p>"I don't want to talk about it now."</p><p>"You know, I was going to give it to you either way."</p><p>"It?"</p><p>"The papaya."</p>
