  <p>
    <em>Parker Travis</em>
  </p>
</div><div>
  <p> Harry still couldn’t get used to that name .  Despite all the annoying fame connected to it he rather liked his name.  It was his.  </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Still, this was a highly important mission and Harry wasn’t going to throw it over a name.  If they wanted him to be Parker, he would do it.  Finding the communities of Death Eaters in the United States was something that needed to be done.  They had stamped out Voldemort, and Harry was damned if he was going to let the Death Eaters take root in the States.  </p>
</div><div>
  <p>MACUSA seemed certain that it couldn’t get to the extent it did in England over there, bordering almost on insulting about it really.  But they also didn’t turn down the idea of someone from the Wizarding War coming in to root out foreign war criminals.  </p>
</div><div>
  <p>In preparation for the mission, Hermione had been sending everything she could find on American culture and customs for the last month.  Harry went through all of it, hoping to not blow his cover immediately.  Ginny warned him to be careful first and foremost, and that she would be displeased if he broke his cover and risked himself on her account.  </p>
</div><div>
  <p>“Focus on your assignment and don’t get yourself killed before we can get married!” </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Harry had taken some time after the war to finish his Hogwarts education and spent a few years taking up the university scholarship he got for defeating Voldemort.  He also took time to get therapy.  He had found a very nice muggleborn therapist who helped him greatly in working through the years of mistreatment from the Dursleys and from his eventful Hogwarts career.  He had been unsure at first, but upon reading about cycles of abuse in uni, he was determined to avoid that.  He would sort himself out first because he’d rather die than harm Ginny or any children they had. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Harry shuffled through the somewhat crowded airport terminal.  A voice overhead announced that he was at ‘RDU International Airport’ and the local time was 11:45 AM. He held back a yawn, thankful that the two governments had covered his living arrangements and set everything up.  He just needed to go to the local government office and pick up the car he’d be using.  Once at his flat he couldn’t wait to sleep. </p>
</div><p>------</p>
<p></p><div>
  <p>As he drove, coffee in hand, he took in the sights.  He had learned about the United States but couldn’t remember anything significant about North Carolina, other than it being one of the original 13 Colonies.  It was a very humid place, especially in the summer the heat was hard to ignore. He drove with his window cracked open  and the air conditioner up.  </p>
</div><div>
  <p>He recalled the reading he did about how America had handled the reveal of magic.  A government with magic integrated but the country divided into magic and non magic districts, with laws on magical substances and items a bit more strict in the non-magic areas. Not that magic was forbidden but was encouraged to be limited to necessity only.  A somewhat problematic and easily abused way of doing things, Harry thought.  It made him think of Cornelius Fudge.  </p>
</div><div>
  <p>He drove into the town into the magic district aptly called Witchaven, passing a few large pastures with long driveways and fancy gates.  There were also a few broken down houses and trailers in messy yards and parks.  Quite a disparity in ways of living.  Brushing by the area of Cary, a mostly muggle districted area with parts where the magical district overlapped.  A sign and a road winding down to a prestigious looking school that stood where a sign read ‘Royale Prep Academy’.  </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Harry drove on and soon found the area where the school he’d be teaching at would be. James Jasper Junior-Senior High School. Curious, and now more awake, Harry decided to drive by and take a look.  James Jasper was a very different looking school at least compared to anything he’d been used to.  A building of brick with the words ‘J.J. High’ on the top and an area for buses to come in and out, and a parking lot of bright yellow school buses nearby. Down a hill, he could see rows of trailers that were rather small...were classes supposed to take place? In those? </p>
</div><div>
  <p>There were huge fields for mostly muggle sports but also a field with what seemed to be Quadpot hoops.  He had to remind himself that Quidditch wasn’t as commonplace here. There were cars in the parking lot and some staff, it seemed, coming in and out.  It was impossible to tell who was wizard and who was muggle because many of them were in common clothing.  He was told that the Jasper family, who had run the school for generations was a prominent wizard family in the area. Judging by the look of it , they weren’t ‘pureblood pride’ gits. At least they didn’t dress like it.  </p>
</div><div>
  <p>He spied a man in his forties or early fifties getting out of a car in a conversation with a young woman that looked like a teenager.  The man said something that ended the conversation leaving the young woman looking dismayed.  Possibly father and daughter.  But why were they both here before the start of school?</p>
</div><div>
  <p>He drove on slowly as many people filed into the building.  A young man came in holding a box of things.  They all seemed to dress rather casually for being the staff of a school. As he watched them file in he wondered if he should be there too.  His mobile buzzed and he checked it.  </p>
</div><div>
  <p>It was a reminder.  </p>
</div><div>
  <p>“James Jasper High - Open House”</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Oh bollocks.  That was tomorrow.  </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Harry had no idea what an open house was, but this was clearly important for his new job.  He was snapped out of his panic by a curly-haired man with a cup in his hand who had knocked at the window. Harry fumbled for the button and rolled down the window.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>“Can we help you, sir?”  The tone was clearly asking ‘ what in Merlin’s name are you doing out here?’ </p>
</div><div>
  <p>“Oh er sorry.”  Harry fished around and grabbed his badge.  To the other man it would appear as a name badge for the school. " just driving by to get a look.  Er...Parker Travis.  Chemistry and Physics” </p>
</div><div>
  <p>The man nodded, no longer looking suspicious.  “Ah right, right.  The other new teacher. Well, we’re doing pre-open house preparations if you want to come on in” The other new teacher?</p>
</div><div>
  <p>“All right....”. Harry was told everything he’d need would be at the flat.  “Just let me stop by my flat and get my things.”  He’d been working on some plans in preparation, those were in his suitcase.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>“Sure sure. See you there” the man nodded and walked away.  Harry sighed.  So much for sleep.  Looks like he’d just have to take the Jet Lag Elixer he’d picked up back in London.  </p>
  <p>-----</p>
</div><p> One Jet Lag Elixir and a shower later Harry was headed back to the school. His new home had indeed had everything he needed, including chemistry and physics textbooks, with a note from the American Auror office detailing some of the prominent areas that the pureblood pride groups were meeting and people they knew of involved.  </p>
<p></p><div>
  <p>Harry only recognized some names from prominent English wizard families many others seemed local ones he hadn’t heard of.  He memorized some of the other names.  Cain Adamson, Aiden McCrock Sr.,  Bathsheba Brunner, Terrence Foster, Jackson Aster, Bartimus Montague-McAllister-</p>
</div><div>
  <p>The mental image of Barty Crouch Jr’s empty, cold eyes flashed in Harry’s mind, and he shuddered.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>He had folded up the note and put it in a desk drawer to go over later.  There were no Jaspers on the list.  So at least his employers weren’t suspects.  </p>
</div><div>
  <p>As he drove up to the school, a few teachers were coming out and going to their cars.  He parked next to rusty, old looking car.  A few cars down a young Asian man in an ironed polo shirt leaned against his car, running a hand through his hair and swearing under his breath. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>“Nice going Merc” </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Harry chose to mind his own business, whatever was wrong with the man wasn’t his problem.  He gathered his things and checked the employment packet again to recall what the room number was.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> “205, B building.”</p>
</div><div>
  <p>In the main building, there were staff members walking around, chatting with one another about various things from summer activities to politics. A few snippets caught his ears as he passed. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>“President Callisto is an idiot, I don’t believe for a second he could pull off that kind of scheme, the Dems are desperate to get something on him.”</p>
</div><div>
  <p>“Pureblood pride, my ass.  If it’s so innocent then why are some of them making it a big secret? They know it looks bad because it’s all about thinking they’re better than people”. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>  “Or maybe they are just afraid that the papers are going to spin it like they’re some kind of monster for being proud of where they come from?” </p>
</div><div>
  <p>“Ol’ Rex has the school board by the ear, and he hates wizards. How long until he’s having us bring our IDs to work to just get in the door?”  </p>
</div><div>
  <p>He paused at the mention of pure-bloods just long enough to bump into a graying man in a sweater vest holding a coffee.  “Careful!”</p>
</div><div>
  <p>The man dabbed some of the coffee off his shirt with a handkerchief in his pocket. “Please watch where you’re going more carefully;”. He sighed, still glaring a bit. “I’ll send you a bill next time.” </p>
</div><div>
  <p>“Come on Fredrick...it was an accident.” another staff member said.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>“Don’t take that tone with me, I’m not a damn child.”</p>
</div><div>
  <p>The man huffed and tucked his handkerchief away.  </p>
</div><div>
  <p>“S-sorry,” Harry said. The man he’d seen outside passed by looking like he was trying hard not to say something. Fredrick took a deep calming breath. </p>
</div><div>
  <p> “Another new staffer, I see.  Jacob is filling up positions awfully last minute.”  The people around looked incredibly awkward. Harry wondered what he was supposed to say to that.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>“Yeah.  Parker Travis, Chemistry and physics.” </p>
</div><div>
  <p>“Dr Levine, I’m the school counselor.  Pleasure to meet you I suppose”. Harry noticed he put emphasis on the doctor in his name.  “Welcome to James Jasper Junior/Senior High, Parker. Try to watch out for coffee cups”  chuckling at his own joke he continued walking along, starting to complain to someone about something. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>As he walked away,  Harry wondered who on earth was going to go to that bloke for counseling.  He shook his head and continued trying to recall again where the B building was.  Many of the other teachers who greeted him as he passed by were much more friendly than Levine.  </p>
</div><div>
  <p>B Building, once he found it, was incredibly large, with many classrooms with open doors and radios playing softly as the teachers set up.  A few staffers were out putting up bulletin boards.  </p>
</div><div>
  <p>One woman made him do a double take when he heard her speaking.  She sounded and looked more like a student than a teacher. Her way of dress reminded Harry of Luna Lovegood. This was the woman he'd seen earlier in the parking lot, he realized. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Hi there! Welcome to JJ High! " she said brightly. She spoke in the southern accent many people here did but not too much to be hard to understand  "I'm Juley Beadley.  I'll be teaching English II and Creative Writing. And yes, I'm old enough and licensed to teach." She said that last part rather lightly but he didn't doubt she had gotten a comment or two about that.  Harry had already decided it was wise not to say anything about it. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>“Nice to meet you, I’m Parker Travis,   I’ll be teaching Chemistry and Physics.” Harry wasn’t sure if it was his imagination, but he could have sworn she blushed a little when he spoke. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>“Oh that sounds fun!” She said, “You know I never did good in either of those but I enjoyed physics a lot.  Even with all the math we had to do for it.  I bet there are lots of fun things to do teachin’ that subject.”  </p>
</div><div>
  <p>“Oh I have a few things planned” Harry had spent a good amount of time preparing ideas for his lessons for months after he was told about his assignment.  He prepared as if he had actually been hired as a teacher. Science had been a subject he found he enjoyed when studying at uni, especially as a wizard.  His chemistry teacher apparently thought that he was natural and asked quite a lot if he ever considered being a chemist.  Once he understood the basic information, it was rather like potions honestly.  </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"In my experience, if you're hands on, these kids will love your class." </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Good to know. Thank you.” </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Once in his room he set down his things and looked around.  There were long white tables lined up in rows through the room, some sort of eyewash thing in one corner, and a fire extinguisher that looked like it was rarely touched.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Sinks lined one side of the room , with one labeled "for disposal use only , do not use for washing hands"</p>
</div><div>
  <p>In place of a fire alarm there were obviously magically made fire sensors. It was a blend of muggle and magical.  He started to unpack things and made a trip back to the car.  When he returned, a tall lanky red headed bespectacled man in an olive colored jacket and woven shirt was looking over the room. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>“Hello.” Harry set down the box he was holding.  </p>
</div><div>
  <p>The man jumped nearly half of a foot and turned around.  “Ooh! 'Ello there.” He had a strong Irish accent.  He also looked, in Harry’s opinion, to be perpetually dazed.  His eyes traveled to Harry’s wand holster at his side. He’d forgotten he had it on still. How had nobody made so much as a comment?  “Aye. Another wizard who went inta science.  Nice” </p>
</div><div>
  <p>“Yes... erm. You are...?”</p>
</div><div>
  <p>“Ah right. Orion McDunnan. Biology an’ Earth Science.”</p>
</div><div>
  <p>“Parker Travis. Chemistry and Physics” </p>
</div><div>
  <p>“Nice to meet ya. So you just come over the pond then?”</p>
</div><div>
  <p>“The...oh. Yes.” He tried to think of a reason “Needed a change.” </p>
</div><div>
  <p>“Aye. I get it.  I came over as li’l thing.  Mum was paranoid about things over there.  You know the return of You Know ‘O.” Harry resisted the urge to say his name.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>“It’s safe now...to say his name.  He’s gone”</p>
</div><div>
  <p>“I know. Just don’t like it.  Fella’s a demon, far as I’m concerned.”</p>
</div><div>
  <p>“I think that’s giving him too much credit.  He was just a wizard at the end of the day.” Harry said.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>“More evil than hell itself though.” Orion shuddered. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>“Mmm.” Harry nodded. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>“Well... welcome to North Carolina.” Orion changed the subject quickly. “The folks here are friendly but a li’l tricky to understand sometimes.”  </p>
</div><div>
  <p>“It’s not too bad” Harry said.  </p>
</div><div>
  <p>“Ahh huh. Wait ‘til you hear the ones from really down south.  Like D’Aubert.  Boy needs a translator if you ask me.” </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Harry chuckled.  “so...is this a good place to work?”</p>
</div><div>
  <p>“It’s not bad” Orion shrugged. “The budget ain’t Hogwarts though.  Pay is peanuts. This is public school. For one,  Kids wear whatever they want so long as it doesn’t offend and covers the body properly. And even then sometimes....” he shook his head. “Bloody teenagers, you know. Anyway , mosta the people are decent...” he hesitated.  </p>
</div><div>
  <p>“Most?”</p>
</div><div>
  <p>“Aye. Yeah. Dr. Levine is a real git.  Like a slimy li’l piece of shit.  Friendly with the school board folks.  Don’t like the Jaspers much.  Especially ol’ Jacob since he doesn’t bow down and schmooze up to Levine.  Fellas also a real creep too in my opinion.  Married his lady soon as she got out of high school-“</p>
</div><div>
  <p>“What?”  Harry did the math, recalling Levine, he must have been around forty or maybe fifty. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>“She was technically 18, but just barely.  ‘Spect the sleaze was counting down” </p>
</div><div>
  <p>“His wife is..” Harry recalled the man and young teacher from the parking lot. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>“Creative writing teacher.”  Orion nodded. “Still goes by her maiden name around here.  He’s not too popular.” </p>
</div><div>
  <p>“I met her.  They’re married?” </p>
</div><div>
  <p>“Yup. He was a counselor at her school, least til he mysteriously resigned weeks before her graduation. Funny, that.” </p>
</div><div>
  <p>“Yeah....funny” Harry was still feeling many levels of disturbed at this information. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>“Oh and the new fella here is the kid of Royale’s headmaster.  Don’t know much about him but I hear stories about Headmaster Malcolm.  Kicked out a kid to protect his bullies. And he’s another person friendly with Levine, so you know, association. School board politics are something aren’t they?” </p>
</div><div>
  <p>“How is Levine even still hired?  If people know what he is, then certainly...”</p>
</div><div>
  <p>“Oh, money.  He is rich as hell.  People will overlook a lot for that. A crusty old religious fundie has the school board in his pocket and they don’t trust a school run by a wizard family so they shoved him on us” Orion glanced at a pocket watch “Ah, should be finishing up.  See you around, Travis”. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>As he left Harry swore he could hear the man muttering about needing a drink. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>He finished preparing his classroom until it was at least reasonably ready for people to see it.  As he made his way out, he saw Levine and Juley together again, talking. Levine’s arms wrapped around her waist speaking talking softly to her. It was uncomfortable to watch, and Harry had to hold himself back from hexing the man right on the spot</p>
</div>
  </div>
