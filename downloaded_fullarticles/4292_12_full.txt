    <p align="center">**</p><p>“You need to stop moping,” Ginny said, sitting down heavily on one of the plush red armchairs by the fire.</p><p>Hermione started, blinking rapidly to shake the fog from her eyes, her brain struggling to focus on the conversation she suddenly found herself engaged in. “What?”</p><p>Ginny sighed and kicked her feet up, knocking a few of Hermione’s books astray. The older girl glared at her, but Ginny just raised an eyebrow, daring her to say something. “You need to stop moping about, Hermione. Depression is not a good colour on you.”</p><p>Hermione tipped her nose in the air and turned back to her Transfiguration essay. “I have no idea what you’re talking about.”</p><p>Ginny crossed her arms over her chest. She glared off towards the corner of the Common Room, where her brother and his tramp of the month, Lavender Brown, sat… <em>coupling</em>. “Ugh,” Ginny snorted in disgust. “Really, you think they’d have more class than that. Lavender leaves <em>nothing</em> to the imagination.”</p><p>“Ginny…” Hermione scolded softly.</p><p>“<em>What</em>? It’s true.” Ginny stared at her brother for a few more seconds. “It looks like he’s eating her face.”</p><p>“Ginny, stop,” Hermione said through her half-smile.</p><p>“Look at him, sticking his tongue down her throat. Of course he would be doing this <em>here</em>.” Ginny reached into her robes and pulled out her wand with one quick flourish.</p><p>“What are you doing?” Hermione exclaimed.</p><p>“Teaching <em>Ronald</em> to have a little tact.”</p><p>“Ginny, no!” Hermione stretched across the ottoman and grabbed her friend’s wrist. “You’ll only make it worse,” she continued quietly, hoping that despite her outburst she had avoided detection by the two pairs of eyes she really didn’t want to notice them.</p><p>(Part of her knew, of course, that they <em>had</em> to know she was there. They walked in after she had already cemented her place in front of the fireplace. There’s no way Ron and Lavender could have missed her.)</p><p>“Or I could make it infinitely <em>better</em>. Come on, Hermione. I’ve been toying with this new spell. See if you do it right, he’ll get these <em>massive</em> boils—”</p><p>“I mean worse for <em>me</em>, Ginny. I just want to forget all of this…” she waved her hand, trailing off.</p><p>Ginny lowered her wand, her eyes glinting in the firelight. “Merlin, Hermione, I’m sorry. I didn’t think—”</p><p>“It’s nothing, Gin. Just forget it, okay?” She took a stabilizing breath. “What’s done is done. I’m doing fine and Ron is… well, he certainly <em>looks</em> happy.”</p><p>“But you’re <em>not</em> fine, you’re <em>miserable</em>. I’ve seen you, Hermione. You’re barely eating, all you do is write essays— you haven’t even made any clothes for the elves in the past few weeks. I don’t like who you are when you’re like this. I’m worried about you.”</p><p>“I’m trying, okay? Ron and I <em>just</em> broke up—”</p><p>“He’s an idiot.”</p><p>“I know.” Hermione smiled. “It’s only been about a month and—”</p><p>“And he’s <em>already</em> moved on.”</p><p>“<em>And</em> all I’m interested in right now is enjoying a little ‘me’ time.” Hermione smiled at her friend kindly. Ginny bit her lip. Hermione leaned forwards and whispered, a touch conspiratorially, “But keep that spell handy, will you? I don’t know how I’ll be feeling in a few weeks.”</p><p>Ginny grinned. “You got it ‘Mione.” She chanced another look at Ron. “I could just hex him a <em>little</em>.”</p><p>“<em>No</em>, Gin.”</p><p>“Alright fine, I get it. Ron gets to keep all his bits together.”</p><p>From their corner of the room, Lavender laughed a high, disgustingly delighted chortle that had her <em>shaking</em> on Ron’s lap. He had a shit-eating grin plastered to his face the likes of which Ginny had never seen before.</p><p>Hermione sighed from off to Ginny’s left, and the youngest Weasley turned with disgust from her brother and focused solely on her best friend.</p><p>Hermione was beat; there was no other way to put it. Her hair, usually so vivacious and wild, looked sad, flat, and unkempt. She was thinner than she had been over the summer, and her robes weren’t neatly pressed (her usual style of wearing them — impeccably clean and precise). Her skin wasn’t as dark as it usually was (especially troublesome because they were coming out of summer break), and instead seemed light, giving her the startling impression of being very ill. And she seemed sad, and frankly <em>miserable</em>, while Ginny's absolute <em>prat</em> of a brother was off gallivanting with Lavender Bloody Brown.</p><p>It sucked. Ginny almost killed Ron when he told their family that he and Hermione had ended things. He had never given them a reason, and Hermione herself had steadfastly avoided the conversation for weeks on end, so Ginny didn’t even have a clue as to <em>why</em> they were no longer together. One day they were fine and then the next…</p><p>It was hard not to speculate. Certainly everyone else did (and Ginny had never bothered pretending that she was above mindless gossip). She couldn’t go a single day without overhearing some conversation in some corridor about why Ron Weasley had dumped Hermione Granger.</p><p>
  <em>“I heard she got too annoying for him.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“I heard she wouldn’t put out.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“I heard her parents hated him.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“I heard he found out about her relationship with Harry Potter.”</em>
</p><p>Each rumour was more absurd than the last, and Ginny had no idea what to believe. She’d been half-tempted to beat it out of Ron, but her devotion to her best friend had kept her violence-free ever since they got back from holiday. She wasn't happy about it, but Hermione needed her more than Ron needed a black eye.</p><p>She hated it, the whole thing. The powerlessness, the helplessness, the anger and the pain she could see inside Hermione. She hated seeing this girl, this wonderful, powerful girl reduced to a shell of her former self because Ginny's cock of a brother couldn’t keep it in his pants. Forget the breakup — that was bad enough. But then to go and do something like <em>this, </em>with someone like <em>her, </em>when Hermione was relegated to quiet defeat...</p><p>Ginny could hardly stand it.</p><p>“You need a boyfriend,” Ginny supplied suddenly, pulling Hermione from the depths of her reading after only a few minutes.</p><p>“I need a moment to <em>think</em>, Ginny.” Hermione looked up then, a frown on her face as if processing the spoken information for the first time. “And <em>what</em>?”</p><p>“You need a boyfriend. A distraction. Something to take your mind off of Ron.”</p><p>“School takes my mind off of Ron.”</p><p>Ginny rolled her eyes. “Well <em>that’s</em> a lie. If school took your mind off of Ron you’d be your normal self right now. And you’re not.”</p><p>Hermione pulled a face. “What I <em>need</em>, Ginny is <em>not</em> a new boyfriend. I need time to myself, to think and process and try to stomach looking at your brother without wanting to hex everything in striking distance, and just… time to <em>breathe</em>. And I need you to be my best friend right now, okay? My best and decidedly <em>female</em> friend. Ron and I aren’t speaking and Harry is always on Ron’s side about everything anyway and I—need someone to talk to sometimes too. Can't you just be my best friend for now?”</p><p>Ginny’s bravado melted immediately. “I’m sorry. You know how I can get so thick-headed sometimes. Of <em>course</em> I’ll be your best friend.” Hermione smiled a tight-lipped smile at her. Ginny leaned closer across the table, stared directly into Hermione’s eyes and said, earnestly, “I care about you, Hermione… honestly I do. And I <em>am</em> looking out for you,” she reached out and laid her hand on top of the one not holding Hermione’s quill.</p><p>“Maybe you could look out for me a little less vocally?”</p><p>Ginny smiled softly. “I’ll do my very best.”</p><p align="center">**</p><p>She made it exactly 40 hours.</p><p>“Please get a boyfriend.” Ginny slid into the empty space opposite Hermione at the breakfast table, ignoring the food piled in front of her and her empty plate in favor of watching her friend.</p><p>Hermione looked up from the book she was reading (pleasure, not business). “We’ve been here before, Gin.”</p><p>“A never ending circle.”</p><p>“I recognize that tree.”</p><p>Ginny shook her head. “I’m not asking for much. Just— I don’t know… go on a few dates, maybe snog some bloke a bit. It doesn’t have to be anything serious.”</p><p>“How is that fair to the poor boy you’re asking me to Shanghai into a relationship?”</p><p>Ginny blinked at Hermione in confusion. “I hate when you make up words.”</p><p>Hermione laughed and rolled her eyes, admonishing softly, “Ginny—”</p><p>“No but seriously, why don’t you just… use ‘em and lose ‘em?”</p><p>“That’s horribly crude.” Ginny shrugged as if to say, <em>What can you do? </em>“I’m not going to <em>use</em> anyone.”</p><p>Ginny leaned across the Gryffindor table. “It would make Ron absolutely <em>furious</em>,” she whispered.</p><p>Hermione paused from her book, her spoon half way between her bowl and her mouth. She looked up with a thoughtful expression on her face. Ginny smirked and raised an eyebrow.</p><p>“No… no that’s absurd.” Hermione shook her head vigorously to dispel the (admittedly rather pleasant) notion. “I couldn’t do that. It wouldn’t be fair… and besides, I’m not interested in dating right now.”</p><p>Ginny sighed and slumped back in her seat. “You’re letting him win. He’s <em>winning</em> the breakup!”</p><p>“Everything you’re saying is ridiculous! You can’t <em>win</em> a breakup.”</p><p>“Obviously you can, and Ron is doing it!”</p><p>“You’re being childish. Not everything is about winning and losing.”</p><p>Ginny frowned at Hermione’s nonchalance. “I can’t believe how okay you are with this. I want to kill him every time I see him.”</p><p>“Well of course I want to kill him.” Hermione said, still pouring over her tome. “Well… not <em>kill</em> him kill him. Maybe just… inflict bodily harm? He’s just been…” She paused for a moment and sighed deeply. “I just wish he would talk to me,” she finished quietly.</p><p>Ginny frowned, unsure that she'd heard correctly. “Sorry, what was that?”</p><p>Hermione shook herself. “It’s not important. What <em>is</em> important is that I refuse to be bitter about this sort of thing. It isn’t healthy. So, until the day comes where I can talk to Ronald without wanting to conjure up a pack of canaries to peck his eyes out—” Ginny giggled at that particularly fond memory— “I’m going to read my books, and eat my porridge, and ignore everything everyone else is saying.”</p><p>Hermione stopped talking, and Ginny sensed an end to all further communication on this particular subject.</p><p>And for a moment she was fine with letting it drop (honestly she was). She would have been happy enough knowing that Hermione was strong in her own way, fighting her battles silently but determinedly. She <em>would</em> have been, honest… only she didn’t have time to digest it all. She just needed a few minutes to sit and comprehend what Hermione said, to resign herself to a role of passive observance, to stomach the fact that maybe Hermione <em>wasn’t</em> as torn up about this breakup as some people might like to think, but—</p><p>But mere moments after Hermione finished her spiel, who should walk in the Great Hall? None other than Ronald ‘The Biggest Idiot on the Planet’ Weasley and Lavender ‘Tart’ Brown.</p><p>And Ginny <em>would</em> have let the whole thing drop, honestly she would have, except Ron was staring unabashedly down Lavender’s top while she giggled (in a way she surely thought was alluring) at something he must have said (that surely couldn’t have been all that clever), and Ginny had never hated her brother more.</p><p>People were looking, and whispering, and staring between him and Hermione, and Ginny couldn’t bloody <em>take</em> how horrible her brother was being about all this, shoving his new ‘relationship’ right in Hermione’s face. In the worst possible way. With tactless, blood-curdling cruelty.</p><p>So Ginny reacted. Probably a little rash, probably without much forethought (she'd been known to lack forethought on occasion; a trait she shared with Ron that she absolutely refused to acknowledge).</p><p>She stood up swiftly, her sudden movement attracting a bit of attention from the few people directly around her. Ginny took a deep breath and then vaulted over the table with an ease and grace she would have been quite proud of, were she to stop and think about it.</p><p>She landed on the bench next to Hermione, straddling the wood, and her friend started and looked up. “Ginny!” she gasped, loud enough to draw more than a few stares. Ginny felt the eyes of the school on her (quite aware that Hermione was something of a person of interest recently).</p><p><em>This is for your own good, Hermione,</em> Ginny thought. “Just go with it,” was all she managed to say before she threaded her fingers through Hermione’s hair, gripped the back of her neck, and brought their lips together with bruising force.</p><p align="center">**</p><p>Hermione squeaked and froze almost immediately, but Ginny did not let it deter her. She kept her right hand in Hermione’s hair and slipped her left one around the older girl’s waist, pulling them tightly together.</p><p>Hermione was suddenly very aware of three very important things. One: it was now completely, deathly quiet in the Great Hall. Two: warm, sure fingers were gently stroking her side, causing the muscles in her back to shiver and tremble. And three: Ginny Weasley’s lips were the softest thing she had ever felt in her life.</p><p>Ginny pulled away slowly, detaching their lips with a soft reverence that set Hermione off-balance. They stared at each other for a few long, tense, utterly silent moments before someone, out in the sea of gaping, gawking students, wolf-whistled.</p><p>“Alright get some, Weasley!” a boy shouted, and the Great Hall erupted with noise.</p><p>Hermione flushed darkly and quickly gathered her books, stuffed everything into her large book bag, and slipped away as quickly as she could, trying uselessly to remain unseen.</p><p align="center">**</p><p>Ginny didn’t watch Hermione leave. She was too busy staring at her brother, who was making eye contact with her for the first time in give or take two weeks. His mouth was open, his face doing a very accurate impression of a gaping fish. His arms hung limp at his sides, his girlfriend/prostitute forgotten next to him. He was staring at Ginny with a strange expression in his eyes. Shock, awe, disbelief and… there it was, the thing that made Ginny grin with triumph and stand to finally follow Hermione out of the room.</p><p><em>Jealousy</em>.</p><p>When Ginny brushed past her brother while exiting, she felt him turn to watch her leave, and if there was a little extra jaunt in her step as she strolled away from the exploding and spreading gossip, then that was just as well.</p><p align="center">**</p><p>“I’m sorry.” Ginny's plea was met with no response. “Hermione, I’m <em>sorry</em>.”</p><p>“I’m not talking to you.”</p><p>“I <em>swear</em> I was just trying to help.”</p><p>Hermione turned on her, her eyes flashing with a sharp fire. “You thought you were <em>helping</em> me? What the hell, Ginny? I told you I didn’t <em>need</em> your help. I told you I didn’t <em>need</em> to date anyone, that I didn’t <em>want</em> to date anyone.”</p><p>“I know, but—”</p><p>“You had absolutely <em>no</em> right to do what you did… to—to <em>kiss</em> me in the middle of the Great Hall like that!”</p><p>“I know, and I’m <em>sorry</em>, but—”</p><p>“You—you violated—" Hermione was trembling, her body thrumming with furious energy. Ginny's face had gone ashen and she must have looked worse than she felt (stricken, ashamed almost) because Hermione caught a glimpse of her expression and swallowed thickly. It should have made Ginny feel better but it didn't. "You took advantage of our friendship," Hermione continued, her voice simmering, "and you <em>completely</em> went against everything I told you not to do! What’s going to happen tomorrow? Did you think about <em>that</em>? The whole <em>school</em> is going to know about this. What are our professors going to say?”</p><p>“Well, I’m sure they have more important—”</p><p>“What’s your <em>mother</em> going to say, Ginny?” That was enough to stop Ginny’s train of thought. “You didn’t figure that into your brilliant scheme, did you? What’s your mother going to say when Ron writes to her to tell her that you’ve been snogging girls in front of the whole school?”</p><p>Ginny bristled. “It’s no one’s business who I snog.”</p><p>“You’re <em>trying</em> to make it everyone’s business by doing it in public, on display like… like a <em>fucking</em> show pony!” Ginny blinked. Hermione <em>never</em> cursed, and she never said words like ‘fucking,’ never ever. “And Merlin, Ginny, <em>two girls</em>? Have you ever heard of two girls kissing?”</p><p>Ginny rolled her eyes. “It’s not exactly <em>uncommon</em>, Hermione.”</p><p>“It is where I come from! What am I supposed to tell my parents?”</p><p>“You don’t have to tell your parents anything! This isn’t <em>real.</em> They don't need to know. You <em>know</em> why we’re doing this.”</p><p>“I know why <em>you</em> think you’re doing this! You’re doing this out of some misguided sense of friendship and solidarity but you’re wrong and <em>this</em> is wrong. You think I need this but I <em>don’t</em>, Ginny.”</p><p>“I was just trying to help you!”</p><p>“I didn’t ask you to! You’re not my girlfriend!”</p><p>“You're right! I’m <em>not</em> your girlfriend but as far as everyone else knows, I <em>am</em>. It's so perfect I can't believe I didn't think of it sooner. Hermione, you should have <em>seen</em> Ron’s face after we kissed! I thought he was going to hit me.”</p><p>Hermione shook her head, face flushed and hair wild. “Why are you trying to make everything about <em>him</em>? It isn’t! I don’t care what he thinks about this, I don’t care if he shat a brick after seeing you and I kiss, I don’t care if he <em>doesn’t</em> care. <em>I</em> <em>don’t care</em>.”</p><p>Ginny ran her fingers roughly through her hair. “Look, you can hate me all you want, you can hex me, curse at me, <em>hit</em> me for all I care, but can we save our massive public breakup until Ron’s already come crawling back to you on his hands and knees begging you to take him back?”</p><p>Hermione released a powerful breath through her nostrils. “I can’t believe you. You still think I'm worried about getting him back?”</p><p>“Hermione—” But Ginny didn’t get to finish her thought. At that moment the portrait hole was pushed open and the soft murmur of student voices wafted through the wall and into the Common Room. Hermione pulled her gaze from Ginny’s, wiped at her eyes, and took a tentative but distinct step backwards.</p><p>A few people trickled in. The quiet buzz of conversation dipped in volume as the students saw who was already inside. A few people (none of whom Ginny was familiar with) cleared their throats and glanced between them. The standoff seemed unlikely to cease — no one seemed confident enough to break the awkward tension.</p><p>A seventh year girl who Ginny recognized only by sight snickered something to her friend that sounded like ‘bike’. Ginny had no idea what the girl <em>actually</em> said, but based on the way Hermione bristled next to her, it probably wasn’t good.</p><p>“Come on, Hermione, let’s go.” Ginny said, reaching behind her to grab Hermione’s hand. She wrenched the older girl along behind her. Ginny, being rather tall and fairly strong to boot, elbowed her way through the muttering crowd with little difficulty, Hermione trailing after her without protest.</p><p>Out in the hallway Hermione was quick to yank her hand out of Ginny’s. “Watch what you’re doing,” she hissed, taking a step backwards and away.</p><p>Ginny huffed. “What, I can’t hold your hand now?” Hermione didn’t respond; instead she turned and made like she was about to stalk off. Ginny grabbed her arm and pulled her back around. “What the hell is your problem? This isn’t a big deal. It was only a kiss.”</p><p>“You can’t just go around <em>kissing</em> random people, Ginny. That isn’t the way things work.”</p><p>“Okay, honestly? You’re freaking out over something that really shouldn’t be a big deal. I kissed you — <em>once</em>. It was nice, or whatever. The point is it didn’t mean anything to me and it <em>certainly</em> didn’t mean anything to you, so why don’t we just… I don’t know… <em>pretend</em> to like each other so that my prat of a brother gets what he deserves?”</p><p>“And how, exactly, is me pretending to date you going to stick it to him?”</p><p>Ginny rolled her eyes. “Am I even speaking English anymore? I <em>told</em> you. <em>Jealousy</em>.”</p><p>“I don’t care if he’s jealous!”</p><p>“Merlin, Hermione, at this point it doesn’t make any difference! People are going to be talking about this, and despite how hard you may try to deny it, no one is going to believe you.”</p><p>“But I’ll be telling—”</p><p>Ginny scoffed. “You think the truth matters? The entire school saw us snog; they know <em>something’s</em> up. Either way, come tomorrow, people are going to think we’re together. Maybe not <em>together</em> together, but at least snogging occasionally… and maybe shagging.”</p><p>“Ginny!” Hermione exclaimed, appalled.</p><p>“Oh whatever. Look, if you want to ‘break up’ with me, that’s fine. Do whatever you like. But I seriously think you should wait a month or two. Let it sink in. Let Ron see that you don’t need him, that you have <em>never</em> needed him, and that he can go fuck himself for all you care.”</p><p>“But I don’t want—”</p><p>“And <em>then</em>,” Ginny interrupted, “when he’s gotten it through that thick skull of his that you’re fit and desirable and that you in no way need him to feel validated about yourself, he’ll come back to you on bended knee begging you to take him back. Because you’re the best thing that ever happened to him, and he may not realize it, but <em>I</em> certainly do. And when all of that happens you can dump me hard and fast in front of everyone, and then you and Ron can ride your broomsticks off into the sunset together.” Hermione pulled a face. Ginny rolled her eyes. “Or you can ride a hippogriff into the sunset, because I know you hate brooms.”</p><p>Hermione squinted slightly, a pondering expression forefront on her face. “That… actually sounds… not <em>terrible</em>.”</p><p>“High praise coming from you.” It was Hermione's turn to roll her eyes. “But I know this will work, because I am a genius. So just… I don’t know… walk to class with me. Let me hold your books for you, hold my hand at dinner, maybe kiss me on the cheek before you go to bed.” Hermione looked like she was about to interrupt, but Ginny wouldn’t let her. “It doesn’t have to be big, it doesn’t have to be grand. It just has to be <em>something</em>. We just have to look like we’re a couple. Do you think that’ll kill you, or are you fine with playing along with all of this?”</p><p>Hermione was silent for a moment. “And your mother?”</p><p>Ginny shrugged. “I’ll tell her we’re together, if she asks, or if the time comes that I see her before our ‘break up’. It doesn’t matter to me.”</p><p>“She won’t be… upset with you? Or— I don’t know… disappointed?”</p><p>Ginny's face took on something strange. “Why would she be disappointed?”</p><p>“Look, Ginny…” Hermione took a deep breath and one step forwards. “I know that you don’t know this, and I guess things are different here in the wizarding world, but… this isn’t going to be an easy thing for us. I hope you know that. Here it might not be that strange to see two girls in a relationship, but… well, it’s not exactly <em>allowed</em> in the Muggle world.”</p><p>Ginny blinked. “It isn’t ‘<em>allowed’</em>? How can they not ‘<em>allow’</em> it?”</p><p>“It isn’t <em>normal</em>. It isn’t the normal thing for people to do.”</p><p>“So that’s what makes you so uncomfortable about this?” Ginny asked, affronted. “You think that this isn’t <em>normal</em>? What if I like girls, Hermione? What if I want to date them? Would you not talk to me anymore because I’m not ‘<em>normal’</em>?”</p><p>“Of course not, don’t be ridiculous! I have no problem with it, but some people definitely do… like that girl inside who called us ‘dykes’.”</p><p>"I <em>told</em> you that when you make up words—”</p><p>“I didn’t make that up, and I’m not making this up. Prejudice is a hard thing to get rid of, and anyone who’s spent a good deal of time with Muggles may be… <em>unwilling</em> to accept our new ‘relationship’.” She used her hands to put unnecessary air-quotes around the last word.</p><p>“Well for starters, I think you need to remember that nothing is going to change in our <em>actual</em> relationship. This is all just pretend. But either way, why would anyone care? Why is it any of their business?”</p><p>“Well <em>I</em> don’t know, but some people don’t exactly like it.” Hermione sighed. “Look, I’m just saying that… if you want to do this, you’re going to have to start making some adjustments. You’re going to have to be prepared for the way people are going to talk about you. About us. Some people are going to insult you, and some people are going to hate you, and some people are going to stare at you like you've never been stared at before. You have to be ready for that.”</p><p>“I don’t…” Ginny paused for a second. “Look, I don’t <em>care</em> what anyone says. I don’t care what people think about me. I love you. You’re my best friend. So please… pretend to go out with me?” She grinned, arms spread open in offering. “Let me help you out. Let me be the best fake girlfriend you’ve ever had.”</p><p>Hermione's lips quirked up, and she struggled to suppress her smile. “Alright. Fine. I’ll pretend to be your girlfriend.”</p><p>“Excellent.”</p><p>“Just… warn me before you kiss me next time?”</p><p>“Promise,” Ginny said with a devilish grin on her face. This was going to be good. Ron wasn’t going to know what to do with himself.</p><p align="center">**</p><p>That evening, after a long day of avoiding confrontation and conversation with anyone and everyone, Hermione and Ginny were paused outside of the Gryffindor Common Room. The Fat Lady stared at the pair of them from inside her picture frame, an unamused scowl on her face.</p><p>Ginny cleared her throat. “So… Are you going to say the password, or—?”</p><p>“I don’t want to go in there.” Hermione said softly. The Fat Lady snorted at her. “I’m serious, Ginny, I don’t. I don’t want to deal with… and oh God I share a dorm with Lavender and Parvati, what am I—”</p><p>“Then we won’t,” Ginny said simply. “We won’t go inside. Come on, I think I have an idea.”</p><p>“You’re a bloody waste of time, all of you!” The portrait shouted after them as they dashed away. “A bloody waste of my valuable time!”</p><p>“Ignore her,” Ginny said with an eye roll. “She's just spewing hot air. She wouldn’t know what to do without all of us. Who else could she force to listen to her terrible singing?” Hermione laughed. Ginny smiled.</p><p>“So where are we going, then?”</p><p>“The only place two people can go to sleep if they don’t want to be in their House.”</p><p>Hermione quirked an eyebrow as she followed Ginny through long, dark hallways. “Oddly that didn’t help much with letting me know where we’re off to.”</p><p>“The Room of Requirement.”</p><p>“Ginny!” Hermione scolded, “We can’t sleep <em>there</em>.”</p><p>“Why not? It’s not like anyone else is using it.”</p><p>“I just… do you really think—?” Hermione paused as they came to the familiar span of empty wall, across from the tapestry of the dancing troll. Hermione eyed the stones with a pensive look on her face. “The last time we were here…”</p><p>Ginny squeezed her hand, ever so slightly. “I know. Umbridge, the DA, the Department of Mysteries…”</p><p>“Feels like a lifetime ago, doesn’t it?” Hermione whispered.</p><p>Ginny nodded. “Like it happened to different people.”</p><p>They stood there, side by side in their memories and in the recollection of days long since passed. It took a few moments for Ginny to untangle their hands and start her pacing, but when she did Hermione let her go without a fight.</p><p>“So I’ll just… ask for a couple of beds and then we’ll go to sleep and we’ll get up tomorrow and worry about everything else. It’s no use worrying tonight when we don’t have to.” Ginny smiled when the door materialized after her third time passing in front of the wall. “You need some decent sleep anyway. And I don’t mind staying here, honest.”</p><p>“You’re a good friend, Ginny.”</p><p>“I want you to remember this moment when you think about how furious you were at me only a few hours ago. I’m likely to piss you off in the future, so just please remember that I am, indeed, a good friend.”</p><p>Hermione rolled her eyes. “You’re ridiculous. I was furious with you because you caught me by surprise earlier and kissed me without asking.” Hermione shot Ginny a look, “Which I still haven’t forgiven you for, by the way. Not because you’re a bad friend.”</p><p>Ginny smiled but did not respond, choosing instead to reach out in front of her and push open the door.</p><p>The door swung open. Inside was a rather small room. In the center sat a large bed not unlike those found in the Gryffindor dorms, with crimson sheets and white pillows and a canopy stretched above. A modest fire cracked from a corner fireplace, providing gentle heat to the otherwise dark space.</p><p>“You’re acting like it was the most dreadful experience of your life.” Ginny whined as she trailed after her friend into the newly-appeared bedroom. “I have it on good authority that I am actually quite a decent kisser.” Ginny pulled her robes over her head and kicked off her trousers, leaving her in just a t-shirt and pants (but as Hermione had seen her in less neither one of them was particularly bothered). She slipped into the bed and threw back the covers, grinning and patting the empty space next to her. “You can’t have <em>detested</em> it.”</p><p>Hermione looked down, the faint hint of a blush sweeping up her cheeks to colour them only slightly. “Well… it wasn’t <em>horrible</em>.”</p><p>Ginny threw herself onto her back, arms tucked under her head. “You liked it, just the littlest bit. Admit it.”</p><p>Hermione huffed and yanked her sweater over her head, thoroughly mussing up already untidy hair. She grumbled as she kicked off her shoes and flopped onto her back too, mirroring Ginny’s position, eyes firmly fixed on the ceiling. “I will do no such thing.”</p><p>Ginny laughed and shook her head, a fond smile on her lips. “Sorry about only one bed, by the way. Could have sworn I asked for two."</p><p>Ginny felt the bed dip as Hermione shrugged. "We've bunked together before. I already know you snore."</p><p>"I kick, too."</p><p>"So do I."</p><p>Ginny laughed lightly under her breath. "Goodnight, Hermione.”</p><p>“I’ll probably be mad at you again in the morning.”</p><p>“Well then let’s hope we sleep until the afternoon.”</p><p align="center">**</p><p>Harry awoke to an empty dormitory. He sat up in bed, rubbing tiredly at his eyes before slipping his glasses onto the bridge of his nose. He frowned at the emptiness around him. He hadn’t a clue where Seamus, Dean, and Neville had gotten to already — usually he was one of the first awake, so to rise with the sun already high in the sky and not a person in sight, Harry was more than a little confused. Then again, he <em>had</em> tossed and turned for much of the night; after witnessing Hermione and Ginny kiss at breakfast, he had spent much of the day on a hunt for his two friends and avoiding Ron. He didn’t want to have to deal with Ron’s sour mood any longer than he had to, and he was also worried about how Hermione was handling Ginny just… <em>outing</em> them like that, so abruptly and seemingly without consent or forewarning.</p><p>He was worried for an entire day, and it didn’t help his sleep one bit.</p><p>Harry ran a hand through his hair in a helpless attempt to quash the untidiness and threw on the first clothes he could find. He rushed down the stairs, laces undone and fighting with the crooked tie around his neck, and he almost barreled over a loitering Ron, who looked as if he had been perched at the bottom of the stairs waiting for Harry to come down for quite some time.</p><p>“Oh!” Harry exclaimed, not unkindly. “Hello, Ron. Care for some breakfast?”</p><p>Ron nodded but otherwise did not respond. Harry cleared his throat uncomfortably, finally managing to correct his tie (but ignoring his trainers) while the two of them moved silently out into the corridor.</p><p>“So, um…” Harry shifted awkwardly on his feet, “You seen Ginny or Hermione yet?” he asked warily.</p><p>Ron glowered. “Nope,” he bit out, “I haven’t see them since breakfast yesterday.”</p><p>Harry chuckled nervously and rubbed the back of his neck. “Speaking of which… that was some breakfast then, wasn’t it?” He hoped to understand how Ron was feeling about the whole… ex-girlfriend dating his sister thing. He knew that Ron wouldn’t be exactly ecstatic about it, but he still might be able to gain a little insight. Test the waters, as it were. It must be strange for him. Probably uncomfortable, and a little painful, too. After all, Ron had never told Harry <em>why, </em>exactly, he and Hermione broke up. And if <em>this </em>was the reason... well, it would certainly explain a <em>lot.</em></p><p>But then Ron scoffed, and Harry knew that he had been too optimistic to ever think that Ron would have a clear head about anything.</p><p>Harry cleared his throat and didn’t speak. He didn’t know what to say to break the suddenly uncomfortable silence, so he didn’t say anything at all.</p><p>Ron was the one to finally speak. Harry almost wished he hadn’t. “Lavender said Parvati said Seamus said that they left in a hurry,” Ron said under his breath. “Probably off to get some ‘<em>private tim</em>e’.” The words were said with no small amount of disdain.</p><p>“Your bookworm friend and her redheaded pal?” a voice cut through their conversation. Harry and Ron turned towards the portrait of the Fat Lady, who had clearly been shamelessly eavesdropping on their conversation. “They stopped by last night, disrupting my private reflection time,” she said with an annoyed sigh, “but for some reason, they didn’t want to go in. Left almost immediately.” She sniffed. “I’d check the Astronomy Tower. That’s usually where students go to… ahem,” she looked away, “<em>fornicate</em>.”</p><p>Harry and Ron flushed deep, matching shades of crimson. “Oh I <em>seriously</em> don’t want to think about that,” Harry mumbled under his breath. Ron seemed to turn red and then green (with sickness or with jealousy, Harry couldn't tell).</p><p>“They looked like they were going to… do <em>that</em>?” Ron asked in a disgruntled whisper.</p><p>The Fat Lady made a tittering, noncommittal sound. “The taller one led the bushy-haired one off by the hand, and they were speaking <em>very</em> quietly close together…” Her smile seemed to turn malicious. “I’ve seen this before, boys, and let me tell you: it’s no surprise that the whole school is talking about it.”</p><p>“They’re <em>what</em>?” Ron practically yelled. “The whole bloody <em>school</em> is talking about my sister and—” His voice choked off, as if he physically could not bring himself to utter the words. “I swear to Merlin when I see Hermione…”</p><p>“Don’t you think that’s a bit hypocritical?” Harry ventured timidly.</p><p>Ron whipped around on him. His eyes glinted angrily in the early morning light. “Did you say something?” he hissed.</p><p>Harry rolled his eyes. Ron was so immature, sometimes it was maddening. “I <em>said</em>,” he emphasized, “don’t you think that’s a bit hypocritical? You being angry at Hermione when you’re with Lavender, I mean.”</p><p>“No, it isn’t bloody ‘<em>hypocritical’</em>,” Ron sneered. “I can be as bloody angry as I want to, can’t I? I mean, Merlin, she’s <em>my</em> bloody girlfriend.”</p><p>“No, she isn’t,” Harry reminded him firmly. “She is <em>not</em> your girlfriend. You two broke up, though neither one of you will tell me why. And if I had to guess I'd say it was probably because — and I’m sorry about this Ron but, if past experience is anything to go by — it was <em>probably</em> because you were a prat. And you moved on rather quickly to someone else. Hermione was just barely out the door and you were off with some other girl.”</p><p>Ron turned crimson, the light tint of anger boiling over. “Now you’re defending her, are you?”</p><p>“Yeah, I guess I am. You’re being completely unfair to her. I love you, and I love Hermione, and you’re both like family to me, but you’re being a right prick about this whole thing. You can’t be pissy with her just because she’s found someone else, because if I remember correctly so have you.”</p><p>“I can’t believe you’re taking her side in all this.”</p><p>“I’m not taking <em>sides</em>!” Harry was quick to clarify. “I’m not siding with one of you over the other. I’m just saying that this is an unfair thing of you to do. I’m being perfectly neutral about the whole situation.”</p><p>“How <em>can</em> you be?” Ron yelled. They were beginning to draw a crowd. Harry shifted uncomfortably as a group of gawking second years loitered around, packing the sides of the corridor and staring at them with hungry curiosity. “How can you be neutral about this? My ex-girlfriend is messing about with my <em>sister</em>. That has to be like… against the law or something!”</p><p>“I’m pretty sure it isn’t—”</p><p>“And what about <em>you</em>?” Ron yelled, at this point desperate to gain an ally at whatever cost. “I thought you fancied Ginny!”</p><p>Harry blushed a little. “Well, I mean… I don’t know if <em>fancy</em> is the right word… certainly she’s very beautiful…”</p><p>Ron punched him on the shoulder, hard. “That’s my sister!”</p><p>“<em>Ow</em> Ron, what the hell? You brought it up!”</p><p>“Still… don’t talk about her like that!”</p><p>Harry shook his head. “I’m not talking to you about this again until you’ve calmed down. Why don’t you go for a fly or something? Or a run? Burn some steam off before you—”</p><p>Ron huffed and spun on his heel, effectively cutting Harry off abruptly. “I’m going to find them,” he stated with firm determination.</p><p>“You leave them alone!” Harry half-yelled, trailing after his friend. Ron ignored him, pushing his way through the group of chattering second years as if he didn’t even see them. “Ron, I mean it!” Harry tried again.</p><p>When Ron seemed absolutely determined to ignore Harry’s warning (his forward progress not even slowing), Harry took some drastic measures. He drew his wand and gave it one strong flick. Ron stumbled and crashed to the ground, his legs bound tightly with a rope that hadn’t been there moments before.</p><p>The second years stood frozen, gaping dumbly after witnessing the Boy Who Lived hex his best friend. Ron managed to flop himself onto his back, which gave him enough opportunity to not only glare at Harry, but also to pull out his own wand.</p><p>He growled and shot a stinging hex at Harry’s face, which was only narrowly blocked. Harry fired back a disarming spell that knocked Ron’s already prone body back a few dozen yards.</p><p>Ron let out a yell of fury, released his legs, and leapt to his feet. The hallway lit up with the bright explosions of firing hexes while students ran every which way for a professor or Prefect.</p><p>It was upon this scene that Professor McGonagall appeared only a few short minutes later, shocked, stunned, and more than a little disgruntled at what she was witnessing.</p><p>“Mr. Potter, Mr. Weasley… ENOUGH!” With a single wave of her own wand, both the boys were disarmed and frozen in place.</p><p>Harry and Ron panted, glaring at each other as their Head of House began to yell about “setting a poor example” and “hooligan behaviour.”</p><p>Ron had a bloody nose, and Harry had a large gash on his forehead that dripped blood down onto the left lens on his glasses, clouding his vision. Ron was also breaking out in a nasty case of what looked like chicken pox, while Harry’s wand arm was swollen to twice its normal size.</p><p>“You two are supposed to be <em>friends</em>! And you, Mr. Weasley, a <em>P</em><em>refect</em>!” McGonagall glowered at the pair of them. “You are <em>not</em> the students I expected to find <em>dueling</em> in the corridor on a Wednesday morning. Shame on the pair of you. And twenty-five points from Gryffindor, <em>each</em>.” The students that had gathered in the hallway to watch the duel groaned, and a few even muttered expletives under their breath at the two boys, who only continued to give each other sour looks.</p><p>McGonagall looked about ready to throw a fit. “My office. <em>Immediately</em>.” She ground out the last word through clenched teeth, and even if Harry and Ron had had control of their own bodies, they would not have dared disobey her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>“Now <em>what</em>,” McGonagall began when all three of them were seated awkwardly in her office, Harry and Ron steadfastly refusing to look at each other, “pray tell, were the two of you <em>thinking</em>, engaging in a duel like that outside of class where anyone could have walked by and been hit?” She glared at them from over her spectacles, and Harry wished more than anything that right in this moment he could sink into his chair and cease to exist. “Do you realize how <em>serious</em> this could have been?” McGonagall snapped. “Your foolish, childish, <em>immature</em> behavior has me in the mindset to relieve the <em>both</em> of you of your duties!”</p><p><em>That</em> got Harry and Ron’s attention the way nothing else could have.</p><p>“But… what do you mean, Professor?” Harry asked nervously, finally taking the time to wipe the blood from his glasses.</p><p>“I <em>mean</em>,” McGonagall said haughtily, looking down her nose at him as if he were something foul she had stepped in walking back from the Quidditch Pitch, “that perhaps you and Mr. Weasley are not mature enough to take on all of the responsibilities of being a Quidditch Captain and Prefect.” Ron and Harry turned pale. “Certainly such childish acts do not reflect highly on my and Professor Dumbledore’s assertions to the other staff members that, despite all of the hardships you both have faced throughout your lives, these leadership opportunities would allow you to <em>rise</em> to the occasion and <em>mature</em>. We assured the other Heads of House that you would not disappoint us, and that when situation demanded it you would both be willing to put the needs of other students over your own.” Harry and Ron stared down at their laps. “Clearly we were <em>wrong,</em>” McGonagall said coldly, eyeing the two young men before her. “Now what on <em>E</em><em>arth</em> gave you the idea that it would be okay to duel—?”</p><p>“Ron was going to do something I didn’t agree with,” Harry cut in quickly, hoping that that would be explanation enough.</p><p>McGonagall stared at him in utter disbelief. “Then, as I’m sure someone taught you in your primary education, Mr. Potter, it is appropriate to express one’s disapproval with <em>words</em>, like a <em>civilized</em> creature who has undergone five years of Muggle education and then an additional five and a half of <em>wizarding</em> education! Or have you forgotten the basis of humane interaction in the few months since you have turned sixteen?”</p><p>Harry blushed a deep crimson. “I did it for his own good, really. He was going to get into a fight with Hermione and Ginny and really he would have turned out a lot worse if that happened so I did him a favour. He should be thanking me.”</p><p>McGonagall blinked at him. “What do Ms. Granger and Ms. Weasley have to do with all of this?”</p><p>Ron glared down at his hands. Harry looked around the room uncomfortably.</p><p>“I believe,” a tired, calm voice said from the doorway, “that Harry is referring to Ms. Granger and Ms. Weasley’s new romantic relationship. Isn’t that right, Harry?”</p><p>Harry looked up into the eyes of the Headmaster he had barely seen in weeks. Ever since they had gone to meet Slughorn that summer, Dumbledore had been mysteriously and conspicuously absent from Harry’s life and studies — despite promises of private lessons and one-on-one meetings. Dumbledore looked older than he had a month ago, and tired, and very much like he hadn’t slept in a long time.</p><p>“How was your trip, Headmaster?” McGonagall asked, standing from behind her desk and giving Dumbledore a polite nod. He waved her back down.</p><p>“It was fine, Minerva, thank you.” He turned his sharp eyes to Harry and Ron. “Already getting in trouble again I see, Mr. Potter. I’ve only been gone a few days.” There was an amused twinkle in the Headmaster’s eye that made Harry believe he was <em>not</em> about to be yelled at. It was a small comfort.</p><p>“What is this about Ms. Granger and Ms. Weasley?” McGonagall asked.</p><p>“I believe Ronald here,” and with that Dumbledore laid his (healthy) hand upon Ron’s shoulder, causing the younger man to shift uncomfortably, “had a rather unfortunate reaction to the discovery that one of his best friends is dating his younger sister.”</p><p>McGonagall, to her credit, only let her eyebrows raise a hair, in the barest show of perfunctory curiosity. “An unfortunate reaction?” she questioned.</p><p>Dumbledore chuckled. “Something like that.” His hand tightened on Ron’s shoulder, imperceptible to anyone who was watching them, but enough for Ron to know that this was his warning: <em>Cut the shit, man up, and stop being an ignorant prick,</em> though perhaps not in those exact words. Either way, it was clear to Ron that Dumbledore was going to be keeping an eye on him. And that rarely ended out well.</p><p>“And Mr. Potter was…?”</p><p>“I believe he was defending his friend’s honour.” Dumbledore winked at Harry. “Or something akin to that.”</p><p>Harry nodded, his eyes still averted to his lap.</p><p>McGonagall eyed him shrewdly. “Five points to Gryffindor,” she said, so nonchalantly that if Ron’s head had not whipped up in disbelief at that exact moment, Harry may have thought he imagined it. “Now, both of you have a breakfast to attend.” She waved them away, and the two boys hastily stood and made for the door. “Go to the Hospital Wing first; we don’t need any young students getting sick in their morning porridge over the sight of you. And, boys?” She stopped them suddenly just as they were slipping from the room. “The next time I find the two of you mid-brawl, I will not be so kind. Now, get yourselves cleaned up. I expect you both in my class in one hour, <em>on time</em>.”</p><p align="center">**</p><p>“You got into a <em>fight</em>? With <em>Ron</em>?” Hermione gaped at him.</p><p>She had stormed down to the Quidditch pitch half an hour ago (Ron was pettily sitting practice out, pretending he was in bed sick so as not to face Harry or his sister or the team. Hermione wasn’t too bothered about this because it also meant <em>she</em> didn’t have to see him). She had stood outside of the changing tent, impatiently tapping her foot as player after player walked past her with little head tilts of greeting and acknowledgement. (When Ginny had exited — almost last — she had quirked an eyebrow at Hermione in question. <em>“You here to see me?”</em> she'd asked, but Hermione had shaken her head. <em>“Here to yell at Harry, actually.”</em> Ginny had chuckled and wished her luck).</p><p>Harry stood in front of her now, hair dirty and wild from his broom and an ugly red mark beneath his hairline that hadn’t totally healed yet. Hermione stared at him, lost for words, furious, and confused all at once. “Harry, why on <em>Earth</em> would you—?”</p><p>“He was being an <em>arse</em>, Hermione. You should have heard him. I couldn't just let him talk about you like that.”</p><p>“He’s your <em>best friend</em>, Harry, you shouldn’t have—”</p><p>“Yeah, well <em>you’re</em> my best friend too,” Harry cut her off quickly. “Everyone always expects me to take Ron’s side, you know? That’s always the way it goes. People think, ‘Oh Hermione and Ron are in a fight, guess she won’t talk to Harry either now’ and that’s messed up.”</p><p>Hermione stammered for a few moments, finally managing to let out a soft, emphatic, “<em>Harry</em>…” before she was silenced again.</p><p>Harry reached out and grabbed her hand and squeezed her fingers tightly. “Why didn’t you tell me about you and Ginny?” he asked her softly. “Did you… did you think I would be mad at you? That I wouldn’t…” He trailed off and seemed to clamor helplessly for words for several long seconds. “I know what the Muggle world’s like, Hermione,” he continued softly, almost in a whisper even though they were alone where they stood, outside in the crisp November air surrounded by golden trees and dying grass and cool wind. “I know that… that Muggles don’t exactly like relationships between—” a long pause and a shake of his head, “but I’m <em>different</em>, you know? I don’t care if you’re dating… if you’re…” he trailed off, blushing. “Boy we really don’t talk about this stuff, you and I, do we?”</p><p>Hermione smiled despite her teary eyes and shook her head ruefully. “No we don’t, but it’s sweet that you’re trying.” She pulled him into a tight hug. “Thank you.”</p><p>“You could have told me,” he whispered, and Hermione nodded against his cheek, still wrapped in his warm embrace.</p><p>“I know. I know I could have. I guess…” She trailed off. She didn’t want to lie to Harry, she <em>didn’t</em>, not when he was being so incredible and supportive and <em>fighting</em> <em>Ron</em> but… but she couldn’t have both of her best friends furious at her. She couldn’t have him lying to Ron, too. He wouldn't be able to keep it up. He wouldn't be able to even if he wanted to. And he definitely wouldn't want to. She couldn’t tell him that her whole relationship with Ginny wasn’t real. There wasn't a snowball's chance in hell.</p><p>So she tried to say as little as possible. “It was all so sudden,” she supplied weakly instead. “We didn’t really… we didn’t really <em>talk</em> about it, at first,” and she was glad her face was buried in his shoulder so he wouldn’t have to see her expression. She had always been a dreadful liar, and even though what she was saying was <em>technically</em> true, the deceit tasted foul on her tongue.</p><p>“I love you, Hermione, no matter what.” He squeezed her once more and took a step back and she was startled to see he had tears welling at the corners of his eyes just like she did. He shook himself. “I’m happy that you’re happy. I’m <em>not</em> happy that Ron is being a dick, but… but if Ginny makes you happy, then that’s all that I want. You’re my best friend,” he reiterated emphatically.</p><p>Hermione smiled and tried very hard to make it genuine, like the smile of a woman who was falling in love and not the smile of a woman who was standing in front of her best friend and fabricating a lesbian romance to get back at her ex.</p><p><em>God</em> she was a terrible person.</p><p>“Ginny’s lovely,” she said, to try and dodge the ‘as long as she makes you happy’ line that was glaring uncomfortably at her from the space and silence between them. “And she keeps me on my toes.”</p><p>Harry laughed and threw an arm around Hermione’s shoulders, leading her back into the castle. “Well, I should hope so; Ron and I lost us almost 50 house points in that fight and I wouldn’t want that to be for nothing.”</p><p>“You did <em>what</em>!?”</p><p>Harry grimaced and only looked at Hermione from the corner of his eye. He could still feel her glare, could practically <em>see</em> the steam billowing out of her ears. “McGonagall sort of… well…”</p><p>Hermione groaned. “Harry, you know I’m the <em>only</em> one who earns points during lessons! We’ll be behind for the rest of term!”</p><p>“What about that Philosopher’s Stone business? I got us points then!”</p><p>“That was <em>First Year</em>!” She pulled out from under his arm and started whacking him on the shoulder.</p><p>“Quidditch is points too, Hermione!” he shouted, laughing as he dodged her feeble blows.</p><p>She glared at him. “You lot and your bloody Quidditch! Quidditch isn’t the whole world. What about studying, what about <em>school</em>?”</p><p>“Ack — don’t hit me! I defended your honour!”</p><p>“I didn’t ask you to!”</p><p>“Ouch, Hermione, ouch!” Harry yelled but couldn’t fight the laughter bubbling inside of him. His protests were weak, his attempts to evade her half-hearted at best, and when the two of them finally made it into the castle (even though Harry was rubbing ruefully at his sore shoulder), Hermione was wind-swept and grinning, tucked happily under Harry’s arm, and so he found he was quite proud of himself. He would let her admonish him until she went blue in the face, so long as she smiled at the end.</p><p>Ron was a real prat, and sometimes a shite best friend, but Harry would try his damndest to make up for that.</p><p>Plus, Hermione had spent the past 6 years editing his terrible essays, so… he figured the least he could do was make her smile.</p><p align="center">**</p><p>They had been at it for one week.</p><p>If Ginny was being honest (and even <em>she</em> knew she didn’t have the greatest track record of truth-telling), this whole ‘fake dating’ thing was turning out to be a lot… <em>easier</em> than she expected. It wasn’t very much of a leap — in terms of personal interaction between her and Hermione, at least — from friends to more-than-friends. Really the only significant difference was the light, brushing kisses they exchanged every so often (truthfully more <em>often</em> than ‘so often’).</p><p>And fuck it all if Ginny wasn’t absolutely <em>delighted</em> by it. She loved kissing Hermione. She'd never admit it out loud, of course, lest she risk sounding desperate — it <em>had</em> been a while since she'd dated anyone, and she found she'd rather missed physical intimacy — but Hermione’s lips were always so soft and she always smelled like the best shampoo in the world and Ginny kept having to shake herself, and shout reminders in her mind that she wasn’t <em>really</em> supposed to be enjoying this as much as she was. She was doing this for Hermione, not for herself.</p><p>Still, she found herself searching for excuses to touch and kiss Hermione whenever she could. She felt like she was being horribly transparent but if she was, Hermione never called her on it. She was either <em>very</em> lucky or had a very polite best friend.</p><p>She wasn’t sure which was worse.</p><p>Kissing wasn’t that big of a deal, anyway. And it wasn’t <em>really</em> kissing… there were no tongues involved, no grasping hands, no heavy breaths and shaking fingers and unbuttoned clothes, but… <em>But</em>. But Ginny couldn’t help but think about that, about shaking fingers and heavy breaths and unbuttoned clothes and grasping hands and tongues and <em>Hermione</em> and—</p><p>And she was in trouble. Plain and simple.</p><p>Kissing Hermione wasn’t crazy or strange or different. Perhaps that was the problem. It didn’t send shivers down her spine or cause fireworks to explode behind her eyes.</p><p>But it made her want <em>more</em>. And she felt that that was probably much more dangerous.</p><p>And Ginny had kissed a fair number of people — boyfriends and platonic friends after a little too much to drink and boys and girls and people who she cared deeply for and people who she really didn’t know at all — but none of them had ever made her <em>want</em> the way that Hermione made her want for… for what? What <em>did</em> she want? She didn’t even know.</p><p>But it was something.</p><p>And that scared her.</p><p>Ginny slumped down in the armchair next to Hermione’s, tired and a little sweaty and cheeks red form the wind of the pitch.</p><p>Hermione looked up from her book and smiled. Ginny’s stomach flipped but she pushed it down. “I’m starved.”</p><p>Hermione glanced down at her watch and started. “Goodness, is it already six?”</p><p>“How long have you been sitting here?”</p><p>“Must be about five hours, now.” Ginny’s eyes widened and Hermione blushed, looking down at her hands, “I guess I lost track of time.”</p><p>“Well come on then,” Ginny leapt from her seat and held a hand out for Hermione to grab, “we’ve got to make sure you’re well fed. Can’t be the brightest witch of your age if you’re collapsing from hunger pains and exhaustion.”</p><p>Hermione laughed but allowed Ginny to drag her to her feet. “You’re only saying that so I’ll eat dinner with you.”</p><p>“I don’t like to eat alone.”</p><p>Hermione rolled her eyes. “Neville and Luna are wonderful company.”</p><p>“Neville and Luna are <em>interesting</em> company, Hermione. I don’t know if I’d say ‘wonderful’.”</p><p>Hermione scoffed as they climbed through the portrait hole. “Nonsense, they’re your best friends.”</p><p>“Excuse you, I believe <em>you</em> hold that honour.”</p><p>“It isn’t a competition. You can have more than one best friend. Just look at me and—” She cut herself off abruptly, and the awkward silence, the heavy words left unsaid between them caused Ginny to shift and glance to the side.</p><p>“Ron will come around, Hermione,” she said quietly.</p><p>Hermione sighed and slipped her fingers between Ginny’s own, lacing their hands together tightly. “I hope so. I hate not talking to him.”</p><p>Ginny felt something sink in her stomach, but then again the staircase they were on <em>had</em> just decided to spring forward and propel them downwards, so she ignored the feeling. “You really miss him, don’t you?”</p><p>Hermione looked off to the side, watching the floors slip by them as they were lowered towards the ground floor. “He’s one of my best friends.”</p><p>Ginny nodded and squeezed Hermione’s fingers but said no more. She didn’t know what to say. She didn’t know if she could come up with anything decent enough to lift Hermione’s spirits.</p><p>So she didn’t say anything. Instead, she watched the people in the paintings on the wall walk around talking to each other. They were sword fighting, arguing, gambling, and otherwise paying the two of them no mind. Though in fairness, the portraits rarely paid attention to the students who walked in front of them.</p><p>Ginny wondered how it would feel, to be a painting. It must be incredibly dull. But then again, did the paintings <em>know</em> they were paintings? Did they know time and boredom like living beings? Did they stare out from their frames and long to be alive again?</p><p>Certainly they didn’t feel the pressures of regular humanity, of school and Quidditch and House Cups and pretending to date your best friend to annoy your brother. Certainly they didn’t know familial pressure like Ginny did; after all, she was the youngest — and last — Weasley to go through Hogwarts (until her brothers started having children, at least, and she found <em>that</em> unlikely for at least the near future). Charlie and Fred and George were all amazing Quidditch players while they were at Hogwarts; Percy and Bill were Head Boy their seventh year; after graduation all of her brothers had gone on to amazing careers, for Merlin’s sake. Charlie was in Romania studying and caring for dragons, Bill worked at the largest wizarding bank in England, Fred and George had started their own business to monstrous success, and even Percy (the git) worked for the Ministry of Magic. Even Ron, goddamn him, was a decent enough Quidditch player (when he didn’t think about it) and was best friends with the Boy Who Lived.</p><p>What was Ginny supposed to do? How was she supposed to keep up with that legacy? How was she — the youngest girl in a family of boys — supposed to make her parents proud?</p><p>She sighed a heavy sigh and Hermione squeezed her hand just slightly. Ginny looked to her friend’s face; it was a little sad around the eyes but otherwise perfectly expressionless. Hermione looked like, for once in her life, her head wasn’t filled with spinning and whirling ideas. Ginny’s eyes traced the shape of her nose, the curve of her lips, studied the colour in her cheeks and realized — with perhaps more surprise than she should have — that Hermione was <em>beautiful</em>.</p><p>“Thank you,” she said suddenly, breaking Hermione out of her comfortable silence.</p><p>They were approaching the Great Hall now, and Hermione paused to turn, puzzled, and gazed at Ginny’s unreadable expression. “For what?”</p><p>Ginny shrugged. “I’m kind of mad; I know that about myself. I’m not the easiest person to be friends with. So thank you, for… being my friend.”</p><p>Hermione smiled and pulled her forward to get some dinner. Ginny found that she didn’t mind being dragged around by Hermione in the slightest.</p><p align="center">**</p><p>Hermione was biting her lower lip, her leg shaking and pulsing with poorly-disguised nervousness. She picked at a bit of dried skin on the nail of her right thumb and tried desperately to work up an appetite.</p><p>A body slid into the empty space across from her and Hermione looked up, her expression softening considerably when she recognized the blinking blue eyes and flowing blonde hair of Luna Lovegood, sporting a ridiculous lion hat that really should surprise Hermione more than it does.</p><p>“Hello, Luna,” she said, her teeth abandoning her lip and her hand grasping for her fork. She really should eat something, she recognized this, but she was just so… what even was she feeling? Nervous? Excited? Scared?</p><p>“Hello, Hermione. You look lovely today.”</p><p>Hermione couldn’t help the startled expression that took over her face. She glanced down at her outfit — certainly nothing special — but managed a croaked, “Thanks, Luna,” either way.</p><p>Luna nodded and piled some food on her plate. Hermione scrambled around in her head for something — <em>anything</em> — to talk about, but Luna (perhaps subconsciously) came to her rescue. “You seem nervous today,” she said in that breathy way of hers, her words practically floating away from her.</p><p>“Do I?” Hermione asked, feigning ignorance. She knew she wasn’t fooling anyone.</p><p>“Yes, I imagine the first match of the year must be stressful for you.”</p><p>“And why is that?”</p><p>“Well…” Luna paused to take a large drink from her goblet, “Ron and Harry and Ginny are all playing. Your ex-boyfriend and best friend and girlfriend, all flying about on brooms hundreds of feet in the air with seven people trying to knock them off, hitting balls at them and otherwise—”</p><p>“No Luna, you’re quite right, I suppose I am nervous,” Hermione attempted to cut her off quickly, feeling herself get a little queasy. “God, why do they all have to play bloody Quidditch?”</p><p>“I like Quidditch,” Luna said dreamily, playing with the mane on her lion’s head hat, “I think organized sports are wonderful.”</p><p>“And dangerous,” Hermione muttered and Luna hummed in agreement.</p><p>“Yes, I suppose that too.”</p><p>Hermione found words spilling from her mouth quite of their own volition and certainly without her permission. “And every year,” she huffed stubbornly, “another one of them goes and gets on that bloody team and now it’s just me, in the stands, watching them try to kill each other every damned game and there isn’t even anyone I can… I can watch with.”</p><p>Luna smiled at her (Hermione wondered what exactly about her previous statement could have prompted a smile from Luna — but then again she’s never been the most predictable of people) and said, “You can watch with me and Neville, Hermione. We’ll shout the loudest whenever they do something well.”</p><p>Hermione smiled, perhaps in spite of herself. “I think I would like that very much.”</p><p>Luna nodded. “Good. I don’t want Hufflepuff to win this game.”</p><p>“Shouldn’t you, though? I mean, Hufflepuff isn’t as good as the Gryffindor team, you know, and so… logically you should want to root for the team that is statistically the least likely to beat your own team. Ravenclaw will probably trounce Hufflepuff in their upcoming match, and Gryffindor will be much tougher competition.”</p><p>Luna smiled at her again and Hermione <em>really</em> couldn’t understand what she was smiling so often about. “Quidditch isn’t all about facts and statistics, Hermione. It’s about House spirit. Besides, I don’t have any friends in Hufflepuff. I’d much rather if my friends won.”</p><p>“Well that doesn’t make any sense,” Hermione grumbled.</p><p>“Most things don’t make any sense at all, Hermione.”</p><p>Hermione blinked across the table as her friend went back to her food and wondered, silently (not for the first <em>or</em> last time), just exactly how wise Luna was under her confusing ‘imaginary magical creatures’ façade. Hermione made a note in her head to stop judging Luna so harshly by standards which she clearly did not prescribe to.</p><p>Hermione made a note to stop trying to fit everyone into the perfect little boxes in her head.</p><p>Starting with Luna, and Neville, and Ron even, and Ginny…</p><p>And Ginny. Ginny could never fit into just one category in her head. She was a gifted witch, an excellent charms caster, the youngest child and only girl in a huge family of brothers, a Quidditch player, a brilliant woman, a friend, a fake girlfriend…</p><p>No, Hermione was sure of it, she would work harder to shuck labels. After all, real people weren’t one-dimensional like those women in those horrible books Lavender and Parvati were always giggling about behind the canopy of their beds in the dorm. Real people were… they were more.</p><p>Luna was more than “Looney.” Ginny was more than—</p><p>“Are you sitting with us at the match, Hermione?” Neville asked loudly as he slumped into the seat next to her. Hermione jumped and whipped around to face him. He was grinning at her, his face painted crimson and gold, and Hermione had to shake herself and blink a few times before she could smile sincerely.</p><p>“Yes; Luna invited me.”</p><p>Neville smiled and rubbed his hands together before grabbing for the nearest dishes of food. “Excellent. We’re going to destroy Hufflepuff today, I just know it.”</p><p>Luna beamed at him. “We certainly will.”</p><p>“You excited to cheer on your girl?” Neville asked around his mouthful of sausage.</p><p>Hermione opened her mouth to respond, but Luna cut in before she could, saying, “Oh, Hermione is nervous about today. She doesn’t want Ginny to get hurt.”</p><p>Hermione flushed despite her protesting mind. She spluttered for words but didn’t need them. “That’s very sweet,” Neville said, reaching for the bacon to his far right. He smiled over his shoulder at her. “I don’t think you have anything to worry about. Ginny’s brilliant, she really is. Everyone’s been talking about it recently. I heard McGonagall say that if she keeps it up for the next few years she might even be able to go pro.”</p><p>Hermione’s mouth dropped open. “McGonagall said <em>what</em>?”</p><p>Neville winked conspiratorially at her. “You didn’t hear it from me.” He stuffed some more food into his mouth as Hermione tried to recover from her shock. She had no clue Ginny was <em>that</em> good at Quidditch. “McGonagall doesn’t want to tell her until it’s more of a sure thing. After all, she’s still young; she’s only, what, sixteen?” Hermione nodded. “Still, don’t be surprised if there are some scouts here her final year. Ginny’s a brilliant Quidditch player, and she doesn’t really know what she wants to do after school ends, so she’s the perfect choice for recruiting.”</p><p>“I... I didn’t know.”</p><p>“Yes, well,” Neville shrugged, “<em>she</em> doesn’t even know, so…” He glanced down at his watch. “Damn, we better go if we want to get good seats.”</p><p>Sure enough, the Great Hall was emptying around them. Students were clearing out from every table, wearing red and gold and yellow and black and chattering as they streamed down towards the pitch.</p><p>Neville wiped his lips, stood from the table, and clapped his hands together, rubbing them excitedly. “Shall we?”</p><p>Hermione stood too, still reeling from the revelation that Ginny — <em>Ginny Weasley</em> — was apparently well in line to become a professional Quidditch player when she graduated Hogwarts.</p><p>How did she not know Ginny was that good?</p><p>Hermione made a note to pay closer attention.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Ron did so poorly in the match that they almost lost — and without Ginny and Harry they certainly would have. It was a tense 90 minutes. With every goal that slipped past Ron’s extended arms Hermione could see him getting more and more upset, more and more frustrated with himself. He started yelling at the team only twenty minutes in; Beaters and Chasers and even Harry were all subject to his scathing abuse. (Although Harry, because he was so level-headed and perfectly composed, was able to completely ignore the fuming Ron — something Hermione admired him endlessly for, as it was no easy feat.)</p><p>Ron yelled the loudest at Ginny, and Hermione was absolutely <em>fuming</em> because of it. She ground her teeth as his harsh voice sounded over a chorus of groans from the red and gold wearing Gryffindor fans. “Come on Ginny, keep your head up!” he screamed, and Hermione — without even realizing it — reached for her wand.</p><p>Luna’s steadying hand on her arm stopped her. “I think even a lousy Keeper is better than no Keeper, Hermione,” she said softly out of the side of her mouth.</p><p>Hermione huffed but she knew Luna was right. “He might as <em>well</em> not even be there. He hasn’t done anything all match. And where does he get off, tearing into Ginny like that?”</p><p>“Well… I would imagine he feels his masculinity is threatened,” Luna responded without taking her eyes from the zooming players overhead. “His ex-girlfriend is dating his sister, so I imagine some people have been teasing him, and now he’s playing an absolutely dreadful match of Quidditch, which can’t be very exciting on top of it. You can’t really expect different from him.”</p><p>Hermione <em>knew</em> Luna was right but she couldn’t help but feel the righteous indignation well inside of her when, upon witnessing Ginny score (her eighth point of the match), Ron screamed, “You need to be faster, Ginny!”</p><p>But Ginny — marvelous, marvelous Ginny — valiantly refused to respond to any of Ron’s ‘critiques’. With every shouted insult she seemed to grow stronger and more sure of herself, faster with the quaffle and more daring with her shots, and it was <em>paying off</em>. Despite Ron missing nearly every single shot that came his way, Ginny was almost single-handedly keeping Gryffindor above water.</p><p>They were only trailing Hufflepuff by around thirty points when Ginny — in her first mistake of the match — lost the quaffle to Ernie McMillan.</p><p>Even playing a brilliant game of Quidditch could only subdue Ginny’s own explosive temper for so long. When, moments after her fumble, Ron screeched, red in the face, “Ginny! Shape up! We’re losing because of you!” Hermione saw Ginny snap.</p><p>She whirled around on her broom, expression murderous and eyes blazing as they caught the reflected light of the sun off the lake. She opened her mouth and reached for the place in her robes where Hermione <em>knew</em> she kept her wand.</p><p>Hermione looked around frantically, hoping that someone else had noticed the fight that was about to break out on the pitch.</p><p>Luckily Harry had.</p><p>“Time out!” He shouted. When the whistle didn’t sound immediately he flew as fast as he could towards Madame Hooch. “Time out!” he called again, waving his arms in front of him as he approached her with break-neck speed. This time, she noticed.</p><p>“Ninety seconds, time out called by Gryffindor!” Madame Hooch boomed and blew her whistle in three short, loud bursts.</p><p><em>“And it looks like Harry Potter has called a time out,” </em>the announcer’s voice echoed across the stadium. <em>“Very rare in a game of Quidditch. Usually teams like to play out the game with no interruptions, so this is certainly an… <strong>interesting</strong> strategy. But unsurprising, considering the tension currently fizzling between Potter’s team, specifically the two Weasley siblings, who seem <strong>incapable</strong> of working together in this rapidly disintegrating game. Ginny Weasley has had one of the best games of her life, while Ron has been giving a less-than-stellar performance…” </em>his voice continued but the Gryffindor team paid him no attention.</p><p>The seven of them landed on the ground in seconds.</p><p>Ginny gripped her broom in one hand and stalked towards Ron, who stood farthest from her out of any of them, his fists and jaw clenched, eyes trained on his muddy boots. “You filthy prat,” she hissed, rapidly approaching her brother, “if it weren’t for you—”</p><p>Harry caught her around her upper arm and pulled her to a stop before she could say anything more. “Cool it, Gin,” he warned in a low voice.</p><p>Ginny ignored him. “You’re such a dick,” she growled at her brother, but Ron just glared at her and didn’t say a word. “What, now that we’re down on the ground you’re not screaming at me? Now that I can yell back, you don’t have anything you want to say?” He sneered. She scoffed. “Some big man you are, can’t even block the <em>fucking</em> goals.”</p><p>“Ginny, I’m serious,” Harry tried again in a low, steady voice, his hand tightening around her upper arm in a wordless warning.</p><p>Ginny yanked away from him and took another step towards Ron. “If you say <em>one</em> more thing about my flying I’m going to—”</p><p>“What, steal my girlfriend again?” Ron cut in with an angry snarl to his words.</p><p>Ginny lunged at him but was caught immediately by Harry and Demelza. Ron took a stumbling step backwards.</p><p>“Ginny! Off, now!” Harry yelled, yanking her back and away from Ron.</p><p>She stared at him in outrage, mouth agape and face rapidly turning red. “Harry you <em>can’t</em> just—”</p><p>“I can and I will.” He commanded, pointing to the changing tents. “Off the pitch. Demelza, you’re on. Grab a broom.”</p><p>Ginny glared at Harry, fighting the urge to scream and tear her hair out. She stared at him for several long moments but knew, instinctively, that he was not changing his mind.</p><p>She growled, threw her broom to the ground and stormed off and away from the huddle, tearing her gloves from her hands as she stalked into the changing rooms without so much as a glance behind her.</p><p align="center">~~</p><p>“Why would he <em>do</em> that?” Hermione muttered indignantly. “She’s been the best one out there today, and it wasn’t <em>her</em> fault. Ron was baiting her…”</p><p>Neville shook his head. “They have two alternate Chasers and no alternate Keeper. Harry can’t just kick <em>Ron</em> off the pitch, no matter how much he may want to,” he said sympathetically. “We can maybe win with another Chaser, if he can get the snitch quick enough, but without a Keeper… we’re toast.”</p><p><em>“And it looks like Potter has sent Weasley off the pitch! That’s the <strong>female</strong> Weasley, to all of you not watching. Seems the tension got too great for the Gryffindor team to battle through. This rattled defense is taking a <strong>beating </strong>from an altogether well-rounded Hufflepuff squad. This substitution is a strange move on Potter’s part, considering Weasley — the female Weasley, again — has been Gryffindor’s top goal-scorer of the day, but I suppose he thought he had to do <strong>something</strong> to separate the two siblings. One can only wonder how bad their ongoing feud must be, to cause the captain of the team to throw one of them out of the game — <strong>especially</strong> such a pivotal player as Weasley… again I’m referring to the <strong>female</strong> Weasley, as Ron has frankly failed to wow </em>anyone<em> with his performance today…”</em></p><p>Hermione stood. “I’m going to find Ginny.”</p><p>“Yeah, yeah totally.” Neville stood quickly to allow her to pass him. “Tell her we’re both sorry, yeah?” He glanced down next to him at Luna, who looked like she didn’t even realize the teams had stopped playing. “We’ll let you know how the match turns out.”</p><p>Hermione nodded and slipped out from next to him, hurrying past the muttering and mutinous Gryffindor crowd. As Ginny had disappeared off the pitch, a few scattered “<em>boo’s</em>” had overtaken the Gryffindor section, with a few of the older students even yelling obscenities at the notion of one of their best players not being allowed to finish the match.</p><p>From across the pitch a collection of Slytherin students had started up a chorus of “Weasley is Our King” that Hermione was determined to <em>not</em> listen to. The words, however, pierced her mind of their own volition.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>“Weasley cannot save a thing,<br/></em>
  <em>He always ruins everything.<br/></em>
  <em>That’s why Slytherins all sing,<br/></em>
  <em>Weasley is our King!...”</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>Hermione shut the sound out and raced out of the stadium and towards the entrance to the changing tent. She heard three sharp blows from Madame Hooch’s whistle and knew the game must have picked back up, to the jeering of Hufflepuff and Slytherin students alike, annoyed at the unusual delay of game, and to the pained moans of the Gryffindors, now almost certain of an impending loss.</p><p>As she got closer to the tent, she heard the growing sounds of Ginny rampaging inside.</p><p>“Fuck!” Ginny’s voice seeped out of the tent, followed by a loud ‘<em>smack’</em> that had Hermione rushing inside. “Fuck fuck <em>fuck</em>!” Ginny screamed, accenting each word by smashing her fist into the wooden door of an open locker.</p><p>She shouted incoherently and tore the contents from their place inside the cubby, dashing them across the ground.</p><p>“Goddamn it!” She punched the door again, so hard it splintered down the middle.</p><p>“Ginny, stop.” Hermione implored calmly, taking a step forwards and towards the girl who now stood in the middle of the room, completely out of breath and gripping her swollen, red hand.</p><p>Ginny whipped around on her, and the fire glowing behind her eyes was enough to make Hermione’s steps falter.</p><p>But just like that the fire was gone, and Ginny’s expression slipped from fury to one of pained confusion. “What are you doing here, Hermione?”</p><p>“I was worried about you. And rightly so.” Hermione took a step forward and took Ginny’s hand lightly in hers. Ginny hissed in pain as Hermione’s fingers prodded the inflamed area of her protruding knuckles. “What have you done to your hand?”</p><p>Ginny scoffed. “You should see the other guy.”</p><p>Hermione glanced pointedly behind Ginny’s shoulder at the cracked door. “I <em>can</em> see the other guy. Frankly I’d say you’re both faring about the same.” She pulled her wand out and started running the tip over Ginny’s hand. “I think you’ve broken your knuckles.”</p><p>“Excellent,” Ginny grumbled, but even as she said it, the pain was slowly slipping away from her hand, replaced by a cool tingling that felt like a soothing liquid balm expanding from the injured part of her hand and seeping up her wrist to her shoulder.</p><p>In a few seconds her hand looked much better — not perfect, and still faintly bruised, but certainly better. She flexed her fingers experimentally and felt hardly a twinge. She blinked down at Hermione. “That was… where did you learn how to do that?”</p><p>“It’s amazing what you can learn when you read, isn’t it?” Hermione answered with an edge to her voice that gave Ginny pause. Hermione was still staring down at Ginny’s hand, refusing to meet her eyes.</p><p>Ginny pursed her lips and asked quietly, “Are you angry with me?”</p><p>Hermione sighed and pointed her wand at the fractured locker. “Repairo,” she muttered, and the locker seemed to sew itself back together, the wood fragments weaving tight until Ginny could no longer tell that it had ever been broken. “I’m not angry with you,” Hermione finally answered. “Although I don’t think you should have gone around punching things until you broke your hand.”</p><p>“Better the wood than Ron’s face,” Ginny grumbled.</p><p>Hermione half-chuckled. “You don’t actually believe that.”</p><p>“You’re right, I don’t. He was being such a… such a…” She struggled to find a word adequately filthy enough to describe the scum Ron was, but she didn’t really get the chance, because Hermione’s soft voice and gentle, understanding nodding drained her mind of obscenities.</p><p>“I know. I’m furious that Harry sent you off and not him. You didn’t deserve it.” Ginny felt something akin to pride and pleasure swelling below the surface of her chest. It felt <em>good</em> to be vindicated. “You were brilliant, by the way,” Hermione continued, and Ginny hadn’t even really noticed until now, but Hermione still held her hand in both of hers. “Even with Ron being… well, being a right git. You were wonderful out there. I didn’t… I didn’t even know…” Hermione looked up then, and directly into Ginny’s eyes.</p><p>Something inside Ginny’s chest clenched.</p><p>Ginny flushed and swallowed thickly, acutely aware of the fact that Hermione still had a loose grip on her fingers. “Thanks,” she practically whispered. She was looking into Hermione’s eyes and could not look away. Hermione glanced down (at her lips?) and Ginny felt her stomach swoop. She leaned forwards just slightly, almost imperceptibly, and Hermione’s eyes fluttered closed and she wondered, thrillingly, if they were about to… if Hermione was going to let her…</p><p>“How <em>dare</em> you?” someone shrieked from near the entrance.</p><p>Ginny and Hermione leapt apart as if they’d been cursed.</p><p>Lavender stood in the opening, backlit by the bright afternoon sun and hair flying in the wind, looking as deranged as she did indignant. Ginny and Hermione exchanged a look which went unnoticed by their most unwelcome companion.</p><p>“How dare you sit in here acting like nothing is wrong?” Lavender stalked forwards, glaring alternatively between Ginny and Hermione, as if she couldn’t decide at whom to direct her ire. “Poor Ronnie is out there getting clobbered and it’s all your fault!”</p><p>Ginny glanced again at Hermione. “Umm… whose fault is it, exactly?”</p><p>“Her! You! <em>Both</em> of you!” Lavender screeched. “You and your… your <em>dyke</em> drama is distracting poor Ron from playing his best! I can’t even believe Harry even let <em>you</em> on the team,” she directed at Ginny, “and <em>you</em>,” she shot, pointing at Hermione. Ginny took a reflexive step in front of her. “How <em>dare</em> you sleep with your ex-boyfriend’s sister? Do you have no <em>shame</em>?”</p><p>“You can’t just speak to her—” Ginny started indignantly, but Hermione laid a hand on her shoulder, effectively silencing her.</p><p>Hermione arched an eyebrow and looked at Lavender coolly. “You’d think, since <em>Ronnie</em> has a new girlfriend and all, that he couldn’t <em>possibly</em> be distracted by his ex and her girlfriend. I mean, all thing’s considered, since he’s moved on so <em>effectively</em>, who I choose to have a relationship with or not is frankly none of his concern.” Lavender’s nostrils flared. “I wonder why it seems to matter to him… why it seems to matter to <em>you</em>, either. Unless, perhaps… you’re more jealous and insecure than you want <em>Ronnie</em> to know?”</p><p>Lavender flushed a furious shade of red and gasped for words like a fish gasping in open air. “Why how dare you—?””</p><p>“Yes, how <em>dare</em> I,” Hermione said, voice still calm and even, “I seem to be be doing quite the daring feats today, don’t I Gin?”</p><p>Ginny nodded. “Apparently so.”</p><p>Lavender opened her mouth, and probably <em>would</em> have said something more (perhaps curses, perhaps insults, Ginny and Hermione would never know) when the final whistle blew and the crowd outside roared.</p><p>
  <em>“And Potter has caught the snitch! 150 points to Gryffindor! A tough game for Potter and the Lions, barely eking out a win, 240-200 in their favour. I tell you, without the youngest Weasley early in the match and Potter’s superb and veteran flying skills, this one would surely have gone to Hufflepuff…”</em>
</p><p>Ginny spoke over the rest of the announcements. “Better clear out of here, Lavender. You’re not allowed in unless you’re on the team.”</p><p>Lavender huffed and turned on her heel, storming out (she did not comment on the fact that <em>Hermione</em> wasn’t a player, either; but perhaps that was because she was too furious to notice, or perhaps because she wanted the excuse to escape as much as Ginny and Hermione wanted her to leave them be).</p><p>“I should go too,” Hermione whispered, and Ginny turned around, the air between them suddenly thick again, charged with things unsaid.</p><p>Ginny nodded. “Yeah. Yeah I’ll… I’ll catch you after?” Her eyes locked onto Hermione’s, and the energy that sparked in the air between them was enough to make the hair on Ginny’s arms stand on end.</p><p>Hermione nodded and smiled. “Try not to kill Ron in the meantime, will you?”</p><p>Ginny shrugged and laughed, and whatever strange tension there had been dissipated easily (which she was very thankful for). “No promises.”</p><p>Hermione smiled and slipped into Ginny’s arms, giving her a tight — but brief — embrace. “I <em>am</em> sorry about today.”</p><p>“We won. It’s no big deal.” But she was lying, and Hermione knew that too.</p><p>She pulled away and gave Ginny a sympathetic look. “I’ll meet you outside.”</p><p>“Watch out for Lavender. She could be waiting to ambush you.” Ginny half-teased.</p><p>“Yes, well I’d like to see her try.”</p><p>Hermione slipped out of the tent just as the rest of the team filed in. Demelza shot her a tight, apologetic smile which Ginny did her best to return. Katie Bell walked in behind her and handed Ginny her broom which she had — unwittingly — left behind in her desire to storm off the pitch. “You played well today, Gin,” Katie said quietly as Peakes and Coote stumbled in, talking loudly and riding the high of their first win on the Gryffindor team — seemingly unaware of the silence engulfing the other players. “But I’m sorry about what happened.”</p><p>Ginny shrugged and took her broom back, smiling gratefully. “It isn’t your fault. And besides, he was yelling at you too.”</p><p>“Not as much,” Katie argued quietly, and Ginny silently agreed.</p><p>Ron pushed in last, refusing to meet anyone’s gaze (though they all stared in his direction), choosing instead to throw himself down on the bench and tear at his gear with unbridled fury.</p><p>Ginny glared at him but didn’t say anything.</p><p>There was a tap on her shoulder and she turned, coming face to face with Harry — who she was still pretty furious at, too, mind you. But he looked at her with such a helpless expression that she found her anger slipping down and away.</p><p>“I’m <em>sorry</em>, Ginny,” he said, and she shrugged, turning away form him to strip herself of her uniform.</p><p>“Don’t worry about it, Harry.”</p><p>“Gin, you’re one of our best Chasers. You <em>know</em> that I wouldn’t have… if there was <em>any</em> other way…”</p><p>“It’s fine, Harry; he’s your best friend. I get it.” She threw her pads in her locker and slammed the door shut (just because she wasn’t <em>as</em> angry at him as she could have been didn’t mean she wasn’t still peeved).</p><p>“No, hey now.” He grabbed her arm and turned her around gently. “I didn’t do any of this because Ron’s my friend, because frankly,” he whispered the next part, “he’s been a garbage friend to me and you and Hermione recently. It’s just…” he looked distressed again, “we don’t have a backup Keeper. I couldn’t just… <em>toss</em> him.”</p><p>Ginny sighed and placed her hand on top of Harry’s. She squeezed it, once. “I know, Harry. I get it.” He smiled a small, tight smile, but she was quick to add, “But just because I understand doesn’t mean that I’m not still mad at you. Because I <em>am</em> still mad at you. And him,” she gestured towards Ron’s slumped form with her head, “so let me be mad at you for a bit, yeah?”</p><p>Harry breathed a sigh of relief and took a step back. “I guess that’s all I can ask for.” There was a short pause. “You really were incredible today. Keep up the good work.”</p><p>She smiled, and this time it was a good bit sincerer. “Thanks, Harry.”</p><p>He nodded and turned to the room at large. He cleared his throat and knocked the end of his broom against one of the wooden benches a few times, drawing the eyes of the entire team to his tower figure. “I’ll not give a speech today. It’s been… it was a pretty rough game, as you all know. Even though we won, I wouldn’t consider this a victory. So… go back to the dorms, eat some food, take a bath, and we’ll talk more strategy on Monday at practice. Four o’clock; don’t be late.”</p><p>There were murmurs of “Yes Harry” and “You got it” before the players began to dissipate.</p><p>By the time Ginny had pulled her robes back over her head, Ron was gone, and she breathed a sigh of relief. She really didn’t know what she was going to do about him. Any time they could manage to avoid each other was time well spent, in Ginny’s opinion</p><p>She also didn’t know what she was going to do about Hermione but that… that was <em>much</em> more complicated. And she really didn’t have the energy to think about it today. So she shoved it into the back of her mind and pretended like she would address it eventually.</p><p align="center">**</p>
