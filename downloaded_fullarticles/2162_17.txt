          <div class="userstuff"><p>"Come in, come in! I actually didn't expect you to come--"</p><p>"Shut up, old man." </p><p>"...Your manner still astounds me, my b--"</p><p>"I dare you to finish that."</p><p>"...."</p><p>"Precisely."</p><p>"My--... would you like a cup of tea?"</p><p>"Please."</p><p>"It will take a while, please, have a seat."</p><p>"I thought you were a wizard, not a muggle. Why is the kettle on a <i>fire</i>?"</p><p>"Why the tea's better that way. Haven't you heard? Magic disrupts the taste of food."</p><p>"Then why do House-elves make Hogwarts food?"</p><p>"Because they do it with muggle means, of course!"</p><p>"...."</p><p>"We don't need to sit here all day and stare at one another. We can be adults and converse."</p><p>"*You* were the one who called me in, you senile old fool."<br/>
"Oh, do you hear that? I think the kettle's whistling. Tea?"</p><p>"<i>Please.</i>"</p><p>"A dash of Milk? A cube of Sugar?"<br/>
"Just sugar is fine--what in the name of Merlin are you doing?! Are you such a muggle-lover that you would commit such a heinous crime?! Adding milk before the tea?!"</p><p>"Well, of course, it should be done this way! How else if not? Now, how much sugar would you like?"<br/>
"Four cubes."</p><p>"A-are you sure? Surely you would like less?"</p><p>"Four cubes. As a certain person would love to say: 'black as my soul, and sweet as sin.' Although they prefer coffee over tea, an anomaly I would never understand."</p><p>"That I agree with. Your tea."<br/>
---<br/>
"Must you do that with my tea? I would never poison you, especially not here."</p><p>"I wouldn't chance it with you, especially not when you added milk <i>before</i> the tea. .... This tea is so sweet."</p><p>"Well, I did ask if you would like less sugar. Now my tea is too bitter. I usually take it with seven cubes, and I only had seven cubes left."<br/>
"I know, that's why I asked for four sugars."<br/>
"...."</p><p>"Tell me why you wanted to meet, you and I know perfectly well that we aren't the best of allies."</p><p>"Nor the worst of enemies."</p><p>"I beg to differ, you senile old coot."</p><p>"The way you show love astounds me, backhanded compliments? Couldn't you have just said them outright?"</p><p>"...That wasn't a compliment. I have no need to show...*love* to anyone."</p><p>"Ah, but our dear boy would be the exception to that, no?"</p><p>"He is *not* your 'dear boy'. .... Is that why you called me here? To talk about him?"</p><p>"Can't I just catch up with an old student of mine?"</p><p>"Without an ulterior motive? No."<br/>
"You wound me, you truly do. .... How is he treating you, and you him?"</p><p>".... He treats me well, that's all you need to know. And I as well. I...reciprocate whatever he gives me. So we have a...functional relationship."</p><p>"That's good, I was afraid you two would go at each other's throat or go down in a fiery fire of passion. I would ask him to meet me, but...he still hates me, doesn't he?"</p><p>"He does. And I do still."</p><p>"Then why did you accept my summon?"</p><p>"Because I know that despite your meddlesome, you care for him in ways that I cannot."<br/>

"Damn, this tea is way too sweet."</p><p>"And mine way too bitter."</p></div>
