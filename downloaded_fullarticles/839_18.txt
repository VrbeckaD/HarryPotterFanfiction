    <p>"You're markless."</p><p>For the first time since his imprisonment, Newt saw the dark lord visibly tense. He froze, back to the cell, where Newt could see a shadow of a dragon under his blood-damp shirt.</p><p>A dragon unmoving, a long dead, lifeless thing inked on the skin of a soulless man.</p><p>"We both know that isn't your mark," Newt continued. "When you breathe, it doesn't breathe with you. When you walk, it's wings are still-"</p><p>
  <em> When you kill, its maw is open yet no fire comes.</em>
</p><p>"-it's just a picture, isn't it Lord Grindelwald?"</p><p>A tattoo. A mediocre placeholder for a mark. Even as he spoke, Newt weakly shuddered at what he knew it implied. </p><p>Soulmarks. They were abundant in the magical world, and sometimes even the non-magical. Most had one, an animal or a beast that moved and breathed as its own entity, that roamed the skin of its keeper and lived as they lived. A creature that leads you through your future and to the one your heart misses and beloves. </p><p>For years Newt had been debating his mark. For years it had led him down winding paths that left him contentedly isolated from his peers. He'd begun to think the love his mark missed were the very creatures marks were based on, that roamed outside of the human skin, in the waking world, alive and shaped and wonderful. </p><p>But that was after he'd made the false guesses, for the raven was too fitting to be Leta, a melancholy magpie on his brother's shoulder, or Tina, a feisty osprey on Graves'. They'd been too good to be true, in the long run, and the more he thought about it, the less he thought his own mark to be such a conventional creature. </p><p>It was there now on his collar, bare and torn since the acolytes first beating of him and Grindelwald had yet to deign him with another. If he would. In truth, Newt hadn't seen the dark lord much, though he could hear him, his prisoners cries for mercy down the halls keeping him up at night. Newt himself hadn't meant to get caught, yet of course he did. Poachers, of course, had no honor or mercy and neither did their cohorts who had ties to The Greater Good. Acolytes were even more so, and Newt had a broken arm and two busted kneecaps to prove it. </p><p>Blood was trickling down his face now. Honestly, they'd hit his head more times than he could count and he was sure he had a concussion. Half the time he wasn't truly conscious of the world and could only half hear the words that coughed out of his own lips. </p><p>His eyes though, they were oddly fine, if not a bit sensitive, and thus he could see the horrid, terrible picture on the dark lord's back in clarity through the blood. How on earth it had seeped all the way through, he did not want to know. </p><p>Now said dark lord was facing him, again, and walking back towards the cell. Earlier he'd tried to interrogate Newt, but soon gave up seeing as Newt could hardly hear any of his words, let alone form a coherent thought. His steps were muffled in Newt's ears but they still thundered, as did the screech of metal as the cell door grazed the stone floor. </p><p>He was speaking, Newt thought, but of course couldn't hear. The dark lord had a rather soft voice, raspy, but silken. Newt would imagine it sounded nice and perhaps that was how he lured so many to side. Perhaps it was the voice that had bewitched Queenie and had drawn in Leta- Leta, please be alive, I know you're here, he can't have killed you, Leta-</p><p>An iron soled boot came to roll his head upwards. The leather was warm and wet on his cheek. </p><p>Newt couldn't find the strength to fight it. </p><p>For a long time the dark lord just stared into his face. Newt wondered what he was thinking, those predatory eyes blank and narrow. The scrutiny, Newt thought, was this what it felt like to be stared down by hawk? To be a mouse in a thorny nest, fresh caught and captive under knife-like claws, and your captor was wondering what to do with you. Maybe Grindelwald would eat him, tear his heart out. Maybe the dark lord was bored and wanted something to play with. Maybe he knew Newt was delirious and was pondering ways to put him out of his misery. Newt distantly wondered about his creatures. </p><p>Then the dark lord was smiling and Newt's heart simpered. </p><p>"What a terribly smart thing you are, Mister Scamander. Terribly smart and cunning-"</p><p>And then he was being lifted into the dark lord's arms. </p><p>"I'm afraid you can't stay here any longer, Scamander," the words echoed in Newt's head. "You're sick and you might just run your mouth and I can't have that now can I?"</p><p>The world spun. Newt was seeing lights and dark spots. Grindelwald's voice sounded a cacophony of crashing plates and scratching forks over a centuries old organ. Newt struggled, feebly, but the pale man's grip was iron as he carried Newt out of his cell. </p><p>"Sleep Scamander," the dark lord whispered. "Sleep, Miss Lestrange will be there when you wake, and I'll show you the true meaning of horror when you do."</p><p>Newt's world blackened, his heart wrenching a final curl as he thought of his friend and the promise the dark lord held over their heads. </p><p> </p><p>Later he was made to watch as she died. Newt had been chained to the bed as Grindelwald tore Leta's heart out, screaming her name, begging for him to stop, bargaining, as she screamed and cried as he skinned and butchered her alive. </p><p>Later he would wake in a fine king's bed, his limbs free, and the sun gleaming out a slim framed window. Later, he would check the floors with his mended fingers and smell no blood. Later, he would cry on that same floor, tears spewing down his face, crying Leta's name. Later, he would wake alone with a locked door and fresh new clothes and his case on the bed. </p><p>Later, he would wake, but his heart would not be at ease, for the nightmare that repeated itself each time he slept would haunt his day and plague his mind. Newt would not rest, he refused to sleep, and if he did, it would always be in his case, and not the four poster king with the perch standing by its side. He would not look at his mark, even though it screeched and gawked and flapped for his attention. </p><p>Later he would wake screaming, always screaming, for his dreams all ended the same way. </p><p>Grindelwald, smiling kind and sweet, tossing Leta's heart into the maw of Newt's soulmark bird. </p><p> </p>
