</p><p>"Granger?"</p><p>Hermione spun around at the familiar voice behind her. Her face fell. Her heart rate quickened. </p><p>The tall, slender, pale, blond man let out a low chuckle as he shook his head. </p><p>"What exactly…" he trailed off, waving his hands as he stepped into the small room in St. Mungo's. "Merlin, Granger, what is going on?"</p><p>Slipping a bookmark into the pages of her novel, Hermione stood from the chair she was sitting in, smoothing out her skirt. </p><p>"I, uh, goodness. I need to be off." </p><p>Draco stood in front of the doorway, blocking her. "Oh, no, Granger. You're not getting out of this that easily." Raising his eyebrows, he nodded his head towards the bed where Theo was lying, unconscious. "You're going to explain to me why people seem to believe that you, the brightest-witch of her age, the glue of The Golden Trio, are engaged to be wed to Theodore Nott.”</p><p>Hermione took a deep breath and shut her eyes. </p><p>"I…" she blew out of hard breath, moving some of her curls out of her face which was flushed with embarrassment.</p><p>"A few days ago, I was going down to his department at work to inquire about the misuse of a particular potion on a house elf. I'm working on a particularly nasty case where a wizard has been using a potion on his…"</p><p>Draco cut her off, "Saint Granger. Please, spare me the boring details of your profession, will you?"</p><p>Furrowing her brow she continued, "Anyway, it was after-hours and the only person there was Theo. He was in the middle of working on a potion of sorts, when there was a horrid explosion. Theo was knocked onto the ground, and I called up a mediwitch. They brought him here. I followed them here, but no one would let me in unless I was of a particular relation, so I lied. Okay? I needed to see how he was. But then, by Godric, his mother and his grandparents show up. The mediwitch told them, before they even came into the room that I, his fiance, was with him. They were so worried about him; they had been so worried about him, apparently he hasn't spoken to them much recently, and, well, frankly, they seemed <em> relieved </em>that he had someone. And, goodness Draco, they don't know if he's going to be okay! And, well, they were already so worried, I couldn't break the news to them that I wasn't his fiance. They were already upset enough!"</p><p>Hermione stopped, took a breath, and let her arms flop down by her sides. </p><p>Draco, hands in his pockets, stepped forward, closer to her. "Okay…" he said slowly, "so, you just plan on keeping up this...this charade until when? Last I heard, you planned on spending tomorrow night, Christmas Eve, Granger, of all bloody nights, with his mum and grandparents and whomever else is that their <em> family </em>Christmas Eve party. Which, might I add, Theo hasn't gone to in years. Did you know that? Do you know anything about him, Granger? Anything at all?"</p><p>Hermione gulped. "I know his mum misses him, and he's been quite rude to not call her and visit her more often. It's not as if he lives far away. She's a lovely woman. She's been through a lot with his father's trial and so on. What he put her through being a Death Eater." She spat the word out with distaste, and Draco unknowingly moved a hand to rest on his forearm.</p><p>"Yes. She is a nice woman. I spend a lot of time over there to try to makeup for Theo's... lacking. That's besides the point, woman. Don't you have your own family to be with anyhow? Do your parents know about your newly sordid relationship with the Nott family?" </p><p>She gulped, and Draco noticed her face go pale. </p><p>"I...no...they...my parents aren’t..no, they don't, Malfoy. I have to go."</p><p>She stormed past him. Knocking her shoulder against his arm as she went. Draco watched her go, her pace quick and her head hanging low, curls following to hide her face. </p><p>Draco rubbed his arm where she had knocked against his arm. He kicked himself in the ass for being an ass. He knew what had happened to her parents; why he’d ask her about her parents, he didn’t know. Why his default was to put up his shields and be a royal jerk, he didn’t know. </p><p>He took the seat where Hermione had been sitting. He propped his feet up on Theo’s bed, with his toe he nudged him slightly, “You really in a coma, mate? Or are you just loving this attention? Granger. Hermione Granger doting over you.” He let his foot fall off the bed and back onto the floor with a resounding thud, rested his hands in his lap, and thought. </p>
