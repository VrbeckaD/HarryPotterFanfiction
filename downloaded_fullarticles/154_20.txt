          <div class="userstuff"><p>You hurriedly shut the door to your apartment as Sirius tugged on your shirt. </p><p>In no time, he had you stripped to your undergarments and was kissing you fiercely, to which you responded with just as much enthusiasm.</p><p>With heavy breaths and fumbling hands, you both quickly made way to your bedroom and fell on the bed, lips still connected. </p><p>You unbuttoned his shirt in haste and for once, Sirius didn't make a flirty comment. You were the only one he could see right now. </p><p>You whimpered as Sirius sucked on an especially sensitive part of your neck. You could feel his smile on your skin, as he did so and was pretty sure that he was going to rub that in your face later.</p><p>His wandering hands lit a spark inside you that was slowly turning into fire. He sucked on your throat and you tightened your hold on his hair, only then realising where your hands were. </p><p>Sirius grunted in pleasure at your action which made you smile.</p><p>
  <em>Got him.</em>
</p><p>Yanking on his hair harshly, you made him look at you and a shiver ran through your body on seeing his blown out pupils, filled with lust and promises of an unforgettable night.</p><p>"What? Don't you think it's time that we change our roles?" Flipping yourself, so that you were on top, you gripped Sirius' face in your hands and kissed him, every movement filled with a deep hunger for him.</p><p>He wasn't one to back down either. His hands went further down your stomach and you <em>keened</em> when he put them to work. </p><p>Your kisses travelled down his jaw, neck, chest and he moaned in appreciation. As much as he enjoyed your kisses, he needed to be inside you. Gain back the control you had so easily snatched from him.</p><p>This time it was him who flipped you over and stared into your surprised eyes. With an impish grin, he lowered himself into you and you both moaned after being teased for so long. </p><p>"Sirius…" </p><p>God, he wanted to hear you call his name all the damn time. The way it slipped so naturally from your tongue, it made his head spin with giddiness.</p><p>You groaned in appreciation as he began moving and hitting just the right spot. He knew your body like the back of his hand and he knew which switches to poke. </p><p>You buried your face in his neck, kissing and sucking, leaving pink blossoms in their wake. Sirius moaned at the feeling of your lips on his neck. He'll never say it but he loved when you put your marks on him.</p><p>A particularly hard thrust from him had you coming, back arching and the sinful sounds coming from your mouth only made him hotter and he groaned at feeling you tighten around him. </p><p>As you lay together, catching your breath, Sirius suddenly thrusted again, making you yelp but he only gave you a mischievous smile and a slow roll of his hips.</p><p>"Oh, baby we're just getting started." </p><p>•••••••</p><p>As you both lay in your bed, resting after the tiring session, Sirius encircled his arms around your waist and buried his face in your hair. </p><p>He loved your shampoo. It always calmed him down and gave him a sense of familiarity, of <em>peace</em>. </p><p>The action caused you to turn around in his arms and mumble sleepily. Sirius chuckled and kissed your forehead tenderly. You may not be together but that doesn't mean he can't slip up every once in a while.</p><p>You stirred some more and blinked sleepily at him.</p><p>"Shh, go to sleep," He mumbled, eyes getting heavier.</p><p>"You know I have a crush on you, right?" You mumbled and closed your eyes once again and Sirius' eyes snapped open.</p><p>"What the fuck?" He looked at you in disbelief but you were already sound asleep. </p><p>Did that mean that all this time, you two had been dancing around your feelings for each other, in fear that the other didn't feel the same?</p><p>Sirius Black wanted to kill himself.</p><p>He huffed in annoyance but didn't want to wake you up, so wrapped himself around you once again. </p><p>Talking could wait. Right now, he just wanted to enjoy this.</p></div>
