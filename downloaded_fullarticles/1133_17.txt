          <div class="userstuff"><p>You are quietly sitting in the last row, watching him. Professor Snape is standing behind his desk, lecturing in his usual arrogant way. He wears his buttoned up black coat like armor. The cold he emits could freeze water into ice. </p><p>You don’t pay attention to his endless monologues, but love the sound of his voice as much as he does. None of the other pupils would understand your feelings for him, because they either hate or strongly dislike Snape. The cynical and harsh Professor is anything but a man to fall in love with. Never had a person a more fitting name.<br/>
But Snape never notices you. You seem to be not existing to him. His special interest is with Hermione Granger or Harry Potter, but not in a positive way. You have watched numerous of their encounters in the corridors. Every time Snape had unnecessarily rebuked the younger pupils. </p><p>“Miss Meyer…,” sounded a sarcastic voice. “Did my lecture bore you that much… that you have fallen asleep with your eyes open… or was it too simple for your eloquent mind? Or is there a more… sophisticated reason for me not seeing a potion on your table?” He is standing behind his desk with the bubbling potions he’s made as an example and eyes you. His eyes are cold obsidians.</p><p>“I am sorry, Professor Snape, I will start at once.” He won’t miss the slightest thing.</p><p>“I want to talk to you in private… after class in my study. To me you seem… absent minded all the time.”</p><p>“I will be there, Professor Snape.”</p><p>“Excellent.“</p><p>Although you lower your eyes in shame, you feel triumph. Finally he has noticed you. Now, he can’t ignore you any longer. </p><p>After the lesson has finished, you walk right away to his study. Hesitant you knock at the door. “Professor Snape?“, you ask timidly.<br/>
“Come in and sit down.“, sounds his voice from inside.</p><p>Silently you take a seat on the chair in front of his desk. </p><p>Curiously, you look around. The small room is filled with cupboards, that contain jars with ingredients like bundles of dried herbs, white powder made of rat teeth and conserved frogeyes and many books of all sizes. </p><p>“Miss Meyer,… it did not escape me, that you aren’t… paying attention to my lessons in potion making…which has negative influence on your results. May I know… the reason for that behavior?” Snape takes your lack of attention as a personal affront. Nobody dares to oppose him.</p><p>“I am sorry, Professor, I must have been distracted.,” is all you say humbly in defense. “There is no particular reason for my inattentiveness.” It is impossible to tell him, that your thoughts revolve around him and the inappropriate things you wish him to do to you. Some of it has to do with captivation, dungeons and riding crops.</p><p>“Will you punish me, now?” </p><p>Snape studies you. He has noticed being watched by you during the lessons. He has almost felt your looks in his back when turning away, but is aware that your attention has not been to his words. It puzzles him. Female students never stare at him, on the contrary they avoid eye contact or see right through him. Beside of that, he finds you quite attractive; long blonde hair and a well shaped body that reminds him of Lily Potter at that age.</p><p>“Writing an extra composition about… the preparation of the potions from last lesson …should be enough punishment for you.” </p><p>You are disappointed. “Don’t you think that this punishment is too slight?“</p><p>He would have almost risen an eyebrow in surprise, if he weren’t Snape. Never before had a student asked for that, on the contrary, all of them had begged for a less severe punishment. His interest in you suddenly rises.<br/>
“What do you think is an appropriated… punishment?“ </p><p>“Spank me, please!” you burst out. Shocked about your words, you look down at the floor.</p><p>This time Snape almost laughed, but again his self-control is perfect and doesn’t betray even a hint of emotion. This is as absurd as it is tempting to him. But you might be the right woman to life out a secret desire. Defiance and resistance are a challenge to him but obedience and submission are a treat. </p><p>Composed he said : “I would like to punish… disobedient students in that way, but unfortunately the rules of this school won’t allow it.” </p><p>“Would you hit me if I would call you an uptight old virgin with a stick in the butt?” You leer a him with a smile on your lips.</p><p>For a second Snape thinks he’s hallucinating or has a sudden hearing problem. He takes a deep breath. Now you impertinent young lady deserve a punishment to teach you the proper respect. No student has ever dared to call him anything remotely disrespectful. But why are you so hell-bent to be punished by him?</p><p>“I cannot ignore an insult of that magnitude, so I will have to punish you… in order to teach you the proper respect. Bent over my lap…Now!” he commands in a stern voice.</p><p>An adult student is far too old for that kind of punishment, but he can’t resist the temptation. “Ten strokes should be enough to teach you how to behave when talking to your Professor.”<br/>
You obey and place yourself on his lap. Your hands touch the cold stone floor. His thighs in comparison feel warm and firm under your body. The weight of your hips rests on his lap. You feel his belly touching you with every breath he takes. You have never been so close to him, physically, you hardly ever touched him at all. You feel the temperature rising, but resist the temptation to push yourself against him. He wouldn’t allow it anyway. Neither being touched below the waistline. </p><p>Snape feels your soft well-shaped body pushing against him. Your firm breasts are slightly touching his legs. It has been a long time since he had felt a female body against his own. Against his wish, he feels his body reacting accordingly. Focusing on the task that he is about to perform, he swiftly raises your skirt and pulls down your slip while not taking his eyes of his own reflection in the cupboards in front of him. For a second his hand brushes over your firm, smooth flesh. The sensation makes him hard.</p><p>You feel his hand almost caressing your bar skin. If his fingers would slide a little bit lower, he could touch you in a more intimate way. That idea makes you hold your breath. You imagine his fingers slipping deeper down and finally entering you. He lets them slide inside and pulls them back again, before pushing into you for another time. His fingers are wet, now. You shiver under his touch.<br/>
Out of the blue, the first stroke hits you. His hand is hard and hurts you, but you will endure it for him. The next stroke is lighter.</p><p>“Professor Snape?” </p><p>„Do you have enough, already?“ His voice was toneless. </p><p>“You should punish me even more for the disrespectful things that I have thought about you, alone at night in my bed.”</p><p>“I wonder what that could be…” This time his voice was dripping with irony</p><p>“I imagined you coming to my room… Pointing your wand at me, you ordered me to take my cloth off. Then you forced me to lay down on my bed and tied me up with ropes and…”<br/>
One more stroke hits your naked butt. </p><p>“You know very well that I would never do… anything like that to a student. How dare you to assume that… and even be impertinent enough to tell me about it?” The anger masks the arousal in his voice.</p><p>“I am so sorry, Professor Snape.”</p><p>„Yes, you are supposed to be.”</p><p>The images you have created in his mind’s eye are exiting him. He imagines your naked body … throwing you onto the bed, tieing you up, pushing you down on the mattress with his weight. Your moaning …how you twist and arch your back…</p><p>Another stroke on your butt and another soft caress of your flesh. Snape’s breath is labored. His fingers are playing with the fabric of your slip. It takes him all his willpower and self-control to not let his hand slide down under your body in order to touch you were it is wet and warm, now.<br/>
You feel the pulsing between your thigh getting stronger and stronger. The fabric of the slip is already wet. Carefully, you shift your weight in an attempt to touch his hand with you naked skin. Snape grabs you hard around your waist and pushes you down onto his lap.</p><p>„Did I allow you to move, Miss Meyer?“, he rebukes you in a harsh voice. </p><p>“No, I’m sorry, Professor Snape.“ Do to your changed position on his lap, you can feel something that for sure isn’t his magic wand. It is laying very visible on the desk in front of you. So Snape is a man, after all. You let yourself sink down a bit further. Now, you feel his whole length under your lap, pushing against you.<br/>
Snape feels the weight of your body resting on him. He gets indirectly stimulated by each of your movements. His next slap pushes you a little forward, but his face is inexpressive like a mask. </p><p>“I would like to touch you. You got such a large…”, you pant.</p><p>A hard, painful strike hits your butt, that makes you jerk forward. </p><p>You gasp for air in surprise.</p><p>“What I got… is none of your businesses.” His voice sounds husky.</p><p>He feels the fabric of his trousers stretching over his hard cock. If he had been on his own, he would have touched himself, but he resists. There would be time enough for himself afterwards.<br/>
“Wouldn’t you like to touch me? I’m tight and all wet.” </p><p>“Don’t be disrespectful, Miss Meyer. You are talking to your teacher,…never forget that.” His breath was still labored, almost panting, now.</p><p>„When I’m watching you standing behind your desk in the classroom, I imagine you pushing your hand under my skirt. I’m not wearing a slip. You softly caress my naked thighs. Then your hand moves higher and higher until you touch me where I’m wet… and tight.”</p><p>You feel his belly moving up and down with each breath he takes.</p><p>“Slowly, you let one finger slide inside me.” You carefully move your hips in his lap while talking. “Then I open your coat. I start at the top, button by button, until I pull it off your shoulders. My hands caress your ivory skin. They move down to your waist. I open the last button.”</p><p>“No…you won’t” He was almost panting. “You mustn’t do that,… I can’t allow it.”</p><p>You are still moving unhampered like in a lap dance, rubbing against his hand and body. You can feel his hard cock through the fabric. If you had the chance, you would open his zipper and rub him until he comes so hard that he moans, while warm liquid is running down between your fingers.</p><p>„But you hit my fingers with your wand, because I’m such an impertinent girl. But all I want is to have some fun with you. I know how hard you can be, Severus.”, you whisper.<br/>
Snape winces at the sound of his first name. He feels close to exploding every second. He imagines laying you down on his desk, pulling up your skirt and thrusting hard into you. Then he tears your blouse open and reveals your firm naked breasts. His hands are caressing and touching them. He plays with your hard nipples, rubs and teases them. You roll your hips under him. He can hear your moaning. Then he spans your thighs with his hands in order to lift your hips higher up, so he can thrust deeper. Every thrust brings him closer to the edge.</p><p>„You can’t hide from me how much you want it. Come for me,… Severus! Don’t fight it.“</p><p>He is audibly panting. One more stroke hits your soft skin, making your body jerk.</p><p>“Don’t fight it, let go.“</p><p>Like on cue, he loses control.</p><p>Snape bits the inner part of his lips to keep himself from crying out loud. His orgasm rolls over him like a giant wave of pleasure that is about to drown him.<br/>
You feel the tension in his body that ends with a shiver, before he rests in silence for a moment. The reflection in the cupboard shows his face slowly relaxing and taking a serene expression. His eyes have been closed all the time.</p><p>“Now, I have punished you enough…, you may leave.”, he said brusque after catching his breath.</p><p>You get up and fix your clothes, then you notice the wet spot in his lap and can’t help but stare at it. Like incidental, he crosses his legs and covers himself with his cape, when becoming aware of your gaze.<br/>
„You just send me away like that?”</p><p>His demonstrative aloofness and coldness is close to cruelty. He has used you, has given you nothing in return, but what else have you been expecting coming from a man like him? Hugs and cuddles? Severus Snape has never been and will never be a man of sentimentality. It is not in his nature.</p><p>”You can visit me any time in my office, you know my office hours.”</p><p>„Will you punish me again?“ You almost sound disappointed.</p><p>„Only if you …deserve it.“ He paused significantly. “One more thing,..when coming to your next visit, you won’t wear a slip.” He already has something nice in mind. </p><p>You nodd and leave without looking back. Outside, walking down the corridor, you can’t believe what just has happened. It feels surreal like the idea of Snape’s hand touching your naked skin. The memory makes you shiver again. Quickly, you disappear into the school-bathroom and lock yourself in. Your slip is sticking wet to your thighs. You imagine Snape rising you skirt, while your hand is sliding into your underwear. In your imagination, he bents you over his desk and gives you what you desire most. He grabs your thighs from behind and pulls you close to him. You watch the reflection of his face in the cupboard. His eyes are closed, the lips form a thin line, until he comes in hot splashes all over your body. This time he can’t restrain himself and loses all self-control. The imagination of him moaning and grimacing with sexual pleasure takes you over the edge.</p><p>Completely out of breath, you come back to reality. Your legs are still trembling and you fear to sink to the floor. Exhausted you sit down on the toilet lit. How could you ever look in your potion master’s eyes again without remembering that afternoon?</p></div>
