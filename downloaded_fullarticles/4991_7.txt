          <div class="userstuff"><p>"You absolute <em>idiot</em>!" Severus lunged across the desk, knocking the ring away from the Headmaster's outstretched finger. "What were you <em>thinking</em>?!"</p><p>The ring hissed angrily in the corner, as though it knew just how close it had been to securing Albus Dumbledore's end. With a withering glare, Severus grabbed the Sorting Hat.</p><p>"Sword. Now," he demanded. Instantly, the Sword of Gryffindor dropped into his hand and he advanced upon the ring. A greenish mist poured out, growing human-shaped. Green eyes stared imploringly at him.</p><p>"Sev, don't-"</p><p>With a sharp cry, Severus brought the sword down on it, wincing as a terrible scream filled the air and cut out abruptly. The blackened ring lay on the ground, devoid of any signs of life. Severus Vanished it with a sneer.</p><p>"Disgusting things, horcruxes," he growled, whirling on Albus. "And <em>you</em>! I thought you knew better than to-"</p><p>"My sister...she...she was telling me that she'd forgive me if I just…" Albus' eyes were far away, and he looked far more frail than Severus had ever seen him.</p><p>"It wasn't your fault!" Severus said sharply.</p><p>"I should have put on that ring. It's what I deserve," Albus said brokenly.</p><p>"Are you <em>insane</em>? You are the only thing that stands between the Dark Lord and the enslavement-slash-genocide of...everyone!" Severus hissed. "Bugger killing yourself for your past mistakes! The only thing that matters is if you keep going and learn from it!"</p><p>"Pot meet kettle," Albus replied. "What about Lily, eh? I've seen you moping around the grounds."</p><p>Severus reeled back as though he'd been slapped. "Well, I'm not the one who keeps visiting his homicidal ex-boyfriend in prison!"</p><p>Albus stood, his brow furrowing. "Gellert was never my boyfriend!"</p><p>"I'm sure it wasn't for lack of trying!" Snape shouted, his cheeks scarlet with fury. "I wonder what Rita Skeeter would think if she knew you were Grindelwald's failed groupie!"</p><p>"I could say the same thing about you and Tom!" Dumbledore thundered, his eyes cold.</p><p>"At least I didn't kiss his d-"</p><p>"Silence!" Dumbledore slammed his hands down on the table and a thunderclap of power sent their hair whipping around their faces.</p><p>They stared at each other in silence for a long moment, their chests heaving.</p><p>Simultaneously, they began snickering.</p><p>Even Severus threw his head back and let out a roar of laughter.</p><p>"Cruel much, Severus?" Albus chuckled.</p><p>"You were in rare form as well, Albus. A Horcrux is a hell of a thing," Severus replied, gathering his composure. "Just promise me one thing."</p><p>"Yes?"</p><p>"Next time you get the bright idea to endanger your own life over a bit of jewelry, be sure that it's more tasteful. That thing was gauche to the extreme." Severus' eyes glittered with humor.</p><p>"I'm fairly certain that one of them is a tiara," Dumbledore replied mirthfully.</p><p>"<em>Great</em>," Severus replied sardonically, "Finally, you can be the queen you've always wished to be."</p><p>"Go on, then," Dumbledore said, making a shooing motion. "I have plenty of things I need to accomplish before tomorrow now that you've saved my old, wrinkly hide."</p><p>"Far be it from me to get between Albus Dumbledore and tedious paperwork," Severus replied, snickering. He turned, robes billowing. He turned back at the door, raising his hand in a silent farewell.</p><p>The old man was already bent over a stack of parchment, mumbling to himself and sucking on a sherbet lemon.</p><p>He did not see the wistful, relieved look in the Potions Master's eyes.</p><p>It was just as well. There was still much to do.</p></div>
