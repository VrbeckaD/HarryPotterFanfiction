</p><p>          "Mr.Graves? May I come in?" Asks a young woman as she knocked on the Auror's door. He worked on paperwork as he waved his two left fingers slightly, which unlocked the door and opened it.</p><p>          "What is it that you need, Miss Goldstein?" The man asked as he continued to write, he finished that sheet as he went to the sheet on the pile. The paper he was finished with levitated up into air and neatly onto the pile of finished paperwork. Tina Goldstein gulps slightly as she looked down at the marble floor and tucked her short hair behind her ear.</p><p>          "Madam President told me to call for you," She says.</p><p>          "Is it urgent matters?" He asks as he continued to work, not looking up at her as he did so.</p><p>          "Well, she requested for you to come up to Major Investigation Department." He breathed out a sigh as he paused writing for a moment before he put his black ink fountain pen down.</p><p>          "Again, Miss Goldstein, is it urgent matters?" Tina breathes out a sigh as well.</p><p>          "Madam President requests you, Mr.Graves, to go up to Major Investigation Department to meet someone. It is as certain that it's not really that urgent but she urges me to tell you to meet this person." He looks up at her with his dark eyes finally.</p><p>          "See? Wasn't that hard, was it now?" He asks as he stands, she rolls her eyes slightly, he straightens out his vest as he stands, "Now you can go and tell Madam President that I will be there in a moment." She nods as she walks off. With a wave of his hand, the door closes after her and locks automatically. He motions his monochrome colored coat over which levitated from his coat hanger and flew over to him, it being open in air so he could slip his arms in easily. Fixing it a little before fixing his necktie. He grabbed his wand and put it in holster as he walked out. The door opening then closing behind him and locking automatically.</p><p>     Percival Graves, looked upon by many who weren't in the highest social status in MACUSA, the Magical Congress of the United States of America, such as an Auror. He wasn't just an Auror neither. But also Director of Magical Security and head of MACUSA's Department of Magical Law Enforcement. Graves was looked upon for his nonverbal magic (Casting spells without saying them out loud and which was rather advanced as well), apparition when needing to move fast, and his high level of control and mastery for wandless magic. He was also looked upon for being highly determined, professional, intelligent, charming (to the fellow witches in MACUSA). There were many and many things he was looked up for as he walked to the Major Investigation Department with a stoic face.</p><p>          <em>'Who could Madam President want me to meet if it's this urgent? Woodrow Wilson?' </em> Percival thinks as he smoothed his hair back and stepped into the elevator. The short elevator operator who was a house elf stood near the buttons as he looked up at Percival with his squinting eyes.</p><p>          "Where to, Mr.Graves?" He asks with hoarse and raspy voice.</p><p>          "Major Investigation Department." He says as he slipped his hands into his coat pockets and leaned back against the wall. The house elf presses the button and the doors close as the elevator goes down. Once to the floor, the doors open and he walks out, "Thanks." He says to the house elf as he walks away. Percival heads down the hall and opens the doors. At the large table stood Madam Seraphina Picquery who was the President of MACUSA, Tina, and another young woman. This woman had (h/l) (h/c) hair, and (s/c) skin. Percival looked at this woman skeptically up and down as he stood at the table with them as she looked at him too, his dark eyes meeting her (e/c) ones. "You called for me, Madam President?" He says looking away from the young woman's (E/c) orbs and to Madam President. She gives a single nod.</p><p>          "Yes. I'm glad you came." He looks at the unknown woman and back at Madam President.</p><p>          "Who's she, if I may ask?"</p><p>          "This young lady here is our new recruit." She says nodding to the recruit. The girl looks at Percival with a slight smirk as she held out her hand.</p><p>          "(F/n) (M/n) (L/n). Are you Mr.Graves?" He looks at her hand before taking it in his own and shaking it.</p><p>          "Who else could I be? Of course I am." He says with slight annoyance which she slightly smirks at.</p><p>          "Now, Mr.Graves, Miss (L/n) here is an Auror just like you and you two will be working together." Percival nods.</p><p>          "I see."</p><p>          "Yes. And I say that she'll be working with you, I must clarify that it means she'll be WORKING with you." Madam President states. He nods again.</p><p>          "I see... Wait." He looks at her, "Do you mean that she won't be just a co-worker..."</p><p>          "But a partner in crime almost." Tina says. Percival looks at the two before looking at (Y/n), he kept a stoic look but his eyes showed as if he was sent to punch a baby. He took a deep breath to calm his nerves and let out a small laugh.</p><p>          "No," He says as he shook his head, "I believe that's not really necessary, Madam President."</p><p>          "And why is that, Mr.Graves?"</p><p>          "That's my exact question on why I need a 'partner in crime'?" He asks as he placed his hands on the table and leaned forward to calm his nerves.</p><p>          "Well, Mr.Graves, you have loads of paperwork to do. Investigations and cases may be solved faster with a partner. And you can't always be a lone wolf-"</p><p>          "I hate to interrupt, Madam, but you know I like to work alone and independently. Why can't she be partnered up with Miss Goldstein." He asks.</p><p>          "Well, Miss Goldstein has things of her own to do as well outside of MACUSA." Madam President says as she motions a hand towards Tine who nods.</p><p>          "Well I hate to be childish but I just simply find this unfair now." Percival says with his eyebrows furrowed, "I mean, I also have things to do outside of MACUSA-"</p><p>          "At this moment?" Madam President interrupts with a brow raised. He's quiet for a moment.</p><p>          "Well not at this moment of course but later on."</p><p>          "It's not about it being fair or not."</p><p>          "Then please, Madam President, elaborate for me to get a somewhat clearer picture of how what this is about."Percival says, his patience slowly reaching its limit.</p><p>          "It's about Miss (L/n) feeling like she's part of MACUSA-"</p><p>          "Well she is, isn't she-"</p><p>          "Please don't interupt me, Mr.Graves." Madam President says sternly. Percival sighs and nods.</p><p>          "My apologies. Please, continue." Tina watches in slight shock to see Percival to get this upset so far, (Y/n) watched in slight amusement. Madam President sighs and continued.</p><p>          "As I was saying. It's not about it being fair or not. It's about (Y/n) feeling like she's part of MACUSA as an newly recruited Auror. So being partnered with another Auror, such as yourself, who's much more professional and diligent in his work, it helps her become better and welcomed. Now I am to see it that you will be working together with Miss (L/n) and not independently, and that you two will get along and cooperate with one another. Am I clear, Mr.Graves?" He's quiet for a moment before nodding.</p><p>          "Yes, Madam President." Then she looks at (Y/n).</p><p>          "Are my orders clear to you as well, Miss (L/n)?" (Y/n) looks at Percival for a moment, which he glances at her, and looks back up at Madam President and nods.</p><p>          "Yes, Madam President." She smiles at the two and Tina breathes a sigh of relief.</p><p>          "Good. Now, Mr. Graves, would you please give Miss (L/n) a tour of MACUSA before going back to work?" Percival nods with a sigh.</p><p>          "Of course. But that will take almost all day."</p><p>          "Well then I urge you two to get going. Miss Goldstein, please stay so I could discuss something with you as well." Tina nods.</p><p>          "Yes, Madam President." Then the two Aurors head out. They walked to the elevator in silence before Percival breaks it.</p><p>          "I wish to not babysit you but get back to paperwork as soon as possible so try to keep up or I will assure you that you would get yourself lost."He says as they arrived to the elevator. The doors open and he steps in, "Lobby." He says to the house elf. (Y/n) looks at him with her eyebrows furrowed.</p><p>          "Hmph. I '<em>will</em>' try my best to not hold you up, Mr.Graves." She says as she stepped into the elevator and stood next to him. He nods in approval.</p><p>          "Good. Keep it that way, Miss (L/n)." He says as the doors closed, the house elf pressed the button to the lobby and up they went.</p>
