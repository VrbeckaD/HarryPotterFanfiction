    <p>Dudley,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hogwarts is a strange place and I don't know if I really like it.  I think I'm too used to dad's tower and always having Jarvis around if I need help (I accidentally asked for him twice while in the library).  I already sent dad and pop a letter – the bracelet is still glowing, too, but you probably knew that.  People ask about them all the time, but I just tell them my fathers are over protective.  Not all of them like that I have two of them, but I don't care.  Only a few people know they're superheroes, but that's only the ones that didn't grow up in the wizarding world.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I made a few friends so far.  Uncle Thor probably told you about Neville and his grandmother.  Neville is what they call a Pureblood – both his parents are, and came from, wizarding blood.  He knows a lot about mythology and was excited to know that he met <em>the</em> Thor, God of Thunder.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hermione is what they call a Muggleborn since neither of her parents are magical.  My mom was apparently one as well, which explains why your mom isn't?  That makes me a half-blood and it's all complicated.  I drew dad a chart for it, though I'm sure pop will use it more.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Classes are okay.  Hermione is smart and helps when Neville and I don't understand things.  Neville's a bit slow, but he's catching on fast.  We just had to figure out how to phrase things to him.  He loves Herbology (plant things), so we try to reference that.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>People keep calling me 'Potter' and I don't like it.  I'm a Rogers now, and I make sure they all know it.  Don't tell dad, but I'm in detention every night for two weeks because my potions professor (think chemistry) doesn't like when I correct him.  He think I'm being arrogant or something and calls me a celebrity.  Duh, my dad is <em>Iron Man</em> and my pop is <em>Captain America</em>.  As their kids, we're kind of a big deal.  I think he's talking about this world, though, and that's still strange.  Anyway, he doesn't really like me, but whatever.  I think he'd get along with Uncle Bruce, though.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We have a Defense Against the Dark Arts class that always gives me a headache.  I don't know why, either.  Professor Quirrell is odd, that's for sure.  He stutters a lot and wears this weird turban.  A lot of kids make fun of him and I try to tell them to stop, but I don't think they care.  I'm only a 'first-year' after all.  I can stop the first-years from doing it next year if I come back, though.  Pop would be proud.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I hope you're doing okay.  I miss you and wish you could be here.  We should talk to Uncle Thor and see if he can do anything about it.  Maybe there's a switch or something inside you, since my mom got in?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I'll be home at Christmas!  Can't wait to see you.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Your brother,</p>
<p>Harry</p>
