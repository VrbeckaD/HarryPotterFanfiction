    <p>Shimmering dust flowed through the air, gold and red sand mixed with whatever shiny remnants Credulous McGinn could muster from the clutches of house elves. Flakes of shiny paint, clips from old spoons, and fractions of jewelry were weaving through the air alongside the dancing sand, bouncing in steady rhythm that Credulous fondly related to the tides of an ocean. He had been remarkably vigilant on keeping the flow of the sand from touching anything that could jostle or otherwise disrupt it, keeping a respectful distance from the roof and walls of his hut-next-to-the-forest. </p><p><em>Any disruption would be catastrophic for the task at hand,</em> He told himself long before he had come back from working alongside the Transfiguration teacher of Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. As a student who took schooling early, he was forbidden from graduating until finishing the year at the age of 17. <em>Such is law,</em> he recollected almost bitterly. It had been up to the school as to what to do with him next, and they have decided he would best be kept in the school and housed on grounds, making up the hospitality by helping teachers with lessons and being responsible for most- if not all- detentions that were to take place. </p><p><em>Punishment for the greater of mind,</em> Credulous supposed. Such was not important now though, what was important was his testing. His <em>hypothesis</em>, as he had learned from a muggleborn student. The sand and flakes inside it, were flowing to give him an understanding of how free magic moves. They were sitting on his carefully loosened magic. He practiced months on the technique of letting his magic roam without his restrains, alongside many practices for mending broken bones without detection and creating excuses for terribly tedious explosions. His experiment was to hold magic in air, to keep it still and pause the fluidity of it.</p><p>While magic could hold objects, hell, <em>people</em> in air and give off the illusion of immobility, magic was of itself still moving. To Credulous, it was a tasteful idea to test magics limits and properties. Nobody else seemed to be interested in it, too certain in that magic is something intangible and therefor not worth the time to be studied. Although, most people take magic for granted, believing it will never die out- let alone could be immobilized. </p><p><em>Surely, if I find a way to hold magic still, someone out there will finally share my interests.</em> Credulous thought to himself, allowing his eyes to drift with the sand as he pondered what emotions he would feel if such were to happen. After a few seconds, he turned back to his wicker-handled wand and plucked it up. He wondered what position would be best to disrupt the flow, though decided that because this had never been attempted, he would need to learn from trial and error. So, he positioned himself in front of the door of his hut and pointed the wand up at the flowing magic. As much as he knew this wouldn't be a successful first trial, he could only hope that it didn't leave him with noticeable bruisings. His professors and first year students would either worry or question it, and Credulous sincerely hated having to explain his studies to people who held no interest for them.</p><p>Credulous took a breath and gave a sharp flick of his wand,<em> "Petrificus Totalus."</em></p><p>He waited for a moment, watching as the magic continued to move in undisturbed waves. Credulous gaged his chances with other spells, and decided that it would be no harm to him if he used a few darker spells for the greater good of testing. </p><p><em>"Evuea."</em> Credulous furrowed his eyebrows in concentration, trying to focus the usually potent spell on the magic in the air. Nothing.</p><p>
  <em>"Relactus Scuntruma."</em>
</p><p>The sand was beginning to waver. That's a positive sign, especially since he was not inflicting his spell on the sand. This means the magic holding it was being affected. He focused his entire mind on the magic before him, however invisible it was, and gripped the wicker of his wand until his knuckles paled. <em>"Scolumdra Tutalem."</em></p><p>The next thing Credulous was registering was that he was on his back, outside of his hut, with his front door under him. He rolled over, looking back at his hut and scampered to step in and look at the damage that had been done. His curtains were shredded in odd shapes, spirals that circled holes and snow-flake like designs that were still burning away at the fabric. The glass jars with wand cores were exploded, the caps of said jars littering the walls of his hut and seeming equally as inflicted as the curtains have been. As much as Credulous tried to find the remnants of the sand and flakes of spoons, jewelry, and paint, he couldn't. It would seem that they were completely obliterated, washed from existence. </p><p>Credulous found it all so beautiful. But, he also knew that he should hurry with repairing his hut should he wish to continue these experiments. If the headmaster of Ilvermorny found out he was experimenting with something so dangerous, he would surely be expelled. </p><p>And Credulous McGinn most certainly refused to be expelled for challenging magics nature.</p>
