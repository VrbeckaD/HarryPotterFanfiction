    <p>Her first reaction upon reading the old books of Grimmauld place is incandescent fury. Why the hell was this not taught at all, not even freaking mentioned at all, in any book she’d ever read at Hogwarts, despite going through quite a bit of the Restricted Section.</p>
<p>Why did she bust her ass laying ward after ward after ward to keep herself and Harry (and Ron, when he was there) safe, when such a simpler way existed right from the start?</p>
<p>
  <em>{Despite having passed into disuse over time, Sexual Magick remains one of the strongest and fastest ways to ward up a home. The rituals involved have long since been fine tuned, as providing a safe space for one offspring has always been amongst the foremost goal of young couples.}</em>
</p>
<p>Ron took a step back when she viciously slammed the book on the kitchen table, and pointed at it. “Were you aware?” She simply asked, pointing an accusing finger at the title: <u>The Magick Of Ritual Sex</u>.</p>
<p>Harry stared alternatively at her and the book, looking faintly alarmed. Ron turns tomato red. “This is old junk Hermione…”</p>
<p>“You are telling me that all this time, there were ways to use powerful magic, Light Powerful Magic, to protect ourselves, no less, and you never thought to mention it to me?”</p>
<p>“I wasn’t even sure it was real, Hermine, those are practically myths…”</p>
<p>“Myths. You mean like the Deathly Hallows?”</p>
<p>Ron stared at Harry. Harry stared at Ron. Hermione threw her hands up in disgust, took the heavy spellbook from the table, and turned away from the boys. “I will be in the library, studying arcane spells that could potentially save a lot of lives if anyone ever bothered to remember they exist!”</p>
<p>“So,” Ron said once Hermione had disappeared up the stairs, “do you suppose she’ll ask me to help out in her new study material?” He didn’t seem that thrilled with the idea.</p>
<p>Harry shrugged. “You better hope so mate, because she’s not about to let go of her new study material, and at the point she wants to get practical, it’s either you help her out, or she’ll either go it alone, or she’ll have someone else take the place.”</p>
<p>Ron slapped a hand on his eyes. At least, Harry looked as awkward as he felt talking about sex (or Hermione having sex) with his best mate.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As it turned out, studying sex spells was <em>not</em> one of Hermione’s passing fancies. Upon researching some more, she’d discovered that not only could any willing (or sometimes unwilling, but she wasn’t touching <em>that</em>) couple, group, and even a fair few loners absolutely could use sex spells not only to protect themselves and their families of threats like Voldemort, but some of it could even be used to lighten the house elves’ (or homemaker’s) load.</p>
<p>The spells, though ancient, were straight forward and hard to mess up (at least no more difficult than potion, that was for sure), they could be used by any witch or wizard, and even some Squibs. It only required for the knowledge to be assembled and made available instead of moldering in the back stacks of private and dubious personal libraries. That and to have a society a smidge less puritan.</p>
<p>Hermione had a plan to make such things available, and it involved printing her own book. Which in turn involved lots of researches, cross-referencing, study of theoretical magic, and, of course, testing stuff herself to ensure all the rituals were actually safe to perform and still usable.</p>
<p>In a word, Hermione thrived in her new subject matter.</p>
<p>By the time she had selected which rituals she wanted to try out first, it had become obvious that Ron would not, in fact, be the one to perform the rituals with her. She wasn’t that fussed about it. The passion had fizzed out after the war ended, it was regrettable, but not alarming. They were still best of friends, still lived in Grimmauld place with Harry, and Hermione had a wealth of rituals that didn’t actually require a partner to go through. In fact, going by the way of masturbation would eliminate one unstable variant, which in turn would make her experimentation more trustworthy.</p>
