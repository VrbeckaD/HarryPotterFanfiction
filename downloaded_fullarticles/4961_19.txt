<em>“A Savings Account? You?”</em><br/>
<em> “My future has companions! But yours consists only of dirty money!”</em><br/>

<em> “M-Mom... H... Help me... please...”</em></p><p>Vvv</p><p>               When Molly Weasley knocked on her daughter’s bedroom door to wake her for breakfast, she did not expect anything out of the ordinary to occur.</p><p>               Ginny had been home the last two weeks of school so that she could recover from her traumatic time spent under the influence of the spirit trapped in that diary. Her daughter had been very quiet during her break from school, but in the last day or so she had begun to regain some colour, even chatter on about something to Molly if the topic was something Ginny enjoyed. It truly gave Molly some hope that Ginny could go back to the way she had been before the horrible, awful thing that had happened to her.</p><p>               So when Molly knocked on Ginny’s door and called out that breakfast was on the table, the last thing she expected to hear was a strangled sob from the other side.</p><p>               “Ginny? Ginny, dear, what’s the matter?” Molly immediately asked, worried and ready to burst into the room but wanting to give Ginny a little time to respond, just in case she wanted her privacy.</p><p>               More sobbing reached Molly’s ears, and then her daughter spoke, gravelly, like she was choking on something deep in her throat, and so unbearable weak that it broke her heart into hundreds of pieces.</p><p>               “M-Mom... H... Help me... please... it hurts...” Molly had no need for further prompting, and practically broke the door off of its hinges in order to get to her daughter as fast as she could.</p><p>               The youngest Weasley was curled up into a tight ball on her bed, face scrunched up in pain and arms wound tightly around her stomach. There were no tears on her pale face, but she let out sobs in between long, shuddering breaths, and blood dripped from her open mouth, staining her faded yellow sheets. Ginny opened her eyes –dark, had they always been so dark? –to look at her mother and heaved wetly, sending more blood to splatter onto her bed.</p><p>               “Help... ugh... it- it hurts... so much...”</p><p>               “Ginny!” Molly screamed, rushing over to her daughter, her baby, wand drawn and tears gathering in her eyes. “Ginny, oh, my baby... don’t move, it’s going to be alright, just hold on...” Ginny shut her eyes and held her mother’s free hand in a vice grip, her face slackening as Molly flicked her wand in several directions, muttering unintelligibly under her breath. “It’s okay Ginny, you’re fine, you’re alright... you’re going to be okay...!”</p><p>               __</p><p>Hours later, Molly knelt next to the fireplace in the family room off of the ward Ginny was being treated in. When Arthur’s face bloomed into view, he looked tired and satisfied, the same look he had whenever he finished investigating an interesting case, and Molly found herself unable to say anything right away.</p><p>               “Hello dear, sorry for the delay. You don’t normally call me at work.” Arthur observed, noticing his wife’s blotchy cheeks and wrinkled forehead after he had spoken, so Molly sniffed and shook her head.</p><p>               “Arthur- Arthur, it’s Ginny, she had to go to- had to come to St. Mungo’s, I don’t know w-what to do...” Arthur sucked in an alarmed breath and shuffling sounds were heard on the other end of the connection.</p><p>               “Wait right there dear, I’ll be there in a second –what ward are you in?” Arthur disappeared from the flames after she relayed it, but Molly could still hear him telling Perkins where he was going, and then he was stumbling out of the fireplace, tripping over the rug as he sank to the ground and enveloped Molly in his arms. “Molly, dear Merlin...”</p><p>               “Sh- She was crying... and- and bleeding from her stomach and-“ Molly sobbed loudly into Arthur’s shoulder, and he tightened his arms to try and comfort her. “-and her mouth... Arthur I don’t know what happened! I just w- went to wake her up for- for breakfast! The healer said that if I hadn’t cast the spell when I did-!”</p><p>               “Shh... we’ll figure this out Molly. Let’s just- let’s get to Ginny before anything else.” Soothing, Arthur brought both of them to their feet and turned to the door. Before he could lead Molly through, however, someone else opened it and didn’t seem surprised to find the distraught parents in this room.</p><p>               “Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, if you could follow me. We have a few things to discuss concerning your daughter.” Healer Cornwall went straight to the point, gesturing at a pair of chairs directly opposite the one she stood next to.</p><p>               “What’s wrong with Ginny?” Molly asked as soon as they had seated themselves, nerves stretched so thin that it was a wonder that she hadn’t been breaking the older woman’s door down before now to demand answers; beside her, Arthur nodded in agreement, also wanting to know. Healer Cornwall sighed heavily and crossed her arms, giving the space just above the Weasley’s heads her full attention.</p><p>               “Miss Weasley has severe magic depletion, slight malnutrition and several areas of deep bruising on her limbs, going all the way to the bone.” Molly’s hand flew to cover her mouth and Arthur’s fingers clenched from their place on his wife’s shoulder. “Though I managed to fully heal the lacerations to her stomach and side, she will need to remain in our care for at least the next week in order to get her back on the path to proper health... What concerns me more than her condition itself is how she came to be in such a state.” As the silence stretched longer and longer, Arthur took the lead and cleared his throat, pausing only briefly to look askance at another Healer in the doorway.</p><p>               “Ginny was being... possessed. Nearly the entire school year, so far as we can tell.” He said slowly, keeping in mind what Dumbledore had told him not to mention. “It’s since been destroyed, but we really thought that was the end of it. If you need to, please talk to the Headmaster, he can tell you more than we could.”</p><p>               “That’s why Ginny was at home instead of Hogwarts.” Molly explained, not taking her eyes off of her daughter. “So she could recover, but then... then this...”</p><p>               Healer Cornwall nodded tersely, handing the Weasley couple a piece of parchment with a detailed schedule written on it. “This is the potions regimen Miss Weasley will be started on today, barring any changes made later. All will be fed into her through an insertion spell while she is under a magically induced coma. After her release at the end of the week, it will be your responsibility to have her follow a new regimen for her to reach full health.”</p><p>               “Yes, yes of course.” Molly told the mediwitch, tucking the paper into her pocket gingerly and grabbing Arthur’s hand, her husband squeezing firmly back to reassure her. The Healer watched them for a moment before moving towards the door, turning to address her assistant once the door had been shut behind her.</p><p>               “Please go and get me some floo powder. I’m going to call Headmaster Dumbledore immediately.” Healer Kumar nodded once and strode off, leaving her senior to walk sedately back to her office.</p><p>Vvv</p><p>               It was five days later that the rest of the Weasley children returned from Hogwarts, ferried back to the Burrow by the Knight Bus and excited for the beginning of summer. Upon entering their home, they found their father waiting for them at the kitchen table, the Daily Prophet spread out in front of him and a mug of gillywater in his hand. He asked his boys to put their things away and then come back down quickly, a task they executed with worry growing in their chests at the blatant tiredness dimming Arthur’s normally cheerful features. When those four of the Weasley brothers were sitting around their father, he pushed his drink and the newspaper to the side and gave a heavy sigh.</p><p>               “Something happened to your sister.” All four sat up rigidly at this; they had already been told about Ginny’s possession, but they hadn’t been informed about anything else beyond that she was staying home to recover from it. “On Sunday, your mother found Ginny, and she had been stabbed twice in the stomach.” Alarmed looks painted his children’s faces, and Arthur held up a hand to stop them from speaking before he was done. “We don’t know who did it or how it happened, but thankfully she was healed in time. It did reveal a few lingering effects from the possession as well, so Ginny has been in a magical coma since then, taking many different potions to get her back to her former health. If all goes well, she’ll be able to come home within the next few days.”</p><p>               “Why didn’t you <em>tell</em> us?” Ron demanded, his ears turning red in frustration and his eyes narrowing dangerously.</p><p>               “You all still had school, and Ginny was in no danger after she got to St. Mungo’s.” Arthur nearly snapped; exhaustion and anxiety combining to make his usually soft countenance stern and irritable. “We had a choice between worrying you for the entirety of your final week or wait to tell you until you could physically be here with us, and her.”</p><p>               “Is- Is mother with Ginny right now?” Percy quietly asked, averting his eyes to study the dusty kitchen counter, no longer gleaming from constant use and constant cleaning, having been abandoned for almost a week. Arthur’s eyes softened as he looked at his middle child; Percy had been feeling so <em>guilty</em> for not telling anyone about Ginny’s troubles and Arthur knew that once she was released Percy wasn’t going to let her out of his sight.</p><p>               “She’ll be back soon, visiting hours end right around now.” Fred and George scowled fiercely, realizing that that meant they couldn’t see their baby sister right away. Arthur noticed this as well and was quick to reassure them, lest he start finding singed Gnomes out underneath their window. “Don’t worry, we’ll be going to St. Mungo’s tomorrow, you won’t have to wait much longer to see her. Maybe even-“</p><p>               Arthur cut himself off as Molly swept into the kitchen, frazzled and stressed but smiling and brightening even more when she caught sight of the rest of her family. The boys began bombarding her with questions, so loud that Arthur temporarily <em>silencio-ed</em> them before he could calm them down enough that their mother could speak.</p><p>               “They said that Ginny’s doing better than they could have expected.” Molly reported, the sheer relief she felt was clear in her eyes as she told them. “When we go tomorrow, Ginny will be awake. Healer Cornwall explained that she would wake her up before we got there because Ginny still has to take a few potions.”</p><p>               Arthur looked a little troubled, but nodded in acceptance. “If that’s what she thinks is best.”</p><p>               “When are we-“</p><p>               “-going to see her? Not too-“</p><p>               “-late in the day we hope.” The twins interjected, giving their parents equally pleading looks.</p><p>               “We’re going at noon, so we can bring Ginny lunch.” Molly said, finally sitting down heavily in the chair next to her husband. “I don’t feel up to cooking tonight.”</p><p>               “I’ll cook, dear, that is, if you don’t mind it being subpar compared to your meals.” Molly smiled at Arthur, content in the knowledge that tomorrow their life could start going back to normal.</p><p>               __</p><p>               Two years later, Jinnai Kouhei opened his eyes.</p>
