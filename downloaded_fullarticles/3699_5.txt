  <em>Forbidden Forest</em>
</p><p>Parvati Patil and Lavender Brown laid on the grass near the Forbidden Forest. They were mostly just talking, although they exchanged kisses here and there.</p><p>Of course, the whole scenario was normal as they did it at least twice a week. However, some of the students, mainly Muggle-borns, couldn't quite fathom why two girls would be together as a "couple". Wasn't it inhumane?</p><p>Parvati knew one of these people was Hermione Granger, their roommate (Although she had been more accepting as of recently). That girl really needed to get the stick out of her bum.</p><p>"I don't really want to go back home," complained Lavender. Her dad was a pureblood and accepted their relationship because it was normal in the Wizarding World, but her mum was another story.</p><p>Parvati turned to her and smiled. "Maybe you could come to mine instead?"</p><p>Lavender smiled back. "How about we stay here at Hogwarts? I'm sure your family will understand."</p><p>Parvati shook her head. "Padma wants to go back, and where Padma goes I have to follow."</p><p>This was not news to Lavender, as it was one of the things Parvati had said to her when they had first met. They had both been first-years and were boarding the train to go to Hogwarts for the very first time.</p><p>Lavender had been talking with some other first-years called Terry Boot and Seamus Finnegan. A few minutes into the conversation, a pair of twins had opened the compartment door.</p><p>"Padma! I told you it was occupied!" said one of the twins.</p><p>"Hello," Lavender smiled. "You're welcome to sit here if you'd like. I'm Lavender, and these are Terry and Seamus," she said, pointing at each of them in turn. The boys grumbled and Lavender swore she heard something along the lines of <em>'we can introduce ourselves,'</em> and <em>'bloody girls'</em>. Lavender sent them a glare and they both shuddered.</p><p>Lavender had a <em>mean</em> glare.</p><p>The twin that had talked went first. "Hello, Lavender, I'm Parvati–"</p><p>"And I'm Padma Patil," said the other.</p><p>The girl and the two boys smiled at them. "You can sit if you'd like. We were talking about the Sorting," Terry said.</p><p>Padma tilted her head in a pensive manner. "I'd like to go to either Ravenclaw or Gryffindor, but whichever is fine."</p><p>Parvati nodded. "Yes, Ma and Pitah don't really have a preference, and neither do I. I do hope I go with Padma, of course."</p><p>"I'd like to go to Gryffindor," said Seamus. "Me mum was there when she went to Hogwarts."</p><p>Everyone turned to Lavender, who shrugged in response. "Is it weird I'd like to go to Hufflepuff? I mean, what the House values is actually very important in life: loyalty and justice. Yeah, I like that."</p><p>Parvati looked at her and Lavender felt scrutinized under her stare. Seconds later, she shook her head. "Not really, you look more like a Gryffindor to me."</p><p>"Ah," Lavender said with hint of disbelief. "I don't really know, but okay, I guess."</p><p>Parvati nodded and smiled. Suddenly, Padma stood up and opened the compartment door. "We have to go put on our robes; I'll suggest you do the same. It was nice to meet you though, and I do hope you get sorted in the Houses you like. Come on, Parvati." Padma said, gesturing at her sister to come with her.</p><p>However, Parvati looked somewhat confused and angry. She looked at her sister with the eyes that sent the clear message of 'What are you doing?' Padma's eyes widened and she looked uncomfortable standing by the door.</p><p>"Come on, Parvati. Seriously," she said.</p><p>Parvati sighed and stood up. "Sorry! Wherever Padma goes, I have to follow. I'll see you later!" And with that, both the twins were out of the compartment.</p><p>"Well, <em>that</em> was eventful," said Seamus.</p><p>Lavender laughed. "Very."</p><p>Present-day Lavender smiled at the memory. They had been so young and innocent, and didn't know the hardships that would fill their lives.</p><p>After all, Harry Potter was their classmate and everything around him often became a disaster. Dumbledore had had to cancel the final exams at least three times because of him.</p><p>Parvati noticed Lavender's mind was up in the clouds. Lavender often did tha,t and she looked so peaceful that Parvati almost didn't have the heart to shake her out of it.</p><p>"Lavender," Parvati said, trying to get her attention.</p><p>Her girlfriend turned, wide-eyed, and smiled. "Sorry, Par."</p><p>Parvati laughed and said, "You're so cute." Lavender just blushed.</p>
