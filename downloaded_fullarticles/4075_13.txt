    <p>"<em>Let me tell you something, Killian." Frodo Baggins knelt before his son. "The Sorting Hat will allow you to choose Gryffindor. It takes your choice into account."</em></p><p>"<em>Really?" Killian Baggins said, smiling.</em></p><p>"<em>Yup!" Frodo said, smiling back. He asked, "Are you ready?"</em></p><p>"<em>Yeah. I'm ready, Papa." Killian said, embracing his father.</em></p><p>Killian sighed, remembering this tiny moment between him and his father. He would treasure his time with his parents, who went on a new adventure almost daily. They returned with stories to tell, and were looking forward to their next adventure. Oh, how he wanted to be like them! Every inch of his being felt exhilarated!</p><p>His attention soon returned to the compartment window. Rolling green hills and a bright blue sky filled the atmosphere, giving him a warm sense of hope. The train ride was thrilling! He'd never been on a train before! This was just another new experience, once he was glad to be a part of with his cousins.</p><p>"Killian, are you listening?" Pippin Gamgee, the golden-haired hobbit lad, asked, looking quite serious. He cackled with great delight a moment later. "Of course, you're not! Does Killian have a crush on someone?" He tapped his foot, promptly.</p><p>"Ease up, Pippin!" Faramir Took, the golden-haired hobbit lad, said, chuckling quietly to himself.</p><p>"You have to wonder how your father ever met the Gondorian soldier, Faramir." Killian said, shaking his head and smiling.</p><p>"Gondor was in trouble. My father rushed in to help the people!" Faramir inquired, giddily. "He saved Faramir's life, and disapparated back to the Shire to help my mum." He chuckled again. "Our family has magic in their veins."</p><p>"I'm going to be a proud Gryffindor someday!" Pippin Gamgee said, giddy with excitement.</p><p>"At least my mother didn't have her pregnancy sped up, like your mum did!" Faramir said, bluntly.</p><p>"Now that's just rude." Killian told him, shrewdly.</p><p>Faramir shrugged. "Just telling the facts."</p><p>"Well, let's just hope we meet our new authoresses." Killian said, staring out the compartment window.</p><p>"I agree!" Pippin Gamgee inquired. "I wonder who she'll be."</p><p>"Knowing you, she'll be full of bouncy mischief!" Faramir said, grinning.</p><p>Killian looked at the open compartment door. So far, no one had come to check on them. Maybe he was kidding himself. Maybe he wouldn't get to meet an authoress this year. Maybe it was all a hoax. But he wouldn't be deterred! Hogwarts was his new destination and Hogwarts was where he was going to stay! Brave and noble was Gryffindor house. That's what he would be. Brave… and noble. Now, if he was lucky, he'd find love, like his sister Primula managed to find her hairbrush. It was love like that that wouldn't be ignored—</p><p>"Excuse me?" a red-headed girl asked from the compartment door. She looked friendly. Killian wondered what she wanted. "Is this spot taken? I was told I might find Killian. New routine. The authors get to know their hobbits before the sorting. I was told to find him."</p><p>"Oh." Killian sighed. He really needed to get over that. "You can join us. We won't bite!"</p><p>"Great!" The red-headed girl sat next to him. Killian blushed fervently. "I'm Roxanne Saunders! You must be Killian Baggins! Your family is famous in the Wizardry World. How your father defeated Sauron in his seventh year – ahhh! – oh, how I'd love to meet him up close."</p><p>"Um… right." There were butterflies growing inside Killian's heart. His stomach turned in knots. This was what love felt like? He had to do something. "So, you're the next authoress?"</p><p>"That's right!" Roxanne smiled, innocently. Why was it so hard for him to speak to her? She smelled nice. "Um… gosh, where do I begin?" She added, "I'm thinking about becoming a Ravenclaw. I know it's out of protocol for hobbits and authors to be in opposite houses, but why not? I just might meet my hobbit there!"</p><p>"So, are you a witch or a Muggle-born?" Killian asked, curious.</p><p>"I'm a half-blood." Roxanne said. "You know, my mum's a witch and my dad's a muggle. Actually, it's quite interesting. The new protocol for authors states there are some witches and wizards who have become authors and authoresses, while normal witches and wizards become… well, normal witches and wizards full time. There's something going on with the system that I'm not aware of… hmm… oh well." She stood up, informing him, bluntly, "Well, it was nice meeting you. Maybe we'll meet again sometime!"</p><p>"I guarantee we will." Killian said, watching her leave the compartment. Oh, how he wished she could stay! Roxanne was mysterious and a bit out there, but she meant well. That was the important, right? What else was there?</p>
