          <div class="userstuff"><p>Luna smiles as she excitedly follows the other first years into the great hall, the altercation between the harry potter and the pure blood malfoy long forgotten in her mind </p><p>It was beautiful and she could barely keep from gasping as she glanced around. She found it hard to keep her pace with the other students as she took in every inch of her school and partial new home</p><p>It was every bit as beautiful as her father had described to her and even more so, even her amazing father couldn't capture the beauty that was the great hall in words. The candles sparkled like her eyes, the ceiling shone with thousands of magical stars and promises of what she would learn in her time there. Her heart skipped a beat when her eyes fell upon the proud banners hanging above the great tables and she zoned in on the brilliant blue so familiar to her </p><p>Her family's tradition was in ravenclaw much like the malfoy's being slytherins, the blacks being slytherins or the weasly's being gryffindors. Her father had told her as much but he had also said he'd be proud no matter what house she belonged to and she knew he would be yet her eyes kept drawing back to the brilliant blue </p><p>The magnificent bird that was depicted on the banner seemed to call to her and she blinked when her name was called. She hadn't even noticed that there were only a few people left </p><p>Slowly she walked up the few stairs and smiled softly with excitement, she took note of the weasly's and harry potter now at the gryffindor table and the malfoy boy sitting at the Slytherin table, so far it seemed tradition had won. She had been in her head what seemed like hours but only a second when she heard the hat deliberating above her </p><p>Smiling she swung her feet as she waiting surprisingly not nervous at all, her heart knew where she belonged the second she saw the banner and the hat confirmed this when it shouted ravenclaw only moments later </p><p>Luna had no clue this had all happened in a matter of seconds, almost as fast as the malfoy boy himself had claimed his rightful seat did she claim hers. No luna hadn't even realised, she had been to captivated by the bird in her own mind to notice </p><p>With a smile she took her seat in blue at her rightful table and greeted the ravenclaws who were now her house and soon to be her family</p></div>
