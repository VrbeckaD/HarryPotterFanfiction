<hr/><p align="left">Of course, during the hottest summer Darcy’s ever known, Aunt Petunia decides to completely redo the garden.</p><p>Not that Darcy really minds the work—she’s always enjoyed helping tend the garden, plus Aunt Petunia had let her help pick out flowers and choose what colors to use. And there’s something about having soil and dirt under her nails and sweat dripping down her face and aching knees that makes Darcy feel somewhat at peace. The sunshine feels good after locking herself in her room most of the time, and she has a reason to be proud of herself when she takes a step back to admire her and Aunt Petunia’s work. The one drawback is that the blazing sun makes her fair skin burn and blister painfully, making it uncomfortable to wear clothes or sleep or even move sometimes. But in the garden, neither Vernon or Dudley aren’t around to bother her, and sometimes Aunt Petunia lets Darcy drink lemonade with her under the cool refuge of a shady tree. Aunt Petunia is very knowledgeable about flowers, and she tells Darcy choice gossip about the neighbors—someone’s son had been caught smoking out his bedroom window a few days past, the woman a few doors down has filed for divorce with her husband after catching him in bed with his secretary, and one of their neighbor’s daughters was politely asked to find a new school after she’d bullied multiple girls into not coming back. Darcy is vaguely familiar with the girl, and believes it wholeheartedly.</p><p>And, perhaps best of all about gardening—it keeps her mind off things. Anything to keep her awake, to keep her from slipping into nightmares consisting of Cedric’s surprised expression—handsome, shocked, dirty, and dead; her mother’s beautiful, vacant face; Mrs. Duncan’s cold, unseeing eyes upon a shock-white face. She sees Barty Crouch Junior in her dreams too, sees Moody’s scarred face turning into one much more malicious, younger and wicked, and Peter Pettigrew, the vile rodent he is. Sometimes she dreams of Lupin, and in them he’s touching her and kissing her, and when Darcy wakes from these dreams, she feels very lonely in her bed and very cold and her fingers always twitch, looking for a hand to hold. And sometimes, she even dreams of her father, but he always turns into her mother dropping to the floor after a flash of green light. Darcy always wakes immediately afterwards, disappointed she hadn’t even dreamed of Sirius.</p><p>Most nights, she can hear Harry in his bedroom across the hall, muttering into his pillow about Cedric, calling out for mum and dad in his sleep, tossing and turning in his bed. Only once had he slipped into her bedroom, just like he used to do when he was little and had woken from a strange and muddled dream, seeking comfort from his sister. They’d slept on the floor together, far too old to share a twin bed, but it had been nice to sleep next to someone, even if it was just Harry. And she’s glad that Harry is polite enough not to bring up Darcy’s nightmares; she takes his lead, not bringing up his no matter how badly she wants to.</p><p>In fact, Harry rarely does any talking at all lately, and when he does, he’s short and curt and cold with her. Darcy can’t blame him, but it’s hard to let her brother know she’s here for him to talk to when Harry dismisses her as overbearing for the most part. She knows that he’s getting antsy staying inside, and though Darcy urges him to stay at the house, she doesn’t protest when he occasionally walks to the nearby playground alone, or does a circle around the neighborhood. His words hurt her feelings, but she accepts them and doesn’t argue, hoping that shouting at her will make Harry feel better in the long run.</p><p>And she isn’t sure if it’s just paranoia after everything that’s happened in the past year, but Darcy sometimes feels as if she’s being watched. Sometimes, even when she’s just sitting in the backyard, soaking up the sun and reading a book, she feels eyes on the back of her head and the hair on her arms and the back of her neck stands up. She still hasn’t caught anyone watching, but the feeling makes her uncomfortable enough. Darcy always wonders if Voldemort knows they’re at Privet Drive, and whenever a streetlight goes out, or there’s a rustling in a hedge, she half expects Death Eaters to jump out and kill her without warning. At night, Darcy fears looking out her window, afraid she’ll find a few hooded figures walking down the street, searching for her and her brother. Once, she’d heard a loud <em>CRACK</em>! and the noise scared her so much, she’d pulled her wand out in view of Petunia, her chest heaving. Aunt Petunia had convinced her warily it was only a backfiring car and hissed at her about her wand until she was red in the face, but Darcy only half-believed her.</p><p>Max comes and goes as he pleases, keeping her company during the day, even when he just sleeps. Vernon had given her a thump on the back of the head upon finding out Darcy allows Max out of his cage in her bedroom, but she hates seeing him in his cage. But, unfortunately, tonight he’ll be gone, off sending a letter to Sirius. Darcy had been too afraid to send any letters to Gemma, for fear that her parents would read them or someone far worse would get their hands on them. And as much as she she wants to write to Lupin just for reassurance that everything would be all right, she had refrained. She doesn’t want to come across as pathetic and pining—desperate. Darcy had been in half a mind to write to Hermione or Mr. Weasley, just for <em>someone</em> to correspond to, but she’d wanted to write to Sirius first. Not that she really knows her godfather all that well, but she has a hard time believing he wouldn’t respond to a desperate letter begging for someone to rescue her.</p><p>“Mrs. Dursley!”</p><p>Darcy and Aunt Petunia look over their shoulders at the sound of bicycle tires sliding to a stop on the gravelly sidewalk. A tall, strapping boy leans his thin bike against the fence that encircles the front yard, letting himself in. Darcy thinks he looks half familiar, but can’t place him. She looks him over as he approaches Aunt Petunia with a smile, revealing dazzling white teeth. Both women get to their feet; Aunt Petunia takes her gloves off, but Darcy claps the dirt off her bare hands.</p><p>“My aunt said to come say hello,” he says, wrapping Aunt Petunia in a warm hug. Darcy thinks it’s an odd scene, having never seen her hug anyone besides Dudley, and even then, Dudley’s always squirming in her thin arms. “I’ve come to visit for the summer.”</p><p>“How you’ve grown!” Aunt Petunia says, holding him at arm's length and inspecting him critically. “You’ve finished at Eton, then? How long has it been?”</p><p>“I’ve been finished with Eton for years,” the boy replies, laughing and pushing his golden hair out of his eyes. Up close, the boy is barely taller than Darcy is. “I’m returning for my last year at Cambridge this fall.”</p><p>“What are you studying?” The way Aunt Petunia asks him, Darcy imagines a lot is hanging on his answer.</p><p>“Law,” he answers, quite humbly, and still smiling.</p><p>“There’s a good boy.” For the boy’s sake, Darcy is glad Aunt Petunia is pleased with his career choice. “You remember my niece? Darcy, do you remember Gavin?”</p><p>“It’s been a while,” Gavin says, holding out a hand to Darcy. She brushes the excess dirt off her palm on the front of her shirt, which she realizes too late displeases her aunt, but Gavin shakes her hand all the same. “You look, er—you’ve grown. I think the last time I saw you, you and your brother were running around stark naked and swimming in the creek.”</p><p>Aunt Petunia purses her lips, fighting the urge to say something nasty about Harry and the situation, no doubt. But the memory makes Darcy remember the boy with a start—Gavin Coldwell. She’d been maybe six or seven at the time, as Harry had barely been able to hold a full conversation, and Gavin had just barely been a teenager. He’d been riding by the creek on his bike, and he’d laughed as Darcy splashed him, yelling at him to go away. But the young Gavin she remembers had been slightly heavier—perhaps not as heavy as Dudley, or even half as heavy as Dudley—but his face had been round and flushed, and his hair had always been cut short. Though he had been nice to her, if not annoying at times. He often visited over weekends that he was able to get away from Eton, and he’d tease her and tickle her all in good fun when he’d see her at the playground she frequented, always sneaking her and Harry candy and other small treats. Sometimes his aunt would bring him by for tea with Aunt Petunia, and he’d always pull funny faces while she read them poetry.</p><p>This Gavin Coldwell is handsome—so handsome that looking at him makes Darcy’s cheeks pink. His shoulders and neck are thick with muscle, and Darcy imagines that under his clothes, he’s muscular, as well. Gavin is cleanly shaven, giving his face a boyish youthfulness to it, though Darcy thinks he’d look ten years older and slightly more handsome with a beard. Aunt Petunia told Darcy long ago that Gavin’s family came from old money and lived in an estate in Beaconsfield, which one day would be his, and while Darcy hasn’t met many extremely wealthy people being cooped up at Privet Drive for many years, she has to admit that Gavin looks wealthy—the way he dresses, the expensive bike leaning against the fence, the easy confidence and natural good looks.</p><p>“I’m sorry you had to see that,” Darcy chuckles, burning with embarrassment at the idea that Gavin remembers her as a dirty, naked girl swimming in the creek. “Not my finest moment, but an honest one. Please don’t hold it against me.”</p><p>This makes Gavin smile, his pale green eyes glittering in the sun. At the right angle, with the sun hitting his golden hair, the sight of him takes her breath away. Darcy wonders what it would feel like to be so beautiful.</p><p>Aunt Petunia clears her throat. “Would you like to come in for a cup of tea?” she asks sweetly, giving Darcy a sideways look. “I’ll have Darcy wash up and put a kettle on to boil. I’m sure I could find some leftover biscuits from yesterday, if you don’t mind.”</p><p>“A very kind and tempting offer, Mrs. Dursley,” Gavin smiles, giving Darcy a sideways glance. “However, I’m due for tea with Mrs. Nace in about fifteen minutes and I’m afraid I’ve already taken up too much of your time. Tell Vernon I said hello, would you?”</p><p>“Come by for supper one evening. Vernon would be delighted to see you.” Aunt Petunia receives a kiss on the cheek from Gavin, making Darcy frown. She hastily rearranges her features before anyone can see her face.</p><p>“It’s been a while since I’ve been here, but it all seems very much the same, doesn’t it? I used to enjoy summers here,” Gavin explains, smiling kindly at Darcy. “Mum and dad are on holiday at the moment, and it’s quite lonely at the house without them.” Before he turns to leave, he touches his left cheek, chuckling at Darcy. “You’ve got some dirt there, on your cheek.”</p><p>As Gavin mounts his bicycle and goes to leave, he turns and waves to Darcy. Aunt Petunia can’t seem to make up her mind—she looks stuck, on the verge of telling Darcy off for watching him go so intently, but the other half of her (if Darcy knows Aunt Petunia’s intentions—which she thinks she does) probably would be happy to have Darcy run after him, begging him to marry her and breed her like some animal. In fact, Darcy does almost run after him—the closest thing to a friend she might possibly be able to have here at Privet Drive.</p><p>As Harry continues to spiral into isolation, Darcy finds life at Privet Drive unbearable for most of the beginning of summer. He refuses to leave his room most times, locking his door, having Darcy bring him food instead of eating with her in the kitchen. Darcy could easily unlock the door with a quick, simple spell, and she’s sure Harry knows that, but she decides to respect his privacy. And everyday, without fail, Gavin rides by on his bicycle, waving to them most days and stopping for a quick chat other days.</p><p>“You don’t still swim naked, do you?” he asks innocently one day, and Aunt Petunia nearly chokes upon hearing it. His familiar grin spreads wide across his face.</p><p>“You’ll be happy to know that I’ve since kicked the habit,” Darcy answers with a shy smile, shaking her head and returning to the garden. “You’re distracting me, Gavin. Can’t you see how hard I’m working on the garden?”</p><p>“And a wonderful garden it is,” Gavin says, mounting his bike again. “See you later, Mrs. Dursley.” He inclines his head politely when Darcy looks at him again. “Darcy.”</p><p>Harry doesn’t seem to find Darcy’s talk of Gavin so interesting. Not that she has much to say about him, but whenever he stops by, she details his visit to Harry before bed—<em>he helped mulch today when Aunt Petunia and I grew tired; he fixed the broken shutter today; he told me I looked pretty today</em>. Harry grunts a response most times, almost looking resentful. “And what about Lupin?” he asks her one night.</p><p>Darcy narrows her eyes, hurt. “It’s not like that.” Scoffing, Darcy shakes her head. “Remus has nothing to do with this.”</p><p>His answer is another grunt. Darcy thinks he’s going to leave it at that, but Harry sits up straight on his bed, looking angry. “You’re not even going to try and make up with him?”</p><p>“I’m sorry,” Darcy tells him breathlessly, her heart aching painfully. “I don’t even know if he wants to—” When she starts to cry again, Harry seems to soften a bit, realizing the harshness of his words, but he struggles to find words of comfort that actually soothe Darcy.</p><p>And yet, Darcy finds that, despite her and Gavin not being technically real friends, it’s nice to have someone around her age to talk to, and someone who is not Aunt Petunia, Vernon, or Dudley. While Gavin is a few years older than her, there’s something youthful about him—the mischievous twinkle in his eyes when he looks at her while speaking to Aunt Petunia, the way he bounces on his feet when he speaks—the inability to stay still, the impish yet innocent grin always on his face. It all reminds her of Ludo Bagman, and whenever she thinks of Ludo Bagman, her heart starts to ache, the familiar feelings of disappointment and loneliness creeping up to take her suddenly.</p><p>She thinks of Ludo Bagman more than she thought she ever would. <em>Maybe he’s not dead, but he still left me</em>. Harry had told her the truth of what happened—he’d cheated Fred and George out of their winnings with leprechaun gold. So deep in debt with goblins, Ludo couldn’t pay them back, and placed a bet on Harry winning the Triwizard Tournament, but that hadn’t gone as planned, for the goblins had claimed Harry wasn’t the <em>only</em> winner like Ludo Bagman had bet on. <em>He used my brother, she thinks every time. He used my brother, helped him because he wanted the winnings of his bet, not because he cared about me</em>. But sometimes when she lies in bed, just on the verge of sleep, she can almost feel phantom hands on her cheeks, phantom lips on her forehead, and it all comforts her, lulling her to sleep.</p><p>“The garden looks wonderful, truly,” Gavin says one day, walking his bicycle to the front of the walkway. “I’ll have to tell my aunt you’ve added some Begonias. They’re her favorite.”</p><p>Aunt Petunia flushes with pride at the compliment.</p><p>“You could have one,” Darcy smiles, bending down to cut one the freshly planted flowers. Gavin accepts it from her with a grin. “You could give it to your aunt.”</p><p>“It’s beautiful,” he murmurs, holding it up to examine it. “Maybe I’ll keep it for myself.”</p><p>“It’s not for <em>you</em>,” Darcy teases.</p><p>He returns the next day with a planter of new Begonias. Carrying them over to the garden, Gavin tells her, “To replace the one I took. She loved it, by the way.” But Darcy barely registers what he says, too busy admiring his thick arms and his straining biceps, shimmering with sweat.</p><p>Another day, Aunt Petunia convinces Gavin to stay for a glass of lemonade. They drink it in the backyard under the shade of a tree, and Gavin is full of false-sounding compliments for Aunt Petunia. Her aunt laughs a high-pitched laugh, and Darcy even sees her cheekbones turn pink when Gavin compliments her new haircut. Vernon comes out as Gavin finishes his drink, and he reminisces about his days at Smeltings (which, according to Vernon, is a much better school than Eton, which Darcy doesn’t quite think is true judging by the side eye look that Gavin gives her), asking about Eton and Cambridge, and debating for a moment about rugby. Gavin gives Vernon a respectable and firm handshake and bids them all goodbye. The three of them watch him go curiously, eyes fixed on him.</p><p>“A fine boy, that Gavin,” Vernon says to Aunt Petunia, not paying Darcy any attention. “Just like our Dudders, isn’t he?”</p><p>Petunia glows at the thought. At this, Darcy can’t keep quiet anymore. She gives the back of Vernon’s head an incredulous look. “<em>No</em>,” she retorts, as if this is the most obvious thing in the world.</p><p>The single word earns her a sharp backhand, and her cheek stings painfully, her hand jumping up to cradle her face. Tears well in her eyes, but she says no more and nearly runs back into the house when Aunt Petunia tells her to go to her room.</p><p>Once, when Gavin stops by while Aunt Petunia’s inside, he asks, “How is that brother of yours? What was his name again? I never see him. Is he still attached to your hip?”</p><p>“Harry. And he’s fourteen,” Darcy answers with a slight smile. “Of course he’s not.”</p><p>“Is he still fond of sweets?” Gavin raises an eyebrow, smirking. “If I bring some, will it lure him out of the house? I’d like to see him proper. A man now, is he?”</p><p>“Harry’s not been feeling well,” Darcy lies—it’s only a half-lie, really. “Maybe another time.”</p><p>“He’s not mad, is he?”</p><p>Darcy blinks in surprise, bristling. “He’s not mad,” she hisses. “Why would you even suggest that?”</p><p>“I didn’t think he was,” Gavin confesses, looking apologetic. “You know how everyone gossips. My aunt is the worst, I swear it. I didn’t mean any offense.”</p><p>“Aunt Petunia’s not much better,” Darcy admits, wrapping her arms around herself and glancing over her shoulder to make sure they’re still alone. They share a soft laugh. “I try to take everything she says with a grain of salt.”</p><p>Gavin hums, considering her. “You’re not like her—your aunt. You’re different from the other girls round here.”</p><p>“I don’t think you quite understand what that means to me.” His statement puts her at ease. “How so?”</p><p>“I’m not quite sure yet.”</p><p>Sometimes after she wakes from a nightmare alone, listening to Harry’s bed groaning under his constant tossing and turning, Darcy wonders what it would be like to have Gavin touch her. The urge to be held, to be touched and kissed and comforted grows strong without Lupin around. With Harry being so distant, it’s harder to find joy with the Dursleys at all. Harry had always been her strength and her happiness while stuck at Privet Drive, and she isn’t sure what to do about him anymore. She’d tried to be the kind of person <em>she</em> needed while grieving—affectionate and reassuring and comforting and warm—but Harry hadn’t been very receiving to it. He wanted the distance, wanted to be left to his thoughts. She cherishes the small moments they do share—eating ice cream from the tub in her room one night, her reading Gemma’s findings of her experiment aloud to Harry straight from the <em>Daily Prophet</em>, playing chess in silence after dinner.</p><p>So Darcy begins to find solace in conversations with Gavin, stolen moments while Aunt Petunia is distracted. Part of her is wary—after all, he’s very much from Aunt Petunia and Vernon’s world, the very world Darcy wants absolutely no part of. The mere fact that Aunt Petunia and Vernon are so charmed by him slightly repulses Darcy, but at the same time, he’s the only other person besides Harry she enjoys talking to, and he’s willing enough to talk to her.</p><p>Aunt Petunia finally talks Gavin into having dinner with them one night, and they make plans for a few nights out. Before Gavin leaves, he asks with a genuine smile, “Will Harry be there? I’ve been looking forward to seeing him again.”</p><p>Darcy’s eyes go wide and she looks quickly at Aunt Petunia. Darcy half expects her to withdraw the offer immediately. Aunt Petunia’s lips are pursed, but then she forces herself to smile. “Of course.”</p><p>So two nights later, after a loud argument in which Vernon had shouted about Harry not joining them for dinner, he had grudgingly given in at his wife’s request, afraid that Gavin may find something <em>unusual</em> if Harry were not with them. The single word had been Vernon’s undoing. And so Harry sits with them, his hair combed (but still sticking up in the back), across the table from Darcy and Gavin, beside Dudley.</p><p>Dinner is less awkward than she’d originally thought. Vernon and Gavin talk most of the time, and Petunia urges Darcy to continue refilling Gavin’s wine glass. The first time she does it, he cuts off in the middle of his sentence, surprising Vernon, thanks her politely and with a smile. The second time she goes to refill it, Gavin puts his hand over his glass, and Darcy frowns, feeling she’s done something wrong.</p><p>“No more, thank you,” he says, not unkindly. “I can refill my own glass—I would not expect you to.” Gavin takes the bottle from Darcy’s hands and refills her own glass, then his, before returning to the conversation.</p><p>Vernon and Petunia exchange a long, uneasy look, and Darcy suddenly feels much more at ease with Gavin than ever before. <em>He does not expect me to be another Aunt Petunia. He really is my friend</em>. And a friend is such a sweet thing to have right now, she thinks.</p><p>Gavin even speaks with Harry over dinner. He asks about his interests, and when Harry is unable to give him a solid one, Darcy tells him, “Harry’s quite good at chess,” she supplies, smiling at Harry. “He always beats me.”</p><p>“I used to enjoy playing chess when I was your age,” Gavin says, leaning slightly forward towards Harry. “We should play a match or two sometime. Maybe I’ll pick it up again. You can give me some pointers.”</p><p>Harry sits up a little straighter in his chair and clears his throat. “Sure. I’d like that.”</p><p>Vernon gives him a sharp look.</p><p>Aunt Petunia does make Darcy walk Gavin out. She doesn’t mind, and follows him outside to his bicycle. As soon as the door shuts behind them, it’s a weight lifted off Darcy’s shoulders. “Dinner was wonderful,” Gavin sighs contently, patting his stomach. “Did you cook, Darcy?”</p><p>“Only the roast,” she says, blushing. “It was nothing.”</p><p>Gavin gives her a mischievous grin, throwing a leg over his bike. “The roast was my favorite part,” he tells her in a low voice. “Nice dress. Your aunt make you wear it?”</p><p>“Why? Is it horrible?” Darcy flattens the dress quickly, feeling suddenly very gangly and awkward.</p><p>He laughs. “It’s nice. But I think I like you better with dirt on your face.” Considering her, he continues. “Why don’t I take you out sometime?”</p><p>Darcy flushes a deep crimson. “Gavin,” she scoffs, wetting her lips. “There are things you don’t know about me.”</p><p>“I’m sure,” he shrugs. “Have you ever killed anyone?”</p><p>“No,” she answers, and it makes her laugh weakly. “No, I’ve never killed anyone.”</p><p>“Do you have some secret lover I don’t know about?”</p><p>“No,” she says again, frowning. “I just—I’m not ready to—” Darcy sighs deeply. “Things just ended between me and someone, and I’m not quite ready for anything.”</p><p>“Was it messy?” Gavin asks, sympathetic.</p><p>She shrugs. “No, not really. Just sad.”</p><p>“Look, my aunt’s hosting a garden party next Friday. I’ve told them about you, and they want you to come. Your aunt, too.” Gavin grins. “At least come to that.”</p><p>Darcy hesitates. “I shouldn’t.”</p><p>“Why not?” Gavin asks, looking more curious than accusing. He tilts his head to the side, like a lost puppy dog. “Some of my mates will be there. I’ll introduce you. Consider it a thank you for having me to dinner.”</p><p>“We’ll see.”</p><p>When she brings the idea of going to a garden party to Harry later that night, he scowls. “That’s not you,” he snaps.</p><p>“I know it’s not, but—I feel that he’s the only friend I’ve got around here sometimes. He’s not bad. He’s not like the Dursleys.”</p><p>“<em>I’m</em> your friend.”</p><p>“Friends talk to each other.” Darcy grinds her teeth, waiting for an answer, but Harry only waits for her to continue. “You haven’t done much of that lately.”</p><p>“Neither have you,” Harry growls, his face darkening. He looks much older than fourteen in the moment. “I hear you crying at night, don’t think I don’t listen. You thrash at night in your bed and cry over Lupin, and suddenly you want to go to a <em>garden party</em> with Gavin and Petunia?”</p><p>Darcy blushes furiously. “I thought it would be fun. Don’t I deserve that much at least?”</p><p>“Right,” he huffs, standing up from his seat upon Darcy’s bed. “Petunia’s always liked you, hasn’t she? They didn’t even want me eating dinner with them, but she’ll take you to a <em>garden party</em>.”</p><p>“You’re hurting my feelings.”</p><p>Harry softens instantly, but doesn’t say anymore. He walks out without another word. Darcy doesn’t sleep easy that night, hearing Harry’s muffled moans through the walls, listening to him talk, over and over and over again—“Cedric—Cedric—<em>no</em>—”</p><p>The ruffle of feathers is all that alerts Darcy to Max’s presence. There’s a letter tied to his leg from Sirius, and Darcy pulls it off quickly. She’s quite glad that he’s so receptive to her, as once she had begged him not to hoot—for fear of angering Vernon—he’d stopped immediately. As Harry drifts back into a soundless sleep, Darcy turns her desk lamp on to read the letter and searches for paper and a pen to write her response.</p><p>
  <em>Darcy,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I can’t say much. Stay where you are and be on watch. Take care of Harry. We’ll see each other again soon.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Padfoot</em>
</p><p>Darcy feels a great sense of disappointment. He hadn’t even signed it like he always does—with love. She pushes the letter aside and begins to write her own.</p><p>
  <em>Remus,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I’m asking you to take me at my word, but any questions you have after this letter, I’ll gladly answer in person. This house is driving me mad and Harry is lost in grief. I don’t know what to do. I am alone and I need to leave. Please get me out of here.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Darcy</em>
</p><p>She wants to write <em>I love you, I love you, I want to come home</em>, but Max takes off with the letter tied to his leg without any such words of love.</p>
