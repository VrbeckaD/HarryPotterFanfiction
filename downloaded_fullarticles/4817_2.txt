    <p>
  <span>He’d always heard that smell was the easiest to get acclimated to, but still, he’d find himself catching whiffs of the dead. While usually scent blind, these moments would throw him off his guard, catapulting him back to the very beginning, when the infection first hit. He never used to know what decomposition smelled like. What surprised him the most was how quickly it came on. Bodies started piling up along the streets not long after the first outbreak, the brains oozing from the backs of skulls, and not twelve hours later did the whole city reek of death.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He was used to bodies now.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They had become a permanent decoration to the landscape, bloating, emitting that familiar perfume. It was the worst when it rained. The droplets eroded away bits of flesh and washed them into the sewer system and into the ground. Still, he no longer mourned the dead—the </span>
  <em>
    <span>truly</span>
  </em>
  <span> dead, who lay still in their resting places and remained that way. In fact, he almost envied the them. For the dead, there was no war to fight; no limbo to exist in.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Envy was easier on his conscience, when a bullet or a blow pierced the brain of a stranger, and the killshot was his own.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>But still there were these moments, trampling through the forest among half dead bodies sinking into the soil, where the smell of rot grabbed at him like clawed fingers, and he was forced to remember the world as it now was—as it was going to remain. He functioned now under three rules, and three rules only:</span>
</p><p> </p>
<ol>
<li><span>Stay alive.</span></li>
<li><span>Keep the ones you love alive.</span></li>
<li><span>Disregard rule one, if it means enforcing rule two.</span></li>
</ol><p> </p><p>
  <span>It wasn’t much of a life, but life was the only thing he had left to hold onto, so hold onto it he did, with a white-knuckle grip.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We’ve got word from the Prewett brothers,” James said in lieu of a greeting, as Sirius made his way back to the campsite with an armful of firewood. “Peter found this raiding the grocer’s this morning.” James held out a crumpled piece of paper. Sirius dropped the wood beside the firepit and took it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>‘</span>
  <em>
    <span>To any Heartbeaters who may find this:</span>

</p><p> </p><p>

    <span>North infiltrated with Deadheads. Stay south, or risk loss of flesh (and, you know, life). Rendezvous at The Burrow scheduled two weeks from Tuesday, assuming there still remains a Burrow to rendezvous at, or anyone to rendezvous with. If attending, be sure to make yourself appear as alive as possible, or risk being shot on sight. Have a wonderful and bite free day!</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>-F&amp;G Prewett</span>
  </em>
  <span>’</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That’s a six day trek south, assuming we don’t run into any trouble,” said Sirius, handing the paper back to James. “And what day is today? I’ve lost track.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Friday,” said James, pocketing the letter in his muddy jeans. “Which means we must be the only Living around here, if no one has found that letter until now.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“At least any Living that’s bothered to try looting the city,” Sirius said. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but there’s not a whole lot of wildlife around here that the Deadheads haven’t already gotten to, and most of the plants are poisonous. If there was anyone out there not stealing food and water from the city, then I can’t imagine they’re out there anymore.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>While logically he knew that James was being practical, it still sent a pang through his gut to hear his best friend talk so callously about death.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“The Prewett brothers could have left more than one note,” Sirius suggested. “They’ve got to know they’ve got more than just one or two Living out here waiting to hear from them. I mean, every damn Heartbeater left in England is following their lead.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“And yet no one even knows who they are,” James said bitterly. Sirius frowned.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Do you not trust them now?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I didn’t say that. I just think it’s a dick move to get all the Living to cling to one thread of hope that maybe there’s some inkling of a civilization left out there, but to never help them get there.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What do you mean they never help? We wouldn’t even know about The Burrow if it weren’t for the Prewett brothers,” said Sirius. James shrugged.</span>
</p><p> </p><p><span>“They leave notes behind, but they never show their faces. They expect us to pass the news, even though we don’t know where the rest of the Heartbeaters are half the time. They’re treating our lives like a Goddamn scavenger hunt. We don’t even know if The Burrow is a real place. We’ve got a point on a map that could</span> <span>lead to nothing. We’re throwing all our eggs in one basket. That’s all I’m saying.” </span></p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So what? Do you not want to go? You want to just keep living in the forest until the Flesh Biters get here and we have to fight for our lives—</span>
  <em>
    <span>again</span>
  </em>
  <span>—just the three of us?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No,” said James in a small voice. He kicked at one of the stones that surrounded the firepit. “No, we’ll go, of course we’ll go. I just don’t think I can handle any more disappointment if this turns out to be another fucking dead end.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sirius knew what he meant. Not two weeks prior they came across yet another promised safe house that was overrun. They escaped, but not without a whole new wealth of scars. James got his ankle caught and twisted in a wire fence, and necessitated they stay stationary in the woods, as they tried to nurse him back to health. It was only over the past few days that the swelling went down and remained down with weight pressed on it, and he was finally able to walk without a noticeable limp.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>There was, after all, no point in even trying to travel if you weren’t able to run. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It won’t be a dead end,” said Sirius with more certainty than he felt. “We’ll meet the other Heartbeaters. We’ll be able to help each other—we’re not going to be alone anymore. Maybe they’ll even have medicine.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He said the last bit pointedly, and James sighed. The medicine issue was pressing. Peter developed a cough over the past weekend, which he insisted was nothing, but was getting progressively worse with each passing day. The pharmacies were the first places to be raided. The trio had a few tablets of cough medicine and antihistamines, and a single bottle of aspirin, but the strong stuff—narcotics and antibiotics—were gone just days after civilization fell. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Pete’s asleep right now,” said James in response. “He was choking half to death when he got back from the city. It’s lucky he didn’t run into any Deadheads, ‘cause he would’ve drawn them right to him.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We’ve got to try to get to The Burrow, man,” Sirius said softly. “We’re too wounded to be out here alone. You’re barely on your feet, Pete’s probably got pneumonia, and I can only get us so far. You know what happens to the wounded, James, you’ve seen it, just like I have.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>James clicked his tongue a couple of times, and ran a hand through his wild mane of natural hair. “Can you get the fire going?” he deflected. “Pete actually found a container of chicken liver, and we still have a shitton of beans.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Delicious,” said Sirius, deadpanned, but he didn’t argue further. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Within fifteen minutes he had a healthy fire raging. It was almost funny for him to think that less than a year ago he didn’t have the faintest clue on how to survive in the wild. Back then, back Before, someone could have given him an entire can of lighter fluid and an infinite supply of matches, and he still wouldn’t have been able to get a fire going longer than a few minutes. He was perversely delighted to imagine how his parents would react to seeing him like this: rips in his shirt and pants, his shoes caked in mud. He hadn’t cut his hair since all this started, and his face was covered in a constant, uneven amount of stubble he tried to manage with the dull blade of knife. He had dirt in between his cracked nails, and sweat stains on his back and under his arms. He hardly noticed anymore. He’d adapted.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He slid slimy chicken livers onto the longest sticks he could find, and held them over the flames as though it were an ordinary campfire cookout. He was used to his fair share of unorthodox foods. His parents forced expensive concoctions on him from a young age—fish eggs, snails swimming in butter, assortments of smelly cheeses (and yet still somehow insisted that crisps were a culinary disaster). But while he wasn’t that picky, and certainly didn’t fancy himself a connoisseur of fine dining, he never did get the taste for liver. In fact, he loathed it, and holding liver kebabs over an open fire, he found he was struck with conflicting emotions: absolute disgust, and palpable, desperate hunger, his body aching for the protein and nutrients it lacked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He let the livers sit above the fire a little too long, hoping the burnt bits would overpower the texture and flavor he abhorred. He slid them off the stick onto a used piece of aluminum foil, and sat them aside while he waited for the beans to heat up. He turned his attention to a bag of miscellaneous grocery items, and began rifling through it in search of some sort of seasoning.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They had salt, but a finite amount, and it was too valuable to waste on something as trivial as distaste. They had somehow amassed two cylindrical containers of cinnamon, and a partially ripped open bag of brown sugar, both of which were useless. They used to have garlic powder—which had saved many a meal since the outbreak—but it fell out of the bag during the last time they were overrun, and Peter accidentally trampled it. Too bad, James joked later as he sat over a bland and overcooked potato, that zombies weren’t deterred by garlic the way vampires were.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Finally, Sirius happened on a single, yellow packet of generic brand taco seasoning. He ripped it open, gave it a whiff, and sprinkled it liberally over the liver before he could think too hard about it. He grabbed the two cans of beans he sat on the edge of the fire, tossing them back and forth between his hands, hissing through his teeth as the tin on the outside of the cans were hot to the touch.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Dinner’s served, you wankers,” he called, wiping his dripping forehead with the back of his hand after he’d finished bashing the cans open with a large rock. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>James, who was keeping watch on the south side of camp, ambled toward him, seeming a bit off-balance. Sirius frowned.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Your ankle acting up?” he asked, and James shrugged.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I can handle it,” he deflected, and he took a seat on a log before Sirius could argue further.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Peter emerged from the tent a moment later, his skin an ashy grey, and his cheeks hollow, as though he’d lost a lot of weight in a short period of time. He’d always been the pudgier of the three, carrying baby fat right up into his late teens, but now that was gone. Instead, his previously plump cheeks now sported patches of dirty blonde stubble, and dark circles surrounded his eyes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Smells alright,” he said when he approached them, his voice hoarse from all the coughing. He sat down beside James.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Probably tastes awful,” Sirius admitted, trying not to look as worried as he felt, watching Peter shudder and rub his arms while he leaned forward to get closer to the warmth of the fire. “How’re you feeling?” Sirius asked, attempting nonchalance.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Fine,” Peter said, his tone the exact same as James’. “I can handle it.” Sirius sighed. Instead of fighting, he turned to heap some liver and beans onto old, crusty plastic plates. He handed one to both of his friends.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Enjoy,” he said in a voice that sounded more like an apology. He grimaced down at his own plate, settling down next to Peter.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Blech,” said James after taking a generous bite. “The fuck did you put on these?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Taco seasoning,” Sirius said without looking up. He got a piece of liver and scooped up a heap of beans to go with it to cut the taste. He spooned it into his mouth in one bite, and he practically swallowed it all whole.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s disgusting, mate,” James said casually, picking up another piece between two fingers, and plugging his nose before putting it in his mouth.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’re welcome to do the cooking, my dearest,” said Sirius pointedly, at which James sneered. “Then no complaining,” Sirius said to this nonverbal objection. “Besides, it doesn't’ matter how it tastes, just so long as we eat something.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He could just feel his parents’ derision at such a statement, and it willed him to take another bite.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Mm, I suppose,” James said. “I don’t think we’ve had any meat to eat since you came across those field mice, right?” Sirius nodded, scowling at the memory. “Yeah, well, good find then, I guess, Pete.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sirius looked to Peter, who was poking at his food with his finger, decidedly not eating it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Come on, Pete, it’s not </span>
  <em>
    <span>that</span>
  </em>
  <span> bad,” said Sirius, nudging his shoulder.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I know,” said Peter in his scratchy voice. “Just not hungry, is all.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You gotta eat, man,” said James with his mouth full.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, you more than us,” Sirius agreed. Peter just looked down at his full plate, and Sirius thought he saw him turn a faint shade of green against the ashy grey. Sirius reached over and put a hand to Peter’s forehead. “Shit,” he muttered, glancing up at James and sharing a significant look. He took the plate out of Peter’s hands. “Here, why don’t you go lay down. I’ll bring you some water here in a minute.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Peter, who didn’t so much as blink when Sirius felt his forehead or took his food, said nothing. He merely coughed into the crook of his elbow, and then nodded his assent. He stood up, teetering, and then trudged back to the tent, as though lifting his feet all the way off the ground was just too much effort to exert.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“How bad?” James asked as soon as Peter was out of earshot.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Burning up,” said Sirius. “We should give him some of the aspirin, see if that brings it down at all.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s not gonna matter if he’s got some kind of infection. Aspirin won’t cut it if what he needs are antibiotics.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hopefully it’s just a bad cold,” Sirius said, but he wouldn’t meet James’ eye. A cold is what Peter had a few days ago—what they were dealing with now was what happened when a cold went unchecked in a world where a single bottle of aspirin was all the medicine there was to treat it. Sirius knew it, and so did James.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“And if it’s not?” asked James morosely, and Sirius felt that pang again.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Then we take him to The Burrow and hope they can help.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That’s nearly two weeks from now. Assuming whatever this is doesn’t get any worse, how do you expect to transfer him when he can’t go more than a few steps without hacking his guts out? We’d last about two seconds out there with the Flesh Biters.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Do you have a better idea?” Sirius snapped. “Should we just leave him here and let him cough himself to death?” James had the decency to look apologetic.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m just trying to be realistic,” he said in a calmer tone. “We just need to start hypothesizing all our options and all the possible outcomes so that we’re prepared.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It had been like this from the start.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>James was rational, logical, and about ten steps ahead of every situation, always thinking of all the pros and cons to every new challenge. Sirius was the idealist, taking each day as it came, and hoping somehow it would all work out in the end. Each way of thinking had its benefits. James managed to keep them out of a lot of stupid, headfirst decisions by being able to foresee the consequences, meanwhile Sirius’ knack for spontaneous action had gotten them out of a few close calls when James froze up. The problem, of course, was that reality functioned somewhere in between their polarizing personalities, and this wasn’t a reality that provided a lot of leeway for butting heads and arguments. They needed someone to balance them. Peter was no good; he always went along with whoever sounded the most stern at the moment.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We’ll give him the aspirin, and see where we’re at tomorrow,” Sirius said definitively. James chewed on the inside of his cheek, and Sirius could see a million different scenarios going through his head of how ‘waiting until tomorrow’ could go horribly wrong, but to James’ credit, he kept them to himself.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We’ll figure something out,” Sirius said, and while he knew they were just empty words to James if he couldn’t provide any evidence to back it, he felt the words were more for his own benefit anyhow. “We’re going to be okay.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>James, he realized, wasn’t even paying attention. He was looking over Sirius’ shoulder, suddenly alert, lifting his head up like a deer listening for an approaching predator. Sirius turned to see what James was eyeing, finding his gaze fixed on the trodden on grass leading into the woods.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What is it?” Sirius whispered, but James held up his hand, silencing him. Sirius stiffened, holding his breath while he listened intently for any sounds. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>SNAP!</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A twig along the treeline snapped under the weight of something. Sirius and James exchanged a glance. Wordlessly, Sirius reached down and pulled out the sharp knife he kept on the side of his boot, while James took his handmade bow off his shoulder, and armed it with an arrow.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>James gestured to the right side of the pathway, and then at himself, and Sirius took it to mean James wanted them to split up and take either side to better their chances at overpowering whatever was lurking behind the shadows of the trees. It was a common strategy of theirs; hadn’t died yet. Sirius nodded, and began to creep towards the left while James went right. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It was dim out. Night hadn’t yet fallen, but dusk was in full force, and Sirius squinted, trying to get his eyes to adjust. He had long since mastered the art of the sneak attack. Without even thinking about it, he maneuvered through the grass, avoiding twigs and rocks and anything else that had the potential to give away his position. He gripped his knife in a tight fist, and held it out in front of himself as he approached the treeline. He watched for signs of movement, as James, just a short distance away, did the same. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He saw nothing. He glanced at James, who nodded, raising his bow and arrow. Sirius took the cue, and, like ripping off a bandaid, moved a large, low-hanging branch, and poised his knife, ready to stab anything that was revealed behind the leaves. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>There was nobody, but still, there was something. Sirius lowered his knife to his side, eyebrows furrowing in confusion.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Instead of coming face to face with one of the flesh eaters, the duo happened upon what appeared to be a gift basket. Of sorts.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It was a small, clear, plastic tote, filled with a variety of items. From what Sirius could make out, there seemed to be a few cans of mandarin oranges, a first aid kit, some juice boxes, and an umbrella. If there was anything else, it was too dark to tell. He looked up at James, who seemed just as lost as he was. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What the fuck?” James mouthed, and Sirius shrugged. He inched closer to that James could hear him whisper.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Was it left here deliberately?” he asked as loudly as he dared. Now it was James who shrugged.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I mean, it’s right next to the pathway we go in and out of every day,” he whispered back. “There’s no way we wouldn’t see it. You didn’t come across it earlier when you gathered firewood, right?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Right. Someone would’ve had to put it here within the last couple hours.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Then they can’t be far off, can they?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, I reckon they’re just inside the woods somewhere. Probably just out of sight.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So what is this, then? A peace offering? A Heartbeater had to have left this, right?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, a Deadhead decided to lure us into the forest with a box of supplies,” said James sarcastically.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah yeah, alright. But why?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Maybe peace offering…Maybe trap.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You think? How would giving us supplies be a trap?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Give us a false sense of security?” James suggested. “Or maybe the box itself is rigged.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They both turned to the plastic tote, eyeing it as though it were a bomb about to blow.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That’s useful stuff in there,” Sirius finally pointed out, and after a moment, James nodded in agreement.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hold on,” he said. In a single, swift movement, he raised up his bow and sent an arrow flying directly at the box. It smacked against the plastic with a loud ‘thunk!’ and hit it with enough force to tip the tote onto its side. All of the contents inside it jostled around, and Sirius watched the trees anxiously, the noise seeming ten times louder than it should be.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Don’t think it’s rigged,” James said once the tote settled. “I say we take it back to camp and inspect it there.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sirius nodded and went to pick up the tote, while James retrieved his arrow. The tote was light—he was able to carry it under one arm with ease. The two of them hurried out of the forest. They sat by the light of the fire, the mysterious gift basket between them.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>After a silent game of “you open it,” “no, you open it,” James reached over and popped off the lid. He began removing items one by one.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>In addition to the oranges, first aid kit, juice boxes, and the umbrella, there were a couple travel sized, wind-up flashlights, a pack of gum, a roll of toilet paper, and single bottle of hand sanitizer. There appeared to be no rhyme or reason to the contents—it was as though someone collected a random assortment of materials and threw them together. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Alright, I don’t get it,” James said, looking over their newly attained loot. Sirius shook his head, just as lost. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“None of this is valuable enough to fight over,” he said. “I mean, we can definitely use it, but if someone were trying to trick us into giving our trust, or lure us into the woods, or something, this isn’t really good enough to outweigh the risk.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I agree,” said James. “To me it feels more like someone had some stuff they didn’t want, knew we were here, and thought we might want it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That means there are some other Heartbeaters out there keeping tabs on us. That doesn’t exactly fill me with confidence.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“If they didn’t want to come to us directly, I’d say they’re just as intimidated by us as we are of the idea of them,” said James logically. Sirius wasn’t so sure; something about this peculiar gift didn’t sit well with him. He reached over and snatched up the tote bag that contained all their medicines. He put the first aid kit in it, and fished out the bottle of aspirin.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Here,” he said, shaking two powdery pills into James’ palm. “Go give these to Peter—make sure he drinks enough water—and then get some rest.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What are you going to do?” James asked, eyebrow raised.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Gonna keep watch.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s my turn for the night shift,” James reminded him, but Sirius shook his head.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m not tired,” he said, his stomach churning with adrenaline at the thought of an indeterminate amount of Living watching their campground from behind the trees. At James’ skeptical look he insisted, “I’ll wake you if I need a break.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>James, though clearly unconvinced, merely shrugged. “Fine,” he said, getting to his feet, picking up a bottle of water. “But don’t wear yourself too thin. You need rest too.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Let me know if Peter gets worse,” was all Sirius said in response. James nodded, and headed to their tent, the slightest limp in his step.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>—-</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sirius had developed a newfound appreciation for what darkness meant. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>When he was seven years old, his mother came into his room one night at bedtime, and removed the nightlight plugged in beside his closet door. “You’re too old to be afraid of a silly thing like the dark,” she said to his protests. “Blacks don’t have petty fears.” And so, through a week of nearly sleepless nights, Sirius forced himself to believe that there was nothing lurking under his bed waiting to get him once the lights went out.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>But this was different. The darkness that weighed down around the campsite was suffocating. At least the seven year old in the dark bedroom had the luxury of a bedside lamp, and hallway lights filtering in from underneath the door frame. Out here, the only light he had were the stars peeking through between thin layers of clouds, and the full moon that had risen to the very top of the sky. Keeping a fire going at nighttime was unwise—an unnecessary risk to take, as the smoke and flames could easily lure Deadheads towards them. And out here, on the brink of the dense forest, Sirius could not tell himself there was no danger lurking in the shadows. Unlike the pretend monsters in his childhood bedroom, the dangers out past the treeline were painfully real. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He held a flashlight in his lap, but didn’t dare turn it on. He sat, still as a statue, listening for any movement, and tensing at every rustle of leaves in the wind.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sirius did not like being afraid. Blacks, he reminded himself as a breeze went by, did not have petty fears.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>But these fears weren’t petty.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>During the day, it was easy for him to occupy himself with tasks—to intentionally bury all the images seared into his mind that he was always trying to forget. But nighttime watches, where his only tasks were to sit and wait and listen, he couldn’t keep the thoughts at bay.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The infection started in the early hours of the morning, and at the time there was only confusion; a few scattered cases and quarantines, the news claiming it had been contained. By sunset, it had spread all across England, bleeding over into the rest of Great Britain, and there was mass panic. Before the telecommunications were cut, the final broadcast was just a message set on repeat on every television set, radio broadcast, and news website: </span>
  <em>
    <span>Save Yourself</span>
  </em>
  <span>. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He had gone back. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He’d left Grimmauld Place when he was still a teenager, taken in by the Potters, and never once thought about returning. Both Mr. and Mrs. Potter had passed about a year apart from each other, and he, James, and Peter rented a decent flat in the city, living modestly off of the Potter’s fortune, and an inheritance Sirius got from his Uncle Alphard, who pity-wrote him into his will. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They were lucky to escape the city unscathed. It was James’ forethought that saved them. “We have to get away from any crowds,” he said before anyone even knew how big it was going to become. “If just one person gets infected, it’s going to spread like wildfire.” Peter wanted to stay and hide, and Sirius still wasn’t convinced that the CDC wasn’t going to get it under control, but James was relentless. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They heard on the radio, not five hours after they drove Peter’s car as far out into the country as they could get, that the city—every corner of it—had fallen.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>That’s when Sirius made them return to Grimmauld Place. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They fought about it. The Ancient House of Black was protected with high walls, the best security systems money could buy, and guards at every entrance; if any place was going to stay protected, it was that dark, looming mansion that was terrifying enough without adding living dead into the mix. Besides, James callously pointed out, even the apocalypse wouldn’t be enough to convince Walburga Black that blood was thicker than water. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And it wasn’t that Sirius disagreed: More than likely, the horrid woman would throw her eldest son at a pack of Deadheads if it meant it would save herself. But with the Potters six feet under, the Pettigrews retired in Scotland with no way to get ahold of them, and Sirius’ inherent need to make sure his little brother was safe, the mantra, “family is family,” won out in the end. They took the backroads, and arrived mid-afternoon the next day.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Bloodbath” didn’t do the scene justice. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The best Sirius could figure, when he tried to rationalize it out later, was that the guards were met with a pack of Flesh Eaters, and in their attempt to get inside to safety, were bitten before they could relock the gates. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The lefthand side of the hallway entrance was splattered and dripping with blood, leading down to the limp body of the doorman the Blacks had employed since before Sirius was born. His body was slumped against the wall, his head slack against his shoulder, a definitive gun wound oozing from his forehead, which started near his temple, and went out through the back of his skull. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The bodies were like a candy trail, some of them people Sirius recognized— their cook, and his former tutor—and some of them strangers from the pack that overran the house. They found his father at the base of the stairs, a gunshot through the skull like the rest, and a large chunk missing from his right arm in the form of a giant bite mark, the white carpet around him saturated in brownish-red.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Armed with an umbrella from the stand by the door, a steak knife from the kitchen, and a shard of broken glass from the mirror above the fireplace, they crept up the stairs. The long corridor was deserted, the only signs of disruption coming from the framed pictures along the wall that were either crooked, or shattered on the floor, and a line of smeared blood, as though someone had been dragged across the ground. The many rooms were all shut. Sirius tried each of them, and found they were all locked. Finally, they reached the end, where Regulus’ room was located, and they found the door wide open.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Walburga Black was sprawled across the rug, her hands outstretched towards the closet door, the mahogany scratched and indented at the base. Closer examination of Mrs. Black’s fingers would find her fingernails scraped down to the quick, jagged and bloody. She was in a silk nightgown, which was torn around the midsection, where her flesh had been gnawed and ripped apart; one could fit a fist in the biggest of the holes in her abdomen. A long, splintered piece of wood, looking like it had been broken off from one of the dining room chairs, was sticking out from her right eye, driven right into her brain. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sirius couldn’t look away. Years of yelling, smacking, and just general abuse—and now here his mother lay, awash in a still and gruesome death. He felt cold; numb from the tip of his toes to the top of his head. He hardly noticed as James stepped over Mrs. Black’s corpse, raised his glass shard, and threw the closet door open. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He was jolted out of his shock when he heard the scream. His head snapped up away from his mother’s uninjured eye—open and emptily staring—and instead saw his cousin Bellatrix cowering, and arm thrown across a young boy with Sirius’ eyes. Regulus was sunk in the very corner of the closet, flushed and shaking, coated in flecks of blood Sirius doubted was his. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What are </span>
  <em>
    <span>you</span>
  </em>
  <span> doing here?” Bellatrix snapped, not moving out of her protective stance, as though Sirius’ mere presence could harm Regulus irreparably; as though there weren’t bigger dangers lurking just outside the walls of Grimmauld Place.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What happened?” Sirius croaked when he found his voice. He didn’t acknowledge Bellatrix, he was looking directly at Regulus. “How’d they get in? What happened to…?” he glanced down at the body at his feet.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What do you think happened?” Bellatrix spit, getting to her feet. Regulus didn’t move. “They got inside; infected nearly everybody. Regulus is lucky I’m an excellent shot.” She stepped out of the closet and cast a disgusted face down at Mrs. Black. “This was his handy work, however. We were out of bullets. Auntie cornered us in here; was clawing at the door like a damned wild animal. Reg open the door a smidge, and just...” Bellatrix mimed a jabbing motion. “He insisted we stay in here until we were sure there was nothing else in the house. I kept telling him that was just inviting more to come find us, but was absolutely petrified. It was too pathetic. I couldn’t get him to move.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sirius watched his brother, who refused to meet his eye. He was staring at the body of Walburga Black with the same detached numbness Sirius felt. Bellatrix continued to ramble, “I suppose that if </span>
  <em>
    <span>you</span>
  </em>
  <span> managed to get in here, that the coast is clear?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah,” James spoke up when he realized Sirius wasn’t listening. “It’ll be cramped, but there should be enough room in our car for both of you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ha!” Bellatrix exclaimed. “Yeah, because we’re putting our lives in </span>
  <em>
    <span>your</span>
  </em>
  <span> hands. We’d be better off just offing ourselves right here and now. We’ll fend for ourselves, thanks.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Suit yourself,” said James with a scowl, but Sirius muttered,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Reg?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Regulus glanced up at his brother. Already young, he seemed almost like a child with his wide, frightened eyes. “Come with us,” Sirius said.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Don’t be stupid,” Bellatrix answered for him. “He’s coming with me. Can you imagine Auntie’s reaction if I let him go off with you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I don’t think Auntie has much of an opinion on anything anymore,” Sirius said darkly, and Bellatrix smirked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Always with the smart remarks,” she said. “You never change.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Listen,” James piped up. “I’d love to stand around and have this charming family reunion, but—and I can’t believe I’m saying this—Bellatrix is right. More of those things could come find this house any time now. We’re completely unprotected, and it’s way too easy to get cornered in here. I don’t fancy getting killed here.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I quite agree,” said Bellatrix snottily. “Dying with people like…” she pointedly looked James’ dark skinned body up and down. “Well, I’m just saying, there are more dignified ways to die.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I forgot why I liked you so much,” James replied with a smile. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Can we go?” Peter asked, fidgeting with his hands. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, we can,” Sirius said. He nodded at Regulus. “Come on,” he said to him. Regulus, wide eyed and nervous, looked between Sirius and Bellatrix and back again.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Regulus, don’t you even think it,” said Bellatrix sharply. “Come now. We’ll go to Cissy’s. Remember she’s moved out with the Malfoy boy out in the countryside? It’ll be safe there.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“And if her place is overrun, too?” Sirius snapped. “Then what?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Then at least we’ll still be doing what Auntie would have wanted,” Bellatrix snapped right back.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Regulus glanced back again at the greying body of their mother. Dark patches were beginning to show up on the undersides of her arms and legs where blood was beginning to pool. Sirius watched his brother take a deep breath as he willed himself to his feet. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He said exactly two words to his brother: “I’m sorry.” He then took Bellatrix’s outstretched hand, grimacing as his foot gently scraped across their mother’s back. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>James let them wait there long enough for Bellatrix and Regulus to get far enough away that they wouldn’t run into each other, and then forced Sirius to step away from his rooted spot in his little brother’s bedroom. The peeled away from Grimmauld Place, and this time Sirius knew he was it was for good. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They hadn’t crossed paths with Regulus since then, although Sirius was </span>
  <em>
    <span>always</span>
  </em>
  <span> looking. But for all he knew, his brother was long dead—or worse, turned, wandering around with a limp, decayed body, perpetually hunting, and never resting.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sirius shivered, and it had nothing to do with the wind rustling the leaves. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>In fact, there was no wind. The air was perfectly still, and yet, he distinctly heard the sound of leaves and twigs brushing together. He snapped out of his thoughts, tensing in the shoulders, hand gripping his knife instinctively. He tilted his head toward the forest, listening. He’d learned to tell the small differences between similar sounds. He knew when something was an animal, or something worse. He heard branches snap underneath the weight of trampling feet, and he stood from his watching point. His eyes, although adjusted to the dark, still weren’t good enough to make out any shapes along the treeline. The trampling feet picked up speed, and his heartbeat followed suit, adrenaline building in his gut. He poised with his knife, and debated turning on his flashlight.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He moved away, adjacent to the tent behind him, so that if he drew anything near him, it wouldn’t run directly to where Peter and James slept. He drew in a breath, flipped on his flashlight, and shined it towards the forest.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>At first there wasn’t anything. But then, breaking through the thick of the trees, a human shape emerged. It turned towards the light, and began running towards him. Sirius stood up straighter, planting his feet shoulder width apart; his fighting stance.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It didn’t take him long to realize that whoever was running at him wasn’t a Deadhead. Its movements were too coordinated. Sirius had never seen a Deadhead run faster than a speed-walking-limp. Still, Sirius didn’t dare drop his guard. If anything, he grew only more suspicious. Why would a Heartbeater be running at him in the dead of night? He held onto his knife so tightly his knuckles ached.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>When the stranger was still several meters away, it began yelling at him. It took Sirius a minute to gather his bearings and listen. When he did, he heard, “they’re coming, they’re coming!” in a young, male voice. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The stranger grew closer, and Sirius realized it was a thin man, his face veiled, and his head covered by the hood of his jacket. He held out his hand, and it was gloved. “I’m not going to hurt you,” he said. “But you’ve got to listen to me. A whole pack of them are coming, and I know you and your friends aren’t strong enough to take them all on.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“How do you know—” Sirius started, but the stranger shook his head.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Don’t worry about that now. I’m trying to help you, let’s focus on that, and get you safe, we don’t have much time.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sirius eyed the man. He could vaguely see his face from under the veil he wore to cover it, but he could make out no features. On his back, the stranger had a machete slung across it. Sirius made a split second decision. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Okay,” he said. “How many.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“At least a dozen,” said the stranger, tugging on Sirius’ sleeve and leading him hurriedly toward the tent. “Probably more, I didn’t get a good count.” They got to the tent, and before Sirius could do anything, the stranger yanked at the zipper and yelled inside, “up! Get up! You’re about to get overrun!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sirius shined the light into the tent, where James was already awake and alert. He quickly got to his feet, but stalled when he saw the stranger. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Don’t worry about who I am,” said the stranger. “We can talk about that all you want once we get rid of the Flesh Eaters, alright?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>James, after sharing the briefest of glances with his friend, seemed to come to the same conclusion as Sirius. He nodded, and then reached down to shake Peter. Peter opened his eyes, blinking blearily, seeming dazed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wahshappenin’?” he mumbled. Beads of sweat were formed along his hairline, and his eyes kept rolling back into his head, as though he couldn’t focus. James frowned and placed a hand on Peter’s forehead. He glanced back up, looking morose. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We aren’t going to be able to move him,” James informed Sirius and the stranger. “At least not quickly enough to get away from a pack of Deadheads.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Then we’re going to have to fight them off,” said the stranger decidedly. He whipped the machete off his back expertly, and turned and headed back towards the forest. He glanced over his shoulder. “Make sure to stand behind me,” he said. “And don’t you </span>
  <em>
    <span>dare</span>
  </em>
  <span> use guns if you have them. The last thing we need is to draw more of them to us.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“This isn’t our first time, you know,” Sirius said somewhat defensively, tossing James his bow. The stranger ignored him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“They were following the route I came from,” he said instead. “You hear that?” He nodded towards the trees. Sirius listened, and heard the distinctive sound of mild moaning, and branches snapping. “They’re just ahead,” the stranger said, holding the machete out in front of him in his gloved hand. “Get ready.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sirius, taken aback by the authority the stranger seemed entitled to, had a strong, rebellious urge to storm the treeline, but James, perhaps sensing this, pointed to a place behind the stranger, and said, “you take that side, and I’ll go over here.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Relenting, Sirius took his position. He glanced up at the stranger, who wasn’t moving a muscle, staring at the forest. “Who are you?” Sirius called.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Later,” said the stranger.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Can we at least have your name?” Sirius asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The stranger said nothing for several seconds, and Sirius thought he either didn’t hear him, or was ignoring him, but then he muttered, “Remus. My name’s Remus.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m Sirius. That’s James.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The stranger—Remus—nodded. “I know,” he said, and before Sirius could ask how in Hell he knew that, he called out, “I see them, they’re breaking the treeline. Do </span>
  <em>
    <span>not</span>
  </em>
  <span> go ahead of me, and James, you stay behind Sirius. Don’t press your luck with your ankle, got it? Use your bow, stay at a distance.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“How did you—” Sirius started, while James furrowed his brow, but Remus cut them off.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Later</span>
  </em>
  <span>,” he hissed, and that was the last any of them got in before the Deadheads stumbled out from the forest. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They always looked different, the bodies in varying states of mutilation. They all shared a handful of physical features: Grey skin, for one. All the Deadheads were the color of cigarette ash, with a waxy texture to their skin. Their eyes were also similar, with a white, milky cloudiness. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>But what they looked like beyond that depended on how much damage their body had suffered at the time of infection, and how torn apart they had become since they turned. Deadheads never healed. The pack that ambled towards them was full of bodies that were missing large chunks of flesh, and had limbs hanging from their sockets. One of them was missing all the skin along the left side of its jaw, revealing rows of rotten teeth. All of them had small nicks along their exposed body parts from walking through the trees. They wore tattered clothing, which was matted in dirt and grit, and torn into rags. They limped forward, all unused muscles slack, their mouths hanging open and heads lolling at the sides.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The one at the front of the pack got close enough to Remus that he was able to take off his head with one fell swipe of his machete. Its head tumbled into the grass, still blinking and moving its jaw lazily open and shut. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Without so much of a glance, Remus slammed the blade of his machete into its skull, making the killshot into the brain.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sirius watched the rest of the pack, waiting for them to all turn onto Remus, but to his surprise, they ignored him entirely. Not a single one of the Deadheads paid Remus any mind. They walked right within bite range of him, but didn’t even look his direction. Remus, apparently not surprised by this reaction, took out as many as he could, swinging his machete in a controlled, expert way, but soon was overrun. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A herd of them clambered past him, their gazes fixed on Sirius and James.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>James shot a arrow directly into the forehead of the one closest to him, and the rest of the Deadheads turned and started towards him, their deep, growling groans growing louder. Sirius, seizing the opportunity of being off their radar, came up behind a pack of three, and stabbed each of them in quick succession in the soft spot at the back of their skulls. They fell like bricks.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Fuck!” James said suddenly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He was backing away, arrow aimed, but tripped over his own lame ankle, and toppled over, losing aim, giving the Deadhead the opportunity to get close to him. James kicked at it, but it drew closer, grabbing him from behind his knee and pulling him towards him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sirius tried to get to him, but was cut off by another Deadhead, which latched onto his him arm, and nearly took a chunk out of it, but Sirius—with heightened reflexes—jammed his knife into its temple. He tugged his knife out with a wet, slurping sound, and turned back to James, but Remus already reached him, having taken down all of the Deadheads that had been surrounding him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Remus grabbed the Deadhead around the neck, and tugged it off of James, who was flailing on the ground, trying to push himself free. The Deadhead struggled in Remus’ arms, biting at his sleeves, but Remus wasn’t bothered. His machete dropped a short ways away, Remus reached down, Deadhead still in his grasp, and picked up a large rock.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He slammed it into the side of the Deadhead’s skull, over and over, until its head was concave. He let it slump down out of his arms, and he walked up to James and held out a hand to help him up, but James did not take it. Instead, he stared up at Remus, eyes wide. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What is it?” Sirius asked, approaching them. Remus turned to look at him, and Sirius stopped in his tracks.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Remus reached up to his face, and, realizing that in the midst of his struggle with the Deadhead his veil had been pulled partially off, revealing most of his face, he froze. Quickly, he said, “it’s not what it looks like,” but Sirius had already stiffened, and raised his knife back up in fighting position.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What the fuck?” Sirius said quietly. “What the fuck are you?” In his periphery, James was scrambling to his feet, and arming his bow, aiming it right at Remus’ head.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I promise I can explain,” Remus said, reaching up and pulling off his hood and the rest of his veil.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Start talking now, dude,” James said with a terrifying edge to his voice. Sirius just stared.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<span>Remus was perfectly ordinary looking, with loose, curly hair, and a lanky, somewhat awkward disposition. He would have been utterly unremarkable, if it weren’t for the grey ash color of his skin, and the milky white irises of his eyes. </span>
