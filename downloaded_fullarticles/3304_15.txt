          <div class="userstuff"><p>Everything was different.</p>
<p>Draco had expected different. So much had changed over the summer (<em>don’t think about the trials or the funerals. Don’t think about father rotting away in Azkaban</em>). He knew it wouldn’t be easy (<em>rebuilding and recovery never is, you can put the pieces back together but the damage is done</em>), knew just <em> how much </em> of Hogwarts needed to be rebuilt after the war.</p>
<p>He’d known.</p>
<p>It was still overwhelming.</p>
<p>The differences stood out. Out of place like Potter’s hair in the morning — Potter’s hair any time of the day. Every difference felt like a shocking spell, running through him and twisting his gut.</p>
<p><em> All his fault</em>.</p>
<p>The changes were everywhere: the grounds, the castle, the staff, and the classes (<em>don’t think about why the classes are smaller — don’t think about it</em>). It all piled up until Draco was suffocating under their weight.</p>
<p>He scanned the hall, cataloguing each change, and his heart raced faster with every difference he saw.</p>
<p>His eyes caught on another pair, green behind spectacles. They pulled Draco up short, and his breath caught.</p>
<p>Harry flashed a smile.</p>
<p>Maybe different wasn’t always bad.</p></div>
