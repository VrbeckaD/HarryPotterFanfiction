    <p>Deanna realizes Beverly is happiest meddling and nurturing, and Tasha has never had that, so gets them on Betazed somehow and sets up a romantic picnic.</p><p>And they both think it's absurd and are very awkward but then they like, find an injured turtle and decide to heal it. </p><p>Beverly is all, "I'm not a vet?" But Tasha is very worried about the turtle and Beverly thinks it's super cute so she agrees to try.</p><p>But while she's figuring out what to do, the turtle gets out of the box they put it in and they don't know where it went. </p><p>And Tasha is distraught because <em>how do you lose a turtle?! They're so slow there are sayings about it! And it was injured! And now it's going to die and it's all their fault!</em></p><p>Beverly discovers Deanna packed wine and pours Tasha a glass. She calls it a prescription. </p><p>And Tasha feels very foolish to be so so upset over an animal, but Beverly understands this has little to do with the turtle. </p><p>They get pretty tipsy and unpack the rest of the picnic and have a wonderful afternoon and they swim in the waterfall and come across a whole colony of turtles and decide it's the universe telling them it's okay.</p><p>And the next day Deanna asks Beverly "how the date went?" and she's confused and then realizes <em>That was a date!</em> and immediately runs to Tasha's quarters and asks her to dinner and Tasha is even more confused but says "Yes, absolutely."</p><p>Beverly sets up a whole candlelight thing and it is Very Clearly A Date and it is still awkward at the beginning but by the end they are making out on the sofa.</p><p>And then Wesley walks in and stammers "Uh when did that happen???"</p><p>And Beverly says, "well there was this turtle," and they both start laughing and Wesley turns pale and runs away and demands his own quarters the next morning. </p>
