    <p>A/N: Disclaimer: I don't own ANY of the characters, all of them belong to J.K. Rowling and Uncle Rick. All I own is the plot. There will also be some cussing, because what teenagers don't cuss? This chapter has been revised and I hope you enjoy. </p><p>Harry</p><p>"Harry!" Ron yelled at me, "I made all the way to the other side of the room... Without getting splinched!.... and I think I'm gonna throw up..." he muttered the last part while clutching his stomach.</p><p>Ministry officials came to Hogwarts and were holding an apparation class for the 6th years who want to get a head start before we turn seventeen and have to take the real test. They took down the shield preventing apparation from happening in and out of Hogwarts. Hermione, Ron and I figured that it would be fun, and decided to try it out. I got really good at it (not to brag) and was 'bouncing' around the room, scaring the shit out of Ron and Hermione. Ron was doing okay, and was making process, but Hermione wasn't getting anywhere.</p><p>I apparated behind him and and clapped him on the back making him jump, "Good job Ron!" I decided to try something and grab his arm. With a twist and pop we were next to Hermione.</p><p>Hermione flinched and turned to glare at me. "Harry! You don't even have a permit yet! You can not apparate someone else with you! Do you understand how dangerous that is?!" Hermione yelled at me incredulously. "Honestly Harry, you are being so reckless!" Well duh. I was sorted into Gryffindor for a reason. Shit. Don't let Malloy know I 'said' that. He would never let me live it down if he knew that I admitted that Gryffindors were reckless.</p><p>"Aw 'Mione, what's the worst that could happen? He is clearly a natural at this, just like he was at flying! He isn't going to hurt anyone."</p><p>Hermione gave one final glare to me and Ron and sighs, going back to trying to apparate. I decided to be a bloody prat, and I wanted to prove a point, so I grabbed her and Ron's arms and with a loud crack, apparated is out of there.</p><p>I only meant to bring us to the dungeons, but the next thing I know we're by a rock in the middle of some forest, while a bunch of people are fighting around us with... swords and bows?!</p><p> I heard a blood curdling scream from next to me and looked over to see Hermione, missing a piece of her forearm.</p><p>Percy </p><p>It was a couple months after the Giant war, and Annabeth and I decided to wait on Senior Year in high school, and stay at Camp Half Blood for some time. It was mid November, yet camp was warm and sunny thanks to the Golden Fleece. So far nothing major has happened since the war, other than lots of new demigods and a few monsters here and there. Dionysius came back to camp and I don't know how to feel about that. On one hand it means the Gods are actually doing things, but on the other... it's Mr. D. Jason has been going between the two camps a lot and has been bringing Piper with him. They're currently with us. Hazel and Frank are spending time in New Rome, getting away from the chaos that is me, Percy Jackson. The Hunters arrived last night, looking for more recruits after they lost so many in the Giant War.</p><p>As tradition we were playing a game of capture the flag, Hunters vs Campers. The Athena and Ares Cabins talked strategy with the rest of us, I was gonna be positioned by the creek (naturally,) Hermes, Ares, Athena, Zeus (Jupiter,) and some of the other cabins would be offense, the rest of us were on defense. You may think it's unfair because there are way more Campers than there are Hunters, but you never want to underestimate the Hunters, even without Artemis with them. </p><p>This was gonna be fun.</p><p>I stood by the creek with Riptide in hand, waiting for someone to the the glow of my sword. I was started to think that they were avoiding this section of the forest when and arrow whizzes by my ear, missing my head by less than a centimeter. Each Hunter has amazing accuracy, and none of them would've missed that shot, most of them wouldn't hesitate to impale my skull, which meant this was someone I knew.</p><p>"How you doing Thals?" I yell towards the area the arrow came from. Another arrow. With one goes directly between my legs. "Aw, c'mon! Don't be like that! Show yourself Thals!"</p><p>Just then I heard a rustling to my right. Thalia was just a distraction. I ran towards the sound to find a Huntress I don't know, probably a new recruit, running towards our flag. I jumped on her and she pulls out her hunting knife. We start battling when I noticed Thalia going around us. I summon water from the creek and douse the girl I was fighting, throwing her off guard before slamming the flat of Riptide against her head, knocking her unconscious.</p><p>I look back and run at Thalia, I will water from the creek to push me towards her.Â  I land next to her and start a fight, me and Riptide against her, her hunting knife and Aegis. An even match between the two of us, lots of lightning and water.</p><p>While the fight was just getting good there was an ear piercing scream coming from near Zeus' Fist. I looked up to see three kids, about a year or two younger than me, on the ground by the rock. Two boys, one of which looks a lot like me, just scrawnier. He has raven hair, instead of sea green eyes had emerald green, and large circular glasses. The other boy had bright orange hair, lots of freckles and light blue eyes. The third kid was a girl (Hermione, you're a girl -Ronald Weasley) with lots of frizzy brown hair to rival Hazel's, and brown eyes. Another scream comes from her, and I saw what she was screaming about, her arm was missing a chunk from it.</p><p>Everyone in the area stops fighting and looks over at them. I capped Riptide and ran over to them. I pick up the girl and yell behind me as I run towards the Big House, "Someone get Will!" And start running faster, the two boys who were with her running behind me. (A little bit away though, they were kinda slow compared to me.)</p><p>I ran into the Big House and lay the girl down on the couch. "Who are you two?" I asked them while running around, trying to find a first aid kit.</p><p>"I'm Harry Potter," the boy with raven hair says, he takes a pause and looks as though he expected a reaction from me. I just nod my head, telling him to continue and he looks bewildered, but happy. "And this is Ron</p><p>"And her?" I ask, looking towards the girl, who seems to be missing a piece of her arm. She has tears in her eyes and lets out the occasional scream. What happened to her?</p><p>"This is Hermione Granger, will you please help her? I didn't mean for this to happen... I was just getting cocky..." he muttered the last part under his breath.</p><p>I was just about to ask what monster got to them when Will came running in with his medic bag. He runs over next to the couch and gets starts cleaning her wound. He's about to pour nectar on her injury before hesitating, "is she a half-blood?" Will asks the two boys, who were watching what was happening with a surprised look on their faces.</p><p>The red head... Ron I think his name is, just seemed to register what he said. He gets an insulated look on his face before glaring at Will, "No she isn't, she's only a Muggleborn. Have you got a problem with that?" He asks him defensively. The more they talk I realize that they have British accents.</p><p>"Muggleborn? What does that mean? Can she have Nectar or not?!" Will asked them impatiently.</p><p>"What the bloody hell is nectar?!" I flinch at his choice of words, "and do you not know what a Muggleborn is? You know, a wizard born to a non-magical person, or a muggle." </p><p>What does he mean? A wizard? Will just sighs and starts putting some mortal medicine on her wounds to be safe. Before I can ask any questions though, Chiron, Annabeth, Nico, Thalia, Jason, Piper, Calypso and Leo all came rushing into the Big House.</p><p>"McShizzle is here to help! Will, will fire help you in any way, shape or form?" Leo asks while Nico goes to sit by Will, (causing an awe or two to come from Piper and Jason.)</p><p>Chiron, in wheelchair form, starts rolling over towards the two boys. "What happened to her?" He asks them, looking concerned.</p><p>"Who the bloody hell are you people?!" Ron yells at us, again, I flinch, along with Annabeth and Nico.</p><p>Chiron looked startled but quickly regained his composure. In a strong voice he responded to him. "I am the activities director at this camp, my name is Chiron. I ask you again, what happened to her?" </p><p>Harry had a guilty look on his face, and looks as though he is about to have a mental breakdown. "I-I was apparating us. I only wanted to go to the other room! But then we ended up here... and Hermione got splinched. If only it was me or Ron that got hurt! She would know what to do!" He replied.</p><p>Me and the other demigods exchange a look, what the heck is apparating? We look to Annabeth, expecting her to understand what is going on. She just shrugs at us. Me and Leo exchanged a wide eyed look. Wise girl doesn't know what is going on!</p><p>Hermione catches her breath before yelling at Harry and Ron, "Guys! In my bag!" She gets out before screaming from pain again.</p><p>Harry grabbed her bag and started rummaging through it. He pulls out some odd things that defiantly shouldn't have fit into the small bag, but I've learned better than to question things. He pulled out a small vile and is about to put some of the liquid on her arm when Will speaks, "May I put it on her arm? I'm one of the medics here, if you don't mind..." Harry and Ron look at each other before shrugging and handing him the vile</p><p>"Just don't hurt her." Ron said with some malice to his voice.</p><p>Will carefully moved Hermione's arm so that the wound is facing out and puts some drops on her arm. Hermione screams louder than she has before. Tears are now streaming down her face, but her flesh is growing back.</p><p>She screams for what felt like hours, but is in reality only a minute, before her arm is almost completely healed, except for a raw skin where the wound was. She wiped her eyes and Ron gives her a big hug. She looks startled but returns the affection before Ron backs up, bright red and coughing slightly. Harry just smirked at them.</p><p>Harry also gives her a hug. The three of them then start looking around the room. Taking in everything. Ron and Harry are mainly looking at the room itself, but Hermione is looking at me and the other half-bloods.</p><p>Harry's eyes landed on Seymour eating a sausage, his eyes grew nearly as large as his glasses. Ron spotted him too. While they were looking there, Hermione was staring at the weapons strapped to our waists. "Where the bloody hell are we?" </p><p>Will they please stop with that choice of wording?!</p><p>Hey guys! So first chapter edited! I hope you enjoy it more than you did before. Going back and making revisions made me realize how bad this was. I didn't change that much, but next chapter will have lots of revisions. Please give me some feedback!</p><p>-Bealzebub</p><p>Word Count: 2,045</p>
