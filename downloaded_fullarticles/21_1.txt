    <p><em>“SECTUMSEMPRA!” </em>Harry bellowed, an intense hatred mixed with a shameful bit of fear thrumming through his veins. His eyes were locked on Malfoy, the pathetic, bareboned creature who stood before him as the curse crackled through the air, striking Malfoy dead on in the chest. Adrenaline still pounding through Harry, he felt a breath of relief start as Malfoy flew back, the start of the Cruciatus curse still ringing in his ears as he watches Malfoy fall.</p><p>            Blood. There’s blood <em>everywhere</em>. ‘No, oh no oh nonononono’ Harry panics internally, watching pools of crimson blood well up out of Malfoy’s stark white shirt that covers his twitching body.</p><p>            <em>This is it. </em>Draco thinks distantly, his entire body feeling like it’s being sucked dry by a thousand paper cuts. <em>You deserve it too. Worthless shit</em>. Suddenly there are hands on him, wet, blood soaked hands desperately trying to cover the cuts as though it would make him bleed less. <em>Harry’s hands</em>. <em>Must be. The only time you’ll ever touch me is to kill me. Figures</em>.</p><p>            Harry kneed over Malfoy, forgetting magic for the moment, just focused on the need to stop, stop this all from happening. “I’m- I’m so sorry Draco I didn’t know what it did- I didn’t-“ he stuttered, watching the man who had fascinated him, taken over his life bleed away under him.</p><p>            “MOVE.” The harsh, deep command came from the doorway, as Snape rushed in. <em>It’s strange to see him so uncomposed</em> Harry thought, before being flung to the side by the professor, before quickly murmuring some healing spells Harry definitely should have thought of over Draco’s paling body.</p><p>            Harry just stood there, watching Malfoy fight for his life, cut to pieces, shaking with rage and guilt and grief. Why grief?</p><p>            “<em>Out</em> Potter” snapped Snape, not looking up from his work. Almost on autopilot, Harry obliged, trudging through the water that was starting to mix with blood through the door.</p><p> </p><p>Blood.</p><p>Blood.</p><p>So much blood.</p><p>Malfoy’s pale, helpless figure soaked in his own blood, not washing away in the water but turning it red too.</p><p> </p><p>These images swirled in Harry’s mind over and over as he stood in wait outside the bathroom, having quickly retrieved his invisibility cloak. It had been over an hour, though it felt like five years, when he finally heard footsteps.</p><p>            Harry stayed very still, hidden under the cloak, as the footsteps approached the door.</p><p>            “-what I can from Madam Pomphrey. Expect an owl. Try not to pass out on your way to the dormitory.” Snape’s voice came, along with the man himself as the door opened. Snape looked around a few times before hurrying off. Harry held his breath, waiting for....</p><p>            It took Malfoy another three minutes, Harry should know, he counted, to appear. His clothes had been dried, blood disappeared except for a faint rosy stain, though Harry could have just been imagining it. He let out a breath he didn’t know he was holding. <em>Malfoy’s alive. </em></p><p><em>            </em>Alive, but only just so. Even for Malfoy, he looked sickly pale. His white skin contrasted harshly with the dark circles, highlighting the hollow look in his eyes. Harry watched as Malfoy fiddled with the ring he knew Malfoy always wore harshly, not quite worked up the courage to step out fully. Not for the first time, Harry considered the privilege, for he could think of no other word for it, to watch the great Draco Malfoy, pride of Slytherin and man of ice, when he thought he was alone. It hadn’t been intentional, but after all this time, the moments Harry could see the vulnerability that was shocking to Harry in the beginning, Harry had begun, against his will, to reconsider his idea of Malfoy. Yes, he was undoubtably up to something, but the man didn’t exactly seem...happy about it. If anything, the more the year progressed, Malfoy seemed more and more like a skeleton walking.</p><p>            The said skeleton finally stepped out of the archway, and turned to the right, where the Slytherin common room was. Only, mid turn he changed his mind, pivoting left so quickly Harry didn’t have the chance to move, and crashed into Harry, sending both tumbling back, the invisibility cloak sliding off.</p><p>            The two stood and faced each other, Harry’s hand twitching for his wand but stopped when he saw Malfoy just standing there, just smiling sadly, one corner of his mouth hitched up almost painfully. The silence seemed to last years, each taking the other in before Malfoy finally spoke.</p><p>            “Waiting to finish the job?” Malfoy’s soft voice, empty of malice, finally spoke.</p><p>            Harry shook his head, unsure of what he could say because he really didn’t know <em>why</em> he was still there.</p><p>            “Out of my way then” Malfoy commanded, though it seemed more out of habit than malice.</p><p>            “Why didn’t you draw your wand?” Harry called after him eventually. Malfoy stopped, halfway down the corridor.</p><p>            “Because I don’t care” Malfoy whispered, the repeated louder. “Because I do not care, Potter.” And with that, he turned the corner, leaving Harry staring after him.</p>
