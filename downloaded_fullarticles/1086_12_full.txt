    <blockquote class="userstuff">
      <p>Hi, Thank you so much for reading my adventure. Obviously all the normal things like none of the characters or world is mine they all belong to the mother of HP. This is in essence a Harry, Draco love story because I'm trash, but It's going to be really long winded guys so bear with me and I promise we will arrive at the juicy bits eventually. My main reason for writing this though is because I've always had a vision in my head about how the Wizarding World recovers after the war and how our friends move on... I want to shear it with you all. This is going to be very plot led but our characters are mostly teens and so we will not be shying from the "horizontal fandango" in any way when the time for that comes (IT"S A LONG WAY OFF). Nor am I going to shy away from the fact that our characters are going to be seriously scarred so be warned. </p><p>Lastly I need to mention that I am writing this for fun but also as a coping mechanism as I suffer from ill health. This means that sometimes I will write a lot and sometimes you may think I've given up. I HAVE NOT, I am just attempting to get as much doing in when I'm not chained to my bed. </p><p>Please talk to me and be nice... Lots of love and joy to you P&amp;U x</p><p>Enjoy.</p>

    <p>
  <em>Harry Potter smiles at the table, Mrs Weasley has made a veritable feast for the celebration and he can’t wait to tuck in. All his favourites are there; roast lamb, golden and steaming, mountains of peas, and a whole dish piled high with corn on the cob dripping in melted butter. He can even smell the syrupy sweetness of a freshly made treacle tart in the oven. His mouth waters in anticipation.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Tuck in Harry” Mr Weasley says, beaming at him. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>He puts everything he can on his plate; piling it so high the peas roll down the sides and almost onto the tablecloth. He picks up his knife and fork, is just about to take a bite when a hand stops him. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Wait its all dry, you need some source, here” Fred hands him a jug. Harry takes it smiling his thanks. Turning back to his meal Harry pours the contents onto his meal. A thick, steaming, red liquid washes over his plate, its sweet metallic scent wafting up to him. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“What the!” Harry jumps back, glaring at Fred in outrage. But Fred just smiles back at him.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"</em>
  <em>Go on, eat up” Fred says.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“I cant” he replies, “You’ve ruined it!! What is this anyway?”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Fred’s face sobers, “it’s blood Harry,” he says, “its my blood”.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“WHAT?” Harry asks, nonplussed.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“It’s my blood, I’m dead. You killed me remember? You killed us all”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Harry recoils in horror, he looks around the room. He sees Remus and Tonks staring longingly at a bundle of cloths in Andromeda’s hands. “I’ll never get to hold him now Harry” Remus says to him, “I’ll never get to watch my own son grow up, because I followed you into that Castel. I thought you knew what you were doing. I thought you’d save us.” </em>
</p><p>
  <em>He stumbles away from the accusing eyes.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>He’s running now, running through a dark wood. Branches catch at his hair and face. He’s being chased, footfall muffled on leafy soil, rapidly gaining on him.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>He trips and falls to the ground. Figures surround him; pale clammy hands reach out of the dark to pull at his clothes. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“My brother is all alone because of you” Colin Creevy shouts at him, looking much younger than he had been when he actually died “I practically worshiped you, and look where it got me”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“I’d still be alive if you hadn’t been so stupid” Sirius’ haggard face spits out only inches from his own. More voices now, more hands reaching out to him, pulling at him, blaming him for their deaths. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>And then Dumbledore is there, his blue gaze full of remorse, “If only you’d died sooner Harry. Then you could of saved us all. Oh Harry, Harry, Harry…”</em>
</p><p>“Harry… HARRY!!!”</p><p>Harry was being shaken roughly, two hands clamped firmly around his shoulders and a warm ruddy face looking down at him full of concern.</p><p>He was in Ron’s bedroom at the Burrow. The first rays of dawn’s light just starting to shine through the curtains setting the whole room ablaze, the weak light being transformed by the eye watering orange wallpaper.</p><p>“Harry mate! Wake up, your having another nightmare” Ron said with a worried expression as he looked down his long nose at Harry, his hands still holding Harry down.</p><p>“I’m up, sorry if I woke you” Harry said pushing himself up in the cot he’d been using, squeezed into the tiny floor space in Ron’s room.</p><p>“You didn’t, its ok” Ron replied stretching; his bright red hair clashing so violently with the walls of his room that it was almost hard to look at. “I’m gonna go for a shower. Meet you downstairs before we head off?” he asked. Harry nodded, rubbing sleep from his eyes as Ron climbed over him to get out the door, heading for the bathroom.</p><p>It had been nearly two months since the battle, two months since the war had ended and Harry had defeated Voldemort. There had been funerals, so many funerals and Harry had gone to them all. He had spoken at many, asked by family members who thought he would know what to say. People always came up and thanked him for coming, thanked him for everything he’d done. Harry knew they meant well but he couldn’t shake the feeling that he could of done more, if only he’d been a little stronger, a little faster, if he’d just put all the pieces together just a little quicker he could of stopped them from suffering at all.</p><p>There had been so many funerals but some stood out more than others in Harry’s mind. Colin Creevy’s funeral; Dennis Creevy standing at the front of the congregation holding his mothers hand, his head held high as her body shook, racked with harsh, dry sobs. Remus and Tonks being buried under a willow tree on the brightest, warmest day of the year, birds singing in the trees and a gentle breeze carrying the scent of early summer flowers. Harry had nearly fallen apart when Teddy started laughing at a butterfly that landed on Andromeda’s shoulder. A sound so sweet and full of joy, the knowledge that the boy who made it would never know his own Mother. Would grow up with the emptiness of a loss he couldn’t even remember happening. Then there had been Fred’s, just remembering it seemed to suck the life right out of Harry’s chest, there had been no grief on that day, no tears or wishful memories. It had just been numb, a cold, empty, broken day. Filled with a nothingness so pervasive it was a thing all of its own.</p><p>The funerals were over now, there were no more memories to be sheared, no more stories to be told only corpses rotting in the dirt and grief stricken families left to carry on the lives that could have been filled with so many others.</p><p>Harry rolled over and got up; reaching to the top of the cupboard where he had left his jeans and rummaged through the open duffel bag he was keeping the rest of his clothes in to find a T-shirt. Pulling on an old, very faded red Quidditch jersey Harry headed down stairs.</p><p>As Harry made his way down the rickety flight of stairs that made up the backbone of the Burrow, Harry could hear the soft breathing of many people. In truth Harry had never seen the Burrow so full. Not only were all the Weasleys back under its winding rafters, but so too were many other people from the war. Most were other members from Harry’s own School year. Old members of Dumbledore’s Army, Child veterans of a war they had never wished to fight, a macabre inheritance none of them had been prepared to receive.</p><p>It had started with just a few, Dean and Seamus coming over for dinner a few days after the battle and falling asleep on the sofa, Seamus not able to stand going back to a home that had been too separate from the war to really understand the terrors he’d gone through and Dean not having anywhere to go at all. Later Neville and Luna had started staying, taking comfort in the presence of others, not feeling safe without large numbers of people around after their experiences over those dark months. Soon more and more people had come trickling in.</p><p>The Burrow had become a safe haven for many survivors of the war, a place where they could support each other when it all got too much. Every room in the house now had at least three extra cots in it. It was never the same people for more than a couple of days, a constantly rotating assortment of faces. People would go see their families, try to spend a few nights with them, acting like they weren’t broken or trying to help heal the wounds that had appeared in their own homes. But it was never very long before they appeared back at the Burrow’s dinner table, needing the presence of people who knew what it felt like to have been in a war before you had even finished school.</p><p>The only room that remained off limits by unspoken consent was that of Fred and George. Even now, George rarely made his way out of his room. Mrs Weasley had finally forced him out two weeks ago, insisting that he eat with everyone else “It’s not healthy for him to be stuck in that room all day, he needs more than old photographs for company” she had said. So now he ate dinner with them, it hadn’t helped much though; he was still unnaturally quiet, and his eyes were little more than sunken holes in his face. The only people to ever venture into his room were, Angelina Johnson, Lee Jordan and Charlie, who had decided not to go back to Romania just yet.</p><p>Harry’s days were long and hard. He spent most of them helping Mrs Weasley around the house, cleaning and gardening, at this point the garden had been de-gnomed so many times that the gnomes were starting to only come out at night. This had lead to several midnight de-gnoming sessions that had only been put to a stop when a miss thrown gnome had flown straight through Mr and Mrs Weasleys open bedroom window. The senior Weasleys had been woken up rather abruptly when said gnome had landed firmly on their bed and preceded to cause havoc and quite a lot of damage. It had taken nearly two hours to get the gnome back outside and had caused Mrs Weasley to ban all outdoor activities after the sun had gone down.</p><p>When he wasn’t doing housework however Harry spent his days at the ministry. He mostly helped by meeting with grieving families, consoling them. Or else he was trying to sort through the mess that had been the blood-purity trials, releasing those unjustly sentenced to Azkaban, finding those who were still in hiding to tell them the danger had passed, or trying to make emends to the families of those who had not been lucky enough to survive the atrocities of Voldemort’s puppet government.</p><p>Harry was by far not the only volunteer helping to straighten out the mistakes of that sadistic regime, but he was attempting to use the sway he had gained in the wizarding world to make sure the corruption that had wormed into the ministry in the years before the war was ripped out and wouldn’t find a foot hold again. He’d had several long discussions with Kingsley, who had just been named the official Minister for Magic, about how the Ministry’s downfall had only hastened and enhanced the suffering that had occurred. How more measures should be put into place to stop those in power abusing their influence for their own gain rather than the gain of the government and the country.</p><p>Hermione had been a huge help with that, writing many letters to the Minister outlining the floors in the system and giving solutions based on logic and often examples of muggle governmental procedures that would put more checks and counter points into the ministry. In reality it was Hermione’s project, Harry was just using the influence he had to help her make the changes.</p><p>He still didn’t like the fact he had so much political power, it felt wrong to him that he could make a casual comment to someone in an office and it could affect the very way laws were carried out or how people’s lives were lived. If he was honest it sacred him and he didn’t want it, but if he could use it to stop people like Umbridge or Fudge from hurting people or to prevent miscarriages of justice like had happened to Sirius from happening again, then he could swallow his discomfort for a while.</p><p>The only real peace Harry got was in the brief frenzied games of Quidditch that happened most nights in the Burrows garden just before the sun went down. The games were never particularly well structured as they rarely had enough people to have a full fourteen-person game. Mostly they were merely chasers games of four on four at the most, or else just a mêlée, every person for themselves. The games had started as a distraction from the pressing silence that often arose in the later hours of the day when the housework was finished and peoples minds started to wonder down dark paths. Flying gave everyone a chance to put their feelings aside for a while, caught up in the adrenalin high of the wind in their hair and the turn of their stomachs as the ground dropped away. The games would often start around five-thirty and would continue until Mrs Weasley and whoever was helping her had finished cooking and dinner would start.</p><p>Dinner at the post-war Burrow was just as large and chaotic as it always had been, though now many of the meals had a quieter retrospective edge. As the Burrow had filled with more and more mouths to feed it had become increasingly clear that however much Mr and Mrs Weasley enjoyed having the company they were not able to afford to regularly feed up to twenty or more people. It had become a bit of a bone of contention to begin with, as none of the Weasleys would accept any money towards the food; this was until Luna arrived one day with two whole salmon and a large cake she had made. Mrs Weasley had been too polite to refuse the gifts and had cooked the fish up into one of the largest stargazy pies Harry had ever seen. Ever since that day when people came over they regularly bought an offering of food to add to the veritable feasts Mrs Weasley would prepare. The offerings were never expected but they were also never refused and Harry had often seen Mr Weasley’s thankful gaze fall on anyone who offered something towards the nights meal.</p><p>When Harry got down stairs the first thing he saw was Seamus and Dean curled up on the sofa fast asleep, a game of chess lay abandoned on the mosaic topped coffee table before them. Blacks were winning, which probably meant they were Seamus’, he was the only person who would still play Ron even if he never did actually win. They were slumped over each other, Seamus’ head resting comfortably on his best friends shoulder. The pair had become entirely inseparable since the end of the war, Seamus had confessed to Harry one rather drunken night a few weeks ago that the time Dean had spent on the run had been some of the Irishman’s most terrifying months. “I didn’t even know where he was yeh know? If he was even alive, I had no way to help him. We kept hearing about the people they found, what the snatchers would do to them and all I could think was, is Dean one of them?” he had slurred to Harry in an intoxicated whisper. It was Seamus who had gone with Dean to see his family straight after the battle only to find a burnt out shell, his entire family still inside. Dean’s eyes often became vacant as he got lost in his own grief and Seamus was often seen talking to him quietly in a corner or else taking him away for long walks in the Devonshire countryside.</p><p>Harry tiptoed past them and into the Kitchen to find Mr Weasley and Percy already at the table, two steaming mugs of tea in front of them.</p><p>“Good morning Harry, did you sleep well?” Mr Weasley asked looking up from a pile of paper work with a tired smile. Mr Weasley had been given quite a serious promotion after the war; he was now head of the Muggle Liaison Office and was responsible for repairing all the damage the Muggle community had un-knowingly suffered at the hands of Voldemort and the Death Eaters.</p><p>“Yes thank you Mr Weasley” Harry lied “did you?”</p><p>“Oh I’m afraid I spent most of the night going over this report, it’s a real mess you know. Over half the significant Muggle buildings in the London area alone have had some hex or curse placed on them. Most of them are quite minor, like making all the trains in and out of London run exactly twenty-three minutes late, But you never know when your going to run into something really dangerous. I almost lost two men yesterday when an <em>epilator</em>tried to drop them twelve stories in a banking tower on Wolf Street”.</p><p>“I think you mean <em>elevator</em>Mr Weasley”. Harry replied attempting to get the image of two wizards holding desperately onto an epilator as it attempted to violently throw them off, their robes flapping around them as the machine flailed madly.</p><p>“No Harry, I’m almost certain it’s an <em>epilator</em>, aren’t <em>elevators</em>those terrifying metal contraptions Muggle women use to remove unwanted hair? The things Muggles come up with! Why on earth anyone would want to walk around bald all day just for fashion I will never know. And we’ve told you before Harry, please call us Molly and Arthur, all this Mr and Mrs business really does seem far too formal after all” he said all this with a firm smile that made Harry feel both incredibly awkward and rather pleased. Even after so long he still found it hard to believe that the Weasley’s really did think of him as family and wanted him around.</p><p>“I’m sorry, I keep forgetting… Arthur” he said with a smile, opting not to tell him he’d gotten the two very different Muggle devices mixed up.</p><p>Mr Weasley… Arthur, Harry corrected himself, beamed at him across the table before looking back down at his pile of papers a frown instantly crossing his face as he started reading again.</p><p>Harry went over to the large kettle that sat on the arger and started making himself a cup of very strong, very sweet tea. Even after six years of knowing him Mrs Weasley still tutted quietly under her breath every time she watched him heap the five, mounded teaspoons of sugar into his cup. He couldn’t help it he just loved the way that no matter how much stirring you did you were still left with a deliciously syrupy sweet liquid at the bottom of the mug that you almost had to spoon out. Harry was beginning to think he was drinking almost as much tea these days as he was alcohol and since the war that was quite frankly impressive.</p><p>“Good morning Harry” Percy said rather pompously as he finally looked up from the paper he was reading, just as Harry started spooning in the first of his many sugars. Percy Weasley was still incredibly pompous and entirely as full of himself as he had always been, but since the final battle there had been a marked difference in him as he attempted to repair the relationship with his family that had broken down in the years running up to the war. He was quicker to make a joke and seemed less likely to judge things as he had when he was younger.</p><p>As if to demonstrate this exact point Percy smirked, humour lighting up behind his eyes “Your in the news again this morning, its quite heroic” he said as he raised an eyebrow at Harry.</p><p>“Great Merlin, what are they saying now?” Harry asked hopelessly. Ever since the Battle Harry’s fame had only increased, it didn’t seem like a day went by that there wasn’t some mortifying story about Harry splashed across every paper’s front page. The stories ranged from deeply embarrassing speculations as to his relationships with his friends to incredibly invasive biographies of his early life. The most ridiculous so far had been an article that had suggested that Harry and Ron were secretly dating and Ginny and Hermione were merely helping to hide it from the rest of the world.</p><p>“Oh its all about how you are single handedly paying for the remembrance statue at Hogwarts, what a great and noble deed it is, the amount of money your putting into the restorations and how Hogwarts would never open again if it wasn’t for your direct influence, its all rather splendid. Although I personally preferred the one with the photo of you and Ron looking at condemns in that Muggle shop, I’ve never seen Mum’s face go quite that shade of beetroot before”.</p><p>Harry groaned and closed his eyes as he remembered the embarrassment of that article, Molly hadn’t looked him in the eye for a week and it had been almost impossible to get even within ten feet of Ginny without her mother appearing unexpectedly with some errand or other.</p><p>“That’s ridiculous, yes I gave some money to Hogwarts for the repairs, but I’m not the only one who has and I didn’t even give them that much!” it was true Harry had given some money to Hogwarts but it was all old Black money and he thought he might as well use it for some good.</p><p>Harry was still getting used to having so much money, whilst he had always known he had a lot more than the Weasleys, a thought that had always left him a little uncomfortable, he had never really comprehended quite how large the sum of money he had really was. Shortly after the Battle, Harry had gone with Hermione to Gringotts to work out what his finances were like. He had been astonished to discover that his parents account alone contained nearly Eighty-thousand Galleons. This on top of several other smaller Potter vaults he’d had no idea he’d inherited from distant relatives and the gigantic sum that was the Black family fortune that Sirius had left him meant that Harry had well over five-million Galleons to his name. What had come as a real shock however was when Hermione had turned to Harry as they were leaving Gringotts to say with a rather meek expression on her face, “Of course Harry one Galleon is worth roughly eighteen pounds. That means you have the equivalent of around ninety-million pounds, can you imagine what you could do with that”. The truth had been that Harry really couldn’t. He had completely panicked when he got back to the Burrow and hadn’t calmed down until Hermione had suggested he donate anonymously to the repair efforts. So he had given large amounts to Hogwarts and the ministry for the repairs.</p><p>“You might see it that way Harry, but many people will think it’s an incredibly generous thing to have done.” Percy went on “We’ve not had many truly good people in the public eye for a long time and seeing you being the <em>good willed savior</em>is quite frankly a breath of fresh air for most people.” he looked rather serious all of a sudden. “Now I’m off to work, I have a few things I need to get done before the Minister arrives. Coming Dad?” Percy got up and started hunting for his cloak whilst Mr Weasley filed his papers into a rather battered brown leather briefcase.</p><p>At that moment Ron came in through the living room door, maroon Weasley jumper clashing spectacularly with his red hair, which was dripping slightly from the shower.</p><p>“Mornin’ Dad, Perc, have a good day at work” he called to them as they made their way out the door and past the wards before apparateing away. “So… you ready Harry?” Ron asked looking over at him with an excited gleam in his eyes.</p><p>“Yeah, one sec” Harry said downing the rest of his tea, and immediately regretting it as he scolded the roof of his mouth.</p><p>Harry sheared Ron’s excitement for the morning’s activity, although he imagined for slightly different reasons. Hermione was finally returning home from Australia with her parents this morning. She had left for the far side of the world two weeks after the final battle to find them, and hopefully restore their memories. Harry and Ron had wanted to go with her, but she had insisted they stay with the Weasleys, reasoning that the family needed their support more than she did then.</p><p>It had been a tense time for Hermione as it had taken several weeks to locate her parents, even with the help of the Australian Bureau of Magical Policies. Not only that but extended memory charms were considered highly dangerous as they could become difficult to reverse, especially if the person whose memory had been altered was reticent to regain the knowledge that had been taken. After weeks of hunting and almost a month of work carefully restoring the Grangers memories, they had finally closed their small sweet shop in Sydney and were ready to move back to the UK and resume their old lives. Hermione had written to Harry and Ron a few days ago asking if they could meet her and her parents at the airport. Mr and Mrs Granger had apparently not been thrilled that their daughter had written herself out of their lives without their consent and there had been a strain in the family’s relationship because of it. Hermione wanted Ron and Harry to be there to help her explain to her parents exactly why she had felt she had to do it; she thought they might be able to hear it better if it came from someone other than herself.</p><p>“Ok” Harry said, putting the cup in the sink to be washed up. “Lets go”.</p><p>The two friends made their way out of the front door and down the crooked garden path made of large, knobbly stone slabs with grass and dandelions poking out between them. Through the wooden gate with it’s peeling pale blue paint, until they were standing just outside the Weasley homes wards. They took one look at each other before turning sharply on the spot, disapparating.</p>
