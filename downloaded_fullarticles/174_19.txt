    <p>((A//N) This is a hint to the end of the story so if you don’t want to find out some hints to the end of the story then you can skip)</p><p> </p><p>The sun is slowly setting over the horizon as I sit there alone with no one else around. I feel the soft breeze rushing around my body as the black lake slowly rattles back and forth in a calming way. My fingers play with the dead grass like i’m bored but i’m more hurt than ever.<br/>
“(Y/N)”<br/>
I don’t look at him. He’s just a careless boy who want sympathy. Why should I care how he feels if he didn’t care about my feelings in the first place?<br/>
He still stands around awkwardly. I can feel his grey eyes on me, watching every slight movement.<br/>
Finally he sits next to me.<br/>
“I never meant for it to happen that way...you know...what happened 2 weeks ago.”<br/>
I’m silent but in my brain I want to scream out to the world so that everybody can hear my loud voice and in how much pain I’m in. That’s what happened last time at least. I need to be more calm this time.<br/>
“What she did to me Draco, it is your fault and you know it,” I say, “you know she made me scream for mercy as she cut into my arm right?” I finally look at him but as our eyes meet he looks away as though scared of my eyes.<br/>
“Yes i know what she did but I never asked her to do it,” he denies.<br/>
“But you told her what we did, when I told you that it would ruin my life if you did,” I say.<br/>
“I thought that I could trust her...” his voice trails away.<br/>
We sit there for a minute staring at the sun. The Giant Squid comes up with his thrashing tentacles during that silence, making me nostalgic from all the times him and I sat here and watched the creatures behavior.<br/>
“You know, I’m glad that you decided to trust her. I’m glad that I’m gonna leave this place soon because of you and every person that decided to do this to me. Because this place will now be the past to my life and not the beginning,” i say standing up beside him and looking at him.<br/>
“Don’t lie right now. You will definitely remember this moment and everything that happened to you before. You will remember me,” he stands up beside me.<br/>
“If I do, I will at least despise it now and will never make the same mistake as trusting a man like you, Draco.”<br/>
I walked away from him towards the Hogwarts Castle, the place I would soon leave because of the man that I trusted.</p>
