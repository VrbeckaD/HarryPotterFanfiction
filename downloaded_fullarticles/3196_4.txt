    <p>Harry Potter stumbled across the lush green fields of Camp Half Blood, his life-size Lego face in tears. His little yellow legs pumped wildly until he reached the fireplace where all his friends sat.</p><p>"Hey, Potter!" Chuckled Lotor heinously, his mouth erect. "What is up with you?"</p><p>Lego Harry collapsed to a halt. "You wouldn't understand." He wailed. Sobs wracked his body, and Elmo had to rest one fluffy hand on his thigh to calm him down.</p><p>"I'm sure we would." Whispered the pope. "We're your friends!"</p><p>Applejack whined in agreement. Mrs. Hudson spilled some tea on herself. Barry Benson and his clan of furries buzzed. Sans chuckled. </p><p>Thank you." Harry screamed.</p><p>Batman gave a thumbs up.</p><p>"So what's wrong?" Inquired Karkat.</p><p>"Everything." Sobbed Harry. "Human Harry said I had a.........a.........a........"</p><p>"A what?" BTS said in unison.</p><p>"A small dong...."</p><p>Everyone gasped.</p><p>Princess Bubblegum fainted.</p><p>AmazingPhil covered his ears and blushed the color of tampons.</p><p>"Who." Doctor Who said.</p><p>"And I don't know what to say." Said Harry sadly, his painted eyes filling with effervescent tears.</p><p>"That is such a mean thing to say!" Said Shrek. "I'll punch him."</p><p>"No shrek don't do that." Harry moaned.</p><p>"Violence is bad." Said Applejack.</p><p>"I'm bad." Said Shrek, displaying rippling biceps and a shoulder tattoo that said "Bad Boyz".</p><p>"That's hot." Said Harry, "I mean. Not hot. I'm not gay."</p><p>Batman smiled knowingly to Karkat and Sans, who were making out. "We know.</p><p>" Who!" Said Doctor Who.</p><p>"SHUT UP DOCTOR WHO." Everyone said.</p><p>"Who." Doctor Who said sadly and stalked off.</p><p>"Okay now that he's gone we can try and deal with this problem." Said Lotor evilly.</p><p>"Okay." Said Harry.</p><p>"Sorry to burst your bubble Harry" Said Elmo. "But we don't really know how big your.,.......thing really is.It could be small for all we know."</p><p>"Oh my god." Said Harry.</p><p>They were right. The only way to disprove Human Harry was to prove that his member was actually huge.</p><p>Harry stepped up to the podium, his lego body shivering.</p><p>"I have to do this guys. He said. "I need to show them I'm a big man."</p><p>He ripped off his lego legs. Underneath those lego legs were a yellow lego legs. In between those two legs rested a..........</p><p>"Oh my god." Said BTS as one.</p><p>His stick was HUGE. It was so big it whacked the Pope in the eye. The Pope was also 20 feet away.</p><p>"I need that inside me right now." Says Karkat.</p><p>BTS's d*ck's rose simultaneously through their pants.</p><p>Elmo's mouth dropped open.</p><p>AmazingPhil squeezed his eyes shut and said, "No! I'm too innocent for this!"</p><p>Princess Peach's kitty cat grew really wet. All the minions went "Oh." and fainted, their doogalloos erect.</p><p> "What's wrong with you guys?" Said Harry, trying to cover his plastic weiner dog with his lego hands. "Are you okay."</p><p>"No." Said the Pope, whose papaya ruler was sticking out of his robe. "I want to FRICK you."</p><p>
