  <strong> <span class="s1"> <em>Present</em> </span> </strong>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The omega was dressed in green and silver, a subtle indication of his which political candidate he really supported.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Hermione was not stupid, and she knew from her days in Beauxbatons, that the Potter heir was not stupid as well. Underneath that pretty face, was a calculating and cold opportunist who didn’t mind stepping on anyone as long as he was on top.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">And although, everyone saw him as just a pretty little thing, Hermione knew better.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Hermione would not have known too if she hadn’t accidentally seen the omega folding his Potions essay paper away, Hermione getting a glimpse of a perfect score.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry had smirked then, uncharacteristically smug, and left.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">After that encounter, Hermione had been curious as to why Harry never made it into the honor rolls if he was smart. Getting a perfect score on a Potions essay was no joke. Hermione had never gotten one before—although maybe that was because their professor was racist against her.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">As it turned out, after Hermione’s careful observation, Harry rather liked looking as though he did not know anything. There was always an amused look in his eye as he would almost write the wrong answers deliberately in his exams. If there was one thing the Potter heir thrived on, it was people underestimating him for his pretty face.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">It’s been years since they graduated. Hermione has never forgotten Harry. She doubted anyone could.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Here they were now—Harry, performing his socialite duties and Hermione… well, Hermione working hard at her ministry job especially now that the elections were coming up.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The elections were all England could talk about for three months, and news outlets had been dying to know which of the runners the omega was voting for, since his Potter name was one of the most influential names out there. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The omega had been unusually coy and would completely steer the topic into a different direction such as who he was wearing or which alpha he was dating right now. Or how, uncharacteristically, he was <em>not</em> dating any alphas at the moment as he looked right at the camera in one his trademark playful smiles.</span>
</p>
<hr/><p class="p1">
  <strong> <span class="s1"> <em>Five Years Ago</em> </span> </strong>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Tom Riddle smiles at Luna Lovegood and the omega heiress smiles back—just as gullible as he remembered her from their days at Hogwarts. Luna was pretty, but what Tom really wanted was the influence of the Lovegoods.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Luna was… hard to talk to. Her interests were rather… <em>unique</em> but it did help that Tom was knowledgeable of many things. It was tiring to converse with her and even more so when he had five more people to deal with.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">This was his first ministry ball in two years since he graduated and although it did introduce Tom to some major players in the political scene, Tom had no patience to deal with the simpletons that were trying to engage him in what they thought were <em>higher</em> conversation.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Have you seen <em>him</em> yet?” He heard one of his colleagues ask a friend.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">It was the question everyone asked tonight. Where was <em>he</em>? The only reason why there was an unplanned ministry ball happening at all.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The ball, totally unplanned, was put together in haste two days after Sirius Black had casually announced that the famed Potter heir was finally returning to London after graduating from Beauxbatons. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The boy had been hidden from the public eye since his parents died, and Sirius, the man who formally adopted him into his fold, was secretive and protective. He thought it best to raise the boy away from the British magic community. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">At least, that’s what the rumors said. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">But Tom knew better. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">It was all to keep the boy away from the manipulations of Albus Dumbledore. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">As the only heir to the Potter family, the boy was one of the richest wizards in the whole of Britain. That is, when he was finally of age to claim his inheritance. More than that, he would inherit one of the most influential seats in Wizengamot making him a very powerful political figure if he chose to exercise his pureblood right.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Sirius knew this was something Dumbledore would exploit as he had with the former Potter heir and his muggleborn wife. Sirius Black was having no more of it, it seemed. He took the boy into his care and intentionally snubbed Hogwarts as a proper school for the boy.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He would make the most powerful ally, and everyone in the ball present knew it. Everyone was in perfect attendance. The alphas dressed in their most expensive robes hoping to catch the eye and fortune of the Potter heir. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">No one could talk about anything or anyone else.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">But the boy was still nowhere to be seen.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Perhaps it had all been a farce. Sirius Black, although somewhat stable, was also tinged with the infamous Black insanity. Perhaps the Black patriarch just said the boy would come home to spite Dumbledore.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Tom looked across the room where Dumbledore was wearing the most atrocious yellow robes Tom had ever seen in his life. Who in their right mind would wear robes with gingerbread men on them? It wasn’t even Christmas. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The man was surprisingly only talking to Neville Longbottom, the closest thing he could have compared to a Potter heir. His allies were scattered across the room, strategically placed to intercept the boy if he actually appeared.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Tom smirked. His own men were scattered as well, in strict orders to bring him the boy at once if they even catch a glimpse of him.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Don’t you think so, Tom?” Tom looked at the woman who was talking to him, forgetting what exactly they were talking about. She was one of the most boring people Tom had met, but she was the wife of some influential political figure and he needed her friendship.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Of course, Astoria, you are always so insightful of these things.” Evidently, this was the right thing to say because the witch turned bright red. Luna giggled at his side.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Right on cue, the Bellatrix Black signaled to him across the room. “Ah, excuse me, but my colleague is calling me. I look forward to these little talks of ours.” He flashed her one of his charming smiles and kissed her hand. That seemed to make her completely speechless. “I’ll see you later, darling.” He says to Luna. Luna nods turning to continue her conversions with the group that gathered around them.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“He’s here,” Bellatrix says casually as Tom approached her.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Who’s he with?” Tom asks looking at where Bella was inclining her head.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“The Weasley girl.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Tom searches the crowd for the redhead. And then he sees him. The Potter heir. The omega. A sight in red, hair black as midnight, face sweet as day, almost floating as he laughed gently at what Ginny was saying. He had a beautiful tan and an even more beautiful face. He was Lily Potter’s son, no doubt.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Rather plain, isn’t he?” Bella asks in quiet jealousy. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Tom keeps his face blank. He doesn’t answer.</span>
</p>
<hr/><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry stared, rather shamelessly, as he caught sight of Tom Riddle. He was dressed in emerald green, a look that Harry was sure only he could pull off. And by the way the man looked as he walked said he knew the fact very well.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The omega suddenly wished he had worn his favorite deep green gown that showed off his eyes, because if anything, he also looked good in the color.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">And Harry was very competitive.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“That’s Tom Riddle,” Ginny had whispered slyly on his ear.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Who?” Harry asked pretending to not know what she was talking about.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“The alpha you’ve been staring at for thirty minutes now,” Ginny smirks. “You’re not the first omega to be completely smitten, you know.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Smitten... smitten wasn’t even the word for it. Something ached in Harry’s chest.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“What’s the word on him?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Oh, Harry, you have <em>no idea</em>,” Ginny grins. “He’s a genius and even purebloods like him. Well, more than like him really... his old Slytherin schoolmates <em>worship</em> him.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Fuck, Harry thought. All that on top of being incredibly attractive? Jesus Christ. He should probably to try to make his move now, it was good thing Harry was single now, and alphas like that won’t be single for lo—</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“<em>And</em> he’s got a girlfriend.” Ginny finally finishes triumphantly.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“A girlfriend?” Harry stops.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Yes, an <em>omega</em> girlfriend and not just any omega girlfriend,” Ginny days conspiratorially. “But the Lovegood heiress. Luna.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Luna? Luna Lovegood? Harry’s heart fell. Luna was as good as they come, selfless and altruistic and utterly <em>giving</em>. Harry was none of those.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>That</em> was Tom’s type?</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Those were the worst types. Because they were <em>wife </em>material. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry would bet that Luna also knew how to cook, as if being kind wasn’t enough to attract someone like Tom Riddle.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">As Harry looks at Tom, the alpha suddenly turns his head and meets Harry’s eyes. Harry is surprised, but he doesn’t look away. Instead he smirks, flips his hair, and turns around to walk away as if Tom was not, in any way at all, interesting enough for him.</span>
</p>
<hr/><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry finds Lucius, an attractive Malfoy heir who was surrounded by other rich heirs, and greets him. They’ve long been childhood friends and Harry knew Lucius always had a crush on him. He flirts shamelessly with the man, a few touches here and there, and giggles prettily about anything the alpha said. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Lucius introduces him to every one of his friends and Harry bats his eyelashes at all of them, extending his hand for them to kiss. It wasn’t an English custom but acting French singled him out. He was the new omega, exotic and pretty with elegant Parisian habits.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">There wasn’t any alpha Harry has failed to attract yet.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The laughter of the alphas are making everyone in the ball look at their direction. Harry makes sure he is well in the center of it, a spectacle of sensual red, against alphas dressed in black robes.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">At the corner of his eye, he looks at Tom, checking to see if he was looking at Harry. He wasn’t. He was fully engrossed with his omega girlfriend, talking to the Greengrasses as his arm is relaxed around Luna’s waist.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry takes a deep breath and smiles prettily at Lestrange. “All this laughter makes me feel rather <em>hot</em>.” The Lestrange heir hurries to get him a drink while Rockwood fans him.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Mmm,” Harry says to Lestrange as he hands Harry his drink. “I say, who is that pretty omega over there?” He asks innocently.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Oh Luna?"</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“She seems rather... interesting,” Harry says. “I do not know any other omegas here at the ball, I do want to be her friend.”</span>
</p>
<hr/><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Tom smirks as he walks away from Luna, feeling particularly smug about evading the Potter heir.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Did the omega think he did not know he was playing with Tom? Trying to capture his attention while enslaving other alphas’?</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry was making a move to be introduced to their circle. Rockwood and Potter are looking in their direction. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Tom makes a move to leave.</span>
</p>
<hr/><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Hermione knows Harry is toying with her senior, Tom Riddle. But Hermione had the feeling that Tom knew exactly what Harry was doing and was responding rather brilliantly. It was like a dance between them. No one was leading and yet they were in perfect synchrony.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">But no matter how they tease… they are moving slowly now toward each other. The cat and mouse game is coming to an end. </span>
</p>
<hr/><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">They finally meet at the center of the ballroom. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">A contrast of red and green. Harry’s parents were Gryffindors and knew if he studied in Hogwarts, he would be one too. Tom was a pure Slytherin to the core, eyes focused and teasing. They stop to look at each other, the lion versus the snake, omega versus alpha, pureblood versus mudblood—natural enemies, natural predators.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">It was almost meant to be.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Mr. Potter,” Tom purrs in greeting, eyes bright and wide with pleasure.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Mr. Riddle,” he greets in return. The man quirks an eyebrow up at Harry knowing his name but thankfully doesn’t say anything about it.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry recovers from his initial surprise and curtsies, careful to let the alpha see his unclaimed scent gland, and looks up at him under his lashes. “To what do I owe this pleasure?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The alpha doesn’t reply instantly, but instead takes his time to look at Harry’s form with a smirk on his lips. Harry doesn’t dare breathe.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I wanted to introduce myself to the omega who has everyone’s attention tonight.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry hums. “Evidently not the one whose attention I want the most,” he says slyly, looking at where Luna was talking to her father.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“And who says his attention is not yours?” Tom asks, quirking an elegant eyebrow up.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“He’s got an omega with him, I’m afraid.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Any alpha who sees you will forget about any omega he’s with, I’m sure,”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Will he?” Harry asks inkling his head to the side.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“He already has,” Tom says.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Suddenly, Harry remembers all the people who have tried to get close to him because he was a Potter. He stops. This was what Tom Riddle would want from him. His last name. His influence. Association with him meant gaining even more prominence than dating a Lovegood. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">What would Sirius say? What about the press? His dead parents say? That Harry would be the first to make the Potter line <em>impure</em>?</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry shakes his head.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The next morning, news broke out that the promising Undersecretary Tom Riddle and the heiress Luna Lovegood broke up... the same time that the illustrious Harry Potter started dating the Bulgarian Quidditch player, Viktor Krum.</span>
</p>
<hr/><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Tom Riddle was a genius. Tom Riddle was handsome. Charming. Brilliant.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry can’t count how many time he’s heard these words in the past year. Harry has never heard of so much fanfare from his fellow omegas about a muggleborn. Tom Riddle has been all they talked about since he became the Undersecretary of the Minister. The youngest ever.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“He’s still a muggleborn though,” Harry reminds them.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Oh, Harry,” Blaise says. “But my dad adores him. All the pureblood do. I’d say they almost see him as their own.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Draco’s dad is respects him.” Daphne Greengrass says, nodding. “Why, if Draco were an omega, I’d say they’d already be engaged.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I absolutely wouldn’t mind,” Astoria agrees, giggling with her sister. “He can take my neck anytime he wants.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry did not like that anyone in the room would throw away everything they had for Tom Riddle. Tom was a <em>mudblood.</em></span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">And anyway, Harry wasn’t just anyone.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He was Harry Potter. Beloved socialite. Perfect omega. Pureblood.</span>
</p>
<hr/><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">It was no secret that Harry Potter was a Quidditch fanatic. He was always present in the Quidditch World Cup which only happened every six years, at the best seat in the house.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">This year was different though. The Potter heir was here exclusively support his boyfriend, alpha Player of the Decade Viktor Krum. Harry was walking toward the Potter seat, dressed in a deep mahogany red, waving at his fans and some photographers when he suddenly sees someone very familiar.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Tom?” Harry asks in disbelief.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Mr. Potter,” Tom greets. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I did not know that you liked Quidditch.” Harry says in complete bewilderment.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“And why wouldn’t I?” Tom asks, one eyebrow up.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Well… I just thought…” Harry stops. He just thought it was too… <em>banal</em> for him. Like it was a waste of time. Harry surreptitiously tried to look around. Was he with a girlfriend? “How come I’ve never seen you before?” Harry asks suspiciously.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Oh, you’ve probably never sat in the general admission area.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry blushes. Of course he hasn’t. His father loved Quidditch and so did his Uncle Sirius. His seats were always the best. He’s never thought much of it before. But why did he suddenly feel ashamed? “And whose the poor rich omega have you fooled into letting you sit here this time?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Tom’s eyebrow quirks even higher. “I am alone.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Alone. Single. Tom was alone. And Harry was… was <em>not</em> single but he could fix that in—</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I’m also alo—“</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Mr. Potter, are you here to support your boyfriend, Viktor?” A mic is shoved in front of his mouth. Reporters eagerly awaiting his answer.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry thinks fast. Would it be too much for Viktor to find out Harry broke up with him through national tv? Would he be mad? Would he tell the press he only found out the same day he did? Did Viktor deserve it? And what about his sweetheart image? Would it survive if Viktor decided to destroy him? Viktor was rather… immature. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">And… can Harry be like the other pureblood omegas? Just throw away generations of purity for an alpha? Was Harry just like everyone else?</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry swallows. He makes a decision. He avoids looking at Tom.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Yes,” he says, a smile on his face. “I’m here to support him.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry risks a glance to where Tom was… but he was gone.</span>
</p>
<hr/><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">It was a banquet for people like him. For world leaders and heirs. For ancient families and people with royal blood. Worldwide influences that could easily alter reality with no more than a snap. Harry was with Germany’s First Son—Cedric Diggory. Such a handsome fellow with his blonde hair and warm brown eyes.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Harry,” the First Son says gently, sun caught in his warm eyes. His words were gentle, proper, German accent not as thick as it should be.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">But Harry didn’t like warm eyes. He liked cold blue eyes that were charming when they needed to be, teasing with Harry, and glittering dangerously with ambition.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">But those were dangerous thoughts.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Isn’t that Tom Riddle, love?” Cedric suddenly says beside him. Harry’s head whips so fast into where Cedric was looking that he heard a crack. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>“Where?” </em>Harry demands.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">And suddenly Harry’s world stops.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">There he was indeed. Head taller than anyone in the crowd. Black robes pressed to perfection. Wavy black hair carelessly resting on his forehead. And he was with the French and German ministers.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry frowns. How could that happen?</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Tom didn’t hold too much power that he could talk to leaders of countries so casually… and yet.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Why is he talking to your father?” Harry asks, tone sharp. Cedric looks at him.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Are you alright, Harry?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry blinks, almost frowning in impatience. The he realizes he’s the real Harry. Not dumb socialite Harry. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Oh yes,” he says sweetly. “I just wanted to talk to your dad.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Cedric wraps an arm around his shoulders. Harry forces himself to smile. “What on earth would you talk to him about?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry’s smile tightens. “The French Minister is close to my uncle. I must pay my respects.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Of course.” Cedric says. They make their way into the trio, Tom not even glancing in his direction. “Father,” Cedric greets his dad. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Cedric’s dad turns to face them and so does the French Minister. Tom looks at Harry with a raised eyebrow and a knowing smirk. Harry does not dare look at him.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Ah, pardon me, this is my son and his omega girlfriend, Harry Potter.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Hello,” Harry curtsies, low and proper. There is silence before the French Minister recognizes him. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Mr. Potter!”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Sir,” he blushes prettily.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“You have only grown more beautiful,” he says appreciatively. “You would do well with Mr. Riddle here who is as handsome as yourself—“ Rightly so. “But it is a pity he is already taken, are you not, my boy?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Before Tom could answer, a vision of white suddenly appears beside Tom. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry almost gasps. No. No. No. Anyone but <em>her</em>—</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“We must excuse ourselves,” The French Minister suddenly says apologetically, saving Harry form openly reacting. “Albus Dumbledore seeks our audience.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The ministers leave.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">There is silence as they all take in each other. The most beautiful people in the room no doubt. People were already starting to look.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>“Harry,”</em> Fleur Delacour purrs, clear blue eyes staring straight into his green. Her hand wraps itself around Tom’s arm, a chilling smile forms at her lips. “It is good to see you again,” She says, eyes gleaming, her sexy French accent thick.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Of course, Harry thinks. Of all the people Tom could be in a relationship with, it had to be Fleur Delacour, the only woman who Harry considered a rival since his first day in Beauxbatons. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Fleur,” Harry greets back, a smile on his face. Harry swears he sees her eyes flash as they shake their hands. “You have not changed.” </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">It was a lie. And they both knew it.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Fleur has only become more radiant. She had a glow that only her Veela genes could give her. She has grown taller too, her aristocratic cheekbones ready to cut anyone who comes in her way.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Ah, but I am not the one who is on Monsieur Cedric Diggory’s arms tonight, eh?” Harry’s smile freezes on his lips and he knows he does not imagine the smirk at the Veela’s face. She was right. She was not on Cedric’s arm. She was on Tom’s. They both knew who really was winning here.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Cedric laughs good-naturedly. “Mademoiselle Fleur, you are ever the flatterer. Your fiancee might get offended.” Finacee? Harry’s eyes whips to both their hands. And there it was. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Rings. Engagement rings.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Ah, Tom knows I am his through and through,” Fleur giggles as she tightens her hold on Tom, eyes never leaving Harry’s. Harry risks looking at Tom. But he was looking at Fleur only, charming indulging smile at his face. He looked happy.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry grabs Cedric by the hand. “We are both lucky then.” Harry says, feeling something in his body he does not like.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Yes,” Fleur says slowly. “<em>Very</em> lucky.” Fleur agrees, turning to kiss Tom on the mouth.</span>
</p>
<hr/><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"> <em>“Mr. Potter.”</em> </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry stops gulping down the donuts he’d been eating. Merlin. “What the fuck?” He frowns at a smirking Tom Riddle.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Language, my dear,” Tom says. Harry rolls his eyes. “Cedric and you have a fight?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>Cedric?</em> “How did you know?” Harry’s eyebrow raises up.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Donuts aren’t the only thing you’ve eaten in abundance tonight.” Tom smiles at him, tone teasing.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“This figure stays the same no matter how many donuts I eat.” Harry says haughtily, stuffing another donut in his mouth. Harry looks around. "You and Fleur have a fight?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“She’s helping her father do the final touches of his speech,” Tom says picking a grape from the dessert table. He puts it in his mouth, eyes never leaving Harry’s. The flash from his ring blinds Harry for a second.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Shouldn’t you be helping your fiancee?"</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Fleur can take care of herself,” he dismisses. The casual trust Tom gives her makes Harry lose his appetite. Would Tom trust him like that? Does he know? Does he even know what Harry’s capable of underneath the socialite facade? Sure, Fleur graduated at the top their class. But did Tom know Harry could do so just as easily?</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">There’s silence before Tom speaks again.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“He’s not your type,” he says seriously.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry almost chokes. “Isn’t he?” Harry maintains eye contact, face unreadable. The first thing that came to Harry’s mind was ask Tom if Fleur was even really his type. He stops himself. Fleur was <em>anyone’s</em> type. “Tell me, Undersecretary, what exactly <em>is</em> my type?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Tom suddenly flashes him a sharp grin and somehow Harry finds himself regretting asking the question. “Obviously, he’d be tall.” Tom says. “Dark haired, of course.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Of course,” Harry says sarcastically, fighting the urge to roll his eyes again.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“A person who runs in the same circle as you.” The Tom’s eyes gleam. “Someone you’d recognize as your equal at once. Charming. Charismatic. Exactly like you.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Indeed.” Harry nods solemnly. “And I suppose you’ve got a specific person in mind?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Oh, you know him very well.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry’s eyebrow shoots up in the air. “And I suppose you know him as well.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Of course,” Tom says smugly.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry’s heart beats fast in his chest. Was this it? Was Tom finally going to acknowledge the tension between them?</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>“Neville Longbottom.”</em> Tom says slyly, eyes gleaming under the ballroom lights.</span>
</p>
<hr/><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Fleur Delacour did not like Harry Potter.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Fleur always wondered how no one could see the facade he put on for other people. He pretended to be dumb for fun, reveled a little too much into his inheritance, and did not care about being responsible.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Perhaps she should have pitted the boy for not having parents to guide him into becoming a proper omega. He was a mischief and yet everybody loved him. Not even the teachers had the heart to reprimand him in Bauxbatons.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">But Fleur? Fleur had to watch her every move, study hard, and made sure she never slipped. It was the price she payed for being born into the Delacours. It was what they expected of her, what <em>everyone</em> expected from her. The responsibility she carried has been heavy since the beginning. And Harry mocked it everyday.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Fleur watches as Harry talks with her fiancee.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He was frowning, rolling his eyes even. His guard was down, unafraid to show his real emotions to Tom. He was talking loud too, animatedly—a side he only showed to his Weasley best friend. He looks annoyed yet also secretly amused.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">To a casual onlooker, Tom would seem as though he was being his natural charming self. But he too had his guard down. Tom was trying not laugh but his eyes clearly were.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Fleur Delacour did not like Harry Potter.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Pity she couldn’t say the same about her fiancee.</span>
</p>
<hr/><p class="p1">
  <strong> <span class="s1"> <em>Present</em> </span> </strong>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Mr. Potter,” the alpha greets, voice deep and rich, just as deliciously suggestive as Harry remembered. He curtsies, carefully tilting his head to the side, so the alpha could see his scent gland.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Mr. Riddle,” he purrs. He rises innocently, as if he did not just try to outrightly seduce the alpha with his scent.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Tom looks at his subtle green clothes and smirks. “You look good.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“So do you, Tom."</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“How was France?,” Tom asks, taking his hand and kissing it slowly. The heat from the kiss makes Harry’s breath hitch. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">It takes a while for him to recover and he smiles. “I’m gone for a little while and suddenly, you run for Minister?” Harry teases.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Ah, that is nothing compared to breaking my heart,” Tom says, a smirk at his lips.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Tom was talking about Harry breaking off another engagement with a French viscount.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Giddy—only Tom Riddle could make Harry giddy, making Harry smile so wide from the feeling in his stomach. “Don’t think news of your dallies did not reach France, Mr. Riddle.” He responds prettily. Harry looks at Tom’s hand, where his engagement ring used to be. The engagement was called off for “unknown reasons”—as Harry recalls from the Daily Prophet.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry cannot forget or explain the relief he felt when the news broke out.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">They both look at each other, eyes gleaming under the lights. The blunt flirting has always been present since they first met five years ago.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Careful now, Minister,” Harry says with a teasing smile. “People might think we’re in love.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“And what if they do?” Tom replies coolly.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry raises an eyebrow. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Was this it? Was this finally their chance? They were both finally single, at the same time. Tom will become Minister. And Harry has finally inherited his Potter inheritance.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">There was nothing stopping them now. They were playing on equal fields. Their potentials already both realized.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">They hold power that is equal.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">It was Harry’s turn to speak now. Tom was giving him a choice.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Marry me,” Harry says breathlessly.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">How long have they been playing this game? How long was Harry going to watch as Tom dated countless heiresses and omegas when he could have a Potter heir? <em>The</em> Potter heir?</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I’m not going to sit idly by waiting to catch you between girlfriends, Tom, I—“ Harry widens his eyes as he realizes he’s blabbering and when he sees the look on Tom’s face.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Wasn’t Harry the one who always had doubts about being with Tom? What right did he have to be speaking so carelessly?</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">His heart fell. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I–I’m sorry–“ Harry stutters. “I didn’t know what came over me,” Harry says looking down, cheeks red. He has never been this outspoken before, never been this blunt. But Tom always did things to him. “Please,” he pleads. “Forget everything I said—“</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Tom steps forward, the action so quick that Harry gasps as Tom is suddenly too close for comfort. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“You think I’ll let you go back on that that easily?” Tom says darkly, and suddenly Harry was afraid. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">A cruel deep laugh escaped Tom’s lips, but nothing prepared Harry for what he would say next. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“You’re mine now,” he growls, placing his hand on Harry’s back and pulling him flush against Tom’s body. Harry’s heart beats faster. “I’ll mark you now if I have to,” Tom says. “You have no idea how long I’ve wanted to bite you here,” Tom’s finger grazes on Harry’s scent gland and he shivers at the<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>brief contact, feeling slick gather between his legs at the declaration.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“T—Tom,” he stutters, suddenly feeling very dizzy. Without really realizing, Harry leans into Tom, face just centimeters away from the alpha, Harry’s eyes glazed and mind numb with Tom’s proximity to him.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Stop baring your neck to me,” Tom orders, voice deep and commanding which only made Harry want to submit, tilting his neck even further. “So submissive tonight, aren’t you, love?” Tom growls lightly into his ear.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry shivers as his knees buckle at Tom’s authority. “Answer me,” he demands.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I—Tom—please,” he begs. He doesn’t even know what he’s begging for. Just knows he needed Tom closer to him, needed that scent to fill his lungs, wanted his alpha’s praise, his attention, his everything.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Behave,” Tom purrs in his ear. Harry nods as he swallows, obeying the alpha. Tom smirks and Harry almost purrs at making the alpha proud. “I will court you for a week,” the alpha whispers in his ear. “</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry feels his lips graze on his neck and his breath hitches in his throat. Tom chuckles.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“And then I wait no longer.” Tom promises darkly.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Harry nods, weak, unable to wait any longer as well.</span>
</p>
<hr/><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Hermione watches the alpha and the omega. They were too close to each other for it be called proper. They looked too intimate that Hermione felt as if she should look away. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">But how could she? This was history being made. This was probably a marriage in the making.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Hermione knew countless alphas has passed through Harry’s hands and Hermione has watched all the omegas Tom brought into the ministry.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">But none of those had the same fire as these two. The chemistry was undeniable. And everyone noticed. They were all looking at the couple, whispering to each other.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">It was <em>almost</em> a scandal.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">But by how long they’ve both teased and waited for each other, Hermione had a feeling they’d already be married in a week.</span>
