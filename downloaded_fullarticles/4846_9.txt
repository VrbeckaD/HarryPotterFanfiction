    <p>Summer vacations always seemed to pass by in a blur ever since Queenie had been at Ilvermorny, and this one was no different. Once the fall came around, Queenie would be entering her Sophomore year at Ilvermorny and her professors had happily set her several essays which had needed to be completed over the summer break. It wasn't until the final couple of weeks that Queenie was able to enjoy the bright, warm weather alongside her older sister, Tina. They were both sat outside, Queenie in the old rocking chair which had stood on their grandma's porch for as long as she could remember. Tina was lying happily on a small patch of grass in the yard, lazily flicking through the pages of her book.</p><p>"I don't understand you, Teenie," Queenie said teasingly, using her personal nickname for her older sister. "We're almost at the end of summer vacation and all you want to do is read. And it's not even a book that's part of your required reading material for your senior year."</p><p>Tina's eyes flicked up from her book, a wide smile on her features. "Well if you didn't keep making me push back our visit to Boston to buy our school supplies, maybe I would've already started on the required reading material, although I'm sure that you would whine at me every second that I did."</p><p>"And you know there is a reason for that," Queenie laughed in response. "I know you're studying for your NEWTs this year, but that doesn't mean for a second you can't enjoy your summer vacation. You're not the only one with important exams this year, and you don't see me spending all my time studying do you?"</p><p>"Well I'm sure you would be if you weren't spending so much time practicing and perfecting your Legilimency," Tina stated simply, her eyebrows raising slightly as her full attention settled on Queenie who rolled her eyes in response.</p><p>"I can't help it," Queenie said softly, giving Tina a small and slightly apologetic smile. "People are just more interesting when you can see their thoughts and memories. I'm just curious as to why people act the way they do, what goes through their mind and seeing some of their memories. It's fascinating, and I try to avoid using Legilimency without people's consent. Not everyone is as understanding as you are and don't always know I would never read their thoughts to be malicious in any way."</p><p>"Aww Queenie, you know I understand why you do it," Tina replied as she pushed herself up into a sitting positon. "I admire your patience at perfecting what you can do, one day it's going to be a particularly valuable skill for you to utilise. Sometimes I just think that you could better use your time to study for your upcoming exams."</p><p>Queenie smiled in response, getting up from the rocking chair and walking down the porch steps to settle down on the lawn next to Tina. "Alright mom, consider me sufficiently scolded," she replied, playfully nudging Tina's shoulder. "We'll be visiting Boston tomorrow to get our school supplies, then you can study all you like for the remainder of the summer vacation, although I don't quite understand why you want to waste your last bit of summer freedom. You'll be spending the majority of your senior year studying for your NEWT finals alongside your duties as Head Girl. You don't need to let any of that interfere with the last week of vacation that we're spending at home."</p><p>"And what happens if I don't study?" Tina asked, wrapping an arm around Queenie's shoulder and giving her a small squeeze. "The whole point of me getting good grades on my OWLs was so I was on the right track for the MACUSA Auror program. It's important that I do well in my NEWT finals as well. And don't forget that this year is important for you as well, it's not just your OWLs but you also discuss your career options, decide on what route you want to take with your career outside of Ilvermorny."</p><p>"You're not exactly selling my sophomore year to me, Teenie," Queenie laughed in response. "I don't want to think about the year ahead and how much studying is going to be involved." She paused momentarily and shuddered before her head turned towards the house, Queenie's attention pulled elsewhere momentarily before she looked at her sister again. "Anyway dinner is almost ready and Granny wants to discuss our plans for the trip to New York city tomorrow."</p><p>Tina sighed, unwrapping her arm from around her sister's should and pushing herself to her feet, offering to help her sister up. "Itâ€™s the same plan we've had for the past few years where Granny has allowed us to buy our own school supplies on our own."</p><p>"I know," Queenie murmured soothingly, taking her sister's hand and pulling herself up. "She just wants a rough idea of when we'll be leaving and what time she can expect us back, that's all."</p><p> Tina didn't reply, shaking her head slightly as they fell into step beside one another, making their way up the porch steps and through the screen door for dinner.</p>
