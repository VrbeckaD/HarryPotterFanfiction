    <p>I<br/>
It's not that the windows are small, it's just that they're very high up, meaning that the sunlight only reaches the floor in the, in his opinion, too short moments before and after the sun has reached it's highest point. At any other time of the day, and of course during the night, the cell is veiled in darkness. And that's not even the worst part, no, the worst parts are the smell of moss and fungi growing on the walls, and the moist feeling of any surface he can touch, but the sun can't.</p>
<p>And during winter, it's cold, too. Way too cold for the ratty, fraying old blanket to warm up a wizard who used to be able to cast warming spells for as long a he can remember. But he's been here for years, and he learned a long time ago that there's no point in attempting to complain. They keep him alive, more responsibility for him than that, they don't have, so they don't bother. He's not even mad. He stopped being mad years ago. Now, he's just tired. If the Daily Prophet could interview him now, they'd probably ask how he feels, being locked up in Nurmengard, all alone. 'Tired', he would answer. 'Tired, old, and every part of my body aches.'<br/>
But the Prophet isn't here. Not yet, that is to say. They would surely swarm around the castle the moment he would be released, which was quite soon. So soon, actually, that they might already be outside. Whether they are able to hear the bittersweet melody that Gellert Grindelwald is currently whistling, is a question only they can answer, and since they are usually the ones to ask the questions, instead of answer them, the answer to this one probably won't ever be discovered.</p>
<p>He flinches at the cracking sound of someone apparating just outside of his cell. You can't blame him, he hasn't heard much sounds for the past 15 years he's spent in this prison cell. Maybe a rainstorm, or a crow calling from far away, but nothing right in front of his face.<br/>
Which is where, now, a man stands in an official Ministry uniform, right behind the bars.<br/>
"Goodday" the man greets, more out of habit than an actual wish for this prisoner to have a good day. When the man gets an empty stare, but no reply, he decides to continue himself. "Gellert Grindelwald, this day marks the end of your imprisonment. Today you will be taken out of this cell, and back into the Wizarding World. However, considering your past crimes, you still won't be allowed to use magic. You will be wearing an enchanted bracelet, which prohibits you from casting any spells. This is an official term of your parole, and if you don't agree with it, we're not allowed to let you out of this cell. Do you understand, and agree, to this term of parole?"<br/>
A pale, bony arm is stretched out through the bars, and at the Ministry employee, waiting for the bracelet to be put in place.<br/>
The employee, however, shifts on his feet a bit awkwardly, and can't help to recoil a bit from the outstretched hand. "Ahem, I'm sorry, sir, but I'm afraid we're going to need a verbal confirmation for legal reasons." he supplies, feeling a bit like he's the unfortunate child who's be chosen by the English teacher to read the biggest monologue in the Shakespeare play.<br/>
"Yes, I understand, and agree to, the terms of my parole." says a gravely voice, sounding like it hasn't been used in years, which is quite possibly the case.<br/>
"Ah, erm, alright." The Ministry worker fumbles with his bag, then pulls out a metallicly shining, flat, quite broad, bracelet with an intricate pattern carved in it. He then slides the bracelet onto the still stretched out arm, taking great care not to make any skin contact. Once the bracelet is on Grindelwald's arm, it shrinks to a prefect fit, making it impossible to slide off, and the pattern starts glowing a soft yellow, only visible because of the darkness of the cell.<br/>
"One last note," the ministry man says. "The length of time for your parole has not been set yet. It is entirely dependent on your behaviour once back in the Wizarding World. The restrictions on your magical ability, too, are dependent on your behaviour. Behave well, and the restriction may be loosened, allowing you to cast simple, harmless spells. Any funny buisness, and we're back here, I'm afraid."<br/>
Again, no answer.<br/>
"Right," says the Ministry employee, sounding quite relieved the worst part of his job is over and done with, "You may now follow me outside. That is..." He hesitates. "...can You stand, sir?"<br/>
An undignified huff, and a fair amount of struggling later, and Grindelwald is on his feet.<br/>
"It isn't a long walk" chatters the employee, who's excited to smell fresh air again soon, "We just have to leave this cell, see, as we can't apparate in there." The employee shifts to the right, and a second person appears, also in ministry clothing, with an old-fashioned key. The lock screeches and complains, but the bars swing open after a bit of a struggle. Grindelwald sets foot outside his cell. Fifteen years have passed, things have changed, emotions have changed, and he's so, so, ready to finally be able to live again.</p>
