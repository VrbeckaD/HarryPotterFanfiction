    <p>I was tired.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>...So very, very tired.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Tired of living.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Tired of watching others go about, living their happy lives. Laughing with those smiles, the constant gossip. Thriving in ...this trash of a world. A world that speaks volumes upon volumes of peace. Promises of a better tomorrow.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Where?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Where is the peace everyone promised?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Where is the better tomorrow?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Species are dying just because 'they were in the way' 'it'll be good for business' 'tomorrow will sort itself out' 'don't worry, you make a difference, you'll leave your mark' 'of course I love you, the both of you' 'wow, Trump got elected'</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Yeah. The world looks like utopia, doesn't it? Just like fashion, history is on repeat. This is the world I'm forced to live in. 'Ignorance is bliss' easily comes to mind. The greed I'm forced to watch as politics grow. I will admit the ARE properly named poli-TICs, bloody blood sucking parasites. I'm not the only one here who's 'tired', just look at all those school shootings.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>No.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>No.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>DON'T get me wrong.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>They are tragedies.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>They are sad and horrible tragedies.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>They should have been prevented. They have no place in 'Utopia'. Right?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>This is the world we live in. The world I am tired of. The bullies written off as innocent victims, the tortured now get painted Red in blood. The blood of the 'innocenct'. How is it, in this Utopia, bullies get painted in innocent light, while the people like us get better down and blamed for Every. Little. Thing?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We tried to stand tall.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We tried to find another way. But you all just don't listen.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Why don't you hear us?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When we cry for help?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When we try to explain?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Why is it, when they whisper we get punished?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It can't be because we aren't good. We are always 'good'. Perfect in every way. Just like we're expected.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And Why do you only come when we fight back!? Why Do yOu OnlY CaRe WhEN dEatH iS iNVoleD!?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>*wheeze* *wheeze* *wheeze*</p>
<p> </p>
<p>'Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will for ever shape me'</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Maybe this world is 'Utopia'.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>A Utopia for birthing 'monsters'</p>
<p> </p>
<p>You may be wondering if I am one such monster. One of those that would gun down a school, in cold hard blood, murdering hundreds of 'innocents'.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Let's get one thing straight, there are no 'innocent'. Bystanders, yes. Peers? Yes. People that saw and did absolutely nothing? ...Yes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So. Am I a monster?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The answer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Is.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>No.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But...</p>
<p> </p>
<p>That's the beauty,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>...isn't it?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>For how can a monster know what it is? How can it see what it's become in a world that lets monsters thrive?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>No.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>No. I have never attacked my school.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>No. I've never seen it happen.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>I saw the news.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The One<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span> side they showed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Attacks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Not what lead to the attacks, the years upon years of torment and anguish that feed that 'monster' that caused this. I fail to see how no one saw this coming.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>After all those cries.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>After all those tears.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>What would you expect?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you had only Listened.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We wouldn't be here.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I wouldn't be here.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Why do you refuse to listen?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>...</p>
<p> </p>
<p>...</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Again no one answers, even when I shout to the sky.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>They are cruel.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>You are Cruel.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Why only take a glance?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Why do you sneer before walking away?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Why do, are you pulling out your phones?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Is it because I'm a coward?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Because I refuse to go out with a bang?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Is it so wrong that I want to be forgotten?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Is it wrong Not to fight?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>...</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Then what is right?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What could possibly be 'right' when, all this feels so ...wrong.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So very, very wrong.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>I'm tired.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>...So very, very tired.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>And so...</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>I let go...</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Before my world, thankfully, turned black.</p>
