    <h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
    <p>Remus always studied in the same position, always next to Sirius on the common room sofa, and always until an obscenely late hour. He’d hold an offensively large textbook in one hand, and prop his head up with the other. Sirius found it maddening for several reasons. </p>
<p>Firstly, after a few hours, when the fire had burnt down to its embers and even the portraits began snoring gently, Sirius would realize they were alone. And alone time with Remus? Let’s just say it was very precious. Their secret rendezvous in the prefect bathrooms, or even the quick, blissfully dirty meetings in broom closets had grown few and far between as exams drew in. And that brought Sirius right to his second issue. </p>
<p>The minute he realized he was alone with Remus, he couldn’t <em>think</em>. At least, not about anything but Remus. Not about anything but sliding his hands along his skin, stealing kisses, finally owning his body the way he wished he could every second of the day. </p>
<p>And that brought Sirius to the third problem. It was the way Remus’s little finger would absently find its way to his mouth when he was concentrating. How was Sirius supposed to study when all he could do was stare at Remus’s finger as it traced his bottom lip like that? A bottom lip he’d very much like to bite down on. Sirius shook his head and forced his eyes back to the book on his lap. </p>
<p>
  <em>‘Avoid the Red Cap, a Dark dwarfish creature that lurks in places where blood has been-’</em>
</p>
<p>But it also didn’t help that Remus’s head, tipped to the side like that, gave Sirius a perfect view of his sharp jawline, and the dark stubble that faded into the pale skin of his neck. Because now, <em>now</em> Sirius was thinking about dragging his teeth across that soft skin. In fact, he was staring at the exact spot, that he <em>knew</em> would make Remus moan out the moment he kissed it. <em>No</em>, dammit, back to the book. </p>
<p>
  <em>‘Avoid the Red Cap, a Dark dwarfish creature that lurks in places where blood has been shed <em>and will-’</em></em>
</p>
<p>Oh, but <em>now</em> Remus was stretching out on the sofa, shuffling his legs onto Sirius’s lap until he was lying down. Sirius sunk his teeth into his bottom lip as the muscles in Rem’s arm pushed against his school shirt as he held the heavy textbook in the air. What sort of reading position was <em>that</em>? Sirius could think of far better positions for him. <strike>Most of them involving his cock.</strike> Sirius shook his head, but let his eyes stay on Remus… the untucked shirt he could so easily slip his fingers underneath, the tensed forearms that would be much better utilized around his body, the two buttons that were undone at the top of his shirt, and the piercing eyes that were now staring straight at him. </p>
<p>“Sirius.” Remus’s eyes dropped to Sirius’s hand pointedly.</p>
<p>Sirius followed, surprised to see he had been kneading the inside of Remus’s thigh in frustration. </p>
<p>He grinned, sliding his hand a little higher. “What?”</p>
<p>Sirius didn’t miss the way Remus’s eyelids flickered. </p>
<p>“Behave, Black.” A smirk played on the corner of his lips.</p>
<p>Sirius smiled at the cloudy look in his boyfriend’s eyes, and withdrew his hand. “Sorry.” </p>
<p>
  <em>‘Avoid the Red Cap, a Dark dwarfish creature that lurks in places where blood has been shed <em>and will-’</em></em>
</p>
<p>“<em>Sirius</em>.” This time Remus’s warning sounded just a <em>little</em> rough. </p>
<p>Sirius looked down, his palm had been pressing down on his crotch, trying to fight the arousal there. His eyes darted around the empty common room, he wanted to make Remus say his name like that over and over. </p>
<p>“What?” Sirius asked, innocent eyes wide. </p>
<p>Before Rem could reply, Sirius tossed his textbook aside and stretched out his lean body in an exaggerated yawn, hooking his thumb into the waistband of his trousers and tugging down a little, revealing the ‘v’ shaped muscles there. </p>
<p>Remus rolled his eyes. “You know exactly what you’re doing Black.” </p>
<p>Sirius didn’t miss the way Remus’s chest had begun to rise and fall a little faster than necessary. </p>
<p>“Don’t know what you’re talking about.”</p>
<p>Remus shook his head. “Just c’mere you idiot.”</p>
<p>He smirked, sliding his hand along Remus’s thigh as he moved to hover over his boyfriend’s body. The book slipped from Remus’s hand and hit the floor with a heavy <em>thud</em> as Sirius slid a hand under his shirt, skin finally meeting skin. Remus’s warmth sunk into him, and Sirius buried his face in his neck with a deep sigh. </p>
<p>Remus’s fingers curled around Sirius’s shirt, and both boys exhaled with the relief of each other’s touch. </p>
<p>“Missed you.” Sirius murmured into Remus’s neck.</p>
<p>Remus hummed in agreement, shifting to slip his arms around Sirius’s body, rubbing a hand along his back.  </p>
<p>Sirius’s lips had begun planting long, lazy kisses along Remus’s neck, his tongue slipping out to taste his skin and pulling approving rumbles from Remus’s throat. </p>
<p>“Stop it, you’re turning me on.” Remus sighed, pulling his arms tighter around Sirius and pressing his body closer.</p>
<p>“<em>Sirius</em>” Remus’s head fell back onto the arm of the sofa as the kisses deepened.</p>
<p>Sirius finally surfaced, grinning. “You were turning <em>me</em> on.” </p>
<p>“I wasn’t even doing anything.” Remus rasped. </p>
<p>“You don’t have to.” Murmured Sirius. </p>
<p>Remus laughed, bringing his head up to meet his boyfriend’s eye. </p>
<p>“We need to study, Black. Want me to sit somewhere else?” </p>
<p>Sirius smirked, his eyes flashing darkly “Depends, will you be naked?”</p>
<p>Remus rolled his eyes but his smirk grew. “C’mon, I <em>have</em> to…” </p>
<p>Sirius dipped his head, running his tongue along Remus’s throat and beginning to suck at his pulse point as he spoke. </p>
<p>“…’mmportant study..ing… exammn…” Remus’s voice slurred as Sirius’s hand skimmed over his tightening crotch. </p>
<p>Rem bucked in frustration, grinning as he leapt up and flipped Sirius over on to his back, causing him to yelp.</p>
<p>“You know what, you’re a <em>bad dog</em>.” He smirked, pinning Sirius down and straddling him roughly. </p>
<p>“Fuck” Sirius’s eyes rolled backwards as Remus’s arousal pressed against his own.</p>
<p>“I’ll make you a deal.” Remus murmured. </p>
<p>Sirius felt Remus’s fingers tangle in his hair, gently tugging his head to meet his boyfriend’s cloudy gaze. “Sirius. A deal.”</p>
<p>“Anything.” Sirius hummed, his body already submitting to his boyfriend’s wish. “As long as the prize is you.” </p>
<p>Remus grinned, sliding off Sirius’s lap. “Good.” </p>
<p>Sirius watched as Remus kneeled on the floor in front of him. </p>
<p>“<em>You</em> have to try and study.” Remus said. “While <em>I</em> distract you, the way you’ve been distracting me.”</p>
<p>Sirius threw his head back in despair.  </p>
<p>“If you sit right there, and keep your eyes on this book, the <em>whole</em> time, you win me.” The sparkle in Remus’s eyes sent waves through Sirius. “But if you <em>don’t</em>, you’ll have to do everything I say. For a <em>week</em>.” </p>
<p><em>Fuck</em>. Sirius’s breathing was shallow, and his cock was already painfully hard in anticipation of an event that might not even <em>happen</em>. His head was already clouded and confused. </p>
<p>“I’ll do it.” Sirius breathed. </p>
<p>“Attaboy.” Remus winked. “Here.” </p>
<p>He handed his ridiculously large, heavy textbook to Sirius, flipping it open to page 394. </p>
<p>Sirius snorted, still dazed. “Werewolves? Really?”</p>
<p>Remus grinned. “Should be a breeze for you. I think you’re better acquainted with werewolves than most.” </p>
<p>Sirius couldn’t help but take in the boy sitting before him with hungry eyes. “Just the hot ones.” He smiled. </p>
<p>Remus smirked. “Eyes on the book. And don’t move until I tell you.”</p>
<p>“How long before I win my prize?” Sirius asked, his eyes snapping to the page. </p>
<p>“Let’s see if you can last ten minutes.” Remus grinned. </p>
<p>Sirius grit his teeth, dropping his gaze to the book. “Consider it done.” </p>
<p>
  <em>The Ministry of Magic’s policies on werewolves have always been muddled and inefficient- </em>
</p>
<p>Sirius’s heart was already beating like a drum, and he bit down hard on his lip as he heard Remus’s tie fall to the floor. </p>
<p>“Ignore me.” Remus murmured. “Just getting comfortable.” </p>
<p>Sirius sighed. </p>
<p>
  <em>The Ministry of Magic’s policies on werewolves have always been muddled and inefficient. A Werewolf Code-</em>
</p>
<p>Remus walked behind the sofa. Sirius could feel his presence torturously close to him. Was he unbuttoning his shirt? Don’t look, <em>don’t look</em>.</p>
<p>
  <em>A Werewolf Code of Conduct was developed in 1637-</em>
</p>
<p>Remus leant down, his warm breath hitting the back of Sirius’s neck and making him shudder with anticipation. </p>
<p>Rem chuckled. “Scared of the big bad wolf?” </p>
<p>Sirius didn’t think before the words came out. “I’m more scared of you leaving me alone, Rem.”</p>
<p>Remus’s heart felt like it had swollen in his chest. He pressed a kiss into Sirius’s neck.</p>
<p>“I love you.” He murmured, peppering kisses along his boyfriends skin.</p>
<p>Sirius let out a long breath. “You’re not going to make this deal easy, are you?”</p>
<p>“Nope.” Remus grinned, running his hands along his boyfriend’s shoulders as he reached around to undo the first few buttons of his shirt. </p>
<p><em>Don’t move. Don’t look. </em>Sirius did has best to lock his body in place, he <em>had</em> to win this.</p>
<p>“I’m not convinced you’re studying right now.” Remus clicked his tongue. “In fact, I think you should read aloud.”</p>
<p>Sirius grit his teeth. “Really?” </p>
<p>Remus’s fingers gently ran through Sirius’s hair, tucking it behind his ear so Remus could brush his lips against the sensitive skin. </p>
<p>“Do you want to fuck me, Black?” He whispered, calmly. “Do you want to hear me shout your name while you come inside me, Black?”</p>
<p>Sirius tried his best to keep from simply tackling the boy behind him and carrying him up to the dormitory himself. </p>
<p>“Sirius.” Remus nipped at his earlobe, running his tongue along the sensitive flesh.</p>
<p>“I want you.” Sirius hissed. </p>
<p>“Then study.” Remus said, simply. “Aloud.” </p>
<p>Sirius shook his head. “The things I’m going to do to you.” He murmured. </p>
<p>He took a deep breath. </p>
<p>“A Werewolf Code of Conduct was developed in 1637. Which -″ </p>
<p>Sirius faltered for a moment as Remus’s warm hand slid over his shoulder and down his chest, just as his lips began pressing kisses down his neck.</p>
<p>“-which werewolves were supposed to sign, promising not to…to attack anyone” </p>
<p>Remus’s soft tongue slipped from his mouth, tasting Sirius’s skin and making him stumble through the sentence. </p>
<p>Sirius let out a puff of air, continuing with renewed determination. </p>
<p>“…but to lock themselves up securely every month.” </p>
<p>Remus’s warm, wet mouth began sucking bruises into the crook of Sirius’s neck. </p>
<p>“Unresp- unspru-….<em>un-sur-prisingly</em>, nobody signed the Code, as nobody was-“</p>
<p>Remus chuckled as Sirius stumbled breathily over his words. Sirius pulled the book closer to his face.</p>
<p>“…prepared to walk into the Ministry and admit to being a werewolf, a problem from which…” </p>
<p>Sirius almost breathed a sigh of relief when Remus stood up, walking back around the sofa to face him and giving him a few moments of easy reading. </p>
<p>“…the later Werewolf Registry also suffered. For years, this Werewolf Registry, on which every werewolf was supposed to enter their-” </p>
<p>Remus knelt on the floor in front of Sirius, reaching his hands up to cover Sirius’s, and guiding the book closer still to his face, blocking all view. </p>
<p>“Stay.” Remus smiled. </p>
<p>Sirius gulped, and continued his reading, despite the tingles across his body that were all but out of control.</p>
<p>“…their name and personal details, has remained incomplete and unreliable, because so ma-” </p>
<p>Sirius gasped as Remus’s hands travelled up and along his legs, thighs, and eventually rested comfortably on his arousal. </p>
<p>“so man- so many of the- the newly…newly-bitten sought to”</p>
<p>Sirius was fast becoming breathless as Remus rubbed his hand up and down his hard cock. </p>
<p>“…conceal their con…dition and escape <em>the-uh”</em></p>
<p>When he felt the tug of Remus pulling down his zipper and reaching inside his boxers he nearly lost control, pulling enough extra syllables from a few words to transform them into low moans.</p>
<p>“…sha-ame. …Werewolves have been-<em>fuck</em>”</p>
<p>He couldn’t stop the curse falling from his mouth as Remus ran his tongue over the head of Sirius’s cock. <em>Fuck that was good</em>.</p>
<p>The minute Sirius cursed Remus pulled back, heart racing as he surveyed the effect he was having on the trembling man before him.</p>
<p>Sirius gripped the book tightly, “<em>shunted</em> between the-”</p>
<p>Remus’s lips wrapped around his cock once again and Sirius hissed with pleasure, but this time he determinedly continued to stumble through the paragraph.</p>
<p>“…<em>Beast</em> and-<em>fuck-</em>Being divisions of the- the Department for the-<em>uhhhh</em>- Regula-tion and Cont<em>rol</em> of Magi- …magical Creatures for years, because-” </p>
<p>Sirius’s reading had become punctuated with deep moans and curses as Remus slowly took his cock deeper into his mouth. When he reached the base Sirius’s hand flew to the arm of the sofa, gripping it almost tightly enough to rip the fabric. </p>
<p>“Nobody could - <em>fuck</em>, Remus<em> </em>- make up their minds whether a…”</p>
<p>He’d never felt Remus take his entire cock in his mouth like that. It was making his whole body shake as he tried to pull air through his lungs.</p>
<p>“n’bodycould …makeuptheirminds …whether-a-werewolf… sh’be class-classified… as human or… beastial.”</p>
<p>Suddenly Remus stopped, and Sirius’s blood ran cold as his mind cleared. </p>
<p><em>Nobody could make up their minds whether a werewolf should be classified as human or bestial.</em> Shit, did he really just read that out loud to Remus?</p>
<p>The book fell from his hands and Sirius slid to his knees in front of Rem.</p>
<p>“M’sorry Rem, m’so sorry.” </p>
<p>Sirius pressed his hand into the back of Remus’s neck, panting, his whole body bowing against the man in front of him. Forehead resting against his, he captured Remus’s lips in a quick, desperate kiss. </p>
<p>“I’m a wreck.” Sirius shuttered, finally pulling back to meet Remus’s golden eyes.</p>
<p>To his surprise, there was a smile there. “Merlin, you are.”</p>
<p>Sirius blinked. “The book…”</p>
<p>Remus smirked. “You think I haven’t read all that before?” </p>
<p>Sirius let out a long breath. “I’m still sorry. S’not right.” </p>
<p>Remus shook his head. “I’m not sorry.” He arched an eyebrow, a grin spreading across his face. </p>
<p>“See, it looks like I’ve won our little bet.”</p>
