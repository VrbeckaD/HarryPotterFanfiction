    <p>Miranda and five other students sat in the almost empty dining hall mouths agape. <em>A Triwizarding what? </em>On the tip of all their tongues.</p>
<p>               Moll, the matron of Tilson, School of Deep Magic in the western north of Canada, was bouncing on her heels, a gleam in her eyes. The excitement was expected, the announcement was not.</p>
<p>               “ We have been asked to participate in the Triwizarding Tournament of Europe. With two other schools.” She repeated, looking mischievous, “ It is a wonderful opportunity for us to escape this barren north and meet the witches and wizards of the world.”</p>
<p>               “ And what the hell does this entail? Don’t we get like, a say in this before you ship us off?” Chel was standing up from her bench, face twisted in frustration at not understanding. Chel was a sixth year student at Tilson, tall, brash, very firey temper.</p>
<p>               “ No need to yell,” Moll said, amused, “ It’s a very old tournament, and one of their original schools dropped out, so they’ve asked up to replace them.” Moll paused thoughtfully, “ and I’m not shipping you off! I’ll be joining, wouldn’t turn this up for the world.” And she rubbed her hands together, grinning.</p>
<p>               The six young students stared at her, flummoxed. It was after dinner on their first day back to school after the summer and they’d gathered at the front of the dining all, other students dismissed. The fire was flickering dimly, casting long shadows across the plain room.</p>
<p>Miranda, one of the youngest amongst them, now thought she had been summoned to this meeting by mistake. When Moll had given her a squeeze on the shoulder and bent to her ear during dinner, asking her to stay behind afterwards, she could only imagine it was about how poorly her grades were last year. How she’d have to take repeat classes with the fourth years and she’d casually shrugged to her friends, who all knew she wasn’t academically inclined and exerted no effort to be so. Or it could be to lecture her on last year’s brush up with trouble she’d had… She’d thought those were over, but then again, Moll hadn’t been directly involved. Maybe she wanted a turn making her feel useless…</p>
<p>               Moll announcing some outlandish stunt like this was not out of character, but as she explained in more depth what would be expected of them, how long they’d be gone, just the mention of the word “champion”, Miranda felt more and more at odds with her presence. Chel, Nora, Liam and Onyx were all upper years, accomplished in many areas, well on their way to success. And Rina, the only other fifth year, was a firecracker of likeability and ambition. Had Moll invited Miranda as a joke? To balance out the talent of the other five with a dud like her? Or was it just a mistake? Had she meant to place her hand on Jules’, sitting on her left at dinner, shoulder? Jules was a good student and even better flyer, she could be a champion.</p>
<p>               So when Moll dismissed them back to their dorms after explaining in more, but still quite unsatisfying detail, Miranda lingered.</p>
<p>               “ Yes, Miranda?” Moll’s personality took up entire rooms, in an exuberant, encouraging way, but Miranda seemed to tower over her physically. It made her feel lanky and gawky. What do I do with my limbs, she wondered.</p>
<p>               “ Um… I just… wanted to check you didn’t ask me here by mistake.”</p>
<p>               “ A mistake? Oh, I make plenty of mistakes. I make six or twelve a day, a minute, but let me assure you this was consciously done. We won’t know if it’s a mistake until after, won’t we? Well, unless you stay behind. Which you could, of course. But then we’d never know…”</p>
<p>               Miranda stared at her with her mouth open. Suddenly aware of the fire dying down she felt sleepy and rubbed her eye. “ I don’t… I don’t believe in champions.”</p>
<p>               Moll gleamed, the low light flitting in her eye, she placed a hand on Miranda’s shoulder, “ an excellent response.” And then she was halfway across the room and almost out the door, turning around just to say, “put the fire out, won’t you? And dream well tonight.” She winked and was gone.</p>
<p>               Miranda stood in the low flickering light for some time before she put it out. What she thought was going to be another year of bad dreams keeping her up all night in the greenhouse and asleep in her classes might possibly turn into her…. trying to fight for her school’s honour? Halfway across the world? She yawned. Seemed like a bother, maybe she’d skip out.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>How Tilson actually got involved in the Triwizarding Tournament was a little more complicated, a little more mischievous, than Moll let on. She’d been travelling through Europe that summer, collecting various plant specimens and meeting certain powerful people to learn from. She always liked to return to the new school year with a new set of knowledge to share with her students. However, Europe never failed to amuse her more than teach her. Yes, the teachings were old, and yes, the people there knew what they were doing, but what they were doing? It was so very different than what they did at Tilson.</p>
<p>Tilson focuses on old magic, deep magic. The students learn to wield magic without spells, to manipulate the energy of the world in an intuitive way. It doesn’t always work, of course, not everyone has access to that kind of ability, but when it did work… When it did work it was something beyond the comprehension of all those posh aristocrats across the pond.</p>
<p>So when Moll came across an uptight Bartemius Crouch at a wizarding convention in Glasgow, it was only natural for her to have a little fun toying with his sensibilities. At first, he thought she was a delusional old witch, but a few tricks of her hand, and supplied with some very fine firewhiskey, he began to see the beauty of her magic. He also began to talk.</p>
<p>Top secret information was that they were going to be hosting the infamous Triwizarding Tournament at Hogwarts this year. Oh, and wasn’t that about magical cooperation? Isn’t that about connecting with students from other countries and schools? Yes, Barty had said, yes it was. Funny, then, said Moll at the time, that I happen to be a Matron of one such school just across the ocean and a rather large expanse of land. Barty, now thoroughly intoxicated by the very fine whiskey and mysterious allure that was Moll, laughed. Oh, wouldn’t that be something? But no, it’s not meant to be. It’s always the same schools, Beauxbatons and Durmstrang. But then again… Karkaroff was playing coy. Barty admitted that he figured it was because he simply wanted to be difficult with the UK Ministry, but what if he did outright refuse? You couldn’t have a Triwizarding Tournament with only <em>two </em>schools.</p>
<p>This is where Moll got her way in. Well, of course you can’t, dear Barty, so invite us! Invite Tilson, have your three schools! We’d be happy to join.</p>
<p>               Drunk Barty beamed. His anxiety about the tournament being quelled by this mysterious old witch with a peculiar breed of magic.</p>
<p>               But hung over Barty didn’t quite feel the same. He felt embarrassed and tried to repress the entire evening from his memory. He never lost control. He never spilled secrets, he never got <em>drunk. </em>He hoped dearly that Moll would forget, because he knew, most certainly, that Karkaroff would give in. And they couldn’t have <em>four </em>Triwizarding champions, that plainly went against the name.</p>
<p>               But Moll didn’t forget. She owled him and owled him. He ignored her at first. But then she came in person one day and very loudly informed a shocked Percy Weasley, or Weatherby, of the plan. And rumours began circulating before she’d even gained entry to Barty’s office.</p>
<p>               Moll was also mischievous enough to go behind Barty’s back. She owled Dumbledore, she owled Madame Maxime. <em>They </em>were on board, Barty, why shouldn’t you be?</p>
<p>               After a long, very stressful and very painful few weeks for Barty, he finally conceded. Fudge himself had simply shrugged his shoulders, why not? He had said. The more the merrier, much to Crouch’s horror.</p>
<p>               So Tilson would be the fourth school.</p>
<p>               Tilson was a very small school, with only about twenty students per year. So Moll knew them all well, and she knew exactly who she would bring with her. They were allowed twelve, but she figured only six were needed from her. So she chose students that would each make a distinctly different kind of champion.</p>
<p>               Chel, vicious, feisty, cunning.</p>
<p>               Liam, kind, courageous.</p>
<p>               Onyx, dark, mysterious.</p>
<p>               Rina, bold, firey.</p>
<p>               Nora, contemplative, calculated.</p>
<p>               And finally, Miranda. Who couldn’t see a damn reason why the hell she was chosen. She could see it in the others. She knew her magic was a strange kind, but she continuously flunked charms, she barely skirted by transfiguration, and she flew a broom like she was driving a garbage truck. The others were proficient in, well, <em>everything </em>it seemed to her.</p>
<p>               But Moll was an enigma. Her motives almost never clear until after the fact. Tilson bloomed with talent and complex magics under her touch and who was Miranda to disagree with the eccentric but wise? She wasn’t sure.</p>
<p>She wasn’t sure.</p>
