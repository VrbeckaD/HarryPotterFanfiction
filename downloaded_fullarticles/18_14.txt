    <p>
  <span>It had seemed so clever a week ago. Dumbledore had advised against it, but Sirius had persuaded them all to see it his way. No one, looking at James’ three oldest friends, would choose Peter for, well, anything. The man was weak, cowardly, utterly forgettable. And not responding to any messages. Sirius paced in his house, back and forth across the living room. Something was wrong. The prickling tension along the back of his neck wouldn’t go away. There was nothing to distract him; the radio had been ominously quiet all day. Somehow, no news didn’t feel like good news.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Outside, muggle children laughed and ran, swinging their festive bags of candy. He opened the door to leave a bowl of treats on the step after the fifth time the doorbell interrupted his pacing, and saw his grey motorcycle waiting by the curb. Maybe a ride would calm him down, leave these worries behind him. He reached back inside for his helmet and jacket, where he had thrown them on the floor after the last ride. The key in his hand felt right. He would just go out for a quick ride, shake off the rust. And if he happened to check in on Peter along the way, it wasn’t because he was doubting himself. Just saying hello to an old friend. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The bike roared to life. He revved the engine a few times, getting whoops and stares from passing children, and annoyed looks from their parents. The grey Triumph darted out into the empty street, on the quickest route to Peter’s hiding place. </span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
  <span>The house was dark and quiet when he pulled up. Sirius checked his watch, leaning the bike onto its stand. It wasn’t that late yet, even for a homebody like Peter. It was, however, much too late for visitors, the cranky elderly witch at the door told him in no uncertain terms. She tried to close the door, but he put his foot in the way.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’m looking for my friend, Peter,” he told her, smiling as charmingly as he could manage. The creeping feeling in his hackles hadn’t been eased by the ride. Every block he rode to get here felt like miles, and there was no way he would let this woman stop him. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The witch sniffed, pulling her well-worn bathrobe tighter over her chest and crossing her arms. “Peter’s a good boy. You don’t look like the sort he’d be friends with.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius nearly laughed. Some people were so prejudiced. “Is he home?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“No, and I’ll thank you to get off my porch,” she replied. “It’s not safe to stand around in the dark these days.” Sirius withdrew his foot, which had started to ache despite the boots he wore. The door slammed shut in his face, but not before the witch cast one last disapproving look at him and his bike. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>There was no reason for Peter to have left the house, tonight of all nights. The dark wizards would be out in force, looking for mayhem. Looking for the Order, for Lily and James and baby Harry. The house was safe and quiet, and Peter was of absolutely no consequence to anyone. The only way he could be involved in anything dangerous would be if…</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius froze halfway down the steps. It was unthinkable. He flung himself back onto the bike and fumbled the key into the ignition. With a twist of the throttle, he sped out into the road, narrowly missing a group of teenage muggles. They flipped him off, calling after him. The wind cut through his thin sweater and he realized he’d left his helmet and jacket on the cranky witch’s steps. It didn’t matter. Once he got to Godric’s Hollow and saw nothing, he could go back and get them. He flipped a switch and the motorcycle rose into the air. Skimming the treetops, the bike ate through the miles. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>There was a flickering orange glow through the forest as he approached the tiny town. Smoke had been drifting through the sky in sheets for several minutes. Just a bonfire, he thought to himself. Nothing to worry about. He tipped his head up to peek at the sky: through the smoke, he could see the stars clearly, but nothing else. No dark mark shone green above the town. Maybe he was wrong, and had raced over here for no reason. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The bike skidded to a stop in front of the house that he shouldn’t have been able to see. Small fires burned in the grass in front of the house, which had been torn apart. Plaster and beams were strewn about, piled with shingles and broken window panes. Sirius managed to get the kickstand down, legs shaking so much he could barely climb off the bike. They were gone, all three of them, and it was all his fault. He put both hands to his head and pulled at his hair, teeth clenched to keep from screaming. A figure emerged from the wrecked building, and for an instant his heart leapt with hope. He hurried forward, realizing as he did that this person was far too large to be James or Lily. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hagrid cradled something gently in one enormous arm, held close against his coat. He was silhouetted by the fire, but even so Sirius could tell the groundskeeper was crying. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Who’s there?” Hagrid asked roughly, catching sight of Sirius on the sidewalk. “There’s been an accident, stay back.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“It’s me, Hagrid. Sirius,” He couldn’t make himself ask the question. “Are they - “</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The child Hagrid carried cried out, brief wails interspersed with coughing from the smoke. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Sirius! Stay back, yeh don’ want to see this.” Hagrid said more gently, rocking the baby in the crook of his arm. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“James and Lily?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“They’re gone.” The half-giant sniffled, wiping his nose against his unoccupied sleeve, “I’m taking little Harry to Dumbledore, keep him safe.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“No, give him to me,” Sirius demanded. “I’m his godfather, I’ll keep him safe.” Responsibility had never been his strong suit; Lily had laughed when they assigned him as godfather. It had seemed impossible that he would ever be asked to care for a child, just a formality, with James and Lily young and healthy. But here he was, just a year later. He hadn’t been able to keep his best friend safe, but he’d be damned if he let anything happen to James’ son. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hagrid shook his shaggy head and laid his hand on Sirius’ shoulder. “I’ve got my orders from Dumbledore himself,” he said. “He’s got to be kept safe.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>There was nowhere safer than with Dumbledore. The Dark Lord himself seemed to fear the old man, giving Hogwarts a wide berth. Sirius nodded slowly. The boy would be fine, for now. Peter, on the other hand, still needed to be dealt with. He pulled his wand out. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Take my motorcycle, it’ll be faster,” He told Hagrid. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I can’t take that,” Hagrid protested. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius gestured with his wand, and a matching sidecar appeared on the bike. “Please. I won’t be needing it anymore.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The huge hand on his shoulder squeezed. “I know how much they meant to yeh. I’m sorry.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius patted Hagrid’s arm awkwardly. There was nothing else to say. Hagrid walked to the bike and laid the fussing baby in the sidecar. Sirius found a blanket, thrown into the street from the blast, and tucked it around Harry. When he looked back up, Hagrid had produced a pair of goggles from somewhere, and was buttoning up his coat. He nodded once at Sirius, and kicked the bike to life. They roared away, up into the sky, and Sirius watched them go. The fire around the ruins of the house still crackled. Distantly, he could hear the sirens from muggle fire trucks. It was time to go. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>If I were a traitorous rat, where would I hide? Sirius wondered to himself, and shifted into his dog shape. At once, everything was clearer. His pack had been killed, and the one responsible was still out there. Hunt, find, kill. There was no need to plan beyond that. He shook himself, easing the tension in his shoulders, and put his nose to the ground. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Pettigrew’s scent was sharp with fear. He had been sweating, hurrying along the dark road not too long before. Sirius loped along his trail until it vanished. He growled in frustration. The man had apparated. He could be anywhere. A car came around a curve in the road, headlights blinding him. He snarled at it, and the driver swerved wildly around him. Adrenaline turned his sorrow into anger. He wanted to bite something, to destroy anything in his way. He shook his head to clear it. Think like a rat, he reminded himself, not like a dog. The nearest muggle town was only a few miles ahead. If he knew anything about rats, then Pettigrew would go to ground as soon as he could. More mindful of cars this time, Sirius ran along the edge of the road, headed towards the town. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hours later, with the sun rising, he admitted he was wrong. The town had plenty of natural rodents, but no sign or scent of Pettigrew. Tired and footsore, he curled up on a doorstep. Light rain had started to fall, beading on his fur. He licked it off, thirsty from the run. Think. Where else could Pettigrew have gone? If both sides knew he was the spy, nowhere was safe. The Dark Lord’s followers would think he had betrayed them when they heard the news, and he had never been well-liked in the Order of the Phoenix. That left only one place, but surely he wouldn’t be dumb enough to go back there. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius rose, and stretched, and sighed. Behind a garden shed, he shifted back into a man. Although he tried to steel himself, the grief hit him like a sucker punch. He leaned one arm against the shed for a moment to steady himself. A security light blinked on in the back of the house, spotlighting him. He cursed under his breath, nosy suspicious muggles, and disapparated. </span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
  <span>His jacket and helmet were, unsurprisingly, not laying on the steps where he had dropped them. Inside the house, he could smell breakfast frying. His stomach rumbled in answer and he wondered how he could possibly be hungry. It felt like a betrayal, to want to eat when they were dead. A woman jogging by gave him a suspicious look and a wide berth. He looked his reflection over in the window of a parked car. Rumpled sweater, damp from rain and sweat. Pale, drawn face surrounded by tangled curls he normally kept artfully mussed. At best, he looked hungover. At worst, a little mad. He ducked behind the car and became a dog again.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The black dog didn’t care about his appearance. He didn’t care about passing joggers, or the elderly witch cooking, or the endless drip of the rain. He could smell that his prey was inside that house, and so he waited. The hedge beside the porch provided some cover. His black fur faded into the shadows, and he dozed with one eye open. The morning passed, and the rain stopped. He waited. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>When the door finally opened, it was all he could do not to spring up and attack. Pettigrew poked his head out, looking both ways nervously. He patted his pocket, feeling for the reassurance of his wand. Sirius watched with a vicious predatory grin. His prey hurried down the stairs and out along the sidewalk. Wait, Sirius reminded himself. He won’t get away with this. When the smaller man’s footsteps faded around the block, Sirius slunk out of the bushes and followed. He trotted along in plain view, tongue lolling, following Pettigrew’s scent. The roads and sidewalks got busier, and he sped up. Ducking into an alley, he returned to human shape. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Peter!” He called, and the little man flinched. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Sirius,” Pettigrew muttered, eyes darting around the crowded sidewalk, searching for an escape. Then, louder, “Lily and James, Sirius! How could you!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The accusation caught him enough by surprise that Sirius stopped walking. And then the street exploded. He was flung backward from the spot where Pettigrew had stood an instant before, landing on his back with the wind knocked out of him. He gasped and coughed in the dust and smoke from the explosion. Around him, muggles were screaming and running away, or rushing to the wounded scattered around the crater in the street. Sirius struggled to his feet and walked to the crater’s edge. A muggle woman wept beside him, shaking a man who had lost an arm, begging him to stay with her. Steam billowed from the hole, and he could hear trickling water under the falling debris. Pettigrew’s clothes were crumpled on the edge, flecked with blood. Sirius kicked them, searching, but the man had vanished. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Grief and horror welled up in him and he dropped to his knees at the edge of the crater. He couldn’t even get this one thing done. His family had been right about him all along: he was worthless. Literally outsmarted by a rat. Kneeling there in the dust, with the muggles crying around him, he started to laugh, And even when twenty members of the Magical Law Enforcement Patrol apparated around him, wands drawn, he couldn’t stop laughing. </span>
