"He said it was just puppy love."</p><p>Crabbe grunted. "He has always been far too busy pining over Harry Merlin damn Potter to even notice us these days."</p><p>Goyle smirked. "You think he has a crush on Harry Potter?"</p><p>Crabbe said, "Duh, he talks about him all the time."</p><p>Goyle asked, "As in the same Harry Potter who has a thing for Cho Chang?"</p><p>Crabbe replied, "That's just a fling."</p><p>Goyle muttered, "Enough about Potter, Draco doesn't approve of us dating."</p><p>Crabbe exclaimed, "Who cares if Draco approves?"</p><p>Goyle sighed. "I don't, but it would be nice to have him on our side again."</p><p>Crabbe grinned. "I love you and you love me, if Draco freaking Malfoy can't see that; then he's dumber than the two of us put together!"</p><p>Goyle smiled. "Yeah, he is."</p></div>
