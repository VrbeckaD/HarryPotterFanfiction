    <p>A feeling of sadness had settled over the Hogwarts grounds. More accurately, the people on the grounds. The children had been sent home due to the terrorization of Voldemort and his Death Eaters, and most of the Professors had left the school in favor of being with their loved ones. A select few, however, had decided to stay. For the school had become a home to them. One of those few was one, Minerva McGonagall.</p><p>Minerva had no family to speak of and no home of her own. After the deaths of her parents, Minerva had left the family home to her brother Malcolm, who had tragically died in an explosion of the house by dark wizards. After that, she moved to Hogwarts. Here she was now, alone, save, Filtch, Hagrid and Albus.</p><p>Minerva lamented over this as she walked briskly down the corridors of the deserted school. Having received an Owl from Fillius about the deaths of two of her former students: Lily Evens-Potter and James Potter, she was on her way to investigate. Apparently, the Potters son Harry had survived. Minerva wouldn't, no, couldn't believe this until she saw the child with her own eyes. Which was why she was on her way to find someone who would know for certain where the boy was.</p><p>Her relationship with Albus Dumbledore was one of great speculation. Some thought they were secretly married while others thought they were out to conquer the wizard world. A more tame theory was that they were long-time friends with, as the children say, ' benefits'. Then there were those who thought nothing of the relationship between the Headmaster and his Deputy Headmistress. Some of the rumors held truth, while some where very incorrect. Anyway, no matter what anyone said, Minerva knew that Albus would know if what people were saying was true. But, before she reached the gargoyle statue, she was stopped by a booming voice;</p><p>"Aye there Professor," sniffed Hagrid, blowing into a rather large handkerchief. So, he'd heard the news then, thought Minerva, feeling a twinge of sympathy. Stepping up to the half giant, she patted his arm gently.</p><p>"Hello, Hagrid," she spoke softly as though speaking to a small child. Ironic since Hagrid was bigger tha most grown wizards and most large animals. He looked down at her with watery eyes full of deep sadness.</p><p>"Did ya 'ere 'bout what happened? The Potters-Lily 'n James-got killed by He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. But lil' 'arry managed ta kill him 'for he got ta him. 'Magine that Professor! A wee babe took on the Dark Lord 'n is still 'ere ta tell the tale." The large man shook his head in confused wonder. Minerva stayed silent, letting the information sink in. If she was right-she usually was-then she could assume that Hagrid had gotten his news from Albus. Considering he was headed away from the Headmaster's office with his snot-drenched tablecloth-handkerchief.</p><p>"Hagrid," she said, stepping away,"did you here this from Professor Dumbledore?" Hagrid nodded and blew his nose once more. Minerva wrinkled her own nose and turned to walk to Albus' office. "Goodbye, Hagrid, I'l be seeing you soon, I presume," was her curt farewell.</p><p>"If yer goin' ta see Professor Dumbledore, he left." Minerva came to an abrupt stop. Left? Where had he gone? Facing Hagrid once more, she opened her mouth; "he went ta see baby 'arry. Says he's gonna take the lad ta his Aunt's house. Says it's the safest place fer him 'till he can come ta Hogwarts." She barely heard Hagrid's words. Anger rushed through her. How dare he! How dare he take that boy and leave him in the care of Petunia Dursley-formerly-Evens? The old coot knew the woman's thoughts of magic and the way she had treated Lily when she found out her sister had magic. Lord knew what she would do to poor Harry if Albus left him with her. If. If she didn't stop him first. Who was she kidding, she would stop him before he did something like that.</p><p>Switching direction, Minerva ran toward the entrance hall. For she was now a woman who had a mission. Stop Albus Dumbledore from doing something ridiculously stupid. It happened quite often, but this was different. This wasn't telling him that he couldn't eat sherbet lemons in place of vegetables or reminding him that dressing gowns were not, under any circumstances, to be worn at breakfast. This was a matter much more important. This was much bigger. As she ran, those thoughts were her fuel. And little did she know that those thoughts might just change the life of a certain black haired little boy.</p><p>Privet Drive was quiet when the small, grey, tabby speared on it's corner. It looked up at the sign, baring it's teeth in a sort of triumphant grin. If cate could grin, that is. Then, a car slowly rolled by. The cat looked at the portly man seated within it and then back up at the sign. The man drove off quickly, seeing the cat do something so human had confused his Muggle brain.</p><p>After another few minutes, the cat situated itself on the wall of number 4 Privet Drive. The cat's posture was stiff and so uncat-like that those who passed the house gave a second glance. The cat would glare and the passerby would scurry on as though they'd been scolded by a teacher. Who knew that a look from a cat could do such a thing.</p><p>Hours passed and the cat did not move one bit.</p><p>When Albus showed up at last, Minerva searched him with her piercing cat-eyes gaze. Where was the child? Albus sat beside her and offered a piece of whatever candy he was infatuated with at the moment, transforming back into her human form and declined with a frown as well as a deep sigh. The man was such a bloody tool, he knew why she was here so why in Merlin's name was he playing games?</p><p>"Are the rumors true, Albus?" Minerva finally asked, shooting a slight glare at the bearded man beside her. It appeared that she'd have to be direct with her questions.</p><p>"I'm afraid so, Minerva," he sounded so defeated. Minerva tried to remember the last time she had heard Albus be anything but chipper. Nothing came to mind and that sent a shiver down her spine. Yet, she still had hope.</p><p>"And what of the child?" Her inquiry was spoken more sharply than intended, but Albus got the point.</p><p>"Hagrid is bringing him." Minerva's eyes grew large, Hagrid? As much as she loved-yes loved-the friendly half-giant, she couldn't understand why Albus would trust him with something so important. She asked him as much and his reply saved no room for contradictions.</p><p>"I would trust Hagrid with my life," his eyes caught hers for a moment. Regret was reflected in their sapphire depths. She had once held that special place; she had once been the person Albus trustedabove all others. That time was long past and Minerva pushed away the myriad of emotions that flooded through her. She'd deal with that later. Later, when she knew that Harry Potter was safe.</p><p>The sound of rumbling made her turn her eyes to the sky. Not thunder, she concluded. Then she saw it: a flying motorbike. The man astride it was so large and at once, Minerva knew that it must be Hagrid. She and Albus stood up and went to greet Hagrid as he touched down outside 4 Privet Drive.</p><p>"Hello, Professor McGonagall, Professor Dumbledore, sir." Hagrid addressed both Professors while stepping away from the mottorbike and take a small bundle from somewhere in his large cloak. Harry, Minerva thought gleefully. Hagrid passed the small child to Albus and Minerva had to restrain from taking him from the Headmaster. She wanted to pull him to her chest and shield him from the horrors of their world. She looked over Albus' shoulder, feeling a tear slide down her pale cheek. How could anyone do such a thing to a boy so young? Kill his parents and leave him all alone. Her eyes found the lightning bolt scar.</p><p>"Are you sure you want to do this, Albus?" Hoping against all hope that for once Albus would heed the warning she was about to share. Kind as he was, Albus did not take advice. "He will be a celebrity in our world, any family would be honored to take him in." Reasoning was leaving her, but she knew she had to try.</p><p>"He needs to grow up away from all of that." With a shake of the head, he walked to the door with baby Harry in his arms.</p><p>"Albus! These are the worst sort of Muggles imaginable! I've watched them all day!" Minerva took a breath to calm herself, "from what Lily has told me, her sister hated magic. She was jealous that she was not like her sister so instead, she resented her. She treated Lily terribly, Albus. We can only imagine what she will do to little Harry." She implored him to reconsider his decision. She knew that leaving this child with his relatives would bring nothing but hardship for the boy.</p><p>"She was only. Child then, Minerva. Surly she has matured." He tried to placate her, how dare he!</p><p>"I've watched them all day," she tried again. "I've seen Petunia with that screaming son of hers and that Vernon is just plain mean." Albus has to understand, "they do be nothing but horrid to Harry because he is different."</p><p>"I am sorry, but this is how it has to be," Albus didn't look at her as he placed Harry on the doorstep. Minerva went cold, he was going to do it. No matter what she did, Albus would not listen. She could beg or barter 'till she was blue in the face, Albus would turn his cool eyes away and pretend she hadn't spoken at all. Hatred for the man she had, at one time, revered above all others, buried deep inside Minerva.</p><p>Turning away, Minerva transformed back into her animagus form. She could not stand to look at him any longer. When she got far enough away, she turned back in time to see Albus place a piece of parchment into Harry's blankets. If cats could scoff, Minerva would have. He thought a letter could explain this? Stupid, stupid man.</p><p>"Good luck, Harry Potter." The words were carried to her on the wind. She shook her little cat head. Harry Potter would not need luck. He had something much better on his side. He had Minerva McGonagall.</p><p>(Should I continue?)</p>
