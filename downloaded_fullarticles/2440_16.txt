    <p>Part I</p><p>Your last ride on the Hogwarts Express is a quiet one. Rowan and Ben are sitting in front of you. Rowan’s eyes deeply immersed on a book while Ben kept his eyes intent on the side window. You can understand them. You feel particularly nervous yourself. You are full -fledged witches and wizards now, we now have another role in society that is not a student. Ben had accepted an internship in the Committee on Experimental Charms under Gilbert Wimple. Giving his outstanding proficiency on charms it was really no surprise.  Rowan, on the other hand, plans on moving back to the farm to help their family. They had become rather quiet and started reading Hogwarts a History for the 11th time once you brought up the possibility of them applying for assistant professor. You figured it was a rather sensitive subject and pushed it aside. Rowan would be a brilliant professor. Professor Binns could use an assistant for example.</p><p>You all have come a long way. From your first year in Hogwarts as eleven year olds, to curse breakers, to almost getting expelled to now ex-Hogwarts alumni. The road had not been an easy one but your friends and everyone who helped you along the way made it worth it. Your brother was safe now and the curse on all the vaults have been broken. The future could not look more promising than now.</p><p>The sound of the whistle woke all of you out of your reverie at once. Rowan had been reading the same pace for the last 10 minutes. You are the first one to stand up.</p><p>“Well friends, it seems this is our last train ride home,” you do not want to cry but there is a definite sadness in your voice you can’t quite drown out.</p><p>“I feel really scared, fellas.” He admits quietly.</p><p>Rowan and you exchange glances before all of you break into a loud fit of laughter. Some things never change.</p><p>“You’ll be fine Ben, you are an adult now,” You put your arm around his shoulder to show him comfort. Deep down you felt scared as well. You’ve been repeating those same words to yourself a lot lately.</p><p>“I don’t feel like an adult,” he answers flatly.</p><p>“Don’t’ worry Ben, we all feel that way,” of course, Rowan finds the best words of comfort. You feel Ben relax against you and let him go. You had a huge trunk to take care of. From the corner of your eye, you watch Rowan give Ben’s arm a reassuring squeeze and a warm smile.</p><p>There have been times you have wondered if there was something up between those two.</p><p>“We better hurry, or we’ll miss Bill. He said he’d be waiting for his siblings close to the exit of Platform 9¾,” Rowan said excitedly as they made their way through the door, trunk behind them.</p><p>Or not.</p><p>“How do they know that?” Ben questions you, perhaps sourly, beside you.</p><p>“Rowan writes to Bill all the time, they claim to be pen pals. Bill’s apprenticeship in Gringotts is really interesting, apparently,” you shrug before following behind Rowan towards the train’s main corridor.</p><p>You make it to the exit among the sea of Hogwarts students and rapidly find a very familiar mane of long ginger hair. You only knew of one family with such peculiar shade of red.  </p><p>“Bill!” you shout to the top of your lungs. Last you had seen him had been at the start of your seventh year when he came to drop Charlie and Percy to the platform. To be honest, you also corresponded with Bill but you had wanted to mortify Ben a little.</p><p>“Hey!” he waves as you run in his direction. Rowan had a blinding smile beside him.</p><p>He wraps you in a bear crushing hug. Bill had always been affectionate with you. You were also very happy to see him. Like the rest of your friends, you are not very sure when you would see them again.</p><p>“Rocking long hair now? Sick!” he had his hair on a short ponytail now. It suited him, you decided. Adulthood suited Bill well, his shoulders looked broader than the last time you had seen him. He could not look more handsome.</p><p>“Thanks!” He lets go of you slowly, his smile is wide and brilliant. “Hey Ben,” he greets behind you. You hear Ben mutter a greeting.</p><p>“Tell them Bill,” Rowan quips beside him as she pokes him in the ribs. I subdue the urge to snicker to save Ben discomfort.</p><p>“Tell us what?” Ben’s voice is loud, very unlike himself. You bit into the inside of your mouth to suppress your giggles. Ben Bloody Copper does have it in him.</p><p>“I’m going to Egypt!” He announces with triumph.</p><p>The announcement takes you by surprise. He had not mentioned any of that on his last letter. Ben looks surprised too beside you, unlike Rowan who you suspect already knew of this major development.</p><p>“Well, I’m very happy for you Bill!” Egypt has the reputation of being one of the most cursed cities in the world. It has plenty of tombs and catacombs ready to be explored, many of which are cursed. All the hard work Bill had put on his internship in Gringotts is finally paying up with a real curse breaker job.</p><p>“Congratulations,” Ben adds and pats Bill on the shoulder. He looks a mixture of happy and relieved. You can only wonder what had come through his mind.</p><p>“We will miss you Bill. Don’t forget to write,” there is a single tear on the corner of Rowan’s eye as they embrace him.</p><p>“Totally missing you, mate,” you join the hug. Ben joins the group hug soon after.</p><p>This isn’t like your parting at Hogwarts when Bill graduated. This is a real farewell. Curse-breaking is a real deal, and in Egypt nonetheless. Bill will certainly have less free time in the future. He might have to work undercover, and study a lot of new information. Nevertheless, you more than anyone could understand Bill.</p><p>“You’ll be the most amazing cure-breaker, Bill. I have no doubt,” the hug breaks. You can sense Rowan bite down their tears beside you.</p><p>“Just as good as you, mate. Are you sure you don’t want to apply to Gringotts? I could arrange a word or two for you,” he offers kindly with a smile. You are sure Bill means well but you had considered it before and concluded all of you had different paths ahead of you.</p><p>“It’s okay Bill, I’ll tell you if I change my mind,” you promise. Although you find that very unlikely. You had never been fond of goblins.</p><p>“Anyway, has any of you seen Penny? I have to say goodbye of everyone before I take my brothers home.”</p><p>Penny.</p><p>You had pushed her on the back of your mind earlier in the ride. She had decided to remain on her Head Girl compartment and you hadn’t seen her since. ‘I have to prepare.’ She had said. You figured she just wanted to say goodbye at everyone at Hogwarts, being so popular had its downfalls.</p><p>“She was behind me when we got down from the Hogwarts Express,” Ben said after a brief pause. Rowan and you shrug.</p><p>“I’ll go ask Charlie if he has seen her, see you guys,” he waves goodbye before fading away among the running students.</p><p>Of course he’ll ask Charlie, he liked Penny a little too much for your own liking.</p><p>“Aren’t you going to look for Penny, as well?” Rowan asks you quietly, her eyes were slightly watery but otherwise looked composed. Ben’s hand was on their shoulder reassuringly.</p><p>You don’t get to answer when you hear a very familiar and annoying voice shout your name.</p><p>“Well, well, well, what do we have here? None other than my least favorite cursed child of Hogwarts!” Except that you were not children anymore and you knew this time that Merula Snyde’s remark was meant more in a sarcastic tone than ill intentions.</p><p>You and Merula have come a long way. From sworn enemies, to begrudging partner in crime, to much to your surprise, friends.</p><p>“Hey there yourself, Merula.” You smirk at her. That’s just the way your friendship is.</p><p>“So you really are leaving with Rapepick after all, aren’t you?” It takes you by surprise that she brings it up. You hadn’t told her, only your knit of friends: Bill, Ben, Rowan and Penny.</p><p>Penny.</p><p>You couldn’t hold it against her. It is, after all, a very Penny thing to do. First of all, Merula is your friend after all. Second of all, it is not a secret of yours.</p><p>“Well you know me, I don’t find trouble, trouble seems to find me. Adventures never seem to end, my dear friend.”</p><p>After your curse-breaking odyssey, you had a lot time to think. It isn’t only adventure you are after. There are many stories behind the curses. Ghosts that might not rest in peace, families that wonder what happened to their relatives, other Jacobs getting in real trouble. You just wanted to make a little change in this world of curses. Prevent other people from ending like your brother. Prevent the suffering of other families. It is simple. Curse breaking is something you just happened to be good at.</p><p>“Just don’t get yourself killed, okay?” If you hadn’t known Merula for so long you would’ve mistaken her words for worry, “It would be such a waste of time to do all paperwork considering the length of your record.”</p><p>She spoke with contempt, but you knew her, deep down Merula Snyde actually cared about you.</p><p>“So you really are taking that job in the Ministry, eh?” you nudge her in the ribs with your elbow. She pushes you away lightheartedly with her hands.</p><p>“I don’t want to follow my parent’s footsteps, so yes. Who knows, I might rank up and be an Auror one of these days.” She puffs her chest at this proudly. Merula Snyde might not always be kind but you had no doubt a powerful witch to be reckoned.</p><p>“Good luck, friend.” You hesitate for a split second but you say it trying not to find yourself embarrassed. Had you told your eleven-year-old self you’d end up considering Merula Snyde one of your dearest friends, they would’ve flipendo’ed your ass away.  </p><p>You extend your hand to Merula only to be met with a hug, a very brief, warm and awkward hug. Merula is not the hugging type.</p><p>“Take care, friend.” She moves away from you rapidly, eyes darting both ways, wary of prying eyes. Merula Snyde DID NOT hug people.</p><p>“You better come back with a list of broken curses under your belt the next time we see each other. Don’t make me think you need my help to do it.” She gives you a light punch in the shoulder.</p><p>She smirks at you. You smirk at her.</p><p>“Bet on it.”</p><p> </p><p>With that Merula Snyde turns her back to you and walks away. There is a tense feeling in your stomach. You had the suspicion you would not see Merula again in a long time. You follow her small frame among the crowd as far as you can until you see her figure disappear into a wall. She does not look back once.</p><p>-----</p><p>“Where is everyone?” You jump startled in your place. You could recognize that voice anywhere.</p><p>“Oh hey, Penny! There you are!” you exclaim lamely. You look behind you, no one is to be seen. Ben and Rowan who were beside the column just a moment ago had left. Less people were skirmishing now. Most of the younger student were leaving already. The only people left in the vicinity were you, Penny, and a couple of other 7th and 6th year Hufflepuff that were crying and hugging a couple of meters from you. You could recognize Tonks bright pink hair among them.</p><p>Penny raises a finely groomed eyebrow at you. She had her trunk with her. Her eyes were bloodshot, you could tell that you had giving her a good look.</p><p>“Did Bill find you?” you mumble like an idiot. You don’t know why you are treating her this way when she is the same Penny that’s been with you for all 7 years of Hogwarts but you feel suddenly very nervous.</p><p>What could have Bill said that made her cry? Did she like Bill that much? That didn’t sit well with you, but you were such a coward you would never tell her that. When it came to Penny, you were just a bloody coward.</p><p>“Oh Bill? Yeah. He is going to Egypt, brilliant.” She smiles at you that dazzling smile that can’t quite reach her eye that usually tricks everyone else. But not you, it never goes past you.</p><p>“Penny are you alri—“</p><p>“There you are!” It’s Rowan this time, Ben on her heels.                                    </p><p>“I’m right here were you left me Rowan…Ben,” you give them both dirty looks. You were just about to ask Penny about her feelings but with them now you knew it would be virtually impossible for her to let her guard down.</p><p>You relax instantly. It is likely the last time in a long time you will be able to bicker with your friends like this. Rowan will go back to her farm. Ben will be a ministry worker. And Penny….And Penny?</p><p>“We are sorry, we didn’t want to intrude between you and Merula,” Ben teases you at which you scowl sarcastically.</p><p>“Very funny Ben, very funny. Hilarious.”</p><p>“We saw you hug, don’t deny it now,” Rowan pokes fun at you and stifles a laugh. Ben makes a kissy noise beside her. You hide your face behind your hands in embarrassment. You do not want Penny of all people to know that.</p><p>“Sod off,” you push Ben in order to make him shut up. All four of you share a laugh.</p><p>“Who would’ve thought? Our Hero of Hogwarts melted the ice queen’s heart!” Penny remarks with a sunny smile. At least she looked happier now, at your expense.</p><p>“You too Penny? Three against one? That’s pretty unfair don’t you think?” you plea for mercy.</p><p>“Please, nothing Our Hero of Hogwarts can’t beat.” She smiles at you warmly. She always calls you a hero so sincerely you are never sure whether she is making fun at you or not.</p><p>“I guess,” You don’t know what to say. She disarms you so easily with her smile. You kind of hope the hotness of your cheeks is not noticeable. The happiness quickly tumbles to the ground just as fast; however, this thing that you are feeling better pass soon. You don’t know when you’ll be seeing Penny again. Just the thought of it was dreadful on itself.</p><p>There is a slight pause as you and Penny exchange glances, as to which Rowan coughs.</p><p>“I guess this is it, isn’t it?” Her voice carries a hint of melancholy, forlorn, far away. A knot forms in the back of your throat. This is goodbye.</p><p>“We can still owl each other, right?” you are sure Ben had meant to reassure all of you but it came more like a question. And you wonder. You really hope you can owl all of them as often as you will promise you will.</p><p>“Always, we’ll keep in touch.” You’ve heard countless of stories of Hogwarts alumni not seeing each other ever again. Deep in your heart, you are scared, but, the bond with your friends is strong. The kind of bond that forms when you go through death defying adventures together. You’ll keep in touch, you are sure.</p><p>“Penny, have you already said goodbye to your family?” Rowans asks. Penny only nods. Her eyes looked as normal as ever, she had probably use a charm to fix them when no one was looking, you guess.</p><p>But, goodbye? I look at Penny confused. Why did Penny say goodbye at her family? I look at Rowan and Ben to see no reaction in them. Did they know something I didn’t….?</p><p>“What? I don’t understand…,” you say dumbly. Rowan raises her eyebrows at Penny’s direction in surprise. Ben face palms beside her with a laugh. You open and close your mouth like a Plimpy out of water.</p><p>Penny giggles beside you, “I might have forgotten to tell you something.” There’s a twinkle in her eye that you recognize. The kind of twinkle that meant she had in fact not forgotten to tell me something but decided to avoid sharing a piece of information for her own mirth and enjoyment.</p><p>Typical Penny.</p><p>“It’s time,” you sense a bony and slender hand on your shoulder. You didn’t expect her so soon.</p><p>The one and only, Patricia Rakepick.</p><p>“Ms. Rakepick.” You turn to her. She looks as elegant and well-kept as always. For a woman her age, with a couple of grey hairs here and there, she is a very attractive woman.</p><p>“Good afternoon, my fellow curse-breakers,” after the incident in Hogwarts she took an inkling to call your group curse breakers.</p><p>“I figure no one else took my offer after all, other than this oddball?” by oddball she meant you. You scowl. Did she just say that she had offered your friends the same internship she offered you? Why hadn’t they said anything?</p><p>Rowan and Ben shrug at you as if reading your mind.</p><p>“I’m sorry Ms. Rakepick, but I’ve done enough curse-breaking to last me a life time,” Rowan says smartly.</p><p>“Same,” Ben adds as he raised his hand lightly.</p><p>You couldn’t help but feel disappointed. Perhaps that’s why they didn’t tell you anything. Perhaps, they knew, rightly so, that you would insist. That you would try to convince them of forming a curse-breaking team and they might’ve accepted against their own wishes. You understand but you feel disappointed nonetheless.</p><p>“I’m coming with.” It is Penny’s voice this time, resolute. So, this is why Penny was crying… she had just said goodbye to her family. You sense guilt form in the bottom of your stomach.</p><p>“Excellent decision, Ms. Haywood.” Patricia Rakepick nods her way and they exchange glances. Something inside you clicks.</p><p>“Excuse me a moment, Patricia.” You forgo manners altogether. Back when you had started to correspond and help each other break the cursed vaults she had suggested you call her by her first name. You grab Penny by the arm and drag her kindly to the side.</p><p>“Penny, you don’t have to this if you don’t want to,” you whisper. Rowan and Ben are giving you interested glances from a couple of meters away but you ignore them.</p><p>Ben and Rowan were not like Penny. Penny is the kind of person to put others before her and really well at hiding her own desires. What if she was only accepting Patricia’s proposal because she thought you’d want her to? You would not be able to live with that.</p><p>“Are you mental? You know my answer better than anyone whenever someone invites me to join them on death-defying adventures.”</p><p>She smiles at you and you smile back. If someone shares your thrill for adventure, it is Penny. She had said something very similar the first time you invited her to vault hunting.</p><p>“Okay,” you grab her hand in the spur of the moment, you don’t know why but by the moment you do it’s kind of too late to go back so you don’t. You walk  back to Patricia Rakepick with a determined look on your face.</p><p>“We are ready,” you say with resolve. You want to feel braver than you actually feel. Penny squeezes your hand and does not let go. You can’t look her in the eye. Your heart is running one thousand km per hour, but it makes you feel better. It sounds very corny but with Penny, it felt like all kinds of things were possible. You wouldn’t even be alive if it wasn’t for her.</p><p>“Perfect. Although you owe your friends a proper goodbye.”</p><p>You look behind you. Rowan and Ben are smirking at you, and you have a vague idea why that is. You let go of Penny’s hand then, trying to act as nonchalant as you could.</p><p>“I’m gonna miss you,” you hug both of them. You let go of Ben first. You exchange glances. He understands Rowan Khanna is your best friend in the world.</p><p>“Take care well of yourself, Rowan.” Your grip on them is tighter. You really don’t know when you’ll see each other again. You owed them so much of your happiness and life at Hogwarts. If Hogwarts a History had a glossary with the definition of friend, Rowan Khanna would have their photo there.</p><p>“You’ll be the best curse-breaker. You are the most skilled person I’ve met. Just don’t get yourself killed, okay?” they hug you back just as tight. You really do feel like crying. This person was not only your friend. They are family to you.</p><p>“You’re just as amazing Rowan, don’t give up on your dreams. You’ll be an amazing professor one day.”</p><p>“You don’t give up on Penny.”</p><p>You let go. Rowan is smiling at you; tears were now rolling down their face freely. This is the real goodbye, you think. You really hope they follow their heart. You exchange glances with Ben again, he should take care of them. It’s your silent agreement.</p><p>You turn to Patricia Rakepick, Penny is already waiting by her side.</p><p>“Are you ready?”</p><p>You exchange glances with your new partner in crime, “We were born ready.”  </p><p>Penny giggles. She had taught you that cheesy line. </p><p>Patricia takes out her wand, “Portus.” She had been carrying a black notebook with her, which quickly grew blue in her hand.</p><p>“Let’s.”</p><p>Both you and Penny exchange glances before touching the notebook.</p><p>Here we go.</p><p>An abrupt and powerful nauseous feeling went through your navel enough to make you feel light headed.</p><p>Ugh, you hated portkeys.</p>
