    <p>If you were to ask anyone who lived in Amity Park, they would say that the Fentons were a family of “crackpot ghost hunters”, an argument that would invariably fall on deaf ears for the family in question. Both had known about the magic in the world since they born. Jack had come to America after completing his education at Hogwarts, so he could explore the possibilities of non-magical technology without worry of the political climate in Wizarding Britain. Maddie’s story was much the same. Jack and Maddie met in college, surprisingly having never noticed one another in despite being in the same year, along with their mutual American friend Vlad Masters. Their college years were spent studying No-maj ghost stories, and set about finding ways to analyse and examine what defies conventional logic without relying on magic. In many ways, they were Unspeakables.</p>
<p>Jack and Maddie had gotten married right out of college, and were shortly thereafter blessed with their daughter Jasmine, known to everyone as Jazz. Their second child came two years later, on an unusually cold Halloween night. Maddie had been worried about her son’s health, due to complications that had appeared around that time. However, Danny had been born healthy, and they now had two beautiful children to dote on and, in Jack’s case, blather on about ghosts to.</p>
<p>Only a select few beings could have predicted what was to happen on the night after Danny’s second birthday, a night that would change numerous lives in ways that could only be seen in hindsight and ‘what if’s.</p>
<p>In a burst of golden fire, two figures appeared down the street from Fenton Works, the unmistakable home of the Fenton family. One figure was an old man, dressed in a purple velvet robe. His beard was white as snow and long enough that he could tuck it into his belt. On his head sat a triangular cap that matched the rest of his wardrobe. A pair of gold-rimmed half-moon spectacles sat perched on his nose, which looked to have been broken at least once. The second figure was far more noticeable, standing at least ten feet tall and built like a mountain. Long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face, he had hands the size of dustbin lids and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins. In his vast, muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets. The elder wizard drew a device that appeared to be a large lighter out of his robe, and clicked it, causing the glow of the street lights and even the neon of the Fenton Works sign to fly into the contraption.</p>
<p>They were met by a third, a gray tabby cat with square markings around her eyes that mimicked glasses. “I should have known that you would be here, Professor McGonagall.” Albus Dumbledore said, looking down at the cat, which quickly rose into an emerald clad witch with stern features. “Good evening, Professor Dumbledore, Hagrid” she greeted, before looking at the bundle in the latter’s hands. “So, the rumors are true?” She asked.</p>
<p>“Yes indeed, the good, and the bad.” The giant of a man handed the bundle to Dumbledore, who took it into his arms with care.</p>
<p>“You two may as well go and join the celebrations. I will handle this myself.” Dumbledore told his compatriots. A beautiful song trilled through the air, as a gold and red bird flew down to land on Hagrid’s shoulder. “Fawkes will take you back back to Hogwarts.” The phoenix trilled in acknowledgement, before alighting in flame. When the blaze dissipated, there was no trace of the half-giant and witch.</p>
<p>Dumbledore strode up to the front door of Fenton Works, and knocked softly three times. The door was answered by the imposing figure of Jack Fenton, clad in a set of pink pajamas with matching nightcap.</p>
<p>“Professor Dumbledore.” He said, a look of surprise on his face. He hadn’t seen the professor in decades, ever since he had left Britain to study abroad. “What brings you here at this time of night?”</p>
<p>“I’m afraid some grave news regarding your cousin, Lily.” Jack’s expression darkened.</p>
<p>“Come on in.” The Fenton patriarch gestured.</p>
<p>Dumbledore led him to the couch, and they both sat down. It was only then that the larger man noticed the bundle in the elderly headmaster’s arms. “Is that--” He began, only for the robed wizard to cut him off by pulling down part of the blanket to reveal a small face with a visible tuft of raven hair and a prominent scar like a stylized lightning bolt.</p>
<p>“On Halloween night, Lord Voldemort attacked the Potters. James and Lily were killed, but young Harry survived. Whatever happened in Godric’s Hollow, it stripped Voldemort of his body. As the closest blood relatives on both sides of his family, I believe Harry would be safest in your care.” Dumbledore explained.</p>
<p>“Wait, both sides of his family?” Jack asked, slightly bewildered.</p>
<p>“You’re wife’s maiden name is Potter.” He reminded him.</p>
<p>“Huh, and I thought I’d escaped the small world deal when I crossed the pond.” Jack commented.</p>
<p>“Indeed, I do find it somewhat funny the kinds of coincidences life throws our way.” Albus chuckled.</p>
<p>Their brief moment of humor was interrupted by a piercing wail that any parent quickly became familiar with. The bags under Jack’s eyes seemed to drag down at the sound.<br/>
“That would be Danny. I better go see what’s got him upset this time.” Jack said, getting up and moving to the stairs. Dumbledore followed, Harry still in his arms, now whimpering slightly. They got to the nursery where the youngest Fenton was restless. Jack picked his tiny frame up and started rocking him tenderly, and Dumbledore asked if he would like him to conjure a crib for Harry. Jack turned down his offer, suggesting that the two children share. As Harry joined Danny in the crib, Danny’s wail quieted into peaceful sleep. The two looked like twin brothers.</p>
<p>Only Dumbledore knew of the protective charms that were sealed by that action, ensuring that Voldemort could not touch him without the consequences being most severe.</p>
<p>“I will be checking up on you on a regular basis, and I can guarantee that I will see you in eight years time with a letter in hand.” Dumbledore told Jack on the front steps. Jack’s eyes widened in realization.</p>
<p>“So, my little princess is going to Hogwarts.” He said with a hint of pride.</p>
<p>“I will have to check to be sure, but I do believe both of your children will make fine additions to the magical world.” Dumbledore reassured him. “And do make sure Mrs. Fenton gets this letter.” He said, handing off a letter laced with a mild compulsion that would insure it got to its recipient, a measure that had to be taken when dealing with someone as forgetful as Jack Fenton could be.</p>
<p>As Jack went inside, Dumbledore strode down the street to a nearby alley. “Everything’s the way it’s supposed to be.” He breathed, before turning on the spot and disappearing with a crack.</p>
<p>In another distant place, beyond the view of mortals, a figure in a violet cloak smiled, the words he would have said already spoken.</p>
