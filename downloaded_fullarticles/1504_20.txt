    <p>“I can’t believe I just did that.” Draco breathed, sitting on Astoria’s bed, tucked in the furthermost corner from the Greengrass’s frontdoor. “I can’t believe I told my father to go fuck himself,” he added with a laugh. “You’re such a bad influence.”</p><p>“Really? Remind me again, who suggested that we run away to Paris? I do believe it wasn’t me.”</p><p>“Touche.” He grinned, still not rising from his position on her bed, while she bustled around her room, collecting clothes to take. “You don’t have to pack a coat, I can buy one for you.”</p><p>“You told your father to go fuck himself, I don’t think you’re going to be connected to his funds for much longer.”</p><p>“No, but I took money out well in advance and added it to a secret account.”</p><p>“You really did plan this runaway well, huh?” She mused, ignoring his offer for the coat, and chucking two in her trunk. “Should I take bathers?”</p>
<hr/><p> <span>Draco seemed exceptionally excited to be going on a muggle plane, Astoria was less so. Her family had gone on a few before, and the excitement had died down pretty quickly within her first flight. But she couldn’t whip the smile off her face, watching her boyfriend excitedly looking around the muggle airport, eyes flicking and focusing on millions of different things. </span></p><p>“You look like a puppy.” She chuckled. He shot her a toothy grin, squeezing her hand a little tighter. “We should be boarding within the next couple hours; do you want anything to eat?”</p><p>“Shouldn’t I be the one taking care of you?”</p><p>“That’s not very feminist of you.”</p><p>
  <span>“No, but it’s very, my-girlfriend-has-a-blood-curse-and-I-worry-constantly-about-her-and-probably-should-take-more-care-of-her, of me.” He spoke without thinking, adding a slight tone of humour to his sentence, without realising how much he had just revealed to her, without realising how much he constantly worried over her. “Sorry. How about one of those muggle hamburgers? From, what’s it called, Mac Daniels?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her glorious laughter filled the air, “McDonald's. You’re getting there though.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, but you’re going to have to teach me how to use one of those plastic card things, which I swear are magic.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s not.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How does it store so much money?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not sure, but its muggle. So it can’t be magic.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We should introduce it to the wizarding world.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, your father would love that. His only son, Draco Malfoy, introducing muggle technology into the wizarding world?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re right, he’d have a fit. Let’s do it.” He said excitedly, she laughed at him again, pulling him around the corner towards the McDonalds. He found himself watching her, happily bouncing towards the McDonalds, a hand grasped tightly in his. He was so amazed that she even cared for him, that she was running away to Paris with him. That she, this amazingly kind girl, who saw the good in every person, was with him, a death-eater who almost murdered two innocent students, and was the reason Albus Dumbledore was dead.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He was so lucky to have her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ohh!! Should I get a Big Mac? And chips of course.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah,” he flicked his eyes up, gazing at the menu plastered above the workers. “The chicken one sounds nice.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Gimme the card thing, and I can teach you.” She was so kind, Merlin every second she stopped talking, even when she was, he was stuck admiring her. Stuck just gazing at her, relishing in her beauty, thinking of how much he truly loves her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She poked his arm, “oi, watch.” She pulled him up with her, ordering, and asking to pay by card. She carefully inserted it into the machine, pressing a few buttons. And it was done. Paid for. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I tell you, magic.” He mumbled into her ear, slipping into French so the muggle serving wouldn’t hear. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You know I never learnt French, yeah?” She laughed, he kissed her in a split-second response. Slipping his arms around her waist, pulling her back into his chest and resting his head on her shoulder. “You’re awfully affectionate today.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you mind?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I love it. It’s just odd to me. I wouldn’t have pictured that you, of all people, would be the one to push the most public affection, and the one who is the most willing to hold and kiss me around others.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“A year ago, you struggled to even hold my hand. You struggled to let me hug you, and let me hold you. Love, a year ago you’d only held my pinkie.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I was depressed.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hm?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I was! I convinced myself you deserved better and drove myself into that hole. And I was never really hugged as a child.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know, my love.” She leant back into him a little more, relaxing into his hold.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Plus, I want to show everyone that you’re my girlfriend.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s awfully possessive.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not that way, but I’m proud to hold you in public, and kiss you in public because –” he stopped himself short, realising he was about to say what he truly felt. The fear in her rejecting him filling him before he could say it. “Is that our order?”</span>
</p><p>“Oh yes!” She bounced away, grabbing their order, bouncing back, and grabbing his hand happily, pulling him away to their gate. “You’re a surprising man, Draco Malfoy.”</p>
