          <div class="userstuff"><p>Harry is a runner. From place to place to place she runs, always<br/>
seeking something. That, she never finds.<br/>
She doesn’t find her something down Camden market where she spies a bracelet<br/>
gold leaf that’s cheap copper painted on,<br/>
(she feels that way sometimes)<br/>
buys a gold ring to keep. Her hair, shorn curls now, browner than<br/>
the roasted chestnuts she picks up at Hyde, watching the birds fly.<br/>
She hopes it’s to somewhere warm. </p>
<p>She runs into summer, glasses still searching. Her scar<br/>
not the one in pain, but her heart,<br/>
empty where it seeks that something.<br/>
But she does find a someone. A vertical girl with hair that drips down her body<br/>
like the sweat that pools down her back. Nails olive, like Harry’s shirt.<br/>
She thinks it’s fate.</p>
<p>//</p>
<p>Draco’s shirt (green and white stripes) goes up<br/>
and down, up and down –<br/>
a portrait of her life, a messy one at that.<br/>
All of the ups and all of the downs, written on her shirt skin<br/>
blood,<br/>
vertical lines surrounding her, green and white and white and green<br/>
vertical lines hemming her in, a prison –<br/>
just one of her own making. </p>
<p>She gets better. She starts to climb – up and up and<br/>
up into the sky, disappearing<br/>
into her dreams like the cat who curls by the bins to scavenge, two doors down.<br/>
She meets the girl again when she takes the bins out,<br/>
not making eye contact when she reaches down to pat the cat.<br/>
The empty spaces on her shirt, left for the dead – hollow and bitter and raw egg white –<br/>
suddenly look more apparent.</p>
<p>But they’re flush now, spaces melding,<br/>
a kiss</p></div>
