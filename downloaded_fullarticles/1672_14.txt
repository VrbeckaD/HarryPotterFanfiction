          <div class="userstuff"><p>'Come on, Scorp.' Al tugged at his sleeve, anxious to leave the crowded street. 'If we hurry, they won't even miss us before we get back.'<br/>
Scorpius looked at his friend's eager face and rolled his eyes. 'Why is it that every time we go to Diagon Alley, you want to go to Muggle London?'<br/>
But  Al wasn't listening, he kept dragging Scorp towards the Leaky Caldron, barely avoiding the exited eleven year olds who were shopping for their first year at Hogwarts.<br/>
'What is it with you and those Muggle sweets anyway? How old are you, seven or seventeen?' Scorpius knew he sounded a bit edgy but he didn't understand why Al simply couldn't buy ice mice, peppermint toads, or his own favourite; blood flavoured lollipops.'<br/>
Albus ignored him and was now walking backwards, almost knocking off an old witch's hat with his enthusiastic hand gestures. He didn't see her displeased look at all but yelled: 'You can win a holiday, Scorp!'<br/>
When Scorpius didn't react immediately, he continued: 'We could go abroad for a week and since our parents wouldn't have to pay, they can't stop us.'<br/>
Startled Scorpius looked at Al. His eyes were wide-open and sparkling, he had that innocent but infectious smile around his lips. The same lips Scorpius had tried to resist for two years now.<br/>
Finally giving in, he leaned towards Al, who's eyes got even bigger as Scorp said: 'I think you are as sweet as candy!'<br/>
And then he kissed him and found out Al really was.</p></div>
