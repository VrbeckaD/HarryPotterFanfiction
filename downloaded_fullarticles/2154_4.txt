<p>Hermione couldn’t believe her ears, nor her eyes. She was running down the halls of Hogwarts, her head whipping back every now and again to see if he was still gaining on her.<br/> <br/> Yep. He was.<br/> <br/> He growled with his dark eyes alive with fire from an anger no one could tame. His eyes were narrowed, although he could not see her. He was taking long and deliberate strides that scared her as she turned ever so slightly to see his menacing form behind her, a few feet.<br/> <br/> Hermione tried to ignore the stitch in her side, her heart thumping so hard she could barely breathe. Her eyes wide with fright as she tried to stop her gasping at every opportunity.<br/> <br/> He was still behind her though, that damned overgrown bat. His eyes were narrowed, dark and flashing in anger. He was wearing his usual robe, and it billowed behind him as he ran after her. His hair whipped all around his face as his dark eyes now crazily scanned the dark and echoing hallway.<br/> <br/> She stood suddenly, cupping her own hand over her mouth, trying to muffle the heavy breathing. He strode up beside her, carefully listening for anything that may be of importance. The running footsteps had diminished suddenly, and he knew the vandal was ahead. He didn’t bother to hold back the contemptuous smirk laid upon his lips as his hands went behind his back.<br/> <br/> “I have a proposition for you, whoever you are,” Snape said dangerously soft, his lips pursing every now and then, “either give yourself up now and perhaps detention will be the worst. Because if you don’t, and I catch you,” he trailed off, not needing to go on.<br/> <br/> Hermione was trembling now, the bottom of his cloak brushed very close by, and she could faintly see him through the Invisibility cloak’s fairly thin material. She refused to give herself up though. Professor Snape had no mercy. She could see he was on a mission, his anger obviously driving him. No one stole from Severus Snape. </p>
<p><em>Draco</em>, Snape initially assumed. The boy was the one who was most likely to steal from him; he often took far too many liberties considering the boy was his godson.  Bur why would Draco Malfoy feel the need to steal from him? He probably had all the supplies he needed right at his own home. No point in risking expulsion.</p>
<p>Then there was always Potter and Weasely; always up to something now that they were 7th years and Voldemort was gone. They thought they ran the bloody school at the worst of times and Snape gritted his teeth at this thought. His mind briefly flitted to Granger as a suspect as he was still convinced that she had stolen from him before. The Chamber of Secret; though he was never able to actually prove it. But no, the girl was too much of a teacher's pet for that. </p>
<p>He looked all around, listening for any indication that his hunch may not be pure imagination. He sighed frustrated, and leaned against the wall, directly beside Hermione. He stood rigidly, his eyes all over as he brushed some greasy dark hair behind his ear. He listened hard, waiting for anything to sound off.<br/> <br/> They stood like that for a good half-hour and during this time Hermione noticed the man’s determination. He stood with lips pursed as he waited for anything to help him catch his culprit. He really was a greasy git, his dark oily hair almost glowing from the light from the candles. His sallow cheeks so very pale, his beady, black eyes shooting all over. The man was like a checkerboard but less creative. Black and white. That was him.<br/> <br/> She shivered as she imagined his knuckles brushing her stomach. His fingers may have seemed lean and graceful looking to any outsider, but she knew what he had done with hands like that. He had been a Deatheater and although she pretended he did nothing to stir fear from her, he did. But as her fear started to diminish in the hallway, ever so temporary, she wondered sadly watching him, how he had managed through life. Alone and so unhappy with everyone he met.</p>
<p>He stood with his arms crossed in front of him like a spoiled child. He was frowning even more deeply now. Always isolated, she noticed, he could barely stand the other professors. She almost felt sorry for him, but recalled the moments she had spent with him earlier that day in his class.<br/> <br/> <em>“</em><em>Miss Granger, if you insist in raising your hand at every question I present and not giving your classmates a chance, I will take fifty points from Gryffindor for your annoying over-confidence.</em><em>”</em><br/> <br/> She frowned now, not that anyone could see. That man lived on sheer fury and anger and she didn't care if he was upset that he'd been burgled. But as his eyes began to droop from fatigue she noticed and sort of felt sorry for keeping him up. He did have classes to teach tomorrow morning and she had stolen from his stores after all.<br/> <br/> <em>Yeah, well you have to attend a bunch of classes, tomorrow, including his,</em> a voice said in her head, and Hermione was inclined to agree.<br/> <br/> Finally with a heavy sigh of defeat, he moved from the wall, startling Hermione and with a spin on his heel furiously strode down the hallway, his footsteps echoing off of the walls and after a few minutes he was gone. Thank Merlin.<br/> <br/> She moved slowly, almost expecting him to come back. She removed her shoes and quietly padded back to her dormitory. All her roommates were asleep, as it was almost three in the morning. She dropped the invisibility cloak beside her bed, leaning against her door and sliding down its smooth surface until she landed on the floor, her back still against the cool door.<br/> <br/> She then grinned and pulled the small vial from her pocket. She placed it on the marble floor beside her, feeling her smirk turn into a relieved and large smile. It clinked as it hit the ground softly, the glowing green liquid inside swirling around. It was actually quite breathtaking, the color and movement, it looked as if a small spirit was dancing, trapped inside.<br/> <br/> Hermione thought back to her daring escape, feeling as if Harry and Ron would be proud of her when they heard what had happened.</p>
<p>She had been in Snape’s storage that night, looking for a very rare and particular potion of Snape’s. She had seen it once when asked to retrieve lacewing flies in her sixth year.  And that evening she’d made it quite effortlessly into the potions storage room, having borrowed Harry’s invisibility cloak. But her confidence and single-minded determinism had caused her to overlook the fact: chance. And tonight, by chance, Snape had been drawn to his storeroom for a bottle of something for Pomfrey.</p>
<p>To Hermione’s total horror only seconds after she had grabbed the vial she’d been searching for, Snape had walked in, looking completely livid. He’d known immediately that someone had broken in and he had a feeling that he could still feel a presence. His head had turned to the side, listening for something, anything. And at that exact moment; Hermione had stifled a sneeze and a small squeak emerged. His head had whipped around, looking exactly where she was standing, and she felt her heart stop momentarily.<br/> <br/> “I don’t know who is in here,” he said with an angry scowl upon his pale face, that deep almost hypnotic voice, “but rest assured as soon as I catch you, detention will not even be an issue. It will be straight expulsion.”<br/> <br/> Hermione had felt her bladder freeze right there as her heart thumped painfully, expulsion? In her single minded pursuit she didn’t actually think she would have been caught. What was she thinking?! She had been so caught up in her plan she hadn’t even bothered taking this into consideration.</p>
<p>At this she had seen her chance, and grasping the cloak tightly around her, she had slipped past Snape. He scanned the room, his dark eyes trying to make out anyone inside. She wasn’t expecting his hand to come up and brush against her stomach through the invisibility cloak. His brief, unexpected touch caused her to suck in her breath before she knew what she was doing. At the soft sound she saw his eyes widen as he groped for her again, but she was gone into the hallway. He had heard the footsteps scamper down the hall in the direction of the Library and he had rushed off after her, determined to catch whoever thought they could take on Professor Severus Snape.<br/> <br/> Now safe in her common room she sighed in relief; Snape could not reach her here. She leaned over as she sat cross-legged on the cold floor, hypnotized by the dancing figure in the small vial. She smiled at her anticipation for this potion. She had been working for a few days now, and it called for the certain ingredient that couldn’t be found anywhere else. The small taped parchment, in Snape’s own cramped writing read of a small word; <em>Lust</em>.</p>
