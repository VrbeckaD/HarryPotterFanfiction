    <p>            Hermione stood with Ginny, Ron and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley over Fred’s, Tonks’ and Lupin’s dead bodies. Her vision was blurred with tears that would not stop falling. But there was work to do, she remembered dutifully. So their deaths would not be in vain and would not go unpunished. He Who Must Not Be Named had given them until midnight to collect and bury their dead, but while others did this, it could mean the perfect opportunity to finish their work. Voldemort could be with his defenses down, they could strike, kill the snake… All they needed was a plan. He might expect Harry alone to go to him and surrender, so they could find a way to… Harry!</p><p>            She looked around and he was nowhere to be seen. Could he have gone give himself up to Voldemort? No. No! She could still catch him if she ran. Could he be so thick? After all they’d been through, after everyone that had sacrificed themselves… he would just hand himself over. She thought again of the dead before her, along with the ones she did not know if were well or not… and Professor Snape. The image of his shacking boot, him lying on the floor of the Shriecking Shack, looking so vulnerable and approachable as she had never in all these years seen him before… Even after all he had done, he did not deserve to die like that. No one did. And the image of the silver liquid running down his eyes and ears came back to her. <em>“Take it”</em> he had told Harry. His last thoughts and memories. That is where Harry probably was! Seeing what they were, if they could help. At least that is where he should be. Why would Snape hand over his thoughts like that in his final moments if not to help them?</p><p>            She left Ron to his mourning with his family. They didn’t even notice when she stepped away from them, and that was a good thing. When she had reached the foot of the marble staircase, she began to run like she had never run before, until the headmaster’s office appeared in her sight. That is where the pensive used to be, where during the previous year Harry had delved into various memories with Dumbledore, memories which had stitched the path they were to follow, that they <em>had</em> followed all this year. But she did not know the password. Harry had always said Dumbledore’s passwords were names of sweets he enjoyed… What would Snape use as password? Unforgivable curses? If only this was still Dumbledore’s office, things might be so much easier… But he was just one more that had perished in this mess of a world.</p><p>            “Oh, Dumbledore!” She cried in grief as she remembered seeing his twisted body lying at the bottom of the astronomy tower. And suddenly the gargoyle opened to reveal a spiral staircase.</p><p>            She stepped up thinking that was a very unusual password for Snape to use. But this was not the time to dwell on such things. She needed to find Harry, figure out their next move.</p><p>            The door to the office opened and she rushed in, but there was no one to be found. Not even the old headmasters in their portraits. All gone. The room completely empty. It would have been so good to find Dumbledore there, have him answer all the questions she had… though it was a bit late for that, they’d managed to answer them all themselves, though with great difficulty and risking their lives countless times.</p><p>            She saw the pensive on the desk. So Harry <em>had</em> been there. He had to have been. She must just have missed him. If she ran with all her might, she might still catch him in the Great Hall. That is what she needed to do. But the pensive. It was calling to her. What would Snape have wanted Harry to see? She approached it and could still see images swirling inside it. Harry had left them there, Snape’s final thoughts. She was oh so very curious as to what could have happened, why would he have betrayed Dumbledore like that, who trusted him so much. Why would such a grave, closed off, bitter man leave his final thoughts to Harry, whom he seemed to hate so much. But now was not the time. No! She needed to find Harry. She ran to the door. Although… a quick look might tell her exactly where Harry had gone.</p><p>            She walked back from the door a few steps, back to the pensive and looked down. With a deep breath, she plunged herself forward into it.</p><p>           </p><p align="center">***********</p><p>            He sat on the floor of a run-down house, amidst overturned furniture and scattered belongings, rocking her lifeless body in his arms while tears flowed wildly down his cheeks. He held her as he has wished to all his life, but she was not alive and reciprocating his touch, his love, as he intended it to have been. In a corner of the room, a baby cried in its crib, and he cried uncontrollably as well, almost as loud as the baby, calling out her name. The pain… there was nothing like it. No Cruciatus could cause such pain. The scene evaporated as if it were mist.</p><p>            He was now angry, so angry. He had once again been humiliated at school, bullied in front of many onlookers who stood by laughing at him, and he yelled with all his might at his attacker. She came to his defense, and he, ungrateful little bastard as he was, in his rage fuelled display, insulted her. He regretted it instantly, but it was too late. Her eyes looked at him as they never had before. His heart broke as she turned to leave, insulting him in turn. He and his untactful and strange ways could not seem to express what he truly felt inside, what he wanted to say. And it was all ruined.</p><p>            Now he lay on the grass beside her. Leaves swirled in the sky above them as they laughed together. He felt something very strange to him. It might be what others called joy or happiness. If only he could hear her laughter every day, until his dying breath.</p><p>            “Sev,” she called. He still looked at the swirling leaves. The sky above was so inviting and irresistible. Its call was stronger. “Sev.” Her voice was muffled and far away. He turned to face her and saw her beautiful green eyes piercing his. She smiled and suddenly her voice was clear as day. “Wake up.”</p><p>            He came to with a gasp. Breathing was not a painless feat. He coughed and the taste of blood came to his mouth before it actually spilled out of him. “Fuck,” he said, gurgling. Speaking was painful as well. His hand still held his neck and was soaked in blood, as was his frock coat, as he lay on the floor of the Shriecking Shack. Every gasp for air made him lose more blood. His wand, he needed his wand. It was fallen in front of him, but thank Merlin it was intact. Without stopping what little pressure he could apply on his neck, he reached for his wand. When he touched it, he murmured the spells he knew that could heal his gashing wound. As long as he had his wand on him, it would work. He hoped.</p><p>            “Fuck,” he managed to utter once again when the wound was slightly more closed. The spell was not working as well as he had hoped, but at least he wasn’t losing as much blood and he had managed to make some of it return to flow in his veins. <em>That fucking snake.</em> He wished to have the pleasure of tearing it in two with his bare hands. But he had to go make sure Potter got the message, that all this hell hadn’t been in vain. The Dark Lord had to be killed. Why was that fucking snake under protective charms? How could Dumbledore have known it more than a year ago? Why didn’t he share his bloody findings? Wasn’t that what a fucking spy was for? So bloody infuriating, that manipulative prick. He started to bleed again, and so he murmured the incantations once more. If only he could know that Potter had done what was asked of him, that he had seen his memories and gotten Dumbledore’s final message, then he could give into death. To see Lily again. Would he see her again? But he had to die either way, it was all he could do to pay for his mistakes. A death for a death. <em>You disgust me </em>he remembered Dumbledore saying to him.</p><p>            He needed to get out of there, but without help and with his wounds not healing properly, he wouldn’t manage well. At least the potions he had taken daily to prevent any kind of set back he could think of seemed to have worked against the snake’s venom. He wasn’t a fool to walk amongst Death Eaters and the Dark Lord himself while being a spy, a traitor who could be found out at any moment and not take some measure of precaution. No.</p><p>            After repeating the incantation under his breath like a mantra, the wound stopped bleeding again. Though he had a feeling it wouldn’t remain that way for long. He listened closely and it seemed he was alone in the Shack. He dared not waste his breath or what little strength he had on revealing charms. He wouldn’t be able to fight any enemies any way. Especially since he had so many. He couldn’t very well walk out the front door, since he couldn’t meet anyone in the fragile state he was in. Both sides would want to kill him now. He would have to try and crawl his way out through the passage way that led to the Whomping Willow.</p><p> </p><p align="center">********</p><p>            Hermione fell back to the floor in tears. Harry was a horcrux as well, one You-Know-Who had not intended to create. He had to die. She couldn’t believe it. She looked at the clock on the wall amidst the empty headmaster portraits and saw there was only twenty minutes left of the time Voldemort had given them for Harry to give himself up. He was probably already in the forest, and there was nothing she could do. He had to die. She sobbed harder. She then remembered all the rest she had seen, all that Professor Snape had been through, and the fact his body was lying abandoned in the Shriecking Shack. He deserved so much more than that, that horrible ending. She could not save Harry or convince him not to give himself up, not after all they had been through to ensure all the horcruxes were destroyed and Voldemort could be killed. But she could go and retrieve Snape’s body, keep it with those of theirs who had also perished in this war. Ensure that he has a proper burial and all knew who he really was. She could do at least that. He deserved at least that.</p><p>            With tears still tracking down her face, she ran out of the headmaster’s office. She had little time, or else she could be met by Death Eaters on her way back. She ran through the hallways and down the staircases and reached a back wall of the castle that had been demolished due to the attacks it had suffered. She could see the Whomping Willow from there. And on she ran. Going through the front door would only mean she would have to stop and give explanations to those gathered at the main entrance and the Great Hall, and she had no time or the will to do that. She had a mission and she had to focus on it as to not be overwhelmed by grief and despair.</p><p>            The grounds were dark, calm, quiet. All the bodies had been removed from it and it seemed even the Whomping Willow understood the graveness of the situation, because it moved rather feebly when she approached it. For good measure, she waved her wand, that had been clutched tightly in her hand this whole walk, and a stick was lifted to float through the air and be stuck in the hole which rendered the ancient tree immobile. She slid down the hole in between its roots, into the tunnel that led to the Shriecking Shack, the tunnel from where they saw the horrible scene of Snape’s death. “<em>Lumos</em>,” she whispered.</p><p>            On Hermione walked, until she heard shuffling on the floor beyond. She stopped dead in her tracks. Could they have left a Death Eater behind patrolling the tunnel? Did they <em>know</em> about the tunnel?</p><p>            She raised her wand so the light could shine wider in front of her and saw a shadow. With a flick of her wand, her silent spell unarmed her opponent. She knew this because she heard the thud of a wand falling to the ground and an angry grunt. Hermione ran forward, so she could see who she was facing.</p><p>            “Professor Snape?!?”</p><p>            With one hand clutched to his throat, which was bleeding yet again and the other trying to reach his wand, he tried to speak, but blood trickled down his lips.</p><p>            Hermione rushed forward to him and removed his hand from his throat, trying a number of spells she knew to close his wound. None worked for too long. She held his throat herself, trying to stop the bleeding, desperate as his eyes grew wider with despair as well.</p><p>            “What do I do??” She cried. “How do I stop it?” Tears began to fall down her cheeks. She could not believe she was going to watch him die all over again. There must be something she could do. She had to remember. She studied so much, read so much, she could not fail now. Dittany!! Would the dittany help? She had to let go of his throat to summon it from inside her beaded bag.</p><p>            He ceased trying to reach his wand and managed to grab hers instead. He needed a wand to produce half decent magic in his state.</p><p>            At first she did not understand what he intended to do. But as he held her wand, still in her hand, and his neck, murmuring something, like in a chant or song, she felt the bleeding subside under her palms. Her bloody, desperate hands reached for his wand and handed it to him as well as hers. She watched as some color returned to his face – not that he had ever had much color – and as some of the blood got sucked back into his body. He could breathe again. He took away his hand and the wound was relatively clean, but not too closed.</p><p>            “Dark magic, Miss Granger” he said in the little husky voice he had. “Not so easily healed. It will open again soon.” He handed her wand back to her.</p><p>            And all of a sudden a look of surprise filled her face, as if she had remembered something. She waved her wand and produced bandages, which she proceeded to wrap around his neck.</p><p>            He was too weak and tired to fight her, though he did not like the thought of someone, a nosy student no less, touching him so much. Too much physical contact. He became annoyed rather quickly. “It’s no use, Miss Granger.”</p><p>            “Yes it is! It’ll… help, at least!” She continued wrapping as he looked at her with an arched eyebrow, as if asking for an explanation. “When Mr. Weasley was attacked by Nagini, the healer at St. Mungo’s said the wound only kept closed while it was bandaged. It’s what they did until they found a way to close the wounds…” She finished her job and wiped sweat from her forehead, which smeared his blood across her face.</p><p>            “I can’t… I can’t remember what they did to finally heal him, but I think this should help, until we find someone who can really help you.”</p><p>            “Thank you,” he heard himself say and was a bit surprised with himself.  She was taken aback. It was really strange to hear those words coming from Professor Snape.</p><p>            The Granger girl seemed to really care that he lived. How touching. At least someone did, if not even he did very much. Then it hit him, why was she there helping him? Why had she come back? Why did she not leave him to die, if she thought he was a Death Eater, an enemy?</p><p>            “We should go. We don’t have much time. I think… I think it would be better to place a charm on you. I don’t think I can carry you. Is that ok, sir?”</p><p>            Oh the indignity of it. Being floated around by the little Gryffindor princess. But what fucking choice did he have? He couldn’t even carry himself, not at the needed pace. “Fine,” he rolled his eyes. His voice was still really low and rasp.</p><p>            She waved her wand. “<em>Mobilicorpus</em>,” and lifted him to float beside her.</p><p>            “Why are you here, Miss Granger?” He asked as they moved rather hurriedly.</p><p>            “I… I came to retrieve your body, professor, so it could be buried properly, but…”</p><p>            “How… very <em>nice</em> of you,” he said sarcastically. “And what, might I ask, made you feel this surge of kindness towards a Death Eater in the middle of a war?” His tone was cold and ironic, as she had remembered it from his classes. Talking was so fucking painful, but he needed to know this.</p><p>            “I…” he would absolutely hate that she had seen his inner most thoughts and memories. She knew it. The fear of a schoolgirl filled her as it hadn’t in a while. It was as if she was back in his classroom, in the dungeons, in a potions class.</p><p>            “You… <em>what</em>, Miss Granger?” Even in his frail state he could still be very intimidating. He folded his arms across his chest.</p><p>            “I saw your memories in the pensive, sir,” she said slouching and blushing, looking only forward and not daring to meet his eye.</p><p>            “I see… those were meant for Potter’s eyes only. Who else did he bloody share them with?”</p><p>            “Oh no, don’t blame Harry. I went after him and couldn’t find him, but the pensive was there and I… thought it might help me find out where he had gone. I’m really sorry.”</p><p>            “Sticking your nose in other people’s business just as Potter. You have learned a great deal from him I see,” he said in anger. She didn’t quite understand what he meant. “And where <em>is </em>Mr. Potter?” He finished.</p><p>            Hermione began to cry again. “He’s probably in the forbidden forest. You Know Who gave him until midnight to turn himself in.” She sniffed and wiped her nose, smearing more of his blood on her face.</p><p>            “Miss Granger,” his voice was softer now, “you know then that…”</p><p>            “He’s another horcrux, yes. So he has to die.”</p><p>            They had reached the Whomping Willow. She was about to peak out and see if it was safe to go to the castle with him levitating beside her when he asked</p><p>            “What do you mean <em>another</em> horcrux?”</p><p>            She froze. Harry was adamant on not telling anyone else. Dumbledore hadn’t told Snape? But he deserved to know. He risked his life and had been, maybe still was, at death’s door for Dumbledore’s cause. He hadn’t told him? After everything he had done, Dumbledore couldn’t even trust him with that? No, of course not. Voldemort could find out and ruin his stupid, precious plan. What difference could it make if Dumbledore intended for him to die anyway, it seemed? Hadn’t he kept all his secrets? All the things he knew… and he managed to keep it all hidden from Voldemort. But she could tell him. There would be no harm now.</p><p>            She looked back at him. He seemed very impatient about being hovered along the way. And now his eyebrow rose yet again, in need of an explanation. Hermione’s voice dropped to a whisper, lower than what it had been so far.</p><p>            “He created six horcruxes. Intentionally. Dumbledore told Harry to hunt them down and destroy them. That’s what we’ve been doing this year. That’s… why we needed the Sword of Gryffindor. To destroy them.” It was odd. Trusting Severus Snape like that. It felt right, to some part of her, but another part felt scared to do so.</p><p>            “Six?” He shuddered at the thought. What that creature was capable of… funny that something could still surprise him. “And you destroyed them all? You do realize he won’t die unless…”</p><p>            “We got all but one.” She bit her lip in frustration.</p><p>            “What is it? Where is it? It needs to be destroyed.”</p><p>            “It’s the snake.” She looked at her feet as she shuffled them.</p><p>            “Of course,” he snorted. So Dumbledore could send him to die but could tell him this, trust him with this? He was next to that fucking snake every day, he could have found a way to end it. And to send fucking children on such a task!! The man really had no scruples. He must have kept them in the dark as well, full of riddles and what not. His blood began to boil in anger. “Put me down, Miss Granger. I have to kill that fucking thing.”</p><p>            She was still in shock of hearing him say “thank you,” she gasped as she heard him say “fuck”. She did NOT want to witness Severus Snape so angry he lost control like that.</p><p>            “Have I offended you, Miss Granger?” He rolled his eyes. “Let me go kill that damned thing so your friend does not die in vain.”</p><p>            “No, you can’t. You are in no shape… he’ll kill you! Again.”</p><p>            “I don’t care, as long as I get the snake first. If he wins I die anyway. If he loses, I’ll be sent to Azkaban.”</p><p>            “You won’t go to Azkaban. I can explain everything…”</p><p>            “No one else,” his tone was frosty cold again, “and I do mean <em>no</em> one, Miss Granger, must know of my motivations.”</p><p>            “But…”</p><p>            “No one.” He looked murderous.</p><p>            “Fine. I can explain and leave out some parts. I’m sure Dumbledore’s portrait can be helpful too.” Snape snorted. “But you can’t fight. I’ll take you somewhere safe and then I’ll figure out a way to get rid of the damned snake.”</p><p>            She pulled herself up through the opening at the foot of the tree and then pulled him out with a gentle movement of her wand.</p><p>            “We have little time. We have to hurry.” And she ran, him bobbing along behind her, into the castle the way she had come out.</p><p>            “I think I can walk now, if you don’t mind,” he hissed as they roamed the deserted halls.</p><p>            She let him down, but he still needed support to be able to stand. The indignities he was suffering tonight… Still he tried to walk away from her, back outside.</p><p>            “No!” She stood in front of him. “You are too weak.”</p><p>            He narrowed his eyes at her. “How… dare… you tell me what to do?” He was struggling very much to stand.</p><p>            “I don’t want anyone else to die today. Too many people have already. Please, let me take you to your office?” Hot tears ran down her face.</p><p>            He wasn’t able to stand on his own much longer. Though he very much disliked it, he had to succumb to her wishes. He was unfit to fight. And he wouldn’t admit it to anyone, not even himself, but he was touched that she cared if he lived or died. Why? She was just nice like that. Bloody Gryffindors.</p><p>            “Fine,” he sighed. And she grabbed hold of him just as he was about to collapse.</p><p>            She was still crying as she dragged him down the hall to the gargoyle that guarded the headmaster’s office. “Must you do that, Miss Granger?” He hissed.</p><p>            “Sorry,” she said still sniffing.</p><p>            She supported him up the spiral staircase, up to the desk on which the pensive still sat. She sat him on the chair behind it. He picked up the empty phial beside the pensive and stored his memories, stowing the phial away in his cape. He then sank into the chair and closed his eyes…. Only to open them seconds later with the sound of her rummaging through his cabinets.</p><p>            “May I help you, Miss Granger?” He said, annoyed.</p><p>            “Where do you keep your potions, sir?”</p><p>            “Excuse me?”</p><p>            “You’re a potions master. I very much doubt that you don’t keep potions around. There must be something there to help you not bleed out until someone can heal you properly.”</p><p>            Her perseverance was astonishing. She actually thought he could have a good happy ending when this was over. She was just prolonging his suffering. Now that he knew Potter got the message and there was nothing else he could do in his state, he could die in peace.</p><p>            “Where?” she asked again, impatient.</p><p>            It seemed she would not let him. <em>Fucking know-it-all</em>. He pointed to a cabinet in the corner. She hurried to it and after a few moments she came back with a number of phials for him. He analyzed all of them and was surprised to find that all she had brought was correct, including the Blood-Replenishing potion he had kept hidden.</p><p>            “Is there anything else?” She asked.</p><p>            “No…” he said begrudgingly.</p><p>            A sudden cool, merciless voice floated in, loud and clear as if its owner were in the room, speaking to them.</p><p>            “<em>Harry Potter is dead…</em>” it started.</p><p>            She looked at him, and he could see that all color faded from her complexion, even as his blood was still smeared all across her face.</p><p>            “<em>Tergeo</em>,” he flicked his wand and she was clean again. “Go,” Snape said. “Kill the damned snake. And kill him.”</p><p>            She ran out.</p>
