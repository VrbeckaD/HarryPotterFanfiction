    <p>For someone who had spent most of his life in London, Kíli Durin’s knowledge of the capital city was woefully limited. Hardly anyone could blame him though, for he had spent the majority of his 11-year life in an orphanage right in the middle of London. It was a large grey brick house. Despite its somewhat dreary exterior, it was clean inside with gleaming windows, roaring fireplaces, and a small garden in the back. It might not be the most luxurious place but it was a safe haven for so many abandoned children and orphans like Kíli.</p><p>Kíli had little memory of his parents, which he supposed was truly a blessing in disguise. He had seen too many of his fellow orphans having a hard time adjusting to lives without their families. But Kíli never knew his parents, not really anyway. He was sent to the orphanage when he was only 1 year old. Naturally, he had been very curious about his parentage, yet he could never get much out of the formidable-looking matron of the orphanage, Madam McGonagall. Kíli had no idea if his parents simply gave him up or were killed in an accident. Honestly, he wasn’t sure which version he preferred. Would you rather have your parents alive but not want you or have them both dead? Thus Kíli found it hard in his heart to begrudge Madam McGonagall, especially when the matron always treated him with special care underneath her somewhat stern appearance.</p><p>When he was younger, Kíli had always envied the orphans who got picked by potential foster families. He had always imagined that they would leave the orphanage and find a good caring family of their own to live happily ever after. He was never given the chance however, for Madam McGonagall insisted on keeping him out of any of those occasions. At first, Kíli thought it was because of his unusual appearance, which troubled him but only occasionally for Kíli was always the cheery sort. He was shorter than most of the other children and displayed signs of a beard (or should he call it whiskers) even at a very young age. It certainly wasn’t lack of nutrition, for despite common beliefs, the children in this particular orphanage were fed properly on a maybe not overly satisfying but still nutritiously adequate diet. Moreover, Kíli was not a skinny kid. True that he wasn’t the strongest nor the broadest. But he wasn’t weak by any means. He was lean but muscular, small but athletic, with more energy and life than most of the other children combined. Whenever he wanted, which unfortunately for the caretakers of the orphanage was most of the time, he could wreak real havoc. He, therefore, had to contend with himself that his parents must be quite short. Perhaps his parents were the indigenous people from the Andes, something he read from a book that he nicked from Madam McGonagall’s office, which would explain his short stature, strong build, dark hair, tanned skin, dark eyes, and high cheekbones. As for the mysterious whiskers, Kíli was none the wiser. When he did ask about it one day after being teased relentlessly by a new kid, almost in angry tears, Madam McGonagall shushed the nurse looking after him, assured him that there was nothing wrong with his appearance, and sent him out to the backyard. They had finally built a proper though quite small football field in the backyard, which quickly distracted him enough that he soon forgot the question.</p><p>Later, Kíli did wonder if that was why he was never presented to potential foster families. He was still hurt by the thought every now and then but his naturally cheerful nature and the many distractions in the orphanage prevented him from dwelling on the matter. After all, Madam McGonagall never seemed to like him any less than the other children. If anything, she seemed to tolerate him more, with his non-stopping accidents and his high-energy level. He was rarely scolded and sometimes he would find small treats in the forms of sweets and picture books hidden under his pillowcase. </p><p>Kíli did not fully realise his fortune until much later. He still remembered that fateful night when he was 6 years old. A boy Brian, who had been picked by a foster family a year ago, was sent back to the orphanage that day. Of course, no children were allowed to see him but Kíli was never one for abiding rules. Naturally, he sneaked off to the infirmary where Brian was kept that night and what he saw through the cracks shocked him to no end. Brian, a strong healthy boy before he left the orphanage, was covered in bruises, some old and some painfully new. What was more, the fire of life that used to be burning in his green eyes seemed to have died. It took them almost 6 months to coax Brian out of his shell and Kíli could never forget what he had seen that night.</p><p>Full of indignation and also curiosity, Kíli went straight to Madam McGonagall. He half expected the stern matron to scold him for being too nosy and send him back to his room. To his surprise, Madam McGonagall did answer, with barely suppressed rage fortunately not directed at him, “Not all children are treated nicely in their foster families. There are so many different reasons why people want to adopt. Most of them are decent people who cannot have their own children. But sometimes, you come across some really bad people who only want to adopt for their," she paused and cleared her throat, "personal desires. They are not common, but they certainly do exist, and no background check can weed them out for they can be seemingly respectable people, like Brian’s foster parents. Oh, how I wish those bastards roast in hell for all eternity for what they’ve done to those poor kids!”</p><p>“Is that why you never present me to them?” asked Kíli, though he had kind of guessed the answer already. He might not be the brightest kid, but his intuition was always sharp. For some reason he knew not of, Madam McGonagall was indeed looking after him. The matron gave him a rare smile, “Partly yes. I made someone a promise to look after you and I will not go back on my words. I know the orphanage may not be the best place for a child to grow up in but considering the dangers outside, I’d rather keep you where I can see you.”</p><p>A wave of relief and gratitude flushed through Kíli as he had never felt before. Acting on an impulse, which was really second nature to him, he flung his arms around Madam McGonagall and buried his dark head in Madam McGonagall’s warm chest, “This is the best place in the world for me!” He could feel Madam McGonagall freeze under his hug but eventually, he felt a soft hand petting his wild dark curls and he liked to imagine that Madam McGonagall was smiling happily when she did that.</p><p>Time passed and went. Soon Kíli found something else unusual about him. On his 7th birthday celebration, which was just a small affair in the humble orphanage but still an occasion for Kíli to overflow with excitement and energy, he discovered for the first time that he could do things with just his will. It was kind of embarrassing really. Mrs Lily Potter the cook baked a small chocolate cake that smelt absolutely divine and had Kíli’s mouth water before it was even brought to their dinner table. Of course, nobody was to eat the cake until the birthday candles were lit and birthday wishes were made. The only problem was that the matches were nowhere to be found and Kíli really couldn’t wait. Before anyone knew what happened, the candles lit up on their own under Kíli’s intense gaze and the room fell silent.</p><p>In the end, it was again Madam McGonagall who came to Kíli’s rescue. She muttered something about dry hot summer days (It was a very hot July) and prompted Kíli to blow the candles. Although nobody said anything on the matter, Kíli could have sworn that Madam McGonagall gave him a meaningful look before they were sent to bed that night.</p><p>Ever since then, Kíli started to notice more and more exhibitions of his strange ability. Granted he could not control it most of the time and he really should not be blamed for most of its aftermaths. His previous track record in the pranking department, however, meant that people tended to think he planned everything on purpose. Honestly, how could anyone think that Kíli would shave off Mrs Norris the orphanage cat’s fur, or that he would dye Dean’s hair neon blue, or that he would make Seamus tap dance on the dinner table, naked? True, he might have thought those ideas funny and just, especially after Seamus had accidentally set his favourite picture book on fire. But it wasn’t like he would actually act out the plan. Yet still, he kept getting into trouble for things he had no control over, which was both frustrating and scary for Kíli, and even Madam McGonagall could not overlook this any longer. Sighing heavily, she called Kíli to her office one day.</p><p>“You have always been a special boy,” Madam McGonagall’s tone was not unkind. If anything, she sounded almost proud, “When a friend of mine entrusted you to me, I understand all the implications that come with it and I have promised him to give you the best care I can provide. Your abilities surprise me though. I didn’t expect so much from such a young age.”</p><p>Kíli fidgeted uncomfortably under Madam McGonagall’s gaze. He wondered if he should apologise for all the headaches he had caused because, after all, he did cause them even though he never meant to. But his curiosity overruled and he asked eagerly, “You know about my ability? What is it? Some kind of superpower?”</p><p>Chuckling slightly, Madam McGonagall shook her head, “I’m not the best person to explain this to you. I’m not someone like you. But don’t worry. Someone will do it properly soon enough. My only job is to ensure your safety, health, and if possible happiness until that happens.”</p><p>“When will that happen then?”</p><p>“Once you’ve turned 11.”</p><p>This seemed like a century away for Kíli. “But that’s 4 years later!” whined Kíli as he was never one with much patience. </p><p>“Then I suggest you learn to be patient,” Madam McGonagall’s lips twitched suspiciously and Kíli sulked, “You will need that later anyway. But for now, you will be homeschooled.”</p><p>That was another blow for Kíli. How could he, a perfectly normal and fairly popular kid, well amongst the orphanage at least, be homeschooled? All his mates would laugh themselves silly once they learned about this. His displeasure must have shown quite clearly on his face for Madam McGonagall put a placating hand on his shoulder, “It will only be temporary until you can control your ability or until you’re 11. We will take turns to teach you and you can help us with the younger kids here. Oh please Kíli, your puppy dog eyes won’t save you this time. I cannot risk you losing control of your power in your primary school.”</p><p>Pouting unhappily, Kíli had to concede that Madam McGonagall had a point. It would be quite dangerous not to mention potentially humiliating if he lost control outside the orphanage. See, he was a perfectly reasonable young man, not some rash reckless kid like people liked to believe thank you very much. Still, if he could control his ability though, he’d be back in school in no time.</p><p>“How do I control my ability then?”</p><p>Madam McGonagall sighed, “As I’ve said, I’m not like you. I don’t know the details of such things. One thing I do know though is that such power comes from your heart and is controlled by your will. Maybe the reason why you lose control of it so easily has something to do with your disposition. Try to feel it and then reign it in, channel it and control it rather than let it control you. That’s the best advice I can give you.”</p><p>Of course, as Kíli realised later that day, since Madam McGonagall was not one with that ability, she actually knew nothing about magic and all her advice could all be bonkers. But still, it was the only one Kíli had gotten at the moment and it did seem to make sense, and it wasn’t like Kíli had to do anything stupid like running around naked to follow it. So he figured he might as well give it a try, just to see if it worked.</p><p>Miraculously, the advice did work, though it took a lot of practice and quite a few damaged items in the orphanage, one of such incidents resembled a small scale hurricane. Eventually, after two years of hard work, Kíli had learned to control his power. Nowadays, he knew how to move things and place them exactly where he wanted them when he was feeling lazy, which tended to happen quite often, how to calm kids and animals when they were upset or stressed, and most importantly, how not to lose his temper and cause things to explode or fly about in the room. After another incident-free year, Madam McGonagall finally agreed to let him go back to finish his last year of primary school after he promised not to use his ability outside the orphanage. </p><p>Even though Kíli was beside himself with joy to rejoin his friends in primary school, the one thing he truly looked forward to was his 11th birthday this July. School would have ended by then and Kíli would be ready to go to secondary school, which was another big moment in his life. He sometimes wondered what kind of school he could go to. He knew the orphanage was not made of money and he could not afford to go to one of those public schools. But his grades were not bad and his teachers told him that he had some real potential in arts and sports. Being an orphan of course meant that his choices in life would be limited. He had to go to one of those state schools but maybe he could choose a grammar school instead of a secondary modern. </p><p>This was not the main reason for Kíli’s excitement though. If Madam McGonagall was being truthful, someone like him would come to visit him after he turned 11 and give him the answers he had always wanted. Being a naturally curious kid, Kíli felt his heart swell with excitement every time at the thought of learning a secret of himself. What he didn’t realise, however, was how that secret would change his life forever.</p>
