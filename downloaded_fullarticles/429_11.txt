    <p>It took Draco surprisingly little time to get used to his new life outside of the Manor. His aunt Andromeda was a charming woman, formidable in a way that his mother shared as well as fond in ways that kept surprising Draco. For example, steaming cups of tea or, if the weather was too stifling, chilled water or juice, kept appearing from thin air at his side, even without the support of house-elves, and there was never a lack of cake around the house, either. Ted, Andromeda’s husband, a muggle-born wizard and the reason she had broken with her family in the first place, was open-hearted and charming, and Draco found himself sitting in the garden lounge chairs one evening too many, chatting away with him about insignificant things. </p><p>Dora, their daughter, was a bit of a conundrum. She seemed to have inherited her father’s humour and there were moments when she would stand with them in the kitchen, chatting and laughing, but then, a shadow would suddenly fall over her face, and she would withdraw herself and become taciturn and uncommunicative. Draco first wondered if it was because she had a problem with Draco and his mother sharing their living space - and he would not begrudge her the sentiment, seeing who his father was - but Andromeda ensured him it had nothing to do with them.</p><p>“She’s having a bit of a rough time of it,” she sighed. “Sirius’ death… It hasn’t been easy…”</p><p>And ever since, Draco had given her as much space as possible, in their cramped living arrangements. The Tonkses lived a simple life, compared to the Malfoys, and though Draco and his mother each had a small guest room for themselves, it contained no more than a bed, a small side table and enough space to cram in a medium-sized trunk. It became slightly claustrophobic if you spent too much time in it, so Draco found himself taking to hanging around all over the house and garden, and surprisingly, he did not mind the company of all the other people living with him too much. At the Manor or at Hogwarts, in the Slytherin quarters, he was used to hiding from everyone, but here, he found himself actively seeking out conversation, and even on a few memorable occasions helping out his aunt in the kitchen. </p><p>Some afternoons, he went to visit the Burrow. The Order had vacated their Headquarters after Sirius’ death - which, now that his mother was an official member, he was allowed to know the location of, and it turned out to be the old Black family home Sirius had grown up in. The problem was that after Sirius’ passing, the ownership had become unclear. Apparently, Sirius had noted down in his will that he wanted to pass all his belongings on to Harry - or at least, that’s what Dora had told him - but they first had to make sure that the will was more effective than the ancient blood-magic that tied the house to the Black family, and had therefore taken all safety precautions necessary.</p><p>Therefore, the Weasleys had returned to their own home, and with them, a new and yet familiar face had entered the Burrow: When Draco had first been over to tea with Dora and Fleur Delacour had casually strolled down the stairs and  enthusiastically kissed his cheeks, Draco had wondered if Mrs Weasley had accidentally put something into his drink. It turned out, though, that Fleur had passed a summer internship at Gringotts after her graduation at Beauxbatons and had met Bill. They had fallen head over heels for each other and were now engaged to be married.</p><p>The women of the family did little to hide their displeasure with Bill’s decision. Ginny was especially vicious when she got onto the subject, ranting and venting away to the point where Draco couldn’t help but resolve into helpless laughter.</p><p>“Your tongue is sharper than a Slicing Hex,” he deadpanned. “You’re sure you don’t have a little Slytherin in you?”</p><p>“No more than you've got Gryffindor in you,” she shot back, grinning when he made a face. </p><p>Ginny and Draco had, most surprisingly to him, developed an easy friendship over the summer. It seemed to drive Weasley insane, and Ginny didn’t exactly help the matter by mocking her brother about it every chance she got.</p><p>“I swear to Merlin, he thinks we’re shagging,” Ginny rolled her eyes, making Draco choke on the lemonade Mrs Weasley had pressed into his hands earlier that day.</p><p>“Excuse me?!” he spluttered, outraged.</p><p>“I know, right?” she sighed, shaking her head. “I mean, not that I didn’t use to have a crush on you, but you’d think he’d have cottoned onto the fact that you’re queer as a Christmas Tree in all rainbow colours, with fairies sprinkling glitter all over it.” Draco cleared his throat, trying in vain to fight the deep blush that was tinting his fair skin the colour of Gryffindor Quidditch robes, and Ginny snickered. “You didn’t <em>really</em> think I didn’t know, right?” she checked. "I thought I had made myself clear on the Hogwarts Express, dear."</p><p>“You really hang out with Luna too much!” he burst out indignantly. “Your brain-to-mouth-filter has diminished to an appalling level, Madam!”</p><p>“Sorry, not sorry,” she shrugged. “I spent years of my life biting my tongue and watching the two boys I was crushing on turning gay for each other, so I figured, oh hell. Only one life to live, and all that.”</p><p>“We’re not gay for each other!” Draco hissed. “Or well, that is… Harry doesn’t feel that way about me.”</p><p>“Puh-leaaaase,” Ginny groaned, rolling her eyes. “Harry is slow and ‘Oblivious’ is his bloody middle name, but he’s into you. Everyone can see that! Well, everyone who’s not my git of a brother, that is.”</p><p>“You, Ginevra Weasley, have a strange way of viewing the world,” Draco muttered, his voice strained. </p><p>“Will you at least admit it?” Ginny demanded, eyeing him through narrowed eyes. “Out loud, to me? That you’re hopelessly in love with him?”</p><p>Draco sighed, meeting her eyes.</p><p>“Fine,” he snapped. “So what if I am?!”</p><p>“Does Hermione know?” Ginny asked, unimpressed. </p><p>“Yes,” Draco shrugged. “And Viktor. Though no one else does.”</p><p>“Incorrect,” Ginny rolled her eyes. “Luna and Neville know, even if you never confirmed it to them. They’re not stupid, you know.”</p><p>“Funny,” Draco grumbled,  rather bitterly. “For the fact that even Hermione had no idea until a couple of months ago, it seems pretty obvious to everyone and their grandparents now.”</p><p>“Well,” Ginny shrugged, unconcerned. “We might have had a couple of discussions about you two ever since Cho and Harry broke up. That might have had to do with it.”</p><p>“I see,” Draco sighed, resting his chin on his knees and biting his lip. </p><p>Truth be told, he felt uncomfortable with so many people knowing, or even only suspecting his feelings. The more people knew, the bigger the chance was that it all got around to Harry eventually. And no matter what Ginny was saying, Draco still didn’t believe that Harry was anything but straight. </p><p>“Hey,” Ginny said gently, elbowing him in the ribs. “Don’t fret. I might have been messing with you and Harry on the train to London, but I won’t say a thing if you don’t want me to. And neither will Neville. He’s too polite. Luna… Well, no one can control Luna, but nobody takes her seriously, anyway.”</p><p>“Yeah,” Draco frowned. “I know. I just don’t want things to be awkward between us should he realise my feelings for him.”</p><p>“Have they been awkward after that convo on the Hogwarts Express?” Ginny asked, genuinely curious.</p><p>“Well, no,” Draco admitted, and it was the truth. Harry and he had been writing back and forth like always, using their enchanted parchments for quicker communication. Draco couldn’t really divulge all that much information about his whereabouts (he had been warned by both his mother and Andromeda that, as long as Harry was outside of the Order’s direct reach, it was unwise to tell him his exact location, for their own safety as well as Harry’s), but he tried to make up for it with nonsensical episodes that seemed to be amusing Harry throughout his dull days. </p><p>“See,” Ginny shrugged. “I think you’re worrying too much. As always.”</p><p>Draco glared at her. Ginny grinned innocently. </p><p> </p><p>Other than Bill returning to the Burrow and Fleur moving in, as well as Draco hanging around the house regularly, there had been further changes to the Weasley household. Fred and George had moved out and were now living in an apartment above their new shop at Diagon Alley, which was a booming success. Draco had only seen them around the house once since the summer holidays started, and they’d been basically flashing their new wealth in a way that Draco found incredibly amusing.</p><p>Also, Mr Weasley had been promoted to Head of the Office for Detection and Confiscation of Counterfeit Spells and Protective Objects, a department dedicated to fighting all the fake protection spells offered to terrified witches and wizards in the face of the Dark Lord's return. The family was ecstatic about the news, and Draco was incredibly pleased for them, drawing no little pleasure from the fact that his father would be raging in his Azkaban cell if he knew. </p><p>In the light of the great picture of the Wizarding World, things did not look as rosy, though. Fudge had been relieved from his office, a step long overdue and only taken after the collapse of a Muggle bridge caused by Death Eaters, and he had been succeeded by Rufus Scrimgeour, a former Auror who appeared much more crisis-versed, though that was all Draco knew about him. </p><p>The media had turned from demonising Harry through the last year into completely worshipping him. They kept calling him ‘The Chosen One’, presuming that the prophecy destroyed in the Ministry of Magic would proclaim him as the one to end the Dark Lord once and for all. It made Draco feel squirmy every time he read it.</p><p>The Death Eaters had been highly active ever since their failed coup at the Ministry. There were almost daily news of disappearances or murders now, Muggles and wizards alike. Ministry officials like Amelia Bones and Emmeline Vance had been found dead. There had been mass killings involving giants. Dementors had completely evaded the control of the Ministry and were now roaming the country, breeding and spreading an unseasonably mist and hopelessness everywhere. </p><p>Sometimes, Draco discussed these events with Harry via their parchments, but mostly, he tried to keep their conversation light, since it seemed that was what Harry needed the most. From what Draco could tell, his friend was not as subdued as he had been directly after the death of his godfather, but he was still struggling and appreciated the distraction, and Draco was glad to give it to him. </p><p>It was on the 12th of July that Hermione arrived at the Burrow. She pulled Draco into a tight hug when he came over to greet her, telling him that she couldn’t stand to be away from all of them for a day longer and that she was glad Draco was so close to them this time around, too. Draco couldn’t help but agree. It felt so different to be in the midst of it and not isolated and alone in the Manor for weeks and weeks.</p><p>“I just hope Harry can join us soon,” Draco sighed as he let go of her.</p><p>“I’m sure he will,” Hermione bit her lip. “Dumbledore won’t leave him with these horrible Muggles for too long, will he? Especially after what happened at the Ministry.”</p><p>It turned out that she was right. When he woke up the next day and entered the kitchen for breakfast, he found Dora chatting with his mother and his aunt, looking bone-dead tired, as if she hadn’t really slept the night. She sent Draco a smile though, saluting him as he took a seat at the table.</p><p>“Wotcher, Draco,” she said. “You should drop in at the Burrow later. Harry arrived there tonight.”</p><p>Draco froze in his movements of reaching for the teapot, staring at her, aghast. </p><p>“Harry?” he repeated, his hand still hanging uselessly in the air.</p><p>“You should have at least let him get some breakfast first, Dora,” Draco’s mother scolded fondly, smiling as she waved her wand to make the pot serve Draco his tea. Draco’s arm dropped back to his side. “He’ll be useless all morning now.”</p><p>“I’m sorry?” Dora said, raising her eyebrows and smiling, clearly intrigued. “I did not realise my words would have that kind of impact.”</p><p>“Oh, do shut up,” Draco grumbled, reaching for his tea to hide his blush. He had to do something about his behaviour. Teasing about his obsession with Harry was getting far too frequent for his liking. “Thank you, Dora. I’ll visit the Burrow later on.”</p><p>“Might as well have a quiet breakfast, though,” Dora assured him. “He came in late, so he’ll probably want to sleep in.”</p><p>“Alright,” Draco nodded, reaching for the scrambled eggs and shovelling some onto his plate. “Will do.”</p><p>“Oh, there’s the post,” Andromeda said absentmindedly, waving her wand to open the window, and indeed, a flurry of owls filtered into the room to deliver various items. This was nothing unusual: With four fully grown wizards and one teenager living under one roof, there was lots of post delivered each morning, resulting in a mini-spectacle reminiscent of the Great Hall. This morning, there was the usual delivery owl with the <em> Daily Prophet </em>, and an owl each for Dora and Ted to drop off their correspondence, as well as Aquila, who was bringing mail from Bulgaria. Then, there was a fifth owl, and it flew straight to Draco, dropping its letter in front of him, only just missing his eggs.</p><p>Draco picked it up curiously, staring.</p><p>The letter was addressed to him, and it was sealed by the Ministry, or, to be more exact, by the Wizarding Examination Authority.</p><p>“Oh,” Draco muttered, gulping. “That should be my OWLs.”</p><p>“Well,” his mother smiled encouragingly. “Don’t keep us waiting, darling. Open them.”</p><p>Draco took a deep breath and nodded, breaking the seal and tearing the envelope open. He quickly disregarded the cover letter and skipped right to the results, scanning them with quick eyes.</p><p> </p><p align="center">

He handed the parchment over to his mother, whose eyebrows raised seemingly higher with each mark she read. She shook her head as she was done reading, smiling as she passed the results on to Andromeda. </p><p>"How you got to be so smart I'll never know," she muttered, fond eyes landing on him. "If you add up your father's and my OWL results, you won't have such a good result."</p><p>Draco's mouth twitched. </p><p>"I could have done better, though," he told her, trying to keep a straight face. "I was distracted through the practical Astronomy and the History of -"</p><p>"Are you sassing your mother?" she cut him off, looking at her sister for confirmation, but Andromeda was just laughing at her. "Salazar beware you have children, 'Dromeda. They only make you feel inadequate."</p><p>"They say children are the best version of their parents," Andromeda said, fondly looking at Dora, but grimacing when her daughter chose that moment to change her hair from black to dark green. "Well, most of the time."</p><p>Dora turned to glare at her, and Draco grinned, digging into his breakfast. </p><p> </p><p>When he arrived at the Burrow, everyone was down in the kitchen, sipping tea. OWL results lay abandoned on the table, but Draco paid them no mind, rather turning to grin at Harry, who'd only just taken notice of him. </p><p>"Draco!" he called, eyes wide as saucers as he jumped up to pull him into a tight hug. "What in Merlin's name are you doing here?!"</p><p>"The others didn't tell you?" Draco asked. "Mother and I are living with my aunt Andromeda now. The Manor wasn't safe anymore, not after Father's imprisonment. Mother joined the Order, too, so we're officially 'in', in all aspects of the word."</p><p>"Oh my God," Harry breathed, squeezing him once before letting go, his grin so wide that Draco felt almost blinded by it. "This is brilliant!! I'm so glad you're here!"</p><p>"And I can say the same thing about you" Draco chuckled. "Dora said you arrived last night?"</p><p>"Dora?" Harry frowned, clearly lost. </p><p>"Tonks," Ginny supplied, grinning. "She's Andromeda's daughter, remember? Draco's refusing to call her 'Tonks', and it's driving her spare."</p><p>"I live in a house full of Tonkses," Draco called, exasperated to have to repeat the same argument again and again. "It would be confusing!"</p><p>"You call Ron 'Weasley'," Ginny pointed out, grinning. </p><p>"That's different," Draco frowned. "I'm not <em> living </em>with him!"</p><p>"Whatever you say," Ginny shrugged, smirking. Weasley was watching them from across the table, eyes narrowed. Harry was observing their exchange, too, he realised, though he seemed more taken aback than suspicious. </p><p>"So," Draco said, changing the subject. "Dumbledore dropped you off?"</p><p>"Yup," Harry nodded, catching his gaze, indicating that there was more that needed to be said regarding that subject once they were alone. Draco nodded, indicating he'd understood. </p><p>"Draco," Hermione spoke up. "Did you receive your OWL results this morning?"</p><p>"I did," Draco grinned, turning to look at her. He frowned a little as he noted the black eye she spotted, but chose not to comment and instead pushed on: "All 'O' except for Astronomy and History of Magic. You?"</p><p>Weasley rolled his eyes and muttered something under his breath. Draco ignored him. </p><p>"That's a wonderful result, Draco!" Mrs Weasley gushed, sending him a huge smile from her place across the kitchen. </p><p>"I've got one 'E'," Hermione admitted, clearly trying her hardest not to sound disappointed. "DADA."</p><p>"And you knocked your face into a wall in punishment?" Draco teased, a little relieved when she flushed and just rolled her eyes.</p><p>“No,” she rolled her eyes and gestured to her face. “<em> That </em> was the work of a punching telescope Fred and George left lying around. It won’t come off.”</p><p>"I see,” Draco snorted. “Well, congrats on defending your spot as top of the year. I doubt that anyone can beat your score."</p><p>Hermione flushed and smiled at him. Draco turned to Harry. </p><p>"How about you?" he asked. </p><p>"Nothing like your results," Harry snorted. "Seven OWLs, flunked History of Magic and Divination. But did fairly well at the rest. Even got an 'O' in DADA," Harry shrugged, smiling sheepishly. </p><p>"That's awesome," Draco grinned. "Can you imagine how Umbridge must be fuming?!"</p><p>Harry laughed at that, and Draco found himself manhandled into a chair by Mrs Weasley and served tea.</p><p> </p><p>He managed to have a private talk with Harry later that afternoon, after escaping the hordes of Weasleys and withdrawing into a corner of the garden, sprawling out over the sun-warmed grass and looking up at the sky.</p><p>“So,” Draco said, turning his head to look at Harry’s profile. “Dumbledore picked you up from the Dursleys’?”</p><p>“He did,” Harry nodded, facing him. “Had an… interesting conversation with them. About how much they sucked at caring for me, basically.”</p><p>“Well, fucking finally,” Draco groaned, feeling indignant. “Only took him fifteen years.”</p><p>Harry chuckled but did not answer.</p><p>“So that was the only reason he came?” Draco checked.</p><p>“No,” Harry shook his head. “He also needed to make sure that I… owned a house-elf.”</p><p>“Oh,” Draco muttered, catching on immediately. “Of the Black estate.”</p><p>“You know about that?” Harry blinked.</p><p>“Mother’s in the Order now, remember?”</p><p>“Right. Yes, Sirius left it to me, and Dumbledore said that, if I really am allowed to own it, Kreacher would be obligated to follow my orders.”</p><p>“He is quite right, of course,” Draco nodded eagerly. “And did he?”</p><p>“He did,” Harry confirmed, looking rather sick at the memory.</p><p>“Well, congrats,” Draco snorted. “Your very own house-elf, huh?”</p><p>“If I never have to see him again, we’ll both be the happier for it,” Harry hissed, glaring at him half-heartedly. “I can’t set him free because he knows too much about the Order and he’d run right to your aunt Bellatrix with it, but I sent him to work at Hogwarts. He should be well-hidden there.” Draco nodded, not saying anything. “Dumbledore also took me to talk a retired teacher into returning to Hogwarts,” Harry continued, effectively changing the subject. “So, that was weird.”</p><p>“Okay,” Draco frowned. “Who was he?”</p><p>“His name is Horace Slughorn,” Harry told him. “And I’m not sure I liked him much. He seemed much too fascinated with fame and celebrities. He had this photo collection of students who’d turned out to be successful, or famous for one thing or another. He said my Mum used to be one of his favourites.”</p><p>“That sounds dubious indeed,” Draco frowned. “Why did Dumbledore want him back?”</p><p>“He did not say,” Harry shrugged. “Just that it was important. Apparently, Voldemort was after him, too.”</p><p>“Huh,” Draco frowned. “Did he agree?”</p><p>“Reluctantly,” Harry nodded. “But eventually, he did.”</p><p>“I guess we’ll have to deal with him from now on, then,” Draco drawled, feeling less than enthused about the idea. He’d really hoped that after Umbridge, Dumbledore would actually present them with a proper teacher. But maybe he was judging too early and, despite Slughorn’s apparent penchant for favouritism, he was actually a decent educator.</p><p>“Dumbledore also told me that I’ll have no more Occlumency lessons with Snape this year,” Harry informed Draco, tearing him out of his mulling. “Instead, I will have private lessons with Dumbledore.”</p><p>“<em> Really? </em>” Draco asked, intrigued. “And what will he be teaching you?” </p><p>“He didn’t say,” Harry muttered, sounding hesitant now. His eyes caught Draco’s, and he could tell that Harry was building up to something big. So Draco held his tongue and waited. “He didn’t say what exactly he would be teaching me,” Harry repeated, taking a deep breath. “But whatever it will be, I think it must be something to help me kill Voldemort.”</p><p>Draco stared at him, needing a moment to find his voice.</p><p>“And why would he need you to do that,” Draco asked, his voice sounding thin. He thought he knew the answer, but he needed Harry to say it. </p><p>Harry sighed, licking his lip. Draco realised that Harry was scared about telling him, maybe as scared as Draco was about hearing it.</p><p>“Because of the prophecy,” Harry said, at last. “The one that got smashed at the Ministry?”</p><p>“I thought no one ever got to hear it?” Draco checked.</p><p>“Dumbledore was the one it was first made to,” Harry explained. “He showed me his memory, and… it basically says that I have to kill Voldemort, or he has to kill me.”</p><p>Draco felt like he was falling, even though he was lying on solid ground. Only when Harry was touching his cheek did he realise that he wasn’t breathing. He inhaled a wheezing breath, and Harry watched him, eyes wide and skin pale as he bit his lip, hovering above him now.</p><p>“Damn it, breathe,” he hissed. “That’s why I didn’t want to tell you! I knew you’d freak!”</p><p>“I thought it was all made up,” Draco muttered, his voice cracking. “I thought the <em> Prophet </em>-”</p><p>“No,” Harry shook his head. “They’ve got it right.”</p><p>Draco lay there, staring up at him uncomprehendingly. Because this could <em> not </em> be happening. Out of all people in the world, or even of Wizarding Britain, this burden couldn’t be falling on <em> Harry </em>. </p><p>“Hey,” Harry murmured, gently drawing Draco’s attention back to him. “It’s going to be alright. This doesn’t change anything.”</p><p>“<em> How </em> does this not change anything?” Draco demanded, his voice high.</p><p>“Because we all know he would have come after me, anyway,” Harry shrugged. “He won’t stop until I’m dead. And if we’re honest, neither will I. So one of us will have to die eventually. That’s how it has to end.”</p><p>Draco made a noise in the back of his throat, one that sounded very unlike him, and Harry lowered himself so he was lying next to Draco again and pulled him into a tight embrace. They stayed like that for a long time, until Draco had stopped trembling and his throat had stopped burning with every inhale and exhale. </p><p>“Are you alright?” Harry asked him eventually, and it made Draco laugh, a little hysterically, and Harry seemed alarmed as he pulled away to scan his face.</p><p>“I should be the one asking <em> you </em> that question, you know,” Draco ground out between gasps of bitter laughter. “I should be comforting <em> you </em>, not the other way around!”</p><p>“Well,” Harry frowned. “I’ve had a couple of weeks to come to terms with it. But ever since, I’ve been most worried about telling you. Because I didn’t know how you’d take it.”</p><p>“Obviously, your fears were unfounded,” Draco muttered sarcastically. “I’m taking it very gracefully, am I not?” Harry just looked at him, not answering. They were silent for a long moment. “Was it naive of me?” Draco sighed. “To hope that you could get through this war with a minor role? One that would actually be appropriate for your age and experience?” When Harry still didn’t reply, he added, even more quietly, “I just want you to stay unharmed.”</p><p>“I know,” Harry whispered. “And I swear to you, I’ll do everything I can to get out of it alive.”</p><p>“Oh, I’ll make sure of it,” Draco breathed, catching his eyes. “You don’t really think you’ll be alone in this for one second, right?” The expression on Harry’s face told Draco that this was another reason why he had kept silent until now. “You can’t get rid of me now, Potter,” Draco warned. “No matter what happens, I’m with you till the end.”</p><p>Harry gulped and turned onto his back, staring up at the sky again. They did not speak for a long time, but eventually, Harry entwined their fingers, and Draco knew they were okay. </p>
