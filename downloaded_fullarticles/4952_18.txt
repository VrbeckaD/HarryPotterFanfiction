</p><p align="center"><em>here is the root of the root and the bud of the bud</em><br/> <em>and the sky of the sky of a tree called life</em></p><p align="center"> </p><hr/><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Credence is ten years old. He comes to live with the Graves after he wins the lottery in adoption. Or at least that’s how Carlotta says it, scrubbing Credence’s unruly hair down with a comb missing two teeth in front of the water-spotted mirror in the boy’s washroom. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">There are only two washrooms at the Orphanage, one for boys, while another is for girls. Fifty beds in total squeezed into three separate rooms parallel to each other, matchstick metal beds pushed side by side with hardly any breathing room in between. The mattresses are lumpy, the covers moth-ridden and thin, smelling of a musty closet. Still, Credence considers them the height of luxury. He has a cubbyhole with his name on it, where he can store a few of his things. He has clean clothes, comfortable shoes that actually fit him, an hour each day devoted solely for playing. The food, best of all, keeps him from going hungry: pumpkin soup and watery milk for lunch, and buttered rolls, if donations have been particularly generous. Sweet cakes dusty with confectioner’s sugar that leave his mouth feeling soft and his hands chalky with powder. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">The Orphanage is run on magic. It feels strange to say it, to think it, to believe that magic exists in a world alongside trains and factories and the unbendable laws of physics. That it courses through Credence’s veins like blood — a heritage, or a sickness passed on by his dead parents. A curse from the grave. His mother, his real mother, not Mary Lou, his Ma, had been born a witch. But Credence could not make objects move no matter how hard he wiggles his fingers, or thinks himself into a headache; he could not will anything into being, though, that, he’s been told, takes a great deal of skill and power to achieve, and not everyone is able to do it on the first try, or the second, sometimes even at all. The other children call him a <em>squib, </em>and Carlotta says it’s a bad word meaning someone who can’t do magic, a freak. Credence doesn’t know what’s so bad about not being able to do magic when he’s never uttered a spell in his life. He’s used to doing things the regular way, by hand, on his own: folding laundry instead of charming them to do his bidding, hanging up the washing or making the bed, scrubbing blood stains from the collar of his shirt with cold water and vinegar instead of casting a cleaning charm. There are spells for these mundane tasks, for every little thing, even waking the dead. But he can’t, for the life of him, make a simple feather fly. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">This, of course, is not surprising. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Credence has never been anything special, had no outward knack for anything except incurring the wrath of his Ma. He still dreams of that night: of waking up in the fire, and wetting himself in fright, running out in the street in his bedclothes, listening to his Ma’s shrieking from inside the Church, her screams echoing like the toll of a bell inside his ears. Standing there watching the Church go up in flames, while spectators stood thronged alongside him, like it was the most spectacular sight on earth, their eyes glassy in wonderment. <em>His sisters </em>— by the time the fire department had arrived it had already been too late to save them, the Church had burnt to the ground, leaving only charred remains.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">The woman, Tina, wearing a brown overcoat, had knelt in front of Credence later, wiping soot off his face with her bare hands as she cradled his cheeks and wiped his eyes. He was not even crying, too stunned to process the suddenness of death. “It’s all right, Credence. I’m a friend,” she said, even though he had never met her before. “My name is Tina Goldstein, and I’m here to take you somewhere safe.”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">*</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Every year, the Orphanage received a fairly hefty donation from the Graves of Upstate New York. What Credence knew about them: their wealth, and importance. They were part of the old world, distinguished by the accomplishments of their ancestors. Someone in their bloodline had been part of the Original Twelve, whatever that meant, and because of that, the Graves were fairly famous. There were three men in their line, brothers, but the first one was the one of most significance: Ulfius Graves who’d fought in a war of some kind and was now dabbling in politics. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">The Graves led the annual Charity Ball for the Orphans of New York, which was held every Christmas in a hotel in Manhattan. Everyone, all fifty children at the Orphanage, was made to participate, dressed in their Sunday best with their secondhand shoes buffed to a shine, their hair stiff with pomade. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">All fifty of them stood in excited worry in a corner of a very opulent room frosted with sparkling chandeliers and floating Christmas candles. They sang Christmas Carols all throughout the evening, their voices quavering on all of the high notes, none of them mentioning religion or the Lord — <em>when sleigh bells ring and choirs sing, and the children's faces shine — </em>while the adults, dressed in fine robes and decked in expensive jewelry, paused in their conversation to coo and caw. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">The adults were important people, Credence knew, politicians, dignitaries, or else from wealthy families upstate with peculiar sounding names. The children were allowed to mingle, granted they were within the matron’s eye line and never strayed. They ate dinner at a separate table reserved solely for orphans, the evening’s guests, because it was important to make that distinction, roast turkey still shining with glaze and something called squab pie served with clotted cream on the side. There were gifts from charity donors: bags of school robes, and heavy boxes of toys, used spellbooks with the bindings still in tact for when some of the children started Ilvermorny — wizarding school — in the fall. A speech was made by the Orphanage Director, various points of which were punctuated by applause, laughter, and knowing looks. Next came Ulfius Graves, who announced he was running for Congress and had made the timely decision to adopt.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">*</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Carlotta is Credence’s age: tall, reedy, with a Brooklyn toughness to her. Her pearly white teeth made her brown skin stand out. She is Credence’s first friend at the Orphanage, his only friend. She sat with him during meals, and taught him spells she learned while she was still living in the streets, before she was rescued. They were simple enough spells, for cleaning and taking care of one’s self, but he could barely bring himself to say the words without stammering. They slid over his tongue, slippery as tea steam, and at night he practiced them over and over, stumbling over the syllables with his fingers poised in the air. Still: there was nothing. No sparks shooting out of his hand, not even a prickle in the back of his neck which Carlotta had said sometimes happened. He was ordinary, <em>a squib</em>. Even in this world where the laws of the land were governed by wild magic, he was an invert, strange. Ma had been right about his wrongness: he was a dull, stupid boy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He did not belong here. He did not belong anywhere. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">*</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Carlotta teaches him: this is how you ask for more bread during supper, this is how to make yourself small when the matron is in one of her moods. She seemed to have all the answers, assuaging his fears of not being able to perform basic spells like some of the other children. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">When Credence learns he’s being adopted, he’s called into the director’s office to meet Ulfius Graves — a tall and imposing man with an abundance of rings in his left hand. He clutched a cane in the other, ivory with an elaborate derby handle in the shape of a griffin’s head. Ulfius stood by the window, with his back facing the door, and when Credence slipped inside the room with his head bowed, he turned and looked over his shoulder, his silver eyes passing through Credence before he turned his gaze back to the yard outside overrun with children. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Credence,” said the Director, Mr Ordos, his hands steepled on the desk. “I’d like to introduce you to Mr Graves.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">*</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Nothing changes when Credence came to live with Ulfius Graves, at least not at first. Carlotta doesn’t cry when she bids Credence goodbye; instead she sits him in the washroom and washes his face with soap before combing out his hair. She tells him to hide his scars, to lie when he’s asked about how he’d gotten them, to never talk about the fire or the strange dream he kept on having. “They don’t want you damaged,” she says matter-of-factly, her fingers gentle in his hair. “He’ll want a son, not an orphan. Now keep your chin up and give us a smile, Credence. You’ve won the lottery! You’re free.”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">But freedom, Credence knows, comes with a high price. Moses had led a hundred thousand people out of Egypt in a single night, slaves to the King, through fog and desert and across the Red Sea. Some of them, his Ma said, who did not have faith, died before they could reach the promised land. They were those who doubted God, the non-believers. Never mind that they did not ask to be saved, or to be born as slaves, or to not recognize salvation when they saw it. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">A trunk is sent to the orphanage, heavy with brass locks, the leather abraded and bearing the Graves family crest. Credence is expected to fill it with his belongings but he only has very few with him: a pair of shoes, a hat, and the long coat he’d grabbed the night of the fire, when he ran into the street in damp bedclothes to watch his Church burn. His last meal at the orphanage consists of dry bread and lentil soup. Carlotta touches his hand under the table. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">The matron accompanies him to the train station, hidden from no-majs by a concealment charm, and looking deceptively just like an ordinary train station: except — there were wayward owls flying about, chased by their harried owners, and a goblin manning the ticket booth, chewing on a piece of cigar. The station is built like a cathedral, with tall arches and smooth marble flooring, a mural painted on the ceiling moving with the ebb and flow of the weather outside. An ornate clock stood in the middle of the bustle, the numbers painted in Roman letters announcing the time. Credence gapes.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“You can’t <em>floo</em> in because they haven’t cleared you yet,” the matron explains as they board the train and she buoys him forward in the direction of their carriage. “So now we must take the train.”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1"><em>Flooing</em>, as Credence, understands it, as he’s only done it once, is supposed to cut their travel short. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Taking the train will require more patience, more time that the matron doesn’t have; she’s a busy woman, her days filled with endless amount of paperwork and keeping stubborn children in line. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Credence has never been aboard a train before, though he’s stood just outside the station to hand out flyers. The matron buys them sandwiches from the cart but he’s too nervous to eat, wringing his hands in his lap until the matron’s hand shoots up and halts him on the wrist. “Stop fidgeting,” she says, before giving him a pointed look under her half-moon spectacles. He angles his body toward the window instead. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">The train is slow, nudging unhurriedly from one station to another, ambling past rows of sleepy houses, crowded with sagging lines of washing, before the scenery gives way to fields and farms, and plowed chocolate-colored earth. With the window open a crack Credence can smell the greenness pervading the air, the rich woodsmoke fragrance of the countryside — nothing like the coal and burnt rubber scent of the city, which often made his sisters sick with a cough that never seemed to abate. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">The train pulls into the last station, whistling like a sonorous tea kettle announcing boiling point. Credence is hustled out of the carriage, and then onto the train platform, the matron’s steps brisk as she cuts through the aimless crowd like a sparrow, Credence hurrying after her with his heavy trunk thunking each time his trolley rolls over a crack in the flooring. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">When she stops abruptly, he almost barrels straight into her. She turns, then, to smooth the hair from her face and check her lipstick in a compact mirror, which she snaps shut the second she hears her name being called.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Mallory Gerhardt,” says a melodious male voice, belonging to a bespoke man with an immaculate mustache and waring dark green robes. “How wonderful to see you! Is this the boy?”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">They look to Credence simultaneously. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Credence holds his head a bit higher, uncurling from his slump. “Yes,” the matron says, turning her back on him, seeming to soften at the sight of the man. “And Mr Graves?”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“He’s just about ready to meet him,” says the man, giving Credence another passing glance.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">*</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">The Graves Estate sits surrounded by the Hudson River, an on island fifty miles north of New York City. The manor: fifteen rooms in total and built nearly a century previous, with large archways and an elaborate Victorian terrace made of mellow Yorkshire stone, dark slate roofs embellished with spired turrets. On the grounds surrounding: a huge secluded garden filled with fruit trees and smooth, well-tended lawns and a greenhouse cruelly overrun with holly. A manmade lake that glittered like a newly minted coin where two boats were moored, incongruous, on the dock. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Mr Graves walks him through all of it, accompanied by a nervous house-elf named Tilly who stumbles after them as they take a tour of the grounds. He is brusque, but not unkind, possessing the air of someone who is quick to dismiss others, who has never lost an argument in his life, who is used to always having the upper hand. He’s never been married, preferring instead to keep to himself. Often Credence catches him reading in the parlor, standing instead of sitting, as if about to spring upon a new idea. He drinks wine after every meal, leaving glasses in the parlor faint with reddish dregs. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">He makes Credence nervous.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">At dinnertime, when he can make it, Mr Graves asks Credence about the books he’s read. His room had been furnished with shelves of required reading, to accommodate the years of magical education he’s missed. He had a tutor too, several, actually, each one sent home for a myriad of reasons, lacking education, or bearing little pedigree, or else having said the wrong thing. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Mr Graves is an impatient man and Credence often worries about not being quick enough to respond when Mr Graves speaks to him. He knows he should call him Father, that he owes Mr Graves this much. But somehow he can’t bring himself to say it, the word perpetually stuck in his throat, like a lodged stone, and Mr Graves doesn’t seem to notice he speaks only when spoken to. <em>Yes, </em>or<em> no, </em>and<em> please, </em>and<em> thank you. May I be excused? </em></span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">He’s hardly home anyway, leaving the care of his charge to his house-elves and servants who all treat Credence with a kind of contemptuous care. “Please eat your food. I don’t want any trouble from Master.” They feared him, and the bell Mr Graves used to summon them on sight, that shrill ringing searing through the house like a grating scrape. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Credence holds his breath each time Mr Graves picks up the bell, steeling his ears for the shouting that was to come. How difficult it was, he often lamented, to find competent help these days! To remember that he liked two sugars in his coffee, his eggs fried with onions and cheese, his bottle of Cinsault not moved from the nightstand! </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Credence often worried that he would suffer the same fate as the servants, sent packing and returned to the Orphanage once Mr Graves deemed him dull and uninteresting. So he did his best studying, poring over the moving books shelved in his room, reading all about the history of magic, and the first settlement of wizards in America, and a group of terrible people called scourers, preparing himself for the inevitable questioning at the end of each meal. Sometimes he impressed Mr Graves with his knowledge of magical history, especially if they concerned someone in the Graves line. Credence is quick to memorize names, dates, and places, who killed who, and which treaties were signed when and what they were for. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">But he still can’t do magic. Credence’s fear lay in that Mr Graves would start noticing and ask him to show him a spell he’s learned. The thought of owning a wand — witches and wizards got theirs before they started school — terrifies him, and he dreams sometimes of the night of the fire, the fresh sting of welts marring his back, the anger and frustration seeping out of his eyes and clenched fists, radiating warmth and covering all of him like a veil. His teeth aching with the pain of trying his best not to cry. It happened just like that: he was asleep, and then he was awake, fire licking up the walls of his room and choking him with smoke. Then Credence got up, slowly, like he was slogging through mud, lost in a daze. Often times he wondered if it he dreamt that he had walked out of the Church alive and unharmed. If he was still dreaming at all.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">*</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">They put him in a room at the end of the hall, bigger than any of the rooms at the Orphanage, bigger than the Church. His room is his own small kingdom, with a window seat and a double dormer window looking out to the river, a protrusion of shelves lining the walls and a four poster bed fringed with long-hanging drapes. There is an elaborate walk-in closet filled with boxes owned by its previous occupant: moving childhood photographs of a young child, younger even than Credence, preening and waving at the camera, old clothes and crimson uniform robes smelling of undisturbed dust; a collection of accolades stuffed and poorly spellotaped in one box: <em>Quidditch House Cup 1905</em>, the lettering so verdigrised with age Credence has a hard time reading it without squinting.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">It takes him a minute to pace the whole of the room. Here, the floorboards do not sag under his footsteps, and the eaves do not whistle or moan at the barest hint of a breeze. The bed is always soft, and tea always replenished, kept hot by a warming charm cast by the servants. Credence touches objects like a child seeing everything for the first time, bursting with wonder and awe like a wineskin filling up at the sight of all that perplexed and bewildered him: the bowl of candied fruit left by the house-elves sitting on the nightstand, the tomes on the shelf with their embossed titles fading with time, the delicate carvings in the stone fireplace, curved asymmetrical designs full of detailed sweeps and flourishes like beautiful Spring leaves. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">He steps back to admire the coat of arms above the fireplace and peer into the inscription: <em>aut vincere aut mori,</em> victory or death, his tutor had said, the words freighted with so much meaning the family lived and died by it. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">*</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Credence reads. He devours books, at first because he knows he’ll be tested, asked about them at dinner, but soon enough he develops a love of reading. He spends afternoons in the library, when not buried to the ears in lessons, hunched in an armchair by the fire with his knees pulled up to his chest and a blanket draped over his lap, paging through leather bound volumes. There were all kinds of books in Mr Graves’ library, some no bigger than a hand, or missing several pages, with spines hanging loose and covers needing mending. What he loved most of all were adventure stories, peopled by heroes and knights riding winged horses, and powerful wizards with long thick beards offering sage advice. He loved heroism, in all its forms, the sword fights and duels to the death, sometimes atop a dizzying ravine. He sometimes pretended to be one of the characters, gripping his twig like a wand and reciting a spell summoning fire. Credence would play outside when he was allowed and point and shout with his twig held high, running himself ragged under the summer heat, sure he had imagined the current running up his arm and sending ripples over his skin, the shimmer in the air when he’d shouted <em>Confringo! </em>The sun beat down on him like a hot cap, making the ground rise with waves of red dust. Still, he knew, it was nothing more than the heat.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Afterwards, Credence doesn’t remember much of the first weeks. He doesn’t do anything new, or go anywhere; nothing changes a speck. He has lessons after breakfast, takes short naps after lunch, and then has lessons again in the afternoon, in preparation for Ilvermorny though Credence tries not to think about it with a sense of impending doom. He reads when he can, plays when he can, talks to the house-elves and the servants who give him short, clipped responses, as if he were somehow slow, or stupid, or that his stay at the manor was a simply temporary affair and they’d be rid of him soon. He writes Carlotta a letter, but doesn’t know whom to ask so he could send it to the Orphanage by owlpost, which he understands is like regular post only wizards use owls instead of employing postmen. He thinks about his Church, about his mother, his sisters, sweet as cream, tucked in their beds. He wonders if Chastity and Modesty died screaming or asleep.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">In July, shortly before Credence is due to receive his Ilvermorny letter, he is rousted from his nap in the library by a sound in the hallway. He slinks to the door, opening it just a crack, rubbing sleep from his crusty eyes. The servants are lugging a number of heavy-looking trunks up the staircase. Mr Pinkton, the footman, is giving the Tully a long list of meals to serve for tonight’s dinner to which she eagerly bobs her head. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Later, Credence will understand what the commotion is about as he’s demoted to taking his dinner in his room, a tray of soup, baked potatoes and soft lamb, and a slice of rhubarb pie still warm from the oven. He’ll sneak out even when he isn’t meant to, tiptoeing down the staircase and pushing his face between the balustrades to eavesdrop on Mr Graves’ conversation with his guest. It’s rude, <em>but</em>. But nothing. Credence has always been a stubborn child. Ma had always said so. He knew, in his heart of hearts, that she was right, just like she had been right about his crookedness. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">They speak in hushed tones, the timbre of their voices almost similar, like music, though the stranger’s voice is tinged with a smoker’s rasp. The dinner guest sits with his back to Credence so Credence can only see his head, its neat sideways part, the sides shaved clean, flecked here and there with silver. And his hand, attached to a long arm covered in a grey sleeve, tapping an impatient rhythm on the tabletop, the pinky glinting with a signet ring. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“All this for me?” says the guest, with an obvious scoff. He grasps his wine with the same hand and then takes a long luxurious pull. “Ulfius, you shouldn’t have.”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Mr Graves’ expression doesn’t change even as he spears food on his plate and pushes it into his mouth, pulling the tines free in one swift motion. This action, Credence recognises, only because it’s always made him nervous to be the recipient of such a look. He wonders how the man hasn’t shrunk yet, or recoiled in fear, or run out the door with his tail between his legs. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Only the best for my favourite brother, of course.”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“I’ve heard news,” says the guest abruptly.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Oh?” says My Ulfius, his eyebrow raised. “You mean the boy?”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“You know you’re only shooting yourself in the foot.”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Mr Graves hums. “There could be some truth in that, but there’s no need to sound maudlin. The boy needed a home. And this house is deserving of the laughter of a child. It’s been years since there were little miscreants running about. Gareth used to—”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“This is no place to raise a child,” the man interrupts. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“And yet it worked well enough for the three of us,” Mr Ulfius says, giving the man — Percival, his brother — a look. “And look at us now.” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">The man doesn’t speak for a moment. And then finally, after a long silence, he does: “Seraphina made me feel like I was the world’s utmost idiot for not realizing you won something today.” His voice is low, as if spoken in regret. “Please accept my belated congratulations, senator.”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“The elections are a long way off, Percival, though the polls have swayed considerably in my favor in the recent months.”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Ever since —”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Percival,” Mr Graves cuts in, steepling his fingers in front of his face. He closes his eyes, as if recalling a memory, before opening them again with a steely unforgiving gaze. “Forgive me for asking, but, how’s your leg?”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">He doesn’t meet Percival, until several days later, though there are traces of him everywhere in the library and the dining hall: an unfinished cup of coffee, and a seat reserved for him at the long table, his plate empty and untouched; a grey cashmere scarf snaking around the reading couch, books taken out of their hiding places and heaped on the table in front of the fire, parchment scrolls left as if in afterthought. A square piece of cream-colored stationery with a long list of names, some scratched out: <em>Gaderian, Gellert, Gunnel, Gymir… </em></span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Percival is Ulfius’ younger brother by seven years, an Auror by trade, recently returned from war. There’s always a war to be fought, it seemed to Credence, some mysterious battle or another here or abroad that left men paralyzed and plagued with bad dreams. He imagines the wars fought by wizards to be no different from the wars fought by regular folk, <em>no-maj’s</em>, though instead of bullets, it was hexes that rent the air, and unforgivable curses that rained like falling shrapnel. War is the same wherever you go, his tutor had told him, when he’d caught Credence absorbed in a book about them, no-maj’s killing off wizards by the droves, a battle that spanned nearly a hundred years. It leaves grooves on everything it touches and no man is ever left quite the same again.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">One afternoon, Credence is woken from a light sleep by a thump from the fireplace. He opens his eyes and hears someone muttering, and lifts his head to peek over his reading chair. His view is screened by a precarious stack of books but he sees enough to make sense of what has happened: someone had just flooed into the library. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">When the man from the fireplace raises his head as he pauses brushing himself off, their eyes meet briefly and Credence looks away, hiding behind his chair, suddenly rendered shy. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">What’s striking about Percival is not his eyes, dark like the bottom of a deep well, but his lack of a resemblance to Ulfius: a strong jaw peppered by stubble, a pair of thick equally dark eyebrows, a stern mouth that knew how to smile. Percival dusts floo powder off his shoulders and crosses the room in three long strides, the hem of his robes gliding smoothly across the flagstone floor. His cologne smells expensive, cool and crisp and elegant, like the white of his dress shirt, a hint of cedar bark and citrus. He has a slight limp that Credence only notices when he catches sight of the walking stick at Percival’s side. The two buttons of his shirt are undone, his sleeves rolled to the elbows, baring bronzed forearms, his only capitulation to the heat. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Hello,” Percival says, as Credence blinks at him mutely. “You must be Credence.”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Hello,” says Credence in a small, shaking voice.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Percival watches him the way one would watch a flighty animal, equal parts pity and amusement though his gaze is not unkind. He thrusts out a hand Credence takes too long to shake, and by the time Credence reaches out, his fingers clammy with sweat, shaking with nerves, Percival has already moved away, training his gaze out the window. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“My name is Percival,” Percival says, after Credence drops his hand. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“I know who you are,” Credence tells him. He almost bites his tongue off at the slip, reddening and glancing down at his hands twined in his lap. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Has Ulfius told you about me?” Percival asks, moving to a decanter situated on the mantle, sloshing with golden brown liquid. He pours himself a glass. “I’m his brother; I don’t know if he’s ever mentioned me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Knowing him — anyway, you may call me Uncle, I suppose, though I prefer that you call me by my given name.”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Understood,” Credence says with a nod. “Mr Percival.” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“You like to read?” Percival gestures to the books scattered here and there. Credence uncoils himself from his perch in his reading chair, straightening his clothes, the scratchy wooly blanket falling from his legs to pool at his feet when he stands to his full height.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Something in Percival’s face softens, like a rope unspooling, and he bends to pick up the blanket from the ground. “This blanket,” he says, looking into Credence’s eyes for the first time, and holding his gaze. “Where is it from?”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“I found it in the bedroom.”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Whose?” Percival asks, and then his voice goes low: “Show me,” he says.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">So Credence does.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">They take the long walk down the hall, then up the stairs, through a maze of corridors, until finally, they reach Credence’s door. He pushes it open without a spell but Percival stays silent, remaining motionless. Then Credence steps inside and Percival follows.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“This was my room before it was yours,” Percival says, touching the drapes adorning the bed, knocking the back of his hand against the bed posts as if to test their strength. He leans against the wall, arms crossed, having a look around, as if he were a stranger in his own house. “You’ll take care of it, won’t you Credence? I expect as much from you.”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Credence blinks at him. “Yes, yes sir,” he says, quickly. “I promise. I will.”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Good.” Percival smiles. “Now, tell me, how are you Credence? How are you faring?”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">The question knocks Credence off guard. Adults never asked him how he was. They spoke to him, sometimes, as if he were simply part of the room’s furnishings, at him, or through him, but not one had ever asked how he felt. His Ma gave him orders while Ulfius quizzed him on how much he retained from his sessions with tutors. Sometimes, Credence suspected, adults simply liked hearing the sound of their own voice. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Credence lets the question sink through him, a blade slicing butter. He wants to cry, moved by the kindness in Percival’s gaze. When his Church had burned down, and Tina had allowed him to visit the cemetery where his Ma and sisters were buried, he did not weep. And when he left the Orphanage, and his only friend Carlotta behind, his eyes had been dry as gravel; he did not mourn their loss.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“I imagine it must be daunting, living in a big house like this, without a friend to talk to,” Percival continues, as if he can read Credence’s thoughts. “I hope the servants are treating you well. And that my brother — well, he’s a good man, all things considered. His heart is in the right place. He’ll take care of you the best he can.”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“I’m grateful for his generosity,” Credence says. He means it. Even if he is left well alone most of the time, in the company of tutors and wide empty rooms, and no one ever stops to talk to him or ask him about his day, even if the long hallways, flanked by moving paintings of sneering witches and wizards, made him lonelier than an empty house. He means it. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Aren’t we all?” Percival says with a little laugh. He taps Credence on the chin. “Look at people when they talk to you, Credence. Look them straight in the eye so they know you mean business. Just a suggestion.” He smiles again. “How old are you?”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Ten.”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“All set for Ilvermorny then.”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“If I get a letter,” Credence mumbles.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Why wouldn’t you?”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Because I’m a <em>squib</em>,” Credence says, faster than he can stop himself from saying it. He knows it’s the wrong thing to say because Percival’s face clouds over, his forehead deepening with three lines. But instead of getting angry, or slapping him on the face, or shaking him angrily by the shoulders like Ma would sometimes do, in hopes of beating the wrongness out of him, Percival simply touches his shoulder, frowns.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Now, who told you that?” he says. “Who taught you that word?”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“It means I can’t do magic.”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Not all magic has teeth,” Percival tells him, and when Credence shoots him a questioning look, he hastens to explain: “It’s a saying. It means magic can take on many forms. It’s a serious avocation. Sometimes it can take years before a person’s magic can manifest. There was a man in Sweden, who woke up and found he’d turned everything in his house upside down in his sleep. He was forty.”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“I don’t want it to take years,” Credence says, his eyes blurring. “I don’t want to wait until I’m forty. I want— I want—” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">He always wants. Credence finds himself crying. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Percival watches him for a moment, looking awkward, not knowing what to do, before he starts to kneel on the floor and cup Credence’s shoulders. His breath reeks of tobacco, ashy with a hint of sourness — persimmons, Credence thinks, like the candies the house-elves leave on the nightstand. His eyes have brown flecks in them, and gold, round as full moons. Part of his jaw is unshaven with bristles. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Credence,” Percival whispers, conjuring a handkerchief from his inner pocket and pressing it to Credence palms so he could scrub at his eyes himself, violently as if erasing a mistake. “Credence, calm down now. Wipe your tears. You’re a Graves. And Graves men do not cry even with shrapnel studding their chest. But here’s a secret: only the brave ones ever do.” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“I’m not brave,” Credence hiccups. “I’m not anything!”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“None of us are, not really, not where it counts,” Percival assures him. He taps Credence on the nose to get him to look at him. “Now here’s another secret: we’re all just very good at pretending.”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Credence sees Percival more after that: not just traces of him in the everyday rhythms of his life, like a pair of hunting boots left in the den, or a black umbrella leaning against the wall in the foyer, but at the table for breakfast, paging through <em>The New York Ghost</em> and spooning sugar into his coffee, wearing a dressing gown with a dark swirling design. He runs, sometimes, in the morning, a short circuit around the grounds to ease the pain in his leg which he says might never heal. The bones had mended terribly, after it had been crushed several times and made to grow again with an illegal draught he had procured that had more alcohol than healing properties. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">When Credence asks him how he had hurt his leg, Percival smiles blandly and changes the subject. Percival asks him about his books, which ones are his favourite, and which he only reads to appease Ulfius. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“There is this one,” Credence confesses shyly, one afternoon when they take their tea in the library, the sun setting outside and casting a syrupy warm glaze over the room. He shows Percival the tattered remains of the cover: <em>The Adventures of Rufus Morrowblade</em>, and Percival, he laughs and laughs, spilling tea all over the carpet. He waves a hand and with a flick of the wrist, the tea stains disappear, the carpet good as new. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Credence,” he says, looking aghast as he faces him. “You have terrible taste. There are other books, better books in this library and you pick Rufus Morrowblade. My boy,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>that’s a load of —” but he sees the betrayed expression in Credence’s face, the abject humiliation, the red ears, bright as tomatoes, so he stops and finishes his tea. “Very well,” he says, as if coming upon a decision. “What about spell books? Have you read any?”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Credence blushes. He hesitates, and nods once. When he doesn’t speak, Percival prompts him. There’s nothing worse than being silent. And Graves men, said Percival, must always distinguish themselves from mice and speak. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“But I’m not very good at spells, and I can’t do any magic,” Credence tells him. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Have you ever tried?”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Yes,” Credence says. <em>Of course I have</em>, he doesn’t say. <em>And I’ve failed countless times and hurt myself</em>. He grips his knee until his knuckles are white-tipped. His tutors have tried too. Nothing seemed to work. No amount of patience could undo the truth. “I’m a <em>squib</em>,” he says, feeling miserable all over again. There, he’s gone and said it.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“You aren’t,” Percival assures him. “Ulfius told me about — your mother. The one from the Church—”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Credence flinches.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“—How she tried to stun your magic. We’re going to undo that. We’re going to coax the magic out of you.”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“What if it doesn’t work?”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Well,” Percival says. “You can’t blame a man for trying.” He smiles at the expression on Credence’s face. “Cheer up, Credence. A frown doesn’t become a Graves, you know.”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“But Ulfius does it quite a lot,” Credence whispers secretively. They share a look, Credence’s furtive, his head bowed, and Percival’s smile deepens as he musses Credence’s hair. Credence almost ducks out of the way, shy all over again, but he steels himself and lets Percival’s hand brush his hair. He’s never been touched like this before, boxed on the ears, or cuffed, slapped after saying a bad word, his hands struck after being caught drawing on the back of pews with a piece of chalk, but never handled with such offhand gentleness as if he deserved nothing less. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Does he,” Percival wonders a loud. “Well, perhaps Ulfius can be an exception.” He laughs as he drops his hand. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">*</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">And so begins their training: Percival, on indefinite leave, spends an hour each day teaching Credence spells. They don’t use books, they leave the heavy tomes in the library to gather dust, preferring instead to stand like duelists under the glare of the hot summer sun. Percival tells him to picture a light, shining bright within him, round as an egg and glowing like the moon, and when that doesn’t work, kneels on the grass and clutches Credence’s shoulders to search his face. “Have you ever gotten angry, Credence? At least once in your life?”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Credence shakes his head. A lie, because there had been times when rage had swallowed him down like a wide angry maw. But anger, he knows, is a sin, so he keeps that part of him to himself. He looks at Percival, feeling bad for disappointing him, for lying to his face. “I can try,” he says, curling his fists closed. “I’ll do my best.”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Try? <em>Getting angry?</em>” Percival looks at him oddly. “We all have our calling, but ah, perhaps spellwork is not for you.” He stands to his feet, grass staining the knees of his trousers,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>his hands planted on his hips. He has foregone his robes in this kind of weather. He stands there now in a white buttoned shirt opened at the throat, a black cotton vest that cinched his trim waist. He pockets his wand, motions for Credence to follow him, walking haltingly with his cane to support him every step of the way. “Potions,” he says, over his shoulder as Credence trips over rocks and his own feet. “What do you know about Potions?”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">There is a greenhouse, at the very edge of the property, up a steep hill, forlorn and forsaken, with boarded up windows showing toothy gaps, and a door charmed perpetually shut. Percival mends the broken glass with magic, but the rest of the detritus he clears out by hand, wanting, he says, more than needing, the exercise. He enlists Credence’s help, filling boxes with bits of broken crockery, pieces of old carpet, water-spotted books with half the pages missing, someone’s discarded yellow boot. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">The greenhouse had gone derelict with neglect, the vegetable plot in needing of repair, paint peeling away in places and revealing cracked gray plaster. Tiles from the roof had fallen and now littered an overgrown path choked with weeds. But after days of mending and righting, and with a bit of Madame Sally’s Spit Shine, they had restored the greenhouse — together — to its former glory, or at least made it habitable again. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Credence presses his nose the glass to peer through the murk. It’s dark inside, still, but he can hear the distant sound of water dripping. He presses his ear to the newly restored window, caked in a thin layer of soot and dust, and listens. His heart hums inside his chest. He breathes and the smell of freshly turned earth fills his mouth. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Percival furnishes the greenhouse with sitting chairs, with comfortable rugs, with a tea table he says he’d filched straight from the manor. A shelf of books with heavy tomes filled with pages upon pages of potions, detailed instructions on how to tell lavender from sage, hysop from mulberry.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Lavender cured sleeplessness, while wintergreen sped healing; rowan twigs supposedly kept away evil spirits, the white sap from milkweed extracted to cure warts. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Plants have certain kinds of properties,” Percival said, licking a thumb and paging through a particularly thick book. “And leeches. There’s always leeches. You can learn a lot if you keep an open mind. ”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Credence’s ignorance of anything to do with potions amused Percival in turns. He told him of his childhood — clearing the scarred oak table to clutter it with pewter cauldrons, and flasks of various shapes and sizes which he later filled with frothing liquid — how he’d grown up with his brothers, Ulfius and Gareth, fitfully but without incident, he as the middle child, the three of them attending Ilvermorny one after the other, and sorted into different houses: Horned Serpent, Wampus, Thunderbird. There was a fourth house, Pukwudgie, but the Graves boys only numbered three. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">It was difficult for Credence to imagine that Percival had ever been small or awkward, or a boy, just like him. He was a man so certain of his place in the universe, wide in the shoulders, surefooted and brisk, with such kind steady hands that Credence could imagine him coming to life as nothing less than, coaxed out of firmament. Percival told stories the way hymns were sung in church, deep-voiced with gravity, a king holding holding court, and it made you stop and it made you listen. And it made Credence’s breath crackle like a juddering gramophone inside his chest as he clung to his every word like a man thrown a rope over a dark ravine. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Percival began: he told him about the ghosts that sometimes prowled the halls of the manor, how, as a child, he had wanted his own dragon and had thrown a fit when his family had to cancel a trip to Bulgaria. In the summer, he and his brothers picked fruit from the orchard, and made homemade jam from the windfalls, storing them in glass jars to sell at the fair before the start of term; they tried their hand at making wine from beetroot, from raspberries, ginger, and elderflower, pans of fruit boiling on the stove, hosiery hanging on a clothesline for straining, sieves and funnels laid out in neat rows on the table, ready for use, the greenhouse smelling like a distillery. Their father had not been happy when he found out what they’d been up to all summer. It was probably why, Percival said later, they were all drinking men. The love of a good spirit came early. He could not sleep without a nightcap, a thimble of warm gin to cut his meals.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">One morning, Percival apparates into the greenhouse carrying a heavy book in a burlap bag. He hefts it onto the table and Credence crowds around it, reading the gilded lettering on its worn spine: <em>A Bestiary of Plant Eaters.</em></span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Carefully avoiding its gentle tears, Credence thumbs through the rotting pages. He lets out a startled yelp as the book gives a shuddery purr before snapping shut without warning and narrowly avoiding his finger.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1"> “Your book,” he gasps. “It’s… it’s alive!”</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">“Yes, well,” Percival says, scratching his jaw. “It has the tendency to bite, at times. Are you all right? Not hurt, are you?”</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Credence shakes his head. It seems like an innocuous enough question, but it still makes him shy when Percival asks about his well-being. At breakfast, he smiles over his newspaper and asks if Credence had a good sleep, if he liked his eggs, which tutor he was expecting on a given day.</span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">“I’m all right,” he says, then straightens up when Percival pulls out his wand. He taps the cauldron, once, twice, and the tinder below it sizzles to life, Credence jumping back in surprise and unable to hold back a gasp. He flushes, when he catches Percival looking at him curiously, wand still poised in the air. </span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">“Good,” Percival intones with a warm smile, reaching out to pat him on the head. Credence hunches his shoulders, turning even redder. </span>
</p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">“Now, Credence, let’s begin.”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Potions, Percival says, required the right conditions to work. Some draughts had to be brewed on a particular time of the month, under a particular set of circumstances, like a full moon or the start of winter solstice, otherwise they lost their potency. Ingredients had to be measured precisely, not haphazardly thrown into a cauldron. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">What separated wizards and no-maj’s was a wizards’s uncanny ability to imbue a potion with magical properties. A no-maj, following a potions book would do no more harm than a child attempting to cook for the first time, and most potions besides required a magical ingredient or two besides, difficult to procure by any means by anyone other than a witch or wizard: mandrake hair, for example, or lacewing flies, flobberworm mucus. No-maj’s had no access to any of these, and Credence wanted to say he didn’t, either, having lived most of his life ordinary and un-special. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Percival, a patient teacher, buys him a potions kit which consists of a cauldron and various measuring implements, funnels and phials and empty corked vials to store his concoctions in. He encourages Credence to try his hand at simple potions like invigorating draughts and elixirs that restored strength, setting safety charms on the corners of the greenhouse so he doesn’t put himself at risk. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">The first lesson has Credence brewing a Sleeping Draught. They test it on Percival who has a flask at hand to undo the effects in case — Credence shakes his head. His Sleeping Draught doesn’t work on Percival even after the fourth try, the fifth. After that, he just wants to cry in frustration, shout, even as Percival puts a hand on his shoulder and tells him, “Again.”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Again, again. Again. On the twelfth attempt, Credence barely talks at all, grinding ingredients and keeping his face blank as a mask even though his heart beat painfully like a hammer inside his ribs. He prays, under his breath, even though it’s been a long while since he’s done that and wonders if God can hear his voice. He pours the draught into a glass vial after it steeps, then presents it to Percival who gives it a whiff. The potion had turned the correct mauve color but even appearances could be deceiving. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Percival nods at him and uncapping the vial, downs the potion in one gulp. Credence blinks up at him, his breath bated, his hands clammy as he curls them tightly at his sides. Percival’s expression doesn’t change, a smooth mask that’s imperturbable as a wall, as he sets the vial clumsily on the table so that it rolls across the surface and topples on the ground, touching Credence’s shoe.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Percival looks at Credence, then pitches forward, before slumping on the ground. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Credence’s scrambles to check his breathing, kneeling next to him where his limp body lies supine on the ground, limbs askew. “Mr Percival!” he shouts. “Mr Percival, are you all right? Please, please, please be alive, please—” He presses his head against Percival’s chest, ear to his heart, and nearly cries in relief when he hears the telltale thrum of it in his ribs, beating a slow steady rhythm. Then Percival starts to snore and Credence crows in triumph, slapping a hand over his mouth to stifle his sound of glee. He giggles to himself, unable to help the grin stretching his face. It hurts, sometimes, to smile so wide, to laugh. It’s not something he’s used to doing, but Percival can coax it out of him so easily with a well-timed joke at his own expense, or a look. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">It rains, a little, as Credence waits for the effects of the sleeping draught to wear off, a drizzle that makes the casement windows shake and sends the pots and pans hanging from a hook by the door clattering. Credence watches Percival sleep, crawling over to him and biting his lip as he pokes him on the cheek, startling when his fingertip scrapes against the rough bristle of Percival’s unshaved jaw. He’s handsome, objectively speaking. Credence knows that some of the servants watch him like a hawk, with admiration in their eyes, sometimes envy. He wants to grow up to become just like Percival, a man so full of mystery: strong, clever, and kind. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">He fetches the divan from the ottoman and throws it over Percival. It’s too small but it will have to do. Credence pulls his legs up to his chest and wraps his arms around his knees, and listens to Percival’s snoring, afraid to touch him again, or wake him. He’ll simply have to wait until the draught wears off, Credence thinks as he closes his eyes. Eventually, he falls asleep and wakes up with his head resting against Percival’s leg.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Percival is sitting up, his eyes still blurred with sleep, a fist pressed to his mouth as he fights back a yawn. His other hand he rests on Credence’s back, and Credence flinches, expecting a beating, a slap, a sharp reprimand of some kind. He relaxes incrementally when Percival’s hand simply pats him on the back before it rests there, rather absently, permeating warmth. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Credence.” Percival’s voice is soft. Credence looks at him through the dark fringe screening his eyes. “Well done, my boy. Well done.” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">*</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Percival takes him out on an excursion. “You’ll need a wand,” he says in August as they climb up the steep hill to the greenhouse, armed with boxes of Credence’s favourite books, so he could read there instead of the library, if he pleased. “School is starting soon, and you need to be ready.” He touches Credence’s shoulder again, tilts him this way and that. “And robes, you’ll need new robes. Did Ulfius not buy you new ones? These look terribly old fashioned. The sleeves have ruffles!” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“There was a tailor, once. He came and measured me for clothes,” Credence says. He feels a little bit insulted that Percival had called his robes old-fashioned as they were the only things to truly belong to him first. Everything before them had been secondhand: shoes, books, toys. Even his room had been Percival’s; there was nothing else that belonged, solely, to him. He felt protective, defensive.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“That’s it?” Percival hedges. Credence nods. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Pity,” Percival says, clicking his tongue.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Well, Ulfius has always had terrible taste. I suppose we’re going to have to get you better robes then. Lessons will have to be postponed tomorrow, I’m afraid, because we’ll need all day to make our rounds.”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Are we going somewhere?” The thought of leaving the estate, finally, after months of roaming the maze of its halls and disappearing corridors thrills Credence, and he has to stop himself from bouncing on his heels in excitement.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Yes,” Percival affirms. “This is your reward. You’ve been a most studious pupil and it’s only right that I give you a present.”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“You don’t have to, Mr Percival,” Credence says meekly, already touched by the thought alone, that Percival would want to give him anything at all. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Oh, but I insist,” Percival says. “And turning it down will be a most grievous insult. You wouldn’t want that, would you?” He raises an eyebrow, and Credence doesn’t know whether or not this is one of his jokes. With Percival, it’s often hard to tell; Credence is sometimes late to pick up on his humor and half the time misses his cue to laugh. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">After an uncomfortable silence, Credence shakes his head vigorously. “No, no,” he says, scrambling to correct himself. “No, of course not, Mr Percival. I don’t mean to insult you! I just—”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Please,” Percival smiles, patting him on the back as he leads Credence through the door of the greenhouse. “Just Percival.”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">*</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">The night before, Credence is unable to summon sleep, full of excitement for their day ahead. He’ll get Percival to himself, for more than an hour, and that’s more than he’s ever allowed. Percival disappears every now and then, flooing just in time for lessons, and then leaving soon after as if perpetually running late for an appointment, grabbing his cane and robes. From what Credence understands, though he’s on extended leave for the time being, there were still duties that needed his seeing to. Percival works for the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. A prestigious line of work, he says, often with a wink, but tedious at times, and bogged down with more paperwork than he cares to do. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Credence imagines him in an enormous office with dark mahogany furnishings, accolades lining the walls floor to ceiling and a high-backed chair quite like that one in Ulfius’ study, a secretary at his disposal and a window with the best view in the building.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">He washes his face the next morning, tired from his lack of sleep, hardly able to keep down any food as a result. Percival joins him for breakfast, having nothing more than a cup of coffee, and pilfered copy of <em>The New York Ghost</em> announcing that the <em>Manchester Magpies</em> had beat the <em>New York Nightmarchers</em> 3-1. Later he asks him if he’s ever apparated before. “Not even side-along?” Percival asks, bewildered, when Credence tells him the truth, that he’s never been anywhere but the Orphanage, the train station, the estate, no other place warranting apparition. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Percival straightens and then nods his head, before seeming to come upon a decision. Another trait Credence admires: Percival’s certainty, how easy it is for him to move from one situation to the next, completely unruffled. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“You can just wrap your arms around me, I suppose. There — just so— not too tight — and then we can— comfortable? Right, then. Make sure to keep your eyes closed; sometimes that helps. You can think a happy thought too, if you want; it can get quite uncomfortable if it’s your first time.” He smiles down at Credence who weakens and buries his face inside Percival’s robes, his ears flaming red as he gets a noseful of lemon-scented cologne. His arms are curled around Percival’s waist, flung tight. The scratchy cotton of Percival’s vest rubs his cheek. He’s read enough about apparition to know it isn’t always successful. Wizards and witches have been known to splich themselves, or die. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Credence holds his breath. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Ready?” Percival asks. When Credence nods, he pats him once on the head. “There’s no need to fear, Credence. I’ll be with you every step of the way.” He chuckles when Credence nods again, then readies his stance, one arm wrapped around Credence’s shoulder, cradling his back. “Whatever happens, dear boy, you must promise to never let go.”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Credence doesn’t think he can, even if he were forcibly pried from Percival’s side. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">*</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Here we are,” Percival says, the second the world stops moving, Credence’s hands fisting his robes. It had happened in the space of a minute, his insides upending themselves, the breath punched out of his lungs, pressure behind his eyes, inside his skull. It felt like he was being pulled in all directions. He’s never apparating again, if he can help it. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“You can open your eyes now, Credence,” Percival says. His voice sounds like it’s coming from far away. When Credence peels his eyes open, Percival hands him a sweet — a sherbet lemon — wrapped in glittering foil. It’s supposed to help with the dizziness. He chews on it obediently and shivers at the tartness that bursts inside his mouth.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">He has to screw his mouth shut the whole time to keep himself from gaping. The noise of the street is almost jarring: hawkers selling everything from used cauldrons to rolls of parchment, to spellbooks and jars filled with murky unnamable things. Storefronts gleamed and glistened, their best wares on display. Credence counts the shops they walk past, losing track after twelve, though he remembers those that catch his attention fleetingly — an apothecary, a shop that sold owls, another that displayed a variety of broomsticks with a poster of the <em>Harlem Herons</em> pasted on the window. At the end of the zigzagging street stood a teetering three-story bookstore with an owl perched comfortably on the awning. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Credence stops. The owl glances down at him and hoots. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Come along, Credence,” Percival says, holding out his hand as he stops in the middle of the street. “We mustn’t dawdle.”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Credence hurries after him and grabs his hand.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">*</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">They shop, first, for a wand. Credence is, needless to say, terrified for a number of different reasons. What if it doesn’t take? What if he disappoints himself, or worse yet, Percival for hoping? Then this excursion would have been a waste. The past month — all a waste. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">The wandmaker is a kind portly man with a wiry mustache and watery blue eyes. His shop is bigger on the inside, a battered wooden counter scarred from years of use, a long hunter-green sofa where patrons could sit while they waited their turn. Behind the counter, a shelf filled with various bric-a-brac, pots of quills and a ticking metronome, framed clippings of the shop being features in various newspapers across the world. He introduces himself as Theodore Brayles III. The shop outside had a brass plate, Credence remembers: Brayles &amp; Sons <em>est 1805</em>. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Percival had made a last minute appointment the day previous so they had the shop to themselves for the better part of an hour. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">When Percival shuts the door behind him, the bell above it tinkles in greeting and the man’s eyes light up knowingly. “There you are, Percival Graves,” he says with a light laugh. “I was wondering where you were. You’re late!”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Percival simply grunts. “This is my — <em>charge</em>. My nephew.” He pauses. “Credence.” He doesn’t apologize. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Brayles peers down at Credence over his counter, adjusting his half-moon spectacles. “I’ve heard all about him. Ulfius’ then, I assume?”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Percival nods, and pats Credence on the shoulder. He’s clipping his words. “He’s due to start Ilvermorny in the fall. He’ll need a wand.”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Well then, I’d be happy to help your nephew here with a wand,” says Theodore Brayles, winking at Credence and then at Percival who huffs and makes himself comfortable in one of the waiting chairs by the window. Credence is ushered to the back room, and the last he sees of Percival is of him conjuring a newspaper out of thin air, and an apprentice — no older than Credence — approaching him with a tea tray filled with cakes.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Wands can be sly, slippery things,” Brayles tells Credence, rummaging through his haphazard shelves as if searching for something in particular. He taps his chin before climbing up a set of rickety stairs with the wheels wobbling just slightly to merit concern. “It’s all about compatibility, you know. Making sure everything fits, and meshes. You must remember, Credence, that it is the wand that chooses the master, and not the other way around.” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Credence has no idea what he’s talking about. Brayles sets down a number of boxes on a round table in the middle of a room, running his fingers through a few of them before handing one over to Credence — no wider than a pencil case, and at least the length of a ruler. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Brayles take a measured step back. “The room is charmed so you don’t have to worry.”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1"><em>But what does that mean,</em> Credence thinks, unwrapping the box, and staring at the velvet lining pillowing a sleek mahogany wand. He doesn’t know what to do. He’s seen Ulfius brandish his wand to stir his coffee, his tutors set the room alight with one whispered word. And Percival doesn’t even use a wand most of the time, except to light a cauldron or show Credence a trick to make him laugh.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Go on —” nudges Brayles, waving his hand emphatically. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“But I’ve never —” Credence peers over his shoulder, at the counter. Percival is absorbed in his newspaper, eating a scone, one leg crossed over the other. Sunlight from outside makes the whites in his hair shine gold. He doesn’t look up no matter how hard Credence secretly wills it. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Credence nods, determined, and has a tight swallow. “All right,” he says. He picks up the wand with shaky hands — two hands — and waves it around the room. Nothing. He tries again. Nothing. The third time, he does it with so much force he actually lets out a frustrated noise and barrels backwards against the shelves, knocking the contents askew. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Brayles gently takes the wand from him and asks him to try another. It takes them the better part of the day, during some point they break for lunch, turn the sign over at the door to “closed”, and return to the back room. Percival waits, because Brayles says choosing a wand is a private thing, and that he must stay put, no matter what, o<em>ut, out Mr Graves!</em> waving him out the room the second he steps in to check up on Credence. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">When all is said and done, Brayles mops sweat off his forehead with a tartan kerchief. He reaches under his desk, rifling through the contents of a drawer. “My father made this, years ago,” he says, pulling out a slender box covered in dust, the corners pinched and beaten. “Perhaps we should give it a try. Otherwise I’ll write you a recommendation to Theodore Trubody. He’s a friend of mine, also in the same line of business, makes very sturdy wands. Credence, if you please?” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Credence takes the wand from him, feeling its solid heft in his right hand. He’s tired, and his arm hurts in the beginnings of a cramp. He sighs and lifts the wand to inspect its make though he’s not overly familiar with wands enough to determine what this one is hewn from. Birch, Acacia, Elder, Hornbeam. It all looked the same to him, even as Brayles had walked him through each of their properties, explaining cores compatible to each.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">This one however, this feels right, somehow, light enough that it follows the movement of his wrist when he cuts it through the air.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Credence closes his eyes, and gives it a slight wave. One, two, <em>three</em>, he counts, and suddenly thinks of Percival, there outside on the sofa, with his hands steepled in his lap as he waited patiently — and then, there it is, trembling out of his hand, a burst of light shooting out from the tip of the wand, sending boxes on the shelf toppling on the floor and Brayles scurrying out of the way to avoid impact. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Credence!” Percival barks, bursting through the door. “Credence are you —”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Credence looks at Percival, his mouth hanging agape. His heart is thrumming, and his skin feels thin, like the slightest touch would undo him. He wants to, of all things, cry, and he’s not certain whether it’s from joy or utter fright. His hand is still shaking when Percival takes the wand from him, kneeling to embrace him, to cup his face and get him to look at him. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Are you all right, Credence?”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Credence doesn’t know.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He trembles and lets himself fall forward into Percival’s arms, sobbing uncontrollably, the last vestiges of composure leaving him. He’s a wizard, he thinks. <em>He has magic.</em> He was not a squib. He will not be taken away and sent back to the Orphanage. In September, he’ll get his Ilvermorny letter, and Ulfius — Percival — will clap him on the back and be proud of him.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Rowan with a phoenix feather core,” says Brayles, righting himself from where he’s slumped in the corner, his glasses knocked off his face, now crooked. They both turn to look at him, wiping a speck off his glasses with a corner of his robe. “What an excellent match!” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">*</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">It’s late when they leave the shop, a silver moon rising, just enough to cast shadows. Percival takes him to a restaurant at the end of the street, housed by a very tall building with a gilded front and a pair of revolving glass doors. The decor is expensive, the inside like a fortune teller’s booth, decked in red drapes and comfortable lounge chairs. The menu is brought to them by a house-elf who stands waiting patiently by their table for their order.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Are you mad?” Credence asks, after Percival has ordered for them both, tonight’s house special with a goblet of the best wine for him, fizzy water for Credence with a drop of lemon. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Percival looks up from smoothing a napkin over his lap. “No,” he says quizzically. His eyebrows knit together. “Why would I be?” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Because you had to pay for everything I broke in the shop,” Credence says in a small voice. It’s true — several wands had splintered in the kerfuffle, and the impact had left a sizeable crater on the floor. He’s seen Percival hand a pouch over to Brayles, heavy with gold coins, apologizing for the mishap while Brayles insisted that no, no it was just one of the many hazards of the job, and he hasn’t been very thorough about fortifying his safety charms as of late, signs of his age, he’d joked.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Credence holds out his hands. He’s had his knuckles slapped with a hickory stick during lessons, and his Ma would beat his hands with a belt if she thought he didn’t say his psalms before supper. He’s used to pain. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“I’m sorry, Mr Percival,” Credence says, ready for — for anything. But Percival just looks at him, then his palms, a frown marring his handsome face.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Credence,” Percival says. Credence always warms at the delicate way Percival shapes his name. “<em>What on earth </em>— do you expect me to punish you? What happened to your hands? Who did this?”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Credence clenches his fists shut. He remembers Carlotta, how she’d warned him never to show anyone his scars. But he wasn’t thinking, isn’t thinking. He pockets his hands and nearly jumps out of his skin when Percival clasps his shoulder. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“I’m sorry, Mr Percival,” he says again. But he won’t look at Percival. He can’t stand his pity. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“For what?” Percival asks. “Credence, you’ve been delightful. Now, let me see your hands. Please.” He waits, his hand on the back of Credence’s neck, his face an unreadable mask. He waits.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Finally, Credence shows him, uncurling his fists so Percival can trace a finger over the ridges of his scars. They disappear under his touch with a faint tickle, like they’ve never been there at all, and Credence, he looks up at Percival and shivers. He’s read about miracles, acts God performed to demonstrate his power, Lazaraus rising from the Grave and jars of oil and flour kept full during a winter famine, water rising high enough to flood a city down, and yet — he’s moved by this simple act, struck by wonder and awe.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“If anyone ever hurts you again, Credence, they’ll answer to me, understand?” Percival says. “Did Ulfius—?”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“My Ma,” Credence confesses, interrupting him. “But only if I’ve been bad.”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“I can scarcely imagine you ever being bad,” Percival says, like he’s never been so sure of anything else. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“It’s true,” Credence protests, because he knows that it is, that sometimes there are some truths he can never outrun no matter how changed his circumstances are. “I’m stubborn, dull; no one is ever going to love a <em>freak</em> like me.”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Did she tell you that?” Percival says, sounding horrified. “Because what I see in front of me is a remarkable young man who’s clever and kind.” He squeezes Credence’s shoulder meaningfully. “You’ll make a great wizard someday, Credence. Mark my words.”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Credence believes him.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">They wait for his Ilvermorny letter. His tutors — even Ulfius, returned from the myriad galas and dinner parties he’s forced to attend as part of his campaign, waiting tensely for Credence’s letter to arrive, pacing his study with a drink in hand; his tutors avidly watching the window every morning. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">It arrives almost without fanfare on a Friday, delivered by a horned owl flying in through the open window, dropping the letter into Percival’s soup, Percival catching it in time with hardly a blink. Credence, of course, doesn’t see the letter at first, immersed in a book Percival has allowed him to take with him to the table; he doesn’t see Percival running his thumb over the wax seal before pocketing the letter in his robe. What he does sees is Percival feeding the owl table scraps from his hand, patting it gently on the head before sending it on its way, turning his attention back to the newspaper in his lap.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Later after their potions lessons in the greenhouse, Percival says they ought to go fishing. There’s a lake at the foot of the hill, two boats moored on the dock, covered in a canvas blanket smelling of mildew. The late afternoon sun slants through the trees that rim the perimeter of the lake, tracing shadows over the red dust of the ground. Even later still, the skies will boil over with rain to make amends, but for now there is this: a pervasive heat so oppressive it makes leaves curl. Sweat beads Percival’s upper lip. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Percival starts rowing until the dock is just a tiny speck in the distance, and then hands Credence a fishing rod which he almost drops in the water with clumsy hands. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“My father used to take me and my brothers fishing,” he tells Credence, his eyes fixed on the unmoving waters, shining under the summer sun like coins. The deeper you go, Credence thinks, the faster you sink, the easier it is to drown. He tries not to move so much lest the boat tips over.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Because it’s hot, they doff their robes, leaving them folded in a heap in a corner, collars unbuttoned, their sleeves hanging loose. For an hour they just sit there, not saying anything, waiting for fish to grab hold of their bait, but nothing of the sort happens and soon, Credence nods forward and almost falls asleep.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">He starts to dream. When he wakes, he remembers very little: a rope hanging over a tree, him running through the street rough with stones, his hands bleeding, staining his clothes. He comes to with a start, and finds Percival lounging on his back, a book propped open across his chest. His eyes are half-closed, like he too, is about to succumb to ennui. He’s given up all pretenses, and now their fishing rods hover in the hair, suspended by magic. He peers at Credence over his book, no bigger than a hand, a curl of hair out of its neat coif, suspended between his brows like a comma.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“I have a confession to make, Credence,” he says, sitting up easily. “I’m afraid I may have hidden something from you.” He reaches for his robes, digging through the inner pockets and then taking out an envelope, the corners creased beyond mending. He offers it to Credence who takes it with a bleary blink before giving Percival a questioning look. When Credence turns the envelope over in his hands and sees the glossy navy wax seal, his heart skips a beat and he wastes no time tearing it, reading the welcome letter greedily with trembling hands. The ink still smells fresh and smudges his fingertips. The paper feels weightless in his hands, like it’s made of air. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Dear Mister —” he looks up at Percival, blushing, eyes heavy with unshed tears. “<em>Graves</em>,” he says, choking on a lump lodged inside his throat like a stone. “They called me a <em>Graves</em>.”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“You’re nothing less than,” Percival tells him, watching him carefully, arms hanging loosely over his knees, body hunched. “Go on, then. Read the rest.”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Credence does, his voice quavering. Afterwards, he tucks the letter back into the envelope and folds it inside his pocket. He tries to calm himself, steady breaths out and in, but even his bones are shaking, his heart so full inside his ribs that he forgets to breathe. In his excitement, he forgets himself, and pitches forward to hug Percival. Tight, like he’s never dared, his face buried in the folds of his shirt as he gets a noseful of sweat-laced collar. Sour with a hint of persimmons, the bitter heady scent of tobacco.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">The boat rocks in warning, yawing from side to side, but Percival holds him steady, and smooths a hand down his hair, his fingers sliding through Credence’s lanky curls which have grown unkept, past his ears and beyond his chin.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“I’ll make you proud,” Credence says, nodding eagerly, tightening his grip. “I promise. I’ll make you so proud.”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Percival laughs, patting him on the back. “You already, do, Credence. You make me — all of us very proud.”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">*</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">A week before he is set to leave for Ilvermorny, Ulfius throws him a party, inviting everyone he knows including their children. Some of them are Credence’s age, <em>purebloods</em>, from the looks of them, a word he’s heard thrown about constantly by Ulfius, meaning born of a witch and a wizard. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">The children, like him, are set to attend Ilvermorny in September, the offsprings of wealthy witches and wizards form upstate. Credence doesn’t approach them, completely terrified of their easy camaraderie, their decadent clothing, the way they seemed to travel in a tight flock like sharp-beaked birds.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Still — it’s a wonderful party, only because it’s Credence’s first and Ulfius introduces him to the many guests as his — <em>adopted</em> — son. He imagines this is what it must feel like to have a birthday celebration thrown in his honor, Ulfius’ hand heavy on his shoulder as he steers him from one group of guests to another, asserting his presence in every conversation, pressing his hand against Credence’s back. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">There’s cake, and pie, and a tall tiered fountain frothing with chocolate milk, but Credence hides behind the drapery, watching their guests mill about in the ballroom the second Ulfius turns his back. He sneaks out to the terrace where he finds Percival speaking to someone in low hushed tones. They’re smoking, it’s the first time Credence has seen Percival smoke, brandishing a long black pipe which he holds elegantly between the fingers of his right hand. The smoke smells like persimmons, the same scent Credence recognizes on all of Percival’s clothes, bitter but familiar. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“He wants to run for president,” Percival is saying when Credence stumbles into their conversation. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Merlin knows that’s the last thing the country needs,” snorts Percival’s friend. He speaks with an accent. He’s almost as tall as Graves, with a riot of curly brown hair, and when he turns slightly in Credence’s direction, a smattering of freckles across his nose. Handsome too but in an awkward boyish way, less refined than Percival. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">They both when they hear Credence at the door, and Percival stops speaking altogether when he sees Credence peeping, narrowing his eyes speculatively. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Theseus,” he says, finally, and then motions for Credence to reveal himself and stop hiding in the shadows. “I’d like you to meet my — my nephew, Credence.”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Credence,” Theseus repeats, sounding completely flummoxed for a moment. Then he grins, setting his pipe aside and grabbing Credence’s hand to shake, clasping it in both hands. His eyes are alight with excitement. “I’ve heard so much about you! Starting school, yes? Ilvermorny?” He winks and whispers, with feigned solemnity, “It’s a pity you aren’t English, because then you’d be attending Hogwarts, only the best wizarding school in the world.”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Percival lets out a huff of annoyance. “Don’t listen to him, Credence. He’s addled with drink.”</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Now, now, Percival, we both know which school produces more Aurors.” </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">They lapse into a friendly argument, and Credence feels suddenly left out, the same way he used to feel when adults talked around him. A part of him feels a stab of, of <em>jealousy</em>, his mind supplies, but he tamps it down and waits for Percival to take notice of him, to pay attention to his new dress robes, tailor-made for tonight’s occasion, silver buttons at the sleeves and throat.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">But he’s laughing, and shaking his head, blowing rings of smoke into the night air as Theseus recites a long list of Hogwarts alumni some of whom have joined the International Quidditch Federation, he says. And not once does Percival ever glance Credence’s way. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Credence clears his throat and lingers, haltingly, in the doorway.</span>
