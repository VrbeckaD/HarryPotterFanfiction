    <p> </p><p>“You’re sure?” Tom walks slowly through the living room and gazes at the fireplace. The traditional protective runes are carved into the brick mantle, flecked with real gold. He can’t quite contain his excitement. A true traditional wizard’s home. He can’t believe it’s in his price range. What luck!</p><p>”Yes, I double-checked the asking price,” confirms his realtor. “Perhaps more investigation is in order?” He looks uneasily at the same fireplace Tom was just admiring.</p><p>”If we delay our offer, we’ll miss our opportunity.” Tom already owns a very sophisticated leather chesterfield sofa that will fit nicely in the den, he thinks, trailing his fingers along the textured wallpaper as he wanders into the next room.</p><p>”But there must be a reason for the low price,” protests the realtor.</p><p>”Wouldn’t all that be part of the seller’s guarantee?” Tom absently lists the mandatory disclosures from the form his realtor showed him with the ease of a photographic memory: <em>some seepage in northeast corner of cellar; signs of disease in the oak tree adjacent to the carriage house; attic storm windows need replacement; evidence of one (1) poltergeist house-wide, rated B- (benevolent/leaning negative).</em></p><p><em>“</em>Perhaps the seepage is worse than they let on. You can’t underestimate the seriousness of foundation problems.”</p><p>Tom leans against the windowsill and studies the garden, still tidy but with most of the plants fading toward dormancy. It’s almost fall, his favorite time of year. He recognizes a few of the feeble, snaking vines as formerly magical. Everywhere are signs that the house is one of the rare ones that is worthy of Tom. ”No,” he tells the realtor shortly. “I want it. Make it happen.”</p><p align="center">***</p><p>The day of closing, the seller meets Tom to deliver the keys. He is a portly middle-aged man with thinning hair and emits a strangled cry when he comes up beside Tom and the body that Tom has been studying with unmasked curiosity.</p><p>”What—on earth—?“ the seller exclaims.</p><p>The body is stretched on its side. Its clothing is ragged. It’s well into decay and the smell is powerful. It was a woman in life, Tom thinks, noting the delicate bone structure of the face, literally visible where skin and muscle and tissue have desiccated and split.</p><p>”Well, congratulations,” the seller mutters awkwardly. After all, it’s terribly impolite to criticize a magical descendant’s culture. Tom should be frustrated that he’s been outted in this political climate. But instead, he’s absorbed by wondering who could have known his secret and also gone to all the trouble of exhuming a body for him on such a special occasion, his first day in the new house.</p><p>Tom feels — it’s strange, like being strangled around the heart, but he supposed it’s what other would call — touched.</p><p align="center">***</p><p align="left">Tom determines the wall paper is unoriginal and strips it. Beneath is delicate plaster hand-painted with glittering patterns that make Tom’s heart clench with excited delight. </p><p align="left">He shampoos the rugs until they’re bright again. He finds crates of original objects in the attic and stacks of original furniture, which he polishes to a muted gleam so he can display them around the house. </p><p align="left">He’s still working at the bank and putting in long days, but the house is a delight to him. He daydreams of what he wants to do or change then comes home energized to follow through. </p><p align="left">Everything is in order and he swears the house preens in its restored condition.</p><p align="left">With the last of his savings he has the foundation inspected and the attic storm windows replaced. The worst the B- presence does is moan periodically, near midnight.</p>
