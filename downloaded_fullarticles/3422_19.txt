Great Britain</p><p>Professor Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore,</p><p>As reported in the last meeting of the Wizengamot and in the subsequent meeting, her are most important facts:</p><p>- increase of the study fees from 500 ₲ to 5,000 ₲ per year<br/>

Ministry of Magic, Department of Magical Education</p><p>Dumbledore read the letter for the second time, because although he knew what came he was surprised. He took off his half-moon glasses and turned the glasses iron between thumb and index finger. A low chimes resounded and took him out of his thoughts, because somebody had opened the gargoyle which guarded the stairs to his office.</p><p>He did not need to be a seer to know who came up there.<br/>
"Hello Minerva, I suppose you got a letter too." He said shortly after the door was opened.<br/>
"Are they crazy? How dare they? Do we have a gold shitting mule?" The Deputy Headmistress began and her curses becoming more and more extreme.<br/>
This was a site of Minerva McGonagall professor of transformation, Gryffindor's head of house, and deputy headmistress, which was rarely seen. Her full Scottish temperament was very rarely seen.</p><p>Dumbledore knew that Minerva, once she'd gotten into such a thing, took a long time to come back down, so he just listened to her and had to smile a bit when he heard what she wanted do  to the Ministry.<br/>
After almost ten minutes, Minerva had cooled down so much that he could have a reasonable conversation with her again.</p><p>"So, Minerva, we have no choice but to make these payments. If we could not do it, they could close the school in the worst case. Even if it does not come so far. I've seen the numbers. If everything goes well, we get out at the end of the school year with a little more than 5,000 ₲ in surplus." Voiced Albus.<br/>
"That may be us Albus, but what about the parents? How shall we tell them that they must pay 5000 for every year? What do families like the Weasley do?" Minerva asked.</p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>It was the next day around 2pm when Minerva went through the Diagon Alley towards Gringotts. Here and there she stopped to talk with people. She came at the steps of Gringotts and sighed briefly before raising her head and going up the steps. The two Goblin guards ignored her skillfully as she stepped through the main gates.<br/>
She looked for the line with the shortest waiting time and went there.</p><p>"Name?" The Goblin in front of her grunted.<br/>
"Countess Minerva McGonagall. I have an appointment with Nagnok at 15:00, because of the Hogwarts vault. I'll wait until he has time for me." Minerva replied with a firm but respectful voice.</p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>After a explaining from Minerva for Nagnok why she was here, the Goblin looked at her with a toothless smile. Outwardly, she did not let him know, because she knew what it meant to see a goblin smile. Most of those who saw a Goblin smile could not report it any more.</p><p>"Countess McGonagall, you are familiar with the Hogwarts' lease agreement?" The Goblin asked, still smiling.<br/>
"After the last case I had to deal with it. So, I read it complete. "<br/>
"Good. Then you know who owns the castle and the surrounding country?"<br/>
"Naturally. Earl Peverell is the owner, and if I am not mistaken, him also belong to the adjacent four counties."<br/>
"You are right. Earl Peverell is a major part of this region. He is only accountable to the Queen. In the treaty of 1651, the Earl of this time signed a treaty with the Ministry, when voices became louder that the ministry should have a right to co-ordinate the education of the children. This would be at the cost of the education of every student." A voice came from behind Minerva.</p><p>As she turned, she saw Ragnuk III, the head of Gringotts.<br/>
"My prince." It came from Nagnok, before he limped.<br/>
"Stand up, Nagnok. When I heard why Countess McGonagall came to us, I had to come personally. "<br/>
"Of course, my prince. It would be an honor for me if you take my place." Said Nagnok was still kneeling.<br/>
Ragnuk went around the table and sat down on the chair beside Nagnok was standing.<br/>
"Countess McGonagall, what is little known, is the four founders of Hogwarts had all differently surname. That's why the Duke has so much land. But this is for another day. Let´s return to the contract. There is a clause that says that the ministry has to pay as much as every student has to pay. These fees are set so that the food for the school year and a few other things can be paid for. If a student pays 500, now, the ministry must pay another 500. Since this is no longer true, the Duke has dissolved the contract with immediate effect." explained Ragnuk.</p><p>"Well, first we'll get robbed and now we have no money at all." There was frustration in Minervas voice.<br/>
"I did not say that Countess McGonagall. When the Treaty expires, the old rules will come into force again. Hogwarts is now getting the money from the vault provided by that Godric and Salazar. "<br/>
"Hogwarts still has a vault? I thought vault number 345 would for school. At least, this is the safe for whom I got istatments in my position." Minerva said.<br/>
"I can explain that to you. Since the vault was not used by the school, the statements went to Earl Peverell." Explain Ragnuk Minerva, who had gradually made a better impression of the situation.</p><p>"Ragnuk, would it be possible to talk to Earl Peverell?" She asked him.</p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>It was two days since Minerva was in Gringotts and one since she met with the Earl and so it came that she now again in Albus office sat.</p><p>"Do I understand correctly, we are independent of the ministry's payments? We do not need to pay them anything?" He asked her unbeliever.<br/>
"Not just that Albus. We have more money, which allows us to reintroduce subjects that the ministry has cut because of cost. And best of all, the Department of Magical Education has nothing to say. We are independent and only the Earl has a say. This means that we must stick to the ICW guidelines. The information will go to the Ministry tomorrow."</p><p> </p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>Ministry of Magic<br/>
