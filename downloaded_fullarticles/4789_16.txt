    <p>Lucius was at the slave market to get a slave for the house. His son was turning eleven year's old soon and was his only son. He needed another cleaning house Elf but he didn't want to waste his money on one. He already had ten house elfs encoulding Dobby.</p><p>Slaves cost less and worked more then House Elfs did. He watched as each slave was brought out and then a ten year old girl was brought out. Her eyes were covered by a blindfold but Lucius notcied her hair black as night the slave trader said she was a witch from an unknown family that sold her.</p><p>" I'll purchase the young lady here she'll go to Hogwarts when she's my son's age I want an educated slave not a dum one." Lucius said to the slave trader and holding out the gallons for the girl</p><p>" As you wish Lord Malfoy, you behave for the Lord he's very respected and to be treated as such." The slave trader said with a bow and she nodded</p><p>Lucius took hold of the robe around her wrist and she followed him unaware she was going. He got into his car the driver took off and Lucius took off her blindfold.</p><p>" You are my slave, you prefer me as Master, my son as little lord and my wife as Mistress... you will be educated to the highest of your schooling I expect good grades or else only in private will you call me Master when your around school students it's Lord Malfoy that shows your respect for me same goes for my son plus wife." Lucius said explaining to her and she had her eyes lowed</p><p>" Yes Master." Rosabella said as he lifted her chin and she closed her eyes</p><p>He wanted to see her eyes. He tilled her chin left and then right. He wasn't getting anywhere holding her chin and he was very angry.</p><p>" As your master you will look me in the eyes unless your being punished... I'll explain the rules... Rule one: You will not harm anyone in my family, Rule two: I do not tolerate lying always speak the turth to me, Rule three: There is no swearing under my house unless you make me angry you would not like me when I'm angry, Rule four You will obey me, my son and wife and lastly rule five: Absolutely No leaving the grounds without permission first. The punishments are simple a spanking, mouth washing, grounding and a time out you will be treated like a child that you are I'm not cruel to whip you." Lucius said as she opened her eyes and he looked at her</p><p>Her eyes were an Emerald Green. Most beautiful set of eyes he had ever seen. They arrived at the Manor and they got out. They arrived in the dinner hall were his wife and son were waiting for him.</p><p>" Lucius, what's this?" Narcissa said smiling and seeing Rosabella</p><p>" I brought us a slave I explained the rules to her." Lucius said smiling at his wife and she kissed him</p><p>Rosabella waited for her orders silently and Lucius loomed toward her standing there. He motioned her toward him and she walked to were he was.</p><p>" What is your name?" Narcissa said bending down and Draco looked at her</p><p>" Rosabella, Mistress Malfoy." Rosabella said as Narcissa smiled and stood up</p><p>Dobby came with a folder and presented it to Lucius. Lucius looked at the creature with a sneer and yanked it from him. Dobby left quickly but not before seeing the little girl beside Lucius.</p><p>" Hmmm it's her record's, I'll look at this in my study and your room is beside Draco's... Draco go show her I'll be up in a moment." Lucius said looking at the folder and Draco nodded</p><p>Rosabella followed Draco up the stairs and he opened a room next to his. The room was big, the bed had green sheets, sliver pillow covers and the walls were green. Draco smiled at the color and looked at the slave.</p><p>" This is your room, Your my new friend not my slave and when we get to Hogwarts I expect you to act like my friend." Draco said smiling at her and she blinked at him</p><p>" Yes little lord." Rosabella said as he frowned and shook his head</p><p>Draco grabbed her hand and escorted her inside her room. He sat on her bed and pulled her gently to sit beside him.</p><p>" That's another thing don't call me little Lord only the house elfs call me that it's Draco if you please." Draco said as she nodded and he smiled at her</p><p>Downstairs</p><p>Lucius sat down at his desk and opened her folder. He read the first line were it started. Rosabella Jamie Potter born July 30th to Mr. James and Lily Potter. Twin brother to Harry James Potter, sold by Vernon Dursley. Lucius closed the folder quickly she was a Potter he just brought a Potter. He went upstairs and Draco was talking to Rosabella.</p><p>" Master." Rosabella said as Lucius looked at her and Draco left quickly</p><p>" You start your tutoring with my friend Severus Snape tomorrow he will be your teacher in Hogwarts I want you to call him Professor Snape, he is to shown respect and I want to nothing but praise from him not behaviour issue's is that clear?" Lucius said sternly and she looked at him</p><p>" Yes Master." Rosabella said as he left and a House Elf brough her food</p><p>After eating the house elf took away the empty plate and she went to bed. Lucius was in bed with his wife and he looked at her.</p><p>" I brought a Potter, she's the twin sister of Our Dark Lord's enemy." Lucius said showing her and she looked at it</p><p>" A Potter... well she still is a child and I hope her brother isn't a brat." Narcissa said as he nodded and they went to bed</p>
