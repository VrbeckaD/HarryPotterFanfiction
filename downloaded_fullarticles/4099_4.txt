    <p>Harry hasn't felt well lately. His already non-existent appetite has decreased, when he does eat he can't seem to keep anything down, and he's begun to get increasing tired as the days drag on. </p><p>He's not interested in anyone knowing about this, and plans visit a hospital if it gets worse. It's only been one week since the symptoms started, and he still feels...fine. Harry doesn't want to go now because he's too scared.</p><p>Before he'd made the stupid mistake of giving up his virginity Hermione had given his a lecture on all the possible diseases that could stem from sexual interactions, and because he hadn't been listening he missed what she was saying. </p><p>Now, he's terrified, afraid that he may have contracted one of those STD's. If anyone was to blame, it was Ron and his making fun of Harry still being a virgin.</p><p>☯️☯️☯️☯️☯️☯️☯️☯️☯️☯️☯️☯️☯️☯️☯️☯️☯️☯️</p><p>The club was alight with color, green, red, blue, pink, and purple intertwine to resonate along with  the dancers and lookers in a slow moving trance. The music was loud, vulgar, and matched the club beautifully. </p><p>A group with three occupants sat by the bar, two favoring their drinks and one eyeing the dancers with an unfitting leer. Annoyed with the stupid leer, the only female of the group thwacked her red haired boyfriend on his head causing the black haired man  to snort in amusement. </p><p>"That's what you get for staring at other girls instead of your girlfriend" </p><p>he laughed while the other stared at his irritated girlfriend sheepishly.</p><p>"Sorry Hermione, but you should know that I'm only thinking about you and what we could be doing" </p><p>Turning irritation into embarrassment </p><p>"RON!" yelled Hermione followed by Harry's "Gross Ron, keep those thoughts to yourself". </p><p>Ron turned to a blushing Harry with a smirk.</p><p> "Your just jealous because you've never had sex with anyone"</p><p>Harry's blush turn intensified. </p><p>Ron flinched as he was hit again when Hermione started to chastised him for is words, which only fueled Harry embarrassment and Ron's smirk.</p><p> "It's not that I don't want sex, I just haven't...found the right person yet" the blushing man muttered.</p><p>H stared into his drink, the two other occupants turned sympathetic eyes towards him.</p><p> "Oh, harry it's okay. Besides there are many problems that can occur from sexual interactions, like did you know how many STD's you could..." </p><p>By that point Harry had droned out, and so couldn't really remember what had been said next. That was all he could remember from the night, because after he had gotten so drunk that he could only remember snip-bits from that night. Well it wasn't all he remembered, He also remembered sleeping with a blond haired man, the one that had taken his virginity. He had woken up to an empty bed and a sore arse. </p><p>He had cried for a little bit, depressed that he had lost his virginity to a complete arse that didn't even stay the next day. It was only a two weeks later that he figured out it was Draco Malfoy he had slept with.<br/>He became more depressed seeing as how they had been getting closer to being friends and that night may have just ruined everything.</p><p>So here he was, tired, nauseated, depressed, with no appetite, and no virginity. Great.</p><p> </p>
