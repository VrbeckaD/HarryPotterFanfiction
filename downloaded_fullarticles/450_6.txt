    <hr/><p> </p><p>Ginny Weasley has scorching red hair that blazed in the morning light and framed her freckled forehead.</p><p>Ginny Weasley smelled of chamomile, summer and flying.</p><p>Ginny Weasley was a shameless blanket hogger that more often than not left Harry blanket-less and shivering.</p><p>She was a lot of things: a marvelous Quidditch player, mischievous little sister, loyal friend and wonderful fiancé.</p><p>But one thing she wasn’t, Harry realized with rapidly-growing horror, and was the person in bed with him. No, instead of the sight of his fiancé, Harry woke up to dark eyes on him – possessive, smug eyes that cut <em>deeper</em> than a knife ever could.</p><p>
  <em>Tom-<strong>fucking</strong>-Riddle.</em>
</p><p>Elegantly sprawled out on the oversized bed they were in, completely uncaring for modesty, Tom stretched out those long legs, showing off his powerful thighs and well-muscled calves. A tingling wave of desire swept through Harry and he took a moment to savor the view before shame and guilt sullied it. He inhaled, then exhaled Tom scent.</p><p>Harry closed his eyes, “Fuck.”</p><p>“Gladly,” Tom smirked.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Ginny busted into his life one summer in an explosion of glitter and fury. She demanded his respect, defended his life, chastised his bad choices and captured his heart.</p><p>She raced him in Quidditch pitch and snogged him in the broom closet. She taught him laugh loudly without shame, the best way to mix firewhisky and Nettle wine, and how to <em>love</em> recklessly.</p><p>She told him to be himself, because there existed no one better and she would kick his ass if he thought anything else (no one could insult her loved ones, not even themselves).</p><p>She became the burning light in his life.</p><p> </p><p>Tom Riddle on the other hand…</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>"This was a mistake."" Harry said, pacing beside the bed, “a terrible mistake.”</p><p>Tom just lifted an eyebrow.</p><p>"It can't happen again," Harry glared at him, "I love Ginny."</p><p>"Of course," Tom said amiably, wearing an amused expression, the one where his mouth wasn't even curved but he was smiling anyway. Nothing good ever followed that expression.</p><p>Harry narrowed his eyes, his suspicion only building when Tom rolled out of bed smoothly and lithely, and began picking up his discarded clothes. Something too close to disappointment simmered inside him as Tom covered up sinful behind with those dark trousers.  </p><p>"This was a mistake," Harry said again a little uneasily, because Tom was behaving un-Tom like, which could only mean there was a very Tom-ish scheme he was missing.  </p><p>"<em>A terrible mistake</em>, darling,” Tom mocked as he fastened the buttons at the front of his shirt, “Repeat it a couple of more times, and I have no doubt you’ll succeed in making yourself believe it's true.”</p><p>“I don’t need to convince myself; it’s the truth!” Harry growled. The urge to throw something at Tom filled him with vivid, furious want. It was not – it was not <em>fair </em>that Tom was so unfazed when Harry was burning with so much <em>shame/guilt/ desire/anger. </em>Tom was not allowed to act like this meant nothing, not again.</p><p>“Being with you is always a mistake,” Harry said with as much venom as he could.</p><p>Tom rolled his eyes, “Don’t be so melodramatic.”</p><p>"What, because that is your thing?” Harry said, sarcastically. Then he frowned, once again reminded that, yeah, being an overdramatic asshole was Tom Riddle’s thing. When he wasn’t a being an emotionally stunted icy-brick, that is.</p><p>Their third last fight, Tom had threated to set<em> fire to everything Harry loved and how <strong>dared </strong>he walk</em> way.</p><p>"I suppose," Tom allowed, " Hypocrisy and victim-mentality is more up your ally." His expression changed from mild exasperation to faintly surprised with a glance at clock on his wrist. Tom was now fully dressed, white shirt and black trousers framed by navy-blue robes. He looked sharp, poised and suave. The only thing ruining the image of smooth perfection was the tousled bed hair – which Harry had played a large role in creating, <em>running his finger through it gently at first, then pulling hard as Tom thrusted harshly and hit just the right spot.</em></p><p>Tom straightened his back and stalked over. Dark eyes gleaming when Harry let out a startled sound. Humiliated, Harry crossed his arms over his chest to look stern and determined. Tom stopped just in arm's length and looked at him. "While I usually don’t mind indulging you, <em>darling</em>, I’m afraid I’m running on short time.”</p><p>Harry blinked, "Oh. Okay?"  </p><p>Tom tilted his head, slowly, his gaze shifted downwards, taking in Harry’s naked from head to toe. Red dusted Harry’s cheeks and he almost ducked his head, before thinking better of it and defiantly meeting Tom’s eyes, soliciting a smile from the other man. Heat lingered in Tom’s stare, dark and potent, but his voice was cool when he said, “You can walk away from here, wash up and go home to Ginny, either to confess or to pretend this never happened. Either way, you’ll utterly convince yourself by tomorrow morning that I manipulated you into my bed and swear never again. But, it will happen again, maybe next week, maybe next month, or…perhaps you’ll manage a year this time.”</p><p>Harry shivered, feet rooted to the ground. He wanted to run, to hide. But there was something there, something within him that wouldn’t allow for him escape. An intuitive sense that somehow, the time to resist had already run out, a like noose tightening around his neck. His voice shook when he asked, “Or you could stay away? Respect the relationship between me and Ginny?”</p><p>Tom scoffed, “Why? You certainly don’t.”</p><p>Harry flinched.</p><p>Unexpectedly, or perhaps not, Tom’s expression softened – the way it often did since that incident.  They had been nine, stupid and close in way growing up managed to completely ruin. Harry still remembered running straight into traffic trying the save that annoying snake-companion Tom had been obsessively talking to the last weeks. He hadn’t even liked that best-friend-stealing-serpent, and Tom was so smugly all the time because Harry couldn’t speak to it, and it bit him once…but none of that had mattered, because that snake had <em>mattered</em> to Tom.</p><p>It had only been because Tom had pulled him out of the way with his prodigious magic that he’d avoided getting hit. Tom pulled him back violently that Harry had crashed right into him and they stumbled backwards scraping their knees. The snake was flattened a second later by the oncoming car.</p><p>And Tom…Tom had just stared out at the red smear of guts on the pavement, his grip on Harry painful and bruising. He turned with this look like he couldn’t believe Harry had made him worry that much – fear, rage, disbelief and worry etched his face.</p><p>Tom was looking at him in similar way now; like he couldn’t stand the thought of him being hurt. Hypocrite.</p><p>At some point, Harry’s arms had unfolded, not through any conscious decision. Tom stepped into that empty waiting space and cupped Harry's cheek gently. "Darling, it hardly matters. I’ll take care of you regardless," Tom said softly.</p><p>Harry closed his eyes, feeling something inside him break to pieces, because Tom always knew how to twist the knife. Sometimes, Harry wondered if the other man hated him, and if hate was bruising kind of love to Tom Riddle.  <br/><br/></p><p> </p>
