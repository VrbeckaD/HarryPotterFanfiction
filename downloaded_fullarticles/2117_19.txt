    <p>Leif always had a good life. At the age of 11 he had received his Hogwarts letter, it was one of the most exciting days of his life. His parents were muggles, so they had struggled grasping the idea of magic at first. A few days later they had received help in getting to Diagon Alley from the newly appointed Headmaster, Minerva McGonagall.</p><p>The start of the school year was an eventful one, with half the school still recovering from the second Wizarding War that happened few years ago. The sorting ceremony went quickly, with Leif being sorted into Ravenclaw. The Ravenclaw common room was beautiful, the ceiling was enchanted simular to the Great Hall, showing the stars and purple sky. The walls were covered in shelves stuffed with books, with topics ranging from astral physics to wizard fairy tales and myths. There was a golden colored globe siting next to a wall empty of books, next to it was a telescope pointed at the circular window that took up the otherwise empty wall. The middle of the room was replaced by a gigantic spiral staircase that lead to the dorms, a railing preventing anyone from falling. The common room it self was circular, adding to the elegant feeling of the Ravenclaw tower. There was a small room opposite to the door, meant for doing homework. The room was dark, as the ceiling blocked out the rest of the common room's view of the stars. There were chairs littered across the entire place, put there by people not wanting to read on the floor.</p><p>The dorms themselves weren't was beautiful. The place gave of a calming feeling, with faded blue walls and warm air flowing peacefully. Much like the common room, book shelfs stuffed to the brim scattered the walls. The beds fit strangely well with the rest of the room, with calming deep blue blankets hidden from sight by the bronze drapes hanging from canopy. The place smelled faintly of lavender and old books, giving into the relaxing atmosphere that woukd soon by shattered later in the year.</p><p>What most people don't know about Ravenclaws is how well they actually do in school. Sure, they're intellegent, but they tend to focus that intellegents on other things. They do best in classes that are fond of creativity and focus, such as transfiguration or astronomy. Besides the Gryffindors, Ravenclaws are the most rowdy house. They tend to learn more from experience than by books, though reading helps them with creating experiences. Their brains are always filled with whacky ideas, and the common room and dorms are always a mess from experiments. </p><p>♤♤♤♤♤♤♤♤♤</p><p>Leif quickly made a few friends that stuck with him for the seven years he spent at Hogwarts, and the group soon became known to the whole school as the Walking Comedy Show. Along with their humor, they also were some of the smartest in their year. It seemed like they would all be close friends until they died, but sadly Leif lost contact with them soon after they went seperate ways. </p><p>Every summer his parents would educate him on what he had missed during the year. His father was a teacher at a law school, and he would teach Leif about his rights, the laws, and how to observe and deduct. His mother was a scientist, and would teach him advanced math and science. On his own he had descovered three things that changed his life; Vines, Broadway, Doctor Who, and Marvel. When he wasn't studying, he would spend most of his time over the summer going arms deep into the fandoms. When he was at Hogwarts, he would qoute musicals and with some of his muggleborn friends, and eventually started learning how to play the songs on various instruments he started playing in his third year. </p><p>After Hogwarts, he secured a job with the Ministery as a Hit Wizard. The job payed well, and he got more fighting experience in those few years of work than most would in their life. After months of living with his parents, he finally earned enough money to buy a small cottage out in the woods. The place was peaceful, and most of the time the only sound that could be heard was the rushing of the waterfall behind his home. </p><p>Leif thought he had everything figured out. He had somehow managed to install wifi, even though his living space was in the middle of nowhere. He had used magic to make the cottage bigger on the inside, installing a music room, a gym, an office, and a mini museam of artifacts he received during his time at Hogwarts or at work. He had a well paying job that he was happy with, and a space to call his own. What more could a guy want?</p><p>And that's where our story begins.</p>
