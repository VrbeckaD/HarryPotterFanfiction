  <span>“Muuuuuuum! Get off! I’ll be late!” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know, Rosie, but I’m going to miss you so much!” Honeymaren smiled, not releasing her grip on her daughter, who was almost dragging them both toward the giant locomotive.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’ve got Liv to keep you more than busy. That one’s gonna be a Gryffindor like you, Mum.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Rosalind Elise Arendelle…” Elsa’s soft voice floated over the din of Platform 9¾ as she wandered through the crowd, a spitting image of Honeymaren clutched to her hip, except the hair. Her hair was platinum blonde, too, one of the signature characteristics of the Veela. Even though she had abdicated leadership of the Arendelle clan, she wanted to pay homage to her heritage in some way, so she and Honeymaren had agreed to change their last name. “I know you’re eager to get to school, but did you think you could run off without saying goodbye?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rosalind grinned and tucked her chin, leaping into her mother’s embrace, her long platinum hair flowed behind her, wrapping her arm around her little sister “Sorry, Ma, I’ll miss you. And even Liv, too.” </span>
</p><p>Olivia stuck her tongue out at her older sister “Just you wait ‘til I’m at Hogwarts with you! I’m gonna…”</p><p>“Olivia Grace, you let your sister have her day today. Tomorrow you can dream about all those school records you’re going to break.”</p><p>Olivia smiled up at her sister, who looked like she would have imagined her mother at age 11. “You’re gonna be great, sis. Give ‘em hell!”</p><p>“Excuse me, miss, where did you hear that language?!” Elsa looked down at her youngest daughter.</p><p>Honeymaren blushed slightly “Ermmm… it might have slipped out a few times.”</p><p>Elsa chuckled and held her family close. She looked up as the conductor made an announcement that the train would be departing in 5 minutes “Alright, bugger, scoot off, unless you would rather stay with us all year.”</p><p>Rosalind beamed and scampered off through the crowd. “I’ll be home at Christmas!”</p><p>Elsa smiled and held Honeymaren close, realizing her wife’s body was tense with worry “She’ll be alright… she’s our flesh and blood, remember.”</p><p>“She’s more you than me…”</p><p>“Maybe in looks, but she’s got your spirit, too.” Elsa grinned and kissed her wife.</p><p>The rest of the Arendelle family waved goodbye as they saw a flash of platinum blonde in the window of a train compartment as the train lurched out from the station with a loud toot of its horn.</p>
