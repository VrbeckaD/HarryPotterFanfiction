    <p>It’s in the song playing at the start of the Yule ball, it’s the record scratch of his lungs seizing up and his breath spilling out all at once, and his heart pounding so painfully against his chest he wished it’d <i>stop altogether</i>. It’s in the spins and twirls of the opening dance, it’s the way his hands tighten when he watches her smile over the head of his partner, it’s the way he stumbles over the steps and turns the wrong way and wishes that the ground would open and he’d fall through because <i>merlin this is embarrassing</i>. It’s in the frills and petticoats, it’s the way she’s picked up and spun and he hears her laughter ringing in his ears louder than any song playing and his back burns and his hands clench and he refuses to dance anymore because <i>she’s dancing with someone else</i>. It’s the periwinkle in her dress, and the way her eyes glitter and the way he misses her frizz and loves her sleek. It’s in the breath that she takes away, and the way she glows and he is in awe because he didn’t know anyone could shine <i>that bright</i>. It’s the way he falls in love with Hermione Granger, and the way he never fell out of love.</p>
