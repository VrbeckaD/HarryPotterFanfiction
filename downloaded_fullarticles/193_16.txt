    <p>Death-he concluded-was like a dinner party that never ended.</p>
<p>Shifting his…<em>form</em> on an increasingly uncomfortable chintz, Sirius Black reflected that if he knew he was going to spend the rest of eternity at a family function, he’d have tried a lot harder to stay alive. That’s what it was, really...a reunion of such flamboyant magnitude it would’ve made even his dear dead Mum tremble with apprehension. Walburga was here, of course, he’d barely escaped her throwing Bellatrix at him again...but it was hard to alarm someone who’d already kicked it. Someone whose corporeal essence hadn’t quite fully coagulated was murmuring in his ear...but he had a sneaking suspicion it was Moody. He kept getting flashes of that electric blue optical piece, and there was no missing those scars. The idea that he was dead was disheartening...as it meant that the war had begun to touch those who he’d previously thought impervious. Remus could be dead and he’d never know it, he wasn’t high enough-(or low enough, depending how you looked at)-on the tier to get into pure-blood Receptions, lucky bastard.</p>
<p>It was dumb luck that he’d landed here, really. The first time his vision cleared enough to allow him to look around he’d had an intense urge to vomit. There ought to have been an undead law that allowed only four Blacks to gather together at one time. From what he’d been able to keep track of, there was up-score of a hundred and he’d been repeatedly assured that this was a <em>small reception</em>. He’d also gathered that this was somehow about him, but it was stupidly difficult to keep track of time there, though he really only felt as if he’d been dead a few hours. There were people who had tried to speak to him, but he hadn’t mastered talking without his mouth yet...and he was distinctly aware of the fact that if he got up...he’d fall over or explode into some disgusting ghostly mess that he’d be forced to clean up.</p>
<p>No, being dead wasn’t <em>anything</em> like he’d expected it to be.</p>
<p>Moody was floating off in the direction of some questionable-looking bowls of punch, though whether it was out of his own volition or not remained unclear. Come to think of it, Sirius’d not seen any sign of James either, but it didn’t particularly surprise him. He was beginning to think that this was truly a <em>‘reception’</em>. Everyone around him was acknowledging his untimely descent into the afterlife, but nothing about where he was resonated with him as familiar. He had a distinctly uncomfortable feeling that he was running out of time, though for what, he couldn’t say...and the more he considered it the more it ate at him.</p>
<p>He hadn’t been ready to die.</p>
<p>Any sorry sod who declared themselves <em>‘ready to die’</em> hadn’t experienced life quite like Sirius Black. He hadn’t been done smoking fags or drinking cheap whisky-(mind you, not so cheap since his confinement to Grimmauld Place)-; he wasn’t done chasing birds and listening to Remus natter on about how he’d be the death of him. And Harry...-! Sirius tried and failed to ignore the pang of guilt suffused agony that lanced through his chest at the thought of his now Godfatherless godson. He hadn’t been done spending time with Harry. Casting a despairing glance around the now almost unbearably crowded room, he was bitterly conscious of the fact that even if James <em>could</em> be there, he wasn’t entirely sure he <em>would</em>. He’d been careless with his life after Azkaban. Churlish, ungrateful even. It was hard to explain to someone that spending his days locked away in his childhood home was somehow worse than being in the middle of the ocean surrounded by Dementors.</p>
<p>His parents had done their damnedest to turn him into a ‘perfect pureblood’ before tossing him on the streets. As firstborn, he was expected to uphold some mannerism of image, and in his first years at Hogwarts, he was distinctly ashamed of the fact that he’d remained arrogant and somewhat aloof. He’d always told Harry he and James had simply ‘fallen in’ together, and that was somewhat true. What he <em>hadn’t</em> told Harry was that he’d hand-picked James out of the rest of their fellow Gryffindors because he was pureblood and his family was of decent social standing. He’d have had more choices if he’d been sorted into Slytherin, of course, but that wasn’t to be his lot. James’ mischievous, ever-positive nature had grown on him. Slowly at first, but by the end of their second year...Sirius could count himself proud to be his friend; and a friend to the rest of the Maurauders. A year after that and you’d never have guessed that the quartet’s unruliest, most flirtatious and-inSirius’ humble opinion-most handsome member was once uptight, somewhat snobbish, and overly concerned with blood status.</p>
<p>If he were honest with himself, he’d been careless about his entire life.</p>
<p>By the time they graduated James had grown up and was well into his relationship with Lily. They tolerated Sirius popping over for dinner every once in a while, but it soon became clear that he was expected to ‘settle down’ soon as well. And he <em>missed</em> James...missed him enough that sometimes he wondered if he’d done the right thing...stepping back, keeping his mouth shut. Peter didn’t change much, but he didn’t live near them, and Sirius was ashamed to admit that they’d not so much lost contact with him as they’d ignored him completely. He’d received countless letters from him that first summer, and one of his most prominent memories was lying on his poor excuse for a bed totally hammered, staring at the stack of envelopes with an ache in his chest that told him he was a terrible, terrible friend. Remus struggled with his lycanthropy from the minute he stepped out of Hogwarts until the day Sirius fell through the veil. By fall of 1978, Sirius rarely heard from him by owl, and saw him even less. Remus was always <em>‘studying’</em> or picking up a rag-tag low end job to earn just enough Muggle money to take him to his next sordid destination. He stopped in on Christmas, and he never missed Harry’s birthday, but Sirius knew he was pursuing the secrets of lycanthropy; known and unknown.</p>
<p>He’d stopped trying to tell Moony to ‘think positively’ about his ‘furry little problem’ when he’d lured Snape to the Whomping Willow. As far as he was concerned he had lost that privilege, permanently. Years after the event, the monstrosity of his betrayal still lurked behind Lupin’s eyes...and he could not, in good conscience, dissuade him from finding a solution for something he’d treated so frivolously. Their friendship had never fully recovered, and it was this, more than anything else, that haunted him during his stay in Azkaban. James’ and Lily’s deaths were a grindstone around his neck, but the fact that a member of the Maurauders was still alive and had made no attempt to reach out to him. was crushing. It showed him how little faith Remus had had in him to begin with, and it bloody <em>hurt.</em></p>
<p>Bellatrix was shooting him increasingly hateful glances.</p>
<p>Sirius had never figured out why they’d gone there separate ways when they were out of Hogwarts. Maybe it was because they’d slowly grown apart as James’ obsession with Evans grew, or maybe it was because Sirius had always counted on James to pull him back from the edge like he had so many times during their years at Hogwarts. Maybe it was because Remus always fussed over him like he was a mangy stray with some sort of mental affectation that excused him from everything he did.</p>
<p>Everything except attempted murder, that is.</p>
<p>No, Sirius Orion Black had lived like he died; stupidly, recklessly, and without much thought to how his actions would affect those who cared about him. To make matters worse, he’d died by falling through a bloody curtain. Somewhere, in a place far removed from the permeability of mortality, the Fates had to be laughing their heads off. If he concentrated hard enough, he could vaguely remember the small moments between the time Bellatrix had hit him...and when he’d fallen. He could remember Harry’s eyes widening in hopeful disbelief as his Godfather fell through a seemingly empty archway...surely expecting him to hop right back up on the opposite side. His memory brought forth not one howl of agony, but two; one that was Harry’s, and one that was familiar but so achingly distant that he couldn’t grasp the identity behind it. He never saw his life flashing before his eyes, but he’d never expected to. He’d known long before his death that all of that was bullocks anyway.</p>
<p>Azkaban was worse than death.</p>
<p>A younger, more arrogant version of himself might have scoffed at the concept of <em>anything</em> being worse than meeting your untimely demise, but he now knew this to be untrue. He’d spent year upon year lost in the desperate memories of a man he barely remembered...a man he’d never truly reclaimed even after escaping. As the Dementors siphoned his will to live, he was forced to relive the recollections of the things he had come to regret more and more. Each day, sometimes twice a day, a happy memory was stolen from him. Sirius had reflected-somewhat bitterly-that he was lucky to have been so happy at Hogwarts. He’d been surrounded by friends, and kept busy and entertained with snogging girls and pulling pranks. The Dementors took a lot of joy from him...but no matter how hard they tried, he always had more. He had James and Remus, Lily and the beautiful Delilah Miggs with the magnificent knockers...hell, he even had good memories of <em>Peter</em>, the double-crossing arsemonger. No, Azkaban needed to have tried a lot harder if they wanted to push him into despair; otherwise, he wouldn’t have had the motivation to escape upon seeing that Prophet article.</p>
<p>Harry’s life had taken precedence after that...and in his brief few gasps for freedom, he’d felt some semblance of hope for his future. Looking back, he wasn’t exactly sure what he’d intended to do with the future of his Godson resting on his shoulders, but in some ways, he was grateful it never came to that. Fifth year had brought about a change in the Boy-Who-Lived that even he had not always been able to fathom. Harry was angry and bitter...traits he often saw reflected in himself as he roamed the halls of Grimmauld place. Both of them placed much of the blame on Dumbledore and his terrible affinity for keeping life-threatening secrets, but the reality was that each of them had looked far too much inwards during that time....and neither of them had truly done much to discourage the other.</p>
<p>
  <em> <b>‘You’re running out of time...’</b> </em>
</p>
<p>He’d never counted himself one to hear voices.</p>
<p>Casting his gaze around the room, Sirius was surprised to find it mostly empty. Granted, there wasn’t much love lost between arrival and departure. It was still strange to find himself suddenly and inexplicably alone. The room’s essence had taken on a more solid appearance, but it had grown smaller and now appeared to be a sort of antechamber with a single door straight ahead leading to parts unknown. He was sitting on a plain workbench...the long, hard type you might see at a hastily gathered public venue in the country. He didn’t appear to be wearing anything, but this didn’t alarm him as much as he supposed it should. Nakedness was apparently a non-issue in the afterlife, that was something Sirius could appreciate. The only thing that really bothered him was the obvious lack of his wand...but he’d never particularly liked the one he’d gotten after his escape. Nicked wands didn’t tend to agree with their captors...no matter their intentions. The walls around him were prismatic, and he couldn’t focus on one for long before his eyes began to hurt and he was forced to look away. They gave off the sense of being incredibly powerful and yet somehow semipermanent...as if this room was designed specifically for him...and no other would come after.</p>
<p>“You’re running out of time!”</p>
<p>There was a girl in front of him...about Harry’s age he supposed, with long flax-colored hair that rippled to her waist, and funny radish-shaped earrings. Her eyes were the color of silver sickles; airy, but with an intensity to them that gave Sirius the impression she was staring into his very soul. Her clothes were nondescript and not altogether ‘present’...if such a description were even possible. She wasn’t indecent...but her torso was ‘fuzzy’; as if she was projecting from a different plane and couldn’t be bothered to straighten out all the details.</p>
<p>
  <em>“Are you dead?”</em>
</p>
<p>His voice sounded distant, even to his own ears; as if he was speaking across a massive distance; where only the faintest echoes of vocalization could possibly reach someone. The girl tilted her head and narrowed her eyes as if listening intently. He realized-with a jolt of bitterness-that he was indeed dead; and it was very likely the young lady in front of him was a seer attempting to reach him. Strange...to see her so close, and yet acknowledge that she was eons away...out of this time and space.</p>
<p>“I’m not” she replied gently. “But you are. And if you’re not careful, you’ll be dead forever.”</p>
<p>Sirius smirked, struck by the still-apparent vein of optimism in her tone.</p>
<p>
  <em>“I...didn’t know I had a choice.”</em>
</p>
<p>This time, it appeared to take her longer to decipher what he’d said, and when she did she looked sympathetic.</p>
<p>“You fell into the Veil...a gateway between the Realm of the Living and the Realm of the Dead. It’s a one-way trip...and you weren’t given a choice...you never committed the crime you were accused of. Even the Fates aren’t that cruel...and Time knows when its fabric has been ripped asunder for the sake of an evil deed. Tom Riddle thinks he has trumped the ravages of death...but he couldn’t be further from the truth.” She gestured to the door behind her. “That door leads to the summer of 1978...is there anything you’d like to change about that time?”</p>
<p>He gaped.</p>
<p>When looking back on that moment, Sirius wouldn’t have been surprised if his jaw literally hit the floor. Because was she <em>kidding?!</em> There were a million things he wanted to change about that time! He could save James and Lily, and Harry would have his parents! He wouldn’t be guilty of a crime he never committed, and he’d have a chance to talk to Remus again, and maybe even stop Peter from making such god-awful choices... He might even be able to convince Dumbledore that moving the Potters from Godric’s Hollow was a better idea, and that they’d be safer somewhere else. Then, abruptly, the wind was knocked out of him....because this was not possible. No one came back from the dead decades previous and prevented major disasters. No one got to see their friends again-their <em>dead friends</em>-and put them back into the lives they’d left like it was absolutely nothing. No one got a second chance.</p>
<p><em>‘You’re having me on’</em> he said bitterly. <em>‘I don’t remember you, but you’ve got to be a hallucination. That’s what happens when you die, right? You hallucinate?”</em></p>
<p>She smiled, and it was sad but at the same time understanding.</p>
<p>“I’m not a hallucination...I’m...well, sometimes I don’t even know what I am. I get made fun of for it a lot, actually. But Harry misses you so much, and, well, he’s not the only one who misses you. I wanted to help, to do something.” Her brow furrowed. “But you’ve got to go through that door, or you won’t get another chance.” Something flickered abruptly at the corner of her ‘projection’; a flash of brilliant red light that seemed to creep upwards and encompass her entire being. Silver eyes widened, and Sirius thought he detected a trace of fear. “I’ve got to go, but please, consider it. I understand if you want to stay...but there’s so much you can change-!”</p>
<p>-He was alone again.</p>
<p>The walls around him seemed to have encroached upon his space as they were speaking, and the door that had been directly in front of him was suddenly much further away. Scrambling to his feet, Sirius stumbled as his not-quite ephemeral body attempted to find equilibrium. Biting his lip, he considered his options. Eternal peace, no matter how much his rebellious spirit balked at the idea, was undeniably attractive. He’d spent the last years of his life incredibly unhappy, and he had no idea what his mental condition would be should he decide to take the girl up on her offer. That being said, he wasn’t particularly sure how <em>old</em> he’d be either. It would be incredibly hard to explain why he was a thirty-six year-old train wreck with prison tattoos if he arrived in the state he’d left. Still, it would be worth it if he could save his best mate...damn his own physicality. How could he look Harry in the eyes in fifty or so years with the knowledge that he’d had the opportunity to go back and save his Mum and Dad?</p>
<p>That settled it once and for all.</p>
<p>After going to pat down his pockets-and subsequently realizing he hadn’t any-he made a slow but determined path towards the door. Each step seemed weigh him down more and more, and it was with a jolt of dread that he realized that he really didn’t have all that much time. Whatever this space was, it was impermanent to either sphere of existence; Living or Dead, and his ‘middle ground’ was about to dissolve. The 'walls’-indiscernible as they were-appeared to be closing in on themselves, giving off the impression of being in a triangulated prism...with the entryway up ahead his only concrete grounding point. There was a far away sound that gave the impression of something massive collapsing in on itself; like the death of a behemoth in the depths of the sea, or the wailing howl of a quasar on the edges of space. He was suddenly indescribably cold, and felt as if he was made of countless tiny sand particles...one wrong move, and he’d dissolve into a million pieces.</p>
<p>Up close, the door appeared to be made of three foot-long slabs of solid oak; shaved to a brilliant finish. There was a windowed lattice on top with colored, diamond-shaped panes; pumpkin, aquamarine, and pumpkin. The knocker was in the shape of a lion’s head and oddly familiar, the brass warm beneath his fingertips as he took hold of it. Three raps and the door swung open; a shadowy, but somewhat familiar shape taking form before him. Sirius took a deep breath and stepped forward; gasping as he appeared to sink through an invisible barrier that was somewhat aqueous, coming out the other side to stumble over a welcome mat and fall flat on his arse.</p>
<p>It was in this way that Sirius Black found himself sprawled on the Potter’s living room floor in the year 1978, with a bewildered James leaning over him and a concerned but perfectly healthy-looking Lily peering out from the kitchen.</p>
