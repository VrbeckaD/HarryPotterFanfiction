    <p>Another curse flew by and had Harry not been occupied with dodging it; he would have rolled his eyes. Hard! Why was every Death Eater on the planet so bloody convinced that he would succeed where Voldemort had failed, dishing out killing curses as if they were candy? It seemed that, since the chosen one had joined the Auror Squad, the number of Dark Lord followers, doubled every other week. No matter how many they captured, more seemed to be just around the corner.</p><p>“Stupefy!”</p><p>“Expelliarmus!”</p><p>‘Thank god for a competent partner,’ Harry thought as he watched the ringleader hit the floor, his wand snatched out of the air by his colleague and friend. He had gone through half a dozen partners after joining the Aurors. All competent people, no doubt, relishing in the honour of working side-by-side with the 'Boy Who Lived'. He could do no wrong in their eyes. But, either he worked his ass off, or they did, despite him earning all the glory. None of them had been feast able overall. Oh, they had had his back, the Ministry did not employ fools, but none of them had called him out on it when he had done something stupid. Not like,</p><p>“Harry James Potter, are you completely out of your mind, rushing by me like that, following this scum alone, without backup? If you do that again, I’ll hex your ass six ways to Sunday! Are we clear?”</p><p>He tried to avoid the stabs against his chest, with the Death Eater’s wand, adopting an innocent expression. “I have no idea what you’re talking about, Mister Longbottom. I was just following a suspect.”</p><p>“Harry!” Neville groaned, rubbing his hands over his face in frustration. “Why are you doing this to me? It’s like you have a death-wish. I know you killed You-Know- … Voldemort, but that doesn’t make you invincible!”</p><p>Turning away with a shrug, the raven-haired auror bound their latest suspects with a flicker of his wand. But one of Neville’s most outstanding qualities was his patience. Had to be when his greatest joy was growing things. So, Harry knew this discussion was far from over.</p><p align="center">--O-O--</p><p>When they were back at the Ministry, after having given their reports, Neville reached for his spray-bottle and approached the overgrown wall that dominated their office. Harry could not even name all the different greens and tiny pedalled flowers, that created the serene picture his partner had planted. Still, he was glad to have something in the room that made Neville so obviously happy. Maybe it would gain him a prolonged reprieve. His hope, however, turned out to be in vain when said partner sighed and stated quietly. “You think I don’t get it, but I do!”</p><p>With everybody else, Harry would have dismissed these words as an empty phrase, but this was Neville. The young man had been there, in the eye of the storm, for seventh year. Doing his best to keep himself and those around him safe. While Ron, Hermione and he had fought and hunted Horcrux, Neville had led the resistance at Hogwarts, a place he had considered his home for six years. Harry had been so proud of his fellow Gryffindor, despite his heartbreaking, when he had heard of all the horrors they had faced.  So yes, Neville got it, had fought in the war facing torture and death as much as Harry had. Therefore, it was impossible to dismiss his opinion, no matter how little the raven-haired wanted to discuss the topic.</p><p>“I know you do.”</p><p>Whipping around, banging his bottle on Harry’s desk, spraying the surface in the process, Neville accused him, “Then why do you act like you’re alone out there? I know that I am not Ron or Hermione, but I thought you trusted me! You accepted me as your partner, so I thought … I thought you trusted me …” He repeated dejectedly, voice growing softer with every word.</p><p>Suddenly, Harry caught a glimpse of the lonely, scared Gryffindor first year his partner had been once upon a time. And that was the last thing he wanted. Neville had been through so much, had come such a long way from the boy who had trembled before Snape. Who had hidden in the greenhouses, when the teasing had gotten too much. He was competent, skilled and despite his suffering still a good person at heart. He was …</p><p>“You are the only one I’m able to trust around here. All the others are either overzealous or to deferent to be any good. You at least call me out on my shit.”</p><p>“Then why?”</p><p>“I … I don’t know.”</p><p>Closing his eyes, Neville suppressed another sigh, shaking his head. “Yes, you do, but it’s okay if you don’t want to talk about it. Just please, please, do not force me to watch you getting tortured or killed. I’ve had enough of that for a lifetime.”</p><p>“I’ll try my best.” What else could Harry say anyway? His partner’s … his friend’s request was not unreasonable. They both had seen enough people getting hurt to last a lifetime. “I will try to do better next time.” That was the best he could promise, and both knew. This promise would hold for the next raid, maybe the one after, but then they would be back here. Harry sometimes wondered how long it would take Neville to give up and request a different partner. He deserved better, was a brilliant Auror, doing his partners proud. Harry did not want to lose him since he was the only one who understood that stunning and disarming your opponents was enough most of the time. Oh, Neville could use hexes and curses even more skilfully than any other auror. But, as his friend had shared, he had seen enough people suffer and never added to their number needlessly. Most importantly, he treated their work as just that: a job, a responsibility, not as a personal vendetta against every marked person out there.</p><p>“You’re the best partner I have had since joining the office.”</p><p>“I know,” Neville chuckled. “Robarts gave me the reports about your last partners when I requested to be paired with you. They were all …”</p><p>“… idiots, the lot of them.” Relieved that his friend had relaxed, Harry mirrored his smile.</p><p>“We can do this, Harry.” The brown-haired wizard promised. “We can get rid of all the Death Eater scum, so nobody has to be afraid anymore. But I need you to work with me, not beside me. Neither of us can do this alone.”</p><p>“You won’t have to,” Harry vowed, hugging his friend.</p><p align="center">--O-O--</p><p>Hermione worked for the Department of Magical Law. Ron had taken his brother’s place at Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes, even before finishing his seventh year. He had, once again, become exactly what was needed, filling the hole – at least a tiny bit – Fred’s death had left in his brother’s life. So, cleaning up after the war fell to Harry – the boy who lived – and Neville – the boy who could have been the chosen one, had Tom made a different decision that fateful night. Both were glad that their friends were safe and would do their best to keep it that way.</p><p>With a crooked smile, his partner nudged him towards the door. “Why don’t you leave early for once? I’ll wait for the confirmation of the reports, file them and lock up.”</p><p>“Are you sure?”</p><p>“I am.”</p><p>Harry’s face lit up when he reached for his robes. “Great. Ron wanted to show me a new fudge. Maybe I’ll catch him before they close.”</p><p>Chuckling, Neville warned, “Just make sure you won’t get whiskers and a tail out of this visit. Or eat something that makes you vomit all over the desk when you drink tea.”</p><p>Despite Harry growling at his friend for making fun of him, he had to admit that all these things had happened, so he promised, “I’ll be careful.”</p><p>On his way to the Atrium, he slipped into the infirmary for a quick check-up. Harry knew he was fine, had had enough experience with being cursed to know that nothing had hit him this time. But his clean bill of health would show on the report and put Neville at ease. The fellow Gryffindor really was the best partner Harry could wish for, so he did not want to lose him.</p><p align="center">--O-O--</p><p>The late September air was fresh and crisp, reflecting on the dozen shop-windows of Diagon Alley. Even after five years, the remnants of the war were still visible in some places. However, the Wizarding World tried its hardest to heal. Buying himself a triple club sandwich and some pumpkin juice, Harry made his way down the street, towards his best mate’s shop.</p><p>After Fred’s death, Ron had done everything in his power to support George. Despite all three of them returning to Hogwarts for their final year, the red-head had started to follow in his dead brother’s footsteps, developing products in his spare free time. Though he did not have the brilliant mind of Fred when it came to pranks; or Lee’s financial talents with negotiations with potential customers and his exceptional book-keeping skills; the war – especially after him re-joining them – had taught him to reach his goals with virtually no resources.</p><p>Beetleroot was out of stock? Ron would find a new supplier within the day. Problems with outgoing shipments delayed their deliveries? A dozen owls and a muggle shipment-company for the weightier parcels were enlisted overnight.</p><p>George’s average fix-costs had decreased by twenty-seven percent, making Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes the most successful joke shop in Britain, maybe the entire United Kingdom.</p><p>George had offered Ron Fred’s part of the company within a year of him working there. But with the money he had received for his Order of Merlin – Second Class, the youngest male Weasley had bought a roomy house for Hermione and himself and was content with that. He accepted payment suitable for his efforts, even compensation for added hours or when he had to come in on weekends, but nothing beyond that.</p><p>With Hermione and Harry’s help, they had set up a fund from Fred’s earnings. The money would go to several orphanages because – as the Weasleys had decided collectively – losing one’s parents was horrible. So, these children could do with some serious cheering up. (That most of the money would go towards their education, was never talked about, because school was boooooring!)</p><p>“Mate, you are a lifesaver!” Ron announced, as soon as Harry entered, before turning back towards his costumer, bowing when handing over the product. “Here is your Giggling Goo, Miss Rosenberry. Have fun with it. We hope to see you again soon.”</p><p>A little girl, with pigtails down to her pink, frilly skirt beamed up at him and at once dug into the paper bag. Giggling already, she replied, “Thank you, Mister Ron. Have a good day.” When she passed Harry, she smiled brightly, revealing a missing front tooth. “You too, Mister Mister-Ron’s-friend.”</p><p>“Gimme!” The redhead insisted, making grabby hands for Harry’s remaining sandwich. Relinquishing it easily, he looked after the girl. “Polite little thing.”</p><p>“That’s Ariadne,” Ron mumbled around his food. “She comes in every fortnight. Her mum died during an attack six months ago, leaving her and her baby-brother to their dad’s care. We think she buys the Goo for the baby when he can’t sleep for a few nights in a row. She told me once that her dad can sleep through her brother’s giggling but gets really sad when Theseus cries. George decided that we offer her a fifty percent discount. She pays for one ounce but receives two.”</p><p>Nodding, Harry handed over the last of his juice, for Ron to wash down the sandwich. Once his best friend was finished, he dived behind the counter and produced a jar of rainbow-coloured candy. “Here, try one.”</p><p>Stepping back, the raven shook his head, “No offence, Ron, but the last time I did, I was sweating blue for two days.”</p><p>Fishing out one of the sweets, Ron pushed it at Harry, “We worked out that kink, I promise. Just try it again. They taste like Fish Mints now, you’ll like them.”</p><p>Reluctantly taking the sweet, he studied it suspiciously. “For your sake, I hope you mean ‘Fresh Mints’,” before popping it into his mouth.</p><p>“Exactly!” His friend exclaimed, shaking his head at himself. “I was wondering about that strange name. Anyway …” He mirrored Harry’s attention when the later studied his hands, that turned red, faded to orange, and then started to shine a bright yellow. Beaming, Ron revealed, “You’ll go through all the colours of the rainbow, and once the roll is finished, your natural skin-colour starts to bleed through again.”</p><p>“Pretty,” Harry decided, hiccupping under his breath. “I think Luna would love these.” Hick!</p><p>Studying his friend, Ron mumbled absent-minded, “So take some and give them to her tomorrow.”</p><p>Hick!</p><p>“Ron?” Hick! “What’s happening?”</p><p>Frowning, the redhead explained, “We have this problem with one out of fifty testers. But you didn’t get hiccup last time.”</p><p>Popping the sweet into the napkin, Ron provided, Harry, shrugged. After another hick, he pondered, “Maybe something I ate?”</p><p>Beaming all of a sudden, Ron dug into the bag and popped one into his mouth.</p><p>“What are you doing?”</p><p>“Well, we just ate the same thing. If it is something in the food, we …” Hick!</p><p>“Brilliant!” Spitting out the sweet, the redhead rummaged through the garbage bin to find the sandwich wrapper Harry had offered. “Let’s see what we’ve got.”</p><p>Locking the door with a chuckle, Harry followed Ron through the side-door into the laboratories, where the new products were developed.”</p><p>
  <strong>“George!”</strong>
</p><p>Harry covered his ears just in time, when the twin removed a cloak with a disillusionment charm, right behind his younger brother and shouted in an equally loud voice, <strong>“Ron!” </strong>Prompting the other redhead to jump a foot into the air. Then he turned around and greeted in a normal voice. “Hey, Harry,” evading skilfully, when Ron lashed out and raged, “Stop doing that!”</p><p>Grinning unrepentantly, the taller Weasley handed the cloak over, when the Auror reached for it and stated, “You hollered, little brother?”</p><p>Shaking his head to get back on track, Ron offered the wrapper. “I think I know why some people hiccup from our Rainbow Rolls.” And with that, the two Weasleys went off on technical terms Harry hadn’t even known existed.</p><p>Checking the enchantment on the coat, George really had a gift for these, Harry left a little note before bundling up the fabric. He left through the shop, thumbing it close. Those two would be useless for the next few hours, ironing out the last flaws in their latest product.</p><p align="center">--O-O--</p><p>The faint smile that grazed his lips when thinking about Ron and George’s antics melted away, when he arrived at Number 12 Grimmauld Place. He looked up the façade as the house pushed itself into view, briefly squeezing his eyes shut when the sunlight reflected on a window on the top floor. With a sigh, he opened the door.</p><p>While the interior was still decorated in dark colours, the mould, cobwebs and moisture, that had seemed to cling to everything, were gone. After the war, when Harry had moved into the only home his godfather had been able to give him, he had earned Kreacher’s respect by cleaning the place. Well, maybe respect was too strong of a word. Watching him, the elf had overcome the inherited loathing he felt for every person not born into the Black bloodline. Harry had spent hours on his knees, scrubbing floors because the grime of decades had proven too stubborn to be removed even with the most potent cleaning spells. Every time he had risen, dirty and stiff, he had imagined how the rest of the Wizarding World would react when seeing their saviour on his knees. The truth was, he could have made things easier on himself. Transfigure the old and threadbare wooden floors into shiny, new beams, but that had felt like an insult to Sirius memory. So physical labour it had been. At least he had done it out of his own, free will and not because some wizard-hating muggle had forced him. In a way, it had been cathartic to clean his own home, and he had slept more comfortable at night after working himself to exhaustion. No nightmares had plagued his dreams.</p><p>They had returned, with a vengeance, after he had brushed down the last of the walls, exchanged the last of the drapes and dusted off the last of the furniture. Harry had fallen into a hole, swallowed by his own memories of torture and death. Sleeping had become a distant memory and eating a once-in-a-day occurrence. He had cared for his live-in house guest better than himself, and the man had been in a coma since the day of the Battle at Hogwarts.</p><p>For nearly six months Harry had tortured himself with living through horrible memories each night until Hermione had kicked him out of bed and – effectively – out of the house. He had heard about Egypt from Ron when he was still at school. Had learned about France, where Ron and Hermione had spent their honeymoon, but none of these places had felt real for him. Again, his best friend had ordered him to Just. Get. Out. Starring at her, Harry had made the split-second decision to do just that. If memories of Tom’s horrible deeds kept him from living, he gave them too much power.</p><p>Deciding he was done with that. He had packed his bag, had hired a live-in-nurse and had entered Gringotts the next morning. One of Hermione’s charmed bags over his shoulder and his purse full off money, he had gone to Kings Cross and left the country the same day.</p><p>Paris had been his first stop, the Eiffel tower in all its glory a sight that took his breath away. Southern France, with all its colourful flower-fields, had shown him that there still was beauty in the world and from there, he had started tramping through Europe. In India, he had found a great travelling companion in a green rattlesnake that had escaped one of the temples. She taught him about the magic of the land, how she could feel the power through her belly when crawling moving on the ground. Harry had visited graves, birth-places, the top of the world, breathing in magic that could not be more different from the power in Britain. He met wizards he could not understand, no matter how many translations spells he tried and communicated with hand and feet. He had eaten food that had made his stomach hurt, had puked out his guts from all the strange spices and had gotten drunken on wine you could never find anywhere else.</p><p>He had passed Russia; visited Durmstrang and Victor Krum once the season was over. The former champion of the Triwizard's Tournament had invited Harry into his own home, and over the course of an extended weekend, they had drunken several bottles of vodka and reminiscence about times passed. That weekend Harry learned that Hermione was pregnant. He was giggling through the entire fire-call and tears had started streaming down his eyes when she showed him a blurry ultrasound picture of a little blob he could not even identify. He wanted to return home that night, but his best friend had – sensible as always – told him to continue his journey and that the baby was not due until next spring.</p><p>In Korea, Japan and finally China he learned about the inherited magic that lived in the very stones of the buildings that had been erected hundreds of years ago. About ancient creatures so tiny you could not even see them, but that thrived on the emotions of the inhabitants of their homes. Luna would have loved them, and Harry had purchased several paintings and books to send to his friend.</p><p>In New Zeeland, he found flowers unlike any he had seen before. So precious and vibrant, that he acquired a whole kilo of different seeds and sent them home, along with a library of books about their cultivation for Neville.</p><p>Australia was … scary to say the least. How did anybody live in a country where literally everything, from the tiniest spider to the prettiest flower could kill you with its poison? But the people adapted. Harry spent a fortnight with a werewolf clan that lived in the outback, running and hunting on the full moon because there was nothing for hundreds of miles around, except small livestock and veldt. They did not hurt each other or themselves; never lock themselves up. When they wanted to run, be it as a wolf or as wizard they just did, and they had been the most peace-loving people he had met so far. He listened to their stories, wrote everything down and sent it to Hermione once he was back with the civilisation where he could find a post-office.  His best friend still was invested in the whole creatures-right debate, and this would definitely help. And if he sent tiny jumpers with kangaroos and a blanket with koalas, he hadn't mentioned it in the enclosed letter.</p><p>From Sydney, he flew to Los Vegas and spent an entire weekend wrapped up in women, booze and gambling. Since he had never had much money, he had set himself a sensible limit on how much to spend. Yet when he woke on Monday morning, with more money in his pocket, he suspected that his magic had given him a little nudge.</p><p>Travelling the coast became an experience in itself because when he was tramping, he met a lot of different people, some nice, some not so much. But most were okay. One guy in a sports-car, who had picked him up in L.A. had come on to him and did not seem to understand that ‘No’ was a valuable answer when proposing someone. Harry had solved the problem by obliviating him. The next ride he had hitched was a biker gang, and though he had been reluctant at first, they had turned out to be the most helpful guys he had met so far. They had planned to tour the U.S. during their holidays and readily invited Harry to join them, only requesting money for gas. So, he hiked with them until New Orleans where the exotic spices and the voodoo magic had captured his attention.</p><p>A set of voodoo dolls and an instructive volume on spells had become his gift for Ron. Harry had been sure that he and George would have had a field-day with them. He had sent a Gumbo-cooking book along for Molly and a recording of the local music for Arthur. The very air seemed to vibrate with the magic of these people, from the musicians, who wove their own kind of spells with their instruments, to the priestess who served the land and its people.</p><p>His last stop had been South America. He had port keyed to Rio, but as soon as he had set foot in the city, something had pulled him into the jungle. He had bought supplies, and since he had an enchanted tent in his bag, he had no trouble to find a place to sleep, wherever he stopped for the night. Transfiguring it, so he could hang it in a tree, rather than set it up on the ground – something he had learned in Australia – he had felt safe enough to sleep unguarded. He learned to cast more than the essential wards when he woke one day to a horde of monkeys going through his food supplies.</p><p>Following the unexplainable draw that pulled him into the jungle, he stumbled out of the greenery at the foot of a giant pyramid, that felt like the people living there had only abandoned it yesterday. When he set foot on the premises, he realised that it had not been abandoned at all. People with spears and nets had forced him to his knees, and though he had sensed dark magic surrounding him, he surprisingly had not felt threatened. He had gotten to know true evil and these people, though afraid of him, had not been evil. He had allowed them to go through his pockets and his bag, knowing that they wouldn’t be able to unlock the expanded compartment since they weren’t magical. He had been more than surprised for one of them to shout out when they had pulled out his wand. He had made a grab for it, and surprisingly they had relinquished it easily.</p><p>Not knowing how to proceed, Harry had remained on his knees, watching, listening, trying to gauge the reaction of these people. Then the apparent leader had stepped before him, banging his spear on the floor, shooting fireworks into the sky. When the man had looked at him expectantly, he had cast a Patronus. Though he doubted that they had ever seen a deer, they understood the inherited magic, and with a toothy smile, the man had offered his hand and helped Harry to his feet. He then had been invited to join them and entered their home through the pyramid. Harry had emerged on the other side into a picturesque valley where women were preparing food and clothes, children were running screaming between them and men were labouring away on the fields and plantations that seemed to cover the mountain walls surrounding them.</p><p>It was … there was not really a word for it. The magic here was dark, covering everything like a blanket. Harry understood that on the same level that he knew that the sun was rising in the east. But there was no threat. He watched mothers cast stinging hexes on their children when they misbehaved and men to use charms to help the flowers grow. The air was filled with the scent of their magic, and everything was saturated with their power. Being guided towards the temple, Harry had not realised what was going on, too fascinated by everything around him. But when he was surrounded by seven priests, standing in the middle of a circle, he grew weary and grabbed his wand tighter. But instead of overwhelming him, the men stepped up to him, and each and every one of them drew a part of a symbol on his forehead, using their blood for paint. They barely needed five minutes and the more they completed, the better idea Harry got what this was all about. Once the last one was finished, and an incantation was sung, the British wizard understood. Harry did not actually get the words, but he could gather the meaning. Making conversation possible. As soon as the Brit grasped that, questions poured out of his mouth and with a joyous laugh, one of the priests pulled him along and started explaining.</p><p>Harry learned about civilisations hidden so long that they had been forgotten by the modern world. About magic so woven into a place and the people living there, that it needed to be maintained, cast, savoured for the earth to stay alive. He was taught about ley-lines and focus points. How magic required an anchor on the planet and that the magic of the land always called to its wizards. Harry might be able to cast light-spells, even in these dark surroundings, but they were feeble and weak, despite his power. They taught him incantations in their mother-tongue, dark and powerful, to heal, to destroy, to grow. They would be weaker in his home, because the British Isle, Albion was the white island so the magic there was as well. But – he understood – light did not mean good and dark did not mean evil. Snakes were a powerful symbol in their society, and as soon as they learned that he could speak to them, they guided him into a tomb deep under the floor of the great temple. There he understood for the first time that parselmouth was more than a way to converse with snakes. It was a unique form of magic, dark but not evil if the caster had no according intentions. It was just a different way to channel what was there.</p><p>For more than a month he lived with these people, breathed their magic until his very soul started hurting because he missed his home so much. The last thing the men and women of the Brazilian temple taught him, was how to connect points of high power. Portkeys, he was educated, were a shortcut over small distances, a couple of hundred miles at best. But if you were able to feel the very magic of the earth, with enough power, you could travel the ley-lines from one node to another. So, he tried and meditated, learning to sink into the ground to follow the power-grid that surrounded the planet. Harry was not able to travel farther than the edges of the country, but his teachers congratulated him because that was quite an achievement for someone who had had no knowledge about parselmagic before. They showed him a map of the world as they knew it and with little difficulty, Harry could identify the node of power at home. He helped prepare the ritual and promised to return, but they all knew that to be a lie. Still, they let it go and offered an open invitation.</p><p>Forty-nine of the most potent witches and wizards of their village cast for several hours, then Harry was pulled through – what seemed to be the centre of the Earth – and landed on wet grass, surrounded by stone monoliths. The British wizard fell to his knees, ready to weep. He had not known, had not understood how much he had longed for the magic of his home, until Harry felt it surrounding him again, caressing his skin, his very soul now that he was back. Looking around, he wanted to chuckle, because of course, where else could he land but in the centre of Stonehenge, the stone monoliths surrounding him like sentinels of a time long forgotten. He sent back a small, wet stone, as they had agreed upon, something infused with the magic of his home before the connection closed all the way. Something easily transportable because it had no life.</p><p>When he returned to Grimmauld Place, ten months after his departure, he had entered a home. Nothing perfect, but finally the place he knew he belonged. Rose Weasley had been born three days later, and Harry had, once more, become the godfather of the most beautiful baby.</p><p align="center">--O-O--</p><p>Now, more than three years later, Grimmauld Place was warm, almost homey, thanks to the house elf, who had helped with any restorations Harry had decided upon but had had no clue of how to achieve. Still, some days the dark thoughts and spells generations of Blacks had cast in this place seemed to permeate the very walls, making it hard for Harry to relax. Entering the expanded kitchen – nearly every room in the house had gained a few square feet with him imploring wizarding space upon them – he demanded to know, “How is he?”</p><p>“Sleeping peacefully as always, Sir.”</p><p>Thousand days of the same question and thousand days of receiving the same answer. Morose, Harry sank down in his chair at the head of the table, accepting his house-elf’s, “Dinner will be ready in a moment,” with a simple, “Thank you, Kreacher.”</p><p>Eating the no doubt excellent meal, Harry took little time to retreat to the upstairs study once he was finished. Compared to the rest of the house, this room seemed downright untidy, since it was the only one, Kreacher was not allowed to enter. Beer - and the occasional whiskey bottle littered the surfaces of most furniture. This had once been the salon of Walburga Black, dominated by the vast tapestry that held every name ever born into the Black family. ‘At least those she considered worthy,’ Harry thought, fixating bitterly on the leaf where Sirius name had been snuffed out by fire.</p><p>This too was a useless ritual he entertained ever since returning from his journey: he tried to spell his godfather’s name back into the family tree. Sirius had died a hero, fighting Voldemort to the best of his abilities. He should not have been killed that night, at the hands of an insane Death Eater. No matter how many they captured, there were forever more. Most days, Harry felt like he and Neville were fighting cockroaches, no matter how many they eradicated, the next nest was just around the corner. It was so hopeless as if they were never making any real progress. Hopeless, like his latest spell, the carpet refused to yield to. Sirius name still glaring through its absence. Drowning half of his drink in one go, Harry let his head fall back against the armchair, closing his eyes. Tomorrow they would have to follow another lead, find more of the bad guys, make their world a little safer one raid at a time. Maybe one day, they would succeed, and Neville would be able to return to his greenhouses and his flowers. To him, it would be worth it. Draining the last of his drink, Harry set it aside and, after a little detour into the second bedroom on the third floor, went to bed.</p><p align="center">--O-O--</p><p> </p>
