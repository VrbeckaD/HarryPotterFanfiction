  <p dir="ltr">The lights were off in the house, and it didn't seem like anyone was home. Harry checked the letter that he had gotten again.</p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">
    <em>Harry,</em>
  </p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">
    <em>Can you meet me at my house? I have a new pet I think you'll like.</em>
  </p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr"><em>From</em>,</p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">
    <em>Luna.</em>
  </p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">He wasn't sure why Luna wanted him to meet her new pet, but it gave him an excuse to come visit, so he didn't see why not.</p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">Harry walked up to the door and knocked on it. A muffled shout of "Wait!" greeted him as a light flickered on, which shone out of the window next to the door.</p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">The door opened. "Hey Harry," Luna greeted him, blonde hair all messed up like she'd been struggling with something.</p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">"Hi, Luna," Harry greeted her back. "You wanted me to meet your new pet?" he asked.</p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">"Yes." Luna stepped back from the door to let Harry into the house. "I do think you'll like him, he's very nice."</p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">"Nice?" Luna's definition of nice was very different to a lot of other people's. Harry had a bad feeling about this.</p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">"Yes. Well, he is nice to me, so I think he'll be nice to you." Luna lead him through to the living room, before gesturing to her pet. "Well, here he is. Meet Sid."</p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">"Mama..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">The first thing Harry recognised was the familar hiss in the creature's voice from his second year. Instinct screamed at him to run out or pull his wand out as his body tensed upon realisation of what Sid was. Fighting the urge to run away, Harry turned to look at Luna.</p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">"Luna... That's an acromantula, isn't it?" he asked.</p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">"Yes, it is. Sid's a baby one too. I like him, and he likes me," Luna explained.</p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">"...You do know how big those grow, right?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">"Yes, I do. The person I got it from gave me a potion to help keep him small and a recipe to make more. If we can't make more, me and my dad know <em>Reducio</em>, too." she explained as Harry knelt down next to what looked like a glorified hamster cage containing the acromantula. Sid, rather unfortunately, didn't take kindly to the new person looking at him and hissed and leapt at the wall of the cage, causing Harry to flinch back and fall on his backside.</p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">"Sid, that was mean," Luna scolded the spider.</p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">"Sorry, mama," Sid said apologetically.</p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">"Now say sorry to Harry."</p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">"Sorry..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">"It's fine," Harry said as he got up. "But Luna..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">"Yes?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">"Don't tell Ron you have one. He hates spiders."</p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">"Oh?" she asked. "Why?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">"I don't know, just... he does," he explained.</p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">"Oh. I won't then." Luna turned her attention to cooing at Sid, who gently tapped the wall of the cage he was in in response to her.</p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">Harry sighed. Of all the things in the world he expected, he did not expect Luna to have gotten an acromantula.</p>
</div><div align="left">
  <p dir="ltr">Though in hindsight, he probably should have.</p>
