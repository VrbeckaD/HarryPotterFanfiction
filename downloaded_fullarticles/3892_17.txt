    <p>Hermione and Ron spent the day packing their things ready for the Christmas break. And as per usual Harry was sitting on his bed reading, definitely not packing. Ron was aware of the glum attitude Harry was portraying and asked quietly </p>
<p>"Harry are you sure you are okay alone? Remember it's not too late to decide to come with us you know?" </p>
<p>Ron was referring to his trip to Romania tomorrow, Harry shook his head. <br/>"I told you, just enjoy your family holiday and I will be fine." he replied. </p>
<p>Satisfied with the reply, Ron took his case down the stairs and met Hermione with a warm smile. Their relationship had became stronger these past couple of months and Harry knew they deserved some quality couple time in Romania. It was as if Hermione sensed Harry's thoughts as she broke off the hug that Ron had just possessively pulled her in to, and turned to face the messy haired boy. </p>
<p>"Harry, coming with us would benefit you greatly. A break from school work and thinking about what's coming would be ever so good. Wouldn't it Ron?" she nudged Ron gently.</p>
<p>Ron turned to Harry and smiled, knowing he couldn't change Harrys mind. </p>
<p>"Oh come on 'mione we've talked about this multiple times. Harry might want to have his own alone time, and it's not like he is totally alone is it? He has Dean and Seamus see!" Ron pointed his thumb over his shoulder to the Gryffindor pair sitting side by side by the fire. Hermione gave a weak smile and knew she couldn't do much more. </p>
<p>With the train leaving in an hour, Harry waved his two best mates away as they strolled off hand in hand from the castle. He chuckled to himself. Even though he felt slightly upset at waving the pair off, he couldn't hide the fact that he needed a break from everything. A time to think things over and relax. With no particular plan Harry trudged back to the common room, excited to feel bored for once. </p>
<p>"Password?" the Fat Lady asked. </p>
<p>"Dilligrout." Harry expressionlessly replied. </p>
<p>"Honestly a smile would be nice, you kids have no respect." Harry didn't have any strength left to reply with attitude so he just gave a nod of the head and passed through. Apart from Dean and Seamus in the corner and a few 2nd years at a table, it was strange to see the usual lively room so bare and quiet. As Harry walked across to his two friends playing wizards chess, he noticed Dean was gently stroking Seamus' knee. Even though Harry was used to seeing the two so inseparable, he never wavered a thought as to wether they were more than best friends. Whilst relighting some candles to keep him occupied, Harry kept watch from the corner of his eye on the pair. Dean was looking at Seamus in a kind and loving sort of way, and as the two slowly leaned into each other to join lips, Harry left and walked up the stone stairs to his bed. Harry was shocked. But not in a bad way, a rush of warmth and happiness flooded through him as he thought about what he had just witnessed. Not knowing his own sexuality yet, he felt more confident in experimenting and was happy for his fellow Gryffindors to be so openly in love. Pushing all of the flooding thoughts away, Harry pulled on a comfortable hoodie and grabbed a couple of overdue library books to kill some time. </p>
<p>Walking through the ancient corridors, Harry couldn't help but picture a younger Sirius strolling these halls. It's been half a year and Sirius' death was still dragging Harry down. Everything seemed to remind him of his godfather. Hermione being concerned about leaving Harry behind was largely due to the fact that Harry was still grieving. But recently things have been easier, lessons have got better and Harry actually feels like he has been progressing. Entering the library felt like he was back under his invisibility cloak at night, because the room was totally empty, just rows of aged books. After handing the overdue books back to a not so impressed Madame Pince, Harry went and picked some more from the oak shelves. Astrology, being the only subject Harry has difficulty with, had a large range of books to choose from. As Harry was picking 'The Secret Language of Birthdays' (a large tattered book on Zodiac signs) someone entered the library. With a quick flash of green fabric and white hair, Harry couldn't believe his eyes when he looked up to see the popular, narcissistic, Slytherin glaring his way. Draco Malfoy would be the last person Harry would have expected to see at Hogwarts over Christmas   time. He expected him to be sitting in some velvet green armchair hidden in a dark room at his manor. Draco, seeing the surprised look growing on his nemesis' face slit his eyes and stalked off to a table near the back. </p>
<p>After a couple of hours spent reading and researching in the library, Harry left and headed back for his bed to kill some time. He felt a little awkward hanging around the Gryffindor common room now, being aware of the situation between his two friends. It felt silly to just sit reading on his bed when he should be taking his mind off of school work. But every time Harry stopped reading three things would pop into his mind, Draco and what he was doing at Hogwarts over Christmas, Dean and Seamus' relationship, and what is for dinner. Deciding the last one was the best option to dwell over, Harry hastily grabbed some shoes and walked over to his friends. </p>
<p>"Hey erm Dean and Seamus, I was wondering if you were going to dinner soon or something?" Harry awkwardly asked. </p>
<p>"Oh hello Harry, we have already been for early dinner I'm afraid. Sorry though." Seamus cheerfully replied. </p>
<p>"Oh no worries then, thats fine. Have a nice evening." As Harry walked out of the portrait, he took a quick look back, and to no surprise Seamus' arm was already draped back around Dean. </p>
<p>It was as if it was planned, the minute Harry turned the corridor which lead to the hall, Draco did so the opposite side. Awkwardly walking side by side, Draco stalking a little ahead, Harry was pondering over what to say. He didn't need to because Draco got there first. </p>
<p>"Merlin Potter, seems you are stalking me." He sneered. </p>
<p>Harry was taken aback, especially as this was Draco speaking without his other two brutes at his side. </p>
<p>"You entered the library after me actually." Replied Harry in a slightly cocky tone. </p>
<p>"Observing me were you?" </p>
<p>"No, I just don't think anyone can miss your shiny white hair Malfoy." </p>
<p>"Thanks for the compliment Potter." And with a smirk, Malfoy went left as Harry went right, both going to eat some dinner. </p>
<p>Whilst finishing his coconut and raspberry sponge, Harry kept glancing up at Draco, who was sitting on the opposite side of the hall but facing him. He was sitting with a couple of 7th year Slytherins, joining in the conversation every now and again. It was on his last bite, when he looked up to see if Malfoy had left yet, that the pair locked eyes. Instant panic was shown in Draco's eyes, and it took every ounce of strength that Harry had in him, not to smile. Then suddenly Harry realised that he was staring at him too, he felt heat rise to his cheeks. But what was there to be embarrassed about? It was just two rivals glaring at each other from across a room. Very abruptly Harry stood, and at the same time so did Draco. Harry left the table and headed to the door, mirror image as to what Draco was doing on the other side. As they both went out of the door the Slytherin did something Harry never would have expected, he asked. "If you are really alone, next time in the library I will help you with astrology." And with just one look in the eye, Draco turned on his heel and headed towards the dungeons. </p>
<p>The whole stroll back to the common room, Harry was reliving that moment. That moment where his enemy, the evil Slytherin, offered to be some company and help him. Harry didn't even really need help, but he knew Draco was in his astrology class and knew that he was aware of Harrys difficulty to grasp the subject. Climbing through the portrait hole, back to the very warm and welcoming common room, made Harry snap back to reality. He noticed the loved up couple had vanished from the sofa, and now there were two small groups of 2nd and 3rd years teaching each other how to play Monopoly, which Harry knew was a confusing muggle game. This made Harry think of his horrible cousin Dudley playing it now back in Privet Drive. He could remember this was the Dursleys favourite Christmas game. Not really wanting to join in or sit like a loner, he decided to wander back off upstairs to his bed. Climbing the last few steps he became very aware of the sound of ruffling and low murmuring. Thinking nothing of it, Harry entered the room to find all the beds empty but one. One with two people in it. Harry should have seen it coming, he knew at some point he would see them sharing a bed, but maybe not sharing a bit more like this occasion. Trying not to look and creeping over to his own bed on the far end, Dean must of heard movement because his head popped out from under the blankets, and a very shocked look came over his face. Seamus, obviously noticing Dean had stopped whatever he was doing, popped his head out too, right below Deans. His expression was the same as the one above. Not wanting to make it awkward, Harry smiled and quickly said <br/>"Sorry guys I wasn't aware, erm, I will leave and come back up later. Yeah so you carry -" but Harry couldn't finish his sentence because Dean had already pulled on pyjama bottoms and got out of the bed. </p>
<p>"Im so sorry Harry, how bad of us. We got carried away, erm I'm guessing you already knew about us? You seem very normal about it." Dean rambled on. </p>
<p>"Oh yeah I noticed today, and of course I'm acting normal about it, you two seem proper... you know.... happy! So I am happy for you's." Harry finished with a small awkward laugh and collected his things. </p>
<p>"No don't go Harry, you stay there, hey Seamus?" Dean raised his eyebrows to the flushed boy still laying in bed. </p>
<p>"O' course Harry, don't be stupid. I need to sleep anyway." Seamus mumbled the last part. And with that, Dean went downstairs, Seamus had changed and got back into bed, and Harry was staring out of his small window, thinking things over. Did he want to accept Draco's offer? In a weird kind of way, Harry wanted to go back to the library and see if Draco would have a genuine conversation and help him. Curiosity getting the better of him, Harry decided he would go to the library after late breakfast tomorrow and see if Draco was there. If he was, then Harry had no idea as to what would happen but he wanted to find out. Closing his eyes made Harry aware of how tired he was, it had been a long first day off, and Harry was strangely excited as to what tomorrow was going to bring.</p>
