    <p>“I can't believe we are doing this!” Ginny squealed and threw some more clothes in her trunk after she had dumped the content on the floor.</p><p>There lay her old 7th year books, robes and quills she had never unpacked when they had taken resident at the Burrow after finishing their NEWTs months prior.</p><p>“Me neither.” Hermione deadpanned and used her wand to sort out the mess her friend left behind, so neither of them would trip over it. </p><p>Ginny shook her head and continued running around her room.</p><p>“Do you think it will be warm down there, it might be New Year, but it's south Italy.”</p><p>Hermione wanted to start a lecture on weather, but Ginny didn't even let her have a word in.</p><p>“No right, I should pack for all weathers. Nice sweaters, t-shirts, underwear, shorts and a bikini?” </p><p>The red head threw a Weasley sweeter into the trunk followed by green lace underwear, grey shorts, leggings and a mint green bikini. Then she turned around and got some socks, high heels, a very classy black short dress and a dressing gown.</p><p>At that point Hermione rolled her eyes and turned around to fold the last of her clothes while she made sure her own trunk, that had been packed before Christmas, was full. The only thing she was missing now was her washcloths and toothbrush.</p><p>When she came back from the bathroom Ginny was using spells on her clothes to fold the pile she had made on top of her trunk and let it fly into the opening. After a short time it was clear that all the stuff would never fit into the small place.</p><p>“Ginny!” Hermione cried out. “How did you manage to pack more stuff for a long weekend in Italy than for a full term at Hogwarts?”</p><p>Ginny beckoned and smiled. “You never know with Blaise, I have to be ready for every eventuality.”</p><p>“You remember he invited me and Malfoy too, right? Please behave yourself, at least a little.” The statement made Ginny snicker, while she remembered the game of cat and mouse Hermione and Malfoy had played all term. Hermione had proven to be a difficult catch for the Slytherin Prince, that had tried to make her see his special talents. </p><p>The whole school had watched him try to win over Hermione and fail time and time again. As Hermione's friend and Draco's mate girlfriend he had asked even her for help, but Ginny never gave him tips. She loved to see him attempt to woo Hermione to much. </p><p>She also knew Hermione would give in after he had earned it, and helping him would be to easy. So Ginny watched the poor boy fail with his nice words, his expensive gifts and his thoughtful gestures.</p><p>The last had won him the privilege to be called Draco by Hermione. It hadn't stopped his boastful talk, but he was a bit more like himself around Hermione now, Blaise's words, not Ginny's.</p><p>Hermione watched Ginny try to close the lid and tapped her foot on the ground. When it didn't work, the tapping increased speed until Hermione finally exploded.</p><p>“Aren't you a witch?” She fretted and moved over to stand next to Ginny. </p><p>“Draco always accuses me of forgetting to use spells for the easiest tasks, while you are way worse than me.”</p><p>Ginny smiled to herself and took a step back.</p><p>“Capacious Extremis” Hermione pointed her wand at the luggage and suddenly the whole stack was gone. A dark hole remained where the bottom had been before, and Hermione shut the lid without problems this time. Then she added a feather light charm and ignored Ginny's gapping face.</p>
<p>

“But Hermione! How am I supposed to find my clothes now!” She nearly shrieked the words. </p><p>“You are a witch, you'll find out. And then there's always Zabini if you need help.” Hermione snickered to herself and Ginny was at a lose for words. Would a summoning charm work? Maybe she should have packed less, this could end in disaster. Who knew how big Hermione had made the trunk, just to pay back Ginny for having to spend New Year with the Slytherins. It didn't matter how fond Hermione was of the boy, she didn't admit it and acted as if it was an irritation.</p><p>“Common, hurry. Our boys are waiting.”</p><p>This time Ginny smiled. If Hermione noticed she had call them their boys?</p>
