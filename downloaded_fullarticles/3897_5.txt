    <p>The thing is, Draco has always known he wasn’t going to end up with his soulmate.</p>
<p>While most of wizarding society still holds with the idea of soulmates -- part of the reason soulmarks don’t appear until you turn twenty, it’s said, is so that whatever ancient magic controls them can take into account your life experience and current relationships -- purebloods broke with that tradition in the 17th century. When the inheritance and blood status of your future children is on the line, letting an abstract design on the inside of your wrist determine who you’ll marry just isn’t an option. Especially when said mark might mean the person you’re most suited to be with is a half-blood, or a pureblood with no rank, or -- worst of all -- a Muggle.</p>
<p>Draco knew from a young age that he would not be allowed to pick his own bride; that the mark which would ink itself onto his skin the day he turned twenty would have little bearing on his future. And he knew from his parents that a non-match marriage could be happy -- loving, even -- provided one of the couple didn’t lose his family their respect, money, and power by choosing the wrong side in a war.</p>
<p>The fact that he’s always known doesn’t make it any easier.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>~~~</p>
</center>Draco remembers being eight and drowsing on his parents’ bed, allowed to stay up a little later than usual to watch his mother dress for the party they were throwing that night, but not late enough to see the guests arrive. He watched as she came out of the walk-in closet barefoot with the close-fitting sleeves of her elegant dress robes still unbuttoned. She kissed his forehead as she crossed to her dressing table, a rare quiet moment when it was just the two of them, no house elves or Lucius in sight. He remembers watching through drooping eyelids as she combed her hair back and her sleeve fell open, revealing a pattern of stars and ribbons that he had never seen before, and being suddenly wide awake.<p>“Mama, what’s that?” he’d asked, and she’d been confused by his question until he rose and came over to her, pointing towards her wrist. She’d waved her wand and the sleeve buttoned itself, then opened her arms so he could climb onto her lap.</p>
<p>“It’s old magic,” she told him, and her brow furrowed when his eyes widened. “When you turn twenty, a symbol of some kind will appear on your wrist. Lore says that somewhere in the world, there’s a witch who will have the matching symbol to yours. Your perfect match, if you believe such things.”</p>
<p>“Does Father’s symbol match yours?” Draco had asked eagerly, and his mother had shook her head.</p>
<p>“No, darling. One must respect all magic, of course, but you really can’t base your whole future on a design on your skin, can you?” She’d lifted him gently off her lap, casting a spell to remove the wrinkles before she resumed pinning up her hair.</p>
<p>“I…I guess not,” Draco had said, watching her.</p>
<p>“Exactly, dear. Besides, by the time you turn twenty, you may already be engaged, or even married! Imagine if you had to wait to be a certain age for the rest of your life to start.”</p>
<p>Draco had nodded, although secretly he thought that this seemed like extra special magic, and perhaps his parents should listen.</p>
<p>“Draco, can you fetch Dobby? I want to make sure the hors d’oeuvres are going to be ready. And then you need to go to bed,” she said, picking up a brush and swiping it over her cheeks. “Give me a kiss and then I’ll come and tuck you in,” she said, and Draco pecked her cheek obligingly when she bent over.</p>
<p>He’d left the room, obediently going to find Dobby in the kitchen, but he couldn’t help eying his blank forearm as he walked. Of course he knew that his marriage would be arranged by his parents, and of course he believed his mother when she said it was antiquated magic, but if it were true…</p>
<p>Well. That would be nice.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>~~~</p>
</center>Draco learns many things at Hogwarts, from his teachers as well as from his peers, including some things his parents might prefer he not know.<p>He learns, for example, that a lot of witches and wizards -- most of them who aren’t pureblood, and even some that are -- do follow their soulmarks when it comes to deciding who they’ll spend their lives with. Frequently the mark will simply solidify an ongoing relationship, or open a new door between two people who thought they were just friends, but sometimes it will lead to someone they’ve never met before. He learns that sometimes, rather than the magical design that is inked onto most wizards arms, one would get the name of a Muggle.</p>
<p>“That’s how me mum convinced me dad,” he overhears Finnigan explaining to Thomas in the library, and forgets about it entirely until he walks into the dining room of the Manor to find Bellatrix, arms bared, suspending a small white rabbit helplessly in midair. Her Dark Mark looks slick and wet, seems to be moving, and Draco feels his stomach roll before his eyes land on her other forearm. It is a bisected by a thin scar, pink and tough, that Draco has never noticed before.</p>
<p>Bellatrix sees him staring and flicks her wand, sending the rabbit towards the floor where Nagini is waiting. She runs a hand down the scar, eyes glinting with something like pride, and Draco shivers involuntarily. “That’s what you have to do,” she says, “when the magic is wrong.” She looks up at him, her eyes for once focused and intense. “Do you understand?”</p>
<p>Draco nods and flees.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>~~~</p>
</center>Draco tries not to stay up the night before he turns twenty. He knows that the mark will come in, but there will be nothing for him to do with that information until he meets his soulmate. If he meets them at all. (<i>When,</i> a traitorous part of his brain whispers, and he firmly corrects himself. <i>If.</i>) Unless, Merlin forbid, his soulmate is a Muggle, and he gets a name instead of a symbol -- not that he’d mind, really, but his parents would go ballistic, and he doesn’t fancy having to curse his own arm to hide the evidence.<p>His anticipation is worthless, he knows, because it will never come to anything. His mark will appear, and his parents will arrange a marriage for him anyway, and he’s fairly certain his wife won’t end up being his soulmate because he’s fairly certain his soulmate should be a man. And what are the odds, anyway, even if he were allowed to follow the mark, that he would find the one it will tie him too? Most matches will be between previous acquaintances, at least -- close friends or romantic partners are even more likely -- and Draco’s never had any of those.</p>
<p>His soulmark comes in, a lovely design of ivy wrapped around a set of antlers, silhouetted against a dark sky lit by a single star. It’s beautiful, and maybe he cries a bit, but he forces himself not to be hopeful. It’s enough to know that somewhere out there is someone who’s meant for him, even if he never meets them. He’s been so horrid, has done so many dark things in his past, that he’d wondered if he would be granted a soulmate at all. It’s enough to know he has. To meet them would be more than he could hope for.</p>
<p>And then on the day after Harry Potter turns twenty, his picture is plastered across the front page of the <i>Prophet</i> -- not an unusual occurrence, all things considered. Except, in this photo he sits in Diagon Alley, having lunch with Weasley and Granger. His grey t-shirt is stretched taut across his shoulders, and as he laughs and runs a hand through his hair, his forearm flashes towards the camera. The reporters at the <i>Prophet</i> have included a zoomed-in photo below the fold, and Draco stares at it in shock. The angle is wrong, but he recognizes it instantly.</p>
<p>Antlers. Ivy. A dark night sky.</p>
<p>He drops the paper to the floor and buries his head in his hands, trying desperately to regulate his breathing.</p>
<p>He never thought that finding out who his soulmate was would hurt him so much.</p>
