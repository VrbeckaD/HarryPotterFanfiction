<p> </p>
<p>It was after several seconds of wondering why my bed was so hard that I felt the hand cup my cheek. A hand soft enough to make up for my discomfort.</p>
<p>The scents of cinnamon and vanilla filled my nose, alongside a far more stubborn earthy smell.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>I blinked at eyes the color of bellflowers. The girl’s face—framed by short little waves in that exact hue—was inches away. Her wide silver sleeves slid down to her elbows as she gripped my arms urgently.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>She eased me up from my supine position to my feet. I looked around, disconcerted.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>We were standing in the middle of a forest. My “bed” had merely been grass, dirt, and twigs.</p>
<p>What was I doing, lying on the ground like that? And why was it so quiet? A forest wasn’t meant to be so still.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Are you hurt?” asked the stranger, moving closer.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>I saw the other girl, then, over her shoulder, staring at me in terror. Her features were sharper, and the same gentle breeze I felt rustled her smooth, long dark hair.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>My initial thought was that they were both very pretty.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“I need to know if you’re okay,” said the one who still held my arms. “Talk to me.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>I looked down at myself. Delicate purple robes—nothing unusual there, though they could do with a wash. I wasn’t in any pain…</p>
<p>“I think I’m all right, thanks.” But my confusion only grew. “Can you tell me where I am? And…who you are? Maybe, also…why my name isn’t coming to me?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>They froze. I couldn’t decide which one seemed more stunned—or more devastated. What had they realized that I hadn’t?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>For an endless moment, nobody spoke. The situation had clearly been mistaken for a pebble to the head rather than the boulder it was in reality. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The hair and eyes of the girl in front of me had darkened from purple-blue to black. “We’re in…Crowley,” she said. “It’s an American wizarding town… Your name is Sanwyn—Sanwyn Arcana?” The information was provided haltingly, perhaps in the hope that I might interrupt with sudden recognition. When I failed to react, however, she grimly straightened her spine. “I’m Iana…and that’s—Sunny! Sunny, come back!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>But Sunny, her black robes flying, had already bolted for the trees and out of sight.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Iana slowly sank down onto the grass, lips pursed against what might have been a scream.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Unsure what to do, I flicked a thick curl off my forehead—and noticed a tear in my sleeve.</p>
<p>Then, in an instinctive move, I pointed my wand at it. And the tear…mended instantly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>I gasped. My wand! I’d snatched it from a pocket without thinking. Thirteen inches at least, well-polished, with a translucent handle…<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“I’m a witch,” I muttered to myself.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Iana said firmly. “You are.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>As if to punctuate this, a grayish-silver form glided through the distant gloom.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>A ghost.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Will, um, Sunny be okay?” I asked worriedly. What else was out there?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Iana never answered.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>It took a good part of ten minutes to reach the edge of the woods. I maintained a tight grip on my wand and matched Iana’s hurried pace. Although we walked side by side, there was no doubt I was being led. <em>Possibly to your death</em>, I thought. She seemed to be taking a well-known—and well-worn—path.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“That’s a cool color,” I said, gesturing at Iana. The purple-blue had made a triumphant return, twice as vivid as before. Was she recovering from the shock?</p>
<p>Was I?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Thank you,” Iana said stiffly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Metamorphmagus?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>She nodded. </p>
<p>“Pretty amazing.” </p>
<p>She looked away. </p>
<p>“Hey, Iana…?” But I hesitated. </p>
<p>“Yes?” she said.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“How old am I?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“You’re nineteen,” said Iana flatly. “We met during our first year at Ilvermorny. We’ve lived together since we graduated.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“All—all three of us?” I stammered.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Yes.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>I absorbed this as Iana stopped to free ensnared tangles of white, silver, and gold unicorn hair, storing them in a velvet pouch. The prospect of a unicorn sighting excited me, but they were nowhere to be seen.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Iana and I emerged from the forest to a winding road dotted by houses of every shape, size, and shade. Witches and wizards headed in different directions, dressed in traveling cloaks, speaking various languages, flourishing wands, Apparating and Disapparating. Owls made occasional flybys—letters and packages in beaks or tied to legs.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>My gaze drank everything in with helpless awe. The bleeding sunset would have surely put any other street in a strange light.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>I tilted my head back, eyelids lowering at the pleasure of the warmth on my skin. “Is it spring?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Iana was silent. Meeting her stare, I flinched at its intensity.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Autumn soon,” she murmured.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“I—”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>A small, giggling girl ran past us, chased by a panting woman. </p>
<p>“Give Mommy’s wand back, Leila! It’s not a toy!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The tip of the wand Leila held behind her back was vomiting a massive stream of colors. Had I witnessed it from afar, I would’ve been convinced there was a rainbow shooting out of the child’s rear end, lighting a trail for her exasperated mother.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Um…should we help…?” I asked awkwardly.</p>
<p>“No need,” said Iana.</p>
<p>She was right. A quick young wizard disarmed Leila just as she joined several friends, who had gathered in a circle to screech happily at something that smoked and popped.</p>
<p>Over the commotion, however, the faint echoes of a Howler could still be heard. I smiled—not that Howlers were anything to smile about. But the magic…the magic, I knew. It was solid ground. Even…a foundation.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>My smile became a grin of relief.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>A group of middle-aged witches chattered nearby.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Last night, I dreamed I married a winged horse, and he flew off in a huff whenever we fought.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“The most important question is: Did he fly back to you with chocolate?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>They shrieked with laughter.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“How was your vacation, Marie?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Yes, oh, how was it?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“All right, I guess. I did enjoy Diagon Alley, some great shops there—well worth the trip! Disappointed I didn’t make it to Hogsmeade, though.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Next year!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The abandoned brick building I’d leaned on to listen had two large posters decorating its side.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The first was of a peaceful-looking blonde woman flashing a reassuring smile, the MACUSA seal serving as her background. Words were emblazoned on the lower half.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span> </p>
<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em>President Wyle: Dedicated to protecting wizarding families.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p>President Wyle had glimmering blue eyes and wore her hair in a classic bun. Glossy robes suggested wealth, as did the large stone on her ring finger. Lack of makeup gave her a youthful, non-threatening visage. Unsure if the image suited its message, I wondered if the serenity Wyle exuded had made the climb to her position harder, or easier. Had her looks helped or hindered? Had she been underestimated? Or trusted to be calm and cool under pressure?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The second was a wanted poster of a woman who could not have been more different from Wyle. Eyes lined in black, an almost sickly glow to her olive skin, teeth white but oddly sharp, she was a twisted beauty—with a bottomless gaze capable of swallowing any soul that dared to look within. “<em>ZIZA</em>,” the poster called her.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em>WANTED<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>REWARD:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>D100000 (One hundred thousand Dragots)<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p>As I watched, a sixth zero materialized, making the total: <em>D1000000</em>. One million Dragots.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>I shivered. What could possibly warrant this? Forget MACUSA, the entire wizarding nation—if not the world—would be after her. How could this witch—Ziza—stand a chance?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“San? Come on,” called Iana, having walked ahead. She waited for me under an open second-floor window. “We’ve got to get home.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>As I caught up, a voice shouted from above, “Son of a bludger! Why is my owl green?!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>An owl’s hoot followed—was I imagining the indignation in the sound?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Sorry!” a second voice yelped.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Many offered greetings when they spotted us, but Iana didn’t linger. She marched toward a white cottage with a wreath on its pale blue door. Nearing it, I realized the wreath was in fact entirely composed of opalescent butterflies.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Sunny conjured them,” said Iana, her expression blank. “They come and go.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Their wings fluttered at our entry, creating a shimmer effect, but the butterflies were otherwise undisturbed. Instead, their small response felt like a hello. A welcome. I presumed, a welcome back.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>I inhaled and exhaled steadily against the urge to hold my breath as the door swung open.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>I stepped over the threshold. A gentle ringing echoed through—I suspected—the entire house.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Just a chime,” Iana said indifferently.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>I squinted. These “chimes” seemed to be no more than tiny airborne gold specks, gently spread out across the area.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>I would have been happy to see the enormous fireplace with or without a head in it, but it contained neither head nor flames. In the center of the mantlepiece was a jar that contained glittering powder.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>So the fireplace was connected to the Floo Network—that was useful information. Although, where would I go? Apparating to the first place that came to mind didn’t seem wise either—as nothing came to mind at all. I made a mental note to at least test out Apparition later.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The life-size portrait above the fireplace—of a nude girl lounging on her belly in an unmade but luxurious bed—was the next thing to hit my unprepared eyes. Interesting placement, for a portrait. Her head turned, the golden length of her hair shifting off her back to pool onto her pillow.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>I would have been very surprised if she was seventeen.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Hmm, that expression,” the girl said lazily. “<em>Déjà vu</em>.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Shifting my focus to the painting of a levitating broomstick directly beside hers, I cleared my throat. “You know, there’s a piece of clothing right there on your carpet.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Both works were shockingly lifelike—the broom painting could have been mistaken for a window to convenient transportation, and peering at the portrait gave me the icky sense of being a voyeur.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The girl rose onto her elbows to check her lower half. “No, there isn’t.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>I sent Iana a wide-eyed glance.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“This is Amaranthia,” sighed Iana. “She was the previous owner here.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Amaranthia frowned at the explanation, seeming not to understand why it would be necessary. “What happened?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>It was a good question.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“San’s been attacked,” said Iana. To me, she said,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“You’ve lost your memory but not, I think, your magical knowledge or ability.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Of course. A Memory Charm. Why hadn’t I reached that very obvious conclusion?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>One this powerful would have done permanent damage. I should have been enraged, but I couldn’t find the will to get worked up.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Do you know?” I asked Iana. “Who attacked me?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“I didn’t see them.” </p>
<p>I sensed she was choosing her words carefully. “What if they come back?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Eyes downcast, Iana shook her head. “They...already did what they meant to do.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Unperturbed by this news, Amaranthia delivered her own. “Ah, well. The cat pounced off—probably with Sunora by now. Best leave her be for a bit.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Iana’s nod was reluctant.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>I frowned. “Sunora? Oh—Sunny?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Amaranthia clicked her tongue. “The poor thing…”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Not that I minded her sympathy going elsewhere, but did she really feel worse for Sunny, whose memory was untouched?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>I might have glared at the portrait if my hungry gaze wasn’t busy devouring every visible surface.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Overstuffed bookshelves consumed an admirable amount of space. Among  the books were photographs, fist-sized clear orbs, and a heart-shaped Snitch hovering in place within its glass container. A large desk, throne-like chair before it, bore scattered items: corked ink bottles, feather quills, new parchment, a pile of tomes, fat flowers climbing from crystal vases, and a radio—its volume turned down. Two armchairs. Plump pink sofa—an open magazine curled over its arm, a ball of white fluff between the cushions. A thin rectangular table held teacups, newspapers, and more. </p>
<p>A turn to the right from the fireplace was the doorway to the kitchen, which revealed dishes washing themselves over the sink. On the bit of counter I could see was a basket of shiny bread rolls and a glass cabinet stocked with bottles of butterbeer, pumpkin juice, fire whiskey, wine, and various sodas.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>I laughed. I lived here? It was perfect!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>A trill made me jump.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Opposite a narrow door that I assumed led to a broom closet were a pair of lumps, their wooden perch partially hidden by the bookshelves.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Bopping heads. One small, the other adorably fat. A western screech owl and a great gray. But the little one… </p>
<p>“His eyes…” I whispered, moving closer. </p>
<p>They were magnificent: dark blue globes speckled with constellations. Yet my heart was overwhelmed by sadness.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Deus is blind,” explained Iana. “He can’t do the things Vil does, like deliver mail or hunt, but he’s no less important to us. Deus is fed by hand each day and enjoys pats as well as praise. Vil mainly prefers special treats.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>And just like that, my joy was restored. “He sounds absolutely glorious. And Vil is the one that looks like a majestic sphere of feathers?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Vil hooted proudly in confirmation.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Iana smiled. “Vil prefers to mind his own business—doesn’t like getting mixed up in our nonsense. But Deus is content to eavesdrop on us all with his excellent hearing—hopefully he doesn’t judge us too harshly.” No response came from the judge in question. “He does have some of his vision—he’s able to capture movement to some degree—but if he can tell us apart, it’ll be by our voices, which he’s thankfully comforted by.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Fitting name you have, little god,” I said to Deus. He swiveled his head toward me, showing off his tiny ear tufts, and trilled merrily.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“You gave it to him. Brought him home after he hit a tree on the forest edge.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Startled by her sudden hoarseness, I glanced at Iana, but was met with her back.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“I’ll—I’ll get you something to drink,” she said, hurrying to the kitchen.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Amaranthia stretched and yawned. “All right there?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Fine,” I said.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Hmm…”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Even if I’m not—I’ve just had most of my memory stolen away; I can’t afford to be vulnerable right now.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“You know, portraits are vulnerable. But somehow we go on. I’m sure you in particular would’ve removed me if it wasn’t impossible to do so. I could’ve been thrown outside—exposed to the elements—or if no one had bought my house, abandoned in a dusty, decaying environment with nobody to talk to but myself—” Amaranthia tumbled dramatically onto her back, arranging her hair so that it covered much of her front (but not before I got an eyeful). “You’ve kept your cool so far, but if you ever feel the need to take your frustration out on surrounding objects…spare this one, would you?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>I snorted. “Thanks for your concern.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“One must always be concerned with oneself, and all those who may impact one’s safety.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>If my current state was anything to go by, I hadn’t gotten the memo. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Yeah…” It was time to change the subject. “So we have a cat?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Harriet prefers to be referred to as ‘the cat’—she believes she’s the only cat that ever was…and refuses to acknowledge her fellow felines.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“And Sunny—Sunora?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“The cat’s favorite—and you’re either her favorite or nothing. I hear she was with you three at Ilvermorny…”</p>
<p>I wished I could recall attending. “Interesting.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Not particularly,” Amaranthia said. “What are you doing?”</p>
<p>I was revolving on the spot, considering my options.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Let’s see what I can do,” I said, stiffening with nerves.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>First, I conjured a small mirror. It showed me nothing I recognized: riotous brown curls flowing out from under a crooked pointed hat, amber-colored eyes, a tentative splatter of freckles...<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>At least that much was confirmed. Plus, I was a brunette—that worked for me.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Tossing the hat, I pointed my wand at a collection of blue rosebuds, which flew into the air, then back down onto the rectangular table. I also summoned a quill, cleared away a cobweb, made a teacup grow dancing legs, and transfigured a sofa cushion into a goblet. Each attempt was accomplished with ease, relaxing my shoulders…until the Patronus. Until my utter failure to produce the charm.  </p>
<p>Facing a Dementor without a Patronus was…unthinkable. But what had I expected? I hadn’t a clue what my happiest memory was. A town and home that didn’t even feel like my own could never be enough—no matter how lovely they were. </p>
<p>“<em>Most</em> of your magical ability remains intact, anyway…” Amaranthia said loftily.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>I scowled at her. “Just how old were you at the time of your portrait? Twelve?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Thirty-four.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“What!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“I often got that, yes—and get it still.” She smirked. “Don’t mind me, ogle on.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Sorry,” I said half-heartedly. But ogle I did…not that it made me feel better.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>From the sofa, I grabbed the first thing I could reach. It was a newspaper—the nation’s most reliable source, according to itself.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“<em>The Honest Quill</em>,” I read aloud.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The front page highlighted Deondra Walker, a rising star in the MACUSA from a highly-regarded family within the wizarding community—and top aurors, siblings Jihee and Jihun Park, the adult children of Yuna Park, Director of Magical Security. But these articles were abruptly replaced by breaking news—and the same picture from the wanted poster.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em>“ZIZA CHARGED AND AT LARGE! President Wyle calling for…”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p>I set the newspaper aside. A full-page ad—evidently ripped out of a magazine—was my next distraction. It starred a boy unwrapping a chocolate egg, which split in half to release a chocolate bird. The bird flew in circles until the boy stuck out his tongue for it to use as a kind of runway, and it promptly landed in his beaming mouth. </p>
<p>“<em>INTERATIVE! SAFE! FUN!</em>” flashed in vivid green and pink.</p>
<p>A box of these, modeled after a birdhouse, was on the table. The eggs could be seen through the little windows, wiggling or developing bumps as though pecked from the inside. One continued to wiggle after the others stopped, and I wondered what would happen if an engorgement charm was used on them. </p>
<p>As I rested my elbow on the sofa arm, I saw that what I’d mistaken for a magazine was a book with stunning art and bits of text that told a story. A comic. The plot seemed to follow the adventures of a giantess/witch couple. How intriguing…<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The white-fluff ball between the cushions had been dislodged by my movements. I stared as it shifted about until a pink nose hit the air.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>A baby bunny. How many pets did we have? </p>
<p>“Sorry, sweetie, I thought you were a tiny fuzzy pillow.” Or a chew toy. “Wouldn’t have disturbed you otherwise. Who left you on the sofa? You don’t want to get sat on, do you?” </p>
<p>We played for a while. I learned the bunny was enamored with blue roses, and the buds left on the table were likely for her.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>I soon found myself hypnotized by the broom painting again—or perhaps just by the idea of flying off. The broom had climbed higher, above a sheet of puffy white clouds in a night sky.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>But Amaranthia wasn’t to be ignored. “I put that there in case I felt like a change of scenery,” she said. “This way, I can hop right onto it. I was an excellent flier, you know.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>I was lucky <em>I</em> hadn’t tried hopping onto it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>It took Iana too long to return. When she finally did, holding a tall glass of pumpkin juice, it was to find my wand aimed steadily at her.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The way she froze up, I would’ve gotten the same result out of the Full-Body Bind. </p>
<p>“You could have conjured that,” I accused.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Indignant, Iana shouted, “I needed a moment!” But after several quick breaths, she regained her composure, disappointment overtaking the anger. “Take another look at the photographs—you haven’t, have you?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>I lowered my wand.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The proof was all around us—on the shelves, the walls, separate stands—and I was embarrassed to realize that, in my rapture at discovering what I considered to be the perfect wizarding home, I had dismissed dozens of photographs…most of which included me (apparently, Iana, Sunny, and I had been inseparable).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>We were everywhere.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Minuscule and wearing identical, near-painful expressions of excitement during what must have been our first year of school.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Playing Quidditch.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Flanking a pink-cheeked (and possibly pregnant with a giant) bride, our gowns sparkling. </p>
<p>Laughing, caught in their embrace, my wand raised toward the ceiling, confetti raining down on us.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Wearing pointed hats, grinning, cheek to cheek, our faces upturned in an aerial shot.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Grinning cheek to cheek, our faces upturned in an aerial shot.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>I gave the last a poke, watching as our photographic selves hid under our<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>pointed hats, which shook as we giggled.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Each photograph was uniquely framed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“I’m sorry,” I said, turning away from them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Here,” said Iana, handing me the pumpkin juice. Her hair and eyes had gone black again, though she didn’t acknowledge this—meaning I couldn’t either. “Let’s go into the kitchen.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The drink was just what I needed, and I was glad to see the glass refilling itself after I drained it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Iana had laid out a feast—the kitchen table had to be groaning. It smelled incredible; the food (including those bread rolls I’d glimpsed) still steamed. Mountains of burgers and chicken wings, several casseroles, enough ramen for half a dozen people, a giant dumpling larger than my head, and a couple of colorful dishes I couldn’t accurately name but identified as Latin American. I was afraid to ask, fearing my ignorance would upset her further—feeling certain I wouldn’t have needed to ask before.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“I was just about to start cooking when Sunny rushed in to tell me you were in danger…but by the time we got to you, it was too late.” </p>
<p>Trying not to wince at Iana’s deadened tone, I looked from the food to her. I wished I was hungry enough to eat everything. “Are you expecting guests?” Perhaps then I wouldn’t feel so guilty about having threatened her after she had done all of this.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Iana shook her head, shrugging. “I got carried away.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Curious to know what else happened when she “got carried away,” I did my best to taste a bit of everything, while Iana stuck to fire whiskey.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“You have a beautiful home.” It was a belated comment that, in hindsight, might’ve been better left unsaid.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“We did.” Iana’s glass, too, refilled itself.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>As I pulled apart a roll and searched for a response that wouldn’t sound like an apology, a photo on the windowsill caught my eye. The sharp-featured woman blinked at me.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Hey, she’s familiar!” I cried, pointing.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“That’s because,” said Iana wearily, “she was Sunny’s grandmother.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>I deflated. “Oh.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>They did have a strong resemblance.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Mingzhu Lin was one of Ilvermorny’s most celebrated headmistresses. She died before Sunny was born,” Iana added, sounding inexplicably bitter. </p>
<p>The feast was soon replaced with dessert. Large cakes, cupcakes, tarts, pies, puddings, ice cream, flan, egg tarts, towers of thick chocolate blocks, and fresh fruit.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>After a few more bites on my end, Iana and I stared at each other across the cleared table.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Thank you for my first meal, so to speak,” I said.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Iana tilted her head a little. “How was it?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Couldn’t have dreamed up a complaint for my life.”</p>
<p>She aimed a small smile at her folded hands. </p>
<p>“So, Iana…?” I prompted her.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Iana Owenna Tejada.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Iana Owenna Tejada, what do you do?” </p>
<p>“I work for Naisha Anand, Crowley’s potioneer—though Naisha would say ‘with’ her—and Sunny works at a Snidget sanctuary.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Potion-making was a horrid, unforgiving business, with the slimy and the gooey and the smelly and the formerly crawly. I admired Iana’s willingness to tackle it. Protecting Snidgets also sounded worthwhile…<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“And me? What do I do?” I asked. “How do I contribute?” </p>
<p>“You make sure everything is in order here.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Here…?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“In Crowley, in general. We all share the housework. You help out around town if asked or when it’s needed. We rely on each other.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>I found it a bit troubling that I didn’t seem to have a duty other than occupying the house and assisting neighbors in everyday things.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“What is it?” asked Iana, black eyes narrowing.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Well…I sound kind of…useless.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>At this, Iana studied her glass. “Did you see the chocolate eggs?” She nodded toward the wall separating the kitchen from the living room.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“They had a great ad,” I said. I was sure I’d seen more thrilling sweets, though.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“It was your idea,” Iana said, dumbfounding me. “We get them for free. Singwing chocolate is the richest you’ll ever taste. Two of Myra Singwing’s daughters are neighbors of ours. They were down about not having any new hit products, and you gave them the idea that inspired countless more—revitalized the company. You even receive a percent of the profits. They’re always coming around to ask you to try their newest creation.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>I thought for a minute. “Do they have a white chocolate version of those eggs?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Iana laughed. “You ate all the ones we had, but they’ll send more. There are tons of different flavors and versions now that they’ve become so popular.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>That was kind of nice.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>But Iana wasn’t finished. “Last year, you tracked down a witch who went missing. Her family left Crowley, but they still send gifts on holidays and birthdays.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>That...was a big jump from chocolate. “The woman—she’s okay?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“She’s doing great.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“So I really lived here with you. Wow.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Iana crossed her arms, glaring at me. “You live here, and you’re not going anywhere.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“A beautiful girl threatening to hold me hostage? I should brag to my parents…where do they live, anyway?” I was less casual about slipping that in than I would’ve liked. “It’s okay,” I said hurriedly, when Iana looked so crestfallen that I thought she might cry.<b> </b>“If they’re dead or something, well, I get to not remember that, so no need for details yet.” I’d added “yet” for a reason, though—I wasn’t going to let this go.</p>
<p>But Iana said sadly, “I don’t know. You didn’t want us to know...you refused to discuss it.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>It was disturbing to be dependent on other people for information about your own life. Iana—and likely Sunny—knew far more than I did. And if I had kept things from them, how would I ever regain those secrets? Were I to seek them out myself, how would I be sure I wasn’t being manipulated—around and away from the truth?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>And if I hadn’t trusted them before…</p>
<p>“Um—could you share anything else about me?” I asked distractedly as Iana’s expression became concerned. </p>
<p>“You had a pen pal from the Philippines,” she said. “That just occurred to me. The two of you decided to never meet but always write, no matter what. It started as part of a school program. No one else kept up with it, but of course you did…”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“When’d we stop?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Should be getting a letter from her next month. She’s actually in Singapore right now, you told me…”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Uncomfortable for some reason, I shifted the conversation to magic.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Any problems?” asked Iana.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>I saved my humiliation and horror about the failed Patronus for another time—optimistically, never—saying nothing to confirm or deny.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“I assume not,” Iana said. “As you saw with the Mending Charm, your wand has always been an extension of yourself, more threaded to your instincts than to your thoughts. But something you should be aware of is that you’re ambidextrous—”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>A series of rapid <em>BANG</em>s erupted outside. The curtained windows revealed no disturbance.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Just our neighbors,” Iana said dismissively. However, she’d jerked in her seat, and her wand had slid into her hand. It disappeared back into her sleeve before I could get a better look, but I did notice that it was much shorter and fiercer in appearance than mine. Iana got to her feet. “It’s late. I’m going to go find Sunny and bring her home.”</p>
<p>However, Iana surprised me by returning as quickly as she went—with a present. Flat and square, the reflective wrapping paper glinting.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“You wrapped this yourself, by hand, for Sunny. It’s a Guzman piece. Expensive, but we have the Dragots…” Iana sighed. “You were so excited when it was delivered yesterday.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>I gave it a slight squeeze. Whatever was in there—Iana remained tight-lipped—it was soft.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Please give it to Sunny once she returns,” Iana said.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“What’s the occasion?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“The anniversary of the day you met her.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>At the door, she paused. “Don’t be too nice to her, okay? It’ll be…overwhelming for her. Some distance might help.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“After I give her the present, should I drop something on the floor and tell her to pick it up?” I joked, wanting to lighten the moment.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“No, that might excite her,” Iana said seriously.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Sorry?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“It could give her the wrong idea. Like you’re playing a game, you know.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>I frowned. “Did—do I play a lot of games?” </p>
<p>“When you’re in the mood.” </p>
<p>“So it wouldn’t be weird for me to be mean to her?” I pressed, trying to understand. Iana’s face gave nothing away.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Really, truly mean? You’d never pull it off. With others, if necessary, yes—but not Sunny.” Iana shrugged. “When I give up, you…stay.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>But what did that mean? “Give up?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Although I love her to pieces, she can be difficult.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“I don’t think I’m the same,” I said. “I feel like giving up already.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Well, don’t,” Iana said simply.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>She left me among the chimes, some floating candles and the fireplace lit.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Amaranthia dozed, the radio’s murmur my only company. </p>
<p>I fell asleep in an armchair, the present in my lap, staring at the broom painting. I stared at it so long, the broom zoomed out of its frame and knocked me in the stomach.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>A black, quaffle-sized cat had pounced onto me, wrenching me out of the dream. At least, I thought it was a cat—the creature had large green eyes and cat-like ears, but no visible nose or mouth…until it stuck its tongue out to lick what I assumed was its nose.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>So this pointy-eared fur cloud was Harriet.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>As I straightened, rubbing my stomach, Sunny collapsed into the other armchair. It seemed she had returned on her own. </p>
<p>
  <em>“President Wyle today announced…”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em>
</p>
<p>I waved my wand at the radio and the sound lowered to a barely perceptible buzz.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>I cleared my throat. “Sunny? This is for you…” I was anxious to see what it was myself.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Sunny unwrapped with trembling fingers…what turned out to be a black traveling cloak. I was stumped—why would I have been looking forward to giving her a simple cloak?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Sunny quickly pulled it on. She didn’t seem eager to talk, and I wasn’t eager to push her.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Amaranthia sighed exaggeratedly, opening the eye that wasn’t buried in her pillow. “You’ll have to go outside if you wish to see the full effect.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>What? Would she levitate or something?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Sunny and I ran into the night, leaving the door open behind us.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Look!” I gasped. “Shooting stars! Oh—it’s reflecting the sky! It’s like...like you’re made of them. It really suits you. Would be pretty cool on a broom…”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Sunny’s eyes also mirrored the stars as she raised her sleeves to study them. Her hands went to her heart and stayed there. Tears slid down her cheeks as she gazed up at the very sky she was wearing.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Was that emotion for the last gift from the Sanwyn she knew? Or was it more complicated?</p>
<p>“I—um—would you like a hug?” I said, even though it went against Iana’s advice.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>I managed to spread my arms just in time to catch her as she flung herself at me. Eventually, she stopped trembling.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>We decided to wait inside for Iana. Sunny sat in the armchair again, hugging herself—hugging the cloak.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>A piece of parchment, folded into an airplane shape, floated in through one of the windows on either side of the door. It stopped over Sunny’s head, going point-down to tap her hair.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“What…” I began. </p>
<p>But Sunny merely tucked it away without glancing at it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Harriet swiped at a chime with a grubby sort of look, giving me an idea.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The idea was to close the tiny instrument within Sunny’s fist. It started to hum, and as long as it was in her grasp, the others echoed its gentle song. Taking another singing chime between two fingers, I strung it to Vil’s leg, instructing him to deliver it to Iana. Vil departed through an open skylight I hadn’t previously noticed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Iana returned minutes later, chime in hand. Curious, I asked her about the odd parchment that flew in.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Must be someone from town,” she sighed. “It’s a messaging system we have in Crowley that a No-Maj-born thought of…”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>It took a patient effort on Iana’s part to convince Sunny to take off the cloak. Iana wasn’t surprised to learn how it worked. </p>
<p>“You called it a practical gift—a ‘cloaking device,’” said Iana, yawning. “I called you a secret softie.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>It was long past time to turn in.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Beside the kitchen, a wide hallway presented several doors.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The sole bedroom had only one (enormous) bed, which Iana told me we shared. She and Sunny watched me take in the place where I’d been sleeping since we were seventeen.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The photographs here were larger and more intimate. Sunny in a night slip, peering through a window at a calm ocean that seemed just beyond the wall. Me, jumping from a flying motorcycle onto a broom as it sped by, disappearing from the photo and trusting Iana to handle the bike—which she did expertly. My eyes stopped at a few discolored places on the wall, places that seemed recently bare, and I suspected—without voicing the suspicion—that a photo or two had been hastily removed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>There was a full-length mirror.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Was that tall, voluptuous woman really me?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Well, hello there,” the mirror said in its seductive, feminine rasp.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>It made me laugh when there wasn’t much else to laugh about.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>And then I saw my leg protruding from the side slit in my robes. </p>
<p>Silvery. Stopping just above the knee like a single stocking. Perfectly matching my other leg.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>A gleaming magical prosthetic.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“How?” I said dully. “When?”</p>
<p>“When you were very young,” said Iana softly. “For as long as we’ve known you. It would have been before Ilvermorny. Maybe years before.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The ‘how’ was not answered.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“But it is—functional?” I said. </p>
<p>“It’s never given you trouble,” Iana said.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The room no longer interested me, but as I didn’t plan to enter it again, I thought I might as well get a good look.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>In the closet were cloaks, dress robes, No-Maj clothing, shoes, and a plain backpack that Iana explained contained our old school trunks, still not unpacked. The backpack had been used in the past as part of a convincing No-Maj disguise while traveling.</p>
<p>Iana gestured at a closed door, remarking, “We keep the Pensieve there.” <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>But I hardly heard her. At some point Iana had changed into a tight, silky dressing gown that emphasized the curves and plateaus of her body. Sunny, near the bed, was willowy in a<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>revealing, sheer design.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>I glanced away. “Could I sleep on the sofa? This is a private space. One that I don’t feel…welcomes me.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Iana laughed mirthlessly. “How strange this must be for you. Of course you can. But it’s always open to you. All of it—everything.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>We said goodnight, and soon I was pacing back and forth across the fireplace. Just how many times had I been attacked in the life I couldn’t remember?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>I blinked down in surprise to see my wand gripped in my numb hand, spitting red and gold sparks. I put it down, though not out of reach.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Good call,” said Amaranthia. “It’s best not to arm yourself in moments like these. Your anger, while understandable, may lead to something not easily reversed.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Thanks,” I said ungratefully, using the folded blankets and clothes Iana and Sunny had given me as an excuse to turn my back on her.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>I settled in, prepared for a long night…<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Someone was crying in the dark. Bleary-eyed, I followed the sound, initially unsure of what I was hearing, but the closer I got, the more obvious it was. </p>
<p>The bedroom door was open. </p>
<p>Iana held Sunny as they both cried, sitting in bed with their heads bowed, the cat curled on a freed pillow behind them. </p>
<p>Only Iana could be heard—Sunny’s weeping silent—and I gave them the privacy they deserved. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>I was awakened twice more.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>A voice shouted, “Don’t bring that winged rat back here until he looks properly miserable!” Eyes stubbornly closed, I pointed my wand—kept under my pillow—in the direction of the windows and turned over after they slammed shut. But then I seemed to hit something.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>It was Sunny, her body somehow squeezed between me and the backrest, a quaffle-sized black cloud purring on her head. Iana half-sat, half-lied on the floor, snoring lightly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Not ready to deal with the scene, yet completely at ease for the first time, I went back to sleep.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The second disruption was an odd weight on my eyelid. When my fingers attempted to find what was on my face, a butterfly took flight.</p>
<p>I jumped at the sight of two more butterflies fluttering on Sunny’s lashes as she blinked.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>We stared at each other.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>We had switched places somehow so that I was against the back of the sofa, and she was in danger of rolling off the edge. To prevent a fall, I gripped her shoulders.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>But recalling Iana’s request, I whispered, “Don’t do this again, Sunny, okay?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>After a glum nod, she escaped to the bedroom. Hopefully to change rather than to cry again, or I would break and beg for forgiveness.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>I looked down. Iana’s spot was empty.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The sheet of clouds in the broom painting had turned fiery, night becoming day. Did it change according to the time—even the weather?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Furious whispering reached my ears. </p>
<p>“Let them get rid of each other…it’s not for us to handle. She’s all that matters. We’re all that matters.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>I stiffened, but didn’t look toward the hallway. What was Iana talking about?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>One thing was certain: they both knew more than they were saying.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Over breakfast, as I persuaded Sunny to eat, she accidentally knocked over a pitcher of butterbeer. </p>
<p>Sunny let out a string of hisses. </p>
<p>I stared at her. “I’m very sure you just cursed.” Pausing to replay the sounds in my head, I said suddenly, “Snake language. You’re a Parselmouth.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Sunny had refused Iana’s every invitation to talk—in English, anyway.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Sunny, please, not this again!” Iana shouted exasperatedly. The bellflower color had not made a comeback, her bloodshot eyes and disheveled hair blacker than ever.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Nibbling on a muffin, I petted the bunny—Bluerose, named by Sunny for her love of the flower—taking much-needed comfort and meaning to give the same. Bluerose pressed her face into my palm, no more eager to be part of the discussion than I was.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Sunny, having had enough, abandoned her half-eaten oatmeal for the living room. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Iana gazed after her. “She used to be like this, not speaking. Our first year at Ilvermorny, everyone thought she didn’t know how. She shuts down when she doesn’t want to communicate. A kind of selective mutism. I’d normally come to you, but now…” Her faraway stare turned dark. “Only Parseltongue was acceptable where Sunny lived—if you could call it living. She’d joke that her fondest experience was being thrown into a basement with a Runespoor…before two of the heads ripped off the third.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>I was forced to put my muffin down, sickened.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“I didn’t know then, of course,” said Iana miserably. “And while I set her back by losing my temper, you gradually won her over. Once she felt safe, she grew confident. I never thought she’d regress.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Yesterday,” I said, “could something have happened to her? To push her into this state?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Iana shook her head. “She’s upset about what’s happened to <em>you</em>. What’s been…lost.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>She wasn’t alone.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>I placed a sleepy Bluerose on the windowsill. “Do we have more pets?” I asked absently.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Those loud bangs last night? Our neighbor is either working on a new invention or reworking an old one. Our house is right across theirs, so a lot of their many, many pets—from cute to ugly-cute to hideous—end up on our doorstep when they inevitably flee. It’ll be why the latest addition to our pet family—” Iana gave Bluerose’s fuzzy head a pat. “—was hiding under our mat last week. We find most of them new homes, but we’ve gotten attached to a few. Deus is the only one we got from the woods and Vil you got for Ilvermorny. We had a puffskein that we bought from town—Harold—but we got tired of needing clothespins for our noses to avoid its tongue. As for the cat…”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Her voice was almost drowned out by squealing and giggling marshmallows that squirmed in a bowl—a bowl that was being eyed by Harriet.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Quit taunting the cat, or I’ll turn you into cotton balls,” threatened Iana. “And you’ll never feel the delight of being toasted. The cat might growl like one, but she’s no dragon—no fire breath.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>I stood, reaching for a plate of fruits—I’d require a peace offering. “I’m going to try to talk to Sunny.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“You had house elves, growing up.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>My hand fell back to my side.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“So it could be presumed that you had a comfortable childhood,” continued Iana tonelessly, her fists clenching on the table. “Yet, caught in the middle of a duel between two of your family, you were hit by a curse. Innocent, but unlucky. One fixed what the other had done, and the incident was buried. I gathered this from what you screamed during your nightmares after witnessing a girl get splinched. You were the first in our class to master Apparition, because it terrified you.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“What else?” I whispered urgently. She couldn’t stop there.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“I think, your father…there was something very bad there. One day you were out shopping and saw a man who looked similar to him. You disappeared for a month, San. Reappeared with no idea where you’d been. It nearly took you another month to stop shaking. I think…I think you were running. Running away. And you hadn’t stopped—not to rest, not to eat. You showed up at our door, said, ‘There were bellflowers,’ and fainted. Spotting some had jolted you into Apparating home, because you associated them with me.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“In school and after we graduated, I paid close attention to what you’d say—sometimes you’d let facts slip that I was able to put together. But I don’t have any answers. I understood there were things you never wanted us to know. I accepted it when you said you needed to protect us. Maybe I shouldn’t have. But I’ll make you this promise, San: if we stick together, we can survive anything.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Halting in the doorway, I asked, “What happened? With the Runespoor?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Sunny wasn’t let out until it died.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>I wished I hadn’t asked.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Seated in the throne-like chair, Sunny had flattened a wrinkled but clean white cloth on the desk. A handkerchief?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>I placed the fruit on the desk.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Sunny? Are you okay?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>She tilted her head to send me a singing glare that asked how she could possibly be okay—and her wand attacked the air. The wand was elaborately carved, graceful and a worthy match for her. A regal snake head made up the handle, and I realized the entire wand was in the form of a snake.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>My name formed in burning letters. Then Sunny slashed the air and a flaming line crossed it out before line and name faded. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>It was true. I wasn’t Sanwyn anymore. Not really.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Sunny gazed down at the handkerchief as a tear splattered onto it. Inky letters appeared where the tear had made contact, and I could only gape.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em>Heart of memories-that-were</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>But are no more</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Dust-filled but unbroken</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>May she find again what is hers</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>And return herself to us</em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p>Sunny pulled quill and parchment to her, writing, <em>“I cry easily, but I can’t always express my emotions, and that frustrates not just me but everyone around me. You gave me this. Made it for me. In case I ever lost my way or my voice again.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em></p>
<p>“The words…are about me?” I asked, still gaping.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Sunny nodded.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>We said no more.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Iana, processing her own distress, kept Deus close—I glimpsed him throughout the day on her shoulder, on her finger, cupped in her hands, being petted (and complaining if the petting stopped).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Vil was given his fair share of affection, but wasn’t confined as much as Deus, often out flying.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Sunny read book after book with the cat on her head, Harriet’s face dipping as if to read along.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>My own lap was taken by Bluerose, who could easily be imagined stamping it with her puff of a tail: <em>Mine.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em></p>
<p>“We have a second room—I do my potion work there,” Iana said, her arms full of items retrieved from the bedroom and a hall closet. “I’ll set up a cot for you. No more sleeping on the sofa.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>I thanked Iana for being such a good friend, but she actually shuddered. “How horrible…I need to take a shower so I can wash that word off.” (I was unlikely to utter the word “friend” in her presence again, for fear that she would vomit on me, just as she had threatened.)<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Iana also informed me that she and Sunny would both be taking a leave of absence from their jobs. I felt guilty for being relieved when my protests were shot down. </p>
<p>As I tasked myself with vanishing a shocking amount of animal droppings, I felt a renewed rush of appreciation for magic. I did not envy No-Maj pet owners, who were unable to resort to magical means. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Occasionally, Iana, Sunny, myself, and the pets bumped into a chime (or they bumped into us), generating brief, sweet songs, until I was able to distinguish who they each belonged to. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>It was on the third day that I heard a new song from the chimes, with a longer echo. Sunny and I converged in the living room—she from the bedroom and I from the bathroom—to find Iana pacifying a thin blonde woman who was swinging something through the air.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Iana gently untangled a piece of parchment from our shouting guest’s fist.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Can you believe this? This is what my son spends his time doing! No wonder he was expelled from school!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Over Iana’s shoulder, I saw that it was a simple outline of a female continuously toppled by her oversized breasts. Standing, falling, standing, falling.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>That was certainly something one might see at Ilvermorny, or any school enrolling adolescents—and the otherwise “young”.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“It could be worse,” said Iana dryly. “He could be a better artist.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Lifted into the air, the parchment was promptly vaporized. The witch pocketed her wand.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“I have to say, Kesper…the spelling errors in that apology letter you forced him to send us were atrocious,” said Iana.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“That boy can never get away with using a regular quill,” sighed Kesper. “He doesn’t claim to be smart, merely innocent.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“San did get him a spell-correcting quill last year…” Iana said, surprising me.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Kesper shook her head. “Snapped it in one of his fits before it ever saw ink—even mended, it wasn’t the same. And I had him write that apology letter at wand point, so he was, I admit…a bit twitchy, at the time.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Good for you,” chuckled Iana. “And good for him, too.” Iana handed Kesper a quill in clear, crackly packaging. “Here—Truthquill. Anti-Lying. These burn away written lies. From now on, he can write out his innocence until it stays on the page.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>I retreated to the bathroom before I could be noticed by the visitor, not ready to meet a stranger who wasn’t a stranger, not ready for questions that would require lies. Iana had suggested that if anyone asked, it would be best if I feigned memory loss from a head injury, and I had agreed. But I was in no mood for a performance. </p>
<p>A letter arrived in a great horned owl’s beak at lunch. </p>
<p>“Afternoon, Sakura,” said Iana, checking the envelope as Sunny fetched the tired owl a treat. “It’s from Gen—Gen Kubo. She was a couple years ahead of us in Ilvermorny and you’re still good friends. She’s a reporter at <em>The Honest Quill</em> now. Her daughter was born two months ago. She’s probably going to demand a visit…”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Iana was correct—it was short and to the point:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em>Sanwyn “Please Don’t Call Me Salmon” Arcana! My sweet daughter misses you. </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Come rain affection and blessings on your godchild—or else! </em>
  </p>
  <p><br/>
