          <div class="userstuff"><p>Our story starts after one of Oliver Wood's Quidditch matches, his long-term boyfriend Percy Weasley is visiting.</p><p>Oliver asked, "What did you make of the match?"</p><p>Percy grinned. "It was amazing. You're amazing."</p><p>Oliver chuckled. "I could hear you cheering from the other end of the pitch, Perce."</p><p>Percy blushed. "I'm you're number one fan, remember?"</p><p>Oliver smirked. "Well, Mr. Number One Fan; what do you plan to do with me?"</p><p>Percy said, "I was thinking of a picnic on the pitch if that's allowed."</p><p>Oliver rolled his eyes. "How many times have I told you that rules were made to be broken?"</p><p>Percy sighed. "I don't like to though."</p><p>Oliver promised, "We'll check first then."</p><p>Percy smiled slightly. "No need because I tricked you."</p><p>Oliver inquired, "You tricked me?"</p><p>Percy told him, "I already asked, but I thought you might need a good laugh."</p><p>Oliver beamed, "You're the best boyfriend ever, after that dire match I did need some cheering up. It came in the form of you."</p><p>Percy insisted, "Come on, we have to move quickly."</p><p>He pulled Oliver to the centre of the now deserted pitch. A blanket and basket sat there with dozens of floating candles around them.</p><p>Oliver gasped. "It's beautiful."</p><p>Percy went quiet suddenly.</p><p>Oliver touched his hand and muttered, "Is something wrong, Perce?"</p><p>Percy grinned. "I was just thinking, that's all."</p><p>Oliver smirked. "Merlin, we're in trouble if you're thinking."</p><p>Percy snorted. "Very funny, but I was being serious."</p><p>Oliver smiled broadly. "I know, everyone knows what you plan on asking me."</p><p>Percy guessed, "Skeeter?"</p><p>Oliver nodded.</p><p>Percy replied, "Well, I'll ask anyway. Would you do me the honour of becoming my husband?"</p><p>Oliver exclaimed, "Of course!"</p></div>
