  <b>Chapter 1 - Finally, Some Peace</b>
</p><p>
  <b>Tuesday 6 July 1993</b>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry groans as he moves too fast. His uncle had gotten to him because he had screamed during a nightmare, something that seems to have been happening every night. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He shifts his body so that he can see the whole park, which is currently empty of all other inhabitants. He </span>
  <em>
    <span>is</span>
  </em>
  <span> the only person that goes to that park afterall. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>However, something isn't right. He can feel somebody watching him, putting him on edge. He scans the area slowly and sees it. Sees him. A huge black dog is watching him. He is laying on the ground at the base of a tree on the far edge of the park.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He turns away and pulls the pocket knife out of his jeans. It is small, no longer than his pinkie finger, but it is enough to help him keep his mind off of everything. He places the knife against the thin skin of his wrist and lightly drag it in a line parallel to the previous cuts that he had made. The blood is warm as it makes its way down his arm and he smiles a little at the pain that he causes.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Finally, some peace.</span>
  </em>
  <span> He thinks, closing his eyes. The dog whining brings him away from the dark thought. He is standing right in front of him with sad eyes drilling into his own. Harry stands and stumbles to get away from the dog, walking slowly to Number 4 Privet Drive. The dog follows but he just shuts the door in his face to get away.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <b>Later That Night</b>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius couldn’t believe his eyes when he saw how his Godson was faring after 12 years. He was much too thin, the clothes hanging off of him like an oversized second skin. He winced when he moved, as if he were in a recent fight. Also, he was cutting. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius had struggled with cutting for a long time, so he would not let his Godson do the same. So he followed him to his home and he would wait until night to enter the home.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>After the moon had risen, Sirius transformed back into a human. He went to the back door and snapped his fingers to get the door to unlock. He slipped inside and followed the feeling of a Magical mass to a door that seemed to lead to a room under the stairs. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sirius got the door open and peered inside to see a trunk with the words </span>
  <em>
    <span>Hadrian James Fleamont William Potter</span>
  </em>
  <span> proudly stamped on the front in gold letters. He pulled the trunk out and searched through it to find Harry’s wand. Then he shrunk the trunk and placed it into his pockets. After noting that everything else seemed to be worthless, Sirius headed up the stairs. The room that pulled at him was covered in a dozen locks. Sirius snapped his fingers and heard each lock click open. The door creaked as he pushed it open. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry seemed to still be sleeping, so Sirius covered Harry’s mouth and shook him. Harry’s eyes flashed open and he tried to scream but no sound escaped him. “Scream and I’ll have to silence you!” Sirius threatened. Harry nodded and blinked as tears appeared in his eyes. “Do you have anything of value besides your trunk downstairs?” Sirius slowly removed his hand and watched as tears escaped Harry’s eyes. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Probably not the best start to a relationship, but we’ll work it out eventually.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“My cloak and photo album,” Harry whispered. Sirius motioned with his hands and Harry slowly climbed out of his bed. He pulled up a loose floorboard and pulled his invisibility cloak and photo album from beneath the floor. Sirius took the album and shrunk it before placing it in his pocket. Then he placed a silencing spell on Harry, followed by a sleeping spell and featherlight charm. Sirius picked up Harry and wrapped the cloak around them both. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <b>Wednesday 7 July 1993</b>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry wakes up in the softest bed that he has ever slept in. The mattress seems to swallow him and the blanket is warm and soft against his skin. He sits up slowly and looks around. The maroon curtains around the bed are tied back with golden, silk ribbons. The walls are pale purple and the dresser, wardrobe, desk, doors, and window seat are a wood so dark, them appear black. Harry climbs out of the bed and approaches the first door and pulls.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nothing happens. The door knob doesn’t turn at all. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Going to the second door, Harry is pleasantly surprised to see a huge bathroom. The tiles are dark green and the shower is like a waterfall. He leaves the bathroom and goes to the dresser. It is filled with pajamas, socks, pants, and under shirts that look to be his size. The wardrobe is filled with robes, dress shirts, dress trousers, and casual clothes that also seem to be in his size. Next to the wardrobe is his trunk. He opens it and all his clothes are gone as are his books. However he remembers the desk by the window and sees his books set up on the desk. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Who set up this room? Why do all the clothes seem to look my size? Are they going to leave me in here forever? Are they going to let me go to Hogwarts? </span>
  </em>
  <span>A popping sound draws him away from his thoughts. A house elf is standing in front of his bed on the purple rug that matches the walls. He is holding a piece of parchment and Harry approaches him. “Hello, who are you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m Kreacher. I was ordered to give this to you,” the house elf, Kreacher, says while holding out the parchment. As soon as he has it Kreacher disappears. Harry opens the letter and reads it slowly:</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Dear Hadrian, </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>I know that you are probably scared, but don’t be. I would never hurt you. I made a promise to Lily and James that I would look after you and protect you. Pretty shite job I’ve been doing so far, huh? </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Anyways, this is your room. I’ve set it up just for you. The clothes should fit, but tell me if they don’t or if you don’t like them. Also, if you don’t like the colours, I can easily change them. That goes for the bedroom as well. Shower and get dressed. I’ll be up in an hour so that I can bring you to breakfast.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Your Godfather.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Sirius Black</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>P.S. Your cloak and album are in the desk drawer. I’ll be keeping your wand and knife until I am sure that you won’t try to hurt yourself or me.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The writing is loopy and neater than Harry’s will ever be, but he understands what Sirius is telling him. He hurries to shower and pauses when he goes to get dressed. He doesn’t want to wear the wrong thing, but Sirius didn’t tell him what to wear. He decides on a pair of black jeans and a green shirt. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Who cares? He’ll probably kill me like those other innocent people he killed! He broke out of prison and he knows my name! I wonder if the Wizarding world knows that I’m gone….</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>He has time to kill, so he goes to the desk and reads the titles. Only a fraction of the books are his, the other being too advanced or an older edition. The door opens and Harry sees a cleaned up version of the man that had taken him. Before, Sirius had long hair and a five o’clock shadow along with loose fitting clothes. Now, he had cut his hair and shaved his face, making him look decades younger. The clothes he was wearing were also clean and made to fit. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hello Harry,” Sirius greeted, sitting on the bed while Harry stood and edged away from the man. “I didn’t want to have our first meeting be so terrifying for you, but I had to get you away from your relatives.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How did you know my parents?” Harry asked, continuing to inch away.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“James was like a brother to me. His family took me in when I had nowhere else to go,’ Sirius replied, a haunted look in his face. “Are you hungry? I’m going to make breakfast. You can help if you like?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sure….” </span>
  <em>
    <span>I can escape while he is cooking. Maybe if I do as he says, he won’t hurt me and I can find police.</span>
  </em>
  <span> Sirius stood and left the room. Harry followed, trying to get his bearings of the place. Needless to say, the place was huge so he would have trouble finding the door even if Sirius didn’t make a wall in front of it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You like eggs, bacon, and grits?” Sirius asked, making Harry realize that they had entered the kitchen. </span>
  <em>
    <span>I have to focus! He could have been trying to kill me!</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah.” Harry looked around the room until Sirius placed a pot with water and tin of grits in his hands. Harry approached the stove and began to make the grits. Sirius made the eggs and bacon right next to him while keeping up a steady chatter going that went into one of Harry’s ears and out the other. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Once the food was done, Sirius made them both plates and placed them at the table. He let Harry choose which plate he wanted to eat from then sat at the other. They ate in silence until they finished. Harry had only eaten the grits, not bothering to touch the eggs or bacon that was provided.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Alright, time to explain some things and set some rules,” Sirius began, weaving his fingers together. Harry watched him warily, not wanting to be lied to. “I took you so that I could help you. I don’t want you to die and, as you should know, Voldemort is after you. He has spies everywhere, I can’t let you be unprepared when the time comes for you two to fight.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Where were you before?” Harry growled. Sirius’ eyes had nothing but truth in them, but Harry didn’t quite believe him yet.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“In Azkaban for a crime I didn’t commit.” At Harry’s confused face, he elaborated. “Azkaban is a prison that they send you to for all kinds of crimes. A man named Peter Pettigrew framed me for the murder of 12 muggles, plus himself, and getting your parents killed.” </span>
  <em>
    <span>He was on the Muggle news too! They would know if he was framed. Sirius must be lying.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“He got my parents killed?” Harry’s anger turned from Sirius to this unknown man. </span>
  <em>
    <span>I would know, Dumbledore would tell me, right?</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“Your parents went into hiding, only Pettigrew could tell others where to find them. We pretended that I was their Secret Keeper to keep the attention away from him. However, he was Voldemort’s spy all along. He even made us doubt Remus Lupin’s loyalty.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So you, Dad, Pettigrew, and Remus were all friends?” Harry had never heard of these people, but he had seen Sirius Black’s name on the Quidditch plaque that had his own Father’s name on it. They were both Chasers.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The closest group of friends that you could find.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So you got released from Azkaban?” Harry fidgeted in his seat. </span>
  <em>
    <span>If he answers truthfully, it’ll help me determine the truth level of his other answers. If he lies, I’ll have to escape immediately. </span>
  </em>
  <span>“You are going to raise me now?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I escaped. I’m going to help you get strong.” Sirius felt his face flush in embarrassment at his admission, but he wouldn’t lie to Harry. “Now for the rules. No lying, you can say that you don’t want to talk about it but I won’t get lied to. In return, I won’t lie to you. Rule number two, no harming yourself or others. That is the only rule, that when broken, will result in a physical punishment.” Harry felt his face pale and hoped that Sirius wouldn’t notice. People use your fears against you. “Rule three, if I tell you to do something, I expect you to do it immediately. Only if you are confused or feel that you can’t do it should you talk to me and I will decide what to do, alright?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Okay….Is that all?” Harry pulled his sleeves down to cover his wrists even if he knew it was extremely unlikely that Sirius hadn’t already seen the cuts. He didn’t want to be hurt, not after the beating his Uncle gave him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No. I need you to stop cutting-” Harry’s heart almost stopped when he heard the words tumble from Sirius’ mouth. “-because I care about you. If you ever feel the urge to cut, use this mirror to talk and I will always pick up to speak to you.” Sirius passed over a circular mirror and seemed to have a matching one on the table with him. “Just say my name and tap it with your hand, and I will appear.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry took the mirror, placed it into his pocket, and followed Sirius when he stood up. </span>
  <em>
    <span>I won’t use it. Maybe I can call other people? I won’t use it. He could scare my enemies. I won’t use it.</span>
  </em>
  <span> The thoughts waged a war in his mind and he felt a head ache coming on.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry was led to a room near the kitchen. Entering the room, Harry felt a rush of Magic that made him a little nauseous. He tried to back out of the room, but Sirius grabbed a hold of him to stop him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Leaving will make it worse. The first time you enter and exit are the hardest but it will get easier.” Sirius looked around, tapped a stone with his wand, then closed the door. A timer appeared on the door that seemed to be moving way slower than it should be.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Where are we?” Harry asked, sitting down to settle his stomach.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“This is a training room. Time slows down in this room. One year in this room equals one full day outside the room, so an hour outside of this room is about 15 days inside. However, we will only be training for 12 hours a day as we will take an hour for lunch and dinner, you will have an hour in the morning to get ready and eat breakfast, and I expect you to get nine hours of sleep. Here is our schedule,” Sirius finished by waving his arm, making a parchment appear.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>7 AM - Wake up, shower, get dressed, eat breakfast</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>8 AM - Training</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>12 PM - Lunch</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>1 PM - Training</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>6 PM - Dinner </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>7 PM - Training</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>10 PM - Bedtime</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What about talking to my friends and doing homework?” Harry protested at the schedule. </span>
  <em>
    <span>He could keep me in here for the rest of the summer and I wouldn’t know the difference!</span>
  </em>
  <span> “And a bedtime?” Harry knew that arguing with your guardians only got you in trouble, but Sirius had said that only harming himself or others would get him physically punished.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t expect you to take an entire hour to eat. Once you finish, you may write to your friends and you will do homework in this room when I tell you to. The bedtime is so that you get enough sleep.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Won’t I be really old when I return to school?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Your body ages slower so that it matches how old you would be when outside. You will only age mentally and magically at a normal rate.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fine!” Harry crossed his arms over his chest and stood up. He knew that he was acting childishly but he didn’t care. “What are we starting with?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We are going to go over everything you have learned in school so far-” Harry groaned but Sirius ignored him. “-as you should be able to do everything wandless and silent. After that, I will start teaching you new skills, okay?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sure.” Harry was upset, but his eyes lit up when he saw Sirius take out his wand and reach out to him. “My wand?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You will show me the spell I ask you to perform. If they seem strong enough, then you will move onto trying them silently. After you get that down, you will try wandless. Lastly, you will combine the two so that you can do the spell wandless and silent.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How will you know if they are strong or not?” Sirius stared at Harry with raised eyebrows so Harry elaborated. “Like sheilds, how will you know they are strong?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll try to stun you.” Harry gasped and got to work.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>By the time lunch rolled around, Harry was exhausted. Sirius let him take a nap once they got back to the room while he went to gather some books from the library. After that, they worked until dinner. The time after dinner was spent researching so that he could do his homework to an acceptable level.</span>
