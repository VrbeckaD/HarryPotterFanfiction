    <p>1990</p><p>When Harry was ten, Bill Weasley came home to visit on a motorcycle. Mrs. Weasley, after a lot of shouting and fretting, let him take Ron for a ride around the block.</p><p>Harry watched the motorcycle take the corner, the rear tire stuttering, and heard Ron’s delighted squeal. He turned to Mrs. Weasley, who was practically wringing her hands as she watched them go out of sight down the adjacent street. The motorcycle was sleek and modern-looking, with a quiet engine, and Bill had to lean far forward to reach the handlebars.
</p>
<p>
“Can I go next, Mrs. Weasley? <em>Please</em>.” Harry begged.</p><p>Mrs. Weasley frowned down at him. “Not without your parents saying it’s okay, Harry.”

</p>
<p>His heart leapt. “Can I go call them?”</p><p>“No, no, honey. They’ll be back this afternoon and you can ask then. Bill isn’t going anywhere til tomorrow.”</p><p>Harry was anxious all the rest of the day, and when his parents came in, he was out the door of the Burrow and into the yard before they could even park.</p><p>“Mom! Dad! Bill has a motorbike!”

</p>
<p>“That’s nice, Harry,” said Dad, while Mom grimaced.</p><p>“He’ll take me for a ride if you say it’s okay!”

</p>
<p>Dad hesitated, but before he could say anything Mom had said, “<em>Absolutely not</em>.”</p><p>Harry knew better than to argue with <em>that</em> tone. But he did let all his heartbreak shine in his eyes as he looked up at her. She bit her lip, but didn’t budge. “I’m sorry, Harry, but <em>no</em>.”</p><p>Then she turned to get Annie out of her carseat.</p><p>Dad patted Harry consolingly on the head. “They’re dangerous, kiddo.”

</p>
<p>In demonstration, Bill totaled the bike later that night and though he was fine, he didn’t get another one. Still, Harry never forgot the romance of the motorcycle. It was ordinary for boys to love them, but even as he grew up, he’d look up expectantly when he heard the telltale whine of a bike’s engine. It was only out of respect for his Mum he never rode one—well, that and the chance never presented itself again.</p><p>Until it did.</p><hr/><p>1998</p><p>Graduation was bittersweet for Harry. He was excited to spend the night out with his friends, and even had his parents’ indirect permission to stay out late (“Just come in the basement door and crash in the guest room,” his dad had murmured while his mom pretended not to hear.) </p><p>But he couldn’t shake the feeling that something was about to come to an end, and he wasn’t sure what was going to take its place.</p><p>He kept his feelings under control pretty well until several hours after the ceremony, when he and his friends were in Dean’s parents’ basement, toasting one another’s futures. When it was Harry’s turn to receive well-wishes, Dean squinted at him over the rim of his bottle.</p><p>“And Harry! What’s Harry doing?”</p><p>“Harry is figuring things out,” Ron offered.</p><p>“It’s very responsible,” Hermione added. “He shouldn’t invest in a degree program until he’s identified a career path.”</p><p>Harry smiled gratefully at her, but it was still hard to reconcile his serious-minded friend with the girl sitting cross-legged on the kitchenette counter, holding an empty shot glass. Since her last exam, Hermione had embraced the philosophy of “work hard, play hard” that she’d championed all through their school years to an impressive new degree.</p><p>“Any ideas, though?”

</p>
<p>Harry shrugged. “Nah.”</p><p>Dean blinked. “But you’re not just staying at the garage?”

</p>
<p>Harry shrugged again and looked down. He wasn’t drunk at all, really; the contents of his cup were warm, since he’d been nursing them over an hour. He loved seeing all his friends’ excitement, and he was beyond grateful to never have to file into a high school classroom again. He’d never learned to do more than tolerate school and wouldn’t miss it. The idea of going into college courses, which would be harder and would lack the benefit of being with his friends, sounded like torture.</p><p>“Yeah, for now,” Harry said.</p><p>“It’s very…” began Hermione.</p><p>“Responsible, yeah, they get it,” Ron whisper-shouted at Hermione.</p><p>If Harry wasn’t particularly drunk, Ron was making up for his shortcomings. He slung an arm around Harry and Harry swiftly caught the half-empty bottle dangling from his hand and sloshing dangerously.</p><p>“Harry coulda gone to one of those baseball schools,” Ron shouted, apparently intent on reminding everyone in a three-block radius that Harry had been scouted for college programs.</p><p>Harry shot a quick, embarrassed glance at Dean, who had been hopeful but <em>hadn’t </em>gotten any offers, but Dean seemed amused rather than offended. In the end, he was probably glad he could just focus on Trigonometry or Calculus or whatever advanced math classes people who were into that kind of thing went for.</p><p>Harry managed to escape to the outdoors, where Seamus waved at him, a cigarette between two fingers. Harry smiled and leaned against the wall, carefully upwind. </p><p>“You’ll stay at Frank’s, right?”

</p>
<p>Harry nodded. Seamus didn’t seem surprised. He was usually laid back, but right now he could see Seamus was on edge. Particularly when he tossed his spent cigarette to the concrete patio and ground it out with a toe, then immediately lit another.

</p>
<p>“Dean says you might look for a job in Overbrook, so you’ll be close to his school,” Harry mentioned conversationally, but he knew he’d said the wrong thing when Seamus laughed bitterly, then took a long pull of his cigarette before answering.</p><p>“He’ll stop saying that tomorrow when we break up,” he said, shrugging and looking out over the shadowed, extensively landscaped backyard. </p><p>“What?” Harry couldn’t hide his shock. The effortlessly cool Seamus had been shadowed by a lovesick Dean for as long as anyone had been interested in that kind of thing. Since middle school. “Why would you break up?”
</p><p>“It’s only a matter of time, Harry. You think he’ll go off to school and stay with some townie like me?”</p><p>“You’re not a townie,” Harry scoffed.

</p>
<p>“Nah, not today. That starts tomorrow, when I’m all graduated and still hanging around.”

</p>
<p>“But you could go to Overbrook—”

</p>
<p>“I’m not doing that. I’m not going to wait around to get my heart broken.”

</p>
<p>Harry’s brow furrowed. “Oh.”

</p>
<p>They stood in silence while Seamus finished his cigarette. “I’ll see you around, then,” he said, almost lightly. “Since you’ll be at Frank’s. I’m starting full time at the store Monday, but it closes early. Maybe we can hang out.”

</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Harry said, thoughts still reeling. Seamus studied him a moment then smiled, just a quirk of his lips.</p><p>“You’ll be alright, Potter,” he said. “Your parents’ll send you along after a while whether you want them to or not.”</p><p>Harry wondered what that was supposed to mean, but didn’t ask. Just fixed Seamus’ shoulders with a blank stare while he went back in the house, leaving Harry alone with the lingering smell of smoke. He had always thought cigarettes were foul, so he grimaced and walked out into the grass where the air felt cleaner and easier to breathe.</p><p>He hadn’t intended to keep walking, but before he knew it he was all the way across the carefully mowed grass, stepping over a bed of mulched hostas and striding down the dark sidewalk.</p><p>Harry knew sometimes people broke up when they went away, or grew apart. That could happen whether or not they all followed a similar course. Hermione’s college was all the way in California, half a continent away, and though Ron’s was only two hours’ drive, they’d all be doing their own things, meeting their own group of peers, handling their own concerns, in a way that would be unlike their school years together. All their worlds were getting a little bigger, and that meant they’d all be less of a part of each other’s.</p><p>He <em>knew</em> that, but there was something about the look on Seamus’ face, and his resignation to he and Dean being over, that gave all the things Harry had already known new, painful resonance.</p><p>He was six blocks from Dean’s when he heard a motorcycle engine, noisy, though still far off, and the slightest bit choked. Then it sputtered and cut. Curious, Harry kept walking, and after a few blocks he could hear a lowered voice say, “Fuck,” just as he saw a man standing alongside a gleaming black motorcycle supported by its kickstand. Harry couldn’t make out a lot in the darkness; at this point between the street lights it was hard to see much more than shapes. But the man was tall and his silhouette was attractive in close-fitting black jeans, a leather jacket and hair tied up in a messy half-bun.</p><p>“Having trouble?” Harry called.</p><p>The guy stiffened as he turned, his hand straying toward his hip. Harry had never seen anyone reach for a gun except in movies, but some instinct had him pausing, holding his hands slightly out to his sides. Then his breath caught at the sight of the man’s face. He <em>looked</em> like someone out of a movie, too. Even in the darkness, his features were clearly drawn in a fair-skinned face, his eyes some sort of dark blue on the edge of grey, narrowed in a dangerous way that made Harry’s pulse leap.</p><p>Then he seemed to take Harry in and relaxed, the crease between his eyebrows disappearing, his hand drifting away from whatever he had in his waistband.</p><p>“I didn’t mean to bother you, but I think I heard your engine die,” Harry said apologetically, taking a half-step backward. But where there had been menace a moment before, there was now only curious openness on the stranger’s face.</p><p>“Just a good Samaritan, huh?” he flashed a smile, his teeth even and white, a dimple appearing briefly in the stubble of his left cheek. Harry’s face was hot, but he was sure it was too dark for to tell.</p><p>“Yeah,” Harry said, trying to match his tone, but just sounding breathy. He cleared his throat. “I work in a garage, actually. And I thought it sounded like…” he took in the motorcycle and blinked. “Fuck, is that a Black Shadow?”

</p>
<p>The guy looked surprised, then smug. He stroked the black leather seat. “Yeah. Good eye, kid. Your place work on a lot of bikes?”

</p>
<p>“No,” Harry said, staring at the sleek lines, the telltale black finish on the engine. “I never thought I’d see one of these in person.”</p><p>“Well, check it out,” the guy said with a laugh, stepping back and folding his arms. Harry shot him a quick look of disbelief, but came forward before he could change his mind, running his fingertips over the glossy front panel and peering at the headlight. 

</p>
<p>“Lots of original parts on it, too,” he said admiringly.</p><p>“Too many, I guess. It needs a reno. Keeps overheating. Thought I could get away with a short, slow ride tonight, but I guess not.”

</p>
<p>Harry had the sense of being studied, and glanced up at the man, but they’d traded places and now the faint light from up the street was behind the stranger, and it was Harry who was in its weak spotlight. Whatever he noticed about Harry had him going suddenly, completely still.</p><p>Harry hastily looked away. Maybe he’d seemed older in the darkness. Harry got that sometimes; Ron told him he had a “mature vibe and a baby face,” often while pinching his cheeks.</p><p>“Well, I can see why you’d rather keep it intact,” Harry said lamely, and moved away. “How long does it need to cool down?”

</p>
<p>“Probably good to go by now. I just came off the highway and it’s all easy driving from here.” The tension Harry thought he had observed a moment ago must have been his imagination. The guy’s voice was as deep and even as it had been before.

</p>
<p>Harry nodded. “Cool. Well, see ya.” He started to turn toward the sidewalk.</p><p>“Since you’re such an enthusiast,” said the stranger, his voice an octave lower, “maybe you ought to come along with me. Have a ride.”</p><p>Harry tried not to gape. “What?”

</p>
<p>“You heard me.” He slid a leg over the seat and then scooted forward an inch, tilting his head to indicate Harry should climb on behind. When Harry still hesitated, he said soberly, “If you’re not sure about getting on a motorcycle with a guy whose name you don’t know, it’s Sirius, by the way.”

</p>
<p>Harry laughed and rubbed the back of his neck. “I’m Harry.” He was already drifting closer, which made the stranger—Sirius—smile before ducking his head so a loose bit of wind-tangled hair brushed his cheek. </p><p>“Up to you,” he said, and leaned over to kick down on the start. Harry sucked in a deep breath as the engine roared, dangerously loud at close range, and his mind was made up. He might have dragged his feet, mortified and fascinated by the thought of fitting himself behind Sirius’ leather-clad back and putting his arms around his waist. But a door opened and someone shouted about the noise of the engine on the otherwise quiet street, and Harry found himself practically running the two steps, sliding into place just as Sirius hit the gas. Inertia threw them snugly together and he didn’t have a chance to feel awkward.</p><p>The seat vibrated with the force of the engine, the tires jerked. It was just as terrifying as his mother had given him cause to believe it would be, and just as exhilarating as he’d assumed when he was ten.</p><p>The exhilaration factor had to have something to do with the fact he was behind the sexiest person he’d ever seen in real life, the scent of leather, aftershave and the night air in his nose, zigzagging amongst parked cars down the sleepy narrow streets like Sirius was <em>trying</em> to wake up anyone who had the gall to be in bed before eleven. Harry wore short-sleeves; it was early summer, after all. So he could feel the smooth warmth of the jacket all down his arms. </p><p>They went through all the streets that were familiar to Harry and breezed out onto roads he didn’t know, then a twisting blacktop road without pavement markings that Harry knew only by reputation, and then into a sparse gravel lot where they kicked up as much dirt as rock as Sirius angled into a spot alongside the exterior wall of a bar Harry knew his father would have forbidden him to enter. But when Sirius hopped off the bike and jerked his head again for Harry to follow, one brow arched, like a dare, Harry had to go in. And more than that, he <em>wanted</em> to.</p><p>In the bar, Harry was immediately hit with the smell of old cigarettes, spilled drinks and greasy food. Someone was eating bacon and eggs at the bar next to two women doing shots, and the air was thick with smoke, old and new. His eyes watered and he reached under his glasses to rub them.</p><p>“Okay, kid?” Sirius asked, touching Harry’s elbow. Somehow the soft, deliberate touch made Harry’s stomach flip like a first touch, even though he’d just spent the last ten minutes plastered against Sirius’ back.</p><p>“Yeah,” Harry said, pulling his hand away from his face and looking Sirius in the eye. The bar was dim but there was still more light here than there had been on the street or in the parking lot, and he could tell Sirius was a little older than he’d thought at first. There were a few fine lines at the corners of his eyes and on either side of his smile.

</p>
<p>Sirius said curled his fingers around Harry’s elbow to tow him gently along through the distracted crowd.</p><p>The wind had probably done something terrible to Harry’s hair, but Sirius’ only looked artfully tangled, falling just to his shoulders and with the slightest bit of curl.</p><p>“Sirius!” called someone from across the room, but Harry couldn’t see anything but Sirius’ shoulders and the heads of the people moving by them in either direction, not until they had made their way to a table where Sirius was greeted again by three men and a woman wearing leather jackets with the same coiled-snake symbol on their patches that Harry noticed on Sirius’.</p><p>“And he brought a guest,” noted one of the men, a lean, bearded one. The woman sat on his knee; her jacket was sleeveless and zipped tightly to her throat, but her legs, crossed at the thigh and slung over the man’s lap, were bare to mid-thigh and covered in tattoos in shades of violet.</p><p>The other two didn’t comment, but Harry felt them looking at him, unabashed. </p><p>“A special guest,” said the grey-haired one, and there was a hard look in his beady blue eyes that made Harry avert his eyes and wonder if he was going to regret coming in here.</p><p>“I’m not staying long,” Sirius said, reaching into his jacket and pulling out an envelope wrapped in plastic, which he dropped on the middle of the table. The third man, who hadn’t spoken yet and who had a sleek black ponytail, swore and snatched the parcel off the table almost as soon as it hit the surface.</p><p>“Fuck, man,” he said, shooting Sirius a look. Sirius looked back at him with an absent smile.</p><p>Then they all looked uncertainly at Harry, and Sirius tugged him closer. “Don’t worry about Harry, here. He’s a mechanic and he recognized my bike. No one with that kind of soul would go spreading rumors about a new friend.”</p><p>Harry let his spinning thoughts coalesce. All kinds of people rode motorcycles and wore leather. All kinds of people came to questionable bars for a laugh. All kinds of people carried guns. But these weren’t all kinds of people. Harry was glad he didn’t know what was in the envelope.</p><p>“Want a drink, Harry?” Sirius asked, turning toward him, leaning against the table in the process, so he had a backdrop of unsmiling faces that Harry couldn’t quite stop himself from seeing. He made himself look only at Sirius instead, which was kind of a dizzying experience, this close and with his face clear even in the smoky light. His eyes, bright and open, accentuated by the thick black eyebrows—the smallest silver scar passing through the one on the right—his sculpted cheeks and jaw, that half-smile and single dimple. With more light, Harry could see his lips were dark pink, the lower one surprisingly full.</p><p>“I’m not . . . ” Harry started to say, and then hastily adjusted his gaze, which had been resting on Sirius’ mouth, back to Sirius’ eyes. “I’m eighteen,” he said, a little defensively. </p><p>Sirius smiled again, reached out and bumped his knuckles softly against Harry’s cheek and laughed. “Legal for the important stuff then.” He winked when Harry’s jaw dropped, then took a cigarette out of his pocket and waved it back and forth. Harry closed his mouth.</p><p>“I don’t smoke.” Harry couldn’t keep the distaste from his voice. Sirius looked surprised for a moment, then let out a quick, surprisingly loud laugh. He put the cigarette back and then looked thoughtfully at the door.</p><p>“Should I take you back, then? I don’t want you to feel kidnapped.”</p><p>Harry shook his head mutely. Sirius squinted at him, which made a wrinkle appear in his nose. “One beer then? I’m the one who’s driving,” he said playfully. Harry nodded.</p><p>Sirius grinned and shoved him gently toward the bar. Harry smiled back nervously then led the way, conscious of Sirius behind him in a way that made his shoulders hunch til he felt Sirius’ knuckles against the small of his back, a light touch that felt twice as electric as the same guiding pressure on his elbow from before.</p><p>When they got to the bar, a few people had cleared out, so Harry could stand against it between two empty stools. Sirius leaned past him, pressing against his side. “Bailey, gimme a Bud Light,” Sirius called, then pulled away, turning so he could lean an elbow against the bar and face Harry. Harry glanced over at him and bit his lip.</p><p>Sirius was looking at Harry with a warmth Harry’d had enough hookups to recognize. His eyes skimmed over Harry too fast for Harry to follow, but he was definitely interested in what he saw. His gaze lingered a moment on the v-neck of Harry’s collar, the top of his head, his bare arm and where his hand rested on the bar.</p><p>Then a pint glass slid across the bar and hit Harry’s fingertips. They both looked away.</p><p>“Fuck, Bailey, do I even have to ask?” Sirius demanded, sounding like he was only half-joking. He reached past Harry again to slide the glass back a few inches toward the bartender. “A bottle. You think I trust your tap lines?”</p><p>Bailey made a rude gesture, but collected the glass and replaced it with a bottle, prying the top off first. </p><p>Harry’d never given serious thought to being with someone older, but that had definitely changed approximately three seconds after he heard Sirius say “fuck” out on Dean’s street. He couldn’t be quite <em>that</em> much older, anyway. </p><p>Harry cautiously sipped his beer, but it was quickly evident no one was going to side-eye someone a few years shy of twenty-one for drinking in this place. He turned to face Sirius, and noticed through his eyelashes that Sirius was watching him just as intently as before. Harry gathered his courage and looked back, setting aside the bottle.</p><p>“I like your tattoo,” he said, looking at the tail end of something dark orange and red, maybe flame, that snaked up Sirius’ neck an inch past the collar of his jacket.</p><p>“Which one?” Sirius asked with a smile, pushing back his left sleeve to show Harry a line of oblong circles, like links in a chain but in a series of warm colors, that advanced up his forearm.</p><p>“Both,” Harry said, helpless not to notice Sirius had long-fingered, elegant hands that would have looked more appropriate on a piano than the handlebars of his bike.</p><p>“Who said I only had two?” Sirius eased closer and stretched his leg out so that his calf was pressed against Harry’s. </p><p>Harry felt painfully alert, but also strangely at ease. He grinned back at Sirius and twisted the bottle back and forth on the bar, his hand wet from the condensation. He let his gaze stray now that it was obvious they were both flirting, and it wouldn’t necessarily be unwelcome. Sirius was almost skinny in the waist compared to the breadth of his shoulders, and his legs were long and lean, accentuated by black jeans that hugged his thighs, the cuffs pulled down tightly over the top of his well-worn black leather boots.</p><p>“I guess until I see the rest, I can’t say for sure,” Harry said. Sirius laughed, and it was just like the last one: a short burst of sound. Then he reached out and picked up Harry’s beer, took a long pull, and handed it back to him. Harry drank, too, imagining he could taste Sirius on the slightly-warmed rim. He thought Sirius had the same thought, based on how closely he watched Harry’s mouth.</p><p>“Wanna get out of here?” Sirius murmured. Harry nodded eagerly and set the bottle back down so fast he almost upset it, but Sirius reached out and covered Harry’s hand with his, chuckling, and kept it upright. Then he tangled their fingers together and led Harry back out the way they’d come.</p><p>“Do you need to pay?” Harry leaned toward him to ask when they were almost to the door.</p><p>Sirius gave him a funny little smile. “I’m not exactly a customer,” he murmured. Then he rubbed the middle of Harry’s palm with his thumb, and Harry’s throat got too tight for him to ask anything else.</p><p>They were barely out the door when Sirius stepped toward Harry, put his hands on Harry’s hips, and walked him backward til his back was pressed against the wall. Then he peered into Harry’s face, letting go of him with one hand so he could brush Harry’s hair from his face.</p><p>“This okay?”
</p><p>Harry, throat definitely not working now, could only nod, and reach out for whatever he could touch: a handful of Sirius’ shirt, bunched at his stomach, and his waist. His t-shirt was thin and the lining of his jacket was startlingly warm against the back of Harry’s hand.</p><p>Sirius stepped closer with a soft little growl, and at the same moment pulled their lower bodies together with the hand that still held Harry’s hip, firmly, hot as a brand. Harry was embarrassed at his automatic, needy whimper, and that he was hard and aching against Sirus’ thigh, but he couldn’t feel self-conscious because he felt Sirius’ cock, too, just as hard.</p><p>Then Sirius was kissing him, gently but insistently, his mouth briefly, then his neck, then his jaw, then his mouth again.</p><p>“You’re so...fuck. Such a surprise,” he said, and then kissed Harry again more deeply, his tongue drawing a warm path over Harry’s lower lip. Harry meant to kiss back, but mostly he just panted through his parted lips, and ground against Sirius’ leg, like the pathetic teenager he was. Nothing like this had ever happened to him. He’d fooled around, sure, but it had always been discussed in advance, with very little spontaneity, and it was full of awkwardness and fumbling. Now he felt like something had been ignited in him that pushed aside all conscious thought. Everything Sirius did felt amazing, and every response Harry gave felt right.</p><p>Sirius drew back and slid his hand down the front of Harry’s jeans, cupping him, and then tilted his head til they were looking one another straight in the eye again. Sirius had ridiculous eyelashes, and faint silver lines through his irises that explained why his blue eyes had looked grey off and on during the night, depending on the light.</p><p>“Still okay?” he asked shortly, and Harry thrust into his palm in answer. “Fuck,” Sirius breathed, and Harry thought he could see his pupils dilate just a bit. “You’re really hard, aren’t you, baby?”
</p><p>The door opened at that inopportune moment, and at least three people came through, talking amongst themselves. Instead of stopping, Sirius angled his body so they would only see Sirius’ back, and his sure touch between Harry’s legs didn’t let up. Somewhere between horrified and delighted, Harry groaned and pressed his face against Sirius’ chest and inhaled deeply. Sirius smelled like sweat, a spicy, faint aftershave or soap, cigarettes and wind.

</p>
<p>The people coming out pretended not to notice them; their conversation stopped abruptly and they hurried along. Sirius put his mouth next to Harry’s ear. “Could I make you come like this? Through your clothes?” He rubbed Harry’s shaft more firmly. “God, that would be so fucking hot.”

</p>
<p>Harry shivered and his cock jumped. He swore he felt the curve of Sirius’ smile, and definitely felt his warm breath when he chuckled again. “You like it when I talk to you?” </p><p>“Yeah,” Harry managed, his cheeks red, but his face was safely hidden still. Sirius’ other hand roamed up his back and threaded through his hair, cradling his head against Sirius’ chest, while the other kept moving between them, maddeningly slow. Any more friction would have been painful; Sirius gave him just enough, and mostly just pressure, kneading him.</p><p>“Almost isn’t fair,” he went on. “You feel so good. I bet you’ve got a really pretty cock, and I won’t even get to see it, let alone taste it.”</p><p>“Fuck,” Harry said, feeling increasingly desperate. He almost wanted to jerk his fly open and show Sirius, anything for more of this quiet praise, but they were three feet from the entrance to the bar, out in plain sight. If they hadn’t been… But as it was, he reached around Sirius’ back and grasped his ass. He had narrow hips but instead of flat, his buttocks were surprisingly round, and satisfyingly hard in Harry’s palms. Even more gratifying was the puff of involuntary breath Sirius let out, groaning at Harry’s touch.</p><p>He ground harder against Harry. He felt big, and had to be uncomfortably restricted by his jeans.</p><p>“Wanna see you too,” Harry admitted. “You...fuck, you feel…”</p><p>Sirius groaned, abruptly twisting out of Harry’s grasp. Harry, slack-jawed, blinked at him and slumped against the wall, but he only had moment to take in Sirius, breathing hard, wild-eyed, before he had seized Harry by the hips against and spun him around. Harry’s hands hit the wall, and Sirius pressed himself snug up against Harry’s ass, then put his hand right back where it had been before. The tip of Harry’s cock was practically past the waistband of his underwear, and there was a damp patch there. Sirius, feeling it, jerked his hips against Harry’s ass.</p><p>Sirius’ cock was a hard rod laid along Harry’s cleft. The startling pressure against his hole did wonders for Harry’s imagination, so that it only took two more firm thrusts from Sirius, and his thumb happening to make the barest contact with the tip of Harry’s cock, before Harry came, half in his pants and half on his stomach. Sirius ground them together one last time, almost cruelly, and slipped two of those long, elegant fingers in Harry’s mouth. When Harry sucked, hard and eagerly, he felt Sirius’ cock throb, and Sirius nipped his neck then mouthed the spot, shuddering behind him.</p><p>The door opened again, and Harry hastily straightened up from the wall, only to stagger back against Sirius. Sirius caught him and held him tightly, his arms locked around Harry’s chest, kissing him again. His temple, his shoulder.</p><p>“Fuck, kid.” He slowly let Harry go when he felt that Harry was steady on his feet. Harry turned hesitantly, sticky and uncomfortable and, in the wake of the lust-driven rush, marveling at what they’d just done. Sirius watched him quietly, then reached behind him to put his hand on the small of Harry’s back. “Come on. I’ll take you home.”
</p><p>They walked slowly toward the bike, and then Sirius paused and rummaged in the side compartment before getting on. He pulled out a simple black helmet, dusted out the inside and set it on Harry’s head.</p><p>Harry looked at him curiously while Sirius’ nimble fingers buckled the strap under his chin. “You didn’t make me wear this before.”</p><p>Sirius glanced at Harry’s eyes, then quickly back down, expression inscrutable. “Forgot,” he said absently, which was clearly bullshit. Harry didn’t press.</p><p>
Harry wasn’t sure what he’d expected to happen, but somehow this wasn’t it, getting back on the bike behind Sirius and calling directions into Sirius’ ear whenever Sirius tilted his head. Sirius slowed down a few blocks away from Harry’s house, though, almost coasting along the dark street. Then he shut off the engine and they both sat unmoving for a moment, Harry’s hands lingering on Sirius’ waist.</p><p>Sirius was staring, as though mesmerized, at something on the street. Looking, Harry stiffened when he realized that his dad’s patrol car was parked on the curb outside their dark house.</p><p>“My dad’s a cop,” he said, and then felt the need to add some kind of qualifier, but couldn’t think of anything. Sirius stroked his arm, seeming unbothered, to Harry’s relief. When another moment of silence passed, Harry realized this was it. He was going to get off the bike, go inside and probably never see Sirius again. He wondered if he’d ever have another experience like this, but grimly thought he wasn’t likely to.</p><p>He slid off, took off the helmet, and rubbed the back of his neck. Sirius looked over at him, a considering look on his shadowed face, but didn’t say anything. Harry sighed internally, managed a smile, and handed over the helmet.</p><p>“Bye, then,” he said. “It was…” he bit his lip and then smiled up at Sirius, flushed. “It was great,” he admitted quietly, then turned his reddened face away and started toward the house.</p><p>“Hey, Harry,” Sirius called just as he stepped onto the sidewalk. Harry turned so fast he was half-surprised he didn’t stumble. Sirius still sat unmoving, unutterably sexy with his arms folded, the bike leaning toward the left where he was supporting it with one bent leg. “Which garage is it, that you work at?”</p><p>Harry smiled, his heart kicking hard against his ribs. “Frank Long’s,” he said, hoping he didn’t sound too eager.</p><p>Sirius gave him that half-smile, flashing the left dimple, and nodded. “See you around, then.” He winked and started the engine, then shot off down the street faster than he’d gone the entire time Harry had been on the bike with him. Harry’s neighbors’ dogs went into a barking frenzy from the house next door, and two doors down an upstairs light went on.</p><p>Harry walked the block and a half slowly, trotted down the stairs to the basement entrance, and flopped down on the bed in the guest room. It was weird, being down here in this half-empty room, but it might have been more odd to be in his own room, which was already half-packed. He moved out in the morning; his parents’ request, if he wasn’t going to go to school.</p><p>When he’d left earlier that night he’d felt like he was drifting, anchorless. Now he couldn’t wait to go to work on Monday. Now, when he closed his eyes, he saw grey eyes, heard a rough voice in his ear, and couldn’t stop smiling.</p>
