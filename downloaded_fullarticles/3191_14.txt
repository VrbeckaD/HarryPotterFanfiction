          <div class="userstuff"><p>Remus quietly shut the door behind him. He was careful to not make a sound. Harry had been having difficulties sleeping ever since he started living with the Lupin-Snapes. Most nights were filled with terrors and tears. Harry was afraid of closing his eyes. He was constantly haunted by flashes of green light and high-pitched wails that emanated from a young female. He begged Severus and Remus to stay up late, requesting story after story in hopes of avoiding sleep.</p><p>Tonight, the wizards were able to get Harry ready for bed without too much resistance. He asked for two bedtime stories and promptly fell asleep before the last words were uttered. </p><p>Severus and Remus now sat in their living room. Their bodies were pressed closely together, soaking up the warmth of one another. The fire burned quietly in the background, crackling and popping. Each man had a cup of tea and a novel in front of them. Prior to Harry’s arrival, they used to drink Odgen’s Firewhiskey at night but that practice quickly stopped when they realized Harry’s negative reaction to the smell of alcohol. </p><p>Remus laid his head on Severus’ shoulder and sighed deeply. Severus’ hair tickled his nose while a subtle smell of smoke permeated the air. </p><p>“Sev?” Remus whispered, gazing up at his partner.</p><p>“Yes, love?” </p><p>“You’re my best friend… you know that right?” </p><p>“Yes, dear.”</p><p>“And I love you.” </p><p>“I am aware.” </p><p>“Alright, just so we’re clear.” </p><p>Remus closed his eyes and sighed again. A small smile appeared on his face. The wizard was so thankful for the life he had. He wanted for nothing.</p></div>
