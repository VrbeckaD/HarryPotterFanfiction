</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hermione made her way down the main road of the village quickly, accompanied by her parents. It was a fine spring day, and she wrinkled her nose at the thought of being forced to spend most of the morning in church when she could be doing better things, like exploring the countryside and collecting specimens.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Since she had been a small girl, Hermione held a curiosity about the world around her. Being of logical, analytical mind, she had often asked </span>
  <em>
    <span>why</span>
  </em>
  <span> things were a certain way and how things worked, exasperating her parents to no end. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her questioning nature also occasionally landed her in trouble. She had been eight when she interrupted the minister at his sermon.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He was telling the story of how Jesus had performed the miracle of turning a few loaves of bread and small fish into enough food to feed several thousand people.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“But how can food be multiplied this way?” she asked. “If I have two apples and wish for a bushel, will I receive one because I have given thanks?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The already silent church had, if it were possible, become even more quiet and all the parishioners turned to stare at her while her parents looked at their feet in embarrassment.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The minister cleared his throat awkwardly and frowned. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well, </span>
  <em>
    <span>no</span>
  </em>
  <span>, young Miss Granger. The miracle occurred because it was Jesus who performed it, and he was the son of God.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“But </span>
  <em>
    <span>why</span>
  </em>
  <span> would God only grant the miracle to his son?” she persisted. “Surely if it is so important to feed many, God would grant this miracle to all who needed it, instead of just one man.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“God only allows those who are worthy to perform miracles,” the minister sighed, visibly annoyed at having his sermon questioned.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Are not all people worthy?” Hermione challenged. “If only certain people are worthy to perform miracles that may benefit many, it disadvantages those most in need. Does not God love all his people equally?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Do not question the word of God!” The minister had thundered, losing his temper. “His work and His will is absolute! We may not always understand His will, but we must not question it if we wish to Him to reach out His loving hand to us!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hermione had cringed under his rage, and her parents shushed her. After the sermon concluded, her parents insisted she apologise to the minister and promise not to question him in such a manner again.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>At home, she had struggled to make sense of the incident. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“But mother, you have always told me that if I don’t know the answer to something, I should ask questions until I understand!” she cried.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jane Granger looked at her husband and sighed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I have, darling. But there are some questions that are better left unasked - or, at the very least, asked with discretion and in private.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That doesn’t make any sense!” Hermione exclaimed, weeping with frustration.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hermione, religion is... Well—” her father, Richard, had paused, trying to think of a way to explain. “—It’s something that people are very protective of. It’s true that most of the things discussed in the bible and in religion can’t be adequately explained and there is no reason or logic to them. But people don’t question them, because they have faith. They don’t need an explanation, because they choose to believe.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well, faith is stupid!” she snorted, wiping her eyes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’re entitled to your beliefs,” Jean replied. “But Hermione—” she lifted her daughter’s chin and looked into her eyes. “The people in this village are entitled to theirs. Although you may not agree, you must try not to argue with them about it. People can be ugly when subjects such as religion are challenged, and you will only open yourself up to grief if you do.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes, Mother. I understand.” Hermione sighed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>That had been the end of the matter, and she had never spoken in church again.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Now, just before her seventeenth birthday, Hermione had long come to the conclusion that the Christian religion was a load of rubbish. Ever since she discovered, at the age of eleven, that she was a witch, her whole world changed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her family lived on a small farm on the outskirts of the village, about twenty minutes by cart from the main square. Hermione had never before questioned why they lived further away than most of the other residents, and only found out the real reason when she woke on the morning of her birthday to find a small stick by her bedside.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Curious, she picked it up and felt the most amazing surge pass through her body. Her shock had been so great that she had dropped the stick and scooted back on her bed until she hit the headboard. Moments later her parents came rushing in to wish her a happy birthday.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What just happened?” she gasped, trembling.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“The wand has chosen you,” her mother smiled. “We knew it would. It was your grandmother’s, and you are so like her.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...wand…?” Hermione stuttered. “Are you making fun?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her father sat on the edge of her bed, regarding her seriously. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hermione, you are a witch. Your mother is a witch. I am a wizard. We come from a long line of magical folk.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hermione laughed. “Now I </span>
  <em>
    <span>know</span>
  </em>
  <span> you’re fooling. Magic isn’t real.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Isn’t it? How do you explain the funny things that would happen around you sometimes when you had a particularly strong emotion or wish?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hermione frowned and thought back to the incidents she remembered, such as a bowl flying across the room when she didn’t want to eat her beans, or a jar of sweet shortbread she couldn’t quite reach suddenly toppling off the shelf.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Magic </span>
  <em>
    <span>is</span>
  </em>
  <span> real, and you can perform it. It’s the real reason we live on the outskirts of the village,” her father explained. “muggles - non-magical folk - fear and distrust magic, and it is dangerous for people like us to be outed as being able to perform it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hermione nodded. “So — you mean, all those stories about people being tried and executed as witches and about being tied to the devil are true? They were really witches?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Some of them,” her mother sighed. “But most were Muggles and falsely accused. I can assure you, however, we are not tied to the devil. He is no more real than the God Muggles believe in.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Over the following weeks and months, Hermione’s parents taught her how to control and funnel her magic through her wand, as well as basic spells and potion making. Now,  she was a skilled and powerful witch, and her parents could not have been prouder.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Good morning, Hermione.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She was pulled from her reverie by a voice beside her. They had arrived at the doors of the church, where the other villagers were milling about and greeting one another before filing inside. Turning, she suppressed a shudder and smiled politely at the speaker.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Good morning, Ronald. I trust you are well?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ronald Weasley was the second youngest child of a large family. He lived with his parents and siblings in a ramshackle house on the opposite side of the village. Ron had harboured an interest in Hermione — which she did not reciprocate in the least — for quite some time. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>While he was not unattractive despite his shock of red hair —  a trait his whole family shared — he was quick to anger and had a sharp-tongued, sometimes cruel nature. He had a tendency to hold grudges against those who he felt had slighted him or his family in some way. In addition, he was not very clever. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>All in all, Hermione found him quite off-putting and tried to avoid him as much as possible without seeming impolite.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What are your plans for the rest of the afternoon?” Ron asked, moving closer to her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hermione fought the urge to step backwards. “Um… we have some chores to complete at home,” she fumbled.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“On the sabbath? Surely no chores are </span>
  <em>
    <span>that</span>
  </em>
  <span> urgent,” Ron smiled indulgently at her. “I thought perhaps you and I could take a stroll through the village.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Regretfully, the chores are rather urgent,” Hermione’s father interrupted, resignedly. “We need to check the roof and windows for weak spots before the rains come.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh. That </span>
  <em>
    <span>does</span>
  </em>
  <span> sound rather urgent.” Ron looked crestfallen for a moment, before brightening again. “Let me come by and help you, save the ladies having to put themselves at risk of harm. Us lads can do the dirty work. Perhaps they can catch up on some baking instead?” He smiled disarmingly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hermione bristled at Ron’s comment. How dare he! Women were more than capable of carrying out manual labour and were no more at risk than men, and she resented the implication that she and her mother would be happier in the kitchen.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Thank you, Ronald, that’s very kind. But I wouldn’t dream of imposing on you in such a way, especially not on the sabbath. We’ll manage just fine.” Richard answered.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“If you’re sure…” Ron answered doubtfully.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We’ll be sure to keep you in mind if we could use a pair of hands in the future,” Jean smiled. “Now, if you’ll please excuse us, I think it’s time we found our seats. The minister is beckoning us in.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hermione and her parents joined the throng of worshipers as they filed into the church. Joining another family in a pew, Hermione sat down with a small sigh, already counting down the minutes until she could escape the monotonous droning of the minister’s Sunday sermon.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Later, as they were travelling home in the cart with Richard at the reins of their work horse, Mordred, Hermione was finally able to vent about Ron. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ugh. He’s so… traditional!” she exclaimed in disgust. “He’s the type of man who thinks women’s only jobs are to cook, clean and breed! I do </span>
  <em>
    <span>not</span>
  </em>
  <span> want any man like him for a husband! I’m more than capable of turning my hand to any task, even if I have to do it the Muggle way!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I know, darling,” Jean soothed. “We would never make you wed a man you didn’t like, you know that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I do know, and I thank you both,” Hermione sighed. “I would rather remain a spinster than marry someone like Ronald Weasley.” She curled her lip in disdain.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“”Besides,” chuckled Richard from the driver’s seat, “if your mother and I did not seek your agreement before negotiating with potential suitors, I imagine you would hex us both.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Too right I would!” Hermione agreed with a giggle.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They were just arriving at their yard when they spotted a figure approaching from a distance.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Who is that?” asked Richard.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m not sure, but judging from their clothing, they’re wealthy,” observed Jean. “Although I wonder why they’re on foot. There isn’t anybody else in that direction for miles.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We’d best wait and see,” Richard decided. “But be careful. We can’t be sure they don’t mean us harm.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’re far too suspicious, Richard,” Jean clucked. “Always so wary of strangers.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Better the devil you know than the devil you don’t.” quipped Richard with a self-depreciating grin, as they climbed down from the cart.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>While they were talking, the figure had drawn close enough for the Grangers to finally identify him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It looks like the lad from the family who lives beyond the tree plantation. The ones living in the large manor,” Richard observed. “What was their name again?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Malfoy,” Hermione remembered. She had seen the family only a handful of times. They rarely ventured into the village themselves,  sending servants to do their shopping and handle most of their affairs. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They did not as a rule attend church services but, to keep the minister happy, they sent regular generous donations </span>
  <em>
    <span>in absentia</span>
  </em>
  <span>. It was rumoured he lived a very comfortable life thanks to the Malfoy family’s contributions, though the village poor didn’t seem to benefit much from the additional funds.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hermione recalled that on the few occasions she had seen them, they had displayed an aloof and imposing presence. The patriarch, Lucius, was coldly handsome and never seemed to be without his cane, which featured a serpent’s head as its grip. His wife, Narcissa, was beautiful but serious, and she seemed to wear a slightly haughty expression. Their son, Draco, appeared snobby and spoiled, often looking around with his pointy face slightly pinched, as if an offensive odour lingered just under his nose and he could not escape it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As the figure grew closer still, Hermione could see it was indeed Draco Malfoy who approached them. He was near enough now that she noticed he was red in the face and his normally impeccably styled blond hair was in disarray, as if he had been walking at a brisk pace for quite some time and was fatigued.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hello there, lad. What brings you out so far on foot?” Richard called jovially. The family stood in a small huddle, watching Draco’s approach.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Good afternoon, sir.” Draco stopped just beyond the yard entrance. “I’m afraid our coach has snapped an axle, out to the west of the plantation. My driver fell from the high seat when it snapped and appears to have broken his arm. I was very much hoping you would be able to assist us to repair the axle and splint the driver’s arm, but—” he glanced over at Hermione and Jean and frowned. “It seems you are alone out here.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well, I’m sure between the two of us, we can manage it, depending on how serious the axle break is.” Richard nodded. “I have plenty of tools and our pony is very strong.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hermione watched in interest as Draco’s already red face darkened in hue, embarrassed. “Well, the thing is, sir… I actually don’t know how to repair an axle, or any part of a coach. We have servants who do those sorts of things.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She couldn’t help but snort in amusement. Of course the upper classes wouldn’t know what a day of hard work looked like or  how to do anything useful.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hermione! Hush!” Her mother admonished quietly, though she had to turn away from the men to hide the twitch of her own lips. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well, I can assess it if you like, and we can always give you a ride home in our cart,” Richard suggested, indicating their transport. “I know it’s not much, but it’s sturdy and comfortable enough; I’m sure it would be preferable to walking all the way home.” He paused, considering. “Are your parents with you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, they are at the manor,” Draco replied. “They wished to sit in the rose garden and watch the butterflies.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“A rose garden?” echoed Jean. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>At the same time Hermione blurted, “You have butterflies?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Draco looked over at the women, amused. “Yes, and yes. My mother is a keen gardener and her roses are her pride and joy. At this time of year, all the buds are opening, and a number of different butterflies converge.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“How many breeds of butterflies frequent your mother’s garden?” Hermione asked with interest.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know,” Draco replied vaguely, shrugging. “Aren’t they all more or less the same?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“They most certainly are </span>
  <em>
    <span>not</span>
  </em>
  <span>!” Hermione replied indignantly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Master Malfoy, you look utterly parched,” Jean interrupted. “Won’t you come inside to catch your breath and have some water?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That would be wonderful, thank you,” Draco agreed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hermione.” Jean turned to her daughter with a pointed expression. “Won’t you take Mr Malfoy inside and fetch him a drink?”</span>
</p><p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, Mother,” Hermione sighed. Turning to Draco, she gestured toward the house. “Come on in.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Opening the front door, she stepped across the threshold with Draco close behind. Indicating the small scrubbed table in the middle of the main room, she said, “Take a seat.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She watched Draco’s careful, neutral expression as he appraised the small space and the worn wooden benches that served as table seating.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s not fancy or large, but it’s home,” Hermione added, a touch defensively. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Your home is… lovely,” Draco managed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hermione narrowed her eyes. She suspected he was being insincere, but he </span>
  <em>
    <span>was </span>
  </em>
  <span>a guest, so she had to mind her manners.Turning to the kitchen area, she opened the small door to reveal the cooler box attached to the outside of the house which held water, milk and butter. Retrieving the pitcher, she fetched a glass from the cupboard, filled it, and placed it before Draco.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Thank you,” he sighed gratefully, drinking deeply. Placing the empty glass down on the table, he said, “Your mother seemed quite interested in my mother’s roses. Is she a gardener also?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Mother adores roses.” Hermione nodded. “But she’s never had much luck growing them here. For some reason, they just don’t seem to thrive, no matter what she does.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That’s unfortunate.” This time, Draco actually seemed to be regretful.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Master Malfoy!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The two looked up as Richard poked his head around the door. “I’ve got my tools loaded in the cart, and your driver will want that arm seen to. We’d best get going or we’ll lose daylight.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Draco nodded and rose to his feet. “Thank you, Mr—?” pausing, he added, “I apologise. I don’t believe I know your name.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Granger. Richard Granger. And this lovely young lady—” he indicated his daughter, who blushed. “—is my daughter, Hermione.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hermione.” Draco repeated her name, looking at her intently. “Well, thank you for the water, Hermione. Perhaps we’ll meet again.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Perhaps,” she murmured. “Goodbye.” She wasn’t sure she liked him much. After all, he seemed like just another upper class snob. More money than sense and no idea of what life was really like outside of his comfortable, padded bubble. She watched him leave and wondered why she felt a sudden pang.</span>
</p><p>     </p><hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Richard Granger returned at dusk as Jean and Hermione were preparing the evening meal. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“How did it go, dear?” Jean asked her husband.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well, that axle’s well and truly broken,” Richard replied, moving over to the corner to wash up. Pouring water from the jug into a bowl, he splashed his face and scrubbed his hands before drying off with a small towel. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It snapped clean in half. When I questioned the driver, he said they had been going at quite a speed. ‘Testing the horses’, he called it.” Richard snorted and added, “The driver is lucky he got away with just a broken arm. It could have been a broken neck.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“But why were they going so fast in that area?” Jean frowned. “The roads around the plantation are rutted and curved. It would be a terrible place to be running the animals.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“The driver wouldn’t say. I suspect the Malfoy boy ordered him to do it.” Richard looked annoyed. “Not only did he play with the lives of himself and the driver, but he could have injured the horses.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What do you expect, Father? People like him rarely have any idea about how to go about things properly,” Hermione sniped as she set the table.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That may be true, Hermione, but it’s not polite to say so,” Richard chided gently with a smile. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So did you take the boy home? How is the driver faring?” Jean questioned. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes, I took him and the driver back to the manor,” Richard answered. “The driver’s arm broke cleanly. He’s in pain, of course, but as long as it is set properly, I think it will heal just fine.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well, </span>
  <em>
    <span>that’s</span>
  </em>
  <span> good news, at least,” Jean said, placing the serving dishes in the middle of the table. “Now, let’s sit down and eat.”</span>
