    <p>Scabior groaned, tiredly sitting down on the edge of his bed. Dawn streamed through his window, the sun warming his room deceptively, and he closed his eyes against it, falling back on his comforter. Failure weighed heavily on his chest, exhausting his body, but he had no real-time to catch up on sleep. Or life. He could hardly even get a decent fuck in these days, the little cunt of a witch in his basement taking up too much of his time and mind.</p>
<p>He felt the tingle of an elf passing through his wards before a squeaky voice asked, "Master?"</p>
<p>"What?" He hissed, twisting his wand between his fingers.</p>
<p>"Dolohov's mission was a failure," Alley explained.</p>
<p>He was sure the little thing was wringing its hands and fought the urge to kick it out of anger and disgust. Instead, he asked, "And?"</p>
<p>"The Dark Lord requires your presence upon his return from the Ministry. You and...hers.</p>
<p>"While...while the Dark Lord's forces were occupied, Grindelwald raided two prisons. We no longer have the Weasley. Among others."</p>
<p>"Leave," he demanded, rubbing his eyes with the swells of his palms.</p>
<p>He knew the Dark Lord wouldn't return for a few hours at worst, but he was no closer to a lead on Dumbledore's secret army then he had been the day he'd captured her.</p>
<p>Sitting up, he pressed his wand to his head, half considering what it would be like if he ended his own life. It was increasingly worth less and less. At the last second, he tossed his wand next to him and stood up, pulling the pink scarf he'd stolen from his neck. The floral scent that had clung to it had long faded, smelling more like dirt, sweat, and blood than he cared to admit.</p>
<p>As he made his way to his bathroom, he tossed it into his hamper to be washed, his mind going back to the witch once he was finally under the showerhead.</p>
<p>Scabior had never wanted a prisoner. He was sure the Dark Lord had shoved the little swot off on him because he'd been looking for a reason to kill him, and they'd all been sure he'd fail, anyway. Still, it was hard to believe this was <em>it</em>. His last shower. His last morning. It was sick, really, that it was a filthy little mudblood who'd brought about his downfall. After he'd sold his damned soul to the cause.</p>
<p>It was then that he realized he had his cock in his hand, fist pumping methodically over his shaft.</p>
<p>"Fucking bitch," he murmured, remembering the dark grin she'd given him when they realized they were stuck together. He'd hardly been sure who she was until she opened her pouty little know-it-all mouth and he'd had literal war flashbacks to Draco-sodding-Malfoy panting over her.</p>
<p>He groaned, feeling himself twitch in his hold. He hated it, but as his balls tightened, all he could think about was the way her eyes shined with mirth every time she fed him a lie, her face bruised but nowhere near broken.</p>
<p>His hands ached to hurt her, to make her feel something for all the failure she'd caused him. For the <em>life </em>that she'd caused him. Briefly, he wondered if the Dark Lord would kill him first, allowing her to watch. It seemed like something the 'new' him would enjoy. Scabior's final shame.</p>
<p>His fist pumped harder, his free hand gripping his balls as he leaned against the wall of his shower. He heard her laugh in his head, echoing in the same way it did in his stone basement and hated himself when he felt himself cum because of it, the feeling simultaneously warming and numbing his body. His mind going blank with satisfaction.</p>
<p>"Fucking Hermione," he breathed, blinking blearily. He leaned toward the water, watching as the evidence of his arousal -of the first time he'd cum in too long- washed off of his hand and down the drain. "<em>Fuck."</em></p>
<p> </p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>"Out," Scabior demanded, opening the iron door of her prison.</p>
<p>The wolf-in-man's-body with her growled at the command, his eyes cutting in Scabior's direction for only a moment before looking back at Hermione. He had her pinned to her cot, forearm heavy against her throat.</p>
<p>"What did I tell you about this shit?" Scabior questioned boredly. He'd stopped anything sexual from happening, but that hadn't stopped them from beating or torturing the shit out of her. Nor had it stopped the younger werewolves from rutting against her like second and third-years.</p>
<p>"I don't know why you care."</p>
<p>If he were being honest with himself, Scabior was none too certain, either. It didn't matter, anyway. She was <em>his</em>.</p>
<p>"Out," he demanded again. "Now."</p>
<p>The sigh she gave when he lifted his arm vibrated through Scabior annoyingly. She sat up as the wolf left, swinging her legs over the side of her cot. He ignored the way she rubbed her throat; it and her body were covered in far more bruises than she'd had when he left a few days ago.</p>
<p><em>Good</em>, he thought. <em>Bitch</em>.</p>
<p>She gave a soft moan that caused both Scabior and the wolf to look at her. "I thought I wouldn't see you again, Scabior."</p>
<p>"Now," he repeated, magic sparking. The wolf scampered away, his own wand tight in his grip.</p>
<p>When they were alone, she offered him a grin, her bruised mouth tugging mischievously.</p>
<p>"You, too. Out."</p>
<p>Despite her appearance, she jumped up, hands at her sides as she approached the opening.</p>
<p>"Your friends have kept me great company, you know. You'll have to thank them for me. Perhaps a fruit cake is in order."</p>
<p>He half led her to a table on the other side of the room. They'd done it enough for her to know the procedure.</p>
<p>"I suppose they were hoping to tell me about my friends. When you found them." She held her arms out to be shackled to the table.</p>
<p>He ignored the grin in her voice. The warmth of her skin when his fingers brushed hers.</p>
<p>"We both know the missions were unsuccessful."</p>
<p>"That was a good one, wasn't it? I nearly believed myself." She sat down, crossing her knees as she sat back. She rubbed the skin of her wrists, pushing a layer of dirt around.</p>
<p>"You're filthy," he commented, tapping his wand against his thigh. After a moment, he casted a <em>scourgify</em>, smirking at the way she shivered at the feel of his magic.</p>
<p>"Thank you," she told him, her voice quiet. She was still rubbing at her skin as though there were still grime there. "They make me feel quite disgusting."</p>
<p>He blinked, surprised at the admission. Swallowing thickly, he remembered the way his body relaxed at the sound of her laugh. He rolled his shoulders at the thought.</p>
<p>"Happy Birthday, Scabior."</p>
<p>He scowled.</p>
<p>"Thirty missions- failed. Thirty years- gone. Are you proud?"</p>
<p>He tapped his wand against the tabletop. "You planned this?"</p>
<p>"No. It just worked out spectacularly."</p>
<p>He resisted cursing her by the skin of his teeth. "Granger."</p>
<p>"I expected to be dead by now, Scabior. There is no sense of urgency. I'm on borrowed time."</p>
<p>"How many more of these do you have?" He asked tiredly.</p>
<p>"Seven pretty good -two shitty ones. I'm quite keen on thirty-seven. I'd appreciate accompanying you on that one."</p>
<p>"Oh? Would you?"</p>
<p>She nodded enthusiastically.</p>
<p>He slammed his palm against the table, ignoring the slow smile that spread across her face. "You and I will be dead before the next sunrise.</p>
<p>"Your little stunt got 30 of our men killed. Grindelwald-"</p>
<p>"Grindelwald?" she questioned, curiosity peeking in her voice.</p>
<p>"Unbelievable." He got up, twirling his wand between his fingers. "We're going to <em>die</em>."</p>
<p>"Do you think that I 'enjoy' life here? I'd rather be dead than live another <em>second</em> here."</p>
<p>He stared out a small window. "This is not the worst place you could be."</p>
<p>"Where did he attack?" She questioned.</p>
<p>He looked over at her to see that she was staring at the table, hands flat. "Nearby town."</p>
<p>She bit her lip, brow furrowed. Scabior watched her expectantly, waiting for a sign of something more. Something that could save their lives.</p>
<p>After a moment, she said, "12 Grimmauld Place. Islington, London. Former safehouse."</p>
<p>"Granger-"</p>
<p>"Left to Harry after the death of his godfather. I cannot guarantee people will be there, but you will find...other things.</p>
<p>"I've given you no reason to trust me- but I've none to trust you, either. I'm giving you this...because death appears to frighten you. And it will buy you another day or two, at least.</p>
<p>"Though, if Grindelwald is near...Merlin help us."</p>
<p>"What do you know?"</p>
<p>She met his gaze. No smirk. No amusement. No taunt. Just her eyes on his. He noticed a vessel in hers had broken, the skin around it tinged yellow.</p>
<p>"More than you ever will."</p>
<p> </p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>12 Grimmauld Place. Ilsington, London. Left to Potter by Sirius Black. Former safehouse.</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>"Looks like we die another day."</p>
<p>Scabior stared at her, somewhere between disbelief and awe. Despite himself, he understood Draco's obsession with her. It sickened him.</p>
<p>"I received no beatings. No curses. No visits. From baby wolves." Her face ticked. "Did you enjoy yourself, too, Scabior? With some long-legged German witch?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Wizard?"</p>
<p>He summoned a chair and sat down. "My thoughts are focused, Granger."</p>
<p>"On me?" She grinned, half laughing. "I'm flattered, of course. Is Scabior your first or last name?" Her voice was a taunt.</p>
<p>He shifted, but said nothing, opting to stare at her instead.</p>
<p>"Hermione Scabior." She frowned. "It's <em>alright</em>."</p>
<p>"Enough."</p>
<p>"I agree. It's ghastly."</p>
<p>He summoned a quill and parchment, conjuring a desk for her to write on. "If you want to live, you need to offer me more."</p>
<p>"You mean I haven't exhausted my usefulness, yet?" She inquired, putting quill to parchment. "Any news from either camp?"</p>
<p>"The DA is on the defensive. Numerang is quiet."</p>
<p>"Not for long," she told him softly. "Ask around."</p>
<p>He watched her in surprise, waiting for more. But, she said nothing more on the subject as she finished her false reports.</p>
<p>"I've put a star next to the one I'd like to join you on," she told him, sliding the list to him.</p>
<p>He barked out a laugh.</p>
<p>"Full moon is soon."</p>
<p>"Is it?" He questioned, reading it over. He glanced up at her as she shrugged.</p>
<p>"Should I expect those pups again?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>She rolled her tongue in her mouth. "Should I expect you?"</p>
<p>He tapped his wand on his thigh. "I'm not a wolf."</p>
<p>"Your mother was. And so was hers."</p>
<p>He folded the parchment and slipped it into the breast pocket of his robe as he stood up.</p>
<p>"That's why they stuck you with Greyback. They're waiting for a phenomenon."</p>
<p>He vanished the desk and chair as he left her cage.</p>
<p>"I know everything about you, Scabior."</p>
<p>"You don't know my name."</p>
<p>She ignored him. "Do you know about me, too?"</p>
