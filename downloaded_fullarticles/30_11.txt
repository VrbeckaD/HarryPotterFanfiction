    <p>Violet Clearwater was an ordinary girl, she could be weird some times but that was because no one understood her she was not a witch as she read on her favorite books, Harry Potter, or a fairy or nothing “cool” as she described it, she wish she was tho, but she wasn’t, she thought she wasn’t.<br/>When Violet turned 11 years old, a letter arrived to Cabildo 1795, Buenos Aires, Argentina. Her family was not used to receiving letters, so they were confused, why did this letter arrive at their door, who wrote letters these days? <br/>Violet’s mother saw that the letter was for Violet, so she gave it to her. Violet was surprised. She opened it and saw it was a letter from Hogwarts.<br/>- “Haha you are so funny mum” - said Violet.<br/>Her mother had no clue about what Violet was talking about, so she read the letter her daughter had in her hands.She didn’t understand what was happening either. <br/>Someone knocked the door on Violets house. When Violet opened the door, she almost fainted, right there in front of her was a big man. “A giant” thought Violet.<br/>- “Hello, I know you might be confused, but I came here to explain that letter to you, may I come in? My name is Hagrid by the way”- Said the giant.<br/>Violet understood everything. If this wasn’t a joke, she was actually a witch and that tall old man was Hagrid, the Gatekeeper of Hogwarts, who looked after Harry Potter.<br/>She let Hagrid in. Hagrid told her and her parents, and her little brother that she was a witch, who was accepted in Hogwarts. Everyone was shocked, but her brother spoke.<br/>-“How do we know that’s true?”- He asked.<br/>Hagrid made her brother, Fred fly. Everyone beloved him now.<br/>Hagrid said he would come back again to look for Violet, on August 31, to shop together all the things she needed for Hogwarts, classes started on September 1st. Violet was never so happy.</p>
