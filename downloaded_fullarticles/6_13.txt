    <p>Before James went to his detention, the other marauders had told him that they would be waiting in the Gryffindor common room, but it was 30 minutes after finishing the detention that James found himself down by the lake, where he spotted them laying on the grass in the warm evening sun. It was a fairly warm evening, and if James was forced to guess, he may have assumed that it was in the low 20s, and the sun shining in his eyes from where it hung low in the sky and reflected over the lake lit his face up as he approached. The clouds were plentiful above them, and James wondered if Lily was around, he knew she would enjoy laying on the grass and watching them move, trying to pick shapes out from the mismatched cloud layer, and basking in the last of the evening's warmth.</p><p>Lily. James had always had a soft spot for her, even if she had hated him for years. More recently she had warmed up to him, after he approached her for help with a situation only she, as far as he was aware, was accustomed to. To James, it was a moment in getting help, it was the sign of a new beginning, of the rest of his life, after everything. It was the start of a journey he wasn’t sure either of them was ready to make. </p><p>Unfortunately, James’ thoughts of Lily were interrupted from a particularly loud laugh from Sirius, who quickly stopped when he saw James’ shadow looming over him, and scrambled to sit up, now letting out a nervous laugh instead. James sat down to their right, refusing to speak or even look at them, letting his annoyance at the whole situation be known. </p><p>For the next few minutes they all sat there in silence, before the conversation between Remus, Sirius and Peter returned, and James sat alone to the side, a stick in hand, writing words on the ground or just dragging it around in circles. He was happy to continue doing this for hours, as it was easy to ignore Sirius calling his name, but this hope was quickly crushed by a projectile hitting him in the chest, which was less easy to ignore. He picked it up, rising with anger, and Sirius’ shoe armed in his hand to strike back at his attacker. James got a hit in on the shoulder and one on the head, before Peter pulled him off, trying to wrestle the shoe out of James’s grasp, whilst Remus helped Sirius up, who then had to lean on him for support. At this point, James was sick of his friends, and threw the shoe, but the opposite direction than Sirius would need it to go, and he stalked off. </p><p>Not 50 metres away, Lily sat with a group of her friends, and had watched the whole ordeal go down. When she spotted James walking away, she excused herself from her friends, saying she had to write an owl home, and rushed after him, staying her respectable distance away until they were out of sight, when she stopped him in his tracks.</p><p>“Are you okay?”</p><p>“I don’t want to go back to Gryffindor tower, come somewhere with me?”</p><p>Lily almost said no, but the look on James’ face made her change her mind, because it was a look she was all too familiar with. It was the look of a person who had endured too much already, of a person whose heart had been broken and could never be fixed, it was a look of pain, and longing. He wanted a safe place to be, and hell if Lily wasn’t gonna offer that.</p><p>And so she followed him, and Lily knew she would keep following him, anywhere he asked, anywhere they both needed to escape to. He had a strong front he put up to everyone, but Lily knew who he was, and how he felt. They trusted each other, and to Lily, that meant more than anyone would ever realise, especially in the coming months. Deep down, Lily was terrified, they were already taking each day as it came to them, solving whatever problems they needed to, and she knew they would make it the last week before term ended, but the summer was a hurdle she wasn’t sure they’d both be able to make it over. </p><p>If Lily had spoken her fears aloud, James would have wholeheartedly agreed with her, but instead the pair remained silent, hundreds of unspoken words floating between the two of them. They screamed out to Lily to be said, for him to hear them, for the growing tensions between the two to be finally resolved through something other than a fight, something that lasted. Lily felt as if a million eyes were watching the pair, and that they would be able to see all that wasn’t yet between them. But, when Lily looked around, the only person looking at her was James, and Lily decided that was a lot better. </p><p>It wasn’t until they reached the top of the astronomy tower that either one of them spoke, the understanding and support each gave the other was enough to keep them calm, even as James’ mind wandered to all the corners of the earth. Lily preferred it this way, as when James spoke, LIly felt as if she could hear his heart breaking with the weight of all it held, everything that he kept secret, that he felt he needed to hold alone. </p><p>“Thank you, for agreeing to come with me.”<br/>
The words cut through the warm summer evening, and Lily turned her head to gaze at James, who was still sat staring into the distance. He had taken his tie off, and unbuttoned the top three buttons on his shirt, and he looked more peaceful than he had in the last few weeks when Lily had seen him, as if nothing bad had ever happened. If Lily was a bitter person, she would be questioning why the worst things happen to the best people, but she had come to terms to the fact that bad things happened to everyone, and that sometimes people pulled the short straw, and there was nothing they could do about it. Life moved on and if they didn’t keep up Lily felt it might leave them behind, and that was what Lily now feared more. They were living in a new world, and times were changing for everyone. </p><p>“It’s okay, I know how hard it's been for you, and you know how hard it’s been for me.”</p><p>With her words, James turned his head to look back at Lily, and their eyes met, and the look of understanding between them was fully emphasised with each of Lily’s words. Afterwards, the two returned to silence, with the gentle whistling of the wind providing the background noise needed to keep the two calm. The sun was reaching its final low point far in the distance, and it gave way to a clear night full of stars, which Lily enjoyed despite the low mood of the two. They found solace and peace in each other’s company, and what they shared. It was a bond that may prove to be unbreakable, formed in each other’s darkest moments. </p><p>“You don’t have to do this if you don’t want to” Lily turned up look at James, shocked at the volume at which he had spoken, causing it to go right through her “it's completely up to you if we do this.”<br/>
“I’m not sure i want to do it, but that's the whole point, it's the unknown” Lily sighed before shifting to face him fully “everything in our live is so uncertain, we don’t know who we will still have each day to the next, but we have each other, and we have this summer, and if someone comes after us, let them, they might believe us dead.”<br/>
James was shocked at Lily’s final words, that she could be so nonchalant about that, and he took a few seconds to think before he could even respond.<br/>
“You don’t think it will get that far do you? It’s only supposed to be two months of freedom, of being more than who we are now.”<br/>
“When you’re us, it’s hard to escape it, and we’ve seen what’s out there, and what it can do to people.” Lily responded, moving closer to James. He looked at her for a long time, before he reached over and took her hand in his, and the two lapsed back into silence, spending the rest of the evening and all through the night at the top of the tower, thinking separately, but they weren’t alone.</p>
