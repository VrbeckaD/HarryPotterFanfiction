    <p>The Hogwarts Express whined as Hermione and her parents settled next to the train. She had tried to spend much more time with them, because she knew she wouldn't be able to if Voldemort was rising once again.</p><p>"Are you sure you'll be alright?" Mr Granger asked Hermione. She nodded.</p><p>"Of course, Dad, I'll be fine." Hermione responded.</p><p>"Make sure to send one of your owl friends to us when you get to Hogwarts, just to make sure we won't worry." Mrs Granger suggested.</p><p>"Oh, of course." A smile grew upon the young witches cheeks. Before Hermione departed to the train, she hugged both of them. They then said their goodbyes and Hermione got on the train.</p><p>She looked in every compartment trying to find Ron and Harry, before she stumbled upon them, eating some chocolate frogs and comparing their cards.</p><p>"Kingsley Shacklebolt.. I've got about four of these already." Ron frowned, looking to Harry.</p><p>"Ah.. I got Circe. Pretty sure I already have her, this may be my second one." Harry remarked, putting it in a pile next to him. Hermione shook her head before sitting next to the scarred wizard.</p><p>"Hey, Hermione... take one." Ron smiled, handing her a chocolate frog case.</p><p>"We have about... five more boxes of them" Harry said as he grabbed a box. Hermione opened her chocolate frog box, grabbing the frog before it jumped out of reach. She ate it first and then looked at the card. The current minister, <em>Kingsley Shacklebolt</em>.</p><p>She had knew him from the Order. Of course, there were rumors that he was going practically insane trying to figure out how to defeat Voldemort.</p><p>"<em>Shacklebolt.</em>" She responded, shifting the card. Ron and Harry scoffed.</p><p>"Another Shacklebolt card!" Ron cried as the train started. Harry laughed, showing his Queen Maeve card.</p><p>"So... Harry, have you had any issues with your scar?" Hermione asked. She knew she would have to break the ice at one point, because they were gonna start talking about Voldemort either way.</p><p>"Uh.. actually, I have. During the summer, I got this horrible migraine. It started at the scar." Harry responded, touching his head.</p><p>"You know, you should've told Dumbledore." Hermione exclaimed, her brows furrowing. </p><p>"Mione, you know, he was at my house. My parents are apart of the Order.. I thought you knew that." Ron said, leaning towards her.</p><p>The rest of the way to Hogwarts was filled with laughter, as Ron and Harry told Hermione of how Fred and George pranked Ginny at her birthday party. They had put some swelling serum in a cake the twins had "specially" formulated for her.</p><p>Ginny didn't seem too happy about it, once she took a bite out of the cake. Mrs. Weasley was on them for two months straight about the whole ordeal, and practically exterminated their whole operation.</p><p>Hermioneit's eyes followed the familiar hills go by. Soon enough, she was grabbing her luggage to depart to the thestral carriages. Harry and Ron were still going on about the chocolate frog cards, and how they kept getting Mopsus. By the time they got their robes on and got to the Great Hall, all three of them had gotten these strange letters folded in shiny paper.</p><p>A sigh escaped her mouth after she pulled out the folded parchment and scanned through the letter, reading the delicate calligraphy. It read...</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong><em>"Dear Miss Granger, </em> </strong>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong> <em>Congratulations on getting chosen to be in a Ministry of Magic experiment.</em> </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong> <em>You and five others will meet Professor Dumbledore after Sorting in his office.   </em> </strong>
</p><p>
  <em> <strong>I expect greatness out from all of you, especially you, Miss Granger. </strong> </em>
</p><p>
  <em> <strong>You are truly a force that can't be reckoned with.</strong> </em>
</p><p>
  <strong> <em>Thank you for reading this. The program will last for all of your sixth year.</em> </strong>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong> <em>The MINISTER OF MAGIC, </em> </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong> <em>Kingsley Shacklebolt."</em> </strong>
</p><p> </p><p>She read the letter almost five times before sighing and looking to Harry.</p><p>"All of our sixth year?! Are they crazy?! Kinglsey's first term as Minister and he's doing this!" Hermione groaned before sitting down in the Great Hall with Harry and Ron. Ron's eyebrows furrowed as Ginny grabbed the letter, reading it aloud.</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong><em>"Dear Mr. Weasley, </em> </strong>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong> <em>Congratulations on getting chosen to be in a Ministry of Magic experiment.</em> </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong> <em> You and five others will meet Professor Dumbledore after Sorting in his office.   </em> </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong> <em>I expect you and your partner to get along.</em> </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong> <em>Thank you for reading this. The program will last for all of your sixth year.</em> </strong>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong> <em>The MINISTER OF MAGIC, </em> </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong> <em>Kingsley Shacklebolt."</em> </strong>
</p><p> </p><p>Hermione scoffed. Harry shook his head, and Neville's eyebrow’s rose.</p><p>"An.. an experiment? What.. what, they can't do this!" Neville started to argue.</p><p>"I guess they can. Mum and Dad did say there was something wrong with Kingsley," Ginny frowned, leaning into the four, "They said they don't like him as Minister. They also said... he's not himself. He's become cruel."</p><p>                                                                                             </p><p>Hours later, it was time to meet Professor Dumbledore in his office. The trio walked to Dumbledore's office, not knowing that they would be the only ones there. Hermione was astonished by all of the books that Dumbledore had occupied, while Harry was playing with Fawkes. The three were too occupied to see who had opened the door.</p><p>”Oh, well look what we have here, ” Draco smirked, giving the trio an intense glare. ”King Weasley, Knight Potty, and the Gryffindor Princess.” Hermione stopped dead in her tracks. Malfoy was also in this experiment? </p><p>He would likely be the death of her. </p><p>”Oh, suck it Malfoy.” Hermione rolled her eyes, her grip on a book tightening. She looked over to Ron and Harry, who didn’t seem to care about the presence of Malfoy.</p><p>”You know, the only reason Shacklebolt has you here, Granger, is because you’re a wanna-be Pureblood. Might as well be a Squib, Mudblood.” Malfoy spat. He seemed to be proud of himself like he was living up to something. Ron looked over to Malfoy when he spoke the foul word. Hermione could just see the blood boiling inside of Ron. </p><p>”Malfoy, do you kiss your mother with that mouth?” Ron asked, a smirk starting to spread on his face. Hermione chuckled, and Harry seemed to cover his mouth to stop himself from laughing. </p><p>Draco’s face scrunched up and he seemed to frown. </p><p>Before anything else could happen, Dumbledore appeared behind Malfoy with Cho Chang and Lavender Brown. Harry, Ron and Hermione went silent and looked at each other, while Draco frowned while he was eating an apple, his focus on Dumbledore. Cho and Lavender sighed.</p><p>Dumbledore motioned for all of them to sit in six empty chairs near his desk, which all magically appeared.</p><p> "Good evening, students. It has came to my attention that the six of you were chosen for an experiment at Hogwarts. Now, while I don't condone these magical experiments done by the Ministry, I assume it is only for good reasons. Do any of you have any questions?" The bearded wizard looked around, alert for any curiosity. Hermione’s hand shot up.</p><p>"Yes, Miss. Granger?"</p><p>"Sir, will this really be taking up our school year?" She spoke. Dumbledore frowned.</p><p>"I'm afraid so. This program takes up the whole year, including some of your summer holidays." His words made Hermione's jaw drop. It was infuriating. She would have to read all of her books as the semester went on and not have any guidance from a teacher when she had questions.</p><p>"Professor, the letter mentioned something about partners... who are our partners?" Harry responded.</p><p>"Hm... Ah, I remember now. Thank you for asking that question, Harry. You are partnered with Cho. Ron, you are paired up with Lavender, and Hermione is partnered up with Draco. All six of you were hand picked by the Ministry." No one spoke. Hermione's heart started to beat rapidly.. <em>partners with Draco?</em></p><p>"WHAT?" Ron squeaked, breaking the silence. </p><p>Hermione started to think of all of the times Malfoy had been cruel to her. All of the times he called her a mudblood. The time she punched him in the face for messing with her friends.</p><p>She was determined to make him upright miserable like all of the times he made her feel. </p><p> "This was none of my doing. But, I will work with the Ministry to ensure you're all safe in this experiment; Whatever this experiment is. Here's what I do know, though. You will be training for a few months for this experiment. There are no breaks in between, but you will all be getting Christmas and birthday presents from the Ministry, which is a nice thing to add. If anything comes up that interrupts training or the experiment, they will pull you out, but will find a way to fill you back in,” Dumbledore spoke, “But, be careful; If this experiment is rough enough to where they have it for a whole school year, I will remind you all to be safe." A frown stared to form on the headmasters face. They all looked down and nodded.</p><p>"Now, I would like to show you your special dorms," Dumbledore sat up, motioning to follow him."If you'd follow me, please." The six stood up and started silently following the bearded wizard.</p><p>After what seemed like years of silence and walking, they arrived to the "Neophyte" common room. It wasn't much different than the Gryffindor common room, but looked elegant and polished, and sprinkled with the colors of the four Hogwarts houses. It felt homey with a modern touch.</p><p>Books sat neatly on the shelves in alphabetical order, along with certain potion ingredients and vials of labeled potions sat on the next two shelves. A chandelier hung from the ceiling, making the jewels hanging from the light reflect onto the walls.</p><p>Much like the Gryffindor common room, it held a fire place. The flames sparked a light yellow. </p><p>There also seemed to be grand windows with plants potted in the windowsill, some plants spikey and some hanging. It overall, it had a fresh feeling to it. </p><p>Dumbledore left the six to explore the new common room. Hermione went looking around to find the girls dorms, but Lavender beat her to it.</p><p>"So... you got Ron?" Hermione asked, holding her elbows. She didn't make eye contact with Lavender.</p><p>"Yes.. I did.. I'm quite happy about it. I.. I think I like him. He's quite cute, isn't he?" Lavender smiled, her cheeks rosey. "And you got Malfoy. He's cute too, isn't he?"</p><p>"Oh... Malfoy? He... he's an arrogant fool, that's what he is." Hermione shook her head, bringing her luggage to a bed. Moments later, Cho came in.</p><p>"Hey, Cho..." Lavender smiled.</p><p>"Hey, Lavender.." Cho responded.</p><p>"You alright?" Lavender asked.</p><p>"I... I don't know. I guess it's all coming back to me.. this experiment is dangerous. I'm really afraid one of us will end up like Cedric.." Cho sighed, dropping her luggage on the bed near Lavender.</p><p>"Cho... I'm sure it'll be alright. Those were the triwizard games.. this is an experiment by the Ministry. I'm sure we will be fine." Lavender tried to suggest.</p><p>"It won't be fine if I'm stuck for months with Malfoy." Hermione remarked, sticking her face in a book. It was the beginning of the end.</p>
