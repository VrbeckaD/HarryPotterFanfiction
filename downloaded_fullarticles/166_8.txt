</p><p>Harry Potter had just gotten back from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He was currently walking to his "home" or at least the place he had to choice but to call home. You see, Harry Potter is a wizard and he has to live with his abusive, physically and verbally, relatives. He lived with his cousin Dudley, his uncle Vernon, and his aunt Petunia. As Harry was walking home he didn't realize how slow he was walking until he checked his old broken down wrist watch and saw that he was almost a full two minutes late. To say Harry wasn't scared about going home was most likely a half lie. Harry wasn't as scared about going home as he would have been if he was walking home when he was eleven or twelve because he was used to the abuse now. </p><p>OoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOo</p><p>Severus Snape. Snape teaches Potions at Hogwarts, he's one of Harrys professors. You know, the one that takes all those points away from Gryffindor? Well, he's <em>always </em>had a rough life, so when he got a letter from Gringotts Wizarding Bank he wasn't that surprised, but the letter he got completely changed his life. The letter said:<br/><br/><em>Dear Severus, </em></p><p>
  <em>James and I knew something bad was going to happen soon so we went to Gringotts to register Harrys godfathers, </em>
</p><p>
  <em>I wanted to put you on the list with Sirius and Remus but James said no so I had to go back and add you separately. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>If anything ever happens to Sirius and/or Remus I need you to take Harry in, I don't want him going to Petunia. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>I don't care if you hate James or not, Harrys <u>my</u> son, so please take him. I have to make this short, but I just wanted </em>
</p><p>
  <em>to let you know that you are one of Harrys godfathers. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>With Love,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Lily Potter</em>
</p><p>Snape was shocked, he was Harry Potters godfather. </p>
