  <em>"Expecto Patronum!" They screamed, but nothing happened. Not even a small little thing of magic came bursting out of their wand.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>No magic at all and the dementors were closing in. "Why isn't it working?" Teala asked. "I don't know!" Manny cried. "Work you stupid stick!" Colleen snapped at her wand. As the atmosphere got colder and colder everything seemed far more blurry. "E-E-Exp-pec-to-" Roi groaned trying in his remaining strength. "Wheres the e-e-enemies  when you n-n-need t-them?" Manny shivered. Roi and Rosanna were huddled together still keeping a firm hold on their wands. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Matt, Nikita, and Safiya where suppose to be back by now! Did they get caught by Nicholas's followers? </em>
</p><p>
  <em>"J-J-Joey" Teala croaked and the Slytherin boy looked at the Hufflepuff girl. "B-B-Behind y-you!" She exclaimed and Joey turned around.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"EXPECTO patronum!" A voice screamed, they couldn't tell who, but it was a voice. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>A stream of silver light came their way, but the light faded as fast as it came. for five seconds there was nothing, but silence. Then the silence was broken by horrified screams.</em>
</p><p>~</p><p>"SAFIYA!" Rosanna screamed and Safiya jolted awake. She only relaxed when she saw it was just Ro and Matt. "Your hair!" The tiny girl chirped. "What about it?" Safiya asked. "It's almost fully gray!" "That stressful of a dream?" Matt asked. </p><p>"Y-Yeah." As much as Safiya loved being a metamorphmagus, Ro and Matt took a bit of an advantage to it when she was stressed. Eventually, her hair faded back to normal. Rosanna sat back down next to Matt and crossed her legs.</p><p>Safiya met the two of them when she was in her third year, and they were in their fourth. She instantly became best friends with the Hufflepuff girl and Gryffindor boy. Together they took on Hogwarts together!</p><p>Now that it was their last year Safiya couldn't help but, be a little sad. She didn't want to be alone and get the memories of her first year to come back and haunt her.</p><p>"Hey, you alright?" Matt asked pushing up his glasses. "I'm alright." She lied. "Just excited for another wonderful year," Safiya said sarcastically. "What's your blood type?" Matt asked and Rosanna flicked him on the back of his head. "Matt! You know we aren't supposed to ask people what kind they have! Ever since McGonagall became headmistress it's considered rude to ask such a question!"</p><p>"It's fine Ro, no headmistress or professor insight," Safiya assures the tiny girl. "And I'm Halfblood. My mother is a muggle and my father is a wizard." Safiya told him. For as long as they've been friends, Matt and Ro never met Safiya's parents. Safiya would always go over to their place.</p><p>"This conversation makes you sound like your the next Harry Potter," Rosanna admitted.</p><p>Safiya laughed in response. "I'm no Harry Potter. That'd be cool, but to many adventures for me. I like adventure, but not near death."</p><p>"Hogwarts hasn't had any death yet and I am not being the person who dies," Matt said. "Dark," Ro said and Matt shrugged.</p><p>~</p><p>As the sun slowly set and a sleepy silence came in the compartment. "We'll be there any minute. I'll let you two get changes first."</p><p>As the students got changed and ready, the first years full of fear. The second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth years excited to be back and the seventh years taking their time since this would be the last time. </p><p>As the train came to a halt everyone grabbed their things and pets and exited the train. </p><p>The first years were boarded onto the boats and the rest of them got into the Thestral carried carriage.</p><p>~</p><p>Matt Rosanna and Safiya got into the last one which nobody hopped into thankfully.</p><p>"I'm excited about getting back to the kitchen!" Rosanna said. "And I can't wait for History of Magic!" Matt said. "I can't believe that's still your favorite class," Safiya said.</p><p>"Ma'am you like charms! That's basic!" Matt said.</p><p>"You're in Gryffindor!"</p><p>"Almost Ravenclaw!"</p><p>"Yet here you are, in Gryffindor robes," Safiya said pointing her wand at his red robes.</p><p>"Did you guys see the new article in The Daily Prophet?" Rosanna asked. "I'm Muggleborn, I don't get much wizard stuff," Matt said. "And my mother doesn't really want much stuff related to the wizarding world," Safiya said.</p><p>"Oh right, sorta forgot." Rosanna giggled. "But anyway, apparently theirs rumors of a Dementor sighting," Rosanna said. </p><p>"Dementors haven't been around since Harry was in the fifth year." Safiya pointed out. "Have you guys even heard of the confirmed Azkaban break out?" </p><p>Safiya and Matt tensed up.</p><p>There wasn't an Azkaban breakout since the battle of Hogwarts.</p><p>"What do you mean a breakout? Azkaban got tighter security! Got rid of its Dementors!" Matt said.</p><p>"Rumor has it a dark force broke them out," Rosanna said. "Do you know what witches and wizards?" Matt asked, and Rosanna shrugged. "Wizards and witches who killed." "Like Bellatrix and Voldemort?" Safiya asked.</p><p>"I don't really know, but I heard they don't use magic to kill. Even though they're mostly Pureblood." Rosanna shivered. "That's freaky. I'm so used to magic." Matt confessed.</p><p>"Magic can kill instantly. Muggle ways, it can take a while. I guess they like their victims in pain." Rosanna said.</p><p>"As long as they don't come to Hogwarts, we'll be alright," Safiya said.</p><p>"Exactly! The wizarding world needs a bit of a break!" Rosanna said. "For now, let's enjoy our year at Hogwarts," Rosanna said.</p><p>"Sounds like a plan," Safiya said. "Agreed, I can't wait to come to the top of my class!" Matt beamed. "Hold the thought buddy, I will," Safiya said. "I'm being challenged by a bat, wow," Matt said.</p><p>"Hey! I am not a bat!" Safiya said while she morphed herself to have bat fangs, ears, and nose. Matt and Ro laughed and Safiya laughed too.</p><p>~</p><p>They laughed and joked for the rest of the carriage ride before stopping. "Ready for another year?" Matt asked. "More ready than ever!" Rosanna said and got out with the help of Safiya. </p><p>Another year, another adventure awaited them! Yet this adventure would be one that would stick with them for a while.</p>
