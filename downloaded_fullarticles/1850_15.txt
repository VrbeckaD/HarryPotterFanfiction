    <p>"You CANNOT possibly be serious!! You're charging me for the abuse of and attack on Ginny Potter???" Hermione Granger screamed while looking out at the sea of witches and wizards assembled above her. She glanced at her (once) surrogate family, only to see Molly Weasley hold a glare that would make Bellatrix piss her pants. Harry's face, though downcast, showed fury over what he thought had been done to his wife. Speaking of, said red-head was casting a fearful look toward Hermione while clutching onto Harry with her red talonsahem-nails.</p><p>The remaining Weasleys had varying looks of disbelief, devastation and indifference on their faces. Charlie and George looked devastated that the girl they had practically adopted as a sister could ever hurt their baby sister. Percy studiously observed the events that occurred before him. Hermione hoped he would use the logic to come to a conclusion, rather than be shadowed over by the famous Weasley loyalty. She could not believe the evil wench had accused her of something so despicable.<br/>"Hermione Granger, you have been charged with the assault of the youngest child of the pure and honorable House of Weasley, and the wife of an Order of Merlin First Class holder, The-Boy-Who-Lived, Harry Potter. How do you plead?"</p><p>With that one statement Hermione knew what would happen to her. It was clear that prejudice ran high even after all they have fought for. It was Ginny's word against her own and even if Ginny could have glamoured her injuries, the tests had been conducted and conclusions had been drawn. Hermione Granger, muggle-born, brightest witch of her age, Order of Merlin First Class would not have enough traction in her statement to beat Ginerva Molly Potter nee Weasley, pureblood housewife of Harry Potter and prove her innocence. But, she had to try. She would not go down without a fight. Thus, with that realisation Hermione looked up from the chair she was shackled to and stated in a clear voice that rang through the chamber, "Not guilty."</p><p>As the crowd whispered and the trial continued with heart wrenching tales from Ginny about her experiences at the hand of Hermione and skillfully woven tales by Molly of how Hermione had always been jealous of Ginny's success. Here, Hermione snorted, she created the cure for lycanthropy and an abundance of new potions and spells for the magical community. Why in Merlin's name would she be jealous of a housewife of all things? At the end of the witness statement, the head of the Wizengamot, Amos Diggory, stood and announced "Hermione Jane Granger, you are hereby sentenced to 25 years in Azkaban and having your wand snapped and turned over to the ministry for the assault of Ginerva Molly Potter"</p><p>And with just those few words, her fate was sealed. She looked out upon the crowd of prejudiced witches and wizards, all of whom she fought for, giving up her entire childhood, deciding her fate in just a few moments, without deliberation and whispered "Salvator Ponetur Ad Dexteram."</p><p>*Flashback*<br/>"Professor!" Hermione exclaimed, startled at seeing the looming dark figure of the potions professor within the Black family library.<br/>"Ms. Granger, I am no longer your professor. I think you've earned the prerogative of calling me Severus. I am here to discuss the aftermath of the war if the light side shall prevail"<br/>Giving him a perplexed look, she asked "Shouldn't the aftermath be the end of prejudice and the recuperation of magic society? Rebuilding from the ground up and fixing all the holes in the Ministry?"<br/>With a saddened look in his onyx eyes, he replied "Perhaps if we were in the muggle world, but in the magical world, I can tell you with certainty that prejudice would not end by the end of the war. If anything, it will become more pronounced, endangering your life as a muggleborn. The magical society, Hermione, is still patriarchal and will always remain so. The purebloods will never let the power slip from their hands. They will wait until all is calm, and ten, under the guise of reforms, create newer, stricter laws that will prevent muggle-borns from having enough power to lead a rebellion, of this scale, ever again."<br/>"But professor"<br/>"What will happen is that you will be awarded hero status and will be celebrated within the first two weeks but then you will be taken to court, accusations of varying degrees upon your person, so I advise you to take and understand my next words very carefully."<br/>"Sir, you can't be serious I-"<br/>" 'Salvator Ponetur Ad Dexteram.' These words mean "A Hero's Right" and will call upon magic itself to try you. The aftermath of will bring change upon the person who casts it. If proven not guilty for whatever crime they have been accused of, it is said to give power to the betrayed and fallen and a life to those deemed worthy."<br/>Giving him a fearful look in her honey brown eyes "Severus I"<br/>"Everything shall turn out fine Hermione. Do not fear." Laying a hand on the junctione between her neck and shoulder, reassuring her that he would be there in her time of need.<br/>But, 2 weeks later in the final battle, he had died.</p><p>*End flashback*</p><p>“Any last words? Ms. Granger?”</p><p>Hermione looked up, her brown curls crackling with untethered magic and her eyes showing a darkness, and despite her torn and ragged appearance she clearly exuded a power in which not many of that generation (or any before) possessed. In a clear voice, looking straight into the eyes of the man who sentenced her she stated "Salvator Ponetur Ad Dexteram"</p><p>"As a proclaimed hero by the Ministry of Magic, I have a right under magical law to be tried in an environment in which will judge fairly and without any predetermined prejudice, so I call on magic itself, by a hero's right to be tried under their watchful eye and spirit."<br/>Headman Diggory signaled for the crowd to be quietened and looked to the young woman, barely out of her teens, sitting in the wooden chair below and said, "That act has not been called for in hundreds of years and cannot be taken lightly Ms. Granger."<br/>"I am aware of all clauses as well as consequences this act ensues, and I choose to be tried under the might of magic." Her voice rang true and clear throughout the chamber</p><p>The courtroom broke out into hysterics with the Weasley matriarch screaming "TREASON!" Wizards and witches alike, looked down upon the muggleborn who had chosen to defile such a sacred and ancient wizarding law.</p><p>"I WILL HAVE ORDER AT THIS ASSEMBLY" Diggory yelled while tapping his wooden gavel to his raised podium.<br/>"According to Wizarding bylaws we MUST grant your request but before doing so we must ask Lady Potter if she wishes to stand by her accusation towards the accused." With a glance toward Ginerva and seeing nod in response, he announced, "Under the bylaws of the magic that enforce and uphold our country and state of being this Wizengamot has called upon the sacred rites of Salvator Ponetur Ad Dexteram in which Hermione Granger shall be tried." At his completion of the order, a bright light engulfed the young woman sitting in the accused's chair and she knew no more.</p>
