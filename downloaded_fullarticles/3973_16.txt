    <p>Kendry wasn’t really smart. He wasn’t really good looking. He wasn’t really anything. And he knew it perfectly well. That’s why he was positive he would never have a chance with Jacelyn.</p>
<p>    She was gorgeous. Words couldn’t even describe how beautiful she was. The way her eyes shined with this mischievous glint whenever she smiled. The way her hair lay so smoothly, framing her perfect face. Her high cheekbones, her strong jaw. Her round, yet slightly flat lips. The way she talked, the way she moved in this almost elegant, feline manner.</p>
<p>    No matter what he did, she was always there in the back of his mind. He would think about talking to her, getting to know her, embracing her, kissing her even. He always wondered what it would be like, what it would feel like. Not just her lips against his, but the feeling he would have in his stomach. The butterflies creating a tornado in his stomach, he chills that would fly through his entire body. He wanted that. He wanted to know.</p>
<p>    However, it wasn’t only her looks that had him in awe. She was also a complete genius. Aced every test, always top of the class. Honestly, was there anything she couldn’t do?</p>
<p>   Besides love him.</p>
<p>    He sighed softly, slumping in his chair. Jacelyn was a few rows ahead of him, Professor McGonagall was at the front of the class rambling on about something that he wasn’t paying attention to.</p>
<p>His gritted his teeth in subtle frustration. Even when he couldn’t see her face, he couldn’t help but stare. He had this knot in the pit of his stomach. This want, this need.

   God dammit just look at me! His mind was spinning. He just wanted her to see him. Didn’t matter if it was for a split second or a full hour. He just wanted her to look at him.

   Though, he knew he wasn’t much to look at. With his average and easily forgettable face, wavy, dirty blonde hair that never seemed to sit right on his head, his eyes that were a boring honey-ish, golden color, and the faint freckles that peppered the bridge of his nose, he was nothing special. He was pale, tall, and lean, without much in the way of muscle. She had better things to do than look at him.

    A Hufflepuff. A softy. A pushover. Nothing.

    He tore his eyes from the back of her head and looked hopelessly at the floor.</p>
