    <p>
  <span>On the 31st of July 1980 Hadrian James Potter and Ethan Henry Potter were born. They were born at Saint Mungo's hospital, late at night, at the closing of July. Ethan was born first, screaming at the top of his tiny lungs due to the sudden shock of being forced from the safety of his mother's womb. He continued to fuss after this, kicking his legs, face red in frustration and possibly anger. A tuft of brown hair sticks up upon his head and unseen through his screwed up face are dark brown eyes.</span>
</p>
<p>Both his and Lily’s screams fill the room as Lily births her second child. Five minutes later Harry entered this world, though in a much quieter fashion to his older brother, it was as if he felt his brother was kicking up enough fuss as it was. In fact, he just takes a deep breath and settles down easily. In comparison to his brother the little hair he had on his head is a deep black, like that of a Raven's wing and deep green eyes rest under his pale eyelids.</p>
<p>Their mother, Lily Potter ne'e Evans, looked at her twin sons in wonderment, as if she didn't believe that she had carried them herself. Her husband, James Potter, rushed into the room and looked upon his wife and two sons in relief. Relief that they were okay and that his legacy was secure as a Lord. He had elected not to be in the room during the birth, knowing that his pacing would irritate his already distressed wife.</p>
<p>Lily cradles Ethan to her chest, trying to calm him as he continues to wail, in response to his brother Harry begins to cry as well, though not nearly as loud as Ethan. James scoops Harry into his arms and makes shushing noises. Harry begins to quieten immediately, seemingly confused as to why he was even crying in the first place. Ethan ceased his wailing soon after, replacing the cries with quiet sniffles.</p>
<p>For the next year, the small family lived happily. Harry and Ethan's godfathers, Sirius Black and Remus Lupin, visited often, showering the boys with gifts, and, if Harry was unnervingly quiet except for when he needed something, no one said a word.</p>
<p>Ethan liked to mindlessly babble, his first word being "no," reflecting upon his rather stubborn nature, even as a baby. Harry spoke little, and when he did speak he tended to be drowned out by his much louder sibling. Though sometimes Sirius would have Harry howling in laughter as he bounded around in his animagus form, frequently tripping over his large paws in his excitement. Sirius doted upon Harry, taking his duty as a godfather very seriously. Remus was more subdued, a little unsure of how to act with babies. He tended to follow Sirius’ lead with the boys, in that he strived to make them laugh and be happy. His way of making them laugh was different to Sirius'. He tickled them until they were breathless with their laughter and he laughed along with them. They made his tiredness lift from his shoulders and the burden of being a dark creature on the side of the light, in a war against the dark, lessen. Life was good, until it wasn't.</p>
<p>The Halloween, or Samhain, to more traditional families, of 1981 was just like any other. Children trick or treating, various parties going on, but the Potter household was a subdued one. The reason for the dark cloud that seemed to hover over the home was that a prophecy had been given. This prophecy foretold that a child born as the seventh month died could defeat Lord Voldemort. There was more to it though, this child had to be born to those who had thrice defied him. There were 3 children who fit these criteria, Neville, son of the Longbottoms', and Harry and Ethan. This caused both the Longbottoms and the Potters to go into hiding to try and protect their children. The small cottage in Godric's Hollow was under a fidelius charm. This charm hid the household from all but the inhabitants,  a secret keeper and whomsoever the secret keeper told. The location could not be pulled from the secret keeper forcefully, they had to willingly give it away. The Potter's initially resided in James' childhood home of Potter manor, however, as a charm the fidelius could only cover a small section of the building, rendering it nearly useless. This resulted in their move.</p>
<p>Sirius has picked up on the moods of the Potters,</p>
<p>"Come on Prongs! It won't hurt. Just ask one of the neighbours you're friendly with to watch them!" James, the aforementioned Prongs, shuffles nervously and glances at Lily, who watched the conversation unfold with an unreadable expression on her face,</p>
<p>"I don't know Padfoot, it doesn't seem like a great idea, what with you-know-who baying for our blood and all", Sirius scoffs and addresses both Lily and James,</p>
<p>"Come on, you've been cooped up for months! One night isn't going to hurt! The boys are asleep already," Lily sighs,</p>
<p>"he has a point James. We've been stuck here for months.” Lily is usually the more sensible of the two Potters but she can be just as bad as James at times. She would normally refuse Sirius, or at least argue but she’s sick to death of hiding away. She doesn't feel herself anymore really, she's tired, tired of hiding, tired of not going outside. Her sons had never seen the outside world and it was wearing on her. Whilst they are aware that tonight, of all nights, would be the most likely time for an attack the two parents feel that they need a break. Besides, Peter, their other friend, and secret keeper, is in hiding somewhere else so it should be safe for them to go out for a while. After all, it isn't them who are in danger, but their sons. As long as the twins stay under the wards then they should be safe surely?</p>
<p>Harry and Ethan are left in the care of an elderly neighbour called Dorothy Wright, a widow, she's glad to help her young, seemingly normal neighbours. A muggle, for that is what non-magical folk are known as, she had no idea just how unusual her neighbours were and settled down for an easy night, pulling out some knitting to pass the time.</p>
<p>A few hours after the twins were left in Dorothy's care the door of the Potter household suddenly blows inwards, pieces of door scattering haphazardly over the living room.  There's a cloaked figure standing imposingly in the doorway, a pale stick, his wand, held delicately in bone white fingers. Dorothy lets out a shriek of surprise and terror. Stumbling away from the figure, she brandishes her knitting needles like a sword as if they will protect her. If he was a muggle like she, perhaps they would have. As it is he just sneers. He utters,</p>
<p>"Avada Kedavra," and a flash of green light illuminates the room. Dorothy falls to the floor, dead, her terror now permanently etched onto her face and her body rapidly turning cold.</p>
<p>Lord Voldemort, for that is whom the cloaked figure is, steps towards the corpse of the old woman, robes quietly whispering over the ground. The Potters were fools for placing their trust in Peter Pettigrew and they would pay the price with the lives of their sons, though he does wish there were another way. He steps, uncaringly, over the corpse of the muggle woman that is quickly cooling and gracefully ascends the stairs.</p>
<p>Once at the top of the staircase he moved towards a door marked 'Ethan and Harry's room'. He heard a sad cry from inside and frowns in disdain. He had hoped that they would be sleeping, he must admit this would be the single kill that he would truly regret, they were magical children after all, he didn't want to look into their eyes as he killed them. Voldemort is not as emotionless as he portrays himself as, children and snakes are his only weaknesses. He's not even weak to death any more, he's removed that particular problem.</p>
<p>Now, Voldemort may be monstrous but he isn't entirely a monster. He doesn't believe that any magical blood should be spilt but Dumbledore forced his hand when he blocked the peaceful routes to him. He also cannot risk all he has worked for to be ruined by a child, no matter how powerful they may be. If the Potter family were less light he may have been able to make allies of them. That way the prophecy would most likely have been voided as they would not be his enemies.</p>
<p>He understands that what he is doing is necessary to secure his future, and the future of his campaign. Lord Voldemort steels himself then sweeps into the room, the door banging harshly into the wall as he does so. One of the children, the larger of the two and, presumably, the oldest, is crying at the top of his lungs, making his displeasure known, whilst the other is sitting sullenly, eyes scarily reminiscent of the killing curse seeming to look through into Voldemort's very soul. It is this one he decides to kill first. Being the younger of the two he's closer to fulfilling the prophecy. The quietness of the child as he approaches is quite unnerving and crimson eyes meet emerald warily. He takes a steadying breath, chasing away needless emotions. His face is blank, hiding the storm of emotions within him. He stands there for a moment, looking into the eyes of the child that would apparently have defeated him in future. There is an intelligence within those green depths that he didn't realize a child as young as he could have, but it is no matter. The man takes a steady breath.</p>
<p>Lord Voldemort raises his wand and utters the killing curse, with a flash of green light, not unlike Hadrian's eyes, an explosion ensues, brutalising the house. As his soul is ripped from its vessel, Voldemort wonders what went wrong.</p>
