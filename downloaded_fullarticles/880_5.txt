  <p><b> Chapter One </b> </p>
</center>Hermione glanced up at Severus, who was staring at her expectantly. He was waiting for her to say something. She had called after him as he began walking down the hall after the staff meeting.<p>His eyebrows rose as if to say, <i>well</i>? She could almost hear the drawl in her mind.</p><p><i>Come on, Hermione, just spit it out! Tell him you fancy him</i>! Her inner self was tapping her foot on the floor, impatiently. She tried to speak but found her voice had disappeared. Her throat had gone dry, and all that came out with a small squeak. She flushed in embarrassment. </p><p>Severus huffed, "If that is all, Professor Granger." He turned and made his way down the hallway, his robes billowing behind him.</p><p>She felt her heart sink in disappointment. She didn’t know why she thought she'd be able to tell him. It wasn’t as if he saw her in any way other than an annoying ex-student or colleague. She wouldn’t ever know his feelings.</p><p><i>Well maybe if you told him how you felt, he would tell you! Go after him, stupid</i>, her conscience chided.</p><p>"Professor Snape!" she cried once more and ran after him. He stopped but didn't turn to face her. She panted, trying to catch her breath.</p><p>"Listen, Professor Granger, I do not wish to play games with you, so if you have something you need to say, spit it out, girl," he growled, his back still turned to her.</p><p>She took a deep breath. <i>You can do this; just tell him how you feel</i>.</p><p>"Severus," she ignored the huff he made when she used his first name, "I don't exactly know how to say what I want to say. Every time I try to admit what's on my mind, I just freeze up. I'm so nervous about how you'll react that I lose my nerve." She gently placed her hand on his shoulder. She braced herself for the impact of what her confession would bring. "I care for you, Severus, as more than just a colleague, or even just a friend. I know you may not return my affections, but I just needed you to know. I couldn’t keep it to myself any longer."</p><p>He didn't say anything, and she felt her heart sink. She sighed and then turned to walk away. She was a fool. Severus would never return her feelings. She was idiotic for even thinking he would. She took two steps down the hall before she felt him grip her shoulders, turning her around to face him. He pulled her into a hidden alcove, so they wouldn't be seen.</p><p>His lips crashed on hers before she could even register what was going on.</p><p>The kiss was hard and rough, filled with a primal need of want and desire. She reached up, wrapping her arms around his neck. She groaned into it, savouring every sensation. The feel of his silky smooth hair slipping through her fingers, the taste of his mouth on hers, the smell of musky woods, the sound of soft groans escaping. Opening her eyes, she saw his black ones staring back at her.</p><p>Abruptly, the kiss ended.</p><p>He stared at her, and then gently tucked a strand of her hair behind her ear. "Why?" he asked softly.</p><p>Hermione blushed, still unable to process everything that had just taken place. "I don't know where or how it began… You were so brave during the war, and you saved so many lives, including mine. You're so articulate; the way you speak sends chills down my spine. And you're just so insecure about yourself and life in general, yet you just keep trying to push on. You've never said my name, and although I'm not sure if it's out of respect or annoyance that I'm a teacher, I like it. I like how, although you've never shown it, I know you respect me as an equal. Severus, there are so many-"</p><p>"Hermione," he whispered, his soft baritone voice caressing her name.</p><p>She shivered. <i>Severus kissed you, and he said your name! He definitely cares about you. This is good</i>. Hope began to spread throughout her body.</p><p>His fingertips brushed her collarbone, gently touching the skin. He felt the coarse skin caused by Dolohov's curse. He frowned, causing Hermione to blush insecurely. He unbuttoned his frock coat, and then lifted the shirt, revealing his pale skin. "I am similarly marked."</p><p>Hermione gently ran her fingers over his scar. It felt exactly the same as hers. This fact calmed her, as strange as that was. She wasn't the only person in the world who had been hurt by Dolohov. She wasn't alone in the pain she still felt.</p><p>She began to shake. Sighing, Severus pulled her into his arms. "Hermione, please stop shaking. Why are you so scared?"</p><p>She sighed, trying to calm herself. "What does this mean, Severus? What does this mean for us? I just… I'm confused."</p><p>Severus grabbed her chin and tipped her face upwards. "Hermione, I've been suppressing feelings for you for the past two years you've been teaching here. I've spent hours convincing myself that I'm not good enough for you. Hearing you say that you care for me," he sighed, "The way that makes me feel is indescribable."</p><p>He gently pressed his lips to hers once more. Their second kiss was just as perfect as the first in Hermione's opinion.</p><p>"Come to my office after your classes this morning, Professor Granger," he commanded softly. He pressed another kiss to her lips.</p><p>She smiled, nodding. "I'll see you then, Severus." She watched as he exited the small alcove and headed towards his classroom.</p><p>Hermione made her way to her own classroom in a daze. She could hardly believe the turn of events that had happened. She couldn’t believe that she had confessed to Severus that she fancied him. She also couldn’t believe that he kissed her instead of hexing her silly. She still couldn’t believe he fancied her back!</p><p>She sat down at her desk in the Defense against the Dark Arts' classroom. She began trying to grade her second-years' papers but found her thoughts kept drifting.</p><p>About two and a half years ago, Harry had finally defeated Voldemort, but the Wizarding World was left in shambles. Harry and Ron immediately left for Auror training, leaving Hermione behind as she had no desire to continue fighting any longer.</p><p>So, knowing that she needed to do something useful with her time, she helped Minerva and the rest of the teachers rebuild the castle. They had finished right before the next term was supposed to start. It was a miracle, in her own opinion. A few people on the Board of Governors did not think that they would finish in time.</p><p>When the reconstruction was over, Minerva had asked her to stay on as a teacher, and Hermione had happily obliged. Hogwarts was her home, and it would continue to be so.</p><p>Three days before the students arrived, she left to Australia to try and find her parents. Ron, who was her then-boyfriend, was supposed to accompany her, but he cancelled at the last minute. Hermione went alone, but a strain had been placed on their relationship. She did her best to ignore it, much like she ignored most of the things Ron did, but it began to eat at her.</p><p>She had pushed it from her mind and quickly found her parents. After a few tries, she finally succeeded in restoring their memories. They were angry with her at first, but after explaining everything, they understood. In fact, they were slightly proud that she had thought about their safety over anything else. </p><p>Hermione's parents decided that they wanted to stay in their new neighbourhood and keep the jobs they had found. She respected their decision and told them that she would write often and visit as much as she could over the holidays.</p><p>She had arrived back at Hogsmeade, with a day left before term. So, she had decided to pay Harry and Ron a visit. It turned out that Harry wasn't there, but Lavender Brown was, so Hermione immediately ended their relationship.</p><p>They still talked every once and a while, but the blow of Ron's infidelity still stung. But like everything else, she pushed it from her mind and threw herself into her teaching one hundred percent. It had been her coping mechanism. Although it was unhealthy, it was what calmed her.</p><p>Things were great until Severus had been deemed well enough to be released from St. Mungo's. After learning the truth from Harry, she saw Severus in a different light. She had always respected the man, but her respect had grown. </p><p>That was when the infatuation started. He wanted nothing to do with her, but she wanted everything to do with him. She would always try and make it so they would patrol on the same night, claiming she needed to borrow potion ingredients, chaperone Hogsmeade with him, anything so she would be around him.</p><p>And now here she was, two years later. She had finally summoned enough Gryffindor courage to tell him how she felt. </p><p>A noise distracted her. Looking up, she was surprised to see her students filing in for class. Her free period had flown by. She had not got much of her marking done.</p>
<hr/><p>She quickly made her way down towards the dungeons after the morning classes. Her heart was racing. She stared at his door and immediately felt like a student once more. Ignoring the pitter-patter of her heart, she raised her hand and gently knocked on his door.</p><p>The door swung open, revealing a scowling Potions' Master. His expression immediately relaxed when he saw it was her. He stepped aside, gesturing for her to come in.</p><p>She nervously twiddled her fingers as she followed Severus into his private study. It was slightly larger than her own, but she suspected that it was because Slytherin had a larger ego than the other Founders. He gestured for her to take a seat on the sofa, which she did. "So…" She muttered, her nerves getting the better of her. </p><p>He sat down next to her, a small smile playing on his own lips. The sight was so unusual, but it filled Hermione with happiness. </p><p>Hermione stared at the floor. <i>Where did all your confidence go, Hermione? Come on; you got him where you want him! Make a move</i>, her subconscious sniped at her.</p><p>"Severus, I-"</p><p>Severus cut her off with another kiss. He wanted her to know that he did care for her. "Hermione, I don't deserve you," he stated, "but I want you, more than you could ever know. I know there is no use in discussing my flaws, as I don't doubt that you already have counter-arguments for each and every one of them."</p><p>"That I do," she whispered back, tangling her fingers in his hair, pulling him closer. She placed another kiss upon his lips.</p><p>Pulling away, he smiled. "Shall I have the elves bring us dinner?"</p><p>She nodded, her eyes never leaving him. Dinner appeared, and the two of them ate in silence, his hand holding hers lightly. He repeatedly rubbed his thumb over her knuckles, sending shivers down her spine.</p><p>Once they finished, they stayed seated on the sofa together. Both were relaxed, discussing the Wolfsbane potion when Hermione suddenly went rigid. She began to tremble, her body shaking roughly.</p><p>"Hermione, what's wrong?" Severus asked, clearly concerned.</p><p>She clutched his shoulder. "Don't worry, it happens all the time," she spat out through clenched teeth.</p><p>"Hermione, this isn't normal," he said as pulled her into his arms. He held her carefully until she finished shaking.</p><p>She shrugged but remained in his embrace. "It's happened since the war. These tremors, they're part of my life now."</p><p>"Oh, Hermione," he whispered, pressing his lips to hers in an attempt to soothe her. She sighed into his kiss – thankful for his warmth and comfort.</p><p>"What would you like to do?" he asked, helping her lay back against the sofa. He stayed close to her side.</p><p>"We could read?" she suggested, a smile on her face.</p><p>"All right," he nodded. He stood and walked over to his bookshelf, where he grabbed two books. He walked back over and handed one to Hermione. She smiled once more.</p><p>"You're probably the only one I know who likes to read as much as I do," he said with a soft smile.</p><p>She nodded. "Books have always been my life."</p><p>He took in her words. They were more alike than he thought.</p><p>The two of them got lost in the reading.</p><p>Some time later, Severus glanced at the clock and saw that it was half-past midnight. "Hermione, you should probably head back to your rooms," he suggested.</p><p>She didn't respond.</p><p>Looking down, Severus had found that she had fallen asleep. She looked so peaceful, sleeping; he didn’t want to wake her. He wordlessly summoned a blanket and wrapped it around the two of them. Closing his eyes, he too drifted off to sleep.</p>
<hr/><p>The next morning, Hermione awoke, surprised to find herself sleeping on the couch, wrapped around Severus's body. She pressed a kiss to his jaw, causing him to stir.</p><p>"Morning," he mumbled.</p><p>"Good morning," she said brightly. Sitting up, she stretched her arms. "Severus, I think this is the first time I've slept through the night without having a fit." She kissed him. "Thank you."</p><p>He ran his hand through her hair, laughing when his fingers caught on a curl. "Hermione, will you accompany me to Hogsmeade later today?"</p><p>She blushed. "Severus Snape, are you asking me on a date?" she asked, a teasing tone in her voice.</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"Then yes! I'd love too!" She exclaimed, her lips claiming his once more.</p><p>She finally had the man she had been dreaming about. She had a feeling that things would work out for them both. At least, she hoped.</p>
