          <div class="userstuff"><p>Tom was standing on the side of the road waiting anxiously for her, there was very little light but suddenly it went out and the darkness pervaded over their location, only one thing gave off this much darkness and that was her beautiful dark hair. Tom couldn’t see her properly but he could picture her perfectly in his mind. All he wanted was to run his fingers through her hair but they were not alone and the Death Eaters could not know he had a weakness. He whispered “lumos” and she walked into the light and Bella looked even better than he could ever imagine. Her beautiful black hair was fluttering in the wind and her eyes glinted with the knowledge of the thoughts she caused to run through his mind.</p></div>
