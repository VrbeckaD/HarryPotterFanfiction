<hr/><p>No, he doesn’t see his da very much anymore.  </p><p>Short time stopped, and Thursday and Friday were threaded back into the working week.  Tobias leaves at 8 and is back for 6.  The radio is quieter, and their plates are full, with thick slices of bread hanging off the edge of the plate.  Eating’s a race now - not concerned with savouring every mouthful, in the knowledge that there’s no more until breakfast.  If hunger strikes now, there’s always chance of a sugar buttie before bed.</p><p>Tobias finishes first - and then raises his fork, hanging it over Severus’ meal.  “Not hungry, lad?”</p><p>Severus’ arm rounds his plate as he shovels food quickly into his mouth.  “Angin’, Da.”</p><p>And his dad laughs - a hearty boom that fills the house.  “Me an’ all, son - so get it down yer neck afore me appetite gets the best o’ me.”  </p><p>“Don’t tease the boy, Toby,” Eileen admonishes, pecking him on the cheek, her lips soft against his rough stubble.  He twists until his lips meet hers, and then he’s up - the pair of them retreating to the cramped kitchen whilst Severus hastily gulps down the rest of his potatoes.</p><p>Ten minutes later, he sits on the back step with his da, watching as he knocks the mud off his boots and wipes them round with a rag.  Severus grabs the tins of polish, and Tobias uses one brush then the other to treat and shine the leather.  He gives them a once over with a dry cloth and then pulls them on his feet.</p><p>“Da?”</p><p>“Get yer shoes on, lad,” he says, striding to the coalhouse, and pulling out the football.  “If yer fancy a kick about across the rec?”</p><p>“Yes!”  Severus rushes past his mum to grab his shoes, and Eileen wipes her hands on her apron, her eyebrow raised.  “At this time?  On a school night?”</p><p>“Nowt that school can teach ‘im,” Tobias shrugged.  “He’s full o’ them fancy words from yer books already.  But a proper left foot, now that’s worth ‘avin.”  </p>
<hr/><p>He really doesn’t see his da anymore.  </p><p>The orders pile in, and overtime starts - a half hour in the morning, and another at night.  Then an hour.  Then a half.  Nowadays, Severus gets up in the dark, and his da has already left - his mug is cold to the touch, with quarter of an inch of dark tea in the bottom.  At night, he sits on the step, and waits for him to come home - but more often than not, his mam bustles him off to bed before he sets eyes on his old man.</p><p>“Just ten more minutes?”</p><p>Tobias missed Severus’ first footy match, where he made his debut against that posh school from over the river - and his first goal, two weeks later against the all boys school.  He completely missed the Tuesday evening carol service despite promising that he’d get there, and only just managed to catch the last ten minutes of the Friday afternoon church nativity where Severus was narrator - which Eileen claimed was only because their boy was the only child who went to Sunday school regularly who could read aloud with confidence.  Severus thought she was more disappointed than he was that he didn’t get to be Joseph.</p><p>It wasn’t all bad, Severus mused - Tobias had also missed hearing about him breaking Mrs Jones’ window, and swearing at his teacher, and that little explosion of magic down the back alley.  He’d have been belted for sure for the last one, and probably the first two as well.  His mam just cuffed him around the ear and told him to stop letting his emotions get the better of him.</p><p>She’s been watching him with a funny expression of late - he thought she was going to coss him for sure when she caught him with his nose in the tin of polish, and she did give him a clip when she caught him rubbing his finger across the empty tobacco pouch his father had left on the table.</p><p>“Get on wi’ yer,” he scoffed, as he tugged his shirt off and readied himself for bed.  “Lad’s away wi’ the fairies most of the day.  He wunt notice if I dropped mesel’ down dead.”  </p><p>Eileen said nothing, but used her wand to snap the light off, missing the small smile that was playing on her husband’s lips.</p>
<hr/><p>He sees his da on a Saturday.</p><p>It’s the best day of the week.  Friday’s still bath night, and his da washes before heading down the pub.  Severus knows to get up early on a Saturday - quietly, lest he disturb his father’s hangover - and count the coins and notes on the worktop.  A good pile means that Tobias was on form - his eye was in with his arrows, or the drop of the dominoes was in his favour.  Other weeks, the pile is meagre - each failed gamble following another, and with alcohol impairing his decision making, Tobias was never capable of calling time on a bad hand.  </p><p>Last night was a good night.  Severus secretes one of the notes into his pocket; he’ll give it to his mam when she’s finished chatting to Mary from next door - and she’ll save it.  Tobias knows this little trick the pair of them have conjured, ensuring that there’s always a Saturday to look forward to, even if the Friday before hasn’t gone as planned.</p><p>The morning speeds by quickly, filled with shopping, and a lingering visit to the library.  He makes milky tea for two and reads whilst Eileen washes Tobias’ work clothes, and then he eagerly watches as she prepares a simple potion - grinning from ear to ear as she offers him control of the knife, his tongue creeping between his lips as he concentrates on slicing the ingredients into fine ribbons.</p><p>As the brew bubbles, he cleans Tobias’ boots, swinging them wildly and banging them against the brickwork before cracking open the tin of polish - and then the familiar tang of cigarette smoke fills the air, and Severus turns and smiles.  His father’s face is craggy - unwashed and unshaven, his odour comprising of Brylcreem, lingering carbolic soap and day-old-ale.  </p><p>His da drapes his scarf on Severus’ shoulders, the length almost causing him to trip.  Tobias laughs, and twists it once, twice around his neck before setting off.  Severus trots along, his short legs striving to keep up with his father’s long stride and quick pace.  </p><p>They yell from the terraces in unison, disposable cups full of bitter tea in their hands.  When a burly man unapologetically stands before his boy and blocks his view, Tobias lifts Severus onto his shoulders and his son’s heels kick happily against his chest when the ball finds the net.  Severus stays on his shoulders as they walk through the turnstile, the newfound height protecting him from the crush of bodies, and it’s several streets before Tobias sets him down.  Flush with the thrill of the win, Severus runs into the chip shop and presses his nose against the hot glass of the counter.</p><p>“Get yer nose off, soft lad,” Tobias rebukes, his voice softer than his words as he pulls his son’s face back from the glass.  “Two large chips, fishcake for the missus, two sausage, mushy peas,” and he looks at his son, “an’ the usual for you, lad?”  </p><p>Severus’ silent reply is an emphatic nod.</p><p>“Pineapple ring, curry sauce, scraps an’ a smack for the boy.”</p><p>“Yer wan’ a smack, eh?”  Mr Davies raised his hand, the chip shovel gleaming under the artificial lights.  </p><p>Severus laughs, despite the same joke being repeated every week, and points at the battered flat potato, his greasy finger smudging the glass once more.  “One o’ them.”</p><p>He watches keenly as the proprietor liberally splashes malt vinegar across the parcels, followed by a steady flow of salt.  He wraps the packages quickly, the vinegar soaking through the paper.</p><p>“Here y’are, careful wi’ it,” Tobias says, placing a couple of packages carefully onto Severus’ outstretched palms before lifting the rest himself.  They’re warm and damp, and Severus takes his time walking the rest of the way home, keen to ensure that he doesn’t trip.  </p><p>At home, Tobias divides the chips into three meals whilst Eileen prepares bread and butter.  She watches as both of her boys carefully construct chip butties, Severus emulating his father’s actions, and then dipping the edge of his rolled over bread into his pot of curry sauce, hot butter escaping from the bottom of the bread and dripping down his small fingers.</p><p>“Good day then, boys?”</p><p>“The best, Mam,” Severus said, around a mouthful of food.  “The absolute best.”  </p></div>
