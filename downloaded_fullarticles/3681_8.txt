    <p>Voldemort blew down the door and barely even blinked as he deflected the curse James Potter aimed at him. He stupefied the idiot and went after the mudblood, who’d had run upstairs and stupidly stood in front of the crib instead of doing anything useful. The idiotic woman didn’t even have her wand on her. Voldemort had no intention of killing anyone but the prophesied child, so he didn't kill her, simply threw a quick stunner her way.</p><p>However, Voldemort was faced with an issue, not one child (like he was informed by that cowardly, traitorous rat), but two. The first, a girl with long red hair identical to her mother’s with large brown eyes. The second, a boy with black hair and piercing, green eyes. </p><p>The girl began to cry, spurred on by her mother's slumped figure but the boy did nothing. He simply stared straight up at Voldemort.</p><p>Voldemort quickly made his decision. With barley a glance at the other child, he turned his curse on the one that the prophecy was clearly talking about. However, the killing curse backfired, destroying Voldemort. A piece of his soul locked on one of few living things in the room, the child he'd failed to destroy.</p><p>Harry.</p><p> </p><p>
  <u>Two Days Later</u>
</p><p>Lily and James sat in Dumbledore’s office.</p><p>"Send Harry to the Dursleys, Eva is clearly the Chosen One."</p><p>It had been obvious who Voldemort had been trying to kill, large swarms of dark magic had been near her crib and the thing itself was half destroyed. The rebounded spell had spared almost none of the room except for Harry's crib. With the amount of magic surrounding Eva and not her brother, it was agreed that he'd gone after the baby girl.</p><p>He sat forward and stared at them imploringly.</p><p>"I agree, we should focus on Eva. Harry will just be jealous and get in the way." James said, trying to be reasonable and logical about the whole situation. </p><p>"She'll require training too." Lily chipped in, feeling slightly guilty.</p><p>She'd never really loved Harry, not like she did her daughter. He was her child, sure, but something about him made her nervous. She could never put her finger on what, exactly, about him made her nervous, but it made her object less than she would have if someone tried to take away Eva. Plus, she thought that Harry would be jealous of his famous sister, at least that's how she justified sending him to her own hateful sister.</p><p>Lily knew what it was like to grow up in a family where one sister was favoured. Her parents never admitted it, but they like Petunia more, at least until her Hogwarts letter came and suddenly she their special, magical child. Lily would never admit that was probably Petunia's problem with her and magic.</p><p>So, that's how two days later Petunia found her nephew abandoned on her doorstep.</p>
